I start by apologising for the HTML embedding - still can't find the switch
to turn it off in Outlook 97...

----------------------------------

&gt; Installing XP
&gt; 
&gt; YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL WINDOWS XP, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
&gt; CONTINUE?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; ARE YOU REALLY SURE?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; ARE YOU REALLY REALLY SURE?
&gt; 
&gt; *****yes!******
&gt; 
&gt; OK, THEN. JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE'RE REQUIRED TO ASK YOU THAT NOW. IT'S ALL
&gt; YOUR FAULT FOR BEING A PICKY CONSUMER AND SUPPORTING THAT WHOLE
&gt; "ANTI-TRUST" NONSENSE. INGRATE.
&gt; 
&gt; Just get on with it.
&gt; 
&gt; ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL WINDOWS XP. FIRST WE NEED TO CHECK YOUR SYSTEM FOR
&gt; COMPATIBILITY. THIS COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS.
&gt; 
&gt; Groan.
&gt; 
&gt; THE INSTALL PROGRAM HAS DETECTED SEVERAL POSSIBLE PROBLEMS AND WILL NOT
&gt; LET YOU INSTALL XP.
&gt; 
&gt; Problems? What problems?
&gt; 
&gt; THE VIDEO CARD YOU ARE USING APPARENTLY DOES NOT WORK WITH THE
&gt; MOTHERBOARD.
&gt; 
&gt; But I'm using it at this very moment.
&gt; 
&gt; THAT IS IRRELEVANT.
&gt; 
&gt; But if the video card isn't working with the mother board then I can't
&gt; very well see this warning message telling me that the video card
&gt; wasn't...
&gt; 
&gt; DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FOOL ME WITH LOGIC, I AM A MICROSOFT PRODUCT. LOGIC DOES
&gt; NOT WORK ON ME. I HAVE ALSO FOUND THE FOLLOWING MINOR ERRORS: WINDOWS XP
&gt; IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FOLLOWING HARDWARE - MONITOR, KEYBOARD, MEMORY
&gt; CHIPS, MOTHERBOARD BIOS, WEB CAM, SCANNER, SOUND CARD, USB CONTROLLER,
&gt; CD/R DRIVE, MICROPHONE, AND FLIGHT STICK.
&gt; 
&gt; All that?
&gt; 
&gt; YES. AND THE HARD DRIVE IS RIGHT OUT TOO. WE DON'T LIKE THE MANUFACTURER.
&gt; 
&gt; Well what *DOES* work?
&gt; 
&gt; THE MOUSE.
&gt; 
&gt; The mouse?
&gt; 
&gt; YES. AND THE 5 1/4 DRIVE.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't have a 5 1/4 drive.
&gt; 
&gt; YES YOU DO.
&gt; 
&gt; No I don't.
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT'S THAT THEN?
&gt; 
&gt; It's a 3 1/2 drive.
&gt; 
&gt; NO IT ISN'T.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes it is.
&gt; 
&gt; YOU'RE NOT THAT SMART YOU KNOW.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, can you just install XP on my system and I'll download the latest
&gt; drivers for everything later? Please?
&gt; 
&gt; WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN *YOUR* SYSTEM?
&gt; 
&gt; Well it is mine.
&gt; 
&gt; NO IT ISN'T.
&gt; 
&gt; It bloody well is.
&gt; 
&gt; NUH-UH. YOU SIGNED THE AGREEMENT WHEN YOU OPENED THE BOX. OUR SYSTEM. IT'S
&gt; OURS. AND YOU CAN ONLY DO 4 CHANGES BEFORE YOU HAVE TO PAY US MORE MONEY.
&gt; 
&gt; But why?
&gt; 
&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE LICENSE WORKS, IDIOT. WE CAN'T VERY WELL HAVE
&gt; PEOPLE PUTTING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ON THEIR SYSTEMS ALL HIGGLEDY
&gt; PIGGLEDY, NOW COULD WE? YOU USERS WOULD MUCK EVERYTHING UP, AND THEN WHERE
&gt; WOULD WE BE? I'LL TELL YOU WHERE, NOWHERE. THAT'S WHERE. I... HEY, WHAT IS
&gt; THAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IS THAT A DISK? WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT
&gt; DISK? YOU'RE NOT PUTTING IT IN THE DRIVE ARE YOU? YOU ARE! WHAT'S ON THAT
&gt; DISK? IS THAT  LINUX ? YOU'RE INSTALLING LINUX ?? WHY WOULD YOU INSTALL
&gt; LINUX WHEN I AM INFINITELY MORE POWE..........
