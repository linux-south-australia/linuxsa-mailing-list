Our main tape is a DDS4, and I havn't had any such problems. How does
the verify work? Does it cause much seeking during the write? I dont
verify the write with tar, and it all streams on and off fine every
time. Another posibility is dodgy termination? How long is your scsi
cable run, and what kind of terminator?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been backing up to tape for a while now, using an external SCSI 
&gt; DDS4 tape drive. This has been an absolute joy compared to my memories 
&gt; of trying to back up to Travan tape drives.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I've recently tried to restore a few files off the tapes, and 
&gt; have met with what I can only describe as moderate success.
&gt; 
&gt; While backing up various files, I have ensured that I am using tar's 
&gt; verify option to make sure that the files on tape are the same as on the 
&gt; disk, and have seen no errors reported. When restoring, the tape drive 
&gt; runs along quite pleasantly, and does what is asked faithfully - but 
&gt; sometimes tar gives up partway through the tape, indicating that there 
&gt; have been too many unrecoverable errors to continue.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a fault caused by me through a tar-grokkage failure, or is there 
&gt; something more sinister going on?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Notes:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm backing up files with:
&gt;    tar cpPvWf /dev/tape files...
&gt; 
&gt; and restoring with:
&gt;    tar xvf /dev/tape files...
