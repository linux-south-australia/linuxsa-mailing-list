Many years back, when we had an old VAX system with fan intake flow grills,
there was a fault which occurred that if anything blocked the grill, the VAX
would shutdown.

I was wearing a flowing dress and it kept blocking the grill and I brought
down the system four times before anyone realised what was causing the
problem.

I got grilled by the Tech Support Manager for an hour the next day.

	Hi all

	I was trying to get my sound card working without the speakers
plugged
	in, it took me a while to realise this. It wasn't 'til I saw the
plug
	poking out from under a piece of paper on my desk that I realised.

	&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi LinuxSA,
	&gt; &gt;&gt;
	&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd just like to let you all know that I'm stupid.
	&gt; &gt;&gt;
	&gt; &gt;&gt; And that by telling you all is penance.
	&gt; &gt;
	&gt; &gt; Well we all so stupid things...
	&gt; &gt;
	&gt; &gt; I remember a year back I had just started a new job and I
noticed that
	&gt; &gt; the previous joker they had for a sys admin wasn't doing
backups, so I
	&gt; &gt; wrote a tempory backup script, everything was to be backed up to
a
	&gt; &gt; directory before transfered to tape. Anyhow the script was in
perl and
	&gt; &gt; instead of using unlink to remove the old backup files I used
'system
	&gt; &gt; "/bin/rm -f $BACKUPDIR/*"', But my bigest mistake was a typo
when
	&gt; &gt; defining the $BACKUPDIR at the top of the script and the
$BACKUPDIR
	&gt; &gt; variable was left empty.
	&gt; &gt;
	&gt; &gt; Did I test this first? NO
	&gt; &gt; Did I run this on a production machine without testing? YES
	&gt; &gt;
	&gt; &gt; I'm just glad I used "rm -f" as I was going to use "rm -rf".
Would of
	&gt; &gt; made my first week at work interesting if I did...
	&gt; 
	&gt; Decades ago I was working on a Tandem machine with a rather
primitive
	&gt; shell.  When it encountered an error, it would just come out with
the
	&gt; number, so you needed to learn that ENOENT was "FILE SYSTEM ERROR
	&gt; 011".  People didn't like that, so I hacked the shell binary to
call a
	&gt; function which loaded an error message text from a file and
printed
	&gt; that instead.
	&gt; 
	&gt; That meant, of course, that I needed a utility to update the file,
	&gt; because plain text files hadn't been invented yet.  So I tested
this
	&gt; program, and for error 11 I wrote "File not found".  Then to test
it I
	&gt; changed the text, to (translated into UNIX) "Please enter 'rm -rf
*'".
	&gt; 
	&gt; I giggled about that for a while, and was just about ready to
change
	&gt; it back again, when our project manager came to me and said
	&gt; "Mr. Lehey, I think I've done something stupid".
	&gt; 
	&gt; Fortunately, it was early in the morning, and we did religious
backups
	&gt; every evening, so he really didn't lose very much.
