Hi all

I was trying to get my sound card working without the speakers plugged
in, it took me a while to realise this. It wasn't 'til I saw the plug
poking out from under a piece of paper on my desk that I realised.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi LinuxSA,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd just like to let you all know that I'm stupid.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; And that by telling you all is penance.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well we all so stupid things...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I remember a year back I had just started a new job and I noticed that
&gt; &gt; the previous joker they had for a sys admin wasn't doing backups, so I
&gt; &gt; wrote a tempory backup script, everything was to be backed up to a
&gt; &gt; directory before transfered to tape. Anyhow the script was in perl and
&gt; &gt; instead of using unlink to remove the old backup files I used 'system
&gt; &gt; "/bin/rm -f $BACKUPDIR/*"', But my bigest mistake was a typo when
&gt; &gt; defining the $BACKUPDIR at the top of the script and the $BACKUPDIR
&gt; &gt; variable was left empty.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Did I test this first? NO
&gt; &gt; Did I run this on a production machine without testing? YES
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm just glad I used "rm -f" as I was going to use "rm -rf".  Would of
&gt; &gt; made my first week at work interesting if I did...
&gt; 
&gt; Decades ago I was working on a Tandem machine with a rather primitive
&gt; shell.  When it encountered an error, it would just come out with the
&gt; number, so you needed to learn that ENOENT was "FILE SYSTEM ERROR
&gt; 011".  People didn't like that, so I hacked the shell binary to call a
&gt; function which loaded an error message text from a file and printed
&gt; that instead.
&gt; 
&gt; That meant, of course, that I needed a utility to update the file,
&gt; because plain text files hadn't been invented yet.  So I tested this
&gt; program, and for error 11 I wrote "File not found".  Then to test it I
&gt; changed the text, to (translated into UNIX) "Please enter 'rm -rf *'".
&gt; 
&gt; I giggled about that for a while, and was just about ready to change
&gt; it back again, when our project manager came to me and said
&gt; "Mr. Lehey, I think I've done something stupid".
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately, it was early in the morning, and we did religious backups
&gt; every evening, so he really didn't lose very much.
