Subject: VNC: some basic help please


&gt; I have just installed VCN ver 3.3.3r2 on my Redhat 7.2 box. I have
&gt; tested the server on the box and I can access programs OK from the
&gt; viewer (bash shell) locally.
&gt;
&gt; However, when I  try to access this system from a remote Windows web
&gt; browser using my dynamic IP address + port number I don't have any
&gt; success.

I assume you're connecting to your VNC session using a URL like
<A HREF="http://192.168.1.100:5801">http://192.168.1.100:5801</A> (HTTP, server's dynamic IP, 5800 + desktop
number).  If not, ensure that you specify all these components in your
brower's location bar.

Try telnetting to the host and port you expect the VNC session to be
on (for instance, "telnet 192.168.1.100 5801") and see what error
message you get.

Do you have any sort of firewalling or packet filtering enabled?  On a
standard Red Hat installation, many ports will be blocked meaning
these services can't be accessed from other machines.  I think the
easy way to check this out is to run "firewall-config" as superuser
(root).  If there are any filtering rules, the quick way to get your
VNC working would be to delete them all.

&gt; Could you please give me some detailed help on what I need to do to
get
&gt; it working, short of setting up DNS,  if this is possible.

If you're using dynamic IPs, I would strongly suggest using a DDNS
capable DHCP server with DNS.  It really makes things run more
smoothly.

As Peter pointed out, in some situations, using a "hosts" file would
help, but if you're using dynamic IP addressing, this is probably not
as useful as it might be.

You *might* also like to install Samba on your Red Hat Linux server,
and use NetBIOS/SMB for name resolution.  This doesn't work everywhere
that IP does, but it can be very useful if you just want a quick way
of setting up some sort of name resolution service.

Hope this helps
