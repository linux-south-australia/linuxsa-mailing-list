&gt; This is the overexcited newbie, James Leone.

Yes, I could tell you're an overexcited newbie -- but I can also tell
you're a newbie who wants to learn as opposed to continuously ask us
questions. And I'd hazard to say that you'll be answering questions in
no time as well.

&gt; This is the best Linux board on the net...and I don't know how you all
&gt; managed to get it this way, but I find it right priceless.

It's a mailing list actually. Backed up by a local user group who meet
in person. We have a lot of members not all from our local area. It's a
very good user group and the reason is that it is full of life and
people actually care about it. 

&gt; Although I do not precribe to this school of thought in computing, I hope
&gt; that the effect of this exchange does not
&gt; impact the greatness of this board in any way.

I assure you that it will not; I'm not about to let LinuxSA get saddled
with such a restrictive set of precepts.

&gt; Thanks for tolerating and letting me participate even though I am not nearly
&gt; up to par.

*sigh*

Do you know a really good way to learn? It's to teach. Therefore, if you
happen to see a posting that you think you can answer -- even if not
fully -- then have a go at answering it. No doubt someone will see a
mistake in your answer (for example when I started waffling about C and
pointers and Richard Sharpe, who seems to constantly pick mistakes in my
C programming damn him, picked my mistakes) but in not answering you
wouldn't have learned (been reminded) of the errors you make.
