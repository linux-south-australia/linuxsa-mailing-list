Hi all,

I have a similar config pppd & mgetty and I found that w does show both the
a_ppp and the users referenced to that dial up..

16:48:55 root ~ &gt; w
  4:49pm  up 56 days,  1:02,  4 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.03, 0.01
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT
a_ppp    ttyS0    38400             4:49pm  3.00s  0.06s   ?     -
nick     ttyS0    ppp00             4:49pm  3.00s  0.06s   ?     -

I did find also that a;
grep pppd /var/log/messages | grep user

Apr 14 15:54:09 station pppd[27539]: user c-grind logged in
Apr 16 11:22:33 station pppd[32026]: user c-grind logged in
Apr 16 19:23:28 station pppd[421]: user c-grind logged in
Apr 17 09:59:20 station pppd[2014]: user nick logged in
Apr 17 12:53:48 station pppd[2342]: user c-grind logged in
Apr 17 16:49:36 station pppd[2780]: user nick logged in

shows the user who connected at what time - but doesnt say who is currently
connected

a;
16:51:59 root ~ &gt; grep pppd /var/log/messages | grep "Connection terminated"
Apr 14 16:13:28 station pppd[27539]: Connection terminated.
Apr 16 11:24:09 station pppd[32026]: Connection terminated.
Apr 16 19:25:27 station pppd[421]: Connection terminated.
Apr 17 10:00:21 station pppd[2014]: Connection terminated.
Apr 17 12:55:22 station pppd[2342]: Connection terminated.
Apr 17 16:51:03 station pppd[2780]: Connection terminated.

shows disconnected times

but it is strange that w doesnt show the user and mine does..
how is your pppd configured? maybe there is something in there to say
display it like that??

Subject: RE: who is dialed up? pppd server


&gt; Hmm,
&gt; Still no luck, anybody else got any ideas?  i can cat /var/log/messages
and
&gt; see who has logged in and out in the past nicely, but w or who doesn't
show
&gt; anything.  very sad....
&gt;
&gt; i might mention that i'm using the mgetty that is on netcrafts site as the
&gt; latest rpm with redhat has a problem or two and netcraft so kindly pointed
&gt; me to their compiled one.
&gt;
&gt; sounds like i might have to investigate portslave/radius setup, but it
seems
&gt; a bit of an over kill for our 7 modems.
&gt;
&gt; anyway, thanks all for replying before, gave me a lot to work with...
&gt; thanks
&gt; Matthew

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ah. i do recall something like that.  i followed the 'Pocket ISP' howto
from
&gt; memory but i've played around with it a bit to get stuff going
&gt; my login.config reads:
&gt; --------line that counts-----
&gt; /AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth +chap +pap login debug
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; -----------full file-----------
&gt; # login.config
&gt; #
&gt; # This is a sample "login dispatcher" configuration file for mgetty
&gt; #
&gt; # Format:
&gt; #       username userid utmp_entry login_program [arguments]
&gt; #
&gt; # Meaning:
&gt; #       for a "username" entered at mgettys login: prompt, call
&gt; #       "login_program" with [arguments], with the uid set to "userid",
&gt; #       and a USER_PROCESS utmp entry with ut_user = "utmp_entry"
&gt; #
&gt; # username may be prefixed / suffixed by "*" (wildcard)
&gt; #
&gt; # userid is a valid user name from /etc/passwd, or "-" to not set
&gt; #  a login user id and keep the uid/euid root (needed for /bin/login)
&gt; #
&gt; # utmp_entry is what will appear in the "who" listing. Use "-" to not
&gt; #  set an utmp entry (a must for /bin/login), use "@" to set it to the
&gt; #  username entered. Maximum length is 8 characters.
&gt; #
&gt; # login_program is the program that will be exec()ed, with the arguments
&gt; #  passed in [arguments]. A "@" in the arguments will be replaced with the
&gt; #  username entered. Warning: if no "@" is given, the login_program has
&gt; #  no way to know what user name the user entered.
&gt; #
&gt; #
&gt; # SAMPLES:
&gt; # Use this one with my Taylor-UUCP and Taylor-UUCP passwd files.
&gt; #  (Big advantage: tuucp can use the same passwd file for serial dial-in
&gt; #   and tcp dial-in [uucico running as in.uucpd]). Works from 1.05 up.
&gt; #
&gt; #U*     uucp    @       /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -l -u @
&gt;
&gt; #
&gt; # Use this one for fido calls (login name /FIDO/ is handled specially)
&gt; #
&gt; # You need Eugene Crosser's "ifmail" package for this to work.
&gt; #  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DFIDO", otherwise a fido call won't
&gt; #  be detected.
&gt; #
&gt; #/FIDO/ uucp    fido    /usr/local/lib/fnet/ifcico @
&gt;
&gt; #
&gt; # Automatic PPP startup on receipt of LCP configure request (AutoPPP).
&gt; #  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DAUTO_PPP" for this to work.
&gt; #  Warning: Case is significant, AUTOPPP or autoppp won't work!
&gt; #  Consult the "pppd" man page to find pppd options that work for you.
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE: for *some* users, the "-detach" option has been necessary, for
&gt; #        others, not at all. If your pppd doesn't die after hangup, try
it.
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE2: "debug" creates lots of debugging info.  LOOK AT IT if things
&gt; #         do not work out of the box, most likely it's a ppp problem!
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE3: "man pppd" is your friend!
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE4: max. 9 arguments allowed.
&gt; #
&gt; /AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth +chap +pap login debug
&gt;
&gt; #
&gt; #
&gt; # An example where no login name in the argument list is desired:
&gt; #  automatically telnetting to machine "smarty" for a given login name
&gt; #
&gt; #telnet-smarty  gast    telnet  /usr/bin/telnet -8 smarty
&gt; #
&gt; # This is the "standard" behaviour - *dont* set a userid or utmp
&gt; #  entry here, otherwise /bin/login will fail!
&gt; #  This entry isn't really necessary: if it's missing, the built-in
&gt; #  default will do exactly this.
&gt; #
&gt; #*      -       -       /bin/login @
&gt; #/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd
