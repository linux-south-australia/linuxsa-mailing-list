The only thing I have to say in defence of internal modems (and I'll admit 
it is the _only_ thing) is that most modems are let down by the power 
supplies.

In my experience, unreliable modems are often unreliable because the 
plugpacks they plug into are crap.  Not quite enough juice often leads to 
drop outs etc.  The most reliable modems often seemed to have the better 
power supplies (this is not universally true).

The benefit of an internal modem is that it has a connection to a decent 
power supply.

I used an internal no-name brand Rockwell chipset internal modem for my 
permanent BigPond link for several years.  It _averaged_ 2 weeks per call.

Personally I think modems are like printers (and other paper shredding 
devices such as photocopiers and faxes) are evil.   I still have Netcomm 
Prorack nightmares in my sleep.

&gt; Hi Peter,
&gt; Internal modems are neat & tidy, but unless you understand IRQs, I/O
&gt; addresses etc, you will have problems configuring them.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing to keep in mind is the modem is the weak-link in the
&gt; lightning chain.
&gt; In the event your telephone line gets hit by lightning, it will
&gt; probably take-out your modem. Now if you are using an internal modem,
&gt; it will probably take-out your computer too :)
&gt; 
&gt; Without exception, (& I know what I'm doing), I've never had a "plug it
&gt; in & it goes" experience with internal modems, hell, I've got one in my
&gt; SmoothWall firewall now, that I can't seem to get to work, & its a
&gt; Supra-Express, which is good one.
&gt; 
&gt; I've always been able to get them to work, but only with much fiddling.
&gt; Now the above problem is not a lack of good design on the modem.
&gt; 
&gt; The Lucent ***VENUS***CHIPSET*** internal modems are a real modems that
&gt; have a COM port, albeit with a PCI IRQ & I/O address.
&gt; Any other Lucent modem is a WinModem & whilst there is some support for
&gt; Linux, get a life & an external modem :)
&gt; 
&gt; As Nathan mentioned, internal or external, the real difference between
&gt; modems is in their ability to work on poor quality phone lines &
&gt; compatability with what they will dial-in to.
&gt; 
&gt; You can get a reasonable external modem for about AUS $85, fine if you
&gt; have good quality phone lines. If you live in the country or are in an
&gt; old suburb where the phone line wiring is old, perhaps keep your hair,
&gt; & by the Swann.

&gt; &gt;The SwannSmart modem in my opinion performs excellently on all line
&gt; &gt;conditions and because it is external works with all versions of Linux.
&gt; &gt;If you really want to get an internal and still want a SwannSmart II
&gt; &gt;be careful which one you choose as there is one based on a Conexent
&gt; &gt;chipset
&gt; &gt;and one based on a Lucent chipset. I'm not really sure but I assume the
&gt; &gt;Lucent
&gt; &gt;may be a winmodem which will not work with Linux.
