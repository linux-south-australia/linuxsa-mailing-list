&gt;&gt; Tonight AUUG(SA) signed some GPG/PGP keys.  It was fun.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, AUUG-SA did no such thing. We invited people to come along and
&gt; state their case for their identity. Some people -- most notably Greg
&gt; Lehey -- had technical issues with proof of their identity.
&gt; Specifically, although everyone could verify that Greg the human was
&gt; actually Greg, Greg asked us to compare the key he had provided to
&gt; Andrew Rutherford to print with a key archived by Michael Davies (i.e. you).
&gt;
&gt; It is possible that the keys were the same but the hashing algorithm was
&gt; difficult. Noone could blame members present in not "trusting" such a
&gt; key because in security the maxim should be ultra-paranoide.

Well, no, you're missing a couple of things.  First, Michael looked at
a fingerprint in my mail headers, and it seems it was an old one.  I
hadn't updated the headers after creating a new key.

&gt; This means, it was nothing personal about Greg in and of
&gt; itself. Just that Greg couldn't produce independent, and technically
&gt; undisputable to the layperson proof that the keys were different.

People seemed to completely ignore the fact that Daniel O'Connor had
my complete key on his laptop, and he confirmed that the fingerprints
matched.
