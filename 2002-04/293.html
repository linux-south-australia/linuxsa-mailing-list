Hi all,

Got an ugly problem. Have two servers, K and T, on a LAN that's not
connected to the internet. T was YP and NIS primary, but now K is.
However, K depends on T for an NFS mount (that as far as I can tell,
isn't essential, and will get shifted to K eventually anyway).

Anyway, I'm having a whole bunch of problems that I can't begin to think
how to track down. Unfortunately, I'm recalling them from memory here,
and I've not slept since this time yesterday, so E&OE...

Firstly, when booting, both machines take ages. Specifically, K seems to
start ypserv, then spews a whole lot of stuff about RPC not receiving
Errorno = Success or something like that. Then, when it starts ypbind,
these errors go away. T is slow on a few irrelevant things, but has the
same problems as K as well -- but only when K is up first. If I start T,
and wait a while, then K only complains between ypserv and ypbind. If I
start K first, then both spew heaps of RPC errors, and -- here's the
weirdest part -- K will only respond to pings every 4 seconds. I get no
packet loss, but have seen delays of well over one minute. When T
finally comes up, all the ping packets come at once. Also, T takes
forever to bind, though it's using broadcat to itself. . .

In case you're wondering about the vagueness -- the machines are not
accessible at the same time as the net, and my brian doesn't function
while I type... or something like that.

Additionally, I can't seem to make passwords update properly -- I
supected I should just be able to use ypwasswd (or evern passwd) and all
should be swell... Is this approximatley correct...

Sigh -- the joys of working in a legacy environment:)

PS I'll send a better explanation, hopefully with some screenshots.
