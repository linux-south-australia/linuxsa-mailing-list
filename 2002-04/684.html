Hmmmm.....

&gt; I am fairly confident that people starting with linux do not know
&gt; everything about it. New users should be encouraged not abused.

Well I got "Body Life" back for my efforts at bombing Steve Nicholls. I
found it extraordinarily amusing and I think my response was both
succinct, to the point and also spoke within the same context as his
message. Someteimes, Shaun, these damned newbies fight back!

&gt; Someone trying to unsubscribe the wrong way is not an idiot. They are
&gt; here looking for information, likely get turned away because of the
&gt; David* responses and then try to leave.

Ahem...they wanted to unsubscribe anyway. I gave them said information.

&gt; If I was one of the top 20 elite members of this list, I may well think
&gt; the same way. I have probably introduced more people to Linux than most
&gt; on this list, it is a shame that I must tell them not to post here, as
&gt; they will be abused.

It's a pity you can't work out how to work with this list. There are so
many new users who receive valid, useful responses from me and every
other member of this list. There is so much more to LinuxSA than simply
helping people with Linux problems. We are a community. I am part of
that community and no community member has one particular role. You
dislike the role I have undertaken, and I support your right to do so.

But though I, too, will defend your right to say your beliefs and
thoughts on this list, I shall not be silenced by your beliefs, nor your
thoughts for as long as I am part of this community.

And I'm not about to get into a little boy pissing contest about who has
introduced more people to Linux than whom...it's not worth it and am I
really the enemy?

;-P
