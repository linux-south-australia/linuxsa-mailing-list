Hi.

I went through this a little while ago when I was asked to duplicate a tape 
for a couple of people. I only have one dolby cassette deck (the 4 track is 
DBX), so I decided to import the sound into .wav and create an audio CD out 
of it.

I scoured freshmeat and landed up with khdrecord:

The program reads audio data from the souncdard (dev/dsp) and stores them
to disk. You can have continued recording like a tape recorder. The 
limitation
is only your harddisk. As an option you can only encode the audio data into
mp3, which reduces the data size to a tenth. For MP3 encoding you should
have at least a CPU with more than 300 MHz.
(from the readme)

Recorded the sound as stereo, then downgraded to mono (it was a 'talk' 
cassette)

I had a lot of trouble getting adequate volume on the input. In the end, I 
dragged the stereo amp up, and hooked the pre-out to the soundcard. I also 
increased the volume in the wav file using sox:

sox -v volume Change amplitude (floating point); less than 1.0 decreases, 
greater than 1.0 increases.

I'd be real hesitant in hooking the speaker outs into your soundcard, I 
think you could easily fry things in the soundcard. Even if it doesn't 
there is a risk of overdriving the input which will result in crappy sound.

Burned the resulting 2 files (one per cassette side) to audio CD - worked a 
treat! Quality was not distinguishable from the cassette, which is a low-fi 
source anyhow. I experimented in using lame to mp3 encode the files, and 
found that I could knock the original stereo wav file down from ~320mb to 
about 14mb by downsampling to 64 kBits, 44.1 kHz, Mono. Still very 
listenable at that.

If you search on freshmeat, I'm sure I saw audio recording software with 
scratch filters etc, designed for recording from LP.

&gt; Thanks DSL and all who have replied so far.
&gt;
&gt; I am now running an input line from speaker outputs for speaker set B
&gt; (hey, in  the '70s when this amp was made, this was hi-fi at its best!)
&gt; into line in on  the soundcard. Command line now looks like this:
&gt; sox -c 2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track&lt;nn&gt;.wav
&gt;
&gt; I am manually breaking the recording at each track, CTL-C , up arrow,
&gt; change  nn=&gt;nn+1, RTN
&gt;
&gt; It's coming out of the PC speakers at a reasonable quality level for what
&gt; they  are. Test burn #0001 later today. This, for me, is outstanding
&gt; progress. I  bought the CD burner for my wife for Xmas, so she could do
&gt; this stuff, and  today is the first day of actually attempting to cut
&gt; tracks.
