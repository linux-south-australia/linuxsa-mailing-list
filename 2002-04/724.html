&gt; does anyone have any experience with openLDAP? i'm after opinions on
&gt; it's reliability, ease of use, ease of administration, or any general

&gt; {proprietary|open-source} solutions (that run on linux, of course)?

I've used it for two places I've worked at, and run it at home as well. 
The first was an ISP with 5,000+ customers - it provided UNIX directory 
services (similar to YP/NIS) for the ISP's servers, so it was it hit 
everytime someone logged in, or recieved an email, which was quite 
frequently.

The place I'm working for at the moment also uses it for workstation and 
server directory services, as well as addressbook autocompletion, etc. 
For the approx 20 people working here, it performs fine.

Apparently, v1.x has serious performance issues with ACLs, but v2.x 
appears to be better. It is certainly fast enough now for the above two 
installations.

Setting it up is arcane (even on Debian) - make sure you read the quick 
start guide &lt;<A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin/quickstart.html&gt">http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin/quickstart.html&gt</A>;. You 
should be prepared to do start from scratch a few times when designing 
the database's structure and schema, becuase you will probably get it 
wrong at first if you're not already familiar with LDAP or X500. Spend 
generous amounts of time on this, you want to get it right.

The only included administration tools are the CLI programs that come 
with it. You'll need a third-party tool for graphical administration, I 
use GQ, Directory Administrator and LDAPExplorer at various times, as 
well as custom built web interfaces. A custom or customized interface is 
the best answer for long term use and maintenance.

Apparently the Netscape Directory server was quite good, usually better, 
in terms of performance and administration, but I'm not sure about the 
latest iPlanet offerings.

OpenLDAP may or may not be enterprise-ready, but will suffice for 
typical Adelaide-sized installations.. ;)

HTH,
Mike.
