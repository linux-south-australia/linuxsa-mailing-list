Hi,

Thanks for your reply.

As suggested, I installed nmap, and ran "nmap 192.168.255.4"  from an internal
machine.
I got the following:

    All 1554 scanned ports on (192.168.255.4) are: filtered.

Can you please suggest what else I can do?

Thanks.

Damar

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; As for the internal network com issue, why not try nmap (once installed) and
&gt; check to see if telnet/ssh ports are even open: -note, do this from an
&gt; internal machine.
&gt;
&gt; nmap 192.168.1.1
&gt;
&gt; This tests for open ports on the target machine. They will come up as
&gt; "filtered" if ipchains/iptables is filtering that port. ie, letting eth0 in
&gt; but not eth1 (assuming that eth0 is leading to the ADSL modem)
&gt;
&gt; This may help.

&gt; Subject: Telnetting and sshd--ing from the internal network and Compaq
&gt; Presario 4712
&gt;
&gt; Hello to all,
&gt;
&gt; I have two problems:
&gt;
&gt; First Part:  It is about Compaq Presario 4712.  Recently, I got this old
&gt; machine without a harddrive. I had one spare harddrive of 8GB, which I have
&gt; used for this machine now.  Every time, I start the machine, I get
&gt; "disk-1790 error 0"  message, and I have to press F1 to continue.  When I
&gt; checked the website of compaq, it is due to the incompatibility of
&gt; harddrive, and they also offer a software utility, but only for Window
&gt; platform (Iam using RH7.1). According to the information provided, it is due
&gt; to the size of the harddrive too large for the machine.  Has any one in the
&gt; group encoutered this? and any solution, particularly for Linux?
&gt;
&gt; Second Part:  My second part is about the problem of telnetting, sshd -ing,
&gt; even web browsing from the internal network to Linux RH7.1 server (one
&gt; described above).  The server has two network interfaces, one connected to
&gt; the Internet with ADSL modem, and the other to the internal network.Only
&gt; thing I can do from the internal network clients to the server is ping, but
&gt; I can not telenet or sshd to the server. Telneting is working, when I try
&gt; from the Internet.  So, it seems services offered by the server is
&gt; available, and is working, but somehow these services may have been denied
&gt; to the internal network.
&gt;
&gt; I would appreciate, should any one in the group can point me to the right
&gt; direction, please.
&gt;
&gt; By the way, there is no entry in /etc/host.allow and /etc/host.deny .
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Damar
