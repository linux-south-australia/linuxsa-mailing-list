 &gt; Subject: IDE geometry detection & getting to BIOS
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Hi all,
 &gt; 
 &gt; Some time ago, I had an issue where a freeBSD box wouldn't 
 &gt; auto-detect
 &gt; two identical drives as being the same geometry. Well, it's 
 &gt; happenning
 &gt; again, but this time, I think I know what's causing it... 
 &gt; The drives, in
 &gt; this case, are on separate IDE channels, both as slaves. On 
 &gt; the primary
 &gt; channel, the master is an older (ATA66 or ATA33) HDD, and on the
 &gt; secondary channel, the master is a CDROM drive. The one on 
 &gt; the secondary
 &gt; is being detected with a massively reduced number of cylinders, which
 &gt; ends up restricting the capacity to about 6G (should be 
 &gt; ~40G). The one
 &gt; on the primary gets detected with heaps more cylinders, and 
 &gt; a filesystem
 &gt; there has 35G capacity (which I assume is about right, given HDD
 &gt; manufacturer's interpretation of powers of 2, and filesystem 
 &gt; overhead).
 &gt; This is approximately the same as I experienced on the 
 &gt; FreeBSD machine,
 &gt; though I seem to recall it detecting the correct size, but wrong
 &gt; geometry in that case (it was a newer machine, and a newer HDD).
 &gt; 
 &gt; Anyway, does anyone know (or have a reference that can tell me) what
 &gt; kind of interference one can get on IDE channels? for eg, I'm pretty
 &gt; sure that the fact that I'm mixing an ATA33 and an ATA100 drive on an
 &gt; ATA33 channel shouldn't matter (though the ATA100 drive will 
 &gt; just run at
 &gt; ATA33 speed, right?)... I'm using an ATA66 80-core ribbon... Then
 &gt; there's the whole variety of PIO and UDMA modes and so on... 
 &gt; I'd really
 &gt; like to know what I should be seeing on this machine given the
 &gt; combination of IDE devices...
 &gt; 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also, on a related note, I can't figure out how to get into 
 &gt; the BIOS of
 &gt; this machine. It's made by "LODIN", and comes up with a big splash
 &gt; screen when you'd normally see BIOS, and I can't figure how 
 &gt; to actually
 &gt; access the BIOS -- I've tried del, esc, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f12, and
 &gt; f10, along with b, space, ctl-break, break, and others (I got bored
 &gt; after a while)... Anyone got any other ideas, or has used a similar
 &gt; LODIN machine before and know the trick?
 &gt; 
 &gt; TIA
