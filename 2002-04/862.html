Well, I havnt done it but hopefully I can give you some pointers. The
accton pcmcia cards (at least that I have seen) are like almost all of
the cards of brands that dont/cant make their own chipset and use the
intel i82365 chipset. That should be the main bit of info you need. 

Presumably you'll need to make the network install boot disk, tell it
what card you have and either tell it to get an IP via DHCP if you have
a DHCP server, or else manually assign an IP. Under linux this is all
done via the text mode installer that you get when you boot the network
install boot disk. I doubt you'd need to modify any conf files before
the system is installed. I havn't tryed this with bsd (this is linuxsa,
after all :). Of course you'll need an ftp server with the installation
files from the cd on it, and you'll need to point the installer at it.
One you have the network card going though, it should all be straight
forward enough. If its not, use linux! :) &lt;/troll&gt;

&gt; Hi team...  I'm quietly hoping that someone will have the time, inclination,
&gt; and expertise to help me out with this.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently acquired an old Compaq Armada notebook (Pentium 100), and I
&gt; figured the most useful thing I could do with it is to use it as a little
&gt; Postgres server.  I've got FreeBSD 4.5, so I thought what I'd do was install
&gt; that on it, with only the Postgres packages (i.e. don't need X or anything
&gt; on it), and that would be roughly feasible (providing I don't make any of my
&gt; databases too big, cos after all it's only got an 800m HDD...!)
&gt; 
&gt; The bit I'm not sure about is this - from what I can gather, I need to do an
&gt; installation from my FTP server, because this notebook has no CD Rom.
&gt; However I can't find any literature that suggests whether or not the BSD
&gt; Installation Boot Disk(s) will support my Accton PCMCIA card (because that's
&gt; the only means of connectivity I've got...!).
&gt; 
&gt; The BSD documentation suggests that the card is supported, but I don't
&gt; particularly know enough about tooling around with this stuff to figure out
&gt; how to get it to talk...  I guess I'd have to modify some sort of .conf file
&gt; on the boot floppy, and copy a driver across or something ?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone out there got any experience in doing an installation in this
&gt; manner, or confirm that it's a WOFTAM ?
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I ask is that I didn't get any disks or anything with it, and
&gt; whilst I'd go for the trial-and-error approach, I fear that if I screw this
&gt; BSD install up then I may not be able to get Windoze back on it either (for
&gt; similar reasons as above).
&gt; 
&gt; Helpful responses gladly accepted, on or off list !
&gt; 
&gt; Jason =)
