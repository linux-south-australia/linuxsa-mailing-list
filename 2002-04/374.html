Firstly, your "use" of the English language is horrendous.

In everyday conversational email, you might be able to get away with it, but
in a promotional/advertisement context, its just wrong.
"Porgrammers with student models experience"??
For all we can tell, you want someone who's been doing modelling for David
Jones on the side to supplement their austudy.

Also, and this is the main problem we have, your email was clearly
unsolicited advertising material for something *YOU KNEW* was off topic!
(You had "out of topic" in the subject)

So, you already knew we didn't want it. You knew the list was linuxSA (South
Australia), not LinuxUSA.

And then, just to put the icing on the cake of our vitriol, you asked if
anyone was interested in helping you spam more people in the name of
"internet marketing".

By the way, if you're genuinely interested in recruiting people, why would
you have a yahoo! email address? You're obviously not a serious player here,
but probably just looking to harvest some more email addresses for your
"internet marketing company" to spam.
