Hi.

Well, sounds like you are persisting with connecting your speaker-outs to 
the soundcard input? Have you tried connecting the tape-out? I think you 
need to. Even if the volume sounds low, you can increase it with sox if you 
need to. The key here is to keep the levels low so you don't overdrive the 
inputs on the soundcard. You will need some noise filtering though, LP's 
are noisy at the best of times, and that noise will be recorded on your 
CD's for posterity!

Don't worry about the file sizes. Remember the cd is 600+mb

To minimise distortion, you want to keep the levels on the amp as low as 
you can. Any circuit on the amp or soundcard that gets overdriven will 
introduce distortion. That said however, I'd run the gain on the amp up in 
preference to the soundcard mixer, and I'd be looking at keeping everything 
low (nothing above 50%) try various combinations until you find the best 
sound with the gear you have.

You can bet that the amp is a better link in the chain than the soundcard, 
so try to set the levels accordingly.

Might be worth having a look at the alt.audio.* newsgroups, I'm sure you 
will find a FAQ on this subject. Google is great for this, just type your 
search and click the 'Groups' tab.

Regards,

Michael

&gt;&gt; Can I just say that if you are serious about getting good quality, dont
&gt;&gt; use an internal soundcard. They really blow.  Do some research into
&gt;&gt; external devices that will do the AD for you.  I have seen some USB
&gt;&gt; units that look interesting.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; [snip lots of very good advice]
&gt;
&gt;&gt; have fun!
&gt;
&gt; Doing that!
&gt;
&gt; Last night I got a set of headphones out of the shed. Been there for
&gt; about 20  years. Cut the plug off and soldered it into the cable to the
&gt; sound card.  Tried a quick cut of mono from the radio, nice signal
&gt; considering the source.
&gt;
&gt; This morning I am trying a cut of a classical record. Eugenia Zukerman -
&gt; flute  concertos by Bach, Stamitz and Vivaldi. This should be an
&gt; interesting  experiment. Running the Denon direct drive turntable now,
&gt; with a good  cartridge. Haven't bought a good record cleaner yet. The
&gt; size of the WAV  files is bloody huge - average about 75 Mb, 8 tracks on
&gt; the album!
&gt;
&gt; Despite the good advice about not using internal sound cards, I will
&gt; continue  to use the one I have. The aim is to get a reasonable facsimile
&gt; of the  turntable-in-the-lounge-room sound, and if I can get the current
&gt; quality  signal minus rattle, hum, spit and pop, and with no audible
&gt; distortion  introduced by this process, it will do nicely. Speaking of
&gt; distortion, are  there any tips about minimising this, as far output
&gt; signal level goes? In  other words, where should I have the volume on the
&gt; amp set? Feel free to  wield the clue stick mightily here, I don't have
&gt; much idea, I am flying in  fog as far as this goes.
&gt;
&gt; I am walking this process up, one step at a time. I have not yet
&gt; introduced  any noise filters. That comes next. I am still using sox on
&gt; the command line  and manually breaking at each track. I have started to
&gt; have a look at GPL  sound mixer/filter programs, and will report on list
&gt; any further developments  unless you all think this is too off-topic for
&gt; this list. I am looking at a  prog called 'audacity' as a front end. The
&gt; ultimate aim is to get enough  automation into the process, and a good
&gt; enough signal, to be able to turn  someone loose on the record collection
&gt; a disk at a time a day at a time, to  gradually convert a thirty year
&gt; collection of vinyl to CD. It must be an  enjoyable experience for a
&gt; non-tech person so she doesn't get disheartened.  It must add quality to
&gt; a day, both in the creating of the resource and in the  use of the end
&gt; product.
&gt;
&gt; I am glad I am using my M$-free PC to do this, there is no temptation to
&gt; soil  the linen and jump into Windoze to try things out. I am using
&gt; XCDRoast to  burn the CDs, works a treat! Isn't OS software a wondrous
&gt; thing?
&gt;
&gt; I have already learned lots thanks to the list. If anyone wants a hand to
&gt; set  up a cheap home-brew system to do similar, please let me know if you
&gt; want a  hand. Remember though, it's home brew quality here, not studio.
&gt;
&gt; The Eugenia Zukerman CD is in the player now. There is no distortion,
&gt; well, no  clipping off the top end. It is a bit 'wooly' sounding, a bit
&gt; muffled. This  degradation is not too far off acceptable though, I am on
&gt; the right track.  The mix needs a bit of a stir. I will play with the amp
&gt; a bit. Of course it  could be the cumulative signal degradation from
&gt; vinyl through 70s turntable  through 70s amp through cheap sound card
&gt; through CD burner through cheap 90s  amp to good speakers is just too big
&gt; an ask to get much better than this.  Hmm. Jake could be right.
