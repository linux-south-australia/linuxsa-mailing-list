Michael,
WRT to your problem, I assume the when you ask it to drop the connection 
that the pppd actually dies?

(ie. "ps -ef | grep pppd" shows nothing?)

Given that Internode effectively use the same Telstra infrastructure to 
provide PPPoE connections for residential, I don't quite see how it could
be an Internode problem.

Are the any problems actually starting a connection?  I'm very curious as to 
what happens if you try a command line connect.

&gt; Why go out and buy bread when you can grow some Wheat, Crush it and make

&gt; 
&gt; Products like Smoothwall are very easy to set up and it spreads knowledge of
&gt; Linux. Surely this is a good thing. I've got 3 friends with Telstra Cable
&gt; who would NEVER EVER have had anything to do with Linux if it wasn't for
&gt; Smoothwall. Whilst they primarily don't do too much else at least they know
&gt; Linux exists now and runs on "obsolete hardware" and does a bloody good job
&gt; of protecting their Internal Windows Network.
&gt; 
&gt; My own Smoothwall box has worked flawlessly for 12 months on Telstra ADSL
&gt; and the problem I'm having now that I've gone to Internode is annoying but
&gt; minor. The "Problem" has to be something that has occurred as a result of
&gt; going to Internode and I'd like to think that a solution can be found rather
&gt; than saying " Don't use Smoothwall "
&gt; 
&gt; and Yes..I have contacted both Simon, Internode Helpdesk and Smoothwall IRC
&gt; support and thus far no-one has any answers. I was hoping that one of the
&gt; "so called gurus" that frequent this mailing list might have some
&gt; constructive suggestions on finding what the problem is.
&gt; 
&gt; I really don't cherish the thought of advising prospective ADSL users that
&gt; they should have a Firewall setup, but you must either
&gt; 
&gt;    a) Learn how to set up and secure FreeBSD/Debian/Other linux from scratch
&gt; or b) Install WinRoute or similar

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The answer, Evan, is to install Debian/FreeBSD or whatever
&gt; &gt; and configure
&gt; &gt; it yourself ;-)
