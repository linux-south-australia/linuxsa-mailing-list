I think I pressed the wrong button again.

&gt; &gt; Just a couple of positive points about these machines from 
&gt; &gt; some1 who works with them (Just over 60 SunBlade100s with 
&gt; &gt; SunPCI cards running Win98se).
&gt; 
&gt; hmm... fair enough (did you want to send this to the list, or just to
&gt; me...?)
&gt; 

It was meant for the list, I click the wrong button (I am to quick and
efficient for my own good.). This mail is going to the list however.(My
original post is at the bottom).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Points:
&gt; &gt; - Exactly the same desktop environment as our SunRay labs.
&gt; 
&gt; unless you run RedHat on them, as the original poster wanted to...

Of course, but I was only giving a list of positive things that I can
think of. Not necessarily important to the original query. :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Can export directory trees from Solaris into the SunPCI 
&gt; &gt; Windows environment (In other words users can access their 
&gt; &gt; home dir from both environments at the same time on the same
machine).
&gt; 
&gt; I imagine that this is using either NFS or SMB, which is no different
to
&gt; normal PC/UNIX connectivity -- except that it's all within the one
&gt; physical box, there's little difference here between this and having a
&gt; PC with an XServer.

Its not through networking as far as I can tell, for instance you can
access a drivers directory from a basic DOS drive (Just boot files).But
I have to say I havent read enough of the documentation but my belief is
that its emulating a  drive to the OS (Not to the BIOS, as our systems
boot the Windows image will out having any drives set in the BIOS).

An example is that to install Windows, you create a basic drive through
the software (It includes DOS boot files). Once thats created, you boot
it and then (Without using MSCDEX drivers), access setup.exe thru an
emulated drive.

Of course, this could mean that the version of DOS (Caldera OpenDOS
7.01), could be hacked aswell.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Easily setup cron scheduled backups/restores of the Windows 
&gt; &gt; environment on the local machine (No need to multicast etc 
&gt; &gt; from a central server image).
&gt; 
&gt; nice...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - SunPCI cards have their own USB ports etc. which allows 
&gt; &gt; native use through Windows, unlike software emulation under 
&gt; &gt; something like VMWare.
&gt; 
&gt; does that mean that you don't share the same keyboard and monitor?

You do use the same.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - SunPCI cards can either use the SunBlade's NIC or their own 
&gt; &gt; built in. As well as export their display to an external 
&gt; &gt; monitor if needed.
&gt; 
&gt; nice
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - A SunPCI card does not share its RAM with the SunBlade and 
&gt; &gt; does its processing independantly (Unlike VMWare..)
&gt; 
&gt; true, but not that many people really need to use both architectures
at
&gt; once -- they switch from one to the other... maybe yours don't, but
mine
&gt; do :)

True :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for using RedHat with the SunPCI cards, I can't see it 
&gt; &gt; happening. Sun has created special drivers under Solaris to 
&gt; &gt; take care of interfacing between the two systems, unless 
&gt; &gt; some1 reverse engineers them, I don't like your chances. 
&gt; 
&gt; yeah -- though this in particular, may be of relevance to the original
&gt; poster and/or the list...
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, I'm really interested as to why you would want to do 
&gt; &gt; most of the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; things you seem to want to do here. I'm not being rude, I'm 
&gt; &gt; honestly 
&gt; &gt; &gt; interested...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some friends of mine are trialing a couple of SunBlade 100s
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at work. Rather than use Solaris 8 they would like to use 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, fair enough.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Redhat for Sparc. This is because the users in the area in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which they wish to deploy them already have Linux knowledge 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but none with Solaris.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK -- for a start, I'm slightly confused as to why you 
&gt; &gt; would want to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; use low-end sparc machines, which are not good value in the 
&gt; &gt; scheme of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; things (unless performance is simply not an issue, and 
&gt; &gt; funky looking 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hardware, or non-intel hardware, is a bonus, in which case, they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably aren't too bad...). Unless, of course, you wanted to run 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Solaris on them, in which case, yes, they are a good, cheap
Solaris 
&gt; &gt; &gt; platform... but for Linux, they simply aren't great value or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; performance, and I would be willing to bet, will give you 
&gt; &gt; no advantage 
&gt; &gt; &gt; over intel hardware, and possibly some disadvantages...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ... and the difference between Solaris and Linux is not _that_
much 
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyway... if they're generally computer literate, it should 
&gt; &gt; be an easy 
&gt; &gt; &gt; transition to use Solaris... Depends who they are and what they
are 
&gt; &gt; &gt; doing, I guess.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is they also want to use a SunPCi II 2.2.2 card
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in each machine. The card is a 64bit PCI card that is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; essentially a computer in itself. It has an Pentium III 800, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; graphics, network, sound etc all one the one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; card. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, this is where it gets really confusing for me. Why? Are they 
&gt; &gt; &gt; planning to run Windows on it? Seems an awfully convoluted 
&gt; &gt; solution to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; get Windows running within a Linux box -- why not go for 
&gt; &gt; intel linux 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and vmware or wine or citrix, or any number of other more 
&gt; &gt; conventional 
&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions (even windows with an X server and a linux box running 
&gt; &gt; &gt; XDMCP)... what is it that you are trying to acheive? (I'm 
&gt; &gt; aware that 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it could be something that precludes all the more conventional 
&gt; &gt; &gt; options, but I'm still interested in what that is :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone had any experiance using these before?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, here's where I could be useful, but unfortunately, I 
&gt; &gt; haven't had 
&gt; &gt; &gt; any experience with them... though I ahve looked into them 
&gt; &gt; for thigns 
&gt; &gt; &gt; like givign Solaris users access to Windows applications, 
&gt; &gt; and so on... 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they always turned out to be less sensible than whatever other 
&gt; &gt; &gt; solutions, due to the price/performance ratio (SPARCs are 
&gt; &gt; slow per $, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then the cards are behind the curve and overpriced 
&gt; &gt; themselves... I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; also enquired about doing it the other way around, so a PC 
&gt; &gt; user could 
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a SPARC as well, but that isn't an offered solution 
&gt; &gt; anywhere)...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know if they could be used with RedHat for Sparc?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I strongly doubt it. the SunPCI cards were never that 
&gt; &gt; popular anyway, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I would think that most people who want Linux and some 
&gt; &gt; other intel 
&gt; &gt; &gt; based OS would stick to x86 hardware, so I doubt anyone's
developed 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the drivers... They may not be that complex though (but 
&gt; &gt; that depends 
&gt; &gt; &gt; on your skills and time -- I couldn't do it no matter how 
&gt; &gt; much time I 
&gt; &gt; &gt; had :)
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did a search on the net but could only turn up referances
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to Solaris.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tried asking on RH-SPARC lists? These would be the most 
&gt; &gt; concentrated 
&gt; &gt; &gt; groups of people who would be likely to know...
