&gt; In my opinion this list is beginning to need some active management.

Strangely enough, this list is a public forum[1], people who say things
that may well require "active management" will, in time, experience
"passive management". They will gain something of a reputation, and this
reputation will extend from the virtual world of the mailing list into
the real world[2]. It will spread to prospective and current clients and
employers, as well as co-workers, and other people associated with them.

This reputation will cause people to actively dissociate themselves from
the person[3]. In this way, people who gain such a reputation will dig
their own graves, and basically make life hard for themselves. It's a
self-destructive pattern of behaviour, and may indicate that "help" of
some kind is needed, but that's definitely Off Topic, and not something
that this community ever set out to acheive.

As many of us know, Adelaide is a small place, and the IT industry is
extremely small. The Unix community is almost inbred. There's no more
than two degrees of separation in the Adelaide Unix community -- news,
and reputations, travel fast and far. While it's hard for many of us not
to treat this list like a small, closed circle of friends, the fact is
that it's more like an amplified conversation in a packed room, with
random people entering and exiting as they please.

Everything on the list is "on the record", and can and will be used
against us in the course of life. Of course, this simply doesn't apply
to people who ask questions that they fear might be "dumb", or people
who offer answers that are actually wrong, as these are simply evidence
of a desire to learn, and a willingness to try to solve problems. In
fact, they are what this list is all about.

This list is a Good Thing. Let's not waste it.

PS This was going to be really short, but I got carried away. Besides,
it's late, and all the bandwidth is getting lonely without me sending
long emails... :)


[1] Read by well over 400 people (378 people on the main list and 44
people on the digest list, according to
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/</A>), many of whom are silent
readers, and may or may not be "technical types". It's archived on the
net, and well indexed by Google and friends, and has quite a high
profile here in the SA Linux community, as well as nationally...

[2] Well, as long as there is something to link the virtual and real,
like a name... "active management" may be needed for people when they
aren't well-known by the community...

[3] eg by not employing them, not working with them, inserting
disclaimers into sentences that may associate them with the person.
