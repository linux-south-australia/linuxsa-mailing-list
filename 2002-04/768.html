&gt; Sorry for the off topic post, we are going to buy some gigabit cards for
&gt; all our servers. What is the best brand to buy that works well with
&gt; Linux and (sorry to mention) winnt/2k/xp? I've heard that the gigabit
&gt; 'server' cards are way more expensive that a standard card. so i guess
&gt; my question is does it pay to buy cheap gigabit cards for servers or am
&gt; i asking for trouble? any suggestions on brands to buy/avoid?

Firstly, the more expensive cards may not be better.  The first generation
of GbE cards were very expensive.  The newer generation are much less
expensive.  So the better card may also be the cheaper card.

For example, the original "Intel Pro/1000 Server" is more expensive than
the later and better "Intel Pro/1000 Server F" or "Intel Pro 1000 Server
T".

There is a "client" versus "server" distinction.  This does count.  The
server cards have some useful features (like much more buffer memory)  
and some dubious features (like on-board TCP checksumming)[1].  You might
also find two versions of the server card, a really expensive one with
IPSec support and a cheaper one with no on-baord crypto (on-board crypto
is worthwhile, but only if you run IPSec).

Benchmark tests across the past two years (but for Windows NT) have
consistently given the throughput ranking Intel, 3Com, SysKonnect.

Linux driver support varies, but is improving all the time.  The Broadcom
chipset is supported, but not nicely enough for me (this chipset is used
in the 3Com card).  The Intel and SysKonnect cards seem to have better
drivers, both are vendor-sponsored open source.  Unfortunately at the
moment you can expect some driver issues regardless of your choice of
card.

If you want to get the most from your GbE card you'll also need about
another 128MB of memory.  At GbE speeds you can really eat through
buffers.

[1] On-board TCP checksumming makes a lot of sense until you
    read research into the causes of faulty packets caught by
    the TCP checksum.  It turns out that 50% of the packets
    were corrupted on their way from the CPU to the NIC.  So
    moving the checksumming from CPU to NIC allows much more
    data corruption.  It's clear that it is the CPU, not the
    NIC card, that needs the hardware TCP checksum.
