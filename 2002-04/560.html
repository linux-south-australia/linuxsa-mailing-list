ummm,
mkisofs sourcelocation |cdrecord [options]

afaik you just call mkisofs without the "-o outputfile" bit and it goes
to stdout. I feel really worried here... am I being really dumb and on
the completely wrong wavelength here? I get that a lot. :)

&gt; cdrecord, yes, but mkisofs? I tryed - and I got a file called -. There
&gt; doesnt seem to be an option to say stdout either. :(

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could just pipe the output from mkisofs to cdrecord, as long as you

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I couldnt find a way to get mkisofs to dump to stdout, it only seems to
&gt; &gt; &gt; support files. I guess you could use a fifo, but thats a bit messy. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can't find what I specifically read, but the below suggests what I
&gt; &gt; swear I've seen; mkisofs should just be able to pipe normally to
&gt; &gt; cdrecord. When I read it, my cdburner at the time did not have any
&gt; &gt; buffer underrun technology so I didn't bother. I was too proud of my
&gt; &gt; linux box never burning a coaster. :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4.27 What will cdrecord do when it stops getting input from the pipe?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It will finish writing. So you can just couple your favourite backup
&gt; &gt; tool with cdrecord using a pipe, like in "bru -size=640m -f - | cdrecord
&gt; &gt; dev=0,1,0 speed=2 -". You have to take special care within the backup
&gt; &gt; utility if the backup spans multiple CD-Rs.
