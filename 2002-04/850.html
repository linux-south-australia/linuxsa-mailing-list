Hi List,

I don't know if I should be going 'whoopee' or 'bugger'. I have played around 
with the cables all afternoon, and now, strangely, what didn't work before 
now works. I have the output from the amp now coming from the line-out (rec to 
the tape deck.) It is producing an excellent signal, clean and very true to 
source. This is where I started, except that it didn't work. Now by magic, it 
works perfectly! I not complain, just wonder!

The system now is:
Vinyl LP
Denon turntable
Toshiba amp
Vibra 128 soundcard
Rhino12 MB with Cyrix PR200 CPU
Linux Mandrake 8.2 OS
sox -c2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track&lt;nn&gt;.wav
XCDRoast
CDR
Cheap CD player and amp
Krix MF2 speakers
Me

The difference between the source LP and the CD, played on my bits-and-pieces 
System, is small indeed, certainly very acceptable for a conversion of the 
collection. I will add a 'pop-and-hiss' filter this week as the final link, 
and the result will probably be that playing the resulting CDs will be 
better, as far as the ear goes, than playing the original vinyls. That means 
the vinyl will go back in storage. They have hardly been played at all, they 
were cut straight to tape when we bought them, to preserve the originals. I 
wonder what I will be doing with them in another thirty years, if I live to 
eighty.

Thanks list for your inputs, tolerance and patience. I am now listeneing to 
the 'Bushwackers Band - Dance Album' as I cut it over to WAVs. A glass of Oz 
bubbly in hand. Celebrating twenty nine years of marriage today. Not bad for 
a first go.

Last chapter next week sometime when the filters get applied.

Bruce
