I have tried to send my rough guide to a few people but it was too big, so I
don't know if anyone will get the file.

So, I was able to upload it here:

<A HREF="http://www.morton2001.org/samba.pdf">http://www.morton2001.org/samba.pdf</A>
(my boss is a cpa and a politician)


It is called the "Samba sub beta".

It has some Novell and Windows 2K stuff in there too.
I might separate them eventually.

There are a few things I have to add after looking over the guide again.

One basic thing was setting up the workgroup name in Windows. I forgot that.

I have to also think about weather one idea that I have is actually
feasable....

In my effort to take some of the complication out of the set up of Samba, I
end up walking the reader through the entire install and use of SWAT.
However, it avoids the issue of utilizing passwords and user names for
authentication but leaves the option open for the reader to add these
features as he becomes more familiar with Samba. In the mean time I give the
reader a firewall as an interim measure.

Then I thought about IPv6.

My firewall is crude because it uses the manual specification of local ip
addresses.

I thought to myself, only if the ip addresses were not so predictable, the
firewall would act as a retinal scan does as a password.

Then I thought of IPv6 which uses the network card number to create a unique
ip number.

Could I use local IPv6 numbers in the ipchains firewall?

Am I being too optimistic or would this be bad security?

I also need to edit the firewall stuff heavily.

Anyway, I hope it is helpful. I know I am trying to learn by teaching...

&gt; &gt; at the risk of appearing boring, what's wrong with good old plain text?
&gt; &gt; or if you really can't live without bold titles and different size
&gt; &gt; fonts etc, html?
&gt;
&gt; There's nothing wrong with plain text, however a structured system such
&gt; as DocBook or less so LaTeX or even less so TeX can aid in writing the
&gt; document.
&gt;
&gt; Use the right tool for the right job -- if this "guide" is good enough
&gt; to be a HOWTO I see no reason for not submitting it to the LDP itself.
