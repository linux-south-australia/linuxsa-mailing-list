Assign the IP to the MAC

man dhcpd.conf

The fixed-address statement

        fixed-address address [, address ... ];

       The fixed-address statement is used to assign one or more fixed IP
addresses to a client.  It should only appear in a host dec­
       laration.   If more than one address is supplied, then when the
client boots, it will be assigned the address which corresponds
       to the network on which it is booting.  If none of the addresses in
the fixed-address statement are on the network on which the
       client  is  booting,  that  client  will  not match the host
declaration containing that fixed-address statement.  Each address
       should be either an IP address or a domain name which resolves to
one or more IP addresses.

Although I've only needed to do it with a WinNT 4.0 DHCP server the
principle should be the same and I expect to be fully converting to Linux
dhcpd soon,

&gt; Subject: DHCPD events - Linux or Win Problem ??
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone shed light on the following problem
&gt;
&gt; Setup is as follows
&gt; DHCP Server : Smoothwall ( Linux ) with scope 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.0.30
&gt; Client PC : Win2K
&gt;
&gt; I've got Port forwarding set up on Smoothwall box to go to
&gt; 10.0.0.10 which
&gt; is the address that the Win2K PC usually gets. Problem is I had
&gt; my PC round
&gt; at a friends house on weekend. His DHCP server has range 10.0.0.20 -
&gt; 10.0.0.40 so my Win2K PC grabbed .20 and is now stuck with it.
&gt;
&gt; Now DHCP is supposed to give out the same address if it free
&gt; but how do I
&gt; override it. Is it the Win2K box that is requesting the same
&gt; address ( even
&gt; if it is released ) or is it the Linux Box giving that address because
&gt; that's what it had before.
&gt;
&gt; My work around was to change my scope to 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.0.11 and then
&gt; release/renew my Win2K box but there must be a better way.
&gt;
