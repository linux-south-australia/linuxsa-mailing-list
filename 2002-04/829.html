Can I just say that if you are serious about getting good quality, dont use an internal soundcard.
 They really blow.  Do some research into external devices that will do the AD for you.  I have
seen some USB units that look interesting.

The idea with the digital handicam is fantastic, it does exactly this.

Also, sox is ok, but it doesn't have any intelligence by way of filters.  I would think you'd need
some low- anbd high-pass filters if your coming in from an LP.

Also, its all the cartridge man.  I spent $60 on a needle and it made a *huge* difference.  I
haven't been in Adelaide for a couple of years, but Central Station in Rundle Mall had some of the
best needles around.  The Ironic thing is, the better the needle, the more you can here the
defects in your turntable.  My new needle produced a really annoying ~60Hz bass rattle which I
assume was from the mains - hence filters.

The other thins thats already been said, is use a wet cleaner on your disks.

Some more ideas:
 - dont use a speaker output.  The impedence and output levels are all wrong.
 - make sure your LP is grounded properlly.  Most amps have an LP ground, use it.
 - make sure your tunrtable is on a good solid base.  not a flimsy wooden table or anything. 
remember - this is all about vibration.
 - investigate the advance software.  you'll appreciate the difference.

have fun!
