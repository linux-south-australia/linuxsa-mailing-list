I believe the way this stuff works is by having your prompt set to include
some ansi escape sequences to set the xterm title bar.

I use the following in by bash_pro<A HREF="file:">file:</A>

PS1='[\W]$ '
export PS1

if  [ "$TERM" = "xterm" ]; then
    export PROMPT_COMMAND=
    echo -ne "\033]0;@${HOSTNAME}\007"
fi


This is specifically because i DONT like having the title change as i move
around - i just want it to become @myHostname and stay that way.

The default on redhat is to have PS or something set it on every chdir
though.. so thats why i mentioned it might be in the bashrc or profiles
somewhere..

&gt; Hi Richard,

&gt; I started reading up on PS1 but once again couldn't find anything that would
&gt; make a difference.
&gt;
&gt; I tend to agree that it is bash doing this, as you quite right say that the
&gt; path keeps changing as you move around the file system. I also noticed that
&gt; the full name seems to come up after I log in ie. if I ssh to the ip no. the
&gt; ip no. is displayed until I log in then it changes to the full domain name.

&gt; &gt; already checked bashrc and can't see any thing different.
&gt;
&gt; One might think that it was PS1, but a little experimentation shows that
&gt; it is possible to have full domain name in the prompt, while still having
&gt; the short form in the label.
&gt;
&gt; The label changes as you change around the system, and I run some apps
&gt; that actually write to the Window label, and when I exit from them, I
&gt; believe it goes back to its original label.
&gt;
&gt; So, it seems to be bash that is doing it.

&gt; &gt; It's more likely the setup in the global profile changed..
&gt; &gt; check the differences in /etc/bashrc perhaps?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (just a thought)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone know how to make RH7.2 display the full domain name in the
&gt; &gt; title
&gt; &gt; &gt; bar when using a terminal window or Putty. Older versions of RH use to
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; this just fine, but for some reason 7.2 seems to be only giving me the
&gt; &gt; name
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the box and not the rest of the domain.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am finding this a bit annoying when I have serval terminal sessions
&gt; open
&gt; &gt; &gt; to remote boxes on the screen at once and can't alway tell which is
&gt; which.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have checked the hosts table is OK and hostname always gives me the
&gt; full
&gt; &gt; &gt; domain name.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering if something in termcap has changed maybe.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
