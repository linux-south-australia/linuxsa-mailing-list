Ben

&gt; does anyone have any experience with openLDAP? i'm after opinions on
&gt; it's reliability, ease of use, ease of administration, or any general
&gt; comments. is it the best solution? are there better
&gt; {proprietary|open-source} solutions (that run on linux, of course)?

I think that a lot of people do run it. Let's put it this way. Tellurian 
is comfortable with suggesting it to its customers who are willing to 
work with Open Source solutions (1).

&gt; i'm thinking of using it for an intranet project - publishing contact
&gt; details that are entered via a web interface to some db back-end to an
&gt; LDAP directory.

Because Open LDAP speaks LDAP in a standard fashion, you can generally 
bolt a proprietary front-end onto it. I think you've gotten yourself 
muddled a little and there are really two issues your asking:

1) What are OpenLDAP's technical credentials?
  Questions could include:
  - how easy is it to actually configure the LDAP's server settings
  - how secure is it?
  - how easily supportable is it?

2) What tools exist to manage the database it runs?

They're actually quite separate questions. You can liken an LDAP server 
to a database optimised for read access that happen to speak LDAP 
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Hence, to make an analogy 
speaking SQL to MySQL is something like:

select username, password from passworddatabase where username='dsl';

But I could also use ODBC and use Microsoft Access to do the same thing 
graphically. And there are tonnes of other nice things out there. I 
could even roll my own.

I'm sure you get the picture.

In LDAP you get O= and CN= and so forth. I'm not an expert on LDAP and I 
need my LDAP references to get it right...

Hope this is of some use.
