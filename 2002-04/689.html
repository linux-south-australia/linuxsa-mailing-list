Hi all,

I've got a problem that I just can't fathom. I upgraded a RH6.2 box to
RH7.2, which included KDE 2.2, and now, when I run KMail, I get a
segmentation fault. Basically, in the GUI, I click on the KMail icon,
and three seconds later, a KCrash dialog box comes up that tells me it's
probably an application error, and lets me see a backtrace. The
backtrace tells me nothing interesting, as far as I can see[1]. I've
also done an strace on the process, from the command line, and can see
nothing special there either[2]. I also notice that a process called
drkonqi starts (this appears to be KCrash) when KMail crashes
(krashes?).

I've downloaded all the RH7.2 update rpms I could find, and installed
all of them. Unfortunately no difference. I've checked the ownership of
all files in the home directory, and removed all files in /tmp. I've
rebooted. I've waved a dead chicken in its' general direction while
chanting latin curses. None of these things appeared to have any effect
on KMail, though the latin curses did cause the desk to get covered in
chicken gizzard.

I'm not real familiar with KDE, nor with KMail -- indeed, I rarely use
GUI linux apps at all. I've tried navigating the KDE and RedHat websites
(I'm not a RH fan either), but to no avail. Does anyone have any ideas I
can follow up on? I'm pretty much all out. I can attach relevant dumps
(strace, KCrash) if people think they would be worthwhile, but due to
their size etc, I haven't attached them on this email...

TIA

PS oh, and no, I haven't yet had opportunity to try the methods for
getting into BIOS yet -- first things first, and unfortunately, this is
the first thing... :(


[1] well, it says "no debugging symbols found four times, then says
"0x411ca316 in __wait4 () from /lib/libc.so.6", followed by 13 more
similar lines.

[2] It says quite a lot, but nothing that appears to be a problem. It
appears to try to open libraries in multiple wrong places, but each one
it fails on, it eventually gets it right. The execution appears to run
quickly, pause for a second after loading the freetype library (and
doing some "old_mmap()" calls, then continues until it crashes, with the
a number of calls similar to the following:

write(3, "\0\0\0\17anonymous-1671\0\0\0\0\6kmail\0\0\0\0"...,61 = 61

followed by apparent calls to KCrash, and finishing with _exit(255).
