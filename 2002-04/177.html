Next time someone asks why their computer was obsolete so quickly...:

The Unbroken Circle of Power 
Scribbled by Mr. Zoltarr 
Have you ever stopped for a minute to ask yourself: how much more? How much
more processing power does my computer REALLY need? WHY does it need it? WHY
do I need it? Indeed, as performance keeps rising, one is literally under
assault by the numerous offers of bigger, better, faster computers. I've had
a computer since 1997, and I have seen the industry evolve geometrically.
Remember the Pentium? Its speed did not exceed 233 MHz (and that in its
final period). Back in those days, whoever had a P120 with 16 MB of RAM
(that was me) could do almost everything. And that lasted a while. Now? You
go out to buy a P4 2.2 GHz. After a month, you're likely to find out that,
for the same amount of money, a 2.6 GHz model is available. The first
instinctive reaction is to conclude that your computer is now obsolete, and
go upgrade. Unless, of course, you start asking yourself: what's the point?
That computer works as fast as mine, because there aren't any applications
that really require a 1.0 GHz processor (much less, a 2.0 GHz one). So, why
this wave of new, more powerful hardware? Personally, I think that the speed
flood that occurred in the past few years is not a consequence of Moore's
law, but it's the result of the growing of the PC gaming industry. 
Ever since people in power found that there was serious amounts of money to
be made from selling PC games, everything went crazy - creating a vicious
circle. There's a new generation of games that require more processing power
&gt; a new generation of video cards appears &gt; a new generation of CPUs appears
&gt; a new generation of games that require more processing power appears &gt; and
so on. If it were to the satisfaction of the user, I'd understand. But the
newer games are just "shiny pieces of software," created for the purpose of
making the guy / girl who buys them feel good about blowing some $1000 on
the latest model. A few years ago, when you played a game, you felt like
reading a good book. The graphics and sound weren't much by today's
standards, but they had something else: they gave you a special feeling when
you played them. Nowadays, with a few exceptions, all the games are about
graphics. 
There are people who, when you tell them about a good game (sometimes a few
years old), say: "Yeah, sure - how are the graphics?" These are mostly
people who got computers in the last 3 years. Tell them it's 2D, and they
start throwing up. The industry "depends" on that, producing more games that
look good. When you get past their good looks, you're left with nothing. I,
too, fell victim to this. After I purchased my GeForce 2 Pro, I looked for
great games to play. I was disappointed. Beneath the awesome graphics, there
was nothing. So I ended up playing Fallout, a five year-old game with 2D
graphics. There are some really good games that put the video card to good
use, but why get a GeForce 3 when you don't fully use a GeForce 2? 
By carelessly coding games, programmers push the system requirements higher
and higher. I don't know if that's totally their fault, though. Maybe the
companies tell them to. I'm not saying that there aren't programs that
really need a lot of processing power, but many need them just for the sake
of needing. Let's take two operating systems, Windows XP and Mandrake Linux.
For a good install, they'll eat up some 1.4 GB. The difference is that,
while XP needs that space just for itself, Linux needs that space for a swap
partition, some programs, and some free space. Let's pretend that size
doesn't matter (though it really does). I installed XP on my laptop (Celeron
at 500 MHz, 64 MB RAM). It barely moved. Multitasking was out of reach. I
installed Linux. It moved pretty well ( 'm not a Linux tweaker, so I didn't
know how to make it work better) - considerably better than XP. I visited a
friend who had XP and Linux on a AMD Athlon at some 700 MHz (I'm not
certain) and 128 MB RAM. XP moved better. In fact, it moved really well.
Linux moved slightly faster (that guy didn't even have time to configure the
color scheme, so the system was in its raw post-install state, and had a
smaller swap than mine). What did I come to learn? Not that Linux is limited
in performance, because it moved a bit faster on a better computer. Instead,
I asked myself: will it behave the same on a Pentium? I believe so. 
That proves that it's not as hardware-dependent as Windows. I'm not trying
to convince anyone to switch to Linux here. I still use Windows 98, and it
works great for me. What I'm trying to do is make you ask yourself a simple
question: if it works fine, why spend a sack of money just because its
supposed to be better? The answer lies within ourselves. People get bored
with the old, and try to find something new. You get bored with Office 97,
Microsoft knows it, launches Office XP, you go out and buy it. Why? Because
you were bored. Have you indeed gained something out of this? Not much. It's
still Word, Excel, PowerPoint... there are improvements, but are they really
worth the money you pay for them? Have you lost anything out of this? Think
about the money you spent on a nearly identical program, the time it took to
figure out how to install it (Office 2000's installer is much foggier than
97's), and the money you had to spend on upgrading you system - because
Office XP won't work on your four year-old computer. 
Why spend a lot of money upgrading a program that already works the way you
need it to, then spend more money upgrading the system because now it
doesn't work the way you need it to? Because they said so on TV? Yet another
reason for this uncontrolled growth of computer performance is our
competitive egos. It all comes down to: my [insert object here] is bigger /
better than yours. I have more RAM, my HDD is bigger, I have a faster CPU,
etc. It is in our nature to compete. This is what makes people buy better
computers when they don't actually need them. They need to have the best one
- without even noticing that they only use it at a fragment of its full
potential. What do you need a 2.2 GHz CPU for, when all you do is surf the
Web, chat on IRC, write some stuff, and send a few e-mails? You can always
brag about it at work. And so, your friend who has "only" a 1.0 GHz
processor will go out and upgrade, because he somehow feels inferior to you,
and that his computer has become obsolete (even though that's not the case).

what did I try to say here? I didn't say not to upgrade your computer. That
would be dumb. I didn't say not to get newer software. That would also be
dumb. What I did try to say was: don't buy it unless you need it. That's the
main reason why they keep pushing technology further and further. People
buy. Do they really need it? In most cases, no. Do they really want it?
"Well, it said so on TV, and Joe and Bob got one, too - so maybe I should."
And the software industry tries to make us feel better by raising the system
requirements, so we wouldn't feel like we wasted the money. The only
reasonable thing left to do is to stop getting that shiny new object and use
what we've already got to its full potential. Even if it sounds corny, the
power is, in the end, ours. Maybe then the prices would go down.
