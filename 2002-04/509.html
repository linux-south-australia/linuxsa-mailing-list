It looks like the name comes from login? The getty would only answer the
connection and hand it to ppp before the username is sent (with chap and
pap) so I doubt your getty is going to be at fault. What about ppp debug
levels? We just leave ours turned up, it helps debug thing (funny that)
maybe usernames is one of the first things it stats tracking?

&gt; Hmm,
&gt; Still no luck, anybody else got any ideas?  i can cat /var/log/messages and

&gt; anything.  very sad....
&gt; 
&gt; i might mention that i'm using the mgetty that is on netcrafts site as the
&gt; latest rpm with redhat has a problem or two and netcraft so kindly pointed
&gt; me to their compiled one.
&gt; 
&gt; sounds like i might have to investigate portslave/radius setup, but it seems
&gt; a bit of an over kill for our 7 modems.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, thanks all for replying before, gave me a lot to work with...
&gt; thanks

&gt; Subject: RE: who is dialed up? pppd server
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ah. i do recall something like that.  i followed the 'Pocket ISP' howto from
&gt; memory but i've played around with it a bit to get stuff going
&gt; my login.config reads:
&gt; --------line that counts-----
&gt; /AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth +chap +pap login debug
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; -----------full file-----------
&gt; # login.config
&gt; #
&gt; # This is a sample "login dispatcher" configuration file for mgetty
&gt; #
&gt; # Format:
&gt; #       username userid utmp_entry login_program [arguments]
&gt; #
&gt; # Meaning:
&gt; #       for a "username" entered at mgettys login: prompt, call
&gt; #       "login_program" with [arguments], with the uid set to "userid",
&gt; #       and a USER_PROCESS utmp entry with ut_user = "utmp_entry"
&gt; #
&gt; # username may be prefixed / suffixed by "*" (wildcard)
&gt; #
&gt; # userid is a valid user name from /etc/passwd, or "-" to not set
&gt; #  a login user id and keep the uid/euid root (needed for /bin/login)
&gt; #
&gt; # utmp_entry is what will appear in the "who" listing. Use "-" to not
&gt; #  set an utmp entry (a must for /bin/login), use "@" to set it to the
&gt; #  username entered. Maximum length is 8 characters.
&gt; #
&gt; # login_program is the program that will be exec()ed, with the arguments
&gt; #  passed in [arguments]. A "@" in the arguments will be replaced with the
&gt; #  username entered. Warning: if no "@" is given, the login_program has
&gt; #  no way to know what user name the user entered.
&gt; #
&gt; #
&gt; # SAMPLES:
&gt; # Use this one with my Taylor-UUCP and Taylor-UUCP passwd files.
&gt; #  (Big advantage: tuucp can use the same passwd file for serial dial-in
&gt; #   and tcp dial-in [uucico running as in.uucpd]). Works from 1.05 up.
&gt; #
&gt; #U*     uucp    @       /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -l -u @
&gt; 
&gt; #
&gt; # Use this one for fido calls (login name /FIDO/ is handled specially)
&gt; #
&gt; # You need Eugene Crosser's "ifmail" package for this to work.
&gt; #  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DFIDO", otherwise a fido call won't
&gt; #  be detected.
&gt; #
&gt; #/FIDO/ uucp    fido    /usr/local/lib/fnet/ifcico @
&gt; 
&gt; #
&gt; # Automatic PPP startup on receipt of LCP configure request (AutoPPP).
&gt; #  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DAUTO_PPP" for this to work.
&gt; #  Warning: Case is significant, AUTOPPP or autoppp won't work!
&gt; #  Consult the "pppd" man page to find pppd options that work for you.
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE: for *some* users, the "-detach" option has been necessary, for
&gt; #        others, not at all. If your pppd doesn't die after hangup, try it.
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE2: "debug" creates lots of debugging info.  LOOK AT IT if things
&gt; #         do not work out of the box, most likely it's a ppp problem!
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE3: "man pppd" is your friend!
&gt; #
&gt; #  NOTE4: max. 9 arguments allowed.
&gt; #
&gt; /AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth +chap +pap login debug
&gt; 
&gt; #
&gt; #
&gt; # An example where no login name in the argument list is desired:
&gt; #  automatically telnetting to machine "smarty" for a given login name
&gt; #
&gt; #telnet-smarty  gast    telnet  /usr/bin/telnet -8 smarty
&gt; #
&gt; # This is the "standard" behaviour - *dont* set a userid or utmp
&gt; #  entry here, otherwise /bin/login will fail!
&gt; #  This entry isn't really necessary: if it's missing, the built-in
&gt; #  default will do exactly this.
&gt; #
&gt; #*      -       -       /bin/login @
&gt; #/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd
