Hi Peter,

The reason you can't see the duplex setting is that system administrators
shouldn't fiddle with it, as 9 times out of 10 they don't understand what
it does.

The summary is: set both the switch and the PC to autonegotiate OR set
both the switch and the PC to 100BaseTX FDX.

Setting a speed and duplex sets the speed and duplex of the local NIC
*and* turns off the negotiation protocol.  Without the negotiation
protocol an autonegotiating port defaults to 10BaseTX HDX (the original
ethernet speed and duplex for twisted pair).

Thus a system administrator setting the duplex to "full" actually
ends up with a configuration

          Speed  Duplex  Autoneg
  Host:    100    FDX      Off
  Switch:   10    HDX       On

When the host comes up the switch sees a 100MHz carrier, resulting in the
configuration

          Speed  Duplex  Autoneg
  Host:    100    FDX      Off
  Switch:  100    HDX       On

The mismatched duplex will cause packet loss and low throughput. 

This is slightly complicated by the fact that some NIC cards and some
switches have faulty negotiation protocols.  The early DEC Tulip cards and
the early Cisco and HP switches are in this category -- I'd be thinking
that the VMS machine might well have a card with the DEC Tulip 21140 chip
(eg: a DE500-AA card rather than the DE500-BA card which uses the
bug-fixed 21143 chip).  The switches can usually be fixed by a software
upgrade.

The way you set the duplex is as a kernel parameter.  See

  <A HREF="http://www.scyld.com/network/tulip.html">http://www.scyld.com/network/tulip.html</A>

for the DEC cards.  For example /etc/modules.conf could contain
  alias eth0 tulip
  options eth0 options=8
  # options=8 is 100BaseTX, FDX, RJ45

The DEC chip has more complex parameters than most cards, normally you
would say
  alias eth0 eepro100
  options eth0 full_duplex=1

To see the link negotiation set "debug", bigger numbers produce more
output.

  alias eth0 tulip
  options eth0 options=8 debug=1
  # options=8 is 100BaseTX, FDX, RJ45
  # debug=1 prints negotiation, debug=6 prints the most

To summarise, for modern PCs leave the duplex and speed settings well
alone.  Perhaps set "debug" to ensure that the negotiation works
correctly.  If it doesn't then suspect that the switch port is not set for
autonegotiate.  If the NIC card doesn't do autonegotiation correctly throw
it away and get a new one, new cards cost so little that anything else is
a waste.

For old, more expensive machinery with faulty NIC cards then nail down the
speed and duplex parameters *at both the host and the switch*.  
Fortunately this machinery is unlikely to move switch ports, unlike PCs.

Regards,
Glen
