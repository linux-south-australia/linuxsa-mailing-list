that's an encouraging sentence. what was the (1) appended to this?

&gt; Because Open LDAP speaks LDAP in a standard fashion, you can
&gt; generally
&gt; bolt a proprietary front-end onto it. I think you've gotten yourself
&gt; muddled a little and there are really two issues your asking:
&gt;
&gt; 1) What are OpenLDAP's technical credentials?
&gt;   Questions could include:
&gt;   - how easy is it to actually configure the LDAP's server settings
&gt;   - how secure is it?
&gt;   - how easily supportable is it?
&gt;
&gt; 2) What tools exist to manage the database it runs?
&gt;
&gt; They're actually quite separate questions. You can liken an
&gt; LDAP server
&gt; to a database optimised for read access that happen to speak LDAP
&gt; (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

i think the questions i'm asking are more along the lines of how easy is
it to administer programmatically (probably using something like php or
java), and how reliable is it in terms of does it crash with large
client load (for some definition of large), is it secure, and so on
(like your first group). admininstration would be almost purely from an
interface like php.

the task involves publishing the contact details on a web page, but i
was thinking if it's not a massive job to install/configure/maintain an
LDAP directory, it could be a nice add-on for them (access it from
outlook etc). if it takes 3 weeks to configure and work out how to
dynamically update, then i don't want to do it. if it takes installing
an rpm or 3 and a few lines of code to update the LDAP at the same time
as the main DB, then it'd be perfect.
