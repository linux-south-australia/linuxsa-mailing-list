I am fairly confident that people starting with linux do not know
everything about it. New users should be encouraged not abused.

&gt; They were never Linux users.  They were idiots.  Why else would they turn
&gt; away from enlightenment?  Err, the one that's not a window manager...
&gt; 

Someone trying to unsubscribe the wrong way is not an idiot. They are
here looking for information, likely get turned away because of the
David* responses and then try to leave.

I would love to point new users to this list, but I cannot. The Linux
community is not helpful, it discourages new users.

&gt; 
&gt; Hear, hear.  Very well said.

If I was one of the top 20 elite members of this list, I may well think
the same way. I have probably introduced more people to Linux than most
on this list, it is a shame that I must tell them not to post here, as
they will be abused.
