&gt; &gt; Who knows of any software for linux that'll burn dvds and supports

&gt; &gt; the network :( FWIW cdbakeoven looks like it supports dvds, but there is
&gt; &gt; no way to select &gt; 100min cd in the cd creation section.
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't cdrecord do it natively? I have no idea about writing DVD's, but
&gt; wouldn't it be more a problem for mkisofs than for cdrecord anyway?

Ive got it sussed now. You need to use cdrecord-prodvd, and tell mkisofs
to split the files or else it core dumps at 2gb.

&gt; You could just pipe the output from mkisofs to cdrecord, as long as you
&gt; had some buffer underrun mojo...

I couldnt find a way to get mkisofs to dump to stdout, it only seems to
support files. I guess you could use a fifo, but thats a bit messy. 

On a slightly different subject, Im wondering about the licencing of
cdrecord-prodvd [1]

I was under the understanding that cdrecord was under the GNU licence. 
cdrecord-prodvd identifies itself as:

Cdrecord-ProDVD-Clone 1.11b19 (i586-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C)
1995-2002 J&ouml;rg Schilling

Which has "gnu" in it. Yet there is no source, and it has a licenceing
scheme (comes with a free for non-commercial/educational type key
though).

J&ouml;rg Schilling wrote both, but if cdrecord-prodvd is a derivative work
of cdrecord which is GNU, despite the fact that he is the author, can he
not release the source? And if there is no source, shouldnt he take GNU
out the version information?
