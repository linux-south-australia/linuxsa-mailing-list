that doesn't quite make sense to me compared with what you said in
the previous paragraph before that.
I can see that for email from a PC inside the network the mail received
headers would show the internal IP address but not for telnet.

Apart from that I find it unlikely that telstra would be checking so
much stuff, it took them ages to stop being open relays.  If they
clamped down too much they increase the calls to their helpdesk from
all the drongos with misconfigured M$ stuff.

Are you sure you/he is using the right mailserver at telstra?
what about trying "mail.bigpond.com"? (or check with telstra)
(or "postoffice.telstra.net")
how about if you try to send direct, ie without a relay?

Dave.
