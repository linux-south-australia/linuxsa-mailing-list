All,

I have read much (flaming and not flaming) about what is appropriate to go
onto this list.

I think any Linux list should have the same intention as Linus Torvald did
in creating and releasing Linux to the world.

Linux is not static, it is dynamic.

Linux is used for many different purposes, and I can say a whole lot of them
would either never have occurred to Linus nor would all have the blessing
and approval of Linus either.

Linux is like people - different people have different views and therefore
use the same tool in different ways, often not in the way every one would
like them to.

I see this list as a place to share ideas, ask questions (be they seen by
the individual as annoying, stupid, strange or downright weird) and to
hopefully get an answer or a pointer to the right place to look.

I would hope to get this in the same spirit as Linus had when he wrote and
released linux - with the hope people would be open to using it and would
enhance and embrace it - not shoot it down like some poor lame duck...
