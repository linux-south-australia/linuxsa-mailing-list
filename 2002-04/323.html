Michael:


&gt; Tonight AUUG(SA) signed some GPG/PGP keys.  It was fun.


Actually, AUUG-SA did no such thing. We invited people to come along and 
state their case for their identity. Some people -- most notably Greg 
Lehey -- had technical issues with proof of their identity. 
Specifically, although everyone could verify that Greg the human was 
actually Greg, Greg asked us to compare the key he had provided to 
Andrew Rutherford to print with a key archived by Michael Davies (i.e. you).

It is possible that the keys were the same but the hashing algorithm was 
difficult. Noone could blame members present in not "trusting" such a 
key because in security the maxim should be ultra-paranoide.

This means, it was nothing personal about Greg in and of itself. Just 
that Greg couldn't produce independent, and technically undisputable to 
the layperson proof that the keys were different.

Notice my latter statement. Greg needs to prove to people who are NOT 
computer experts that his key is good. This means that any hashes/ids he 
reads out must be EXACTLY those reported by a public key server holding 
his key. There should be no difference, and if so, the difference must 
be reproducible using common tools and easily performed by the person 
expected to verify the key.

(for example, if Greg's ID were XXYY but my stupid OS didn't like XX's 
then the algorithm might be "substitute all occurences os OO with XX" 
--not diffciult to do with perl, sed or awk. On the other hand, if it 
involved compiling something --- something that Windows generally 
doesn't come bundled with -- then I would class it as "not easily 
performed".

&gt; Do LinuxSA people want to do the same for this coming month's meeting?
&gt; (ie next Tuesday)?
