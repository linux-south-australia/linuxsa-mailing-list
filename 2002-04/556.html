1. quick, simple, wastefull way

assuming drive is hda.
install new drive as hdc or other drive.

dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc

wait.

You'll get a partition of the same size as what you had. It should be
bootable. 

2. Better more complex way.

Get a rescue cd.

Install new drive as (say) hdc

boot system

as root: fdisk /dev/hdc 
make partitions as you want them. (usually a /boot a / and a swap. you
need to change the type of the swap partition to type linux swap. Keep
them in the same order as the original drive, else be prepared to have
to modify /etc/fstab.

I'll assume hda1 is boot hda2 is swap and hda3 is root. This may not be
the case in your system. Try not to get partitions confused when your
data is at stake!

Make file systems:

mke2fs /dev/hda1
mke2fs /dev/hda3
mkswap /dev/hda2

If your using different file systems, use the appropriate tool for them.

make a temp dir to mount your new drive on, and do so. Same with your
boot partition:

mkdir /mnt/hdc
mount /dev/hdc3 /mnt/hdc
mkdir /mnt/hdc/boot
mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt/hdc/boot

Use tar to preserve ownership and permissions to transfer partitions.
Use 1 filesystem flag to stop it recursivly copying itself.

cd /mnt/hdc
tar -cplf - -C / . | tar -xpvf - 

The first tar will (c) create a tarball, with (p) permission info (which
is usually the default, but dont count on it) (l) on one file system
(that a lowercase L, not a 1) (f -) to a file which is stdout. (-C /)
change to the root directory first. Then . means current directory,
which due to the -C / will be the root dir.

The second tar will then (x) extract the tarball, with (p) permissions,
and a (v) verbose file listing so you can see it is working, and (f -)
from the file stdin. Your allready in the the directory/partition where
you want it to go, so it'll copy all the data over with permissions.

Then you'll need to do the same for the boot partition. 

cd /mnt/hdc/boot
tar -cplf - -C /boot . | tar -xpvf - 

You should have this sussed now.

Now umount /mnt/hdc/boot and /mnt/hdc, and shut down your system.

Set up the new drive as hda, and store the old drive 'till your sure it
worked. Boot off the rescue cd. Make a space to mount the new file
systems (you need to configure the bootloader). Something like this:

cd /mnt
mkdir hda
mount /dev/hda3 hda
cd hda
mount /dev/hda1 boot

Now, presuming lilo, do

lilo -r .

You are in the root of your new drive and the -r . tells lilo to use the
current directory as the root of the system. This puts it all in to
perspective for lilo since things are mounted abnormally at this stage.

Lilo should list the kernels, and return your prompt. cd back off this
drive, umount it all and reboot. That should be it.

If your using grub, then it can be a bit more confusing. I'll leave it
here becase this has turned in to a bit of an epic allready!

Needless to say, all these commands have a man page, and I suggest you
read them and make sure you understand what your doing before you begin.
You dont want to get half way and get stuck, although provided you havnt
accidentally trashed any of your original drive you should be able to
just go back to where you were.

3. dead easy/non linux way

Get the personal version of norton ghost. Make a boot disk. Run it. Use
the menu options to clone disk, and select to make the partitions large.

Ant

&gt; Hi,

&gt; We've got a RedHat 7.1 machine here, which runs a 2.5Gb IDE hard disk.  The
&gt; disk is starting to make horrible noises, and I suspect that its going to
&gt; fail soon.  I've got either a 3.2Gb or 4.2Gb replacement hard disk which I
&gt; can put into the machine.  Is there an easyish way to transfer the entire
&gt; system onto the new disk?  I'm really not fussed if I end up with only 2.5gb
&gt; usable on the new disk, as long as I've got everything from the old drive.
