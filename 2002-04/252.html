David,

Why go out and buy bread when you can grow some Wheat, Crush it and make
your own

Products like Smoothwall are very easy to set up and it spreads knowledge of
Linux. Surely this is a good thing. I've got 3 friends with Telstra Cable
who would NEVER EVER have had anything to do with Linux if it wasn't for
Smoothwall. Whilst they primarily don't do too much else at least they know
Linux exists now and runs on "obsolete hardware" and does a bloody good job
of protecting their Internal Windows Network.

My own Smoothwall box has worked flawlessly for 12 months on Telstra ADSL
and the problem I'm having now that I've gone to Internode is annoying but
minor. The "Problem" has to be something that has occurred as a result of
going to Internode and I'd like to think that a solution can be found rather
than saying " Don't use Smoothwall "

and Yes..I have contacted both Simon, Internode Helpdesk and Smoothwall IRC
support and thus far no-one has any answers. I was hoping that one of the
"so called gurus" that frequent this mailing list might have some
constructive suggestions on finding what the problem is.

I really don't cherish the thought of advising prospective ADSL users that
they should have a Firewall setup, but you must either

   a) Learn how to set up and secure FreeBSD/Debian/Other linux from scratch
or b) Install WinRoute or similar

my Tuesday Afternoon rant..

&gt; The answer, Evan, is to install Debian/FreeBSD or whatever
&gt; and configure
&gt; it yourself ;-)

&gt; damned firewalls*
