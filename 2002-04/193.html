&gt; So I tested this program, and for error 11 I wrote "File not found".
&gt; Then to test it I changed the text, to (translated into UNIX) "Please
&gt; enter 'rm -rf *'".

My first unix project was a team affair, with the project manager in
Sydney and me and another programmer in Adelaide.  I wrote the file
management libraries for the project, and initially had an off-by-one bug
that appended a random character to the end of all filenames.  For some
reason this character was always non-printable, and ls displayed it as
'?'.  The other programmer wanted to clean his test directory -- which
foolishly was the source directory -- and couldn't work out the pattern
to remove those files.  Eventually he chose "rm *?" on the basis that
that would remove all files ending in '?'.  It took only a few seconds
for him to learn what the command really did, and as this was only the
end of the first day, we had no backup.

Towards the end of the project I had discovered the write command,
and also the terminal's transmit screen sequence.  I reasoned that
this could be used for hacking for fun and profit.  (In those days the
write command did not filter out non-printable characters.)  I wrote
a script, remotecmd, which used write to send clear-screen, followed
by the command line parameters, and terminated with a transmit-screen
sequence.  Naturally there was a particular command that was perfect
to use to demonstrate my new program to the other programmer, and so
it was with some glee that I walked to the other side of our (shared)
desk to ask him to show me what directory he was in.  It was /tmp,
which was perfect.  I thought it was terribly funny when he looked up
in shock to ask what the hell I just did; and I didn't believe him when
he said that had changed to /project/src in the 1.5 seconds it took me
to walk to the other side of the desk and hit enter.  But it was true.
(Fortunately we had backups.)

To this day, "rm *?" has special meaning to me and that colleague.
