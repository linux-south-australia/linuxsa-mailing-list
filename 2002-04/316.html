That's just RPM trying to stop you from installing two modem-hogging
programs. You could just use "-f" (or whatever the force switch is).
&gt; 
&gt; This is very sad, does this mean i can't have both on the same server?
&gt; Maybe there is an mgetty without the fax?  is the sendfax that comes with
&gt; mgetty any good for sending and receiving faxes in a shared environment?

I was fiddling around with this myself on one my my boxes. I came to the
conclusion that both mgetty and HylaFax (applications that need both
read and write access to the serial port) can't both be using the same
serial device.

FreeBSD (the environment that I was working in) won't stop you from
installing the two packages together, as it assumes that you can work
this one out.

I have the impression from reading some documentation that came with the
HylaFax source that you *can* get the two to live simultaniously. There
was a HOWTO or some such document (that I can't find now -- the place
where I thought it was appears to be down) that explains this process.
