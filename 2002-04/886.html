Hmm.
I get the previous quoted message coloured cyan. If there was a previous
message, which had been replied to itself, its text would be another colour
again. It's not HTML email, its not magic, its not elm. Its PINE.

I happen to like it actually. When you've got chunks of text that've been
replied to over and over, its quite easy to tell who was writing what, when
its all colour-coded.

So, ah, that had something to do with point (a) anyway. Seeya :)

&gt; &gt; Just like to say a quick 'good quick service' if someone wants linux
&gt; &gt; distros...i got my 15 pack in about a week..... thanks Karun.  :)

&gt; Why do I see the above in blue and the quoted text indented in black? Is
&gt; it just HTML? Really? HTML...
&gt;
&gt; I forgot. I love HTML e-mail because:
&gt;
&gt; a it's colourful
&gt; b it can flash pretty pictures at me
&gt; c it makes fools of those who use Outlook by spreading viruses
&gt; d it takes more to download
&gt; e it upsets Greg Lehey
&gt; f it is able to be written by monkeys on a typewriter
&gt;
&gt; *hmmmmm*
&gt;
&gt; I'm going to submit the above as an LPI question...
&gt; DSL
&gt;
&gt; (1) *evil grin*
&gt;
&gt; (2) The correct answers are a, b, c, d and e ;-P
