&gt;In my experience, unreliable modems are often unreliable because the
&gt;plugpacks they plug into are crap.  Not quite enough juice often leads to
&gt;drop outs etc.  The most reliable modems often seemed to have the better
&gt;power supplies (this is not universally true).

I've always found that external modems with AC-AC transformer plug packs
perform poorly compared with the ones that use an AC-DC external power
supply.

&gt;I used an internal no-name brand Rockwell chipset internal modem for my
&gt;permanent BigPond link for several years.  It _averaged_ 2 weeks per call.

Before Christmas we ordered way more lines than we needed to stave off
impending shortages, which resulted in some customers on 'unlimited hours'
plans staying connected for up to 47 days at a time. I think this may have
been with a swannsmart modem, on a standard analogue line.

When I setup my first 56K access server in 1997, I arranged to trial most of
the available modems to see what worked best with 56Flex. The Swannsmart
(then) looked to be the best value, beaten only by the Banksia waveSP for
performance.

One of the stranger results of testing many modems was the Spirit Viper
28.8. For PPP connections it could produce significantly better latency
characteristics than just about anything else at the time, getting down to
90ms on a standard windows ping.
