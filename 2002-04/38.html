# PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:
#
# Just by configuring these settings and using the SuSEfirewall2 you are
# not secure per se! There is *not* such a thing you install and hence you
# are safed from all (security) hazards.
#
# To ensure your security, you need also:
#
#   * Secure all services you are offering to untrusted networks (internet)
#     You can do this by using software which has been designed with
#     security in mind (like postfix, apop3d, ssh), setting these up without
#     misconfiguration and praying, that they have got really no holes.
#     SuSEcompartment can help in most circumstances to reduce the risk.
#   * Do not run untrusted software. (philosophical question, can you trust
#     SuSE or any other software distributor?)
#   * Harden your server(s) with the harden_suse package/script
#   * Recompile your kernel with the openwall-linux kernel patch
#     (former secure-linux patch, from Solar Designer) www.openwall.com
#   * Check the security of your server(s) regulary
#   * If you are using this server as a firewall/bastion host to the internet
#     for an internal network, try to run proxy services for everything and
#     disable routing on this machine.
#   * If you run DNS on the firewall: disable untrusted zone transfers and
#     either don't allow access to it from the internet or run it split-brained.
#
# Good luck!

# Configuration HELP:
#
# If you have got any problems configuring this file, take a look at
# /usr/share/doc/packages/SuSEfirewall2/EXAMPLES for an example.
#
#
# All types have to set START_FW2 in /etc/rc.config to "yes" ;-)
#
# If you are a end-user who is NOT connected to two networks (read: you have
# got a single user system and are using a dialup to the internet) you just
# have to configure (all other settings are OK): 2) and maybe 9).
#
# If this server is a firewall, which should act like a proxy (no direct
# routing between both networks), or you are an end-user connected to the
# internet and to an internal network, you have to setup your proxys and
# reconfigure (all other settings are OK): 2), 3), 9) and maybe 7), 11), 14)
#
# If this server is a firewall, and should do routing/masquerading between
# the untrusted and the trusted network, you have to reconfigure (all other
# settings are OK): 2), 3), 5), 6), 9), and maybe 7), 10), 11), 12), 13),
# 14), 20)
#
# If you want to run a DMZ in either of the above three standard setups, you
# just have to configure *additionally* 4), 9), 12), 13), 17), 19).
#
# If you know what you are doing, you may also change 8), 11), 15), 16)
# and the expert options 19), 20), 21), 22) and 23) at the far end, but you
# should NOT.
#
# If you use diald or ISDN autodialing, you might want to set 17).
#
# To get programs like traceroutes to your firewall to work is a bit tricky,
# you have to set the following options to "yes" : 11 (UDP only), 18 and 19.
#
# Please note that if you use service names, that they exist in /etc/services.
# There is no service "dns", it's called "domain"; email is called "smtp" etc.
#
# *Any* routing between interfaces except masquerading requires to set FW_ROUTE
# to "yes" and use FW_FORWARD or FW_ALLOW_CLASS_ROUTING !
#
# If you just want to do masquerading without filtering, ignore this script
# and run this line (exchange "ippp0" "ppp0" if you use a modem, not isdn):
#   iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE -o ippp0
#   echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# and additionally the following lines to get at least a minimum of security:
#   iptables -A INPUT -j DROP -m state --state NEW,INVALID -i ippp0
#   iptables -A FORWARD -j DROP -m state --state NEW,INVALID -i ippp0
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# 1.)
# Should the Firewall be started?
#
# This setting is done in /etc/rc.config (START_FW2="yes")

#
# 2.)
# Which is the interface that points to the internet/untrusted networks?
#
# Enter all the network devices here which are untrusted.
#
# Choice: any number of devices, seperated by a space
# e.g. "eth0", "ippp0 ippp1 eth0:1"
#
FW_DEV_EXT="eth0"

#
# 3.)
# Which is the interface that points to the internal network?
#
# Enter all the network devices here which are trusted.
# If you are not connected to a trusted network (e.g. you have just a
# dialup) leave this empty.
#
# Choice: leave empty or any number of devices, seperated by a space
# e.g. "tr0", "eth0 eth1 eth1:1" or ""
#
FW_DEV_INT=""

#
# 4.)
# Which is the interface that points to the dmz or dialup network?
#
# Enter all the network devices here which point to the dmz/dialups.
# A "dmz" is a special, seperated network, which is only connected to the
# firewall, and should be reachable from the internet to provide services,
# e.g. WWW, Mail, etc. and hence are at risk from attacks.
# See /usr/share/doc/packages/SuSEfirewall2/EXAMPLES for an example.
#
# Special note: You have to configure FW_FORWARD to define the services
# which should be available to the internet and set FW_ROUTE to yes.
#
# Choice: leave empty or any number of devices, seperated by a space
# e.g. "tr0", "eth0 eth1 eth1:1" or ""
#
FW_DEV_DMZ=""

#
# 5.)
# Should routing between the internet, dmz and internal network be activated?
# REQUIRES: FW_DEV_INT or FW_DEV_DMZ
#
# You need only set this to yes, if you either want to masquerade internal
# machines or allow access to the dmz (or internal machines, but this is not
# a good idea). This option supersedes IP_FORWARD from /etc/rc.config!
#
# Setting this option one alone doesn't do anything. Either activate
# massquerading with FW_MASQUERADE below if you want to masquerade your
# internal network to the internet, or configure FW_FORWARD to define
# what is allowed to be forwarded!
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "no"
#
FW_ROUTE="no"

#
# 6.)
# Do you want to masquerade internal networks to the outside?
# REQUIRES: FW_DEV_INT or FW_DEV_DMZ, FW_ROUTE
#
# "Masquerading" means that all your internal machines which use services on
# the internet seem to come from your firewall.
# Please note that it is more secure to communicate via proxies to the
# internet than masquerading. This option is required for FW_MASQ_NETS and
# FW_FORWARD_MASQ.
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "no"
#
FW_MASQUERADE="no"
#
# You must also define on which interface(s) to masquerade on. This is
# normally your external device(s) to the internet.
# Most users can leave the default below.
#
# e.g. "ippp0" or "$FW_DEV_EXT"
FW_MASQ_DEV="$FW_DEV_EXT"
#
# Which internal computers/networks are allowed to access the internet
# directly (not via proxys on the firewall)?
# Only these networks will be allowed access and will be masqueraded!
#
# Choice: leave empty or any number of hosts/networks seperated by a space.
# Every host/network may get a list of allowed services, otherwise everything
# is allowed. A target network, protocol and service is appended by a comma to
# the host/network. e.g. "10.0.0.0/8" allows the whole 10.0.0.0 network with
# unrestricted access. "10.0.1.0/24,0/0,tcp,80 10.0.1.0/24,0/0tcp,21" allows
# the 10.0.1.0 network to use www/ftp to the internet.
# "10.0.1.0/24,tcp,1024:65535 10.0.2.0/24" is OK too.
# Set this variable to "0/0" to allow unrestricted access to the internet.
#
FW_MASQ_NETS=""

#
# 7.)
# Do you want to protect the firewall from the internal network?
# REQUIRES: FW_DEV_INT
#
# If you set this to "yes", internal machines may only access services on
# the machine you explicitly allow. They will be also affected from the
# FW_AUTOPROTECT_SERVICES option.
# If you set this to "no", any user can connect (and attack) any service on
# the firewall.
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "yes"
#
# "yes" is a good choice
FW_PROTECT_FROM_INTERNAL="yes"

#
# 8.)
# Do you want to autoprotect all running network services on the firewall?
#
# If set to "yes", all network access to services TCP and UDP on this machine
# will be prevented (except to those which you explicitly allow, see below:
# FW_SERVICES_{EXT,DMZ,INT}_{TCP,UDP})
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "yes"
#
FW_AUTOPROTECT_SERVICES="yes"

#
# 9.)
# Which services ON THE FIREWALL should be accessible from either the internet
# (or other untrusted networks), the dmz or internal (trusted networks)?
# (see no.13 & 14 if you want to route traffic through the firewall) XXX
#
# Enter all ports or known portnames below, seperated by a space.
# TCP services (e.g. SMTP, WWW) must be set in FW_SERVICES_*_TCP, and
# UDP services (e.g. syslog) must be set in FW_SERVICES_*_UDP.
# e.g. if a webserver on the firewall should be accessible from the internet:
# FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="www"
# e.g. if the firewall should receive syslog messages from the dmz:
# FW_SERVICES_DMZ_UDP="syslog"
# For IP protocols (like GRE for PPTP, or OSPF for routing) you need to set
# FW_SERVICES_*_IP with the protocol name or number (see /etc/protocols)
#
# Choice: leave empty or any number of ports, known portnames (from
# /etc/services) and port ranges seperated by a space. Port ranges are
# written like this: allow port 1 to 10 -&gt; "1:10"
# e.g. "", "smtp", "123 514", "3200:3299", "ftp 22 telnet 512:514"
# For FW_SERVICES_*_IP enter the protocol name (like "igmp") or number ("2")
#
# Common: smtp domain
FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP="22 ftp ftp-data 123 23 6000:6064"
# Common: domain
FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP="123"       # Common: domain
# For VPN/Routing which END at the firewall!!
FW_SERVICES_EXT_IP=""
#
# Common: smtp domain
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_TCP=""
# Common: domain
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_UDP=""
# For VPN/Routing which END at the firewall!!
FW_SERVICES_DMZ_IP=""
#
# Common: ssh smtp domain
FW_SERVICES_INT_TCP=""
# Common: domain syslog
FW_SERVICES_INT_UDP=""
# For VPN/Routing which END at the firewall!!
FW_SERVICES_INT_IP=""

#
# 10.)
# Which services should be accessible from trusted hosts/nets?
#
# Define trusted hosts/networks (doesnt matter if they are internal or
# external) and the TCP and/or UDP services they are allowed to use.
#
# Choice: leave FW_TRUSTED_NETS empty or any number of computers and/or
# networks, seperated by a space. e.g. "172.20.1.1 172.20.0.0/16"
# Optional, enter a protocol after a comman, e.g. "1.1.1.1,icmp"
# Optional, enter a port after a protocol, e.g. "2.2.2.2,tcp,22"
#
FW_TRUSTED_NETS=""

#
# 11.)
# How is access allowed to high (unpriviliged [above 1023]) ports?
#
# You may either allow everyone from anyport access to your highports ("yes"),
# disallow anyone ("no"), anyone who comes from a defined port (portnumber or
# known portname) [note that this is easy to circumvent!], or just your
# defined nameservers ("DNS").
# Note that if you want to use normal (active) ftp, you have to set the TCP
# option to ftp-data. If you use passive ftp, you don't need that.
# Note that you can't use rpc requests (e.g. rpcinfo, showmount) as root
# from a firewall using this script (well, you can if you include range
# 600:1023 in FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP ...).
#
# Choice: "yes", "no", "DNS", portnumber or known portname, defaults to "no"
#         if not set
#
# Common: "ftp-data", better is "yes" to be sure that everything else works :-(
FW_ALLOW_INCOMING_HIGHPORTS_TCP="yes"
# Common: "DNS" or "domain ntp", better is "yes" to be sure ...
FW_ALLOW_INCOMING_HIGHPORTS_UDP="yes"

#
# 12.)
# Are you running some of the services below?
# They need special attention - otherwise they won´t work!
#
# Set services you are running to "yes", all others to "no", defaults to "no"
#
FW_SERVICE_AUTODETECT="yes"     # Autodetect the services below when starting
#
# If you are running bind/named set to yes. Remember that you have to open
# port 53 (or "domain") as udp/tcp to allow incoming queries.
# Also FW_ALLOW_INCOMING_HIGHPORTS_UDP needs to be "yes"
FW_SERVICE_DNS="no"
#
# if you use dhclient to get an ip address you have to set this to "yes" !
FW_SERVICE_DHCLIENT="no"
#
# set to "yes" if this server is a DHCP server
FW_SERVICE_DHCPD="no"
#
# set to "yes" if this server is running squid. You still have to open the
# tcp port 3128 to allow remote access to the squid proxy service.
FW_SERVICE_SQUID="no"
#
# set to "yes" if this server is running a samba server. You still have to open
# the tcp port 139 to allow remote access to SAMBA.
FW_SERVICE_SAMBA="no"

#
# 13.)
# Which services accessed from the internet should be allowed to the
# dmz (or internal network - if it is not masqueraded)?
# REQUIRES: FW_ROUTE
#
# With this option you may allow access to e.g. your mailserver. The
# machines must have valid, non-private, IP addresses which were assigned to
# you by your ISP. This opens a direct link to your network, so only use
# this option for access to your dmz!!!!
#
# Choice: leave empty (good choice!) or use the following explained syntax
# of forwarding rules, seperated each by a space.
# A forwarding rule consists of 1) source IP/net and 2) destination IP
# seperated by a comma. e.g. "1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2 3.3.3.3/16,4.4.4.4/24"
# Optional is a protocol, seperated by a comma, e.g. "5.5.5.5,6.6.6.6,igmp"
# Optional is a port after the protocol with a comma, e.g. "0/0,0/0,udp,514"
#
FW_FORWARD=""           # Beware to use this!

#
# 14.)
# Which services accessed from the internet should be allowed to masqueraded
# servers (on the internal network or dmz)?
# REQUIRES: FW_ROUTE
#
# With this option you may allow access to e.g. your mailserver. The
# machines must be in a masqueraded segment and may not have public IP addesses!
# Hint: if FW_DEV_MASQ is set to the external interface you have to set
# FW_FORWARD from internal to DMZ for the service as well to allow access
# from internal!
#
# Please note that this should *not* be used for security reasons! You are
# opening a hole to your precious internal network. If e.g. the webserver there
# is compromised - your full internal network is compromised!!
#
# Choice: leave empty (good choice!) or use the following explained syntax
# of forward masquerade rules, seperated each by a space.
# A forward masquerade rule consists of 1) source IP/net, 2) destination IP
# (dmz/intern), 3) a protocol (tcp/udp only!) and 4) destination port,
# seperated by a comma (","), e.g. "4.0.0.0/8,1.1.1.1,tcp,80"
# Optional is a port after the destination port, to redirect the request to
# a different destination port on the destination IP, e.g.
# "4.0.0.0/8,1.1.1.1,tcp,80,81"
#
FW_FORWARD_MASQ=""              # Beware to use this!

#
# 15.)
# Which accesses to services should be redirected to a localport on the
# firewall machine?
#
# This can be used to force all internal users to surf via your squid proxy,
# or transparently redirect incoming webtraffic to a secure webserver.
# 
# Choice: leave empty or use the following explained syntax of redirecting
# rules, seperated by a space.
# A redirecting rule consists of 1) source IP/net, 2) destination IP/net,
# 3) protocol (tcp or udp) 3) original destination port and 4) local port to
# redirect the traffic to, seperated by a colon. e.g.:
# "10.0.0.0/8,0/0,tcp,80,3128 0/0,172.20.1.1,tcp,80,8080"
#
FW_REDIRECT=""

#
# 16.)
# Which logging level should be enforced?
# You can define to log packets which were accepted or denied.
# You can also the set log level, the critical stuff or everything.
# Note that logging *_ALL is only for debugging purpose ...
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", FW_LOG_*_CRIT defaults to "yes",
# FW_LOG_*_ALL defaults to "no"
#
FW_LOG_DROP_CRIT="yes"
#
FW_LOG_DROP_ALL="no"

# 17.)
# Do you want to enable additional kernel TCP/IP security features?
# If set to yes, some obscure kernel options are set.

# if everything still works. (It should!) ;-)
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "yes"
#
FW_KERNEL_SECURITY="yes"

#
# 18.)
# Keep the routing set on, if the firewall rules are unloaded?
# REQUIRES: FW_ROUTE
#
# If you are using diald, or automatic dialing via ISDN, if packets need
# to be sent to the internet, you need to turn this on. The script will then
# not turn off routing and masquerading when stopped.
# You *might* also need this if you have got a DMZ.
# Please note that this is *insecure*! If you unload the rules, but are still
# connected, you might your internal network open to attacks!
# The better solution is to remove "/sbin/SuSEfirewall2 stop" or
# "/sbin/init.d/firewall stop" from the ip-down script!
#
#
# Choices "yes" or "no", defaults to "no"
#
FW_STOP_KEEP_ROUTING_STATE="no"

#
# 19.)
# Allow (or don't) ICMP echo pings on either the firewall or the dmz from
# the internet? The internet option is for allowing the DMZ and the internal
# network to ping the internet.
# REQUIRES: FW_ROUTE for FW_ALLOW_PING_DMZ and FW_ALLOW_PING_INTERNET

#
# 20.)
# Allow (or don't) ICMP time-to-live-exceeded to be send from your firewall.
# This is used for traceroutes to your firewall (or traceroute like tools).
#
# Please note that the unix traceroute only works if you say "yes" to

#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "no"
#
FW_ALLOW_FW_TRACEROUTE="yes"

#
# 21.)
# Allow ICMP sourcequench from your ISP?
#
# If set to yes, the firewall will notice when connection is choking, however
# this opens yourself to a denial of service attack. Choose your poison.
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "yes"
#
FW_ALLOW_FW_SOURCEQUENCH="yes"

#
# 22.)
# Allow/Ignore IP Broadcasts?
#
# If set to yes, the firewall will not filter broadcasts by default.
# This is needed e.g. for Netbios/Samba, RIP, OSPF where the broadcast
# option is used.
# If you do not want to allow them however ignore the annoying log entries,
# set FW_IGNORE_FW_BROADCAST to yes.
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "no"
#
FW_ALLOW_FW_BROADCAST="no"
#
FW_IGNORE_FW_BROADCAST="yes"

#
# 23.)
# Allow same class routing per default?
# REQUIRES: FW_ROUTE
#
# Do you want to allow routing between interfaces of the same class
# (e.g. between all internet interfaces, or all internal network interfaces)
# be default (so without the need setting up FW_FORWARD definitions)?
#
# Choice: "yes" or "no", defaults to "no"
