&gt; Hi List,
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if I should be going 'whoopee' or 'bugger'. I have played
&gt; around with the cables all afternoon, and now, strangely, what didn't work
&gt; before now works. I have the output from the amp now coming from the
&gt; line-out (rec to the tape deck.) It is producing an excellent signal, clean
&gt; and very true to source. This is where I started, except that it didn't
&gt; work. Now by magic, it works perfectly! I not complain, just wonder!
&gt;
&gt; The system now is:
&gt; Vinyl LP
&gt; Denon turntable
&gt; Toshiba amp
&gt; Vibra 128 soundcard
&gt; Rhino12 MB with Cyrix PR200 CPU
&gt; Linux Mandrake 8.2 OS
&gt; sox -c2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track&lt;nn&gt;.wav
&gt; XCDRoast
&gt; CDR
&gt; Cheap CD player and amp
&gt; Krix MF2 speakers
&gt; Me
&gt;
&gt; The difference between the source LP and the CD, played on my
&gt; bits-and-pieces System, is small indeed, certainly very acceptable for a
&gt; conversion of the collection. I will add a 'pop-and-hiss' filter this week
&gt; as the final link, and the result will probably be that playing the
&gt; resulting CDs will be better, as far as the ear goes, than playing the
&gt; original vinyls. That means the vinyl will go back in storage. They have
&gt; hardly been played at all, they were cut straight to tape when we bought
&gt; them, to preserve the originals. I wonder what I will be doing with them in
&gt; another thirty years, if I live to eighty.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks list for your inputs, tolerance and patience. I am now listeneing to
&gt; the 'Bushwackers Band - Dance Album' as I cut it over to WAVs. A glass of
&gt; Oz bubbly in hand. Celebrating twenty nine years of marriage today. Not bad
&gt; for a first go.
&gt;
&gt; Last chapter next week sometime when the filters get applied.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
