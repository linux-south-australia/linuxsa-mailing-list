Well - I have good News for you from the USA.

I had a similar situation arise and

BEOS was able to read and recover the data. It is VERY STRONG at boot
management, friendly installs as well as reading other file systems.

The Be company has gone out of business, but I have a copy of BEos, and can
burn you a copy if need be.


Best,

Subject: [OT] Data recovery


&gt; Hi,
&gt;     Can anyone help , tell me how, or suggest a firm in adelaide that
&gt; can retrieve data from a HDD.
&gt;
&gt; The basic Story.
&gt;
&gt; Basically the system was running windows me
&gt; The computer was left on for several days and went into sleep mode from
&gt; which it did not recover
&gt; It was turned off
&gt; On reboot it initially booted into safe mode and named several files it
&gt; required to continue, including I believe several .vxd files from the
&gt; windows folder.
&gt; On later attempts it return io error and would not reboot
&gt;
&gt; The problem, you guessed it all their info for their home business is on
&gt; this disc,  backed up onto the second partition of the same disc. As far
&gt; as I know there were only two partitions on a 2 Gb maxtor HDD c: & d:
&gt;
&gt; My progress,
&gt;
&gt; 1. Removed from system and used another HDD. System now boots with no
&gt; problem
&gt; 2. Put into original system as second HDD recognised by bios but not
&gt; accessable
&gt; 3. Put it into my system (Mandrake) using HDD conf tools HDD is
&gt; recognised but shows no partition
&gt;         info indicates freespace.
&gt; 4. Tried Mandrakes partition recovery tool returns failure
&gt; 5. Tried internet for hints, mostly found expensive recovery tools
&gt; 6. Tried Win-98 boot disk with additional tools recognises HDD but
&gt; prompts for partitioning and formatting.
&gt; 7. Tried older dos tools
&gt; 8. Tried older redhat tools - lots of reading 'cos i've never used these
&gt; before
&gt; 9. Tried a friends winXP inbuilt disc management
&gt;
&gt; Basically all the above return similar results, ie No partitions found
&gt; and prompt for new partitions naturally I'm reluctant to do this as I
&gt; dont want to ruin any data that might be retrievable. So far I've only
&gt; used tools that attempt to read existing data and not allowed anything
&gt; to write to the disk.
&gt;
&gt; Naturally if I was able to use a linux tool to safely retrieve their
&gt; data, I'd be ecstatic not to mention them.
&gt; However, I really don't care what the means are, so any suggestions are
&gt; welcome.
&gt;     note, I did suggest a round of torture for the person that used this
&gt; method of backup, to continue until they remembered every keystroke of
&gt; the info backed up. (They politely refused the offer)
&gt; Failing that, as I said at the beginning if there is a reputable firm
&gt; that doesn't cost the earth or someone has the tools to do it
&gt; themselves. Make me an offer, and I'll talk to them on your behalf.
&gt;
&gt; David Delyn.
&gt; ps They're just getting the business of the ground so money is still
&gt; pretty tight.
&gt; Especially when some their billing data is unavailable.
