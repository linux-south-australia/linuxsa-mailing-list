Hi,

I've inherited the admining of a small LAN consisting of a Samba PDC and
around 40 Win98SE clients.

The problem I have is that group policies does not want to work.

The setup I am trying to create is three basic groups that user's belong
to. The groups define which shares they have rights to and what logon
script they are assigned. This all works perfectly.

However I also wish to have one of those groups have a very restricted
desktop by using a policy template (config.pol) to assign group
policies.

According to what little documentation I have found on the net, Samba
(At least 2.07) does not support assigning policies through groups in
config.pol. But supposedly user based allocations works fine, e.g. a
user object created for each username which logins into the PDC.

So I have followed a hack mentioned on several web pages. 

They suggest creating different basic config.pol (With just a Default
Computer and Default User entry) files and then allocating a different
netlogon share based on the user's group ID. Each of these different
netlogon shares contain is a different basic config.pol in order to
differentiate between policy settings.

This all sounds great but it doesn't work for me :(

Details:

Samba v2.2.2
Win98 Second Edition clients with grouppol.dll.

config.pol created by running poledit.exe on one of the clients and
choosing a new file. I then modified the default entries created with
the new file (Default Computer and Default User entries).

Samba can see the correct GID when a user is logged in:

&gt;&gt;&gt;
bar# smbstatus

Samba version 2.2.2
Service      uid      gid      pid     machine

No locked files
&lt;&lt;&lt;

Permissions for the config.pol match those for login scripts and allow
read access to the users.

Samba is also allocating the correct login share and the correct login
script. It's just that config.pol is not affecting the clients.

Does any Samba gurus have any advice, explanations, answers or critism?
:)

This is really bugging me.

Cheers
Martin
