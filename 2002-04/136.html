&gt;&gt; Hi LinuxSA,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd just like to let you all know that I'm stupid.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And that by telling you all is penance.
&gt;
&gt; Well we all so stupid things...
&gt;
&gt; I remember a year back I had just started a new job and I noticed that
&gt; the previous joker they had for a sys admin wasn't doing backups, so I
&gt; wrote a tempory backup script, everything was to be backed up to a
&gt; directory before transfered to tape. Anyhow the script was in perl and
&gt; instead of using unlink to remove the old backup files I used 'system
&gt; "/bin/rm -f $BACKUPDIR/*"', But my bigest mistake was a typo when
&gt; defining the $BACKUPDIR at the top of the script and the $BACKUPDIR
&gt; variable was left empty.
&gt;
&gt; Did I test this first? NO
&gt; Did I run this on a production machine without testing? YES
&gt;
&gt; I'm just glad I used "rm -f" as I was going to use "rm -rf".  Would of
&gt; made my first week at work interesting if I did...

Decades ago I was working on a Tandem machine with a rather primitive
shell.  When it encountered an error, it would just come out with the
number, so you needed to learn that ENOENT was "FILE SYSTEM ERROR
011".  People didn't like that, so I hacked the shell binary to call a
function which loaded an error message text from a file and printed
that instead.

That meant, of course, that I needed a utility to update the file,
because plain text files hadn't been invented yet.  So I tested this
program, and for error 11 I wrote "File not found".  Then to test it I
changed the text, to (translated into UNIX) "Please enter 'rm -rf *'".

I giggled about that for a while, and was just about ready to change
it back again, when our project manager came to me and said
"Mr. Lehey, I think I've done something stupid".

Fortunately, it was early in the morning, and we did religious backups
every evening, so he really didn't lose very much.

Greg
