Hi,
    Can anyone help , tell me how, or suggest a firm in adelaide that
can retrieve data from a HDD.

The basic Story.

Basically the system was running windows me
The computer was left on for several days and went into sleep mode from
which it did not recover
It was turned off
On reboot it initially booted into safe mode and named several files it
required to continue, including I believe several .vxd files from the
windows folder.
On later attempts it return io error and would not reboot

The problem, you guessed it all their info for their home business is on
this disc,  backed up onto the second partition of the same disc. As far
as I know there were only two partitions on a 2 Gb maxtor HDD c: & d:

My progress,

1. Removed from system and used another HDD. System now boots with no
problem
2. Put into original system as second HDD recognised by bios but not
accessable
3. Put it into my system (Mandrake) using HDD conf tools HDD is
recognised but shows no partition
        info indicates freespace.
4. Tried Mandrakes partition recovery tool returns failure
5. Tried internet for hints, mostly found expensive recovery tools
6. Tried Win-98 boot disk with additional tools recognises HDD but
prompts for partitioning and formatting.
7. Tried older dos tools
8. Tried older redhat tools - lots of reading 'cos i've never used these
before
9. Tried a friends winXP inbuilt disc management

Basically all the above return similar results, ie No partitions found
and prompt for new partitions naturally I'm reluctant to do this as I
dont want to ruin any data that might be retrievable. So far I've only
used tools that attempt to read existing data and not allowed anything
to write to the disk.

Naturally if I was able to use a linux tool to safely retrieve their
data, I'd be ecstatic not to mention them.
However, I really don't care what the means are, so any suggestions are
welcome.
    note, I did suggest a round of torture for the person that used this
method of backup, to continue until they remembered every keystroke of
the info backed up. (They politely refused the offer)
Failing that, as I said at the beginning if there is a reputable firm
that doesn't cost the earth or someone has the tools to do it
themselves. Make me an offer, and I'll talk to them on your behalf.

David Delyn.
ps They're just getting the business of the ground so money is still
pretty tight.
Especially when some their billing data is unavailable.
