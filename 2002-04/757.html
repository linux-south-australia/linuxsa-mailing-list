Ben,

Here is my 2c:

I have used openLDAP as a personnel directory previously in a medium size 
organisation (200+) people with Outlook clients + a web "phone book" type 
app. It worked very well and was reliable. These are some of my thoughts, for 
what they are worth:

1 .. If someone just needs a "phone book/contacts" type Intra/Internet page 
then LDAP is probably too much hassle - there lready a heap of apps out there 
that do this with a lightweight and/or SQL db backend.

2 .. LDAP is good for email client address lookup/completion etc (Outlook can 
use it "out the box" - Netscape used to suppoprt it, Mozilla might (have not 
tried) and KDE 3 KMail addressbook is supposed to have "pluggable" backends 
that do/will support LDAP).  LDAP supports updates, so if all phone/contact 
etc information fits in the LDAP directory, then you could use that solely, 
and have Web directory front end that "speaks" to the LDAP backend via one of 
the higher level language bindings (I used Perl, I am sure there are others, 
eg PHP). Since the LDAP protocol supports updates, the Web front end could do 
both query and update (presumably for admins), converting them to the LDAP 
"protocol".

3 .. The most interesting and versatile, but probably "hardest" to implement 
- If your want the directory to be a subset of an existing full blown 
database (eg the org has one SQL database with all employee records, contact 
numbers etc etc, which is not a goot fit for complete conversion to an LDAP 
dir), you can then write a "backend" for openLDAP that converts the LDAP 
queries into SQL queries, and can map SQL table/field names to LDAP 
attributes. This way you can use a Web front end to a "normal" SQL database 
(with all the existing tools) and still get the LDAP directory features in 
your email clients etc. As a bonus there are no syncronisation issues, as the 
LDAP directory gets all its info from the master SQL database.

In most circumstances (3) only needs "read-only" access to the SQL db, so it 
can be done quite quickly. The backend API also supports LDAP "write" access, 
but this may need more work to implement. "quite quicky" means 1-2 days if 
bindings are available in a language you are comfortable in.

Note that the backend does not have to be SQL, it can be any form of 
name./address storage which is available programatically that you wish to 
present as an LDAP directory. Access is almost certainly going to be slower 
than the native LDAP db (and a custom backend takes more resources), but if 
both are managable, then it can be a good way to go.

Andrew
