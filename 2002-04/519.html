Hi all,

Some time ago, I had an issue where a freeBSD box wouldn't auto-detect
two identical drives as being the same geometry. Well, it's happenning
again, but this time, I think I know what's causing it... The drives, in
this case, are on separate IDE channels, both as slaves. On the primary
channel, the master is an older (ATA66 or ATA33) HDD, and on the
secondary channel, the master is a CDROM drive. The one on the secondary
is being detected with a massively reduced number of cylinders, which
ends up restricting the capacity to about 6G (should be ~40G). The one
on the primary gets detected with heaps more cylinders, and a filesystem
there has 35G capacity (which I assume is about right, given HDD
manufacturer's interpretation of powers of 2, and filesystem overhead).
This is approximately the same as I experienced on the FreeBSD machine,
though I seem to recall it detecting the correct size, but wrong
geometry in that case (it was a newer machine, and a newer HDD).

Anyway, does anyone know (or have a reference that can tell me) what
kind of interference one can get on IDE channels? for eg, I'm pretty
sure that the fact that I'm mixing an ATA33 and an ATA100 drive on an
ATA33 channel shouldn't matter (though the ATA100 drive will just run at
ATA33 speed, right?)... I'm using an ATA66 80-core ribbon... Then
there's the whole variety of PIO and UDMA modes and so on... I'd really
like to know what I should be seeing on this machine given the
combination of IDE devices...


Also, on a related note, I can't figure out how to get into the BIOS of
this machine. It's made by "LODIN", and comes up with a big splash
screen when you'd normally see BIOS, and I can't figure how to actually
access the BIOS -- I've tried del, esc, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f12, and
f10, along with b, space, ctl-break, break, and others (I got bored
after a while)... Anyone got any other ideas, or has used a similar
LODIN machine before and know the trick?

TIA
