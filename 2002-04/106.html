I just thought I'd jump back on the openoffice bandwagon. I saw it get
mentioned on here that it was out and was good, but this seems to happen
on a regular basis, and every time i've tryed it it has been unstable. 
But now with build 641d (and I see now there is a build 642 on
planetmirror as well) this has changed.

We have a large .doc file (4.7mb) with heaps of tables, references,
graphics etc etc. This file is so full on that sometimes when editing it
in word, words internal memory management gets corrupted and the doc
gets trashed. This is the file ive been testing open office with, and
every build till now has crashed with it.

But - 641d loaded it fine, edited it, and was fast. All the images,
tables and everything were fine, and the only stuff that didnt work was
some embedded visio docs that just had a big jigsaw piece icon there,
presumably because displaying an embedded viso object is asking too
much! (fair enough, its not meant to replace visio).

So, I grabbed the windows version of open office, and tryed that and it
worked perfectly too. Everytime I use it puts me in a good mood - I
didnt think the authors would be able to fix it so well in such a short
time. 

If you have been holding off, thinking openoffice is unstable, slow, and
"would be good if only it worked", now is the time to grab a copy and
try it again! Working, feature rich office apps on linux - YAY! :) :)

..anyway back to my document..
