Hi David, 

As far as firms that do data recovery in Adelaide go I don't know
of any, but I have seen data retreival done successfully many times
using file recovery software.

Since the of being used was XP I'm assuming that the partition was 
formatted using NTFS and not FAT32. Sorry that I cant tell you of 
any Linux tools that can do the job, unless you want to do it 
manually. I don't really know anything about manual recovery though
other that it takes AGES and is very nasty to do.

The only software that does NTFS that I know of is Easy Recovery Pro 
by ontrack. www.ontrack.com

Easy Recovery does FAT32 but only the Pro version does NTFS.

While what I have seen people do with this program do is pretty
good, (can retrieve reguardless of corrupt partition table or not) 
if the fileyou want has ben even partially overwritten the chances 
of retrieving a non corrupted file are not good. The other downer 
is that the software is damn expensive. $489 US for the pro version.

However, there is a free demo of the pro version on Ontracks site,
which allows you to see what files you COULD recover if you purchased
the full copy.

If you want to test it out here is the URL to the trial copy.

Hope this helps,
