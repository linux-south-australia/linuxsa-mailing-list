&gt; &gt; Sorry for the off topic post, we are going to buy some gigabit cards for
&gt; &gt; all our servers. What is the best brand to buy that works well with
&gt; &gt; Linux and (sorry to mention) winnt/2k/xp? I've heard that the gigabit
&gt; &gt; 'server' cards are way more expensive that a standard card. so i guess
&gt; &gt; my question is does it pay to buy cheap gigabit cards for servers or am
&gt; &gt; i asking for trouble? any suggestions on brands to buy/avoid?
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, the more expensive cards may not be better.  The first generation
&gt; of GbE cards were very expensive.  The newer generation are much less
&gt; expensive.  So the better card may also be the cheaper card.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, the original "Intel Pro/1000 Server" is more expensive than
&gt; the later and better "Intel Pro/1000 Server F" or "Intel Pro 1000 Server
&gt; T".
&gt; 
&gt; There is a "client" versus "server" distinction.  This does count.  The
&gt; server cards have some useful features (like much more buffer memory)  
&gt; and some dubious features (like on-board TCP checksumming)[1].  You might
&gt; also find two versions of the server card, a really expensive one with
&gt; IPSec support and a cheaper one with no on-baord crypto (on-board crypto
&gt; is worthwhile, but only if you run IPSec).
&gt; 
&gt; Benchmark tests across the past two years (but for Windows NT) have
&gt; consistently given the throughput ranking Intel, 3Com, SysKonnect.
&gt; 
&gt; Linux driver support varies, but is improving all the time.  The Broadcom
&gt; chipset is supported, but not nicely enough for me (this chipset is used
&gt; in the 3Com card).  The Intel and SysKonnect cards seem to have better


Horses for courses. Broadcom is supplying us with header-splitting 
firmware, which may go all the way up to the SMB header for some SMBs :-)

Which also means we want the checksumming code on the chips, at least in 
the receive direction.

&gt; drivers, both are vendor-sponsored open source.  Unfortunately at the
&gt; moment you can expect some driver issues regardless of your choice of
&gt; card.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to get the most from your GbE card you'll also need about
&gt; another 128MB of memory.  At GbE speeds you can really eat through
&gt; buffers.
&gt; 
&gt; Glen
&gt; 
&gt; [1] On-board TCP checksumming makes a lot of sense until you
&gt;     read research into the causes of faulty packets caught by
&gt;     the TCP checksum.  It turns out that 50% of the packets
&gt;     were corrupted on their way from the CPU to the NIC.  So
&gt;     moving the checksumming from CPU to NIC allows much more
&gt;     data corruption.  It's clear that it is the CPU, not the
&gt;     NIC card, that needs the hardware TCP checksum.

Can you cite the papers? This is an interesting topic. 50% of how many 
packets. What was the actual corruption rate?
