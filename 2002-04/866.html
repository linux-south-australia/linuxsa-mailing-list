I am not 100% sure about FreeBSD installation on a laptop but thought I
would share my experiences and fustrations of trying to get linux on my IBM
Thinkpad 760E laptop (no CDROM either !)

Here is a rough outline of the process I have gleaned so far.....

-     You need to build yourself four disks to start a network install of
 linux.
-     You will need a Boot Disk, Root Disk, PCMCIA supplimental disk and a
 Network disk.
-     You boot the machine with the first two disks, use the PCMCIA
 supplimental disk to get that subsystem enabled, then use the network disk
 to get a hold of your ethernet card.
-     If this all *happens* nicely (ie everything is auto detected) you
 will be away, If you are unlucky or your ethernet card is not detected you
 will be in for long nights with copious amounts of coffee required.
-     From here you can follow the standard install program (off the root
 disk) which will require either NFS or FTP to grab the packages to
 install.

Note that I have not got passed the network disk yet with my IBM due to the
fact my standard distros Slackware 7 & 8,or RH 6.2,7 & 7.2 have a fairly
out of date PCMCIA_CS package built into the network/pcmcia floppy disks.
My suggestion is to check the Linux PCMCIA website
(<A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/">http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/</A>) to see if your Accton is supported.

I have three PCMCIA network cards IBM EtherJet 10-T, IBM Ethercard II and a
Xircom CBE2-100 all of which are not supported under v 3.1.26, but I have
since found out they are supported under 3.1.33.

So I am about to try a floppy install of Slackware 7 (only 23 floppies
required) from there I should be able to get everything running.   I of
course could have taken the other approach and built a later version of the
pcmcia disk and used the updated drivers, the is also the LFS option
aswell... So I am not stuck yet only waiting to gain courage to tackle the
new problems.

I am hoping to bolt this unit into the car for a bit of Satellite
navigation.   I already have a GPS permanently mounted for other purposes
(amateur radio related) and found a package called GPSDrive.   This package
will hopefully will allow me to use either my UBD maps or Topo Maps of
Adelaide on the Laptop to help me pilot my 4WD around !   At least that is
my story and I am sticking to it !

Matthew.
