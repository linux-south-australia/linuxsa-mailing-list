Ben

&gt; that's an encouraging sentence. what was the (1) appended to this?

(1) But there are some companies who won't use OpenSource no matter how 
stable, wonderful or well supported it is...even when those companies 
techos KNOW that it is the best solution for the job

&gt; i think the questions i'm asking are more along the lines of how easy is
&gt; it to administer programmatically (probably using something like php or
&gt; java)

I've seen PHP and Java API's that even a person like me can understand. 
I don't claim to be a programmer, but I have done PHP and other work in 
the past. LDAP's been around a while now and these tools have enough 
developers to make the low-level API interface "someone else's problem".

&gt; and how reliable is it in terms of does it crash with large
&gt; client load (for some definition of large), is it secure, and so on
&gt; (like your first group). admininstration would be almost purely from an
&gt; interface like php.

Before writing your own interface, check <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/">http://freshmeat.net/</A> for an 
interface that might be useful to you. I've seen a number of them about.

&gt; the task involves publishing the contact details on a web page, but i
&gt; was thinking if it's not a massive job to install/configure/maintain an
&gt; LDAP directory, it could be a nice add-on for them (access it from
&gt; outlook etc). if it takes 3 weeks to configure and work out how to
&gt; dynamically update, then i don't want to do it. if it takes installing
&gt; an rpm or 3 and a few lines of code to update the LDAP at the same time
&gt; as the main DB, then it'd be perfect.

Talk to Matt Geddes (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:mgeddes@tellurian.com.au">mgeddes@tellurian.com.au</A>) because he's our 
"onsite LDAP extert" and has had experience in setting it up and can 
comment on the questions you're asking.

He's busy at the moment but he's normally quite approachable.
