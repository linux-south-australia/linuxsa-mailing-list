&gt; I am feeling a little nervous and self conscious right now 
&gt; because I have never done this sort of thing before.

I think most people feel like that when they do it first time... :)

&gt; 
&gt; Right now, I think my guide may be too specific on some 
&gt; issues but not explain enough about other issues, and may not 
&gt; be "ready for the world" yet. But I want to do everything to 
&gt; get this right.

For sure... Don't worry too much about it -- if it's entirely crap, and
not worth the electrons it was downloaded on, someone will tell you (or
you'll have complete silence), and no-one will think any worse of you,
and at least you had a go. Most likely, it will be somewhere on the way
to being something useful, and you may get some useful input from other
points of view... Either way, nothing's lost, and at least you had a
go... :)

&gt; 
&gt; I also do not need to stick to the approach that I used. I 
&gt; basicly said  - use Mandrake and follow my instructions. Were 
&gt; going to set this up in a simple but insecure way, but as you 
&gt; get more skills, tweak it to suit your needs -

Sure -- it's probably ideal if you can get other people's input,
possibly using some pre-existing documentation, to generalise it a
little ... but then again, specific doco on how to do X in Y distro can
be useful...

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I am really expecting that there will be a number of 
&gt; changes to this thing and if there is, and if by some stroke 
&gt; of luck it ends up being on the Samba site, I guess all I can 
&gt; say is that I am going to GPL or copyleft the guide. Well 
&gt; actually, if I get any help from the group, I think that that 
&gt; is probably the only right thing for me to do.

Great -- share the fun :)

&gt; 
&gt; As far as formats are concerned...does anyone like Star Office?

Personally, no... :)

I think the most popular formats are:

Plain Text
HTML
PDF
PostScript
Others (StarOffice, Word, LaTeX, DocBook, etc)

Many people use the formats (or tools) on the bottom line to actually do
the editing, but distribute in a selection of the top four formats...

&gt; 
&gt; I also think that I can set up a place for downloads in the 
&gt; next few days. It will be an unusual spot as I do not have a 
&gt; tech-like web site at my disposal.

tech-like? Doesn't matter what sort of site it is, you just need access
(and permission) to post a document there, and to be able to send a URL
to the list... doesn't need to be integrated in to any site at this
stage -- particularly if you're not sure that you are ready to release
it yet...
