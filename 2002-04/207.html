Hi,
    Thanks to all.

I tried all the suggested programs, unfortunately to no avail.
Though the linux tools went further than anything else

Until I found this site

<A HREF="http://users.iafrica.com/c/cq/cquirke/recovery.htm">http://users.iafrica.com/c/cq/cquirke/recovery.htm</A>

which mentions

First thing to do is exclude a CIH virus payload, because there's an 
excellent CIH recovery tool available for free from <A HREF="http://www.grc.com">http://www.grc.com</A> ; 
it's a very cautious tool, and won't operate on a drive unless it 
recognizes the situation as pure, unmodifies CIH damage. So you don't 
want to make any changes first!

The site www.grc.com has a freeware dos 20k program (fix-CIH.exe) that 
determines if a HDD has this problem and then proceeds to recover the 
partition info for you. This has now been running for 12 hours and has 
recovered the first drive partition, recognised the others and is half 
way through the second partition. Looks promising.
 (Slow but very thorough, runs on a byte by byte heuristic scan )
Does all the recognition work as read only. Committing writes only if 
you are satisfied with the outcome.

A list of all his freeware is also available at 
 <A HREF="http://grc.com/freepopular.htm">http://grc.com/freepopular.htm</A>

Now part of my windoze boot disk (Actually I use UBD ), and I grabbed 
several of his other freeware tools too.

ps note his program does not remove the virus.
You still need virus software to do that after you get the disk back in 
working order.
