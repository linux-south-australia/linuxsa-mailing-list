&gt;If people read the instructions and followed the
&gt;directions there would be a lot less questions even
&gt;on this list. Linux folks love documentation because
&gt;they know the current Linux communitites won't
&gt;help you if you haven't read it.
&gt;
&gt;The moment Linux becomes "click and point" (i.e. you
&gt;can do stuff without having to understand the concepts
&gt;of what you are doing) then it's possible that Linux
&gt;users will become as useless as other users.

Yeah but hang about...  you can't *always* just learn how something works by
reading about it...

I wanted to tackle linux (as a long-time Windoze user, as well as being
familiar with command line syntax, basic networking concepts, and a
rudimentary understanding of the linux architecture), however I found it
very frustrating trying to track down any literature that could teach me
anything WITHOUT having to give me a really basic beginner-style tutorial of
how to install linux (which doesn't help you learn terribly much), how to
configure X, or how to set a browser up.  Upon looking in the HOWTO's I got
greeted with all kinds of glorious guff that sort of made a bit of sense to
me, but didn't always translate through to specific use-cases for my
situation.  I tried asking questions and learning some fundamentals, but in
the end just spat the dummy and went for FreeBSD (which I now ALSO can't get
my teeth into).

Anyway, the POINT of what I was trying to say was that if the linux
community ruled the world then you'd probably be able to get your driver's
license by correspondence.
