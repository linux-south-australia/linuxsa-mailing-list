<H1>RPM dependencies and RedHat Advisories... rant</H1>

<PRE>
If Redhat insist on using a package management tool which sucks, I which they
would at least tell you how to get around the problems in their advisories.

When they released the updated version of the printconf tools, they added Omni
to the dependencies of ghostview.  In their advisory
(<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-138.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-138.html</A>) it said to download
all the RPMs and run 'rpm -Fvh [filenames]'.  But if you don't have Omni
installed then it doesn't work as 'rpm -F' will only update packages which are
already installed.  The default 7.2 install didn't install Omni so all of my
work machines failed if I followed the advisory instructions.  In this case it
was simple to overcome by installing Omni first, so why doesn't the advisory
say this??

This happened again when they released new RPM RPMs recently.
  <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHEA-2002-024.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHEA-2002-024.html</A>
except this time the solution was far from clear.  

How are newbies suppose to do this when even the instructions from the vendor
are not clear?  Do they have to use Redhat's up2date and ignore the advisories?

It also seems to me that RPM needs another, option similar to freshen '-F',
which installs packages which aren't installed but are required to be installed
by packages which _are_ being upgraded. eg. Omni is not installed but is
required by the new version of ghostscript (which is install) so install it
anyway.  Does anything like this exist?

Regards,
Michael
