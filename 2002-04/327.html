FInally back on line,
    The recovery process was unfortunately only nearly successful, due 
to the persistance of the viruses on the system.
The HDD now works but the Data is Stuffed

It went like this
I placed the HDD in a machine with no other drives booted from floppy
fix-cih found and replaced the partitions
I had one succesful boot
Took the HDD from this machine to another to run antivirus and retrieve 
the data

On boot the partitions were again gone
checked in the original machine, wouldn't boot again either
fixcih refused a second run as their was now no first or second table to 
work from
on further enquiry it appears the new tables written and the old tables 
had now both been corrupted
back to my machine and tried gpart (and several others) only gpart read 
anything
Gave me 4 partitions of size 0 starting at point zero.

On a hunch ran antivirus(linux) with fix disabled, against the HDD even 
though it supposedly wouldnt mount and had no partitions
reported
    massive infections
            - cih and two other viruses with similar names
            - I didn't reord the actual figures but roughly worked out 
as follows
                    - all files on second partition unrecoverable 
(figures this was the Data)
                    - about 300 files on first partition recoverable 
(seem to be scanner/ photoeditor files) All found on cd anyway
                    - All other files infected 60% unrecoverable, 
unrecoverable includes all windows, office and myob files
