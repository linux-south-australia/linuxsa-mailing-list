&gt; Because jumping down list members throats is likely to turn people away
&gt; from Linux. David is rude to new users, this is unacceptable to me.

But does it?

&gt; I turned away from Linux 3 years ago as a result of dealing with feral
&gt; Linux users, their egos and rtfm answers. The more popular Linux gets,
&gt; the worse the community treats new users. Look to lists such as
&gt; freebsd-questions for an idea of how a huge maillist can work to
&gt; actually help new users.

That's an unfair comparison. The LinuxSA mailing list is not the same as
the freebsd-questions list and they have different charters. And yes, I
believe some time in the past I've lurked on the freebsd-questions list
(until I got sunk by all the e-mails I was getting).

&gt; David, you are an embarrassment and have probably been responsible for
&gt; dozens, perhaps even hundreds of Linux users turning away.

No figures of which you can objectively prove. What I will say, though,
is that every user that I have perceived I might have actually
frightened away from the community I have actively attempted to get back
into the community, most of the times with success.

I wonder whether there are more desktop Linux users than FreeBSD
users...

*hmmm*

;-P
