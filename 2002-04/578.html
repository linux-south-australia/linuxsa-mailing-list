Quoting Steve Nicholls &lt;<A HREF="mailto:gl1500@internode.on.net">gl1500@internode.on.net</A>&gt;:

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; then we have the fundamental orifice ... lets call our "THEDSL". 
&gt; Ours appears to need surgical help, it is either blocked or very badly 
&gt; swollen either from its own perceived importance or just a lack of 
&gt; understanding where it belongs in the scheme of things. 

Hi Steve (and list),

I'd like to come out in support of DSL.  Sure there's behaviours and opinions 
that some subset of the group may not like[0], but there are a few things worth 
considering:  

a) DSL has been on-list for a long time and been very helpful to a lot of 
newcomers.  I remember occasions where he has travelled to a newbie's house to 
help them fix XYZ.
b) DSL has always supported LinuxSA events.
c) DSL has encouraged us the list to keep on topic.
d) DSL does technically unique things[1] which are of interest to a lot of 
people on list.

So I guess what I'm saying is to tolerate the bad stuff and enjoy the good 
stuff.  Hitting delete in your MUA isn't hard.  DSL's part of the Adelaide *nix 
community, and while existing at the eccentic end of the spectrum, he's good 
value.  

Let's not go down the path of further persecution - there's never been 
moderation here, nor forceable removel either[2].  Let's keep it that way.

Can we get back on topic now :-)

Michael...
[0] Maybe the subset = the whole.
[1] Using XFS when it's not in Linus' kernel yet.  Ick.  Writing serious 
documentation in (buggy) DocBook.  Ouch.
[2] Well, there's "Chucky".  But that's a different story.
