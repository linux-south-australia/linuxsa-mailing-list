Some people on the Suse list are experimenting with aptget. It can be 
downloaded as an rpm.

&gt; When they released the updated version of the printconf tools, they added
&gt; Omni to the dependencies of ghostview.  In their advisory
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-138.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-138.html</A>) it said to
&gt; download all the RPMs and run 'rpm -Fvh [filenames]'.  But if you don't
&gt; have Omni installed then it doesn't work as 'rpm -F' will only update
&gt; packages which are already installed.  The default 7.2 install didn't
&gt; install Omni so all of my work machines failed if I followed the advisory
&gt; instructions.  In this case it was simple to overcome by installing Omni
&gt; first, so why doesn't the advisory say this??
&gt;
&gt; This happened again when they released new RPM RPMs recently.
&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHEA-2002-024.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHEA-2002-024.html</A>
&gt; except this time the solution was far from clear.
&gt;
&gt; How are newbies suppose to do this when even the instructions from the
&gt; vendor are not clear?  Do they have to use Redhat's up2date and ignore the
&gt; advisories?
&gt;
&gt; It also seems to me that RPM needs another, option similar to freshen '-F',
&gt; which installs packages which aren't installed but are required to be
&gt; installed by packages which _are_ being upgraded. eg. Omni is not installed
&gt; but is required by the new version of ghostscript (which is install) so
&gt; install it anyway.  Does anything like this exist?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
