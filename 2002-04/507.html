Hmm,
Still no luck, anybody else got any ideas?  i can cat /var/log/messages and
see who has logged in and out in the past nicely, but w or who doesn't show
anything.  very sad....

i might mention that i'm using the mgetty that is on netcrafts site as the
latest rpm with redhat has a problem or two and netcraft so kindly pointed
me to their compiled one.

sounds like i might have to investigate portslave/radius setup, but it seems
a bit of an over kill for our 7 modems.

anyway, thanks all for replying before, gave me a lot to work with...
thanks
Matthew

Subject: RE: who is dialed up? pppd server


ah. i do recall something like that.  i followed the 'Pocket ISP' howto from
memory but i've played around with it a bit to get stuff going
my login.config reads:
--------line that counts-----
/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth +chap +pap login debug
------------------------------

-----------full file-----------
# login.config
#
# This is a sample "login dispatcher" configuration file for mgetty
#
# Format:
#       username userid utmp_entry login_program [arguments]
#
# Meaning:
#       for a "username" entered at mgettys login: prompt, call
#       "login_program" with [arguments], with the uid set to "userid",
#       and a USER_PROCESS utmp entry with ut_user = "utmp_entry"
#
# username may be prefixed / suffixed by "*" (wildcard)
#
# userid is a valid user name from /etc/passwd, or "-" to not set
#  a login user id and keep the uid/euid root (needed for /bin/login)
#
# utmp_entry is what will appear in the "who" listing. Use "-" to not
#  set an utmp entry (a must for /bin/login), use "@" to set it to the
#  username entered. Maximum length is 8 characters.
#
# login_program is the program that will be exec()ed, with the arguments
#  passed in [arguments]. A "@" in the arguments will be replaced with the
#  username entered. Warning: if no "@" is given, the login_program has
#  no way to know what user name the user entered.
#
#
# SAMPLES:
# Use this one with my Taylor-UUCP and Taylor-UUCP passwd files.
#  (Big advantage: tuucp can use the same passwd file for serial dial-in
#   and tcp dial-in [uucico running as in.uucpd]). Works from 1.05 up.
#
#U*     uucp    @       /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -l -u @

#
# Use this one for fido calls (login name /FIDO/ is handled specially)
#
# You need Eugene Crosser's "ifmail" package for this to work.
#  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DFIDO", otherwise a fido call won't
#  be detected.
#
#/FIDO/ uucp    fido    /usr/local/lib/fnet/ifcico @

#
# Automatic PPP startup on receipt of LCP configure request (AutoPPP).
#  mgetty has to be compiled with "-DAUTO_PPP" for this to work.
#  Warning: Case is significant, AUTOPPP or autoppp won't work!
#  Consult the "pppd" man page to find pppd options that work for you.
#
#  NOTE: for *some* users, the "-detach" option has been necessary, for
#        others, not at all. If your pppd doesn't die after hangup, try it.
#
#  NOTE2: "debug" creates lots of debugging info.  LOOK AT IT if things
#         do not work out of the box, most likely it's a ppp problem!
#
#  NOTE3: "man pppd" is your friend!
#
#  NOTE4: max. 9 arguments allowed.
#
/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth +chap +pap login debug

#
#
# An example where no login name in the argument list is desired:
#  automatically telnetting to machine "smarty" for a given login name
#
#telnet-smarty  gast    telnet  /usr/bin/telnet -8 smarty
#
# This is the "standard" behaviour - *dont* set a userid or utmp
#  entry here, otherwise /bin/login will fail!
#  This entry isn't really necessary: if it's missing, the built-in
#  default will do exactly this.
#
#*      -       -       /bin/login @
#/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd

There are configuration items specific to this in login.config (an mgetty
configuration file) - what does yours look like?
