To give you an example.. The DVD-ROM in my Toshiba is bust; replacement cost
was quoted at about $600+. Ouch. Brand names == high prices.

However, at least most people know how to work on toshiba's and can get the
parts. I've worked on a few different laptops though, and generally I've
found they haven't needed any amazingly specialist tools.. Of course you'll
need more than just your one-size-fits-all philips head, but you expected
that.

(Speaking of which.. can anyone give me a good price on a
non-genuine-toshiba part that'd be reasonably priced and still fit? Or even
a CDROM would be acceptable if cheap enuf..)

&gt; Make sure you can get them easily fixed in Adelaide and for a number of
&gt; years after you purchased it.
&gt;
&gt; Laptops tend to have lots of custom parts that can be hard and/or expensive
&gt; to get or even require specialist tools.
&gt;
&gt; If you buy a laptop it _IS_ worth getting a brand name (Compaq, Toshiba, HP,
&gt; IBM etc) as these can on the whole be easily fixed.
&gt;
&gt; I've had success with Compaq and appreciate that they have a repair store on
&gt; Frome St in the City.
&gt;
&gt; The Highlander laptops may indeed have an easy way of getting them fixed (I
&gt; have no experience with them) but it is something worth checking.
