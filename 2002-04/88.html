Excerpt from my dhcpd.conf file modified for your network. Should work apples.

ddns-update-style ad-hoc;
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	# default gateway
	option routers 10.0.0.1;
	option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
	option netbios-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
	option domain-name "internal.foo.com.au";
	option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
	option netbios-node-type 0x8;

	range dynamic-bootp 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.20;
	default-lease-time 14400;
	max-lease-time 14400;

	# Some computers require special addresses
	host mycomputer {
	hardware ethernet 00:0E:47:39:7A:F7;
	fixed-address 10.0.0.10;
	}

&gt; Can anyone shed light on the following problem
&gt; 
&gt; Setup is as follows
&gt; DHCP Server : Smoothwall ( Linux ) with scope 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.0.30
&gt; Client PC : Win2K
&gt; 
&gt; I've got Port forwarding set up on Smoothwall box to go to 10.0.0.10 which
&gt; is the address that the Win2K PC usually gets. Problem is I had my PC round
&gt; at a friends house on weekend. His DHCP server has range 10.0.0.20 -
&gt; 10.0.0.40 so my Win2K PC grabbed .20 and is now stuck with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now DHCP is supposed to give out the same address if it free but how do I
&gt; override it. Is it the Win2K box that is requesting the same address ( even
&gt; if it is released ) or is it the Linux Box giving that address because
&gt; that's what it had before.
&gt; 
&gt; My work around was to change my scope to 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.0.11 and then
&gt; release/renew my Win2K box but there must be a better way.
