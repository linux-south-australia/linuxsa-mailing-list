Good, but not excellent.

&gt; ease of use

Poor, especially when compared to the web-driven iPlanet LDAP server. This
really hurts when setting ACLs, and as a result most OpenLDAP servers I
have seen have access control issues.

The configuration file syntax is sane.

The schemas for version 2 uses the standard file syntax.  This makes
writing your own schema difficult, but allows sharing of schemas very
easily.

The directory is populated using standard LDIF files.  Nice if you want to
transfer data from another directory (direct export from an LDAP directory
or a simple Perl script to reformat the data otherwise), bad if you are
entering the data by hand.

I'd suggest using a LDAP GUI client or LDAP/web gateway if you load the
server by hand.  In the longer run you'll probbaly want to write some Perl
CGI to maintain the directory from the web.  This is surprising easy (as
all the hard issues like security and validation are taken care of by
LDAP, so the Perl simply needs to get data and issue multiple LDAP
transactions).

&gt; ease of administration

LDAP can significantly simplify system administration.  Linux and Solaris
will validate against LDAP.  Windows NT/XP can have it's GINA replaced by
an LDAP GINA, alllowing user authentication against LDAP.

The trickiest issue tends to be password changes, OpenLDAP handles this 
particularly well.

&gt; is it the best solution?

Depends on the size of the directory you intend to run.  OpenLDAP is good 
for small/medium deployments.

&gt; are there better {proprietary|open-source} solutions (that run on linux,
&gt; of course)?

The alternatives are iPlanet and Oracle.  The iPlanet stuff is nicest, but
they have withdrawn Linux support, supposedly temporarily.  Apparently the
version 5.0 server failed unit testing due to a threading bug in Red Hat
Linux 7.1.  This doesn't explain the absence of support for iDS 5.1 on RHL
7.2 (which has fixed the threading bug).

The Oracle LDAP server is included in the Oracle database, so if you have
paid for this for another purpose you might consider it.  The LDAP server
has slightly non-standard administration (won't import LDIF, etc) but is
felt to be the most grunty.
