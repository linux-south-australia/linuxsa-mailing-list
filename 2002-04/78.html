&gt; I am currently using Redhat 7.2 and KDE. I currently have two issues 
&gt; that need some resolution and would appreciate the list's input.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Mouse-fits
&gt; 
&gt; On an intermitent basis, and without a causal link (as far as I can 
&gt; ascertain), I lose control of the mouse, where simple movements are 
&gt; translated into many more movements and mouse button presses. 
&gt; Previously, I had thought this was related to the use of the console 
&gt; window, but last night it occured again using Star Office 5.2.
&gt; 
&gt; The result is that my docks and menus get randomly re-arranged, and I 
&gt; can't control any of the programs. I am using a Dexxa-optical mouse 
&gt; which is compatible with a Microsoft intelli-mouse. Does anyone have 
&gt; any ideas on this one?

One of these might help (don't do them all at the same time!):
1. Try changing your mouse's protocol between IMPS/2 and PS/2.
2. Make sure that console mouse support (gpm) is disabled.
3. Enable only gpm, then get X to use the gpmdata/MouseSystems protocol.

&gt; 2) Lost in time
&gt; 
&gt; The clock on the KDE dock has been changing its own time, it seems to 
&gt; relate to a change in the timezone from CST to DAVT or DAYT (I don't 
&gt; remember which).  When you try to change the time or the timezone 
&gt; through the KDE Clock, it tends to be ignored.  Changing the settings 
&gt; only to have them ignored by KDE seems to be a familiar, I have had a 
&gt; similar problem with getting the fixed font setting to work (and still 
&gt; haven't resolved it).

Is it only KDE that has this problem, or is it the entire system?
What does running "date" give?

What timezone is "DAVT"?

Have you tried setting the time in other ways (such as using "date"
or Red Hat's "setup" program?).

Is your BIOS ("hardware") clock set to UTC or localtime?
