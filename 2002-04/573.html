Hi Toby and all,

I'm desperate for older hard drives and 3 G would be like manna for our 
community computer project. Likewise for Romana and the good people 
over at Computerbank SA.

Please don't dice any older hard drives. Good respectable homes can be 
found for all of them. Even non working may be just the thing to help 
us provide an old computer to somebody who can't afford one.

And they don't have to be ex-PCs, we have 10 Macs we are trying to 
refurbish and release back into the commmunity.

While the Macs are old enough that they won't take kindly to Linux 
being dropped into them most of our PCs will happily take some flavour 
of Linux so it is now our policy that no PC computer will leave us 
without it being a Linux OS running OpenOffice.

Cheers,  Ian

PS: Anybody in the Northern area want to help a group of people with an 
Aquired Brain Injury get to grips with their Linux (RH 7.1) machine we 
have just provided for them? They are based on DSTO land so are easy to 
get to by car.
Email me off list if you can help.

&gt; I didn't know you could even buy 3 or 4 Gb IDE drives these days?
