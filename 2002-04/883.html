Hi list users,
i'm after some advice on stopping a package from upgrading while using 
APT4RPM.
Yesterday i did a fresh install of SuSE 7.3, then installed APT4RPM, being 
able to use apt on y SuSE system is close to heaven except for one glitch.
I can seem to stop the package k_deflt from upgrading, for those who don't 
know, this is the default SuSE kernel and using RPM to upgrade kernels 
doesn't seem to be advisable  :)
Anyway after RTFM a couple of times and looking through the FAQ's and 
following the directions, apt still wants to upgrade this package.
The FAQ's suggests this;

"Use the configuration option "HoldPkgs" in /etc/apt/apt.conf. E.g. as 
follows:

RPM
{
   HoldPkgs {
       k_deflt;
       inews;
   };
}
         

Check the current settings with "apt-config dump"."

I've done this and when I use "apt-get -su upgrade" I see that k_deflt is 
still in the upgrade list.
Then I went to  the debian apt 'how-to' and RTFM it seems to use a file 
called /etc/apt/preferences to detail the packages to hold back, so just on 
the off chance that it may work i created said file using advice from TFM and 
guess what, bugger me but it didn't work.
About now the levels of frustration of reaching terminal levels, which is 
probably working against my making progress on this problem. 
Am I making some basic syntax error in a file?
Does it work at all?
Is my machine just secretly laughing at me?

Please, some one, just thump me a few times on the back of the head with a 
large and knobbly clue stick, spin me around a few times, point me in the 
right direction and shove.

I've included relevant files, hope they help someone more than they've helped 
me (grumble grumble)

System Info;
Athlon 1400
SuSE 7.3

TIA
