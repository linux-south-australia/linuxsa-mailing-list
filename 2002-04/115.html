&lt;Raises Hand&gt;  Done that too...

I once did a similar thing on a client's NT Primary Domain Controller...  I
had a backup "script" (just a batch file really), which used the following
to erase the Jaz disk before backing up to it... DELTREE /Y %BACKDRV%*.*
(basically the NT equivalent to rm -rf)...  What I didn't notice was that if
there was no Jaz disk in the drive the script didn't set %BACKDRV% properly,
and instead of erasing the (non-existant) Jaz disk, it would delete the
current directory instead, of course the current directory was C:\.  Our
client ran the script every day for 3 months without problems, until one day
most of the windows directory went missing and the server died.  Ooops!

Jim.

Well we all so stupid things...

I remember a year back I had just started a new job and I noticed that
the previous joker they had for a sys admin wasn't doing backups, so I
wrote a tempory backup script, everything was to be backed up to a
directory before transfered to tape. Anyhow the script was in perl and
instead of using unlink to remove the old backup files I used 'system
"/bin/rm -f $BACKUPDIR/*"', But my bigest mistake was a typo when
defining the $BACKUPDIR at the top of the script and the $BACKUPDIR
variable was left empty.

Did I test this first? NO
Did I run this on a production machine without testing? YES

I'm just glad I used "rm -f" as I was going to use "rm -rf".  Would of
made my first week at work interesting if I did...

&gt; I'd just like to let you all know that I'm stupid.
