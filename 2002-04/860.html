Hi team...  I'm quietly hoping that someone will have the time, inclination,
and expertise to help me out with this.

I recently acquired an old Compaq Armada notebook (Pentium 100), and I
figured the most useful thing I could do with it is to use it as a little
Postgres server.  I've got FreeBSD 4.5, so I thought what I'd do was install
that on it, with only the Postgres packages (i.e. don't need X or anything
on it), and that would be roughly feasible (providing I don't make any of my
databases too big, cos after all it's only got an 800m HDD...!)

The bit I'm not sure about is this - from what I can gather, I need to do an
installation from my FTP server, because this notebook has no CD Rom.
However I can't find any literature that suggests whether or not the BSD
Installation Boot Disk(s) will support my Accton PCMCIA card (because that's
the only means of connectivity I've got...!).

The BSD documentation suggests that the card is supported, but I don't
particularly know enough about tooling around with this stuff to figure out
how to get it to talk...  I guess I'd have to modify some sort of .conf file
on the boot floppy, and copy a driver across or something ?

Has anyone out there got any experience in doing an installation in this
manner, or confirm that it's a WOFTAM ?

The reason I ask is that I didn't get any disks or anything with it, and
whilst I'd go for the trial-and-error approach, I fear that if I screw this
BSD install up then I may not be able to get Windoze back on it either (for
similar reasons as above).

Helpful responses gladly accepted, on or off list !

Jason =)
