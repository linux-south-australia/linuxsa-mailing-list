On Friday night I was just about to go home when I noticed that the
gateway server for our organisation went down. It took me two hours of
swapping network cards and playing with irq's and modprobe before it
occurred to me that my offsider accidentally disconnected the wrong
cable from the switch...

I hate it when you speak to some tech support weenie on the phone and
even though you've told him that you are in the same industry the first
question they asked is "Have you plugged it in sir?" I must remeber to
grin and bear it next time that happens as the advice is sometimes
useful. ;)

&gt; &gt; Hi all
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was trying to get my sound card working without the speakers plugged
&gt; &gt; in, it took me a while to realise this. It wasn't 'til I saw the plug
&gt; &gt; poking out from under a piece of paper on my desk that I realised.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi LinuxSA,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I'd just like to let you all know that I'm stupid.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; And that by telling you all is penance.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well we all so stupid things...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I remember a year back I had just started a new job and I noticed that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the previous joker they had for a sys admin wasn't doing backups, so I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote a tempory backup script, everything was to be backed up to a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directory before transfered to tape. Anyhow the script was in perl and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of using unlink to remove the old backup files I used 'system
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "/bin/rm -f $BACKUPDIR/*"', But my bigest mistake was a typo when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; defining the $BACKUPDIR at the top of the script and the $BACKUPDIR
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variable was left empty.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did I test this first? NO
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Did I run this on a production machine without testing? YES
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm just glad I used "rm -f" as I was going to use "rm -rf".  Would of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; made my first week at work interesting if I did...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Decades ago I was working on a Tandem machine with a rather primitive
&gt; &gt; &gt; shell.  When it encountered an error, it would just come out with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; number, so you needed to learn that ENOENT was "FILE SYSTEM ERROR
&gt; &gt; &gt; 011".  People didn't like that, so I hacked the shell binary to call a
&gt; &gt; &gt; function which loaded an error message text from a file and printed
&gt; &gt; &gt; that instead.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; That meant, of course, that I needed a utility to update the file,
&gt; &gt; &gt; because plain text files hadn't been invented yet.  So I tested this
&gt; &gt; &gt; program, and for error 11 I wrote "File not found".  Then to test it I
&gt; &gt; &gt; changed the text, to (translated into UNIX) "Please enter 'rm -rf *'".
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I giggled about that for a while, and was just about ready to change
&gt; &gt; &gt; it back again, when our project manager came to me and said
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Mr. Lehey, I think I've done something stupid".
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately, it was early in the morning, and we did religious backups
&gt; &gt; &gt; every evening, so he really didn't lose very much.
