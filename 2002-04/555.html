&gt; &gt; &gt; Who knows of any software for linux that'll burn dvds and supports
&gt; &gt; &gt; writing on the fly? I cant spare 4.9gb when I allready have 4.9gb of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; data sitting there, and this funky writer writes too fast to do it over
&gt; &gt; &gt; the network :( FWIW cdbakeoven looks like it supports dvds, but there is
&gt; &gt; &gt; no way to select &gt; 100min cd in the cd creation section.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Doesn't cdrecord do it natively? I have no idea about writing DVD's, but
&gt; &gt; wouldn't it be more a problem for mkisofs than for cdrecord anyway?
&gt;
&gt; Ive got it sussed now. You need to use cdrecord-prodvd, and tell mkisofs
&gt; to split the files or else it core dumps at 2gb.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; You could just pipe the output from mkisofs to cdrecord, as long as you
&gt; &gt; had some buffer underrun mojo...
&gt;
&gt; I couldnt find a way to get mkisofs to dump to stdout, it only seems to
&gt; support files. I guess you could use a fifo, but thats a bit messy.
&gt;
&gt; On a slightly different subject, Im wondering about the licencing of
&gt; cdrecord-prodvd [1]
&gt;
&gt; I was under the understanding that cdrecord was under the GNU licence.
&gt; cdrecord-prodvd identifies itself as:
&gt;
&gt; Cdrecord-ProDVD-Clone 1.11b19 (i586-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C)
&gt; 1995-2002 J&ouml;rg Schilling
&gt;
&gt; Which has "gnu" in it. Yet there is no source, and it has a licenceing
&gt; scheme (comes with a free for non-commercial/educational type key
&gt; though).
&gt;
&gt; J&ouml;rg Schilling wrote both, but if cdrecord-prodvd is a derivative work
&gt; of cdrecord which is GNU, despite the fact that he is the author, can he
&gt; not release the source? And if there is no source, shouldnt he take GNU
&gt; out the version information?
