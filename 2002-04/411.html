Hi all,

Time for the LinuxSA April 2002 Meeting...

Here are the usual details:

  When:   7:00pm (doors open 6:45pm) on
          Tuesday, 16th April, 2002
  Where:  2nd Floor
          Compaq Computer
          139 Frome Street
          Adelaide SA
  Cost:   FREE
  Who:    Anyone and everyone.
          No pre-registration necessary.

Presentation:

   Simon Hackett from Internode/Agile will be giving a talk on:
   'Mac OS-X: Linux for the rest of us?'

   With the release of OS-X, Apple have become the first 'traditional'
   personal computer vendor to move to a Unix based operating system
   as its default operating environment. Apple has bet its business on
   what turns out to be a brilliant integration of a Mach kernel,
   FreeBSD, all the Open Source tools you're used to, and Mac-OS.

   Its a bet that might just pay off.

   Simon will talk about what makes OS-X tick; About Darwin, Aqua,
   Carbon, Cocoa, and the other bits and pieces that collectively
   constitute OS-X. About the difference between OS-X and X-Windows.
   And about how to survive a one button mouse.

   He will demonstrate the outcome of Microsoft porting 'Office' to
   Unix; How OS-X runs old Mac software; How it runs new Mac software;
   How it runs all the cool Open Source development tools you'll ever
   want, and how it does it all at once.

   OS-X is one answer to the perennial challenge for Linux - the
   question of its approachability as a mainstream desktop operating
   environment for non-technical people. He'll try to show you why for
   him, at least, OS-X is the most nearly perfect operating system
   that he's ever used, how Linux fans really should take a look at
   it, and how Linux and OS-X will make each other stronger.

Extras:

  As per usual, if you are having a problem with your Linux
  installation, feel free to bring your machine, but please warn
