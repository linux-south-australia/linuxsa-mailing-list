Jayson:

&gt; Sorry this is so stupid, but I just cant figure out how to declare
&gt; variables in c properly.

Declaring variables in C when not having experience in C a declarative 
language can be non-intuitive. I wouldn't label your question as 
"stupid" just as "newbie-like".

&gt; If anyone can suggest a good book or website about C that would be invaluable.

Well, if you goto:

* <A HREF="http://lists.linux.org.au/listinfo/linuxcprogramming">http://lists.linux.org.au/listinfo/linuxcprogramming</A>

...the members of that list tend to be very tolerant of "newbie" 
questions (although I would suggest you ask something more like "how do 
I declare a string in C or integer in C"). Furthermore, you have the 
added benefit that I happen to be that list's administrator and the 
members of the list know better than to bash newbies because they asked 
newbie questions.

But seriously, as a start point:

int c;

...makes an integer called "c".

char c;

...make a character called "c".

float c;

...makes a floating point number called c.

char *c;

...makes a pointer called c. It's like a perl reference but way more 
dangerous to use.

A string is just a null terminated array of pointers:

char c[127];

...that is to say an array of charcters with 128 spaces (C starts 
counting from 0).
