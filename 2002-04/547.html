&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Dia doesn't use Gnome if I recall. It is a Gtk+ program. Regardless of 
&gt;&gt;which, I have the latest development version running nicely on a RedHat 
&gt;&gt;7.1 box.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; GNOME is a desktop, and is also set of libraries.  gtk+, gdk, bonobo, eel, 
&gt; libgnome  etc are some of the GNOME libraries.  Sure, you can use some of these 
&gt; libraries without the others, but it's worth considering that gtk+ is basically 
&gt; developed by the GNOME people.  i.e. it's not worth drawing a distinction 
&gt; between them.

I don't fully agree.  There is commonality between them, however stating 
that Dia needs GTK+, and not the entire set of GNOME libraries (which is 
quite substantial), is quite useful to know, as it implies I don't need 
GConf, OAF, gtkhtml, and many of the other usual requirements for a 
GNOME application.

&gt; Likewise KDE has a set of libraries.  Some KDE programs use only some of the 
&gt; libraries.  No difference.

It would be similar to the difference between a program that needed 
(only) Qt and a program that needed the entire set of KDE libraries.

The reason I raised this issue is I recently wanted to install Ximian 
Evolution on a Red Hat 7.2 system, and I either had to upgrade several 
GNOME libraries to the latest Ximian GNOME libraries, or build and 
install all the libraries elsewhere.  This was too much hassle for me to 
do on a production machine (I figured I might as well wait until Red Hat 
7.3).
