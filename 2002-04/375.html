Hello to all,

I have two problems:

First Part:  It is about Compaq Presario 4712.  Recently, I got this old
machine without a harddrive. I had one spare harddrive of 8GB, which I have
used for this machine now.  Every time, I start the machine, I get
"disk-1790 error 0"  message, and I have to press F1 to continue.  When I
checked the website of compaq, it is due to the incompatibility of
harddrive, and they also offer a software utility, but only for Window
platform (Iam using RH7.1). According to the information provided, it is due
to the size of the harddrive too large for the machine.  Has any one in the
group encoutered this? and any solution, particularly for Linux?

Second Part:  My second part is about the problem of telnetting, sshd -ing,
even web browsing from the internal network to Linux RH7.1 server (one
described above).  The server has two network interfaces, one connected to
the Internet with ADSL modem, and the other to the internal network.Only
thing I can do from the internal network clients to the server is ping, but
I can not telenet or sshd to the server. Telneting is working, when I try
from the Internet.  So, it seems services offered by the server is
available, and is working, but somehow these services may have been denied
to the internal network.

I would appreciate, should any one in the group can point me to the right
direction, please.

By the way, there is no entry in /etc/host.allow and /etc/host.deny .

Thanks

Damar
