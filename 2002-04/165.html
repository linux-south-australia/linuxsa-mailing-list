&gt; When say, Mandrake goes from 4.2 to 4.4, will the package manager do
&gt; that upgrade? Or do you need a new CD set.. What I am asking is whether
&gt; the package manager updates just the packages or the whole distribution
&gt; (if there even is a difference..)

Yep, it gives options for upgrade system, or upgrade packages only. In
system upgrade it uninstalles packages marked as obsolete, and installs
the replacements. Packages only, is exactly that. It seems quite robust.
My laptop has just started doing something wierd with the battery, where
it looks like its working but it isnt. I moved the laptop and unplugged
the power when it wanted cd 3 doing an upgrade and it just died straight
away. When I booted it up the system still ran, and when I tryed the
install again, the installer realised that it didnt need to do the
upgrades from cd 1 and 2 and went straight for cd 3. I thought that was
pretty good. Then I thought I fixed my battery and pulled the power on
it again when it was doing the postinstall scripts, and its stuffed up
the gnome menus, so it isnt quite invincible.
