In every group of people, let's for discussion call them a "body" there
are many parts that contribute to the life and health of the whole.

We have those that think and provide guidance and wisdom, the heart the
lungs and limbs all contribute to further the growth of the whole.

then we have the fundamental orifice ... lets call our "THEDSL".

Ours appears to need surgical help, it is either blocked or very badly
swollen either from its own perceived importance or just a lack of
understanding where it belongs in the scheme of things.

"THEDSL" seems incapable of reasoned responses. Possibly this is due to
its design, a cavity with no means or desire to listen and a limited
response mechanism that sends forth offence.

When "THEDSL" malfunctions it can cause all manner of disease to spread
from its festering existence. This pollution ultimately will cause
member of the body to wither and die or worse fail to experience the
harmony a functioning body can offer.

 "THEDSL" appears to have a degree of intelligence but, due to its
demonstrated inability to respond above the level of a petulant child it
is rapidly becoming redundant to the main body. "THEDSL", when it is
diseased needs to be bypassed because it will and does inflict damage on
the body.

When "THEDSL" sees itself as "THEHEAD" we are all in the ****.
