Hi,
    Can anyone help , tell me how, or suggest a firm in adelaide that 
can retrieve data from a HDD.

The basic Story.

Basically the system was running windows me
The computer was left on for several days and went into sleep mode from 
which it did not recover
It was turned off
On reboot it initially booted into safe mode and named several files it 
required to continue, including I believe several .vxd files from the 
windows folder.
On later attempts it return io error and would not reboot

The problem, you guessed it all their info for their home business is on 
this disc,  backed up onto the second partition of the same disc. As far 
as I know there were only two partitions on a 2 Gb maxtor HDD c: & d: 

My progress,

1. Removed from system and used another HDD. System now boots with no 
problem
2. Put into original system as second HDD recognised by bios but not 
accessable
3. Put it into my system (Mandrake) using HDD conf tools HDD is 
recognised but shows no partition
        info indicates freespace.
4. Tried Mandrakes partition recovery tool returns failure
5. Tried internet for hints, mostly found expensive recovery tools
6. Tried Win-98 boot disk with additional tools recognises HDD but 
prompts for partitioning and formatting.
7. Tried older dos tools
8. Tried older redhat tools - lots of reading 'cos i've never used these 
before
9. Tried a friends winXP inbuilt disc management  

Basically all the above return similar results, ie No partitions found 
and prompt for new partitions naturally I'm reluctant to do this as I 
dont want to ruin any data that might be retrievable. So far I've only 
used tools that attempt to read existing data and not allowed anything 
to write to the disk.

Naturally if I was able to use a linux tool to safely retrieve their 
data, I'd be ecstatic not to mention them.
However, I really don't care what the means are, so any suggestions are 
welcome.
    note, I did suggest a round of torture for the person that used this 
method of backup, to continue until they remembered every keystroke of 
the info backed up. (They politely refused the offer)
Failing that, as I said at the beginning if there is a reputable firm 
that doesn't cost the earth or someone has the tools to do it 
themselves. Make me an offer, and I'll talk to them on your behalf.

David Delyn.
ps They're just getting the business of the ground so money is still 
pretty tight.
Especially when some their billing data is unavailable.
