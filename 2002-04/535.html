&gt; Strike me dead...
&gt; That's all we need. Better fonts and nicer icons.

actually, for people who are visually impaired, yes we do. same to encourage 
business use.

&gt; If you want better fonts and nicer icons, use Mac OS X or even Windows.

ENCOURAGING windows use? losing all the benefits of linux because you have a 
down on fonts and icons? 

david, have we woken up on the insane side of the bed this morning?

&gt; &gt; I'm new to Linux and I'm really enjoying easing into a new computing
&gt; &gt; experience.
&gt; Well, here me now. I'm not about to lose server stability because crappy
&gt; users want crappy fonts and crappy icons. I want a stable operating
&gt; system and if that means delaying "user friendliness" too bloody bad.

well, all stop the world for david! lets all ignore our own personal 
wishlists so that david's may be fulfilled. what fools we were trying to meet 
other peoples needs, to develop a system that meets the greater number of 
needs and wishes, when we could have focused solely on david's wants.

after all, all the developers MUST be working solely on fonts and stuff, 
noone is working on stability at all.

help, this man talks about stability, then suggests windows to a user?????

and btw david, its 'hear', not 'here'. i wouldnt normally correct you, being 
noted as a crappy (read lazy) typist, but you have done so often to innocents 
on this list.....

&gt; *go to hell*

david, this sort of posting is wildly inappropriate, and totally uncalled 
for. not to mention pathetic, petulant and childish. i thought better of you 
than that.

&gt; Become me for a day.

actually, from your recent postings, i would rather take poison.

now, you have a nice day, ok?:)
