&gt; Thanks Michael,
&gt; Yes, your information does help :)
&gt; 
&gt; "Windows Printer and File Sharing"
&gt; You mean share a SMB print queue, remember I know OS/2 not Windoze :)

Yes.  The printer queue is still an lpr queue (or whatever type you want 
it to be) on your Unix box, however Samba can let Windows clients talk 
to it using the native Windows protocol.

I'm not sure of the exact name of the service, but it's a standard 
Windows service you can install in the networking control panel, and 
it's available on the Windows installation media.  It's what is 
(usually) already installed when you want to share files between Windows 
hosts.

&gt; I've found lpr printing to be much more robust than SMB printing as you
&gt; don't have to be logged-on to print 

The server will still use lpr, but the Windows workstations/desktops can 
use their own native printing mechanism.  I presume your concern 
regarding being logged in is only relevant (if at all) to when the print 
*server* is a Windows server, but I could be wrong.

If you understand my point, and are still concerned by the robustness of 
SMB printing, you should certainly try your lpr on Windows printing. 
Have you tried this before?  Is the lpr client good?

A tool that you might like to look at is SWAT.  It allows configuration 
of Samba via a web interface, and it *might* even allow basic 
administration of the print queue, but then there's probably options 
like this (perhaps Webmin) for managing lpr queues in a web interface. 
(Just a thought.)

The other issue you may wish to investigate is:
provided you're using Windows 98, Windows 2000, and higher, you may 
prefer (or you may need) to enable SMB password encryption so your 
passwords are not stored and/or sent in plaintext.  I'll let you read 
about this one.
