&gt; Why go out and buy bread when you can grow some Wheat, Crush it and make
&gt; your own

Because the bread you get will be organic and taste nicer.

&gt; Products like Smoothwall are very easy to set up and it spreads knowledge of
&gt; Linux.

Yes, I know.

&gt; Surely this is a good thing.

It will lead to more demands of "make linux easier" and we'll end up 
having more bloatware like Open Office. Sometimes "easier" is not 
necessarily the most appropriate solution for the problem at hand.

&gt; I've got 3 friends with Telstra Cable
&gt; who would NEVER EVER have had anything to do with Linux if it wasn't for
&gt; Smoothwall.

I hope they don't contact Smoothwall's creator -- I've been told he's 
worse than I am when I'm drunk ;-P

&gt; My own Smoothwall box has worked flawlessly for 12 months on Telstra ADSL
&gt; and the problem I'm having now that I've gone to Internode is annoying but
&gt; minor. The "Problem" has to be something that has occurred as a result of
&gt; going to Internode and I'd like to think that a solution can be found rather
&gt; than saying " Don't use Smoothwall "

I didn't say "don't use Smoothwall".

&gt; and Yes..I have contacted both Simon, Internode Helpdesk and Smoothwall IRC
&gt; support and thus far no-one has any answers. I was hoping that one of the
&gt; "so called gurus" that frequent this mailing list might have some
&gt; constructive suggestions on finding what the problem is.

Well, if you provide the beer I'm quite happy to check your setup out 
for you and in the meantime transfer some knowledge...

*don't say I didn't offer*
