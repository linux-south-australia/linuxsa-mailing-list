Yeah, Ive seen boards with "splash screens" that dont go away till you
hit the right combination (which in this case was F3, I think it was an
early intel board), and Ive seen a HP server, that had a card in it
which over wrote the bottom line of the display which was where it was
meant to say how to get in, and also if it had registered your keypress
and was going to enter after POST. This one was F2. Plus, I think it was
older compaqs used to say compaq, and you had to hit insert at the right
moment, and an underscore appeared in the corner, which meant it was
going to enter the bios! How are you meant to know that!

&gt; &gt; Some laptops are insert. I usualy hit esc + f1 + f2 + f3 + f11 +f12 +
&gt; &gt; ins + del and tend to get a bios :)
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone come across a BIOS which didn't tell you how to get into it?
&gt; 
&gt; *NOTE* This is different to "it went too fast and I couldn't read what 
&gt; it said" --&gt; I've seen a modern Athlon 1700+ System which flashes past 
&gt; so fast it's difficult to tell how to do it.
