In the immortal words of Toby Corkindale &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tjcorkin@sa.pracom.com.au">tjcorkin@sa.pracom.com.au</A>&gt;...
&gt; Bartender! I'll have one of whatever the gentleman who thinks he's

Excerpt from 'Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy'
--------------------
 One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of
accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem
involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and
well- adjusted family can't cope with. There is no problem about
changing the course of history-the course of history does not change
because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes
have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all
sorts itself out in the end.

The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to
consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's "Time Traveler's
Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations". It will tell you, for instance, how
to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before
you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it.
The event will be described differently according to whether you are
talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a
time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is further
complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are
actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of
becoming your own mother or father.

Most readers get as far as the Future Semiconditionally Modified
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up; and in
fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have
been left blank to save on printing costs.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of
academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future
Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. 
-----------------------------------

Incidentally, for those interested, international Towel Day will be
observed on Saturday May 25th in memory of Douglas Adams.
