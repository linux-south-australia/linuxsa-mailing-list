&gt; Second Part:  My second part is about the problem of telnetting, sshd -ing,
&gt; even web browsing from the internal network to Linux RH7.1 server (one
&gt; described above).  The server has two network interfaces, one connected to
&gt; the Internet with ADSL modem, and the other to the internal network.Only
&gt; thing I can do from the internal network clients to the server is ping, but
&gt; I can not telenet or sshd to the server. Telneting is working, when I try
&gt; from the Internet.  So, it seems services offered by the server is
&gt; available, and is working, but somehow these services may have been denied
&gt; to the internal network.

If it's connected to the Internet, you may have installed (perhaps
unknowingly) some packet filtering software such as IPChains or 
IPTables.

I'd suggest that you have a look at your IPChains or IPTables rules.
From the command prompt, enter the following command, depending on
whether or not you are using IPChains or IPTables. If you're not
sure, try both and see how it goes.

# ipchains -L -n -v
# iptables -L -n -v

That'll give you an idea of what is going on as far as firewalling
is concerned. in.telnetd and sshd (generally) listen on ports 23
and 22 respectively. Have a look at the output of one of the two
aforementioned commands and see if you can determine whether or
not the SSH/telnet ports are being filtered.

If you get stuck, or have trouble reading the IPChains/IPTables
output, send a copy to the list and we'll have a look for you.
