Hi,

I am currently using Redhat 7.2 and KDE. I currently have two issues 
that need some resolution and would appreciate the list's input.

1) Mouse-fits

On an intermitent basis, and without a causal link (as far as I can 
ascertain), I lose control of the mouse, where simple movements are 
translated into many more movements and mouse button presses. 
Previously, I had thought this was related to the use of the console 
window, but last night it occured again using Star Office 5.2.

The result is that my docks and menus get randomly re-arranged, and I 
can't control any of the programs. I am using a Dexxa-optical mouse 
which is compatible with a Microsoft intelli-mouse. Does anyone have 
any ideas on this one?

2) Lost in time

The clock on the KDE dock has been changing its own time, it seems to 
relate to a change in the timezone from CST to DAVT or DAYT (I don't 
remember which).  When you try to change the time or the timezone 
through the KDE Clock, it tends to be ignored.  Changing the settings 
only to have them ignored by KDE seems to be a familiar, I have had a 
similar problem with getting the fixed font setting to work (and still 
haven't resolved it).

I would appreciate any clues to make my life more sane when using KDE 
and Redhat 7.2.
