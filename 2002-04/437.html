Oh gawd...

&lt;snip&gt;
(4) Because you obviously don't speak English, I'm inclined to believe
that saying "you're a total f***kw*t" won't be understood.
&lt;/snip&gt;

Is it too much to ask for you to have some courtesy? It's great that you
helped this person. Why not try manners as well?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's a lot harsh. David, you should see this list as much for HELPING
&gt; &gt; people as it is for inflating your ego. Try to keep them in balance.
&gt; 
&gt; Let us not get into the "whether David helps people or not" flame war. 
&gt; My reasons are:
&gt; 
&gt; * you have absolutely no proof
&gt; * if you traul the mailing list archives, you will be disproved
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from this little piece of truth. You have CONVENIENTLY not said I 
&gt; actually did inform the person "manoj" how to unsubscribe from the list 
&gt; and also offered to tell him in a form he understood.
&gt; 
&gt; And just what have you or Craig done to help him?
&gt; 
&gt; NOTHING
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly how can you possibly say that flaming me helps him unsubscribe 
&gt; -- obviously he's missed automatigically appended message and you 
&gt; haven't pointed him to it.
&gt; 
&gt; No help at all.
&gt; 
&gt; So now you boast your ego by attempting to put me in place but you 
&gt; haven't helped this poor little person one bit. Not one bit.
&gt; 
&gt; And you accuse me of being UNBALANCED?
&gt; 
&gt; My null hypothesis is that I don't understand logic.
&gt; 
&gt; *thinks....thinks*
&gt; 
&gt; No that's illogical. I understand that "If Ian writes a message that 
&gt; flames David and has nothing at all to do with the subject (apart from 
&gt; automatically appended messages which clearly have not been seen or 
&gt; understood) then under Ian's definition of unbalanced, David's original 
&gt; message is obviously blanced because David's original message pertained 
&gt; to the subject, provided assistance by pointing the original poster to 
&gt; the automatically appended help and ALSO offered to translate that 
&gt; original message in a variety of forms".
&gt; 
&gt; *bugger*
&gt; 
&gt; My null hypothesis is incorrect therefore provided I haven't made one of 
&gt; the two possible errors (Brian Astil can explain them) then my null 
&gt; hypothesis is incorrect and I must be able to understand logic.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; manoj: It's probably people like this that make you want to
&gt; &gt; unsubscribe... I know what you mean.
&gt; 
&gt; Give manoj some credit. Unlike YOU, he can probably see the tongue in 
&gt; cheek ;-P
&gt; 
&gt; LMFAO
