Yes, yes, this is a top-quote.  I'm using *gasp* I won't even say it,
look for yourselves.  And it hates HTML-&gt;Text conversion.  Anyway.


I am using a program called NTOP (<A HREF="http://www.ntop.org">http://www.ntop.org</A>) to monitor our
Internet usage on a per-IP basis.

It's pretty good, does graphing and is very thorough, although I'm not
completely satisfied with it yet, because there are a few bugs and
sometimes I'm not confident the information I'm being shown is actually
correct.  BUT that could be because I'm still playing with it and I just
have to play some more.  But it might be worth investigating.

It also has a web front end, so you can use any Browser in conjunction
with it.  It also uses DNS to display hosts by hostname.

Subject: Good Bandwidth/Network Monitor


Hi People,
I've just been searching for the past hour or two on freshmeat and
sourceforge and come up with nothing very useful.  I"m after a network
bandwidth monitor for our gateway so i can watch in realtime all the
traffic from IP:port to IP:port (maybe with DNS lookup, but not really
necessary).  

i've tried ethreal and this is ok, but doesn't really present the
current traffic in a nice way with graphs etc on one screen to watch.
i've also tried argus and this seems to be able to do good stuff.  it's
server based and can send stuff to an open port, but when i connect to
this port with a web browser, it just sends me unreadable junk and i
can't seem to find either a linux or windows client for this server.

any other programs that people really like?  hopefully either graphical
or sending output to a web browers in real time....  

thanks and regards
Matthew
