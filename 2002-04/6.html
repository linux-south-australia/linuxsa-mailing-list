&gt;Can you please fix your local system clocks? They're both set way
&gt;into the future.

Oops, is that better?

I share my home PC with an 18-month-old human who shows exceptional
understanding of the point-and-click mechanism even if he doesn't know what
he's doing when he clicks stuff. Every Windows PC in the house always has an
incorrect date, not just the one with my list MUA on it :).

How does an toddler even reach the controls you ask? This one waits until
no-one is looking, pushes a wheelie-chair up to the desk and climbs up to
sit on the mouse pad.. try telling him that lack of english language (well,
any language unless gibberish counts) skills is an impediment to using a
computer, I only hope they don't try and push an MCSE course on him in
kindergarten..

Why not get a mail client that sorts by claimed received date? I find it's a
much more useful sort order when dealing with mailing lists, especially ones
with international users and the odd mail client that doesn't set the
timezone in the date field. It also stops you from missing mail when someone
on a slow mail network (invariably exchange or lotus notes..) somewhere
sends an email that appears hidden 'above' what you've already read.

Oh, and it fixes the problem of idiots having their local date set in the
future ;)
