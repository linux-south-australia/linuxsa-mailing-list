Kirsty:

&gt; I have a weird problem with KMail and POP.  The weird part is that I'm
&gt; using it successfully and another user on my workstation isn't.  

It might just be you're better looking ;-P

&gt; This
&gt; would tend to suggest to me that there is something not right in the kde
&gt; configuration somewhere.  However, after having a look at the
&gt; ~/.kde/share/config/kmailrc file, I can't work out what's actually
&gt; causing KMail to not even get to the point of checking the pop server.

I dislike kMail as much as it dislikes me, however it's highly 
configurable via the GUI interface last time I looked.

How do you have this setup?

Does the user:

* have a user account on your system
  - in which case also look at ~username/.kmailrc

* use your login account
  - in which case I'd actually use the GUI to see what's wrong there

&gt; Does anyone know where there is a more helpful file to look at or am I
&gt; missing something blatantly obvious.

Oh, you're obviously getting no errors at all ;-)

You could try doing something like this:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@kirsty">root@kirsty</A>]# tcpdump proto tcp and port pop3
...
(then start kmail as the user and try checking mail)

The tcpdump will at least indicate if anything is going over pop3. If 
you happen to have ethereal, use that because it's more user friendly...

&gt; Mail to check his mail in the meantime, but KMail is a lot cooler.  I
&gt; also don't normally use KMail so any tips and hints would be much
&gt; appreciated....

Netscape, for all its awful traits, is a better mail client...but that's 
just my opinion.
