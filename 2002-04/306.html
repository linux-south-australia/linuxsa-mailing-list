[Thank you to Andrew Rutherford for letting me forward this e-mail to 
you all -- DSL]

***
As part of the network security talk this evening, there will be a
PGP key exchange.

The procedure is normally as follows:

- If you don't have a key, generate one.
- If your key has not been uploaded to a server, please do so.
- Email me your fingerprint before 5pm.

I will bring along a number of printouts of all the fingerprints made
available to me at 5pm.

- Everyone interested gets a copy of the fingerprints.
- Each person on the list stands up and reads out their fingerprint,
     verifying it as their true fingerprint.
- Those listening mark of as correct fingerprints for those people
     they know personally.

Later, you do the following for each of the people you personally know:

- Download the person's full public key.
- Verify the fingerprint as correct.
- Sign their key with your key and re-upload it to one of the key servers.

Part of the talk will be about the logic behind this methodology -
and the general problem of knowing the trustworthiness of distributed
public keys.

(this will occur during the AUUG meeting, 7 PM tonight at 180 Greenhill 
Rd [IBM's Headquarters in Adelaide])
