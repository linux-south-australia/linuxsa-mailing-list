Why dont u just use webin?

You can customize webmin for a new user specifiying just what processes they can
actually do.  Literally you can allow them to control one process or all of
them.  You just allow access to relevant processes and grant more as they become
familiar with the program.

Why would you let someone who  is so "nervous" about commands in linx GUI even
have access to the system?
Murphy's law indicates you will be "granted the wonderfull opportunity to learn
more about the inner workings of linux" rather than the comforts of having a
newbie take some of the workload off your shoulders. JMHO


Good luck

&gt; Hey all :)
&gt; I have setup a linux / samba based system acting essentially as a
&gt; replacement for a NT server.. it validates passwords, personal files are
&gt; kept on a mapped drive etc...
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering for ease of use, if there are any web based administration
&gt; programs for samba available.  The reason I want this, is so this person
&gt; [who is relatively unfamiliar with UNIX], can easily add users [using a
&gt; certain shell, asking for password, group, and also does smbpasswd -a USER
&gt; and with the same password], delete users, and add / delete / modify shares.
&gt;
&gt; This would have to be in a REALLY (let me stress the word REALLY) easy to
&gt; use web administration package.
&gt;
&gt; I have looked at SWAT and WEBMIN, I am unsure if these are user
&gt; customisable, but they are too "bloatful"... any more options than nessecary
&gt; will confuse and entice this person to play with settings and could be
&gt; somewhat disasterous :)
&gt;
&gt; Any help will be appreciated
