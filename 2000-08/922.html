thanks a lot. helps a great deal... haven't seen a reference to
chkconfig at all and that seems to be the key. :-) i take it that an RPM
would generally call chkconfig on installation to add services to the
init ? 

i now have a couple of other questions on NIS...

i am trying to setup a NIS master server on a network with linux and
win98 PC's. just trying to get the server running first and hoping for
NFS and samba after lunch.

the nis domain is set in /etc/sysconfig/network and i have built the
db's for password, group and host for that domain ok. the server runs
fine and, starting ypbind myself, i can use ypcat to see the tables.

1st question: on the server, should i use NIS when looking for password,
group and host info? seemed to me to be the right thing to do - so i
have attempted to run the client stuff on the server as well. 

[even tho its the master server for the domain, isn't including a nis
client the right thing to do to get info from other nis domains for
example]? is this crazy?

i have setup yp.conf with a single entry:

 ypserver localhost

and the nsswitch.conf to look for:

  password: files nis
  groups : file nis
  hosts: files nis
  
  and the rest as just files.

there seems to be a couple of problems:

- ypbind starts before ypserv and looks forlornly for ypserv and
fails... 

- when it comes to login, i can login (so i guess the password comes
from the local file ok), but i get an error message about ypbind not
being bound for the domain... if the password is coming from the file,
why does nis have anything to do with it ?

- if i fanangle the start order and get ypserv up first, ypbind starts
without complaint but login hangs after password entry and ctrl-c shows
that "yp_all: clnt_call : RPC timed out"

to me, the howto seems silent on howto/whetherto configure the client on
a server. seems like its the right thing to do but maybe that is sambuca
for breakfast.

confused,

  leah
