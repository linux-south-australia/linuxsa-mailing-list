&gt; if use ipchains to prevent *outgoing* connections to these sites.

That, unfortunately, involves a lot of manual maintenance.

&gt; incidently, when you try to ping these sites, you get:
&gt; ping: sendto: Operation not permitted

You're blatting everything?  It would be better to only block
port 80 traffic to the site; if you had to send mail there,
and the MTA resided on your computer, you'd be in all sorts
of trouble.

&gt; also, doubleclick is hard to pin down, as they seem to rotate the dns
&gt; slowly. its not like www.hotmail.com, where you get many DNS entries,
&gt; but, for example, m.doubclick.net changes about once a week. seems they
&gt; know people are trying to filter out their site. :)

This is my point.  Done in squid (or a 3rd party junkbuster product),
you can do both DNS lookups (to avoid the above) _and_ block on a
partial URL, so something like www.deja.com/adverts/* can be blocked,
but other traffic allowed through.
