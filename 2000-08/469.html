I rang them also, Apparently it is Satellite, not microwave
It is possible to use in a linux system, and will take the same kind of
setup
as ihug's sat service, although chello will in no way support or install
on a linux system, nor do they allow more then one computer to access the
internet
via the service, one person from tech support *tried* to tell me
due to there setup, It was imposable to use more then one computer
via there service (Im unsure as to how they would do this, maybe in windows
they could, but I doubt it very much in linux.)

So in answer to your questions, Yes there is other services like this in
Australia
try www.ihug.com.au/satnet and I believe telstra to a flat rate version as
well
located at <A HREF="http://www.bigpond.net/advance/satellite/pricing.asp">http://www.bigpond.net/advance/satellite/pricing.asp</A>
there are a few other ones that I know of, one that is adelaide only based
is www.dsw.com.au

and yes you can use it on linux, but you will get no support what-so-ever
from chello.

hope this helps.

Regards,
Adam Crawford

Subject: Austar Broadband...



Hi List,
I got a mailer from my pay-TV provider alerting me to the fact that from the
end
of Sept. '00 I will be able to access Austar's "Chello"
Broadband internet service with a guaranteed download speed of 256Kbs...via
microwave.
What is available in broadband in South Australia at the moment?
A phone call to Austar revealed the following...
This system  uses microwave downlink and a modem uplink.
A PCI board will need to be installed in your computer with associated
 cabling, dishes etc.etc.
When I asked about supported operating systems you all know the answer!!!!
The telephone support person sighed, "Not another Linux question" when I
mentioned
that I was using Linux for internet access... must have a few inquiries
already I guess...
This will be a win95/98 ("No winNT/2000 at this stage")
Is this service or another like it available in Australia?
Can/has it been "Hacked" for linux?
Is it really as fast as they say it is?
The cost , Austar tells me will be $49.95 per month - unlimited downloads,
5 email address and 10 mb of web page space
Sound good but I guess we'll have to wait and see...
