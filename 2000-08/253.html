&gt;     I checked out both of these but had no luck getting either to run.

Ah.  Forgot to point out that I've used neither of these product.
They're just bookmarked at the bottom of my ToDo list, somewhere
near the "Getalife" entry (Item #infinity - 4).  I have an interim
solution that I use here which is to block accesses to those
addresses at my squid proxy, but it sucks with Netscape as Netscape
throws up those "Error! URL could not be downloaded" mesages where
the images are supposed to be (one, maybe both of the above solutions
substitutes a (possibly transparent) gif for the image), and there
are some pages which I have to turn off proxy access in order to
view (some very weird interaction with doubleclick, which I haven't
had the time to trace down).

&gt; A bit more reading and a bit more configuring and I'll probably be back here
&gt; before you know it in exactly the same situation.

That's the spirit!

&gt; I've always muddled along by myself, but now I can just ask you (plural) :)

Oops, more hopes dashed.

&gt; There must be something I can do for you?

Well, I have been hankering to take up the axe again ... (I have
two here, collecting dust (sniff) :-( ).
