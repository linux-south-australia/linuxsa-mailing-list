"Hullo" from Latitude 42º 43' North, Longitude 84º 34' West.  (Only 12
hrs, half a planet and two seasons away from your neighborhood.)

I am struggling with a password expiration problem, and am hoping to
find someone that can assist me.

I have a Red Hat 6.0 server running Samba 2.0.6.   This server is
configured as both a Primary Domain Controller and a WINS server.  All
other machines on our network are Win9x clients.  The Samba security
option is set to Domain, and password caching has been turned off for
the Windows clients.  Samba and Linux passwords are synchronized.

My problem is that the Windows login will not require the user to change
their password when the Linux password has expired.  The Windows user
will be able to continue using the same password forever to log into the
Samba server as long as they don't ever again login "directly" to Linux
(only then would they be forced to change their password.)

I have been unable to locate any documentation on how to resolve this.
Is this one of the NT Primary Domain Controller features that they
haven't yet figured out how to emulate on Samba?  Or is there something
simple I'm missing?  I have a hard time imagining that Samba can't
emulate an NT server for this purpose.

I appreciate any insight anyone has to offer.
