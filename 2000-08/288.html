Hi Stephen,

I don't know anything about permanent connections. We have been with
Bigpond for about a month now. It's pretty quick, well, the quickest ISP
we had so far.
There would be only one little observation to make. With the other ISP's
we stayed connected even if someone would pick up the phone only to find
out it was busy with Net. With Bigpond, as soon as someone picks the
phone up ( you can call it a receiver, if you wish ), your connection is
lost and if you feel like being on line, you need to connect again!

Best wishes,

Nick.

&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong here guys (hmm don't know I should bother saying that
&gt; the smell of blood makes this list turn into vampires) ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the ACCC is currently investigating complaints re telstra holding up
&gt; the DSL loop access for competitors for TESTING purposes and we cannot expect
&gt; too much in the way of competition until next year at the earliest.
&gt; 
&gt; Intel used a tactic similar: let the courts decide in we have sued them
&gt; wrongly, meanwhile we will continue shipping and they can beg the USA courts
&gt; for a fast resolution .. nuff said.
&gt; 
&gt; But yes I will wait a bit too, Tel$tra is too much like M$ for my liking
