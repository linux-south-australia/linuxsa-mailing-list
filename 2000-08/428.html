LOL...
you could have just told him to go read the NAT howto... it explains it all :)

BTW....
Wouldnt it depend on the game server if two machines on the same LAN via NAT could connect and play?
I thought it wouldnt be a problem unless the game server checked for multiple connections from the same IP addr.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; Ok, now for extra value marks, try to get two clients on the same NAT'ted

&gt;  &gt; &gt; Beginning to see the point now?
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; ok, so my understanding of NAT just flew out the window. I thought NAT
&gt;  &gt; was the process of "wrapping" the internal packet with another that had
&gt;  &gt; a real world IP.
&gt;  
&gt; No, it doesn't do that at all.  
&gt; 
&gt; Think of NAT as being a bit like a cross between a proxy and IP-forwarding
&gt; (routing).  An explanation is below, followed by a discussion of implications
&gt; for gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; Consider TCP.  A TCP session from 192.168.1.1's web browser to 150.101.89.3's
&gt; web server begins like this:
&gt; 
&gt;     Client 192.168.1.1                           Server 150.101.89.3
&gt; 
&gt;     TCP flags: SYN
&gt;     ip_src = 192.168.1.1       |
&gt;     ip_dst = 150.101.89.3      |-----------------------&gt;
&gt;     tcp_sport = 21436 (random) |
&gt;     tcp_dport = 80
&gt; 
&gt;                                                  TCP flags: SYN ACK
&gt;                                                | ip_src = 150.101.89.3
&gt;                         &lt;----------------------| ip_dst = 192.168.1.1
&gt;                                                | tcp_sport = 80
&gt;                                                  tcp_dport = 21436
&gt; 
&gt;      TCP flags: ACK
&gt;      ip_src = 192.168.1.1      |
&gt;      ip_dst = 150.101.89.3     |-----------------------&gt;
&gt;      tcp_sport = 21436         |
&gt;      tcp_dport = 80
&gt; 
&gt; After that 3-way handshake, actual data transfer can begin.
&gt; 
&gt; The packets concerned probably travel through all kinds of routers
&gt; to get from 192.168.1.1 to 150.101.89.3.  There are two major assumptions
&gt; which color the interpretation of the packets under discussion:
&gt; 
&gt;    1.  Each router passes through the packets with the headers intact;  and
&gt; 
&gt;    2.  The destination addresses are always routable (i.e.: both conversants
&gt;        are using "real" IP addresses).
&gt; 
&gt; According to RFC 1597 and RFC 1918, 192.168.0.0/16 addresses aren't actually
&gt; routable, so my example above wouldn't really work:  Routers on the Internet
&gt; don't know how to reach any IP address which starts with 192.168.x.y.  So,
&gt; let's think about what a NAT gateway could do to address that issue.
&gt; 
&gt; A NAT gateway will receive an "inside" packet described by the tuple
&gt; (ip_src, tcp_sport) and remap the IP address so that it's routable (usually,
&gt; but not always, by substituting its own IP address).  So, if a NAT gateway
&gt; has an external IP address of 203.56.192.40, it'll take an input packet
&gt; which looks like (ip_src, tcp_sport) = (192.168.1.1, x) and emit 
&gt; (203.56.192.40, x) to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; It can't stop there, though.  Remember that the 192.168.x.y hosts don't
&gt; know that they're talking through a NAT gateway, so there is the potential
&gt; (and, indeed, the likelihood) that more than one host will attempt to use
&gt; the same source port number;  As a result, the NAT gateway also needs
&gt; to make-up a new value for "tcp_sport" to replace "x" in the tuple above.
&gt; So we might end up with (192.168.1.1, 21436) being mapped to 
&gt; (203.56.192.40, 16765).
&gt; 
&gt; The NAT gateway needs to remember this mapping, because the server in
&gt; the outside world will be sending packets back to whatever host is mentioned
&gt; in a packet's ip_src field, which will be 203.56.192.40 in this case.  So,
&gt; after making a mapping like the one described above, the NAT gateway also
&gt; needs to know that any packets received from the Internet addressed to
&gt; 203.56.192.40 port 16765 should be forwarded on to 192.168.1.1 port 21436.
&gt; The NAT gateway also needs to monitor the state of the connection;  When it
&gt; sees TCP FIN packets being exchanged (signifying the tear-down of a
&gt; connection), or TCP RST packets, or various ICMP packets, or whatever, it
&gt; needs to know that it's safe to "forget" the mapping it has built up for
&gt; that connection.  Each mapping takes up a finite amount of memory, so 
&gt; we can't keep hoarding them forever (and there's no point keeping them 
&gt; after a connection has died anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; It's also possible to set up "static mappings".  So, if your web server
&gt; is running on the "inside" host 192.168.1.62, you might tell your NAT
&gt; gateway that any packets with a destination of 203.56.192.40 port 80 should
&gt; be remapped to 192.168.1.62 port 80.  The same usually holds true for UDP.
&gt; Often you can use IP aliases on a single NAT gateway if more than one IP
&gt; address is routed to it, so that your NAT gateway can "pretend" to be 
&gt; multiple "inside" machines.
&gt; 
&gt; Now let's address this to games in an ADSL environment.  You have *one*
&gt; IP address, so there can be no IP aliasing.  You have a game which expects
&gt; to see a games server out on the Internet somewhere on, say, port 7777.
&gt; However, furthermore, you often also find that the game server will
&gt; communicate with the client on port 7777 as well.  
&gt; 
&gt; That means you can't have more than one "inside" host playing the game
&gt; at once.  Why?  Because the game server will be transmitting UDP packets to
&gt; (external_ip_address, 7777), and your NAT gateway will be making a decision
&gt; to forward those packets to exactly *one* internal host.  You can only 
&gt; map port 7777 to one internal IP address;  as such, the game could be said
&gt; to be NAT-hostile.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to play Unreal Tournament, or Tribes, or Counterstrike, or 
&gt; any of countless other games through a NAT gateway, you first need to
&gt; make sure that the game server won't be "insisting" on a particular port
&gt; number for the client.  And, in many (most?) cases you'll find that that
&gt; isn't the case.
&gt; 
&gt; So, that doesn't mean you can't play games through a NAT gateway;  It
&gt; just means that there isn't a whole lot of point in inviting your friends
&gt; over to share the LPB experience, because only one of you will be able
&gt; to play at a time.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Are you saying that NAT simply marks the packet with a single bit
&gt;  &gt; change?
&gt; 
&gt; No, it remaps the IP source address and TCP/UDP source port for outbound
&gt; packets, and the IP destination address and TCP/UDP destination port for
&gt; inbound packets.
&gt; 
&gt; What you described in your paragraph above is called "tunnelling", and
&gt; it has nothing to do with NAT.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; If you're suggesting that only one NAT client can play at a
&gt;  &gt; time, I'm I right?
&gt; 
&gt; Bingo.
