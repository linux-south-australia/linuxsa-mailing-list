Hi Paul,

Did you get answers to your questions?

&gt; &gt; /dev/dsp is a soundcard thing. try disabling sound from either you
&gt; &gt; window manager (probably enlightenment) or gnome. or both :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; tje Gdk error is something that I saw quite a bit of, but didn't
&gt; &gt; generally cause a problem. Generally. You might consider checking your
&gt; &gt; version of gnome to ensure it isn;t too old.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But to have a problem just start is odd. there is always a reason.
&gt;
&gt; That's a reassuring thing to say, and thanks, but I submitted a post
&gt; recently (Manual problems (newbie question)) where a couple of
&gt; unexpected things were coming up in respect of man pages.  Also, to find
&gt; out I had a *way* outdated version of bash was also kind of unexpected
&gt; (yes, searching for "shopt" once again!) ... so on and so forth.
&gt;
&gt; I'm having a lot of sort of unexpected results with Linux recently (e.g.
&gt; Netscape Communicator just hangs or just vanishes, gnome-terminal
&gt; vanishes as soon as it comes up, missing links, etc.) that are sort of
&gt; disheartening to run into again and again.  Also, coming to Linux from
&gt; Windows there are lots of entirely new concepts (shell scripting, piping
&gt; and redirection, partition management, boot loaders, permissions, et
&gt; cetera, et cetera, et cetera) to come to terms with as well.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, coming from an applications background (although I've been
&gt; working with Web development for the last two years or so), it's a very
&gt; new kind of environment for me with its emphasis on systems
&gt; administration (rather than solely running a couple of productivity
&gt; apps).
&gt;
&gt; Add to that the tools and utilities in Linux (such as vi and emacs and
&gt; man pages and sed) are also new ways of working, and each has its own
&gt; learning curve ... yeah, it's been pretty frustrating and overwhelming
&gt; of late.
&gt;
&gt; R,
&gt;
&gt; Paul.
