Hi!
My RH 6.2 system is hanging at the graphical login, with breif screen =
flashes and simultaneous hard drive accessing. Seems like an X crash to =
me, but I have no understanding as to why this occurred. Was using Star =
Office when I think it choked on some Java and died, afterwards on =
trying to hang up the modem using the gnome pppdialer it failed to =
disconnect with the software, tried killing the 3P but still didnt close =
the port. Decided to log out of my user account, and log back in. At =
this point, the login screen kept reappearing ie. my user account was =
not being accessed. Decided on a reboot to reinitialise the system, and =
vuala!!! I have an X hang.
Did a rescue with the 6.2 disk, all the data to initialise the system is =
still there, kernels fine, directory structure is fine but the GUI's =
wont go up.
HHHEEELLLP!!!!!
Kym
