Hi Andrew,

Do these new rules apply to running pieces of cable between a few pc's and 
making a small lan.

&gt; Hi Andrew,
&gt;
&gt; Sorry for the delay in answering your e-mail.
&gt;
&gt; Currently, any person who installs customer cabling must hold a current
&gt; ACA/Austel cabling licence. A Restricted licence covers the domestic
&gt; scene
&gt; where no more than two lines terminate on sockets. A General or BCL
&gt; covers
&gt; all areas of cabling along with any endorsements required for
&gt; specialised
&gt; cabling.
&gt;
&gt; A Security installer who is going to instal a mode 3 skt for his alarm
&gt; system must have the appropriate licence. The only exemption is that
&gt; they
&gt; currently do not need a licence from the ACA to instal the cabling from
&gt; the
&gt; alarm panel back to the sensors and control pads.
&gt; This is the same for tech's who instal data cabling for LANs. From the
&gt; modem
&gt; to network, licence required, from modem back to computers, exempt.But
&gt; in
&gt; all cases must instal to the wiring standards and use compliant cable.
&gt;
&gt; Plugging in of equipment to installed sockets does not require a
&gt; licence.
&gt;
&gt; Under the new scheme of CPRs, the current exemption will cease to exist.
&gt; This means that a person who performs any cabling which eventually will
&gt; have
&gt; a connection to a carrier's network must be registered as a cabler.
&gt; ie. if you instal LAN cabling which will connect via a modem, you will
&gt; have
&gt; to be a registered cabler.
&gt;
&gt; If you have further concerns, please give me a ring on (xx) xxxx xxxx
&gt; and I
&gt; will be pleased to clarify.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
