&gt; If it did it wouldn't report it to Alan.  The whole point of the

&gt; compromised, and thereby permits others to read your subsequent

&gt; much as you like and it won't find any problems there.

My point here was that ASIO (or some other organisation legally
permitted to carry out criminal activities in the interests
of stopping crime) might _legally_ hack my machine and
replace my keyring with a compromised keyring which would
induce me to send secret stuff which could be read by ASIO
(or some other etc.).

When the Australian federal govt passed a law a few months ago
permitting ASIO to hack into computers to compromise security
(and encryption keys in particular), I had assumed that this
would be essentially pointless, because of the way that PGP works.

My point was that this bug in PGP is precisely the kind of thing
which _does_ permit ASIO to fool users into using a compromised
key-ring.

If found this item at wired:

<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0</A>,1282,38437,00.html

with the title "pretty good bug found in PGP"!
They've expressed it very tidily and crisply.

But presumably ASIO could also compromise my PGP executable and
source software as well as the key-ring.
In the case of the Unixes, PGP is supposed to be okay.
But right now, all those Windows users round the world using PGP
are in big trouble.
They are not only easy to hack, but also easy to fool regarding
their PGP software.
Someone could sneek over to a work-mates windows PC during lunch and
add an ADK to each of the user's public keys held on their key-ring.
And that would be the end of their privacy.
I imagine that ASIO already knows how to do this, and hackers
have probably written software for this over the weekend.

And that....  is where veracity would come in.
My point was that with some kind of file alteration detection,
people could know if their key-ring has been compromised.

Hmmmm.  
I think that the ADK can be added to a public public-key,
but I wonder if this can be done to a key-ring.
I think I read in the Simson and Garfinkel book that 
only secret keys in the key-ring are encrypted.

Anyway, back to the grindstone for me....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
