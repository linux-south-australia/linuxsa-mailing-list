&gt; I've just detected a scan to my SMTP port as follows:

&gt; SYN (#10)
&gt; 
&gt; This belongs to netcom.ca which appears to be part of AT&T Canada's
&gt; Network. Has anyone else detected any such scans etc from this network?

You are, of course, kidding, right?

All joking aside, expect to see this sort of thing constantly.  If
you were logging your netbios ports, you would see them been probed
constantly as well.  It's a given these days; it doesn't matter
that you're not listed in an MX record anywhere, these people are
scanning for open SMTP ports, probably to dump the latest lot of
spam on you (some wear white hats, but most wear black).

(Unfortunately, with my email address appearing in mailing-list
archives more frequently, my incidence of getting SPAM'd is on
the increase :-(.  ).
