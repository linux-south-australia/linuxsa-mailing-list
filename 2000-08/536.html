I haven't changed any settings in the bios, except to turn virus protection
of when trying to write to the MBR.  However, I must admit that I did notice
a bios error (write error if I remember correctly) when the install was
shutting down;
that I could never figure out what was causing it, or what it meant.

&gt; Hi John,
&gt;  
&gt;  Often this has to do with Linux and your Bios arguing about the drive size /
&gt;  
&gt;  geometry (heads, cylinders & lba mode). Have you changed the hard drive 
&gt;  settings in the Bios after you installed Linux?

&gt;  &gt; Greetings,
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I'm trying to install RedHat 6.2 for a friend on his brand
&gt;  &gt; new computer (Athlon 700 Thunderbird). However, I think
&gt;  &gt; LILO is not installing correctly.	I can't verify that it is LILO
&gt;  &gt; all I get when trying to boot is a never ending sequence of
&gt;  &gt; "0 1 0 1 0...."   I am able to get into Linux using LOADLIN,
&gt;  &gt; it has some problem loading modules if I use that method.
&gt;  &gt; I've tried writing to the MBR, & the linux partition either way all
&gt;  &gt; I get is a screen full of garbage.  My friend thinks it might
&gt;  &gt; be due to the fact that it is an Athlon but I don't think so....
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I guess my questions are:
&gt;  &gt;  1. Has anyone got RedHat 6.2 or any other version of linux to run on a
&gt;  &gt; Athlon? 2. Is there any replacement software to LILO??
&gt;  &gt;  3. Any hypothesis as to why LILO is acting like this??
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Thanks again for your wise counsel :)
