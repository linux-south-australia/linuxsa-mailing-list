Longish Comp Sci question.

While working on a linux-ATM driver, I've come across a little
comp sci question which is fairly general.

Quite often, you get a signal or interrupt accompanied by
a status mask. In this case, I have a 32-bit mask, in which
13 independent status bits might be set.
(In select-returns for unix I/O, you get potentially very large
arrays of status bits indeed, into the hundreds or thousands.)

One way to handle this is

==========================================================
typedef unsigned long u32;

void interrupt_handler(u32 status) {
    if (status & MASK1) {
	// handle event 1.
	}
    if (status & MASK2) {
	// handle event 2.
	}
    // ....
    if (status & MASK31) {
	// handle event 31.
	}
    }
==========================================================

Usually there are at most one or two conditions that would
be set. So this takes 32 tests to find 1 or 2 events.
When you're handling the arrival of ATM cells once every 2.7 uS,
you can't afford to waste this much time.

So I thought I would do this:
[Option A is a technique which I won't show here, because it
doesn't raise the comp sci question. But it uses an a priori
guess at the relative probabilities and urgencies of each
event type.]

Option B:

==========================================================
void interrupt_handler(u32 status) {
    while (status) {
	// Pick out the right-most event.
        u32 x = status ^ (status & (status - 1));

	// Handle the single event in "x".
	// ....

	status ^= ~x;
	}
    }
==========================================================

Now after the single right most bit in "status" has been
extracted as "x", I have a 32-bit word which contains a
unique bit. Now how do I call the right piece of code to 
handle this?

I can't do a switch on 0x80000000, 0x40000000... 0x00000001,
because that would make things take even longer than the
original slow code.
I can't do a computed goto, because the range of "x" is
now from 1 to 0x80000000.
I.e. I can't just do a table lookup.

One possibility is I take the OR of the 8-bit bytes of "x"
and use a 256-table lookup, and then test to see which
byte the event-bit was set in.
That also sounds a little clumsy.

What I really need is a hash algorithm which maps
the set of all 1-bit masks to a 5-bit integer.
I.e. I need a function to give me the _position_ of
the bit, given the 1-bit bit-mask.

I can sort of think of something:

u32 y1 = (x | (x &gt;&gt; 8) | (x &gt;&gt; 16) | (x &gt;&gt; 24)) & 0xff;
u32 y2 = (x | (x &gt;&gt; 9) | (x &gt;&gt; 18) | (x &gt;&gt; 27)) & 0x1ff;
u32 y = y1 | y2;

Then I use a 9-bit look-up on this.
I think that y should contain two set bits which uniquely
(but redundantly) identify the original set bit in "x".
Then I just need a 512-byte table lookup.

But this seems a bit slow too.

==========================================================
QUESTION:       
Does anyone know of a really fast algorithm to return the
bit position of a 32-bit word which is known to have
only one set bit?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. The CDC 6400 mainframe in 1972 used to have an assembly
language instruction to count the number of bits in a 60-bit
word. It took 68 cycles for a 10 MHz clock.
If the number of set bits is small, the above
algorithm using x & (x - 1) is much quicker.
I sometimes wonder if this is a generally known fact.
But this _is_ Sunday. The day of idle musing.
