OK, I believe you.. :o)

 

&gt; OK.  AGP is the bus type of the video card.  8 Mbyte is the amount of memory
&gt; is has.  This tells us nothing about the chipset or brand of the adapter in
&gt; question.  It sounds suspiciously like on-board video.  Approach with
&gt; caution.  Although if you're buying EDO it sounds like you're NOT upgrading
&gt; your motherboard.  Does your motherboard even have an AGP slot???

I don't think my comp has an AGP slot, I was just asking for help.

&gt; I don't have much experience with modern video cards and linux, but I would
&gt; suggest a well known chipset like the TNT2.  You should be able to buy a
&gt; Microstar 8Mbyte TNT2 AGP M64 card for around $120-130ish.  There are also
&gt; 16 and 32 Mbyte versions.
&gt; 
&gt; These should work well with any nVidia TNT2 drivers that are out there for
&gt; Linux.  Anyone have anything further?

Thanks for all the info!
 
 
&gt; It's going to cost you.  Lots.

Why do you say that? There might be some people out there that want to
get rid of some?
 
&gt; If you can afford it, buy a new box.  It's really the smarter alternative.

With three computers at home? You want me linched. My wife would skin me
alive!

&gt; The purchase of computer hardware and the notion of saving money are
&gt; generally incompatible.  However, I wish you the best of luck.

All I need is to give it a bit of boost, just to keep me going for a
year or so. I am pretty sure there is a solution to it.
