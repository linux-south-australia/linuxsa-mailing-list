David!

&gt; On rebooting I got the RH boot window but could not log on, ie CDE would not
&gt; boot up.

You seem to have chosen run level 5 which is the X window login manager.
Alternatively you've typed startx or some such thing and X has crashed.
The easiest way to diagnose X problems is to start X from the command
line. This means you'll have to boot into runlevel 3 or lower. Here's a
way to force this:

[reboot]
lilo: linux single
{computer waffle}
# vi /etc/inittab
{change the default runlevel to 3}
# reboot

Once you've done that, relog and then do something like:

# startx 2&gt; x.log

or 

# X -probeonly 2&gt; x.log

Read the logs. They might give you a better idea of what is going wrong.

&gt; CDE is essentially network based (whatever that means).

X is a network (client/server) based protocol. The server (the thing
that displays the graphics on the screen) serves the client (the program
that is running). 

&gt; My error log file
&gt; contains the message
 
&gt;         I/O error on display:myhostname:0.0
&gt;         dtsession:connection to server lost - exiting

Knowing RedHat installs as I do, they don't set up X if there's one
slight error. One slight error and RedHat X installations go totally
west. You could try using XF86Setup or Xconfigurator..

&gt; I would very much like to be able to recover from this rather than lose all
&gt; my data by reinstalling. Incidentally, I do not have CDE disks to reinstall
&gt; that again, although I fancy that if I did I would encounter the same
&gt; problem.

Does RH 6.2 come with CDE?
