A while back there was a thread about new cabling rules. I had
(computer) issues at the time, so didn't get involved (other than
perhaps sparking it off by talking to friends about it off list - I've
been doing the Base Cabling Licence course at TAFE. A very worthwhile
way to spend your time). But I did get around to emailing the ACA to
find out exactly what was going on. So, for those that do a bit of LAN
cabling here and there, here is what the ACA has to say. (Thanks to Mark
for permission to post his reply in the public forum):

Hi Andrew,

Sorry for the delay in answering your e-mail.

Currently, any person who installs customer cabling must hold a current
ACA/Austel cabling licence. A Restricted licence covers the domestic
scene
where no more than two lines terminate on sockets. A General or BCL
covers
all areas of cabling along with any endorsements required for
specialised
cabling.

A Security installer who is going to instal a mode 3 skt for his alarm
system must have the appropriate licence. The only exemption is that
they
currently do not need a licence from the ACA to instal the cabling from
the
alarm panel back to the sensors and control pads.
This is the same for tech's who instal data cabling for LANs. From the
modem
to network, licence required, from modem back to computers, exempt.But
in
all cases must instal to the wiring standards and use compliant cable.

Plugging in of equipment to installed sockets does not require a
licence.

Under the new scheme of CPRs, the current exemption will cease to exist.
This means that a person who performs any cabling which eventually will
have
a connection to a carrier's network must be registered as a cabler.
ie. if you instal LAN cabling which will connect via a modem, you will
have
to be a registered cabler.

If you have further concerns, please give me a ring on (xx) xxxx xxxx
and I
will be pleased to clarify.

Via the phone, Mark also pointed me to
<A HREF="http://www.aca.gov.au/standards/cprs/CPR">http://www.aca.gov.au/standards/cprs/CPR</A>%20Guide.pdf for those that want
to read the little ACA brochure on the changes.

PS. Yes, I deleted his phone number so that he's not swamped with calls
:-)

Cheers,
