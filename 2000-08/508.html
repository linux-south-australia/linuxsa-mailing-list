Tell me about it.

I am trying to get information out of my ISP (Primus) regarding the configuration of their NT RAS server (which they tell me that they use) so I can forward this information on to discussion groups, Linux vendors, you name it.

The told me that MS is not enforcing a monopoly by forcing people to use MS operating systems.  I replied that this is not the issue, that here they have people willing to do all the research and hard work for them and they still don't care.

I would have though that companies would leap at the opportunity to get volunteers to happily work to promote their products, yet very few do.

I smell something very fishy.

&gt;
&gt;This has always struck me as odd.  At a CT (Computer telephony) show
&gt;several years Dialogic (a leading supplier of PC telephony hardware)
&gt;publically stated that they were sick of being asked about offering
&gt;Linux support (although they have now finally "caved in").  You would
&gt;think that offering the customer a product that they actually wanted
&gt;would be in their best interests, wouldn't you?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
