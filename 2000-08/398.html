&gt; I have just seen a FreeBSD system with 135 or so IP aliases. I briefly

Someone on linux-net (in tha past day or so) had a machine with 7000
aliases on it; not sure whether it was a production machine or not (I
suspect it was just a whatif).  It took a while to run ifconfig, but
otherwise was fine.  The consensus was that the limitation would be
in the kernel, whatever that was.

&gt; Does anyone know what the limits are in either case?

"7000 ip aliases ought to be enough for anybody."

If you had a machine with that many aliases on, maybe it's time to
rethink the application.  I'm not sure how well the kernel's networking
stack would cope.
