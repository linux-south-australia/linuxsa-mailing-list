&gt; Heyas,
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, in this case, I believe the problem is that Windows has reset the
&gt; Active partition to it's partition, which running lilo will not fix.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From Windows, restart into DOS mode, and run fdisk. Then go to option 2 (set
&gt; active partition) and make sure you select your /boot partition
&gt; (/dev/hda1??).
&gt; 

PC disks are set up roughly as the following.

  o The first sector on the disk is the master boot record.  Generally the default
    (read Windows) MBR contains code that looks at the partition table (also in the
    MBR) and then takes loads and runs the first sector of the active partition.

  o The first sector on the partition is the boot sector.  It contains code to boot
    the OS itself.

When Windows is installed it will overwrite the MBR with the active partition scanning one.
To set a Linux partition to boot as the active you *must* have LILO or something similar
installed in the boot sector of the partition.

When LILO is run it re-writes the MBR (or the Boot Sector depending on what you have
configured) with a small program which then hooks in and loads data from your /boot
directory.  To boot Windows, all LILO does is load the Boot sector from the windows partition
and away we go.  The SYS command under windows sets up the MBR and Boot Sector to play
nice.

So, basically you need to boot Linux again (You did create a boot disk when you where asked
during your install didn't you?) become root and then re-run LILO.  (As has been suggested).

For those who didn't make the boot disk at install time, RH has a 'mkbootdisk' program
to make this easier.

Regards,

Matthew
