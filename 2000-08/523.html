Hi All,
    This problem gets stranger and stranger. IP Forwarding
was my first guess too, but I thought it was configured,
certainly linuxconf told me it was. When I checked the proc
file below, sure enough it was set to 0, so I then checked
the Network file and it WAS set to FORWARD_IPv4 = true.

    O.K. so here is the wierd part. I did manually set
ip_forward to 1 and had another go and it still didn't work
so I went to surf the online docs (since the server was
connected online) and I suddenly couldn't surf at all. I
tried a route command, and this hung. I tried a ifconfig
command and it said eth0 was suddenly missing. O.K. back to
linuxconf - everything checks out. The problem still exists.
So I tried to ping the Telstra router to trace where it was
falling over and I got a host unreachable error. Then I
tried to ping the internal network, same thing happenned.
Hmm, what is going on? The modem is still connected to
Telstra, the network card is still connected to the hub and
the rest of the network and appears to be passing data
normally, the network talks to other machines in the
network. O.K. reboot. Same thing happens. Out of interest I
ring Telstra and ask about their router just in case (I am
connected to lon22 the most unreliable router in the
country - I now take no chances) even though the new site is
connected to another router. As I ring them and reboot again
to start clean, everything comes good, except the
forwarding. Telstra do a few checks and ping me, I ping
them, the route command works, I connect to their webpages
etc. Then as I am talking, everything goes haywire again. I
am at a loss. I suspect either a dodgy network card (3Com
509B) or some other problem with my copy of RH 6.2 (APC
latest offering) The site was set up as a virgin install. I
am still at a loss. If it is a dodgy network card, why does
it take out the routing etc from the server/net side that
isn't connected at all to the hub? Any help would be most
appreciated.
    Thanks,
        Andrew.


&gt;
&gt;Sounds like IP forwarding isn't enabled.
&gt;
&gt;cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
&gt;
&gt;should return '1'. If it doesn't, then:
&gt;
&gt;echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
&gt;
&gt;and see if that helps. If it does, then you want to modify
the
&gt;/etc/sysconfig/network file so it includes:
&gt;
&gt;FORWARD_IPV4=true
&gt;
