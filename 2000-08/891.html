Hello again,

I meant £150 or about 400AUD

Bye

-----Original Message-----
Hello all,

Thanks to everyone who has offered advice about the best CPU for the job. I
will read through all the info and decide at the weekend.

I am also looking for some sort of backup device (around $200) that works
well under linux - preferably IDE. Does anyone have any experience in this
area or can anyone make any suggestions.

TIA

Dave
