&gt; &gt;Hi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Linux newbie here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yep, it's more directory stuff with bash.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, this time I'm reporting success.  I wanted to have a script
&gt; &gt;that listed out hidden directories and counted them (also including the
&gt; &gt;non-hidden directories too).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It wasn't that easy, and for that reason alone I'm posting the code to
&gt; &gt;the list so other newbies maybe don't have to spend hours and hours
&gt; &gt;struggling with commands and switches to list hidden directories.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Here it is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;#!/bin/sh
&gt; &gt;echo
&gt; &gt;num=0
&gt; &gt;hid=0
&gt; &gt;for somevar in $(ls); do
&gt; 
&gt;                 ^^^^^   This is not portable. It is a bashism. Use `ls` ...
&gt;                         unless you need nesting.

So what you're saying here is always put command substitutions in single
quotes as standard practice?  (For example, $(ls -al) should instead be
$('ls -al') for portability reasons.  Is that right?)

You've made it clear that portability is an important consideration in
shell scripting, but it wasn't something I was really taking into
account when trying to code this script (obviously a Linux and Unix
newbie :) ).  Should portability be given top priority when writing
shell scripts?  And if so, is a programmer kind of constrained into a
lowest-common-denominator subset of commands when writing for
portability across various types of shells?

I guess I'm really asking here if programming for one shell (say, bash)
is greatly different to programming for other shells (say, the Korn
shell).

&gt; &gt;  if [ -d $somevar ]
&gt; &gt;    then
&gt; &gt;      echo "$somevar/"
&gt; &gt;      num=$[num+1]
&gt; &gt;  fi
&gt; &gt;done
&gt; &gt;if let $[$num &gt; 0]; then
&gt; &gt;  echo;
&gt; &gt;fi
&gt; &gt;for anothervar in $(ls -ad .[a-zA-Z0-9]*); do
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm, what was wrong with:
&gt; 
&gt;   shopt -s dotglob
&gt;   for f in *; do
&gt; 
&gt; Which will pick up all files, including hidden files. However, 'shopt' may
&gt; be nonportable as well :-)

As superuser, I searched the man pages for both 'shopt' and 'dotglob'
using man -K but couldn't find any.  I then tried 'locate shopt' and
'locate dotglob' but got nothing.  I then checked the Camel book, 2nd
edition, looking for either shopt or dotglob but there were no entries
in the index.

What's 'shopt' and what's 'dotglob'?  Where do I get them?

&gt; Also, using $(...), like `...`, will not correctly handle files with spaces
&gt; in their names.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  if [ -d $anothervar ]
&gt; &gt;    then
&gt; &gt;      echo -e "$anothervar/\t[hidden]"
&gt; &gt;      num=$[num+1]
&gt; &gt;      hid=$[hid+1]
&gt; &gt;  fi
&gt; &gt;done
&gt; &gt;if let $[$hid &gt; 0]; then
&gt; &gt;  echo;
&gt; &gt;fi
&gt; &gt;echo -e "($num directories, $hid hidden)\n"
&gt; &gt;exit 0
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The other reason for posting this to the list is to confirm one thing:
&gt; &gt;is it true that to make a hidden file or directory, all you have to do
&gt; &gt;is prefix the file name or directory name with a full-stop?  I mean, I
&gt; &gt;guessed that was the way things worked and so I've coded based on that
&gt; &gt;guess ... but I just wanted to check, y'know?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that is true ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;R,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Paul.
