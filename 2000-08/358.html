A while ago I set up a router under Linux (routes packets between a 128k
ISDN link and a 10Mbit LAN) and it works well.  Before I did set up the
machine I asked the same question of the list, and the general consensus
seemed to be that if you're a multi-homed ISP, or routing between 10/100Mbit
LAN segments a "real" router would be a better option.  If you've got an old
box lying around a Linux router might be a good cheap option for you.

Other advantages of using a Linux box is that it can do other stuff a
dedicated router can't...  Our "router" also runs low volume web services,
and some network monitoring tools for example.

Subject: Router Question


Hi everyone,

I've just got a quick qestion regarding routers. I wish to setup an ethernet
router which will be responsilble for a high level of traffic and bandwidth
but I am unsure of whether to use a Linux Computer as my router, or go out
and spend $4.5k on a Cisco 2600 Series router.

Can anyone let me know the advantages / disadvantages other than cost of
eqipment for either. I would much rather only spend about $1200 on a Linux
computer to use as a router as appose to $4.5k, but I am unsure of whether
Linux routing is as fast and reliable as a Cisco router.


Thanks,
Jeremy
