Hi Matt,

I realised my computer being very slow. After a pretty long time, I came
to the conclusion that the problem must be from having a small swap
space. 
Then I read the e-mails sent by Michael, then your own, and I thought it
would be a good idea to increase the swap space. I have a swap space of
128MB now, but lost the 64MB from /dev/hdb6, which I can see is there by
using fdisk. The problem is I have the feeling that is inaccesible.
I have to try Richards' advice. 
Do you guys think I can have two swap spaces, such as /dev/hdb6 and
/tmp/swapfile ?
Thank you Matt! And thank you to all who help!

Best wishes,

Nick.

PS. How is life in Melbourne Matt? :o) - cause mine I just stuffed up
seding an e-mail to a Labor politician and I was returned "No more mail
please", it must of upset him!

&gt; &gt; I have to mention here the fact that I have not tried
&gt; &gt; mkswap -v1 /dev/hdb6
&gt; &gt; yet, but will try.
&gt; &gt; Best wishes,
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure you know which device you *want* to make a swap partition.  If you don't
&gt; get it right you *may* destroy some data.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew
