&gt; There are generally one or two very urgent events to handle,

Is it possible that some events are going to be intermingled?
(eg, a packet is ready to be read, but some other condition
must be checked for as well?).

I did something in assembler once which was to rotate the
bit through a flag while incrementing a pointer into an
index table (of then, 16 entries).  Something like (vaguely
C-ish, as I don't have my C brain on at the moment):

int *(*p), (*dispatch)[32] = { various function addresses here };
int  i, event;

/* Note AlanK short circuit evaluation hack in for() test. */
for (p = dispatch, i = 32; i != 0 && event != 0; i--, p++) {
    if (event & 1)
        p(original_event);
    event &gt;&gt;= 1;
}

&gt; A good example of this would be a select() event handler,
&gt; monitoring 50 TCP connections in an un-forked process, where
&gt; all I/O events are a-priori equal.

Actually, that's an example of exactly the same problem
you have now - you are signaled that an event has occured,
but you don't know which event, so you have to cycle through
all the file descriptors until you find the event of interest.
Perhaps it's worth looking in squid and other single process
monters (INN?) to see what performance hacks they use (I know
squid uses poll() if it's available for that reason).

&gt; The resulting code would not be more incomprehensible than
&gt; a lexical analyser state machine....

And this is a bad thing?
