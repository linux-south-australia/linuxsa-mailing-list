Hi All

Nick: I am pretty sure you can get EDO ram currently. If not new then you
may want to try that place on Henley Bch road in Torrensville (Second Byte)
they may have something.

I would hazard a guess you current system sounds ok performance wise. P-Pro
200 should be ok yeah it aint p3-900 or something but hey ppl are running
Linux on socket5/socket7 motherboards with p-150 to p233-mmx etc.
and PPRO outdoes this easily performance wise. 

You haven't specified your current disk at all?

I have found bad/slow disks to be the root of most performance evils. Some
friends have asked me for some HD advice and I lean towards a drive with a
7200 rpm the speed is noticeable even if a tad more expensive than the 5400
rpm of same size. (eg 20 gb 5400 = 200 , 20 gb 7200 = 300 approx) You may
need to tradeoff size for speed. 

You can also upgrade ur video card to a 4mb there prol is 2 free plug in
slots to take u there I did this and video performance did improve (it
allowed higher res etc). Last I heard the ram to do so cost about 30 $'s
from Interactive OLE but I'm sure most PC shops stock it.

Depending on you motherboard layout ie number of ram slots etc you may find
getting to 64 from 48 may not be cheap 
eg if u have 4 slots 2x16 mb and 2x8 mb u have to lose the last 2x8 and
replace it with another 2x16

These points are just food for thought I understand the wife's budget
restrictions :)

Good luck 

evan

&gt;Hi gurus,
&gt;
&gt;I know "Thanks Godness is Friday". Still hoping to get a reply soon.
&gt;Guru advice: - "my computer needs a bit of physical upgrade", by Matt
&gt;and Michael.
&gt;At the moment: 
&gt;-48MB RAM
&gt;-2MB video
&gt;-200Pro
&gt;My question is: "Do the following sufice to keep going for a while?"
&gt;-64MB RAM  (does anyone know of any second EDO RAM?)
&gt;-8MB video AGP (any good? is it a friend of Linux?)
&gt;-Processor has to stay as it is at the moment and upgrade here could
&gt;cost        around $1200.00
&gt;I definately need a larger HDD. I considered 10MB and 15MB. I hear
&gt;people having problems with HDD's of 17MB. Which way to go 10 or 15MB?
&gt;Also Seagate or Western Digital? I have two Western Digital HDD's at the
&gt;moment, one has to go.
&gt;Before the upgrade I'll need to save some data and I'll have to buy LS
&gt;disks. My guess is that best price would be at Universities, that's not
&gt;a problems, I've got some ties there, best price being $15.00 each.
&gt;I'll appreaciate any reply.
&gt;Thank you and best wishes,
&gt;
&gt;Nick.
