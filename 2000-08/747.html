Thanks for all the teachings you wrote Michael! I am happy when people
are sending all kind of information.

You think Matt is causing problems? :o) Let's punish him by buying him a
bottle of champagne!
  
&gt; &gt;                  quicker than GNOME though. I have to admit my computer
&gt; &gt; is pretty old ( Pentium Pro-200, 2MB video, 2GB HDD Linux, plus half of
&gt; &gt; another HDD of about 750MB and 750MB for windows. RAM is 48MB, but still
&gt; &gt; slow for RH 6.2)
&gt; 
&gt; This system is very useable.  Until a fortnight ago I was using a Cyrix 686
&gt; 120MHz with 64Mb RAM and I insisted on running GNOME!  Swap space is important,
&gt; but adding more won't necessarily speed things up.  You may be able to run more
&gt; stuff simultaneously with more swap, but speed won't improve.

OK, let me put this a bit different. To me it appears to be slowing
down.
Technically I could be wrong, but that's the way it looks to a
non-professional :o(
 
&gt; Like I said, for a more enjoyable (speed wise) environment, go back to a
&gt; lightweight window manager instead of KDE and you should see a good improvement.
&gt; Don't run bloatware like netscrape, star orifice or wordimperfect unless you
&gt; need to and exit these apps before trying to do anything else with your box.
&gt; Don't even *think* of using vmware :-)

I won't, I once tried StarOffice :o(
Waste of time. My commputer worked faster before, it could be the
/home/users directories that are becoming stuffed up with things that
might cause it to appear slowing down?
 
&gt; The other thing, turn off services you don't need.  Try running "ntsysv" as root
&gt; and turning off various daemons that you're not using.  Pesky nfsd's, smbd's,
&gt; httpd's and the like can all go.  Read the manual first before turning
&gt; *everything* off :-)

I think I know what you are reffering to here, it must be the "text mode
tool" which allows you to select what to be started at boot time.

&gt; Sounds like a nice memory leak.  The less bloatware you run, the less leaks can
&gt; happen!  Time to start a crusade against bloatware, and crusty code that leaks.
&gt; Oh yeah, this is a Linux mailing list already.  sigh.
