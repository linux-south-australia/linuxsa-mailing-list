&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     A friend of mine asked me to help set up a Telstra
&gt; Dial-up Network "Just like yours..." and like a sucker I
&gt; agreed. At present there is a RH6.2 box connected to Telstra
&gt; as a Server/Router that talks to the world quite nicely
&gt; (pings, surfs etc.) and also talks to the rest of the
&gt; network (Windoze Boxen) through a hub (pings etc). The
&gt; problem is that the boxes on the network all talk to the
&gt; Server, but I cannot get through the server to the outside
&gt; world, I cannot even ping the Telstra router. The server is
&gt; configured so that default route is there, and also
&gt; configured as a gateway linked to the router. All of the
&gt; Windoze boxen are configured so that the Server is the
&gt; gateway to the world, and DNS is handled by the Server and
&gt; Telstra. Now I have looked at linuxconf and the config files
&gt; heaps of times, and as far as I can tell everything is set
&gt; correctly "just like mine" but it still doesn't work. Now I
&gt; know this is a simple problem, and I will probably kick
&gt; myself when I work it out, but can someone give me some
&gt; clues as to where to start looking to fix this. All of the
&gt; routing config files look O.K., and the route command gives
&gt; the server and the router and the appropriate interfaces.
&gt;     Thanks,
&gt;         Andrew.

Sounds like IP forwarding isn't enabled.

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

should return '1'. If it doesn't, then:

echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 

and see if that helps. If it does, then you want to modify the
/etc/sysconfig/network file so it includes:

FORWARD_IPV4=true
