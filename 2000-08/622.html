Hi everyone,
I haven't been here for a while because I haven't had any problems, and I
have been busy studying, alas, I seem to have stuffed up xdm (graphical
login) in RedHat 6.0.

I was miniding my own business, shutting down out of the Gnome window
manager when I get a message saying that unmounting the root partition
failed. On restart I got the 'force checked on /dev/hda5 .....' message.
Where I would usually see my login after the rest of bootup, instead I saw
just the grey screen with the X pointer (which I assume is Xwindows server).
I dropped out of X with ctrl-alt-&lt;- and panicking I ran x-configurator
again.

Now if I log in through command-line I can run startx, which gets me back to
to my regular graphical desktop etc, although everything is grainy (I can't
be sure if this is because I ran Xconfigurator again and no I didn't have a
backup of my original XF86Config file).
I have looked everywhere I can think.

If I run '/usr/bin/gdm -nodaemon'       from the command line I get the grey
screen again.

my '/etc/inittab' ends with
'x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon'

'/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers'    -- points to    ':0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X'
X however is a symbolic link which points to Xwrapper and I don't know what
that is (shouldn't it be pointing to a driver specific to my card SiS6326
??)

I hope the collective wisdom of LinuxSA can help me out,

tia, Nic Bishop    =)
