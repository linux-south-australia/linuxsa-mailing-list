Hi Jason  - you wrote:

&gt; But I don't really want people interpretations of man pages, I would
&gt; really like the comments of peopel who *know* ie have either contirbuted
&gt; (or at least read the source a lot and understand disks and fielsystems)
&gt; or have some good experiencve using the program and have foiund out one
&gt; way or another if  it works as advertised.
&gt;

Sorry, I'm not the person with the *knowledge*, just the *experiences*.

Having had an extremely dodgy hard disk in the recent past I had the opportunity
to use badblocks quite often. I had a windows partition with lots of bad blocks
reported by scandisk but when I used the same disk space for linux and used
badblocks (both in the setup process when the partition is formatted, and later
as bad blocks just kept on appearing), the results were always different.

Most important of all, *badblocks* supposedly can be used to mark these badblocks
so that they will not be used by the filesystem. This it never did!!!

I've always wondered how this program could be included in the distributions, and
for quite a long time, when it seemed to be less than useful.

Mind you, I seem to remember that the man page states that it has only been
tested on diskettes???

Hope this has been of interest to you (though probably not what you wanted to
hear)

See ya,
Michael
