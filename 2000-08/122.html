I did this when I replaced a redhat 5.0 box with a new 6.1 box (some
time ago now).  I wrote a perl script that grabbed the appropriate info
and then generated a bash script that called adduser, groupadd, and
groupmod.  I had to use the bash script because perl wouldn't execute
these commands  (security feature?).  It also set a default password as
I didnt realised the passwd file was backwards compatable (doh!) After
reading Daryl's way I think mine sucked :) But if it comes to it it can
be done and I can send source (although I have learnt much unix since I
tryed this and wouldn't do it like this now).

&gt; First question, why not just upgrade to Redhat 6.2 and keep the same accounts
&gt; intact.
&gt; Personally I use MD7.1 and thinks its cool but for server purposes there is
&gt; little difference between distros
&gt; 
&gt; Next thing, how many accounts? this is the crucial bit, this makes the
&gt; difference from trying really hard to save the accounts or just spending a
&gt; couple of hours typing.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway good luck and let the list know how you progress plz I'd keen find out
&gt; how you manage it in the end.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes

&gt; &gt; Hello, all:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm *very* gradually upgrading our company's internet gateway to a new
&gt; &gt; machine/version of linux. The old one has RedHat 5.2, and I'm moving on to
&gt; &gt; Madrake 7.1. One of the various little problems that has popped up is the
&gt; &gt; question of accounts. How can I migrate old accounts (just
&gt; &gt; usernames/passwords, really) from old to new?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As I am using shadow passwords and md5 encryption now (and the old one
&gt; &gt; didn't), I can't just copy files over and create home directories, can I? If
&gt; &gt; so, what do I need to copy? I did some tinkering and couldn't get much to
&gt; &gt; work..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wonder if the easiest method is to set up a script to read the contents of
&gt; &gt; my old passwd file, awk the username field, and add the user with some
&gt; &gt; generic passwd. Can anyone help me with such a script....?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Much appreciated!
