&gt; ... The latest problems come down to fans. A fan gave out
&gt; on a new canister (and another threatens to do so as well), which looks
&gt; like it cooked a drive.  (Those 10,000 RPM drives generate a lot of heat,
&gt; so a fan is needed for good air-flow to remove the heat.) Then I find that
&gt; two fans on the original canisters have gone or are going as well.
&gt; 
&gt; So, in two years, not one drive has had a problem, but several fans have
&gt; gone (two out of eight for the original set of 8 canisters, and 2 out of
&gt; seven for the latest set of canisters).

Fans, batteries and power supplies are parts with high failure rates.

The fans should have a "fan fail" signal.  If they don't then your
manufacturer has been too cheap by half.  There are a number of ways
to get this signal back to the computer: depending upon the device they
could be telco alarm wire, SNMP, or SCSI failure code.

I've found that the standalone drive arrays handle these conditions
better than RAID controller cards.  For example, a failing fan
in a DEC disk array will generate a SCSI failure code that is then
logged on the console.

I would be worthwhile looking at the controller cards you have bought
and seeing if there are any inputs that can be connected to the fans.
