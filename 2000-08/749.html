The short answer is /etc/services.

The long answer is try looking at the RFC list of allocated ports.
I can't actually find the official IETF list on their site, but
I did find this:

<A HREF="http://members.cotse.com/dlf/man/ports/">http://members.cotse.com/dlf/man/ports/</A>

Does anyone know which RFC (if any) has the latest list,
or just exactly the official list is available.

By the way, there's a little problem with this.

I used to have a SunOS 4.1.3 machine behind my RedHat firewall,
and perfectly ordinary non-reserved ports were being blocked.
This is because over time, more ports get allocated.
So you can find that an ordinary program (e.g. browser)
trying to access the net, may use one of these
allocated ports, and you might block your own outgoing
accesses.
I guess there's some solution involving blocking SYN packets or
something.
But I'd like to block the infamous TCP port 12345 which
gets probed on my machines about once an hour by hackers.
But what if one of my own programs wants to use it??

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
