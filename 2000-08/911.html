&gt; 
&gt; I run BIND on my system. This says that REBEL's name server
&gt; (203.30.69.2) is trying to speak to me (203.20.69.79) with protocol 17
&gt; [what is that]

UDP.

&gt; on the SOCKS port...why would a name server choose 1080
&gt; which IS the socks port to make a reply?

Because it's replying.  Is this a trick question?

What appears to be happening is that Rebel's name server is _replying_
to a name server request.  Which means that your name server issued
the name query on port 1060 (the reply goes back to the port is was issued
on).  SOCKS most likely doesn't even enter this equation; it's just an
arbitrary port.  So you are blocking the name server responses.  To allow
them, you should have a firewall rule that allows source port 53, and
possibly source address of the above DNS servers to really tighten the
configuration.
