Wow, this is going back a bit.

FWIW, I tried twice to deal with Clipsal regarding their C-Bus
product - in both cases, it was a requirement that I _needed_ to
deal with the low-level protocol myself, as none of the controllers
had the capabilities that I needed.  As soon as the person on the
other end heard that, they'd switch off completely (no pun intended).
I was firmly given the impression that you bought the entire thing as
a black box, or it was nothing.  I chose nothing.  In this era of
Open Source glasnost, you'd think something as piddly as a simple
current loop control protocol could be opened to NDA to an end
user.

&lt;Remaining usual marketing diatribe deleted - perhaps they need to
read the Cluetrain Manifesto?&gt;
