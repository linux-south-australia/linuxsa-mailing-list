Hi Again,
    I am using RH6.2, and I know that linuxconf is not
perfect, it is just quicker than using your favourite editor
on each file you have to remember the name of. I can and
have set a system up manually so that isn't the problem. I
did actually hand check the appropriate files and they seem
properly configured. I am considering retrograding to RH6.1
as that is what I use at present on my system, but it still
doesn't explain the weirdness. Does anyone know of any
instabilities with RH6.2? I checked their site and so far
have found nothing unusual.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Forwarding
&gt;&gt; was my first guess too, but I thought it was configured,
&gt;&gt; certainly linuxconf told me it was.
&gt;
&gt;Urk.  All bets are off with linuxconf; it does things in
&gt;peculiar ways (read: deviates from the norm) so it makes
&gt;it hard to tell how the config has been set up.
&gt;
&gt;Another data point - are you using 6.2?  I just found out
&gt;today (on my freshly minted Red Hat 6.2 CD set - thanks
&gt;Netcraft!) that it appears a lot of the /proc subsystem
&gt;has been subsumed by sysctl.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     O.K. so here is the wierd part. I did manually set
&gt;&gt; ip_forward to 1 and had another go and it still didn't
work
&gt;&gt; so I went to surf the online docs (since the server was
&gt;&gt; connected online) and I suddenly couldn't surf at all. I
&gt;&gt; tried a route command, and this hung. I tried a ifconfig
&gt;&gt; command and it said eth0 was suddenly missing.
&gt;
&gt;This is odd; why would losing your ethernet interface
&gt;affect traffic out your modem link?  Something bizarre
&gt;is going on here.  Turf linuxconf.
