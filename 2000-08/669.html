Hi,

&gt;Hi gurus,

On the assumption that you have damaged your swap area on /dev/hdb6, use
the following command to make it usable:

  mkswap /dev/hdb6

and then:

  swapon /dev/hdb6

After that, you should be able to do:

  swapon -a

to see your swap areas.

&gt;I followed the advice of Michael Neuling and Mat Tippett and entered the
&gt;commands  and also the info in fstab. I have a swap space of 128MB as
&gt;/tmp/swapfile. The original one /dev/hdb6 from fstab, is missing though.
&gt;In the process of increasing the swap space, I stuffed up and lost the
&gt;original swap space /dev/hdb6. Trying to claim it with: "swapon
&gt;/dev/hdb6" I get the error message /dev/hdb6 invalid argument. My
&gt;intention of swap space was 128MB, but now there is a 64MB of swap space
&gt;on /dev/hdb6 shown on fdisk -p, which I cannot use. Could you guys help
&gt;me to reclaim those 64MB?
&gt;Michael uses /tmp/swapfile as an example, Matt is going further to add
&gt;the following line to /etc/fstab:
&gt;/dev/sda       swap       swap     pri=0   0  0
&gt;/tmp/swap      swap       swap     pri=0   0  0
&gt;Now these don't match!  /tmp/swapfile and /tmp/swap are two different
&gt;things.
&gt;If you have /tmp/swapfile you need to have /tmp/swapfile in fstab!
&gt;This is not a complain, Matt helped me heaps since my first install with
&gt;RH 5.0 about one and a half year ago, perhaps a bit more. Also with al
&gt;was needed to connect to the Net. There was Geoffrey as well, someone I
&gt;read about in one the computer magazines, not long ago and I don't
&gt;recall anyone mention it!
&gt;Please, one little help is needed from you gurus, how can I reclaim 64MB
&gt;of swap space (/dev/hdb6) which is not used anymore?
&gt;I had great problems with the speed of my computer and I got to the
&gt;conclusion that it was caused from lack of swap space ( it caused the
&gt;processor run cold )
&gt;Another young man with great capabilities is Benjamin Close! Very busy,
&gt;yet modest and kind, he's there for you, when you least expect it!
&gt;OK gurus, enough for now from me! Let's see your professional advice
&gt;which of course will be greatly appreciate it!
&gt;
&gt;Best wishes,
&gt;
&gt;Nick.
&gt;
&gt;PS. I have no title, I am a mere human with a body and soul!
