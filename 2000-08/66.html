Actually!

&gt;     Don't they use servers that run on unix platforms?
&gt;     Oh well!!!

The only two ISP's that could help me with my Linux problems have been:

* SeNet
* Rebel

Whilst SeNet don't openly support Linux, I would get replies such as "I
don't understand but I'll forward this to X on our staff who can help
you...please wait for his (inevitably a he) reply and liase with him".
What I liked about SeNet was that the person who answered would answer
truthfully. I'd prefer the support staff actually say "I don't know, I
have no expertise there" so I can look for other avenues to get help.

Naturally, you would all know that Tellurian, of which David Newall is a
director, runs rebel. I've not had to ask them too many questions, but
when I have had to I've always got a satisfactory response.

This leads me to another set of questions...who of you out there have
asked Linux related questions to your ISP's support staff? What response
did you get? Was it satisfactory? Would YOU change ISP's if you knew
that someone at the ISP could help you with your ISP-Linux related
problems [I would...I know of ISP's who have flatly refused to support
Linux as a platform]....
