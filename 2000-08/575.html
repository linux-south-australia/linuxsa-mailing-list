&gt;&gt; We pulled the 1.6 gig HDD from the P166 and put it in the new system (700
Athln
&gt;&gt; Thunderbird), and have been trying to re-install Redhat 6.2 with no luck.
I
&gt;&gt; thought along the line that doing a reinstall would probably be needed with

&gt;&gt; all the new hardware and CPU type....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If that's the case it's not your BIOS as you have a small drive and it
&gt;does noy exceed the magic size (which you can get around). HOw are you
&gt;setting up your HDD partion wise??
&gt;
&gt;regards
&gt;
&gt;M

Well I've tried getting it to run tonight with all the suggestions that have
been offered (/boot partition). I installed it with the following table (from
memory):

hdd1 /boot (51meg)
hdd5 /usr  (800meg)
hdd6 /     (500meg)
hdd7 swap  (256meg) 

I used disk druid to get make the partitions, and it installed fine. However
I did notice an error message along the lines of (also from memory but 0x82
part I remember well)
 
BIOS error drive 0x82 may be inaccesable x3
not the first drive

I'm going to try debian 2.2 next week, hopefully that will fix the problem.
Would the person who offered to burn Mandrake 7.1 please email off the list,
so we can arrange something; one can never have too many copies of linux lying
around and I have a few spare blank CD-R's lying around anyway :)

Hopefully at the end of the day I'll actually be able to figure out why it isn't
working!! and hopefully Debian will work.
