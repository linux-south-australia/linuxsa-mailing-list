Hi Daryl,

Thanks for replying!

There you go, you have the experience! I am a mere user and all I do is
to tell what I observe :o)

&gt; Ahh, well this is possible.  Most screensavers (well, anything other
&gt; than the non-blank variety) chew up CPU cycles (some of them an
&gt; extraordinary amount - I remember logging into my home box from work,
&gt; wondering briefly why the load average was &gt; 2.0; back then I rarely
&gt; ran X, and hadn't disabled the screen saver).  If you're on a machine
&gt; that may be a "little lacking" in grunt, this could cause you severe
&gt; performance problems.

My comp is pretty old a Pentium Pro-200, I guess that could make a
difference.
If you take into consideration that it used to be heaps quicker before,
then yes, I would expect it to do a fair job, still. I should mention
the fact that I personally believe that Netscape is the culprit! Once
killed, the system starts breathing easier. Well, it seems that it needs
some time to recover, but works nevertheless better afterwards. About
the same thing happens after using "gimp", manipulating images, resizing
and so. This wasn't the case before, it just slowing down. From RH 5.0
to RH 6.2 there are a few versions, the newer the more memory is needed.
I don't remember at setup to be allowed to choose the size of Swap
space, it used to be 128MB. I should check to see what's its size now!
  
&gt; Glad to hear you're off the cough syrup.  :-)

Thanks for the thought :o)! Actually I am getting better, I guess it's
about time, I've been sick for two weeks.
 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;   Daryl Tester

Best wishes,

Nick.
