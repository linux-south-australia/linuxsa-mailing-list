&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows ME now has Blue screen ( with options !!!)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; LOL Funny though... ive had WinME Final installed for about 6weeks now
&gt; &gt; (as my prim desktop box) and have not seen one single BSOD yet.  And
&gt; &gt; this is with playing tempramental games/apps.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Actaully... im quite amazed that WinME for me is pretty much 100%
&gt; &gt; stable.
&gt; 
&gt; I too have not seen a BSOD out of WinME in the last 3 weeks or so that
&gt; I've  had  it installed. However, it has frozen a couple of times, and it
&gt; seems to dislike installing competing software (eg: WinAmp, WinZip, ICQ
&gt; all barfed when installing, Winzip and Winamp both work, but I've had no
&gt; luck with ICQ) Is it just coincidence that WinME comes with an Instant
&gt; Messenger, Zip support and Media Player that supports mp3's ?
&gt; 
&gt; *grin*
&gt; 
&gt; I think it'll be getting the flick off this system real soon...

I'm proud to say that I've no idea how stable WinME is, because I've never
tried it.  I probably never will.  I've also yet to try Microsoft Windows
2000 in any form other than pre-pre-pre-pre Beta.  And that was on a
friend's machine.

I think I still have Windows installed on this harddrive somewhere.

I think.
