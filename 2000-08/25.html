Hi,

&gt; I doubt it -- the LinuxCare CDs have visible saw marks where they have been
&gt; trimmed. I am pretty confident that they are actually made as full-size CDs,
&gt; and then cut down to size en masse... 

*Gets out handy CD, examins it, goes "oh yes"* Looks like they do, but
it'd have to be done to a fair degree of accuaracy, otherwise at 40-50
spin (or grearter), the forces would easily break a drive I would have
thought.


Hence, it would be highly unlikely to
&gt; find thick corners on them.

I think it was just a defect on the first one I ever got.

 Besides, I would have thought that as a Civil
&gt; Engineer, you would have done more Dynamics than me and would realise that
&gt; making the corners thicker won't help -- the only thing that matters is
&gt; where the centroid is... (unless you HAVE done more Dynamics than me and are
&gt; about to correct my simplistic understanding :)

My thoughts were that by placing some moe mass to the extremeties of the
CD it'd help for moe even spin, as the extra mass would counter somewhat
the irregularities in the rest of the CD. But I always thought that the
effect must be minor. I now find that the effect is zilch as they aren't
there.
