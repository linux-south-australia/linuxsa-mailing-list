&lt;Big snip  -- See original post&gt;

&gt; I take it that the only workstation trust account for \\ARROW is on
&gt; \\BOW.

Yes but \\BOW has several other servers all within its subnet

&gt;
&gt; It's looking like some kind of corrupt WINS database (which happens far
&gt; too regularly). Have a look to see if it all matches up. You could also
&gt; try adding static WINS entries into the database to see if that
&gt; overcomes your problem.
&gt;
&gt; How do the WINS entries for ARROW get to the other Domain controllers?
&gt; Are they running WINS?
&gt; Is there WINS replication?
&gt;
&gt;

Yes \\BOW replicates WINS to both trusted domains. This is the only way they
know of \\ARROW and can browse it.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now I suspect that it is a WINS/BROWSER issue because the
&gt; Samba(ARROW) box
&gt; &gt; is the only one in its subnet (No NT boxes)
&gt;
&gt; Yes. It is looking like WINS/Browse list stuff. Perhaps Richard Sharpe
&gt; can point out the problem?
&gt;
I've certainly been bending his book "Teach Yourself Samba in 24hrs" inside
out ;-)

&gt; You could also try setting local, preferred and domain master to yes and
&gt; setting the os level to 1. This way, it will become the master of all it
&gt; needs to and lose really badly in the elections against everything else.
&gt; You could combine this with the 'remote browse sync' option (I think
&gt; that's what it is - I haven't been playing with Stable Samba much
&gt; lately).
&gt;

I do not think I want to set \\ARROW to a domain master when \\BOW is
already the PDC
But I'll take guidance on that ;-).

&gt; hope it helps,
&gt; Matt
&gt;
All is a help at the moment.

Regards John.
