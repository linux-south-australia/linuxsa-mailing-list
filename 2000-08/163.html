&gt; (It showed the man page, but I only saw the error lines after I quit out
&gt; of man.)

Someone's idea of a man page doesn't grok with reality.  To whit:
someone has used some markup that the man processor (most likely
groff -man) doesn't understand, so you saw it complain.  It's not
a fatal error, and it was still able to render your man page.

&gt; A short while later I checked on the echo man page again.  *This* time
&gt; however, there were *no* error messages after quitting man, and haven't
&gt; been for the echo man page since then.  

man output is _cached_, so you won't see the compile error again until
the cache is flushed (which does happen, as I believe it's a regular
job scheduled with cron).

&gt; How confusing.

No, just a lack of understanding of how man (the program) works.

&gt; And another thing:  I recently had to check through the man pages for a
&gt; particular word ("shopt").
[snip]
&gt; # ls -l rec*
&gt; lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           37 Jun 30 09:53 rec.1 -&gt;
&gt; /var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1
&gt; # cat rec.1
&gt; cat: rec.1: No such file or directory   (What????  I hate that!  Can't
&gt; this thing read?)

No, it can't.  That's why it's issued this complaint.

&gt; # file rec.1
&gt; rec.1: broken symbolic link to /var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1
&gt; 
&gt; What????  I didn't break any symbolic link.

No, but it is telling you that /var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1
doesn't exist (pretty much in plain English), which strangely enough
is the same error that cat was reporting.  rec.1 is a _symbolic link_
(hence the type lrwxrwxrwx and the "-&gt;" in the ls listing above); it
points to another file.  However, in this case the file doesn't appear
to exist, so it's pointing to "air".  Hence, programs are rightly
complaining.

&gt; Did it break itself, or what?

Not usually, although people do sometimes delete files without
clearing up symbolic links after them.

&gt; Do links get corrupted?

Not usually, but it's not outside the realm of possibility (bear in
mind that it's much more likely to happen under a FAT-* filesystem,
and much less under a journalling file system like ReiserFS).

&gt; Does Red Hat install broken links or what?

Quite a possibilty; I remember rec.1 being broken in the past.
I think whoever owns that package is independent of whoever
owns the sox package, so you get this situation where one is
installed over the other.

&gt; Very frustrating, but it's pretty typical of what I've encountered with
&gt; Linux over the past two or three months

There's two ways to look at it - either all the errors get redirected
to the bit bucket, so you remain blissfully unaware that something,
no matter how minor, is amiss (ever tried executing a program off a
Win32 desktop, only to have it come up with no error at all in addition
to no program?  Or running a compiled VB program that tells you that
it's missing a DLL/OCX, but not which one?).  Or you can be informed of
these errors.

&gt; Every time I set out to do something I'm uncovering one problem, and in
&gt; trying to fix that I uncover another, then in trying to fix that I
&gt; uncover another, and another, and another.

These aren't showstoppers.  man continued to work, regardless.

&gt; Thankfully there's a user community here, or I would've probably
&gt; scrapped Linux a couple of months ago after giving up.

You will get this on any computer system of moderate complexity.
