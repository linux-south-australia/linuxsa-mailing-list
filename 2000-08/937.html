 &gt; Hi,
 &gt;
 &gt; Over the weekend, it seems that a number or linux systems I use decided
 &gt; to cleverly observe the special daylight savings rules for Melbourne and
 &gt; Sydney in 2000. Since I am in Adelaide, it's not actually very helpful.
 &gt;
 &gt; Did anyone else notice this, and can anyone suggest a method of fixing
 &gt; this or changing the timezone data so that it's not an hour out every
 &gt; time I reset the clock using an NTP server.
 &gt;
 &gt; Most of the Systems affected were running Redhat 6.1 or 6.2, as well as
 &gt; a very bare slackware system. Oddly, a bunch of Cobalt servers which
 &gt; have an OS derived from Redhat were not affected.

I have had a look on the systems that I look after and it looks like the
following systems are affected.

RedHat 5.2 - glibc-2.0.7-29 - Unaffected

RedHat 6.1 - glibc-2.1.2-11 - Affected

RedHat 6.2 - glibc-2.1.3-15 - Unaffected

Solaris 8                   - Affected

 From the information that comes with Solaris 8, the official source of the
timezone data is at <A HREF="ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2000f.tar.gz.">ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2000f.tar.gz.</A> This
copy of the source has been corrected, but while the changes were being
made to accomodate the Eastern States' changed daylight savings times,
someone must have also changed South Australia's incorrectly. RedHat 5.2
was probably too early to be affected by the change and so works fine
here, but would probably have problems in the Eastern States.

I downloaded the updated data and ran zic to create an updated zoneinfo
file for South Australia, which turned out to be exactly the same as the
RedHat 6.2 version. I have attached this file for anyone that wants it.
You will need to update /etc/localtime,
/usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/South and
usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Adelaide.

Cheers,

Martin.
