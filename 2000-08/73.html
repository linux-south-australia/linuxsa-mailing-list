David, 

I am with Oze, been with them since before they took over camtech. But the
few times I called oze I was advised sorry we dont do linux. However I have
a friend in the east (who worked for linux) now wit iPrimus who does know a
tad more than a newbie when it comes to Linux setup etc, and another friend
who is tech support in country vic ISP gave me the oil on setting up my
linux etc.

And recommended a few things to try. But I don't expect 'the larger ones'
to have a clue, given their typical canned replies, and interestingly the
greatest help in isp related issues, have typically come from
friends/contacts etc via icq or online gamers.

&gt;This leads me to another set of questions...who of you out there have
&gt;asked Linux related questions to your ISP's support staff? What response
&gt;did you get? Was it satisfactory? Would YOU change ISP's if you knew
&gt;that someone at the ISP could help you with your ISP-Linux related
&gt;problems [I would...I know of ISP's who have flatly refused to support
&gt;Linux as a platform]....
&gt;
&gt;DL

Always in search of better ping!
