Hi Dave,
Everyone has advise I'm afraid. I have personally found the Celeron option
as more attractive in life given how far I have been able to push them.
(yeah I'm an o/clock junkie) I'd do my modem if I could :)

Anyway to cut a long story short. 
Current celeries using 0.25 micron die work fin in a BX board and on good
ones will go up a fair way beyond spec with a reasonable chance of success.
(be warned not 100% guarantee)

Furthermore, the new cel-2's are coppermine based 0.18 microns and they
just love to go higher. They are rare and not cheap ie approx 250 ish
depending on speed. Reports I have read have taken these suckers in excess
of 1GHZ from their orignal specs.

I am hunting up a new release of the 533a coppermine ones which will go
upto 900+ mhz but intel are very tight with these for some reason.

So If you look to get the NEW cel-2 it will run on FCPPGA slot as does the
P3 so your motherboard is not wasted (at least for next 2-3 years),
providing you go for a GOOD motherboard, ABIT are always my preference they
allow u to do so much to your CPU. But if you chose not to o/clock they are
still good and I think would outperform the amds in most cases but give em
some juice and they fly. 

Sorry to those if I offended with my overclocking story. But the k6's are
overclocked anyway 

Regards




&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I am going to build a new machine to run linux (redhat 6.2 on) in the next
&gt;few weeks. It's just going to be used to run Gnome or KDE and things like
&gt;Samba - Mars NWE and generally working out how to use linux.
&gt;
&gt;My budget would allow me to build a AMD K6-2 500 or a Celeron 500 both
&gt;similarly specced. Would there be a great advantage gained by going for the
&gt;slightly more expensive Celeron or should I get the K6-2.
&gt;
&gt;TIA 
&gt;
&gt;Dave
