Ah yes, I found the item in question at
<A HREF="http://www.control.com/control_com/962135006/index_html">http://www.control.com/control_com/962135006/index_html</A>#965227486

That binary search idea reminds me of the 
OSS Pascal compiler for the Atari ST
in 1985, which had optimisation options for switch-statements,
where you could tell the compiler at which case-counts the compiler
would change between different algorithms.
I think that for very large case-sets, the code would involve a
binary search.

I had thought of binary search myself, but I thought this would be a
bit slow too. And untidy.

But now I think there is a good compromise:

I break up the 32 bits into 4 chunks of 8 bits.
For each 8-bit submask, I have a computed-goto - i.e. a
table of 256 pointers to event handlers.
This would not be quite as untidy as it sounds.

Hmmm.
I think the optimal algorithm might be:

A.	Split 32 bits into 4 8-bit chunks.
B.	For each chunk, use the
	x = status ^ (status & (status - 1))
	rule to extract 1-bit masks.
C.	Use a 256-pointer table for the 1-bit masks.

This requires 4 256-pointer tables. A mere 4 kBytes.

Step A is a sort of binary search.
I might right a little tool to automatically generate the
jump-tables.

In my case, it is worth the bother because I've got
a device driver which loses 98% of received packets.
Obviously I need to do some optimisation here.

I won't ask the obvious question as to how you just happen
to have a relevant link to this arcane topic handy.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
