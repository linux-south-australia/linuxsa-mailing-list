This is a bit of a long story but I have tried quite a few things and there
may be something among my experiences which may enable someone to put their
finger on my problem and help me get Linux installed.  I have successfully
installed Linux 3 times before on my older machines (Slackware and RH5.2)
but never on my current one which is PIII 450MHz 128M RAM.  Although I have
been working with computers for a long time I am really a newbie with Linux
and have not done much with my previous installations.  Anybody got any
suggestions about what I should try next?  I'm running out of ideas!

I wanted to install FreeBSD but my first hard drive was too full with Win98
and NT on it so I bought a second hard drive.  My two hard drives are
masters on each of the IDE channels with a CDR and CDROM as the slaves.

My troubles began when I added the second HDD and tried to install FreeBSD
3.2 on it.  Things seemed to go well with the install but after a reboot or
two my machine decided the second disc was only 500M and NT would not boot
as there were hardware configuration errors.  Even the BIOS thought it was
this size although it could autodetect the correct size.  I did not install
LiLo as I was intending to set things up so that I could boot Linux from the
NT boot manager as I had done with my previous RH5.2 install.  FreeBSD did
not have a HowTo about this but I thought I could follow the Red Hat one and
figure it out.
I disconnected the second HDD and got things going again.  I discovered that
the XFree with the version of FreeBSD I had did not support my video card
(Matrox G400) so I went looking for another distribution

I tried Red Hat Linux 6.1 with much the same results.  In both these cases I
used the Unix utilities to create the relevant partitions.  I then bought
PartitionMagic and used it to create the partitions for Red Hat (3Gb on disc
2 for /root, 16Mb on disc 2 for /boot and a swap partition on disc 1).  The
Red Hat installation (booting from CDROM) insisted on rebooting after going
through the partitioning step in the installation although I did not change
anything at that step.  I tried using Red Hat to make the partitions with
similar results.  I could not complete the installation.  This time my
second drive seemed to think it was 1Gb.

Next try was the RH6.2 distribution from the cover of APC.  The install
boots from CDROM and goes happily through to the Disk Druid step.  I have
set up the partitions with PartitionMagic so all I have to do is specify the
mount points and click Next.  There are a couple of flashes from the CDROM
light and nothing else happens.  The machine is not hung so I have looked
around the other virtual consoles and all looks fine.  There are no obvious
error messages.  I discovered that if I select the option to use fdisk it
stops when I press Next on the screen before Disk Druid would normally come
up.

I have booted my machine from that neat little Linuxcare disk and run fdisk
from there to capture the following details of how I have my discs
partitioned in case that sheds light on things.  (I copied this by hand!)
