&gt; Does anything other than Windows actually use the "Active" flag on a
&gt; partition?  I don't think I've ever set it when installing a linux server.
&gt; 

Yes. Anything that doesn't infect the MBR with itself. This *can*
include FreeBSD, Solaris, SCO Unix and things like Windows and BeOS. If
LILO is set to install itself to the active partition, you can boot any
operating system that LILO is configured for, provided they don't mind
not being installed on the active partition (goodbye Solaris and SCO).
If the Linux partition that contains LILO is made inactive for any
reason, no boot.

If LILO is installed in the MBR, it will happily boot any partition and
doesn't require any active partition. The OS LILO boots may require that
it is installed on an active partition. You can tell LILO to make the
partition active when it boots, so that if you swap between, say Solaris
and SCO, they can both have a turn at being active depending on which
one is selected. This works when LILO is in the MBR.

Contrary to popular belief, Windows does not need to live on an active
partition. LILO is more than capable of booting Windows (any of the
available bad-tasting flavours) as Windows only needs the active
partition thing when there is a "standard" (read DOS) MBR installed.

I think LILO's docs explain the whole thing in *real* english. I
remember they used to be quite good.....

Matt

P.S. Has anyone ever successfully booted SCO OpenServer with LILO? I've
tried everything I can think of.....
