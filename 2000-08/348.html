&gt; &gt; I have used ip masquerading (ipchains 2.2.x) and now NAT (iptables 2.4.0)
&gt; &gt; with my modem dialup ISP connection and games have always worked.
&gt; &gt; That includes UT, Quake, Quake2, Halflife, Starcraft, Rouge Spear. All
&gt; &gt; worked first time with no special masq/NAT or ip forwarding
&gt;
&gt;&lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ok, now for extra value marks, try to get two clients on the same NAT'ted
&gt;LAN talking to the same games server at the same time.

&gt;Beginning to see the point now?

Mark,
How then are cablers in east able to visit each other plug into hub and go
out via same pipe? Most are not running firewalls etc and are on win pc's
but I know of friends who have teamed up from 1 house with 1 cable
connection and they were all on the same server. They have used something
like sygate/wingate etc. 

The experience gained is specifically for quake tho so it may not be
correct for all games. 

Quake, upon initial connect to server negotiates with the client a port
number to use. normally next one on from a base + no of current players
the server from that point on uses the ip:port_negotiated to talk to the
client, so multiple clients can run on the same cable (with same ip) and
connect to the same server its just the negotiated port numbers which
differ. I know it works because I have been party to it.

So, I assume masquerading has a map at the firewall which says
10.1.1.1,6020 -&gt; 192.23.24,27001 and on the way back it knows where to
relay the packet.

I'd go so far as to suggest that the majority of mature online games work
this way too, which obviously encourages the purchase of their software.

My eastern friends would use gamespy from their respective pc's they would
all see the servers and then they would all connect not to the firewall but
to the game server.
