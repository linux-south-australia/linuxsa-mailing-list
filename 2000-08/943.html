Hi all,

I've been asked to pass this "work available" message on.  Lineo do
things with embedded Linux, and are looking for people to work for
them:

-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----
Lineo Integrated Products Group, based in Brisbane Australia, is
looking for exceptional people who can get things done in two areas:

1) Kernel developers. We are looking for Linux/Unix kernel gurus for
embedded Linux development. Using uClinux (www.uclinux.org) in
embedded internet security appliance platforms you will be involved in
embedded linux kernel, device drivers, cryptographic & security, and
TCP/IP based services development.

2) US sales engineers. Based primarily out of Eastern USA (California
and Utah), we are looking for people who can optionally perform the
above role as well working on site with our blue chip OEM partners,
performing code changes and updates, and operating as a general
purpose pre-sales and support engineer. The nature of this work is
very hands on with attendance at major US tradeshows, writing papers,
and public speaking also likely.

These roles offer an outstanding opportunity to be part of a
world-class leading-edge company.
-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----

The first position is based in Brisbane, but "if it's the right person
there is a remote chance (excuse the pun) of telecommuting. However,
the preference would be to relocate them to Brisbane as a) it's a
tightly collaborative team, and b) we're dealing with tangible
hardware which is less easy to play with remotely."

If you're interested in either of those positions, Rick Stevenson
(<A HREF="mailto:ricks@lineo.com">ricks@lineo.com</A>) would like to hear from you.

Regards,
