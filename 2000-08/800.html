&gt; &gt; I disconnected the second HDD and got things going again.  I
&gt; discovered that
&gt; &gt; the XFree with the version of FreeBSD I had did not support my
&gt; video card
&gt; &gt; (Matrox G400) so I went looking for another distribution
&gt;
&gt; Unsure as to what you meant by this - distributions are usually
&gt; comprised of "packages", of which XFree86 is a package - you
&gt; shouldn't have to change distributions toupgrade a package.
&gt;
I meant the XFree that came with the distribution.  I looked for a newer
XFree to install but thought it might be easier to just find a newere
distribution.  I discovered that if I got the next newer version of FreeBSD
it would have a suitable XFree.  The FreeBSD I had was an older one that
someone had given to me.
&gt; &gt; This time my second drive seemed to think it was 1Gb.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure that you actually mentioned what size your hard disk
&gt; is supposed to be.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Disk /dev/hda : 255 heads, 63 sectors, 1048 cylinders
&gt; &gt; Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes
&gt;
&gt; This looks suspiciously like LBA has been enabled in your
&gt; BIOS.  I'm not sure (I haven't run non-SCSI for a while),
&gt; but this may be causing your boot problems.  Others more
&gt; knowledgable may chip in here.
&gt;
I think it is something to do with that larger 17Gb second disc drive and I
notice that FDISK says something about LBA next to it but not against the
one above.  I'm not sure why the BIOS thinks the first drive has 255 heads
while the larger drive only has 32 and a very large number of cylinders.

Thanks for the reply.
