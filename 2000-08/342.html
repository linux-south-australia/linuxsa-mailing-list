I know you are looking for a solution to the problem "right now" and with the
resources you have, however, if you make your way over to freshmeat and look
under groupware you will find a project being developed by some of the K12
schools in the USA to handle such things as mail by students etc, logging etc.

Its a browser based groupware solution and GPL'd   (just as well, the
commercial version are $$$$)

I'm not in the office today so I cant get my hands on the specific link,
however, with some patience you will find it.

The little "angels" can even use it outside the FWall

If not let me know and I'll send details on Monday when I log on

Hope this is of some use

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to those who responded to last nights telnet dilemma. I admit I left
&gt; a fair bit out. The school runs W95 for the kids with a Novell 4.11 client.
&gt; The mail server uses sendmail under Linux. This morning we removed
&gt; telnet.exe from the system which will stop the little buggers maliciously
&gt; sending email through telnet from within the school. To stop them using
&gt; this feature on the other side of our firewall and spamming in, we thought
&gt; of hacking the sendmail.cf file on the line under timeouts.
&gt;
&gt; We found the three main commands to mail in telnet are mail, rcpt and data.
&gt;
&gt; In sendmail.cf, some of the defaults are
&gt; #0 Timeout.mail=10m
&gt; #0 Timeout.rcpt=1h
&gt;
&gt; and I am hoping that this refers to 10 minutes and 1 hour respectively,
&gt; when typing anything if using a telnet session
&gt;
&gt; If we change this to
&gt; 0 Timeout.mail=5s       #hopefully 5 seconds
&gt;
&gt; Now for my questions.
&gt; 1) If we make this change,  will this stop slow typists using telnet to
&gt; send mail through our mail server?
&gt;
&gt; 2) can we then do a
&gt; source /etc/sendmail.cf
&gt; on the mail server without having to restart the mail server, although a
&gt; restart probably is insignificant.
&gt;
&gt; 3) or have I completely lost the plot.
&gt;
&gt; I realise there is only so much you can do, but if we can make it that
&gt; little bit harder ....
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Mark
