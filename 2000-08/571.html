&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; 
&gt; Did you get answers to your questions?
&gt;

Hi Robyn.

Overall, yes.  *Lots* of answers have come via this mailing list about
all sorts of Linux questions I've had (e.g. bash scripting, RPMs,
postgreSQL, hard drive partitioning, and so forth).

In respect of the gnome-terminal software, no.  I'll have to report it
to the gnome developers I guess.  (I rebooted the machine and
gnome-terminal works fine now.)

Mind you, my machine runs slow (particularly Netscape and some gnome
apps) if left on for several days running.  I think it *might* be a
memory leak in some of the gui apps (the Xchess program is a good
example of that!), but it could also be because I've got an older
version of X (3.5.5) and I'm looking to upgrade soon.

If not for this mailing list (and the open source community at large),
chances are I'd have almost no answers at all.

:)

R,

Paul.

&gt; &gt; &gt; /dev/dsp is a soundcard thing. try disabling sound from either you
&gt; &gt; &gt; window manager (probably enlightenment) or gnome. or both :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; tje Gdk error is something that I saw quite a bit of, but didn't
&gt; &gt; &gt; generally cause a problem. Generally. You might consider checking your
&gt; &gt; &gt; version of gnome to ensure it isn;t too old.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But to have a problem just start is odd. there is always a reason.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's a reassuring thing to say, and thanks, but I submitted a post
&gt; &gt; recently (Manual problems (newbie question)) where a couple of
&gt; &gt; unexpected things were coming up in respect of man pages.  Also, to find
&gt; &gt; out I had a *way* outdated version of bash was also kind of unexpected
&gt; &gt; (yes, searching for "shopt" once again!) ... so on and so forth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm having a lot of sort of unexpected results with Linux recently (e.g.
&gt; &gt; Netscape Communicator just hangs or just vanishes, gnome-terminal
&gt; &gt; vanishes as soon as it comes up, missing links, etc.) that are sort of
&gt; &gt; disheartening to run into again and again.  Also, coming to Linux from
&gt; &gt; Windows there are lots of entirely new concepts (shell scripting, piping
&gt; &gt; and redirection, partition management, boot loaders, permissions, et
&gt; &gt; cetera, et cetera, et cetera) to come to terms with as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Additionally, coming from an applications background (although I've been
&gt; &gt; working with Web development for the last two years or so), it's a very
&gt; &gt; new kind of environment for me with its emphasis on systems
&gt; &gt; administration (rather than solely running a couple of productivity
&gt; &gt; apps).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Add to that the tools and utilities in Linux (such as vi and emacs and
&gt; &gt; man pages and sed) are also new ways of working, and each has its own
&gt; &gt; learning curve ... yeah, it's been pretty frustrating and overwhelming
&gt; &gt; of late.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; R,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Paul.
