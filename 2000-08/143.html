&gt;     During IPCP negotiation with my ISP, pppd is assigned a

That's right; you can't (or shouldn't) assign yourself an address,
because
a)  May cause IPCP to fail, and thus terminate your link (depends
    on what your ISP's PPP does in this situation)
b)  May cause two people to be assigned the same IP address,
    which causes routing havoc.

&gt;     What I need to do is be able to assign the value for
&gt; &lt;local-IP-address&gt; to a variable in either a shell script(if I have to)
&gt; or a c program, as the address is assigned by the peer. Make sense?

Kinda.  I guess you need the IP address you get assigned to your ppp
interface.  If you man pppd, you'll see references to ip-up and
ip-down scripts, which are called when (guess - go on, you'll never
guess) when your ppp ip interface come up and down.  Note that
RedHat subsume these for their traditional networking scripts,
so according to the scripts you need to use /etc/ppp/ip-up.local
instead.

Alternatively, you could use ifconfig ppp0 and a cunning script
to filtch the IP address as well.

&gt; I've combed the pppd and syslog man pages and the LDP
&gt; networking documents but to no avail.

Comb harder.
