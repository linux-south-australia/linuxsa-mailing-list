&gt; Well the only bit I left out of the original error message was that
&gt; glib-config was 1.2.8 but only glib-1.2.5 could be found.
&gt; I confimed it by looking at the version as you suggest .
&gt; Re-running  gtk+-1.2.8 /configure produces the same error as before .
&gt; Not certain how I might set the "environment variable" to point to the

&gt; thanks anyway

To set the einviroment variable just go 
export GLIB_CONFIG='&lt;path/to/glib-config'

In the shell you will be compilign from.

But I am not sure that will help you.

It sounds to nme like you need to add a line that points to your home
directory (which is a I think where you said you glib .so file was) or
where ever the newwert glin .so file lives into
you /etc/ld.so./conf file.

Then move the old glib .so, which is probably in /usr/lib or /lib to some
directory that is not mentioned in the /etc/ld.so.conf file.
( or you could just uninsatll it if it was isntalled from an rpm.
rpm -e &lt;package_name&gt;
rpm -qa|grep glib shoudl tell you the package name to use I think
But if you uinstall amke sure you have the original rpm if there is any
chance you will need to restore it
).

Then run
ldconfig -v

You should get a whole lot of stuff that looks like this:
/usr/lib:
        libzgcj.so.0 =&gt; libzgcj.so.0.0.0
        libgcjgc.so.0 =&gt; libgcjgc.so.0.0.0
        libgcj.so.0 =&gt; libgcj.so.0.0.0
        libgtkmm-1.0.so.6 =&gt; libgtkmm-1.0.so.6.0.0
        libgnomemm.so.6 =&gt; libgnomemm.so.6.0.0
        libgdkmm-1.0.so.0 =&gt; libgdkmm-1.0.so.0.1.0
        libquicktime.so.0 =&gt; libquicktime.so.0.6.0
        libz.so.1 =&gt; libz.so.1.1.3
        libsnmp.so.0 =&gt; libsnmp.so.0.3.6.1
        libtk8.0.so =&gt; libtk8.0.so
        libtixsam4.1.8.0.so =&gt; libtixsam4.1.8.0.so
        libtix4.1.8.0.so =&gt; libtix4.1.8.0.so

What this will do is tke your old versionof the glib .so fiel out of the
library path and add your new version.

In short the  /etc/ld.so.conf file tells the system where to look for
shared libraries and the ldconfig command forces the system to re-read
its config file then creates the necessary lnks and does some other
stuff I dont know about ot let the sytem knwo about any changes.

The -v just makes it verbose, which lets you see what libraries are being
used and whhere they live - it also lets you kow that somethgn is actually
happening.

I think all of the above should help, form what i have seen in your and 
 Ben's emails.

Hope this helps.

I am a bit curious though as to why you are installing the glib stuff in
your home dir instaead of in the ususal places (eg /lib /usr/lib).

It seems to me liek you problem is all to do with the fact that the .so is
nto isntalled int eh right place and ld.so.conf has not been configured to
know about where it is installed.
