I think each geograhpic area is bound to have a dominant distribution.
If you are relying upon community support, then it makes sense to run
the same distribution as your neighbour.

The reason for *which* distribution this turns out to be can be trivial.
For LinuxSA its probably the good support from Netcraft for R H.

For the uni, I choose R H because it was obviously going to have
third-party support: it was not clear at the time that Slackware
would continue to exist, that SuSE would compete in the English-using
world, or that Debian wouldn't somehow implode like the *BSD projects
did.

R H also had a aggressive hardware certification scheme.  You don't
wan to choose Linux X and find that you now can't buy the hardware
that put in the best bid.  Similarly, you don't want to go and change
Linux distro just because some Windows-blinded purchasing officer
has changed hardware supplier.  I think that this explains a lot
of the predominance of R H in corporates: minor differences in speed
and usabilty are nothing compared to compatibility, software availability
and support.
