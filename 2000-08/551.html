&gt; I recently conatacted Sola via their international web site and asked for

The manuals are also on the web site, <A HREF="http://www.solaaust.com.au/">http://www.solaaust.com.au/</A>

&gt; I did however ask about linux support, which they did not address in their
&gt; reply they just quietly did not mention it, so I assumed there was none,
&gt; but they did not want ot mention that.

It's a helpdesk clue issue -- the person probably didn't realise that
Linux is an implementation of Unix.

Some (all?) of their range are Best UPSs engineered for 240V.  The Best range
is widely supported by generic UPS software, so you can install the
RPM/deb off the Red Hat/Debian distro if you don't want to go to the
hassle of installing the manufacturer's software.

BTW, the Sola 305 is worth a look for the home PC before next summer.
Price is very good.  Now that ETSA has been sold, we can expect an
increase in the number of power outages.

Finally, most people misconfigure their UPSs.  The aim isn't to
keep the box running, but to give enough power to:
  - ride over hiccups
  - shut the box down cleanly.
Then when the power returns the box will come up immediately,
with no database rebuild, multi-hour fsck, etc.  The implication
being that installing cable and software are essential tasks when
installing the UPS.
