&gt;  &gt; So, do they just say this to try to make more money, or do they actually
&gt;  &gt; check somehow?

As far as I know, ip masquerading/NAT is 100% transparent, so they wouldnt know even if they did check.

&gt; They will check.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, you only get one IP address, which means the only realistic way
&gt; of connecting up multiple computers is via NAT, and if you're using NAT
&gt; games won't work anyway.  You lose either way.

Very not true...
I have used ip masquerading (ipchains 2.2.x) and now NAT (iptables 2.4.0) with my modem dialup ISP connection and games have always
worked.
That includes UT, Quake, Quake2, Halflife, Starcraft, Rouge Spear. All worked first time with no special masq/NAT or ip forwarding
rules.
Ooops... sorry... the one thing that doesnt work is hosting games (being the game server).

&gt;  &gt; I think waiting for another provider to provide DSL would
&gt;  &gt; kill me, knowing at least one provider (in this case Telstra) already gives
&gt;  &gt; access.
&gt;
&gt; Telstra aren't the exclusive provider;  They just waited until after
&gt; they'd released their retail prices before they provided their competitors
&gt; with wholesale pricing plans, and their competitors have then been forced
&gt; to spend even more time thinking about how it's possible to make money
&gt; reselling a Telstra service where the wholesale cost is /more expensive/
&gt; than the retail cost.  The ACCC will sort it out sooner or later, I'm
&gt; sure -- Telstra's competitors are certainly piling on the pressure, and
&gt; it's only a matter of time.
&gt;
&gt; [ example discussion point:  Given that you can rent a copper pair to
&gt;   your house for a retail price of $11.65 + GST per month (i.e.: your
&gt;   phone line), can anyone come up with a realistic reason to justify
&gt;   the fact that Telstra's wholesale price for ULL access to that exact,
&gt;   same copper pair for their competitors is in the region of between
&gt;   $40 per month and $90 per month?  And that's *without* the DSLAM and
&gt;   cable modem equipment, and *without* the 8 Mbps - 100 Mbps tail circuit
&gt;   an ISP will need from their premises to each Telephone exchange to
&gt;   provide ADSL services on a competitive basis... ]
&gt;
&gt; Optus is spending serious dollars on ridiculously expensive QCs to
&gt; build a federal court case against Telstra under the Trade Practices
&gt; Act on this exact point.  The ACCC may well be forced to issue a
&gt; Competition Notice (which says, "Stop your anti-competitive practices
&gt; or we'll levy a $10 million fine per day until you give-in") to address
&gt; the matter as well.
&gt;
&gt; Other things you may be interested in considering regarding ADSL include
&gt; the fact that even if you're interested in paying the Telstra price for
&gt; a buy-in to the Telstra monopoly, you probably won't be able to get
&gt; Telstra ADSL anyway.  The ADSL section on their web site lists the
&gt; telephone exchanges in South Australia which they're planning on equipping
&gt; with DSLAMs;  There are only about 10 of them.  And you'll only be able
&gt; to make use of them if you're within 3km of copper of the exchange, and
&gt; even then only if your link to the exchange is via copper, rather than
&gt; via a fibre RIM in a pillar at the end of your street.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Meanwhile, what happened to cable? Doesn't anyone provide cable in
&gt;  &gt; Adelaide?
&gt;
&gt; Cable is not a realistic alternative;  it was never wholly realistic
&gt; in the first place.  Its marketplace position will ultimately be doomed,
&gt; because (a) it's technically inferior, and (b) Telstra, the major
&gt; provider of cable internet access, is now interested in ADSL instead.
&gt;
&gt; Cable has never been provided West of Melbourne or North of Brisbane;
&gt; Neither of the cable network providers are the least bit interested
&gt; in doing any business in any place other than the mainland Eastern
&gt; Seaboard.
