Hi Andrew,

Thanks for replying!

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;-Processor has to stay as it is at the moment and upgrade
&gt; here could
&gt; &gt;cost        around $1200.00

Well, I was looking at some prices at <A HREF="http://www.adelong.com.au">http://www.adelong.com.au</A> They are
in Sydney BTW.

-AOpen M/B P-III           $165
-Processor P-III 700       $539
-128MB RAM                 $339
-HDD Seagate 13GB          $199
-Video Card                 ?    (whichever suitable for Linux)

&gt; Pardon me! $1200 for UPGRADE. What is the problem here, you
&gt; were going to just buy bits and upgrade when for $1200 you
&gt; can buy a base system new! My advice:
&gt; 
&gt;     1. Buy a NEW base system.
&gt;     2. Tell the dealer you Don't want a monitor and use the
&gt; one you have.
&gt;     3. Use the money saved on a monitor to upgrade other
&gt; stuff.
&gt;         eg. Monitor costs about $300 nowadays so $40 to
&gt; upgrade from 6Gb HDD to
&gt;         20 Gb HDD, use rest on video card (NVidia about $100
&gt; now) and RAM
&gt;         upgrade ($150 for 64Mb -haven't checked lately on
&gt; RAM prices)
&gt;     4. Take LS drive out of old box and put into new one.
&gt;     5. Lash out and buy 2 x100 BaseT network cards ($35-50
&gt; each) and network
&gt;     your old machine to new one and back up later. Telnet
&gt; into it as required.
&gt;     6. Enjoy your new machine.
&gt;     7. At some later time, buy $300 Monitor and play quake
&gt; over your new network
&gt;     with your friend.
&gt; 
&gt;     Hope this helps, it is also a far better solution as
&gt; your new machine probably has a 3 year warrantee with it.

&gt;      Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

I must agree that the best would be a new system, but I'm not ready for
it.
All I want to do is spend a few hundred dollars, so that my system will
last me for another one and a half or two years.
I had a 486, it's been upgraded and it cost me heaps of money.
Then I considered the best thing to do instead of another upgrade would
be to buy a new one, which I bought. This is the one I am using now. It
cost me $3690.00 about four and a half year ago I think.
Next my older one which goes to Uni and does Multimedia, had problems
with the P-Pro so si decided to get her own, which she did of course.
What now? Another new computer? Forth computer? I'll have to open a
computer shop soon, or have a garage sale. :o)

Thank you and best wishes,

Nick.
