&gt; I do not have first-hand knowledge of whether a password expiration on
&gt; NT will initiate a dialogue to change the password when a Win9x client
&gt; logs in, but have been told that NT will.  If this assumption is
&gt; incorrect, that would certainly explain why the Linux/Samba combo is
&gt; also unable to force a password change!  I would again be surprised,
&gt; though - why would Microsoft put a password expiration variable in NT
&gt; user accounts and not bother to support it for Win9x clients?  This
&gt; would be inconsistent with their Zero Administration Initiative.  (On
&gt; second thought, maybe that wouldn't surprise me...)

I'm not sure about the Stable versions of Samba, but the prealpha stuff
*seems* to have support for it. Just a guess: If Stable Samba was to
support it, my guess is that it would do it using the information in the
/etc/shadow file.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I appreciate any insight anyone has to offer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Have you tried Samba-technical?
&gt; 
&gt; Not yet, but that will probably be my next stop.

I posted to Samba-NTDOM about 6 months ago and never got a reply :-(

&gt; 
&gt; Since I originally asked my question, I have gone back to thoroughly
&gt; test password synchronization on our server, and noticed a problem.
&gt; Changing the Windows password from the Win9x client changes the
&gt; smbpasswd file properly; however, the Unix password is not updated, even
&gt; though I have unix password sync = yes.  Do you see anything in our
&gt; smb.conf file that explains this?  Is this why the expiration of a Unix
&gt; password on our server doesn't prompt a Win9x client to change their
&gt; password?

Apparently there shouldn't be a problem changing passwords (even when
encrypted passwords are being used), as windows sends passwords in
cleartext when being changed. Try the password debug option (or whatever
it's called). It should show you everything that happens.

Sorry I have no certain answer,

Matt
