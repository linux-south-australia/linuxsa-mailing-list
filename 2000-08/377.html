Hi,

&gt; There I was, looking at the latest problem with the RAID hardware in these
&gt; machines.  The whole lot had been taken out by an under spec'd fan, which
&gt; probably cost $0.50 in quantity.  But let me step back.

I think fans in general are one of the most under-speced components placed
into computers. It was Ok with a Pentium 133, it'd survive without the fan
if it gave out, but today's computers producing the heat they do, its
amazing more computers don't fry themselves. I've lost count of the number
of CPU and powersupply fans I've replaced, (and apart from one that was
choked to death by ash from a very heavy smoker) they all could have
benefitted from having a $10 bearing fan rather then a $2 non-bearing fan
placed on them. Particularly on computers that are likely to be left on
24/7 unlike many home PCs.

cya
