David -- again, you stun the world with your unique logic. You continue to
brighten my days with your bizzare responses, and I continue to wonder what
it is that they put in the water in whichever dimension it is that you
presently exist.

&gt; I won't debate your argument at all. I can only assume your statement
&gt; refers to other things unsaid. If my bandwidth on LinuxSA 
&gt; were taken as
&gt; 1.0 (the norm) would yours be taken as infitesmally small 

If your bandwidth were taken as the norm, Cisco's share price would
quadruple.

&gt; which is ZERO
&gt; (not at all) according to the calculas&gt;?

Michael's contributions to the list are invariably concise and to the point.
They contain nothing but useful information, with all extraneous text
(quoted replies, etc) removed. They are rare, but always useful. His
contributions and yours are at almost opposite ends of the spectrum of
worthfulness, and I won't be giving any hints as to which is at which end.

:)
