Hi All,



&gt;-Processor has to stay as it is at the moment and upgrade
here could
&gt;cost        around $1200.00


Pardon me! $1200 for UPGRADE. What is the problem here, you
were going to just buy bits and upgrade when for $1200 you
can buy a base system new! My advice:

    1. Buy a NEW base system.
    2. Tell the dealer you Don't want a monitor and use the
one you have.
    3. Use the money saved on a monitor to upgrade other
stuff.
        eg. Monitor costs about $300 nowadays so $40 to
upgrade from 6Gb HDD to
        20 Gb HDD, use rest on video card (NVidia about $100
now) and RAM
        upgrade ($150 for 64Mb -haven't checked lately on
RAM prices)
    4. Take LS drive out of old box and put into new one.
    5. Lash out and buy 2 x100 BaseT network cards ($35-50
each) and network
    your old machine to new one and back up later. Telnet
into it as required.
    6. Enjoy your new machine.
    7. At some later time, buy $300 Monitor and play quake
over your new network
    with your friend.

    Hope this helps, it is also a far better solution as
your new machine probably has a 3 year warrantee with it.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;I definately need a larger HDD. I considered 10MB and 15MB.
I hear
&gt;people having problems with HDD's of 17MB. Which way to go
10 or 15MB?
&gt;Also Seagate or Western Digital? I have two Western Digital
HDD's at the
&gt;moment, one has to go.
&gt;Before the upgrade I'll need to save some data and I'll
have to buy LS
&gt;disks. My guess is that best price would be at
Universities, that's not
&gt;a problems, I've got some ties there, best price being
$15.00 each.
&gt;I'll appreaciate any reply.
&gt;Thank you and best wishes,
&gt;
&gt;Nick.
