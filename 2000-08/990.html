Greetings, 

Well I've been installing/playing around with Debian 2.2 for the past 
few days, and now that I've got it connected to the net (more than a few 
hours work there), I've got a few questions to ask:

I've noticed that gnome based applications have a larger font in the 
menus, and that the icons look larger. It might be my imagination, I'm 
not sure but my email client (CSCMail) doesn't fit on the screen like it 
did in Redhat & other applications like gnotepad I've noticed it as 
well. Any idea what would be causing this?? and how to shrink things 
down a bit??

I need to recomiple my kernel, I only just compiled my first kernel last 
week & was curious as to if there was anything I should be aware of 
specifically in regards to Debian; can I do just a regular recompile?? 
no hidden files I need to change?

Thankyou in advance for any responses,

Regards,

John Kennison
Student (Having fun getting his hands dirty with Debian)!
