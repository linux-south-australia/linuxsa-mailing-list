&gt; How do I give one particular group in LINUX permission of viewing files on another group?  Each group has a substantial amount of users, and one group needs to be able to view the contents of ALL the home directories of the other group [as well as their own personal directory].

Unfortunately, in unixes, each file can have only one group as owner,
although some 10 or more years ago, users were given the ability
to belong to a large number of groups.

Therefore the only practical solution might be to write
an executable which has the guid bit set to be able
to read the other directories, and which does only
what you want the program to do, namely to read the directories.

I'm not up-to-date on what can be done in guid scripts in linux.
In the olden days (solaris etc.), I think that scripts were
forbidden to have suid or guid permissions - i.e. the OS just
ignored them. But in linux, I think you could write a script
to do the job.

The experts will tell you, I'm sure.

Cheers,

PS.  Does anyone out there have a lot of experience in writing
ioctl handlers in device drivers.
I've wasted the whole night trying to debug a very mysterious
situation where I keep getting the error
ioctl: No such device
every time I try to invoke the ioctl of my device driver with
the correct argument, but I get 
ioctl: Bad address 
if I use the wrong argument.
But in the first case, the ioctl handler never gets called.
Life is tough!!
