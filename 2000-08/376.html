Hi,

Fans are damn annoying things.  Them and RAID controllers.

There I was, looking at the latest problem with the RAID hardware in these
machines.  The whole lot had been taken out by an under spec'd fan, which
probably cost $0.50 in quantity.  But let me step back.

For the last two years I have administered a pair of machines that were
designed for high reliability.  They had DAC960PG raid controllers in them
along with four Seagate Cheetah (10,000 RPM) drives in them, each drive in
an IcyDock (or similar) hot-swap canister.  The raid set was set up as 3
drives in RAID-5 with a hot standby.

Best setup you could have, we thought.

Reality is, I have spent more time on those RAID controllers and the
IcyDock hot-swap canisters, and had more problems with them, than I have
had with the drives.  The latest problems come down to fans. A fan gave out
on a new canister (and another threatens to do so as well), which looks
like it cooked a drive.  (Those 10,000 RPM drives generate a lot of heat,
so a fan is needed for good air-flow to remove the heat.) Then I find that
two fans on the original canisters have gone or are going as well.

So, in two years, not one drive has had a problem, but several fans have
gone (two out of eight for the original set of 8 canisters, and 2 out of
seven for the latest set of canisters).

Obviously, one needs to be careful with the hardware that is purchased if
it is expected to go the distance.

Just thought that some of you might be interested in this info.
