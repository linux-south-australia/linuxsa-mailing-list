&gt; The change over has taken place at Dove and we now have 'server assigned DNS

&gt; if I try to check my email it spits back a message straight away saying
&gt; 'Dove' 'server not found'. With the old 'nameserver' address in place it

This kind of depends on how your network is set up, so I'm going to make
some severe guesswork on my part (more so that usual).  Your firewall/
router should have a DNS server that is acting as a cache, so kmail's
nameserver entry should be pointing to your firewall.  But if you are
doing dial on demand, AND masquarading, then I can't see why any DNS
probes aren't causing your network to dial out (except, of course, that
you've just moved to server assigned IP addresses, so your DNS server
may not know where to forward queries on to - this may be your current
problem).

I think you're best bet is to just ask Dove what their DNS servers
IP addresses are, and hardwire that; the only reason that they
themselves are moving to this scheme is that they now probably have
dialup equipment that supports this, whereas before it had to be
manually set up in the DUN component of Windows/Whatever.
