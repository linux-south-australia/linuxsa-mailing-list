Yes, that's an attractive option.
There are generally one or two very urgent events to handle,
and the rest are more relaxed.

So I could do something like:

if (status & mask1) {
    // Deal with urgent condition 1.
    status &= ~mask1;
    if (!status)
	return;
    }
if (status & mask2) {
    // Deal with less urgent condition 2.
    status &= ~mask2;
    if (!status)
	return;
    }
if (status & mask3) {
    // Deal with even less urgent condition 3.
    status &= ~mask3;
    if (!status)
	return;
    }
etc. etc.

Then the nth condition handling code is preceded by n
AND/test/jump commands.
This would just require some analysis of the events which
are most urgent.

As you are suggesting, if the urgency and/or frequency of
events is unknown a priori or if the urgency/frequency are
evenly distributed, then the jump table would be faster.
A good example of this would be a select() event handler,
monitoring 50 TCP connections in an un-forked process, where
all I/O events are a-priori equal.

I think that as an exercise, I'll try the jump-table approach
in my device driver.
The resulting code would not be more incomprehensible than
a lexical analyser state machine....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Unrelated topic....
I bought Star Office 5.2 over the net from www.sun.com
last Sunday morning, and it arrived 5 days later, namely
last Friday. Together with postage, it comes to about A$100
or more. Not cheap!
But it does have a couple of manuals: 
16-page Binary Code License
72-page installation guide
490-page user manual
1 CD-ROM
And I did want to express my solidarity with their plan
to open-source the code.

I haven't had the time to install it yet.
But the manual looks about as useful as the typical
manuals from a certain evil empire.
Ah, the CD contains versions for 
Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, Solaris 7 and 8 for Sparc and Intel,
linux, and windows 95/98/2000/NT.
