&gt; /dev/dsp is a soundcard thing. try disabling sound from either you
&gt; window manager (probably enlightenment) or gnome. or both :)
&gt; 
&gt; tje Gdk error is something that I saw quite a bit of, but didn't
&gt; generally cause a problem. Generally. You might consider checking your
&gt; version of gnome to ensure it isn;t too old.
&gt; 
&gt; But to have a problem just start is odd. there is always a reason.

That's a reassuring thing to say, and thanks, but I submitted a post
recently (Manual problems (newbie question)) where a couple of
unexpected things were coming up in respect of man pages.  Also, to find
out I had a *way* outdated version of bash was also kind of unexpected
(yes, searching for "shopt" once again!) ... so on and so forth.

I'm having a lot of sort of unexpected results with Linux recently (e.g.
Netscape Communicator just hangs or just vanishes, gnome-terminal
vanishes as soon as it comes up, missing links, etc.) that are sort of
disheartening to run into again and again.  Also, coming to Linux from
Windows there are lots of entirely new concepts (shell scripting, piping
and redirection, partition management, boot loaders, permissions, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera) to come to terms with as well.

Additionally, coming from an applications background (although I've been
working with Web development for the last two years or so), it's a very
new kind of environment for me with its emphasis on systems
administration (rather than solely running a couple of productivity
apps).

Add to that the tools and utilities in Linux (such as vi and emacs and
man pages and sed) are also new ways of working, and each has its own
learning curve ... yeah, it's been pretty frustrating and overwhelming
of late.

R,

Paul.
