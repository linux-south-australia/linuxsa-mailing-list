OK, but what I was after was your network topology.  Is the modem
that you're using on the same box that you're attempting to read
mail/surf from, because you did mention you had a router.

&gt; No ip address (server assigned)
&gt; No dns address (server assigned)
&gt; Dialing is setup with kppp (don't know any other way) with no dns address

I don't know kppp; I've only used either my own pppd scripts, or the
ones shipped with RedHat.  Does it handle server assigned DNS addresses?

&gt; Using pap to authorize the login
&gt; All works fine
&gt; 2 dns addresses (are they the same as nameserver addresses) are written to
&gt; netcfg (not by me but by the sever assigned bit).

What do you mean written to netcfg?  They should be written to the file
/etc/resolv.conf; if they aren't, then no local service is going to have
a hope of resolving anything.

&gt; Kmail setup to look for mail on mail.mtx.net.au it says server not found.
&gt; Netscape says similar to Kmail

Try nslookup; just running it should give you something like (of course,
your name server will differ):

[<A HREF="mailto:dt@nipnyep">dt@nipnyep</A> tmp]$ nslookup 
Default Server:  ns0.picknowl.com.au
Address:  203.24.77.6

&gt; 

At the "&gt; " prompt, you can type in a domain name to lookup; try
looking up mail.mtx.net.au - it should return you 203.15.24.1.
If not, it's still definitely a name lookup issue.

&gt; I hope I've removed every vestige of the firewall / router etc that I was
&gt; connected to.

As I said, I'm unsure of your topology, so I don't know how this
will help/hinder.


Regards,
  Daryl Tester
