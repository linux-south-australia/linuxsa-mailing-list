&gt; It's a little tricky to start with, but once you understand,
&gt; shell-scripting is quite powerful.

In my previous life I was a lead test engineer for cryptographic
and life-critical computer systems [1].

My favorite test with shell scripts was to wait until it
asked for a name and enter

  O'Malley

Most systems would then complain about non-matching quotes
and nose-dive.

Similarly, try

  "  this is a test  "

for shell scripts that accept file names.

My advice for shell scripts is don't use them for anything
beyond the trivial, as correctly quoting and escaping variable
references can become painful quickly.

 [1] Which brings up a nice tale I heard the other day.

     AWA made a radar that fitted onto artillery to measure
     the muzzle velocity of shells.  A variant of this was
     marketed to the police services as a vehicle speed
     radar.

     AWA also did the F111 avionics upgrade programme.
     It used the MVR as part of its test sample set of
     threat radars.

     A low-flying F111 following a Queensland highway pops
     over the horizon.  The AAA (anti-aircraft artillery)
     alarm sounds in the cockpit, the AAA radar is locked
     onto, a missile is automatically armed and the pilot
     is offered a brief opportunity to cancel the automated
     missile launch sequence.

     The sequence was cancelled.   One wonders if the
     police officer sitting next to his traffic radar
     knew how lucky he had been :-)
