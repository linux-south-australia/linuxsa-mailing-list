Robyn,

I have not been following this thread closely so this may not be what you
need. I've been doing some stuff with pppd as was perusing the man page and
read this.

pppd supports the usepeerdns option. The server assigned DNS addresses are
passed to your /etc/ppp/ip-up script as environment variables DNS1 & DNS2

With this you should be able to use server assigned dns and configure your
firewall from the ip-up.local script

For various reasons ip-up.local is the script that starts my firewall.

&gt; Hi Daryl
&gt;
&gt; I am relegated to using win98 it's the only thing that works!
&gt;
&gt; This is the current setup.
&gt;
&gt; No ip address (server assigned)
&gt; No dns address (server assigned)
&gt; Dialing is setup with kppp (don't know any other way) with no dns address
&gt; Using pap to authorize the login
&gt; All works fine
&gt; 2 dns addresses (are they the same as nameserver addresses) are written to
&gt; netcfg (not by me but by the sever assigned bit).
&gt; Kmail setup to look for mail on mail.mtx.net.au it says server not found.
&gt; Netscape says similar to Kmail
&gt;
&gt; I hope I've removed every vestige of the firewall / router etc that I was
&gt; connected to.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; The change over has taken place at Dove and we now have
&gt; 'server assigned
&gt; DNS
&gt; &gt; &gt; addresses'. My problem is that kmail needs a 'nameserver' in 'netcfg'
&gt; for it
&gt; &gt; &gt; to 'contact' the firewall / router and initiate modem dialling etc.
&gt; Otherwise
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I try to check my email it spits back a message straight
&gt; away saying
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'Dove' 'server not found'. With the old 'nameserver' address
&gt; in place it
&gt; &gt; &gt; dials out beautifully. I believe the old DNS will work for a while.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This kind of depends on how your network is set up, so I'm going to make
&gt; &gt; some severe guesswork on my part (more so that usual).  Your firewall/
&gt; &gt; router should have a DNS server that is acting as a cache, so kmail's
&gt; &gt; nameserver entry should be pointing to your firewall.  But if you are
&gt; &gt; doing dial on demand, AND masquarading, then I can't see why any DNS
&gt; &gt; probes aren't causing your network to dial out (except, of course, that
&gt; &gt; you've just moved to server assigned IP addresses, so your DNS server
&gt; &gt; may not know where to forward queries on to - this may be your current
&gt; &gt; problem).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think you're best bet is to just ask Dove what their DNS servers
&gt; &gt; IP addresses are, and hardwire that; the only reason that they
&gt; &gt; themselves are moving to this scheme is that they now probably have
&gt; &gt; dialup equipment that supports this, whereas before it had to be
&gt; &gt; manually set up in the DUN component of Windows/Whatever.
