Okay then Jason!

I will ask permission to forward on their email to this discussion group.  One way to a Linux users heart and customer loyalty is to happily support Linux.

I think it will be a huge market, I am tempted to start up my own competively priced business.  What drugs are all the non-Linux aware marketing managers on?  I don't think it is cold & flu tablets.

This will be the first company to go up on my Linux friendly company web site.

&gt;Ian,
&gt;
&gt;That is interesting.
&gt;
&gt;I recently conatacted Sola via their international web site and asked for
&gt;info on a UPS for which we dont currently have manuals, and they faxed it
&gt;to us quite quicky (within a day), presumably from overseas somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;I did however ask about linux support, which they did not address in their
&gt;reply they just quietly did not mention it, so I assumed there was none,
&gt;but they did not want ot mention that.
&gt;
&gt;So I am really glad you have now supplied me with the missing part of the
&gt;puzzle!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks

&gt;&gt; I must say though that I made an inquiry to Sola Australia only yesterday about Linux support for their UPS's.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Today I received the best response from any company yet.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; They went into a lot of detail about Unix support and even pointed me to the source code should I need to recompile for my particular operating system.  They also advised that should I still need help, I can forward a query to them and their programmers will look at it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That's the sort of attitude I like to see, so check 'em, out!  www.solaaust.com.au
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am going to establish a city wide / national web page of Linux friendly suppliers / vendors.  I'm sick and tired of the screwed up anti-competitive practices of companies.
