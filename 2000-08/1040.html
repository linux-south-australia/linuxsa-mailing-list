Hrmmm..... I think i'll just try hitting it with a bigger hammer (thats what
they say to do when all else fails isn't it?)

Everything seems fine, it just wont work for me..... I might just assume
it's a qwerky bug in the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have added "xyz stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd

&gt; &gt; &gt; /etc/services.  I've then done a `kill -HUP &lt;PID of inetd&gt;`
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I telnet to the port, but I don't get any data being spat out at me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What do you get when you telnet to the port?  It opens and closes
&gt; &gt; quickly?
&gt;
&gt; Hrmm.. I should have said this, oh well - It just stays connected with no
&gt; data flow.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone got any suggestions
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes.  Check the error log for inetd.conf (probably /var/log/messages).
&gt; &gt; When using tcpd wrappers, I don't think you can specify path info for
&gt; &gt; commands, and it will only look in certain places (eg, /usr/sbin) for
&gt; &gt; your program to execute (at least, this used to be the case with tcpd).
&gt;
&gt; Nothing seems to come up in the logs.  I'm assuming the syslog level would
&gt; be covered by *.info
&gt;
&gt; The following two entries were included in the file as default, but have
&gt; always been #ed out so I would assume this means that tcpd defaults to
only
&gt; looking in certain paths, but may also go for full path/program names.
&gt;
&gt; #systat stream  tcp     nowait  guest   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /bin/ps -auwwx
&gt; #netstat        stream  tcp     nowait  guest   /usr/sbin/tcpd
&gt; in/netstat    -f inet
&gt;


Hmm, I did exactly what you just said, except instead of abc.pl I had
foo.sh, with this in it:

#!/bin/bash

date
uptime
echo hello world

perhaps it is your script? maybe try running it like this:

cat | abc.pl

and see if it works. perhaps your script is waiting for input?
