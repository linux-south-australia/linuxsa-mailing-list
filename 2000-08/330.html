This would be pretty easy to do on Windows NT using mirroring, whether between servers or locally on a single server.  I'm a Linux newbie,
so I haven't yet discovered the specific methods of setting up a mirrored disk or partition on Linux, but I am certain that there are
various methods by which this could be done on Linux.

Mirroring of a disk or partition would result in a live "backup" of your open files.  Specifically, as the files on the disk/partition are
modified, an exact duplicate copy of that entire disk/partition is also modified in the same manner at the same time.  Depending on the
method you use to mirror the data, there is little or no system performance loss with each write.  With that large of a file, I would
think there would be some system performance benefits to put it on it's own partition anyway, if your application allows for it.

Hope this steers you in the right direction.

&gt; I have a question. It may be old or new idea.
&gt; Let me tell you using as example.
&gt;
&gt; I have 2 GB file on unix/linux. I want to take back up (or replicate) of this file as soon as there is any change in this file.
&gt; If we use incremental back up, it will take bake up of all 2 GB file size for a single word change.
&gt;
&gt; Q1 - Is there any solution in your mind, which will collecte only change byte (or blocks of say 1KB) and duplicate on back up server ?
&gt;
&gt; Q2 :- What are the products (commercial and non-commercial like unix utilities) support back up of Open files (application) ???
&gt;
&gt; I hope, i didn't ask a tough question.
&gt;
