John,

I just went through exactly the same problem with a network here just last
week.  I had two totally seperate NT domains on two totally seperate
networks (in two totally seperate buildings!) and had to link them with a
radio network thingo and a router.

Samba saved me ;)

The problems were numerous.  They ranged from totally stuffed routing
tables on the other NT PDC machine, to having some machines not configured
to use WINS.

My fix was basically a great big cleanup.  When I'd fixed the IP
configuration on all the machines to use my DHCP server, which handed out
the WINS (option netbios-name-servers x.x.x.x), and fixed the static
routing on the *cough* MS Proxy machine, it all  -  eventually  -  worked.

Keep in mind also that the WINS server will not necessarily instantly be
updated - machines announce themselves to it periodically, so you may just
have to make sure that ALL the TCP/IP config is right at Layer 3, make sure
the WINS crap is all set up correctly by using DHCP, make your Samba box
sit there listening and registering, and leave it all for about 15 minutes.

Also try "ping"ing the PDC's from each PDC from each other PDC - if the
name lookups don't work, WINS is the problem.

Good luck......  NT is a bitch to set up.

John Davey spake...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having a problem with Samba & network browsing over 3 WinNT Domains set
&gt; up like this.
&gt; It works everywhere but in the USERS domain..
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Admin Domain                        Management Domain
&gt; -----------------                 ------------------
&gt; |Admin  Network |                 | Management Net  |
&gt; |192.168.1.0/24 |                 | 192.168.2.0/24  |
&gt; |               |                 |                 |
&gt; -----------------                 -------------------
&gt;        |                                  |
&gt;        |  Trust                    Trust  |
&gt;        +--&gt;----------+    +------------&lt;--+
&gt;                      |    |
&gt; 			Users Domain
&gt;   ------------------------------------------------
&gt;   |   Users PDC -- 192.168.200.254/24  (BOW)     |
&gt;   |      ||                                      |
&gt;   |      |+Other server -- 192.168.200.253/24    |
&gt;   |      |                                       |
&gt;   |   ........................................   |
&gt;   |      |                                       |
&gt;   |     Samba Server -- 10.10.10.1  (ARROW)      |
&gt;   |                                              |
&gt;   ------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; All boxes are WinNT except for Samba with each PDC running Wins &
&gt; Replicating between Domains.
&gt; 
&gt; The DOMAIN USERS trusts both ADMIN & MANAGEMENT and works fine.
&gt; I've just installed SAMBA on a server to be part of DOMAIN USERS. It is on a
&gt; different Network from the rest of the users domain but meant to be part of
&gt; the domain. The connection to the other users servers is fine HTTP, FTP etc
&gt; all works ping, traceroute etc.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that although Samba(ARROW) appears in the network browse list
&gt; and in the server manager for USERS it is not accessible. The fun part is it
&gt; is accessible from the Admin & Management Domains.
&gt; 
&gt; Now if I start a DOS box on the Users PDC (BOW)
&gt; 
&gt; C:\&gt; net view ARROW
&gt; System error 53
&gt; Network path no found
&gt; 
&gt; Same for
&gt; C:\&gt; net view 10.10.10.1
&gt; System error 53
&gt; Network path no found
&gt; 
&gt; This occurs for all systems in the Users domain but it works correctly for
&gt; all the Parent Domains.
&gt; 
&gt; Now I suspect that it is a WINS/BROWSER issue because the Samba(ARROW) box
&gt; is the only one in its subnet (No NT boxes) and I get the following error in
&gt; log.nmb
&gt; 
&gt; [2000/08/21 12:23:04, 0]
&gt; nmbd/nmbd_browsesync.c:find_domain_master_name_query_fail(362)
