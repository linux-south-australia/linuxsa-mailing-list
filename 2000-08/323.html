Back again on this one,

Just out of interest,

                            In the junkbuster documentation they talk a lot
about ISP's using this software eg how to configure it if you are an ISP, or if
your ISP is running it , or selling backup for their free software.
Oh yeah, and even replacing the ads with your own!!!

Does anyone know of any ISP's in Adelaide that have this sort of service. I'd
be too embarrassed to even ask mine.

And on the matter of ISP's _supporting_ Linux:

I had a bit of a run-in with the tech support at mine the other day - over a
matter that wasn't OS-dependent. As soon as they discovered that I used linux
the whole tone changed and just said they "don't support linux" .

Yet they have a help link to a linux site in NZ for automatically configuring a
pppd script to connect to them. When I pointed this out he replied that he was
in NZ as though I shouldn't expect too much help from him. I wouldn't hold that
against him?

Are there any ISP's out there that are supportive, _officially_???    Sorry, I
meant value-for-money ISP's etc etc.

Cheers,
            Michael
