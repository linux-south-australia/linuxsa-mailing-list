Heya :)
I setup a AMD K6-2 500 about two weeks ago for my school, with an asus (dont
know the exact model number, I didn't build it) super socket 7 motherboard.
the cpu gained 999 bogomips, which is quite decent indeed.
I have found the machine flies for just about any task.  Not sure about the
celeries though.
However do remember if you buy a Celeron there is an upgrade path you don't
have with the AMD K6-2.  You will need to replace the motherboard as well as
the CPU if you intend to upgrade in the future.  So maybe the "slightly more
expensive Celeron" would be an advantage simply for this reason :)
Anyway, for what you want to do with the computer, the slight difference
between a AMD K6-2 and Celeron cpu isn't going to be noticable IMO.

Hi Dave,

I'm running a K6-2 / 400 and it manages everything fine. On a Celeron the
Front Side Bus is only running at 66Mhz whereas on a K6-2 you can run it at
100 or 133Mhz. This means that the cache on the motherboard is running at
100
or 133 compared to 66Mhz and this can be noticable in performance. Please
don't go for an integrated motherboard because you may one day want to
upgrad
the video card and if you don't have an AGP slot (most integrated don't)
you'll have to search high and low for a decent PCI card.

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I am going to build a new machine to run linux (redhat 6.2 on) in the next
&gt; few weeks. It's just going to be used to run Gnome or KDE and things like
&gt; Samba - Mars NWE and generally working out how to use linux.
&gt;
&gt; My budget would allow me to build a AMD K6-2 500 or a Celeron 500 both
&gt; similarly specced. Would there be a great advantage gained by going for
the
&gt; slightly more expensive Celeron or should I get the K6-2.
