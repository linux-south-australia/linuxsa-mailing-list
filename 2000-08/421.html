&gt;Hey Richard,
&gt;
&gt;We are looking t RIAD 1(mirroring) at work for  project I am working on.
&gt;
&gt;We hope to be able to use software RAID but if not we will look at
&gt;hardware RAID.
&gt;
&gt;So I am a bti curiosu about your experineces.
&gt;
&gt;Is this machine you are using HW raid on currently linux box  or are you
&gt;thinking baout making it a linux box becasue of the problems you are
&gt;having/have had?

Has been Linux for the last couple of years ...

&gt;Secondly and only if the amchien is currently a linuxx system, apart from
&gt;problems with fans, what sorts of problems have you experienced with this
&gt;set up?

The hardware stuff is very hard to deal with and time consuming if you run
into problems. Secondly, you don't get info about problems that you might
interpret as impending failure from the controller.

&gt;have they been related to the actual hahrdware (eg failures0 or have they
&gt;been config/softwre related?

Mostly hardware failures, like fan failures.

However, software RAID is likely to be faster than hardware RAID.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Fans are damn annoying things.  Them and RAID controllers.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There I was, looking at the latest problem with the RAID hardware in these
&gt;&gt; machines.  The whole lot had been taken out by an under spec'd fan, which
&gt;&gt; probably cost $0.50 in quantity.  But let me step back.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; For the last two years I have administered a pair of machines that were
&gt;&gt; designed for high reliability.  They had DAC960PG raid controllers in them
&gt;&gt; along with four Seagate Cheetah (10,000 RPM) drives in them, each drive in
&gt;&gt; an IcyDock (or similar) hot-swap canister.  The raid set was set up as 3
&gt;&gt; drives in RAID-5 with a hot standby.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Best setup you could have, we thought.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Reality is, I have spent more time on those RAID controllers and the
&gt;&gt; IcyDock hot-swap canisters, and had more problems with them, than I have
&gt;&gt; had with the drives.  The latest problems come down to fans. A fan gave out
&gt;&gt; on a new canister (and another threatens to do so as well), which looks
&gt;&gt; like it cooked a drive.  (Those 10,000 RPM drives generate a lot of heat,
&gt;&gt; so a fan is needed for good air-flow to remove the heat.) Then I find that
&gt;&gt; two fans on the original canisters have gone or are going as well.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So, in two years, not one drive has had a problem, but several fans have
&gt;&gt; gone (two out of eight for the original set of 8 canisters, and 2 out of
&gt;&gt; seven for the latest set of canisters).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Obviously, one needs to be careful with the hardware that is purchased if
&gt;&gt; it is expected to go the distance.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Just thought that some of you might be interested in this info.
&gt;&gt;
