&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Windows ME now has Blue screen ( with options !!!)

&gt; &gt; ME stands for Millenium Edition which is not released in 
&gt; Australia yet and 
&gt; &gt; is basically Win 2000 w/o NT
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is anything but this. The ME I have heard about (plenty of
&gt; people in Adelaide seem to have seen it, but I haven't) is the latest
&gt; version of the 16-bit Windows 9x core. They've tried hard to 

The Win9x kernel core is 32-bit, otherwise there would be no thunking.
All Microsoft Solutions Providers and Microsoft Partners have WinME in
their MSDN Beta subscription, nothing really mysterous about it.
WinME is not revolutionary just the latest version of 
 - Plug n Play database for new hardware.
 - The new shell to match the one in Win2k, with the menus that fade
away. &lt;shrug&gt;
 - The new windows installer, to make the package distribution built
into Win2k server work.
 - Active dirctory client bits & pieces
 - Other fluff.

We have trialed it at work and found not much difference in speed
compared to 98se.

Remember that as far as I am aware there is no Upgrade to WinME so since
you can't buy a new machine with less than a PIII 667 equivalent
processor these days, speed shouldn't be a big issue.

&gt; get rid of
&gt; DOS. It is supposed to be much more stable, and be the last 
&gt; thing before
&gt; it is Windows 2000 everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the OS that was declared dead by Microsoft at least 
&gt; twice. Windows
&gt; 98 was never going to happen, then Windows 98 SE was the 
&gt; final end of the
&gt; line, and now this. 

It seems that moving people to NT has taken a lot longer than Microsoft
anticipated, especially for gamers, and now Win2k and Linux runs quake3
etc. quite well, all those people should no longer be attached to Win9x.
 I think its impressive that there is still a supported option for
people that need to run software that used to run on their XT under DOS
3.3 :)

Im probably going to get flamed for not bashing Microsoft .. &lt;shrug&gt; oh
well.
