According to the man pages badblocks doesn't find badblocks, but does
allow you to specify them if you have encountered them and want to avoid
using them at a later date:

badblocks(8)

NAME

     badblocks - put a list of bad blocks in a file


SYNOPSIS

     badblocks block_special [block] ...


EXAMPLES


     badblocks /dev/hd1
                         # Handle bad blocks on /dev/hd1

     badblocks /dev/hd3 310 570 1680
                         # Three bad blocks on /dev/hd3


DESCRIPTION

     If a device contains bad sectors,  it  is  important  to  not 
have  them
     allocated  to important files.  This program makes it possible to
collect
     up to 7 bad blocks into a dummy file, so they will not be allocated
for a
     'real'  file.  When  the  program  starts  up,  it asks for a list
of bad
     blocks, unless they are provided as arguments.  Then it  creates 
a  file
     whose name is of the form .Bad_xxxxx, where xxxxx is a pid.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone confirm my belief that the badblocks command actually checks
&gt; the physical disk media for bad blocks?
&gt; 
&gt; I assume it does but would like confirmationfrom someone who actually
&gt; *KNOWS*.
&gt; 
&gt; Also does any one have any experience as to how reliable the badblocks
&gt; program is?
&gt; 
&gt; I am sort of curious as I ran the badblocks program over a disk one day
&gt; and came up with no badblocks.
&gt; The next day I ran it and came up with 100000+ bad blocks, which sort of
&gt; seemed weird since the disk had been sitting in an office environment and
&gt; was brand new and had only had a very light use for about 4 days.
