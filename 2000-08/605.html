Given that NT stands for New Technology, this is more than likely. ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; I think it is anything but this. The ME I have heard about (plenty of
&gt; people in Adelaide seem to have seen it, but I haven't) is the latest
&gt; version of the 16-bit Windows 9x core. 

Which would please Luke Leighton no end...

&gt; They've tried hard to get rid of
&gt; DOS. It is supposed to be much more stable, and be the last thing before
&gt; it is Windows 2000 everywhere.

Depending on what your definition of everywhere is. I am pleased to
announce that I plan to implement a Samba Domain controller in a couple
of weeks and therefore migrate my 2nd last NT server to Linux. The last
NT server will all depend on how well some ASP works under Apache (
we've got this stupid Library system). The great thing about having no
NT servers is that I can finally concentrate on removing Windows from
the desktops (the only problem being the number of proprietry
applications that are inflicted upon us by the forces that be).

&gt; 
&gt; This is the OS that was declared dead by Microsoft at least twice.

Before or after it's release ;-).

&gt; Windows
&gt; 98 was never going to happen, then Windows 98 SE was the final end of the
&gt; line, and now this.
&gt; 

It's great to know that my laptop has never booted Windows and that none
of my machines at home boot Windows except to test Samba. As a result, I
personally don't care what vile creations come out of Redmond. ;-)
