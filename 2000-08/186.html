That's just linux trying to be helpful and informative. It says, hey, the
guy who wrote this man page stuffed up some bits, here they are, and now
I'll display the page anyway. (and hopefully the error isn't too bad)

It's not important and you see it a bit. You don't see this in windows
because windows doesn't tell you these things. The help file or app just
doesn't look right or work right. It doesn't tell you why :-)
 
&gt; And another thing:  I recently had to check through the man pages for a
&gt; particular word ("shopt").
&gt; 
&gt; $ man -K shopt
&gt; grep: /usr/man/man1/rec.1: No such file or directory
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, so there's a problem with the "rec" man page.  Let's check out
&gt; what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; $ su -
&gt; Password: xxxxxxxx
&gt; # cd /usr/man/man1
&gt; # ls -l rec*
&gt; lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           37 Jun 30 09:53 rec.1 -&gt;
&gt; /var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1
&gt; # cat rec.1
&gt; cat: rec.1: No such file or directory   (What????  I hate that!  Can't
&gt; this thing read?)
&gt; # file rec.1
&gt; rec.1: broken symbolic link to /var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1
&gt; 
&gt; What????  I didn't break any symbolic link.  I don't know enough about
&gt; them to mess with them.  Did it break itself, or what?  Do links get
&gt; corrupted?  Does Red Hat install broken links or what?  What's going on
&gt; here?

Is this something to do with the decompressing of the bz2 man
files??? Does it unzip it into a temp file while reading?

The normal link here is:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jun 25 08:53 /usr/man/man1/rec.1.bz2
-&gt; play.1.bz2      

ie rec.1.bz2 is linked to play.1.bz2 (in the same directory)

check if that's right on your system. This might have something to do with
decompressing the man pages into tmp files to read - and it got
confused... I don't know much about this, so I'm guessing.
 
anyway, on my system, there is normally no such file as
/usr/man/man1/rec.1, it's /usr/man/man1/rec.1.bz2  maybe the rec.1 file is
a temporary creation...

How does this work, guys.

&gt; Very frustrating, but it's pretty typical of what I've encountered with
&gt; Linux over the past two or three months (including all the
&gt; pre-installation procedures, e.g. defragging hard drives, partitioning,
&gt; having extended partitions created for me by Disk Druid instead of
&gt; primary partitions, etc, etc).

Most of that is win probs, tho :-) You can install linux the _easy_ way...

Delete all win drives and partitions and start with clean drive.

Install linux. 

Quick and easy :-)  

BTW, I use mostly extended partitions, esp with linux. In fact I don't
think I put any primary partitions on the last slave drive I installed
(aside from the primary which contains all the extended
partitions...) What was the prob with this - did you need a primary for
win?
 
&gt; Every time I set out to do something I'm uncovering one problem, and in
&gt; trying to fix that I uncover another, then in trying to fix that I
&gt; uncover another, and another, and another.

Goes for all OS's, tho I gotta admitt I don't have a lot of linux
trouble. When you do a major new install or upgrade, there's a bit of
tweaking, but I've had a lot more trouble with win installs. 

&gt; Thankfully there's a user community here, or I would've probably
&gt; scrapped Linux a couple of months ago after giving up.

Yes it is good. Keep with it, it's worth it. A win and linux combination
works well, esp if you dual boot for games or run win4lin/vmware to use a
few win apps under linux, etc...
