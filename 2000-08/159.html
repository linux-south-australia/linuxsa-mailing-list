&gt; &gt;&gt;                 ^^^^^   This is not portable. It is a bashism. Use `ls` ...
&gt; &gt;&gt;                         unless you need nesting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So what you're saying here is always put command substitutions in single
&gt; &gt;quotes as standard practice?  (For example, $(ls -al) should instead be
&gt; &gt;$('ls -al') for portability reasons.  Is that right?)
&gt; 
&gt; No. Just use
&gt; 
&gt;   for somevar in `ls`; do

Okay, so if wanted to move away from the bashism of, say -

    for somevar in $(ls -al); do

- I'd put it as -

    for somevar in `ls -al`; do

- have I got that right?
 
&gt; $(ls) is a bashism that may not be in other shells
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;You've made it clear that portability is an important consideration in
&gt; &gt;shell scripting, but it wasn't something I was really taking into
&gt; &gt;account when trying to code this script (obviously a Linux and Unix
&gt; &gt;newbie :) ).  Should portability be given top priority when writing
&gt; &gt;shell scripts?  And if so, is a programmer kind of constrained into a
&gt; &gt;lowest-common-denominator subset of commands when writing for
&gt; &gt;portability across various types of shells?
&gt; 
&gt; This is an issue of professionalism. If you are doing shell scripts for a
&gt; customer, you want to keep clear of non-portable stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; If, OTOH, you are doing it for pleasure, then feel free to do what you want.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I guess I'm really asking here if programming for one shell (say, bash)
&gt; &gt;is greatly different to programming for other shells (say, the Korn
&gt; &gt;shell).
&gt; 
&gt; They have lots of similarities. It is the differences that trip you up :-)

So what shells do you take into account when programming for
portability?  Is it *just* bash, csh and the Korn shell, or are there a
wide variety of others as well?  Must be hard to code for *all* of them
... or do you, say, find out what shell a customer is using and code for
that in mind?

Or is there kind of a "standard" way of shell scripting that is accepted
by all?  (Meta-shell programming, if you will.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;for anothervar in $(ls -ad .[a-zA-Z0-9]*); do
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Ummm, what was wrong with:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;   shopt -s dotglob
&gt; &gt;&gt;   for f in *; do
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Which will pick up all files, including hidden files. However, 'shopt' may
&gt; &gt;&gt; be nonportable as well :-)

I read recently that "It is presumed that the Bourne shell (or some
variation of it, such as bash) exists on all Unix systems."  Is that
true?

&gt; &gt;As superuser, I searched the man pages for both 'shopt' and 'dotglob'
&gt; &gt;using man -K but couldn't find any.  I then tried 'locate shopt' and
&gt; &gt;'locate dotglob' but got nothing.  I then checked the Camel book, 2nd
&gt; &gt;edition, looking for either shopt or dotglob but there were no entries
&gt; &gt;in the index.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;What's 'shopt' and what's 'dotglob'?  Where do I get them?
&gt; 
&gt;   man bash
&gt; 
&gt; and then search for 'shopt' ...

Done.  *Cannot* find anything despite scanning the bash man page up and
down.  Also did "man -K shopt" (as both normal user and superuser) and
got *nothing*.  Then (as superuser in /usr/man/man1) did "grep shopt
bash.1" and got nothing as well.  This is for bash version 1.14.7(1),
and I'm wondering if I need to upgrade bash or if "shopt" is in there
*somewhere* and I'm just overlooking the obvious?

(Also searched for "shop" and "hopt", but to no avail!)
