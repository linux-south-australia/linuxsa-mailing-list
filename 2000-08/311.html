Hi Andy,
I have about 8 friends in NSW and Vic with cable guess what?
as a minimum they have at least 2 machines lanned where one acts as a
gateway. In fact I've LPB'ed with 10 others via this when I was up in
Sydney. The only way they can really tell is if they look at volume then
stick packet sniffer at anyone serving in  excess of x mb a day. Some use
Ishare others use wingate 1 uses linux and hosts a server (private of course).

I expect it's a ploy to minimise the use of their network for servers as such.

Evan


&gt;I had a look at the acceptable usage policy, and parts 5.5 and 6.4 say you
&gt;can't connect LAN's to the service. They appear to use the exact same policy
&gt;for their satelite and cable services too.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I'm starting to get sick of game demos being 100+ meg (yep, I'm a
&gt;gamer), and even with a 56k modem, it takes forever. ADSL would be great,
&gt;particularly the 512k flat rate plan, but the 'can't connect to a lan' thing
&gt;is REALLY a problem, particularly since I have 3 computers at home that are
&gt;currently connected to the lan.
&gt;
&gt;So, do they just say this to try to make more money, or do they actually
&gt;check somehow? I think waiting for another provider to provide DSL would
&gt;kill me, knowing at least one provider (in this case Telstra) already gives
&gt;access. Meanwhile, what happened to cable? Doesn't anyone provide cable in
&gt;Adelaide?
&gt;
