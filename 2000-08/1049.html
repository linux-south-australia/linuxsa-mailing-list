&gt; Had a new staff member join not that long ago.
&gt; 
&gt; "Oh you use the bash shell, I used xxx, oh well I'll learn 
&gt; what you guy's
&gt; have .... blah blah"
&gt; 
&gt; "That's Ok" I reply "I'll assign what ever you want, Red Hat 
&gt; 6.2 has shells
&gt; A,B,C,D etc. etc."
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways no dice, they are still grumbling about using bash. 
&gt; And won't let me
&gt; change it for their login. Well you can please some of the 

that sounds irrational -- if user doesn't like it, but won't let you chnage
it, tell them to go jump :) 

&gt; user some of the
&gt; time etc....
&gt; 
&gt; I would be interested in the pros & cons of this shell over that?

generally, scripting should be done in Bourne, so as to be the most
predictable and portable. csh (and tcsh) are loved by some, but considered
to be a Bad Idea for scripting and working as root due to some security
problems that i am not really aware of. They are generally fine for use as a
user though.

we use ksh (sh &lt; ksh &lt; bash -- it's pretty much an enhanced Bourne, but not
as enhanced as bash) as a root/systems shell, and users choose whatever they
want (but generally bash or tcsh) as a user shell.

&gt; Are some better on the local console and other better by remote?

I don't think there's much of an issue of remote access in shells -- unless
you're talking about editing modes, and hten it's vi vs emacs, really, but
that doesn't matter so much on the command line...

&gt; 
&gt; I don't wanna start a holy war here, is it just a case of 
&gt; Fords vs Holdens
&gt; or are there REAL advantages to some shells?

in a nutshell, here goes

sh -- standard on every unix, reliable, predicatable,safe, featureless.
ksh -- standard on every unix (AFAIK), sh with extensions (history, command
line editing, etc)
bash -- non-standard on most unices (standard on linux), sh with extensions
and changes, most powerful shell (?), not-quite-posix (which can be an issue
for some)
csh -- standard on every unix (afaik), C-like syntax, first popular enhanced
shell, not good for scripting, particularly as root.
tcsh -- non-standard, popular user shell, csh with extensions...

and I'm no expert, so I could be completly wrong -- I'm sure there's an
excellent reference somewehre on the web, or in an oreilly book or
something...

and yes, I know I repeated myself here, but i wrote this in two separate
sittings... :)
