&gt;
&gt;So what you're saying here is always put command substitutions in single
&gt;quotes as standard practice?  (For example, $(ls -al) should instead be
&gt;$('ls -al') for portability reasons.  Is that right?)

No. Just use 

  for somevar in `ls`; do

$(ls) is a bashism that may not be in other shells

&gt;You've made it clear that portability is an important consideration in
&gt;shell scripting, but it wasn't something I was really taking into
&gt;account when trying to code this script (obviously a Linux and Unix
&gt;newbie :) ).  Should portability be given top priority when writing
&gt;shell scripts?  And if so, is a programmer kind of constrained into a
&gt;lowest-common-denominator subset of commands when writing for
&gt;portability across various types of shells?

This is an issue of professionalism. If you are doing shell scripts for a
customer, you want to keep clear of non-portable stuff.

If, OTOH, you are doing it for pleasure, then feel free to do what you want.

&gt;I guess I'm really asking here if programming for one shell (say, bash)
&gt;is greatly different to programming for other shells (say, the Korn
&gt;shell).

They have lots of similarities. It is the differences that trip you up :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;for anothervar in $(ls -ad .[a-zA-Z0-9]*); do
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Ummm, what was wrong with:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   shopt -s dotglob
&gt;&gt;   for f in *; do
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Which will pick up all files, including hidden files. However, 'shopt' may
&gt;&gt; be nonportable as well :-)
&gt;
&gt;As superuser, I searched the man pages for both 'shopt' and 'dotglob'
&gt;using man -K but couldn't find any.  I then tried 'locate shopt' and
&gt;'locate dotglob' but got nothing.  I then checked the Camel book, 2nd
&gt;edition, looking for either shopt or dotglob but there were no entries
&gt;in the index.
&gt;
&gt;What's 'shopt' and what's 'dotglob'?  Where do I get them?

  man bash

and then search for 'shopt' ...
