Hi.

What's going on here?

$ man echo
Formatting page, please wait...
&lt;standard input&gt;:34: warning: numeric expression expected (got `N')
&lt;standard input&gt;:49: a newline character is not allowed in an escape
name
&lt;standard input&gt;:52: a newline character is not allowed in an escape
name
&lt;standard input&gt;:61: cannot use newline as a starting delimiter

(It showed the man page, but I only saw the error lines after I quit out
of man.)

A short while later I checked on the echo man page again.  *This* time
however, there were *no* error messages after quitting man, and haven't
been for the echo man page since then.  How confusing.

What's going on?

-------------------

And another thing:  I recently had to check through the man pages for a
particular word ("shopt").

$ man -K shopt
grep: /usr/man/man1/rec.1: No such file or directory

Okay, so there's a problem with the "rec" man page.  Let's check out
what it is.

$ su -
Password: xxxxxxxx
# cd /usr/man/man1
# ls -l rec*
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           37 Jun 30 09:53 rec.1 -&gt;
/var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1
# cat rec.1
cat: rec.1: No such file or directory   (What????  I hate that!  Can't
this thing read?)
# file rec.1
rec.1: broken symbolic link to /var/tmp/sox-root/usr/man/man1/play.1

What????  I didn't break any symbolic link.  I don't know enough about
them to mess with them.  Did it break itself, or what?  Do links get
corrupted?  Does Red Hat install broken links or what?  What's going on
here?

-------------------

Very frustrating, but it's pretty typical of what I've encountered with
Linux over the past two or three months (including all the
pre-installation procedures, e.g. defragging hard drives, partitioning,
having extended partitions created for me by Disk Druid instead of
primary partitions, etc, etc).

Every time I set out to do something I'm uncovering one problem, and in
trying to fix that I uncover another, then in trying to fix that I
uncover another, and another, and another.

Thankfully there's a user community here, or I would've probably
scrapped Linux a couple of months ago after giving up.

R,

Paul.
