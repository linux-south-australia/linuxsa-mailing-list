 &gt; 
 &gt; ok, so my understanding of NAT just flew out the window. I thought NAT
 &gt; was the process of "wrapping" the internal packet with another that had
 &gt; a real world IP.
 
No, it doesn't do that at all.  

Think of NAT as being a bit like a cross between a proxy and IP-forwarding
(routing).  An explanation is below, followed by a discussion of implications
for gaming.

Consider TCP.  A TCP session from 192.168.1.1's web browser to 150.101.89.3's
web server begins like this:

    Client 192.168.1.1                           Server 150.101.89.3

    TCP flags: SYN
    ip_src = 192.168.1.1       |
    ip_dst = 150.101.89.3      |-----------------------&gt;
    tcp_sport = 21436 (random) |
    tcp_dport = 80

                                                 TCP flags: SYN ACK
                                               | ip_src = 150.101.89.3
                        &lt;----------------------| ip_dst = 192.168.1.1
                                               | tcp_sport = 80
                                                 tcp_dport = 21436

     TCP flags: ACK
     ip_src = 192.168.1.1      |
     ip_dst = 150.101.89.3     |-----------------------&gt;
     tcp_sport = 21436         |
     tcp_dport = 80

After that 3-way handshake, actual data transfer can begin.

The packets concerned probably travel through all kinds of routers
to get from 192.168.1.1 to 150.101.89.3.  There are two major assumptions
which color the interpretation of the packets under discussion:

   1.  Each router passes through the packets with the headers intact;  and

   2.  The destination addresses are always routable (i.e.: both conversants
       are using "real" IP addresses).

According to RFC 1597 and RFC 1918, 192.168.0.0/16 addresses aren't actually
routable, so my example above wouldn't really work:  Routers on the Internet
don't know how to reach any IP address which starts with 192.168.x.y.  So,
let's think about what a NAT gateway could do to address that issue.

A NAT gateway will receive an "inside" packet described by the tuple
(ip_src, tcp_sport) and remap the IP address so that it's routable (usually,
but not always, by substituting its own IP address).  So, if a NAT gateway
has an external IP address of 203.56.192.40, it'll take an input packet
which looks like (ip_src, tcp_sport) = (192.168.1.1, x) and emit 
(203.56.192.40, x) to the Internet.

It can't stop there, though.  Remember that the 192.168.x.y hosts don't
know that they're talking through a NAT gateway, so there is the potential
(and, indeed, the likelihood) that more than one host will attempt to use
the same source port number;  As a result, the NAT gateway also needs
to make-up a new value for "tcp_sport" to replace "x" in the tuple above.
So we might end up with (192.168.1.1, 21436) being mapped to 
(203.56.192.40, 16765).

The NAT gateway needs to remember this mapping, because the server in
the outside world will be sending packets back to whatever host is mentioned
in a packet's ip_src field, which will be 203.56.192.40 in this case.  So,
after making a mapping like the one described above, the NAT gateway also
needs to know that any packets received from the Internet addressed to
203.56.192.40 port 16765 should be forwarded on to 192.168.1.1 port 21436.
The NAT gateway also needs to monitor the state of the connection;  When it
sees TCP FIN packets being exchanged (signifying the tear-down of a
connection), or TCP RST packets, or various ICMP packets, or whatever, it
needs to know that it's safe to "forget" the mapping it has built up for
that connection.  Each mapping takes up a finite amount of memory, so 
we can't keep hoarding them forever (and there's no point keeping them 
after a connection has died anyway).

It's also possible to set up "static mappings".  So, if your web server
is running on the "inside" host 192.168.1.62, you might tell your NAT
gateway that any packets with a destination of 203.56.192.40 port 80 should
be remapped to 192.168.1.62 port 80.  The same usually holds true for UDP.
Often you can use IP aliases on a single NAT gateway if more than one IP
address is routed to it, so that your NAT gateway can "pretend" to be 
multiple "inside" machines.

Now let's address this to games in an ADSL environment.  You have *one*
IP address, so there can be no IP aliasing.  You have a game which expects
to see a games server out on the Internet somewhere on, say, port 7777.
However, furthermore, you often also find that the game server will
communicate with the client on port 7777 as well.  

That means you can't have more than one "inside" host playing the game
at once.  Why?  Because the game server will be transmitting UDP packets to
(external_ip_address, 7777), and your NAT gateway will be making a decision
to forward those packets to exactly *one* internal host.  You can only 
map port 7777 to one internal IP address;  as such, the game could be said
to be NAT-hostile.

If you want to play Unreal Tournament, or Tribes, or Counterstrike, or 
any of countless other games through a NAT gateway, you first need to
make sure that the game server won't be "insisting" on a particular port
number for the client.  And, in many (most?) cases you'll find that that
isn't the case.

So, that doesn't mean you can't play games through a NAT gateway;  It
just means that there isn't a whole lot of point in inviting your friends
over to share the LPB experience, because only one of you will be able
to play at a time.

 &gt; Are you saying that NAT simply marks the packet with a single bit
 &gt; change?

No, it remaps the IP source address and TCP/UDP source port for outbound
packets, and the IP destination address and TCP/UDP destination port for
inbound packets.

What you described in your paragraph above is called "tunnelling", and
it has nothing to do with NAT.

 &gt; If you're suggesting that only one NAT client can play at a
 &gt; time, I'm I right?

Bingo.
