&gt; It was my understanding that it was only illegal if the PSTN you're

&gt; Unless they've changed the rules in the last 6 months or so, it is legal
&gt; for someone to wire a computer network, as long as that network is not
&gt; connected to the DIGITAL public phone network. Analog phone lines are
&gt; fine.

The ACA rules are plain.  Fixed wiring that connects to a carrier
network, or is in a carrier network has to be done by a licensed installer.

Plugging in a modem isn't a change to the fixed wiring.  Nor is using
a RJ45 patch panel.  As a counter-example, using a Krone tool on a MDF
is a change to the fixed cabling.

There was a huge hole that let anyone wire LAN networks, alarms
and fire systems in most private and domestic premises.  Building
owners plugged this hole by insisting that work within their buildings
only be done by licensed installers.

This made sense.  Idiots running cabling can threaten the fire
integrity of a building, something that may effect a resident a
decade or two after the idiot has moved on.

But it was overkill to require people to know about aerial and
underground wiring when the most they would do is pull cables
through ceilings.

Another major problem for building owners was that having differing
standards for the installation of phone and data cabling defeated
the object of structured cabling, where all cabling tasks are run
through the one cabling plant.

The rules are about to change to make the licensing process better,
the new "cabling provider rules" have a Restricted category that
allows indoor cabling only.  You need to do two subjects at TAFE
to get the "competencies" to qualify.

If you work in a networking field, you now need to get the Restricted
registration to wield a Krone tool or to install fixed cabling, whether
for data, alarm, fire or phone.
