Ian,

That is interesting.

I recently conatacted Sola via their international web site and asked for
info on a UPS for which we dont currently have manuals, and they faxed it
to us quite quicky (within a day), presumably from overseas somewhere.

I did however ask about linux support, which they did not address in their
reply they just quietly did not mention it, so I assumed there was none,
but they did not want ot mention that.

So I am really glad you have now supplied me with the missing part of the
puzzle!

Thanks
Jason

&gt; I must say though that I made an inquiry to Sola Australia only yesterday about Linux support for their UPS's.

&gt; Today I received the best response from any company yet.
&gt; 
&gt; They went into a lot of detail about Unix support and even pointed me to the source code should I need to recompile for my particular operating system.  They also advised that should I still need help, I can forward a query to them and their programmers will look at it.
&gt; 
&gt; That's the sort of attitude I like to see, so check 'em, out!  www.solaaust.com.au
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to establish a city wide / national web page of Linux friendly suppliers / vendors.  I'm sick and tired of the screwed up anti-competitive practices of companies.
