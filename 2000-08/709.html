Call me dumb but I am having a problem setting up a local network along with my
ppp connection to the internet.  What I would like to have is set up my machine
to be a local DNS to capture names but still have my ISP's nameservers being
used as the secondary and tertiary nameservers.  Also I want to be able to set
my main machine up as a DHCP server to allow friends to be able to just "plug it
in". Being relatively new to networking I am not sure how all this works as when
I try to RTM and configure my machine how I believe it should work i get errors
and I cannot connect to my ISP.  Does my local machine name get wiped when I am
connected to the internet and what about my IP address which becomes dynamically
assigned on connection to the internet.  Do I then have 2 IP's for the one
computer?  As I said, I need to learn a bit more about how all this works.
I have yet to get DHCP working even after following the relevant how-to's.  At
the moment I do not have a hub so am using a crossover cable.  I do know the
network cards both work as I installed Mandrake7.1 via NFS at the installfest.
Also I have booted both machines up from a 1 floppy linux distro and was able to
ping each machine from the other.  What I have recently learned is that
linuxconf seems to reverse any changes or overwrite networking settings that you
may have configured manually  hmmmmm....  What for instance should my
resolv.conf look like?  do I put my computers domain in or my isp's domain in?

Any thoughts/help/advice? please

Matt M
