&gt; I've configured the secondary mx machine by adding

&gt; documentation.

Several things:

1) Do you actually have FEATURE(mailertable) and FEATURE(access_db)
enabled?

2) I think RedHat actually supply a makefile; you could run make in
/etc/mail, or do an ls -l on the affected files to make sure that
the db files built correctly.

3) Did you restart sendmail after making these changes? (this one's
a bit iffy, as I don't think you need to restart sendmail to get it
to reread changes in external DB files).

Ahhh, empower.com.au - I've got a bone to pick with your mail
administrator (if he's you, all the better).  Your email system
is one of those annoying ones that think that ignoring email
with an Envelope Sender of "&lt;&gt;" is a really great way of cutting
down on spam[1].  However, this also causes us external email
administrators problems, as bounce email and return receipts
are sent with this envelope sender.  The upshot is, your email
user requests a Return Receipt, then you reject it when we send
you the Receipt, causing a "double bounce" at our end.  This is
very non-RFCish behaviour.  I've sent email to your postmaster
about this, but received no response.  If you can forward this
on to the appropriate person and get them to fix it, that would
be one less headache in the world[2].

[1]  Quote from a.s.r.:  "So is ignoring any email with the letter
     'e' in it." In Other Words, it's a lame hack at best to stop
     spam, yet it breaks a lot of other functionality.

[2]  Well, in my world anyway, which is what counts. :-)
