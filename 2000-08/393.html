Hi,

I guess that when one expresses opinions, one can expect messages like the
following (and in HTML).

Does anyone actually know anything about the following scratchings?

&gt;       Richard, You may be interested to know that the Clipsal C-Bus
&gt;product has been  extremely successful overseas, in the market were you
&gt;clearly believe it could  not succeed.

Actually, I don't recall saying that I did not think that it could succeed
OS. I said that it was another example of an Australian-only piece of
technology being foisted on us by yet another company.

If they have managed to sell it outside Austalia, then they have made their
product more interesting.  

A quick seach on Google could find very little on C-Bus, though, so I
wonder what evidence is being used to make the claim above.

&gt;                                        C-Bus is now purchased and
&gt;distributed by Toshiba, a company who  for many years have been at the
&gt;forefront of technology, but have decided to  have their name shown on a
&gt;product made in South Australia by a family owned  company.

Hmmm, I couldn't find anything on Toshiba and C-Bus, but perhaps they have
simply negelected to tell the world what they are doing.  Perhaps the
feeling of motherhood and apple pie compelled the author to forget about
providing evidence.
 
&gt;A great number of other companies have also decided to be involved  with
&gt;Clipsal C-Bus, including Crestron, CI technologies and Cisco Systems. 

Oh great. More unsubstantiated claims ...

One wonders what Cisco is interested in the technology for? Perhpaps they
are going to offer Cisco router kits that you can integrate into your
lighting control, or perhaps it was the existence of documentation on the
C-BUS termination kit in Cisco documentation that lead the author to make
the above claim.

&gt;                                                                       It 
&gt;would be my opinion that if people like yourself took a chance in
&gt;developing new  technology as has Clipsal that perhaps in the future more
&gt;overseas companies  will be coming to Australia to see what we have to
&gt;offer. 

Oh, I am mortally wounded. I shall curl up into a ball and dissapear up my
fundamental orifice.

&gt;       Kind Regards Darren Blake
