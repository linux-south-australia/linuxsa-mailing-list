&gt; And even worse, clause 5.7 in the Acceptable Use policy says

Some of the high speed internet (cable and ADSL) providers in Canada say
in their clauses:

"servers of any kind are not permitted"

I decided to take the honest approach, and I said that I would be
running an email server only, and could I have a standard access plan,
but buy an optional static IP.

They said, "any server at all means you have to buy the professional
pack" ( at about 3 times the price. I argued that I would be producing
less traffic than the average cable modem/napster user, and that they
still aren't really justifying their attitude, and in fact that they
would be loosing business.

They haven't responded.

But hey, at least I got the choice :)
