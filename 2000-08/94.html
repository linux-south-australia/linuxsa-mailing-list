I used to work at Chariot before it went pulic and I cna say that the
(technical staff including thsoe who answered the phone s well as
those who were the NOC)staff there at that time did know about linux, all
of them used linux as there  main platform(except for the pervy manager
who used...Frisby) and all dialed in to Chariot with it.

Having said that I know the coprorate culture and faces at Chariot have
changed a lot, but I know for a fact at leat three of my prevous
colleagues are there and are doing support at one level or another, but i
am not sure what level.

There Linux set up guide is still there:

www.chariot.net.au/help/linuxsetup.htm

And personally I would not change ISPs if i thought he new ISP had better
user supprt for linux.

I personally typically want he phone number, the mail server names the
DNS addresses, the proxy if required and leave me alone.

But that is me, others may well prefer a higher level of support.

My main criteria are value for money ( ie a reasonable tradeoff between
performance and cost).

Now if you change your question a bit (or define support differenltly to
the way I think you mean it in your context below) to "would you change
ISPs to an ISP that gave better non techinical support for linux (eg
contributed time,money or other resources to linux or other Free/open
source software)?" then yes, all other things being equal - ie the value
(performance/cost) would still need to be there.

It used to annoy the crap out of me the company I worked for with fairly
high revenues (if not profits) and a penguinon their homepage would not
contribute a red cent or any other resource to the software that kept it
afloat and made it stable (they had had an early fling with NT - oh the
folly) despite suggestions that they do so, from at least one of their 
staff ;-) .

&gt; The only two ISP's that could help me with my Linux problems have been:
&gt; 
&gt; * SeNet
&gt; * Rebel
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst SeNet don't openly support Linux, I would get replies such as "I
&gt; don't understand but I'll forward this to X on our staff who can help
&gt; you...please wait for his (inevitably a he) reply and liase with him".
&gt; What I liked about SeNet was that the person who answered would answer
&gt; truthfully. I'd prefer the support staff actually say "I don't know, I
&gt; have no expertise there" so I can look for other avenues to get help.
&gt; 
&gt; Naturally, you would all know that Tellurian, of which David Newall is a
&gt; director, runs rebel. I've not had to ask them too many questions, but
&gt; when I have had to I've always got a satisfactory response.
&gt; 
&gt; This leads me to another set of questions...who of you out there have
&gt; asked Linux related questions to your ISP's support staff? What response
&gt; did you get? Was it satisfactory? Would YOU change ISP's if you knew
&gt; that someone at the ISP could help you with your ISP-Linux related
&gt; problems [I would...I know of ISP's who have flatly refused to support
&gt; Linux as a platform]....
