&gt; But you are right, I'm using KDE, since Matt presented it at one of the
&gt; LinuxSA meeting, 

Damn that Matthew - causer of all sorts of problems! :-)

&gt;                  quicker than GNOME though. I have to admit my computer
&gt; is pretty old ( Pentium Pro-200, 2MB video, 2GB HDD Linux, plus half of
&gt; another HDD of about 750MB and 750MB for windows. RAM is 48MB, but still
&gt; slow for RH 6.2)

This system is very useable.  Until a fortnight ago I was using a Cyrix 686
120MHz with 64Mb RAM and I insisted on running GNOME!  Swap space is important,
but adding more won't necessarily speed things up.  You may be able to run more
stuff simultaneously with more swap, but speed won't improve.

Like I said, for a more enjoyable (speed wise) environment, go back to a
lightweight window manager instead of KDE and you should see a good improvement.
Don't run bloatware like netscrape, star orifice or wordimperfect unless you
need to and exit these apps before trying to do anything else with your box. 
Don't even *think* of using vmware :-)

The other thing, turn off services you don't need.  Try running "ntsysv" as root
and turning off various daemons that you're not using.  Pesky nfsd's, smbd's,
httpd's and the like can all go.  Read the manual first before turning
*everything* off :-)

&gt; One thing that I don't understand at all is that it slows down! It seems
&gt; to become slower as the with time.

Sounds like a nice memory leak.  The less bloatware you run, the less leaks can
happen!  Time to start a crusade against bloatware, and crusty code that leaks. 
Oh yeah, this is a Linux mailing list already.  sigh.
