&gt;&gt; This requires 4 256-pointer tables. A mere 4 kBytes.

&gt;&gt; Step A is a sort of binary search.
&gt;&gt; I might right a little tool to automatically generate the
&gt;&gt; jump-tables.

Hmmm, maybe I have misunderstood what is required here, but here is my
understanding:

You have a 32-bit field, and you know that only one bit is set in that
32-bit field, and you want to quickly find it?

The obvious solution is thirty-two word table:

   bits[0]  =   1
   bits[1]  =   2
   bits[2]  =   4
   ...
   bits[32] = 2**32-1

Then loop through until you hit a match. The index is what you want.

This will take on average 16 passes through the loop and 16 comparisons.
Can be tightly coded in Assembler.

However, it seems to me a binary search will get you the value in 5
comparisons or there abouts and five passes through the loop. Of course,
unsigned comparisons will be needed.

The approach described trades off more storage to give a max of four sets
of operations:

   mask
   shift to right place
   check non-zero
   if so, index into table to get position
   if not loop to check the next chunk.
 
I think you will find that, on average, you will still have as much work to
do as a binary search, for more storage required.

&gt;&gt; In my case, it is worth the bother because I've got
&gt;&gt; a device driver which loses 98% of received packets.
&gt;&gt; Obviously I need to do some optimisation here.
&gt;
&gt;I assume since you are going to these lengths that the singnals that you
&gt;are processing are more evenly distributed than just getting a couple of
&gt;common ones, in which case you could just put tests in the form of a
&gt;case statement or whatever with the most common ones at the top.
&gt;
&gt;If that's not possible then your solution does indeed seem a nice
&gt;compromise, although I'm made uneasy at the thought of using 4k to store
&gt;32 pointers. :)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
