Anyone who disagree's with the following, please feel free to correct
me.

Firstly:

There are free to download and boxed/paid for versions of _both_
RedHat & Mandrake and both boxed sets cost around the same.

Next:

RedHat is generally considered the standard that other _commercial_
distributions are based on and generally is quite stable and feature
rich.

Mandrake originally started as a RedHat repackaged to include KDE,
whose toolkit (Qt) at the time was under a not very open source
licence, but now is a fully mature distribution of it's own. 
Mandrake tends to have more of the user friendly GUI type setups.  It
also includes more "eye candy" type packages (ie flashy, for example,
although RedHat has gnome installed, people generally would probably
install Helix Gnome over the top, but Mandrake 7.1 has the Helix
enhancements pre installed).

I personally use Mandrake 7.1 at home & at work (a little ;) and find
it quite easy to setup and use, but my brother uses RH and has very
little problems as well.  That said I think that Mandrake makes a
sightly more user friendly setup, with all the configuration options
in one place (and the Web based administration feature is very handy
for server admin).  

On Mandrake's minus side, the new menu system (all new rpm packages
are added to the menus of all the window managers automatically)
means that adding non-Mandrake packages (ie rpm's without the mdk)
can appear in strange places.  Also Mandrake specific packages oftem
come out later than general rpm's (although you can use general
rpm's).

That said either distribution makes a fine Operating System for both 
the beginner and the seasoned professional.

Sorry for blabing on so much.  Hope this has been informative and
helpfull.

Cheers.
Damien.

&gt; A quick question to help me decide..
&gt; Is there much difference between redhat 6.2 which I can get for
&gt; free, or
&gt; is Mandrake significantly better which costs 90-140?
&gt; Thanks, Noel..
