Hi gurus,

I know "Thanks Godness is Friday". Still hoping to get a reply soon.
Guru advice: - "my computer needs a bit of physical upgrade", by Matt
and Michael.
At the moment: 
-48MB RAM
-2MB video
-200Pro
My question is: "Do the following sufice to keep going for a while?"
-64MB RAM  (does anyone know of any second EDO RAM?)
-8MB video AGP (any good? is it a friend of Linux?)
-Processor has to stay as it is at the moment and upgrade here could
cost        around $1200.00
I definately need a larger HDD. I considered 10MB and 15MB. I hear
people having problems with HDD's of 17MB. Which way to go 10 or 15MB?
Also Seagate or Western Digital? I have two Western Digital HDD's at the
moment, one has to go.
Before the upgrade I'll need to save some data and I'll have to buy LS
disks. My guess is that best price would be at Universities, that's not
a problems, I've got some ties there, best price being $15.00 each.
I'll appreaciate any reply.
Thank you and best wishes,

Nick.
