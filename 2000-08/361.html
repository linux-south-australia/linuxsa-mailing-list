Daryl, 
Thanks for answer. I think I could not understand your idea clearly. In simple my question is, can i talk back up of only change portion of file as soon as the file changes AND even if its open ??

&gt;No, just a wannabe.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have 2 GB file on unix/linux. I want to take back up (or replicate) of
&gt;&gt; this file as soon as there is any change in this file.
&gt;
&gt;As soon as, or at a predetermined time? (ie, backup time).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; If we use incremental back up, it will take bake up of all 2 GB file size
&gt;&gt; for a single word change.
&gt;
&gt;OK, to find changes, you're going to need something to compare it _to_.
&gt;That means you're going to need a replica of the file anyway.  An option
&gt;would be to get the application (if you can modify that) to write a
&gt;transaction log of file changes, and back that up instead.  Then,
&gt;periodically apply those changes to the main file.  Coincidently, this
&gt;is what Zope's ZODB does (except that the transactions are part of the
&gt;main database file, so you end up backing up the lot anyway).  If you
&gt;can't get to the application source, a solution might be to get to the
&gt;application's binary; if it's dynamically linked, you can intercept its
&gt;calls to open(), lseek(), write(), etc. and determine your data delta
&gt;(:-)) from that.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Q2 :- What are the products (commercial and non-commercial like unix
&gt;&gt; utilities) support back up of Open files (application) ???
&gt;
&gt;Many (in either camp).  tar, dump and cpio are commonly used backup
&gt;utilities that ship with standard Unices.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope, i didn't ask a tough question.
&gt;
&gt;You certainly asked enough mailing lists.  (followup trimmed back).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;  Daryl Tester
