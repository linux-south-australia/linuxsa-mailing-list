&gt;I am trying to set up a little print server
&gt;with samba without success.
&gt;The server has an IP 192.168.0.71 and the
&gt;machine I wish to print from 192.168.0.70(this one)
&gt;
&gt;I can telnet into the printserver and echo "blah blah" &gt; /dev/lp0
&gt;and it prints fine, I have set up the printer with RedHat printtool
&gt;on this machine but cannot get it to print. below is my smb.conf
&gt;I am sure something is amiss here but I cannot see it.
&gt;Sorry about the length of the post

This has almost nothing to do with Samba.  Get lpd printing to a remote
printer from 192.168.0.70 to 192.168.0.71 first. Then, if you have a
printers section in your smb.conf file, it will see the remote printer and
print to it.

&gt;Kind regards
