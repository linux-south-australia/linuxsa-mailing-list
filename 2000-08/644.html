&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; I haven't been here for a while because I haven't had any problems, and I
&gt; have been busy studying, alas, I seem to have stuffed up xdm (graphical
&gt; login) in RedHat 6.0.
&gt; 
&gt; I was miniding my own business, shutting down out of the Gnome window
&gt; manager when I get a message saying that unmounting the root partition
&gt; failed. On restart I got the 'force checked on /dev/hda5 .....' message.
&gt; Where I would usually see my login after the rest of bootup, instead I saw
&gt; just the grey screen with the X pointer (which I assume is Xwindows server).
&gt; I dropped out of X with ctrl-alt-&lt;- and panicking I ran x-configurator
&gt; again.
&gt; 
&gt; Now if I log in through command-line I can run startx, which gets me back to
&gt; to my regular graphical desktop etc, although everything is grainy (I can't
&gt; be sure if this is because I ran Xconfigurator again and no I didn't have a
&gt; backup of my original XF86Config file).
&gt; I have looked everywhere I can think.
&gt; 
&gt; If I run '/usr/bin/gdm -nodaemon'       from the command line I get the grey
&gt; screen again.
&gt; 
&gt; my '/etc/inittab' ends with
&gt; 'x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon'
&gt; 
&gt; '/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers'    -- points to    ':0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X'
&gt; X however is a symbolic link which points to Xwrapper and I don't know what
&gt; that is (shouldn't it be pointing to a driver specific to my card SiS6326
&gt; ??)
&gt; 
&gt; I hope the collective wisdom of LinuxSA can help me out,
&gt; 
&gt; tia, Nic Bishop    =)
&gt; 

It would seem perhaps the disk unmount failure thing, and the therefore
fsck has caused perhaps enlightenment to fail. try redirecting the
output of startx to a file, and examine the output. failing that, after
starting X, ctl-al-f1 to a command line, and try running enlightenment
from there, and notice perhaps any errors.

mind you - I am assuming you are running enlightenment......
