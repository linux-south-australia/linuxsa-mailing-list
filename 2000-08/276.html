You are foreggting that ADSL is only a delivery technology.
It is just anotehr way tpo get bits down your phone line.

You don't have to buy your bytes from BigPoing, you can get them with nay
other ISP you like that has ADSL connectivty.

And telstra says this on their own homepage.

Of course which other isps will adopt this technology is anyoines guess,
and whether their policy willbe more or less generous than Telstras is
yet to be seen.

But there is nothing stopping you from using telstras DSl to buy bytes
form any otehr ISP that wants to sellthem to you.

You are not obliged or required to buy your bytes off of telstra.

And if you wnat to you can choose other bigpong services which dont ahve
that acceptable use policy, thogh you will likely have to pay by the byte.

No such thing as a free lunch.

Whats pisses me is that I live 5 minute walk fromthe city, I step out my
friont gate and turn left and there is the Telstra bulifding in the city
not more than 1.5 km away.

But I can't get DSL.
God help rural australians (although they get subsideised sattelite....)

&gt; 
&gt; And even worse, clause 5.7 in the Acceptable Use policy says
&gt; that you cannot use automated programs to continually send
&gt; or receive "high volumes of data". Problem is, they don't
&gt; actually define what they mean by "high volumes of data" in
&gt; quantitative terms.
&gt; 
&gt; So, presumably you can't setup your own local news feed (using 
&gt; suck, leafnode, etc...), host your own personal web server, use 
&gt; rdist to keep your own Redhat mirror uptodate, etc..., for fear 
&gt; of crossing their undefined boundary. And if you do cross the 
&gt; boundary, they reserve the right to restrict or remove your 
&gt; access without warning!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm starting to think that I won't bother being an early
&gt; adopter of ADSL until the rules become more reasonable. What's
&gt; the point of high speed, high volume access if you can't make 
&gt; use of it?
&gt;

         Some people have a way about them that seems to say: "If I have
