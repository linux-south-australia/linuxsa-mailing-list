&gt; Ah, but I think that is supposed to be that by definition
&gt; (although I can't remember where that is defined - perhaps
&gt; only folklore?).  Certainly, I've always thought that to
&gt; be that case.

No it's not.  The IETF defined the format as "dotted decimal".

The BSD wierdness that allows IP addresses in differing bases
and even without the dots (as in 0x01020304) does not comply
with the IETF standard.

The RFC defining URIs deliberately gives the BNF for IPv4
addresses becasue of this egarious error.  They wanted
  <A HREF="http://10.1.2.3/">http://10.1.2.3/</A>
and
  <A HREF="http://010.1.2.3/">http://010.1.2.3/</A>
to refer to the same web site, as a user (even an experienced
user) would expect it to.

BSD's extension of the IETF syntax wouldn't matter so much
except that it has unfortunate user interface consequences.
Only C programmers expect additional leading zeroes to be
of any consequence.

I've even use programs that print IP addreses as
 001.002.003.004
so that they line up nicely, not realising that
the user is about to be very confused if they
cut-and-paste such an address.

This isn't the only problem with the BSDish implementation of
the IETF protocols.  Another particularly annoying one is
that it does not report the device that generated an ICMP
Unreachable Administratively Denied.  You need to run a
trace tool like Ethereal to find out whose router stopped
you -- that is, you need to be root!
