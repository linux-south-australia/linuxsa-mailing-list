Until you buy the house that has the bodgy cabling installed
by the previous owner :-)

Cabling is one of those things where the quality of the installation
is difficult for the average consumer to estimate.  So there needs
to be some sort of scheme so that when someone sees something that
looks like "LAN cabling" that it is actually capable of running
LAN traffic.  Few property purchasers have $1200 of TDM in their
back pocket to test RJ45 sockets.

I'm not a great defender of the current scheme.  The new scheme looks
like it has a lower level of required training that allows someone
to get a certificate to perform easy cabling tasks.

Finally, I don't think that RJ45 about the house is going to be
that widespread.  The cost of IEEE802.11 wireless is dropping so
fast that cat5 for a few devices about the home is uneconomic.  Take
this from someone who has two cat5 sockets in every room and
single mode fibre to the backyard shed.
