&gt;LOL
&gt;Funny though... ive had WinME Final installed for about 6weeks now (as my prim
desktop box) and have not seen one single BSOD yet.
&gt;And this is with playing tempramental games/apps.
&gt;
&gt;Actaully... im quite amazed that WinME for me is pretty much 100% stable.

I have trialed WinME on 4 different boxes over the last two days. The first
box ... only one BSOD in the entire 3 hours I was messing with it, however installed
no extra software. Next two boxes, all I've done is install and had no problems
there, but still haven't setup driverz/appz etc yet. The last one being my own
personal box (PIII-733/128mb) froze 12 times during setup and had to re-start
the setup process before it would even install. Once installed i've seen 4 BSOD's
and since all driverz have been installed it has been reliable. Keeping in mind
I still haven't installed any appz. 
As far as everything else, they have got rid of the underlying dos portion of
the operating system, it is running exactly the same speed / reliablity etc
as what win98 SE was running. 

The thing I'm most unimpressed with though, driver support.

I have a Sound Blaster Live, Creative DXR3, Matrox G200 video card and neither
of these three components had driverz in winME. I would have though that products
that have been around for around a year or so would have driver support in an
almost new product. Even my external modem was not recognized !
