I think I know what you mean, but it isn't accurate. Rather than an essay,
here's some data points:

  - There were several distributions around before Red Hat. Red Hat was
    in no way a founding distribution. The RH 1994 Mother's day release was
    important because it was easier to use than any previous distribution.
    Other distributions soon matched this capability.

  - RH have funded some important pieces of software. RH have had a 
    successful entry to the American stock market, and they were the
    first all-Linux company to do so. Thus it is no wonder that in the 
    US RH have built an excellent brand awareness. Mandrake acknowledge
    this by advertising RH compatibility.

  - In a small number of countries Red Hat is a measurable market leader. 
    This includes the US, which of course is a very large market (however,
    it isn't clear that the US is the biggest market for desktop Linux,
    in contrast to most other OSs.) According to the monthly sales
    figures for boxed software in the US Mandrake have been very nearly
    the same as Red Hat for the last six months. (That doesn't mean that
    Mandrake has the same market share though!) In a lot of Europe
    Mandrake have done even better, except in the UK where for some reason
    RH have strong brand presence. I think that the LinuxSA group has 
    certainly a very strong RH influence. Others have commented on this
    here. I've no idea why, but I don't see why it should bother anyone.

  - There are many distributions that are not based on Red Hat at
    all. Don't be fooled by some superficial resemblances (eg SuSE uses
    rpms, but in fact grew out of a distro called SLS and has nothing in
    common with Red Hat except that they share technology: Red Hat use
    SuSEs video and kernel development and SuSE use Red Hat's packaging
    and kernel development, just the way you'd expect with free software.)
    Debian has very large momentum, but hasn't got a marketing department.
    Is Debian the biggest distribution worldwide? Possibly, but its hard
    to measure.

  - There are fewer, but still many, distributions that are based
    on Red Hat. Some of these still track RH, some have diverged
    completely. Mandrake walks a tightrope between the two; they have
    made big investments in their own tools but preserve RH 
    compatibility. Hopefully <A HREF="http://www.freestandards.org">http://www.freestandards.org</A> will make this
    a non-issue soon.

Maybe it would help to realise that about 95% of the code in each of the
major distributions is exactly the same. Distributions differ in the way
they configure and install that 95%, and in the software they write that
is the other 5%.

Questions of which has the best hardware support are irrelevant. Questions
about which has the best ISV support are relevant, but it is increasingly
less common to find a company with a product that it only certifies on one
Linux distribution.
