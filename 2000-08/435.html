Many thanks for responding, Richard! I have attached a copy of our smb.conf
file so that you can get a better idea of our system settings.

I have the book "SAMS Teach Yourself Samba in 24 Hours", and have found it to
be very useful as we've been setting up our Samba server.  I am glad to have
reached you - I'd think you're just the person to indicate whether or not
password aging is possible with Samba.

Responding to your question "what happens when the Windows NT password
expires", I do not have first-hand knowledge of whether a password expiration
on NT will initiate a dialogue to change the password when a Win9x client logs
in, but have been told that NT will.  If this assumption is incorrect, that
would certainly explain why the Linux/Samba combo is also unable to force a
password change!  I would again be surprised, though - why would Microsoft put
a password expiration variable in NT user accounts and not bother to support it
for Win9x clients?  This would be inconsistent with their Zero Administration
Initiative.  (On second thought, maybe that wouldn't surprise me...)

Since I originally asked my question, I have gone back to thoroughly test
password synchronization on our server, and noticed a problem.  Changing the
Windows password from the Win9x client changes the smbpasswd file properly;
however, the Unix password is not updated, even though I have unix password
sync = yes.  Do you see anything in our smb.conf file that explains this?  Is
this why the expiration of a Unix password on our server doesn't prompt a Win9x
client to change their password?

In the SAMS book, PAM is discussed as a method to let the Unix password changes
sync the Unix passwd with smbpasswd.  Would using PAM also help in initiating a
"change password" dialogue when the Unix password expires?

Now I'm back to the original question (that I'm afraid I already know the
answer to):  Does Samba actually support initiating a "change password"
dialogue for a Win9x client at logon if the Unix password has expired?

I appreciate your help, and look forward to hearing from you again.

&gt; &gt;I am struggling with a password expiration problem, and am hoping to
&gt; &gt;find someone that can assist me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have a Red Hat 6.0 server running Samba 2.0.6.   This server is
&gt; &gt;configured as both a Primary Domain Controller and a WINS server.  All
&gt; &gt;other machines on our network are Win9x clients.  The Samba security
&gt; &gt;option is set to Domain, and password caching has been turned off for
&gt; &gt;the Windows clients.  Samba and Linux passwords are synchronized.
&gt;
&gt; Are you sure that you have set up your machine as a PDC? Are you using
&gt; encrypted passwords?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;My problem is that the Windows login will not require the user to change
&gt; &gt;their password when the Linux password has expired.  The Windows user
&gt; &gt;will be able to continue using the same password forever to log into the
&gt; &gt;Samba server as long as they don't ever again login "directly" to Linux
&gt; &gt;(only then would they be forced to change their password.)
&gt;
&gt; OK, sounds like you are using encrypted passwords.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I have been unable to locate any documentation on how to resolve this.
&gt; &gt;Is this one of the NT Primary Domain Controller features that they
&gt; &gt;haven't yet figured out how to emulate on Samba?  Or is there something
&gt; &gt;simple I'm missing?  I have a hard time imagining that Samba can't
&gt; &gt;emulate an NT server for this purpose.
&gt;
&gt; If you are using Windows 9X clients against a Windows NT server, do you
&gt; know what happens when their Windows NT password expires?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I appreciate any insight anyone has to offer.
&gt;
&gt; Have you tried Samba-technical?
