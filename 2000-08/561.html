&gt; It is basic marketing - the client base is there, Linux users probably have on 
&gt; average high incomes and the willingness to literally throw money at anything to 
&gt; do with Linux (such as a good ISP, quality Linux friendly hardware, support, 
&gt; etc).

I came across a similar point with cable internet providers here in
Calgary. They offer the standard rate (all you can eat[1] for $40/month)
and they have other plans available. The first plan to offer static IPs
is the professional plan which comes in at $120/month, with the same
data rate. You can purchase extra IPs at $15 each/month.

The main differences between standard and professional (apart from
staticness) is the number of email address and the amount of web space
you have. (and obvioulsy the amount charged which takes into account the
fact that you'll be a higher bandwitdh customer)


I said I'd be happy to by the standard plan, plus the $15/month to get a
statuc IP. nope - they're not interested. they said "if you run any
server at all, you must use the professional plan".

I argued that the amount of data I would be *generating* (which is what
they really care about[2][3]) would be less than the average napster
user, or any other user who has set up a mp3 sahring website. 

no response.

I have since dropped them as a possibility and have gone to considering
an ADSL provider. They stupidly lost a customer.

Civilization?  Gandhi: I think it would be a good idea.

[1] its actaully limited to x gigs a month, which you would have to work
at
[2] they dont care about the guy next door watch live video streams, or
live radio streams, or scouring the net for MP3s or using web-phone
technology
[3] some ISPs only *count* the incoming, and reason that you will always
down more than you up.
