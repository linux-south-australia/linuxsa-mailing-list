Hello

Just a follow-up question pertaining to last weeks discussion of cabling
legislation.

Where LAN cabling for a SOHO must be done for a licensed person if that
LAN is connected to the telephone lines

- does the LAN end at the modem that is the connection?
- does the line from the modem to a connector in a wall have to be
installed by a qualified person if it is *permanently* attached?

Also a question regarding stapling?

All of the telephone lines in my house (UTP) have been stapled into the
wall by a Telstra technician. Will this degrade the signal travelling
through those lines? Or is this only a probem for Coaxial LAN cables? I
would have thought it would be the other way round, since Coaxial cable
is more impervious to interference and crosstalk.

Enlighten me.

Michael.
