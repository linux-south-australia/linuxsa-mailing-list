He'd actually prefer you buy him a couple of RF PCMCIA cards I think :-)

&gt; I won't, I once tried StarOffice :o(
&gt; Waste of time. My commputer worked faster before, it could be the
&gt; /home/users directories that are becoming stuffed up with things that
&gt; might cause it to appear slowing down?

Nope.  That shouldn't slow down the computer.  Basically don't run what you
don't need, and don't leave software running that you've finished with. 
Minimising a window still leaves the software running!  'top' can become your
good friend!  (just don't go about killing processes owned by root, ok?)

&gt; &gt; The other thing, turn off services you don't need.  Try running "ntsysv" as
root
&gt; &gt; and turning off various daemons that you're not using.  Pesky nfsd's,
smbd's,
&gt; &gt; httpd's and the like can all go.  Read the manual first before turning
&gt; &gt; *everything* off :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I think I know what you are reffering to here, it must be the "text mode
&gt; tool" which allows you to select what to be started at boot time.

That's the one.  Nice and easy to use.
