No, it's worse than that; it does things "differently".  So
when your sendmail.cf file suddenly gets blown away, and you
don't realise it until you get a lovely message in your
mailbox from ORBS saying you've been blacklisted for being
an open relay, remember that you eshewed functionality over
convenience.

&gt; Does anyone know of any instabilities with RH6.2?

I've just deployed a RH6.2 box (a little faster than I would
have liked) that is taking a hammering.  Apart from an issue
with the onboard Pro 100+ NIC (which using Intel's own drivers
seems to have fixed, or at least they're suppressing the error
messages I was getting before), the thing is still up.  In 8
hours, it's done ~26000000 packets for both Rx & Tx, according
to ifconfig.  Time will tell.
