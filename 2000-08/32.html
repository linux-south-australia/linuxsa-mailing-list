Here's what I can tell you about the CDs (which isn't that much, I'm more
into the software that goes on them).

  - The original idea was one of two Linuxcare employees, Duncan McKinnon
    and Dave Mandala. I've no idea which. It really is very successful.
    Nobody sells it to my knowledge although there's no reason why they
    couldn't, since the iso is available on the Linuxcare web site.

  - Linuxcare scoured the world and now use the best quality manufacturer
    of these things that they can find, in Switzerland. The best kind are
    pressed, not laser cut. They aren't the cheapest but they have a much
    lower defect rate and very much higher chance of working with any old
    CD.

  - They make some very strange noises in some drives, but I've never
    heard of anything like damage. I know a lot of people that use them,
    would you believe, and there's never been a report yet. There have
    been intensive in-house testing sessions as well. There is a whole
    community and mailing list building and testing these things (although
    I don't know how many of them run on cut-down media.)

  - There are quite a number of companies in Australia (maybe as many as
    5) that produce cut-down CDs. All of them use laser cutting as far as 
    I know. One of them has developed software that maps a desired shape 
    onto what is possible given the physics involved. That usually means 
    that with a little creativity you can make a custom CD to just about
    any shape you like. The software helps balance it out and modify
    the design somewhat. I've seen a map of Australia and a koala.
