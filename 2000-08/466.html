Hi All,
    A friend of mine asked me to help set up a Telstra
Dial-up Network "Just like yours..." and like a sucker I
agreed. At present there is a RH6.2 box connected to Telstra
as a Server/Router that talks to the world quite nicely
(pings, surfs etc.) and also talks to the rest of the
network (Windoze Boxen) through a hub (pings etc). The
problem is that the boxes on the network all talk to the
Server, but I cannot get through the server to the outside
world, I cannot even ping the Telstra router. The server is
configured so that default route is there, and also
configured as a gateway linked to the router. All of the
Windoze boxen are configured so that the Server is the
gateway to the world, and DNS is handled by the Server and
Telstra. Now I have looked at linuxconf and the config files
heaps of times, and as far as I can tell everything is set
correctly "just like mine" but it still doesn't work. Now I
know this is a simple problem, and I will probably kick
myself when I work it out, but can someone give me some
clues as to where to start looking to fix this. All of the
routing config files look O.K., and the route command gives
the server and the router and the appropriate interfaces.
    Thanks,
        Andrew.
