Just to say right up front; this is an incredibly bad idea.

&gt; Now for my questions.
&gt; 1) If we make this change,  will this stop slow typists using telnet to
&gt; send mail through our mail server?

Yes, and any slow hosts delivering email to you.  yahoo.com used to
(still do?) this.  At one of the ISPs I look after, they continually
have problems sending email to them because the sessions timed out
before they could start/finish transfering their email over their
beleagued link.  You would be creating a similar situation, with no
matter what timeouts you set that you think will stop "slow typists".

Besides, how long before the students write a program to do what they
want, in order to circumvent your new limits?

&gt; I realise there is only so much you can do, but if we can make it that
&gt; little bit harder ....

This is partly a policy issue.  Firstly, you (generic you) should be
coming down hard on the individuals concerned; this sort of thing is
not to be tolerated.  Perhaps removing email privileges for all
students, clearly stipulating who was responsible for the loss of
email (this appeals to the bastard in me).  Secondly, maybe you
should investigate using SMTP AUTH for internal email (but that may
severely limit you to which email clients you can use).

  Daryl Tester
