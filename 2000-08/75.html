I am trying to set up a little print server
with samba without success.
The server has an IP 192.168.0.71 and the
machine I wish to print from 192.168.0.70(this one)

I can telnet into the printserver and echo "blah blah" &gt; /dev/lp0
and it prints fine, I have set up the printer with RedHat printtool
on this machine but cannot get it to print. below is my smb.conf
I am sure something is amiss here but I cannot see it.
Sorry about the length of the post

Kind regards
Kevin



; The global setting for a RedHat default install
; smbd re-reads this file regularly, but if in doubt stop and restart
it:
; /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb stop
; /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb start
;======================= Global Settings
=====================================
[global]

; workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name, eg: REDHAT4
   workgroup = OCEANIA 

; comment is the equivalent of the NT Description field
   comment = RedHat Samba Server

; volume = used to emulate a CDRom label (can be set on a per share
basis)
   volume = RedHat4

; printing = BSD or SYSV or AIX, etc.
   printing = bsd
   printcap name = /etc/printcap
   load printers = yes

; Uncomment this if you want a guest account
;  guest account = pcguest
   log file = /var/log/samba-log.%m
; Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb)
   max log size = 50

; Options for handling file name case sensitivity and / or preservation
; Case Sensitivity breaks many WfW and Win95 apps
;   case sensitive = yes
    short preserve case = yes
    preserve case = yes

; Security and file integrity related options
   lock directory = /var/lock/samba
   locking = yes
   strict locking = yes
;   fake oplocks = yes
   share modes = yes
; Security modes: USER uses Unix username/passwd, SHARE uses WfW type
passwords
;        SERVER uses a Windows NT Server to provide authentication
services
   security = user
; Use password server option only with security = server
;   password server = &lt;NT-Server-Name&gt;

; Configuration Options ***** Watch location in smb.conf for
side-effects *****
; Where %m is any SMBName (machine name, or computer name) for which a
custom
; configuration is desired
;   include = /etc/smb.conf.%m

; Performance Related Options
; Before setting socket options read the smb.conf man page!!
   socket options = TCP_NODELAY 
; Socket Address is used to specify which socket Samba
; will listen on (good for aliased systems)
;   socket address = aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
; Use keep alive only if really needed!!!!
;   keep alive = 60

; Domain Control Options
; OS Level gives Samba the power to rule the roost. Windows NT = 32
;       Any value &lt; 32 means NT wins as Master Browser, &gt; 32 Samba gets
it
;   os level = 33
; specifies Samba to be the Domain Master Browser
;   domain master = yes 
; Use with care only if you have an NT server on your network that has
been
; configured at install time to be a primary domain controller.
;   domain controller = &lt;NT-Domain-Controller-SMBName&gt;
; Domain logon control can be a good thing! See [netlogon] share section
below!
;   domain logons = yes
; run a specific logon batch file per workstation (machine)
;   logon script = %m.bat
; run a specific logon batch file per username
;   logon script = %u.bat
; Windows Internet Name Serving Support Section
; WINS Support - Tells the NMBD component of Samba to enable it's WINS
Server
;       the default is NO.
;   wins support = yes
; WINS Server - Tells the NMBD components of Samba to be a WINS Client
;       Note: Samba can be either a WINS Server, or a WINS Client, but
NOT both
;   wins server = w.x.y.z
; WINS Proxy - Tells Samba to answer name resolution queries on behalf
of a non
;       WINS Client capable client, for this to work there must be at
least one
;       WINS Server on the network. The default is NO.
;   wins proxy = yes

; a service which has a different directory for each machine that
connects
; this allows you to tailor configurations to incoming machines. You
could
; also use the %u option to tailor it by user name.
; The %m gets replaced with the machine name that is connecting.
;[pchome]

;  path = /usr/pc/%m
;  public = no
;  writeable = yes
;
;
; A publicly accessible directory, read/write to all users. Note that
all files
; created in the directory by users will be owned by the default user,
so
; any user with access can delete any other user's files. Obviously this
; directory must be writable by the default user. Another user could of
course
; be specified, in which case all files would be owned by that user
instead.
;[public]
;   path = /usr/somewhere/else/public
;   public = yes
;   only guest = yes
;   writable = yes
;   printable = no
;
;
; The following two entries demonstrate how to share a directory so that
two
; users can place files there that will be owned by the specific users.
In this
; setup, the directory should be writable by both users and should have
the
; sticky bit set on it to prevent abuse. Obviously this could be
extended to
; as many users as required.
