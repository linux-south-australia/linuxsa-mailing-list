&gt; Hello.

Howdy-doo.

&gt; I'm having problems with my Manduck 6.0 server.
&gt; I tried deleting a file (approx. 50MB) from the root
&gt; partition when it had become quite full but the space
&gt; was not freed up. df -k still showed the root filesystem
&gt; as being nearly full.
&gt; 
&gt; I managed to get the space back only by doing a reboot.
&gt; 
&gt; What's happening?

I normally leave these easy questions to others (and I can't
answer the difficult ones anyway), but it's after midnight.
So...

Unix is wierd.
The OS keeps track of how many users are using a file and
won't let the file really, really be deleted until
everyone's finished with it.

In your case, someone was still using the file.

One of the magic secrets of linux, which I have now memorized
as of a few days agao (when I couldn't get my /cdrom
to unmount) is that the magic command "fuser" will tell you
which process is still using your file.

See "man fuser".
If this command is not on your system, then you may be using
a differently abled OS.

Righteo...
