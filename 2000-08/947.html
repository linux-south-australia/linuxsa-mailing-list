We have different man pages.

NAME
       badblocks - search a device for bad blocks

SYNOPSIS
       badblocks [ -b block-size ] [ -o output_file ] [ -s ] [ -v
       ] [ -w ] device blocks-count [ start-block ]

DESCRIPTION
       badblocks is used to search for bad  blocks  on  a  device
       (usually a disk partition).
       device  is  the  special  file corresponding to the device
       (e.g /dev/hdXX).
       blocks-count is the number of blocks on the device.

&lt;half a man page snipped out&gt;

E2fsprogs version 1.14     January 1999   



Mine seems to indicate to me that it does find badblocks.

I might even go so far as to question how the badblocks program your man
page  refers to can list badblocks without being able to find them?

But I don't really want people interpretations of man pages, I would
really like the comments of peopel who *know* ie have either contirbuted
(or at least read the source a lot and understand disks and fielsystems)
or have some good experiencve using the program and have foiund out one
way or another if  it works as advertised.

Eg if they had a known bad disk and it found the errors or not.
Or if they had a known good disk and it erroneously reported errors.

Out of curiosity, which distribution are you using and or how old is
that man page?

&gt; According to the man pages badblocks doesn't find badblocks, but does

&gt; NAME
&gt; 
&gt;      badblocks - put a list of bad blocks in a file
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; SYNOPSIS
&gt; 
&gt;      badblocks block_special [block] ...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; EXAMPLES
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      badblocks /dev/hd1
&gt;                          # Handle bad blocks on /dev/hd1
&gt; 
&gt;      badblocks /dev/hd3 310 570 1680
&gt;                          # Three bad blocks on /dev/hd3
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; DESCRIPTION
&gt; 
&gt;      If a device contains bad sectors,  it  is  important  to  not 
&gt; have  them
&gt;      allocated  to important files.  This program makes it possible to
&gt; collect
&gt;      up to 7 bad blocks into a dummy file, so they will not be allocated
&gt; for a
&gt;      'real'  file.  When  the  program  starts  up,  it asks for a list
&gt; of bad
&gt;      blocks, unless they are provided as arguments.  Then it  creates 
&gt; a  file
&gt;      whose name is of the form .Bad_xxxxx, where xxxxx is a pid.

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Can anyone confirm my belief that the badblocks command actually checks
&gt; &gt; the physical disk media for bad blocks?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I assume it does but would like confirmationfrom someone who actually
&gt; &gt; *KNOWS*.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also does any one have any experience as to how reliable the badblocks
&gt; &gt; program is?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am sort of curious as I ran the badblocks program over a disk one day
&gt; &gt; and came up with no badblocks.
&gt; &gt; The next day I ran it and came up with 100000+ bad blocks, which sort of
&gt; &gt; seemed weird since the disk had been sitting in an office environment and
&gt; &gt; was brand new and had only had a very light use for about 4 days.
&gt; &gt;
