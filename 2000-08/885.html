Hi Evan,

Thanks for replying!
 
&gt; Nick: I am pretty sure you can get EDO ram currently. If not new then you
&gt; may want to try that place on Henley Bch road in Torrensville (Second Byte)
&gt; they may have something.

Second Byte sounds good, there we go, there is some place I was hoping
for.
 
&gt; I would hazard a guess you current system sounds ok performance wise. P-Pro
&gt; 200 should be ok yeah it aint p3-900 or something but hey ppl are running
&gt; Linux on socket5/socket7 motherboards with p-150 to p233-mmx etc.
&gt; and PPRO outdoes this easily performance wise.

Evan, my computer isn't the fastest, you right, but as you mentioned it
should do the job. Whatever the reason is just became slower, but I
couldn't dream what causes it.
 
&gt; You haven't specified your current disk at all?

There are two HDD's in my comp. One is a 2GB WD and the other is 1.5GB
WD. I am currently using the 2GB for Linux RH 6.2 and also about half of
the 1.5GB.
 
&gt; I have found bad/slow disks to be the root of most performance evils. Some
&gt; friends have asked me for some HD advice and I lean towards a drive with a
&gt; 7200 rpm the speed is noticeable even if a tad more expensive than the 5400
&gt; rpm of same size. (eg 20 gb 5400 = 200 , 20 gb 7200 = 300 approx) You may
&gt; need to tradeoff size for speed.

I thought of a HDD of about 15GB. It can very well be a 7200. I'm
looking into this small upgrade and appreciate your help.

&gt; You can also upgrade ur video card to a 4mb there prol is 2 free plug in
&gt; slots to take u there I did this and video performance did improve (it
&gt; allowed higher res etc). Last I heard the ram to do so cost about 30 $'s
&gt; from Interactive OLE but I'm sure most PC shops stock it.

Video was just another thought, my main concern is to speed things up a
bit and also gain some disk space.
 
&gt; Depending on you motherboard layout ie number of ram slots etc you may find
&gt; getting to 64 from 48 may not be cheap
&gt; eg if u have 4 slots 2x16 mb and 2x8 mb u have to lose the last 2x8 and
&gt; replace it with another 2x16

Your example is right. 2x16 and 2x8.

 
&gt; These points are just food for thought I understand the wife's budget
&gt; restrictions :)

Shh... Not so loud! You aren't married, it don't look by the above
statement.
 
&gt; Good luck

Thank you, I need it.
&gt;
