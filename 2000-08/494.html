I've just had a chance to play around with this some more. Text only
consoles work with my setup fine and if I set the --nologin option in
the Gnome-terminal prefs they now work fine too (I was having a lot of
problems after Netscape broke X authorisation quite badly [fixed now
after reboot] and I couldn't shutdown as I had long and important
processes running - after working for years on Macs and PC I've gotta
say that it's nice to be abvkle to crash a machine and have it still
continue to do the things you've asked it to even though crippled).

About the presence of a .login file, I would have it shouldn't really
make a difference (though I could easily change it's name) since both
.bashrc and .bash_profile exist.

The bit about fortune coming up at odd times (which is where all this
started for me) is absolutely true; everytime I lessed a file before I
put fortune into the .login file (it was origially in .bashrc with
BASH_ENV set to ~/.bashrc) I'd get a fortune - sort of a zen/IChing kind
of way to analyse files I guess.

thanks for your help

&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm having problems getting my .bash_profile to run properly. Here
&gt; &gt; is what I have:
&gt; 
&gt; I think you have a subtle problem of timing here.  Namely, in
&gt; "~/.bash_profile" you source "~/.login" before you actually export the
&gt; variables.  Why not use
&gt; 
&gt;         export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
&gt;         export BASH_ENV=$HOME/.bashrc
&gt;         export USERNAME="dkortsch"
&gt; 
&gt; so that the variables are exported at the same time as being changed.
&gt; 
&gt; On another point, why do you have a login file and a profile file?
&gt; This could be causing problems in scripts that search for a profile or
&gt; a login file, i.e., they might use only one of the files.  Read the
&gt; section on "INVOCATION" in the bash manpage.  It suggests that they
&gt; are alternatives.  It reads:
&gt; 
&gt;        Login shells:
&gt;          On login (subject to the -noprofile option):
&gt;                if /etc/profile exists, source it.
&gt; 
&gt;                if ~/.bash_profile exists, source it,
&gt;                  else if ~/.bash_login exists, source it,
&gt;                    else if ~/.profile exists, source it.
&gt; 
&gt;          On exit:
&gt;                if ~/.bash_logout exists, source it.
&gt; 
&gt; And just to be super painfully pedantic ;-), there is a subtle problem
&gt; with "~/.bashrc" in general.  Is it a feature, or a bug in the shell?
&gt; Again from the bash manpage section on invocation:
&gt; 
&gt;        Non-login interactive shells:
&gt;          On startup (subject to the -norc and -rcfile options):
&gt;                if ~/.bashrc exists, source it.
&gt; 
&gt;        Non-interactive shells:
&gt;          On startup:
&gt;                if the environment variable ENV is non-null, expand
&gt;                it and source the file it names, as if the command
&gt;                        if [ "$ENV" ]; then . $ENV; fi
&gt;                had been executed, but do not use PATH to search
&gt;                for the pathname.  When not started in Posix mode, bash
&gt;                looks for BASH_ENV before ENV.
&gt; 
&gt; From this it seems the practice of sourcing the files "~/.bashrc" in
&gt; the profile files is a widespread mistake.  It means that
&gt; non-interactive shells will still source these resource files, where
&gt; they should only do so if "$ENV" or "$BASH_ENV" point to them.  This
&gt; is a particular pain where you are doing the trick of running
&gt; "fortune" to greet the user.  You will find that it often shows up in
&gt; weird subprocesses.  For example, when compiling under emacs.  This
&gt; scares me a little, it could easily confuse a script parsing the
&gt; output.
&gt; 
&gt; My solution: don't set "ENV", but make the profile explicitly read
&gt; "~/.bashrc" when it is an interactive login shell.  At the end of
&gt; "~/.bash_profile" I have:
&gt; 
&gt; # Get aliases and functions.
&gt; #
&gt; # This is a strange peculiarity of the shell.  During a login shell
&gt; # the resources are never read, even if the shell is interactive.
&gt; # Therefore we test whether the PS1 variable is set to determine if
&gt; # the shell is an interactive login shell --- not an uncommon
&gt; # occurrence ;-).
&gt; 
&gt; if [ "${PS1:-NONE}" != "NONE" ] ; then
&gt;     if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
&gt;         . ~/.bashrc
&gt;     elif [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
&gt;         . /etc/bashrc
&gt;     fi
&gt; fi
&gt; 
&gt; and then at the end of "~/.bashrc" I have
&gt; 
&gt; # Say Hello.
&gt; #
&gt; # In theory, this script is only called in interactive shells so we
&gt; # might as well greet the user.  However, note that some evil login
&gt; # scripts set ENV to the location of this file --- a barbarous act
&gt; # which causes this file to be read in non-interactive shells ;-).
&gt; 
&gt; if type -path fortune &&gt; /dev/null ; then
&gt;     fortune
&gt; fi
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Andrew
