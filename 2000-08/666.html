Hi gurus,

I followed the advice of Michael Neuling and Mat Tippett and entered the
commands  and also the info in fstab. I have a swap space of 128MB as
/tmp/swapfile. The original one /dev/hdb6 from fstab, is missing though.
In the process of increasing the swap space, I stuffed up and lost the
original swap space /dev/hdb6. Trying to claim it with: "swapon
/dev/hdb6" I get the error message /dev/hdb6 invalid argument. My
intention of swap space was 128MB, but now there is a 64MB of swap space
on /dev/hdb6 shown on fdisk -p, which I cannot use. Could you guys help
me to reclaim those 64MB?
Michael uses /tmp/swapfile as an example, Matt is going further to add
the following line to /etc/fstab:
/dev/sda       swap       swap     pri=0   0  0
/tmp/swap      swap       swap     pri=0   0  0
Now these don't match!  /tmp/swapfile and /tmp/swap are two different
things.
If you have /tmp/swapfile you need to have /tmp/swapfile in fstab!
This is not a complain, Matt helped me heaps since my first install with
RH 5.0 about one and a half year ago, perhaps a bit more. Also with al
was needed to connect to the Net. There was Geoffrey as well, someone I
read about in one the computer magazines, not long ago and I don't
recall anyone mention it!
Please, one little help is needed from you gurus, how can I reclaim 64MB
of swap space (/dev/hdb6) which is not used anymore?
I had great problems with the speed of my computer and I got to the
conclusion that it was caused from lack of swap space ( it caused the
processor run cold )
Another young man with great capabilities is Benjamin Close! Very busy,
yet modest and kind, he's there for you, when you least expect it!
OK gurus, enough for now from me! Let's see your professional advice
which of course will be greatly appreciate it!

Best wishes,

Nick.
