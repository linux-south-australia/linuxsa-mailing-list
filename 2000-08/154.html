&gt; hmmm, this is true. I guess I am modifying the existing array, but the

This is just extreme guess work on my part, but the state of the program
is obviously being stored somewhere for you to be getting a difference
between CC/TO and TO/CC, and as you've used mostly local variables in
get_header() ...

&gt; Ah, once again, I'm pointed to the holy RFC. Is it just me, or are they
&gt; hard to read?

It's just you  :-P.  It's just like timing diagrams for ICs; all
ASCII Greek until you get the hang of them.  But like Glen Turner
said, it's harder to beat someone over the head with an RFC than
with an ITU (nee CCITT) spec., so you should be thankful they are
the lightweights that they are.

&gt; of course. Hopefully you're like the Canadian government who deducted
&gt; -$200  from my last paycheck. ?? Gotta love it when you net more that
&gt; you gross.... Pitty it wont be like this all the time :)

You can run, GST-refugee boy, but you can't hide.  Sooner or later,
you're going to have to step foot back in this country and listen to
the sound of John Howard slapping on the latex gloves.  :-)

Apparently, these are people too.
