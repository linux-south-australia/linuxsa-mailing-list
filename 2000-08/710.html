Ok here's another one which is a bit tougher....  Last night I made some changes
to my linux partitions using partition magic and of course I should have changed
lilo config before I made the changes but I didn't :-)  What I have done is
change my original config from...

swap=/dev/hdb1,    /boot = /dev/hdb?,    /root=/dev/hdb5,   /usr = /dev/hdb6,
/var = /dev/hdb7,    /home = /dev/hdb8

which gave me problems due to the swap being the first partition and the boot
partition being the second (Also I seem to get conflicting advice on whether
linux partitions should be primary or logical).

changes I made were

/boot = /dev/hdb1, swap = /dev/hdb5,    /root = /dev/hdb6,   /usr = /dev/hdb7,
/var = /dev/hdb8,    /home = /dev/hdb9

Of course now my system still boots up ok until it trys to mount the /root and
other partitions.  then I get a prompt.  I have found that I can manually map
the /root /var /home and /usr partitions but cannot mount the /boot partition
due to an error.  I guess this is where I need a rescue disk? I have tried to
edit lilo.conf but it wont allow me to save the file (no swap file found- which
I fixed by using swapdev /dev/hdb5) as it cannot find vmlinuz on the /boot
partition as it is not mounted.

any thoughts? or is this a reinstall job?
