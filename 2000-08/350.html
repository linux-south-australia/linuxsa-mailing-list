I'm not sure I follow, I thought the the packed from a machine needing to use the
IP BOX was assigned a new source port number and then given a new IP address in
the packet header. (saving the originals for later use) It then sends the modified
packet over the NET and and wait for response?

When the packed comes back the port number is identified as one that has been
assigned it will replace the originals back in the header and pass then on to the
originating BOX.  Viola the host that sent the packet knows no difference and as
far as the NET is concerned it is dealing with a unique ID every time all the
time?


Please correct me if I have gone astray

&gt; &gt;  &gt; I have used ip masquerading (ipchains 2.2.x) and now NAT (iptables 2.4.0)
&gt; &gt;  &gt; with my modem dialup ISP connection and games have always worked.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; That includes UT, Quake, Quake2, Halflife, Starcraft, Rouge Spear. All
&gt; &gt;  &gt; worked first time with no special masq/NAT or ip forwarding
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ok, now for extra value marks, try to get two clients on the same NAT'ted
&gt; &gt; LAN talking to the same games server at the same time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Beginning to see the point now?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     - mark
&gt;
&gt; ok, so my understanding of NAT just flew out the window. I thought NAT
&gt; was the process of "wrapping" the internal packet with another that had
&gt; a real world IP.
&gt;
&gt; Are you saying that NAT simply marks the packet with a single bit
&gt; change? If you're suggesting that only one NAT client can play at a
&gt; time, I'm I right?

&gt; The trouble with doing something right the first time is that nobody
&gt; appreciates how difficult it was.
