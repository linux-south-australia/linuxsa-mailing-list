&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows ME now has Blue screen ( with options !!!)

&gt; ME stands for Millenium Edition which is not released in Australia yet and 
&gt; is basically Win 2000 w/o NT

I think it is anything but this. The ME I have heard about (plenty of
people in Adelaide seem to have seen it, but I haven't) is the latest
version of the 16-bit Windows 9x core. They've tried hard to get rid of
DOS. It is supposed to be much more stable, and be the last thing before
it is Windows 2000 everywhere.

This is the OS that was declared dead by Microsoft at least twice. Windows
98 was never going to happen, then Windows 98 SE was the final end of the
line, and now this. 

Look through backissues of www.theregister.co.uk, they seem to have
covered it reasonably well as I recall.
