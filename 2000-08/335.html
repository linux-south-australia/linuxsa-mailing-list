&gt; Gurus,

No, just a wannabe.

&gt; I have 2 GB file on unix/linux. I want to take back up (or replicate) of
&gt; this file as soon as there is any change in this file.

As soon as, or at a predetermined time? (ie, backup time).

&gt; If we use incremental back up, it will take bake up of all 2 GB file size
&gt; for a single word change.

OK, to find changes, you're going to need something to compare it _to_.
That means you're going to need a replica of the file anyway.  An option
would be to get the application (if you can modify that) to write a
transaction log of file changes, and back that up instead.  Then,
periodically apply those changes to the main file.  Coincidently, this
is what Zope's ZODB does (except that the transactions are part of the
main database file, so you end up backing up the lot anyway).  If you
can't get to the application source, a solution might be to get to the
application's binary; if it's dynamically linked, you can intercept its
calls to open(), lseek(), write(), etc. and determine your data delta
(:-)) from that.

&gt; Q2 :- What are the products (commercial and non-commercial like unix
&gt; utilities) support back up of Open files (application) ???

Many (in either camp).  tar, dump and cpio are commonly used backup
utilities that ship with standard Unices.

&gt; I hope, i didn't ask a tough question.

You certainly asked enough mailing lists.  (followup trimmed back).
