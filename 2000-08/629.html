THIS IS A PREMIER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR COMPANY TO EXHIBIT AND SHOWCASE YOUR LINUX

... new sponsors to be announced.

Purpose of Conference:

Twenty-six percent (26%) of federal installations have reported use of the Linux 
operating system in their organization, as reported by IDC.  IDC also estimates 
that "most of the government's sophisticated, back-office computers will be running 
Linux by 2002."  Just when agencies are turning to enterprise-wide solutions 
and mainframe class applications, the Linux operating system offers a new and 
exciting alternative.

This will be a one-day conference that will present agency plans and strategies 
for deploying new and innovative Linux applications. 

The conference will focus on those Linux applications that are in the early or 
test bed stage AND will likely evolve into enterprise-level deployments.

Who Should Attend:

* Government technical managers
* Agency executives
* Program managers
* Agency e-commerce planners
* Companies with Linux related products and services
* Government executives responsible for enterprise applications
* Military command and control officers

What Attendees Will Learn:

* Where and how Linux is being used
* New plans for enterprise applications
* Innovative ideas and strategies
* New opportunities for Linux products and services
* Agency plans for new and innovative enterprise applications

Recognizing Technical Achievement:

Also at this conference, awards will be presented to those U.S. government organizations 
that have taken a technology leadership role in developing innovative Linux Applications.

Award categories to be considered: 

* Innovative applications
* Enterprise-wide applications
* Military Command and Control
* Electronic Commerce
* Science and Research
* Mobile Office and Portable Applications
* Management and Leadership  

Candidate projects will be submitted to a joint industry-government team for 
evaluation and selection.
The winners will receive recognition at the event, with their agency, and in 
the press.

Members of the evaluation team include:

* INPUT Federal
* Federal Executive Review Panel 
* Mr. Art Chantker, President, The Potomac Forum Ltd., Chair

Please survey your agency and department.  If your organization has one --or 
more -- Linux applications in the early stages of evaluation, planning, test, 
or deployment -- tell us about your project and the team running it.  Initially 
we only need a max of 1 page summary of the project and a point of contact at 
the team so that we can obtain additional information as needed.  Closing date 
for submission of your candidate project teams is 7 September 2000. 

How to submit your project for consideration:

Outline for Candidate Submission
1. Name of project, Department/Agency.  Phone, email and web site contact information 
for Team/Project Leader and team members.
2. Brief description of the project.  Focus on the application, reason for selection 
of Linux.  Status.
3. Potential Impact.  If the project or test is successful, describe the magnitude 
of the deployment and impact on the project and/or government enterprise.
4. Contractor(s) supporting the project (if any) and Point of Contact

The First Annual Federal Users Training Conference will also highlight the new 
and exciting applications that are in place today and are in development. Exhibits, 
demonstrations and presentations will allow federal users to become informed 
of new Linux products and services.  

Agency presentations will focus on projects in the early stages that will provide 
innovative enterprise-level applications.  Leaders will be recognized for their
