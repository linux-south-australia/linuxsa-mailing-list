There is a Matlab version that does run under Linux.
It seems that all the UNIX versions come on the same CD, but you still need a
license key
to run the thing, and if you setup a network license (I don't know how else
to do it)
it's bound to the machine that your running it on.

[It uses a 'flexlm' as the license manager, which makes use of the id of the
host that the
license manager is running on.  Sun machine used to have a fixed hardware id,
which sometimes
corresponded to the ethernet MAC address. Be prepared to give the Matlab
distributers these
details in order to get a license. Email me if you need a contact for them..
their based in Brisbane.]

The 'free beer' program is called Octave.  It understands matlab '.m' scripts
but uses
gnuplot for graphical output.

**Asside: I recently had to add an 600Mb of additional swap space on a linux
machine
so that Engineer could run his Matlab data processing script (Hi John!).  I
was scrimping
disk space from any partition that had some spare, and ended up with 6
additonal swap
files, after going through several iterations of "Is that enough?", "No, it's
down to 25Mb,
can you find any more?"

&gt; &gt; Why not try a search for them in your favourite search engine
&gt; &gt; and see what turns up.
&gt;
&gt; Indeed.  <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A> shows the Matlab manufacturer's
&gt; website as the first hit and two clicks from there shows the
&gt; products listing by platform.  Linux/ia32 is listed, with
&gt; explicit support for the Red Hat and Debian distros.
&gt;
&gt; You might also look at <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">http://www.freshmeat.net/</A> to see if
&gt; there is an acceptable free clone of matlab.
&gt;
&gt; BTW: the Digital UNIX version of matlab is unlikely to run on
&gt;      Linux/ia32.  DEC UNIX workstations don't use Intel processors.
&gt;      Programs written for Linux/Alpha will generally run on DU/Alpha,
&gt;      but not vice-versa.
