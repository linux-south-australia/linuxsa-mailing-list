They will check.

Anyway, you only get one IP address, which means the only realistic way
of connecting up multiple computers is via NAT, and if you're using NAT
games won't work anyway.  You lose either way.

 &gt; I think waiting for another provider to provide DSL would
 &gt; kill me, knowing at least one provider (in this case Telstra) already gives
 &gt; access.

Telstra aren't the exclusive provider;  They just waited until after 
they'd released their retail prices before they provided their competitors
with wholesale pricing plans, and their competitors have then been forced
to spend even more time thinking about how it's possible to make money 
reselling a Telstra service where the wholesale cost is /more expensive/
than the retail cost.  The ACCC will sort it out sooner or later, I'm 
sure -- Telstra's competitors are certainly piling on the pressure, and
it's only a matter of time.

[ example discussion point:  Given that you can rent a copper pair to
  your house for a retail price of $11.65 + GST per month (i.e.: your
  phone line), can anyone come up with a realistic reason to justify
  the fact that Telstra's wholesale price for ULL access to that exact,
  same copper pair for their competitors is in the region of between
  $40 per month and $90 per month?  And that's *without* the DSLAM and
  cable modem equipment, and *without* the 8 Mbps - 100 Mbps tail circuit
  an ISP will need from their premises to each Telephone exchange to 
  provide ADSL services on a competitive basis... ]

Optus is spending serious dollars on ridiculously expensive QCs to 
build a federal court case against Telstra under the Trade Practices
Act on this exact point.  The ACCC may well be forced to issue a 
Competition Notice (which says, "Stop your anti-competitive practices
or we'll levy a $10 million fine per day until you give-in") to address
the matter as well.

Other things you may be interested in considering regarding ADSL include
the fact that even if you're interested in paying the Telstra price for
a buy-in to the Telstra monopoly, you probably won't be able to get 
Telstra ADSL anyway.  The ADSL section on their web site lists the 
telephone exchanges in South Australia which they're planning on equipping
with DSLAMs;  There are only about 10 of them.  And you'll only be able
to make use of them if you're within 3km of copper of the exchange, and
even then only if your link to the exchange is via copper, rather than
via a fibre RIM in a pillar at the end of your street. 

 &gt; Meanwhile, what happened to cable? Doesn't anyone provide cable in
 &gt; Adelaide?

Cable is not a realistic alternative;  it was never wholly realistic
in the first place.  Its marketplace position will ultimately be doomed,
because (a) it's technically inferior, and (b) Telstra, the major 
provider of cable internet access, is now interested in ADSL instead.

Cable has never been provided West of Melbourne or North of Brisbane;
Neither of the cable network providers are the least bit interested 
in doing any business in any place other than the mainland Eastern 
Seaboard.
