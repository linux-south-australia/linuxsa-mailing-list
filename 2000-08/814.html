in regards to the upgrade path ... I don't think you will gain much
advantage in going for a celeron with the hope of upgrading to PIII later
on.

It is purposly designed by chip and motherboar manufactureres so that when
your ready to upgrade, your always gonna have to buy a new board and new
cpu. By this I mean, say you buy a Celeron 500 now with a board that can
handle the PIII Flip Chips say upto 833mhz, the next time your ready to
upgrade, the only chips you will be able to buy will be some other slightly
modified socket format, probably much faster than 833mhz. Even now, I used
to advise people buy a slot 1 BX board when you buy a Celeron, so that if
you want to upgrade later, you can throw in a Slot 1 PIII. Now all those
boards I advised people to buy won't take the new Coppermine PIII cpus which
are both in Slot 1 and PPGA format, and it'd be a real struggle to find an
old PIII chip now brand new. Now I always recommend to people buy the best
value/performance board and chip which your money will get you, and
providing it's not an all in one integraded thing (aka PC-CHIPS) your
upgrade path in the future will probably not be effected all that much.

Heya :)
I setup a AMD K6-2 500 about two weeks ago for my school, with an asus (dont
know the exact model number, I didn't build it) super socket 7 motherboard.
the cpu gained 999 bogomips, which is quite decent indeed.
I have found the machine flies for just about any task.  Not sure about the
celeries though.
However do remember if you buy a Celeron there is an upgrade path you don't
have with the AMD K6-2.  You will need to replace the motherboard as well as
the CPU if you intend to upgrade in the future.  So maybe the "slightly more
expensive Celeron" would be an advantage simply for this reason :)
Anyway, for what you want to do with the computer, the slight difference
between a AMD K6-2 and Celeron cpu isn't going to be noticable IMO.

Hi Dave,

I'm running a K6-2 / 400 and it manages everything fine. On a Celeron the
Front Side Bus is only running at 66Mhz whereas on a K6-2 you can run it at
100 or 133Mhz. This means that the cache on the motherboard is running at
100
or 133 compared to 66Mhz and this can be noticable in performance. Please
don't go for an integrated motherboard because you may one day want to
upgrad
the video card and if you don't have an AGP slot (most integrated don't)
you'll have to search high and low for a decent PCI card.

&gt; Hello,

&gt; I am going to build a new machine to run linux (redhat 6.2 on) in the next
&gt; few weeks. It's just going to be used to run Gnome or KDE and things like
&gt; Samba - Mars NWE and generally working out how to use linux.
&gt;
&gt; My budget would allow me to build a AMD K6-2 500 or a Celeron 500 both
&gt; similarly specced. Would there be a great advantage gained by going for
the
&gt; slightly more expensive Celeron or should I get the K6-2.
