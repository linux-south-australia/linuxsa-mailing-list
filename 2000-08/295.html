&gt; gamer), and even with a 56k modem, it takes forever. ADSL would be great,
&gt; particularly the 512k flat rate plan, but the 'can't connect to a lan' thing
&gt; is REALLY a problem, particularly since I have 3 computers at home that are
&gt; currently connected to the lan.

I reckon the lan thing would be an address/routing  issue, at least
partiially since you dont seem to get a static IP (well static ips it
seems cost extra).

I reckon you could run a NAT/ip masquerading of some sort, whether they
check or not, who knows. If your IP is not static you would need ot
reconfig it everytime your address changed.

I don't know how games would go on NAT.

&gt; 
&gt; So, do they just say this to try to make more money, or do they actually
&gt; check somehow? I think waiting for another provider to provide DSL would
&gt; kill me, knowing at least one provider (in this case Telstra) already gives
&gt; access. Meanwhile, what happened to cable? Doesn't anyone provide cable in
&gt; Adelaide?
&gt; 

No cable in adelaide afaik.

However you can connect other PCs through the conneciton.
It is $11 per PC per month.
The number you can connect depends on your plan.
Or that was my inpretation.
