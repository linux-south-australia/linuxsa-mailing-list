&gt;     Thankyou Daryl - this script was to be found in

&gt; This is it:
&gt;                     ifconfig ppp0 | grep 'inet addr' | awk -F: '{print $2}' |
&gt; awk '{print $1}'
&gt;     - just what I needed.

This may be fine for you, but I had the need for more. I had multiple
pppd starting up to handle dialin calls. Now, in order to get the
ipchains right, I needed to know there IP address (easy, cause I gave it
to them) *and* their interface name - which changes. 

Now, add to this, the fact that I also had 2 outgoing pppd connections
(ppp0 and ppp1) which I needed different ipchains for.

Ok, so now consider this: incoming pppd's can snitch ppp0 or ppp1 (its
possible, and not to improbable)

Basically, I needed to get pppd to talk directly to me, and not rely on
the redhat scripts, cause, consider this:
Dialout connection (ppp0) dies and so is re-started. But lo and behold,
during the time it is down, in incoming pppd snitches ppp0, so it grabs
the next available one - ppp4. 

to bring that interface down, you dont dp ifdown ppp4. you do ifdown
ppp0. Therefore all the ifup-post scripts are bogus, cause they refer to
ppp0, not ppp4.

Ok, so the link comes up, the routing all works (cause its by IP only)
and the ipchains are screwed.
