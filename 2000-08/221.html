I normally think it's bad form to post links to news items,
but....


<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/12449.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/12449.html</A>

This one's too good to pass up.
The article is the most detailed treatment I've seen yet
of how badly MS is doing in China and how well linux is doing.

Most people know already that China has various reasons to
not want MS software, like the price is higher than in the US,
it isn't localised for CHinese enough, some Taiwanese programmers
put anti-PRC slogans in wind95, and the NSA key saga.

But this news item details how various MS and ex-MS people
have said not-so-good things about MS marketing in China.

In summary, it looks quite likely that China will some time soon
declare linux to be the govt official OS, and then the rest of
Asia will feel inclined to follow.
In fact, it's looking very good for linux right now in
China and therefore Asia generally.

And as the marketing drones would say, Australia is
well positioned (or "poised") for opportunities in Asia.


Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  To my mind (such as it is), the best news access point on the
net for linux, by far, is <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/">http://linuxtoday.com/</A> .
It covers everything else.

PPS. Some linux user groups are listed at
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/users/groups/china.html">http://www.linux.org/users/groups/china.html</A>
I can't access any of their web-sites except this one
<A HREF="http://www.linuxhome.org.cn/">http://www.linuxhome.org.cn/</A>
which advertises some very nice gravestones.
Hmmm....
