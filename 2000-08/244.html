Hi Evan,

You would do all us Ethereal users a favour if you enhanced Ethereal
to print the latency and jitter statistics of marked packets, rather
than writing log-scanning package to do this.  In my experience,
on-line real-time analysis is a very useful device for gaining a good
feel for the dynamics of a protocol.  You can then use this knowledge
to target more in-depth formal analysis.

Take this up with me off-line next week if you want: I'm often down
around the CS department.  AARNet is looking at encouraging some
development work on RTP support in Ethereal -- our interest is also
in statistics of packet loss and jitter.

We can also make available our flow statistics.  You can use these
to get the distribution of streaming media rates and durations.

Similarly, our data on voice over IP performance may also be useful.

&gt; ANYONE: Browsing via a cron job: is it possible to run say netscape or
&gt; RealPlayer with the url or RM address as a command line paramater within a
&gt; cron job? are there any gotchyas?

Yes, you may need to associate a display with the job.  See the
DISPLAY environment variable and the "-iconic" flag in "man X".
You may need to run some X authentication to access the display.
If the machine is multiuser, the consle operator may see some icons
mysteriously appearing and disappearing.

Best wishes for your studies,
Glen
