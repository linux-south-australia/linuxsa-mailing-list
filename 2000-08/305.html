list,

sorry, seriously off-topic. I was called out tonight to help a mate who
has a PC that wouldn't boot. Took tomsrtbt and pocket linux floppies
along. He is a Win95 user, a long term project of mine is to get him
over from the dark side.

I managed to determine that he has indeed got problems, a hard drive
failure of tragic proportions. Winblows won't boot at all as on boot it
tries to run scandisk, finds a bad area and dies. Mounted /dev/hda1
under pocket linux, managed to retrieve some of his data, but can't get
his email inbox/outbox due to them being tens of megabytes big and not
having boxes of floppies spare. Running any commands (ls, find, etc etc)
that looks at certain areas of his drive cause failure errors and some
pretty amazing noises as the HD spins down and back up. Sort of
R2D2-ish, with a bit of LSD sprinkled in for good measure. Bzzzt
RRRrrrrr BEEP zzzzzzzzzz rrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRRRRR beep crunch. repeat.

I have advised him to go buy a hard drive. As he is about to leave for
overseas he is looking for a stop-gap for a couple of weeks. Has anyone
recently done an upgrade and have a spare hard disk for sale cheap?
Somewhere around 1 - 1.5 GB would see him right. Must be cheap though.

Ah well, linux at least got him his word processing data back.

Thanks,

Bruce
