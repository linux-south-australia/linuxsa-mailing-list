&gt; I suspect the following:
&gt; _something_ to do with the handshaking...but I'm not sure what.

OK, are you 100% sure that it's enabled for hardware flow control?
Another point, which control line are you using for hardware flow
control?

&gt; If I capture a windows98 test page (~200k), and 'cat' it out the relevant
&gt; serial port, then a small portion of the page (~64k **) gets printed. The linux
&gt; machine finishes spitting it out the serial port, but the printer sits there
&gt; with the 'i'm getting serial port info' symbol flashing indefinitely (***)

What does "stty -a &lt; /dev/appropriate_serial_port_here" tell you?
crtscts, or -crtscts?

&gt; ** the printer input buffer is 64k, and the amount on the page could (perhaps)
&gt; be 64k in length (guess only - but assuming handshaking ????)

Sounds like it, or it sounds like the printer could be hung waiting for a
final page eject as well.  Try "/bin/echo -n -e '\012' &gt; /dev/you_know_what"

&gt; I can print text (i.e. test page) but not a binary file.

The serial port may be doing canonical processing (the lp system
normally takes care of this for you).  I'm not sure if the tty
ports under Linux retain their settings after the final close,
but I know that on a lot of other Unices they don't, so if you
use stty to change the speed or some other setting, the port's
characteristics are usually reset by the time you get around to
using cat on it.  In those instances, you have to use some
cunningness like:

(stty raw; cat &lt; foo.file) &lt; /dev/fnord &gt; /dev/fnord

&gt; What (stupid thing) am I overlooking ???

T'aint stupid; Unix is a little tricky in this area.
