&gt; ok, i'm doing some funky[1] stuff with perl and IMAP.

Caveat:  I don't grok Perl no more, so there may be typoes
I've introduced here and can't immediately spot.

OK, presuming that you don't suffer from NIH[1], and you trust
in the code that others produce, point thyself to CPAN and
fetch the Mail::* (can't remember the CPAN package they reside
in, but they're there).

(This is from a script I wrote a while ago)  Then, with
something like:

====
use Mail::Internet;
use Mail::Header;
use Mail::Address;

##  Retrieve "From:", "To:" line for local recipients.
##  $msgref is a reference to an array of strings.
my ($mail)   = Mail::Internet-&gt;new($msgref);
my ($header) = $mail-&gt;head();
my (@toaddrs)  = Mail::Address-&gt;parse($header-&gt;get("To"));
my (@fromaddr) = Mail::Address-&gt;parse($header-&gt;get("From"));

##  Process only the local addresses we can handle.
for $addr (@toaddrs) {
    my $whom = $addr-&gt;address;
    push(@localdudes, $whom) if $whom =~ /domain\.com\.au$/i;
}
====

you can easily retrieve your fields of interest.

In answer to your originaly problem:

&gt; I getting the IMAP message from my server (in perl) as a reference to an
&gt; array of lines.
&gt;
&gt;     # get the message, returned as a _reference_ to an array of lines
&gt;     $lines = $server-&gt;get( $msg );

[Sniptitude]

&gt; sub get_header {

[...]
&gt;         $lookline =~ s/\r//g;
&gt;         $lookline =~ s/\n//g;
[etc]

Perhaps because you're passing a reference to an array to get_header(),
the original array is being modified so that subsequent passes aren't
working?

Also ...

&gt;                 # the header we are getting is split over multiple lines
&gt;                 $bigline = join(", ", $bigline, $lookline);

Headers split over multiple lines aren't joined by commas; they're
just joined by a single white space character (or "Linear White Space",
as RFC822 puts it).

Plus ...

It doesn't look like you're breaking out of get_header() when
encountering a single empty line, delineating the end of the
headers from the start of the body of the message.

Use the Mail::* stuff.  It's easier, and been beaten to death
(read: tested) by cleverer people that you or I.

&gt; Thanks for reading this far. If you can help, that'd be sweet.

I expect my cheque for the usual amount at the usual spot.

  Daryl Tester
