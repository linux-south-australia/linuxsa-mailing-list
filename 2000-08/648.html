&gt; I was trying to install the Win4Lin demo off the latest APC, and it looked

it is fairly good, and quick. Seems to work with most software that
doesn't need special ports or hardware access - or win networking.
 
&gt; However, in the second phase of the use install, it just hung my machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen this? Does anyone know the fix?

...but the install can be a bitch :-)  I sorta gave up on the install
script, but it did work.

I was having probs with the machine hanging, but 'seem' to have solved
most of that by compiling the kernal for 386 rather than 586. ie, I
patched the kernal and recompiled ratehr than use a standard kernal. i had
to do that anyway as I have extra options compiled in...

Anyway, once the kernal is straight, you can install the win4lin
rpm. easy.

Next you run the winsetup utility. This is a nice gui app that allows you
to choose hardware and install your windows CD into the win directory. For
that you need a windows CD and a windows startup floppy (which you can
make using a 'real' windows install. 

The windows install will install the cd cab files to your hd, in opt or
var. They stay there for good, so you don't need the win CD any more, even
when adding drivers. 

Next it does the windows part of the install. I think that happened
automgically, tho you may need to type win & to do it... The windows part
of the install is slightly different to a 'normal' win install - ie with
my win95 classic it never asked for the user id key. 

I'm not sure which of the above steps the install script calls the second
stage install. Most of the trouble I had early on was when the rpm
installed and found there was no win4lin kernal support. I have never been
able to fix this with the cyrix 150 machines. The old pentium 120, tho,
works fine.

Once the kernal is right and the rpm is installed, the rest should be
okay. The win CD cabs should also install fine. I'd say you are locking up
during the actual windows install (to the win directory) which is where
windows starts to run - and it locks the machine. 

My only suggestion is to patch and compile the kernal for 386. You may
have to remove and reinstall the win4lin rpm. Maybe.

Hope it helps.

BTW, what's your hardware. I'm running it on a mere P120 with 32meg.
