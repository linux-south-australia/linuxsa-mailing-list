Urk.  All bets are off with linuxconf; it does things in
peculiar ways (read: deviates from the norm) so it makes
it hard to tell how the config has been set up.

Another data point - are you using 6.2?  I just found out
today (on my freshly minted Red Hat 6.2 CD set - thanks
Netcraft!) that it appears a lot of the /proc subsystem
has been subsumed by sysctl.

&gt;     O.K. so here is the wierd part. I did manually set
&gt; ip_forward to 1 and had another go and it still didn't work
&gt; so I went to surf the online docs (since the server was
&gt; connected online) and I suddenly couldn't surf at all. I
&gt; tried a route command, and this hung. I tried a ifconfig
&gt; command and it said eth0 was suddenly missing.

This is odd; why would losing your ethernet interface
affect traffic out your modem link?  Something bizarre
is going on here.  Turf linuxconf.
