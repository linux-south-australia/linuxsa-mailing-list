&gt; Hmmm, strictly speaking, the BIOS really does not, as it should simply
&gt; transfer control to the code in the MBR (the first 446 bytes are code, the
&gt; next 64 are partition table, last 2 are signature 0xAA55 or something like
&gt; that).

Find a copy of Norton's Diskedit and play around with it in read-only
mode. It's really quite educational. ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; However, I have found BIOSes that will not boot if you do not have an
&gt; active parition.  They put up a message about OS not found, or something
&gt; like that.

Or the NO ROM BASIC message. The BIOS can get quite cranky too, when
there are multiple active partitions.... ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; You do not even have to have an OS in the active partition (you can mark
&gt; swap as active for instance), as the BIOS will transfer control to LILO in
&gt; the MBR which does the rest.

Unfortunately, you can't boot off a partition in an extended partition
:-(

&gt; 
&gt; DOS and Windows, however, require that they be the active partition.
&gt; 

Nope. You usually need to *install* it on an active partition, but it
doesn't have to stay that way (if use use something other than the DOS
MBR).
