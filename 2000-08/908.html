To all PGP experts:

You've probably read in slashdot.org that PGP for Windows
has a newly discovered flaw which allows a 3rd party to
add an extra key to a signed public key without needing
access to the private signing key.

E.g. If I register my public key with a public key server,
it's possible for a government agency (or an illegal criminal
outfit [subtle implication: the government is a _legal_
criminal outfit, since they have special "powers"]) to add an
extra key to the copy of the key on the public server so that
windows PGP users will not be warned that the key is causing
their PGP software to doubly encrypt the message - once for
the real recipient, and once for the cri..  er.. government.

In fact, I now see the point of the parliament permitting
ASIO etc. to break into people's accounts to corrupt their
encryption keys. In fact, this kind of attack on a user's
key-ring would go undetected.
So it permits eavesdropping.


Question:
If anyone knows of software to verify that there are no
"extra" unsigned keys (the ADKs or Additional Decryption Key)
in a key-ring, could you please publicise such software here?
I've seen no such posting in slashdot.

I guess that if I'd been running Veracity software on my
machines for the last few years, I'd be able to detect
this sort of thing. But it's too late now.
And besides, that won't check the public key servers.

And actually, what would be really neat would be a tool to
detect if someone has sent me something encrypted with
more keys than my own.
There must surely be a tool to just read out the
list of all keys which have been used to encrypt a message.
Then I would know who are the other people who can read the
message.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
