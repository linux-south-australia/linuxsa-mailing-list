&gt; the mystery about my sound problem is that it worked fine when I

&gt; set it up in about 1 minute. (It played that poor-quality sound sample
&gt; and everything!)
&gt; 
&gt; But this time it just won't work...is it safe to assume that modprobe
&gt; fails because it can't find the sound module? (I wish it would give a
&gt; more complete message than 'an error occured running the modprobe
&gt; program'....it's like, thanks for the MS-style  general, unknown error
&gt; message!)
&gt; 

Congratulations I never managed to get sndcnfg to play any sound to me
but playing sound works fine for me.

&gt; The only reaason I can think that it would find it in one install and
&gt; not in another is that the version of rh5.1 I installed at the
&gt; installfest is different than the one I installed from the rh5.1
&gt; boxed-set...


To all with sound problems. If you upgrade your kernel (not sure which
version) soundcnf will fail! The modules will not load it will give an
error like device unable to initialize.

The problem lies in what sndcfg puts in /etc/conf.modules 
The older modules used dma=1,5 to specify the required dma's. The
problem is this is redhat (and works for older kernels) specific. The
correct setup should be dma=1 dma16=5 this will let the module load
correctly. I had great problems with 2.0.34 I ended up compiling the
sound in to the kernel and specifying the dma/irq's until I found out
this bug. 


If you are still having problems with modules, you should be loading
sb.o for a soundblaster.
In /etc/conf.modules there should be a setup like:

alias sound sb
options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5   &lt;- note the new changes

Sound.o is just something which keeps tabs on what is happeneing with
the soundcard. (replaced with soundcore.o in the development kernels)

At the command line try:

modprobe sb

this should install the soundcard modules - it automatically loads
sound.o
If you have errors when you then send me an email.

Then as a simple test do: cat somewavfile /dev/dsp 
You should hear the sound - it will be slower than normal but you should
hear it.

Cheers,
