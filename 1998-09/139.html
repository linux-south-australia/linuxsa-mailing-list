sounds like a cool idea to me... I was going to experiment with something
similar a while back... but... again dues to lack of interest....

ah well....

Heyas -just re the radio stuff, I've been seriously looking at that.
I have a fairly decent UHF setup here, and I wanted to try and get packet
radio going over it with a few friends.
I was considering using the soundmodem drivers from the dev kernels to try
and combine them with either a TX4200 or a PRM8025...
Unfortunately, there was a lack of interest among my friends, so I abandoned
the project.
If anyone has more experience at getting this to work, or with using TNCs,
please get back to me!

&gt;&gt; Subject: some sort of crazy idea.
&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, 17 September 1998 20:10
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is just an idea, flame me if you like, but remember we may meet in
&gt;&gt; real life at a meeting :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Everyone seems to be after books, I can see why, I find I can absorb the
&gt;&gt; info much better if it's on paper, and it's easier on the eyes. Anyways,
&gt;&gt; what I was thinking about doing is having some sort of 'collective
&gt;&gt; library' setup where people can swap books (for a short time) at
&gt;&gt; meetings (or wherever).
&gt;
&gt;It's not an innovation (altho - to Internet types - it may seem like it),
&gt;since radio clubs do it (e.g. North East Radio Club - NERC) all the time!
&gt;
&gt;But it *is* a good idea...  Speaking of Radio Club's, by the way... I'd
&gt;like to suggest multichanneling... i.e. keeping a two-way radio on *beside*
&gt;the computer, e.g. while hacking and/or surfing... like those independent
&gt;car parts places... a "conference call" channel... best if Voice-Operated,
&gt;but even push-to-talk would work... a former TAFE (or was it UofSA instruc-
&gt;tor used to have a simplex channel for such purposes (on the Amateur "two-
&gt;meter band" - somewhere between 144 & 148 MHz nFM for those with scanners)
&gt;
&gt;He would typically be in contact with any number of people, throughout
&gt;much of he day... as he made satellite contacts (fetching or forwarding
&gt;e-mail via packet radio)... or experimented with Slow-Scan TV (also over
&gt;radio)... etc.
&gt;
&gt;Why not a similar on-air LINUX voice-conference channel...?  If not enough
&gt;are licensed amateurs, yet... ;)  UHF CB *might* work... in some areas...
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of radio... has anybody else followed up the Tue Australian's call
&gt;for participation in Ericsson's Bluetooth technology...?  (Leave it to The
&gt;Australian to get it right, BTW, not... they described the technology as
&gt;"shortwave" (2.45 GHz... right... Very Shortwave...)
&gt;
&gt;It would be good to get some pro-LINUX people in on the ground floor, I'd
&gt;say, just in case this thing flies sooner than expected...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; This could be an informal thing, for instance I have K&R 2 "The [ANSI] C
&gt;&gt; programming language" great book BTW :) anybody want to borrow it, in
&gt;&gt; exchange for lending me, say, a book on advancedish Linux/Unix or
&gt;&gt; perhaps one on Perl?. This would save us all a lot of money on book
&gt;&gt; costs. Sure Adelaide reference library has a few books, but you can't
&gt;&gt; take them home, and it helps to be able to do stuff on your own machine
&gt;&gt; while you read. If someone (anyone!) thinks this is a good idea, reply
&gt;&gt; and I'll bring my books to the meeting.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe LINUX SA should pull its buying power & import books &/or CD-ROM's
&gt;in bulk, perhaps in cooperation with other LINUX groups... The cost of
&gt;books is way over the top here... and this is true DESPITE there being
&gt;NO TAX on books...!  Farmers have done similar things to keep their fer-
&gt;tiliser costs down... what can we learn from their example?
&gt;
&gt;Whatcha think?
