Geoffrey,

&gt; So it's a bug.  Do something useful -- submit a bug report.

Curious that you should suggest that.  I did report it, but heard nothing
from them about it.  Maybe that means they were going to fix the problem
in the next release (did they?) and just didn't have the time to show me
the courtesy of saying thank you; I don't know.  At least I tried.

I actually do strive to be a good net citizen and reporting problems is
just one of the things that I do.  I also fix bugs (packaging faults
is not a bug, it's a quality control problem) and submit those fixes
back to the vendor.  And I improve facilities, ditto to the changes.
For example, I modified log-rotate to permit files groups, thus pre
and post rotate scripts get invoked once per group, not once per file.
For an example of why that is good: it lets me signal syslogd once per
per group of files, rather than once for each file.  I submitted the
change.  I don't know if it has gone anywhere, but I tried.


&gt; Is there such a thing as newstrftime()?

No idea.  However there is a manual page for it in the SRPMS, but not in
the RPMS.  There are other new* manual pages in both, so I don't think
it's a mistake.
 

&gt; # rpm -ql sh-utils | grep date
&gt; /bin/date
&gt; /usr/man/man1/date.1

I wonder if you have installed the SRPMS or the RPMS?  I suspect the
former.  Before I posted I actually compared the files in RPMS against
SRPMS.  It is as I said.
 

&gt;&gt; Red Hat have a reputation for poor quality control.
&gt; I don't think such a reputation is deserved, and I think this thread
&gt; shows how they get it.

Yes, this thread does rather show how they get their bad reputation.
Although I suspect that you and I mean different things.  :-)

 
&gt; Your complaint was: "It seems that Red Hat 4.2 leaves most of the
&gt; manual pages out when you do a binary install.

"Most" is wrong.  I retract that.  Sometimes even I let my emotion
get the better of my mouth.  However it most certainly is true that
Red Hat 4.2 has left some important manual pages out of the binary
RPMs.


&gt; Only one of these examples showed any man pages missing.  I still
&gt; think your complaint is silly.

I wonder if you would do what I did: Don't just search your installed
RPM database, because it doesn't distinguish between files that came
from SRPMS versus RPMS.  Please actually check the source (as I did),
and then tell me if I'm wrong.  And if you think I'm wrong, I most
certainly will present you with checksums, and file listings, of the
two RPMs, so that we can settle this to our mutual satisfaction.  Not
that it really matters; nobody cares about this (we could finish this
off-line if you like) other than that I don't like being told that I
make silly complaints, particularly when I have taken great care to
be certain of my facts.

I also don't appreciate the implication that I criticised without
trying to fix the problem.  You showed quite a nerve to tell me to
submit a bug report.  Indeed!  And finally a short philosophy: There
is nothing wrong with being wrong; the wrongness is in being wrong
but denying it.  This extends to support given to other.  For example,
you pointed out that most manual pages are in the RPMS; and yes, I
admitted I was wrong.  Kudos to me for showing integrity.  For another
example, I claimed that Red Hat has a reputation for quality control
problems (and demonstrated how that reputation might have been earned).
Let me just re-read what you said.  Oh yes...  Tsk tsk.

Regards,

David, who agonised over sending this publicly because the thread has
become boring, but who decided he has a reputation to defend.
