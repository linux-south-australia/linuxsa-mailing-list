OK Everyone

Let's Get Ready To Rumble!

I have received a couple of new contenders for the PC
Badge graphic that I feel are worthy of a good look.
I have placed them on my web page with a link to Paul's
so you can see all of his work.

My comments...

Paul has put a boarder on his images which although
do round off the image on the web pages might not look
so good once in badge form. I have a feeling that the
edge of the plastic bubble will result in this boarder
distorting.

Colour of the boarder aside, I think that either of
the first two images (which I think are identical) are
very good and since are so close to the original could
be used without anyone being upset. (Feel free to
correct me if I am wrong).

When I say "close to the original" I should point out
that Paul has gone to a lot of effort.
	3D revers "L"
	Larger writing of "Linux Powered"
	etc...

The only thing that I might like to see changed is just
to give a small gap (1 pixel or so) between the dot over
the "i" and Tux's foot. It kinda' bugs me the way they
touch...

Anyway it is now time for comment, and don't delay
because time is running out. I am looking to place
the order in about 2 days!!!

PS. Please forward this email to other groups, HUMBUG,
LUV, SLUG... (I don't believe that I have been contacted
by anyone representing SLUG yet...)

Just in case you have not bookmarked the pages...
