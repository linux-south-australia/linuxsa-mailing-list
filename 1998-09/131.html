&gt; Subject: some sort of crazy idea.
&gt; Date: Thursday, 17 September 1998 20:10
&gt; 
&gt; This is just an idea, flame me if you like, but remember we may meet in
&gt; real life at a meeting :)
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone seems to be after books, I can see why, I find I can absorb the
&gt; info much better if it's on paper, and it's easier on the eyes. Anyways,
&gt; what I was thinking about doing is having some sort of 'collective
&gt; library' setup where people can swap books (for a short time) at
&gt; meetings (or wherever).

It's not an innovation (altho - to Internet types - it may seem like it),
since radio clubs do it (e.g. North East Radio Club - NERC) all the time!

But it *is* a good idea...  Speaking of Radio Club's, by the way... I'd
like to suggest multichanneling... i.e. keeping a two-way radio on *beside*
the computer, e.g. while hacking and/or surfing... like those independent
car parts places... a "conference call" channel... best if Voice-Operated,
but even push-to-talk would work... a former TAFE (or was it UofSA instruc-
tor used to have a simplex channel for such purposes (on the Amateur "two-
meter band" - somewhere between 144 & 148 MHz nFM for those with scanners)

He would typically be in contact with any number of people, throughout
much of he day... as he made satellite contacts (fetching or forwarding
e-mail via packet radio)... or experimented with Slow-Scan TV (also over
radio)... etc.

Why not a similar on-air LINUX voice-conference channel...?  If not enough
are licensed amateurs, yet... ;)  UHF CB *might* work... in some areas...

Speaking of radio... has anybody else followed up the Tue Australian's call
for participation in Ericsson's Bluetooth technology...?  (Leave it to The
Australian to get it right, BTW, not... they described the technology as
"shortwave" (2.45 GHz... right... Very Shortwave...)

It would be good to get some pro-LINUX people in on the ground floor, I'd
say, just in case this thing flies sooner than expected...
 
&gt; This could be an informal thing, for instance I have K&R 2 "The [ANSI] C
&gt; programming language" great book BTW :) anybody want to borrow it, in
&gt; exchange for lending me, say, a book on advancedish Linux/Unix or
&gt; perhaps one on Perl?. This would save us all a lot of money on book
&gt; costs. Sure Adelaide reference library has a few books, but you can't
&gt; take them home, and it helps to be able to do stuff on your own machine
&gt; while you read. If someone (anyone!) thinks this is a good idea, reply
&gt; and I'll bring my books to the meeting.

Maybe LINUX SA should pull its buying power & import books &/or CD-ROM's
in bulk, perhaps in cooperation with other LINUX groups... The cost of
books is way over the top here... and this is true DESPITE there being
NO TAX on books...!  Farmers have done similar things to keep their fer-
tiliser costs down... what can we learn from their example?

Whatcha think?
