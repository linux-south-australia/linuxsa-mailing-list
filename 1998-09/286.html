For all people on the LinuxSA mailing list from Adelaide Uni CS
department. (& other interested individuals)

The reason we are getting multiple copies of LinuxSA mail is because the
CS mail server is set up so that if people's mail accounts are over quota,
mail gets postponed. The mailing list sends mail to a number of people
here, some of whom have mail account that are too full. The mail is sent
to everyone, but then it is postponed. It then gets resent again after 15
minutes. What this means is that unless all CS students on LinuxSA keep
thier mailboxes relatuively clean, the rest of us suffer. Stuart
(sysadmin) is currently in the process of upgrading sendmail to stop this
behaviour, but until he does so, we are consigned to having to log in
every hour, and delete repeat mails. Anyone who has a full mailbox should
try to keep it empty, so that the repeats stop...
