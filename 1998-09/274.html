&gt; Intel, Netscape set to invest in Linux supplier

&gt; My personaly experiences with/of Intel lead me to believe that Intel's
&gt; *direct* involvement (as opposed to support from afar) is *not* good
&gt; news.

First, the disclaimer: this is all being written with my kernel hacker
hat on, not my Red Hat.  I work from home, not at the Red Hat offices,
and don't know _any_ of the details of possible investments in the
company.

What I do have is an interest, shared I presume with the majority of the
members on this list, in seeing enterprise-quality Linux become a
reality.  And no, it's not there yet.  What do you mean we are limited
to 16 scsi devices?  You say I can't put 4GB memory in the box?
Scalability up to 8 cpus kills filesystem performance?  32-bit file size
limit?  No clusters?

With the announcements of Oracle, Sybase, Informix and friends coming
out for Linux (and now *DB2*, for goodness' sake!!), we have real
scalability issues to address.  I've worked on VMS internals for a
couple of years, and that is a real enterprise-quality operating system
if ever there was one.  There is an enormous amount of work required to
make Linux a viable player here, and an enormous amount of cost
involved.  

For example, testing becomes a major headache: we've seen all the way
through Linux's development that kernels which were rock solid for
365-day uptimes under moderate load keeled over in a week under extreme
load.  1.2.13 was widely regarded as hugely stable, but you could kill
it very easily by putting a hundred serial ports on the back running ppp
at the same time.  Joe average developer cannot hope to reproduce those
loads.  Enterprise scalability takes us further: who on this list is
going to give me access to a 4GB 8-way SMP machine with a terrabyte of
disk storage to do 14-day stress and performance tests on 2.2?

A company of Intel's size could be a great asset in this field.  I'm not
saying that getting into bed with the Big Boys is entirely without risk,
but neither do I believe that anybody is getting into this with their
eyes closed.  The more we stamp around condemning people who express an
interest in helping Linux progress, the less we will be able to engage
and influence those people.

&gt; Intel doesn't hesitate to implement anti-competitive measures of its
&gt; own wherever it can. It has played the bully on many occasions before,
&gt; and I haven't seen that attitude change in the post-Grove era. The
&gt; Linux overtures are clearly moves by Intel to enhance its position
&gt; with/against Microsoft than it is to indicate love of Linux (over
&gt; which it has fairly little control).

You can bet your butt that if the Linux community starts to get the
shivers regarding the Intel deal, Caldera and Suse will be absolutely
delighted to step in and take over the custom of disenchanted users.
Linux is an inherently non-monopolistic market.  I personally believe
customer loyalty to be the biggest asset any commercial Linux vendor can
have, precisely because there will never be a shortage of competitors to
the company whose following falters.

In short, I don't really care what posturing Intel makes outside the
Linux market: if they are genuinely keen on helping Linux, then great.
If they aren't, then it's hard to see what they can get out of this
deal!

Hi,

On Mon, 28 Sep 1998 15:01:01 -0400 (EDT), Evan Leibovitch
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:evan@telly.org">evan@telly.org</A>&gt; said:

&gt; In the case of Intel (and to a lesser extent, Netscape), we have
&gt; companies who want to use Linux to further their internal goals, not
&gt; (as in the case of the VCs) as a profitable goal in its own right.

True, of course.  However, that is only a concern if those motives are
not beneficial to the Linux community.  We have got far --- very far ---
on volunteer effort, but things _are_ changing.  Even without external
investment, Red Hat have funded the RHAD labs effort to develop GPLed
application software for Linux.  More recently they hired Alan and me to
work full time on the kernel (*not* to work full time on Red Hat
projects).  In their latest release, Red Hat 5.1, they pulled all of the
retricted-license (demo, non-commercial-use only or time-limited)
software off the main installation disk and put it on a separate vendor
CD, with the explicit aim of ensuring that the *whole* of the main Red
Hat CD can be freely copied.

Red Hat have put their money where their mouth is and are fully
committed to free software (again, disclaimers: I'm still speaking as a
kernel developer, not as a representative of Red Hat, so take this as my
own opinion).  If there are to be more projects funded out of external
investment, then I would expect the results to be GPLed too.  I really
don't see any problem for Linux as a whole if everybody wins, and more
free software _is_ an everybody-wins proposition!

&gt; It is this difference in motive that offers concern. I would have
&gt; preferred the involvement of folks like Netscape and Intel to go
&gt; through through Linux International, where their money and input could
&gt; have been channeled in a distribution-independent manner -- an LI
&gt; program of project-based bursaries and grants to help fund open source
&gt; projects in acedemia, is as valuable to me (maybe moreso) than just
&gt; adding people to Red Hat's payroll.

Perhaps, but (a) LI do not have the organisation in place to employ
people (and we are talking about full-time employment in the case of
RHAD labs, for example), and (b) Red Hat have already proven that they
are willing to add people to their payroll for the sole purpose of
giving the whole Linux community better free software.  Gnome is looking
*great*, and its rate of progress is phenomenal.  I remember some of the
Red Hat folk gawking at the Gnome stand at Linux Expo: they couldn't
believe how much progress RHAD labs had made on that stuff since the
last cut of the RH distribution CDs had been made, 6 weeks earlier.  

All of that has been funded by Red Hat.  My work on journaling ext2fs,
Alan's work to modularise the kernel sound drivers: all funded by Red
Hat, and all going back into the Linux-wide free software melting pot.

Think about it. 

&gt;&gt; You can bet your butt that if the Linux community starts to get the
&gt;&gt; shivers regarding the Intel deal, Caldera and Suse will be absolutely
&gt;&gt; delighted to step in and take over the custom of disenchanted users.

&gt; Agreed. but that's not the point. These divisions could make the
&gt; (commercial) Linux world as divisive and full of petty infighting as
&gt; the Unix world has traditionally been. There are mistakes to be
&gt; learned from.

Sorry, I can see why that's your reaction to what I said: I could have
expressed myself better.  The point is not that the other players in the
distribution game will be able to pick up the pieces if somebody drops
the ball (excuse my horribly mixed metaphors: that was gross).  

Linux is inherently incapable of being dominated by any one company *to
its detriment*.  Not only is Red Hat committed to free software, it also
exists in a market which will slip through its fingers the very instant
it tries to tie Linux into any proprietary extensions.  The point I was
trying to make is actually that there is an enormously powerful
incentive NOT to be divisive, not that such division would be picked up
on by others.

&gt;&gt; Linux is an inherently non-monopolistic market.  I personally believe
&gt;&gt; customer loyalty to be the biggest asset any commercial Linux vendor can
&gt;&gt; have, precisely because there will never be a shortage of competitors to
&gt;&gt; the company whose following falters.

&gt; True, but the scenario you paint is inherantly unstable, and that works
&gt; against Linux's attempt to penetrate corporate IS.

The scenario I paint is such a bad situation all round that I can't see
it happening.  That's what I'm trying to say.  The freedom of Linux
means that no company can ever afford to start upsetting its users.
