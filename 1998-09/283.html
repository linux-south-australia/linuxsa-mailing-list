&gt;&gt; Most people know, but for those who don't, windows 95/98 is a 32-bit patch
&gt;&gt; for a 16-bit GUI shell running on top of an 8-bit operating system written
&gt;&gt; for a 4-bit processor by a 2-bit company who cannot stand 1 bit of

No it shouldn't - see below. *sigh*

It's an old one, yes. I think the very first thing I said alludes to the
fact that I didn't make up rather amusing comment myself, but I put it in
because I figured that someone, somewhere would *have* to bring it up, so
that's why I wrote...

             * * * &gt; &gt; &gt; Most people know... &lt; &lt; &lt; * * *

(*rolls eyes*)

I have to ask - are you the sort of person who writes in and complains
about Garry Larson cartoons? 

To reiterate - I KNOW I didn't make it up -  but I genuinley though that
most people would understand that. I think you could have made better use
of your first ever post to Linux SA *deeper sigh*

But since you insist on originality, I'll make write one just for you.

"WindowsNT is 16-bit operating system, with a 32-bit GUI that also doubles as 
a kernel." :o)

Alex!

With WindowsNT, I always felt limited by the software available.
         With UNIX, I am limited only by my knowledge.
