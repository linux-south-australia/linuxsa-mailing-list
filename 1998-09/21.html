Hi all,

Well I have stopped taking anymore entries for
the design of the badge. The ones up on the web
page now will be final. As far as which one we
use, the "Powered by Linux" badge from Paul
seems to be out in front.

Get your thoughts in now because I will be
making a decision and putting in the order
tomorrow!

I will be accepting orders until mid Friday.
After that I will still accept order but cannot
guantry delivery. Depends if the printer will let
me increase the quantity. I hope they will, up
until they actually do the print run.

My only remaining concern is the question of
a boarder around the badge. The response to
this has been mixed and my feeling is that it
is unnecessary (it will look fine with white right
up to the edge) and introduces a risk of making
the badge look uneven. The "L" that Tux sits on
is boarder enough.

I don't know much about (badge) art but I know
what I like. :)  Well that's my 2 cents.
But what I really want to know what everyone
else thinks.
