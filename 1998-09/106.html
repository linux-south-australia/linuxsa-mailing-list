Heyas
I've got two SCSI cards I'm trying to sell:
An Adaptec 1542CP -- An ISA card, it supports fast scsi, which means speeds
up to 10 Mb/sec. I dont have any drivers or devices capable of delivering
data that quick, so I've never tested to see if the ISA bus can handle that
fast. But a SCSI benchmark was giving me 8.3 Mb/sec, but I'm not quite sure
exactly what that was testing..

A Symbios NCR810 -- A PCI card, also supporting fast scsi. According to the
person I bought it from, it is supposed to do Ultra SCSI (20 Mb/sec) as well
as fast scsi, etc. However, I think this is wrong. I never made it go faster
than 10 Mb/sec. Still, there's a connector on the board saying 'Ultra SCSI
connector', so who knows. I'll call it a fast scsi card for now though.

Both cards have an internal 50 pin connector, and an external hi-density
connector.
The Adaptec is 'auto-terminating' so you can plug and unplug external and
internal devices, and it will sort the bus out. The Symbios requires you to
adjust the board if you have something on both internal and external, but it
only takes a moment.
The Symbios can let you boot off a SCSI harddrive, with some Award and AMI
BIOSs.

Both cards are fully supported very well in the linux kernels, old and new.
WinNT and Win95 support these cards fine, with native support.

Anyway, if you are interested, please reply to this email, but could you
also CC: it to <A HREF="mailto:topcat@null.net">topcat@null.net</A>, since my uni has been a bit flakey lately.

Thanks,
Toby



Also, I've got a Canon BCJ-4000 (colour and B&W inkjet) that I'm looking for
offers on.
Also, a Toshiba Pagelaser12 b&w laser printer, that comes with lots of spare
toner.
And, a Yaesu FT-10R.
