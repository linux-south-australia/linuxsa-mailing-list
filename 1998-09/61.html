Hi everyone out there in Badge Land.

Well, I have received a evaluation badge from
the printer and I must say it looks pretty good,
so I have given them the go ahead.

I am sure that all of you are egger to see what
they look like so I will take it home tonight and
take a couple of photos of it and put them up
on the web page in the morning.

Alex Garner from Lynx Internet Connections.
Your Linux friendly internet service provider
&lt;/PLUG&gt; has kindly offered to allow people
who cannot get to the LinuxSA meeting to
pick their badges up from his office in the city
during normal office hours. If you would prefer
to do this please let me know so that I can
make sure that Alex has your order.

Lynx Internet Connections 
Level 2, 38 Currie Street 
Adelaide SA 5000 
Phone: +61 (08) 8410 4441 
Fax: +61 (08) 8410 4446

I was hoping to have the badges for the next
LinuxSA meeting on the 15/9 but the printer
may not have them all done by then, so they
will be distributed on a first come, first served
basis. The rest will be printed by the next, on
the 24/9 (Richard Stallman, don't miss this
one!) so you will be able to get them then.

If you have not put your order in yet then this
is your last chance. I will be printing some
extra badges so don't miss out.

Nick Stock
