<PRE>
I'm having trouble getting my inbuilt cmi8330 sound card to work. It
'claims' to be 100% SB compatable, but sndconfig leads to a core dump. I
searched around and tried to find what files to change. I've included
everything I think is relevant.

First, the pnpdump:

options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x330

options adlib_card io=0x388
===================================

I think this should be in the .config file (/usr/src/linux/) :

CONFIG_SOUND=m
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=m
CONFIG_SOUND_SB=m
CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB=m

=====================

I ran isapnp with the isapnp.conf file, and it seemed to work ok (giving
address of board). Rebooted and it said something like: isapnp board 1
address xxx xxx xxx name CMI0001. Trouble is, cat *.au &gt; /dev/audio
doesn't work. Neither do any of the sounds in the games.

Do I need to do anything else? I've got some strange feeling I need to
recompile the kernel, changing the .config, but when I looked in
/usr/src/linux, there was no .config file, and I searched alot of the
subdirectories, but I couldn't find it.

TIA,

David Lawrence
