Hi

Brett here.  

I am using SuSE 5.1.  This version of Linux is of German origin but
the information is in English.  It appears to be solid but has very
few users in Australia.  The manual is a bit Dutch well German might
be a better choice.  The distribution is over four CD (now five I
believe).  

The main difference between the Linuxs is what packages that are
included and how well your favour of Linux installs and maintains
them.  SuSE is not bad but the leader in the field appears to be Red
Hat.  I have not used Red Hat but from my reading it certainty appears
to be leading the pack.  SuSE's strength is the rounded applications
it comes with.  Also, where possible it includes the source code.

If you are new to Linux/Unix/Xenix or one of the other Unix clones I
suggest Red Hat is probably the best.  If you are a pro then look at
SuSE but you may find an Australian distributor hard to track down.

I have a book on Slackware along with its CD and it appears Slackware
is lagging a little behind but this version is quite old.

Anyway the above is only my personal so no doubt someone somewhere
will have another opinion.  Happy hunting.

Regards Brett

&gt; Hi
&gt; I am  thinking of installing Linux at my personal machine, as there
&gt; are many version of Linux out there, like SlackWare, Red Hat
&gt; and few others to name. I still hasn't decided which one to put, as
&gt; I have not much information on what are the features of each one
&gt; and how one is better than the other. So I would like to have some
&gt; help on deciding which version of linux I shall buy.
&gt; And if someone can give me some features and comparisons of each
&gt; linux version, that would help me to decide to which one I
&gt; should be buying.
&gt; Thanx
