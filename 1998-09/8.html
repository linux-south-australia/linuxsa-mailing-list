Personally I like the L the correct way and a possible way around the
issue of not having the word Linux on the horizontal is to have the
words "Powered By" on the vertical.  Would it be too much trouble to
post an updated graphic on the web page. I would like to see it.

&gt; Subject: 	Linux Badge
&gt; 
&gt; Guys,
&gt; 	I have been playing with the linux badge design, while I am no
&gt; expert
&gt; graphics designer I like most of us can tell what looks good and what
&gt; doesn't.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The original badge design looks good but some people have made
&gt; comment
&gt; about the penguin sitting on a reverse "L", perhaps a normal "L" would
&gt; be
&gt; more appropriate.
&gt; 	I have spent considerable time playing with the design, namely
&gt; reversing
&gt; the "L" and come to the conclusion that a reverse "L" is best.
&gt; 
&gt; 	My reasoning for this is as follows;
&gt; 
&gt; A reverse "L" means "Linux" horizontal on the bottom in the prime
&gt; position
&gt; with the "Powered" vertically up the side.
&gt; 
&gt; A normal "L" means "Linux" is vertical on the side while the "Powered"
&gt; bit
&gt; goes across the bottom.
&gt; 
&gt; It is for this reason I think the Reverse "L" is best, I would much
&gt; prefer
&gt; the word Linux to be most prominent.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also an issue of the image, I have built a high resolution
&gt; image
&gt; with nice shades and so forth but looking at the badge on my own
&gt; machine I
&gt; noticed that its design has only two colours, Question to Nick Stock
&gt; here
&gt; can the people who are going to print this make a photographic image
&gt; or are
&gt; we limited to two or three colours non photographic type?
&gt; 
&gt; We might have to stop and re think the design.
&gt; 
&gt; I have knocked up a WEB page with all of the designs I have come up
&gt; with, I
&gt; intended to put the URL here but I cannot ftp into my WEB Site at the
&gt; moment, as soon as I get the jigger to work I will let you know,
&gt; hopefully
&gt; real soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Kind Regards
&gt; 	Paul
