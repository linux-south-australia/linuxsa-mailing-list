 I'm new LINUX SA's Mailing List...

 I have recently enjoyed the VERY
 active Year 2000 Newsgroup, with-
 out feeling in any way "over-
 whelmed" by the sheer quantity of
 messages posted to it...

 By contrast, despite a more modest
 message-rate in the mailing-list,
 I must say that it can be a bit of
 a bother to "filter"...

 Now, don't get me wrong... it's
 nice to read what's happening in
 the local LINUX community...

 And, I - for one - would like to
 encourage its many threads to go
 on discussing whatever interests
 their correspondents, et al...

 I feel, however, that a Newsgroup
 would provide more visual thread-
 structure... and let people read
 what they like... and skip what
 would not likely interest them.

 In my case, I spend time filtering
 the mailing list's flow, trying to
 save a few messages with pointers
 to useful info and/or tips...

 I'd like to use the power inherent
 in newsgroup clients, e.g. thread-
 groupers... that I just don't have
 in my e-mail client (is that it...?
 you all have smarter e-mail clients
 and - as a result - don't need the
 open-to-spam risks that come with a
 newsgroup?)

 What'cha think?
