This is just an idea, flame me if you like, but remember we may meet in
real life at a meeting :)

Everyone seems to be after books, I can see why, I find I can absorb the
info much better if it's on paper, and it's easier on the eyes. Anyways,
what I was thinking about doing is having some sort of 'collective
library' setup where people can swap books (for a short time) at
meetings (or wherever).

This could be an informal thing, for instance I have K&R 2 "The [ANSI] C
programming language" great book BTW :) anybody want to borrow it, in
exchange for lending me, say, a book on advancedish Linux/Unix or
perhaps one on Perl?. This would save us all a lot of money on book
costs. Sure Adelaide reference library has a few books, but you can't
take them home, and it helps to be able to do stuff on your own machine
while you read. If someone (anyone!) thinks this is a good idea, reply
and I'll bring my books to the meeting.
