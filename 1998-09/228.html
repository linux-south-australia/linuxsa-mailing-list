COMMERCIAL:

You have the penguin badge, and considered the LCD panel ...

Now it is time for the ultimate accessory for your Linux Box :

- I have a quantity of working VT320 terminals (ex australia post), and
a few VT420's in the same batch.

All are in good working condition, some of them have stickers plastered
on them, and some have turned slightly brown with age.

All terminals come with working keyboards (nice heavy DEC keyboards with
the famous 'gold' key)

None of the terminals include serial line cables or power cords,
Standard kettle cords can be used for power cords, but you will have to
dig around for a serial cable. The cabling you will need is standard
RS-232 with a cross over on Tx & Rx   - ie DTE wiring, as opposed to DCE
wiring used for modems.

I am asking $40 for each terminal, with a guarantee that if it does not
work for you, you can either choose another one, or get your money back.

What you can do with them :

- Mount the monitor only near your machine, and hardcode constant
rolling logs :

example 1: display processes constantly

$ export TERM=vt320; top &gt; /dev/tty01

example 2: Display all internet traffic through your proxy server

$ tail -f /local/squid/logs/access.log &gt; /dev/tty01

example 3: Display all important system messages

$ tail -f /var/log/mesages &gt; /dev/tty01

- Alternately, run a long cable out to your garage, and run lynx on a
terminal, so you can access important engineering specs from the web
while you tune your car.

- Excellent for gaming nuts : Next time you host a Role playing /
Warhammer / Battletech / Command Decision tournament, give each player a
VT320 for limited intelligence and order processing, all controlled by a
single Linux box.

- The monitors are small, light and rugged enough to be mounted in a car
for up to the minute data displays. 

- Connect the terminal directly to a modem and use it to telnet into
remote linux boxen / BBS's etc. I also have a quantity of maestro modems
that I can bundle with the terminal if you are interested.

For all of the above reasons, I want to keep about 5-6 for my own use,
so that leaves around 20 for the rest of the world.  First come, first
served.
