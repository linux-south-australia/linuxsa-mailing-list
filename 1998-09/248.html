&gt; Hi Matthew,
&gt;
&gt; I think you meant to send this message to the list, not directly to
&gt; me?
&gt;
&gt; Re. Red Hat 5.0:

&gt; sndconfig is only meant for Soundblaster cards (not that that's an
&gt; excuse for coredumping, but it wasn't meant to work anyway if you
&gt; don't have one of them).
&gt;

Does this mean that I should build my own kernel to get support for my card ?

&gt;
&gt; Do you have a Cyrix processor?  A bug in some versions of these caused
&gt; the gcc supplied with Red Hat Linux 5.0 to give internal errors when
&gt; compiling stuff.
&gt;

Yep ! - That would have been it !

&gt;
&gt; No idea what your postgres problem was (from memory, it worked okay
&gt; for me).
&gt;
&gt; And 5.1:
&gt;
&gt; How much memory do you have installed?
&gt;

I have 2x32MB + 2x8MB = 80 MB
Linux recognises 64 MB,
Win 95, plus CMOS memory initialisation recognises 80MB

&gt;
&gt; Have you recompiled your kernel with support for the ESS sound card?

&gt; Regards,
&gt; Geoffrey.
&gt;

No Yet ! , but I was considering this.

Would you suggest the one straight off the CD, or perhaps a 2.1 kernel
as might this also solve my memory problems ??

Thanks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Red Hat have a reputation for poor quality control.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think such a reputation is deserved, and I think this thread
&gt; &gt; &gt; shows how they get it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would just like to add my 2 cents here.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I agree that Red Hat, while not perfect,
&gt; &gt; do at least take quality control seriously.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have experience using HP-UX, and HP don't even provide a
&gt; &gt; copy of "less" in their base systems install. !!!!!! Let alone stuff like
&gt; &gt; gimp, image magic, apache, postgress... need I go on !...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh yes, and linux is much better at getting the latest versions of
&gt; &gt; software such as X11 and other standard UNIX stuff.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was pretty impressed myself with the quality of Red Hat 4.2
&gt; &gt; I installed it really easily and was able to get most things working.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was however disappointed with 5.0.
&gt; &gt;     1. The sound config program cored when I used it,
&gt; &gt;     2.  gcc gave me internal errors.
&gt; &gt;     3.  I couldn't get postgress running.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At least Red Hat do make the patches available on the net and
&gt; &gt; are open about the bugs which are found (unlike Microshaft) !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have found Red Hat 5.1 much better, although for some reason
&gt; &gt; I still have the following problems.
&gt; &gt;     1. The Kernel doesn't recognise my 3rd and 4th ram simms (72 pin EDO):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     2. I haven't been able to configure my ESS sound card:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Help on these problems would be much appreciated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS, and if you want to know about poor quality control, try
&gt; &gt; writing a 200 page document on MS Word 6.0 !
&gt; &gt; (Who ever let senior managers pick the standard
&gt; &gt; software used in corporations ! ) .... ?
&gt; &gt; I suppose they did !!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If one is going to make comparisons, at least compare
&gt; &gt; apples with apples !!!!!
