I've also got a rockwell compatible voice modem, and i've had  a bit of a 
go at it under linux.  So far, i have had success getting a simple 
answering machine/fax machine/data answering setup using vgetty.  Vgetty 
is an addon to mgetty+sendfax, which was already on my RH 4.2 box ready 
to run.  This is a pain, cos you have to check the log for new 
messages.  I am looking for scripts or a frontend to manage the messages 
easier.  Vgetty apparently can be used as a multi-mailbox system because 
when it recieves DTMF digits, it runs a script. - but you have to write 
the script.
I won't bore everyone with how i did it, but just ask if you want, it's 
easy.

I have also seen a program on the net called SPK, which was originally a 
speakerphone for voice modems, and has now grown to answer the phone 
and have an interface with counters and a single button to listen to new 
messages etc. - but i haven't tried it yet.

Has anyone else done this or used SPK ?

&gt; Hi all.

&gt; Also, I recently acquired a Rockwell-based voice modem and am wondering
&gt; if there is any software available for Linux that will drive the voice
&gt; functions to their full potential. The modem itself ships with Winfax by
&gt; Symantec which looks quite nice but unfortunately doesn't run in Linux.
&gt; I would like something with answering machine and multiple mailbox
&gt; capabilities if it is available.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
