Hi

I came across your group while wandering around the Internet.  If I am
intruding please be gentle with the blow torch.

I have just installed SuSE 5.1 Lunix and after a few problems have it
running.  I even managed to get X Windows System working.  Admittedly
the display drops into 60's psychedelic colours on some screens.  I am
using a generic driver (S3 Trio 64+) because I could not find my card
(Video-58P) in the set-up screens.

Flushed with success I decided to install Netscape from apcmag.cd
September 98 issue.  I am new to Linux but did spend a fair bit of
time with Xenix.  The gz file format caused a bit of confusion until I
"fluked/dropped" to the idea that tar could be used to unpack the
files.  I had thought gzip would have done the trick, like compress,
but if it works who am I to disagree.

Now I can run Netscape under the X window manager (browsing the local
help file, etc), but am stumped over how to set up a connection to the
internet.  My experience with communication started with cu and
stopped with uucp (2400 baud modems did not allow much else in the
eighties).  My current gateway to the internet is a Win95/NT box
(System Commander to swap between).  Fortunately for me the set-up
disk provided by the ISP did all the tricky stuff.  I can work out the
proxies and mail and user group bits.  What has me bluffed is the
Linux's equivalent to Win95/NT dialler and getting a dialup link to
the ISP.  Also how do you get Netscape to find the link.  TC/IP is a
mystery to me.

Any help would be appreciated.  Especially pointers to useful
information.  Unfortunately I have spent the last eight years with
Windoze and my brain has slooowed down to MS speed (mighty slow or
stupid).

Thanks for your time.

Regard Brett
