A Reply about multiple ethernet cards from a friend of mine... he had a
problem a bit different, but vaguely similar...

&gt; does this sound familiar?

No, not quite the same problem. I never had *this* problem ;)

&gt; Another problem I'm stuck on - I am trying to run multiple ethernet cards
in

Just out of interest, you might like to know you can give one interface
serveral
ip addresses, and run several quake servers that way (if that is what
you are
trying to do...)

&gt; out quake server -  1 x 3com 3c905, 1 x 3c0m 3c595 (Vortex/Boomerang).
They
&gt; both seem to use the same driver, I'm not sure if this has anything to do
&gt; with it?  Now I thought I had it configured right as the server recognises

I shouldn't think so.

&gt; both cards at boot time.  Once booted, doing an 'ifconfig eth0' and
&gt; 'ifconfig eth1' reports the correct addresses etc.  The problem is when I
&gt; ping the first card it does not respond, pinging the second one does
&gt; respond, then if I change the ip address of the second card, then I can
ping
&gt; the first ip address, but not the second.  The only reference I have found
&gt; is a Multiple ethernet mini-howto which didn't contain the answers (or
maybe
&gt; I don't have any idea!).  If anyone has an idea of what I have done wrong
or
&gt; can point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.  If I
have
&gt; not posted enough info let me know also.

Sounds like you might have a routing table problem. Try the man page for
"route"
Other than that, if things are still going wrong then this is the sort
of info
you will want to include when trying to get help:

/etc/conf.modules
"ifconfig" output
"route -n" output
