Robert Archer said on <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>:
&gt; 1)  Thanks to Geoffrey and Matthew for organising last Thursday - it was 
&gt; kind of cool to actually meet someone you read about in Dr Dobbs :)

I second this, however without diminishing my appreciation for
Netcraft et al, but to give full credit where it's due, thanks
also go to the Australian Unix and Open Systems Users Group (AUUG)
(<A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au">http://www.auug.org.au</A>), who imported Richard into Australia.

For those not in the know, which apparently includes almost everyone
in Adelaide (for shame, he gently chided, that you haven't joined that
worthwhile group) AUUG recently held their Annual Conferrence, and
Richard Stallman was an invited speaker.  It was a great conference, and
incidently hearing Robert T Morris speak (note *the* Robert T Morris, but
his father (Oh, never mind, most of you probably are too young. (Sigh.)))
was even better.  You probably all would have loved his answer to the
question about Y2K compliance of the microcontrollers in America's
nuclear missles, unfortunately it was completely unprintable.  The great
quote of the conference (I mean the one which is printable), coming
from a paper about Windows vs Unix, is that "we have God on our side."
Amusing; but if you think about features, reliability, performance,
availability, size and price, it's true.

Anyway, thankyou to Netcraft *and* AUUG.

Regards,

David Newall
