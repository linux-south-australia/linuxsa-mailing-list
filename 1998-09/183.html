&gt; Okay,
&gt; 
&gt; Let's try this in public.

You're on :-).

BTW, I didn't see any replies to my request for people to email myself
and David if they were sick of this thread.  In fact, a couple of
people seemed interested.  I hope people will at least learn something
new as we battle it out with our rpms, greps, egreps, chroots, and
pipes :-).  I know I've learnt something.

&gt; PAM manual pages:
[proof of existance of pam manual pages snipped]
&gt; bash$ rpm -qpl /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/pam-0.57-2.i386.rpm | grep '\.[1-8]$'
&gt; 
&gt; No output!  And on their own manual pages, what a shame.  Case proved.

I already explained in my last message why the PAM manual pages are
not in the pam RPM.  They are out of date, don't appear to be
maintained anymore, are incomplete, and are in places just plain
wrong.  Are you really advocating that Red Hat include documentation
that is known to be incorrect when they are including alternative
(correct) documentation instead?!

&gt; newstrftime.3 and date.1 from zoneinfo:
[proof snipped]
&gt; I see newstrftime.3 and date.1 in the RPMS, but not in the SRPMS.
&gt; Case proved.

No, it's *not* proved.  I see what you see too, but you ignored my
assertion as to why Red Hat don't include the man page for
newstrftime:

There is no such thing as newstrftime(), therefore of course Red Hat
don't include the man page for it in their RPM.  There is a strftime()
(and man page) though.

How am I meant to argue with you when you don't reply to what I write?

As for date, you are looking in the wrong place.  The version included
in zoneinfo is not used.  Check the sh-utils SRPM and RPM, where
you'll find newer versions of both date.c and date.1.

&gt; chroot.1, hostname.1 and ansi2knr.1 from sh-utils:
[snip proof that chroot.[1c], hostname.[1c], and ansi2knr.[1c] are in
the sh-utils source RPM]
&gt; bash$ rpm -qpl /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/sh-utils-1.16-4.i386.rpm | egrep 'chroot|hostname|ansi2knr'
&gt; 
&gt; No output!  My, my, my.  Case proved.

No, it's *not* proved.  You have ignored my previous responses which
state that the binaries and man pages are in different RPMs to the one
you are currently looking at, and you still continue to argue that the
chroot/hostname/ansi2knr man pages from sh-utils should for some
reason make it into the sh-utils RPM (even though the programs
themselves don't!).

Let's make it really clear what the situation is:

There are (at least) two copies of chroot.c and chroot.1 in the source
RPMs.  One is in sh-utils, and another is in util-linux.  You just
proved that the version of chroot in sh-utils is not used (so of
course the man page won't be in the RPM).  If you look in util-linux,
you'll see both the chroot program and its man page present.

There are (at least) three copies of hostname.c and hostname.1 in the
source RPMs.  One is in sh-utils, another is in util-linux, and yet
another is in net-tools.  You just proved that the version of hostname
in sh-utils is not used (so of course the man page won't be in the
RPM).  If you look in net-tools, you'll see both the hostname program
and its man pages present.

The ansi2knr.c and ansi2knr.1 that you find in the sh-utils source RPM
are just part of the build process for sh-utils, and are not part of
the sh-utils utilities themselves.  The versions of ansi2knr.c and
ansi2knr.1 that you are meant to use can be found in the automake RPM.

I'm puzzled why you have gone to all the trouble of comparing SRPMs
and RPMs to locate "missing" man pages, but you haven't tried typing
(eg.) 'man date', which easily demonstrates that Red Hat have in fact
not forgotten to include the date man page.

&gt; &gt; You need to take more care.  None of the seven examples you mentioned
&gt; &gt; have "missing" man pages.  In each case, either the man pages really
&gt; &gt; are there, or they shouldn't be there.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really unsure what more I can say about levels of care.

Me either.

&gt; It seems that
&gt; seven out of seven examples have been demonstrated to be so.

Let's tally them up:

ncurses: yes, it's strange that the man pages aren't named after the
  functions, but this has nothing to do with Red Hat.

PAM: it would be senseless to include man pages that are wrong when
  there is other (correct) documentation available

newstrftime: it would be senseless to include a man page for a
  function that doesn't exist.

date: the program and its man page are both in the sh-utils RPM.

chroot: the program and its man page are both in the util-linux RPM.

hostname: the program and its man page are both in the net-tools RPM.

ansi2knr: the program and its man page are both in the automake RPM.

&gt; As to your
&gt; assertion that the manual pages shouldn't be there: They *are* there.
&gt; They are in the SRPMS.  They exist.  They were written and Red Hat have
&gt; distributed them.  Red Hat included them in their CD.  They just left them
&gt; out of the pre-built RPM.

Yes that's all correct, but you forgot to mention why they left them
out from the RPMs.  They were left out because either:
- they document a non-existent function,
- they document the wrong version of the corresponding program, or
- they are wrong, and alternative documentation is included instead.

&gt; What happened to standards, particularly the
&gt; one which makes Unix so much better than most of the competitors (namely
&gt; man pages)?

I don't know, but I don't see anything in this thread that has shown
that Red Hat have done anything wrong WRT established Unix standards.
On the contrary, we've shown that Red Hat have at least included man
pages for ncurses, date, chroot, hostname, and ansi2knr.

&gt; &gt; So far you have demonstrated a number of non-problems with Red Hat's
&gt; &gt; QC.  I'm not saying they're perfect, but they're certainly not bad
&gt; &gt; enough to warrant boycotting them.
&gt; 
&gt; Probably you will want to retract your first assertion.

Not at all.

&gt; The second:
&gt; Perhaps that's true.  Indeed I haven't boycotted them.  I'm annoyed,
&gt; and I wish they would be more careful -- manual pages are truly one
&gt; of the wonderful things about Unix and they most certainly are meant
&gt; to be optional in no sense of that word.

I don't think you realise how careful they are.  I believe I've
demonstrated for the particular cases you've pointed out that Red Hat
have been more careful than you have.

&gt; By the way, Geoffrey, I didn't mean to imply that you didn't know how
&gt; to use RPM.   I'm not even sure that I did imply it, however to make
&gt; it perfectly clear: I have every confidence that you are far more skilled
&gt; in the use of RPM than am I, and I deny and reject the proposition that
&gt; you don't know how to use it.

The implication was when you suggested that I was looking in the wrong
place to find out what files were installed from RPMs.  Nevermind; my
unappreciation was only in jest (there was a smiley there).

&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; David, who fears some people might mistake this conversation for hostility,
&gt; and wishes it known that despite a difference of opinion, he holds Geoffrey
&gt; in a high esteem.

Good to know we're still friends.  See you at the meeting tomorrow
night?  :-)
