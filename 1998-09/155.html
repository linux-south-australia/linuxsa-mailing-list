just a note - it might be because the actuall function name is getchar(), wicth getch() being a macro....

"Geoffrey D. Bennett" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:g@netcraft.com.au">g@netcraft.com.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt;&gt; It seems that Red Hat 4.2
&gt;&gt; leaves most of the manual pages out when you do a binary install.
&gt; Really?  What ones?

Just at the moment I'm hard pressed to find an example, although I
assure you they are there.  Given that "man curses" and "man getch"
both said "No manual entry", I assumed this to be such an example;
however closer scrutiny reveals that the manual page for getch is
found by looking for curs_getch.  I won't go overly into the culture
that says you can expect "man 3 getch" to work if "man -k getch" says
"getch(3)".  Certainly had I actually wanted to read that manual page
(rather than just refer to it) I would have found it.

If you really know of no example where the manual page was put
in the SRPMS but not in the RPMS, then ask me and I'll do the
search for you.  Or you might actually know of such cases.  Or you
could accept that they do exist--I know this to be true because I've
stumbled across them before.


&gt; BTW, what is a "binary install"

One which is installed from a binary RPMS, as opposed to an install from
the SRPMS.  It made sense to me...
