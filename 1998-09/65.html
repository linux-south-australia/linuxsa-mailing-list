I have also had the problem Kevin Hancock posted yesterday, although on 
redhat 4.2, running Xfree86 and fvwm95-2 on whatever version the kernel in 
that distribution is.
My machine doesn't run linux 24hrs (unitl i get it using my voicemodem, 
but that's another story) so it doesn't trouble me as much, the only times 
i've experienced it were all-nighters working on programming assignments.
After a few hours,i'd notice that alt-tab (switch focus) would stop 
working, as would a lot of other window functions.
I haven't found a solution, but perhaps we could trace it to a common 
software version or peice of hardware ... to start this going i have a 
pretty much out-of-the box redhat 4.2 install, on an IBM (yuck) 486-100, 
IDE HDD & CDROM,(and now the redeeming features) onboard PCI 
controllers, 64M fp ram,  S3 Virge DX with 2M, SB16, 2nd 16-bit multi IO 
card, NE2000 (a real one)
I have compiled my own kernal, and set the network up (nothing fancy, 
just samba) and that's about it - i just use it for C and C++ programming.

Hope this is of some remote help.
