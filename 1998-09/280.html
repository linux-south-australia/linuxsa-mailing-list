&gt; I did a re-install of my system, changing net-cards to a 3com309 ISA
&gt; combo card. Now my boot times take forever with the machine spending
&gt; around 2 minutes on sendmail. X also takes 2 minutes to load up now,
&gt; when before it used to be very close to instant ( pmmx250, 4meg S3
&gt; virge, 64 megs SDRAM)

The short answer is: you've configured your networking wrong.  Fix it.
:-).

The long answer is:

You have told Linux:
- there's a network card in your computer
- the network card's IP address (192.168.0.83)
- if it needs to look up a hostname, it should contact 192.168.0.1
  (your DNS server)
- your hostname is pmmx.dave

You haven't told Linux:
- what IP address corresponds with pmmx.dave

When SMB and sendmail start, they like to get your hostname, and then
figure out what IP address is associated with that hostname.  So of
course, they try and contact your DNS at 192.168.0.1.  Then they try,
and try, and try again.  For about 2 minutes.

There are at least five solutions I can think of off the top of my
head, but which one is best for you and will cause the least problems
later on depends on:

Is this network connected to anything else?
How is it connected (modem or ethernet)?
Full-time or part-time?
Is there a DNS server that you can use?
What is your machine going to be used for?

The quick and dirty solution is to add your IP address and hostname to
/etc/hosts.

&gt; The boot also locked up for ages on SMB saying something along the lines
&gt; of "cannot find server, change config manually" SMB is currently
&gt; disabled.

Same problem.

&gt; address: 	192.168.0.83
&gt; subnet:		255.255.255.0
&gt; &lt;the other two were as RH 'suggested' ~.1 and ~.254&gt;

Those are just guesses by the install program; it has no way of
knowning what the correct answers are.  You need to put in the correct
values for your installation, otherwise things will go slow.
