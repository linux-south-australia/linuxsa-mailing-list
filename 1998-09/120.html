&gt; To all..
&gt; 
&gt; I have had a couple of interesting experienses talking to the
&gt; Commonwealth Bank
&gt; about it's NetBank software and running it under Linux... to read more,
&gt; see:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.users.on.net/pschulz/netbank">http://www.users.on.net/pschulz/netbank</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially, they only support M$ windows.
&gt; Interesting note.. their software support is done by WANG.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody else had similar experienses?


I have contacted them about CBA NetBank under Linux also.

The reason I received was that the Crypto software is licensed
from overseas only for the Windows platform.

Not letting that deter me...

I have had varying amounts of success using NetBank under WINE.

Up until the most recent snapshot netbank would install, register and 
do everything that is needed as part of the install.  When trying to
run netbank after that, the software authenticatses itself but 
when it tries to bring up the tab based window it dies with a 
'Cannot open empty document'.

In the most recent version of wine (980913) looks like they
have started coding the support for the 'Tab Control' which
looks promising.  Unfortunately the install program doesn't work 
for the downloaded version.

They are getting there.  But aren't there yet.

BTW BankSA internet banking appears to work well under wine.  
Haven't used it though.

Cheers,

Matt
