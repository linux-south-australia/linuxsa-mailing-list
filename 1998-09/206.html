&gt; Are you really advocating that Red Hat include documentation that is
&gt; known to be incorrect when they are including alternative (correct)
&gt; documentation instead?!

If the manual page is part of the source, if it's worth including in
the SRPMS, then yes, I advocate also putting it in the RPMS.  If the
manual page is such a toss then toss it.  This curious idea that man
pages should be discontinued in favour of some different form of
documentation just does not sit well with me.  Man pages work well.
If sometimes they do get out of date the better answer is to update
them, rather than to replace them with a non-compatible format.

But let me repeat my central point: The manual pages are in the source
and so they should also be in the binary.

Issues about newstrftime et al are somewhat irrelevant, and I now admit
that having found the important example (namely PAM) I regret continuing
to look for more examples.  I know there's another one which is as good
an example as PAM, but I have completely forgotten what it is.  What I
did wrong, in my eagerness to find examples, was spend enough time to
find an anomaly that appeared to demonstrate my point, but insufficient
time to actually demonstrate that it was valid.  The man page for
newstrftime is not supposed to be included.  It takes quite close
examination to see why that is so and I didn't spend the time for that
(up front) because the issue is not so interesting to me.  However I
have been dragged (arguably by own making) into spending the time, and
the closer look shows that the manual page is only installed if you ask
to install everything PLUS date; the default install does not install
the timezone date, hence it doesn't install the date man page, nor the
newstrftime man page.  (The interested reader will discover that the
newstrftime man page is apparently intended to be included, but has not
been, probably due to confusion by the timezone maintainer; that is not
Red Hat's fault or problem.)

I also apologise to Andrea Muys for snapping so rudely.  The point that
Andrea was making (and which Geoffrey also was making), is that the date
command isn't included in the binary rpm, so of course the date manual
page also should not be included.  This highlights how a simple analysis
(e.g. the manual page is in the source, why not also in the binary?) can
produce erroneous results.

My confusing the issue with false examples in no way diminishes the
value of my criticism: Red Hat *do* have a reputation for poor quality
control--I only became aware of it when other people pointed it out to
me--and upon reflecting my own experiences, I have an example of it.
PAM manual pages is such an example--slightly out of date is no excuse
in my opinion--and there are others (even if I can't bring them to your
attention.)

I don't want to give the impression that Red Hat are bad people.  They
have provided RPM, which seems well regarded; and they have championed
PAM, which looks to be a good idea.  It's a pity they can't follow the
Unix tradition of good man pages as well as they ought, but it's even
worse that they don't include the manual pages that they have got.
This is the crux of my complaint.

Regards,

David
