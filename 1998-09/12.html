Hi everyone,

Well I gather from all the talk that has bounced
back and forth across LinuxSA that the graphic
design choice has come down to two main
designs.

1) Using the image on the left side of my web page.
Reduce the size of the word "Linux" just a tad so it
is closer to the one used for "Powered" and the top
of the "i" doesn't hit Tux's foot.

2) Same style of image with a "L" instead of a
reverse "L" with the words "Powered by" vertically
and "Linux" horizontally.

This is where we lean on Paul to come through
for us one more time. If he would be nice enough
to produce these for us tonight and get them to
me so I can put them online first thing tomorrow
morning then we can all have a look at the two
and choose the best looking one.

I don't think that anyone would object to giving Paul
a number of free badges as a way of thanking him
for the effort he has put in.

So the word is, check the web page tomorrow
and let us know what you think.

NEWS FLASH...
I have been contacted by someone else who is
interested in offering a couple of designs for
review. I must admit I was a bit hesitant to allow
it this late in the day but they look promising so
they will be on the web page tomorrow when we
will have to make some hard decisions as to
which image to go with.
