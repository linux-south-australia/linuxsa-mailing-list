Hi Guys

I have a few questions for the RedHat people out there.

I have a basic install of Redhat 5.1 and am using the fvwm2 window manager.

When I first start X it works fine but after a few hours (this machine is on 24 hours a day) thinks stop working.

The minimise and maximise buttons do nothing and to swap between applications/windows I need to click on the task bar as clicking on
the window will not activate it.

Is there a cure for this ?

It works fine when x first starts but eventually these little things stop. This make me think it is not a configuration problem but
more of a bug, leak or some thing.

I haven't modified any of my x config files.

Also the time function is screwed up (it won't keep time), I know this is known problem but cannot find the fix. any suggestions?

One last thing any body know where I can get a good HOWTO for smbclient and smbmount? I have read a lot of "this is what you do" and
man pages but when it don't work I have found very little help.

Thanks for any help
