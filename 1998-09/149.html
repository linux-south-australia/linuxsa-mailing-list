&gt; I want to be able to read in any character without waiting for an
&gt; EOL...the equiv function in MS - C is getch()...

This is surprisingly complicated to do in Unix -- at least most people
seem to be surprised when they first find out the answer.  Before I give
the answer I will embark on a lecturette about *how* to find the answer.
As is most often the answer with Unix, the answer is your friend and
mine: man.  We'll use the keyword search option for man (man -k), and
look for manual pages with the keyword, 'character'.  Thus:

   bash$ man -k character
   Tk_SetWindowVisual (3) - change visual characteristics of window
   Unicode (7)          - the unified 16-bit super character set
   addch, waddch, mvaddch, mvwaddch, echochar, wechochar (3) - add a character
       (with attributes) to a curses window, then advance the cursor
   addchstr, addchnstr, waddchstr, waddchnstr, mvaddchstr, mvaddchnstr,
       mvwaddchstr, mvwaddchnstr (3) - add a string of characters (and
       attributes) to a curses window
   addstr, addnstr, waddstr, waddnstr, mvaddstr, mvaddnstr, mvwaddstr,
       mvwaddnstr (3) - add a string of characters to a curses window and
       advance cursor
   ascii (7)            - the ASCII character set encoded in octal, decimal,
       and hexadecimal
   attroff, wattroff, attron, wattron, attrset, wattrset, standend, wstandend,
       standout, wstandout (3) - curses character and window attribute control
       routines
   charsets (4)         - programmer's view of character sets and 
       internationalization
   delch, wdelch, mvdelch, mvwdelch (3) - delete character under the cursor 
       in a curses window
   fgetc, fgets, getc, getchar, gets, ungetc (3) - input of characters and 
       strings
   fputc, fputs, putc, putchar, puts (3) - output of characters and strings
   getch, wgetch, mvgetch, mvwgetch, ungetch (3) - get (or push back) 
       characters from curses terminal keyboard

There's more, but the last one displayed above is the one we want.  If
you're not sure how you were supposed to work that out, the answer is also
simple: start reading *each* manual page.  You'll quickly get a feel for
which ones are wrong (e.g. any page not in section 3).

So there's your answer: one of the getch calls in the curses library.
Don't forget to link your program against the curses library!

If you are curious about why it's not easier: Unix is a multi-user operating
system.  In order to operate more efficiently it tries to buffer I/O.  (Did
you know that the time to read n characters is less related to the size
of n, and more related to the number of read() system calls you use?)
Terminals are line-buffered, so when you call for a single character,
Unix suspends you until a full line has been entered.  (The characters
will be returned to you, one by one, if that's how you ask for them.)

Also: note that manual pages are *never* optional components with Unix.
It's a pity that Red Hat don't realise this.  It seems that Red Hat 4.2
leaves most of the manual pages out when you do a binary install.  This
is a sufficient reason to NOT buy Red Hat.

Regards,

David
