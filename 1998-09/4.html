Nick, (and Linux SA)

Perhaps ALL the badges could be numbered so we can be SURE we are
talking about the same one???

I like the new ones ... except the penguin seems to have put on weight!
He looks fatter to me ... am I seeing things??

Of the new ones, I like the LEFTMOST one on Nick's site ... white
background only.

&gt; OK Everyone
&gt; 
&gt; Let's Get Ready To Rumble!
&gt; 
&gt; I have received a couple of new contenders for the PC
&gt; Badge graphic that I feel are worthy of a good look.
&gt; I have placed them on my web page with a link to Paul's
&gt; so you can see all of his work.
&gt; 
&gt; My comments...
&gt; 
&gt; Paul has put a boarder on his images which although
&gt; do round off the image on the web pages might not look
&gt; so good once in badge form. I have a feeling that the
&gt; edge of the plastic bubble will result in this boarder
&gt; distorting.
&gt; 
&gt; Colour of the boarder aside, I think that either of
&gt; the first two images (which I think are identical) are
&gt; very good and since are so close to the original could
&gt; be used without anyone being upset. (Feel free to
&gt; correct me if I am wrong).
&gt; 
&gt; When I say "close to the original" I should point out
&gt; that Paul has gone to a lot of effort.
&gt;         3D revers "L"
&gt;         Larger writing of "Linux Powered"
&gt;         etc...
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing that I might like to see changed is just
&gt; to give a small gap (1 pixel or so) between the dot over
&gt; the "i" and Tux's foot. It kinda' bugs me the way they
&gt; touch...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway it is now time for comment, and don't delay
&gt; because time is running out. I am looking to place
&gt; the order in about 2 days!!!
&gt; 
&gt; PS. Please forward this email to other groups, HUMBUG,
&gt; LUV, SLUG... (I don't believe that I have been contacted
&gt; by anyone representing SLUG yet...)
&gt; 
&gt; Just in case you have not bookmarked the pages...
