&gt; My dad's school (he's a teacher) is going to spend a few hundred
&gt; (thousand?) dollars buying NT site licences and some sort of server or
&gt; router to allow 30 or so Wintel machines to connect to the internet. The
&gt; school has 2 486-100's (8 ram, 200meg HD, but we can upgrade ram)
&gt; sitting in a cupboard :( and I suggested they use them as routers using
&gt; Linux.
Why upgrade they are wayyyyy over powered for what you want ;) although
more ram wouldn't hurt if you plan on running squid.

&gt; Would a 486 be enough for 30+ clients? I'll have a look at that squid
&gt; site, that's what I should use right? Remember we can use two of them if
&gt; necessary.
there is very little proccessing power actually needed for routing/masqing
all you really need is a few meg of ram for the system and any apps and a
kernel with firewall/masqing suport in. The real question is what layout
is required, do all the machines on the school lan have real IP
addresses (as opposed to reserved IP's)? what services does the school
want to supply teachers/students (just web access or email aswell)?  does
the network have to be firewalled (I recomend this)?  

As a general for a school I would setup a lan with reserved IP's and a box
masqing the network if mail is required you simply setup a machine that
would handle it outside the firewall and the use a cron job to pop it over
on to a hub machine inside the lan on a regular basis. Make all web access
via a squid proxy (that way you can stop access to all those norti sex
sites and other things unsuitable for kiddies) and just be very very
strict with what yuo allow them to do. network layout would look something
like this:


-----------       ------------	 ------------	   ----------    -------
|         |       |  Squid/  |	 |	    |      |  SMTP/ |    |     |
|   LAN   |-------|   Mail   |---| Firewall |------|  Anon  |----| NET |
|         |	  |   hub    |	 |	    |	   |  FTP   |    |     |
-----------	  ------------	 ------------	   ----------    -------

The firewall is so strict the only way to do maintanence is via console
and Idealy it is just a diskless 486 with some ram and a floppy(maybe
LS120) with the kernel, minimal / (including a shell and passwd file) ,
ipfwadm and a firewalling script. THe disk in the drive at any time is a
copy of a master, copies are lowlevel formatted and re-written on a
regular basis and rotated at the same time so that if any manages to crack
the system then they are foiled when the rotation takes place. The anon
ftp incomming dir on the external box is copied across via say an hourly
cron job with mail being poped every 10 or so minutes. The squid/mail hub
machine could be one of the 486DX-100's you mentioned but I'd put at least
64Meg of ram in it and a 2+ Gig HD. All the SMTP/anon ftp box has to have
is lots of HD space for the incoming mail.
