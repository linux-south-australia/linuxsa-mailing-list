&gt; &gt; So it's a bug.  Do something useful -- submit a bug report.
&gt; 
&gt; Curious that you should suggest that.  I did report it, but heard nothing
&gt; from them about it.  Maybe that means they were going to fix the problem
&gt; in the next release (did they?) and just didn't have the time to show me
&gt; the courtesy of saying thank you; I don't know.  At least I tried.

No, Red Hat still haven't put them in the RPM, but I'm retracting my
statement that it's a bug.  There is HTML documentation included in
the RPM, and from comparing it (and the include files) to the man
pages in the SRPM, I've concluded that Red Hat don't include the man
pages in their RPM because the man pages are misleading/out of
date/not maintained anymore/wrong.

For example, look at the definition of pam_strerror.  The definition
of the function in the man page doesn't match the appropriate include
file, but the HTML documentation does.

If they consider it a feature, not a bug (as I now do), this would
also explain why you didn't hear back from them.

&gt; &gt; Is there such a thing as newstrftime()?
&gt; 
&gt; No idea.  However there is a manual page for it in the SRPMS, but not in
&gt; the RPMS.  There are other new* manual pages in both, so I don't think
&gt; it's a mistake.

Let me change my question to an assertion:

There is no such thing as newstrftime(), therefore of course Red Hat
don't include the man page for it in their RPM.  There is a strftime()
(and man page) though.

&gt; &gt; # rpm -ql sh-utils | grep date
&gt; &gt; /bin/date
&gt; &gt; /usr/man/man1/date.1
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if you have installed the SRPMS or the RPMS?  I suspect the
&gt; former.  Before I posted I actually compared the files in RPMS against
&gt; SRPMS.  It is as I said.

Whether I've installed the SRPMS or not is irrelevant; you don't need
to look at them.  Just query the sh-utils RPM, which does have date.1
in there (as Jon confirmed).

&gt; &gt; Your complaint was: "It seems that Red Hat 4.2 leaves most of the
&gt; &gt; manual pages out when you do a binary install.
&gt; 
&gt; "Most" is wrong.  I retract that.  Sometimes even I let my emotion
&gt; get the better of my mouth.  However it most certainly is true that
&gt; Red Hat 4.2 has left some important manual pages out of the binary
&gt; RPMs.

I've seen seven imaginary examples of this so far.  I'm not denying
that there aren't any real ones (I'm sure there are some), but your
examples are not demonstrating any quality control problems on Red
Hat's part.

&gt; &gt; Only one of these examples showed any man pages missing.  I still
&gt; &gt; think your complaint is silly.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if you would do what I did: Don't just search your installed
&gt; RPM database, because it doesn't distinguish between files that came
&gt; from SRPMS versus RPMS.

Of course it does.  SRPMS aren't managed by the RPM database.  When
you do an rpm -i on an SRPM, you just get the source dropped into the
SOURCES and SPECS directories.  You can verify this by doing 'ls -la
/var/lib/rpm', 'rpm -ivh whatever.src.rpm', 'ls -la /var/lib/rpm' and
noting that the timestamps haven't changed.

&gt; Please actually check the source (as I did),
&gt; and then tell me if I'm wrong.

You're wrong.  And you don't need to check the source (as in SRPM?).
Just query the RPM database, or even the binary packages on the CD or
the FTP site if you really want to be certain.

&gt; And if you think I'm wrong, I most
&gt; certainly will present you with checksums, and file listings, of the
&gt; two RPMs, so that we can settle this to our mutual satisfaction.

Sure.  Let me know what happens when you type these three commands:

% # Insert RH4.2 CD
% mount /mnt/cdrom
% cd /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS
% rpm -qpl sh-utils-1.16-4.i386.rpm | grep date
/bin/date
/usr/man/man1/date.1

With similar rpm -q commands, I can find the man pages for chroot,
hostname, and ansi2knr in the same RPMs that the respective commands
are in.

&gt; Not
&gt; that it really matters; nobody cares about this (we could finish this
&gt; off-line if you like)

If anyone's getting sick of this, just email myself and David and
we'll take this offline.  Maybe some people are finding this
discussion interesting/informative/amusing though.

&gt; other than that I don't like being told that I
&gt; make silly complaints, particularly when I have taken great care to
&gt; be certain of my facts.

You need to take more care.  None of the seven examples you mentioned
have "missing" man pages.  In each case, either the man pages really
are there, or they shouldn't be there.

&gt; I also don't appreciate the implication that I criticised without
&gt; trying to fix the problem.  You showed quite a nerve to tell me to
&gt; submit a bug report.

I apologise for implying that you had not submitted a bug report.
That was uncalled for.  Unfortunately, a bit more research would have
shown that it wasn't a problem in the first place.

&gt; Indeed!  And finally a short philosophy: There
&gt; is nothing wrong with being wrong; the wrongness is in being wrong
&gt; but denying it.  This extends to support given to other.  For example,
&gt; you pointed out that most manual pages are in the RPMS; and yes, I
&gt; admitted I was wrong.  Kudos to me for showing integrity.  For another
&gt; example, I claimed that Red Hat has a reputation for quality control
&gt; problems (and demonstrated how that reputation might have been earned).

So far you have demonstrated a number of non-problems with Red Hat's
QC.  I'm not saying they're perfect, but they're certainly not bad
enough to warrant boycotting them.

&gt; David, who agonised over sending this publicly because the thread has
&gt; become boring, but who decided he has a reputation to defend.

Of course.

Geoffrey, who doesn't appreciate the implication that he doesn't know
how to use RPM :-).
