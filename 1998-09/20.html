Hello,

For the Badges, I prefer the Paul #2 to date.

I also like Isaac Topbot, but in this one I think there should be a
Capital "L" for Linux ...

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Well I gather from all the talk that has bounced
&gt; back and forth across LinuxSA that the graphic
&gt; design choice has come down to two main
&gt; designs.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Using the image on the left side of my web page.
&gt; Reduce the size of the word "Linux" just a tad so it
&gt; is closer to the one used for "Powered" and the top
&gt; of the "i" doesn't hit Tux's foot.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Same style of image with a "L" instead of a
&gt; reverse "L" with the words "Powered by" vertically
&gt; and "Linux" horizontally.
&gt; 
&gt; This is where we lean on Paul to come through
&gt; for us one more time. If he would be nice enough
&gt; to produce these for us tonight and get them to
&gt; me so I can put them online first thing tomorrow
&gt; morning then we can all have a look at the two
&gt; and choose the best looking one.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that anyone would object to giving Paul
&gt; a number of free badges as a way of thanking him
&gt; for the effort he has put in.
&gt; 
&gt; So the word is, check the web page tomorrow
&gt; and let us know what you think.
&gt; 
&gt; NEWS FLASH...
&gt; I have been contacted by someone else who is
&gt; interested in offering a couple of designs for
&gt; review. I must admit I was a bit hesitant to allow
&gt; it this late in the day but they look promising so
&gt; they will be on the web page tomorrow when we
&gt; will have to make some hard decisions as to
&gt; which image to go with.
