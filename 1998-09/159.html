This thread is becoming silly,
but I must agree with David in this situation. When I used to have redhat
installed (4.1), i found it seriously lacking in the organisation
department, i.e. missing man pages, man pages that don't match the
default system, and convoluted configuration scripts. (The X11R6 install
comes to mind - there used to be a recursive link, which was really
confusing to a newbie)

Anyway, for those who are interested in alternatives, I've found
debian/GNU quite good. Unfortunately, there appears to be nowhere in
adelaide that will burn a CD for you, so you have to pay extra to get one
shipped here. Netcraft?

Others who are interested in the gory details of unix highly recommend
slackware. I've never tried this tho'

But all in all, theyre free, so what do you expect?

Just my 2c.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just at the moment I'm hard pressed to find an example
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh yes, PAM is such an example.  No man pages in the RPMS at all.
&gt; 
&gt; So it's a bug.  Do something useful -- submit a bug report.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Another is zoneinfo: The pages for newstrftime.3
&gt; 
&gt; Is there such a thing as newstrftime()?  The original tzcode96i.tar.gz
&gt; doesn't seem to have a newstrftime() function, and its 'make install'
&gt; doesn't install the newstrftime.3 man page.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and even date.1
&gt; &gt; are only found in the SRPMS.
&gt; 
&gt; Not in my copy:
&gt; 
&gt; # rpm -ql sh-utils | grep date
&gt; /bin/date
&gt; /usr/man/man1/date.1
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Similarly, in sh-utils, the pages for
&gt; &gt; chroot.1, hostname.1 and ansi2knr.1 cannot be found in the RPMS.
&gt; 
&gt; You must be looking in the wrong RPMs:
&gt; 
&gt; # rpm -ql util-linux | grep chroot
&gt; /usr/man/man8/chroot.8
&gt; /usr/sbin/chroot
&gt; 
&gt; # rpm -ql net-tools | grep hostname
&gt; /bin/hostname
&gt; /usr/man/man1/hostname.1
&gt; 
&gt; # rpm -ql automake | grep ansi2knr
&gt; /usr/share/automake/ansi2knr.1
&gt; /usr/share/automake/ansi2knr.c
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I shall stop wasting my time looking for more examples (although
&gt; &gt; it hasn't taken me so long to find these.)
&gt; 
&gt; Good idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe next time you stumble across a packaging bug, you would care to
&gt; submit a bug report (after making sure it really is a bug).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Red Hat have a reputation for poor quality control.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think such a reputation is deserved, and I think this thread
&gt; shows how they get it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My complaint with regard to manual pages is not "silly".
&gt; 
&gt; Your complaint was: "It seems that Red Hat 4.2 leaves most of the
&gt; manual pages out when you do a binary install."  You've given seven
&gt; examples: ncurses, pam, newstrftime, date, chroot, hostname, and
&gt; ansi2knr.  Only one of these examples showed any man pages missing.  I
&gt; still think your complaint is silly.
