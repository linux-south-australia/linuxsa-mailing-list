Hi Everyone,

&gt; &gt; Not that it really matters; nobody cares about this (we could finish
	&gt; this off-line if you like)

&gt; If anyone's getting sick of this, just email myself and David and
&gt; we'll take this offline.  Maybe some people are finding this
&gt; discussion interesting/informative/amusing though.
&gt; 
First of all, I am not proclaiming my self the spokesman
of the silent masses but I would be surprised if there
were not many people who felt the same way that I do.

I am finding this little discussion (flame war) extremely
interesting. It is giving me the opportunity to listen to a
discussion about a topic that interests me, but that my
knowledge (or lack there of - "glorified user status") does
not allow me to participate in, but does allow me to follow.

I started with slackware back in 1993 but moved to RedHat
with V4.0 and since then I must admit that I have not payed
much attention to other releases. This is why I find this
"discussion" of supposed pros/cons of RedHat so interesting.

In my general experience I have found that over the last 6
years the man pages are steadily being left behind and going
out of date. The Unix community seems to be moving away
(forgetting about) man pages which saddens me since it is
one of the truly great things about Unix. But I would rather
not find a man page (which would make me go in search of
other documentation) than find one that is so out of date that
it misleads me or wastes my time in reading it. If this is
the motivation that is behind RedHat removing man pages
from packages then even though I do not like it, I can
appreciate it. Of course in a perfect world RedHat would be
able to adopt the documentation side off all packages that
are distributed on their CD's but reality prevents this and as
a result they are only able to make a judgement on what is
the best documentation available and supply that instead.

Will Linux become the dominating unix? Quite probably...
Will RedHat ever become the MS of the Linux world?
I doubt it, for more reasons than I could ever hope to explain.

When it comes down to it, RedHat is a company, they need
to make money to stay in business and to make money they
need distribution. Unlike others, they have chosen to do
this by providing a "quality" product as apposed to
manipulating the market. In order to make this "quality"
product they have had to not so much alter, but add to
Linux to turn it from a enthusiast only OS into a marketable
product.

Basically at the end of the day I don't care which distribution
become dominant. I don't even care if Linux is ever taken
seriously as a commercially viable OS. But what I do care
about is that Linux grows to become a useable, realistic
and viable alternative to Windows, which in the real world
it cannot do without having at least one dominant and
commercially accepted distribution. 

Thanks for listening, all comments, rants and flames welcome.

Nick Stock
