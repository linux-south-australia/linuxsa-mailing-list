Hi again

Lets start with a no. 1. I didn't realize I would get as much helpful
response as I did, so thanks to those for replying with information

2. Plain text for the mailing list has now been established.. sorry to
those who were affected.

3. Let's try my question again...

Ok, I'm assuming it's my box being a pain in the ass...

My link to Adam internet died with the Telstra unscheduled outage
Tuesday. Upon trying to reconnect my box wouldn't. I connected via my XP
box.. so that's all good... but I thought I'd update from 7.3 to 8 while
I had a good excuse to do so.

Anyway.. it's still doing the same thing...

Here is all the information I can pull:

/var/log/messages snippit

While link is down:

Note: You have enabled demand-connection; adsl-status may be inaccurate.
adsl-status: Link is down (can't read pppoe PID file
/var/run/pppoe-adsl.pid.pppoe)
(apparently normal because the pid file is only generated after the
service is activated)

While link it trying to become active:

Note: You have enabled demand-connection; adsl-status may be inaccurate.
adsl-status: Link is attached to ppp0, but ppp0 is down

Less relevant is the fact that I asked it NOT to connect on demand,
however it says otherwise.

The error message I get after connection has timed out is:

/sbin/adsl-start: line 217: 15558 Terminated              $CONNECT "$@"
&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1

In the event that it helps, yes I am running this through eth0
The modem is plugged into the uplink port of the switch and the linux
box connects through that, and the other computers just hide behind it.

I did have this running with a 1 network card set-up before. It has been
suggested to me to use 2. I've decided not to. Personally I think that
it made the whole setup easier.

Anyway... again, thanks to those who sent replies, and I hope you can be
of more assistance armed with this information.

Thanks again

Todd
