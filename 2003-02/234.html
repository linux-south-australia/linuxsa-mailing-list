&gt; 
&gt; while on this topic, what does everyone else do with the spam they detect??
&gt; i'm filtering mine to another mailbox and at the moment chcking it to make
&gt; sure nothing real is going there as i've only just set it up.  there is an
&gt; option to bounce the message back which i originally thought mean create a
&gt; non-delivery bounce message that looks like the mailbox doesn't exist.  but
&gt; it sends back some woffle (by default, obviously you can change the wording)
&gt; saying you naughty people stop it, or we'll report you to your ISP.    does
&gt; anybody see the benefit of doing this because most of the time spammers fake
&gt; their return address and your outgoing mail queue gradually fills full of
&gt; rubbish.  :(

i filter mine to two boxes based on the rating spamassassin gives it. the
box that takes emails rated 5-10 i check once a day for false positives. the
other box that takes anything 10 or over i only check once a month.

your right, there isn't much point in bouncing the emails due to the forged
return addresses.

i used to go to the trouble of reporting each spam to the owner of the IP
block that sent or relayed it, but it became too tedious. anyone know of any
tools that automate crafting spam complaints?
