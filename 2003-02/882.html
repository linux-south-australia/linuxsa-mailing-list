[oh this is amusing]


Daniel,

&gt; Well you just showed you have some scripting skills.. what about
&gt; programming?

*sigh*

&gt; You wrote a perl script that returns 1 on succes? I think that sums up
&gt; your programming skills pretty well. I don't worry about scripting
&gt; languages, but last time I checked, it was traditional to return zero on
&gt; succes.. correct me if I'm wrong...

No, it wasn't successful. You didn't understand the gist of the script or
program, but that's not my problem. It wasn't supposed to be
successful...

&gt; Vague knowledge of a few languages does not make you a programmer. You
&gt; have shown yourself to be a script kiddy, which was never doubted. So go
&gt; back to your tinker toys, script kiddy.

LOL

Are we resorting to name calling now?
