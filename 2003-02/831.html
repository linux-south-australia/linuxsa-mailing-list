Hey Vile,

Is this computer you are installing linux on your only computer, or is it a
dual-boot?

How bout you boot it, and then tell us (the list) what errors you see. - Copy the
errors as accurately as you can into the email.

The first error message that comes on screen is usually the best place to start,
not the last one.

This way, linuxsa can help you nail the problems one by one, and you'll be up and
running in the shortest time. 

Can you start by describing the hardware - what CPU, memory, Hard Disk and
netcard. This makes it easier for anyone taking the time to help to get started.

Good luck,

Michael

&gt; well since everyone else is voceing an opinion here's my try.
&gt; 
&gt; i have never got a linux system to work. dont critisie i have tryed more
&gt; than one distro and even a copy (which worked for my tafe lectruer)of redhat
&gt; 8 refuses to work for me.
&gt; 
&gt; my 60 odd dollar linux for dummies book is as good as useless it trys to
&gt; cover everything that could happen. but when the installation went strange
&gt; and gave me options that arnt in the book.
&gt; 
&gt; i took a computer to last installfest and no one could get my (was at the
&gt; time 7.1) distro of redhat to recognise the network card.
&gt; 
&gt; Ryan eventually shoved his own version of debian with a nice big button for
&gt; me to push and opertunies to expand.. only to bring the computer home
&gt; (300k's) and it not boot and give me several several pages of errors.
&gt; 
&gt; there are only so many times someone can take before giving up.. tho i will
&gt; admit im waiting to come down and get ryan to fix another 3 box's for me
&gt; (havent asked him yet) so i havent yet givin up on linux but surely u can
&gt; see that there is another prespective other than people who see how great an
&gt; operating system linux is.
&gt; 
&gt; "life is strange yes life is"
