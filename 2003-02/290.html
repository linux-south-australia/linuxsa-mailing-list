&gt; &gt;Sounds like they just need to block or drop packets at the network
&gt; &gt;perimeter sourced from from OS (the bulk of their traffic) and wait it
&gt; &gt;out.
&gt; 
&gt; We've already tried that.  We dropped over 10,000pps.  If we're
&gt; right about the cause, then the drops will occur for the next
&gt; 5-10 years.  Not where we want to be.

Fair enough, I wouldn't want that on my network (or bill) either! But, how will
closing or moving the service to another IP, or require authentication fix this
issue? Won't the incoming traffic occur with or without the NTP server present?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Of course, if they want to take down the public service for Australian
&gt; &gt;users based on abuse of the service by unknown overseas users, this is
&gt; &gt;as good an excuse as any, why don't they just say so.
&gt; 
&gt; Hang on.  People are going to great lengths *not* to do this.
&gt; And you're assuming the "abuse" is a deliberate act be users,
&gt; not a design and coding error by manufacturers.

Ok. I accept that. I was thinking of abuse = putting in place a system that would
place a huge load on an Australian NTP service from the other side of the world,
regardless of the nature of the device/software and whether there was a concious
act by an end user.

Would it be possible to negotiate to have the other ends of the pipe blocked? eg.
at the entrance to the links OS, have NTP packets bound for the server's IP
blocked/dropped whatever? Or can the problem be handled in DNS?
