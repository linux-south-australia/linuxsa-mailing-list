&gt; &gt; I think what the original poster was aluding to, was that 
&gt; he pays for 
&gt; &gt; a meg of traffic, even if the ISP compresses that meg and 
&gt; picks up the 
&gt; &gt; lower charge.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, which is what I'm talking about; it's a quagmire.

No it's not. It's simple. You pay for the bandwidth you use. If you
compress your 7CDs into 10Mb, then send that over your link (as email or
ftp or whatever), then, unless your ISP is odd (or you pay per hour
rather than per meg -- but that's a red herring), you'll get charged for
the 10Mb. If you send the 7CDs uncompressed, and that makes (say) 4Gb,
then you'll get charged for 4Gb. If the ISP takes your 4Gb and uses
their magical compression on this, then they get the benefit of using
their compression. Whoopee -- you still sent 4Gb, even if the ISP only
sent 10Mb because of it, and you still get charged for what you sent.
It's just like HTTP caching. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As far as I am concerned, good luck to the ISP! I should have 
&gt; &gt; compressed the data myself!
&gt; 
&gt; lol
&gt; 
&gt; And given the way that compression algorithms stack (i.e. 
&gt; generally badly), that might actually make the ISP's costs go UP.

It may well, but that's an issue for the ISP. As far as you are
concerned it is simple, and not a quagmire at all.

I have no idea why this conversation appears so complex. It's simple.

Ah, that explains it ;)
