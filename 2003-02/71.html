Mike,

&gt; I have any application were I would like to be a to reverse a file
&gt; system back to its original state.
&gt; 
&gt; The UML block driver which has a feature called COW (copy-on-write)
&gt; this feature is perfect for what I need to do, but UML is much to slow
&gt; for my requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; Does any one know of any file system or block driver with these
&gt; features which is available for a current kernel (2.4.19&gt;)

I think you want a tool to revert a file system back to its original
state. 

However, might I say, I can't really understand your message [it fails
all my grammar checks miserably].

So:

 1) What is it you want to do?

;-P
