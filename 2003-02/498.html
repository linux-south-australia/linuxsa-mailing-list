As other people have now pointed out, your box is probably configured as an 
"open relay", and will happily accept mail from all and sundry (in this case 
"all and sundry" being some heinous spammer) on the internet, and forward it 
to anyone (in this case many poor spam recipients).

Once you have updated sendmail, collected and implemented all the tips, and 
think that you have closed up the hole, try telneting to:

relay-test.mail-abuse.org

from the mail server. It will trigger the open relay tester at mail-abuse.org 
to run an range of open relay tests against your box. If configured 
correctly, your mail server should pass all tests. 

If you fail a test, it is probable that you are still vulnerale to being a 
forwarder for spam, and other unwanted mail. I say "probable" because there 
are some semi-rare circumstances where your machine may apparently accept 
relay mail at test time, but then reject it later (for example if it is the 
front-end to a larger network of mail servers, and does not "know" all 
adresses/domains on the network at mail accept time).

However under most circumstances if it says you are an open relay, it is 
probably correct.

It is (naturally) platform agnostic, so the test can be equally applied to an 
Exchange or Notes SMTP server also.
