&gt; From my experience, I can't speak for the other Visual's... but VC is a
&gt; brialliant IDE... 
&gt; They all look the same to me. Tried Borland?

Only an old version of Turbo C++... I think it was 3. I'd rather forget small,tiny, large and huge models :-)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But seriously, I used to think it was a brilliant program, until I started
&gt; discovereing the bugs. Imagine what it feels like to spend 6 months
&gt; doubting your own code (doubting yourself), to find out it was the compiler
&gt; all along. 
&gt; Well in my case it's usually the programmer :(

Only because there isnt a body governing the direction of VB, that Microsoft can go against.

&gt; &gt;Fortunately I had used the DOS port of GCC before I used MSVC, so
&gt; eventually I decided that it wasn't my fault, that it was Microsofts (which
&gt; I later proved to be true). 
&gt; 
&gt; What was the error?

First it was strcmp randomly returning data of type NULL causing crashes (don't ask me how a function that returns int can return type NULL data), then it was destructors of classes that were derived from  virtual classes not being called... and assignment's being treated as bools... then I ported it to linux/gcc and life has been good. Except when I load MSVC to make sure it still compiles on windows.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well the VB5/6 is fairly straight forward and undemanding (for me anyway)
&gt; their VB.NET sucks for a number of reasons.

Yeah... your just lucky Microsoft completely control thier implementation of Visual Basic... C/C++ has international standards to conform to... which of course MS thinks they can rewrite at will.
Mind you, BASIC basic was flawed from the beginning... there was very little compatibility between, for example, C64 basic and IBM's implementation of BASIC (IIRC BASICA), and MS kept on re-writting thier version of basic (remember gwbasic, qbasic, quickbasic, etc)

Well actually.. judging by your comments about VB.NET it seems Microsoft can't even conform to thier own standards
