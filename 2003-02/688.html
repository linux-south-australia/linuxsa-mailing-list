&gt; What a shame you didn't respond to my message of last week reminding 
&gt; folks that businesses had until 11 February to apply for up to $500 of 
&gt; training funding. Your courses sound like they would have been eligible 
&gt; and probably quite helpful to a number of businesses like mine.
&gt;

Good news, sort of. The deadline has been extended. This just came in to 
my mailbox today;
"For your information..the Ticket to Training program deadline has been 
extended...applications officially close Friday 14th February, but 
applications may still be accepted after this time, as funds may still be 
available.
 
Specifically, the program provides $500 for small business to spend on 
training and is aimed at businesses with 15 or less employees OR whose 
wage bill does not exceed $450,000.  
 
An information sheet and application form is attached.  Complete the 
application form and fax direct to 8226 2366.  To take advantage of this 
program, ensure your application is lodged as soon as possible.  For 
further information on this program, please contact:
 
Ticket to Training, VET Contract Management

"

I would urge any business thinking of taking up the offer to get in touch 
with Silvana very quickly and see just what help is available.

Still not enough help to get me some Linux Training but hey, I will keep 
my eyes open for future opportunities.

Cheers,  Ian
