&gt; but that's the exact problem with

Again there seems to be a need for clarification. I am not trying to 
set up a Wireless Community group such as AirStream. Please be sure you 
are not mistaking my project for their goals.

My project uses wireless for the interconnection between client 
services and their community centres and the Internet. There is a small 
part of the project defined on using wireless for this. Other equally 
important facets of the project are the community capacity building, 
education, lifelong learning, learning culture etc.

None of these elements feature in the goals of other community wireless 
proponents. My project is also geographically limited to the City of 
Salisbury and the City of Playford as that is where the funding from 
Sustainable Regions is directing their resources.

I am not a member of AirStream nor any other community wireless group 
though that may change as I develop the project further. 

&gt; It's the prime reason they're going nowhere quick :-(
&gt;
My project has nothing to do with any perceptions about community 
wireless groups in Adelaide but if this project gets up and running I 
hope to be able to assist community wireless expand into the Northern 
suburbs. I also hope to have ways that community wireless supporters 
can assist in the development of my project.

Please be clear that this project and community wireless groups have 
nothing in common other than using the same the transmission medium and 
a belief that community wireless can be a viable medium for community 
networks.

Cheers,  Ian
