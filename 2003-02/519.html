List,

I managed to wrangle a copy of MD9 from friend and thought I'd give it a
bash having made all this room on my primary drive thanks to a new 120gb WD
I found I had 2 drives spare. Anyway I had RH on partitioned drive (hdc2)
not having a need for hdc1 I thought I'd stick mandrake on that. Using the
same swap I setup md9 to be mounted / on 1 big partition (yeah yeah I know
not the done thing)

So after finally giving up on the text based install (I got sick of tabbing
to ok etc) I managed to get a form of Md9 installed. I chose KDE as my
primary WM and played around with it. I mounted the RH partition transfered
the extra packages I had added to RH 8.0 jvm etc.

I found Md to be MUCH more responsive than RH in both HDE and GNOME. I
found the I was able to navigate through the configs etc. MD also told me
to run sndconfig whereas RH never did (it was a readme entry somewhere) and
I had to load the package seperately. Also RH decided to not ask me what to
call my machine and gave it the generic localhost. (this may have been a
click too fast and missed the prompt)

In summary I found MD9 to be more of what I wanted RH8 to be ie a BETTER
version of RH6.1. 

this is all very superficial and I only played with it for a couple of
hours but I was wondering if anyone else had any comments about these 2
distro versions specifically side by side.

Evan
