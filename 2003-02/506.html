Ian,

&gt; &gt; Your project is NOT to create a wireless community network. It is to
&gt; &gt; link a number of discrete points together.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; No, we seem to have some confusion here.

I don't think we have any confusion at all really.

&gt; &gt; I think you'll get more reliability by using the
&gt; &gt; current copper infrastructure 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; No, don't want that, don't want anything close to that

Did I mention that it's probably less expensive as well?

&gt; So how different is that concept from what I am suggesting? You have
&gt; me confused as to your definition, and what your point is.

You are setting up a number of fixed access points at particular places.
A network if you will.

&gt; If I am using a tower with an omni on top to broadcast and receive a 
&gt; signal across an area, and there are several (8-10) of these towers
&gt; and areas linked so that we have a network spread across the City of 
&gt; Salisbury and the City of Playford isn't that a wireless network?
