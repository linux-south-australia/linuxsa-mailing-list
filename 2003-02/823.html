well since everyone else is voceing an opinion here's my try.

i have never got a linux system to work. dont critisie i have tryed more
than one distro and even a copy (which worked for my tafe lectruer)of redhat
8 refuses to work for me.

my 60 odd dollar linux for dummies book is as good as useless it trys to
cover everything that could happen. but when the installation went strange
and gave me options that arnt in the book.

i took a computer to last installfest and no one could get my (was at the
time 7.1) distro of redhat to recognise the network card.

Ryan eventually shoved his own version of debian with a nice big button for
me to push and opertunies to expand.. only to bring the computer home
(300k's) and it not boot and give me several several pages of errors.

there are only so many times someone can take before giving up.. tho i will
admit im waiting to come down and get ryan to fix another 3 box's for me
(havent asked him yet) so i havent yet givin up on linux but surely u can
see that there is another prespective other than people who see how great an
operating system linux is.
