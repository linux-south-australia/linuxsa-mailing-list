Hey Richard,

&gt; I have a new phone (end of contract, new plan, free phone (6610), etc),
&gt; and it has, among other things, GPRS. Does this give my phone an IP
&gt; address on the Internet? Can I do Internetty kind of things on my phone,
&gt; or is it just WAP? I can't find much other than WAP at present, but it's
&gt; got a lot of functionality, and I can add to this by downloading Java
&gt; apps as well (ooer). So, any ideas, comments? Anyone got a link or a
&gt; brief explanation as to what exactly GPRS is (at the network level
&gt; rather than the physical or link levels)? Can I ssh from my phone?

I've used GPRS on my phone. Basically you set the phone up as a modem
still, set up a ppp connection as per usual - but the phone number you put
in is *99* and you leave the username and password field blank.

I am not sure about what IP you get, I would presume that it's assigned by
the provider - and it would depend on the provider whether they give you a
real one or they NAT you. GPRS is mainly marketed towards WAP, which is
really only a web browser... Why do you need a whole IP just for one port?

Using GPRS from the computer as a PPP link however, the whole lot works
(well, I tried Outlook Express and ICQ and they both worked)

The best thing would be to try it and see what happens.

Regards
DR
