&gt;I have been pitching this idea since 2000 and most of the right people have 
&gt;heard about it and support it. Now that we are into the definition and detail 
&gt;mode and now that we have the opportunity of community groups with 
&gt;demonstrated expertise (which we didn't have in 2000) then I can pitch to the 
&gt;list to see what information and support is available.
&gt;
&gt;The network cannot just "appear". It has to be set up with support and 
&gt;approval of the authorities, property owners and stakeholders and will take 
&gt;much more than just a community group of wireless hobbyists to make happen.
&gt;

If we ignore David for the moment and instead of picking on Ians email, 
we look at the proposal as a "cry for help". We as good netizens and 
LinuxSA-ers are usually only too happy to help and provide advice ;) 
 (some may read this as free consultancy ;))

Ian,
Your concept is doable with current technology. Yes, but it depends. 
(Doesnt it always) However, there are many factors that come into play 
when your considering using wireless technology.  I would say that one 
of the first things to do is to identify your primary and secondary 
sites (as many as possible anyway) and verify line-of-sight (LOS) and 
distance. Taking things like the  clear LOS(freznel zone included),  
distances, noise and free space loss (FSL) into consideration. The 
hardware must be matched/tuned from the card or access point (AP) to the 
cable lengths and antenna used. Calculations to get it close, then to 
the real world testing, where things like reflections and such introduce 
interesting twists.

This is a fairly lengthy process that will need to be considered for 
every link. This just gets the backbone links ready. Then other issues 
like routing interfaces, routing protocols,  network design and extra 
interfaces for the omni local AP network. All this including security 
considerations. Time for setup and testing. Standards and policy. 
Accounting for billing ... etc. etc. etc.

This to me sounded more like the kind of information you were looking 
for. Of course, this is just some things that need to be taken care of. 
Hardware AP's or free-os based AP's with mutliple cards in them are 
other choices to be made. Most of this may also be included in the many 
howtos out on the net but nothing can replace experience (not that I 
have lot with wireless but it grows daily)

This sounds like an interesting undertaking, no doubt about it. It would 
seem you need a little more technical assistance to just finalise things 
and get the ball rolling.

I'd be willing to help in anyway I can to promote wireless networks 
north of Adelaide, ;) its in my interest to do so. :) (being north of 
Virginia myself)

I'm learning more and more about this wireless stuff everyday, the best 
way to keep that investment is to share it.

Regards,
Brandon Johnson
