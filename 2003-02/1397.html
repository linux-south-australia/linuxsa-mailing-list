Ok, anyone who thinks that a book is their knowledge of a language is obviously a fool. The books are the starting point to start reading real code. But I thought that was common knowledge. I lucked out with the ones I brought, though I certainly know what you mean... the linux programming in 24hrs one doesnt even class as material for my kitty litter tray. Andre LaMothes "tips and tricks on the windows game programming guru's" which is published by sams is quite good. Though the majority of their books are average at best.
Anyone who thinks a book is anything but a starting point is critically broken. I wont listen to any programmer who wont back themselves up with code... I'll read what they code and judge for myself. Funny how of all the coders on this list, I'm the only one with code freely available, Yet all you closed source programmers are all to happy to slag me off with no backup of your skills. Maybe I missed your opensource homepage. URL's anyone?

Show me the code.. until you do, well I don't need to say anymore. Chris is the only one with any backup, and its not much. Sorry Mr Yeoh I couldn't find specifically what you contributed to Samba, though you get the benefit of any doubt, that email address is credit enough, though I would like to see what your responsible for please.
