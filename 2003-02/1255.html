You ought not to think of it as winning or losing, however since you
asked me what I think about your previous work: Well of course most of
your projects are not presented with source.

In your listrot program you display error messages on stdout instead of
stderr, which is rather bad form.  You also assume any file with "BMP"
in it's name is a windows bmp file, and you truncate the name after
the "P".  More importantly, you make only the most token of efforts at
validating user input.  Should the file specified by the user (on the
command line) have, say, only one line, your program wanders off into
la-la land looking for line terminators that never appear.

As a matter of style I think it's better to define local functions above
where they are called, rather than to pre-declare them and then define
them later.  That is:

   void do_work(){...}
   main() { ...; do_work(); ... }

is better than:

   void do_work();
   main() { ...; do_work(); ... }
   void do_work(){...}

Also, you really should declare all global identifiers static unless you
want them to appear outside the scope of the compiland.  I've previously
fought with libraries which gratuitously exposed their inner functions,
and now I say: Everything static unless you really want it available
externally.

Look, that's more than enough for a very quick look.
