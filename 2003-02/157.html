Hi James,

* James Leone &lt;<A HREF="mailto:linuxcpa@netscape.net">linuxcpa@netscape.net</A>&gt; [2003-02-05 12:47]:
&gt; Hi Michael  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It's innovative because Lindows is CHARGING for it. Clearly some people 
&gt; &gt;want this
&gt; &gt;'convenience', but IMO it would suck if the C&R installs opensource stuff 
&gt; &gt;that is
&gt; &gt;free with any distro and you have to pay for the privelege. Is that the 
&gt; &gt;case?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I often think of fairness questions when it comes to Lindows and most 
&gt; other distributions for that matter. I know how the GPL reads, but I am 
&gt; thinking on a "fairness" level here.

I agree, and have no problem with the fairnes concept you propose, but
the problem is that many users will not pay when there is an option. I
remember  seeing that CD service (was it Karun?) who offerred lots of
linux distibutions and optional donations to the cause for each order; I
wonder how many donations were processed?

&gt; 
&gt; When I think of a business, I think of the costs incurred to produce 
&gt; revenue generating goods and services. I think of the importance of 
&gt; managing these costs and the importance of making a connection between 
&gt; the costs and revenue through budgeting.

All important stuff, but they come immediately after the business plan.
If the 'value-add' of your service is easily circumvented, or the
perception of value is not shared by your target market, it's all for
nix. (this is not a comment on Lindows, I don't really have an opinion,
except that it doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in)

&gt; 
&gt; Just to isolate the issue, Transmeta pays for Linus' salary, but many 
&gt; companies and people reap the benefit from it. On the other hand, how 
&gt; much of Linus' benefit Transmeta?  Lets say AMD paid its own "Linus" and 
&gt; many other companies and people reaped the benefit from it. On the other 
&gt; hand, lets say that the benefit for AMD was questionable.  However, lets 
&gt; also assume that AMD benefitted greatly from Linus' work, and Transmeta 
&gt; benefitted greatly from AMD's 'Linus.'  Does the fact that both 
&gt; companies come out even make it fair, or is it unfair that still other 
&gt; companies are not paying for part of the cost as well? What if AMD's 
&gt; Linus gets lazy? What could Transmeta do to get AMD's Linus back into shape?
&gt; 

See the above comment on value add. These are businesses, not charities.
Sponsoring a 'Linus' will be part of the business or marketing plan. If
the business doesn't see value from their sponsorship, they will reduce
or cancel it unless they are investing 'for the greater good' which is
great if they have deep pockets! :)

&gt; Same questions of fairness goes through my head when it comes to 
&gt; Lindows. They are leveraging something that they partially paid for, yet 
&gt; have not gained a marketing advantage by developing wine. (Assuming that 
&gt; they invested a large amount of money into it.)

I guess I disagree with the wine focus at Lindows then. It's not on my
list of things Linux has to do well to be successful. That's not to say
that the wine work is bad or misguided, just that I believe Linux should
stand on it's own without Windows application execution capability.
Plenty of people would disagree with me on this though.

If Lindows can carve out a market from Linux - wine - C&R and have a
successful business at it, all power to them.

&gt; 
&gt; I don't know how to answer these questions, but I sure think about them.

Yea. me too.
&gt; 
&gt; James Leone

Michael
