&gt; Show me the code.. until you do, well I don't need to say anymore. Chris is the only one with any backup, and its not much. Sorry Mr Yeoh I couldn't find specifically what you contributed to Samba, though you get the benefit of any doubt, that email address is credit enough, though I would like to see what your responsible for please.


I'll vouch for Chris in your silly little game. A number of
organisations I've worked for have been much better off as a direct
result of Chris' involvement in the Samba team (and probably other
projects around the place too). In fact, you owe a great deal of thanks
to a number of people who have graced this list with their presence :-).
Both coders and otherwise.

I don't know whether Chris has direct CVS commit access to the Samba
tree, or whether he passes patches on to Tridge or JRA, but you could
probably start by looking at both the Samba-technical and Samba-CVS
mailing list archives at samba.org

I hope that this helps,
Matt
