I'd agree RH8 feels very slow and unresponsive.  It may have just been my 
setup (duron 1100, voodoo3, sblive, 256mb ram) or may have needed extra 
tweaking once installed (which wasn't necessary with md9 or suse 8.1 on the 
same box).

I found that some KDE options are missing in RH8 (RH is very biased towards 
gnome, since they contribute to gnome's development), the kde menus have been 
modified (they 'look' like gnome menus - not talking about the menu items 
themselves), the install wouldn't recognise my keyboard in some places - had 
to click multiple times on a text field and after a while it would work.
The biggest problem I had was that RH8 didn't even recognise my 16mb 3dfx 
voodoo3 ?!  This is probably why the system was running slow....but wasn't 
this one of (if not _the_) most popular video cards some years back?

In contrast, I found md9 to be very responsive.  The md9 installer is still my 
favourite out of any linux distro.  Md9 seems very unbiased.  KDE is 
essentially unmodified - so it looks how the KDE developers wanted it to 
look.  Gnome 2 is also fairly vanilla...though i'm a kde user since gnome 
doesn't have nearly as many features and i love the eye candy in kde3!
The main thing i've noticed with mandrake distros in general is they're not as 
'polished' (think 'error-free') as others.  I've used mandrake since version 
8.0 and the thing that annoyed me most is that quite a lot of linux apps give 
compile errors when compiling from source.  I'm pretty sure rh8 is very good 
in this department though.

That said, I use SuSE 8.1 pro and i'm very happy with it.  The quality of the 
system is top notch and it is evident they spent a lot of time making sure 
everything in the whole system works just so.  It does have a few niggles but 
on the whole it is still very much my distro of choice between the three I've 
mentioned.  Obviously I'm only commenting on what these distros are like as a 
desktop machine.

Each distro does a few things differently so in the end its a matter of 
preference.  I'd choose md9 over rh8 but then i'm biased.  After using rh8 
for the few minutes it was on my system i got the impression rh is trying to 
make kde look like gnome - and i'd rather a system where kde is kde (ie. as 
downloaded from kde.org - no mods) and where i'm not tied down to another 
company's preferences on look and feel... :-) 
(needless to say i stay very clear of winxp)

Just my 2 bob.

-Steve.
