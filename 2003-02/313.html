Ian,


&gt; Why would anybody be attending an open day when there isn't a single 
&gt; word about it other than a 'watch-this-space' mention?

I corrected my lapse as soon as I realised what I had missed out. I
didn't realise what was wrong because I didn't pick up Brian's sense of
humour straight away until I read the e-mail twice.

&gt; The mention needs to be out in the open so folks who are interested 
&gt; know about it. Brian is right, *you* didn't mention the venue in your 
&gt; original post AND the site doesn't mention the Open Day except as 
&gt; something coming up soon. 

 Date:   Saturday 22 February
 Time:   11AM - 04PM
 Venue:  Parkside Primary School, Glen Osmond Road, Parkside

&gt; Maybe the same time as the Open Day was decided somebody could have 
&gt; made a 2 minute amendment to the page just to reflect the event you
&gt; are publicising? 

Hindsight has 20/20 vision.

&gt; Hell, that would be even easier than picking on Brian for pointing out
&gt; your own lapse &lt;G,D&RVF&gt;

Is this really productive? The point is that there IS and WILL BE an
open day and that Air-Stream is committed to creating a community
wireless network for everyone.
