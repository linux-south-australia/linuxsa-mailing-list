Admittedly there have been numerous discussions on linuxsa and
a zillion other forums about re-using aged computers - giving them
a new life with linux.
But what if you have an old computer that is really cactus?

Example: my old Sun SLC whose screen has gone blank for the last time.
Probably the CPU in it is fine (but only about 13 Mips).
Probably the old memory in it fine. 
Maybe there other little bits and pieces of electronics which still work.
It still has its impressive 20-inch cubic packing box (probably the
most useful bit right now).
And it has a cable that could be cut off and used for some dodgy
amateur electrical work.

Is there anything that can be done with such an old never-to-work-again
dinosaur apart from taking it to the dump?
(It won't fit in a wheely-bin.)

I realise that this particular old computer never ran linux, but my
current 10 linux PCs will all turn to cactus some day, and it would be
nice to plan for "when the need arises" as they say in the cactus industry.

In the olden days, I remember I used to go to a place called something
like Elizabeth Disposals where they sold off a whole warehouse full of
ex-air-force redundant electronics from WW2. (This was the 1960s.)
But nowadays, I kind of think that any hobbyist would trun up their noses
at old obsolete electronics.

So...  is there a better alternative than the dump?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
