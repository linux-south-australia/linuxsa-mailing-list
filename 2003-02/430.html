here here !

I agree totally 
I say to those who feel I pirate music and therefore must pay a royalty on
the blanks F*** YOU I do not, never have,  and never will. I am not into
MP3's nor any other type of digital media from commercial rip offs. 

I do however use CD's for backup of my purchased products and let the kids
use them instead of the original. I have also received family shots on CD
from OS.

It's another lame attempt like Sony's stopping chipping of their consoles.
I think the protection of consumer rights will win through it did with
sony. Unless the Govt. gets a cut of course.

&gt;&gt; We already pay a royalty on blank audio and video cassettes, so another

&gt;We stand on a unique battlefield, unlike that of the days of tape storage.
Not only do we have a highly durable medium that can store tonnes of data,
but these days we have the data to store on it. Not just GNU either. Free
(as in freedom) data is common place too, for example the excellent
"Computer Boy", by Cobweb Films (if you haven't seen this spoof on "The
Matrix" then search google now), and Courtney Love, as much as I don't like
her music, actively encourages distribution of her music via digital
formats without paying, she hosts MP3's of her music on her site, as she
got screwed over by the very record companies who are claiming thier
artists are losing out. As well as the thousands if not millions of bedroom
artists who have thier stuff on offer without payment, in the hope of being
noticed, through this marvelous American excercise in killing technology
(who said research in war devices is bad? it gave us the 'net). Not to
mention home videos and photos, now that d!
&gt;igital camera's are entering us into a new age of binary storage
requirements. Heck, I use CD's to send my resume to companies.
&gt;	Now calls for a time when not just us, sitting in our darkly lit rooms
researching the esoteric ways of Stallman and co, but everyone, should
stand up and keep this tool which our survival is becoming so dependant on,
as un-encumbered as possible. Australia is one of the last fronts of this
Jihad, this holy war of personal freedom. The average joe is only just
starting to see the CD for what it is. They thought it was an inferior
replacement of vinyl, the CD is a superior replacement to paper, film and
magnetic tape, that is in EVERYONE's hands, and we need to educate them
now, because I hardly think our local representitives are going to listen
to the intelligent minority over the the bags of money from the record
companies. We need to succed where the rest of the world is failing, and be
the example to the global community that we so rightly deserve to be ;-)
&gt;
&gt;We need a list of representitives and relevant people's email addresses
posted to this mailing list. Heck, when we gonna march on parliment house? 8-)
&gt;In the mean time, I'm emailing Alexander Downer and telling all my friends
to do so aswell.
