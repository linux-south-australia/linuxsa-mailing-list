&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Should be in the minimum standards for new houses to have rainwater 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;collection, even if all they do with it is water the garden.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe it should also include a minimum standard to recycle all grey- 
&gt; &gt; water
&gt; &gt; for all new houses into a collection tank and be able to use that water for 
&gt; &gt; flushing toilets
&gt; &gt; and watering the garden...
&gt; 
&gt; ... and the collection tank is fitted with a heat pump to put the
&gt; thermal energy back into the hot water tank.
&gt; 
&gt; You'd have to have a sort of double-flush toilet though, the second
&gt; flush with clean water, having minimised the volume in the trap,
&gt; because your toilet would be really vile if you left it full of old
&gt; sink water. Or you could sterilise the grey water, but that starts
&gt; introducing nasty-chemical problems.
&gt; 

there is a development in adelaide that collects the grey and storm water into gravel beds and
filters the water through rocks and stuff into the aquifer below, then uses this water to water
the lawn and fill the toilets.

i think this is the way to go.  they also use some types of wetlands plants to help filter the
water as well.

this way, the houses would have 2 water delivery systems, and 2 water disposal systems: 1 sweet
and 1 recycled.

the sweet water would be for drinking, showering, cleaning.  the recyled for watering and
flushing.

the black water is sewage for the city to handle, the storm and grey water is recylced.

Calgary has a couple communities that are using water to perform geo-thermal temperature control. 
the idea is that 20 feet under the ground will maintain 10C all year around.  Which means that in
summer what it can get to 35C or in winter when it can get to -40C the water being pumped through
pipes 20-30 feet under the ground will remain at 10C.

so in winter, a smaller heating bill, and in summer no cooling bill.  only run a 1hp pump and a
fan system and bingo.  lowing energy costs.

I reckon they should take it one step further and incorperate recycled grey water into the sooling
system.

you collect the grey water, and before it enters the aquifer, it passes through a complete cycle
of the geo-thermal system.  two birds, one stone.
