&gt; &gt; from what i have seen, there has been very little big picture planning
&gt; &gt; about air stream. far too much leet boys club, gam3s and wherez cruft =/
&gt; &gt; very light on the "community" side
&gt; 
&gt; Air-Stream are moving forward and are ready to accept new members into the
&gt; organisation. 

this is good =) 

&gt; There will be membership forms, time for discussion with the
&gt; Air-Stream people and so forth all at the open day.

maybe on thing that should be put on the agenda is what are
the future goals of airstream and what the priorities are,
what they are interested in doing and what they are not 
interested in doing. 

this should nip in the bud any dissapointment up front =P
it may be the case that another community focused group may
server better folks with other needs and requirements...

internet access is not the only thing that folks need.

&gt; &gt; that may sound like a harsh comment, but when i last talked
&gt; &gt; to the "airstream" lads they didn't want to talk to me about
&gt; &gt; communtiy stuff... 
&gt; 
&gt; If you hadn't noticed, I am listening.

=)
 
&gt; We can take tackle this situation in two ways: we can be complain about
&gt; what has or has not happened in the past, or we can work with what is
&gt; happening now. Might I suggest that the first solution is fantastically
&gt; negative and isn't at all community minded but the second solution has
&gt; merit?

right then, where can we go from here =)

cheers,

Kim
