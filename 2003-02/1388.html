Dare we ask what brand/model comes with no pcmcia?
Just curious as a mate bought a Dell a few months ago and it didn't have
a serial port. Not a killer for most people but he is a cisco guy so he
ended up buying a usb-&gt;rs232 adaptor to connect to his beloved console
ports.
'spose its just a case of reading the fine print.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Long story short :)
&gt; 
&gt; As you may remember, two days ago I asked about wireless pcmcia cards.
&gt; There is one small problem with this, the laptop (which is a recent
&gt; insurance replacement) doesn't have pcmcia slots :0
&gt; 
&gt; So you can imagine how #$$%^ed off I was to finally have this wireless card
&gt; and no where to put it!!!
&gt; 
&gt; My options here are:
&gt; 1- Be very angry at the computer shop for getting things wrong and insist
&gt; they replace it.
&gt; 2- Get some kind of adaptor for the cards to make them work through USB.
&gt; 3- Run around in circles screaming!
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I have done 1 and 3. They may end up having to replace it, but if not,
&gt; does anyone know of some means/device which will allow me to use the
&gt; existing pcmcia cards? Oh and this means must must must work with Linux...
&gt; i'm scared to think!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; AG
