<H1>Data security - any thoughts?</H1>

This is a general question about how to secure data on a DMZ.

I am currently implementing a system that will need to keep patient's 
private information on a webserver ready for download.

I was planning on keeping it on the disk encrypted and only decrypting 
it when it was downloaded - i would ssh the files to the machine and GPG 
them up as they were sent to the machine, then i would decrypt them as 
they were requested over the web.

I know that this is not secure as the keys will have to be kept on the 
same machine. i.e. anyone with Root access will be able to get the files ..

However, i can't think of a better way to do it - encrypting the data 
isn't really much of a security measure here - it will just make it 
slightly harder for anyone who gained access to to read the files...


Has anyone got any other ideas on how this could be done?

I really can't think of anything - once someone has root on your 
machine, the games up - they have access to all yuor files. I could'nt 
think of any other way to do this, short of rotating keys manually...

Any ideaS?

cheers

jon
