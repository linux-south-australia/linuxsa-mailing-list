&gt; There's no crisis with lack of software.

Well after the shameful exercise Tuesday night at Linux SA I am really 
getting sick and tired of OpenSource not doing what it damned well 
should be doing, simply working as required!!!!

I wrote my presentation in OpenOffice.org 1.0.2 and it was all working 
as I completed it at the back of the room. I unplugged, shifted the 
computer to the front of the room, plugged it in and eventually (damn 
Lycoris is so slow!) Got the presentation started. Less than 15% of the 
graphics actually showed on the screen. Why? Who knows. It might be 
because of buggy software. It might be poor operator, it might even be 
poor implementation of the JPG handler but it doesn't matter. I trusted 
it and it let me down badly and left me much embarrassed.

To all the members who turned up, very sorry for the failure, it wasn't 
expected to be like that. 

I have now rebuilt the whole presentation and am in the process of 
putting up OpenOffice, StarOffice and PowerPoint versions as well as 
HTML-ised versions into my web site. Keep watch for the notice of just 
when they are all up and ready for viewing.

Again, sorry but I hate it when tools just don't work as they are 
expected to. Time things like this got fixed before newer and flashier 
versions were contemplated.

To anybody thinking of using Impress for their presentations, 
double-check that it actually works like it is supposed to or you could 
be like me, very un-Impressed.


Cheers,  Ian
