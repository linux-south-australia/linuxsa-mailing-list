Do a file search on your machine for files with a creation date after a
known "non hacked" date, ie over the last 7 days.   You should be able to
pick which files have been modified, you will find ps, ls, top and a few
others are likely candidates.    Replace all of these off your RH7.1 CD.
Anything that you dont recognise do a search on google, it will help to
identify which r00t kit you were hit with.

Some pointers to keep you out of trouble in the future.... ;)

- Grab yourself the "Hardening a Linux Box" document off the CERT site.
- Learn how to configure tripwire
- Get a new packet filter script
- Switch off every daemon you dont need, especially things like http, ftp
etc... or at least ensure they are firewalled from the internet.
- Patch every service presented to the internet and keep on top of updates.

Cheers

Matthew

pasword to some thing I wanted ..
So now I can reboot it and  have now changed all paswords but it is slow
and I think it is running more than I know ..
when I do a ps -x to see  the pids of what is running it ..
it used to come back straight away with what was running  but now

it sits ther for a few seconds then just page after page a bout 4 pages
of this one line ..
cat: /root/ .pstmp: no such file or directory  ...
can anybody help me with this so I can see what is running and  get this
system back running  how it was

wife's computer and her daughter computer and my ham radio  tcpip via
radio server so who ever did it olny o a very little fish ..

problem would much appreciated ..
