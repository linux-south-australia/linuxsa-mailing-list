&gt;&gt; Show me the code.. until you do, well I don't need to say anymore. 
&gt;&gt; Chris is the only one with any backup, and its not much. Sorry Mr 
&gt;&gt; Yeoh I couldn't find specifically what you contributed to Samba, 
&gt;&gt; though you get the benefit of any doubt, that email address is credit 
&gt;&gt; enough, though I would like to see what your responsible for please.

&gt; I can't take credit for it, but there is some code in there somewhere.

Actually,  I was just joking. There actually are some coding giants here 
that work on software that a great number of people use, or even depend 
upon.

Unfortunately, I know little or nothing about programming. It would 
probably even take me a long time to make the stuff on that web page.   :-)

But there is one thing I do know, is that I have learned a lot here, and 
that is what is most important for me. I can't know everything....and 
that is true for everybody...and that's why I like this list, we all 
teach each other.


Maybe this will be good for you too... :-)
