&gt; &gt;But as James pointed out the people who have been burnt or are too scared

&gt; Does anyone else read these comments with an s/linux/windows/i filter 
&gt; and get feelings of deja-vu from circa 1993-1995? :)

no, linux was more stable than windows and dos even then.
it was my primary desktop then and the only reason to 
take it down was to add new hardware, bi montly =)

true that applications i ran were not typical of the average
use, but i think that neither have changed. except the average
user uses the internet more now than then...

i just found this, thought it'd be interesting;

Australia at Linux leading edge:
 <A HREF="http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,5996924">http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,5996924</A>%5E15344%5E%5Enbv%5E15306%2D15321,00.html

and (this just sounds like there needs to be a tax in it)

MS schmoozes government:

im not one for reading the australian much, but recently they have been
covering some interesting stuff, including an article "Big Blue Linux
makes history", about how the sydneys Powerhouse Museum, kanes microsoft
for being expensive and unreliable =) go linux as a server.. but they
used XP on the desktop ...

cheers,

Kim
