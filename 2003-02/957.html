Jon,

Have someone enter the key when they access the file, decrypt on the
fly, then discard the key. Make SURE that the key and the file are
transmitted on a secure link. This way, if someone gets the computer,
they don't have the keys to decrypt, and if someone intercepts the
traffic, they still don't have the keys... However, if they got root,
they could modify some code to capture the keys, and then you'd be lost.
Not sure there's many ways around that -- except for making people
decrypt it themselves with the key...

Also, bear in mind that it sounds as if you are going to have a key per
file, as opposed to a key per person... which is ok, but it does affect
the way you give keys out.

&gt; Subject: Data security - any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This is a general question about how to secure data on a DMZ.
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently implementing a system that will need to keep patient's 
&gt; private information on a webserver ready for download.
&gt; 
&gt; I was planning on keeping it on the disk encrypted and only 
&gt; decrypting 
&gt; it when it was downloaded - i would ssh the files to the 
&gt; machine and GPG 
&gt; them up as they were sent to the machine, then i would 
&gt; decrypt them as 
&gt; they were requested over the web.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that this is not secure as the keys will have to be 
&gt; kept on the 
&gt; same machine. i.e. anyone with Root access will be able to 
&gt; get the files ..
&gt; 
&gt; However, i can't think of a better way to do it - encrypting the data 
&gt; isn't really much of a security measure here - it will just make it 
&gt; slightly harder for anyone who gained access to to read the files...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone got any other ideas on how this could be done?
&gt; 
&gt; I really can't think of anything - once someone has root on your 
&gt; machine, the games up - they have access to all yuor files. I 
&gt; could'nt 
&gt; think of any other way to do this, short of rotating keys manually...
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideaS?
&gt; 
&gt; cheers
&gt;
