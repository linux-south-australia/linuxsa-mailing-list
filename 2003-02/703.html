Hi Ryan

The only problem we have had over the last few weeks is that all our
dlink-300 modem stopped working.

We changed the with billions in bridged mode and everthing was good.
This is with woody 3.0 

Cheers
  Mike

&gt; Hiya,
&gt; 
&gt; Bunch of my clients use a modified linux distro based on debian as a 
&gt; gateway for their business (firewall/sharing); basically it's a really 
&gt; simple web interface with a nice big button so they can 
&gt; connect/disconnect quite easily.
&gt; 
&gt; The ADSL customers use a interface module which uses debian's pppoe 
&gt; stuff, configured through a slightly modified pppoeconf.
&gt; 
&gt; Thing is - about a week ago, got calls from everybody saying they 
&gt; couldn't connect properly.  Checking a few out - for some reason, 
&gt; bringing up pppoe would get a connection established type message in 
&gt; syslog, but then nothing else.  I remember some message about timeouts; 
&gt; forget what exactly.
&gt; 
&gt; Solution ended up being installing roaming penguin's pppoe, which 
&gt; worked perfectly, so I didn't investigate it much further - time was 
&gt; short, and clients wanted their internet back ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody else had similar experiences, and knows why?   The customers 
&gt; are on different ISP's, some on Airnet, some on Bigpond, and some on 
&gt; Internode, and they all had the problem at the same time.  
&gt; Interestingly enough the one single client I had roaming penguin on 
&gt; originally hasn't had any issues.
