&gt; How much the charge is I don't know. If you refuse to pay your "water
&gt; rates" to the water authority on the grounds that you don't use their
&gt; supply but catch rainwater, they say "no, you still have to pay for
&gt; the rainwater". It's not as much as for piped water but I have a
&gt; feeling it's not that much less.

Ah, now I recall.  Isn't it true that water in England is not metered,
and you just pay a flat rate?  So that should include the water you
collect from the roof as well.  I'd guess that the charge applies then
even if you don't have mains water.

&gt; Another bit of water weirdness: mixer taps on sinks aren't allowed
&gt; to have a common spout in which mixing takes place anymore. They
&gt; look the same, but the spout contains concentric hot and cold ducts,
&gt; so the hot and cold water are separated right up to the nozzle. The
&gt; result is that they don't mix, and if you try to wash your hands
&gt; under such a tap you get chilled and scalded at the same time.

Right, I recall that.  It seems that this is a remnant of legislation
which came into effect in the late 18th century, after a particularly
virulent cholera epedemic.  Apparently the problem was cholera bacilli
breeding in hot (warm?) water tanks and then finding their way back
into the cold drinking water.  As a result, the laws were modified to
ensure no return of warm water to cold, which means that even today
most British houses have separate hot and cold water taps, and I
believe there's some issue with pressure pumps as well (water needs to
be in an unpressurized cistern).  Australia seems to have inherited
both problems.

Of course, conditions in England are pretty different anyway.  When I
was at university (Exeter, early 70s), I recall seeing an
advertisement for central heating with individual temperature controls
in each room.  "55° (F; 13°C) in the bedroom.  60° (15°) in the lounge
room; 65° (18°) in the bathroom".
