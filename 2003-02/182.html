When you connect to an ISP with link compression, there are two numbers 
that matter. One is the number of bytes that you have directed through 
the link, and the other is the actual number of bytes that have gone 
through the link. I was pointing out that the number of bytes directed 
is the one that is charged.

For example, if I download 10MB of nulls, link compression will take 
that down to maybe 50k. I will still get charged for 10MB.

As John Edwards pointed out, backbone links can't feasibly run 
compression therefore the ISP is downloading and gets charged for 10MB 
even if their local network equipment compresses and feeds it through 
to me as 50k. They therefore have to charge me for the full amount in 
order to recover their costs.

Where it gets tricky is that the remote end may be running link 
compression as well, so their local ISP gets the 50k, expands and 
charges it as 10MB, sends it through to my ISP as 10MB, which then 
recompresses and sends it to me as 50k, and charges me for 10MB.

It's an inefficiency in the way the current networks operate, so 
there's not a lot that can be done about it at this stage. I mainly 
posted about it because it's interesting to know.
