&gt; 1. What a shame you didn't respond to my message of last week reminding
&gt; folks that businesses had until 11 February to apply for up to $500 of
&gt; training funding. Your courses sound like they would have been eligible
&gt; and probably quite helpful to a number of businesses like mine.

...perhaps she only just subscribed to the list?  Seeing as I've never 
seen her post before, and it was a commercial post, I'd think this was 
likely.

&gt; 2. You didn't give us any indication of cost. That would help me decide
&gt; if I wanted to head to your page for more information or not bother.
&gt; Now that I have missed the closing date for the funding I am no longer
&gt; a candidate but it might have been fun to complete the course.

...that's why contact details were provided.

In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of
people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
