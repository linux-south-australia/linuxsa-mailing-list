Hey all,

This is my setup: I have Red Hat 6.2 Server running Samba which has a printer 
connected (HP Deskjet 600). This printer is shared as a raw printer and works 
great from windows clients and mostly works from linux clients. 

My internal computer is running Mandrake Linux 9.0 and uses CUPS as the print 
spooler. Certain programs (notably openoffice and mozilla) pipe data to the 
print spooler through stdin... this results in a file called STDIN on the red 
hat server in /var/spool/lpd/raw. If no file called STDIN existed before in 
that directory, then a new one is created and the file prints as expected. If 
STDIN already exists, then it is written over, but never gets printed. 

Is there a way to make any of the programs in the chain (ie OO.o, CUPS, samba, 
lpd) call this file something different? i.e. something random each time... 
or if STDIN already exists, call the new on STDIN.1... or failing that, at 
least make lpd on the red hat server realise the file has been changed and it 
should print it...

Also, if anyone has a HP600 or similar and can get draft mode to actually be 
draft mode (i.e. not make the page wet with ink), I would _love_ to hear how 
to do it.

Thanks,

Damien

P.S.: My girlfriend did some Uni work in Openoffice on my linux box the other 
day, and I said "Do you even know what program you used to do that?". She 
said "nope". She really doesn't care what it is and said "It's the same". If 
only the printing worked properly without my intervention it could've been an 
all round success :) Bring on Linux for the masses! :)
