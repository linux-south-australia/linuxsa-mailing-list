&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like you're being confused more by the 
&gt; misapprehension that there is a real, solid standard for 
&gt; command line arguments, rather than by the behaviour of the 
&gt; tools themselves.

Well, no, not really. That's why I said "standard", not standard.

&gt; 
&gt; If you accept that there actually isn't a standard at all, 
&gt; just a few loosely followed conventions, then the individual 
&gt; behaviours of tar, ps, ar, cdrecord, and lots of other 
&gt; commands will cease to be even remotely surprising.

Yes, true... however, one of the reasons I bring this up is that I
recall reading somewhere (perhaps an old man page) that there is now an
"old" and a "new" tar style, and we should all use the new style because
of something. I just took a look at the info page for tar on my Debian 3
system, and it didn't say quite that, but did mention the old, new and
long (mnemonic) styles...

&gt; 
&gt; If "user unfriendly" means "at odds with one's expectations," then 
&gt; sometimes it's easier to work around the problem my just 
&gt; doing away with the expectations. :-)

Sometimes, but that's a workaround, not a solution. :)

Actually, I now recall one of the reasons for the way the java programs
worked is (perhaps?) because they also ran on Windows, and they wanted a
more consistent cross-platform approach rather than fitting in to the
platform... it could also be that the -- long option is a GNU thing
only...
