The greatest flaw with Linux is the same as it's greatest strength.... 
the open source nature of it. It can't be stolen but it can't be sold 
either. With computers as with everything else people don't really buy 
what they need or want they buy what someone tells them they need or 
want. Nobody is going to market Linux like Microsoft or even Apple. The 
people that are smart enough to find out for themselves probably 
allready have. Just look at Mac OS X.......... how many people run 
that??? It's all in the hard sell...

2.5 cents

&gt;Commentary: The Greatest Flaw In Linux
&gt;Saturday February 15, 2003 - [ 01:41 PM GMT ]   
&gt;Topic - Advocacy
&gt;
&gt;- By Patrick 'LinuxAddict' Pauwels -
&gt;The largest flaw with Linux is not in its ease of use or installation.
&gt;There's no crisis with lack of software. The hardware support is solid.
&gt;Actually, I feel Linux is very much ready for the masses. The greatest
&gt;flaw with Linux is that nobody knows what it is.
&gt;
&gt;Interesting direction to take. Is he right?
&gt;
&gt;Is this a direction we should be focussing on to gather support from
&gt;within the corporations, schools and organisaions we have to deal with?
