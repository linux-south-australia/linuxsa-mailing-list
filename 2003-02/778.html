List: Sorry if I have hijacked the topic.

James,
I think you got fairly close to the nail there. 
I think I gave my boss a heart attack tonight on the way out when I told
him I am planning Mysql/linux replacement for Sqlserver+nt setup.

If I ever tried to railroad that through it would come down to I do it or I
leave - frankly I dont have any objection the current setup other than the
cost of future upgrades I am more than comfortable in the setup/support
etc. But, 15k for SqlServer + Xk for winxp/2k/.net server or whatever the
hell they are calling it (per seat no doubt) gets a tad annoying.

Anyway - we are at a small crossroads atm - to .NET or not. I see a small
window of opportunity to perhaps slide in some less than critical apps but
I need to CONvince people it's worth the effort so long as the USER
learning curve is _flat_ Our sysadmin cant spell anything other than NT so
he's no help and probably the biggest enemy backward thinking is an advance
for him. 

I am no means an expert in Linux+solutions but I can see the benefit in
choosing low cost well supported O/S and commercial or generic tools like
delphi or c++ and some form of gui toolkit (or even JAVA) with an open
source SQL server.

Getting to this point will be hard but if I can produce an SQL server
alternative as proof of concept with a workable application suitable to our
business then I will be well on the way to winning people over. 

I feel people are getting aroused with Linux but they fear it and it's more
like a trendy thing to know or have downloaded - not necessarily used it.

But as James pointed out the people who have been burnt or are too scared
to admit their ignorance are the ones who shoot any idea like this down in
flames.

So perhaps something which will apeal to the users and will look nice would
be good ATM whilst I am impressed with rh8 gnome/kde/bluecurve I don't feel
they are sufficient to excite the users.
