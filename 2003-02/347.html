Hi All,

I am new to this list and all so please dont shoot me if I am in the 
wrong area

I came home from work yesterday afternoon to find my redhat 7.1  linux 
box playing up I tried to log in as root but it would not accept my log 
in password was wrong I new I had been hacked ..
but I always leve root logged in on one place so I just changed the 
pasword to some thing I wanted ..
So now I can reboot it and  have now changed all paswords but it is slow 
and I think it is running more than I know ..
when I do a ps -x to see  the pids of what is running it ..
it used to come back straight away with what was running  but now

it sits ther for a few seconds then just page after page a bout 4 pages 
of this one line ..
cat: /root/ .pstmp: no such file or directory  ...
can anybody help me with this so I can see what is running and  get this 
system back running  how it was
it is not a big  corperate server  just a little home server for me my 
wife's computer and her daughter computer and my ham radio  tcpip via 
radio server so who ever did it olny o a very little fish ..
thanks to anybody that could take the time to help me out with this big 
problem would much appreciated ..
my  email <A HREF="mailto:djmhbtgw@southcom.com.au">djmhbtgw@southcom.com.au</A>
the linux box is a celron 233 128meg ram  1 ethernet card 1 phone modem 
 and a still learning operator ..
cheers for now
Danny .
