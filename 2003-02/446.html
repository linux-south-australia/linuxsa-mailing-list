Kim,

&gt; &gt; Air-Stream are moving forward and are ready to accept new members
&gt; &gt; into the organisation. 
&gt; 
&gt; this is good =) 

Yes it is.

&gt; &gt; There will be membership forms, time for discussion with the
&gt; &gt; Air-Stream people and so forth all at the open day.
&gt; 
&gt; maybe on thing that should be put on the agenda is what are
&gt; the future goals of airstream and what the priorities are,
&gt; what they are interested in doing and what they are not 
&gt; interested in doing. 

Ack.

&gt; it may be the case that another community focused group may
&gt; server better folks with other needs and requirements...

Perhaps, but it's rather silly to have more than one community wireless
network all vying for resources as well.

&gt; internet access is not the only thing that folks need.

I know.

&gt; right then, where can we go from here =)

Come along to the open day and tell your friends about it...it should be
a good one. If you've got expertise either in wireless or helping with
community organisations bring it along too. The more hands the easier
the work as they say :-)
