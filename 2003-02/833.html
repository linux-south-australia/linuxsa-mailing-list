What CPU, how much memory, and how old?  I ask because I had a problem,
recently, where I had problems loading the OS.  The machine didn't boot
from the CD because it was too old, but I did have a DOS floppy with
IDE CD-ROM driver, and so I could certainly see the install program.
And the install program launched okay, and partitioned okay and started
to load, but then came up with errors.  I recall it was unable to read
the CD.  The odd thing was that if I ejected and re-inserted the CD and
then clicked retry it continued okay for a while.  I should mention,
that when I did a DIR on the CD before launching the install program
the end of the directory listing had junk.  I did eventually get the OS
installed, but then the OS ran unsatisfactorily.  I had trouble booting,
kept getting BSODs and had the same problem with DIR listings.  I never
did get Win95 to run properly on my new P4.  Fortunately Win2000 works
okay, and it goes without saying that I had no problem with Linux...
