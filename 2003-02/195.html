I was having similar issues today with ADSL in attempting to connect to 
Airnet using RH7.3/rp-pppoe-3.5. The connection would simply time out. This 
box had been working normally with a basic setup using 'adsl-setup' until 
yesterday when SA had this national ADSL problem. 
<A HREF="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-">http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-</A>
replies.cfm?t=61525

In the end I managed to resolve this issue by manually checking all ADSL and 
Network configuration files and correcting any irregularities. I am a little 
uncertain on the file I actually changed that eventually fixed the problem 
but your best hope in resolving this is somewhere in there.

/etc/ppp/pppoe.conf
/etc/sysconfig/networking/devices/ifcfg-*
/etc/sysconfig/networking/profiles/default/ifcfg-*

&gt; Todd, 
&gt; The fact your XP box connects would suggest it is not a problem with 
&gt; the ISP. Unless they have changed their authentication process and 
&gt; XP is knows this.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume you're using PPPOE, if so which software? 
&gt; Which modem are you using?
&gt; Is there a log file of your startup?
&gt; How is is connected to the PC?
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest you may want to look at your logs and perhaps echo 
&gt; the script output of adsl start up script.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt;

&gt; &gt;        Hi,     I&#8217;m not on the list as yet, but am considering
&gt; &gt;subscribing.     Yesterday Adam internet had an outage again thanks to
&gt; &gt;Telstra, however, when it came back online, for some phantom reason, my
&gt; &gt;linux box wouldn&#8217;t connect. I have now installed Redhat 8.0 as it
&gt; &gt;needed an update anyway.. and there is still the same problem after running
&gt; &gt;adsl-setup     Adam is saying that it is a machine problem and cannot
&gt; &gt;support it over the phone, but other people who have looked at the box from
&gt; &gt;outside Adam have said it&#8217;s an ISP problem.  I can still connect via
&gt; &gt;my XP box.     Is something wrong with my box? Or is Adam trying to cover
&gt; &gt;up for a problem by pretending inadequacies?     More importantly, can
&gt; &gt;anyone offer a solution of this?     Todd.
