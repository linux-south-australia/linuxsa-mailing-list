Reinstall,

Now install from scratch (7.3 is good) and download all the patches from redhat, then go to IBM developer works 
and create an account. Now go to Linux section and look for iptables by Daniel Robbins (I think) its the best guide 
I have seen for a new user and gives a complete script at the end.

Also shutdown all services not needed :- Go to setup, system and switch off everything unless needed.
Also download Redhat's manuals from redhat web site on PDF there are first class.

Welcome to the learning zone :-)

&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am new to this list and all so please dont shoot me if I am in the 
&gt;&gt; wrong area
&gt;
&gt;Nope, you're in the right area!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I came home from work yesterday afternoon to find my redhat 7.1  linux 
&gt;&gt; box playing up I tried to log in as root but it would not accept my log 
&gt;&gt; in password was wrong I new I had been hacked ..
&gt;&gt; but I always leve root logged in on one place so I just changed the 
&gt;&gt; pasword to some thing I wanted ..
&gt;
&gt;Well, that's good and bad. Really shouldn't leave root logged in and
&gt;unattended, you should run the box for day-today as a normal user. (you
&gt;might be doing that, you didn't say)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So now I can reboot it and  have now changed all paswords but it is slow 
&gt;&gt; and I think it is running more than I know ..
&gt;&gt; when I do a ps -x to see  the pids of what is running it ..
&gt;&gt; it used to come back straight away with what was running  but now
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; it sits ther for a few seconds then just page after page a bout 4 pages 
&gt;&gt; of this one line ..
&gt;&gt; cat: /root/ .pstmp: no such file or directory  ...
&gt;&gt; can anybody help me with this so I can see what is running and  get this 
&gt;&gt; system back running  how it was
&gt;
&gt;Yes, as MMC suggested, reload it. If it has been hacked, it's quite
&gt;difficult and time consuming to get it back the way it was, and that has
&gt;proven to be an insecure state, so do you really want to go there?
&gt;
&gt;Load a distribution that has good tools for keeping it up to date, and
&gt;use them. Not suggesting one because I'm biassed...
&gt;
&gt;Good idea to firewall the net connection if you haven't been doing that,
&gt;too.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; it is not a big  corperate server  just a little home server for me my 
&gt;&gt; wife's computer and her daughter computer and my ham radio  tcpip via 
&gt;&gt; radio server so who ever did it olny o a very little fish ..
&gt;&gt; thanks to anybody that could take the time to help me out with this big 
&gt;&gt; problem would much appreciated ..
&gt;&gt; my  email <A HREF="mailto:djmhbtgw@southcom.com.au">djmhbtgw@southcom.com.au</A>
&gt;&gt; the linux box is a celron 233 128meg ram  1 ethernet card 1 phone modem 
&gt;&gt; and a still learning operator ..
&gt;&gt; cheers for now
&gt;&gt; Danny .
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;Too bad you got hacked before you joined the list, but things will look
&gt;up from here, it's a great resource, and lots of help available. Just
&gt;keep some flame-proof garments handy, things get out of hand
&gt;occasionally :)
