&gt;im currently in year 12 at high school, and im interested 
&gt;in getting into linux as a occupation.
&gt;
&gt;im just wondering if their are any courses around adelaide 
&gt;that operate. and especially if they would accept someone at my &gt; age (17).
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;cam  

IIT Training will be holding their Hands On Linux course in a couple of
weeks time.  I attended this one a couple of years ago and found it quite
beneficial.  Although the course content was excellent, I probably gained
more from spending a week doing nothing but linux in the same room as a 
bunch of tech heads all doing the same.  That as well as having
Richard Sharpe as our lecturer kind of helped the learning process....

Details are on their website: <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au">http://www.iit-training.com.au</A>

The other thing I would recommend is getting to know other people who run
Linux, this list is certainly a good place to start, as are many of the web
resources you'll find, Google is your friend.

PS You may notice I've changed the mail format to plain text rather than
HTML,
search the list archives for "html mail flame" (and maybe "David Lloyd" as
well :),
 and no doubt you'll figure out why ;), a word to the wise...
