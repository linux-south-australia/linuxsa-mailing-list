Hey folks,

Surely the _only_ problem with people sending unsubscribe messages to
the list is the torrent of emails it invariably generates. Sure, someone
may not be capable of reading the obvious instructions at the bottom of
each email, but surely they are capable of discovering that rather than
unsubscribing, they inadvertently sent a silly message to the list, and
hence they will discover their mistake on their own, and unsubscribe
successfully. If you really need to tell them that they are dumb (which
they figure out anyway after getting their message back from the list
complete with no body apart from the how to unsubscribe lines), surely
you can tell them directly and off-list? Do we really care that once
every few months, someone wastes our preciousssss preciousssss (ahem,
gollum) bandwidth, by sending a single dud message? Surely we don't
care. It does, however, get annoying when this is followed up by thirty
messages discussing translations, filtering, and so on. It's as bad as
the HTML thing, which fortunately, seems to have died down. I think the
list is agreed that we don't like HTML, and that people should send
unsubscribe messages to the correct address, and in both cases, we don't
need to discuss it every time -- if anything, we could send an off-list
message informing the hapless sender of the modus operandi of this list.

Sigh.

&lt;/rant&gt;
