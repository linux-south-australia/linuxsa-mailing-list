To all users of the CSIRO National Measurement Laboratory's (NML's) NTP
service:

Dear User,
At the time of writing, this service, provided via installations in Sydney,
Melbourne and Perth, is accessed by more than 250000 different hosts each
day, generating a daily total of more than 60 million NTP request packets.

For reasons that we are presently trying to determine, this packet rate has
recently begun doubling every month; a far greater rate of increase than
before. Additionally, there are approximately 10000 users of this service
who are operating software or firmware that polls our servers at an
inappropriately high rate, consuming a disproportionate fraction of network
resources (presently about 80% of the total). The operators of these systems
(some of which we know are router boxes, and not PCs) are almost certainly
unaware of this, since the traffic only becomes significant when it is
concentrated at its destination. It is not feasible to contact the operators
of all these systems because of the large number of them, their wide
geographical dispersion, and the fact that all we have is their network
addresses.

As a result of the above factors, the network resources consumed by NML's
NTP service are becoming increasingly significant, and in view of the very
rapid rate of traffic increase, and the fact that we do not know at what
point this increase may level off, it presently appears that it may not be
possible to sustain the provision of a free, open access service in its
present form.

The bulk of our NTP network traffic originates from overseas, and
experiments conducted in cooperation with AARNet have shown that these
packets keep on coming, consuming the same network resources, even if our
servers ignore or reject them. In fact, ignoring packets generally results
in a massive increase in traffic as some client software or firmware
packages poll the servers increasingly frequently. Consequently the obvious
solution of blocking overseas or unauthorised traffic does not necessarily
alleviate the problem.

I therefore feel that it is my responsibility to give you advance warning
that unless a solution to these problems is found soon, it is likely that,
within the next few weeks or months, our NTP service in its current form
will have to be shut down. Additionally, we will need to conduct some
experiments which may result in service being denied for varying periods
over the next few days.

If the worst-case scenario takes place, the existing servers will be given
new names and new IP addresses, and it is likely that the future NTP service
offered by NML will be available to users only by arrangement with us. This
is so that we will have contact details for every user, so that, for
example, we can notify them if they inadvertently poll our servers at a
higher than reasonable rate.

It is also possible that NML will be forced to charge a fee for access to
these servers to cover the network charges and management costs they will
incur.

We presently have two additional Stratum 1 NTP servers which are installed
and available for use in Australia, but whose address details have for
obvious reasons not been advertised, so that they are not affected by the
traffic problems described above. For those of you who may be affected in
the short term by the scenario described above, we will be able to give you
access to these alternative servers so that your time synchronisation will
be unaffected during the interim period.

I am therefore asking you to respond to this letter, indicating your future
interest in NML's NTP service, any comments or suggestions you may have, and
in particular, indicating whether the possible scenario described above will
cause problems for you.

Finally, we only have email addresses for those users who chose to contact
us before using our servers (approximately 300 users). I would therefore
appreciate it if you could pass this message on to anyone else who you think
may be interested.

Regards,

Peter Fisk
