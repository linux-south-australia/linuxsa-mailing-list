<PRE>
I have had QNX installed on a Windows2000/Novell4.11/Dos/QNX machine for 
about a year now.
I found it available for download at <A HREF="http://www.tucows.com.">http://www.tucows.com.</A>

I rarely use it, but I like to have all sundry of operating systems 
available to me, mostly just out of curiosity. That's why it occurred to 
me that someone may want to know about QNX so that they would have a new 
toy to play with.   :-)  It could be an old toy too! Supposedly they 
have been around since 1980: <A HREF="http://www.qnx.com/company/index.html">http://www.qnx.com/company/index.html</A>

There is more technical information than I will ever have the time to 
read on this page: 
<A HREF="http://www.qnx.com/developer/docs/qnx_6.1_docs/neutrino/sys_arch/about.html">http://www.qnx.com/developer/docs/qnx_6.1_docs/neutrino/sys_arch/about.html</A>

For people new to Unix, it makes an easy install inside of Windows 
without the requirement that you partition your drive. You'll just have 
to boot from a floppy.

If you are an old hand, you might find QNX too GUI oriented for your 
taste. However, they sell CD's and who knows, maybe the GUI can be disabled.

Further, it has an apt-get like GUI based installation system with the 
following available for download from a a number of repositories:

rsync

samba 2.4 [1]

gnu emacs

Mozilla

Abiword

Mutt

Pine

Lynx

(Ncpfs seems to be linked to the Linux kernel, I am _not_ anticipating a 
netware client any time soon)

In short, you will not have as many precompiled applications available 
to you as you would in a full Linux distribution. But they have 
development tools available, so I am sure it could probably be done.

Anyway just thought I would pass this along before I got back to my more 
mundane tasks. :-(


Cheers,


James Leone   (Pronounced ---&gt;  lee-owe-knee) :-)

[1] I was, for some reason, intereted in finding out what 'grog' does 
with 5 computers, so I went to his site and saw that one was a part of 
the samba compile farm. I then looked for QNX, and all of a sudden here 
I am writing an email.
