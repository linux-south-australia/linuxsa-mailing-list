Well which part of the page did you think mentioned the open day?

"
 We are providing you with an opportunity to be in the next
 group of people who become Air-Stream members. Air-Stream is
 ready to broaden its horizons and we need you. A meeting for
 all of those who would like to join Air-Stream and become
 pioneers in the wireless community is being held on the
 23erd of January 2003, 7:30pm @ Park Side Primary School.
 (Map attached below) 

 So come with your ideas, your information and your cash, so
 we can get the ball rolling. 

 This meeting is designed to get onboard those who are ready
 (or close to) contributing to the physical expansion of the
 network. For those of you who are still unsure or need more
 information, we suggest you come along to our obligation
 free open day, *which will be held next month* (*we’ll keep you
 posted*) 

 For those of you who are ready, I hope to see you next week!

Well no mention of an Open Day date or venue there.

Oh, now I see George mentioned the venue is on the page. Nothing there 
to suggest that the day event is at the same site. 

Why would anybody be attending an open day when there isn't a single 
word about it other than a 'watch-this-space' mention?

The mention needs to be out in the open so folks who are interested 
know about it. Brian is right, *you* didn't mention the venue in your 
original post AND the site doesn't mention the Open Day except as 
something coming up soon. 

Maybe the same time as the Open Day was decided somebody could have 
made a 2 minute amendment to the page just to reflect the event you are 
publicising? 

Hell, that would be even easier than picking on Brian for pointing out 
your own lapse &lt;G,D&RVF&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
