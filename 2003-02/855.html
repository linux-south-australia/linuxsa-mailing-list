&gt; OK ye telecommunications types... question:
&gt; 
&gt; I have a new phone (end of contract, new plan, free phone (6610), etc),
&gt; and it has, among other things, GPRS. Does this give my phone an IP
&gt; address on the Internet? Can I do Internetty kind of things on my phone,
&gt; or is it just WAP? I can't find much other than WAP at present, but it's
&gt; got a lot of functionality, and I can add to this by downloading Java
&gt; apps as well (ooer). So, any ideas, comments? Anyone got a link or a
&gt; brief explanation as to what exactly GPRS is (at the network level
&gt; rather than the physical or link levels)? Can I ssh from my phone?

Your typical GSM phone can do 9.6 Kbps data.  It appears
to your computers as a Hayes AT modem (typically connected
to your serial port using a special cable or to your infrared
port).  When you make a call the data transits the GSM network
to another GSM phone.  That GSM phone could be attached to a
dial-out modem.  Mobile phone networks typically have a bank
of modems which you can use to make a call into the switched phone
system.

As an optimisation, rather than dialing out to an ISP, an
ISP can have a presence on a number on the GSM network.

GPRS extends this idea -- increasing the data rate to 171.2 Kbps
(maximum, your carrier could be &lt;0.5 of this); using a "always-on"
conceptual model rather than a "modem" model; using a "IP packet"
conceptual modem rather than a "modem call" conceptual model.

Before you fiddle with either GSM data or GPRS have a chat
to your mobile network abouts costs.  You may be in for a
shock.
