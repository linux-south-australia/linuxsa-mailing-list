Hiya,

Bunch of my clients use a modified linux distro based on debian as a 
gateway for their business (firewall/sharing); basically it's a really 
simple web interface with a nice big button so they can 
connect/disconnect quite easily.

The ADSL customers use a interface module which uses debian's pppoe 
stuff, configured through a slightly modified pppoeconf.

Thing is - about a week ago, got calls from everybody saying they 
couldn't connect properly.  Checking a few out - for some reason, 
bringing up pppoe would get a connection established type message in 
syslog, but then nothing else.  I remember some message about timeouts; 
forget what exactly.

Solution ended up being installing roaming penguin's pppoe, which 
worked perfectly, so I didn't investigate it much further - time was 
short, and clients wanted their internet back ;-)

Anybody else had similar experiences, and knows why?   The customers 
are on different ISP's, some on Airnet, some on Bigpond, and some on 
Internode, and they all had the problem at the same time.  
Interestingly enough the one single client I had roaming penguin on 
originally hasn't had any issues.
