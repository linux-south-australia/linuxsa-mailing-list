&gt; &gt; &gt; Guess what MSVC thought about that?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can only declare variables at the beginning of function blocks in C.
&gt; 
&gt; Declaring variables in for loops like above is also new in the C99
&gt; standard (Section 6.5.8.3). It is meant to have the scope of the loop.
&gt; 
&gt; IIRC C++ at some stage allowed declarations like above, but that the
&gt; scope continued beyond the loop. During one of the revisions of the

I'm pretty sure it's never been like that, even before when C++ was a standard. While we're name dropping Robert Lafore of "The Waite Group's C Programming Using Turbo C++", a SAMS book (C)1990 thinks that's the case. Ditto for Jesse Liberty who's repsonsible for "Teach yourself C++ in 24 hours" by SAMS, (c)1999.
As you guys seem to love wasting time reading useless crap, here's the November 1996 draft of the ANSI C++ standard, for you as you mentioned having trouble finding it...
<A HREF="http://www.comnets.rwth-aachen.de/doc/c++std/">http://www.comnets.rwth-aachen.de/doc/c++std/</A>
It's very very long winded, so if you really want, you can read it, but I wouldn't bother.

It strikes me as quite odd the lengths of trouble you guys are going to to try and bring me down, over a point anyone who could participate in this argument would have burnt into thier brains.. you can't really take C++ very seriuosly if you don't even know of this basic rule.

hat bool thing... as I said, I removed all things like that, so I can't give an example anymore. It was a while ago. Though I can assure you I've never used bools in MSVC.. I've been distrusting of them ever since I learnt Assembly, and discovered that not only do most compilers store them in ram as ints, but that it was the international standard to do so.

that class thing, yeah, I was too hasty in my decision there.

That strcmp thing, I tell no lie. I traced through it many, many times. I couldn't beleive it myself. It was in a function that parsed a text file for configuration options, (and my wavefront model loader, but I nailed it in the config loader, because that came first). Simple enough function to write. Which is why it was the last place I looked. Strcmp being a standard function, it was the last place I looked within the config parsing function. I've never been able to duplicate it in an isolated environment. But at least one of strcmp's arguments was a constant string. And randomly, parsing the same data each time, it would return NULL. Replaced strcmp with my own functions, and its never failed since. I'm as puzzled as you are skeptical. It usually took a few hundred calls, but it would happen sooner or later. I'll dig up the code, and see if I can get it to do it again. Hopefully I've still got the backup's.

And Romana, where's your delirious whinging about these 2 old bastards picking on a youth? Oh so its only one sided.. well thats fine. Double standards make up the world, I'd hate to see anyone change that. ^_^''
