some (most?) of that was it sitting waiting for the "network"
(so it said anyway - minimal boot messages I noticed) maybe
you've got nfs or dhcp or something set up?

&gt; Again, sorry but I hate it when tools just don't work as they are

personally I don't care about things like the fancy "slideshow"
stuff.  I would've been happy with you just talking and showing
the pics, it didn't need to be a slick sales presentation (which
are usually all the effort put into the presentation rather than
the content.  (not saying yours was like than Ian)
(and thanks for the talk anyway, I'll definitely be going to
next years linuxconf!)

Or just use a web/html thing like David Rowe (voicetronix) did,
then you know it works (cos you can edit the source in vi!),
can use any browser to view/display it, and afterwards can just
whack it all on the web for people to read themselves.
