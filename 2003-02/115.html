Confidence in Open Source Growing 
Jan 07, 2003
By Lorraine Cosgrove Ware 

Executive Summary 

 According to our November, 2002 survey of 375 IT
 professionals, the IT community is growing more comfortable
 with the open-source development model, reporting that open
 source will dominate as their Web server application
 platform and server operating system in five years. The
 majority (64%) of companies surveyed are using open source,
 most frequently as a server operating system and for Web
 development. 

 CIOs say the greatest benefits from using open source are
 lower total cost of ownership, lower capital investment and
 greater reliability and uptime compared to their existing
 systems. IT executives report that open source provides
 greater flexibility, control and faster, cheaper application
 development. All things equal, the majority of IT executives
 surveyed said they would choose open source for a new
 implementation over a proprietary vendor solution. 

 CIO Research Predictions 

 Adoption of open source into the enterprise is gaining
 momentum and will continue at a slow and steady pace. Users
 are beginning to view many software applications as
 commodity products with little differentiation between
 vendor offerings. Open source provides organizations with
 another compelling choice that offers the flexibility,
 quality and reliability necessary to implement many
 functional applications to run a business. Faced with budget
 constraints, open source allows CIOs to get started on IT
 initiatives that cannot wait for funding before being
 deployed.
