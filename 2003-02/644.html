On the Wednesday of LCA 2003 I caught Rasmus Lerdof (father of PHP) for 
his first tutorial Introducing PHP. He put on a great show and I came 
away convinced that there is a need for me to learn this language for 
my web work.

ZDNet.com.au had some interviews with Rasmus during LCA and this 
excerpt may perhaps put some wind beneath your wings.

"What do you think of open source in government and education? 

It's common sense that they should not rely on closed source, because 
they don't know exactly how it works. Microsoft have come out saying 
they are releasing their [Windows] source code, but there are going to 
be all sorts of restrictions on that. I’m sceptical of that. With open 
source stuff they can hire people to read and audit the code and they 
don’t have to sign the really nasty non-disclosure agreements. 

More on the education side they should use open source software. It 
makes no sense to base an educational system on property software. All 
you are doing is generating new customers for a company as opposed to 
creating the people that might be the next Microsoft. For example if 
you have a database course, use an open source database and show them 
how the database works. Not everyone is going to dig into the guts of 
this thing, but there will be two or three kids in every class that 
will, and from what they will learn they can build the next great 
database. It’s crazy when educational systems don’t go with open source 
and go all Microsoft. That is where governments really should be 
pushing universities. 

Doing a Masters of .NET? Now that’s a joke. Governments at the national 
level should push universities to go with open source systems, despite 
the kickbacks they might receive [by opting for proprietary systems]. 
In the long run it’s going to help a lot more than it’s going to hurt. 
I’ve met a lot of MCSE folks, some of them are great, some don’t know 
anything. Some people are great at taking tests, they couldn’t do any 
independent thinking if it killed them.

You may have to sign up to ZDNet Builder but it is free and there is 
usually lots of interesting stuff there.

Cheers,  Ian
