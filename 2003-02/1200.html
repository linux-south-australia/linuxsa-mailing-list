&gt; I should have been specific as well,   :-)
&gt;
&gt; I have read that serial connections worked.

&gt; USB did not work in the Lindows forum.

Here is a post directly related to Palm/Evolution:  

&gt; i've been using evolution as my palm-Desktop'ish software on lindowsOS 
&gt; for quite some time now. the latest version of evolution on CNR does 
&gt; NOT include evolution-pilot, which is the part of evolution which 
&gt; gives you conduits to sync the calendar, addressbook, and todo's from 
&gt; your PalmOS gizmo.
&gt;
&gt; since the latest version came out in CNR (ver 1.2.1) my conduits were 
&gt; missing, as were of course everyone's. i've sent an email regarding 
&gt; this and i'm sure that evolution-pilot will eventually be added again, 
&gt; but for now i've just extracted the files from the .deb available at 
&gt; ximian and copied them to their respective places. this seems to work 
&gt; fine and prevents the horribly crippling dependancy issues (CNR won't 
&gt; install anything once there is a dependancy problem with an app - so 
&gt; if you force-install evolution-pilot, CNR stops working)
&gt;
&gt; if anyone out there has little experience with linux and really wants 
&gt; their palm sync'd up again, let me know and i can send you a nice easy 
&gt; file to double-click on and be done. otherwise just wait a bit and 
&gt; watch for evolution to be placed on the top of the 'recently updated' 
&gt; apps list...

&gt; im just sick of fixing windows all the time

&gt;
This is Lindows however, with one other factor to be noted as stated by 
a Lindows.com engineer:

&gt; The detector rewrites lilo.conf every time you boot with added or 
&gt; removed bootable devices. Sometimes it gets run for other reasons too, 
&gt; like an updated package, so your changes could disappear. You could 
&gt; disable this by removing /sbin/fooze, but of course my concern is to 
&gt; get the detector working for everyone.
&gt;
Basically every time the machine reboots,  a fully configured Handspring 
Visor  requires a new setup.

A motto perhaps........."Lindows, turning Linux into Windows!"
