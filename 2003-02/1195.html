Richard,

That's very interesting.
I thought that it would have been the "eth1" driver that 
was to blame since it is first
in the list of devices waiting for IRQ and it is the mouse which is
suffering, not the network card.

The relevant ethernet card driver uses SHIRQ as a
parameter to permit IRQ sharing when calling request_irq, and in the file
/usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386/keyboard.h
there's this:

=========================================================
#define KEYBOARD_IRQ                    1 

/* ... */

#define kbd_request_irq(handler) request_irq(KEYBOARD_IRQ, handler, 0, \
                                             "keyboard", NULL)          

/* ... */

#define AUX_IRQ 12

#define aux_request_irq(hand, dev_id)                                   \
        request_irq(AUX_IRQ, hand, SA_SHIRQ, "PS/2 Mouse", dev_id)       
=========================================================

So the keyboard does share its IRQ, in theory at least.
The above functions are used in the file
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c to request the IRQs.
The keyboard IRQ is not shared however.

As I understand it, the idea is that multiple device drivers
waiting for a shared IRQ are offered the interrupt until one of the
drivers indicates that it has been serviced.
(Or maybe they all get a go at it, I forget.)
Then once a second, there's some sort of watchdog-type "process" in
the kernel which wakes up device drivers for some reason, and
that's what I'm seeing - this watchdog activity.

So in my case, my mouse driver is just not being offered the interrupt
when it should be, and that could only be if the ethernet driver
is falsely indicating that the interrupt is serviced.

Well now I've check the file
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
and the function handle_IRQ_event() shows clearly a for-loop which
does not take any notice of what an interrupt handler says about
the interrupt being serviced. This is confirmed by reading the
ethernet driver /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/8139too.c also.
There are no actions in the 8139 handler which affect anything but the
PCI network card.

Here's the irq.c code for invoking irq handlers:

-----------------------------------------------------
        do {
                status |= action-&gt;flags;
                action-&gt;handler(irq, action-&gt;dev_id, regs);
                action = action-&gt;next;
        } while (action);    
-----------------------------------------------------


Therefore there are no logical circumstances that I can see where the
ethernet driver could deprive the PS/2 handler of the interrupt call.

I'm pretty certain you're right about the PS/2 mouse driver
not being good at sharing the IRQ, but I just can't see it logically
in the source code.

It's odd that my uname -a command gives me:
Linux dingo 2.4.0-4GB #1 Wed Jan 24 15:55:09 GMT 2001 i586 unknown

but /usr/src/linux points to /usr/src/linux-2.4.5.
I assume there's no difference in the driver source there.

Can you give me any clues as to where in the PS/2 mouse code
I might look to find the cause of the problem?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
