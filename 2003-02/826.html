&gt; &gt;I like User Friendly but that doesn't equate to MORON friendly.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree - but I think there are hints of ideas emerging which makes windows
&gt; what it is.
&gt; For instance the default win?? install pretty much gets you going off the
&gt; bat in regards to the basic system surfing etc
&gt; Linux is somewhat more convoluted than this but not too far off the mark at
&gt; least with most distros.
&gt; I think KDE has done better than gnome (havent seen the later gnome) in
&gt; packaging a lot of the 'unfriendliness' of linux out of site. Lindows may
&gt; have done similar I dont know about that either.

One of the other interesting points here is that the Windows desktop is a
singular entity.  There is no alternative.  Linux brings a whole new world
of diversity with different Window Managers that you can turn on and off
and configure to your heart's content.  It would seem of course that Gnome
and KDE are the biggest winners here -- Red Hat comes with KDE installed by
default, and if you train a receptionist in KDE, she's going to have to
re-learn how to use Gnome when she switches.  It's to be expected.

But is the user-friendliness sacrificing user-interface?  When I use KDE or
Gnome, I see so many elements of Windows surfacing through, especially in
things such as, well, right-click on a desktop icon in Gnome 2.2 and select
"Properties," then tell me that the dialogue box you're looking at doesn't
look amazingly like Windows'.

Windows is like Happy Pants and Hypercolor T-Shirts.  Microsoft add so many
things to the UI, then after a while they're changed or forgotten.  It
sometimes seems that in the same way Gnome/KDE pick up on that and "copy"
some of the features/interfaces that Microsoft are doing.  Is that to bring
in a certain familiarity for Windows' users wanting to convert (a-la
Lindows?)

&gt; There may also be an argument of too much variety available which just
&gt; confuses people which package do I install WTF is gnome-1-1.2.rpm etc etc
&gt; there is no NICE NEAT why of saying 'GNOME Desk Top Latest'.exe which they
&gt; can get and install.

That i definitely agree with, and the FreeBSD Ports system is a
brilliant implementation of a system that helps you keep up-to-date.


The average user is scared of editing his kernel just to add sound-support.
He wants to be able to stick in some drivers and have them do all the work
for him.  That's what he's used to doing.
