&gt;From my experience, I can't speak for the other Visual's... but VC is a
brialliant IDE... 
They all look the same to me. Tried Borland?

&gt;
&gt;But seriously, I used to think it was a brilliant program, until I started
discovereing the bugs. Imagine what it feels like to spend 6 months
doubting your own code (doubting yourself), to find out it was the compiler
all along. 
Well in my case it's usually the programmer :(

&gt;Fortunately I had used the DOS port of GCC before I used MSVC, so
eventually I decided that it wasn't my fault, that it was Microsofts (which
I later proved to be true). 

What was the error?

&gt;When you code for MS products, there usually is a work around. 

I find this daily especially using .NET stuff it's not the learning curve
it's the stupidity of their decisions in the implementation of some of
their stuff. (in VB.NET )


&gt;but MS always finds a way to blame you. It was only that I had GCC to back
me up, that I knew something was wrong. It wasn't until I ported the code
back to DOS (and gnu gcc) only to find it worked flawlessly that I
suspected something was wrong. Sadly, for you, there is only one BASIC(etc,
whatever your visual choice is) vendor these days... so you can see how
you've got the short end of the stick, right?

Well the VB5/6 is fairly straight forward and undemanding (for me anyway)
their VB.NET sucks for a number of reasons.

I was hopeing something would happen with gnomebasic but it appears to have
died. And there was some talk about a .NET compatable open source project
from someone (XIANG???) but I dont know where that went.
