Ian,

&gt; I was kinda hoping to have the best of both worlds. Get the technical 
&gt; stuff that has to be setup under licenses/regulations
&gt; (rigging/internet connection etc) to be set up by the licensed people
&gt; and the other stuff done by community people wherever possible. I do
&gt; not want to pay them (whoever) a huge amount of money, just the amount
&gt; that it costs to do the job they are asked to do. 

You don't understand.

The licence to carry Internet traffic over a wireless network is a
separate issue from who sets up the network. As far as I can tell, if
Telstra decided to use Air-Stream's current wireless network they could
_legally_.

&gt; My overall goal is to build up community resources and this of course 
&gt; includes skills transfer wherever that might be possible. This should
&gt; also lead to a skilled team of volunteers able to carry out such tasks
&gt; for the community and so become another community resource.

I'm talking the lacky stuff. Getting people on roofs, pointing aerials
and such.

&gt; While it might not be politically/technically advisable I still cling
&gt; to a hope that this network will in some way support the goals of
&gt; AirStream to move (through us or alongside us) out into the Northern
&gt; suburbs. 

It will; I'll talk to you in person about this.
