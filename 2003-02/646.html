&gt; 1. What a shame you didn't respond to my message of last week reminding 
&gt; folks that businesses had until 11 February to apply for up to $500 of 
&gt; training funding. Your courses sound like they would have been eligible 
&gt; and probably quite helpful to a number of businesses like mine.

My bad. I was tossing up whether or not to suggest this post be made. I
think most of us try to do the right thing and not spam the list, but I
figured that this was actually relevant to the list.

&gt; 2. You didn't give us any indication of cost. That would help me decide 
&gt; if I wanted to head to your page for more information or not bother. 
&gt; Now that I have missed the closing date for the funding I am no longer 
&gt; a candidate but it might have been fun to complete the course.

Whilst quite commercial in nature, Nina's post is quite related to Linux
in general. I think that she did the right thing by not putting pricing
and stuff in the e-mail, purely to keep as far from being spam as
possible. Feel free to contact any of the guys at IIT training should
you have any queries.

These links may provide you with the information you need:
