&gt; &gt; David Lloyd, you are clearly not a programmer, so please keep your
&gt; &gt; programming thoughts to yourself. Maybe you opinion will matter after
&gt; &gt; the Linux version of Visual Basic comes out, until then, go play with
&gt; &gt; your tinker toys.

&gt; Now, if I were to run that program I would get the following result:
&gt; 
&gt; "Daniel Burke &lt;<A HREF="mailto:burito@airnet.com.au">burito@airnet.com.au</A>&gt; does not check archives before
&gt; speaking!"
&gt; 
&gt; ..it would also return the result 1.
&gt; 
&gt; *hmmm*
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't program eh?
&gt; 
&gt; Why don't you check:

&gt; I understand BASIC, C, C++, Pascal, LISP, Prolog, Perl, Java, JavaScript
&gt; and Python.
&gt; 
&gt; I *suggest* you get your facts right ;-)
&gt; 

Well you just showed you have some scripting skills.. what about programming?

You wrote a perl script that returns 1 on succes? I think that sums up your programming skills pretty well. I don't worry about scripting languages, but last time I checked, it was traditional to return zero on succes.. correct me if I'm wrong...

I checked your site.. I saw you gloat about alledged knowledge of a programming language, and a few scripting languages. Oh and java. But where is the proof? A 5 line script is hardly programming skill. You have never written a program it seems... it also seems, you have never written a program for multiple platforms...

Now I write in C, C++ and x86 Assembly, I use them often. I have written several programs for several platforms, even though my linux software isnt there (if you doubt me, I'll send you a binary.. elf ok?)

Vague knowledge of a few languages does not make you a programmer. You have shown yourself to be a script kiddy, which was never doubted. So go back to your tinker toys, script kiddy.
