While talking to folks at Playford City today they mentioned that there 
are suburbs along Peachy Road that still have greater than 45% Housing 
Trust ownership. Give it a year or so and that will be corrected. 

While there are pockets of public housing like that the State 
Government and Local Government are working together to get those 
suburbs sorted out properly. Just because things went awry a few years 
back doesn't mean they cant learn from their mistakes.

BTW, just as a suburb with high public ownership is likely to be a 
problem area, so is the other problem of elite suburbs where there are 
no public owned houses - (reverse ghettos even?).

And just to keep this ontrack, the availability of low-cost wireless 
delivery methods means that community groups may be able to get access 
to the wide world of the net instead of just wishing they had the funds 
to afford to.

"Community Networking is not about the technology and what it can do. 
It's about the needs of communities and how communities can use 
technology strategically to meet those needs."

Cheers,  Ian
