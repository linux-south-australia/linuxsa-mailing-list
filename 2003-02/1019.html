I received an email solicitation/announcement stating that Microsoft has 
acquired Virtual PC:

&gt;We are announcing today that Microsoft Corporation has
&gt;acquired the virtual machine solutions of Connectix
&gt;Corporation including Virtual PC for Mac, Virtual PC for
&gt;Windows and Virtual Server. We at Connectix are very
&gt;excited about this venture, as it will greatly benefit
&gt;existing Connectix customers as well as future users of
&gt;virtual machine technology.
&gt;
When I was young, my mother couldn't afford day care, so she took me 
with her to Central Oregon Community College during class time. I 
remember  one very odd film that played in a class of hers. It had a 
scene that I remember clearly....and its what I wish could be done to 
the Microsoft judge:

    There was a picture of a person resting in front of a black 
background. Another picture of a person then came down from the top of 
the screen     and lifted off the silouette's forhead as if it were made 
like a lid and said:

    "HELLO DOWN THERE!"

The Microsoft Judge needs a good dose of this, but I guess that is only 
for the movies! :-(
