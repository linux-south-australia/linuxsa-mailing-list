Not using AirNet are you. Lately you would have been very happy if your 
ping times were as *good* as that.  Dunno what they have done to their 
servers lately but something has really gone astray in there somewhere.

Sometimes we have 5, 10 or many more hops just to ping their servers, 
routing through iPrimus may not be the fastest way to get us into the 
Internet &lt;sigh&gt;

And as for folks signing on at 1 Am Monday morning and getting kicked off 
because of the 2 hour limit at 3 AM !! WTF? It just cant be so congested 
on their modem bank at that time, only us geeks are up then :-)

Nah, the natives are very restless. We stayed with them through the 
Telstra debacle which cost so many of their users big bucks (doubled our 
phone bills). Now we are getting crapped around again and no word is 
coming back explaining the problems. 

Then there was the scheduled downtime last Sunday that suddenly happened 
without warning and stayed down into the morning when they couldn't get it 
back up. Seems we the public don't get advised of scheduled downtime 
unless we are on their separate downtime notice list, I'm on their list 
now but I should have been advised of the last downtime so that I could 
tell my other 5 account holders what the problem was. 

Another member has 10 other account holders waiting to see how AirNet 
respond to his complaints. 

Telling him that the disappointing connection rate and line speed was 
because of phone line noise when he is connecting through home ISDN just 
doesn't ring true to me but what would I know. Now they have blocked DOV 
off those lines - WTF?

This is not the right way to say thanks for being loyal customers.

Cheers,  Ian
