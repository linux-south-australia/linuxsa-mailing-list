Quoting Steve Pryde &lt;<A HREF="mailto:steve@prydelinuxsoftware.com">steve@prydelinuxsoftware.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; I found that some KDE options are missing in RH8 (RH is very biased towards 
&gt; gnome, since they contribute to gnome's development), the kde menus have been
&gt; modified (they 'look' like gnome menus - not talking about the menu items 
&gt; themselves), the install wouldn't recognise my keyboard in some places - had
&gt; to click multiple times on a text field and after a while it would work.

I don't think RH8 is biased towards GNOME, rather it is biased against both KDE 
and GNOME, in a sense.  If you go and install a vanilla GNOME 2 from tarballs 
you'll also see that RH8's interface isn't that either.

Their interface, Bluecurve, is supposedly a merger of the two.  There's GNOME-
specific stuff that's not in RH8 too.

But you have to look at the market they're after with RH8 - they want a 
consistent desktop that can be rolled out to the "enterprise".  Apps in this 
environment, whether they be Konqueror, Evolution, Mozilla or Open Office 
should all work the same.  It might not be what J. Random Hacker wants on his 
kewl overclocked transparent-case dual-cpu AMD home server, but in a corporate 
environment perhaps it is.

If you *really* want a vanilla KDE or GNOME you can install it yourself (or 
install Mandrake while they're still around[1]) and live with the fact that 
keyboard accelerators aren't the same for applications of both flavours, that 
with KDE you single click and GNOME you double click etc. etc. etc.

At a lower level, through freedesktop.org, there is more cooperation between 
the projects now than there's ever been.  At the high level there's now an 
effort to merge the Human Interface Guidelines (HIGs) of both projects, so 
you'll start to see more similarities between them, independant of what distro 
you use.  All this is a GoodThing(tm) for Linux on the desktop, IMHO.

Ciao,

Michael...
[1] I'm not being anti-Mandrake here.  You want them to stay around?  Then pay 
them for the software you love to use.
