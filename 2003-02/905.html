I am really only commenting on the issue mentioned in Greg's Blog :-)

As someone who has worked on GPL'd code, and who also works for a company 
that hopes to ship a very successful NAS device, this issue is of great 
interest.

I think that the GPL is _only_ an issue for commercial organizations, and 
even then, it is only an issue for commercial organizations that want to 
gain rapid entry into the marketplace at low cost by taking publically 
developed software and leverage that to make money, without giving 
anything back :-)

I think governments should not have an issue with GPL'd software, because 
whatever they develop should be mainly for internal consumption, so they 
are not required to release the source code if they do not want to, or, 
since it was developed with public funds, should be freely available to 
the public.

In addition, organizations that do not sell software, but rather provide a 
service, or sell other products and use software in the process, should 
not have an issue with the GPL.

Of course, I have ignored the support issues, but I think that software 
support organizations have an easier job with GPL'd software.

The last comment I would like to make is about those organizations that 
are using a mixture of GPL'd and other software in building their 
products. I personally only have experience with Samba being used in that 
manner, and on the whole, I see that most of the companies that use 
Samba are actually contributing lots of code back to the code base.

Of course, in some areas, we do want to be able to not divulge some of 
what we are doing, but that is relatively easy to do: Simply hide it 
behind a system call interface. Sure, we will have to contribute back all 
the code in Samba etc, but we don't have to contribute what lies beyond 
the system call.
