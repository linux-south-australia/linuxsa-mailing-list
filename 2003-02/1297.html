&gt; 
&gt; Welcome to the dumbass spammers who either:
&gt; 
&gt; a. use a badly written relay tester that insists on trying 20,000 times or
&gt; b. don't understand the words "550 Relaying Denied"
&gt; 

Is there some SMTP status code that would discourage the spammers
more than 550?
The same IP addresses just keep coming back.

-------------------------------------------------------------
On a related subject, I wrote some Apache software which returned
the status code 503 (Service Unavailable). This code is supposed
to indicate server overload at the very least.

(HTTP codes are here for the curious: 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html</A>#sec6.1.1 .)

But I found that an awful lot of rampant downloaders were
programmed to try again immediately if they get a 503 code in HTTP.
Instead of backing off, they became more aggressive!
So I changed the code to 200 to make them think that they had
already got the file. Then this aggressive behaviour stopped.
So the result is that I'm operating a web server which uses the
wrong status codes because the correct ones receive such a stupid
response by some software.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Now returning to the STMP status codes, I was wondering if there
was some code other than 550 which would cause the calling
software to think that there was no need to make another dozen
attempts as they do now.

The current storm has finished now.
It started at 20:00 and finished at 21:30.
In all cases that I've looked at, the storm starts on a half-hour
and finished on a half-hour.
And it comes from multiple IP addresses all round the world - mostly in
the usual places where spam tends to come from, like Brazil, Poland, etc.
rather than the US or Australia.
Maybe there's some sort of zombie controller which activates a bunch
of open relays or hacked machines to do this.
But why would they make hundreds of attempts every day to get
e-mail through to me?
What _benefit_ do they get from this???

I'm reluctant to add another couple of dozen rules to my iptables
script. (I already have well over 100 exclusion rules in my HTTP chain.)

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
