&gt; Yesterday Adam internet had an outage again thanks to Telstra, 
&gt; however, when it came back online, for some phantom reason, my linux 
&gt; box wouldn’t connect. I have now installed Redhat 8.0 as it needed an 
&gt; update anyway.. and there is still the same problem after running 
&gt; adsl-setup
&gt;
FYI, we had an OpenBSD box a few weeks ago that just stopped working 
with PPPoE. The ADSL authentication process is presented to us only as 
Radius with CHAP passwords, and due to various filtering we're limited 
to a mostly 'yes' or 'no' response. There's not much we can change with it!

It might be worth plugging the adsl modem into your linux system via a 
crossover cable, to eliminate any other network device interfering while 
you test. There are also numerous alternatives to roaring penguin, it 
might be worth giving one of them a go.

In vaguely related news, Telstra faults today has been intermittently 
answering 'the number you have called has been disconnected' .. well I 
thought it was amusing anyway :)
