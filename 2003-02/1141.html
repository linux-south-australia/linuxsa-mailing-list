This view depends on where you are coming from. Any thinking person will 
be aware that there are many sides to the story.

Let me first say that I grew up in public housing in Darwin. In those days 
we treated public housing with some respect, perhaps because we were 
paying reasonably commercial rents. Now-a-days, like so many others, I 
lament the decline in behaviour of so many people.

I had the 'privilege' to live next door to two housing trust houses in SA, 
and to live not far from others. The way tenants treated those houses was 
deplorable, and the attitude of many was much the same. 

Of course, not all Housing Trust tenants are like that, but then, is there 
really a need for a huge bureaucracy to do what the private sector and 
rent relief funding could achieve at a much lower cost?

This is to be contrasted with the tenants we had in our rental house; 
in one case they filed for bankruptcy, and while these tenants failed to 
pay us some six months worth of back rent, not one trashed our house 
or left it in poor condition. 

So, I think that public housing in SA is not working :-( It fails to take 
into account human behaviour.
