&gt; That might be true but do you want to pay Airnet or Bigpond or Internode

I was kinda hoping to have the best of both worlds. Get the technical 
stuff that has to be setup under licenses/regulations (rigging/internet 
connection etc) to be set up by the licensed people and the other stuff 
done by community people wherever possible. I do not want to pay them 
(whoever) a huge amount of money, just the amount that it costs to do the 
job they are asked to do. 

The Federal Sustainable Regions program is an innovative funding method 
for regions and they are looking for innovative projects to fund. The 
experiences a company would gain by helping build this project should be 
great references for future innovative work in other communities and other 
regions. If this comes off as hoped for it will be looked at as a model 
for many other areas.
 
&gt; If you do it yourself you could provide training opportunities
&gt; for young people in the building of a real network.
&gt;

My overall goal is to build up community resources and this of course 
includes skills transfer wherever that might be possible. This should also 
lead to a skilled team of volunteers able to carry out such tasks for the 
community and so become another community resource.

&gt; they'll be using similar gear to Air-Stream...
&gt;

While it might not be politically/technically advisable I still cling to a 
hope that this network will in some way support the goals of AirStream to 
move (through us or alongside us) out into the Northern suburbs. 

I am a big picture guy and I see co-operation as the direction to aim for. 
There are enough detail folks around who can probably find faults with 
that but perhaps these problems can be negotiated around for the good of 
all. I would hope so.

Cheers,  Ian
