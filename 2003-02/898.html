&gt; &gt; What of your programs?

&gt; I'm better at taking a look at other people's programs.

And doing?
 
&gt; &gt; Surely if you would claim to be a programmer, you
&gt; &gt; would have written a program or two?
&gt; 
&gt; Did I claim to be a programmer? I said something to the effect of "why
&gt; don't you code it using non-Windows tools" on the assumption that given
&gt; people seem to be able to write O/S using non-Windows tools they just
&gt; might be able to program an exchange replacement as well.

Surely the thought would've occured to you that programmers would only want programming tips from other programmers? It just cuts me up that your always the first to critisise someone's idea, never backing up your opinions with fact. Granted I only read the more technical side of this mailing list, but I haven't seen you put forward a single solution, only... hmm not insults... the best way I can put it is, your always the first to spill someone's pint.

What it all comes down to is, unless you are a programmer (which you claim not to be) then keep out of programming related discussions. Because your opinion in the field means nothing, because you don't have the knowledge to back it up. It's not just a case of switching from visual C to mingw
