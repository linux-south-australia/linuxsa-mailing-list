 Have we not been through that before. Add in 25 clients per
 server with the telephone line rental at $330 or worse each
 site each year plus the costs of calls and stretch that
 across 3 years of operation and 8 - 10 server points. Add in
 ISDN or similar connection to each server site and see how
 that compares.

 Then add in the $180 or more per site that Telstra rips off
 us to install the extra lines and then add in those costs
 lost because we might move lines/ services from point to
 point.

 Allow for the funding to be based on a once off big-buck
 purchase of all equipment - 200+ client systems etc - and
 you have a very different costing model than copper lines
 that you are thinking of.

&gt; I think that you are creating a
&gt; wireless network but it's not a community, free for all wireless 
network.
&gt;
 It has the potential to be this but it won't be a free-for-
 all suck-my-bandwidth network. It has to be self-sustaining
 and self-funding and it will do that by selling off accounts
 for organisations/people who want access to sites not
 covered in the free list.

 The project will not be accepted for funding if we cannot
 show that it will be self-sustaining. This is why we are
 going to use wireless as we can clear up a major part of the
 communication costs with the initial purchase and from then
 on it is "consumables" that will need to be covered. Things
 like Internet and maintenance and administration/development.
