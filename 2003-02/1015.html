&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;cool. i'm interested how you "mesh" is held together, and how it 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;routes
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;traffic ...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;This is something groups like sydneywireless/awa have spent months
&gt; &gt;&gt;discussing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;im aware of this. as any other groupd i suppose...
&gt; &gt;there has been much politicing, i dipped a toe in some time ago
&gt; &gt;and was warned... this is why i am asking questions now. carefully.
&gt; 
&gt; Warned?

sorry, another group in another coubntry...
 
&gt; Depends who you spoke to, I guess, not all the "community" is as 
&gt; helpful and as friendly as they perhaps should be...

so it seems

&gt; &gt;i suppose "mesh" could be a bit missleading, but in the longrun,
&gt; &gt;its a good name =)
&gt; 
&gt; That wasn't my point - my point was that there wasn't a "mesh" at the 
&gt; moment to even speak of.

all in good time =)
i have been workin gwith adhoc routing software and would like to deploy
more nodes with it =)


&gt; &gt;im not new to wireless, or community wireless, just at the looking
&gt; &gt;but not touching stage, here in adelaide.
&gt; 
&gt; What previous experience(s) have you had?  Curious, you've mentioned it 
&gt; in earlier emails too.

lots =) all in good time...
 
&gt; &gt;&gt;General question.  Depends.  I can see much support if this was
&gt; &gt;&gt;'allowed' by air-stream - that is, community owned AP's used by
&gt; &gt;&gt;businesses for their point to point traffic (over a vpn possibly), and
&gt; &gt;&gt;the equipment is funded by that company.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;ok.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;this point usually gets me chargrilled with inches of my live for
&gt; &gt;proposing it in a "community" group setting. but i had to ask.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I know, most people hate the idea.  I think its an ideal way to 
&gt; develop the network, even if not ideal (hey, its better then nothing).

wireless networks need all the support we can give 'em...

&gt; &gt;i have been bitten by "incorportate" entities before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;not casting nasturtiums on air-stream.
&gt; &gt;but i dont understand why it has to be there...
&gt; 
&gt; Why not?  Its a good working body for a wireless group to work under.  
&gt; Nobody else seems to have a problem with it...

ok, if it works here good. i hasnt worked in other places ive been,
tho some of those fell apart into screaming heaps...

but if it works, lets go with it...

&gt; &gt;&gt;As far as I know, yes.  All these questions you've asked, plus more,
&gt; &gt;&gt;have been discussed over, and over, and over, and over again.  Believe
&gt; &gt;&gt;me :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;there is more ...
&gt; 
&gt; For sure, but not as much as I'm guessing you think :-)

=)

&gt; &gt;true. i have been talking to evelbunny for a long time now,
&gt; &gt;there is quite a bit of useful overlap there, and air-stream
&gt; &gt;can benifit from nodedb's resources.
&gt; 
&gt; air-stream do use nodedb's resources...

theres a bunch more planed and some of the tools in development
is what im talking about. 

&gt; &gt;now, nodedb is in a position where it needs tools/utils
&gt; &gt;in making it a far more useful resouce... i feel nodedb is part of
&gt; &gt;community wireless and needs some help passed their way.
&gt; &gt;client software mostly, but you know what i mean...
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure what you mean, client software for nodedb?  If you're talking 
&gt; kismet style logs being uploaded, eb's against this due to people 
&gt; uploading fake logs (which has been a problem with other nodedb-like 
&gt; sites).

=)

&gt; What kind of help?


cheers,

Kim

see you on the morrow.
