A few years ago while working on our internet site, I visited an
external developer.
That had some fancy gadget that each priviled person had. The webserver
send out a random generated barcode tyoe image and you held the gadget
infront of the barcode and it generated a password or key. So the lock
and key were basically randomly generated on the fly? 

Would a hardware solution like this work?

This is a general question about how to secure data on a DMZ.

I am currently implementing a system that will need to keep patient's 
private information on a webserver ready for download.

I was planning on keeping it on the disk encrypted and only decrypting

it when it was downloaded - i would ssh the files to the machine and
GPG 
them up as they were sent to the machine, then i would decrypt them as

they were requested over the web.

I know that this is not secure as the keys will have to be kept on the

same machine. i.e. anyone with Root access will be able to get the
files ..

However, i can't think of a better way to do it - encrypting the data 
isn't really much of a security measure here - it will just make it 
slightly harder for anyone who gained access to to read the files...


Has anyone got any other ideas on how this could be done?

I really can't think of anything - once someone has root on your 
machine, the games up - they have access to all yuor files. I could'nt

think of any other way to do this, short of rotating keys manually...

Any ideaS?

cheers

jon
