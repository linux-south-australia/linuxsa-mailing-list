Jon,
Many moons ago I worked in the health side and am aware of these issues to
a point.
And currently I am in Retail and I think people are more concerned about
their CC numbers than they are about medical records.

Anyway
1. I suggest no storage of flat files be done on the web server. Use some
form of data reader accessing a DB not on the web server and dynamically
construct what is required on demand. 
2. Secondly you should do this whole process using HTTPS, it will ensure no
sniffing of data.
3. Obvious login/authentication mechanisms to access a restricted area
following HTTPS connection.
4. Encrypt the data using PGP ie the DR's public key so that the DR will be
the only one able to read it.
5. The DR can then use their own private key to read the data

You can't do anything once the MRs hit the destination machine short of a
proprietry applet to read/display the information which will use RSA/pgp
encryption based on the DR's pgp key. The onus then is on the DR to ensure
his database is secure.

&gt;This is a general question about how to secure data on a DMZ.
&gt;
&gt;I am currently implementing a system that will need to keep patient's 
&gt;private information on a webserver ready for download.
&gt;
&gt;I was planning on keeping it on the disk encrypted and only decrypting 
&gt;it when it was downloaded - i would ssh the files to the machine and GPG 
&gt;them up as they were sent to the machine, then i would decrypt them as 
&gt;they were requested over the web.
&gt;
&gt;I know that this is not secure as the keys will have to be kept on the 
&gt;same machine. i.e. anyone with Root access will be able to get the files ..
&gt;
&gt;However, i can't think of a better way to do it - encrypting the data 
&gt;isn't really much of a security measure here - it will just make it 
&gt;slightly harder for anyone who gained access to to read the files...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone got any other ideas on how this could be done?
&gt;
&gt;I really can't think of anything - once someone has root on your 
&gt;machine, the games up - they have access to all yuor files. I could'nt 
&gt;think of any other way to do this, short of rotating keys manually...
&gt;
&gt;Any ideaS?
&gt;
&gt;cheers
&gt;
