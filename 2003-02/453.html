&gt; I was just looking for confirmation that everything needed, even for 
&gt; the control, interface and checking of the network was able to be 
&gt; done with OpenSource. I don't want to tell others that all of this 

Did this ~6 months ago for a smallish commercial project for a few clients, 
was basically debian with a web interface to configure hostap, routing, ip 
allocations via dhcp, 128-bit pptp, etc, but all simplified down so anybody 
could understand it reasonably easily.

I'm in the middle of finalising the engine for another project (Qbalt - 
GPL'ed alternative Cobalt OS), which is basically driven by metapackages and 
a bunch of templates for "drawing" the interface (in other words, anybody can 
create new items for the interface reasonably easily).  After I get the 
Cobalt specific side of things working, one of the first extension packages I 
was going to make for it was the hostap/wireless stuff based off the work I 
did a while ago.  (Note, this project isn't just Cobalt specific, it can run 
on any x86 machine, and mips soon.  Its aim is to create something as easy to 
use as Sun's unit, but with a lot more power & extensibility).

If you're interested, send me an email with what kind of things you'd like to 
see configurable regarding wireless, and I'll keep this into account... 
should have something working within a month or so if all goes well.
