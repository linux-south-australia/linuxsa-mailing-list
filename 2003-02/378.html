I was a comunual-living, self-sufficient hippie after I
bailed from the public service.

My experience has been that grey water use isn't as
straightforward as you'd hope.

Sustained use of grey water from the washing machine and
dishwasher will kill your plants.  The pH is all wrong.
Fruit trees are particularly prone to keeling over.

Grey water from hand dishwashing has lots of suspended particles.
If you store that in a tank, then you've have baterial issues,
and then smell problems.

So you're left with the bath and shower.  If you want to
capture the bath water, you'll need a big concrete laundry
sink for some of the things you might otherwise use the
bath for.

That water works fine, although the traps tend to fill
with hair and need weekly cleaning.  Better trap design
could fix this, but your choice is mainly from irrigation
supplies.

The upside of all this is that plumbing changes for effective
greywater use are concentrated on the bathroom, which is a lot
cheaper than running two sets of plumbing through the entire
house.

You'll still have cleanliness issues with the grey water
tank, but these are minor and solved by completely flushing
the tank every so often and applying a scrubbing brush.

Toilet cistern design need some changes before you can
conveniently use grey water.  There's nothing like going
to the loo, pushing the button and having nothing happen.
It'll be the end of a hard day, cold and raining and you'll
have to drag yourslef outside and put the hose into the
grey water tank so you can flush the loo.
