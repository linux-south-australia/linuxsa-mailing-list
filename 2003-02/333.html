&gt; &gt; ... and the collection tank is fitted with a heat pump to put the
&gt; &gt; thermal energy back into the hot water tank.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You'd have to have a sort of double-flush toilet though, the second
&gt; &gt; flush with clean water, having minimised the volume in the trap,
&gt; &gt; because your toilet would be really vile if you left it full of old
&gt; &gt; sink water. Or you could sterilise the grey water, but that starts
&gt; &gt; introducing nasty-chemical problems.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; there is a development in adelaide that collects the grey and storm water into gravel beds and
&gt; filters the water through rocks and stuff into the aquifer below, then uses this water to water
&gt; the lawn and fill the toilets.
&gt; 
&gt; i think this is the way to go.  they also use some types of wetlands plants to help filter the
&gt; water as well.
&gt; 
&gt; this way, the houses would have 2 water delivery systems, and 2 water disposal systems: 1 sweet
&gt; and 1 recycled.
&gt; 
&gt; the sweet water would be for drinking, showering, cleaning.  the recyled for watering and
&gt; flushing.
&gt; 
&gt; the black water is sewage for the city to handle, the storm and grey water is recylced.
&gt; 
&gt; Calgary has a couple communities that are using water to perform geo-thermal temperature control. 
&gt; the idea is that 20 feet under the ground will maintain 10C all year around.  Which means that in
&gt; summer what it can get to 35C or in winter when it can get to -40C the water being pumped through
&gt; pipes 20-30 feet under the ground will remain at 10C.
&gt; 
&gt; so in winter, a smaller heating bill, and in summer no cooling bill.  only run a 1hp pump and a
&gt; fan system and bingo.  lowing energy costs.

Hmm. You'd need a rather large underground loop to use the water alone. Are you not thinking of the GeoThermal heat-Pump systems? These can use an underground, sealed, water loop that interfaces with the heat-pump via a 'water to coolant' heat exchanger. (instead of the more normal 'air to coolant')

These things are in popular use in the US and Europe, but have never caught on here, probably because the capital costs to install are higher than the standard split system, and the savings pay-back sits out at 3-5 years.

Not common in Adelaide, but there are some around, and a couple of brands on sale. There's one in our basement, and I can say that it rocks!, but the cooling is not free.

&gt; 
&gt; I reckon they should take it one step further and incorperate recycled grey water into the sooling
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; you collect the grey water, and before it enters the aquifer, it passes through a complete cycle
&gt; of the geo-thermal system.  two birds, one stone.
