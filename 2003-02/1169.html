It isn't so much that public hosing is placed in ghettos, it's that they
become ghettos.

South Australia has the highest proportion of public hosting per capita
in the Country.

The South Australia Housing Trust (and others) have learnt a lot about
Public Housing in the last 50 years, specifically limiting the density
of public housing within areas (specifically to avoid another Elizabeth)

I'd prefer to see public housing which is built on a needs basis, I
can't imagine Wireless is on the top of the list for people seeking such
accommodation.

Innovation in design (including taking into account the aspect of the
property), energy efficency, access for people with disabilities,
variability in location, density of construction, placement of
properties based on access to local shops, schools, transport, libraries
would all take precedence over Wireless. (This also includes
consultation with LGA's and other Government departments on long term
strategies to manage other resources including Hospitals etc)

&gt;I've been very impressed with the SA Housing Trust developments I've
seen
&gt;of late.  The town houses at Walkerville, near the start of the O-Bahn
&gt;track, seem quite pretty and are certainly situated in a very nice
&gt;area; and the flats near the Kensington pool, while perhaps a little
&gt;too gaudy for my taste, are also very well positioned.  I consider it
&gt;most undesirable to place public housing in ghettos, and I applaud the
&gt;Housing Trust for building in good locations.
