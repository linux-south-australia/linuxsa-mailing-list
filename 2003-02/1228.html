&gt; I have a request on behalf of a 23-y-o jewish Israeli young 
&gt; man. He sees no future in Israel and would like to come to 
&gt; Australia. He is familiar with C++ and has done some sysadmin 
&gt; stuff, but his main experience has been with various M$ OS.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  What State of Australia would provide his most likely 
&gt; avenue for IT employment? 2.  Ditto - IT training, especially 
&gt; Unix-based? 3.  Would Linux, BSD or ?? be his best avenue for 
&gt; the future?

1. Looking at job ads that I've seen, I's suspect NSW or Victoria (in
that order), but if he's flexible, and is willing to go anywhere, he'd
find it easier. The other thing to consider is the cost of living, and
the quality of life, and IMHO, that makes Adelaide a premium place to
live :) ... Best bet is to get a job, and then decide which state to
live in :)

2. Bigger cities. However, Adelaide has a wealth here. IIT
(<A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au">http://www.iit-training.com.au</A>) run a Hands-on Linux course that Dan
Shearer and Matt Geddes teach (or, at least, last I knew, they did :)
and Richard Sharpe mostly wrote. Also, Adelaide TAFE are doing a lot of
Linux training at present, and this will grow rapidly. However, even
considering this, if he's willing to travel to train (especially if he
has some money so he can afford to), then it doesn't matter where he
lives, he can travel to the training as needed. And of course, no matter
where he is, one of the best ways to learn is to try and see, and
communicate with other people who are experienced (like what we do on
this list).

3. Short term, his best avenue is probably what he's good at. MS OS's,
programming C++, and so on. To prepare for his future, his best bet is
to do things he likes. If he likes Unix, Linux is probably the best
thing to start out on, as it's common and relatively easy to learn (esp
as it's free and all that). However, it's definitely worth getting
familiar with a BSD and a commercial Unix (Solaris would be ideal here),
as that really broadens your understanding and job prospects.
