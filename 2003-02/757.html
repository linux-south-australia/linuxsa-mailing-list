This is an interesting thread. I have been pondering why SO many corporate
people are gainst Linux and or open source. I face the problem at work when
I advocate investigating Mysql on linux (or even NT) I get glazed looks.
Openoffice gets the same reaction. I have yet to suggest anything which
will light managements eyes up. I tried the money thing but even still they
seem reluctant.

Digression:
I was going to seek some information about visting an existing site which
uses this stuff in production. Not some micky mouse setup but a real
commercial environment in a similar operation to us. ie large DB lots of
users and internally developed robust (not mine of course :P) GUI apps. As
yet I have fully compiled my thoughts on this but when the licensing of SQL
2k etc comes in at 15k it may make sense to look at different options.

&gt;the open source nature of it. It can't be stolen but it can't be sold

&gt;what they need or want they buy what someone tells them they need or 
&gt;want. Nobody is going to market Linux like Microsoft or even Apple. The 
&gt;people that are smart enough to find out for themselves probably 
&gt;allready have. Just look at Mac OS X.......... how many people run 
&gt;that??? It's all in the hard sell...

&gt;&gt;Commentary: The Greatest Flaw In Linux
&gt;&gt;Saturday February 15, 2003 - [ 01:41 PM GMT ]   
&gt;&gt;Topic - Advocacy
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- By Patrick 'LinuxAddict' Pauwels -
&gt;&gt;The largest flaw with Linux is not in its ease of use or installation.
&gt;&gt;There's no crisis with lack of software. The hardware support is solid.
&gt;&gt;Actually, I feel Linux is very much ready for the masses. The greatest
&gt;&gt;flaw with Linux is that nobody knows what it is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Interesting direction to take. Is he right?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is this a direction we should be focussing on to gather support from
&gt;&gt;within the corporations, schools and organisaions we have to deal with?
