&gt; I'll vouch for Chris in your silly little game. A number of
&gt; organisations I've worked for have been much better off as a direct
&gt; result of Chris' involvement in the Samba team (and probably other
&gt; projects around the place too). In fact, you owe a great deal of thanks
&gt; to a number of people who have graced this list with their presence :-).
&gt; Both coders and otherwise.

I was going to ignore Daniel's message, but I guess I should make a
confession now, lest people send me samba questions :-) I'm not a
member of the Samba team, I just stole this email address (ok, so I
work with Tridge and he gave me an account on the samba machines a few
years ago).

I know amazingly little about Samba, though I did do the
Clearcase/Samba interoperability testing/certification and wrote a
little whitepaper on it when I worked for Linuxcare.

As for what I do, well my business card says "Open Source Hacker",
whatever that means. Generally speaking my day job is to work on the
Linux Standard Base. As part of that I work on developing
certification test suites and specification documents, try to make it
easier to build applications which are portable across various linux
distributions, help distros become LSB compliant, sometimes I even
pretend to be a kernel hacker. Oh and I like to think I play a mean
game of gtetrinet[1].
