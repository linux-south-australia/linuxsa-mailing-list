&gt; The creation of the market for bottled water strikes me as innovative, 
&gt; in that a demand appeared for something that people were mostly getting 
&gt; for free.

In Britain, the traditional jokes about "don't drink x-european-country's
tap water or you'll die of the galloping lurgy" (x usually = France)
suddenly turned into British tap water jokes while the bottled water
market was being established. When everyone had started buying bottled
water (which is more expensive than petrol) the jokes sort of faded
out. Don't know about you, but I find this a little bit suspicious... :-)

But in Britain, water is not free. If you collect the rain that falls
on your roof and drink it, you can be charged for it. If you have a
stream running through your garden and you stick a waterwheel in it to
power your computer, you can be charged for that too. In the Land of
Rain.
