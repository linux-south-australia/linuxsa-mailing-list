Michael,

I don't know mtr but it looks to me like it's showing the route between
you and your destination (c.f. traceroute.)  As such, I should say that
your first hop, apparently being to uunet's adelaide pop, has rather a
poor worst case, however the average isn't bad.  It rather looks to me
like there's intermittent noise on the line, which is most likely to be
on your telephone line (since your ISP almost certainly is using ISDN.)
I have seen this on a modem server with disk problems, but that's
not entirely likely in this case; although note that Slammer is still
out there and disappointing net performance might be because of that.
Did you first notice the problem after Slammer's release?

Pay attention to the quality of telephone calls on yoru line.  If you
ever hear crackly noises, or even worse, faint voices from the ether
(a.k.a. crosstalk), then it's certain you've got line noise, and in which
case put in a service call to your local service provider.  If you *never*
experience these symptoms, and if in, say, a week, the problem doesn't
magically go away, talk to uunet and see if they can help.

David
