&gt;Well after the shameful exercise Tuesday night at Linux SA I am really 
&gt;getting sick and tired of OpenSource not doing what it damned well 
&gt;should be doing, simply working as required!!!!
&gt;
&gt;I wrote my presentation in OpenOffice.org 1.0.2 and it was all working 
&gt;as I completed it at the back of the room. I unplugged, shifted the 
&gt;computer to the front of the room, plugged it in and eventually (damn 
&gt;Lycoris is so slow!) Got the presentation started. Less than 15% of the 
&gt;graphics actually showed on the screen. Why? Who knows. It might be 
&gt;because of buggy software. It might be poor operator, it might even be 
&gt;poor implementation of the JPG handler but it doesn't matter. I trusted 
&gt;it and it let me down badly and left me much embarrassed.
&gt;
&gt;To all the members who turned up, very sorry for the failure, it wasn't 
&gt;expected to be like that.
&gt;
Don't know what your worried about Ian, I for one enjoyed the presentation,
your enthusiasm shone through, I am sure that most people at the meeting 
appreciated
your efforts, and I dare say were suitably envious of your trip.
Looking forward to the checking out the web site.

Take care,

Winton
Have you thought of  Lysol with regard to your virus  :-)
