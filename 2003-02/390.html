The SA Government's Ticket-To-Training program will stop accepting applications after 11 February and I would like to get my hands on some of their 'free' training money.

They will provide up to $500 to any small business (less than 15 employees, less than $450,000 in salary) for legitimate training purposes. 
Money must be spent with an SA accredited training provider for accredited training directly related to the business. 
Training must be completed by May 31 2003.

Ok, so I want to get training to do with Web site design, perhaps PHP or similar. Or perhaps something to do with the WiFi project I am putting together, or perhaps something to do with operating and managing Linux systems. 
I have no interest in learning any MS applications :-)

What is out there that I could access in a hurry? Anybody at TAFE or a Training provider got anything on their books that I could get into for around $500? I am eligible for full concessions and a longer course would see me eligible for the Education Supplement from Centrelink which could mean I could take on a segmented course - part finishing by May, rest going on for following Semester.

Any ideas folks? Feel free to answer me by email but please make it quick &lt;G&gt;

Oh, and if this is the first you heard about it and you think your business could do with some training money go for it.

Cheers,  Ian
