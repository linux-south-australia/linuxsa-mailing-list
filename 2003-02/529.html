&gt; The biggest indicator is that mail takes a lot longer to download than

&gt; Someone pointed me to "mtr".  This is the path to the pop server:

&gt; Now is this what you'd expect?

Looks like a pretty typical dialup connection to me.

&gt; The worst ping times are 3 SECONDS.  

That can happen if you have any traffic with long packets (downloading
mail, for example).  I've seen response times up to 5 or 6 seconds
under such circumstances.  You should be looking at the average, which
shows that your main bottleneck is your dialup line.  Those times
don't look good, though.  Either you have spent too much time tracing
while downloading mail, or there could be line quality problems which
are slowing down the modem.  It doesn't look like the ISP to me.

&gt; that's just down the phone line to my ISP's pop server.
&gt;
&gt; As for time to download mail, 360 mail messages at 1.8Mb takes 33
&gt; minutes to download.  Am I going crazy, or do these times suck?

If you're popping mail, that seems to be par for the course.  If you
have a static IP address, you could use SMTP, which is a lot faster.

&gt; Michael,

&gt; I don't know mtr but it looks to me like it's showing the route between
&gt; you and your destination (c.f. traceroute.) 

It's a graphical traceroute which does multiple requests in parallel
and updates the list you see in real time.
