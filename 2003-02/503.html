I'll concur.

When they first started, they were quite good - support was great, the 
service was reasonable too, but it all seems to have gone to crap 
lately.

ADSL's horribly slow, dialup gets disconnected for no apparent reason, 
had a client last week with connect troubles, called technical support 
for 3-4 days, only to be told I'd be called back, and they eventually 
did after the client insisted they ring them up and abuse them a bit.

Ack.

Probably will be switching most my clients over to Internode very soon 
:-(

In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of
people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
