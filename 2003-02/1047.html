Got it right if my childhood/education years were anything to go by. I 
was often abused, and I mean the word abused, verbally and physically 
(caning, extra work etc) by teachers because I had already read the 
novels by 3rd or 4th week so I lost interest in them fast. They knew I 
was well past the class so their way of moderating was to punish me for 
being ahead. That went on for almost all of my Primary schooling. 

That sucked so I got back at them by failing much of my secondary 
schooling. Except for Maths, I would regularly get 90%+ for Maths 
because it included Computing which in 1968/69 was a really 'modern' 
topic to study.
I was a classic nerd.

Love these paras;
"as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this fake 
world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact 
their primary purpose is to keep kids all locked up in one place for a 
big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And I have no 
problem with this: in a specialized industrial society, it would be a 
disaster to have kids running around loose.

What bothers me is not that the kids are kept in prisons, but that (a) 
they aren't told about it, and (b) the prisons are run mostly by the 
inmates. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless 
facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong 
brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. And if 
they balk at this surreal cocktail, they're called misfits."

Too true, painful to admit it but true.

Cheers,  Ian
