&gt; &gt; But in Britain, water is not free. If you collect the rain that falls
&gt; &gt; on your roof and drink it, you can be charged for it. If you have a
&gt; &gt; stream running through your garden and you stick a waterwheel in it to
&gt; &gt; power your computer, you can be charged for that too. In the Land of
&gt; &gt; Rain.
&gt; 
&gt; That's truly rediculous really.  Next will I be charged for the sunshine,
&gt; or the wind?

My thoughts exactly!

&gt; Who is responsible for charging for rain water,

The local water authority - the same bunch you pay for the piped water
that comes out of the taps. These were local-government-run organisations
until recently; they have now been privatised, but it seems to have
had no noticeable effect for better or for worse, and the regulations
they run under don't seem to have changed significantly.

&gt; and how can they claim ownership to it?

Search me. One of those weird bits of British law. At a guess I'd say
the Queen owns it, like she owns junk washed up on the beach, and by
some legal formalism her rights to it are sort of delegated out to the
water authorities. That's pretty much of a guess. But I do know that
there's no water in Britain that you don't - in theory - have to pay
someone to drink, or even extract the gravitational potential energy
from.

&gt; Just how much is one charged for it?

How much the charge is I don't know. If you refuse to pay your "water
rates" to the water authority on the grounds that you don't use their
supply but catch rainwater, they say "no, you still have to pay for
the rainwater". It's not as much as for piped water but I have a
feeling it's not that much less.

On the other hand, if you don't pay, they have no legal right to cut
off your supply. Not only are they not allowed to build a great big
roof above your house to stop you catching the rain, they're not
allowed to close the stopcock that cuts off your piped supply. So the
weirdness cuts both ways.

Another bit of water weirdness: mixer taps on sinks aren't allowed to
have a common spout in which mixing takes place anymore. They look the
same, but the spout contains concentric hot and cold ducts, so the hot
and cold water are separated right up to the nozzle. The result is
that they don't mix, and if you try to wash your hands under such a
tap you get chilled and scalded at the same time.
