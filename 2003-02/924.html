I guess what I was hoping was that I could use my phone by itself,
without a computer, to do more than just WAP browsing. I want to run
(say) ping on my phone, or nmap or ssh or something. Not particularly
practical for day-to-day use, but could be good in an emergency, when
there is phone but nothing else...

Of course, having a computer connected to it is more practical for
actual use, but I don't want to actually USE it at the price they want
me to pay.. :)

&gt; Subject: Re: [OT] GPRS Question
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a new phone (end of contract, new plan, free phone (6610), 
&gt; &gt; etc), and it has, among other things, GPRS. Does this give 
&gt; my phone an 
&gt; &gt; IP address on the Internet? Can I do Internetty kind of 
&gt; things on my 
&gt; &gt; phone, or is it just WAP? I can't find much other than WAP 
&gt; at present, 
&gt; &gt; but it's got a lot of functionality, and I can add to this by 
&gt; &gt; downloading Java apps as well (ooer). So, any ideas, 
&gt; comments? Anyone 
&gt; &gt; got a link or a brief explanation as to what exactly GPRS 
&gt; is (at the 
&gt; &gt; network level rather than the physical or link levels)? Can 
&gt; I ssh from 
&gt; &gt; my phone?
&gt; 
&gt; I've used GPRS on my phone. Basically you set the phone up as 
&gt; a modem still, set up a ppp connection as per usual - but the 
&gt; phone number you put in is *99* and you leave the username 
&gt; and password field blank.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure about what IP you get, I would presume that 
&gt; it's assigned by the provider - and it would depend on the 
&gt; provider whether they give you a real one or they NAT you. 
&gt; GPRS is mainly marketed towards WAP, which is really only a 
&gt; web browser... Why do you need a whole IP just for one port?
&gt; 
&gt; Using GPRS from the computer as a PPP link however, the whole 
&gt; lot works (well, I tried Outlook Express and ICQ and they both worked)
&gt; 
&gt; The best thing would be to try it and see what happens.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; DR
