Alan,
The SLC can run Linux.  It's a sun4c architecture machine.  I've booted 
linux (from network) on one (I think I owned own for a bit - I still seem to 
have a Sun external disk pack).

As for disposal - there's a place near the airport (near the south eastern 
corner) which is a salvage place - I just can't think of the name currently.

&gt; Admittedly there have been numerous discussions on linuxsa and
&gt; a zillion other forums about re-using aged computers - giving them
&gt; a new life with linux.
&gt; But what if you have an old computer that is really cactus?
&gt; 
&gt; Example: my old Sun SLC whose screen has gone blank for the last time.
&gt; Probably the CPU in it is fine (but only about 13 Mips).
&gt; Probably the old memory in it fine. 
&gt; Maybe there other little bits and pieces of electronics which still work.
&gt; It still has its impressive 20-inch cubic packing box (probably the
&gt; most useful bit right now).
&gt; And it has a cable that could be cut off and used for some dodgy
&gt; amateur electrical work.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything that can be done with such an old never-to-work-again
&gt; dinosaur apart from taking it to the dump?
&gt; (It won't fit in a wheely-bin.)
&gt; 
&gt; I realise that this particular old computer never ran linux, but my
&gt; current 10 linux PCs will all turn to cactus some day, and it would be
&gt; nice to plan for "when the need arises" as they say in the cactus industry.
&gt; 
&gt; In the olden days, I remember I used to go to a place called something
&gt; like Elizabeth Disposals where they sold off a whole warehouse full of
&gt; ex-air-force redundant electronics from WW2. (This was the 1960s.)
&gt; But nowadays, I kind of think that any hobbyist would trun up their noses
&gt; at old obsolete electronics.
&gt; 
&gt; So...  is there a better alternative than the dump?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;
