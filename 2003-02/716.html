&gt; Subject: Partition re-arrangement borked my /home
&gt; 
&gt; Hello folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I am in dire need of help rescuing a seemingly unmountable (but 
&gt; untouched!) partition containing my $HOME.
&gt; 
&gt; In the process of installing the gentoo dist over my previous 
&gt; slackware installation, I decided to create a /boot partition, 
&gt; as they recommended in their docs.
&gt; 
&gt; My partitions were as such, under the previous setup:
&gt; hdb1 / ~10GB
&gt; hdb2 swap ~500MB
&gt; hdb3 /mnt/data (containing /home) ~30GB
&gt; 
&gt; All of these were primary.
&gt; 
&gt; Using cfdisk, I deleted hdb1, and created two new primary 
&gt; partitions in its place.  The resulting partition table looked 
&gt; like this:
&gt; 
&gt; hdb1 /boot ~100MB
&gt; hdb4 / ~~9.9GB
&gt; hdb2 swap
&gt; hdb3 /mnt/data
&gt; 
&gt; I did not change any of the properties for hdb2 and hdb3.
&gt; 
&gt; I rebooted back into the boot floppies I was using to create 
&gt; the partitions.  I then used mke2fs -j to make ext3 filesystems 
&gt; on hdb1 and hdb4.  Then I mounted them.  This worked fine.  
&gt; mkswap and swapon /dev/hdb2 also worked fine.
&gt; 
&gt; When I tried to mount hdb3 (note that I have not touched it in 
&gt; cfdisk or formatted it - it contained my /home dir), I received 
&gt; this error:
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdb3 looks like swapspace - not mounted
&gt; mount: you must specify the filesystem type.
&gt; 
&gt; mount -t ext3 also failed in this manner:
&gt; 
&gt; mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb3,
&gt; or too many mounted filesystems.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked /proc/partitions to make sure that the partition 
&gt; naming scheme hadn't gone funny, but the hdb numbers still 
&gt; corresponded to the correct partition sizes.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I tried debugfs /dev/hdb3, and it said this to me:
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdb3: Bad magic number in super-block while opening 
&gt; filesystem.
&gt; 
&gt; It could not mount the partition either.
&gt; 
&gt; Even though I did not touch it in the partition table, using 
&gt; cfdisk again reveals some changes to the properties of hdb3.  
&gt; It's fs type has changed from "Linux Ext3" to "Linux" and its 
&gt; label has changed from "/mnt/data" to no label at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Please, is there any way I can recover the data on my home 
&gt; partition?  I would value ANY suggestions, as I am sure you
&gt; all can know how important it is to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for any help, and I will be happy to send further info
&gt; if required.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours in hope,
&gt; 
&gt; Tim Riley
