First off:
For some reason my original post was stuck in the linuxsa mailserver for a
long while b/c it though my sender domain (fampeeters.com) doesn't resolve
(I wonder how it was able to notify me of that fact if my domain doesn't
resolve &lt;G&gt;), so even tho my post may appear very late (such a disco was
already going on at that point!), it was posted about the same time as the
other one that started that disco...   ;-)

I am well aware of the hardware compatability issues involved, but I'd still
love to see it because:
1) it'd be another competitor to thwart M$
2) it'll show that you *can* have a good GUI on an open source based OS
3) it'll help some of the hesitants get started with something they can
easily learn, and yet allow them to dig in, experience and learn the many
possibilities of the underlying BSD so that maybe in the future...
4) ...they can become so experienced they'll want to try Linux...

Just my â‚¬ 0.02 worth!

&gt;
&gt; On a generic PC platform, if you have an issue with the sound card, the
&gt; software has to be hacked and fudged to get around the problems. Apple
&gt; just replace the sound card with something that works.
&gt;
&gt; Microsoft are already doing the best job possible with supporting lots
&gt; of different hardware, so what you see from Apple is only possible when
&gt; the manufacturer builds and controls the hardware too.
&gt;
&gt; If OS X was available for PC hardware, it would have all the same
&gt; problems and quirks as Linux and Windows. The bottom line is that the
&gt; idea of a generic OS for different hardware is an engineering
&gt; compromise that doesn't quite pay off in all situations.
