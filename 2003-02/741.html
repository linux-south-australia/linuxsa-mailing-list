&gt; When you look at the Forum discussion at MyOpera the

&gt; the only error by MS is that they have not updated their CSS sheet to 
&gt; properly cover Opera 7.

OK, I must preface this by stating that I know very little about style
sheets, and I haven't read the forum (CBF, really)... However, in my
ignorance, I loudly proclaim my opinion:

Isn't it the case that Opera 7 works fine (well, it does now), but Opera
6 doesn't (still)? And isn't the alleged error in the style sheet
something really dumb, that appears to actually shift content off-screen
(or out of its container, whatever that actually means -- but it sounds
like something you wouldn't do)?

I've read <A HREF="http://my.opera.com/dev/discussion/openweb/20030206/,">http://my.opera.com/dev/discussion/openweb/20030206/,</A> and this
is the impression I got.

OK, I just read page one of the forums, and I still think that if I'm
reading the CSS fragment correctly, that particular fragment seems
designed to break any browser that interprets it correctly (note that
IE6 also breaks when rendering with that style sheet). . . So it doesn't
look like an incorrect update, it looks like a designed-in trap for
browsers they don't like -- whether or not Opera is specifically
targetted, I don't know.
