&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Being dissatisfied with the one reference that I found on the 
&gt; web (i.e. iplusplus), I took the time out of a truly busy 
&gt; schedule to pop into a bookshop today, to see what Bjarne 
&gt; Stroustrop had to say on the matter. In his book, "The C++ 
&gt; Programming Language," Stroustrop specifically says that an 
&gt; identifier defined in the initialiser of a for statement is 
&gt; only in scope within the for statement.

When I was doing a little C++, I also used Bjarne's book, hoping it
would be definitive like K&R. However, every C++ compiler is different
enough from that described in the book that it makes the book
practically of little value. I don't know what the current state of play
is, but a few years back, I recall g++ (the gcc C++ compiler front end)
being the only correct (yet incomplete at the time) implementation
according to Stroustrup's book. Other compilers (specifically, Sun's
compiler of the time) had fundamental incompatibilities which actually
couldn't be overcome without breaking the backwards compatibility of
code already written for that compiler. Not sure why this happenned, but
it did. Wouldn't be surprised if where the initialiser is in scope is
one of those things...

Heard it said once that Bjarne wrote his book about an imaginary
ultimate C++ compiler, which didn't exist at the time (and may or may
not exist yet), and people did _similar_ yet incompatible things to it,
as opposed to K&R, who wrote a compiler that implemented what they said,
so people had something working to code for. This could be wrong -- I
never looked into it :)
