ahh silly me, I thought your aim was to say I didn't check mailing list archives... not to be silent.

&gt; &gt; Vague knowledge of a few languages does not make you a programmer. You
&gt; &gt; have shown yourself to be a script kiddy, which was never doubted. So go
&gt; &gt; back to your tinker toys, script kiddy.

&gt; Are we resorting to name calling now?

Maybe, but what is to be said about someone who dodges arguments? What of your programs? Surely if you would claim to be a programmer, you would have written a program or two? Focusing on my shortcomings does not solve you of yours. Show me a multi platform program you have written, and I will acknowledge you have grounds commenting on the possibility of not using Microsoft Dev Tools. Until then, I'm waiting.
