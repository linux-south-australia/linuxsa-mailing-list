Subject: Re: linux from dos



&gt; Most DOS' support the concept of stdin and stdout.  I've certainly
&gt; used it under DOS with both C and Java programs.

Hmm didn't know that. I always thought of DOS as a crippled child incapable of ever walking.

&gt; &gt;&gt;     int  ch;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Using ints to store chars is naughty.
&gt; 
&gt; Using a char to store the result of fgetc(), which returns an int, is even
&gt; naughtier.  I'm sure this is a C FAQ (it's certainly a C common error).
&gt; See below.

silly me.. I assumed the c in fgetc meant it returned a char
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;     while (ch = fgetc(stdin), ch != EOF) {
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Checking for successful assignment is bad, you actually mean to check
&gt; &gt; success of fgetc()
&gt; 
&gt; Erm, I'm not sure if I've read what you wrote correctly.  Bear in mind
&gt; that I didn't have an issue with this, and what I've coded above is my
&gt; own personal idiom (I always try to separate assignments from tests,
&gt; even within looping constructs).
&gt; 
&gt; Semantically, "(ch = fgetc(stdin), ch != EOF)" is the same as
&gt; "((ch = fgetc(stdin)) != EOF)".  They will even typically output the
&gt; same byte codes (I have checked this on the compilers I used to
&gt; use when I used to care about such things).  In the second
&gt; construct, the side effect of (ch = fgetc(stdin)) is the value
&gt; assigned to ch.  I've just split it up into an assignment, test
&gt; sequence.  It is certainly *not* checking for "successful
&gt; assignment"; the value returned by fgetc() is assigned to ch
&gt; regardless.  It *is* checking that ch hasn't been assigned EOF
&gt; (which is -1, but that's an implementation detail we're not
&gt; supposed to know about).  However, if we've used a signed
&gt; character, then we most certainly will care, because 0xff will
&gt; be downcast to a -1, and neither of the above tests will work
&gt; correctly for character files with 0xff in the stream.  Alternatively,
&gt; if I'd used an unsigned char, then we will never be able to test
&gt; the -1/EOF returned by fgetc(), and the loop will never
&gt; terminate.  Using a char of any sort to store the result of
&gt; fgetc(), then test against, is wrong.

Negative. (ch = fgetc(stdin)) is a test, which will either return 1 or 0.
It is testing assignment of the return value of fgetc to ch. It is NOT the return value of fgetc.
In gcc you are right, on MSVC this is testing the success of the assignment (as if putting a value in a variable can fail, somehow MS manages it). I spent 4 years writting for MSVC so that explains why I have all these fucked up ideas about C. I write games. I would love to write linux only games, but for some reason a large bunch of dickheads think winblows is a good platform to play games on. I swear I'll go crazy... if I'm not already. When/If I finish my game, it will convert a lot of people to linux. On linux my game loads in about a quarter of a second, and about a minute on windows. Thank its memory management.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;             if (fputc(ch, stdout) == EOF) {
&gt; &gt;&gt;                  perror("write");
&gt; &gt;&gt;                  exit(1);
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; exit() is bad karma..
&gt; 
&gt; As an exception mechanism, no it isn't.  It's bad karma
&gt; inside libraries (where the user of the library should be
&gt; offered the chance to terminate a program, not a library
&gt; function), and for similar reasons that applies to lower
&gt; level functions.  As this is the topmost function, it doesn't
&gt; apply.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; its unstable on at least one platform (though I forget
&gt; &gt; which)
&gt; 
&gt; Non-ANSI compliance isn't a reason to not use a
&gt; standard feature of a language.  And most compilers
&gt; actually push the exit() function onto the stack as the
&gt; epilogue to main (i.e. when main has finished executing,
&gt; the return code from main is passed to exit or _exit,
&gt; I forget which).

exit is bad incase you ever decide to turn the program into a function... tell me you've never done that before

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Commenting self explanatory programs is VERY evil. 
&gt; 
&gt; "Self explanatory" is in the eye of the beholder.  I've
&gt; seen self explanatory programs that have had bugs
&gt; in them - are those bugs in there by design, or by
&gt; accident?  With no other supporting documentation,
&gt; I couldn't tell.

Yeah... I suppose I've just seen one too many programs with...
	printf("hello world!"); /* printing the string "hello world!" */
 
&gt; &gt; int *argv[] and int argv[][] are synonyms for each other.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't say otherwise.  Incidently, I have seen one case where
&gt; char * and char[] weren't interchangeable (i.e. char[] = "foo",
&gt; then passed to function as char * which fouled up by pointing
&gt; to the wrong segment), but that was compiler spackness from
&gt; a major vendor.

Um would that be borland's turbo c++? I recall similar behavior in some of the earlier versions.
 
&gt; &gt; stdio.h is included by default in %95 of compilers.
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of compilers do things that aren't in The Standard.
&gt; "//" as a comment isn't supported in ANSI C (yet - I
&gt; believe there's moves afoot to include it), yet that doesn't
&gt; stop a lot of programmers using it, then wondering why
&gt; they get compiler errors on other platforms.  I tend to
&gt; avoid all that grief up front.
&gt;

I guess I should just shoot willy g and save myself the greif
