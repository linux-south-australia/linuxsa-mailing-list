&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Linux Community has to make ease of use and user 
&gt; friendliness _its 
&gt; &gt; top priority_, if it views the statement below as a problem 
&gt; and wants 
&gt; &gt; to solve it.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;big snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Rubbish.
&gt; 
&gt; We have to make education our top priority. Rather than 
&gt; making Linux so moronic that even morons can understand it, 
&gt; why not make the morons more educated so they can understand Linux?

Because that's like trying to herd ants (as opposed to cats, who have a
mind of their own, ants don't...) ...

Rather than trying to make Linux one thing, why not take advantage of
the diversity, and actually be all things to all people. There is no
reason why the people who care about user friendliness can't go making
things user friendly (even to the point of allowing morons to use it),
and people who don't, don't. Perhaps we should take the diversity and
make it a strength, rather than a potential weakness?

&gt; 
&gt; I like User Friendly but that doesn't equate to MORON friendly.

For you, yes. For others, no, and that's ok.

&gt; 
&gt; *tough titties bubs*
&gt; 
&gt; This shift to satisfy the dolts and imbeciles is annoying...

It doesn't need to be. Just stay where you are, and ignore the shift --
it's obviously something that doesn't "do it" for you, so pay attention
to things that do. Remember the diversity thing.
