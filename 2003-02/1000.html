&gt; This is a general question about how to secure data on a DMZ.
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently implementing a system that will need to keep patient's 
&gt; private information on a webserver ready for download.
&gt; 
&gt; I was planning on keeping it on the disk encrypted and only decrypting 
&gt; it when it was downloaded - i would ssh the files to the machine and GPG 
&gt; them up as they were sent to the machine, then i would decrypt them as 
&gt; they were requested over the web.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that this is not secure as the keys will have to be kept on the 
&gt; same machine. i.e. anyone with Root access will be able to get the files ..
&gt; 
&gt; However, i can't think of a better way to do it - encrypting the data 
&gt; isn't really much of a security measure here - it will just make it 
&gt; slightly harder for anyone who gained access to to read the files...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone got any other ideas on how this could be done?

The usual answer here is to use cryptography from end to end.

That is, encrypt the information on the machine before you
upload it to the webserver.  Easiest to use public key
encryption -- for each of the doctors that can read the
file encrypt it with their public key; encrypt it with
the uploader's public key; sign it with the uploader's
private key; and overwrite then delete the plaintext file.

Then doctors download the files, as per usual.  They then
run GPG each time they want to look at the files, supplying
the pass phrase that allows them to retrieve their private
key from the local disk.

To keep key management sane, run a public keyserver on
the same machine as the web server.

This gets you:

  - you don't care if your web server gets hacked

     - you know they could read any of the files
     - you know they couldn't alter any of the files
     - you don't know if anything files were deleted.
     - you need to check that the keyserver still gives
       truthfull answers

  - you don't care if the doctor's machine gets stolen
    or hacked.

     - which will require some discipline from the
       doctors to run GPG each time.  There's some
       nice GPG front ends and key proxies which you
       should look at to make the user experience of
       using GPG nice enough so that doctors don't
       simply keep stuff as plain text.

  - you don't care if the uploaders machine gets stolen
    or hacked.

The private keys are all stored well away from the webserver,
and are protected by passwords.  There's no drama issuing
another private/public keypair should that be necessary.

Note that key issuing is arse-about.  The *doctor* generates
the private key, public key and revocation certificate.  They
write the public key and revocation certificate to diskette and
get this to you (snail mail would be adequate).  You then
put the public key on the keyserver and the revocation certificate
in your safe (you want this for when a doctor leaves the system).

You could alter the key distibution scheme to be more centralised,
but then you're shipping private keys about and an error would
compromise the system.

As you can see, you need to look at security as an entire
system.  I'd suggest that a risk analysis might even show
higher odds of a doctor's PC being stolen then the webserver
being hacked.

Jonathan, if you want more of an explanation then give
me a call.

glen

&gt; Intercepting a one-time key is less disastrous than intercepting a more
&gt; permanent key (provided the algorithm to generate said key isn't too
&gt; predictable).

David, the key distibution problem with very large one-time
keys is worse than distributing much shorter longer-lived keys.
You need to send the doctor a new floppy disk of key material
for each 1.44MB of data they download.

So you're more likely to have a key interception.  Then you just
use that key to do a XOR with the data files until you find
a data file that appears in ASCII.

One-time keys are really only useful for small amounts
of data (eg: a codeword from a espionage agent).
