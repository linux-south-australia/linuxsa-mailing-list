&gt; I have a finance package running on a Red Hat 7.3 server.  It uses mail to
&gt; send a small amount of information to the end user, however more
&gt; importantly, it sends error reports and other things like that to me, as a
&gt; user of the system.
&gt; 
&gt; I have set my virtusertable to forward all mail on the system to our
&gt; primary MX, so now whenever mail is sent on that system to a local
&gt; username, it's forwarded by sendmail to <A HREF="mailto:username@sageautomation.com.">username@sageautomation.com.</A>  That
&gt; works you-beaut, and it means I can pick up automatically generated emails
&gt; and things like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, I think that for some reason, PRONTO (the finance package)
&gt; writes directly to /var/mail/username and I have determined this because it
&gt; is the only application that can avoid having its email forwarded via
&gt; sendmail.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any way I can prevent this?  The mail remains stored in the mail
&gt; files, and I'd rather push the mail to our mail server rather than pick it
&gt; up remotely.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can prevent this, or get
&gt; around it??

If it's writing directly to the mail spool, there won't be a magic
sendmail/mta config change that can fix it. You could either use
something like fetchmail instead or (warning: nasty hack!) create a
FIFO/pipe called /var/spool/mail/&lt;username&gt; and have a perl/python/shell
script or C program constantly reading from that file and passing it to
sendmail when it reads an end of file mark. Fetchmail's the cleaner of
the two solutions.
