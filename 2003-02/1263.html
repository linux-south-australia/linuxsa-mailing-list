Daniel,

My guess is that no-one, perhaps besides David Newall, cares about you 
defending your programming skills.  When you have something to say that 
relevant to &gt;10% of the LinuxSA list, feel free to post.  Until then, please 
leave LinuxSA off the distribution list.

                         Can you afford to miss it? :-)

Quoting Daniel Burke &lt;<A HREF="mailto:burito@airnet.com.au">burito@airnet.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You ought not to think of it as winning or losing, however since you
&gt; &gt; asked me what I think about your previous work: Well of course most of
&gt; &gt; your projects are not presented with source.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of my projects? no.. look again... only the windows ones are closed
&gt; source, because its damn hard to make windows code look presentable.
&gt; Especially when your writting for a real compiler and having to cripple it
&gt; for MSVC too.
&gt; 
&gt; My solar system represenetation is closed source quite simple because I need
&gt; a job, and unscrupulous companies like Ratbag stand far too much to gain from
&gt; stealing my code. The "opengl.zip" is merely a much older version of the
&gt; solar system representation.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In your listrot program you display error messages on stdout instead of
&gt; &gt; stderr, which is rather bad form.  You also assume any file with "BMP"
&gt; 
&gt; Funny that, how you jump on the most pathetic of my programs, which I made in
&gt; about 20 minutes for personal use, which I only distribute for friends who
&gt; want thier boot logo/background rotated.
&gt; Also its a DOS/console program, stderr is not an option. Its not particularly
&gt; easy to access stderr.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; in it's name is a windows bmp file, and you truncate the name after
&gt; 
&gt; Well der, I made it for myself and other similarly literate people. Does my
&gt; homepage look inviting to lesser skilled computer users? Note the complete
&gt; lack of images. The stale layout. The link to the Mozilla guide on how to
&gt; make stale web-pages. I don't want lesser skilled people coming to it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the "P".  More importantly, you make only the most token of efforts at
&gt; &gt; validating user input.  Should the file specified by the user (on the
&gt; &gt; command line) have, say, only one line, your program wanders off into
&gt; &gt; la-la land looking for line terminators that never appear.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you even read the documentation? The instructions are quite specific for
&gt; anyone with reasonable command line skills. What are you a Microsoft
&gt; Employee? Infact the documentation GUARANTEE's it will crash unless you are
&gt; on your toes.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; As a matter of style I think it's better to define local functions above
&gt; &gt; where they are called, rather than to pre-declare them and then define
&gt; &gt; them later.  That is:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    void do_work(){...}
&gt; &gt;    main() { ...; do_work(); ... }
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; is better than:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    void do_work();
&gt; &gt;    main() { ...; do_work(); ... }
&gt; &gt;    void do_work(){...}
&gt; 
&gt; Well as a matter of style good for you. I prefer to have main() at the top,
&gt; but just as you said, its a personal preference thing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, you really should declare all global identifiers static unless you
&gt; &gt; want them to appear outside the scope of the compiland.  I've previously
&gt; &gt; fought with libraries which gratuitously exposed their inner functions,
&gt; &gt; and now I say: Everything static unless you really want it available
&gt; &gt; externally.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look, that's more than enough for a very quick look.
&gt; 
&gt; Who cares? its a dodgy hack. Feck, even the documentation says expect it to
&gt; crash. Even worse, its %90 batch files, but you didn't complain about that
&gt; did you? Do you like them or something?
&gt; 
&gt; How about you have a look at a program not the script.. did you notice it's
&gt; the only one that doesnt list requirements?
&gt; 
&gt; How about you look at a real program, one that isnt a bloated script, like
&gt; say track.zip, nah thats way to big for you to understand. Besides it
&gt; contains direct hardwre programming.. you'd never grasp that. I mean you had
&gt; enough trouble with a script.
&gt; 
&gt; spin.zip is only one source file... but nah... it too contains direct
&gt; hardware access.... hmm you could try looking at hack.zip... but thats an
&gt; assembly program, you'd probably go into convultions.
&gt; 
&gt; Your sticking up for MSVC really makes something look wrong here... hmm...
&gt; are you one of those poor fools who's invested lots of time and money into
&gt; learning microsoft products? Are you a MSCE?'
&gt; Because anyone who seriously uses MSVC, and actually knows the standards,
&gt; will tell you without batting an eyelid that it is horribly flawed... yet you
&gt; sidestep all accusations to that effect.... Are you bill gates? One of his
&gt; employees?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm running an operating system now, of my own design. It never crashes. No
&gt; one owns it. I can freely give it to people. And my sanity is slowly
&gt; returning. If you want I can burn you a copy (89 Minute disc's only, so
&gt; you'll need a half descent CD drive)... however it is not user friendly to
&gt; install... I'm of the opinion that stupid people shouldn't install operating
&gt; systems (let alone software)... system administrators should install
&gt; operating systems. So you will complain about the install interface (a bash
&gt; shell), but if you look past that, when you get it running (if you want I can
&gt; write out the 20 commands needed to install it) you will find its completely
&gt; GUI orientated, and completely skinned. So you should have no troubles
&gt; getting into it. And you can stop taking whatever drug it is thats making you
&gt; keep so overly calm. No one sticks up for microsoft products without either
&gt; being out of thier skull on drugs or being mentally unstable. Do yourself a
&gt; favour... free your!
&gt;  computer... your mind will follow.
