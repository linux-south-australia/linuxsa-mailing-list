&gt; 
&gt; That's a disturbing thought, Alan.  An email server that includes the
&gt; original message in a bounce could be used by spammers to relay, by making
&gt; their intended recipient's address be the apparent sender's address.  I
&gt; bet you are on to the latest tactic here.

Matthew and David,

That's exactly what I worried about.
I thought there must be some benefit to the person who
is sending all this garbage.

However, maybe this line of thought is correct.
The SMTP protocol should only respond to the precise IP address
which initiated the connection.
At worst, I'd be sending back a copy of the mail to the sender.
It's an IP layer matter, not an SMTP matter, as to which address
any status codes and bounced mail would get sent to.
So theoretically, this method should be incapable of working.

Added to this, in my case I'm sending a 550 status code on the
basis of the "from" address before the SMTP dialogue even gets
to the stage of listing the recipients, let alone the message body.

Therefore - if my logic is correct - there should be no danger that
I'm inadvertently bouncing the message to a third party.
And besides, that would be a strange way to present a spam to
the end recipient - as an error message. Not very classy!

However, I'm still concerned that if someone sends me a few hundred
spam attempts in a couple of hours, then there must be some
benefit for them in it.
And that probably means there's some harm in it for me.

Am I right in assuming that the SMTP dialogue results in no communciation
at all from my machine to the "from" address or any other 3rd party
address? Is it all between my machine and the connection initiator?

Just possibly, there could be some MTA software which _does_ get tricked 
into sending its error messages to a 3rd party.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
