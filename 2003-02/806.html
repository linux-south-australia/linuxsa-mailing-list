&gt; Linux is somewhat more convoluted than this but not too far off the mark at
&gt; least with most distros.
&gt; I think KDE has done better than gnome (havent seen the later gnome) in
&gt; packaging a lot of the 'unfriendliness' of linux out of site. Lindows may
&gt; have done similar I dont know about that either.

Im running redhat 8 and gnome, and I found it to be dead simple to
install. Insert the cd, hit next a few times, and your there. I dont
think the issue with useability is here.
 
&gt; IF we could get to a distro which provides a nice neat intuitive (even if
&gt; its MS look and feel) setup without the user knowing about dhcp net masks,
&gt; lpr/cups etc etc then it may be more appealing I suspect Lindows is trying
&gt; to do this by controlling it's distro to a degree and providing a one stop
&gt; shop for upgrading the various packages.

Yup. Redhat and others.
 
&gt; There may also be an argument of too much variety available which just
&gt; confuses people which package do I install WTF is gnome-1-1.2.rpm etc etc
&gt; there is no NICE NEAT why of saying 'GNOME Desk Top Latest'.exe which they
&gt; can get and install. There is a degree of terminology and like most people
&gt; they struggle to understand Windows and will struggle to even comprehend
&gt; any Linux distro.

Well, there are ways. Probably too many different ways. If you just want
security updates, theres apps that install by default to handle that.
(eg redhat network. Im on a 56k modem, and I sat down yesterday and got
serious about the huge upgrades for rh8 (eg KDE core libs and Mozilla as
wel at the smaller ones) and did them in batches of 20 mb. all installed
fine, with no problems. Still havnt rebooted either).
 
I sat my Mum down in front of Redhat 7.3 a few months ago as she needed
to do some word processing. She can use windows fine, uses it at work
etc etc, and she was happily and successfully using abiword for 15
minuites without noticing that it wasnt windows! (till I mentioned it -
then she kinda did a double take at the screen) :) 

I think any usability problems are more with different types of gui
interfaces. The one that pisses me off the most lately that comes to
mind is gtoaster... You right click to get the menu and then the cursor
is over the top option. Release and option 1 is selected. So if you wish
to change the volume label you right click on the name on the root of
the cd tree. The first option is "delete". I think you can see where
this is going. Strobe a click by accident, and bye bye tree of hand
picked mp3s :( To bad if you are used to one click to bring up the menu
and another to pick the option. However, people are working on these
issues, and gnome/kde/redhat and probably many others are all working on
this goal, so I think it will be sorted out in time. There are still cut
n paste issues as well between some apps, and those where you have to
select "cut" from a menu rather than just hi-light and middle click.
Anyway, I dont think usability is holding linux back any more. Just
general mindset and lack of people to turn to for help. Sure we're here,
but would joe user who read about linux in the paper know where to turn?
