&gt; Nah, just drink the Adelaide water and have the best teeth in 
&gt; Australia (I 
&gt; understand that one of the chemicals they use is fluoride 
&gt; *g*).  Worked 
&gt; for me!

Fluoride is used in most places in Australia and the US. Supposedly,
it's to reduce tooth decay. However, it has a variety of less positive
side-effects, that some people claim are the real reasons why our water
has it added -- as in there may be sinister motives behind it...

eg:
----
* 5 recent peer reviewed studies from China have found an association
between elevated fluoride exposure and decreased IQs in children - an
effect that would be expected based on Mullenix's research. (26)
According to a May 2000 review by Greater Boston Physicians for Social
Responsibility:

"Studies in animals and human populations suggest that fluoride
exposure, at levels that are experienced by a significant proportion of
the population whose drinking water is fluoridated, may have adverse
impacts on the developing brain. Though no final conclusions may be
reached from available data, the findings are provocative and of
significant public health concern."
----

from <A HREF="http://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-facts.htm">http://www.fluoridealert.org/fluoride-facts.htm</A> (which may well be
somewhat biased, but hey)...

Anyway, what the hell is the government doing deciding that our teeth
are so important that they need to put toothpaste in the water? Surely
we should keep medication separate from the water supply?

&lt;/OT RANT&gt;
