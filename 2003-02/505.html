Paul Mullins wrote this using a crayon,
I am a AIRNET customer and I am very upset with the quality of the service
lately, my self personal have told about 10 -12 users (now connected)
customers that the service was 1st class, well it was.
I was more than happy saying to people that the service would be the best
and is run by people that 'know some thing' about the internet and
networking. Well at the moment it looks like there is a problem with in the
airnet server farm, tracing there serverhe two differnet dial in numbers
get different results one number a telstra number resolvs back to their
servers with in about 5 hops, and the other number a iprimus number well
about 14 hops all of this is to the same server.
The next thing is their advertising, yes it is a good idea for new
customers yes money is good but when the users to modem ratio goes sky high
well you have to ask what are they doing.
Yes only lately they had installed a large number of dialin lines but my
main complaint is ALL the lines get busy and some times can take up to 45
minutes to connect, this includes using both number trying to hunt down a
line.
Then this 2 hr kick off, well you would not think that  the servers would
be getting taxed that much on a monday morning at 1 pm (when i dialed up)
and exaclty 120 minutes later get kicked off, well my question is what the
$^%^% ( words i dear not say).
Customer support well there is a differnet area they need to pay in, the
people I seam to ge on the other end sound like either one or both trained
monkeys or 14 - 16 year old kids.

This was my 5 cents worth on the subect.

In the begining of the 'net' there was no graphics and boy was it fast

I tryied a modem but it hurt!!!


I was a loyal user but not now this is the last straw !!!
