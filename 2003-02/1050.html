&gt; Sounds very, very familiar :-(

Somewhat familiar here too...

&gt; 
&gt; The education system, /especially/ secondary years, is
&gt; horribly broken. 
&gt;   It seems the students that do well are the ones penalized 
&gt; for doing so.

I wrote a rather long treatise on this topic, and then deleted it
instead of sending it. Anyway, I will attempt to summarise here.

My opinion is that the schooling system (and indeed, society) is more
broken than stated here and in the article itself. The way I see it,
formally, it's set up in part, at least, to distinguish students. It
defines a bunch of functions that a "good student" should be able to do.
Some can do it, and choose not to (freaks, in the article), some can,
and do (nerds, in the article), and still more can't do it, but try, and
then there are the ones who can't do it and don't try. The system that
arises in the schoolyard is the one that ranks people separate of this,
and puts the geeks and nerds at the bottom, and the ones who can't do
it, at the top. I doubt many would argue that schools are not like this.

The most superficial problem is that the education is not tailored to
the individual, so many get left behind. In the above description, only
one group of students is academically successful (nerds).

On a different level, there is a problem in that the ones who can't tend
to harass those who can, thereby dicouraging them, and making highschool
painful.

However, the biggest problem that I see is the definition of the "good
student". This is where we tend to emphasise (IMHO) the "geeky" type
things over human relation type things. ie -- those who can do maths and
physics but yet can't understand people, can't communicate, and can't
influence people are considered "smart", and people who are the opposite
way around are considered "dumb". The thing is that the most important
things in real life, whether you measure it by happiness or by material
success, are usually NOT technical skills. Sure, many people can be
happy just doing their esoteric irrelevant technical things, but they
will never REALLY impact their society, or change anyone's life (apart
from through technological advance, which is a superficial change anyway
-- has the Internet really changed you, or just the way you
communicate?). However, for the most part, whether you look to the
Bushes and Howards (the "Dubyas"), the Gates's and the McNeallys, or
even Kubricks and Finns, big influences don't come from these people's
knowledge of physics.

Think of the most influential and powerful people in your life... What
about the ones that influence and have power over them? As you follow
the chain, you're bound to notice that people get "dumber" yet more
influencial. They can't integrate, they can't partition a disk, and they
have no idea what Avagadro's number is, but they seem to understand
people, and they seem to "do well" in the real world (whether they are
ethical or ruthless in how they go about this is another question).
School doesn't teach us anything about these skills -- we pick them up
ourselves, often in the schoolyard. This is what is wrong in school. It
doesn't pay any attention to the REALLY useful skills.

Well, I failed in summarising, but improved what I had written
previously :)
