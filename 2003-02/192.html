Todd, 
The fact your XP box connects would suggest it is not a problem with the
ISP. Unless they have changed their authentication process and XP is knows
this.

I assume you're using PPPOE, if so which software? 
Which modem are you using?
Is there a log file of your startup?
How is is connected to the PC?

I would suggest you may want to look at your logs and perhaps echo the
script output of adsl start up script.

Regards

Evan

&gt;        Hi,     I&#8217;m not on the list as yet, but am considering
&gt;subscribing.     Yesterday Adam internet had an outage again thanks to
&gt;Telstra, however, when it came back online, for some phantom reason, my
&gt;linux box wouldn&#8217;t connect. I have now installed Redhat 8.0 as it
&gt;needed an update anyway.. and there is still the same problem after running
&gt;adsl-setup     Adam is saying that it is a machine problem and cannot
&gt;support it over the phone, but other people who have looked at the box from
&gt;outside Adam have said it&#8217;s an ISP problem.  I can still connect via
&gt;my XP box.     Is something wrong with my box? Or is Adam trying to cover
&gt;up for a problem by pretending inadequacies?     More importantly, can
&gt;anyone offer a solution of this?     Todd.
