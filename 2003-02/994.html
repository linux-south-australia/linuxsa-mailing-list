Hello Kim,

Kim&gt; Hi guys,

Kim&gt; Do we have any updates on whats happening on Saturday?

Kim&gt; Are we getting any feedback on the "local community input"?

Kim&gt; Is there a big picture for *community* wireless in Adelaide?

Kim&gt; Cheers,

Kim&gt; Kim

Kim, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "whats happening on Saturday"
as the agenda for the day has been published for a number of weeks. We
have however released more details about the events found in recent
news on the Air-Stream website (www.air-stream.org).

May I ask who you mean by "we" getting feedback on local community
input ? Air-Stream represents the entire Adelaide wireless community,
with our goal being to unite all effort into one project to benefit
all users. Decisions regarding the association may be made by members,
but we are here to serve the community and hence always listen to any
input individuals provide. We have been working to provide a structure
for all wireless enthusiasts in Adelaide for almost two years now,
with some approaches being more successful than others. We have come
to a stage where we have evolved from a single segregated wireless
project to a network of wireless access points and now have the
capacity to assist the community become a part of something we have
enjoyed for a long time.

The bigger picture has not changed in those two years -- to create a
community based mesh of access points around the Adelaide metro area
and to one day become part of the national community wireless scheme
by linking with other states.

I hope this answers your questions, but as their meaning was a little
hard to decipher, I gave you a brief rundown anyway.
