You're taking this far too personally.  Nobody is trying to bring you
down; there is no winning nor losing.  And there's no shame in making
a mistake, nor in being corrected.  Some of the best flames I've seen
have been people flaming themselves.


&gt; at least one of strcmp's arguments was a constant string. And randomly,
&gt; parsing the same data each time, it would return NULL.

I'm wondering: do you mean that given "i=strcmp(s1,s2);", i would have
the value NULL (a.k.a. 0), or that after the call either s1 or s2 would
take the value NULL?  If it's the former, well that's not necessarily
surprising; if the latter, and if both s1 and s2 had non null values
prior to calling strcmp, then it's a certainly a problem.


&gt; And Romana, where's your delirious whinging about these 2 old bastards
&gt; picking on a youth?

Ah, the charm of youth.  Express your opinion while you still know
everything.  :)
