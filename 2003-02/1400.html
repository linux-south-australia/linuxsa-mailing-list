&gt; Ok, anyone who thinks that a book is their knowledge of a language is
&gt; obviously a fool. The books are the starting point to start reading real
&gt; code. But I thought that was common knowledge. I lucked out with the ones I
&gt; brought, though I certainly know what you mean... the linux programming in
&gt; 24hrs one doesnt even class as material for my kitty litter tray. Andre
&gt; LaMothes "tips and tricks on the windows game programming guru's" which is
&gt; published by sams is quite good. Though the majority of their books are
&gt; average at best. Anyone who thinks a book is anything but a starting point
&gt; is critically broken. I wont listen to any programmer who wont back
&gt; themselves up with code... I'll read what they code and judge for myself.
&gt; Funny how of all the coders on this list, I'm the only one with code freely
&gt; available, Yet all you closed source programmers are all to happy to slag
&gt; me off with no backup of your skills. Maybe I missed your opensource
&gt; homepage. URL's anyone?
&gt;
&gt; Show me the code.. until you do, well I don't need to say anymore. Chris is
&gt; the only one with any backup, and its not much. Sorry Mr Yeoh I couldn't
&gt; find specifically what you contributed to Samba, though you get the benefit
&gt; of any doubt, that email address is credit enough, though I would like to
&gt; see what your responsible for please.

foclmho...

daniel, i sincerely want to thank you for some of the most entertaining posts 
recently - once i realised noone could possibly take you seriously, your wry 
use of parody and satire, in your acting out the foolish role of a pompous 
arrogant youth, has been absolutely hysterical:)

it has almost made me wish i had the advantage of youth again, so i knew 
everything, and could set myself up as everyone else's judge:)

fantastic stuff. almost swiftian in its witty mockery of smug insufferable 
know it alls such as you portray so well...so over the top as to illustrate 
how foolish such a person is..brilliant:)
