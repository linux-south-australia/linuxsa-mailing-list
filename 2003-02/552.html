A bit like saying, "getting into Woolworths as an occupation."
I suppose you mean, "getting into computing with a focus on linux,"
but even that is vague.  I'd say there are three major branches to
computing as an occupation.  One branch is system management, which
involves looking after the computer, taking regular backups, ensuring
that it gets upgraded as needed, and so on.  Network management is a
specialised sub-branch of system management.  The second major branch is
programming, which includes analysing user needs, designing solutions,
writing the programs, testing, analysing user problems and fixing faults.
The third major branch is Helpdesk, which requires a good problem solving
and communication skills.  Helpdesk needs much the same skills as both
programming and system administration.

What interests you?  (If you say the money I'd say the door is that way,
please leave now.  There's already far too many hopeless people who got
into this industry for the money.  Interest in money is more useful to
managers than technicians.)
