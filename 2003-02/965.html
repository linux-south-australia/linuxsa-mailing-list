&gt;&gt; traffic, they still don't have the keys... However, if they got root,
&gt;&gt; they could modify some code to capture the keys, and then 
&gt;you'd be lost.
&gt;&gt; Not sure there's many ways around that -- except for making people
&gt;&gt; decrypt it themselves with the key...
&gt;
&gt;A one time key system? Wouldn't this full over the "it's too hard for
&gt;users to use" [so the users will find a way to circumvent the system]
&gt;category?

What price security?  What are the implications for you if this data
is compromised?  How much will you have to pay your lawyers to defend
your lack of security awareness (ie: lame stupidity)?

This whole debate has been raging in the health system for as long as
I've worked within it (&gt;3yrs).  Although my primary focus is hospitals
I also support a number of medical practices as well so I've been involved
in these sorts of discussions before.  The whole PKI/encryption/security
discussion is always on the table, and to my mind, no one is any closer
to providing a solution which will satisfy everyone's datasharing
requirements,
(think single client identifiers and access to the same client data by all
parties
state/nationwide).

In the immortal words of I don't know who...."It's too damned difficult"
