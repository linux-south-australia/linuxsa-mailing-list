If you ever wanted anecdotal evidence on whether these new-fangled
Bayesian[1] filters actually work, here's some.

I installed SpamProbe[2] about three days ago (cd
/usr/ports/mail/spamprobe && make install), and fed it a corpus of
about 3000 spam messages, which I was fortunate enough that a collegue
had kept (glad there was a purpose to wasting disk with spam).

Then I let it start looking at my mail. Initially it made many
mistakes, because I hadn't yet told it about what 'good' mail looks
like. Each time it made a mistake, I corrected it.

Spamprobe works by rating the mail based on the current knowledge, and
adding the new information from this email to the good or bad list
based on what it rated it as. So as long as you correct the occasional
mistake, it keeps getting better and better.

I gave it a few linuxsa mails, it only needed a few to be able to get
most of the others right. Words like 'linuxsa' start becoming a strong
positive indication of a non-spam email.

However as soon as the "Commercial: 5-day Rookie's Linux Course"
thread started, spamprobe blew the spam whistle. It's interesting
since, although commerical, the email doesn't really have the tone of
the usual spam one receives. So, good catch.

Anyway, "it's all good" as they say in the classics.
