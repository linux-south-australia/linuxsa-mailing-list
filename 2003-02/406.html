&gt; &gt; How much the charge is I don't know. If you refuse to pay your "water
&gt; &gt; rates" to the water authority on the grounds that you don't use their
&gt; &gt; supply but catch rainwater, they say "no, you still have to pay for
&gt; &gt; the rainwater". It's not as much as for piped water but I have a
&gt; &gt; feeling it's not that much less.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah, now I recall.  Isn't it true that water in England is not metered,
&gt; and you just pay a flat rate?  So that should include the water you
&gt; collect from the roof as well.  I'd guess that the charge applies then
&gt; even if you don't have mains water.

An admirable summary, good sir. Yes, the charge - or a charge - still
applies even if you don't have mains water.

As a general rule (there are some local variations) water meters are
optional, so if you don't use much water it may be worth having one
installed. Most people pay the flat rate, which is cheaper for most
families, as well as being less hassle.

&gt; &gt; Another bit of water weirdness: mixer taps on sinks aren't allowed
&gt; &gt; to have a common spout in which mixing takes place anymore. They
&gt; &gt; look the same, but the spout contains concentric hot and cold ducts,
&gt; &gt; so the hot and cold water are separated right up to the nozzle. The
&gt; &gt; result is that they don't mix, and if you try to wash your hands
&gt; &gt; under such a tap you get chilled and scalded at the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; Right, I recall that.  It seems that this is a remnant of legislation
&gt; which came into effect in the late 18th century, after a particularly
&gt; virulent cholera epedemic.  Apparently the problem was cholera bacilli
&gt; breeding in hot (warm?) water tanks and then finding their way back
&gt; into the cold drinking water.  As a result, the laws were modified to
&gt; ensure no return of warm water to cold, which means that even today
&gt; most British houses have separate hot and cold water taps, and I
&gt; believe there's some issue with pressure pumps as well (water needs to
&gt; be in an unpressurized cistern).  Australia seems to have inherited
&gt; both problems.

That's the principle, yes, although I didn't think it went that far
back since very few houses had plumbing then - is 18th a typo for 19th?

Re cisterns, it used to be the case that the cold tap on the kitchen
sink was fed direct off the mains, while every other cold tap and all
the hot water system were fed from the roof cistern. More recently it
was decided that because you swallow water from the bathroom sink tap
when cleaning your teeth, that too needs to be fed from the mains. For
simplicity, the bath is fed from the mains as well, which causes
problems with shower attachments since the hot water is still
gravity-fed from the roof cistern.

In single-storey flats it is not uncommon to find that since there is
no roof space, the "roof cistern" is installed in a cupboard, along
with the hot water cylinder, just below ceiling level. The result is
that the shower doesn't work due to lack of head on the hot water, and
someone else has to come along and modify the plumbing of a brand new
building by installing a booster pump.

Partly for this reason, electric showers are becoming popular. The DIY
shops are full of them, and they only need one cable and one pipe
connected to make them work. This results in a lot of lethally bodged
installations where the shower is not properly earthed, not on a
dedicated spur and does not have an RCD in circuit. And the housing
which encloses the live parts is never designed with any form of
sealing. I am amazed how few electrocutions seem to be reported.

&gt; Of course, conditions in England are pretty different anyway.  When I
&gt; was at university (Exeter, early 70s), I recall seeing an
&gt; advertisement for central heating with individual temperature controls
&gt; in each room.  "55? (F; 13?C) in the bedroom.  60? (15?) in the lounge
&gt; room; 65? (18?) in the bathroom".

Yeah, cold bedrooms are an English institution. It's not so bad these
days, partly due to houses being better insulated and partly because
people have realised that they don't have to be cold anymore.

English universities seem to have an aversion to keeping their
students warm. The heating in my campus room at York University
consisted of a wooden box enclosing a set of finned hot water pipes
and a fan to circulate air over them. This worked well, but the fan
was on a timer and would only run for 2 hours, so if you went out or
went to sleep the room would rapidly freeze. Needless to say, it
wasn't long before I disconnected the timer.

My room was quite small. Other rooms were larger, some much larger,
but they had the same size heaters. To discourage students from
supplementing them by electrical means, the rooms had only one socket,
a 2-amp round-pin one... into which was plugged a 2-amp round pin plug
which the student had fitted to a fan heater. Of course.
