&gt; cool. i'm interested how you "mesh" is held together, and how it routes
&gt; traffic ...

This is something groups like sydneywireless/awa have spent months 
discussing.

The "mesh" infrastructure is almost nonexistant, therefore its almost 
pointless going into it.  I see it as something to be discussed when 
the infrastructure needs it - this is a community group, with a 
continually developing medium (wireless), so something decided today 
might not be the best option in two to three months.

&gt;&gt; You don't _have_ to do anything you don't want to do. A little reading
&gt;&gt; would show you that Internet access is not available on the mesh due 
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; licensing restrictions, and further it is not the focus for the 
&gt;&gt; creation
&gt;&gt; of this mesh.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, well this is where i have been lead astray. its seemed to be
&gt; that wass the whole point of the group.

It seems that almost everybody new to community wireless groups assumes 
this ;-(

&gt;&gt; We focus to create broadband connectivity between users in
&gt;&gt; the state, whether or not Internet access becomes an option in the
&gt;&gt; future is entirely up to those who wish to _make it happen_
&gt;
&gt; well if the community/airstream/wireless network has value in itself,
&gt; and there is a demand for it, the other networks may well want a peice
&gt; of the action and connect to you...

Possibly.

It requires members for this to happen, though.  What gets me is people 
sit back and point fingers at groups saying "you're not doing much", 
where they are the ones that *should* be helping getting something 
happen ;-)  It's a community effort.

&gt; - do community wireless networks include (for the want of a better 
&gt; word)
&gt;   commercial nodes? or nodes opporated by businesses?

General question.  Depends.  I can see much support if this was 
'allowed' by air-stream - that is, community owned AP's used by 
businesses for their point to point traffic (over a vpn possibly), and 
the equipment is funded by that company.

&gt; - can anyone put up a node and be part of the cloud and route traffic
&gt;   for anyone else?

This is a community project; you definitely seem interested, but why 
the heck don't you want to become a member?  It doesn't seem logical.  
(Then again, I'm not a member either right now &lt;g&gt;).

&gt; - will there wireless roaming for mobile clients?

If the infrastructure is there, I don't see why it wouldn't.

&gt; - will mobile/roaming clients need to be authenticated?

No idea, but I'd imagine for personal VPN's and such, yes.

&gt; - have any of the above questions been pondered by air-stream?

As far as I know, yes.  All these questions you've asked, plus more, 
have been discussed over, and over, and over, and over again.  Believe 
me :-)

&gt; - is there anyone doing online content? any web servers or audio/video
&gt;   streamin?

I have been for ages, but its been with my lone AP in Victor Harbor :-) 
  In Adelaide now, so I hope to get all this happening soon, work 
permitting (ack).

&gt; - has anyone done any GPS mapping to integrate into Nodedb?

Perhaps the nodedb mailing list might be useful?

air-stream != nodedb.
