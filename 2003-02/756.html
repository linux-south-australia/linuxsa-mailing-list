&gt; Commentary: The Greatest Flaw In Linux
&gt; Saturday February 15, 2003 - [ 01:41 PM GMT ]   
&gt; Topic - Advocacy
&gt; 
&gt; - By Patrick 'LinuxAddict' Pauwels -
&gt; The largest flaw with Linux is not in its ease of use or installation.
&gt; There's no crisis with lack of software. The hardware support is solid.
&gt; Actually, I feel Linux is very much ready for the masses. The greatest
&gt; flaw with Linux is that nobody knows what it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting direction to take. Is he right?
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a direction we should be focussing on to gather support from
&gt; within the corporations, schools and organisaions we have to deal with?

i suppose its always hard to make a open, general purpose OS and sell
it to the public. tech oriented folks will find a niche use for it.

other folks want to check their email, surf and play "games",
linux and even bsd do that fine, but it is true that up until
recently the desktops suck... kde is a fine example of catchup
+ tryihng too hard to be userfriendly =( but gnome 2.2 looks nice.
looks like a breeding program of old skool OS/2 and macos x =)

all in good time, can't rush these things ...

cheers,

Kim
