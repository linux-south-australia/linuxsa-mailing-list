Long story short :)

As you may remember, two days ago I asked about wireless pcmcia cards.
There is one small problem with this, the laptop (which is a recent
insurance replacement) doesn't have pcmcia slots :0

So you can imagine how #$$%^ed off I was to finally have this wireless card
and no where to put it!!!

My options here are:
1- Be very angry at the computer shop for getting things wrong and insist
they replace it.
2- Get some kind of adaptor for the cards to make them work through USB.
3- Run around in circles screaming!

Now, I have done 1 and 3. They may end up having to replace it, but if not,
does anyone know of some means/device which will allow me to use the
existing pcmcia cards? Oh and this means must must must work with Linux...
i'm scared to think!!!

Cheers
AG
