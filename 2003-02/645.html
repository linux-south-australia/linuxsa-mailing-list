Hi Luke,
Let us know how it goes -&gt; My problem is I kind of want a Calendering 
solution that's almost an Enterprise kind of thing, but for home use.

I'd ideally like a linux backend that will:
- allow webview
- sync of win32/palm/winCE/nokia phones as clients
- a command line client so I can look at what's going on over ssh
- I don't care what the backend is - if it require sql, ldap whatever.

I haven't found one that does most or all of this and doesn't charge a bomb 
for it.  The sync with varioius clients is very important and would drive me 
to get a new gprs capable phone.

Since I have a permanent ADSL business service at home I want it to work 
everywhere so that I can see what I'm upto without having to consult the 
events manager's diary (eg. my wife).

Is anyone else having issues with support for your own systems at home 
giving you headaches?  My webserver was down for a few hours at 2am recently 
(due to power outage) and I had complaints!!

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a linux based calendar.
&gt; I've used calendar in staroffice a couple of years ago, that was way to top 
&gt; heavy.
&gt; Then I used kOrganizer for a while, that turned out to be user unfriendly, in 
&gt; that it doesn't allow cut and paste or copying of complete weeks, which 
&gt; happens to be what I need.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I created a template in excel, which I used for a while, however, I'd 
&gt; like to have linux based calendar,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; kind regards,
&gt;
