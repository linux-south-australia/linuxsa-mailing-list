&gt; &gt;&gt;I like User Friendly but that doesn't equate to MORON friendly.

&gt; I think KDE has done better than gnome (havent seen the later gnome) in
&gt; packaging a lot of the 'unfriendliness' of linux out of site. Lindows may
&gt; have done similar I dont know about that either.

does "user firendly" == "hide things" ?

does "user firendly" == "remove flexibility" ?

does "user firendly" == "easy games/dvd/music/media machine" ?

remember the money in the windows market is the business desktop. not the home market.

the home market is a small portion of windows sales.

the coorporate server market is a hooj portion of the windows sales,
dollar wise, and where the focus is.

M$ is not afriad of the desktop market being hit any time soon,
its the business/cooporate market server angle that is their main
concern.

there are very few business/userland applications on linux that are
ready for the business/cooporate market. star office included.
microsoft has made sure of that, remember changing the APIs is their
speciality... 

getting the law behind the industry to make ms publish and use a fixed
API will mean the downfall of ms as that opens up competition...
then any os could use that API and compete in the OS market.
ms says that will kill inovation. i believe it will kill the upgrade
cycle. we need to use specific apps A, B and C for windows at my workplace,
but we can no loger get windows 2000 through regular chanels, so
we have to use windows xp. apps A and B dont work well on XP,
why we dont know... so we have to upgrade to the newer versions.
these newer versions dont give us any new features, just XP
compatibility =( at over 10K$AU per seat

only time will tell...


cheers,

Kim
