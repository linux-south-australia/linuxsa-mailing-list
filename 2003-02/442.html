&gt; Similar to my conversations with them at Installfest but things have

this sounds good.

i thought it a shame that the only community wireless projects
wasn't. but if this is changing I am far more interested in
bringing my experience to the group.

&gt; and perhaps they can now see the value in 
&gt; working with my plans.

what did you have in mind? It would be nice to work with other
projects with a common goal =)

&gt; I need both the 'commercial' guys and the 'DIY' guys if this 
&gt; project is to have the impact that is possible. 

I'd be happy to be counted in the DIY/community access end
of the spectrum, and I understand the need for a commercial
angle on the project too...

&gt; AirNet / Internode, where are you?

maybe when the wireless network has enough value in its own right
the commerical guys will want to connect to it from demand =)

cheers,

Kim
