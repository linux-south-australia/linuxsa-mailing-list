We stand on a unique battlefield, unlike that of the days of tape storage. Not only do we have a highly durable medium that can store tonnes of data, but these days we have the data to store on it. Not just GNU either. Free (as in freedom) data is common place too, for example the excellent "Computer Boy", by Cobweb Films (if you haven't seen this spoof on "The Matrix" then search google now), and Courtney Love, as much as I don't like her music, actively encourages distribution of her music via digital formats without paying, she hosts MP3's of her music on her site, as she got screwed over by the very record companies who are claiming thier artists are losing out. As well as the thousands if not millions of bedroom artists who have thier stuff on offer without payment, in the hope of being noticed, through this marvelous American excercise in killing technology (who said research in war devices is bad? it gave us the 'net). Not to mention home videos and photos, now that digital camera's are entering us into a new age of binary storage requirements. Heck, I use CD's to send my resume to companies.
	Now calls for a time when not just us, sitting in our darkly lit rooms researching the esoteric ways of Stallman and co, but everyone, should stand up and keep this tool which our survival is becoming so dependant on, as un-encumbered as possible. Australia is one of the last fronts of this Jihad, this holy war of personal freedom. The average joe is only just starting to see the CD for what it is. They thought it was an inferior replacement of vinyl, the CD is a superior replacement to paper, film and magnetic tape, that is in EVERYONE's hands, and we need to educate them now, because I hardly think our local representitives are going to listen to the intelligent minority over the the bags of money from the record companies. We need to succed where the rest of the world is failing, and be the example to the global community that we so rightly deserve to be ;-)

We need a list of representitives and relevant people's email addresses posted to this mailing list. Heck, when we gonna march on parliment house? 8-)
In the mean time, I'm emailing Alexander Downer and telling all my friends to do so aswell.
