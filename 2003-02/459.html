Umm, yes. The goal is to use the Sustainable Regions funding to cover 
the whole infrastructure, broadcasting, reception, training, 
development, security, internet and any other etceteras that come up. I 
am expecting this would need to be enough to cover the first 3 years of 
operation. 
The intranet - access between client site and the central nodes - would 
be at no cost. The internet would be provided on the basis of the 
resources eg; .edu, .gov, etc sites at no cost. .com sites/ commercial 
sites would cost a reasonably low amount. I envisage a phone-card type 
of identification so people can make a decision on how much surfing the 
net they can afford. Groups and organisations can make decisions on the 
level of support they want to make to this extra access.

As the network would cover two city municipalities in the region there 
might even be opportunities for businesses to set up a private intranet 
between branch offices.

The network would provide/own the servers, the client equipment and the 
client computers. The clients would in general provide their own IT 
support but that could be negotiated with the networks. Perhaps we 
could even set up a Support Team for each central node to help people 
get training and experience in the IT Industry. Mmm...

The project would also have to cover the extra costs of coordination 
from the community houses, at least for the first year.

A real rough estimate puts the costs in the million bracket but until 
sites and infrastructure are discussed we cannot be certain just what 
the final bill will be.

I see a big role for the Linux/OpenSource community to help out and 
also for the Community Wireless advocates to get a role. It should also 
help out the community houses and local sporting and community 
organisations.

A very interesting site, thanks for the link.

This is looking like a fun project but I can't see that it is going to 
help my campaign to not go grey too soon &lt;G&gt;

&gt; It looks like the project has some applaudible goals!
&gt;
One of the biggest goals is to put this motto into practice,
"It's all about communication between people,
 the rest is just technology."


Cheers,  Ian
