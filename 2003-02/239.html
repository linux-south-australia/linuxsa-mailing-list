&gt; I've been gradually implementing a bunch of anti-spam measures,
&gt; the latest of which is some dns rbl's.  Unfortunately it
&gt; appears at least one of bigpond's MTAs is listed on
&gt; spam.dnsrbl.net:
&gt;

&gt; The dnsrbl mob say it's a "known/proven SPAM site".

We're using relays.osirusoft.com on www.auug.org.au, and we've
discovered that it has a large number of false positives, including
things that are just plain wrong.  I suspect you've hit something like
this here, though of course Big Pond Toy does have its share of
spammers.  Many of these lists are far too keen to put a Big Block on
a large server.

&gt; For the moment I have removed spam.dnsrbl.net from the list of rbl's
&gt; to check, but what do other people do about this type of thing?
&gt; Blocking all of bigpond is not really practical (however much I
&gt; might like to).

I don't personally use rbls for exactly this reason.  I've summarized
some of this stuff at <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/lemismail.html.">http://www.lemis.com/lemismail.html.</A>  In
addition to what I describe there, I also use procmail to recognize
faked mail from well-known domains.  Here's an example:

:0 :
* ^Received: .*mail[.a-z0-9]+yahoo.com \[
/var/mail/grog

:0 :
* ^Received: .*mail.yahoo.co.jp (
/var/mail/grog

:0 :
* ^Received: .*in.yahoo.com \[
/var/mail/grog

:0 :
* ^From: .*@yahoo.co
/home/grog/Mail/caughtspam

The first three rules recognize mail which really came from a Yahoo!
mail server and saves it to my mailbox.  The last one rejects any
other messages with an @yahoo sender address: they're obviously
forged.

There's a little problem here; people often set an incorrect From:
&lt;me&gt;@yahoo.com address in order to get a reply there.  That's wrong,
of course: the correct thing to do there is to set the Reply-To:
header.  My rules treat them like spammers too.

In addition, I run spamassassin more or less unchanged.  It doesn't
get too many false positives, but it all goes into the caughtspam file
as well, and from time to time I look in there.
