&gt; &gt; Ok, this is good. There seems to be a lot of folks out there that
&gt; &gt; have been somewhat disenchanted about Air-stream. If this is to
&gt; &gt; change this is good. =)
&gt; 
&gt; Given the nature of community associations, perhaps it would be better
&gt; for those 'disenchanted' to voice their concerns in an effort to have
&gt; them resolved?

others may. im proding with email now...
 
&gt; &gt; Do we get to hear about these on the Open Day?
&gt; 
&gt; Time permitting, there will be plenty of people willing to talk about
&gt; their adventures I'm sure.

cool. i'm interested how you "mesh" is held together, and how it routes
traffic ...

&gt; &gt; So, can I be part of that, even if I don't want to become a member,
&gt; &gt; but participate by building and running a couple of nodes[1]?
&gt; &gt; (Unless there is a good reason to become a member..)
&gt; 
&gt; The reasons why one might become a member are similar to that of any
&gt; community association. That is, the possibility for ANY benefits that
&gt; are available now and in the future will be offered to those people, not
&gt; just any old joe who wants them without showing support for the others
&gt; in the group.

hmmm .. ok.
 
&gt; It should be noted then, that all donations (memberships included) are
&gt; put back into the Association in an effort to help those who are
&gt; dedicated to the creation of this community mesh. This may include
&gt; financial support for an access point in a difficult area, hardware for
&gt; backbone links between community AP's, or promotion of the group in an
&gt; effort to create some community focus and get the idea out there.

ok.
 
&gt; &gt; Ok, but again do I have to become a member, I don't have the need for
&gt; &gt; any Internet access or online gaming servers...
&gt; 
&gt; You don't _have_ to do anything you don't want to do. A little reading
&gt; would show you that Internet access is not available on the mesh due to
&gt; licensing restrictions, and further it is not the focus for the creation
&gt; of this mesh. 

Ok, well this is where i have been lead astray. its seemed to be
that wass the whole point of the group.

&gt; We focus to create broadband connectivity between users in
&gt; the state, whether or not Internet access becomes an option in the
&gt; future is entirely up to those who wish to _make it happen_

well if the community/airstream/wireless network has value in itself,
and there is a demand for it, the other networks may well want a peice
of the action and connect to you...

&gt; &gt; I want to get a couple of nodes up and work with wireless and new
&gt; &gt; routing/networking tech.
&gt; 
&gt; Excellent, we look forward to hearing about how you go.

=)

&gt; &gt; Maybe, but maybe our definitions of "community" differ. Never mind =)
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe you should actually give us your definition?
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I know communities are all about community input. If indeed
&gt; you consider yourself part of this community, is your input not just as
&gt; valid as the next persons?

- do community wireless networks include (for the want of a better word)
  commercial nodes? or nodes opporated by businesses?
- can anyone put up a node and be part of the cloud and route traffic
  for anyone else?  
- will there wireless roaming for mobile clients?
- will mobile/roaming clients need to be authenticated?
- if so where and who by?
- have any of the above questions been pondered by air-stream?
- does anyone care about roaming?
- is anyone playing with dynamic routing?
- is there anyone doing online content? any web servers or audio/video
  streamin?
- has anyone done any GPS mapping to integrate into Nodedb?
- has anyone worked with airshadow for the wireless coverage mapping?
- ... theres a lot more stuff that ive been working on with other
  groups... i just wondered whats going on and where to help out at.


&gt; &gt; Ok, look at it like this, I do not see any benifits in becoming a member
&gt; &gt; of Air-stream at this time. I hope you can understand this. I have
&gt; &gt; talked to other folks in Adelaide, who are in the same boat.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What are the advantages?  Are there legal implications of using
&gt; &gt; wireless?  Are the legal issues regarding internet traffic? 
&gt; 
&gt; Yes there are legal implications, but as mentioned before they are not
&gt; an issue at this stage.

briefly, what are the issues?
and why are they not affectual now? and will be later?

&gt; Perhaps in the future if/when it does become an
&gt; issue, Air-Stream will provide the support needed to give its members
&gt; access to this resource.

ok.

&gt; &gt; I am not trying to be difficult. I just haven't been able to figure out
&gt; &gt; why Air-stream exsists in its current format?  And why it is the main
&gt; &gt; body that manages all the "community" wireless projects?
&gt; 
&gt; You need to attend an Air-Stream open day and get amongst it :)

ok. =)

cheers,

Kim
