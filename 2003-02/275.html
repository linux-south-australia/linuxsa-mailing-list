&gt; Interesting. I thought the argument for unregulated use of this band
&gt; was that there was no point trying to manage its use so that users
&gt; didn't interfere with each other, because it was so full of
&gt; interference anyway, from microwave ovens.

Use of the band is regulated -- the "class license" regulates
output power, modulations, etc.  Device manufacturers need
engineering design records that show the limits are met.

It's just that individual radiocommunications licenses are not
required for use.

To make the system work, class licensed users can't make
interference claims against other class licensed users.

Devices such as microwave ovens aren't huge sources of
interference outside of their immediate vicinity.  As
you'd expect.  Focussed devices, such as those detectors
above automated sliding doors, are more problematical
(there are designs for 10Km 2Mbps links using door
detectors).

Note that there are regions for band allocations, and the
US in is in a differing region than Europe and Australia.
So the FCC decision needs to be repeated a number of times
for useful product to be made (otherwise we end up with global
interoperability issues -- like your Europe/Australia GSM mobile
not working on GSM networks in the USA).
