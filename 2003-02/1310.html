Ian,

&gt; I know that DSL doesn't agree with you or me but my vote is for 
&gt; replying to the list only. I am sick up-to-here of seeing the same 
&gt; message twice or three times. 

Unlike some brain-dead lists which munge the reply-to, this list does not.
This generally means it's reasonably safe to press "reply" and only reply
to the person, or to press "reply all" and to talk to the by-standers as
well. It's only when:

 * the CC is way too big and you accidentally zap another mailing list
   with off topic stuff
   [the best person for getting me on this one is Romana who STILL hasn't 
    worked out how to use BCC]

 * the person you really should reply to is in the CC list, not the "To"
    list

Many people here are using tools to remove duplicate e-mails; I do not
because it suits me so not to do and my e-mail setup at home is slightly
fragile as it is. In LinuxSA we have a choice of who to reply to or not.
You don't particularly want to have a list with the reply-to set
(especially with me around) because people can  by  a c c i d e n t  say
quite personal things to you and quite calmly and credibly avoid taking
responsibility for telling the whole world about them...
