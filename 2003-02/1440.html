In a lot of ways, including continuing to grow as more people join over 
time, rather than relying on a fixed infrastructure. It also makes 
individuals legally responsible for the links rather than presenting 
you as a fat juicy target for litigation the nanosecond someone uses 
your setup to transfer a picture of a naked child.

There isn't anything that point to point can do that mesh can't do. The 
only difference between point to point and mesh is the software driving 
the routers. I'm just suggesting that you look at the additional 
capabilities of mesh and think about how this may help your plans.
