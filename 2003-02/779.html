&gt; &gt;Commentary: The Greatest Flaw In Linux
&gt; &gt;Saturday February 15, 2003 - [ 01:41 PM GMT ]   
&gt; &gt;Topic - Advocacy
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- By Patrick 'LinuxAddict' Pauwels -
&gt; &gt;The largest flaw with Linux is not in its ease of use or 
&gt; installation. 
&gt; &gt;There's no crisis with lack of software. The hardware 
&gt; support is solid. 
&gt; &gt;Actually, I feel Linux is very much ready for the masses. 
&gt; The greatest 
&gt; &gt;flaw with Linux is that nobody knows what it is.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Interesting direction to take. Is he right?

Very interesting, and partially true. I don't know about "largest", but
certainly, it's something that is significant. To be honest, I don't
know the value of ranking flaws. Certainly, there are ease of use issues
for some people also. Not for me, nor for most of this list. But
definitely for some (exhibit A: the quoted email below).

Sure, those people who have the problems are the same people (not
speaking specifically of you, James, so don't take offence) who would be
likely to jump in a manual after only ever driving an auto, and dismiss
it because they can't work this clutch thingy out, but that doesn't mean
there shouldn't be an automatic option.


&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is this a direction we should be focussing on to gather support from 
&gt; &gt;within the corporations, schools and organisaions we have to 
&gt; deal with?

One of them, yes. We need to be able to give people some sort of
universally accepted, non-geeky definition of the whole gamut of
linux-related stuff (open source, etc)... which is tough when MS ha
hijacked the market, and now people don't think about operating systems,
they think in terms of versions of windows/word etc.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Ian
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I disagree with him, and do think it is ease of use.
&gt; 
&gt; The Linux Community has to make ease of use and user 
&gt; friendliness _its 
&gt; top priority_, if it views the statement below as a problem 
&gt; and wants to 
&gt; solve it.

The Linux community is unavoidably amorphous. It has no one set of
priorities and nor can it. It's like an anarchy -- almost by definition,
it has no leaders telling it what to think, just many people advocating
the act of thinking. There are some sections of the community that will
do this, and perhaps you should make it your business to get involved in
these sections -- they may even grow...

&gt; &gt;This is an interesting thread. I have been pondering why SO many

&gt; &gt;problem at work when I advocate investigating Mysql on linux 
&gt; (or even 
&gt; &gt;NT) I get glazed looks. Openoffice gets the same reaction. I 
&gt; have yet 
&gt; &gt;to suggest anything which will light managements eyes up. I 
&gt; tried the 
&gt; &gt;money thing but even still they seem reluctant.

Risk. That's it. Short and simple. The risk is high, and the payoff
uncertain. With MS, the risk is (in most people's minds) low, and the
payoff low but certain. They know what they will get. When talking to
management types, recognise that for the most part, they are
conservative. Give them what they want -- certainty. Make sure that you
make NO hyperbole, back up what you say with studies, perhaps prepare a
5 min presentation or 1 page paper. Make sure it's balanced and looks
it. Don't go into huge depth -- they want the information distilled for
them. But make sure that you quote people who are less obviously biased
than LinuxWorld magazine, or Linus Torvalds :)

Point at examples of companies already doing it. As an EG, the RSPCA in
SA uses Linux almost exclusively. It would appear, from the recent
email, that SYC is Linux in the backend...

&gt; Before I get into this, I should say that once you know how to use a 
&gt; tool in Linux, there is no comparison. I also feel that Linux is a 
&gt; superior operating system, its just been misused enough that 
&gt; it has been 
&gt; tarnished.

In some circles, yes.


&gt; 
&gt; * On Reluctance
&gt; 
&gt; The folks in my office will question weather Linux applications will 
&gt; work properly, based upon experiences that were less than 
&gt; satisfactory, 
&gt; from their point of view.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are a few examples of what took place, and here are some 
&gt; of the themes:
&gt; 
&gt; "The difference between the ordinary and extraordinary is that little 
&gt; extra" and - its got to be colorful, automatic and brainless, 
&gt; or someone 
&gt; will complain.

indeed. this is the case for the masses. Accept it. It is.

&gt; 
&gt; For a business to accept Linux on the desktop, it has to afford a 
&gt; reasonable mix of ease of use, reliability, attractiveness, and cost. 
&gt; Here is a real life example.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When I first brought Red Hat into the office, it was version 7.1 I 
&gt; think. I set up a dual boot system on my machine, and was 
&gt; showing one of 
&gt; the guys that Netscape 4 was running faster than IE, and so he was 
&gt; interested in learning a little more. So I started to show him how to 
&gt; set up IP numbers in Red Hat 7.2 through their wizzard, just when it 
&gt; came out.  
&gt; 
&gt; I will tell you the Internet connection wizzard in Linuxconf 
&gt; was a right 
&gt; pita. It did did not work, so much to the point that it got 
&gt; embarassing. 
&gt;   My companion also pointed out that he thought Gnome looked horrible 
&gt; and saw no reason to endure it, along with the unreliable IP 
&gt; settings. 
&gt; He said to me "it figures, after all its free."  I won't go into that.

yeah, this is annoying. there are two things that people (me inclusive)
tend to do when demoing -- either polish up a demo where they demo
everything that they are 100% confident with, and gloss over the
potential problems, or they try something new for the first time in a
demo, and something doesn't work. Honesty is the best policy. "I don't
know how to do that, but we can give it a go now if you want" is ok, as
long as you're demoing to someone who likes a challenge, and isn't there
for the purposes of criticising. With a critical audience, it's best to
say you'll go find out, go find out, and then show them. In either case,
you have to be honest with yourself and with them. If it's hard or
unintuitive, tell them. If it's simple, but you made a silly booboo and
stuffed it all up, tell them.

&gt; 
&gt; Don't get the idea that I didn't know how to set up IP 
&gt; numbers on a LAN, 
&gt; I did. I just didn't know about /etc/hosts. However and in 
&gt; all honesty, 
&gt; if a piece of software is supposed to configure your IP settings, but 
&gt; the settings no longer work after a reboot, it looks bad. To 

yeah... true... but I guess it depends on the approach one takes. If
you're planning to be the linux guy for the company, then your
proposition looks shakey. If you're planning for the average user to be
able to change their ip settings, then you're asking for trouble. If you
plan to get someone in to do it right (and don't take that as a slur --
this someone could be you if you decided that was going to be your new
calling, and you got it all sorted before trying to implement), and they
lock it all down, and so on, then you need to make that clear, and it's
less likely to be a loss for Linux (it may be a loss for you if you are
wanting to demonstrate your skills ;)


&gt; sum it up, 
&gt; I won't touch Red Hat to this day. And no, I wasn't going to 
&gt; call in a 
&gt; consultant for a configuration with no business purpose at the time.

mmmm.... could probably happen with any distro, depending on the tool...

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, from what little was seen of Linux, Linux did not look very 
&gt; good. Furthermore, people talk, and unfortunately, this stuff happens 
&gt; all the time, and I am fairly certain that its not just in my office.

yah

&gt; 
&gt; Eventually we decided to use Linux for Internet & email, 
&gt; after we found 
&gt; 3,000 copies of a virus sitting on our server that had a 
&gt; random payload 
&gt; of wiping everything off of it. This would have been a 
&gt; disaster, because 
&gt; we were still working on getting a new backup system, the old one had 
&gt; failed us.
&gt; 
&gt; So, when I deployed Linux, I was sure glad that I had tried SuSE, 
&gt; because I knew that the desktop was attractive enough to keep 
&gt; the troops 
&gt; happy, and that the configuration wizzards actually worked. 
&gt; Arguably, it 
&gt; had that little extra, and seemed to appease staff.

so, this is not an ease-of-use problem with Linux, per se... it's a
matter of getting the right tool for the job, and setting it up right.
The thing about Linux, which requires a different mindset to Windows, is
that it varies a lot depending on the distro, the config, and who set it
up and maintains it (which is really the config, but you get my drift).
Windows is predictable. You can set it up badly, averagely, or really
well, but it's always windows, and it's always predictably insecure,
pretty, usable and restrictive.


&gt; 
&gt; * Day to Day
&gt; 
&gt; As time went on, people started having problems with the 
&gt; prefs.js file 
&gt; in Netscape. Their settings kept getting lost. It is a well known 
&gt; problems in the Lindows Forums, although I was using SuSE 8 & 8.1.

Strange... :)

&gt; 
&gt; To make matters worse, fetchmail does some things that that 
&gt; could make 
&gt; Howard Stern blush.  There were many occasions that fetchmail 
&gt; would not 
&gt; start up when the user logged in. I had set fetchmail to execute by 
&gt; using a shell script placed in the .kde/autostart directory. 
&gt; However, if 
&gt; fetchmail had a stale lock file, fetchmail simply wouldn't 
&gt; run. No error 
&gt; messages, I didn't run fetchmail in a terminal. I have no doubt that 
&gt; staff would have complained about the bash shell that 
&gt; appeared on their 
&gt; screen every 30 seconds. The point is, why didn't it just get 
&gt; the mail 
&gt; anyway?Fetchmail has a few other annoying quarks too.

not sure quite what you mean by this problem, but it sounds
interesting... :)

&gt; 
&gt; With staff intermittantly not receiving their emails, I set 
&gt; our server 
&gt; up to check emails as well, but to not delete them. That way I would 
&gt; have a copy on the server in addition to what was being 
&gt; delivered to the 
&gt; desks. If they couldn't find their mail there, at least I had 
&gt; a backup. 
&gt; What I painfully learned was that it will delete emails making 
&gt; assumptions that it shouldn't; the assumption that if the mail for a 
&gt; person has already been checked elsewhere, but the mail was 
&gt; not deleted, 
&gt; it ought to, by default, delete those emails AND NOT DELIVER 
&gt; THEM unless 
&gt; told otherwise. What a stunt! I would stop using fetchmail, 
&gt; but I think 
&gt; the problems have gone away. Furthermore, I don't want to  make a 
&gt; significant time investment to learn another program, that could have 
&gt; its own quarks.

strange...

OK, my advice is you perhaps need to make a decision as to whether you
are going to be the Linux guru or not. Not to say it's all or nothing,
but in some sense, it is ;)... Basically, there is a LOT to learn with
Linux, especially to set it up properly. If you could get someone to be
the guru for you, then you could do things as you see fit, and slowly
gain confidence and skill without risking anything to the company (the
risk is said consultants'). However, I think it's exceptionally
difficult to try to be a sysadmin as well as something else,
particularly when you are also trying to advocate a new system --
remember the risk thing? You need to reduce the risk factor for the
boss, and one way of doing this is to get a decent (trusted and
respected by you _and_ your boss) consultant to be the fall guy... have
him direct things, set them up right to start off with and put you on
the right tracks, and use him (or her) when you are out of your depth.

&gt; 
&gt; * Big Picture
&gt; 
&gt; The fact is, that even without these experiences, other 
&gt; people  have had 
&gt; similar ones, and they will talk to other people, and after a 
&gt; while, the 
&gt; word on the street willl be that Linux has a "steep learning 
&gt; curve." It 
&gt; is unfortunate.

yep, and true, wouldn't you agree... in which case, it's not that bad
that that's what people think -- that whole honesty thing comes in here.
I'd rather someone knew enough to know that it wasn't for them, rather
than being convinced it's for them blind to the potential problems.

Remember though, that the Linux community is diverse, and many are
working on these issues... compare any distro with one from a few
versions back. It's improving rapidly. The bar is lowering, the curve is
flattenning... and yet, the limit remains high. The more people care
about this, and the more get involved in doing something about it, the
better it will get -- and in changing this, it's more important to get
involved than to try to change the amorphous community...

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **
&gt; 
&gt; Why I think this happens
&gt; 
&gt; Two reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The distribution industry as a whole is operating inefficiently by 
&gt; not sharing code.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, the Community, based on necessity alone, shouldn't have 
&gt; developed both the RPM and APT installation systems. Right 
&gt; now there are 
&gt; a lot of them working on the same things. The disappointing 
&gt; fact is that 
&gt; unless coalitions are formed, or mergers are made, this will 
&gt; not change.

Horses for courses. Competition makes the breed stronger. Choose your
pefferred solution (and often, the most valid choice for someone who
doens't want to go full time, is "I'll have what she's having"). If you
think about it, the car industry could be more efficient if we didn't
have this whole Ford/GM thing. Why not get rid of the Ford V8, and just
go with the small block chev? Surely with that merger, it'd be great --
we wouldn't need to worry if this head fits that block ... of course it
would... :) That said, consolidation occurs, and apt and rpm will grow
closer... and then someone will invent the ACME system (or perhaps
portage)... diversity should be protected and encouraged -- it's what
makes things good.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. The distribution industry has a financial motivation to sell 
&gt; consulting services, and that motivates them to not work on 
&gt; ease of use 
&gt; solutions.

yet, there are a bundle of companies going for ease of use (lindows,
lycoris, etc -- even redhat and friends). Compare the latest "easy"
style distro with (say) RedHat 5. It's a different story. progress is
being made there, incentive or not. And besides, consulting services are
only desired (in demand ... ie profitable) if they are providing a
worthwhile service -- adding real value. Ford service centres woulnd't
last if they made money primarily from fixing designed-in faults in
Fords.

&gt; 
&gt; This is what I find ironic. There are plenty of comuter 
&gt; consultants out 
&gt; there that make a fine living supporting Microsoft products that are 
&gt; "dummed down." I am sure that consultants would actually be 
&gt; making more 
&gt; supporting a dummed down version of Linux than they are today.

I'm sure some of them do.

&gt; 
&gt; 3.  The Linux environment changes often enough that the 
&gt; development of 
&gt; certain configuration tools would turn out to be a futile process, 
&gt; because it would have to be changed frequently.

except that the evidence contradicts this. sure, you need to resources
to develop them, and if you did it yourself, you would struggle to keep
up, but that's ok -- companies do this for us.

&gt; 
&gt; For example, the recent change of GCC versions, or device requiring a 
&gt; recompile for each kernel version. Lindows' using a device 
&gt; file system 
&gt; that resets at each reboot, while SuSe's does not. Two packaging 
&gt; systems, etc.

that's (mostly) not changing, it's competition. It's like getting in a
ford and finding the stereo controls on the dash, and then stepping into
a saab, and they're on the steering wheel. The actual big major changes
(like GCC) are things that are settling down. try to find out what sort
of changes were neccessary back in the early days -- as linux matures,
these changes become smaller, and the mechanism for change becomes
simpler as provisions for change are designed in to programs.

&gt; 
&gt; I think that the Community will not change until it feels the pain of 
&gt; its fragmentation.  I also feel that the Haloween Documents 
&gt; are a tool 
&gt; used in M$'s favor, to get he Community to be overconfident 
&gt; and ignore 
&gt; the practical issues that keep Linux off of people's desks.

Parts of the community feel that. Parts don't. If you were (say) a
kernel guru writing vm code, you woudln't care too much about half these
issues -- they either don't affect you, or you are capable of working
around them and they don't bother you. Why spread yourself thin by
worrying about these things... they aren't your bag baby. Others,
equally talented, do care about these things, which is why we see the
progress. Without this diversity, we'd only see progress in one area.

Halloween... maybe you're right, but if you hunt, you'll find a
diversity of opinion on what is good and bad about linux, and ease of
use etc is a big issue for a lot of people, and halloween documents or
none, they are working to improve linux in that way.
