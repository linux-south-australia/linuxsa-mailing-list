Yep, those were the same messages that I got on my Redhat 7.3 box. 

I did try and see if I could connect on the second network card. Reconfigured 
the internet to go though the second NIC using 'adsl-setup'. The linux box 
connected straight away when I typed 'adsl-start'. Armed with the knowledge 
that my box was doing something weird, I started to manually look at the 
config files.

Subject: Information about DSL Problems

&gt; Hi again
&gt; 
&gt; Lets start with a no. 1. I didn't realize I would get as much helpful
&gt; response as I did, so thanks to those for replying with information
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Plain text for the mailing list has now been established.. sorry 
&gt; to those who were affected.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Let's try my question again...
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I'm assuming it's my box being a pain in the ass...
&gt; 
&gt; My link to Adam internet died with the Telstra unscheduled outage
&gt; Tuesday. Upon trying to reconnect my box wouldn't. I connected via 
&gt; my XP box.. so that's all good... but I thought I'd update from 7.3 
&gt; to 8 while I had a good excuse to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway.. it's still doing the same thing...
&gt; 
&gt; Here is all the information I can pull:
&gt; 
&gt; /var/log/messages snippit

&gt; 
&gt; While link is down:
&gt; 
&gt; Note: You have enabled demand-connection; adsl-status may be inaccurate.
&gt; adsl-status: Link is down (can't read pppoe PID file
&gt; /var/run/pppoe-adsl.pid.pppoe)
&gt; (apparently normal because the pid file is only generated after the
&gt; service is activated)
&gt; 
&gt; While link it trying to become active:
&gt; 
&gt; Note: You have enabled demand-connection; adsl-status may be inaccurate.
&gt; adsl-status: Link is attached to ppp0, but ppp0 is down
&gt; 
&gt; Less relevant is the fact that I asked it NOT to connect on demand,
&gt; however it says otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; The error message I get after connection has timed out is:
&gt; 
&gt; /sbin/adsl-start: line 217: 15558 Terminated              $CONNECT "$@"
&gt; &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1
&gt; 
&gt; In the event that it helps, yes I am running this through eth0
&gt; The modem is plugged into the uplink port of the switch and the linux
&gt; box connects through that, and the other computers just hide behind it.
&gt; 
&gt; I did have this running with a 1 network card set-up before. It has been
&gt; suggested to me to use 2. I've decided not to. Personally I think 
&gt; that it made the whole setup easier.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway... again, thanks to those who sent replies, and I hope you 
&gt; can be of more assistance armed with this information.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again
&gt; 
&gt; Todd
