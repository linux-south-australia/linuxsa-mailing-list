I had a great and long-into-the-night chat with Anthony and others while 
at Perth LCA. We had a ball going back into the dark ages of Sinclair's, 
Dick Smith VZ200's, Wombats and Vic 20's, BBS and early internet and 
CompuServe's good old days. Was great to roll over old times like that. 

Anthony also mentioned the problems he has bringing gear into Australia 
and getting stuff made here. He mentioned the great range of T-shirts at 
ThinkGeek and how the tariffs and Import taxes mean he cant buy them for 
anything like we can land them as individuals. He wants to do a whole 
series like them with local manufacture. He showed us one of their Tux 
ties as an example of the good work done by Aussie manufacturers. When I 
mentioned I had been looking at them for a while but had wondered how good 
they were he gave the thing to me! WOW! I am hooked! Now I can be all 
dressed up and still look like a geek! 

Not even my Sun T-shirt can help me do that &lt;G,D&RVF&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
