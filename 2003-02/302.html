On a diet of Guinness and supplements mentioned below, one item
seems to be ommited ... A laaaarge very well fitting cork and a suitable
fear of going out anywhere. :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Although, I've heard that if you are allergic to penicillin,

&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't touch the Sparkling. :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Penicillin hey?! So you could argure that drinking Sparkling is actually
&gt; &gt; good for you.  Although that hasn't been my experience...
&gt;
&gt;New Scientist published a short article about whether or not it was
&gt;possible to live entirely on a diet of beer, following a publicity
&gt;campaign by the Guinness people which satirically drew attention to
&gt;the nutrition you can draw from their product.
&gt;
&gt;On a lark, some academic somewhere performed a chemical analysis
&gt;of Guinness, and determined that it contains lots of protein, fats,
&gt;sugars, and all kinds of other things required for sustaining life.
&gt;It was, however, deficient in Calcium, and contained almost no 
&gt;Vitamin C.
&gt;
&gt;So the researcher concluded that on balance you could receive all 
&gt;the chemical compounds required for life from Guinness if you supplemented
&gt;the diet with some smallish Calcium and Vitamin C sources.  After doing
&gt;the math he decided that you'd need a daily supply of one glass of
&gt;orance juice, three glasses of milk, and 47 pints of Guinness.
