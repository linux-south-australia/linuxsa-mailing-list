&gt; It's a preemptive strike. They're in fashion at the moment.

and the age old problem for any non-trival computing problem;

 "When do you think the SCC will deliver results? 

 That is a tough one to say. We hope in the next few years, but we also
 understand at the same time that this is a very challenging problem.
 Just getting with a group that can help us divide the problem up into
 manageable pieces would be a big help to us. "

good software deisgn is all about cutting the job into managable bits,
that and sensible inferface/API design ... and we all know about
Windoze API "compatibility" issues.

the problem is actually finding a software development company that
actually does good software design.  throwing money and bods at a
problem is the biggest problem with cooporate 'mercan and UK type place
so's i've seen...

cheers,

Kim
