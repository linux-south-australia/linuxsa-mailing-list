&gt;&gt;&gt; cool. i'm interested how you "mesh" is held together, and how it 
&gt;&gt;&gt; routes
&gt;&gt;&gt; traffic ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is something groups like sydneywireless/awa have spent months
&gt;&gt; discussing.
&gt;
&gt; im aware of this. as any other groupd i suppose...
&gt; there has been much politicing, i dipped a toe in some time ago
&gt; and was warned... this is why i am asking questions now. carefully.

Warned?

Depends who you spoke to, I guess, not all the "community" is as 
helpful and as friendly as they perhaps should be...

&gt; i suppose "mesh" could be a bit missleading, but in the longrun,
&gt; its a good name =)

That wasn't my point - my point was that there wasn't a "mesh" at the 
moment to even speak of.

&gt; im not new to wireless, or community wireless, just at the looking
&gt; but not touching stage, here in adelaide.

What previous experience(s) have you had?  Curious, you've mentioned it 
in earlier emails too.

&gt;&gt; General question.  Depends.  I can see much support if this was
&gt;&gt; 'allowed' by air-stream - that is, community owned AP's used by
&gt;&gt; businesses for their point to point traffic (over a vpn possibly), and
&gt;&gt; the equipment is funded by that company.
&gt;
&gt; ok.
&gt;
&gt; this point usually gets me chargrilled with inches of my live for
&gt; proposing it in a "community" group setting. but i had to ask.

Yeah, I know, most people hate the idea.  I think its an ideal way to 
develop the network, even if not ideal (hey, its better then nothing).

&gt; i have been bitten by "incorportate" entities before.
&gt;
&gt; not casting nasturtiums on air-stream.
&gt; but i dont understand why it has to be there...

Why not?  Its a good working body for a wireless group to work under.  
Nobody else seems to have a problem with it...

&gt;&gt; As far as I know, yes.  All these questions you've asked, plus more,
&gt;&gt; have been discussed over, and over, and over, and over again.  Believe
&gt;&gt; me :-)
&gt;
&gt; there is more ...

For sure, but not as much as I'm guessing you think :-)

&gt; true. i have been talking to evelbunny for a long time now,
&gt; there is quite a bit of useful overlap there, and air-stream
&gt; can benifit from nodedb's resources.

air-stream do use nodedb's resources...

&gt; now, nodedb is in a position where it needs tools/utils
&gt; in making it a far more useful resouce... i feel nodedb is part of
&gt; community wireless and needs some help passed their way.
&gt; client software mostly, but you know what i mean...

Not sure what you mean, client software for nodedb?  If you're talking 
kismet style logs being uploaded, eb's against this due to people 
uploading fake logs (which has been a problem with other nodedb-like 
sites).

What kind of help?

R

&gt; cheers,
&gt;
