&gt; &gt;Interesting. I thought the argument for unregulated use of this band
&gt; &gt;was that there was no point trying to manage its use so that users
&gt; &gt;didn't interfere with each other, because it was so full of
&gt; &gt;interference anyway, from microwave ovens.
&gt; 
&gt; Use of the band is regulated -- the "class license" regulates
&gt; output power, modulations, etc.  Device manufacturers need
&gt; engineering design records that show the limits are met.
&gt; 
&gt; It's just that individual radiocommunications licenses are not
&gt; required for use.

Sorry, me being sloppy. That's what I meant: the colloquial sense of
"unregulated".

&gt; To make the system work, class licensed users can't make
&gt; interference claims against other class licensed users.
&gt; 
&gt; Devices such as microwave ovens aren't huge sources of
&gt; interference outside of their immediate vicinity.  As
&gt; you'd expect.

They seem to radiate about as much power as a GSM phone when it is
close to a base station and therefore itself transmitting at a low
power. I'd imagine they could cause problems in a domestic situation.

&gt; Focussed devices, such as those detectors
&gt; above automated sliding doors, are more problematical
&gt; (there are designs for 10Km 2Mbps links using door
&gt; detectors).

That sounds fun. (So does aligning the transmitter and receiver!) Do
you know of any good URLs?

&gt; Note that there are regions for band allocations, and the
&gt; US in is in a differing region than Europe and Australia.
&gt; So the FCC decision needs to be repeated a number of times
&gt; for useful product to be made (otherwise we end up with global
&gt; interoperability issues -- like your Europe/Australia GSM mobile
&gt; not working on GSM networks in the USA).

And the cufuffle in Britain over 3 users fighting for 2 bands -
license-free devices for unlocking your car, radio hams and TETRA; 418
and 433 MHz. Seems the radio hams were the losers, but the car key
things had time to get used to using 418MHz and were suddenly shunted
off to 433MHz. Which was a pain.
