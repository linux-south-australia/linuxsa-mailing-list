Hi Michael  :-)

&gt;It's innovative because Lindows is CHARGING for it. Clearly some people want this
&gt;'convenience', but IMO it would suck if the C&R installs opensource stuff that is
&gt;free with any distro and you have to pay for the privelege. Is that the case?
&gt;

I often think of fairness questions when it comes to Lindows and most 
other distributions for that matter. I know how the GPL reads, but I am 
thinking on a "fairness" level here.

When I think of a business, I think of the costs incurred to produce 
revenue generating goods and services. I think of the importance of 
managing these costs and the importance of making a connection between 
the costs and revenue through budgeting.

Just to isolate the issue, Transmeta pays for Linus' salary, but many 
companies and people reap the benefit from it. On the other hand, how 
much of Linus' benefit Transmeta?  Lets say AMD paid its own "Linus" and 
many other companies and people reaped the benefit from it. On the other 
hand, lets say that the benefit for AMD was questionable.  However, lets 
also assume that AMD benefitted greatly from Linus' work, and Transmeta 
benefitted greatly from AMD's 'Linus.'  Does the fact that both 
companies come out even make it fair, or is it unfair that still other 
companies are not paying for part of the cost as well? What if AMD's 
Linus gets lazy? What could Transmeta do to get AMD's Linus back into shape?

Same questions of fairness goes through my head when it comes to 
Lindows. They are leveraging something that they partially paid for, yet 
have not gained a marketing advantage by developing wine. (Assuming that 
they invested a large amount of money into it.)

I don't know how to answer these questions, but I sure think about them.
