&gt; You're taking this far too personally.  Nobody is trying to bring you
&gt; down; there is no winning nor losing.  And there's no shame in making
&gt; a mistake, nor in being corrected.  Some of the best flames I've seen
&gt; have been people flaming themselves.

Yup, I do that a lot. Though I did get a bit more carried away than usual there. Sorry to all those who'll still read what I write.

&gt; Ah, the charm of youth.  Express your opinion while you still know
&gt; everything.  :)

It's part of my strategy. Oh and the fact I genuinely am a cunt, don't get me wrong. My theory is the world is full of idiots. This is based on 21 years of experience. If I behave like the utter prick I am, then all the idiots usually go away, or at least leave me alone. All the smart people (both of them) see that while I am a right bastard, I have a point or two. So I'm left a scenario where the only people who will talk to me, are the only one's I want to listen to. The smart people will hate me for a while, but when I cool down, they reasonably quickly notice I'm not always a total wanker, just most of the time. In short, "flame is the best way to get rid of dead wood". Also I'll be dead in 20 years, so I don't want to waste my limited time with the stupid.

Lastly, I should define my opinion of what stupid is. In my book, you are stupid, IF you have ever used the phrase "Don't make me think", unless it's to state how much you despise that phrase.
