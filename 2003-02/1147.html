&gt;&gt; "tr -d \\015" does this well.

&gt; I'm not familiar with translate's syntax, but that should be 14 unless
&gt; tr is totally loopy and starts counting at 1 instead of 0.

Well, no, that's octal.  CR = 13 decimal = 0D hexadecimal = 15 octal.
I used octal because a lot of non-GNU tr's don't recognise hexadecimal
or '\n' notation.

&gt; I thought the filtering was the other way around, and therefore
&gt; more likely to be executed on DOS, where filters are not an
&gt; option. My version will run on both platforms.

Most DOS' support the concept of stdin and stdout.  I've certainly
used it under DOS with both C and Java programs.

&gt;&gt;     int  ch;

&gt; Using ints to store chars is naughty.

Using a char to store the result of fgetc(), which returns an int, is even
naughtier.  I'm sure this is a C FAQ (it's certainly a C common error).
See below.

&gt;&gt;     while (ch = fgetc(stdin), ch != EOF) {

&gt; Checking for successful assignment is bad, you actually mean to check
&gt; success of fgetc()

Erm, I'm not sure if I've read what you wrote correctly.  Bear in mind
that I didn't have an issue with this, and what I've coded above is my
own personal idiom (I always try to separate assignments from tests,
even within looping constructs).

Semantically, "(ch = fgetc(stdin), ch != EOF)" is the same as
"((ch = fgetc(stdin)) != EOF)".  They will even typically output the
same byte codes (I have checked this on the compilers I used to
use when I used to care about such things).  In the second
construct, the side effect of (ch = fgetc(stdin)) is the value
assigned to ch.  I've just split it up into an assignment, test
sequence.  It is certainly *not* checking for "successful
assignment"; the value returned by fgetc() is assigned to ch
regardless.  It *is* checking that ch hasn't been assigned EOF
(which is -1, but that's an implementation detail we're not
supposed to know about).  However, if we've used a signed
character, then we most certainly will care, because 0xff will
be downcast to a -1, and neither of the above tests will work
correctly for character files with 0xff in the stream.  Alternatively,
if I'd used an unsigned char, then we will never be able to test
the -1/EOF returned by fgetc(), and the loop will never
terminate.  Using a char of any sort to store the result of
fgetc(), then test against, is wrong.

&gt;&gt;             if (fputc(ch, stdout) == EOF) {
&gt;&gt;                  perror("write");
&gt;&gt;                  exit(1);

&gt; exit() is bad karma..

As an exception mechanism, no it isn't.  It's bad karma
inside libraries (where the user of the library should be
offered the chance to terminate a program, not a library
function), and for similar reasons that applies to lower
level functions.  As this is the topmost function, it doesn't
apply.

&gt; its unstable on at least one platform (though I forget
&gt; which)

Non-ANSI compliance isn't a reason to not use a
standard feature of a language.  And most compilers
actually push the exit() function onto the stack as the
epilogue to main (i.e. when main has finished executing,
the return code from main is passed to exit or _exit,
I forget which).

&gt; a reason and bad practice.

Given that C doesn't have great exception handling
facilities, no it isn't.  I'd use setjmp/longjmp under
similar circumstances for anything "deeper".

&gt; Commenting self explanatory programs is VERY evil. 

"Self explanatory" is in the eye of the beholder.  I've
seen self explanatory programs that have had bugs
in them - are those bugs in there by design, or by
accident?  With no other supporting documentation,
I couldn't tell.

&gt; int *argv[] and int argv[][] are synonyms for each other.

I didn't say otherwise.  Incidently, I have seen one case where
char * and char[] weren't interchangeable (i.e. char[] = "foo",
then passed to function as char * which fouled up by pointing
to the wrong segment), but that was compiler spackness from
a major vendor.

&gt; stdio.h is included by default in %95 of compilers.

A lot of compilers do things that aren't in The Standard.
"//" as a comment isn't supported in ANSI C (yet - I
believe there's moves afoot to include it), yet that doesn't
stop a lot of programmers using it, then wondering why
they get compiler errors on other platforms.  I tend to
avoid all that grief up front.

  Daryl Tester
