&gt; &gt;cool. i'm interested how you "mesh" is held together, and how it routes
&gt; &gt;traffic ...
&gt; 
&gt; This is something groups like sydneywireless/awa have spent months 
&gt; discussing.

im aware of this. as any other groupd i suppose...
there has been much politicing, i dipped a toe in some time ago
and was warned... this is why i am asking questions now. carefully.
 
&gt; The "mesh" infrastructure is almost nonexistant, therefore its almost 
&gt; pointless going into it.  I see it as something to be discussed when 
&gt; the infrastructure needs it - this is a community group, with a 
&gt; continually developing medium (wireless), so something decided today 
&gt; might not be the best option in two to three months.

i suppose "mesh" could be a bit missleading, but in the longrun,
its a good name =)

&gt; &gt;&gt;You don't _have_ to do anything you don't want to do. A little
&gt; &gt;&gt;reading would show you that Internet access is not available on the
&gt; &gt;&gt;mesh due to licensing restrictions, and further it is not the focus
&gt; &gt;&gt;for the creation of this mesh.

&gt; &gt;Ok, well this is where i have been lead astray. its seemed to be
&gt; &gt;that wass the whole point of the group.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that almost everybody new to community wireless groups assumes 
&gt; this ;-(

im not new to wireless, or community wireless, just at the looking
but not touching stage, here in adelaide.
 
&gt; &gt;&gt;We focus to create broadband connectivity between users in
&gt; &gt;&gt;the state, whether or not Internet access becomes an option in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;future is entirely up to those who wish to _make it happen_
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;well if the community/airstream/wireless network has value in itself,
&gt; &gt;and there is a demand for it, the other networks may well want a peice
&gt; &gt;of the action and connect to you...
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly.
&gt; 
&gt; It requires members for this to happen, though.  What gets me is people 
&gt; sit back and point fingers at groups saying "you're not doing much", 
&gt; where they are the ones that *should* be helping getting something 
&gt; happen ;-)  It's a community effort.

i am fully aware. like i said before, i wash brushed aside...
now i am asking more questions...

&gt; &gt;- do community wireless networks include (for the want of a better 
&gt; &gt;word)
&gt; &gt;  commercial nodes? or nodes opporated by businesses?
&gt; 
&gt; General question.  Depends.  I can see much support if this was 
&gt; 'allowed' by air-stream - that is, community owned AP's used by 
&gt; businesses for their point to point traffic (over a vpn possibly), and 
&gt; the equipment is funded by that company.

ok.

this point usually gets me chargrilled with inches of my live for
proposing it in a "community" group setting. but i had to ask.

&gt; &gt;- can anyone put up a node and be part of the cloud and route traffic
&gt; &gt;  for anyone else?
&gt; 
&gt; This is a community project; you definitely seem interested, but why 
&gt; the heck don't you want to become a member?  It doesn't seem logical.  
&gt; (Then again, I'm not a member either right now &lt;g&gt;).

i have been bitten by "incorportate" entities before.

not casting nasturtiums on air-stream.
but i dont understand why it has to be there...

&gt; &gt;- will there wireless roaming for mobile clients?
&gt; 
&gt; If the infrastructure is there, I don't see why it wouldn't.

ok.

&gt; &gt;- will mobile/roaming clients need to be authenticated?
&gt; 
&gt; No idea, but I'd imagine for personal VPN's and such, yes.

ok.

&gt; &gt;- have any of the above questions been pondered by air-stream?
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I know, yes.  All these questions you've asked, plus more, 
&gt; have been discussed over, and over, and over, and over again.  Believe 
&gt; me :-)

there is more ...

&gt; &gt;- is there anyone doing online content? any web servers or audio/video
&gt; &gt;  streamin?
&gt; 
&gt; I have been for ages, but its been with my lone AP in Victor Harbor :-) 
&gt;  In Adelaide now, so I hope to get all this happening soon, work 
&gt; permitting (ack).

but i didn't want to have to pay for access to content.
nor do i need internet access, which is why i was wary.
im sure you can understand, i want to put my kit on the roof and
hack with routing ...

&gt; &gt;- has anyone done any GPS mapping to integrate into Nodedb?
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the nodedb mailing list might be useful?

im on it. have been for some time.

&gt; air-stream != nodedb.

true. i have been talking to evelbunny for a long time now,
there is quite a bit of useful overlap there, and air-stream
can benifit from nodedb's resources.

now, nodedb is in a position where it needs tools/utils
in making it a far more useful resouce... i feel nodedb is part of
community wireless and needs some help passed their way.
client software mostly, but you know what i mean...

cheers,

Kim
