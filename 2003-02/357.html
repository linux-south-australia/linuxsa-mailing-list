You can get rid of that with a filter.  See
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/water.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/water.html</A> for that and other gory details.

&gt; Personally I prefer rainwater but would still like to fire up our
&gt; bore sometime (it has a very old pommy diesel motor which hasn't
&gt; been started in more than 7 years).

Depending on where you live, you could have some very saline water,
which would probably have eaten away the pipe to the bore.  But it
could be a good experiment.

We give bore water to our horses, of course.  They love it.  It also
saves on salt blocks.  Recently we had a guest horse here, and when he
left again, he refused to drink the water he was given until he was
half dehydrated.  I think it was rain water, but it could have been
mains water, in which case I wouldn't blame him.
