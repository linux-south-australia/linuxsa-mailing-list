Out of curiosity I conducted a test with the default win2k drivers and the 
alsa v0.9 drivers (the ver that comes with mandrake 9.0), and I honestly 
could not tell the difference. I played the same song at approximately the 
same volume under both systems, and I couldn't tell. I might get my friend 
who claims to have very good hearing to come have a listen...

The sound card I have is SB Live value, and it is connected to a logitech 
Z560. There are no tweaters on the Z560 so I guess high frequencies wouldnt 
be very hi-fi, but it has a 188W RMS subwoofer and the bass comes through 
beatifully under both systems... I must admit, the ALSA drivers sound better 
than the OSS ones. I may have to try the official live drivers (from the live 
cd) under 2k and see if there is a difference.

&gt; Heya,
&gt;
&gt; I posted a few weeks ago complaining about the quality of my sb live card
&gt; (emu10k1) in Linux compared to Windows.
&gt;
&gt; I've just installed alsa 0.9rc6 on my debian installation, and it appears
&gt; to be running fine - only problem is that it doesn't seem to sound much
&gt; different.
&gt;
&gt; High pitched noises hiss, low end bass sounds dodge.  I've tried
&gt; playing around with various volumes (main volume, pcm, wave), the pitch
&gt; controls, disabling the EQ in XMMS (I've tried both the OSS, ESD and ALSA
&gt; output plugins) and I just can't get it sounding as great as it does on
&gt; Windows.
&gt;
&gt; Don't get me wrong, the sound's acceptable, its just nowhere as near as
&gt; clear, and the bass/treble is nowhere as near as defined as it is using the
&gt; latest Creative drivers under XP.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody here got any clues?
&gt;
&gt; I think I'll stick with ALSA in any case though - 0.9's far improved over
&gt; 0.5, the mixer is crazy, check this screenshot:
