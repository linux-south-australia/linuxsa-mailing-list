Hi All..

This has only happened once to me and the system still booted OK, but the
system is a server and it's bugging me that I cannot work out why this
appeared in my log file.

The story is thus..  the system in question is a Redhat 7.2 Server running 2
mirrored IDE hard using Linux software RAID and ext3 on kernel
2.4.18-24.7.xcustom.  Frustratingly, the current series of Redhat Kernel's
have a bug in the RAID code (bug in file md.c, line 2341) that prevents the
"raidhotremove" command from working (this is another issue).  A bugzilla
report is open on this but nothing thus far has been done.  Anyway I
digress.

In order to "force" my mirrored drives to re-sync, I started the system with
the first IDE drive only.  During bootup, the following message was logged:

Feb 15 15:32:04 alpha init: can't open /dev/console &lt;30&gt;Feb 15 15:32:04
init: can't open /dev/console

However the system started up fine, and I didn't even know about the above
error until logwatch ran overnight.  Of course RAID complained about the
missing drive and continued in degraded mode but apart from that everything
was normal.

I did some real hunting around on the web this morning to try and determine
why this occurred.  I have run the system on one drive before when one of my
drives failed and it never logged this error then.  Anyway I re-instated the
second drive and RAID reconstruction took place on the follow bootup, which
is exactly what I wanted.  This time around, instead of the above message, I
got what I expect on normal system startup:

Feb 15 15:34:51 alpha init: Entering runlevel: 3

This message was absent the first time round and instead I received the
/dev/console error in it's place.  On subsequent reboots of the system
yesterday,  the original error never reappeared. I checked back through my
log archives and I have never had this error logged before.  It only
appeared this once.

All of the instances I found relating to this error on the net were systems
which would not start up to a login prompt.  My system booted fine and
indeed all runlevel 3 daemons started OK despite the alarming message from
init in the log.  Now of course it didn't appear to cause any problems and
the error has never re-appeared, but I just wondered if anybody could point
me in the right direction as to why this came up just this once (and should
I be worried?).  Perhaps it was related to the second drive being absent,
but I'm loathed to take the system down again to see if the problem
re-appears (and it takes 60 minutes for the drives to re-sync which isn't
the best when the server is live) :)

Any ideas would be most appreciated.

Cheers,
Graham
