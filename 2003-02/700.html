Hi Ryan..

&gt; Anybody else had similar experiences, and knows why?   The customers
&gt; are on different ISP's, some on Airnet, some on Bigpond, and some on
&gt; Internode, and they all had the problem at the same time.
&gt; Interestingly enough the one single client I had roaming penguin on
&gt; originally hasn't had any issues.

I did hear of a problem developing during the recent authentication problems
with ADSL in relation to Telstra's DOS prevention on their concentrators.
Apparently if repeated attempts to establish a PPPoE session were received,
it would lock out the source MAC address of the client machine, preventing
further session establishment attempts for XX hours.  Many found that by
changing the MAC address of their adapter solved the problem.  Perhaps this
may have been the cause of your troubles??
