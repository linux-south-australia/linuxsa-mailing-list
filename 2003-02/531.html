 I have said that several times before. The wireless network
 allows us to deliver the community services in an innovative
 manner that simply has not been available before to
 community providers/recipients.

 The project allows us to be an umbrella that can attract and
 enhance any number of other smaller projects and link them
 together in ways that have never been available. Some of
 these ways include an online tutorial 'room' where a person
 with specialised knowledge can assist a widespread group
 across the region. So long as they are not using any
 external backbone the cost to run such a link-up is
 negligible. We could hook up an umpiring panel for a sport
 and the participants can remain in their own clubrooms and
 still freely contribute without time-consuming travel. We
 could provide access to online courses where a small group
 could be attached to a school at the other end of the region
 and perhaps only meet in real space once a week with their
 tutor. We could have shopfront e-classrooms where a
 generalist teacher supervises classes of students studying a
 range of topics.

 There is huge potential for using the network to change the
 face of how services are delivered across the Northern
 region (City of Playford/City of Salisbury).

 Is this a community wireless network? Technically yes. Will
 it be run and managed by community organisations? Yes. Will
 anybody in the community be able to participate? At this
 stage yes but only from attending client premises, sporting
 clubs, community houses etc. Later I would hope to be able
 to allow mobile access to anybody passing through so that it
 can become a full wireless network as you are thinking of.
 That still needs to be worked out but is a goal. Private
 houses are another option but the costs of providing the
 service to them limit the possibility to those that can
 afford the equipment unless other sponsorship opportunities
 appear.

 My goal clients include supported housing for those with
 disabilities, aged-persons homes, community centres,
 sporting facilities, kindies, community support agencies and
 other places within a community where people can freely
 gather to make best use of the services offered.

 I can also see a big asset with the present mobile services
 such as the mobile Library and the youth service caravans.
 Wind up a mast and they are online.

 Technical considerations are leading us to a network with 8
 (or so) distribution points connected by a backbone LOS
 (beam ?)link. Each distribution point will then use an omni
 antenna to distribute and receive signals to the client
 premises clustered in that general area - 3km or so LOS
 (trees permitting). Each client cluster will be able to
 communicate with each other through the server and to other
 servers through the backbone link.

 Doable? Yes.
 What equipment do we use for them? Dunno. Tell me  :-)

 Cheers,  Ian
