&gt;&gt;&gt; The Linux Community has to make ease of use and user friendliness _its

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I like User Friendly but that doesn't equate to MORON friendly.

I agree - but I think there are hints of ideas emerging which makes windows
what it is.
For instance the default win?? install pretty much gets you going off the
bat in regards to the basic system surfing etc
Linux is somewhat more convoluted than this but not too far off the mark at
least with most distros.
I think KDE has done better than gnome (havent seen the later gnome) in
packaging a lot of the 'unfriendliness' of linux out of site. Lindows may
have done similar I dont know about that either.

IF we could get to a distro which provides a nice neat intuitive (even if
its MS look and feel) setup without the user knowing about dhcp net masks,
lpr/cups etc etc then it may be more appealing I suspect Lindows is trying
to do this by controlling it's distro to a degree and providing a one stop
shop for upgrading the various packages.

There may also be an argument of too much variety available which just
confuses people which package do I install WTF is gnome-1-1.2.rpm etc etc
there is no NICE NEAT why of saying 'GNOME Desk Top Latest'.exe which they
can get and install. There is a degree of terminology and like most people
they struggle to understand Windows and will struggle to even comprehend
any Linux distro.

&gt;There is a definite difference.  I've found myself wishing that Windows XP
&gt;had an "I'm not a complete fscking idiot" option numerous times, so that in
&gt;one step I could turn off all the "protective" features what won't show me
&gt;what's in my root, program files, and windows directories, and all that
&gt;other windows crap.  Windows, in its effort to be user friendly, generally
&gt;gives you a "friendly" error message, rather than a decent error message
&gt;which would actually hint at the problem so you can solve it.  Windows is
&gt;pretty much moron friendly, but its definitely not sysadmin (or even
&gt;knowledgeable user) friendly!
&gt;
&gt;Linux on the other hand has good sysadmin tools, but lacks the general user
&gt;friendliness in places.  There is a balance point somewhere between where
&gt;Linux is now, and what Windows XP provides.  I think its that balance point
&gt;that Linux needs to aim for, not total "moron friendliness".
&gt;
&gt;Jim.
