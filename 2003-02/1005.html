&gt; Ok, this is good. There seems to be a lot of folks out there that
&gt; have been somewhat disenchanted about Air-stream. If this is to
&gt; change this is good. =)

Given the nature of community associations, perhaps it would be better
for those 'disenchanted' to voice their concerns in an effort to have
them resolved?

&gt; Do we get to hear about these on the Open Day?

Time permitting, there will be plenty of people willing to talk about
their adventures I'm sure.

&gt; &gt; We have come to a stage where we have evolved from a single segregated
&gt; &gt; wireless project to a network of wireless access points and now have
&gt; &gt; the capacity to assist the community become a part of something we
&gt; &gt; have enjoyed for a long time.
&gt;  
&gt; So, can I be part of that, even if I don't want to become a member,
&gt; but participate by building and running a couple of nodes[1]?
&gt; (Unless there is a good reason to become a member..)

The reasons why one might become a member are similar to that of any
community association. That is, the possibility for ANY benefits that
are available now and in the future will be offered to those people, not
just any old joe who wants them without showing support for the others
in the group.

It should be noted then, that all donations (memberships included) are
put back into the Association in an effort to help those who are
dedicated to the creation of this community mesh. This may include
financial support for an access point in a difficult area, hardware for
backbone links between community AP's, or promotion of the group in an
effort to create some community focus and get the idea out there.

&gt; Ok, but again do I have to become a member, I don't have the need for
&gt; any Internet access or online gaming servers...

You don't _have_ to do anything you don't want to do. A little reading
would show you that Internet access is not available on the mesh due to
licensing restrictions, and further it is not the focus for the creation
of this mesh. We focus to create broadband connectivity between users in
the state, whether or not Internet access becomes an option in the
future is entirely up to those who wish to _make it happen_

&gt; I want to get a couple of nodes up and work with wireless and new
&gt; routing/networking tech.

Excellent, we look forward to hearing about how you go.

&gt; Maybe, but maybe our definitions of "community" differ. Never mind =)

Maybe you should actually give us your definition?

As far as I know communities are all about community input. If indeed
you consider yourself part of this community, is your input not just as
valid as the next persons?

&gt; Ok, look at it like this, I do not see any benifits in becoming a member
&gt; of Air-stream at this time. I hope you can understand this. I have
&gt; talked to other folks in Adelaide, who are in the same boat.

&gt; What are the advantages?  Are there legal implications of using
&gt; wireless?  Are the legal issues regarding internet traffic? 

Yes there are legal implications, but as mentioned before they are not
an issue at this stage. Perhaps in the future if/when it does become an
issue, Air-Stream will provide the support needed to give its members
access to this resource.
 
&gt; I am not trying to be difficult. I just haven't been able to figure out
&gt; why Air-stream exsists in its current format?  And why it is the main
&gt; body that manages all the "community" wireless projects?

You need to attend an Air-Stream open day and get amongst it :)

&gt; Jokingly; Does one have to be a Prince Alfred College old scholar? ;)

Surely you jest ;)
