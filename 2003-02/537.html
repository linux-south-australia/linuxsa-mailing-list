I have been pitching this idea since 2000 and most of the right people have 
heard about it and support it. Now that we are into the definition and detail 
mode and now that we have the opportunity of community groups with 
demonstrated expertise (which we didn't have in 2000) then I can pitch to the 
list to see what information and support is available.

The network cannot just "appear". It has to be set up with support and 
approval of the authorities, property owners and stakeholders and will take 
much more than just a community group of wireless hobbyists to make happen.

Cheers,  Ian
