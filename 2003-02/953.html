&gt; &gt; Why is the "time"  output different  even though  we are
&gt; &gt; running same client/server application and sending same 
&gt; &gt; amount of  data same  number of times.
&gt; &gt; is there a bug in time command?
&gt; 
&gt; remember the PC clock is only good for 1/60 of a second
&gt; accuracy ... dedicated hardware is good for 1000 of a
&gt; sencond, but im not willing to fork out ~250AUD for one...
&gt; 
&gt; as others have said, if you want to see how long it takes
&gt; to send the packets you are better of measuring the time
&gt; taken over a much larger sample in you code than with time(1)
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; When you say  much larger sample in  code , do  you mean
&gt; the data size should be greater  than 2k (say 10k) , or
&gt; the number of  iteration  should be greater than 1000(like
&gt; 10000  or more time) ?

normally when you out to get better "power" in an experiement,
you add redundancy and you increase the sample size.

(where packet size = data payload, not mtu)
so, you might for your example, use different packet sizes,
1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16, etc and you increase the number of packets
you send, do a batch of 1000. then a batch of 10000, etc
use system clock in your code to calculate sending each packet,
then clock it for sending 10 packets, if theres a difference...

what is usually more useful in an ethernet environment is
mixing up the packet sizes ... take your packet sizes them
batch 10000 packets but randomise the size of packet to
give you a more realistic behaviour of the traffic on
an ethernet segment.

i have done some work on this before, simulating an ethernet
segment (as in 10base2), collsion manglement and all ...

simulations don't quite behave as you always expect =/

but then again live t3estng on an ethernet doesnt behave
as you'd expect either =)

cheers,

Kim
