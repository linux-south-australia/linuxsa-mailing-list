&gt;Commentary: The Greatest Flaw In Linux
&gt;Saturday February 15, 2003 - [ 01:41 PM GMT ]   
&gt;Topic - Advocacy
&gt;
&gt;- By Patrick 'LinuxAddict' Pauwels -
&gt;The largest flaw with Linux is not in its ease of use or installation.
&gt;There's no crisis with lack of software. The hardware support is solid.
&gt;Actually, I feel Linux is very much ready for the masses. The greatest
&gt;flaw with Linux is that nobody knows what it is.
&gt;
&gt;Interesting direction to take. Is he right?
&gt;
&gt;Is this a direction we should be focussing on to gather support from
&gt;within the corporations, schools and organisaions we have to deal with?
&gt;
&gt;Ian
&gt;
I disagree with him, and do think it is ease of use.

The Linux Community has to make ease of use and user friendliness _its 
top priority_, if it views the statement below as a problem and wants to 
solve it.

&gt;This is an interesting thread. I have been pondering why SO many corporate

&gt;Openoffice gets the same reaction. I have yet to suggest anything which
&gt;will light managements eyes up. I tried the money thing but even still they
&gt;seem reluctant.
&gt;  
&gt;
Before I get into this, I should say that once you know how to use a 
tool in Linux, there is no comparison. I also feel that Linux is a 
superior operating system, its just been misused enough that it has been 
tarnished.

* On Reluctance

The folks in my office will question weather Linux applications will 
work properly, based upon experiences that were less than satisfactory, 
from their point of view.

Here are a few examples of what took place, and here are some of the themes:

"The difference between the ordinary and extraordinary is that little 
extra" and - its got to be colorful, automatic and brainless, or someone 
will complain.

For a business to accept Linux on the desktop, it has to afford a 
reasonable mix of ease of use, reliability, attractiveness, and cost. 
Here is a real life example.


When I first brought Red Hat into the office, it was version 7.1 I 
think. I set up a dual boot system on my machine, and was showing one of 
the guys that Netscape 4 was running faster than IE, and so he was 
interested in learning a little more. So I started to show him how to 
set up IP numbers in Red Hat 7.2 through their wizzard, just when it 
came out.  

I will tell you the Internet connection wizzard in Linuxconf was a right 
pita. It did did not work, so much to the point that it got embarassing. 
  My companion also pointed out that he thought Gnome looked horrible 
and saw no reason to endure it, along with the unreliable IP settings. 
He said to me "it figures, after all its free."  I won't go into that.

Don't get the idea that I didn't know how to set up IP numbers on a LAN, 
I did. I just didn't know about /etc/hosts. However and in all honesty, 
if a piece of software is supposed to configure your IP settings, but 
the settings no longer work after a reboot, it looks bad. To sum it up, 
I won't touch Red Hat to this day. And no, I wasn't going to call in a 
consultant for a configuration with no business purpose at the time.

Anyway, from what little was seen of Linux, Linux did not look very 
good. Furthermore, people talk, and unfortunately, this stuff happens 
all the time, and I am fairly certain that its not just in my office.

Eventually we decided to use Linux for Internet & email, after we found 
3,000 copies of a virus sitting on our server that had a random payload 
of wiping everything off of it. This would have been a disaster, because 
we were still working on getting a new backup system, the old one had 
failed us.

So, when I deployed Linux, I was sure glad that I had tried SuSE, 
because I knew that the desktop was attractive enough to keep the troops 
happy, and that the configuration wizzards actually worked. Arguably, it 
had that little extra, and seemed to appease staff.

* Day to Day

As time went on, people started having problems with the prefs.js file 
in Netscape. Their settings kept getting lost. It is a well known 
problems in the Lindows Forums, although I was using SuSE 8 & 8.1.

To make matters worse, fetchmail does some things that that could make 
Howard Stern blush.  There were many occasions that fetchmail would not 
start up when the user logged in. I had set fetchmail to execute by 
using a shell script placed in the .kde/autostart directory. However, if 
fetchmail had a stale lock file, fetchmail simply wouldn't run. No error 
messages, I didn't run fetchmail in a terminal. I have no doubt that 
staff would have complained about the bash shell that appeared on their 
screen every 30 seconds. The point is, why didn't it just get the mail 
anyway?Fetchmail has a few other annoying quarks too.

With staff intermittantly not receiving their emails, I set our server 
up to check emails as well, but to not delete them. That way I would 
have a copy on the server in addition to what was being delivered to the 
desks. If they couldn't find their mail there, at least I had a backup. 
What I painfully learned was that it will delete emails making 
assumptions that it shouldn't; the assumption that if the mail for a 
person has already been checked elsewhere, but the mail was not deleted, 
it ought to, by default, delete those emails AND NOT DELIVER THEM unless 
told otherwise. What a stunt! I would stop using fetchmail, but I think 
the problems have gone away. Furthermore, I don't want to  make a 
significant time investment to learn another program, that could have 
its own quarks.

* Big Picture

The fact is, that even without these experiences, other people  have had 
similar ones, and they will talk to other people, and after a while, the 
word on the street willl be that Linux has a "steep learning curve." It 
is unfortunate.

Why I think this happens

Two reasons:

1. The distribution industry as a whole is operating inefficiently by 
not sharing code.

For example, the Community, based on necessity alone, shouldn't have 
developed both the RPM and APT installation systems. Right now there are 
a lot of them working on the same things. The disappointing fact is that 
unless coalitions are formed, or mergers are made, this will not change.

2. The distribution industry has a financial motivation to sell 
consulting services, and that motivates them to not work on ease of use 
solutions.

This is what I find ironic. There are plenty of comuter consultants out 
there that make a fine living supporting Microsoft products that are 
"dummed down." I am sure that consultants would actually be making more 
supporting a dummed down version of Linux than they are today.

3.  The Linux environment changes often enough that the development of 
certain configuration tools would turn out to be a futile process, 
because it would have to be changed frequently.

For example, the recent change of GCC versions, or device requiring a 
recompile for each kernel version. Lindows' using a device file system 
that resets at each reboot, while SuSe's does not. Two packaging 
systems, etc.

I think that the Community will not change until it feels the pain of 
its fragmentation.  I also feel that the Haloween Documents are a tool 
used in M$'s favor, to get he Community to be overconfident and ignore 
the practical issues that keep Linux off of people's desks.
