&gt; &gt; Would it bemore the fact of existing mac users staying with macs and using
&gt; &gt; the defacto OS?
&gt; 
&gt; Cha Ching! give that man a beer...
&gt; 
&gt; sounds about right to me. as thats what i have seen from the trenches...
&gt; but most MacosX users dont know what a kernel is, dont know what an API,
&gt; but do know "its pretty but my quark/photoshop/app is a flaky as heck!"
&gt; quickly followed by; "dont tell me i have to fork out another 5K$AU for another upgrade!!"

Actually, that's not even close to true, unless your 'most' users are just running
OSX under all their existing OS9 software (why bother? It's a bit like installing
linux and only running Windows apps under wine). The reality is that OSX is very
stable, and so are any native apps (as oposed to the 'classic' apps that run in
the 'classic' environment under OSX) If one OS9 app crashes, it will usually take
out the environment as well, so you have OSX running without a problem and
anything in classic only as reliable as your most unreliable OS9 app.

If 'most' Mac OSX users are running 'classic' apps (eg Quark) under OSX in the
classic environment, they are asking a lot of the system, and ignoring the
benefits of using the new system. Every Mac user I have met who is running OSX,
can't wait to rid themselves of the old classic apps. I haven't used classic for
months.

Quark did not have a OSX version last time I heard, but Adobe has it's suite
including photoshop ported and running nicely.

The only app I have on my system that is a teeny bit flakey is MS Word.x It gets
upset with some strange filenames and dies. Normal stuff is fine.

I agree with your implied critisism of the cost of upgrading every major app. In
the end, the user has to decide - swap to Windows (and re-buy everything anyway),
or go with OSX, perhaps on the existing hardware. We're preaching to the converted
on this list, most would avoid Windows if there is a choice.

Regards,

Michael
