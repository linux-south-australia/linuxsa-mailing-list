&gt; 
&gt; KH&gt; Do we have any updates on whats happening on Saturday?

&gt; KH&gt; Are we getting any feedback on the "local community input"?
&gt; 
&gt; KH&gt; Is there a big picture for *community* wireless in Adelaide?

&gt; Kim, I'm not quite sure what you mean by "whats happening on Saturday"
&gt; as the agenda for the day has been published for a number of weeks. We
&gt; have however released more details about the events found in recent
&gt; news on the Air-Stream website (www.air-stream.org).
&gt; 
&gt; May I ask who you mean by "we" getting feedback on local community
&gt; input ? 

"We are gathering together again to talk about the Air-Stream project
and give/get feedback from the community about whats going to happen in
the near future." -- <A HREF="http://www.air-stream.org/">http://www.air-stream.org/</A>

This is what my question was refering to. Yes, its on your front page.

Obviously the "we" means "me" and others who are not currently
part of air-stream.

&gt; Air-Stream represents the entire Adelaide wireless community,

Air-stream currently represents Air-stream members, surely...

&gt; with our goal being to unite all effort into one project to benefit
&gt; all users. 

When I last talked to one of the Air-stream folks at the installfest,
there was very little interest in the wider community. 

But as this seems to be changing, I am far more interested.

&gt; Decisions regarding the association may be made by members, but we are
&gt; here to serve the community and hence always listen to any input
&gt; individuals provide. 

Ok, this is good. There seems to be a lot of folks out there that
have been somewhat disenchanted about Air-stream. If this is to
change this is good. =)

&gt; We have been working to provide a structure for all wireless
&gt; enthusiasts in Adelaide for almost two years now, with some approaches
&gt; being more successful than others. 

Do we get to hear about these on the Open Day?

&gt; We have come to a stage where we have evolved from a single segregated
&gt; wireless project to a network of wireless access points and now have
&gt; the capacity to assist the community become a part of something we
&gt; have enjoyed for a long time.
 
So, can I be part of that, even if I don't want to become a member,
but participate by building and running a couple of nodes[1]?
(Unless there is a good reason to become a member..)

&gt; The bigger picture has not changed in those two years -- to create a
&gt; community based mesh of access points around the Adelaide metro area
&gt; and to one day become part of the national community wireless scheme
&gt; by linking with other states.

Ok, but again do I have to become a member, I don't have the need for
any Internet access or online gaming servers...

I want to get a couple of nodes up and work with wireless and new
routing/networking tech.


&gt; I hope this answers your questions, but as their meaning was a little
&gt; hard to decipher, I gave you a brief rundown anyway.

Maybe, but maybe our definitions of "community" differ. Never mind =)

Ok, look at it like this, I do not see any benifits in becoming a member
of Air-stream at this time. I hope you can understand this. I have
talked to other folks in Adelaide, who are in the same boat.

What are the advantages?  Are there legal implications of using
wireless?  Are the legal issues regarding internet traffic? 

I am not trying to be difficult. I just haven't been able to figure out
why Air-stream exsists in its current format?  And why it is the main
body that manages all the "community" wireless projects?

Jokingly; Does one have to be a Prince Alfred College old scholar? ;)

Cheers,

Kim
