&gt;&gt; I am really only commenting on the issue mentioned in Greg's Blog :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As someone who has worked on GPL'd code, and who also works for a company
&gt;&gt; that hopes to ship a very successful NAS device, this issue is of great
&gt;&gt; interest.
&gt;
&gt; It wasn't clear to me what they meant by the GPL being "too
&gt; restrictive". Greg?

Difficult to say.  I have a whole lot of hand-scrawled notes on the
back of the programme, and even when I got hold of the slides (under
NDA, the only ones of the seminar like that; the rest will be on the
NOIE web site Real Soon Now), there was no indication.  I'm sure I
have a number of things written down inaccurately, but I'm sure I got
this one right.

It should be clear what restrictions he's talking about.  In a
nutshell, the BSD license says "take it, use it as you want, don't
blame us for it, don't pretend you wrote it".  The GPL also says "if
you give this to anybody else, you must give them source code.  If you
modify it, you must apply the same license to the result".

In a government perspective, we're left with the question "too
restrictive for whom?".  It doesn't seem to be the Government.  Why
should they care?  Well, in fact there is a question of the legal
meaning of "publishing".  How big is the entity which develops it?  If
it's outsourced from a specific agency and another agency wants the
software as well, do they have to pay as well?  Currently the answer
is "yes", though obviously NOIE's trying to change that with different
contracts which make the government, rather than the agency, the owner
of the "IP".

Apart from this, I think Gartner's off topic.  From what I understand
now, the Government agencies are probably not thinking of writing open
source software, they're thinking of building their own systems on top
of them.  In such a case, there's no difference between GPL or BSDL.
