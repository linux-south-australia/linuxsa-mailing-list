Jim,
I have read that there are security issues with having register_globals
turned on, but I thought it was fairly secure because php generates the
session IDs from both the server time hashed with the random function.

in my first case, Rosie's thing worked which i appreciate and this is not a
problem because the server is on an internal range and is also running SSL.

BUT if i we're to have a server on the outside world and had register
globals on it, what kind of problem would i be getting into?  just session
hijacking or something nastier than that like root access etc?   would
running an SSL server remove this problem?  I've been doing a bit of reading
and it was recommended that the server should be SSL if one was using
session IDs.

I'm completely new to this as you might have imagined and want to learn.
thanks heaps
Matthew

With PHP 4.2 onwards there is a configuration parameter REGISTER_GLOBALS
which is off by default.  REGISTER_GLOBALS would assign $a to the value of a
passed through the URL automatically.  This change is a good thing for
security, but it does mean that at some point in your code, you should...

if(isset($_GET['a'])) {
  $a = floatval($_GET['a']);
};

... you may still see examples and older code written with the assumption
that REGISTER_GLOBALS is turned on, but the "right" (and more secure) way to
do things these days is to assume register globals is turned off and code as
above.

Jim.

Subject: PHP Gurus? page link to change global registered variables?


Hi,
I've got some global variables working, but i want to be able to change them
from clicking a link in the page.  i can't seem to get this working.  any
gurus in the house tell me where i'm going wrong?  everytime i call the page
the counter gets incremented which is good, but i want to be able to set the
counter to say 60.

I'm not trying to reset a counter, but this code illustrates exactly what
i'm trying to do.  i've tried using _SESSION in front of the a, tried using
htmlspecialchars() function as suggested by the manual.

majorly stuck.

Matt

        print "Session New&lt;br&gt;";
}
else {
        $a++;
        print "Session Registered Already&lt;br&gt;";
}
print "&lt;a href='test1.php'&gt;Increment $a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;";
print "&lt;a href='test1.php?a=60'&gt;Change $a&lt;/a&gt;";
