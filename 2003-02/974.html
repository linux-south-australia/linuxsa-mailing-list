Don't feel bad Ian, even the so-called 'experts' have their presentations screw-up
on them. there's been some famous ones with Bill Gates.

I was at a MS-focussed presentation once, and the audience became aware that the
presenter was running his presentation on a Mac! He got asked why at question
time, and he said 'because I want it to work' Much hilarity was had over that, I
can tell you.

I'm not silly enough to suggest you get a Mac, but one thing I find is that you
need to complete the creation of the presentation in plenty of time, and rehearse
it in as close to the same circumstances as you are going to deliver it. Assume
nothing. If possible, email it to someone else who can bring it on their equipment
in case yours goes belly up on the day. 

And accept a general rule that you have too many slides and throw some away.

Sorry I missed it, I was stuck at home babysitting...

&gt; At LCA 2003 we were shown a great presentation by Rasmus Lerdof using a 
&gt; special script he had written in PHP (no surprise there) and it ran his 
&gt; demo perfectly including allowing him to run software segments off the 
&gt; page so to speak.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we need something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Then again, the PowerPoint type presentation is expected for many 
&gt; venues and I wanted to show what was the latest in OpenSource 
&gt; implementations. This is the first time it has let me down like this 
&gt; otherwise it would have been a great demo of the ability of 
&gt; OpenOffice.org and OpenSource to compete with the big guy in the field.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
