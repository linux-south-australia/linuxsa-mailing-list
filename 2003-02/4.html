&gt; Because otherwise Australian IT would not have been there, Kate's boss
&gt; didn't see that it was important enough to pay her fare. Sun, as one of
&gt; the big sponsors said yes, we believe it is important for you to be
&gt; there, same as they paid for my fare. Nobody said to me to treat Sun
&gt; nicely.
&gt;
&gt; They got the chance to put a good story forward, Kate wrote them up.
&gt; Now they give her good info and she writes that up. It doesn't
&gt; necessarily mean a relationship exists.

No, but it does mean two things:

1.  They've had a chance (and obviously used it) to hand Kate a
    story.  There's nothing illegitimate about that; I'm planning to
    do similar things on behalf of AUUG.  But it does slightly change
    the perspective.
2.  Even without the story, Kate is not going to be unfriendly to Sun.

&gt; On the educational Linux list (that grew out of the LCA) there has
&gt; been a full discussion on how MS and others will be represented and
&gt; speaking.  Pia and other Linux reps will be there showing the flag
&gt; for opensource.

Where's this?
