&gt;Rubbish.

&gt;We have to make education our top priority. Rather than making Linux so
&gt;moronic that even morons can understand it, why not make the morons more
&gt;educated so they can understand Linux?
&gt;
Rubbish.

The topic wassn't DSL's desires for Linux. The topic was Linux desktop 
marketshare.  

Further,  there are some very inteligent people that are smart enough to 
know that they shouldn't need to go back to college just to use an 
operating system.

It's outside the scope of practical economics.

&gt;I like User Friendly but that doesn't equate to MORON friendly.

You should have just said you don't care about Linux' market share on 
the desktop.  Because its going to take a dumming down to gain any. That 
was the question.

Anyway, you really should be nice to morons. Morons are people too!:-)
They can't help that they are morons.  Equal rights!

&gt;
&gt;This shift to satisfy the dolts and imbeciles is annoying...
&gt;  
&gt;
That was all you had to say.
