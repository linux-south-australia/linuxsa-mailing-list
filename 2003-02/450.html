&gt; what did you have in mind? It would be nice to work with other

my present draft of the project is at 
<A HREF="http://www.airnet.com.au/~ilox/nnn">http://www.airnet.com.au/~ilox/nnn</A>
though it is only a draft and there is still a lot of information to be 
placed onto the site.

I have already got the nod from a few high-placed people in the region 
so it is now up to me to pull the required threads together and make 
the proposal real.

All I really need now is the nod from the TAFE people (who have seen 
the original proposal and liked it then) and the technical people (ISPs 
& AirStream) to get on board and tell me what is doable and what kind 
of costs we are talking about.

I am working to making an application in March so there is a lot to do 
and not much time to do it all in. Present guesstimations are that it 
will cost over a million to do all aspects. It might even cost more, I 
just don't know until all the info gets in.

Cheers,  Ian
