&gt; Well no mention of an Open Day date or venue there.

That is an old news post from weeks ago.

&gt; Why would anybody be attending an open day when there isn't a single 
&gt; word about it other than a 'watch-this-space' mention?

The most recent news article is dedicated to the open day, and was posted days ago :) 
&gt; The mention needs to be out in the open so folks who are interested 
&gt; know about it. Brian is right, *you* didn't mention the venue in your 
&gt; original post AND the site doesn't mention the Open Day except as 
&gt; something coming up soon. 

David stuffed up. lol

Its been on the site for days Ian. Delete your IE cache &lt;g&gt;
 
&gt; Maybe the same time as the Open Day was decided somebody could have 
&gt; made a 2 minute amendment to the page just to reflect the event you are 
&gt; publicising?

as amended last week.
 

Everyone stay calm, I know it's exciting :)
