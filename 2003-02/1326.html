I'm fairly certain the SVEC pcmcia card has no antenna socket. Live a
little, spend the extra $5.
A mate recently took his on holidays from Alice to Darwin on a
relatively long war drive and had no problems. They were also playing
lan games between the cars on the way. Lets face it, its a bloody long,
boring drive. Beats the living shit out of chatting on cb radios.
The SVEC AP should talk happily to any standard 11Mbps card (like either
SVEC or Entrasys cards). My AP is a Dlink DWL900 (not the 900+)and has
only one antenna. Not really a problem as I live out of town but if you
want to link with a mate in the area you can use a dual antenna model
and devote one output to a pringles can on the roof.
The SVEC AP would be great for this. You will need windows system to
configure it but once it is set up it will happily plug into your hub,
switch, firewall, tcp/ip enabled fridge, mower, thongs or toothbrush.

&gt; doesn't say if it can take an external antenna, so I am assuming
&gt; it can't. If it can't take an external antenna I will go with the Entrasys.

&gt; Any known problems mixing the Entrasys and SVEC AP?
&gt; Thanks in advance for any comments.
