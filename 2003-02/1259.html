&gt; You ought not to think of it as winning or losing, however since you
&gt; asked me what I think about your previous work: Well of course most of
&gt; your projects are not presented with source.

Most of my projects? no.. look again... only the windows ones are closed source, because its damn hard to make windows code look presentable. Especially when your writting for a real compiler and having to cripple it for MSVC too.

My solar system represenetation is closed source quite simple because I need a job, and unscrupulous companies like Ratbag stand far too much to gain from stealing my code. The "opengl.zip" is merely a much older version of the solar system representation.

&gt; 
&gt; In your listrot program you display error messages on stdout instead of
&gt; stderr, which is rather bad form.  You also assume any file with "BMP"

Funny that, how you jump on the most pathetic of my programs, which I made in about 20 minutes for personal use, which I only distribute for friends who want thier boot logo/background rotated.
Also its a DOS/console program, stderr is not an option. Its not particularly easy to access stderr.


&gt; in it's name is a windows bmp file, and you truncate the name after

Well der, I made it for myself and other similarly literate people. Does my homepage look inviting to lesser skilled computer users? Note the complete lack of images. The stale layout. The link to the Mozilla guide on how to make stale web-pages. I don't want lesser skilled people coming to it.

&gt; the "P".  More importantly, you make only the most token of efforts at
&gt; validating user input.  Should the file specified by the user (on the
&gt; command line) have, say, only one line, your program wanders off into
&gt; la-la land looking for line terminators that never appear.

Did you even read the documentation? The instructions are quite specific for anyone with reasonable command line skills. What are you a Microsoft Employee? Infact the documentation GUARANTEE's it will crash unless you are on your toes.
 
&gt; As a matter of style I think it's better to define local functions above
&gt; where they are called, rather than to pre-declare them and then define
&gt; them later.  That is:
&gt; 
&gt;    void do_work(){...}
&gt;    main() { ...; do_work(); ... }
&gt; 
&gt; is better than:
&gt; 
&gt;    void do_work();
&gt;    main() { ...; do_work(); ... }
&gt;    void do_work(){...}

Well as a matter of style good for you. I prefer to have main() at the top, but just as you said, its a personal preference thing.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, you really should declare all global identifiers static unless you
&gt; want them to appear outside the scope of the compiland.  I've previously
&gt; fought with libraries which gratuitously exposed their inner functions,
&gt; and now I say: Everything static unless you really want it available
&gt; externally.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, that's more than enough for a very quick look.

Who cares? its a dodgy hack. Feck, even the documentation says expect it to crash. Even worse, its %90 batch files, but you didn't complain about that did you? Do you like them or something?

How about you have a look at a program not the script.. did you notice it's the only one that doesnt list requirements?

How about you look at a real program, one that isnt a bloated script, like say track.zip, nah thats way to big for you to understand. Besides it contains direct hardwre programming.. you'd never grasp that. I mean you had enough trouble with a script.

spin.zip is only one source file... but nah... it too contains direct hardware access.... hmm you could try looking at hack.zip... but thats an assembly program, you'd probably go into convultions.

Your sticking up for MSVC really makes something look wrong here... hmm... are you one of those poor fools who's invested lots of time and money into learning microsoft products? Are you a MSCE?'
Because anyone who seriously uses MSVC, and actually knows the standards, will tell you without batting an eyelid that it is horribly flawed... yet you sidestep all accusations to that effect.... Are you bill gates? One of his employees?

I'm running an operating system now, of my own design. It never crashes. No one owns it. I can freely give it to people. And my sanity is slowly returning. If you want I can burn you a copy (89 Minute disc's only, so you'll need a half descent CD drive)... however it is not user friendly to install... I'm of the opinion that stupid people shouldn't install operating systems (let alone software)... system administrators should install operating systems. So you will complain about the install interface (a bash shell), but if you look past that, when you get it running (if you want I can write out the 20 commands needed to install it) you will find its completely GUI orientated, and completely skinned. So you should have no troubles getting into it. And you can stop taking whatever drug it is thats making you keep so overly calm. No one sticks up for microsoft products without either being out of thier skull on drugs or being mentally unstable. Do yourself a favour... free your computer... your mind will follow.
