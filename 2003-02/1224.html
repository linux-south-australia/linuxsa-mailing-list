&gt; I have a request on behalf of a 23-y-o jewish Israeli young man.
&gt; He sees no future in Israel and would like to come to Australia.
&gt; He is familiar with C++ and has done some sysadmin stuff, but his main
&gt; experience has been with various M$ OS.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  What State of Australia would provide his most likely avenue for IT employment?

There seems to be a lot more work in Sydney than anywhere else. Your
friend may find, though, that he can be employed by a Sydney company and
live in Adelaide (for example).

&gt; 2.  Ditto - IT training, especially Unix-based?
&gt; 3.  Would Linux, BSD or ?? be his best avenue for the future?

Perhaps. Possibly the best thing to do (I'd do this if I were in the
same situation) is to check out Australian-based job sites (I think
there's a link to one from <A HREF="http://www.news.com.au/">http://www.news.com.au/</A>) and look for the
sorts of position that he'd like. If he doesn't have the qualifications
for that particular field, try doing training in that area.

Your friend may also find that he has to start lower down the food
chain, despite having experience elsewhere. I had a friend from England
who had to work in a Windows PC support job for 12 months and move up
from there.

Hope it helps,
Matt
