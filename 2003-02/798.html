David,

&gt;&gt; The Linux Community has to make ease of use and user friendliness _its
&gt;&gt; top priority_, if it views the statement below as a problem and wants
&gt;&gt; to solve it.
&gt;
&gt;I like User Friendly but that doesn't equate to MORON friendly.

There is a definite difference.  I've found myself wishing that Windows XP
had an "I'm not a complete fscking idiot" option numerous times, so that in
one step I could turn off all the "protective" features what won't show me
what's in my root, program files, and windows directories, and all that
other windows crap.  Windows, in its effort to be user friendly, generally
gives you a "friendly" error message, rather than a decent error message
which would actually hint at the problem so you can solve it.  Windows is
pretty much moron friendly, but its definitely not sysadmin (or even
knowledgeable user) friendly!

Linux on the other hand has good sysadmin tools, but lacks the general user
friendliness in places.  There is a balance point somewhere between where
Linux is now, and what Windows XP provides.  I think its that balance point
that Linux needs to aim for, not total "moron friendliness".

Jim.
