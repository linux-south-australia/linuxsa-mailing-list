&gt;driver.  There's no reason to believe that error checking in 
&gt;cp would be
&gt;more reliable than error checking in the kernel/driver (where 
&gt;it belongs.)

Suppose that error correcting at kernel/driver level exists, but it only can
detect errors of up to three bits in any one packet or block. Suppose that
there was a four bit error that was undetected by the kernel/driver. This
error would be detected by a different scheme, such as md5 checksum,
operates at a different level (the file level) to the kernal/driver stuff
(which operates on individual blocks). Of course, if you were
extra-paranoid, you would want to know exactly what type of error md5's fail
on, what type of error the kernel/driver code fails on, and be confident
that the likelyhood of them co-inciding on your network fabric is low
enough. You can never be 100% confident that what you sent is what you got.
Never. You can only trade probablilities for overheads (which is one reason
why the driver stuff may not be reliable _enough_ -- making it that reliable
may introduce too much overhead into that layer)...
