&gt; I guess my next question will be as to how I get onto
&gt; the Internet with this - i.e. where do I get a point-of-presence.
&gt; Maybe I can set up my own home phone for this.
&gt; Or.... maybe I just GRIC or something, i.e. some sort
&gt; of global roaming thing.
&gt; I bet that's it.

For global roaming, we've just had an 'ipass' account setup (though
Optus - www.ipass.com).  There is a windows client which contains all
the ISP phone numbers around the world..  and this is where this
Friday afternoon story begins, with the manager leaving to Beijing on
the Saturday.

After receiving the windows client, a phonecall to our Optus
rep. explaining that we don't use windows, was met with an 'Ohh'...
While waiting for a responce I looked up an local(!) ISP, Ozemail in
Sydney (I'm sure their phone number is local though) and managed to
get past reception (we wern't a customer) to someone who handled their
ipass accounts.  When connecting to a local ISP the username is
mangled by putting @106 on the end of it (eg. <A HREF="mailto:user@106">user@106</A>) and this is
used to validate the user as an ipass customer.

Our optus rep. did get back with a phonelist of all the ISP's
involved.  (He didn't know about the '@106' username extention.)
Turned out to be in a Mac text file format.  Grep'ing though the file
for Beijing didn't work because the file is seen a one long line..
'more' was more useful than 'less'.

We were able to extract a couple of relevent phone numbers
(but I wasn't allowed to fly to Singapore to test it).
