&gt; So I don't accept your point about not gaining much by doing a verify.
&gt; If your point was valid, then there wouldn't be much point in md5sum
&gt; checks either!

There is nothing you can do in cp that cannot be done in driver level.  If
md5 sums were needed I'm sure they would be put in the driver, or in the
hardware.  Either way they are NOT needed in cp.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't see why the idea is absurd and warrants a beating!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; David is probably itching to try out his new cat o' nine tails
&gt;&gt; he smuggled back through customs.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd better watch myself then! :-)

There is nothing wrong with my old cat o' nine tails.  Flagellation aside,
if you still don't see the absurdity of doing read after write in cp then
you probably weren't paying close enough attention.  Argue that unix should
read after write, if you think it's worth the effort, but don't ask for it
to be done in the wrong place.
