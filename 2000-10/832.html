Having had a customer fall victim to this myself, I asked myself the
same question.  One reason appeared to be to use the proxy to hack
into web sites, judging by the amount of unread postmaster mail
with the "cease hacking our web server" subject lines.

&gt; There is some benefit/fun/credos in making others suffer unnecessary
&gt; traffic? (I could point my finder at the ISP here, but they have been
&gt; reasonably helpful in the past.)

Bear in mind that some countries don't pay as much for bandwidth
as they do here, and others just don't realise that (or care, when
it comes down to it).
