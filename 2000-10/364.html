&gt; The consensus, Richard, is don't do it....

I'm not so sure about this.  If he doesn't, then somebody needs to go
and sit in front of the machine if it's waiting for an e2fsck.  When
they get there, what are they going to do?  I understand that e2fsck
-y is not a great idea, because it may make things worse, but what are
the other options?

- Run the machine without a clean FS?  (sounds like a bad idea)

- Load up debugfs and fsck it manually just in case e2fsck would have
  made the problem worse?  (doubtful they will do this)

- Back up the system (in case e2fsck stuffs it up), then run e2fsck
  -y?  (a good idea, but the system is backed up nightly anyway, so
  may as well just run e2fsck -y)

- Run fsck, answer yes to all the questions, and hope it doesn't make
  things worse?  (that's what most people do anyway, so may as well
  just run e2fsck -y)

So, my conclusion is: unless you're going to attempt to fix the FS
yourself, then provided that you have current backups, running e2fsck
-y doesn't sound like a bad idea to me.

Did I miss something?
