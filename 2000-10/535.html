While I'm nowhere near an expert on what should and should not be included in
the kernel, I take exception to the statement that "no matter what you do, there
are times when you can't detect errors".

The whole idea of a cryptographic hash (ie MD5, SHA-1, or nowadays SHA-256 even)
is to verify that a chunk of data has not changed by comparing pre- and post-
hashes.  In our case, performing a hash of all the data (tar it up) prior to
copying and obtaining the same hash afterwards _guarrentees_ that all data was
copied correctly[1].

Veracity/tripwire/md5sum all use cryptographic hashes to guarrentee that the
data is the same as before.  If the hashes don't match the hash itself can't
tell you what past has changed - that's the value-added bit that
veracity/tripwire gives you.

[1] For a "good" hash.  MD5 and the SHAs are pretty much accepted as being
collision-free, that is, it's infeasible to come up with two chunks of data that
produce the same hash.  So if there was even a single bit error, the hash would
be significantly different.
