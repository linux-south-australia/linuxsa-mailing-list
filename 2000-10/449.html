		G'Day All. I Was Wondering if it would be possible to setup
a dial in
server.

It's certainly possible!

		What would I need to get one going and if this is
		possible on RedHat 6.0 if someone could assist me help would
be appriciated.

Have a look at the mgetty+sendfax package, comes with all Redhat distros.
It all depends on whether you just want to dial in to the PC itself, and/or
dial in to it & access the network behind the dialin server, both can be
achieved with relative ease using mgetty+sendfax.
We have a dialup server with 2 external modems, set up originally w/ RH6.0,
now running RH6.2 on a P120, 32mb RAM.
This server has been up & working successfully for over 12 months, the only
downtime has been a couple power failures, and the upgrade to RH6.2. (I
formatted & started again, I'd played around with the server a bit,
installing other software & in general stuffing the PC up!! :-)
Took me less than 10 minutes (after the install of RH), to get the server
back & answering calls again!
Just read the mgetty howto's/documentation, also I think the PPP howto has
some useful stuff relating to dialup servers.
