&gt; G'day from the Para-Olympics city, &lt;g&gt;.
&gt;=20
&gt; As an alternative to Windows NT Terminal Server, do you think it is
&gt; possible to run a Xserver, WINE, MYOB on Linux with a Xclient on the
&gt; workstations?
&gt;=20

I recently setup Win4Lin 2.0 (beta) and VNC to do something similar do =
what you are asking. There is a patch for XVNC that allows it to start =
from inetd, and kdm can be configured such that when a user logs into X, =
the desktop manager is Win4Lin (ie Windows). It is indistinguishable =
from the real thing as far as I can tell. It even supports thing that =
may be a long time coming in Wine, such as ODBC connectivity.=20

However, as Richard Share points out in his article, it does not support =
Window Networking - you would have to use "smbmount" before starting =
win4lin if you want to see a NT/Samba server share. The other downside =
is that you need to patch your kernel to use it - I don't know if it is =
feasible, but I find the VMWare use of kernel modules more appealing =
than a direct kernel patch.

Anyway, the bottom line is that you can install a VNC client on any =
device, connect to the server with the XVNC/Win4Lin setup and have a =
"Windows Terminal Server" type functionality.

Win4Lin 2.0 allows for a copy of Windows to be installed per user. Since =
it uses the Linux FS to install files, you can do things like start =
users up with a read-only Windows directory, update all desktops at once =
etc, and as many other centralised management things as you like. =
Multiple users can connect to your server and run as many sessions as =
you have the memory and CPU to support. However an individual user can =
only run one Windows session (ie user fredsmith cannot start two VNC =
sessions on two PC's and run two copies of Windows)

Since there is a SVGALib VNC viewer it is perfectly feasible to have a =
diskless workstation, Network NIC card with a boot ROM, then boot linux =
over the network and start VNC. This would be an excellent way of =
setting up a school lab, library, teaching area etc. Or just boot from a =
CDROM if you cannot do diskless boot.=20

It is possible to buy a beefy server (lots of RAM, fast CPU(s)), but use =
cheap P90 diskless workstations. You may never need to upgrade the =
client workstations again (The server is a different matter !). Use kdm =
to give the user the choice to login to Linux using a Windows Desktop, =
KDE desktop - whatever. Whenever you need to upgrade software, it is all =
on the server.

Even without diskless boot, if you use the SVGA based VNC viewer, then =
there is no need to worry about setting up an X client (with all the =
vagaries of XSetup etc) for each individual PC,.

VNC over a LAN is surprisingly fast an usable. If using with Win4Lin and =
Windows 98, use the "TweakUI" toolkit to turn of active desktop and =
other fancy features and you should find that the setup is *very* =
useable.=20

XVNC has lot of applications even without Win4Lin. Some thoughts:

1 .. View an X desktop from you PC without needing an expensive Windows =
based X Server ( I have never seen a free/cheap one that worked well, =
but I am open to suggestions)

2 .. Use XVNC to start VMWare sessions, then connect to them at will =
using the viewer. I think VMWare is an excellent product, but it irks me =
that I have to start up X windows just to get it going, and if I want a =
VMWare session to start at boot time, I don't really want to have to =
start X at the console just to have this happen.

3 .. Mozilla/IE 5 only sessions that can be used in an "Internet Cafe" =
style setting where you don't want people to see the OS, or muck around =
with settings.=20

Hope this gives you some ideas,=20

Regards,

Andrew Speer
