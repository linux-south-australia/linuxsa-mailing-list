Brian Astill spake...
&gt; 
&gt; Looks like M$ infections have struck again with a message with the subject
&gt; line "CUBIO!" , the content "GOVUOEUIEO and an attachment called 
&gt; BEEEGED.BMP.vbs
&gt; Our State parliament is badly infected - but then we knew that anyway!

The filenames and subject lines are random, and sometimes the subject is
non-existant.  This hit part of our network recently..  (not MY part....)

You know, I think that there are benefits to these bloody stupid email
viruses.  Namely - they make the Administrator painfully aware of how
absolutely insecure MS Outlook is, and possibly even how prone to security
exploits MS Windows can be.

Why, oh why, did they decide that it would be a good idea to allow their
email client to automatically run executable attachments!!  Was that a
conscious decision?  Did someone get fired for it?

You'd think that people would start taking notice and therefore action,
wouldn't you.  But no - half the world's sysadmins and/or users/management
are so bloody zombified by MS...

Ah, I'm preaching to the converted.  Never mind :)  Keep Linuxing.  And/or
Unix-in-general-ing.
