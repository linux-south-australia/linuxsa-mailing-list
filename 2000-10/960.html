As promised many eons ago, the LinuxSA web site has been moved to much
sexier hardware. As a result of this, we now have the disk space to
maintain a search-able mail list archive.

The interface can be accessed from
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html</A>

I am just using a simple htdig interface with no major modifications.
The output hasn't been customised at all. I didn't see a highly
pressing need to remove the references to htdig. Mail me if you
disagree.

Let me know if there are any obvious problems, errors or omissions. I
already know about the escape HTML characters like '&gt;' and '"'.

Cheers

Alex!

On a slightly sadder note, amber.netcraft.com.au, our faithful web,
ftp, database and name server since 1996 has now reached the end of
her life, and will be powered down for the last time in a few days.

Amber is, to this very day, a simple pentium 75, with 32 Megs of
memory and a copy of redhat 4.2. Her up-times are usually around a
year, and that is only because of power related problems. During her
life she has faithfully served at least 16 terabytes of data. A large
amount of her web content is dynamic, and it is not unusual for her to
have a full ftp server.

Credit should of course go to Amber's Dad, Geoffrey Bennett, who has
been looking after her since she was born.

Amber will be brought back to the NetCraft offices where she will
live out the rest of her life performing light duties.
