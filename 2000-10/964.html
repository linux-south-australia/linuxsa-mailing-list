&gt; However, this is not the issue.  What I want, is to somehow make my
&gt; Linux box redial "smarter".

Sounds like a job for diald
(<A HREF="http://www.loonie.net/~eschenk/diald.html">http://www.loonie.net/~eschenk/diald.html</A>)

Here are some of the options I saw in the diald man page. This is
quite a cut and paste, but it'll save you installing it if it's not
the right thing for you.

  redial-timeout &lt;t&gt;
      Set the delay between dialing attempts to &lt;t&gt;  seconds. The
      default is 30 seconds.

  redial-backoff-start
      Specifies the number  of  consecutive  failures  to connect
      allowed  before  diald starts doubling the delay between dialing
      attempts after each  attempt.  This  command  can  be  used  to
      prevent diald from overwhelming the phone lines when the  remote
      side is extremely busy. If this command is not specified
      redial-backoff-start is taken to be infinity, which effectively
      turns off the backoff algorithm.  When redial-backoff-start is
      set, diald will use redial-timeout  as  the  delay  between
      each of the first redial-backoff-start  unsuccessful  calls.
      After this diald will double the timeout after each failure,
      up to a limit of redial-backoff-limit seconds.  A  successful
      connection  resets the backoff algo­ rithm.

  redial-backoff-limit
      Set the maximum number of seconds diald will  delay between
      failed  calls  when it invokes the backoff algorithm. The
      default value  is  600  seconds  (10 minutes).

  dial-fail-limit
      Sets  the maximum number of consecutive failed con­ nection
      attempts diald will allow.  If  this  limit is  exceeded  diald
      will block further connections until an "unblock" command is
      issued on the command FIFO.   If  this is set to 0 diald will
      not enforce any limit.  The default value is 0.  When this con­
      dition  occurs  diald will issue the following message to the
      system logs:

      "Too many dialing failures in a row. Blocking  con­ nection."

      This command is intended for use at sites that need to avoid the
      possibility  of  diald  attempting  a large  number  of  long
      distance  phone calls to a machine that is not operating
      correctly. Once diald blocks  the  connection an operator can
      investigate the cause, correct the problem, and then issue  the
      "unblock"  command  to allow diald to continue. The link may be
      manually opened while blocked but  will not open on demand until
      it has been unblocked.

Cheers

Alex!
