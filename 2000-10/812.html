&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been looking for a 10/100 24 port hub with twin pair fibre option Unmanaged. The best I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have seen so far is the same as above but managed.  My question is... can I get this type of
&gt; &gt; &gt; hub unmanaged?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If it needs to be unmanaged, what's wrong with an ordinary hub and a
&gt; &gt; fibre tranceiver? At least then you don't need to spend as much when you
&gt; &gt; find that upgrading to a managed switch is a much better option :)
&gt; 
&gt; A fibre transceiver may not work. We had a number here, but when we
&gt; tried to use them with the new D-Link switch, we found that there was no
&gt; network connectivity whatsover. 2 weeks worth of experts looking at the
&gt; problem and we were told that there was a compatibility problem between
&gt; that and the switch.

Unfortunately, the gear is getting too cheap so the field is filling
with "value" suppliers for both hubs and transceivers.  One of the
sources of this "value" is less than rigorous testing.

The main problem with an ordinary hub and using two fiber AUI is that
the form factor is usually 24*10baseT + 1*AUI.  So you'll either
need to go for a chassis-based switch with say, 2*12*100/10BaseTX +
8*10BaseF wihich will incur a significant price rise.  Or have a
look for a 24*10BaseT + 2*slot.

I suggest you have a look at the HP switch range.  I recall a
24*10/100BaseTX + 1slot.  The slot will take a 4*100BaseFX card.

If you need to be cheap and nasty, then go with 24*10BaseT and buy
two 10BaseT/10BaseF converters.  Be warned that these have very low
reliability.

I strongly suggest you try and use a switch rather than a hub.
The difference between 3Mbps and 100Mbps to a file server is
quiet noticable, especially if the file server has enough RAM
for a decent file cache.
