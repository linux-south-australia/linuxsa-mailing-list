Hi Fraser,

Fraser Farrell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fraser@trilobytes.com.au">fraser@trilobytes.com.au</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt; Another disadvantage of ADSL is that it won't be available
&gt; outside the major cities anytime soon.

Depends on your definition of "anytime soon".

&gt; Furthermore, ADSL will not be made available in areas where cable
&gt; TV and the like already exist.

What a silly thing - ADSL is available in capital cities NOW.
Cable internet is available in Melbourne and Sydney along side
ADSL - so I don't understand the basis for your claim here.

&gt; This was the story I got from several of the ISPs at the recent
&gt; computer expo at Wayville showgrounds

Please - who are they - name them so we can correct their very
wild and inaccurate understand of the subject!

&gt; (it's interesting what you can learn when your kids drag you off
&gt; to these "glitzy" events ;-)

It is certainly interesting what you can be told by ill-informed
people who *think* they know what they are talking about.

&gt; Neither ADSL or cable are/will be available where I live & work
&gt; for at least two years, and the last time I enquired about ISDN
&gt; for my business it was going to cost ~$11000 to install. Not to
&gt; mention the ongoing costs of ISDN. So it looks like my modems
&gt; will be sending data out to the world for a while yet.

Which suburb do you live and work in?

&gt; When I tried to get a permanent BigPond connection via my Linux
&gt; box early this year, it was seven weeks of utter frustration
&gt; trying to get their authentication to work.

So you should have called Internode, a local SA ISP which does
support almost any OS you care to use that supports PPP, Linux
included :)

If the helpdesk folks can't answer your linux question directly,
they'll put you in touch with someone who can.

Cheers

Leigh
