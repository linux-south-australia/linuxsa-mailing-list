It's probably pre- and post-spin doctoring.  It will be interesting
to see if WSJ stick to their claims; I imagine that they are checking
with their source.  C7 were just regurgitating the MS press release.
As the DoJ/MS trial showed, MS press releases have contained blatant
lies in the past.

It's interesting that, whilst claiming that Windows + Office hasn't
been copied or modified, they are not saying what products
were.

This is actually a problem for end users, as the correct response of
the more secure Microsoft sites will now be to remove all products
apart from Windows and Office that have been updated in the past six
months.

It seems to me that this is the real advantage of open source in
this situation.  Someone may hack sourceforge.org, but it will be
plain what software may then contain a trojan horse.  It is usually
then a matter of hours to find a reliable copy of the pre-hack source
and apply audited patches from there.  The respsonse to the security
issue is totally under the control of the site: depending upon their
security needs they can ignore the problem, remove the software, wait
for a official "clean" release, or work with trusted collaborators,
contractors or staff to build a "clean" release of their own.

Whereas Microsoft sites are now left with a significant potential security
exposure until Microsoft publishes the list of potentially compromised
software and then audits that software.  On past performance this event will
probably be determined more by marketing criteria than by security criteria.
Even then it is still problematic for sites that wish to verify that the
claimed auditing has actually occurred.
