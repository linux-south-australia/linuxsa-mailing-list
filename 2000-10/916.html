Umm i think that id better intervene at this point.. could i ask who you are
saying is breaking the law?
I originally asked about the concept of wireless networking 2 computers for
playing games. Somewhere along the line it has changed to setting up a
wireless ISP. I have no interest in this theory, I have a great isp, and
support them well and have no intention of web sharing. All I wanted to
achieve was good quake fragging with a neighbour, not setting up an isp :) I
have found a few sites in the mean time that might be of interest to anyone
who might like to learn some more.
www.x.net.au
www.adelaide.air.net.au
www.air.net.au

if i have missed the cross road, and someone has asked about the thoery of a
wireless isp, and the conversation is valid, please excuse me :)

Cheers

Andrew

ps. Thanks for the stimulating conversation, it is great to listen to great
minds thinking !
