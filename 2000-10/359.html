&gt; Can anyone tell me what a "signal 11" is,

Signal 11 is SIGSEGV, segmentation violation.  It means that your
program has attempted to access unallocated memory.  As such, it is
normally a software problem.

&gt; why it causes installation to abort

Well, the program has just died, and that shouldn't have happened.

&gt; and how I can avoid it.  The only helpful message seems to be
&gt; "signal 11 received".

That's not much, is it?

There are a couple of possibilities here:

1.  There's something in your configuration which tickles a bug in the
    installation scripts.

2.  There's something wrong with your hardware which causes it to
    malfunction, giving the impression that the program has behaved
    incorrectly.

Which one is it?  If the bug occurs at different times, bets are on
(2).  If it always happens in *exactly* the same place, it could be
either.  If it happens in a program you've just written, and which you
haven't tested yet, it's probably (1).

Have you installed Linux or BSD on this machine before?  If this
happens only with RH 7, it also points to (1).
