Hi Russell, 

I found a packages that does what I'm looking for. I know it's their problem
to look after their password but they don't get the message - and it
presented an interesting challenge, hence my quest.

www.squidguard.com

Very nice package - take a look.

Rgds, 
Kevin

&gt; Hence the problem - the one user1 user name is getting way 
&gt; more than his
&gt; fair share of browsing done on his account. Seems he'll complain about
&gt; having to pay the bill but won't shut his trap when it comes 
&gt; to his passwd.
&gt; I've explained to him the impliations of giving his passwd 
&gt; away dozens of
&gt; times. 

if there's money involved, then IMHO, it's his responsibility to keep his
password to himself, or pay the cost... I'd be making enforcing this a low
priority unless there are other factors... perhaps find out why he is giving
away his password, and fix that problem (ie if he does that to allow others
to access his files, etc...)
