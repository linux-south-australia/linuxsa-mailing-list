&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I am investingating large file systems for Linux. Of the order of 100GB+.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; With large file systems comes some big problems, but the main one I have a
&gt;&gt; problem with is backup. At the moment, it takes about 20m/GB to back up our
&gt;&gt; file systems, and while we can move to things like DLT stackers, which may
&gt;&gt; reduce that down to 5-10m/GB, that still means a large backup window is
&gt;&gt; required.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What I am looking for is file systems that allow you to take a snapshot of
&gt;&gt; a live file systems, probably with Copy on Write techniques, so we can
&gt;&gt; backup a snapshot and continue to work on the file system as well.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have found one solution, LVM, but I am looking for suggestions for
others.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;What about Coda? From what I can tell, it allows multiple Small
&gt;filesystems to be seen as one big file system over the network. This
&gt;would enable you to use whatever filesystem your operating system of
&gt;choice supported (It runs on many platforms) and they could each backup
&gt;their own filesystem to their own tape drive.

My problem with splitting the storage up into lots of little file systems
spread around is management headaches. In addition, for higher
availability, I will want to RAID those file systems, and then mirror a lot
of the data across the network (nearby on a 100Mb/s link), so it
increasingly becomes more difficult. 

Also, as far as mirroring is concerned, I know I can get 7.5GB/hour on the
current setup (I measured it), and can increase that to 15 to 30GB/hour by
using more spindles and Ethernet channel bonding, and I would rather not do
that to all the servers ...

&gt;I guess it all depends on what the filesystem is to be used for....

Mostly storing files :-) Some will be image files, other simple data files.
