Hi Richard,
Well as I am a recent immigrant to Linux, having lived and breated MS for
so long. I was extremely annoyed as to the lack of clients with a degree of
sohpistication matching my simple needs.

I have used Eudora Light for pop mail for 5 years. I tried Outlook Express
it was fine until I was forced to re-install win98/nt/2k. Then I got so
jacked off with the lack of export ability in it and its obscure hiding
place for my inbox I deleted it. And went back to Eudora.

Now on he Linux side, I do elm, pine, netscape. I use netscape as it offers
the filtering capabilities I required (very simple) I tried a number of
others, given a client review of sorts I read (spurce, and others), most
were in beta, or ran a gui which was so annoying I binned them. I dont like
netscape but for lack of anything better I'm kinda stuck with it for now.

I want a simple binary that will put the mail into a directory which is
accessbile with grep and has simple mail filtering. And it must be called
Eudora :)

Keep us/me informed as to your findings. I am eally interested.

thanks

Evan

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Well, my second Legacy Files article went up on Linux world a day or so ago
&gt;:-) It was received very well, and there was a lot of interest expressed in
&gt;my suggestion that next month's article would be about mail clients for
&gt;Linux, and especially information about converting Eudora mail (and other
&gt;forms) from Windows to Linux.
&gt;
&gt;While I am aware of a number of mail clients that may help, I am interested
&gt;in suggestions about mail clients that people may be aware of, and the
&gt;extent of the problem with respect to retrieving old mail from another
&gt;environment.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
