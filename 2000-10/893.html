Best be it you are going to install Telecoms. gear is to talk to a
lawyer :-)

&gt; I think the rules have relaxed a bit.

Well, they did change from what they used to be in 1997.

&gt; For instance, someone told me that a few years ago,
&gt; universities in Melbourne were renting properties spaced by
&gt; a bit less than 500 metres because there was some law saying
&gt; that private people could lay their own fiber up to 500 metres
&gt; without going through Telstra.

1) The old "500m" rule is no longer applicable. It's now sections 26 and
27 of the Telecommunications Act 1997.
2) If it's customer cabling, i.e. it's all within your own property, you
can do whatever you feel like! There is nothing that says you can't
install some fibre obtic, or use a wireless LAN, from your house to your
shed out the back. Go nuts. However, if that cable/LAN is then hooked up
in any way to a licenced Teleco's network, then you need to make sure
that the installation is done by an AUSTEL/ACA licenced cabler, or
(under the new system introducted October 3 this year) by a Registered
Cabler.

&gt; There's also such a thing as a 150 MHz band which you can
&gt; do what you like with as long as the range is less than
&gt; a kilometre or something like that.

Not entirely. There is unlicenced spectrum (eg. 2.4 GHz etc), but you
can't do whatever you like with it. If you're using it for a Telecoms
network, you need to be lincenced, unless you can get a section 26/27
exemption. Andrew, it could well be that you can get such an exemption,
and setup the LAN like you want. But you'd want to see a lawyer to make
sure you can do it :-)
