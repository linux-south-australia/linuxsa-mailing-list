<H1>Have I been cracked?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
There have been a few suspicious things happening lately with my
computer.  I'm wondering if my system has been compromised in some way
or whether there's some other explanation.

The most recent thing happened just now.  I have a shell window where
I run the following:

while true; do fetchmail; sleep 100; done

which periodically fetches my mail and lets me see what's happening.
Today I got the following output:

fetchmail: 5.3.3 querying mail.infoeng.flinders.edu.au (protocol POP3) at Tue, 03 Oct 2000 14:36:22 +0930 (CST)
fetchmail: No mail for mark at mail.infoeng.flinders.edu.au
fetchmail: 5.3.3 querying mail.infoeng.flinders.edu.au (protocol POP3) at Tue, 03 Oct 2000 14:38:10 +0930 (CST)
fetchmail: No mail for mark at mail.infoeng.flinders.edu.au
fetchmail: 5.3.3 querying mail.infoeng.flinders.edu.au (protocol POP3) at Tue, 03 Oct 2000 14:39:58 +0930 (CST)
fetchmail: No mail for mark at mail.infoeng.flinders.edu.au
(null): You don't exist.  Go away.

So the early stuff is normal.  It's the last line which bothers me.
It looks like someone has somehow managed to pipe a message to my
window, and knows the kind of output I was expecting.  Is there any
other explanation?

Another strange occurrence happened the other day when I found the
background of my X session had changed.  It was like someone had
blatted up some image or collections of images to my background.  I
thought perhaps I had been lax in my X permissions, but doing xhost
gave:

$ xhost
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect

So am I right that these things look suspicious?  Or is there some
other explanation.

What kinds of things should I look for as evidence for being cracked?
Log files I presume would be a good place to start, but which ones?

Thanks,

Mark.
