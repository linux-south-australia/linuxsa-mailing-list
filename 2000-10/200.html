&gt; &gt; On the topic of connecting a linux computer to

&gt; &gt; is there anything different between this and
&gt; &gt; connecting up to a standard vanilla modem?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not entirely sure how the "modem" works in the Nokia phones, but
&gt; it's not like a Hayes AT interface. I don't think it's like a winmodem
&gt; either, so the phone has some smarts. You still need to buy the windows
&gt; software to get the cable for the phone &lt;-&gt; computer interface, and I
&gt; don't think the Infrared stuff works. If someone knows where to get the
&gt; cables cheap, speak up!
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://gnokii.org/">http://gnokii.org/</A> is attempting to address this, but I don't think it's
&gt; yet ready to be a substitute for a modem/gsm card. It is, however, great
&gt; for sending SMS messages and tweaking the settings on your phone :)

As John indicated, the interface to the Nokia phones is proprietary.
Electrically, an adapter (RS232 to 3.3V level translator) is required, which
can either be purchased or cobbled together quite easily (I used the
connector from a 'hands-free' kit).

The Nokia software for Windows creates a virtual COM port which does
implement a Hayes-style interface, and performs the necessary translation to
the Nokia protocol over the physical COM port, however the details of this
appear to be an on-going problem to decipher for the gnokii team. As you
will see from the gnokii web-site, Nokia have refused to provide the details
of their protcol, which is a great shame.
