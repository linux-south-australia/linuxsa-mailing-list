&gt; Hmm.  I thought that depended on whether you were functioning in an
&gt; ISP-like manner or not.  There's a lot of discussion going on about
&gt; this matter on the wireless networking list
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:wireless@lists.samba.org--see">wireless@lists.samba.org--see</A>
&gt; <A HREF="http://lists.samba.org/listinfo/wireless.">http://lists.samba.org/listinfo/wireless.</A>  If what you're saying is
&gt; true, then most of this is illegal.

Unfortunately, most of it is.

There are two groups of laws involved: (a) the licensing
of radiocommunication devices and (b) the licensing of
telecommunications carriers.

(a) for wireless LAN cards is trivial, as they are already
licensed under a "class" license.

(b) is more problematic.  If you provide communications using
"guided or unguided electromagnetic waves" (radio, laser, wire,
fiber optics) between people in different "immediate circles"
then you need to be a carrier or have a exemption from the Telco
Act.

Two houses of people that do not work for the same employer
are not in the same immediate circle (unless they both hold
an amateur radio license, in which case they are exempted
for radio communications that advance the hobby and science
of radio).

So yes, you are breaking the law.  At the edges, I think we can
compare it to the Copyright Act: minor transgressions probably
aren't going to land you in trouble, but the more major (in scale
and monetary terms) the more dim a view the courts will take.

So setting up a wireless radio ISP without a carrier license
is probably going to land you in deep trouble, whereas prosecuting
you for letting your neighbour use your 802.11 house area network
would be difficult for the DPP to justify.

There's good public policy reasons for licensing carriers.  We
want a world where telephone systems are engineered so that 000
works, we want some coordination of wireless networking to
prevent interference, and so on.

Unfortunately, there's also some areas of the legisation where
the interests of the carriers has taken precedence over the
interests of consumers, and small-area wireless networking
is one of those areas.
