Hi Adam,

Hmmm, can you wrap your lines correctly ...

&gt;Hi all..
&gt;
&gt;I am at the end of my rope trying to diagnose this problem...
&gt;
&gt;I have Samba 2.0.6 set up here.  I want to use roaming profiles with Win98 
&gt;boxes on the network here.  With samba 2.0.5 it was as easy as setting 
&gt;"domain logons = yes" and "logon path = \\yoda\profiles\%u" and creating a 
&gt;share called profiles that pointed to the profile directory.
&gt;
&gt;Under 2.0.6 I have done this and Samba INSISTS on usong ~user for the the
&gt;profile directory; no matter that I have specified EXACTLY where to store 
&gt;profiles.  The profiles share is configured correctly and is browsable.  
&gt;I can log into Windows and the
&gt;logon script executes and I can see all the shares mounted.  I can access H: 
&gt;which is my home dir and manipulate the files there.  I can even browse to 
&gt;\\yoda\profiles\adam and see all the files threre.  I cannot browse to
other's 
&gt;profiles or home dirs.

This was all worked out back in about Feb of this year, and is discussed in
detail in Special Edition, Using Samba. It is also documented in the 2.0.7
or later files in the docs directory.

Samba 2.0.4 and 2.0.5 were wrong in their handling of logon home and logon
path. This is because Windows 9X uses the LAN Manager APIs for getting the
information you want, and the 2.0.4 and 2.0.5 functionality, while it made
things easy for profiles, broke the 'net use /home' statment.

The best you can do with profiles under 2.0.7 and above is to use logon
home (logon path is not used at all for Windows 9X), and to set it to
things like:

   logon home = \\%L\%U\.profile

&gt;Why the f?#k is Samba being a pig about the profile directory?  I will
attach 
&gt;my config file so that you can possibly see where I have gone wrong.

It's not. This is the way things work under Windows 9X clients. Windows NT
allows you to use logon path and put profiles in a separate share.

&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Adam
