&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know how true this is but it is kind of amusing to read the commentry on Slashdot.  Does anyone speak German and can translate?

Well, this is very interesting.
When I read the article, earlier there was a full translation at
Linux Today:

<A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-10-21-017-06-NW-CY-MS

But now it says that it has been "unposted" after about 29,000 reads.
I've never seen this before.
There was nothing controversial about it.
Maybe it was just too popular or something.
But I don't believe that either.
Very strange!!!

Anyway, the translation is something like:

==================================================
An open operating system has not only advantages.

An open operating system can mutate, you know.
With Windows 2000, though, you get all services from one hand.
That saves time and thereby really money.
More information at www.microsoft.com/germany/windows2000
==================================================

The original linuxtoday article commented on the fact that
the word "really" is used instead of "real".

They also commented that the ad is giving credibility to
linux buy saying that linux has lots of advantages.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

-----------------------------------------------------
PS. On the age old controversial subject of name-tags at
linuxSA meetings (please send flames to /dev/null), here's
an age-old name-tag with a penguin on it:

<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/images/photos/tag1.jpg">http://www.topology.org/images/photos/tag1.jpg</A>

This is a high-quality plastic name-tag, originally made
in Western Australia in about 1973/74.
It cost 90c at that time.
Maybe if all name-tags were this nice, then some people
might consent to be recognised by them at meetings.
And here's the back of the tag:
