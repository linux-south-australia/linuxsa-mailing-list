&lt;bold&gt;Subject:&lt;/bold&gt; MS In a landmark decision, the Australian
Commercial Practices Court yesterday ruled that Toyota is no longer
allowed to run its advertising campaign based on the word "bugger". 


Explained Court spokesman Loof Lirpa, ``Some time ago Microsoft took out
an injunction against the use of the word `bugger' in Toyota's ad. It was
argued that `bugger' had been associated with Windows far longer and far
more deeply than with Toyota's utes.'' 


Lirpa went on to suggest that every Windows user in the world uses the
word at least once a day as a direct result of using Windows. ``No other
product has ever achieved that degree of market recognition and for
Toyota to muscle in on it was clearly a breach of commercial etiquette
and, ipso facto, copyright.'' Microsoft is now planning a media-wide
campaign using  their catch-word. 


A copy that has been leaked to us shows several familiar faces: 

&lt;paraindent&gt;&lt;param&gt;left&lt;/param&gt;*  Stephen King is shown saving the last
page of his new 800 page blockbuster in Word and then re-opening it to
find that it has been reduced to three smiley faces and half a dozen
Japanese characters. He smiles wanly to the camera and says ``......'' 

*  Kerry Packer is shown shaking his head knowingly and muttering
``......'' when he discovers that the spreadsheet on which he based his
latest $4 billion takeover has suffered from the notorious Excel `four
times seven equals thirty six' feature and that the Ayer's Rock Pie
Company is somewhat overvalued. 

*  The head of the CIA [face pixillated] is shown shouting ``oh, ......''
on finding that Outlook has just emailed the entire contents of his hard
drive to the head of the KGB. She, in turn, says,  ``byugyah'' when the
file is found to be in last year's Access format. 

&lt;/paraindent&gt;A spokesthing for Microsoft commented, ``This is a logical
move for the company that used  the songs `You make a grown man cry' and
`The damned and accursed are committed to the flames of Hell' as
advertising slogans for its software. We anticipate establishing the
slogan in the marketplace by including a t-shirt with `Microsoft.
Bugger.' in every box of our software.''
