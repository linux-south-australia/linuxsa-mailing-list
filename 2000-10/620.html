Hi,

I'm not that good with tcp/ip, so I don't know if this is even possible.
I am seeking help and advice. Current situation:

    Dual boot PC with NT 4, Redhat 6.1 and a modem, PCa
    2 single boot PCs with NT4, PCb and PCc
    ISDN router
    2 other unix Computers Ca, Cb

PCa, PCb, and PCc are connected via a hub on a class C network (ntwk 1).
The isdn router is also connected to this hub, and routes back to a
different class B network (ntwk 2). So PCa, PCb and PCc talk to each
other and thru the isdn router.
PCa also has a modem, which connects to an isp (dynamic ip), and will
get squid on it so that PCa, PCb and PCc can all access the internet.
PCa is also sometimes connected (by swapping ethernet cable) to another
network on which Ca and Cb are.

network 2                                  Ca---Cb
                                                       | (temporary)
                                                       |
                      PCb        PCc          PCa          ISDN router
-&gt;
network 1        |---------|-----------|---------------|
                                                       |
                                                 modem

I have managed under Linux to get PCa talking to network 1, and network
2 by using IP aliasing. Not a problem. Using netconf, I cannot get it
connect to the class B network on the other side of the isdn router. For
some reason netconf will not add this route to the routing table.

I hope the above is understandable.
The aim is to get PCa, PCb and PCc to talk to each other (they do),
connect thru isdn router (PCb and PCc do, but not PCa), and to internet
via PCa (haven't tried this part yet).
PCa must also be able to talk to Ca and Cb temporarily (it does).

I think my question really is - can PCa do this job as a router, and if
so, what should the routing table look like.

Thanks,
Tom
