Hey All,

Thought I would post a follow up to all the Wireless LAN questions that 
have been floating around the last couple of weeks. I have just got off the 
phone with a Gary Fraser at the ACA in Melbourne.

Basically, if a company wants to set up a WAN between sites, and they ARE 
NOT providing service to the public (any third party), and it is only for 
their internal use, then you DO NOT need to become a carrier. Gary gave me 
an example of if a company has a site in Melbourne and another in Cairns, 
they could legally run a cable between the two sites and not have to become 
a carrier. (I would think there would be other requirements though... such 
as council permission, etc, etc). His point was that from a carrier point 
of view, you only need to become a carrier if you are providing a service 
to third parties. The 500M does not apply in the case of a single company 
linking offices that it owns, as long as no third party has access to the 
network.

Hope this clears things up a little :)

Darryl
