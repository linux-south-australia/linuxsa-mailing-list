Hi Russell, 

You're right - my users have particularly lose tongues when it comes to
passwords. It's a good thing they'll never know the root passwd. 
The firewall option won't work in this scenario, as both the users must have
access - the issue is accounting. If they have to log in, we can see who's
doing all the browsing, and charge them back for the service we give them.
Hence the problem - the one user1 user name is getting way more than his
fair share of browsing done on his account. Seems he'll complain about
having to pay the bill but won't shut his trap when it comes to his passwd.
I've explained to him the impliations of giving his passwd away dozens of
times. 

Rgds, 
Kevin

Subject: RE: squid ACL's


&gt; Is it possible to set up a username acl that that user name 
&gt; may only connect
&gt; from a certain IP? I need this because I have some offices 
&gt; (on their own
&gt; subnet) where everyone uses the same user / pass but there 
&gt; are other offices
&gt; on different subnets that should not have access that are 
&gt; connecting using
&gt; the first office's username and passwd. 

Sounds like a people problem more than a technical one :)

but in reality, I know it can be done, but I know not how... you could go
the extreme route and set up a firewall so that http packets are blocked
from the other IP...
