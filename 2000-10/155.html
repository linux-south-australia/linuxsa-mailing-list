Hi,

I am investingating large file systems for Linux. Of the order of 100GB+.

With large file systems comes some big problems, but the main one I have a
problem with is backup. At the moment, it takes about 20m/GB to back up our
file systems, and while we can move to things like DLT stackers, which may
reduce that down to 5-10m/GB, that still means a large backup window is
required.

What I am looking for is file systems that allow you to take a snapshot of
a live file systems, probably with Copy on Write techniques, so we can
backup a snapshot and continue to work on the file system as well.

I have found one solution, LVM, but I am looking for suggestions for others.

Another obvious problem is fsck time. Clearly, we will need a journaling
file system like ReiserFS, or some such, because fsck'ing 100GB is not
going to be quick, even if it is spread across multiple spindles on a
number of RAID controllers ...

Mirroring it is going to be interesting as well.

Regards
