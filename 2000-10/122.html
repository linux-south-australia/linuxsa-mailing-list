James!

&gt; I am currently using a re-compiled 2.2.17 kernel day to day, and the 2.4 is
&gt; 2.4.0test1 or 0.
&gt; All though the kernel is represented as a stable number, is it in fact still
&gt; beta??

I wonder what the test1 and test2 mean....scratches the head....:-P

&gt; I have noticed improved support for processors, PCMCIA and finally.... USB!
&gt; All this was in the stock kernel, no patches to download, but an interesting
&gt; option was found.
&gt;  [Y / m / n ] "extended file system support" IE Ext2! i guess this is to do
&gt; with something else to come, perhaps a patch for ReiserFS or similar.

You won't have any glitches having two kernels on the system provided
you follow the instructions on how to install them (in
/usr/src/kernel-source/README). You may fall foul of programs that think
they're talking to a 2.2.X series kernel when you're running under
2.4.0. Because it's a major number release it is allowed to break some
things. For example, ipchains for a 2.2.X series won't work under 2.4.0
without getting the very latest source (if it exists)...

As the miller told his tale
That a face that at first was ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale....
