&lt;SNIP
&gt;As for the Windows bias you noted, I often get the impression Telstra
&gt;don't want to know about Linux.  The paranoid might conclude that
&gt;Microsoft has indentured them in the usual unholy alliance – sorry
&gt;"strategic partnership" – but there may be other reasons.

Not really so. Most of their automated services actually run on Linux or 
Unix, some of their mail server even do, and they are moving away from 
NTMail last time I heard. I know that quite a few of their servers are 
running sendmail because as a Telstra BPD customer I get regular stats, 
usage stats, and outage reports from telstra. All of these seem to originate 
from SendMail servers leading me to believe that Telstra do infact run some 
Linux/Unix servers or variants

&gt;When I tried to
&gt;get a permanent BigPond connection via my Linux box early this year, it
&gt;was seven weeks of utter frustration trying to get their authentication
&gt;to work. Day after day of phoning BigPond Support and tweaking and
&gt;patching and kernel recompiles...eventually I gave up and went with
&gt;Optus. To whom I connected within 2 minutes from a bog-standard RedHat
&gt;install.

I did not have a problem setting up my connection, or rather the person who 
helped me set it up did not seem to have any problems with it, I just had to 
supply him with the correct information.

&gt;I have since discovered that Telstra have quietly changed something at
&gt;their end so that standard PAP/CHAP authentications actually work
&gt;nowadays. I guess I wasn't the only one who refused to pay their bills?

This is possibly the reason why my connection was made so easily.


&gt;By contrast, I recall one of those BigPond troubleshooting sessions where
&gt;their techie asked me "what version of Windows is your Linux running on?"
&gt;Oh dear....

This is very true with Telstra however some of the Techies are really good 
and are really nice aswell. I had a big problem a while back with BPD and I 
rang them up, got this really nice fella in Perth, after I had explained my 
problem he said to me look I don't know how far this will go but the nature 
of things like this is that you will need to keep following it up. So that 
you can easily follow it up my name is xxxxx I work at Telstra in Perth, 
here is my direct number 12345667, and here is a tracking number for your 
problem xxxxxx, don't hesitate to call me if you have any more problems.

PEOPLE THAT ARE THIS GOOD AT TELSTRA ARE ABOUT AS RARE AS TASMANIAN TIGERS

FYI. My problem was rectified.


One thing that really does bug me with Telstra is that every time I email, 
fax or call them I get a damned call from some stupid quality assurance firm 
or something like that asking me to do a survey about telstra customer 
support. The last time they rang up I said to the guy "You know what the 
most annoying part is?" He said "no, what?" I said "You buggers rining me up 
after every communication ATTEMPT with Telstra, Don't ring me again please" 
I have not had any calls from them since :-)

Regards,
Michael
