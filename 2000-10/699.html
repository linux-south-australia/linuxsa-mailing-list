IIf you are interested in ADSL in your area please go to the following site
and fill in the details <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl/reg_int.cfm.">http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl/reg_int.cfm.</A>  Also
encourage as many people in your area to do the same.

To find out if you can get ADSL go to the following link:

<A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl/ordering/search.cfm">http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl/ordering/search.cfm</A>

It comes up with some interesting results though, If I enter my phone number
it says I can't have it on my service but if I enter the local pizza shops
number - just up the hill from me it say's that Telstra is reviewing the
Greenwith service area, mmm....

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is probably a little off topic but what the heck !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You're all probably sick of those commercials for the "World's Best
&gt; Address"
&gt; &gt; and more recently "Adelaide's Most Pretigious Address", but you should
try
&gt; &gt; living here.  Telstra has somehow managed to perpetuate on of the
biggest
&gt; &gt; joke's on the residents of these beautiful suburbs (considering that
most
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; Telstra's infrastructure in the area has been commissioned since 1994).
&gt; The
&gt; &gt; golden grove development consists of three suburbs, Wynn Vale, Golden
&gt; Grove
&gt; &gt; and Greenwith, within the development there are over 10,000 houses with
&gt; most
&gt; &gt; of the recent development in Greenwith and of course the luxury Spring
&gt; Hill,
&gt; &gt; which is located right on the Golden Grove/Greenwith border (and accross
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; creek from my place).  As far as number of dwellings, Greenwith appears
to
&gt; &gt; be the larger suburb and is still expanding.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now here's the rub - the majority of residents in Greenwith and Spring
&gt; Hill
&gt; &gt; have their phones serviced off the Greenwith AXE RAU, this is an AXE
&gt; Remote
&gt; &gt; Access Unit which is parented off one of the major Adelaide CBD
exchanges.
&gt; &gt; In itself this is not a problem, but Telstra then decided to use RIM's
to
&gt; &gt; provide the phone services to the end user, which means most residents
&gt; &gt; cannot get higher than a 28.8K modem connection and can dream about such
&gt; &gt; things as ADSL and ISDN.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's how it works, the entire development is full of fibre optic
cabling
&gt; &gt; (just dream about the Gigabits of capacity) and this is used to cable
the
&gt; &gt; RIM's to the GWTH RAU.  From each RIM, standard copper twisted pair is
&gt; used
&gt; &gt; for the local loop to each house.  Sound's great doesn't it, lots of
clean
&gt; &gt; digital channels between the RAU and each RIM and then literally metre's
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; new copper cable to each house.  Think again, Telstra decided to use non
&gt; &gt; integrated RIMs which means that the local copper loop is converted to
&gt; &gt; digital at the RIM, the signal is then transmitted through the fibre
optic
&gt; &gt; cable to the RAU where it is converted back to analogue and fed into the
&gt; &gt; standard analogue exchange ports of the RAU.  These two analogue to
&gt; digital
&gt; &gt; conversions are what restricts the modem to a theoretical limit of 31.2K
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; more realisticly 28.8K.  If Telstra had used integrated RIMs then the
RIM
&gt; &gt; would be digitally connected to the RAU, thus eliminating the second A/D
&gt; &gt; conversion and allowing 56K modem operation, also ISDN services would be
&gt; &gt; available right now and ADSL would only require adding new cards to each
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; the RIMs and not changing all the interfacing infrastructure at the RAU
&gt; end.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Back to ADSL, Telstra wasn't planning to provide ADSL to Golden Grove -
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; service was going to stop at the Modbury exchange.  However, according
to
&gt; &gt; their web site, Telstra is now reviewing the provision of ADSL from the
&gt; &gt; Golden Grove exchange.  This will make most residents of Golden Grove
and
&gt; &gt; Wynn Vale happy, but it still leaves the residents of Greenwith and
Spring
&gt; &gt; Hill out in the cold.  Perhaps somebody should inform the investors on
&gt; &gt; Spring Hill who are building their 300K plus mansions of the situation.
&gt; &gt; More to the point, somebody should tell Telstra about the levels of
&gt; &gt; disposable income in the area, income which could be spent on ADSL.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bottom line, perhaps all of us Greenwith residents should consider
&gt; swapping
&gt; &gt; our 56K modems with anybody who has a 28.8K modem to offer and who can
use
&gt; &gt; speeds in excess of 28.8K.  In the meantime I can continue dreaming
about
&gt; &gt; the Gigs of capacity buried behind my back fence, and put up with my
28.8K
&gt; &gt; and Telstra's continual offers to put a Satellite dish on my roof !!!!
&gt; Now
&gt; &gt; don't even get me started with regards to cable services.....  I'll be
&gt; quite
&gt; &gt; happy to switch all my phone services over to any carrier who can plug
me
&gt; &gt; into the digital age !!!!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;
