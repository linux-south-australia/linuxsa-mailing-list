&gt; Hi all.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody had any experience with this package?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like  to install it to allow everyone on my network to monitor the (rough) speed of the my PPP link.  I can get it going OK and can see graphs on my web server.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that with the PPP link, the link is up and down, but MRTG (more importantly, I think SNMP) reports the interface that was PPP0 as ETH0, and tells me that I have two ETH0 devices when the link is down.  This really screws up MRTG.  The other
&gt; problem is that it only reporting one fifth the speed of my link, ie, when i download at 5-6 k/sec (as reported by the firewall packet counters and c-mserver/gmasqdial) I see about 1.2 k/sec in MRTG over that interval.  It does not matter if the link was
&gt; flat-out for the five minutes between calling MRTG.
&gt; 
&gt; Just recently I got some 10k/sec (newsgroup list from my ISP's local server) that took about 5 minutes to get... MRTG reports 2.1 kb/sec.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone help me with MRTG or suggest another package that may be a better option?
&gt; 

If you'd like to see a what we're monitoring with MRTG, check out the
