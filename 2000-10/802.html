Hi,

&gt; Unfortunately, this ment that squid was open to requests from the
&gt; outside, which is exactly what has happened.  
&gt; 
&gt; * The Question: Why?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand why people would do this, unless it gave them
&gt; access to something they didn't have (eg. porn, which may be the case)
&gt; or acted as an anonomiser.. we have the squid logs and hence a list of
&gt; IP addresses. 

Squid has config options to limit the access to it from a variety of IP
ranges or domains. I suggest reading the very informative Squid web site
documentation. I've found it to be quite complete and informative.

&gt; Option 1:
&gt; 
&gt; Not knowing how exactly how squid cache's work (regarding expiration)
&gt; could it be possible that there is material that no longer exists on
&gt; any particular website, but that migrates between caches?

If you are peering with other Caches, I've seen some confusion occur on
occasions which means that squid thinks another cache holds a document,
and will try and serve it, or another cache does hold a document and
serves it instead of the most recent copy. It all depends upon the config
of the caches, and what the expire time is set to. In the case of a single
cache this shouldn't happen.
