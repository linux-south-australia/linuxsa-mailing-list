Reginald...

The "test9" in "2.4.0-test9" means that this kernel is not yet ready for
mass consumption. It's close, but you should expect problems. It's there for
people who are experienced with building kernels and are interested in
debugging broken kernels, so that they can try it, break it, and help fix
it. A common saying regarding development (2.&lt;odd number&gt;.x), -pre and -test
kernels is that if you don't already know how to get it, compile and install
it without help, then it's not for you. This is because those kernels are
still in the development and testing stages, and pretty much anything could
go wrong. To build, install and run one of these kernels, you really need to
be able to tell when something is actually broken, and when you are doing
something wrong, because often, something actually is broken. Try compiling
a stable kernel (2.&lt;even number&gt;.x) first, and see how you go. I think the
currest stable kernel is 2.2.17, but don't quote me on that.

As it turns out, your main problem here was capitalisation (zImage, not
zimage), and if you correct that, you will probably have no other problems
(it is, after all, a test9, and should theoretically be close to stable).
However, it's recommended that unless you know how to recover when it all
goes pear-shaped, and nothing works, that you keep away from dev, pre and
test kernels.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I'm new to Linux and thought I'd have a go at compiling the 
&gt;2.4 kernel every
&gt;thing goes well until I try to  compile it as suggested in the 
&gt;APC linux
&gt;pocket book for linux 6.1.(althought I'm running Linux 6.1).I 
&gt;t says make
&gt;zimage but my machine comes back with a statement :-
&gt;
&gt;No Rule to make target 'zimage'
&gt;
&gt;so I just typed make and the machine carried out a procedure 
&gt;which I suppose
&gt;was compiling the kernel.
&gt;
&gt;The book said copy zimage to the boot directory from the
&gt;usr/src/linux/arc/1386/boot directory but of course zimage 
&gt;wasn't there but a
&gt;file vmlinux was. I copied this new file to the boot directory 
&gt;and re wrote
&gt;the lilo.conf file.
&gt;
&gt;however when I ran lilo at the terminal prompt I received the 
&gt;message  Kernel
&gt;/boot/vmlinux is too big.
&gt;
&gt;Can any of you Gals/Guys help firstly with the make zimage problem
&gt;
&gt;and or secondly how do I over come the vmlinux to big problem.
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Wow,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a RedHat 6.2 system works OK with Linux 2.4.0-test9.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now gotta figure out how to have those device modules load 
&gt;automatically.
