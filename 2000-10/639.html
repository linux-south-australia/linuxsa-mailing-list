&gt; Hi Daryl,
&gt; 
&gt; I changed the DNS IP's last night to the correct ones and it worked a treat.
&gt; Thanks very much for your time and help on this one.

I think you're confusing me with the other Darryl ("my brother Daryl
and my other brother Daryl").  He's the helpful one.  :-)

&gt; I guess it was a simple solution in the end, but I would have thought that
&gt; the DNS would be published correctly on their webpage, especially since I
&gt; have had the same incorrect DNS IP's in my Win98 dialup config for 3 years
&gt; and never had a problem.

You've had Win98 for 3 years?  Seriously, those pages have only been up
for around 6 months; they _used_ to be correct.  And you may have had
your DNS settings overriden by the ones provided by the dialin server
during dialin negotiation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ping gives 100% packet loss.

&gt;&gt; That should be telling you something straight off the bat.

My point here is that ICMP reply is disabled on those servers.
You will never be able to ping them.
