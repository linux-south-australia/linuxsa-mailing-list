&gt; I was under the impression that the http upload facility was just

&gt; 
&gt; For the record, I've had an Apache server set up with DAV, PHP,
&gt; Postgresql and also a couple of others things like Zope and
&gt; mod_auth_pam fine. That was all using DSOs. I've also had an
&gt; Apache server running with SSL, PHP and MySQL, although I had
&gt; problems running PHP as a DSO, and eventually gave up and
&gt; compiled the thing into Apache.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that most of those are fairly well behaved. Not sure
&gt; about FP extensions, though.


Don't think FP extensions are completely covered by WebDAV. Frontpage
needs 'em for more than just uploading files (apparently). The whole
thing's a joke really. In response to Richard Sharpe, we run Samba here,
but we can only use FP98, because FP2000 requires us to use the
extensions. We tried and literally could not create a "web" on the same
share that we did with FP98 (ie, not a permissions thing). Web Guy's now
trying to purchase Dreamweaver, which is apparently a lot better and
play well with others.
