David!

&gt; &gt; then need to specify one of the redundant superblocks as a param to fsck,
&gt; &gt; something which I guess is hard to script (since the first redundant
superblock
&gt; &gt; may also be stuffed etc), and hence why the login script encourages fsck be
run
&gt; &gt; manually.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally it's relatively easy to "guess" where the superblocks are - if
&gt; you were to record where they were you could simply script in all (or a
&gt; representative number depending on how many backups there are) the
&gt; redundant ones as well...

Sure, superblocks are every 8k by default on ext2 (I think).  You could iterate
I guess, but if my filesystem is that stuffed I'd still prefer to be consciously
aware that there is a serious problem, and that it's about time I made another
backup, just in case :-)

I think there's too many things that can go wrong to be scripted.  You don't
want to pipe 'yes' to fsck.
