Have you tried pinging, traceorouting and nslookuping.

You haven't really said whjat you have tried if anything or really defined
the prioblem very clearly.

Does "getting to" sites mean emailing them, viewing their web sites, or
something else?

Can you nslookup(if nslookup doesn't work there are some webased ones- but
I don't know a url off the top of my head) them and then ping the
addresses?

Here is the adaptec IP:
Name:    www.adaptec.com
Address:  167.216.194.193

We need to identify these sorts of things so we can idnetify where your
problem lies.

Pretty much whenver you avhe a network reachability problem the first
thing to do is ping, traceroute and nslookup.

If you cant' see the problem  yourself then I suggest you paste the
results into and email to whoever you ask for help.

&gt; This about the best place I could think of to ask my question. (now
&gt; for the soft soap job) I have found some of the most knowledgable *NIX
&gt; people on this list bar none! So here goes with the quandry...
&gt; 
&gt; I am running FreeBSD 4.0 on my main server for my LAN connected to the
&gt; net via ADSL. I have PPPoE working just fine with a second tunnel to
&gt; another server which furnishes my static IP and is my mail handler. Up
&gt; until 20 days ago ALL was working very well and my speeds were very
&gt; respectable. At present, this is where it gets juicy, I am having a
&gt; problem getting to several sites. This doesn't happen to all site, but
&gt; to just a select few. eg - www.buy.com , www.adaptec.com ,
&gt; www.surplusauction.com and a few others... I can get to most any site,
&gt; but these are the problem ones plus a few others. I have not added
&gt; anything to the server since the orginal install except Webmin and
&gt; haven't changed any of the config files. I can get to these sites
&gt; using lynx on the server! NONE of the machines on my LAN can make it
&gt; to these sites either. Presently I am using NAT and have the server
&gt; wide open to the world! (Don't get any ideas guys! Give me time to
&gt; lock it down.) Does anyone have ANY ideas of what may be going on
&gt; here? I would be glad to give more info off the list if it is needed.
&gt; I have never seen anything like this happen to any server I have
&gt; worked on in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; In desparate need of help!
