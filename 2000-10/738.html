Thanks Jonathon,

&gt; I have not tried to read mail with the Accompli but to access 
&gt; a mail server
&gt; via WAP the mail server needs to be "WAP enabled".  That is 

hmmm... do WAP enabled mail servers exist for Linux?

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; At present WAP is accessed via a data call. This means you 
&gt; want to be rich
&gt; or be using the phone for business to afford the bills.  GPRS 
&gt; should be
&gt; coming out soon (both Telstra and Optus are working on 
&gt; rolling out their
&gt; networks).  It is a packet switched network that should only 
&gt; charge for the
&gt; data sent/recieved and hopefully this will be cheaper.

ok, cool -- hanging out for that then...


&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; This depends on who you get your phone service through.  
&gt; Optus operate a
&gt; "walled garden" basically means it is an isolated private 
&gt; network.  i.e.
&gt; you cant get to an internet mail server.  Telstra do not have a walled
&gt; garden.
&gt; Also since WAP is accessed via a data call what companies do to access
&gt; their mail servers it to setup their own RAS.  They dial into that and
&gt; access their mail server via their own WAP gateway.

so either way, you're paying for a call every time you connect... until GPRS
or some similar technology become available...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; No you can't download to the Accompli.

that's not very useful then :)

Spose it depends what you wnat on it -- I'd want a password encryting thing
so I can store all the passwords I can't remember...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; used a Palm I did not like it.  The concept of a PDA/phone 
&gt; combination is
&gt; great but I would wait for a phone that really had a Palm PDA in it.

yeah

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Personally I would get a Palm and a phone with a data 
&gt; connection.  This way
&gt; you get a decent screen and data entry.  The Palm has or you 
&gt; can get lots
&gt; of software to connect to all types of mailservers so 
&gt; compatibility is not
&gt; an issue. I have used a Palm and a phone together for web/WAP 
&gt; surfing (via
&gt; a Linux RAS) and it works quite well.

Personally, what I want is a phone-sized (or a big phone -- like an
Accompli) think with a mini-palm pilot in it, preferably with GPRS access to
the internet, and the ability to do things like ssh, ping, etc...

don't ask much, do I? :)
