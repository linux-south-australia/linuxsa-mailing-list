&gt;&gt; I know RedHat ship a Makefile

&gt; Close - there is a Makefile as you say, but as far as I know it
&gt; is not initiated nightly.

Ah well, 'twas only a guess on my part.  My mailserver doesn't get
rebooted often enough for me to be too concerned about it.

&gt; The culprit is more likely to be the
&gt; following from /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail:
&gt; 
&gt;     for i in virtusertable access domaintable mailertable ; do
&gt;       if [ -f /etc/mail/$i ] ; then
&gt;         makemap hash /etc/mail/$i &lt; /etc/mail/$i
&gt;       fi
&gt;    done

Looks like it's been in there since RedHat 6.0.

&gt; I suppose it's a balancing act, with so many RedHat
&gt; users being relatively inexperienced.

Young whipper snappers today wouldn't know a PDP-11 if it
fell on them[1].
