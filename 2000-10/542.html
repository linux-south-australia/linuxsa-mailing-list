Quoting <A HREF="mailto:michaeld@senet.com.au">michaeld@senet.com.au</A>:

&gt; So, for the Samba-enlightened members of the list, what's the deal with the
&gt; Samba code fork?  Is it simply a matter of the timetable for full Win2Crap
&gt; PDC
&gt; functionality?  Or is it more to do with personalities of developers?

Samba TNG will was never destined to become Samba. Some stuff will be merged into Samba though.
Samba TNG will now become a set of DCE/RPC libs (similar to Richard Sharpes smblib, except
actively maintained ;-)).

&gt;
&gt; Which side of the fork will LinuxSA samba-ites RD and DS (+ others?)
&gt; develop
&gt; on?

Both. They do different things. When we wrote the docs for Samba TNG, it was mainly for testers
(and the impatient) to get PDC functionality working "better". So, when every slashdot reader
followed the link on the samba-tng page, they read the *old* docs and assumed that it was Samba
vs Samba TNG. This is incorrect. They will both benefit from each other.

&gt; When was the last significant code fork in the open-source world
&gt; (forgetting
&gt; [X]emacs and egcs/gcc)?

This is different. They do different things. I can't remember whether it was Jeremy, Gerald or
both who posted to slashdot telling everyone that it wasn't really a fork as such. The two do
different things (getting the picture ;-)).

Hope it helps,
Matt

P.S. If anyone if after more up to date info, the lists (at lists.samba-tng.org) have been
operational for a couple of days now. Sander Striker is getting together some info and will be
posting to the lists (hopefully shortly).
