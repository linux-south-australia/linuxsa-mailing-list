David,

You could use Packeteer:
<A HREF="http://www.packeteer.com/products/index.cfm">http://www.packeteer.com/products/index.cfm</A>

Or Fort Knox:
<A HREF="http://rogets.ind.alcatel.com/enterprise/products/id/proseries.html">http://rogets.ind.alcatel.com/enterprise/products/id/proseries.html</A>

Or the Xedia:
<A HREF="http://www.xedia.com/">http://www.xedia.com/</A>
-- which has been so thoroghly absorbed into Lucent that I just
can't find it on their website.
Maybe it's this:
<A HREF="http://www.lucent.com/ins/products/accesspoint/ap450.html">http://www.lucent.com/ins/products/accesspoint/ap450.html</A>

There's also the CheckPoint software:
<A HREF="http://www.checkpoint.com/">http://www.checkpoint.com/</A>
which runs on Solaris and NT.
They offer the Floodgate software:
<A HREF="http://www.checkpoint.com/products/floodgate-1/index.html">http://www.checkpoint.com/products/floodgate-1/index.html</A>

The prices of these sorts of customer premises shapers
are in the range US$2800 to US$28,000, according to
the November 1998 edition of "Data Communications".

It's clear to me that all of this could be done for free
in the linux kernel.
But I don't know what shaper projects are running right now
for linux.
Such software would be a natural extension to packet filtering.
Filtering by volume rather than just by things like
IP addresses and port numbers would be a logical extension.
And then the high-price dedicated hardware product market
would collapse.
Linux could take over the shaper market in addition to the
server and desktop markets.
And this would not be that difficult.
I bet it's been done already!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
