Paul!

&gt; * The Question: Why?
 
&gt; I don't understand why people would do this, unless it gave them
&gt; access to something they didn't have (eg. porn, which may be the case)
&gt; or acted as an anonomiser.. we have the squid logs and hence a list of
&gt; IP addresses.

Why don't you reverse looku some of the IP addresses? You could report
it to AusCert. At a guess:

* they're accessing something they can't; or
* they're using your bandwidth and not theirs; or
* they're up to something else and this is just a symptom

&gt; Option 1:

&gt; Not knowing how exactly how squid cache's work (regarding expiration)
&gt; could it be possible that there is material that no longer exists on
&gt; any particular website, but that migrates between caches?

I didn't think things "migrated" between squid caches unless they were
asked for. There are some HTML headers (meta headers if I remember) that
direct a browers or cache to reload pages, but you could point your
browser at some of the pages to see what the pages actually contain.

&gt; Option 2:
&gt; 
&gt; Is this is a method for bypassing censorship software?

Yes, it can be. If your work/university doesn't allow you to see the
whole 'net but does allow you to speak to any proxy server, then I can
use your proxy server to get what work/university's proxy server for me.
Not that I have :-)

&gt; Option 3:

&gt; There is some benefit/fun/credos in making others suffer unnecessary
&gt; traffic? (I could point my finder at the ISP here, but they have been
&gt; reasonably helpful in the past.)

I assume that finder = finger. If your ISP has been hacked, or if it
were them then I would be inclined to say it is at least breach of
contract but probably also falls foul of one of the greater
telecommunication acts as well. Presuming that the ISP is innocent -
which on balance of probabilities they probably are - then one can only
say that "cracking" is fun to some just as murder, robbing, stealing,
rape etc etc is fun to others.
