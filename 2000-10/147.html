Hi Jason. I will elaborate within your response...

&gt; 
&gt; Have you tried pinging, traceorouting and nslookuping.
Yes, I have tried all of these. I can surf to just about any site
except for a select few. I can ping, do a traceroute and nslookup on
any site including the ones that I can not get to come up.

&gt; 
&gt; You haven't really said whjat you have tried if anything or really defined
&gt; the prioblem very clearly.
&gt; 
&gt; Does "getting to" sites mean emailing them, viewing their web sites, or
&gt; something else?
It means viewing their web page(s)...

&gt; 
&gt; Can you nslookup(if nslookup doesn't work there are some webased ones- but
&gt; I don't know a url off the top of my head) them and then ping the
&gt; addresses?
NSLOOKUP works on ALL the machines on the LAN for any site on the
internet and intranet. I can ping any site on the internet and
intranet too...

&gt; 
&gt; Here is the adaptec IP:
&gt; Name:    www.adaptec.com
&gt; Address:  167.216.194.193
&gt; 
&gt; We need to identify these sorts of things so we can idnetify where your
&gt; problem lies.
For 20 days now I have looked over all the config files and found
nothing that has changed. I could be missing something by just jumping
over it time after time though.

&gt; 
&gt; Pretty much whenver you avhe a network reachability problem the first
&gt; thing to do is ping, traceroute and nslookup.
This was the first things I had done from several of the machines on
the LAN. The other machines are WinSnore 95, 98 and 2K... They ALL
worked as expected, lousy with perfect results from each site I looked
up, pinged and traced.

&gt; 
&gt; If you cant' see the problem  yourself then I suggest you paste the
&gt; results into and email to whoever you ask for help.
What results would you have me paste into the request? I can only
describe to you what isn't happening in the browsers. Most of the
tests via the browsers, IE and Netscape, has been done on a Win2K
machine. I have a network indicator showing in the systray that does
next to nothing when I try to bring up these sites. When I got to let
say www.google.com the indicator goes crazy along with most any other
site I go to look over. The Netscape browser states at the bottom that
the site has been contacted and is waiting for a reply OR it states it
is fetching data. I can not explain that any clearer than that.
Nothing happens past that point other than it times out.

&gt; 
&gt; Jason
Thanks for your response Jason. Any and all is appreciated!
Frank

&gt; &gt; This about the best place I could think of to ask my question. (now
&gt; &gt; for the soft soap job) I have found some of the most knowledgable *NIX
&gt; &gt; people on this list bar none! So here goes with the quandry...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am running FreeBSD 4.0 on my main server for my LAN connected to the
&gt; &gt; net via ADSL. I have PPPoE working just fine with a second tunnel to
&gt; &gt; another server which furnishes my static IP and is my mail handler. Up
&gt; &gt; until 20 days ago ALL was working very well and my speeds were very
&gt; &gt; respectable. At present, this is where it gets juicy, I am having a
&gt; &gt; problem getting to several sites. This doesn't happen to all site, but
&gt; &gt; to just a select few. eg - www.buy.com , www.adaptec.com ,
&gt; &gt; www.surplusauction.com and a few others... I can get to most any site,
&gt; &gt; but these are the problem ones plus a few others. I have not added
&gt; &gt; anything to the server since the orginal install except Webmin and
&gt; &gt; haven't changed any of the config files. I can get to these sites
&gt; &gt; using lynx on the server! NONE of the machines on my LAN can make it
&gt; &gt; to these sites either. Presently I am using NAT and have the server
&gt; &gt; wide open to the world! (Don't get any ideas guys! Give me time to
&gt; &gt; lock it down.) Does anyone have ANY ideas of what may be going on
&gt; &gt; here? I would be glad to give more info off the list if it is needed.
&gt; &gt; I have never seen anything like this happen to any server I have
&gt; &gt; worked on in the past.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In desparate need of help!
