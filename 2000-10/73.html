&gt;Hey All,
&gt;
&gt;Thought I would post a follow up to all the Wireless LAN questions that 
&gt;have been floating around the last couple of weeks. I have just got off the 
&gt;phone with a Gary Fraser at the ACA in Melbourne.
&gt;
&gt;Basically, if a company wants to set up a WAN between sites, and they ARE 
&gt;NOT providing service to the public (any third party), and it is only for 
&gt;their internal use, then you DO NOT need to become a carrier. Gary gave me 
&gt;an example of if a company has a site in Melbourne and another in Cairns, 
&gt;they could legally run a cable between the two sites and not have to become 
&gt;a carrier. (I would think there would be other requirements though... such 
&gt;as council permission, etc, etc). His point was that from a carrier point 
&gt;of view, you only need to become a carrier if you are providing a service 
&gt;to third parties. The 500M does not apply in the case of a single company 
&gt;linking offices that it owns, as long as no third party has access to the 
&gt;network.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this clears things up a little :)

Hmmm, what is the definition of a third party? Is an employee who dials up
from home and uses the network for personal purposes, and the company pays
FBT, does that employee become a third-party for carrier purposes?
