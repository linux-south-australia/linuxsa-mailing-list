&gt; I acknowledge that this thread is stale by a couple of weeks, but as
&gt; I'm only just catching up I thought I might see if a few facts could
&gt; add life to this old story.
&gt;
&gt; We were the second in Adelaide to get ADSL behind Daryl.  Ironic,
&gt; really, that the first two installations of a service that is geared
&gt; toward single Windows PC systems are both installed on Linux-based
&gt; networks.  Incidentally, we don't have the same drop-out problems that
&gt; Darryl has reported, other than a couple of unexplained failures and
&gt; one where Telstra's end broke.

As a followup, I changed network cards in the server last Monday, and guess 
when it's been up since :P

What I don't understand though, is that resetting the modem made it 
reconnect... You'd think if it was a problem with the network card in the 
computer then resetting the modem wouldn't fix it...

&gt; Most importantly from my point of view, they will not provide a static
&gt; IP so that we can run our mail and web services over the ADSL line.  I
&gt; don't know of any technical reason why this should be the case - I'd
&gt; be interested if anyone out there knows of one.
&gt;
&gt; So far I haven't got an answer from them to say for sure if they ever
&gt; will provide static IP.

Nothing to stop you using something like DynDNS.ORG or something along 
those lines :)
