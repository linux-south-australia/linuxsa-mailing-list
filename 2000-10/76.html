It appears fetchmail generated the message.  It isn't documented
in the man pages, so I don't know under what circumstances it does
this without peering at the source.  I'd suspect that it's unable
to determine who you are, though (probably uid() to name mapping).

&gt; So am I right that these things look suspicious?  Or is there some
&gt; other explanation.

Well, I don't know about suspicious; something is odd though.  I used
to have a problem with X authentication; if my X server had been left
running for several days, I was unable to start any new sessions due
to auth errors.  Not even sure if this is related; just thought I'd
mention it in passing.

&gt; What kinds of things should I look for as evidence for being cracked?
&gt; Log files I presume would be a good place to start, but which ones?

All of them.  You can't presume that none of them haven't been modified.
