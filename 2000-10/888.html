&gt; Im racking my brain with ideas on how i can create the hardware required to

I'm not so sure about the illegality that some people
are proposing for this.
I think the rules have relaxed a bit.
For instance, someone told me that a few years ago,
universities in Melbourne were renting properties spaced by
a bit less than 500 metres because there was some law saying
that private people could lay their own fiber up to 500 metres
without going through Telstra.

There's also such a thing as a 150 MHz band which you can
do what you like with as long as the range is less than
a kilometre or something like that.
The amateur radio people would know all about this.
(There's also a free band around about 2.5 GHZ maybe.
or you can use a wireless lan up to a few tens of metres.)
So I think you can get some basic radio gear to go across the
street, and connect up to this link with an IP stack
using the BSD-style tunnel driver software.
(I've done this myself in other bands.)
Or you could use PPP.

The best people to contact are the hams.
There's a linux-hams mailing list, which I dropped out of
lately because it was too voluminous.
This info might be out-of-date, but
"Steve Fraser" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sfraser@sierra.apana.org.au">sfraser@sierra.apana.org.au</A>&gt;
used to know all about this sort of thing.
The hams tend to use AX.25.
But that's for networking.
If you want point-to-point, you don't need AX.25.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
