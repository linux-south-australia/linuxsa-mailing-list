Hi guys

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; original question).  I do advise people strongly against using
&gt; FP as anything more than a simple formatted text editor, and
&gt; to keep away from the widgets, but the upload facility seems
&gt; to be something they are comfortable with - I've given up on
&gt; trying to educate people who don't want to listen.

I was under the impression that the http upload facility was just
WebDAV. Can anyone confirm or deny this? If that's so, just check
out <A HREF="http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/">http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/</A> to install it on Apache.

For the record, I've had an Apache server set up with DAV, PHP,
Postgresql and also a couple of others things like Zope and 
mod_auth_pam fine. That was all using DSOs. I've also had an
Apache server running with SSL, PHP and MySQL, although I had
problems running PHP as a DSO, and eventually gave up and
compiled the thing into Apache.

I think that most of those are fairly well behaved. Not sure 
about FP extensions, though.

Cheers

Tom
