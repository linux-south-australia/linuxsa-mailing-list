I probably didn't explain some things very well.  My brother has
actually successfully run the e-Tax software on linux using wine, so I
know it can be done.  What I am having problems with is not the actual
software, but downloading it in the first place.  For some reason
Netscape won't do it, complaining:

  The security library has experienced an error.
  You will probably be unable to connect to this site securely.

I am using Netscape 4.73.  Probably my brother used an earlier version
of Netscape, but I wouldn't have thought this would be the problem.
Obviously my brother managed to download it okay, so it can be done.
I would ask him about it except he got married on the weekend and is
on his honeymoon!

Cheers,

Mark.

&gt; It did not let me connect to the site at all.  Does anyone know what
&gt; this problem might be?  Has anyone else used wine successfully to do
&gt; their tax?
