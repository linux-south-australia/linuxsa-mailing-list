&gt;Hello Robyn,
&gt;
&gt;Congratulations in deciding to learn the greatest
&gt;language in existence, you have a good procedural
&gt;background which will really help you. But in saying
&gt;that C is very different in a lot of ways so I suggest
&gt;you find a work book and not a text book to begin
&gt;with. 

Well, actually programming some things will probably be just as good :-)

&gt;A work book has exercises with answers for you to do, 
&gt;whereas a text book explains syntax and functions and
&gt;is useful as a reference book but not much else.
&gt;'Kerningham and Richie' is a good example of a text
&gt;book. While it may seem silly to go through the basics
&gt;when you already know programming it really will help
&gt;Especially when you get into pointers and then lists.

Ummm, I would have thought that lists were fundamentally related to
pointers, and that in any case, that dynamic allocation techniques are
similar in most languages. For example, I can see little difference between
dynamic allocation in Pascal, Simula 67 and C, although I must admit that I
have not programmed in Pascal or Simula 67 for a long time.

However, the biggest thing to get your mind around in C is the similarity
between pointers and arrays ... IMO

&gt;In short buy 'Thinking in C' and stay well away from
&gt;SAMS ie. teach yourself in 12 minutes, (That's no joke
&gt;they actually have that book.)

Probably almost any book would do if supplemented with healthy doses of
real programming, but real programming involves quite a lot these days, and
looking at the source code for almost any open source software today will
almost overwhelm the beginner, again IMO.  This is because they are full of
#ifdefs that work their way around the differences between different
versions of UNIX and different architectures ... 

&gt;Linux is written in C, in fact there are reports that
&gt;C was originally written to write Unix.

See, for example, <A HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html</A>

&gt;                                        So you already
&gt;have the tools to write and compile programs however
&gt;Makefiles are hard to learn and understand. So I
&gt;suggest you give WPE/XWPE a go. It's a borland style
&gt;IDE which uses the old ncurses library (ie text mode).
&gt;Or if you like the Windows GUI style try KDevelop.
&gt;KDevelop is a MS Visual C clone with a real nice
&gt;debugger and just nice all-round IDE. Both write
&gt;makefiles for you and let you learn C instead. 
&gt;
&gt;And have fun *8)
