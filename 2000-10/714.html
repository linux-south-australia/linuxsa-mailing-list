<H1>ReiserFS option on Mandrake</H1>

Just thought Id pass this on.
During the rain storm that went through Adelaide a few days ago my server
basically died with errors upon rebooting from a couple of rapid power outages.
I reckon I had 3 power outs within 10 secs.
The server was had ext2 as the file system as its been up for about a year and I
only shut it down to put in a larger drive.

My two other machines use the ReiserFS and although they went down too,
both came up with not a complaint.  I was impressed.

I installed RH 7.0 tonight to check it out and it did not appear to have
ReiserFS as an option during install does anyone know it it has it somewhere?

Linuxtoday indicated that ReiserFS will make it into 2.4.1, looks like its
impressing others too.
