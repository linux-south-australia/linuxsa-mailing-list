Just wanted to say, I've got around my problems.  I managed to get lilo to
work from an old linux installed disk, and now my new drive, located at
/dev/hdc, boots okay.

I still don't know why the new drives partition table is unrecognized when
made the first drive.  I would be interested if anyone had ideas on what
the problem is here.  But this is now more for curiosities sake than
anything --- the main thing is that I now have a working linux box again!

Cheers,

Mark.

&gt; My computer is currently in an unusable state.  I am borrowing my Dad's
&gt; computer to write this!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The story in summary form:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Purchased a new 15Gig IBM ATA/100 hard drive.  Hooked it up as
&gt; 1st drive.  BIOS detects okay.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. fdisk complains that there is no known partition table on it.  I get
&gt; fdisk to create one, as well as partitions, and write to disk.  All is
&gt; well again.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Many trials and tribulations later I get Debian Linux successfully
&gt; installed on new drive.  Created boot floppy for it which successfully
&gt; booted it several times.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. I actually wanted the new drive as the third disk, so I swapped disks
&gt; and cables around.  Got BIOS to re-detect the drives, which it did okay.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Used Debian rescue disk to boot.  I hoped to use the rescue disk to
&gt; run lilo from in order to make the new drive bootable again.  But lilo
&gt; failed.  The rescue disk seems to use the lilo executable on the IBM
&gt; drive, and this failed.  It gave the error message:
&gt;   /target/sbin/lilo: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: version `GLIBC_2.2' 
&gt;   not found (required by /target/lib/libc.so.6)
&gt; I'm not sure what the problem is here.  It could be because on the IBM
&gt; drive installation (/target) I upgraded a few packages to woody.  I could
&gt; be because /target did not have mounted /usr or /var (and I can't mount
&gt; them without the 2.4 kernel).  Anyway, whatever the reason, I can't get
&gt; lilo to work so I can't boot the partition.  I can't even use a
&gt; commandline option to boot from the rescue disk with /dev/hdc1 as root,
&gt; because again, I need my custom 2.4 kernel so I can get LVM and ReiserFS
&gt; stuff so that /usr and /var will be mounted.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. I swapped cables around so that my new IBM drive became the first drive
&gt; again, and got the BIOS to re-detect the disks.  This way I hoped to use
&gt; my custom boot disk for booting the new drive, which I created when it was
&gt; /dev/hda.  The kernel started booting okay with this, but it couldn't find
&gt; a partition table on the IBM drive!  "Unknown partition table" the kernel
&gt; complained.  This is the same problem it had at the very beginning of this
&gt; story.  I am not about to use fdisk to recreate a partition table and wipe
&gt; my disk.
&gt; 
&gt; 7.  I swapped the cables over again a few times and it seems the partition
&gt; table is readable when I make the new drive /dev/hdc but unreadable when I
&gt; make it  /dev/hda.
&gt; 
&gt; So that it the current state of play.  I can't think what the problem is
&gt; with the partition table being unreadable.  I suspect it might be some
&gt; problem with the motherboard.  In which case the best thing to do is to
&gt; stick with /dev/hdc.  But how can I get it bootable as this?  How can I
&gt; get a lilo which will work and set up the boot sector properly?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Mark.
