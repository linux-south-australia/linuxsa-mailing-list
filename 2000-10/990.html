What *would* be funny (except to those of us who take conspiracy
theories seriously) is if it was all a ploy. If Microsoft were not
really hacked, but gave the source to some cyber-blabbermouth (the use
of 'cyber', I'm getting more and more buzzword compliant), who claims he
or she stole the source (which may or may not be real) in an attempt to
bait the open source community into using the source, hence giving
Microsoft some way of tarnishing the community and/or taking legal
action against all penguins....

Then again, they could just be stupid.
