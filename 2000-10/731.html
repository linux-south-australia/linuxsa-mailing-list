&gt; late/16 should get you there, after a few more clicks...) It seems to be a
&gt; PDA and mobile phone rolled into one, and allows you to interact with your
&gt; MS Exchange inbox live... Wondering if anyone know a great deal about it, or
&gt; similar technologies...
&gt; 
&gt; specifically:
&gt; 
&gt; Does it work with a real mail server? (it uses WAP, but I don't know enough
&gt; to know whether this means you can interact with any generic mail server or
&gt; not)
&gt; Does mail access cost you (ie are you dialing somewhere, or is it an
&gt; always-on free or realistically cheap service?)
&gt; Do I need to do anything specific to my mail server, or does it just need to
&gt; be accessible on the net?
&gt; Does the PDA part of the device have the capability to be programmed (ie if
&gt; I don't like the apps on there, or I want another app, can I d/l it from
&gt; somewhere, like you can with palms?)
&gt; How close to Palm is the PDA? Being a Motorola Phone, and Motorola having an
&gt; equity interest in palm, and having recently announced collaboration on a
&gt; Palm PDA/phone, and Palms running on the Motorola Dragonball 68k processor,
&gt; this could be likely... I do doubt that it's PalmOS though -- they'd make a
&gt; point out of it if it was...
&gt; 

I'm no expert, but my Nokia 7110 has the whole WAP thing and I am pretty
sure that you could set up your own mail client. Dymocks had a book on
doing WAP stuff. It looked fairly simple.

I believe it's a pay-for-what-you-use thing, but there's no guarantee
that that makes it any good ;-). Check it out with your network
provider. What would be interesting is if WAP is secure, you could
organise some kind of WAP interface to say, webmin, and you wouldn't
even need to use your laptop to administer your favourite servers from a
beach/bar/gutter somewhere.
