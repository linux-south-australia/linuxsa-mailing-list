&gt; Another disadvantage of ADSL is that it won't be available outside the
&gt; major cities anytime soon.

I've been in negotiation with all the national ADSL suppliers, and this
appears to be the case.  The problem is that competitive bandwidth is
only possible within 3Km of the exchange, and not too many people live
within 3Km of an exchange in a rural area.

This is a fact of life, and bitching about it can't solve the technical
issues.  Rural users should be pushing for the replacement of the twisted
pair customer access network with a fibre network.  It's the only way
they'll ever get good bandwidth and latency, even then the costs will
be higher (as terminating fiber costs more than terminating copper).

&gt; Furthermore, ADSL will not be made available in areas where cable TV
&gt; and the like already exist.

Not so.  Connecting an ADSL customer costs less than connecting a
cable customer, so the existing cable telcos are interesting in
deploying ADSL into those areas.

Note that their was not really a cable rollout into the CBD (as
there are usually no power poles), so to some extent the two services
are complementary.

&gt; Neither ADSL or cable are/will be available where I live & work for at
&gt; least two years, and the last time I enquired about ISDN for my business
&gt; it was going to cost ~$11000 to install. Not to mention the ongoing costs
&gt; of ISDN. So it looks like my modems will be sending data out to the world
&gt; for a while yet.

You have confused primary rate ISDN (30 * 64Kbps = 2Mbps) with basic rate ISDN
(2 * 64Kbps).  Your quote is about right for a primary rate ISDN service.

&gt; As for the Windows bias you noted, I often get the impression Telstra
&gt; don't want to know about Linux.

Telstra has the "engineering" / "marketing" split common to all technology
firms.  Telstra's engineering people are more than aware of Linux.  The
marketing people don't have a clue what Linux is.

At present, the engineering staff at all the telcos are closely overseeing
the ADSL rollout.  This is partly because ADSL is a tempermental technology,
and partly because the marketing people were responsible for the cable disaster.
So at the moment you're often speaking to people that are running ADSL to their
home Linux PC.  This will change as ADSL gets bedded in.

Your good experience at Optus is because their ADSL subsidiary,
XYZed, isn't seen as strategic and thus hasn't been colonised
by the clueless yet.  It's still basically an engineering exercise,
the financial risks are too great to have attracted the clueless
marketdroids.
