Hi Richard,

&gt; &gt;  ether host 12:34:56:78:09:AB
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;doesn't seem to work.  Can I capture based on MAC rather than
&gt; &gt;IP address?
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, I just tried it with a RH6.2-based system running Ethereal-0.8.12+
&gt; (but I haven't touched any of the code to do with filtering), and it
worked
&gt; ... I got packets too and from that host ... Of course, it was the only
&gt; other machine on the wire ... So I will power up another and check it
out.

I had another very quick play with it also, and it seems I'm
getting snagged with some sort of GUI logic error - once I
get a syntax error message box I can never seem to recover
until I restart and then the filter works.  This was with an
IP filter, but the symptoms were like those I saw when I was
testing MAC filters last night...

I'll try it more carefully over the weekend...


Cheers, Dieter.

&gt; &gt;Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I know we have some Ethereal luminaries on this list...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm investigating a timeout problem on a moderately congested
&gt; &gt;network using Ethereal, but I've been having problems with the
&gt; &gt;capture filter syntax (I'm OK with the display filter syntax
&gt; &gt;for the moment).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm interested in only capturing the traffic from one or two
&gt; &gt;of the hosts, and for the IP traffic I seem to be able to use:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  ip host host1name or ip host host2name
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As this network has a mix of IP, IPX, LAT and sundry other
&gt; &gt;stuff on it, I'd like to be able to see all the traffic with
&gt; &gt;these hosts, but something like:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  ether host 12:34:56:78:09:AB
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;doesn't seem to work.  Can I capture based on MAC rather than
&gt; &gt;IP address?

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Also, are any of you aware of analysis tools or plugins that
&gt; &gt;can help to analyse traces for timeout issues?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Cheers, Dieter.
