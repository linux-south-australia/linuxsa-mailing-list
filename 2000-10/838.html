&gt;&gt; However, bear in mind that if you're running
&gt;&gt; a multi-threaded version of squid (and they do exist), Linux's ps
&gt;&gt; shows each thread as though it were a process, so what you're seeing
&gt;&gt; may not be what you're getting.

I have to qualify this - _some_ Linux ps's show this.  My RedHat 6.1
box doesn't (yet I know I'm running Zope multithreaded).  But it
quite commonly pops up on the Zope list.

&gt; How do I tell what I am actually getting then? And is it possible/useful to
&gt; reduce the number of threads running -- seems wasteful to me when there is
&gt; but one of me using the cache...

Why is it wasteful?  The whole point of threads is that they don't chew
up anywhere near the system resources that processes do.  And there may
be only one of you, but when you hit a page with multiple graphics etc.,
those objects are downloaded concurrently, not sequentially.

I suppose an off the cuff way of telling for sure is to check the PID
of the processes to see if they are the same (or use the tree option
of ps).
