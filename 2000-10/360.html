Hi all,

I'm not a guru, but if you guys don't mind appart from all statements on
signal 11 I wish to add some problems I had. And yes, there where people
helping me to fix the problems, like David Llyod, Benjamin Close. There
where also many of you who sent advises, I thank you all!
I bought some RAM, that was one problem, one stick was faulty. Here
comes in the signal 11, Linux would not install. David fixed that by
getting rid of the faulty sticks, after which he installed the software.
Next comes the Linux box locking. Even three times in one session.
Benjamin has made some changes in BIOS, that refer to memory, don't
remember exactly what. Trying to install Mozilla on the other hand, the
signal 11 reappeared, reason being I believe not enough RAM.
Why such large e-mail, because appart from hardware fault, there can
also be a setup problem, very hard to identify, also memory, not enough
memory and so on...
My computer at the moment runs on 48MB RAM (not much, I know), but is
very usable, Linux the only OS, no locking anymore and no Mozilla either
:o( There is my point, Mozilla needs more memory and throws a signal 11
as there is a fault somewhere.
Best wishes,

Nick.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the topic of RH7 anyone have any problems with compiling 2.2.17 on RH7?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, cuts out in the midle of one of the Modules. I'm told (I've not
&gt; looked since this problem occurred), that RH7 is using a beta version of
&gt; GCC. I was going to try uninstalling and puting a previous version from
&gt; the RH6.2 disk on and seeing if that made a difference.
