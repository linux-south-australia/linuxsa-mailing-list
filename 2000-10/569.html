&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have heard it said that having Apache, SSL, and the FrontPage
&gt; extensions
&gt; &gt; will not work together. It would be interesting to see if you can get
&gt; them
&gt; &gt; to play together.

I made it compile once. With the Frontpage 98 extensions, my Apache
executable was literally double the size it was without. It also
wouldn't start.

&gt; &gt; In any event, why do you need the FrontPage extensions? Can't Samba do
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; you need?
&gt; 
&gt; Well personally I do most of my web work in vi but there are a
&gt; good number of people who like to do simple ongoing web site
&gt; maintenance with something like FrontPage, and the security
&gt; implications of offering samba shares on a globally visible IP
&gt; address make my flesh crawl (not that I mentioned that in my
&gt; original question).

Who said anything about letting the world see it? You can tell Samba to
only accept connections from certain machines. If you don't think that
Samba can keep up with the job, simply use ipchains to make sure. It's
not NT ;-)

&gt; I do advise people strongly against using
&gt; FP as anything more than a simple formatted text editor, and
&gt; to keep away from the widgets, but the upload facility seems
&gt; to be something they are comfortable with - I've given up on
&gt; trying to educate people who don't want to listen.

I still want our web guy to use vim (color syntaxing) but he's not
interested ;-)
