On the topic of trends in the industry,
like MS versus linux etc., this item might interest you:

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/14092.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/1/14092.html</A>

It seems that now MS makes only about 70% of income
from "legacy" business, and the rest from investing
in other people's ventures.

First, I think this is really interesting that, just as
I have been doing for a while, some serious people
(i.e. US people with bags of money) are referring to
MS's software as "legacy".
But second, I think it's interesting the way
that MS is getting it's money out of its core operations.
[Perhaps this is like the tobacco companies seeing the
writing on the wall and moving their cash to some place else.]

But with MS buying up linux-related businesses, and with
red hat being a public company with currently low value

<A HREF="http://iqc.go2net.com/cgi-bin/c?time">http://iqc.go2net.com/cgi-bin/c?time</A>=day&period=365&i0=1&chart=Bar&chart1=MA&w=600&i1=0&i2=0&i3=0&s=Linear&symbol=rhat

it's clear that MS could snap up redhat very quickly, and
a few other linux concerns too.
If they own everything, then how can they lose??
Of course they can't do this until they get their
court case thrown out.

And right now MS shares are looking quite pale too:

<A HREF="http://iqc.go2net.com/cgi-bin/c?time">http://iqc.go2net.com/cgi-bin/c?time</A>=day&period=365&i0=1&chart=Bar&chart1=MA&w=600&i1=0&i2=0&i3=0&s=Linear&symbol=msft

At US$50, down from US$120 10 months ago, they're not
looking very good at all.

So I just want to make a little prediction:
Not only will MS software bite the dust in 2 years;
but the MS money will take over all the linux businesses
on the market.

Just a thought in passing.
No need to respond in triplicate.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I've just come back from 3 weeks in France, working
in loose association with a small ISP with 36 web designers.
The designers all use MS design tools, and the servers
all run linux. And they use PHP/Postgres for their
databases.
Locally, I couldn't find any redhat, but the local bookshop
had the French edition of SuSE 7.0, which I bought and
intend to use for my next firewall machine.
It was a pleasure to see that I didn't have to explain
to these people what linux was.
One of the sys admin people had been building linux
since the 0.x.y kernel days.
