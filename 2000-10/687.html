Getting out my old student card, yep I recall that year, we didnt have
computing facilities yet at uni so I brifly contemplated the idea of
becoming an earth scientist. But the closest I got to it was 1 field trip
with too much alcohol.

But we did get computers in 83 and no cards, terminals (televideos) running
on primes. With primos o/s, sol as the editor (sol = son of ludwick &lt;- some
form of editor)
ah how did I live without my GUI.



&gt;Hey I remember those days!  filling in those cards as a kid and waiting
for our
&gt;calandar printouts to come back from angle park.
&gt;and when I started comp studies at the levels in ohh...  '82,
&gt;using the card punch machine to punch out our lines of code. then putting
them
&gt;into the 'in tray' and waiting for the men in white lab coats feed them
into the
&gt;cyber  ( I think it was a cyber) and then coming back 3 hours later to
collect
&gt;our  printouts.  I remember dropping a large stack of cards and trying to
sort
&gt;them out in time to submit and still get my output in time to hand up.
&gt;
&gt;those were the days.  Its a pity I didn't spend more time studying and
less time
&gt;partying because I may have well passed.
