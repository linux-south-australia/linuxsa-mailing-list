This isn't strictly true.  Prototypes were an enhancement to the
language added in ANSI C.  Before then, an undeclared function
was assumed to have the prototype:

  int function(int, int, ...)

Thinking about it in assembler terms on a 32 bit machine, this means
that the caller assumed all the arguments were word (32 bit) items
and placed them onto the stack.  The function was then called.  The
function was assumed to have placed a word on the stack before it
would exit.

You'll note that the string functions do exactly this, especially
if we assume that a "char *" is the same as an "int".

strcpy(a, b) loads the 32bits of the pointer "b" onto the stack,
then the 32bits of the pointer "a", then calls strcpy.  It expects
to see 32bits returned.

  PUSH X
  PUSH B
  PUSH A
  CALL STRCPY
  POP X

Of course, moving away from 32-bit machines into more complex
architectures, that isn't true.  So ANSI introduced prototypes,
allowed non-integers to be function arguments, insisted that an
"int" and "char *" were perhaps not represented in the same
number of bits, and so on.

Of course, the library functions were designed for the older C
without prototypes, so they still work without a prototype on
a 32-bit architecture.

This doesn't make the use of them without including the header
correct, as your code may be compiled on a machine with 32bit
ints and 64bit addresses, in which case it will break.  In
your case, running on an machine where sizeof(int) == sizeof(char *),
it just happens to work.
