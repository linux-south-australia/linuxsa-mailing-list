Mark:

&gt; &gt; not in an application such as cp or cpio.  Did any of my staff or proteges
&gt; &gt; do something like that and I would feel obliged to beat such person around
&gt; &gt; the head and shoulders.  Severely.

&gt; Please don't beat me! :-)

I see you're not into S&M...such a pity...I hear the David (Newall) is a
relatively lenient master :-)

&gt; Why absurd?  (Please give arguments other than argument by
&gt; intimidation:-)

Essentially it only protects you when you are using these commands. As
David Newall pointed out _below_, if you manage to protect the integrity
of the data at the lowest level it doesn't *matter* what these commands
do. They will just work.

&gt; &gt; The place to be paranoid about disk I/O is in the disk I/O driver, or
&gt; &gt; better yet, in the disk I/O hardware.  I have no idea if Linux offers
&gt; &gt; read after write.  If it does I predict it would be an option that is
&gt; &gt; off by default.

&gt; But surely at disk I/O driver or hardware level, only a certain amount
&gt; of integrity checking can be done?

Hardware may be limited by physical factors, although I dare say that's
not too much of a factor these days. But a disk device driver has
unlimited access (so to speak). You COULD scan ALL RAM before doing disk
i/o if you really paranoid EVERY bit that you accepted. You COULD do
anything that the machine is capable of before, during and after any i/o
operation...

&gt; And besides, what if you don't know how good your disk
&gt; I/O driver and hardward do things?  Doing it in software can be an
&gt; added safety check.

If one didn't know how good one's disks were or drivers were or other
hardware were and one was concerned about one's data then I suggest that
one would be totally ignorant. I agree doing it in software - hmmm, I
can feel an AVI clip coming on - is an added safety check. But it really
shouldn't be your only safety check.

&gt; Michael Neuling just sent me (and to the list) a good way of doing an
&gt; integrity check by hand using md5sum.  Why not have cp do something
&gt; like this itself, or at least have it as an option?  I can't see why
&gt; the idea is absurd and warrants a beating!

You could write a script to do such a thing:

[get arguments]
[take md5sum of argument 1]
[copy file argument 1 to file argument 2]
[take md5sum of argument 2]
[compare]
[complain if not same]

You would probably find it's more efficient to use diff and cmp
though...

As the miller told his tale
That a face that at first was ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale....
