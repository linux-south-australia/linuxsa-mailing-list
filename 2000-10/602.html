Another disadvantage of ADSL is that it won't be available outside the 
major cities anytime soon. Furthermore, ADSL will not be made available 
in areas where cable TV and the like already exist. This was the story I 
got from several of the ISPs at the recent computer expo at Wayville 
showgrounds (it's interesting what you can learn when your kids drag you 
off to these "glitzy" events ;-)

Neither ADSL or cable are/will be available where I live & work for at 
least two years, and the last time I enquired about ISDN for my business 
it was going to cost ~$11000 to install. Not to mention the ongoing costs 
of ISDN. So it looks like my modems will be sending data out to the world 
for a while yet.

As for the Windows bias you noted, I often get the impression Telstra 
don't want to know about Linux.  The paranoid might conclude that 
Microsoft has indentured them in the usual unholy alliance – sorry 
"strategic partnership" – but there may be other reasons. When I tried to 
get a permanent BigPond connection via my Linux box early this year, it 
was seven weeks of utter frustration trying to get their authentication 
to work. Day after day of phoning BigPond Support and tweaking and 
patching and kernel recompiles...eventually I gave up and went with 
Optus. To whom I connected within 2 minutes from a bog-standard RedHat 
install.

I have since discovered that Telstra have quietly changed something at 
their end so that standard PAP/CHAP authentications actually work 
nowadays. I guess I wasn't the only one who refused to pay their bills?

Optus also don't officially support Linux (yet), but a lot of their 
techies seem to be Linux fans. I've had no trouble getting my occasional 
Linux-related queries answered. More often than not by the techie telling 
me "...well, on my Linux box at home, I got [whatever] working by doing 
this..."

By contrast, I recall one of those BigPond troubleshooting sessions where 
their techie asked me "what version of Windows is your Linux running on?" 
Oh dear....


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
