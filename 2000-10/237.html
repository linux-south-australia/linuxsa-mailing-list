&gt;I'm thinking of buying one of the new IBM Deskstar 7200 RPM ATA/100
&gt;hard drives, and this has got me thinking about the best way of
&gt;managing it.
&gt;
&gt;I am thinking that if I got a 20 or 30 meg drive, I would have room to
&gt;spare, so why not introduce some redundancy to allow for error

Wow, you must be frugal with space ... :-)

&gt;checking and correction.  That is, rather than having to do backups,
&gt;wouldn't it be nice if the filesystem did it implicitly in some way.
&gt;
&gt;As I understand it, RAID does this in some crude way.  That is, you
&gt;can do disk mirroring.  And I understand you could probably divide a
&gt;single disk into two partitions and do partition mirroring.  Is this
&gt;right?  

While drives are very reliable these days, by using partition mirroring,
you have achieved nothing. If the disk goes, you have lost the lot ...

&gt;          Alternatively, aren't their other versions of RAID which allow
&gt;different levels of redundancy than mirroring --- ie instead of a
&gt;ratio of 2:1, you could have 5:4 or something?

RAID 4/5 allows you to use three or more drives, where one drive is used to
provide parity for all the other drives, so you can tollerate the loss of
one drive from the set. RAID 4 uses a single drive for parity, and it thus
becomes a bottleneck, while RAID 5 spreads the parity out across all the
drives, eliminating the bottleneck. However, it still requires more IO on
writes, as you have to compute and write the parity.

&gt;Is RAID of any use with a single disk, using multiple partitions?

No use at all! If the drive goes, you have lost the lot.

&gt;There is also LVM (Linux Volume Management I think it stands for)
&gt;which allows you to have virtual volumes.  I believe it allows more
&gt;flexibility than RAID, but I'm not sure if it does redundancy stuff.

LVM allows you to add to your storage, but does not seem to support any
mirroring as yet.

&gt;One problem with RAID redundancy, is that although it allows you to
&gt;survive a disk crash, it doesn't check for corruption of data.
&gt;Presumably you could combine RAID with something like ReiserFS or
&gt;ext3.  Anyone have any comments about this, or the stability of
&gt;ReiserFS etc?

Well, a RAID 5 system can tollerate the loss of one drive, and your data is
still intact. However, if your system crashes with unflushed buffers, then
you will need to repair the file system. ReiserFS is a journalling file
system with a number of other advantages, and appears to be very stable.
However, I have not used it, but will do so soon.

&gt;The other possibility is the use of Coda.  The main advantage of coda
&gt;is that it is designed to work well with a laptop.  If I want have my
&gt;laptop and main computer share the same file system, Coda can do this.
&gt;If I take my laptop away for a while, and then later reconnect it to
&gt;my network, Coda will syncronize the file systems for me.
&gt;
&gt;So.  My main problem is that there seem to be lots of interrelated
&gt;technologies out there, and I'm still trying to come to grips with how
&gt;they all work and interrelate, and how stable they each are, and what
&gt;solutions are best.  I just thought I'd send out this email to get
&gt;some feedback and people's ideas etc.

For the average home user, there is probably not a lot of reason to do so.

&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Mark.
