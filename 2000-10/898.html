&gt; I know that you can purchase these ready made, but it would be interesting
&gt; to learn the theory behind it, and make one myself. Has anyone tried this
&gt; here in Adelaide? id love to hear from you !

Just another little note....
Concerning the legaility bit again, here are some of my
collected links on technologies, mostly in Australia, for
putting TCP/IP on wireless.

I also remembered that when I was interested in this a
year ago, someone near Victor Harbour told me that there
were some hotels using wireless LANs between the hotels
for their booking system, using TCP/IP.
So I think the legality thing is not a big hurdle.

In fact, here's my little hint for a design.
But don't tell anyone I told you about this....
This might not be quite legal.

But a pair of Dick Smith FM transmitter kits,
like the K-5008 (about A$20?). Tune them just below the standard
FM band. Get two vanilla FM receivers.
Now using two different frequencies for your
transmitters, you have a full-duplex audio path.
With an acoustic coupler modem, you can connect
across this with PPP.
Well, there are zillion variations on this.
You could connect up a PIC chip at each end to
send high-rate (100 kbit/sec) comms over this
link using simple FSK --- well, you'll need a PLL
circuit, I guess. I know someone who's done all of this.
In fact, they were thinking of running video over the link
using a CCD camera or similar, for monitoring cow thieves --
I don't remember all the details.
It helps to have a soldering iron and an oscilloscope 
for this sort of thing, and a good background in
circuit design.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
