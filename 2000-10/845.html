This sounds quite reasonable to me, but leaves me with the question why
would there be some problems with tcp-ip? I am using the firewall software
"Lokkit" that comes with RH 7.0 but I have that set to the lowest security
if that may have some relevence.

I was 'kindly' supplied one of these for work, I wasn't overly impressed
with it but I didnt have any major problems once I had the correct drivers
installed. I spoke to the distributer and they basically didnt think to
much of them either except for price. 

It sounds like the problem you are having is not a problem with the modem
hardware but maybe an incompatability with Linux, given it works under
win2k. With regards to ICQ I am pretty sure it doesnt use TCP (which is
what HTTP/FTP use) to stay connected (like it does for other services) but
something more like a ping (possibly using UDP) telling icq host your still
online. 

Good luck

&gt;I agree that these modems may have problems but I haven't had any problems
&gt;previously with other
&gt;accounts and I have had a few! Could you have timeouts with HTTP and FTP
but
&gt;ICQ still be fine 
&gt;if it were a modem problem? Anyway one way to find out is try another modem
&gt;which I'll do tonight. Thanks!

&gt;We are an ISP and have nothing but problems with customers using these
&gt;modems.
&gt;If we find a customer using one, we recommend the they get a better
&gt;modem.
&gt;Perhaps a later ComOS on our PortMasters may support these better but
&gt;there
&gt;seems to be no problems with other modems using Cirrus Logic Chipsets.
