I believe you are probably eligible for "cheaper" sattelite or idsn rates.
So theoretcially you can get a braodd=band servcie(at least for incomiing
stuff).

&gt; I still cannot believe that we are living in country that cannot get its

&gt; 
&gt; 		Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; 		This is probably a little off topic but what the heck !
&gt; 
&gt; 		You're all probably sick of those commercials for the
&gt; "World's Best Address"
&gt; 		and more recently "Adelaide's Most Pretigious Address", but
&gt; you should try
&gt; 		living here.  Telstra has somehow managed to perpetuate on
&gt; of the biggest
&gt; 		joke's on the residents of these beautiful suburbs
&gt; (considering that most of
&gt; 		Telstra's infrastructure in the area has been commissioned
&gt; since 1994).  The
&gt; 		golden grove development consists of three suburbs, Wynn
&gt; Vale, Golden Grove
&gt; 		and Greenwith, within the development there are over 10,000
&gt; houses with most
&gt; 		of the recent development in Greenwith and of course the
&gt; luxury Spring Hill,
&gt; 		which is located right on the Golden Grove/Greenwith border
&gt; (and accross the
&gt; 		creek from my place).  As far as number of dwellings,
&gt; Greenwith appears to
&gt; 		be the larger suburb and is still expanding.
&gt; 
&gt; 		Now here's the rub - the majority of residents in Greenwith
&gt; and Spring Hill
&gt; 		have their phones serviced off the Greenwith AXE RAU, this
&gt; is an AXE Remote
&gt; 		Access Unit which is parented off one of the major Adelaide
&gt; CBD exchanges.
&gt; 		In itself this is not a problem, but Telstra then decided to
&gt; use RIM's to
&gt; 		provide the phone services to the end user, which means most
&gt; residents
&gt; 		cannot get higher than a 28.8K modem connection and can
&gt; dream about such
&gt; 		things as ADSL and ISDN.
&gt; 
&gt; 		Here's how it works, the entire development is full of fibre
&gt; optic cabling
&gt; 		(just dream about the Gigabits of capacity) and this is used
&gt; to cable the
&gt; 		RIM's to the GWTH RAU.  From each RIM, standard copper
&gt; twisted pair is used
&gt; 		for the local loop to each house.  Sound's great doesn't it,
&gt; lots of clean
&gt; 		digital channels between the RAU and each RIM and then
&gt; literally metre's of
&gt; 		new copper cable to each house.  Think again, Telstra
&gt; decided to use non
&gt; 		integrated RIMs which means that the local copper loop is
&gt; converted to
&gt; 		digital at the RIM, the signal is then transmitted through
&gt; the fibre optic
&gt; 		cable to the RAU where it is converted back to analogue and
&gt; fed into the
&gt; 		standard analogue exchange ports of the RAU.  These two
&gt; analogue to digital
&gt; 		conversions are what restricts the modem to a theoretical
&gt; limit of 31.2K but
&gt; 		more realisticly 28.8K.  If Telstra had used integrated RIMs
&gt; then the RIM
&gt; 		would be digitally connected to the RAU, thus eliminating
&gt; the second A/D
&gt; 		conversion and allowing 56K modem operation, also ISDN
&gt; services would be
&gt; 		available right now and ADSL would only require adding new
&gt; cards to each of
&gt; 		the RIMs and not changing all the interfacing infrastructure
&gt; at the RAU end.
&gt; 
&gt; 		Back to ADSL, Telstra wasn't planning to provide ADSL to
&gt; Golden Grove - the
&gt; 		service was going to stop at the Modbury exchange.  However,
&gt; according to
&gt; 		their web site, Telstra is now reviewing the provision of
&gt; ADSL from the
&gt; 		Golden Grove exchange.  This will make most residents of
&gt; Golden Grove and
&gt; 		Wynn Vale happy, but it still leaves the residents of
&gt; Greenwith and Spring
&gt; 		Hill out in the cold.  Perhaps somebody should inform the
&gt; investors on
&gt; 		Spring Hill who are building their 300K plus mansions of the
&gt; situation.
&gt; 		More to the point, somebody should tell Telstra about the
&gt; levels of
&gt; 		disposable income in the area, income which could be spent
&gt; on ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; 		Bottom line, perhaps all of us Greenwith residents should
&gt; consider swapping
&gt; 		our 56K modems with anybody who has a 28.8K modem to offer
&gt; and who can use
&gt; 		speeds in excess of 28.8K.  In the meantime I can continue
&gt; dreaming about
&gt; 		the Gigs of capacity buried behind my back fence, and put up
&gt; with my 28.8K
&gt; 		and Telstra's continual offers to put a Satellite dish on my
&gt; roof !!!!  Now
&gt; 		don't even get me started with regards to cable
&gt; services.....  I'll be quite
&gt; 		happy to switch all my phone services over to any carrier
&gt; who can plug me
&gt; 		into the digital age !!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; 		Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; 		Richard
