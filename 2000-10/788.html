&gt; I'll see you that, and raise you a Sendata 1200
&gt; Full Duplex modem.  Somewhere in storage I even
&gt; have an old UDM-1200 (which was really a 1200/75
&gt; modem using the popular "World Modem" chip, AM7910).

Okay. I can't match the 1200 bps modem.
In 1986, I used 300 bps, but that was just borrowed
from the Kentucky comp sci department. So I had to give
it back.

However, in 1989, I did buy a 2400 bps modem from someone
who went to the US and offered to get everyone a cheap
modem in the US. This one cost only A$100, even though the
current 1200 bps modems in Australia cost more like A$200
or A$300 at the time.

This further free modem is a "basic time" BT2400E,
still in excellent working condition, although it is
almost certainly not "Telecom Approved" or whatever
it's called now. It has a US 120V transformer too.
So I'm not expecting a rush for this one.
And 3 of the 9600 bps modems are still available.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I guess that in 2 years, even 56k modems will
be history. If ADSL gets serious, the 56k modem is going
to start looking old-fashioned.

PPS. What would be really good for a museum would be
an old acoustic coupling modem. I bet not many people out
there still have one of those.
And what about the real TTY machines? The ones that replaced
morse code for telegraphy. Weren't they 75 bps or something?

PPPS. I looked around the SA state museum web site at
<A HREF="http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/">http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/</A>
but I saw no sign of where you apply to get a new collection
started. I reckon if the state museum started now, they'd
have a really valuable IT history collection within 10 years.
And then us old-timers could get rid of all our old junk.
