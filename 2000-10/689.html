Hi.

My first successful program was a continuous sine-wave plot on the
Minitran service offered by Monash uni to the Melbourne secondary schools.
The program was 'written' by pushing out holes on a series of punch cards
and then wrapping them in a job request card.

The output (or some 100 pages of it, anyway) was returned the next week
with a terse note asking that the school discipline the individual
concerned. Unfortunately for society, the teacher saw the funny side of
the situation and made a farcical attempt at doing so, with much hilarity
in the class.

About 1972 I think.

&gt; No, I started young, I published a reverse engineering of
&gt; the TRS-80 hardware and software when I was 12.

&gt; I think that there are plenty of people in LinuxSA that learnt
&gt; computing with a card punch and printer before the era of the
&gt; single chip CPU.
