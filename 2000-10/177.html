&gt; 
&gt; Web pages are like command line utilities, input in and output out with
&gt; no user interaction in between where functions are just as useful as
&gt; objects. If you're an OO programmer, then servlets are the way to go,
&gt; but personally I've always found php to be faster to execute, and faster
&gt; to develop than servlets without offering anything less.


Yes buit that does nto mean there is not lots of interaction between abck
end systems. Just not with the user.

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; That is not a java sepcific issue, could esaily happen with a C cgi script
&gt; &gt; or any other compiled language. I perosnally woudl consider that a poor
&gt; &gt; coding problem. I can't see why in java or any other compiled langaue
&gt; &gt; that there is any reason whatsoever to hard code hostnames, database names
&gt; &gt; etc in. Use the config file Luke.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Irrelevant.
&gt; 
&gt; Compiled binaries aren't very common for CGI-type web content in an
&gt; open-source environment. I would consider this relevant to a linux list.
&gt; When's the last time you saw anyone write a one-off C program for a CGI
&gt; on linux?

Well nto recently. But that is cos I don;t ahng aroudn with him anymore.
I know a few people who write all there CGI in C.

It is not that unusal.
I kow of at least one person on this list who wrotes CGI in C.

&gt; 
&gt; If a web developer goes broke or decides that their customer should be
&gt; locked into the binary code with expensive modifications, it's not much
&gt; comfort for the client that it was java. I have had to work with some

Or if it is C. I was merely pointing not having source cna be a problem
with many languages and is nto really relvant in an a comparison of
technology.

Even with interpreted languages, you may not be able to legally modify
 the script you  paid for.

&gt; java stuff from big name web developers, and apparently config files are
&gt; too much hassle for them. 

Which just goes ot show that big name and clue are not mutually inclusive.

But still doens't make any point for agains whatever technilogy they use,
other than to say, they pershaps don;t use their chosen technology very
well.

Or they use it very well and their main considerationis ongoing revenue.
Either way not atechnology issue.

&gt; 
&gt; PHP, Perl and other scripting languages can be easily modified by a
&gt; novice to get immediate results .. try doing that as a beginner when you
&gt; need to go get the JDK to match the JRE and run the compiler with a
&gt; bunch of paths to change "hello world" to "hello world!".

Adding an explanantion pointdoes nto reuire chasing donwna different JDk,
or changing paths (presumably the CLASSPATH) in any java I have seen.

But it is no different to not being able to get a perl module to run,
becuase the .pm files live somehwere else on Linux thatn they do under
BSDi.

Or to having an ancient perl 4 interpreter on your target system whereas
the machine your developed your script on had perl5.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; version of glibc, and you're missing half of the objects considered
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'normal'. Maybe things have gotten better since I last installed it..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course the right version of glibc for your C cgi-bin program
&gt; &gt; without source supplied might not be available either or some other
&gt; &gt; library, perl module or whatever.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not really a problem with using java(or any other specific language), a
&gt; &gt; problem of not checking your target environment.
&gt; 
&gt; Sure, but it's something that's not been an issue with php.


&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Once again not really a java/jsp issue.
&gt; &gt; That really comes down to choosing your ecommerce provider to match your
&gt; &gt; requirments.
&gt; 
&gt; Once again, "customers" add another degree of freedom to the equation
&gt; that tends to make the technical side more difficult. Java is touted as
&gt; a cross-platform run-everywhere language that is not much more portable
&gt; than C in some cases.

It depends what you mean by portable.
you can typically run bytecode on many platforms.
You can rearely run object code on more platforms that nexactly one. There
are expcetiosn but they ARE the ecpetions and nto the rule.

And with java you knwo an int is a 32 bit number with some endian patter(I
have no  idea what it is).

Not so fore many languages.

That seems pretty portable to me, particularly.

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; And if you don't want/can't use mySQL or postgres?
&gt; &gt; What if you want(or have to) to use DB2, Oracle or whatever?
&gt; 
&gt; It's a configure --db option. There is support for most popular
&gt; databases in the main package, again servlets proved to be a hassle to
&gt; get hold of a simple mysql object. They usually require that a client
&gt; library is installed somewhere, and use that.

So to add Oracle support orall you need to do is compiel some code.
Not exactly trivial for most people.

With JDBC you change a command line argument.

&gt; Servlets have a lot of benefits, and the way they execute on a seperate
&gt; server is really cool too, but I'm yet to come across a solid reason to
&gt; use them instead of PHP or Perl for a web application, and where I have
&gt; used them they wasted a lot of time by comparison.

Perhaps that is the case in your environment(and proably most
environments - because typcially most cgi stuff does liettle stand
alone-ish stuff), but in a large system with many interactions
with/between  many applications and perhaps a lot of networking, I think
java based solutions would come out in front as it can be so pervasive
(ie you can use your cusomter object in your web page, in your ordering
applicaiton, in your mailing list etc etc - I  can;t think of a way to
eeasily do that withotehr systems apart form perhaps something like
corba, which I ahve never had anythgn to do with and from what I
understand, probably would be happy to keep it tht way).
