&gt; Best be it you are going to install Telecoms. gear is to talk to a
&gt; lawyer :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think the rules have relaxed a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, they did change from what they used to be in 1997.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For instance, someone told me that a few years ago,
&gt; &gt; universities in Melbourne were renting properties spaced by
&gt; &gt; a bit less than 500 metres because there was some law saying
&gt; &gt; that private people could lay their own fiber up to 500 metres
&gt; &gt; without going through Telstra.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) The old "500m" rule is no longer applicable. It's now sections 26 and
&gt; 27 of the Telecommunications Act 1997.
&gt; 2) If it's customer cabling, i.e. it's all within your own property, you
&gt; can do whatever you feel like! There is nothing that says you can't
&gt; install some fibre obtic, or use a wireless LAN, from your house to your
&gt; shed out the back. Go nuts. However, if that cable/LAN is then hooked up
&gt; in any way to a licenced Teleco's network, then you need to make sure
&gt; that the installation is done by an AUSTEL/ACA licenced cabler, or
&gt; (under the new system introducted October 3 this year) by a Registered
&gt; Cabler.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There's also such a thing as a 150 MHz band which you can
&gt; &gt; do what you like with as long as the range is less than
&gt; &gt; a kilometre or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Not entirely. There is unlicenced spectrum (eg. 2.4 GHz etc), but you
&gt; can't do whatever you like with it. If you're using it for a Telecoms
&gt; network, you need to be lincenced, unless you can get a section 26/27
&gt; exemption. Andrew, it could well be that you can get such an exemption,
&gt; and setup the LAN like you want. But you'd want to see a lawyer to make
&gt; sure you can do it :-)

You'll probably fins that it is 2.5GHz, we have been trialing some
Planet 11Mbps wireless gear for a client that will do 800 feet line of
sight. Haven't been able to verify you can't get 800 feet of open space
here. It is available as lan access points as well as wireless pci card
(Can't see why you would want it) and wireless pcmcia cards. The stuff
is fairly cheap. They are not secure, mind you it is rather neat walking
around the office retrieving your email on a laptop. The Lan Access
Point is completely transparent to the rest of the netwrok (no
configuring). No connector for external antenna.

Web site: www.planet.com.tw. 
I'd recommend the Planet products but can't guarantee the legalities of
the application. We don't sell them.  
or for secure stuff, www.breezecom.com, but the price increases
dramatically.

Building it yourself, while I admire the guts to do so, I suspect you
would after a lot of research and sweating over a hot soldering iron
that you'd created something that is unreliable and cost more than
something off the shelf. 

It may even create harmonics over the spectrum.  Could someone comment
on this aspect, it is out of my expertise.
