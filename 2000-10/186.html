<H1>linux for mobile phones - supported?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
On the topic of connecting a linux computer to
a mobile phone (e.g. Nokia 6210 or 6150),
is there anything different between this and
connecting up to a standard vanilla modem?

I'm checking out the Nokia 6210 and 6150 right now
(A$700 and A$455 respectively at my current
longitude and latitude [s'Gravenhage]), and the SuSE
hardware support database has no mention of mobile phones
or Nokia.
Nor can I find anything relevant on the redhat hardware
compatibility pages. 
(By the way, I'm impressed that the redhat compatibility
database has improved a lot in the last year or so, while
the SuSE compatibility database doesn't seem to have 
changed much in presentation.)

But I imagine that there must be someone out there who's
been using mobile phones with linux laptops since the pyramids.
If so, could you please let me know if it's all too simple
to be true (like LS-120 drives on the IDE interface) or
requires some special software?

It's just that whenever I buy something for a computer and
they give you a disk of MS software, I start to wonder
if I need something special for the linux machine too.
(Yesterday someone offered to give me the MS driver
software to go with an ethernet PC card. They were amazed
to see that the thing just worked by itself
when I plugged it in.)

Supplementary question:
Does anyone have any recommendations on which mobile phone
is the best to get for mobile data use?

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
