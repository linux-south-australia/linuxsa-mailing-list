&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; For the past six months or so i've had a Samba server running quite nicely
&gt; as a PDC with all Win98 clients attached to it. However, today I installed a
&gt; new Win2k box on the network, and it refuses to connect to the domain. I can
&gt; telnet into the linux box okay from the win2k box, and ping all other pc's
&gt; on the network, but when I try and attach to the domain it says account
&gt; doesn't exist in the domain. What have I done wrong ??
&gt; 
&gt; ... oh, and I think it's using Samba 2.0.6 or 2.0.7 ...

Samba 2.0.6 (and possibly 2.0.7)  can act as a PDC for Windows NT and a
logon server for Win9x. I don't think you'll have any luck with Win2K.
Try 2.2.0. I have heard of some people having luck. If not, try Samba
TNG.

On the other hand, try these steps with your current setup and see if
they help at all:

- create an account in /etc/passwd with the username being that of the
Win2K box with a '$' appended (eg, machine$). Make sure it's lowercase.
- create an account in the smbpasswd file for the machine with
'smbpasswd -m machine$ machine'. This will create a machine account for
the workstation and set the password to be that of the workstation (the
default under Windows).
- Attempt to join the domain under Windows. Don't tell it to create an
account at first, If that doesn't work try telling it to create an
account...


Hope it helps,
Matt
