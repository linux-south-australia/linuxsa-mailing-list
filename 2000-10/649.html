Its not that the GPL  might be found wanting but that if MS throw enough
expensive lawyers at it it *will* be found wanting.

If MS decided to enter the linux market in a serious way I'd think
they'd do
something that hasn't been tried yet - challenge the GPL in court so
they can
"embrace and extend" everything from the kernel upwards.  This _could_
be an
armeggedon-like battle, because if the GPL is found wanting, then the
well-oiled
MS marketing machine could extol linux's technical and community
benefits, while
incompatibily modifying (and "hiding") software to their benefit.  What
if Linus
decided to sell-out on the Linux trademark as well?  Gulp.  There would
be
nothing left - we'd then have to all move over to FreeBSD :-)
