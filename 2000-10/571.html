&gt; &gt; For the record, I've had an Apache server set up with DAV, PHP,
&gt; &gt; Postgresql and also a couple of others things like Zope and
&gt; &gt; mod_auth_pam fine. That was all using DSOs. I've also had an
&gt; &gt; Apache server running with SSL, PHP and MySQL, although I had
&gt; &gt; problems running PHP as a DSO, and eventually gave up and
&gt; &gt; compiled the thing into Apache.

DSO's are the way to go if you're planning on running more than a few
different modules, especially if the developers are the "release often,
release early" kind.

&gt; Don't think FP extensions are completely covered by WebDAV. Frontpage
&gt; needs 'em for more than just uploading files (apparently). The whole
&gt; thing's a joke really. In response to Richard Sharpe, we run Samba here,

Frontpage also likes its own extensions for it's canned cgi features.
The same ones that allow any person with a web browser to view the
results of form posts..

&gt; but we can only use FP98, because FP2000 requires us to use the
&gt; extensions. We tried and literally could not create a "web" on the same
&gt; share that we did with FP98 (ie, not a permissions thing). Web Guy's now

If you absolutely must have frontpage extensions, you could do a lot
worse than buying a Cobalt RAQ server. They run linux and support FP2000
out of the box, and it seems to keep working as long as the user doesn't
exceed their quota. Given the price tag of these boxes vs the amount of
time you'll waste getting FP to work properly, it's pretty close :)
