Servlets and JSP are different technolgies I beleive.

Roughly severlets are the java euqivilant to cgi bin programs.

JSP is roughly equivilant to php or ASP, though may be implemented via
servletes.

I beleive the Jakarta project is the current Free servlets project of
choice, and replaces the no longer supported JServ project.
Both of which can be accessed via the apache site, as i think can a JSP
engine for apache - try <A HREF="http://java.apache.org">http://java.apache.org</A> also anothe rpalce would
be the javasoft site www.javasoft.com.

And to address the question that someone else in the thread asked as
"..why use jsp and not php?" 

I believe that you can get a greater level of integation between java and
jsp than you can between php and other techiologies. 
Ie I suspect you can have a more ocnsistent object model and
possibly re-use code more - eg you can have Java classes which can be
potentially accessed though jsp, servlets, jdbc, java applets and java
applicaitons, if neccesary using RMI, object serialisation or any of
the other nuermous and typcially easy to use Java APIs.

Ie if you just look at the embedded scripting languages by themselves,
there probably aren't that many advantages, but if you have a multi tier
or complex application eg the web pages talk to a databaase which is also
used by other applciations - then the "Javaified solution" may well be
easier - and almost certainly allow more code reuse and be more cross
platform.

I have not heard of php implementations for the mac or windows, but I am
pretty sure you can get jsp for both of these platforms as well as
servlets - if nothing else you can run the java webserver on these paltforms 
which i bleive supports all  of the technlogies I have mentioned.
