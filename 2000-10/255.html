&gt; &gt; I am thinking that if I got a 20 or 30 meg drive, I would have room to

&gt;
&gt; &gt; And I understand you could probably divide a single disk into two
&gt; &gt; partitions and do partition mirroring.  Is this right?
&gt;
&gt; No.  Normally drives fail totally, not partially, so this gains
&gt; you nothing, at the expense of halving your available disk space.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Is RAID of any use with a single disk, using multiple partitions?
&gt;
&gt; Nyet - see above.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There is also LVM (Linux Volume Management I think it stands for)
&gt;
&gt; "Logical Volume Manage(r|ment)", unless Linux have employed
&gt; Microsoft Marketeers.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; which allows you to have virtual volumes.  I believe it allows more
&gt; &gt; flexibility than RAID, but I'm not sure if it does redundancy stuff.
&gt;
&gt; LVM has traditionally allowed "logical" volumes to be build out
&gt; of individual blocks of disk (but larger than a disk block; typically
&gt; several megs in size).  It supports both aggregate disk size (so you
&gt; can build a "disk" that's as large as all your disks added together),
&gt; and supports mirroring to multiple disk sets and striping.  Very funky,
&gt; and most of the big Unices use this.  Not sure what the state of the
&gt; art is for Linux LVM currently.

At the moment, im using LVM with the 2.4.0-test9 kernel across 4 IDE drives.
It works VERY well and is a much better system of disk managment than the
current (non-existant) system.
I have 4x2Gb partitions (2 off the 4Gb drive, and then all of the other 2Gb
drives) in one volume.
Ive then created a 128Mb logical disk (in the volume), that is in RAID0, for
my swap space.
Then the rest of the space is in linear setup in one logical disk that i then
use for /home.
The best parts of LVM are that the volumes/logical-drives can be resized on
the fly, and also that using the drives in linear, is safer than RAID-linear.
In RAID-linear is one drive goes, you loose the lot, but with LVM, only that
drives contents is lost.

MWP

&gt; &gt; One problem with RAID redundancy, is that although it allows you to
&gt; &gt; survive a disk crash, it doesn't check for corruption of data.
&gt;
&gt; This is where you would use something like Tripwire or Veracity.
