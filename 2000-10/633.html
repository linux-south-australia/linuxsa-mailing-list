&gt; on thin ethernet if you were lucky.  The MicroVAX was out.

Glen,

Much though I hate to disagree with anyone, I think that
when ANSI C started to be worked on, most machines
were called "16/32 bit", i.e. 16-bit bus and 32-bit
registers.
The Intel architectures were going for 20-bit address bus
and 16 or 32 bit data registers etc., which is why I decided
to stick with Motorola-based CPUs which had rational
registers and addressing.

With a 16-bit data bus and a 32-bit data register, it
was constantly a toss-up whether to use 16-bit integers
for better access speed or 32-bit registers for the greater
range. And that's why there was a choice of putting
16 or 32 bit integers on the stack.

So when I said that 32-bit CPUs were in the minority
(or a "novelty"), I meant that 32-bit data buses were
in the minority.

In the olden days, they used to put the pins on the
perimeter of the chip. Nowadays, you get a forest of
pins on the bottom of the chip.
I hate to think what the future will bring.
Maybe a forest of optical fibres.

The 68000 (the chip I still know better than any other)
had a 24-bit address bus and a 16-bit data bus,
although the address and data registers were both 32-bit.

I think the Sun1 used a 68000, the Sun 2 used a 68010,
the Sun3 had a 68020, which was finally a 32-bit data bus
machine. Virtual memory became possible with the 68010,
which had a full BUSERR stack dump, which permitted
process restart after a page fetch.

Summary:
The principle machines at that time would have
been the Sun3 (true 32-bit 68020), the macintosh,
amiga and atari-ST (all 16-bit 68000), a bunch
of Intel-based PCs (mostly not 32-bit bus, I think),
and the Vaxes, some of which may have had 32-bit
buses - I'm not sure about that.

More importantly, nearly all machines had the ability
to put a 16-bit integer on the stack, even if they
had a 32-bit data bus, I believe.
Therefore even for integers, it was essential to
know what kind of integer was being used as an
argument.
And that was indeed a time when over 50% of errors
could be attributed to function argument mismatches.
That was the advantage that Pascal had over classic C.

Nowadays, most errors might be caused by using the C
string and I/O functions without checking the arguments,
as in the examples that started this thread.
And that's where C++ leaves even ANSI behind - in
assisting the programmer to create safe types which use
pointers.
Come to think of it, function argument mismatches are
a special case of pointer abuse/misuse.
And pointer abuse/misuse probably causes 90% of
all C programming errors.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
