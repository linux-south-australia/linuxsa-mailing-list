&gt; &gt; The application only allows us to configure LAT (remember

&gt; &gt; that can speak TCP/IP to a terminal server (A CISCO ...)
&gt; 
&gt; This doth suck.  I had an application that did this once[1].  
&gt; I ended up
&gt; writing a program that, through the cunningness of pseudo ttys, made
&gt; an outbound TCP connection and wrote to a specific port on a terminal
&gt; server while impersonating a /dev/file.  Sadly, this has been lost in
&gt; the annals of time, but it does give you a method.
&gt; 

There's a piece of freeware called txpcfer which does 
just this. Opens a pipe (can be anywhere you want, such
as /dev/printer1), and an outbound TCP port on a host.

I used this to setup a printer for a client on an RS/6000 
running AIX, where the printer was connected to a serial 
port on a Cisco router. I've got the code at home, but 
not here. Let me know if you want it.

Otherwise, it's trivial to write the same thing in Perl in
about 20 lines of code. Just open the pipe and a socket to
the port on the host/router. Then loop forever reading from
the pipe and sending to the socket. Then tell your printer
backend to use the pipe as the device. (yes, I did this too
in case the client had concerns about "freeware"!!).

Dean
