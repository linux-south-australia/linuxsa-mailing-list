Hey all :)

My account with my ISP basically is unlimited; except I am disconnected
every 4 hours.

I have my RH6.2 Linux box configured to redial when the connection is
broken, nothing fancy.  Its just a 56K connection, being ppp0.

However, for some reason I am sometimes disconnected randomly, in some
cases, every 2 - 20 minutes.. meaning if I wasn't at the computer at the
time, I could rack up quite a huge phone bill.  This only happens
occasionally, but my ISP have assured me it isnt them, that it is my modem,
setup, or phone line.  (interestingly this never occurs on other ISPs).  I
have tried 4 modems, a different linux box, and had Telstra look at my line
several times to no extent.

However, this is not the issue.  What I want, is to somehow make my Linux
box redial "smarter".

I'd like to setup some kind of rule, so within a 4 hour period, it only
tries to redial twice.  This "rule" will also need to be easily stopped and
started from a telnet shell [a bash script maybe.. I really don't know,
hence why I am asking ;)].

I've tried cron and ifup ppp0, but ifup will disconnect and reconnect me.
Which defeats the purpose of this in the first place; to minimise phone bill
costs.

I'd appreciate any suggestions!

Ryan Verner.
