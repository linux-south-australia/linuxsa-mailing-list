Unless your are good at microwave stripline design I would suggest that you
not invent the wheel. Plus the stuffing around that you would have is really
not worth while. Buy an off the shelf, approved unit and you will probably
find that it is like a cordless phone, if you can get further than the
estimated distance then good luck to you.

		&gt; Best be it you are going to install Telecoms. gear is to
talk to a
		&gt; lawyer :-)
		&gt; 
		&gt; &gt; I think the rules have relaxed a bit.
		&gt; 
		&gt; Well, they did change from what they used to be in 1997.
		&gt; 
		&gt; &gt; For instance, someone told me that a few years ago,
		&gt; &gt; universities in Melbourne were renting properties spaced
by
		&gt; &gt; a bit less than 500 metres because there was some law
saying
		&gt; &gt; that private people could lay their own fiber up to 500
metres
		&gt; &gt; without going through Telstra.
		&gt; 
		&gt; 1) The old "500m" rule is no longer applicable. It's now
sections 26 and
		&gt; 27 of the Telecommunications Act 1997.
		&gt; 2) If it's customer cabling, i.e. it's all within your own
property, you
		&gt; can do whatever you feel like! There is nothing that says
you can't
		&gt; install some fibre obtic, or use a wireless LAN, from your
house to your
		&gt; shed out the back. Go nuts. However, if that cable/LAN is
then hooked up
		&gt; in any way to a licenced Teleco's network, then you need
to make sure
		&gt; that the installation is done by an AUSTEL/ACA licenced
cabler, or
		&gt; (under the new system introducted October 3 this year) by
a Registered
		&gt; Cabler.
		&gt; 
		&gt; &gt; There's also such a thing as a 150 MHz band which you
can
		&gt; &gt; do what you like with as long as the range is less than
		&gt; &gt; a kilometre or something like that.
		&gt; 
		&gt; Not entirely. There is unlicenced spectrum (eg. 2.4 GHz
etc), but you
		&gt; can't do whatever you like with it. If you're using it for
a Telecoms
		&gt; network, you need to be lincenced, unless you can get a
section 26/27
		&gt; exemption. Andrew, it could well be that you can get such
an exemption,
		&gt; and setup the LAN like you want. But you'd want to see a
lawyer to make
		&gt; sure you can do it :-)

		You'll probably fins that it is 2.5GHz, we have been
trialing some
		Planet 11Mbps wireless gear for a client that will do 800
feet line of
		sight. Haven't been able to verify you can't get 800 feet of
open space
		here. It is available as lan access points as well as
wireless pci card
		(Can't see why you would want it) and wireless pcmcia cards.
The stuff
		is fairly cheap. They are not secure, mind you it is rather
neat walking
		around the office retrieving your email on a laptop. The Lan
Access
		Point is completely transparent to the rest of the netwrok
(no
		configuring). No connector for external antenna.

		Web site: www.planet.com.tw. 
		I'd recommend the Planet products but can't guarantee the
legalities of
		the application. We don't sell them.  
		or for secure stuff, www.breezecom.com, but the price
increases
		dramatically.

		Building it yourself, while I admire the guts to do so, I
suspect you
		would after a lot of research and sweating over a hot
soldering iron
		that you'd created something that is unreliable and cost
more than
		something off the shelf. 

		It may even create harmonics over the spectrum.  Could
someone comment
		on this aspect, it is out of my expertise.
