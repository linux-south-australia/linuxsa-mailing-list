Okay, upon reflection, I agree with the majority opinion 
against using Perl as a stepping stone in learning C.  

I will still note that Perl is useful when learning 
about wider Unix programming, as it contains a distillation 
of quite a few components of the system -- but this is 
a later step in the learning curve.  

Incidentally, on the question of "programming languages", 
my definition of what constitutes a programming language 
is very broad, so Perl easily qualifies.  

I am indebted to Professor Wlad Turski for my ideas about
programming languages, for I attended a lecture as an 
undergraduate when Turski was visiting in which he pointed 
out that the entire process of building an overall system 
is the construction of a series of languages:

	L  -&gt;  L    -&gt;  L    -&gt;  ...  L     -&gt;  L
	 0      1        2             n-1       n

I have taken this concept to heart: Languages within 
languages within languages within languages.  Once 
you take this idea in, you can start usefully framing
many software components as languages.  

So I rate regular expression syntax+semantics as a 
language, as much as any given machine language, or 
assembly language, or C, or Perl, or X Windows, or 
the "engineering terminal" interface provided by 
some programs.  

A key idea in programming is that it takes about the 
same time to write (and test and document) a line of 
ANYTHING, so the fewer lines you need to write to 
complete a workable solution, the faster you're done.  

This then leads to an effort to push functionality up 
into the highest-level language that you can afford 
(given that the higher languages generally consume more 
resources, especially RAM and CPU, than lower-level 
languages, and also tempered by the fact that some 
problems don't fit well into the programming model 
offered by high-level languages).  

So your design should strive to form high-level languages 
that concisely but completely describe how to implement 
the solution to the original problem, and then 
you must describe in detail how each component of the 
high-level language is implemented in lower-level 
languages, and so on.  At the same time, you might 
proceed by forming a higher-level language (interface) 
on top of a low-level service, and build up towards 
your required solution from the bottom.  The trick 
is to have the top-level decomposition and the 
bottom-up integration meet in the middle.  

Another way of reducing the lines you need to write is 
by reusing code that's already tested and which you 
can trust to work in your environment, such as library 
functions.  But that's another topic in itself...
