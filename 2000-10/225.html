&gt; As John indicated, the interface to the Nokia phones is proprietary.
&gt; Electrically, an adapter (RS232 to 3.3V level translator) is required, which
&gt; can either be purchased or cobbled together quite easily (I used the
&gt; connector from a 'hands-free' kit).
&gt; 
&gt; The Nokia software for Windows creates a virtual COM port which does
&gt; implement a Hayes-style interface, and performs the necessary translation to
&gt; the Nokia protocol over the physical COM port, however the details of this
&gt; appear to be an on-going problem to decipher for the gnokii team. As you
&gt; will see from the gnokii web-site, Nokia have refused to provide the details
&gt; of their protcol, which is a great shame.

This makes it sound like the situation for Garmin GPS units, and
some kinds of webcams, which I have found do work with linux,
although in a not very comfortable way.
But if I'm in the bush and I need e-mail, I might be happy
to have any kind of connection at all.

The linux Garmin GPS software was written by observing windows
software generating commands and reverse engineering it.
Clearly the gnokii people have done the same thing.

Okay, now on the strength of this info, I've bought the
Nokia 6150, and accessories:

phone/charger		A$478.02
Data cable		A$ 55.24
headset			A$ 55.24
carry pouch		A$ 29.46
car transformer		A$ 22.10

This includes 17.5% Dutch GST.

The last time I tried to get a cable for the Nokia 2110,
it was about A$200. 
So this is a definite improvement.

So now I've got the phone and the cable and the laptop
with linux on it.
And I have the gnokii.org address for software.

I guess my next question will be as to how I get onto
the Internet with this - i.e. where do I get a point-of-presence.
Maybe I can set up my own home phone for this.
Or.... maybe I just GRIC or something, i.e. some sort
of global roaming thing.
I bet that's it.
I'll give it a go and report back.

Cheers, and thanks for all the info.
Alan Kennington.
