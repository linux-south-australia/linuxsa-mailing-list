&gt; Where do they suggest this?  What line are they talking about?  After
&gt; all, ADSL is a dedicated line between the exchange and your premises.

Telstra bigpond claims to be only a customer of Telstra wholesale, and
have to pay the same prices as ISP's for access to ADSL (the $108/month
minimum per line). Apparently, they get a volume discount. For ISP's
interested in the ADSL product, Telstra have said that 2Mb/s for 200-300
users should do the job. The wholesale ADSL offering works differently
to the usuall ISP setup which has caches and mail servers etc on the
same ethernet as the dialup servers, instead, a Frame or ATM link
connects the data center to the DSLAM, so all of an ISP's ADSL users are
sharing this bandwidth for ALL of their activity.

So yes, an ADSL connection is not shared to the exchange, but once you
get there you're subjected to a bottleneck based on the size of the link
to provider has to the equipment. Have a look at the Telstra costs for a
2Mb link, and you'll soon see how impossible it is to match $80 per
month without offering speeds comparable to a 300 baud modem.

&gt; Also, have you heard any info on ADSL in the Mount Barker area?

One of Telstra's top management people lives in Echunga, and says that
the the neighbourhood is rather far down the list of priorities for
Telstra.
