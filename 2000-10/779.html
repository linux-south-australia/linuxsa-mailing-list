&gt; &gt; I have a client that would like to do accounting for the
&gt; internet time of
&gt; &gt; their clients.
&gt;
&gt; Firstly, Internet "time" is a dodgy measure for permanently connected
&gt; machines.  You might want to charge by traffic or apparent bandwidth
&gt; instead.

Sorry, yes I want to charge for data

&gt; Split the network into two subnets.  Run IP accounting on the
&gt; router.  Use SNMP to fetch the records for traffic from Internet
&gt; to the subnet.  This depends a lot of the abilities of the
&gt; "propietary router" and mentioning a make and model would have
&gt; been useful here.

I have already investigated this and the most it can tell me is how much
data has been transferred every hour regardless of where it came from. The
router is a OneGate Internet Server Appliance

I can do SNMP with it which now leads me to another question, how do I use
SNMP to catch all this data?

&gt;  - replace the router with something that does accounting
&gt;    more suited to your needs.

dont really want to do this as the client spent around $1500 on this when
they bought it approx 12-15 mths ago (before I started working here)

I would like to do this as cheaply as possible without removing/replacing
any of their existing infrastucture if possible
