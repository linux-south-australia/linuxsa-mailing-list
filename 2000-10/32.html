[As always: I read LinuxSA via the digest, so apologies if this 
goes over ground already covered.]  

A couple of hopefully useful suggestions about C programming, 
although others may quite reasonably disagree:

1. Have a play with Perl!  

Perl's syntax and (to a lesser extent) semantics is based on 
C's.  In addition, other components of Unix (processes, 
networking, regular expressions) are also rolled into Perl, 
so you can cover quite a bit of the ground you are interested 
in in a somewhat less demanding environment.  Although 
there is much quite a bit in Perl that isn't in C, the 
overlap is quite high.  

Particularly nice is prototyping in Perl, and then rewriting 
in C only if needed.  

2. Look at the C FAQ after you've learnt the basics.  

The C FAQ provides lots of insight into tricky bits of C.  
The FAQ is worth reading end-to-end once you've started to 
get a feel for the language: It helps you write better 
code, and also sheds light on some of the language 
components that might not be obvious at first.  

The FAQ is also worth keeping on hand for when you stumble 
into some tricky coding situations and want a concise but 
clear discussion of the real issues.  

cheers,

Brenton

Ps [I couldn't resist!]: There's some C code on my web 
site that is fairly readable, which you can browse 
online or download: The complete sources to my very
fast grep program, Grouse Grep.  Follow Grouse's
