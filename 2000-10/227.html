Hi Jon,

Jon Schutz &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Jon.Schutz@youramigo.com">Jon.Schutz@youramigo.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt; We were the second in Adelaide to get ADSL behind Daryl.  Ironic,
&gt; really, that the first two installations of a service that is geared
&gt; toward single Windows PC systems are both installed on Linux-based
&gt; networks.

There has been a UNIX PPPoE client for at least as long as there
has been for Windows or Mac.  The "no network" policy on Telstra's
"flat rate" plan is purely an attempt at curbing their costs.

The product may be marketted by Telstra as being "Windows" or
"Single user" specific, but that doesn't mean it is :-)

&gt; By the way, they won't provide technical support if you choose to
&gt; connect your ADSL line to a network.

Telstra seem to want to be the retail telco, at the same time as not
wanting to be a retail telco.  It's amazing.  They want the end user
money, but don't want the end user support.

Hmmm.  can you say www.cakeneatit.com?

&gt; Most importantly from my point of view, they will not provide a static
&gt; IP so that we can run our mail and web services over the ADSL line.  I
&gt; don't know of any technical reason why this should be the case - I'd
&gt; be interested if anyone out there knows of one.

There are no technical reasons why you can't do this - ADSL as
a technology is *no* different from a dialup or ISDN connection,
even the technical constructs are the same (PPPo[E|A] is PPP over
[Ethernet|ATM])!

&gt; So far I haven't got an answer from them to say for sure if
&gt; they ever will provide static IP.

If you're interested in getting ADSL from an ISP who cares, talk to
Internode - they are now starting a trial of their product, if you
know you can get ADSL today from Telstra, talk to Chris Merchant at
Internode and register your interest in participating in the trial.

&gt; On a positive note, ADSL is a damn sight faster than a 56k modem
&gt; and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone as a relatively cheap
&gt; higher bandwidth alternative.

Just rememeber - it doesn't need to come from Bigpond, there ARE 
other ISPs out there who do it better!

Cheers

Leigh ( 3am?!? Yea, I know, hayfever sufferer :( ).
