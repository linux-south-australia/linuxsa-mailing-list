Those of you who have been following Mozilla for a while will know that
during each successive milestone it has been getting better and better.

Well, I took 40 minutes or so on Friday to compile Mozilla M18, and I 
have to say I'm really impressed:  I've been running it since shortly 
after it finished compiling, and here we are at 8:00pm on Monday night
and it hasn't crashed once.  Yes, that's right, the executable I started
last week is still running.

If we were talking about something like inetd, the immediate response
from most of you would be, "Ho, hum, stop wasting my time," but even 
the most jaded among you would recognize that four days of uptime for 
*any* browser, let alone Mozilla, is no mean feat :-)

Other new bits:  It supports https, it supports the OJI Java plugin,
it handles helper applications (better than Communicator, too, IMHO),
it's faster than the previous milestone (for what it's worth -- How much
do you really care about whether something is inefficient when it's 
running on an 866 MHz CPU? :-), some of the annoying glitches from
previous versions are now gone, and chrome has been updated (it comes
with a new theme called "Modern" which fits in well with the BlueHeart
GTK/Enlightenment themes.  It defaults to "Classic", which looks almost
exactly the same as Netscape Communicator 4.x).

I've noticed the odd bug still, like visual artefacts or dialogs which
don't seem to do anything until you "Cancel" them and then start again,
and strange effects every now and then when I try to login to CCO (my
first attempt yielded a META "refresh" tag, but it worked when I hit 
"Reload") but other than that I'm hugely impressed. 

There are two milestone releases to go.  In the meantime, I'd suggest that
people give it a try, even if it does still have some bugs, and use Bugzilla
to report them when they occur -- They won't get fixed unless they're 
reported!  

Cheers,

   - mark
