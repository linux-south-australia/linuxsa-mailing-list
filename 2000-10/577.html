Thanks Darryl,

Just for the record, I don't know why my email said it was from you.

The IP's are from my ISP's webpage. I checked them and they are correct
compared to what they have on the page, but I phoned them and apparently
they are incorrect and their page has been fixed to reflect the error, as of
15 mins ago.

DNS servers should be:
203.24.77.6  - Primary
203.24.77.1

I get a resolution with nslookup, but no success with ping, see below.

[<A HREF="mailto:josea@horus">josea@horus</A> /home/josea]$ nslookup
Server: fang.dsto.defence.gov.au
Address: 131.185.2.5

Name: ns1.picknowl.com.au	and 	ns0.picknowl.com.au
Address:  203.24.77.1			203.24.77.6

Ping gives 100% packet loss.

I will try these two new DNS IP's tonight and let you know how it works.

Regards
Andrew

Interesting, why did that email show up as being from me when it was 
obviously from Andrew????

OK, where did you get those IP addresses from?

==================================================

Looks to me like they are dead! I recommend that you phone your ISP and ask 
them what their nameserver addresses are, alternatively, enable the 
usepeerdns option in your ppp setup.  If you do have it enabled, then call 
your ISP and tell them that their server is giving you bad addresses, and 
you want the correct addresses.

If they don't give it to you then it's time to change ISPs :)

&gt; Hi again,
&gt;
&gt; I tried a few of the suggestions over the w/e and have the output for you 
to look at.  I also WAS able to ping the remote and local IP's 
successfully, unlike I though before. The ping results were quite fast with 
100% packet Tx. It does look to be a DNS problem. Haven't done a tcpdump 
yet.
&gt;
&gt; Below is output of resolv.conf:
&gt;
&gt; nameserver 203.44.77.1 	#kppp temp entry
&gt; nameserver 203.44.77.6 	#kppp temp entry
&gt;
&gt; and ipchains:
&gt;
&gt; Chain input (policy ACCEPT):
&gt; Chain forward (policy ACCEPT):
&gt; Chain output (policy ACCEPT):
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
