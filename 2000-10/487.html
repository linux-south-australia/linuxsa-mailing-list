&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps, but you're not gaining that much by having cp do a verify after
&gt; write either.  Take your first suggestion (I think it was yours) where
&gt; you do a checksum of a block, then compare that.  Any algorithm that
&gt; reduces 'x' bits to 'y' (where y &lt; x) suffers from information loss, and
&gt; stands a very small (but non-zero) chance of not detecting corruption, so
&gt; now you have this safe and cozy feeling while several bits of your data
&gt; have changed state, possibly rendering someone to the opposite sex or
&gt; increasing their bank balance by several orders of magnitude.

I accept your point about information reduction meaning corruption
might not be detected.  But you can still reduce the probability of
corruption without detection drastically.  Take for example parity,
where your check is a single bit.  Suppose there is a 1/1000 chance of
any given bit flipping (for the sake of the argument --- in practice
this would be much smaller).  If we have 8 bits we are interested in.
The probability of there being at least one bit in error of
1-(999/1000)^8 which is about 0.008.  If we introduce parity, which
will detect an odd number of errors, then we have a probability of
non-detection of an error of
28*0.999^6*0.001^2+70*0.999^4*0.001^4+28*0.999^2*0.001^6+0.001^8 which
is about 0.000028, ie it is a probability which is about 300 times
better than without parity.

And of course, if you know something more about the probability model
of the error processes, then you can design your redundancy so that
the probabilities do much better!  Parity is in some ways a simple
minded approach, so you would probably want to use something more
sophisticated for error checking, but even with that we do quite well
(unless of course you have an error process that generates errors in
pairs!)

So I don't accept your point about not gaining much by doing a verify.
If your point was valid, then there wouldn't be much point in md5sum
checks either!

&gt; Even if you do compare the data immediately, what about spontaneous
&gt; disk decay?  Your data has been copied and verified as correct, _then_
&gt; your data goes faulty (admittedly this takes a while to happen, but
&gt; again it's a non-zero chance).  Normally, disk block checksums pick
&gt; that up, but see above.

Okay, I suppose I'm a bit ignorant about the relative risks.  I had
thought that copying a whole partition (a large one) to another
partition may be a slightly more risky operation than most others.
But I might be quite wrong about this.  I don't have parity RAM, and I
assumed that the reason parity RAM exists is because there is the
occasional error that occurs.  Given that I don't have parity RAM, I
thought that perhaps for more risky operations, it might be
advantageous to use some software checks.  But perhaps I haven't got
an accurate perspective of the relative risks.

&gt; &gt; For example if you have RAM corruption happening (and don't have
&gt; &gt; parity RAM), then disk I/O won't pick it up.
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't the moral here to run parity RAM?  (Actually, the moral is
&gt; to run ECC; see above ...).

Well that's a good question.  How important is having parity RAM?
What are the risks?  And secondly, given that I don't have parity RAM,
what are ways of reducing my risk exposure to it.  Having cp do error
checking is one way.

&gt; &gt; And besides, what if you don't know how good your disk
&gt; &gt; I/O driver and hardward do things?
&gt; 
&gt; So you'll be reading the cached contents of what you've just written.
&gt; Cosy.  Or you'll trust the driver that just wrote the block incorrectly
&gt; to read it back correctly.  Cosier.

You don't need to trust the driver --- if it makes an error reading it
back as well, the error is still likely to be detected (using
something more sophisticated than parity).

As for the cache stuff, I think the same comment applies.  Except that
perhaps the data only gets written to cache not to the disk?  Can you
force a flush to disk or something?

&gt; Risk in computing is a funny thing.

True.  I suppose the real issue is, how much risk is there in copying
around large filesystems?  Is it worth taking special measures to
check for errors when doing so?

&gt; &gt; Michael Neuling just sent me (and to the list) a good way of doing an
&gt; &gt; integrity check by hand using md5sum.  Why not have cp do something
&gt; &gt; like this itself, or at least have it as an option?
&gt; 
&gt; Because Michael's method is built from tools that makes Unix king
&gt; over NT.  Or is this a trick question designed to flush out my fake
&gt; MCSE?

What is MCSE?

&gt; &gt; I can't see why the idea is absurd and warrants a beating!
&gt; 
&gt; David is probably itching to try out his new cat o' nine tails
&gt; he smuggled back through customs.

I'd better watch myself then! :-)

Mark.
