Win NT/2K requires machine accounts to be set up in the PDC prior to
connecting to the domain.  I don't know the low-level details (if someone
does and I've got it wrong, please feel free to correct me), but it goes
something like this--the administrator of the windos domain sets up a name
in the PDC, the new machine registers in the domain with that particular
name at which point the PDC somehow links that machine name with the MAC
address of the NIC.  This is a security feature so someone can't set up an
"imposter" of a fileserver--that name only works with that NIC.  Win 98 just
broadcasts a name saying "I'm here, feel free to connect to me" but NT/2K is
a bit more secure about that.  I'm sorry to say I don't know how to create
an account in Samba (I've never used Samba as a PDC) but hopefully this will
point you in the right direction--try to find a way to register the Win 2K
machine's name in the Samba PDC prior to registering the box with the domain
and I think you'll be all set.  Good luck.

Subject: Samba PDC Problem


Hi Everyone,

For the past six months or so i've had a Samba server running quite nicely
as a PDC with all Win98 clients attached to it. However, today I installed a
new Win2k box on the network, and it refuses to connect to the domain. I can
telnet into the linux box okay from the win2k box, and ping all other pc's
on the network, but when I try and attach to the domain it says account
doesn't exist in the domain. What have I done wrong ??

... oh, and I think it's using Samba 2.0.6 or 2.0.7 ...

Cheers,
Jeremy
