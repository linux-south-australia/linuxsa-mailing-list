:-)

&gt; And I understand you could probably divide a single disk into two
&gt; partitions and do partition mirroring.  Is this right?

No.  Normally drives fail totally, not partially, so this gains
you nothing, at the expense of halving your available disk space.

&gt; Is RAID of any use with a single disk, using multiple partitions?

Nyet - see above.

&gt; There is also LVM (Linux Volume Management I think it stands for)

"Logical Volume Manage(r|ment)", unless Linux have employed
Microsoft Marketeers.

&gt; which allows you to have virtual volumes.  I believe it allows more
&gt; flexibility than RAID, but I'm not sure if it does redundancy stuff.

LVM has traditionally allowed "logical" volumes to be build out
of individual blocks of disk (but larger than a disk block; typically
several megs in size).  It supports both aggregate disk size (so you
can build a "disk" that's as large as all your disks added together),
and supports mirroring to multiple disk sets and striping.  Very funky,
and most of the big Unices use this.  Not sure what the state of the
art is for Linux LVM currently.

&gt; One problem with RAID redundancy, is that although it allows you to
&gt; survive a disk crash, it doesn't check for corruption of data.

This is where you would use something like Tripwire or Veracity.
