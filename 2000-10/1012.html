&gt;  &gt; Traffic and set up costs probably cost more than 6 phone calls a day for a

&gt;  &gt; Cos seems to be avlid reason to me.
&gt;  
&gt; 6 x $0.25 x 365 = $547.50
&gt; 
&gt; Plus the $20 - 40 per month you're probably paying for your net access
&gt; (let's be middle-of-the-road and say that's costing you $300 per year).
&gt; 
&gt; So all up you're spending nearly $900 per year on Internet access.
&gt; And you claim you're doing it that way to save you money.
&gt; 

Now do the sums for a fairly constant download  say a napster kid or a
warez junky on a 56k modem at say 18 cents a meg.

The dial up option.
A $30 leach acount a 6 phone calls a day does not sound too bad.
$360 account access.
2190 phone calls @ 40cents ( I don't know how much a local call is these
days - I actually suspect it is cheaper)
$876.
line ~ $20 a month?
$240

Total $1476


The permament otpion:
Whereas say 10 meg an hour * 18 cents a meg * 24 hours *365 days.
10*.18*24*365 =$15768.

Admittedly  most people probably don't won't suck
down that much, however even if you only sucked down 10% of that you are
still loking better than a permantnet link, for which cost I hanve't
factored in line rental, or any calls, though these are admitedly likely
to be few.

On the other hand you can get more than 10meg an hour with a56K mdoem.
And data is not usually .18 a meg for most people.

I also acknowledge taht many accoutns have a 200 or so meg download limti
after you get chanrge 20 cnets or more for data, btu then again soem ahve
no download limit (after all with a nice set of sqirm redirectors anda
fat cache how much is the data really costing the isp?)

If you can come up with better pricing, then let me
know.
I have two friends who both recently got leach accounts to compliemtn
their dial up permanent links with telstra direct/advacnde/whatever it si 
these days.

One of them sucked down 300 meg last weekend -  he likes to try differnet
distros.

Can you suggest any where you can suck down 1200 meg for about $30 a
month on a permanent link?
Because they and I would both love to take that option up thanks.

Another scenario. The games player, say 10 meg an hour(a delieberate under
estimate - I think is really 12 -14 meg), 19 cents a meg, 4 hours a nights
4 nights a week, probably one call per night if you live in the metro
area.
(.19*40) + 40  $8 a night.
4 nigths a week $32.
52 weeks a year 
$32 *52
=$1664

Already exceeds your $976,and that is without MP3s, web surfing and
sending those godawful 10 meg attachemnts these people love to send.

And you claim a pemrant link is cheaper.

Like I said I can see a case for a $30 or $40 dollar a month account and 6
redials a day.

Not for all applications and not for all peopel but a peemanent link is
not necessarily cheaper if you suck data.

I think I have given a couple  scenarios that show that the permanet link
can be and typcially is more expensive.

Most fo the peopel I knwo with permanet linsk are failry careful about how
much they sue the net and use it less than they moght othwerise because of
dat charges.

And if you can disprove me, by offering me a permanent account that
for $50 or less a month lets me suck down over a gig a month with noe exta
data charges , then you have yourself a new subscriber, and I would be happy 
to retract my claims. 
(and quite possibly kiss your #$! in victroia square*)

I am not however holding my breath.
