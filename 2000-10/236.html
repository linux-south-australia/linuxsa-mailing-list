I'm thinking of buying one of the new IBM Deskstar 7200 RPM ATA/100
hard drives, and this has got me thinking about the best way of
managing it.

I am thinking that if I got a 20 or 30 meg drive, I would have room to
spare, so why not introduce some redundancy to allow for error
checking and correction.  That is, rather than having to do backups,
wouldn't it be nice if the filesystem did it implicitly in some way.

As I understand it, RAID does this in some crude way.  That is, you
can do disk mirroring.  And I understand you could probably divide a
single disk into two partitions and do partition mirroring.  Is this
right?  Alternatively, aren't their other versions of RAID which allow
different levels of redundancy than mirroring --- ie instead of a
ratio of 2:1, you could have 5:4 or something?

Is RAID of any use with a single disk, using multiple partitions?

There is also LVM (Linux Volume Management I think it stands for)
which allows you to have virtual volumes.  I believe it allows more
flexibility than RAID, but I'm not sure if it does redundancy stuff.

One problem with RAID redundancy, is that although it allows you to
survive a disk crash, it doesn't check for corruption of data.
Presumably you could combine RAID with something like ReiserFS or
ext3.  Anyone have any comments about this, or the stability of
ReiserFS etc?

The other possibility is the use of Coda.  The main advantage of coda
is that it is designed to work well with a laptop.  If I want have my
laptop and main computer share the same file system, Coda can do this.
If I take my laptop away for a while, and then later reconnect it to
my network, Coda will syncronize the file systems for me.

So.  My main problem is that there seem to be lots of interrelated
technologies out there, and I'm still trying to come to grips with how
they all work and interrelate, and how stable they each are, and what
solutions are best.  I just thought I'd send out this email to get
some feedback and people's ideas etc.

Cheers,

Mark.
