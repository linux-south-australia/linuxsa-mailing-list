Hi Darryl,

&gt; Just FYI, I have a eepro100 on an Intel motherboard working with
&gt; a stock RedHat 6.2.

Thanks for that - so it will fire up, at least in some cases.

I compiled and installed the current skyld drivers but no joy.

I've been tinkering some more and am starting to think I just
have a hardware fault - strange, as the previous install was
working when the box was pulled, but I suppose it can happen.
Interestingly the Realtek PCI adapter (one of those Acer
ALN-300s) shows it's got a link beat immediately after power
up, before the non-bios boot process gets started, and I was
under the impression that most ethernet adapters were able to 
get to the point of link beat without requiring any setup 
from the drivers.  The eepro100 chip has some fancy power
management though, so I suppose it may be different.

I think I'll cut my losses and put another adapter in, but
I was hoping to avoid that as there are only two PCI slots.
Could get a dual card, I suppose.

Got an opinion on the "best" PCI 10/100 card at a moderate
price?

Thanks for the reply!

Cheers, Dieter.
