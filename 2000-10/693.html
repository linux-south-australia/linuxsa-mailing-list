Hi All,

This is probably a little off topic but what the heck !

You're all probably sick of those commercials for the "World's Best Address"
and more recently "Adelaide's Most Pretigious Address", but you should try
living here.  Telstra has somehow managed to perpetuate on of the biggest
joke's on the residents of these beautiful suburbs (considering that most of
Telstra's infrastructure in the area has been commissioned since 1994).  The
golden grove development consists of three suburbs, Wynn Vale, Golden Grove
and Greenwith, within the development there are over 10,000 houses with most
of the recent development in Greenwith and of course the luxury Spring Hill,
which is located right on the Golden Grove/Greenwith border (and accross the
creek from my place).  As far as number of dwellings, Greenwith appears to
be the larger suburb and is still expanding.

Now here's the rub - the majority of residents in Greenwith and Spring Hill
have their phones serviced off the Greenwith AXE RAU, this is an AXE Remote
Access Unit which is parented off one of the major Adelaide CBD exchanges.
In itself this is not a problem, but Telstra then decided to use RIM's to
provide the phone services to the end user, which means most residents
cannot get higher than a 28.8K modem connection and can dream about such
things as ADSL and ISDN.

Here's how it works, the entire development is full of fibre optic cabling
(just dream about the Gigabits of capacity) and this is used to cable the
RIM's to the GWTH RAU.  From each RIM, standard copper twisted pair is used
for the local loop to each house.  Sound's great doesn't it, lots of clean
digital channels between the RAU and each RIM and then literally metre's of
new copper cable to each house.  Think again, Telstra decided to use non
integrated RIMs which means that the local copper loop is converted to
digital at the RIM, the signal is then transmitted through the fibre optic
cable to the RAU where it is converted back to analogue and fed into the
standard analogue exchange ports of the RAU.  These two analogue to digital
conversions are what restricts the modem to a theoretical limit of 31.2K but
more realisticly 28.8K.  If Telstra had used integrated RIMs then the RIM
would be digitally connected to the RAU, thus eliminating the second A/D
conversion and allowing 56K modem operation, also ISDN services would be
available right now and ADSL would only require adding new cards to each of
the RIMs and not changing all the interfacing infrastructure at the RAU end.

Back to ADSL, Telstra wasn't planning to provide ADSL to Golden Grove - the
service was going to stop at the Modbury exchange.  However, according to
their web site, Telstra is now reviewing the provision of ADSL from the
Golden Grove exchange.  This will make most residents of Golden Grove and
Wynn Vale happy, but it still leaves the residents of Greenwith and Spring
Hill out in the cold.  Perhaps somebody should inform the investors on
Spring Hill who are building their 300K plus mansions of the situation.
More to the point, somebody should tell Telstra about the levels of
disposable income in the area, income which could be spent on ADSL.

Bottom line, perhaps all of us Greenwith residents should consider swapping
our 56K modems with anybody who has a 28.8K modem to offer and who can use
speeds in excess of 28.8K.  In the meantime I can continue dreaming about
the Gigs of capacity buried behind my back fence, and put up with my 28.8K
and Telstra's continual offers to put a Satellite dish on my roof !!!!  Now
don't even get me started with regards to cable services.....  I'll be quite
happy to switch all my phone services over to any carrier who can plug me
into the digital age !!!!!!

Regards,

Richard
