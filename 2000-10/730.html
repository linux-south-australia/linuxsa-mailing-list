I recently saw that Motorola have released a new phone, The Accompli A6188
(<A HREF="http://shop.motorola.com.sg/cgi-bin/directaus.storefront/446733963/UserTemp">http://shop.motorola.com.sg/cgi-bin/directaus.storefront/446733963/UserTemp</A>
late/16 should get you there, after a few more clicks...) It seems to be a
PDA and mobile phone rolled into one, and allows you to interact with your
MS Exchange inbox live... Wondering if anyone know a great deal about it, or
similar technologies...

specifically:

Does it work with a real mail server? (it uses WAP, but I don't know enough
to know whether this means you can interact with any generic mail server or
not)
Does mail access cost you (ie are you dialing somewhere, or is it an
always-on free or realistically cheap service?)
Do I need to do anything specific to my mail server, or does it just need to
be accessible on the net?
Does the PDA part of the device have the capability to be programmed (ie if
I don't like the apps on there, or I want another app, can I d/l it from
somewhere, like you can with palms?)
How close to Palm is the PDA? Being a Motorola Phone, and Motorola having an
equity interest in palm, and having recently announced collaboration on a
Palm PDA/phone, and Palms running on the Motorola Dragonball 68k processor,
this could be likely... I do doubt that it's PalmOS though -- they'd make a
point out of it if it was...

I will probably contact Motorola to find some of this out, if no-one here
already knows...

Does anyone know of any other PDA/phones with email access about? I don't
like the Nokia 9110 keyboard style one...
