&gt; * The Question: Why?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand why people would do this, unless it gave them
&gt; access to something they didn't have (eg. porn, which may be the case)
&gt; or acted as an anonomiser.. we have the squid logs and hence a list of
&gt; IP addresses.

Try a trace for these IP addresses, and you'll most likely find a number
of them terminate in Japan somewhere. For some reason Australian proxies
are very popular there, presumably to circumvent firewalls or censorship
software. Try using a search engine to query for your proxy's IP address
and hostname, you might find it in a list of web proxies somewhere. Some
of these pages used to have details on why they were using them, but
unfortunately I cannot read Japanese, nor does my browser understand the
encoding.

Proxies can also be used to take advantage of cheaper routes at your
expense if you're not careful. If you're on a peering network, or even
an ISP like connect.com that has free local traffic, someone can use
your proxy to fetch data for them, so their cost is zero while you pay
for the data!

Keep an eye on some of the new "cache appliances" too .. some of them
are designed to only do transparent proxying, however if you set your
browser up to use them as a proxy on port 80, they tend to work, and
have no access restrictions either (since they're only expecting traffic
to come to them as intercepted TCP packets).
