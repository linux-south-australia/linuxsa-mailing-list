Have you heard about OnRamp Home Highway?  It costs $173 to convert an
existing phone line into an OnRamp Home Highway ISDN circuit, which
gives you a standard 2B+D basic-rate ISDN service.

(Local) Voice calls are $0.18 each, rental is somewhere in the vicinity
of $50 per month.

The NT1 they provide has four sockets on the back:  2 PSTN (phone) sockets
for a standard phone and a fax machine or modem (if you wish), a normal
ISDN NT1/TA socket which you can plug a router, a TA or an ISDN card into,
and (get this) a DB-9 RS-232 port you can plug your computer into.

The RS-232 port speaks AT commands (like a modem).  You can make ISDN 
data calls by sending an ATDTphone-number sequence to it.  It also
understands PPP encapsulation:  If appropriately configured, it can 
monitor the bandwidth in use, and when it passes 64k it'll transparently
bring up the other B-channel to give you a 128k call.  

The down side is that data calls (i.e.: those made by typing ATDTxxxxxxxx
on the serial port, or calls made on the TA port which are tagged as data
calls) are charged at about $1.00 per hour.  The good news is that if you
have an ISDN card in your PC, or an appropriately-specced router, you can
run ISDN "Data-over-voice", where the dialling device makes a call which
is marked as a voice ($0.18) call, but which passes data traffic.  This is
perfectly legal, it works, you just need the right equipment for it -- There
are lots of ISDN cards for PCs which support it, and Cisco routers with
a recent enough version of IOS do it too.

Finally, because you have two 64k B-channels, you can be using the 'net at
64k and talking on the phone at the same time.  If there's a 128k call
running through the DB-9 serial port, it'll detect and incoming voice call
and transparently drop a 64k channel to make room for the call, instead of
generating a busy-signal.

It's available on most PSTN phone lines;  The only challenge is getting
to talk to someone inside Telstra who (a) knows what it is, and (b) knows
how to sell it (no small feat, but it is possible).  Once you have it,
though, you have the ability to make a 128k Internet connection for $0.36
plus ISP costs.

 &gt; BTW I was recently told it cost the govt's Internet In Schools project 
 &gt; ~$36,000 to get a 64k ISDN into the local primary school.

The nice thing about ORHH is that they don't need any additional cable 
to run it (strictly speaking they don't need additional cable to run 
OR2 either, but they pretend they do so that they can extort $36,000 
installation fees out of you when it suits their purposes)
