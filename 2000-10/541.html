&gt;Cryptographers have been trying to crack MD5 and SHA ever 
&gt;since they were
&gt;proposed.  SHA especially is considered unbeatable.  Sure, 
&gt;it's not 100%, but's
&gt;it's more likely that you'll be hit by a meteor in the shower 
&gt;tomorrow morning
&gt;than a SHA digest not detecting errors.  It's simply not going 
&gt;to happen.

but it's still not 100%. I'm part-mathematician, and there is a difference
between 100% and 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999%

&gt;&gt;                      David also has a ood point about the 

&gt;Theoretically speaking there is always the possibility.  In 
&gt;practice you can
&gt;ALWAYS ignore that chance.
&gt;
&gt;I think our positions are converging.

Yes -- but remember, it's all about probabilities, and conditions can change
that will change the real-life application of those probabilities. EG:
consider how secure a 64 bit key used to be, and how secure it is now. The
likelyhood of guessing the key hasn't changed, but the technology has.
mechanisms for checking integrity that were ok years ago are no longer
valid, as the technoilogy has changed, so there are other problems now that
we didn't used to have.
