&gt; I woke up this mornig with great ambitions of installing Window ME
&gt; onto the third hard drive in my PC, but I cannot get lilo to like the 
&gt; third drive. It spits this error when I execute lilo;
&gt; 
&gt; Added linux *
&gt; Added win
&gt; Warning: BIOS drive 0x82 may not be accessible
&gt; Added me

You would be referring to the line that says, "Warning".  A warning is not
an error.  If it was an error it would likely say, "Error".  According to
<A HREF="http://dictionary.com">http://dictionary.com</A>, a warning is, "To notify or apprise in advance;" but
I would have said it is a suggestion to you that there might be a problem,
and perhaps giving you some useful background advice pertaining thereto.

Suppose lilo said "Warning: BIOS drive 0x82 may not be accessible" and you
later found that your machine hangs when booting W/me, or gives an error,
perhaps "NO ROM BASIC", while booting: you should immediately think, "oh,
perhaps the third drive is not accessible with this BIOS!"  On the other
hand, if everything works perfectly you might well say, "great, it looks
like it's working!" and, in the fullness of time, you might forget you ever
saw that warning.

You didn't actually say whether you tried to boot W/me after lilo, but you
implied (by saying that it booted if you switched the drive to primary
master) that you did try and that it didn't work.  What's the full story?
