A friend has asked me to refer this Email to this group. A position is
vacant for someone with skills in (among other things) Linux. I recommend
this role to someone that's got good mojo in Linux, with confidence in SCO
and ORACLE. Some small history in scripting/programming would be good. It's
a Win98 desktop environment, but the servers are linux based. The Novell
fileserver is right now being replaced with a Samba/Linux solution.
Applications should come in today.

Information Support Manager

Our client is a large manufacturer of food products in South Australia and
interstate. A vacancy has arisen for an Information Support Manager
opportunity within the organisation. The scope of the position is broad in
its nature, however, it essentially covers ongoing systems management as
well as help desk support for upto 45 users. It also covers IT projects and
new developments. Specifically, the successful candidate will need to
administer the Linux/SCO Unix environment including all aspects of internet
services and databases, install, maintain and troubleshoot desktop
computers, provide reports and queries of the Oracle database, support the
remote fish Access database, provide technical assistance for the phone
system and organise and recommend computing equipment and consumables stock.
Essentially, the person needs strong Unix administration skills, good
windows based desktop knowledge, strong understanding of Internet Security,
knowledge of Oracle SQL and Excel VBA, skill with Samba file sharing and
Sendmail/postfix mail administration. It is expected that they will have at
least 3-4 years experience in a commercial environment. The position reports
to the group accountant, but it is expected that the successful person will
work autonomously and with little supervision. Energy, self-motivation,
flexibility and the ability to relate well to internal users and external
suppliers is critical. This is a role that offers great rewards and
challenges for those willing to take the next step in their career. Energy,
self-motivation, flexibility and the ability to relate well to internal
users and external suppliers is critical.
