28.8k, how lucky are you.
I live near a town called Bungendore and we are lucky to get 9.6k.
Every time it rains the speed drops to  2.4k.
What ever happened to Digital by 2000.
I still cannot believe that we are living in country that cannot get its
communications infrastructure sorted out.
I suppose I should be greatful that I only have to share by line with about
6 or 8 others.

Regards
Phil Garbode

		Hi All,

		This is probably a little off topic but what the heck !

		You're all probably sick of those commercials for the
"World's Best Address"
		and more recently "Adelaide's Most Pretigious Address", but
you should try
		living here.  Telstra has somehow managed to perpetuate on
of the biggest
		joke's on the residents of these beautiful suburbs
(considering that most of
		Telstra's infrastructure in the area has been commissioned
since 1994).  The
		golden grove development consists of three suburbs, Wynn
Vale, Golden Grove
		and Greenwith, within the development there are over 10,000
houses with most
		of the recent development in Greenwith and of course the
luxury Spring Hill,
		which is located right on the Golden Grove/Greenwith border
(and accross the
		creek from my place).  As far as number of dwellings,
Greenwith appears to
		be the larger suburb and is still expanding.

		Now here's the rub - the majority of residents in Greenwith
and Spring Hill
		have their phones serviced off the Greenwith AXE RAU, this
is an AXE Remote
		Access Unit which is parented off one of the major Adelaide
CBD exchanges.
		In itself this is not a problem, but Telstra then decided to
use RIM's to
		provide the phone services to the end user, which means most
residents
		cannot get higher than a 28.8K modem connection and can
dream about such
		things as ADSL and ISDN.

		Here's how it works, the entire development is full of fibre
optic cabling
		(just dream about the Gigabits of capacity) and this is used
to cable the
		RIM's to the GWTH RAU.  From each RIM, standard copper
twisted pair is used
		for the local loop to each house.  Sound's great doesn't it,
lots of clean
		digital channels between the RAU and each RIM and then
literally metre's of
		new copper cable to each house.  Think again, Telstra
decided to use non
		integrated RIMs which means that the local copper loop is
converted to
		digital at the RIM, the signal is then transmitted through
the fibre optic
		cable to the RAU where it is converted back to analogue and
fed into the
		standard analogue exchange ports of the RAU.  These two
analogue to digital
		conversions are what restricts the modem to a theoretical
limit of 31.2K but
		more realisticly 28.8K.  If Telstra had used integrated RIMs
then the RIM
		would be digitally connected to the RAU, thus eliminating
the second A/D
		conversion and allowing 56K modem operation, also ISDN
services would be
		available right now and ADSL would only require adding new
cards to each of
		the RIMs and not changing all the interfacing infrastructure
at the RAU end.

		Back to ADSL, Telstra wasn't planning to provide ADSL to
Golden Grove - the
		service was going to stop at the Modbury exchange.  However,
according to
		their web site, Telstra is now reviewing the provision of
ADSL from the
		Golden Grove exchange.  This will make most residents of
Golden Grove and
		Wynn Vale happy, but it still leaves the residents of
Greenwith and Spring
		Hill out in the cold.  Perhaps somebody should inform the
investors on
		Spring Hill who are building their 300K plus mansions of the
situation.
		More to the point, somebody should tell Telstra about the
levels of
		disposable income in the area, income which could be spent
on ADSL.

		Bottom line, perhaps all of us Greenwith residents should
consider swapping
		our 56K modems with anybody who has a 28.8K modem to offer
and who can use
		speeds in excess of 28.8K.  In the meantime I can continue
dreaming about
		the Gigs of capacity buried behind my back fence, and put up
with my 28.8K
		and Telstra's continual offers to put a Satellite dish on my
roof !!!!  Now
		don't even get me started with regards to cable
services.....  I'll be quite
		happy to switch all my phone services over to any carrier
who can plug me
		into the digital age !!!!!!

		Regards,

		Richard
