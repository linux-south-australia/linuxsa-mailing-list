&gt; Without retyping the entire post, it comes down to scale (there are things
&gt; you can do at the file level better than at the block level), and the
&gt; particular compromise that a program is trying to acheive (ie kernel is
&gt; optimised for speed, and you don't neccessarily want to be performing an
&gt; expensive md5sum on each block).

If you *need* md5 on each block then you certainly do want the kernel to do it.
Md5 is not too complicated for the kernel, the idea is too stupid.

There's now a kernel http daemon, which I just read about in a magazine, so if
you, like me, view the "appropriate balance" through ten year old glasses perhaps
our opinions are out of date.  It seems that heavy tasks do belong in the kernel.
Well it seems there can be a persuasive argument for it; such as "if you *need*
md5 on each block [blah blah blah]"


&gt; IMHO, it would be best to have the kernel optimised for speed, and perhaps doing
&gt; very very cheap and basic error checking, where it is needed and is cheap enough
&gt; to be acceptable. cp should copy and nothing else.

I do agree with you in this, although I think the "basic error checking" is quite
sophisticated.  I forget the error rate of 16 bit CRCs, but it's suprisingly low.
32 bit CRCs are hugely better.  What does a disk controller use?
