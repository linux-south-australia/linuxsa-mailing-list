&gt;Sorry; missed your other post.  Explain again why you can put 
&gt;something into one
&gt;program (ie cp), but not into another (ie kernel.)

Without retyping the entire post, it comes down to scale (there are things
you can do at the file level better than at the block level), and the
particular compromise that a program is trying to acheive (ie kernel is
optimised for speed, and you don't neccessarily want to be performing an
expensive md5sum on each block). IMHO, it would be best to have the kernel
optimised for speed, and perhaps doing very very cheap and basic error
checking, where it is needed and is cheap enough to be acceptable. cp should
copy and nothing else. md5sum and others like it should do error checking.
The Unix way is to have a good set of tools, each of which does one thing
really well, and many ways of combining them. That way, if you need to copy
a file fast, you can, but if you want to be 99.99999% sure that it's
correct, you can. Basically, an expensive operation like md5sum can increase
the probability that a file is correct better than you can do in the kernel,
because that's what it's for... :)
