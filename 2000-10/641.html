Jeez and I thought I was OLD, dont suppose you worked on plug boards?

&gt;&gt; Right from the very beginning, it was assumed that you could
&gt;&gt; use 16 and 32 bit ints as arguments, and that all floating point
&gt;&gt; was sent as 64-bit double float, and that you could send
&gt;&gt; whole structs on the stack.
&gt;
&gt;Bugger, it's all come back to me in a flash and you're right.
&gt;
&gt;The assumption was that all parameters were word-aligned, but
&gt;the return value had to be word sized (so that the caller
&gt;could blindly stack the items, as you suggested).
&gt;
&gt;That's why you could pass a struct but couldn't return one.
&gt;
&gt;And, of course, if you stuffed the parameters or their types,
&gt;then the program would SEGV with a stack out of bounds if you
&gt;were lucky, rather than returning a compile error as happens
&gt;with prototypes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[massive aside follows]
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I think that 32-bit machine were still a novelty when
&gt;&gt; ANSI was starting to be worked on.
&gt;
&gt;Depends upon the world you lived in.  Sun, Apollo were
&gt;32-bit 68000 machines with virtual memory, although access
&gt;to them was predominately through terminals or from PCs
&gt;on thin ethernet if you were lucky.  The MicroVAX was out.
&gt;The IBM PC/AT was out, with 16-bit 80286 with real memory
&gt;and the start of the bizaare "near"/"far" addressing.
&gt;Whitesmiths and Microsoft were the major compilers for DOS,
&gt;cc and pcc for UNIX.  VMS was still the best environment.
&gt;
&gt;C was still a novelty outside of the UNIX world, Turbo Pascal
&gt;ruled and was heaps easier to use.  The year before I had
&gt;been typing COBOL on a 3270 terminal, submitting the compile
&gt;to a batch compile queue, logging off, and collecting the
&gt;printout of my compile from the printery.  I'd then carefully
&gt;mark up the changes and try to do it again.  Login time, CPU
&gt;use, I/O use and print lines were limited.  A single program that
&gt;infinitely looped would usually use most of your CPU and
&gt;print lines for the semester and would usually lead to you
&gt;failing.  I passed with 1 print lines remaining, and I still
&gt;feel lucky about that.
&gt;
&gt;About two years later I worked for a government department
&gt;that whilst it had a login time limit of an hour a day, had
&gt;no CPU or print lines limits.  I thought I was in heaven.
