&gt;Have you heard about OnRamp Home Highway?  It costs $173 to convert an
&gt;existing phone line into an OnRamp Home Highway ISDN circuit, which
&gt;gives you a standard 2B+D basic-rate ISDN service.
&gt;
&gt;(Local) Voice calls are $0.18 each, rental is somewhere in the vicinity
&gt;of $50 per month.

Actually, $39 per month including $5 worth of calls, making it a similar
price to having 2 phone lines. The Onramp2 service (which must surely be
redundant now for non-Xpress applications) is $50/month.

&gt;It's available on most PSTN phone lines;  The only challenge is getting
&gt;to talk to someone inside Telstra who (a) knows what it is, and (b) knows
&gt;how to sell it (no small feat, but it is possible).  Once you have it,
&gt;though, you have the ability to make a 128k Internet connection for $0.36
&gt;plus ISP costs.

According to the Onramp FAQ at <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/onramp/faq.htm">http://www.telstra.com.au/onramp/faq.htm</A> ,
Onramp services are available to 96% of Australians. While you'd assume that
figure to be geography related, it actually means that it's available to the
96% of Australians who are content with their PSTN lines and think that ISDN
is something you find on the side of a library book.

The other 4% who would actually appreciate this service will be convinced
that it isn't available for them after trying to order it through Telstra,
only to be told they can't have it, or have their order cancelled without
notification when they think it's on the way.
