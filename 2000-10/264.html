&gt; I'm thinking of buying one of the new IBM Deskstar 7200 RPM ATA/100

&gt; managing it.
&gt; 
&gt; I am thinking that if I got a 20 or 30 meg drive, I would have room to
&gt; spare, so why not introduce some redundancy to allow for error
&gt; checking and correction.  That is, rather than having to do backups,
&gt; wouldn't it be nice if the filesystem did it implicitly in some way.
&gt; 
&gt; As I understand it, RAID does this in some crude way.  That is, you
&gt; can do disk mirroring.  And I understand you could probably divide a
&gt; single disk into two partitions and do partition mirroring.  Is this
&gt; right?  Alternatively, aren't their other versions of RAID which allow
&gt; different levels of redundancy than mirroring --- ie instead of a
&gt; ratio of 2:1, you could have 5:4 or something?
&gt; 
&gt; Is RAID of any use with a single disk, using multiple partitions?


You probably wnt get much redundancy out of this set up.
Since the partitions live on the smae physical disk, they are vulnerable
to teh same sorts of poroblems if a disk fails.
Eg if you get a power surge or a head crash, you have lost both copies.

There may also be a performance hit as you will be puttign twice the data
down the one bus.

The Software raid FAQs/HOPWTO specificially say you shoudl put you disks
on different busses.


Having said all that, althoughit may be pointless, I think it is possible
to do. But I really think it will be pointlesss.

If it is posssible to buy two (eg two 15gig disks instwead of one 30),
then RAID would probabaly be quite a reasonable way to get redundcancy.


&gt; 
&gt; There is also LVM (Linux Volume Management I think it stands for)
&gt; which allows you to have virtual volumes.  I believe it allows more
&gt; flexibility than RAID, but I'm not sure if it does redundancy stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; One problem with RAID redundancy, is that although it allows you to
&gt; survive a disk crash, it doesn't check for corruption of data.
&gt; Presumably you could combine RAID with something like ReiserFS or
&gt; ext3.  Anyone have any comments about this, or the stability of
&gt; ReiserFS etc?

That is true RAID is I beleive really a virtual device. It writes what it
is told.

I am not sure abouyt fancy file systems, never ever tried them.

I have played with software RAID 1 (mirroring) a bit though.


If you want help or to ask more RAID sepcific questions you might also
liek to ask the people on the RIAD mailing list.

This is the Linux RAID mailing list address:

<A HREF="mailto:linux-raid@vger.kernel.org">linux-raid@vger.kernel.org</A>

I think you add -subscribe to the username to it to subscribe but I am
not 100% sure.

It is major domo based so you can send email to
<A HREF="mailto:Majordomo@vger.kernel.org">Majordomo@vger.kernel.org</A>

with the word "help" inthe body to get details or the word "lists" in the
body to get a list of lists.

I found the people there very helpful.

Regards
Jason
