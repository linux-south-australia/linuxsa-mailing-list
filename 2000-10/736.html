&gt;I recently saw that Motorola have released a new phone, The Accompli A6188
&gt;(
<A HREF="http://shop.motorola.com.sg/cgi-bin/directaus.storefront/446733963/UserTemp">http://shop.motorola.com.sg/cgi-bin/directaus.storefront/446733963/UserTemp</A>
&gt;late/16 should get you there, after a few more clicks...) It seems to be a
&gt;PDA and mobile phone rolled into one, and allows you to interact with your
&gt;MS Exchange inbox live... Wondering if anyone know a great deal about it,
or
&gt;similar technologies...
&gt;
&gt;specifically:
&gt;
&gt;Does it work with a real mail server? (it uses WAP, but I don't know
enough
&gt;to know whether this means you can interact with any generic mail server
or
&gt;not)
I have not tried to read mail with the Accompli but to access a mail server
via WAP the mail server needs to be "WAP enabled".  That is it needs to
have an API for the WAP server to access the mail account.  This may be
built in to the server or can consist of scripts to get data out of the
server when the user clicks off a WAP link.

&gt;Does mail access cost you (ie are you dialing somewhere, or is it an
&gt;always-on free or realistically cheap service?)
At present WAP is accessed via a data call. This means you want to be rich
or be using the phone for business to afford the bills.  GPRS should be
coming out soon (both Telstra and Optus are working on rolling out their
networks).  It is a packet switched network that should only charge for the
data sent/recieved and hopefully this will be cheaper.

&gt;Do I need to do anything specific to my mail server, or does it just need
to
&gt;be accessible on the net?
This depends on who you get your phone service through.  Optus operate a
"walled garden" basically means it is an isolated private network.  i.e.
you cant get to an internet mail server.  Telstra do not have a walled
garden.
Also since WAP is accessed via a data call what companies do to access
their mail servers it to setup their own RAS.  They dial into that and
access their mail server via their own WAP gateway.

&gt;Does the PDA part of the device have the capability to be programmed (ie
if
&gt;I don't like the apps on there, or I want another app, can I d/l it from
&gt;somewhere, like you can with palms?)
No you can't download to the Accompli.

&gt;How close to Palm is the PDA? Being a Motorola Phone, and Motorola having
an
&gt;equity interest in palm, and having recently announced collaboration on a
&gt;Palm PDA/phone, and Palms running on the Motorola Dragonball 68k
processor,
&gt;this could be likely... I do doubt that it's PalmOS though -- they'd make
a
&gt;point out of it if it was...
The PDA part of the Accompli is very different to a Palm.  Seems like they
wrote or bought a different PDA interface to Palm's.  It is slow and having
used a Palm I did not like it.  The concept of a PDA/phone combination is
great but I would wait for a phone that really had a Palm PDA in it.
Motorola and Palm have announced an alliance to build a phone with a Palm
PDA in it. See <A HREF="http://www.palm.com/about/pr/092500.html">http://www.palm.com/about/pr/092500.html</A>
Also Handspring which makes a Palm OS compatible handheld called a Visor
have announced a phone addon for their handhelds.  See
<A HREF="http://www.handspring.com/products/visorphone/">http://www.handspring.com/products/visorphone/</A>
A couple of issues.  Handspring are not yet marketing in Australia (but
they have a store in Singapore).  Secondly the current phone add on only
works on the North American GSM frequencies.  Handspring expect to be
shipping a European (Australian) version "early next" year.  The whole
package sound great.  I would really like one :-)

&gt;
&gt;I will probably contact Motorola to find some of this out, if no-one here
&gt;already knows...
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of any other PDA/phones with email access about? I don't
&gt;like the Nokia 9110 keyboard style one...
Personally I would get a Palm and a phone with a data connection.  This way
you get a decent screen and data entry.  The Palm has or you can get lots
of software to connect to all types of mailservers so compatibility is not
an issue. I have used a Palm and a phone together for web/WAP surfing (via
a Linux RAS) and it works quite well.

Regards.
