Hi Richard,

&gt; I have heard it said that having Apache, SSL, and the FrontPage
extensions
&gt; will not work together. It would be interesting to see if you can get
them
&gt; to play together.

That's ominous.

Many versions back (like maybe four years) I had all of these
other than PGP and PostgreSQL working together on Solaris, but
those versions were really quite different back then - modules
weren't around IIRC, and the FP extensions were all CGI.

I certainly recall that it took years off my life making it all
work ;-)

&gt; In any event, why do you need the FrontPage extensions? Can't Samba do
what
&gt; you need?

Well personally I do most of my web work in vi but there are a
good number of people who like to do simple ongoing web site
maintenance with something like FrontPage, and the security
implications of offering samba shares on a globally visible IP
address make my flesh crawl (not that I mentioned that in my
original question).  I do advise people strongly against using
FP as anything more than a simple formatted text editor, and
to keep away from the widgets, but the upload facility seems
to be something they are comfortable with - I've given up on
trying to educate people who don't want to listen.

What I'm trying to do is settle on a config that I can get
reasonably familiar with and freeze for at least some time
so that I can spend more time on developing web stuff than
I spend on making the latest greatest releases work together.

A futile hope perhaps ;-)

Cheers, Dieter.
