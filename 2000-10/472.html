Thanks Darryl, 
I can't ping anything by name or IP, but my username/password is accepted
(as far as I know) because it doesn't reject them. The details box says I am
connected at x.xkbps and also says I have sent and recievd some bytes,
although small.

I use all the same settings/hardware on my Win98 box and don't have any
problems. I assume it is something I have not setup within Kppp or Linux.

Andrew

&gt; Why are both ends of the link in different networks? Things kinda don't
&gt; work under these circumstances ... IIRC

That is not actually a problem, as long as remote machines know to route 
your IP to the machine at the other end of your ppp link. It only needs to 
be in the same network if the remote end wants to use 'proxyarp'. This is 
the output of one of our ppp links (in this case to the commonwealth 
government). As you can see, they are on completely different networks:

ppp5      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          inet addr:165.12.40.43  P-t-P:144.130.45.225 
 Mask:255.255.255.255
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:11880 errors:255 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:255
          TX packets:10456 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:10

You have a route to the remote machine and you have a defaultroute pointing 
to that machine, so routing is correct.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have just configured my Linux RH6.2 box to dialup my ISP.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Have added all the DNS info, ph number, etc. Upon connecting
&gt; &gt;it does all the usual stuff, dials, answers, connects.  My problem
&gt; &gt;is that although I am connected (details show IP addresses for
&gt; &gt;remote and local computers, transfer of data in each direction -
&gt; &gt;although small) I can't actually access anything. I can't ping any
&gt; &gt;known machine, not even the said remote host.

Can you ping yourself using IP addresses, not names? What about the remote 
machine using the IP address (you didn't say whether you tried the IP 
address, or the dns name)

ping 203.38.195.1
ping 203.24.77.241

If you can ping the remote machine, can you ping a machine on the Internet 
by IP address? IE, try pinging 203.15.24.22 (a machine I administer which I 
know is up and running). Does that work. If that does work, then I would 
guess that your DNS is not set up correctly.

If you can ping yourself, but you can't ping the remote host, or any other 
host, then perhaps there is a problem with the remote server not routing 
correctly? Talking to the administrator of the remote machine while you 
connect can sometimes help, as they will be able to tell you whether they 
are accepting your username or not, and if routing is being set up 
correctly.
