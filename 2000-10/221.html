I acknowledge that this thread is stale by a couple of weeks, but as
I'm only just catching up I thought I might see if a few facts could
add life to this old story.

We were the second in Adelaide to get ADSL behind Daryl.  Ironic,
really, that the first two installations of a service that is geared
toward single Windows PC systems are both installed on Linux-based
networks.  Incidentally, we don't have the same drop-out problems that
Darryl has reported, other than a couple of unexplained failures and
one where Telstra's end broke.

Regarding the number of users, the "Acceptable Use Policy" clearly
says that if you're on a flat rate plan, you are not allowed to
connect to a network and you must pay for each additional user (you're
really buying another email address etc).  If you're on a volume-based
plan, it says "You may connect a local area network to the Service.";
you don't pay an additional fee per user unless you wish to have
additional email accounts etc.  IMHO, that's a fairly reasonable
policy.

Please don't think that I'm defending Telstra here in any way - in
fact I've found their support to be unhelpful almost to the point
of rudeness.

By the way, they won't provide technical support if you choose to
connect your ADSL line to a network.  I quote:

    "If a customer wishes to arrange a network, we must advise you
    that we do not support this arrangement (only as stand -alone PC)
    although you are able to make these arrangements. The customer can
    do this through a network consultancy firm.
    
    "Therefore, they can set up the network independently of us, but if
    they have problems we will not support them."

Most importantly from my point of view, they will not provide a static
IP so that we can run our mail and web services over the ADSL line.  I
don't know of any technical reason why this should be the case - I'd
be interested if anyone out there knows of one.

So far I haven't got an answer from them to say for sure if they ever
will provide static IP.

On a positive note, ADSL is a damn sight faster than a 56k modem and I'd
certainly recommend it to anyone as a relatively cheap higher
bandwidth alternative.
