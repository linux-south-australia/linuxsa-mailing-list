Greetings,

* The Situation: Open Squid Cache

A company that I do contract work for has had the following occur...
They received an abnormal bill for traffic last month, which turned
out to be web traffic.

They are running squid on their Linux firewall (setup before I got
there). The security policy is to proxies everything (via the TIS
toolkit). Forwarding of packets is denied, while the default for Input
and Output is allow.

Unfortunately, this ment that squid was open to requests from the
outside, which is exactly what has happened.  

* The Question: Why?

I don't understand why people would do this, unless it gave them
access to something they didn't have (eg. porn, which may be the case)
or acted as an anonomiser.. we have the squid logs and hence a list of
IP addresses. 
 
Option 1:

Not knowing how exactly how squid cache's work (regarding expiration)
could it be possible that there is material that no longer exists on
any particular website, but that migrates between caches?

Option 2:

Is this is a method for bypassing censorship software?

Option 3:

There is some benefit/fun/credos in making others suffer unnecessary
traffic? (I could point my finder at the ISP here, but they have been
reasonably helpful in the past.)
