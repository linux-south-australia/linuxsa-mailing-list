&gt; 
&gt; I believe that you can get a greater level of integation between java and
&gt; jsp than you can between php and other techiologies.
&gt; Ie I suspect you can have a more ocnsistent object model and
&gt; possibly re-use code more - eg you can have Java classes which can be
&gt; potentially accessed though jsp, servlets, jdbc, java applets and java
&gt; applicaitons, if neccesary using RMI, object serialisation or any of
&gt; the other nuermous and typcially easy to use Java APIs.

You don't mention that java can be a major PITA to setup for a web
server, especially in an ISP situation where virtual hosting is often
used. All the reusable objects need to be the correct version for
everyone's code (much like ASP objects), the mount points in apache are
visible to all virtual hosts, not just the one you're using, and
customers hear wonderful things about java and expect to be able to move
servlets between sites without a problem. Too bad that the customers
don't nessesarily have the source for the servlets and the database
strings are compiled in.. The jdk itself might not be available for your
version of glibc, and you're missing half of the objects considered
'normal'. Maybe things have gotten better since I last installed it..

Then just when you've tweaked it and surprised yourself at how it all
works, along comes a certain ecommerce provider that says "we don't
support java 1.2, please downgrade to 1.1 so you can use our antique
objects (and windows NT configuration system), make sure you grab the
supported slow Sun binaries and not any 3rd party stuff".

PHP by comparison is nearly as easy as configure, make, make install to
get a basic system up and running which will work for most pages. MySQL
support is usually included, so you can do database driven sites
out-of-the-box. Everything is as source, which makes it initally easy to
manage.
 
&gt; I have not heard of php implementations for the mac or windows, but I am
&gt; pretty sure you can get jsp for both of these platforms as well as
&gt; servlets - if nothing else you can run the java webserver on these paltforms
&gt; which i bleive supports all  of the technlogies I have mentioned.

PHP runs just fine on windows, lots of developers are using it that way.
There's a project on sourceforge to make php/apache/mysql available as a
single package for windows. I don't know anything about macs, but it
looks like php version 4 has some sort of servlets API in it .. which I
guess is the best of both worlds.
