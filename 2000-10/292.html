&gt;&gt; ...in particular "2&gt;&1".
&gt;
&gt; tells the shell to redirect stand error (2) to the same place as
&gt; standard output (1).

More or less correct; and one of only two such (ie correct) answers.  The
answer, by the way, is also in the manual.  Which page? as redirection is
not done by the command that you are invoking it obviously is not that
page.  The answer is "in the shell man page" (as others already pointed
out.)

Bash performs redirection in the order they appear, so

  foo 2&gt;&1 &gt; foo.out

is not the same as

  foo &gt; foo.out 2&gt;&1

The former puts stderr to the original stdout (which is probably where it
was anyway), and then directs stdout to the file, foo.out.  The latter
directs stdout to the file, foo.out, and then directs stderr to that same
file.

In fact "2&gt;&1" does not mean, "put stderr to the same place as stdout." It
actually means, "make stderr use the same file descriptor as stdout." The
difference is subtle but important.  Consider

  foo &gt; foo.out 2&gt; foo.out

suppose foo writes "line 1", "line 2" and "line 3" on stdout, and then
writes "error" on stderr.  The content of foo.out will be:

  error
  1
  line 2
  line 3

Every open file is represented (in the kernel) by a "file descriptor",
which is a table entry that identifies the file, and the current position
in the file (where the next read or write will occur), and whether you may
read, write and such.  When you say

  foo &gt; foo.out 2&gt;&1

you have only one descriptor.  Both stdout and stderr share that
descriptor.  When you say

  foo &gt; foo.out 2&gt; foo.out

you have two separate descriptors, both referring to the same file.
Remember that I said the descriptor maintains the current file position?
So when you write using stdout the position for stdout is updated: The next
write occurs after the previous one.  But when you later write to stderr,
it has it's own descriptor, thus it's own position in the file, and so it
overwrites the output from stdout.  With the shared descriptor (ie 2&gt;&1)
stdout and stderr become, in effect, aliases of each other; so it makes no
difference which one your write to.


ADVANCED NOTE FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN PROGRAMMING:

Shared descriptors can be used as a sneaky inter-process communication
facility.  Suppose you have two processes which share a file descriptor:
They can communicate with each other by positioning that shared descriptor.
(There doesn't even need to be any data written to disk.)  For example, if
the descriptor is moved to offset 1 it might mean "process 1 has control of
the modem"; and moving it to offset 2 might mean "process 2 has control of
the modem"; and moving it back to offset 0 might mean "the modem is
available."  (You could have more processes: offset 4 means "process 3 has
the modem"; offset 8 means "process 4 has it"; and so on.)  To gain control
of the modem simply advance the file offset by the appropriate number of
bytes and check that it ended up at the right place.  If it ended up at the
wrong place it means that the modem was already in use:

   ...
   lock = 1 &lt;&lt; (process - 1);
   if (lseek(modemlock, lock, SEEK_CUR) != lock)
   {
      lseek(modemlock, -lock, SEEK_CUR);
      /* modem already in use */
   }
   else
   {
      /* use the modem */
      lseek(modemlock, -lock, SEEK_CUR); /* release the modem */
   }
   ...
