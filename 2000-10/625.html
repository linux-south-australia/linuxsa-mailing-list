&gt; OK, so I have a Telstra Big Pond Direct dedicated modem connection at the

&gt; into this?  Assuming of course that I have a compatible ISDN card or router.

It should work ok as long as there are drivers available for linux to
suit the adapter. I couldn't say if Voice ISDN would work, I guess it
would depend on how much control over the ISDN signalling the driver
provides. The problem you have is that Bigpond are unlikely to support
the ISDN voice option, so you'll have to pay $1/hour/channel to connect,
which isn't much fun on a permanent link. Onramp Xpress at $275/month
for 64K is more appropriate.

&gt; Linux of course) would work?  The only question then would be whether
&gt; Telstra can get ISDN to our house in Littlehampton (Adelaide Hills - next to
&gt; Mt Barker).  As the best ordinary dial up speed I can get (using Dingo Blue
&gt; or Telstra Adelaide's POP) is 28.8k using a decent 56k modem, I suspect I'm
&gt; a fair distance from the local exchange as it is and may not be within the
&gt; maximum distance for std ISDN.

Adam Internet already have customers in Littlehampton connecting using
ORHH, so your odds are good (despite my earlier post :). They can offer
the Data-over-voice ISDN option to permanent links (so 2x18c gets you
128K untimed calls) but don't have it working for casual access just
yet.

I used to use a Microlink in Blakiston down the road, in a very rural
area, as testimony to the existance of ISDN in the bush. Hands up who
can remember which ISP used to run out of a shed near Nairne? :)
