&gt; James!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am currently using a re-compiled 2.2.17 kernel day to day, and the 2.4
is
&gt; &gt; 2.4.0test1 or 0.
&gt; &gt; All though the kernel is represented as a stable number, is it in fact
still
&gt; &gt; beta??
&gt;
&gt; I wonder what the test1 and test2 mean....scratches the head....:-P
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have noticed improved support for processors, PCMCIA and finally....
USB!
&gt; &gt; All this was in the stock kernel, no patches to download, but an
interesting
&gt; &gt; option was found.
&gt; &gt;  [Y / m / n ] "extended file system support" IE Ext2! i guess this is to
do
&gt; &gt; with something else to come, perhaps a patch for ReiserFS or similar.
&gt;
&gt; You won't have any glitches having two kernels on the system provided
&gt; you follow the instructions on how to install them (in
&gt; /usr/src/kernel-source/README). You may fall foul of programs that think
&gt; they're talking to a 2.2.X series kernel when you're running under
&gt; 2.4.0. Because it's a major number release it is allowed to break some
&gt; things. For example, ipchains for a 2.2.X series won't work under 2.4.0
&gt; without getting the very latest source (if it exists)...

Make sure you DONT use the new devfs system otherwise things wont work too
well.
Also, if your using ipchains with 2.2.x youll need to get the iptables targz
to do similar things under 2.4.0
You may also have problems with pppd and may need to get the new version of
that.
There are lots of other utils that also need be upgraded to use 2.4.0... look
in the "src/linux-2.4.0/Documentation/Changes" file for details.
All of the new versions of the utils should be fine back in 2.2.x

BTW... 2.4.0-test1 is very old now... i would getting the latest test version
which is test9.
Ive been running the 2.4.0 kernel for quite a while now (since test2) with no
problems, and havnt yet had a need to go back to 2.2.16.
