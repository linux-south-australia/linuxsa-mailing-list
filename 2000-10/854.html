&gt; Hi all..
&gt; 
&gt; I have another problem with Samba that I may or may not need help with.
&gt; 
&gt; First, I'll ask about my odd clock thing.  I have two machines; yoda and
&gt; skywalker.  Yoda is my gateway and contains an NTP server.  On Yoda if I
&gt; type 'date' I get the correct time and data... well duh!  If i type
&gt; 'hwclock --show' I also get the correct time and date so so (sort of)
&gt; good.
&gt; 
&gt; If on skywalker, I type 'ntpdate yoda' and it sets the time to 9+1/2
&gt; hours ago.  Now, the hardware clock on skywalker is set to local time
&gt; (winblows dual booter) and the time is always pretty close at bootup.
&gt; The time on yoda is the same.  Because yoda is the internet gateway I
&gt; wanted to set its clock off a time server whenever I dial up and keep
&gt; all the clocks nice and synchronised and accurate (they drift horribly
&gt; you know).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, that clock thing was just an aside that may or may not have some
&gt; bearing on the next problem.
&gt; 
&gt; If I boot Winblows and log in.. all good.  If I log out all good. If I
&gt; log in and load something like outlook to read my mail things go
&gt; astray.  When I load outlook it obviously __ACCESSES__ my mailboxes in
&gt; my profile.  Even if I only read mail in my inbox, and do not copy or
&gt; delete mail in the other folders, so the files _SHOULD NOT_ have
&gt; changed.  When I log out Windows insists on uploading EVERY mailbox
&gt; (200M).  This essentially stalls the server for about 15 minutes and
&gt; takes a damn site longer to log out than it should.
&gt; 
&gt; This extremely long logout has only happened since I upgraded to
&gt; Samba2.0.6 from 2.0.5.  I am not sure whether it is something different
&gt; between the versions or the time thing I mentioned above.
&gt; 
&gt; Can any of the Samba gurus out there point me in the right direction.

Possibly, but I'll have a go instead ;-).

Solution: Cut down the size of your profile. Windows doesn't actually
check to see if things have changed when the user logs out, it just
copies the whole thing back to the server. We have exactly the same
problem on an NT only network.
