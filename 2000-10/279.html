Hi.

Wondering if you could help a newbie programmer (re C on Linux).

It has to do with calling math routines (from the math.h header files).

I have a piece of code (called 09L05.c):

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;

main()
{
  double x, y, z;

  x = 64.0;
  y = 3.0;
  z = 0.5;

  printf("pow(64.0, 3.0) returns:  %7.0f\n", pow(x, y));
  return 0;
}

Looks okay to me, but when I compile it thus:

gcc -o 09L05 09L05.c

I get this:

/tmp/ccxpVLFr.o: In function `main':
/tmp/ccxpVLFr.o(.text+0x43): undefined reference to `pow'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Now, what does this really mean?  I get the same sort of error message
if I comment out the "#include &lt;math.h&gt;" line, so maybe the pow()
function isn't in the math.h header file.  Maybe it's expecting it to be
somewhere else.  In that case where would it be?

Alternatively, maybe there's some syntax in C regarding multiple
#include statements that I'm not observing, or something like that.  (I
mean, it's got to be something *obvious* I'm overlooking.)

Or maybe the pow() function is actually called something else.

Or maybe I should be including other libraries as well.  (Although when
I "#include tgmath.h" I get a screen full of error messages.  Scrap that
idea.)

Or maybe...well, I'm guessing here.  Any ideas, anyone?

(BTW, I get the same type of error message if I have any functions calls
to sin(), tan(), sqrt() or cos(), so it's math-specific function calls. 
For this reason I searched through as many C source code files as I
could, but couldn't find much that could guide me.  Knowing that the
various Xscreensaver files would use *lots* of trig functions, I looked
for those files, but I only have the binaries and not source code to any
of them.  Frustrating.)

R,

Paul.

Postscript:  if anyone regards this as type of question as off-topic,
then perhaps you could suggest a mailing list or newsgroup that this
kind of query is better suited to.
