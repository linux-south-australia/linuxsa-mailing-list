&gt; However you simply can not easily do some of the stuff you can do with
&gt; jsp/java with php/??? .

Web pages are like command line utilities, input in and output out with
no user interaction in between where functions are just as useful as
objects. If you're an OO programmer, then servlets are the way to go,
but personally I've always found php to be faster to execute, and faster
to develop than servlets without offering anything less.
 
&gt; I am not sayign that php is bad or jsp ios good, but I was simply trying
&gt; to raise issues taht someone may not have considrered when asking why
&gt; this...?

Ditto.
 
&gt; That is not a java sepcific issue, could esaily happen with a C cgi script
&gt; or any other compiled language. I perosnally woudl consider that a poor
&gt; coding problem. I can't see why in java or any other compiled langaue
&gt; that there is any reason whatsoever to hard code hostnames, database names
&gt; etc in. Use the config file Luke.
&gt; 
&gt; Irrelevant.

Compiled binaries aren't very common for CGI-type web content in an
open-source environment. I would consider this relevant to a linux list.
When's the last time you saw anyone write a one-off C program for a CGI
on linux?

If a web developer goes broke or decides that their customer should be
locked into the binary code with expensive modifications, it's not much
comfort for the client that it was java. I have had to work with some
java stuff from big name web developers, and apparently config files are
too much hassle for them. 

PHP, Perl and other scripting languages can be easily modified by a
novice to get immediate results .. try doing that as a beginner when you
need to go get the JDK to match the JRE and run the compiler with a
bunch of paths to change "hello world" to "hello world!".

&gt; &gt; version of glibc, and you're missing half of the objects considered
&gt; &gt; 'normal'. Maybe things have gotten better since I last installed it..
&gt; 
&gt; Of course the right version of glibc for your C cgi-bin program
&gt; without source supplied might not be available either or some other
&gt; library, perl module or whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; Not really a problem with using java(or any other specific language), a
&gt; problem of not checking your target environment.

Sure, but it's something that's not been an issue with php.
 
&gt; Once again not really a java/jsp issue.
&gt; That really comes down to choosing your ecommerce provider to match your
&gt; requirments.

Once again, "customers" add another degree of freedom to the equation
that tends to make the technical side more difficult. Java is touted as
a cross-platform run-everywhere language that is not much more portable
than C in some cases.
 
&gt; And if you don't want/can't use mySQL or postgres?
&gt; What if you want(or have to) to use DB2, Oracle or whatever?

It's a configure --db option. There is support for most popular
databases in the main package, again servlets proved to be a hassle to
get hold of a simple mysql object. They usually require that a client
library is installed somewhere, and use that.
 
Servlets have a lot of benefits, and the way they execute on a seperate
server is really cool too, but I'm yet to come across a solid reason to
use them instead of PHP or Perl for a web application, and where I have
used them they wasted a lot of time by comparison.

btw, if anyone out there does like Servlets and is looking for a
full-time developer for java and high-end database stuff, I have a
friend who's looking for exactly that kind of work in Adelaide - contact
me off list :)
