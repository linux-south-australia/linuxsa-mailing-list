Hello Robyn,

Congratulations in deciding to learn the greatest
language in existence, you have a good procedural
background which will really help you. But in saying
that C is very different in a lot of ways so I suggest
you find a work book and not a text book to begin
with. 

A work book has exercises with answers for you to do, 
whereas a text book explains syntax and functions and
is useful as a reference book but not much else.
'Kerningham and Richie' is a good example of a text
book. While it may seem silly to go through the basics
when you already know programming it really will help
Especially when you get into pointers and then lists.

In short buy 'Thinking in C' and stay well away from
SAMS ie. teach yourself in 12 minutes, (That's no joke
they actually have that book.)

Linux is written in C, in fact there are reports that
C was originally written to write Unix. So you already
have the tools to write and compile programs however
Makefiles are hard to learn and understand. So I
suggest you give WPE/XWPE a go. It's a borland style
IDE which uses the old ncurses library (ie text mode).
Or if you like the Windows GUI style try KDevelop.
KDevelop is a MS Visual C clone with a real nice
debugger and just nice all-round IDE. Both write
makefiles for you and let you learn C instead. 

And have fun *8)
