Subject: MRTG-2.8.18


&gt; Hi all.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody had any experience with this package?
Hi, We use it to monitor almost everything  ie eth ports, isdn link speeds,
linux boxes (ie mem swap cpu load) sat data, mail, etc etc
we do use some external scripts to collect the data though

&gt; The problem is that with the PPP link, the link is up and down, but MRTG
(more importantly, I think SNMP) reports the interface that was PPP0 as
ETH0, and tells me that I have two ETH0 devices when the link is down.  This
really screws up MRTG.  The other
&gt; problem is that it only reporting one fifth the speed of my link, ie, when
i download at 5-6 k/sec (as reported by the firewall packet counters and
c-mserver/gmasqdial) I see about 1.2 k/sec in MRTG over that interval.  It
does not matter if the link was
&gt; flat-out for the five minutes between calling MRTG.
use snmpwalk ie   snmpwalk <A HREF="mailto:community@device">community@device</A> | grep ppp
the interface number that comes back should be the one in your config file
(if you add extra devices (ie ip's cards) you'll have to do it again)

&gt; Just recently I got some 10k/sec (newsgroup list from my ISP's local
server) that took about 5 minutes to get... MRTG reports 2.1 kb/sec.
MRTG averages the data over the monitoring period (ie every 5 mins) and does
some sort of checking with previous collected data
Also make sure that the options line doesn't have 'bits' in it.  mrtg by
default uses KB/s

I suggest u check the archives of mrtg's mailing list, and possibly join it
:)

HTH
