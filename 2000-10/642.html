&gt; So I just want to make a little prediction:  Not only will MS software
&gt; bite the dust in 2 years; but the MS money will take over all the linux
&gt; businesses on the market.

Quite a provocative idea, but the first part is not particularly likely.
MS software now seems to be selling better than ever before, and even if
it's day does come I suggest two years is far too soon.  I'd hang on to
my MS shares (if I had any) for a while yet.

MS might well try to muscle into the linux market, although there are
impediments.  They are restricted by the GPL in what they can develop and
keep proprietary, although there are ways around it (loadable modules
wouldn't have to be GPLed.)  They might well be able to build and sell
books, courseware, service and support, but they have no strategic
advantage over everyone else that I can see.

Actually it would be rather nice to be able to download the MS-Linux
distribution, and to buy Microsoft Linux Revealed.  Imagine telephoning MS
support line and having them tell you the rules to tweak your sendmail.ms
file. :-)
