This about the best place I could think of to ask my question. (now
for the soft soap job) I have found some of the most knowledgable *NIX
people on this list bar none! So here goes with the quandry...

I am running FreeBSD 4.0 on my main server for my LAN connected to the
net via ADSL. I have PPPoE working just fine with a second tunnel to
another server which furnishes my static IP and is my mail handler. Up
until 20 days ago ALL was working very well and my speeds were very
respectable. At present, this is where it gets juicy, I am having a
problem getting to several sites. This doesn't happen to all site, but
to just a select few. eg - www.buy.com , www.adaptec.com ,
www.surplusauction.com and a few others... I can get to most any site,
but these are the problem ones plus a few others. I have not added
anything to the server since the orginal install except Webmin and
haven't changed any of the config files. I can get to these sites
using lynx on the server! NONE of the machines on my LAN can make it
to these sites either. Presently I am using NAT and have the server
wide open to the world! (Don't get any ideas guys! Give me time to
lock it down.) Does anyone have ANY ideas of what may be going on
here? I would be glad to give more info off the list if it is needed.
I have never seen anything like this happen to any server I have
worked on in the past.

In desparate need of help!
