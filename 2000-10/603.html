&gt; $11 000 (Eleven Thousand)? Thats an aweful lot of money for ISDN. Surely
&gt; that cannot be right. Can it?

Andrew,

In the absence of other information I'm forced to believe what Telstra 
tells me about my ISDN options and costs ;-)

I was told that an ISDN cable would have to be laid all the way from the 
local exchange (McLaren Vale) in a new service conduit. The existing 
underground conduit in my location is already absolutely full of wires 
and cannot hold any more. Laying the new conduit is the expensive bit as 
it would entail digging trenches across roads etc. 

Personally I would argue that Telstra should wear the cost of this extra 
work, because it's not my fault that their existing conduit isn't big 
enough...but network capacity planning is another issue.

However there are some unused phone wires in the existing conduit so 
there is the possibility of getting more phone lines. Each one of these 
would only cost me the usual phone connection fee (plus a modem); and 
I've been reading up on multiple modem connectivity with some interest. 
If I need more than the ~48k bandwidth I have now, and/or a dial-in 
capability, then this is probably the way I would go.

I have considered some of the satellite Internet deals; but all these 
seem to do is provide vast incoming bandwidth and only your phone line 
for outgoing. I would like to have a decent bandwidth both ways without 
going broke in the process.

BTW I was recently told it cost the govt's Internet In Schools project 
~$36,000 to get a 64k ISDN into the local primary school.


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
