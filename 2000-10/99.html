If you're using the SuSE 6.4 (and possibly other SuSE)
yast software to configure IP addresses of ethernet cards,
you might like to know something nasty which I found with it.

Suppose you have two ethernet cards -

eth0	connects to the real Internet
eth1	connects to a private LAN

Suppose you set up route.conf so that
the default IP gateway is through eth0.

Now suppose you change an IP address for
eth1. It seems like the rule is that YaST will
use the gateway node on eth1 for the default because
it is the last interface that you configured.

This happened to me a couple of times, with the result
that when I rebooted the computer remotely,
YAST had changed /etc/route.conf so that the machine
thought the wide open Internet was through eth1.
Therefore it replied to all of my packets by sending
them to eth1, even though they arrived on eth0.

Now in this case, I just had to climb up a tower and risk my
life working on a platform with flimsy fences
a few metres above a concrete stairway.
But when I come back to Australia, it will
require some 30 hours of travel to get back to
that tower.

Therefore beware!
YaST changes your routing file without asking nicely!

Can anyone confirm this?
Or have I misunderstood how to use this tool?
Unlike linuxconf, I can't seem to find how to do routing
with YaST.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I found the French SuSE 7.0 here in Strasbourg.
That should be "interesting" for my next firewall!
This was in the computer section of a general bookshop.
I think their linux book section exceeded the MS section
in the bookshop, which is not common in Adelaide.
They had zillions of books on Samba, Gimp, network
security etc. About 60/40 translations and
French originals.

PPS. I saw a bumber sticker a couple of hours ago
which said:

=================================================
LINUX
In a world without fences, why do we need GATES.
=================================================

Is that a new slogan?
Anyway it's interesting to see that linux is so well
accepted here. Much more than in Australia!
