Frank!

Your name reminds me of a gangster but that is another story.

&gt; but these are the problem ones plus a few others. I have not added
&gt; anything to the server since the orginal install except Webmin and

Read Webmin's documentation. It's unlikely to have done somethng behind
your back but it is a GUI admin tool...never trust them. And I mean
never...

&gt; haven't changed any of the config files. I can get to these sites
&gt; using lynx on the server! NONE of the machines on my LAN can make it
&gt; to these sites either. Presently I am using NAT and have the server
&gt; wide open to the world! (Don't get any ideas guys! Give me time to
&gt; lock it down.) Does anyone have ANY ideas of what may be going on
&gt; here? I would be glad to give more info off the list if it is needed.

You have the server wide open to the world. So did Alan Kennington. So
did most people who got cracked. Why BOTHER offering to tell us more
about your configuration when a simple nmap or similar port scan will
tell us all you need? Excuse me if I sound paranoid but:

* you claim it worked before
* it doesn't now
* you claim you did nothing

Unless your connection provider has f*Ked you up then I suggest that
things don't just die without a reason...

to inspect their log files, or set up any type of security measures
probably cost society in the BILLIONS

That a face that at first was ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale....
