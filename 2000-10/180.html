I've been using PHP 4 for a while now, and funnily it is everything it is
cracked up to be.

Never had any significant issues from day zip with it and it appears
extremely well behaved and dependable.

It is no issue to run PHP and mysql under PWS on a win 9x box either -
didn't even bother with apache.

Speed has never been an issue, and it is just so damn easy to program in :).

As to reusable code - I do use a fair bit. The mighty include gets used
quite a bit. You can always shell out php as a cgi-interp if you need to run
some special function from an application as a last resort.

There is now some basic OO stuff in PHP and I believe some API win stuff
which I have never had need to use.

I chose PHP by embracing the KISS principle. It simple, it works! What more
can you want.

On the otherhand JSP, whilst theoretically nice is like overcomplicating the
world when it does not need to be. On the other hand if re-usable objects
between apps and web is essential then something like jsp is definitely
better.

It is really the case of chosing the most suitable tool for the job.

Both can work.

&gt; "..why use jsp and not php?"
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that you can get a greater level of integation between java and
&gt; jsp than you can between php and other techiologies.
&gt; Ie I suspect you can have a more ocnsistent object model and
&gt; possibly re-use code more - eg you can have Java classes which can be
&gt; potentially accessed though jsp, servlets, jdbc, java applets and java
&gt; applicaitons, if neccesary using RMI, object serialisation or any of
&gt; the other nuermous and typcially easy to use Java APIs.

You don't mention that java can be a major PITA to setup for a web
server, especially in an ISP situation where virtual hosting is often
used. All the reusable objects need to be the correct version for
everyone's code (much like ASP objects), the mount points in apache are
visible to all virtual hosts, not just the one you're using, and
customers hear wonderful things about java and expect to be able to move
servlets between sites without a problem. Too bad that the customers
don't nessesarily have the source for the servlets and the database
strings are compiled in.. The jdk itself might not be available for your
version of glibc, and you're missing half of the objects considered
'normal'. Maybe things have gotten better since I last installed it..

Then just when you've tweaked it and surprised yourself at how it all
works, along comes a certain ecommerce provider that says "we don't
support java 1.2, please downgrade to 1.1 so you can use our antique
objects (and windows NT configuration system), make sure you grab the
supported slow Sun binaries and not any 3rd party stuff".

PHP by comparison is nearly as easy as configure, make, make install to
get a basic system up and running which will work for most pages. MySQL
support is usually included, so you can do database driven sites
out-of-the-box. Everything is as source, which makes it initally easy to
manage.
 
&gt; I have not heard of php implementations for the mac or windows, but I am
&gt; pretty sure you can get jsp for both of these platforms as well as
&gt; servlets - if nothing else you can run the java webserver on these
paltforms
&gt; which i bleive supports all  of the technlogies I have mentioned.

PHP runs just fine on windows, lots of developers are using it that way.
There's a project on sourceforge to make php/apache/mysql available as a
single package for windows. I don't know anything about macs, but it
looks like php version 4 has some sort of servlets API in it .. which I
guess is the best of both worlds.
