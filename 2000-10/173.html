&gt; &gt; I believe that you can get a greater level of integation between java and
&gt; &gt; jsp than you can between php and other techiologies.
&gt; &gt; Ie I suspect you can have a more ocnsistent object model and
&gt; &gt; possibly re-use code more - eg you can have Java classes which can be
&gt; &gt; potentially accessed though jsp, servlets, jdbc, java applets and java
&gt; &gt; applicaitons, if neccesary using RMI, object serialisation or any of
&gt; &gt; the other nuermous and typcially easy to use Java APIs.

Well on a single user web user I ahd no probs setting it up.

It maybe more difficulkt for virtual hosting, but I did set it up in
several different directories for different projects and it did not seem
to onerous.

&gt; 
&gt; You don't mention that java can be a major PITA to setup for a web
&gt; server, especially in an ISP situation where virtual hosting is often
&gt; used. All the reusable objects need to be the correct version for

I am taking about your own objects, ie clases you deinfe and can use
accross your applcations,including web.
I personally hve never had a problem (that I coudl nto resolve and wasnt a
case of slackness on my part) where softweare I worte didn;t work with
otehr softeware I worte becasue of versioning issues.

And assuming that they are the smae versions, you geta  lot of power form
that and potentially savea lot of time.

As I said on the simple embeded sctriptinglagnuage level, php and jsp are
probably quite comparable and I grant php may be easier to set upp.
However you simply can not easily do some of the stuff you can do with
jsp/java with php/??? .

I was offering some reasons, not neccesarily valid to the original
poster's scenario, or to your(or your lients) scenario, but potentially
valid in some scenarios.

I am not sayign that php is bad or jsp ios good, but I was simply trying
to raise issues taht someone may not have considrered when asking why
this...?

&gt; everyone's code (much like ASP objects), the mount points in apache are
&gt; visible to all virtual hosts, not just the one you're using, and
&gt; customers hear wonderful things about java and expect to be able to move
&gt; servlets between sites without a problem. Too bad that the customers
&gt; don't nessesarily have the source for the servlets and the database
&gt; strings are compiled in.. The jdk itself might not be available for your

That is not a java sepcific issue, could esaily happen with a C cgi script
or any other compiled language. I perosnally woudl consider that a poor
coding problem. I can't see why in java or any other compiled langaue
that there is any reason whatsoever to hard code hostnames, database names 
etc in. Use the config file Luke. 

Irrelevant.


&gt; version of glibc, and you're missing half of the objects considered
&gt; 'normal'. Maybe things have gotten better since I last installed it..

Of course the right version of glibc for your C cgi-bin program
without source supplied might not be available either or some other
library, perl module or whatever.

Not really a problem with using java(or any other specific language), a
problem of not checking your target environment.

&gt; Then just when you've tweaked it and surprised yourself at how it all
&gt; works, along comes a certain ecommerce provider that says "we don't
&gt; support java 1.2, please downgrade to 1.1 so you can use our antique
&gt; objects (and windows NT configuration system), make sure you grab the
&gt; supported slow Sun binaries and not any 3rd party stuff".

Once again not really a java/jsp issue.
That really comes down to choosing your ecommerce provider to match your
requirments.
 
&gt; PHP by comparison is nearly as easy as configure, make, make install to
&gt; get a basic system up and running which will work for most pages. MySQL
&gt; support is usually included, so you can do database driven sites
&gt; out-of-the-box. Everything is as source, which makes it initally easy to
&gt; manage.

And if you don't want/can't use mySQL or postgres?
What if you want(or have to) to use DB2, Oracle or whatever?

&gt; &gt; I have not heard of php implementations for the mac or windows, but I am
&gt; &gt; pretty sure you can get jsp for both of these platforms as well as

I stand corrected.
