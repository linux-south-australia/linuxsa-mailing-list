Hi.

So, say the company wanted to connect one of it's employees to it's WAN
network and the connection was radio/microwave/whatever, and the distance
was in excess of 500m (say 10-20kms)

I've got line of sight... nice hills around Adelaide, aren't they? :)

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; Thought I would post a follow up to all the Wireless LAN questions that 
&gt; have been floating around the last couple of weeks. I have just got off the 
&gt; phone with a Gary Fraser at the ACA in Melbourne.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, if a company wants to set up a WAN between sites, and they ARE 
&gt; NOT providing service to the public (any third party), and it is only for 
&gt; their internal use, then you DO NOT need to become a carrier. Gary gave me 
&gt; an example of if a company has a site in Melbourne and another in Cairns, 
&gt; they could legally run a cable between the two sites and not have to become 
&gt; a carrier. (I would think there would be other requirements though... such 
&gt; as council permission, etc, etc). His point was that from a carrier point 
&gt; of view, you only need to become a carrier if you are providing a service 
&gt; to third parties. The 500M does not apply in the case of a single company 
&gt; linking offices that it owns, as long as no third party has access to the 
&gt; network.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this clears things up a little :)
