I can feel the flame coming on already, but if you dont acutually need to
learn C, eg if the aim of the exercise is to teach your nephew to program
something, I personally would teach/learn anotehr lagnuage.

C is a bit of a bastard imho for a beginner, (you migth not be but i
assume your 11 yonephew is).

I would suggest something like Java - that is what most SA unis teach
first years there days and it let's you do most things C does - except it
makes it a bit harder to shoot yourself in the foot. It also forces you to
think about runtime error conditions(exceptions) whichh I think is a "good
thing" tm. But more importanly it is garbage col;ected so you don;t have
to think too hard(wella t all really) about memory mangament, and it is
strongly typed, which menas it is hardert to make type related errors.

It is also a fair bit easier imho to do graphics progamming in Java, which
migh tkeep the youn g nephew more captivated.
(the graphics won't be fast but you can dispalya gif in about 20 lines -
probably less.

I seriously think that C has quite a lot of fairly complex stuff in it and
really requires a reasonable (if abstract) understadnign of how computers
works - you sort of have to think about bits more than types, since the
typing is weak.

If you do want to do C thouygh I have an O'Reilly's Practical C book(it
has a cow on the fornt I think) which I found quite useful and other
people have foudn quite useful. That will probably be ok as an
introductory thing. But as someone else said it woudl eb good to have a
text book to such as Kernighan nad Ritchie's "The C programming Language"
which I think is published by addison wesley.

As for tools gcc which is on nearly all linux distributions by default and
a text editor( I actually prefer vi but it might be easier to use emacs
or xemcas for an 11 year old - this is supposition I have never tried to
teafh anyone let alone an 11 year old vi, but teh emacs and xemacs in
particluar editors can be driven by a mouse, which may be a bit more
familiar for your nephew). It would also be worth learning to use gdb the
gnu debugger, but I have no book on the subject of debiuggin or gdb that I
have read, so can not recomend any.

As for Java if you decide to tkae a non C route, I woudl recomen "The java
programming language" by soemone Gosling(james I think) published by Suin
or Javasoft press as the intro teaching book and Oreailly's "Java in a
nutsheel" as a reference text, mainly for the huge API.

As for tools once again an editor and you will also need a Java
Developer's Kit, commonly referred to as a JDK.

There is I think one availalbe from www.blackdown.org and IBM havea  good
one which I think you can get from developerworks.ibm.com.

Hope this helps

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm about to embark on learning C as well as teaching it to my nephew he's 
&gt; 11. Is there a good book out there like Teach Yourselft C in 24 hours etc? 
&gt; This is not my first programming language as I've done Basic, DBase 111+, 
&gt; Cobol and Visual Basic. What programs do I need in Linux to edit and compile 
&gt; my code.

         Some people have a way about them that seems to say: "If I have
              only one life to live, let me live it as a jerk."
