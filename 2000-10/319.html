Guys!


&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Sure, superblocks are every 8k by default on ext2 (I think).  

I hope not -- the superblock is 8k (at least, it is on Solaris)... I beleive
that there is a superblock at the beginning of each cylinder group (again,
this is based on Solaris), and cylinder groups tend to number in the tens or
hundreds...


&gt;You could iterate
&gt;I guess, but if my filesystem is that stuffed I'd still prefer 
&gt;to be consciously
&gt;aware that there is a serious problem, and that it's about 
&gt;time I made another
&gt;backup, just in case :-)

yes, but in this case, the box will be remote, and it is very important that
human presence is not required. Assume for the moment that we (I'm with
Andrew in wanting this) have daily backups, we will be notified immediately
by email if it comes up but has errors, and will be notified by irate phone
call if it does not come up at all, in which case, we need to go out there
anyway. What we want to do is minimise the likelyhood of having to go out
there... at least if it comes up with errors, and even does something dumb,
like losing all of SAMBA, we have some chance of fixing it remotely, without
needing to make a site visit. I suppose what we don't want it for fsk to
break things, and have errors, and then tell us everything's OK.

&gt;I think there's too many things that can go wrong to be 
&gt;scripted.  You don't
&gt;want to pipe 'yes' to fsck.  

yes we do :)
