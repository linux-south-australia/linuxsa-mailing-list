&gt; is software RAID actually superior in any way to hardware RAID? I always
&gt; assumed that hardware RAID would be preferable, but is often expensive and
&gt; unsupported.

Hardware Raid has a couple of advantages if speed isn't your top
priority. All of the times I've used Raid have been for redundancy
rather than greater throughput, so I might be a bit Biased here.
Fortunately, the Author of Vinum (Raid-like software for FreeBSD) is
present to correct any inaccuracies I present :)

1) You can usually boot from Hardware raid, if the controller presents
itself as a bios device, or plugs into a bios-bootable interface. This
is handy for having a total mirror of your system, not just the data,
and could reduce downtime. Software Raid sets can't be used to boot from
without applying some imaginative workarounds.

2) Rebuilds of the Raid set occur in the hardware, and often in the
background. I was surprised by the 3ware escalade card [1] the other day
when it was able to rebuild a Raid1 set while the PC's own Bios had
crashed on a bad setting. This is handy to again minimise downtime, as
the system can continue operating as normal while the Raid set rebuilds
itself. When I did use Raid on linux, rebuilding the set took a long
time on large disks, I don't know if this has been changed since.

[1] Their tech support people tell me they're porting their disk
management software to FreeBSD. I like that. It's already available for
Linux.
