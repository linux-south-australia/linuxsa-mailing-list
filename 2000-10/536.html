&gt;The whole idea of a cryptographic hash (ie MD5, SHA-1, or 
&gt;nowadays SHA-256 even)
&gt;is to verify that a chunk of data has not changed by comparing 
&gt;pre- and post-
&gt;hashes.  In our case, performing a hash of all the data (tar 
&gt;it up) prior to
&gt;copying and obtaining the same hash afterwards _guarrentees_ 
&gt;that all data was
&gt;copied correctly[1].

no it doesn't. It gives you extraordinarily high probability that all data
was copie correctly. David also has a ood point about the caching issue --
what if i copy to disk, it goes to the cache correctly, but gets written to
disk incorrectly. Running any hash will tell you that the cache is correct,
but when the cache is flushed, the data will be wrong. 

Also, it is _possible_ (with _EXTREMELY_ low probability) that there were
errors all over the place, and something completely different was
transmitted, maybe with errors in the checksum, and it's valid. It is simply
NOT POSSIBLE to garantee that two items of data are the same. It's all about
probabilities (and yes, for almost any practical purpose imaginable, md5sums
give probability close enough to 100% to be thought of as 100%, but it's
still not 100%, no matter what you do).
