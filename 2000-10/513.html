* &gt; Young whipper snappers today wouldn't know a PDP-11 if it
* &gt; fell on them[1].
*
* In fact, they would probably be dead if a PDP-11 fell on them. Even a
* UNIBUS cabinet would do serious damage.  Hell, I have a PDP-8 in my garage
* that would kill you if it fell on you.
*
* Note, I never worked on PDP-8s, and my only experience on PDP-11s was
* during a summer job when I worked in RT11 on a PDP-11/40 in about 1976.

As an interesting aside, my father works at the Uni of WA as a psych, but
he's had a long history with computers. He worked on one of the first (I'm
sure it was) PDP-11/40's in Australia, and had some fun with them. He told
me once that they just got this massive beast with flashing LED's for a
"monitor" near Christmas one year, and they worked like mad trying to get it
going. Problem is, they couldn't get it to work. They spent hours over the
Christmas break trying to nut it out, but to no avail. The other two
PDP-11's in Oz were with other Uni's, and of course everyone was on break.

My father and a couple other people spent considerable time decoding the
binary output of these stupid flashing LED's, and finally found the answer.
The screen was saying "Hit the enter key". They hit this key and it started
going no problemo.

Probably as an unrelated consequence, the faculty of Psych sold the PDP-11
back to Digital who subsequently sold it to a place called "Kalgoorlie
College" in outback Kalgoorlie, WA. Not so long ago, I began working for
Curtin University which had acquired Kalgoorlie College some years back. I
told my father that there was this huge PDP-11/40 on display as a "history
piece". He told me to look to see if there was a dent and a scratch on the
side of the cabinet, which there was. "That's the bastard", he said. :]
