That's OK for you city folk; out here in the "real" country we have real
trouble with these things.  All that rain last week brought us to a virtual
standstill connection-wise.  Even now we've had to choke our modems down to
get through.   A bit of fibre-optic would be real nice.  Greg M  (Middleton

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; This is probably a little off topic but what the heck !
&gt;
&gt; You're all probably sick of those commercials for the "World's Best
Address"
&gt; and more recently "Adelaide's Most Pretigious Address", but you should try
&gt; living here.  Telstra has somehow managed to perpetuate on of the biggest
&gt; joke's on the residents of these beautiful suburbs (considering that most
of
&gt; Telstra's infrastructure in the area has been commissioned since 1994).
The
&gt; golden grove development consists of three suburbs, Wynn Vale, Golden
Grove
&gt; and Greenwith, within the development there are over 10,000 houses with
most
&gt; of the recent development in Greenwith and of course the luxury Spring
Hill,
&gt; which is located right on the Golden Grove/Greenwith border (and accross
the
&gt; creek from my place).  As far as number of dwellings, Greenwith appears to
&gt; be the larger suburb and is still expanding.
&gt;
&gt; Now here's the rub - the majority of residents in Greenwith and Spring
Hill
&gt; have their phones serviced off the Greenwith AXE RAU, this is an AXE
Remote
&gt; Access Unit which is parented off one of the major Adelaide CBD exchanges.
&gt; In itself this is not a problem, but Telstra then decided to use RIM's to
&gt; provide the phone services to the end user, which means most residents
&gt; cannot get higher than a 28.8K modem connection and can dream about such
&gt; things as ADSL and ISDN.
&gt;
&gt; Here's how it works, the entire development is full of fibre optic cabling
&gt; (just dream about the Gigabits of capacity) and this is used to cable the
&gt; RIM's to the GWTH RAU.  From each RIM, standard copper twisted pair is
used
&gt; for the local loop to each house.  Sound's great doesn't it, lots of clean
&gt; digital channels between the RAU and each RIM and then literally metre's
of
&gt; new copper cable to each house.  Think again, Telstra decided to use non
&gt; integrated RIMs which means that the local copper loop is converted to
&gt; digital at the RIM, the signal is then transmitted through the fibre optic
&gt; cable to the RAU where it is converted back to analogue and fed into the
&gt; standard analogue exchange ports of the RAU.  These two analogue to
digital
&gt; conversions are what restricts the modem to a theoretical limit of 31.2K
but
&gt; more realisticly 28.8K.  If Telstra had used integrated RIMs then the RIM
&gt; would be digitally connected to the RAU, thus eliminating the second A/D
&gt; conversion and allowing 56K modem operation, also ISDN services would be
&gt; available right now and ADSL would only require adding new cards to each
of
&gt; the RIMs and not changing all the interfacing infrastructure at the RAU
end.
&gt;
&gt; Back to ADSL, Telstra wasn't planning to provide ADSL to Golden Grove -
the
&gt; service was going to stop at the Modbury exchange.  However, according to
&gt; their web site, Telstra is now reviewing the provision of ADSL from the
&gt; Golden Grove exchange.  This will make most residents of Golden Grove and
&gt; Wynn Vale happy, but it still leaves the residents of Greenwith and Spring
&gt; Hill out in the cold.  Perhaps somebody should inform the investors on
&gt; Spring Hill who are building their 300K plus mansions of the situation.
&gt; More to the point, somebody should tell Telstra about the levels of
&gt; disposable income in the area, income which could be spent on ADSL.
&gt;
&gt; Bottom line, perhaps all of us Greenwith residents should consider
swapping
&gt; our 56K modems with anybody who has a 28.8K modem to offer and who can use
&gt; speeds in excess of 28.8K.  In the meantime I can continue dreaming about
&gt; the Gigs of capacity buried behind my back fence, and put up with my 28.8K
&gt; and Telstra's continual offers to put a Satellite dish on my roof !!!!
Now
&gt; don't even get me started with regards to cable services.....  I'll be
quite
&gt; happy to switch all my phone services over to any carrier who can plug me
&gt; into the digital age !!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Richard
