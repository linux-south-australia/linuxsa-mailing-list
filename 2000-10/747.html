The fact that lilo stopped at "LI" means something.

Here is what it means according to /usr/doc/lilo-0.21/README on my
syustem.

   LI   The first stage boot loader was able to load the second stage boot 
    loader, but has failed to execute it. This can either be caused by a 
    geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/boot.b without running the map 
    installer. 

Did your system work with this config before?
If yes what have you changed?

If no, how big is your hard disk and where on the partiton is
linux/windows.
lilo(at least all but the very latest lilo) can only boot into the first
1024 cyclinders so if you have big disk and your /boot dir or your win dir
is after 1024 cylinders, you h=may have a prob.

very new version of lilo can let you go past 1024 cyclinders, such as that
which ships ith rh7.0.
I am not sure of the version number of the lilo that supports this.

If you get this new lilo you need to rpelace the word "linear" in
lilo.conf with lba32 (assumignthe 1024 cylinder thing is your problem and
if it is assuming your bios/hdd supports the rigth modes which I can;t
tell you cos I did not pay much attnetion, but it did owrk - for my
hardware/bios).

Another solution reisntall and create /boot in the firs 1024 cylinders.
Then windows partion then linux partition(s).
this way all the stuff yo need to boot will be in the first 1024
cylinders(probably/hopefully - depends of course on your partion sizes).

Of course you problem may be something else entirely,this is just a guess
based on assunptions and my own very limited experience.

Hope it is at least a bit helpful.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; my problem is that boot routine is stalled on my PC.
&gt; I have both Win97 & RH 6.2 with dual boot.  On start up normal processes
&gt; apply but then stall with at LI  (not LILO, which automatically takes me to
&gt; a Win97 install if I don't log on for RH).
&gt;  
&gt; Any ideas how I can fix the problem?
