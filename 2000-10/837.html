&gt; So I'm not expecting a rush for this one.

Except a rush of current as 240V is applied to it. :-)

&gt; PPS. What would be really good for a museum would be
&gt; an old acoustic coupling modem. I bet not many people out
&gt; there still have one of those.

As stated offlist, I used to have one of these, and wanted
to keep it for sheer novelty value.  Alas, it is no more.

&gt; And what about the real TTY machines? The ones that replaced
&gt; morse code for telegraphy. Weren't they 75 bps or something?

Only if you were lucky.  I still have in my possession a 50
baud (/bps, they were the same in them days, you understand)
Siemens Model 100 teleprinter that runs Baudot (5 bit "ASCII").
A friend and I even wrote an article for ETI on how to hook
one of these puppies up to your ETI-660, from memory.  The
friend had an even older teleprinter that ran at 45.45 baud.

Other priceless treasures (read: "items of junk", by my ever-so-
sarcastic SO) include a Tandy Model 102 laptop with 40 by 8 LCD
screen (with reverse engineered Basic Interpreter, so I knew how
crap Microsoft's code was back in the mid 80's), and an LA-36 DEC
printing console (running at a whopping 30cps/300bps).  Used to
keep me sane at Uni, because if someone gave me any grief I used
to look at them sardonically and say "I own a printer older than
you, and probably smarter."  (it had a CPU built out of discrete
TTL chips - a thing of beauty).

And on the bookware side of things, I have some original PDP-11
A5-ish size books with instructions sets listings (so orthogonal
it would make grown men weep), and a book on building your own
Object Oriented Forth.

I think I have packrat tendencies.
