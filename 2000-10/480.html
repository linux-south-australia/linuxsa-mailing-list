&gt; But surely at disk I/O driver or hardware level, only a certain amount
&gt; of integrity checking can be done?  For example if you have RAM
&gt; corruption happening (and don't have parity RAM), then disk I/O won't
&gt; pick it up.

Talking of absurd: Are you seriously suggesting that cp could read after
write to guard against faulty RAM?  All that I can say is if your hardware
is faulty then your results are unpredictable, and you are just as likely
to experience a core dump, or kernel panic, as you are to have a faulty
copy.

&gt; And besides, what if you don't know how good your disk I/O driver and
&gt; hardward do things?  Doing it in software can be an added safety check.

That's another way of asking about faulty RAM.  If your hardware is faulty
then you need new hardware.  If the hardware is intrinsically unreliable,
for example a shared network where collisions are normal, you must put
error checking in the driver.  If the driver is buggy you need a new
driver.  There's no reason to believe that error checking in cp would be
more reliable than error checking in the kernel/driver (where it belongs.)
