&gt; &gt; I have been looking on the web for information about whether the GNU
&gt; &gt; version of cp has any safeguards protecting the integrity of its copy.
&gt; &gt; I haven't been able to find anything yet.  Does anyone know about this?
&gt; 
&gt; That's absurd.  The place to be paranoid about disk I/O is most certainly
&gt; not in an application such as cp or cpio.  Did any of my staff or proteges
&gt; do something like that and I would feel obliged to beat such person around
&gt; the head and shoulders.  Severely.

Please don't beat me! :-)

Why absurd?  (Please give arguments other than argument by
intimidation:-)  Perhaps because it would slow things down too much?
In which case it could be made an option.

&gt; The place to be paranoid about disk I/O is in the disk I/O driver, or
&gt; better yet, in the disk I/O hardware.  I have no idea if Linux offers
&gt; read after write.  If it does I predict it would be an option that is
&gt; off by default.

But surely at disk I/O driver or hardware level, only a certain amount
of integrity checking can be done?  For example if you have RAM
corruption happening (and don't have parity RAM), then disk I/O won't
pick it up.  And besides, what if you don't know how good your disk
I/O driver and hardward do things?  Doing it in software can be an
added safety check.

Michael Neuling just sent me (and to the list) a good way of doing an
integrity check by hand using md5sum.  Why not have cp do something
like this itself, or at least have it as an option?  I can't see why
the idea is absurd and warrants a beating!

Cheers,

Mark.
