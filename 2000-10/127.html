In my excitement I forgot that there may be people who are interested in
how I managed to get this going. The steps I took were:

* get the latest source
 - goto www.winehq.org

I mentioned to Richard Sharpe who has also been testing wine, but
unfortunately not having as much success as me, that it is probably
advisable to get a SRPM or a tar-balled source. Its configuration is
quite specific to one's machine and although wine does come with a lot
of (I guess) reverse engineered DLL's, it does look like a simple
"hmmm....can't find that file there so I'm going to crash" can happen.

* read the README
 - it said that "unpack into a directory, ./tools/wineinstall" will do
it

* did a ./configure
 - I decided that this and the actual "making" of wine will be most
likely to crash (the source tree about 2 weeks ago crashed on me)
 - configured perfectly

* did a make dep
 - it told me to

* did a make
 - it told me to

You should be warned that building wine takes a lot of space. It crashed
on /tmp which (without wine) has about 71MB so I had to shift it to
/usr/src which has more than 5 Gb free. At first I'd thought,
hmmph...here goes. But it was only an out of space error. Incidentally,
this kills almost anything that need /tmp :-(

* mounted all my partitions, including my Windows partition, then did
./tools/wineinstall
 - I confess I have a registered version of Windows First Edition (I
found it in a bargain bin...what can I say?)
 - wineinstall seems to roam about your system and setup wine.conf for
you; this was most unlike the old days...I remember trying to get a
damned wine.conf written almost from scratch
 - this ran the configure and make, but naturally they did "nothing"
because I'd already done them

I then crossed my fingers and experimented. It appears to be quite
"good" but unfortunately I have to killall -9 the damned window. Wine
hijacks my damned mouse into the little window that appears, but that's
only a small sacrifice. Graphics are slow, even on a 650MhZ Athlon with
320Mb RAM and a Riva TNT2 Ultra 32MB running under X...4.0.1. I found
that turning off the little animated "people" pics makes the game go
faster.

Anyway, time for me to play :-)

As the miller told his tale
That a face that at first was ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale....
