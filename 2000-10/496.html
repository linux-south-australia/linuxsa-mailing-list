You can check in revisions that don't work too - the log facility
makes it handy to show avenues that you have tried, but don't work.

&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; How do I set up rcs or my environment so that I create a central store for
&gt; the rcs files? 

I'm not sure if there is an envariable you can set to do this.  The
"traditional" way to do this with RCS is to supply a second argument
with a path to the file or directory you wish to use, e.g.:

    ci /RCS/path/to/file /path/to/file

You'll need to check the man page on RCS, as I think there are some
restrictions on the name of the path you use.

&gt; That's
&gt; ok, but I have to create a RCS/ in any directory I want to use rcs in. It
&gt; would be neat to have them all in one place - I could tar the whole lot up
&gt; and keep them on another machine for backup.

For this, I tend to use a wrapper script that runs around the command
you want to use; for example, I used to have a script on the box that
was "multiply admin'd", that ran in place of vi that checked in the
changes after the file was saved.

&gt; When I co a file from rcs, it is set to Mode: (0444/-r--r--r--), which
&gt; means that I need to chmod it before being able to edit it. What should I
&gt; be doing here?

You should be locking the file when you check it out, as you intend to
make changes to it - "co -l" (similar to ci's -l).  I can't remember
how well (if at all) RCS handled restoring permissions on files checked
out in the locked state.
