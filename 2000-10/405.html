Hi all

Until yesterday I was using NFS to share out the /home filesystem on my
linux box to my other boxes.  Some time in the last 36 hours NFS has
stopped.  On checking on the server I found that the portmap executable is
not there, nor is rpc.nfsd, rpc.rquotad, and any of the other files that
NFS/portmap start from their initd scripts.

I have a trashed RPM database (i did that by accident one day) so I can't
simply reinstall the packages.  Instead, I copied them off another RH6.0
system and put them in the right places.

Unfortunately, when I start portmap I get the following error:

execvp:  permission denied

Is there anything that i can do to make portmap start and fix this error?  I
have tried everything I can think of including going back to the standard
2.2.5-22 kernel from the dist CD.  It is very annoying to be stuck using
Windows to do anything.

Possibly related is my /var partition.  I rebooted yesterday (correctly
after shutting down fully) and on reboot I was told that /var was not
unmounted correctly, even though it has been.  When fsck ran it found
literally hundreds of errors.  I asked it to restore most of them and it
asked me if I wanted to save some files that were unlinked to the disk.
There is nothing in lost+found either. I don't know what files/where it put
them either.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Adam
