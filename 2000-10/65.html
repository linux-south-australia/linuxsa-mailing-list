&gt;Hmm I must be confusing Loosley Typed with something
&gt;else, Loosley typed to me means that you can add
&gt;spaces, returns etc anywhere and it will ignore them.

No.. that's something completely different. Loosely typed is a semantic
thing, whereas the importance of whitespace is a syntactic thing -- it has
nothing to do with the meaning of the language, only how you write it...

Loosely typed means that you can treat a variable of one type as if it were
a variable of another completely different type. eg, in C, you can treat a
char as an int and so on. You can force casts between various types of
variables without checking hte sanity of what you are doing -- casting the
letter 'A' to an int, and multiplying by 3, doesn't really make much
sense... it may be useful in some bizzare situation, but there is always a
sensible way of achieving what you want.

In Java, you cannot treat a String object as an int or a BigNumber object as
a Graphics object. However, you can use polymorphism to cast intelligently.
ie, you can treat any object as if it was any of its superclasses, and so
on... hence, you can treat a LinkedList as an AbstractList or an Object (or
any of its other superclasses). What's more, you can do the same with any
interface it implements -- ie you can treat a LinkedList as a List, or a
Collection, and so on... It's kind of hard to explain in a sensible amount
of space.

Hopefully this helped somewhat...
