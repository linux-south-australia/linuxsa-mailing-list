&gt; I have a client that would like to do accounting for the internet time of
&gt; their clients.

Firstly, Internet "time" is a dodgy measure for permanently connected
machines.  You might want to charge by traffic or apparent bandwidth
instead.

Secondly, you need to decide what level of aggregation is suitable.
In general, more accounting infrastruture is needed for more
detailed accounts.  I'd strongly encourage you to keep it
simple.

&gt; I was wondering what the easiest way of doing this is?

Split the network into two subnets.  Run IP accounting on the
router.  Use SNMP to fetch the records for traffic from Internet
to the subnet.  This depends a lot of the abilities of the
"propietary router" and mentioning a make and model would have
been useful here.

There are heaps of possible accounting infrastructures, and the
ease of each depends on the link layer in use and the abilities
of the particular machines.  A standard accounting infrastructure
is making its way through the IETF, but it's actually a very
difficult technical problem to balance generality (and thus allow
a lot of charging methods) with simplicity (and thus make it
cheap enough to implement on all routers).

Some possibilities:

 - replace the router with something that does accounting
   more suited to your needs.

 - flick the ethernet switch into "tap" mode, run this to
   an interface on a PC and use something like Netramet.

 - see if the current router will emit flow records.
