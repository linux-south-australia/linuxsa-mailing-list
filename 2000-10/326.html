&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; is software RAID actually superior in any way to hardware RAID? I always
&gt;&gt; assumed that hardware RAID would be preferable, but is often expensive and
&gt;&gt; unsupported.

As John says below, under some circumstances, yes. That is, it is superior,
and less expensive.

&gt;Hardware Raid has a couple of advantages if speed isn't your top
&gt;priority. All of the times I've used Raid have been for redundancy
&gt;rather than greater throughput, so I might be a bit Biased here.
&gt;Fortunately, the Author of Vinum (Raid-like software for FreeBSD) is
&gt;present to correct any inaccuracies I present :)
&gt;
&gt;1) You can usually boot from Hardware raid, if the controller presents
&gt;itself as a bios device, or plugs into a bios-bootable interface. This
&gt;is handy for having a total mirror of your system, not just the data,
&gt;and could reduce downtime. Software Raid sets can't be used to boot from
&gt;without applying some imaginative workarounds.

This in my view is the main advantage of a hardware RAID controller. There
is no way with current BIOSes and current boot approaches to boot off of a
software RAIDx ( x &lt; 1 || x &gt;= 4, and possibly not even RAID1).

&gt;2) Rebuilds of the Raid set occur in the hardware, and often in the
&gt;background. I was surprised by the 3ware escalade card [1] the other day
&gt;when it was able to rebuild a Raid1 set while the PC's own Bios had
&gt;crashed on a bad setting. This is handy to again minimise downtime, as
&gt;the system can continue operating as normal while the Raid set rebuilds
&gt;itself. When I did use Raid on linux, rebuilding the set took a long
&gt;time on large disks, I don't know if this has been changed since.

While I have seen rebuilds occur under hardware RAID as well, it does come
with a performance penalty, and I am under the impression that software
RAID4/5 can also do the same.

&gt;John Edwards
&gt;
&gt;[1] Their tech support people tell me they're porting their disk
&gt;management software to FreeBSD. I like that. It's already available for
&gt;Linux.

The main reasons I have for liking software RAID are:

1. Performance is clearly superior, as you have the benefit of a fast
processor and larger caches, compared with hardware RAID.  You also remove
one more layer of software from the picture.

2. Flexibility. Many of the RAID vendors have not yet ported their software
to Linux, so you have to operate on these things in the BIOS. This can be
very painful. Indeed, many of the vendors do not see Linux as relevant.

3. Lower cost. These RAID cards are often $2.5K or more, and the shipping
ones do not yet support Ultra 160 as far as I can see. However, you can buy
three Ultra 160 cards for a lot less than this price and get considerably
more IO throughput with software RAID.  Of course, you need the PCI bus
slots, and they need to support 66MHz mode ...

4. Initial installation is easier. Current releases do not support some
RAID controllers, which makes installation difficult (even if you do know
how to load the right module from a floppy at the right point, getting the
installation software to build an initrd can be a problem). 

Also, if you are installing on a JBOD disk, you need to go into the BIOS
and set up one of the disks as a JBOD device. This is just not needed with
normal controllers.
