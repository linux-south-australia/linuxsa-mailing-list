Hi,

&gt; PS. I guess that in 2 years, even 56k modems will
&gt; be history. If ADSL gets serious, the 56k modem is going
&gt; to start looking old-fashioned.

I'd tend to disagree with your time period here. I'm still seeing 288
modems on occasions. If you don't have a digital modem server, then 336 is
the Max you'll get. Until digital servers drop below the $10000 mark and
ISDN and phone line rental prices drop too, then many people running small
dialup services will still be having old racks of modems.

Also 'till the ADSL laws get sorted out, I don't see serious competition
and thus price drops happening, so I think the standard will be around for
a while.

&gt; 
&gt; PPS. What would be really good for a museum would be
&gt; an old acoustic coupling modem. I bet not many people out
&gt; there still have one of those.
&gt; And what about the real TTY machines? The ones that replaced
&gt; morse code for telegraphy. Weren't they 75 bps or something?
&gt; 
&gt; PPPS. I looked around the SA state museum web site at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/">http://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/</A>
&gt; but I saw no sign of where you apply to get a new collection
&gt; started. I reckon if the state museum started now, they'd
&gt; have a really valuable IT history collection within 10 years.
&gt; And then us old-timers could get rid of all our old junk.

The Telecomunications museum used to hold alot of this sort of
thing. Since it closed and the contents went into storage (I think), no
platform for display of this sort of exhibit exists.

&lt;Stands on political soap box&gt;
The Government of South Australia needs to get its act together on the
"museum" front. The Investigator Science Centre is close to closing due to
lack of funds, and there are a number of other "Small" Museums, that could
get some major benefit from being housed under the one roof. If the SA
government could allocate some money and space to this, it would be an
assed and a benefit to the state.
&lt;Stands down from soap box and ducks for cover&gt;

cya
