&gt; Charles,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you have a permenant IP?  If so and you don't hack then why are you
&gt; &gt; worried?  You won't be denied if you don't do anything.  Server admins
want
&gt; &gt; people to come to thier servers.  They just don't want them comprimised
or
&gt; &gt; hurt.  So how you would be denied at thier site if you have done
nothing, is
&gt; &gt; something I don't understand.  Also, if your on a dynamic dial-in
service
&gt; &gt; and you find yourself being denied access on certain servers it should
tell
&gt; &gt; you something.  Get a new ISP.  They are obviously letting hackers
and/or
&gt; &gt; script kiddies run loose on the net.  Once a ISP gets the rep of
allowing
&gt; &gt; hackers and/or script kiddies then they get shut out of a lot of sites
&gt; &gt; anyway.  Trust me, this much I have found out the hard way.  I'm living
in
&gt; &gt; Germany where hackers and script kiddies are a friggin plague.  It is
hard
&gt; &gt; to find a network over here sometimes that doesn't have problems about
being
&gt; &gt; denied at some sites.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I cannot agree with this statement. The idea of changing ISP is obsurd
&gt; -- lets say that a reputable ISP (such as Internode, Rebel etc) gets
&gt; someone dialing up to their  service and `hacking' and gets their
&gt; current IP on the ban list, that would mean that anyone else using that
&gt; IP would be banned. Surely one should not be expected to change ISPs
&gt; because of one stupid person wants to be a pain. How would one combat
&gt; this? The unfortunate reality is that there are many people using a
&gt; service with dynamic IP allocation. Even Telstra's ADSL (ugghhh...) uses
&gt; DHCP. It'll be a while until every house, office or building has its own
&gt; static IP (Although some businesses, particularly the larger ones have
&gt; static IPs). How do you plan to work with problems such as this?
&gt;

If you read the statement I made.  Such problems would occur mostly when the
ISP has a high rate of hackers.  Also, by setting a time limit (for example
45 days) for expiration, you could get the IP back off the blacklist
(possible).  So basically I was speaking of a lot of hackers on a net.  Such
was the case here in Germany for a few years.  This trend has died here in
the last 5 years but was before a serious problem.  Also,  I am looking into
a way to make a MAC addy call so that when something like this happens, if
they are using an NIC we can match the IP with the MAC addy for a positive
match.  Am still working on a dial-in solution however.  Any ideas?

&gt; Secondly, if I was to install this list on one of my servers, how am I
&gt; assured that its genuinely a hacker/script kiddie IP? While you may not
&gt; deliberately put an incorrect address in there, someone else (maybe a
&gt; hacker or script kiddie :-) might.
&gt;
This issue is being worked on now.  by recording the email address and IP
address of the person submitting the "to be blacklisted" IP and setting a
limit on the number of request needed from unique users we should be able to
keep most to a limit.  Any ideas in this area either?

&gt; Finally, how would you assure that this list stays up-to-date? It may be
&gt; that someone who had an IP on the blacklist may have left that ISP and
&gt; no longer is attached to the IP. That would mean that there is some poor
&gt; Joe User guy with a blacklisted IP.
&gt;
Part of this answer is above.  Another thing is that if an ISP wishes to
have some IP's removed they must make contact with all people that reported
the IP.  This I believe will prove to be beneficial in that, it may move
ISP's to be a bit more diligent in regards to what users do across thier
network.  Any ideas?

&gt; It's a good idea, but it is flawed by no fault of your own.
&gt; Unfortunately, System Admins have to deal with these hacker people. It's
&gt; a reality. It is also unforunate that a genuine attempt by someone such
&gt; as yourself to block these people from our servers can (an attempts
&gt; undoubtably will) be mamed by these hackers/script kiddies.
&gt;
There are a lot of facets to this that are still in the air at the moment.
However, I'm positive we can come up with a good solution to this that will
work.  I still have a lot to look at and these emails help me keep things in
mind when looking at the big picture.  The largest problem are NAT's and
dial-in connections.  big pain. hehe.

Chuck
