&gt; &gt; IIRC, there was talk in the past about AUUG helping LinuxSA become an

&gt; &gt; committee members stand on this issue, is it worth pursing this matter and
&gt; &gt; finding out what is involved?  What are peoples thoughts on this matter?
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO, I think ongoing relationship with AUUG would be good. I personally
&gt; don't see why we shouldn't be separate, and I feel like I'd prefer that, but
&gt; maybe it shuold be persued a little... hmm

I think people thought that I thought that AUUG would be a competitor - I was
(rather badly) trying to suggest that LinuxSA need not become AUUG through
incorporation (not that there's anything wrong with AUUG), but rather the two
organisations should be complimentary.

I see AUUG as something that's more appropriate for lobbying, for conferences,
and the like, while LinuxSA as something that's informal, regular meetings,
highly technical, very pizza-ish.  Both are useful, both are great, both have
their place.

Just MHO,

Michael...
