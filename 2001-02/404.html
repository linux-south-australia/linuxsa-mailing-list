Evan!

&gt; One thing I learned at uni is I dont like stats and their validity. It was
&gt; a summary of what I received in reply.

Which means you should buy the APC version.

&gt; I will be honest, if not for games, we wont need half the things that are
&gt; coming out. I like games my kids like games, so any help in getting these
&gt; games to work under linux is good.

I'm not so certain about this. I think they'd exist but be out of our
price range. Graphics Designers, musicians (composers, sound engineers
etc) - just to mention a few - would still need powerful computers
except because demand would be lower they'd cost more.

&gt; I recall a certain Star craft player exclaiming their joy in getting SC to
&gt; work under wine. :PP

Yes. I didn't enjoy being defeated by the stupid computer AI when I'd
had some wine though...

&gt; I as yet have no need for them

You never "yet" need them until it's too late.

&gt; But in the main I also
&gt; run a PC firewall under windows which surfices.

Those things. I had a friend who has one and you may as well not bother
being connected to the Internet.
 
&gt; I don't always have access to the net and I enjoy reading so I thought
&gt; about picking up something a bit  different, I am on a steep learning curve
&gt; and I like to take things slowly.

Like a book? One of the "Mastering Linux" or "Mastering [Version] Linux"
books might be the go. I don't have one because I've got separate books
on the main parts of it but they strike me as being a reasonable, though
slightly gloss-ed over intro to Linux.

&gt; If it bothers you I shall revert back to my newbieness :)

I'd hardly say you're incompetent, but that's your call.

&gt; So with all due respect to the course holders I don't feel a pressing urge
&gt; to attend anything atm. It's just my tinkering and I go off on a number of
&gt; tangents as my interest dictates.

And that's an effective but not the only way to learn.

DL
