David this sounds like our ICQ debate.

I applaude the introduction of Kylix I expect it's Borland's last gasp at
staying afloat. 

Having been heavily into Win32 based development for the last 8 years and
only a recent Linuxer I am probably the last person to compare the
development tools from both environments as all coding on linux has been
from the command line and vi (I hate emacs).

Background: At our last staff IT meeting the Linux issue came up following
discussions about the licensing costs of MS office etc. I suggested we give
Star/Open office a try We then moved to the topic of Linux as an
alternative to WinNT. I now have the dubious honour of devising a proof of
concept setup that open source based workstation is just as functional as
WinNT with MS apps.

To compound it though we have internally developed applications (very much
core to the business) based on VB and SQL Server. 

I am confident of the openoffice solution (even running on NT). I am not so
confident on anything coming close to an environment like VB (except for
Kylix) Having used VB when I tried Delphi since v1 through to v3 I was up
and running in it very quickly and since it is an out of the box solution
with no need to use further 3rd party widgets it is attractive and very
productive.

David suggested all the toolkits around for Linux but they just all seem
too hard too much hassle to setup and use.

As a developer I would love the ability to move to Linux develop
applications in a RAD style in the same way I can with Win32 VB/Delphi. I
know there are lots of organisations of varying size who would make the
move once such an environment becomes available for Linux even if their
backend remains MS Sql Server the client software need not be MS.

Until such time I really cannot see MS based organisations like us making
the switch in a serious sense and currently I sadly suspect there will only
be a novelty factor in trying Kylix.

As to the licensing I think they should release a working demo version with
the DB objects so people can actually try it show it to the bosses and then
say it is far better than what we do or at least as good. I don't see our
organisation paying 1600 so I can experiment. If it proves worthwhile we
would not have a problem with paying the price for 3-4 licenses so long as
any run-time stuff is freely distributable.

Sorry for taking it way off topic.
