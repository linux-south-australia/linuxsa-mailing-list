&gt; Unfortunately Richard Sharpe is unable to give his 'Developing a Samba
&gt; Client Library' talk at this month's meeting, so I am arranging for
&gt; another speaker at the moment.  There'll be an announcement tomorrow
&gt; as to who/what it will be.

An update!

Richard Sharpe has become available again and will be giving the
presentation discussed in the meeting announcement. Here it is again
for those of you who have forgotten...

The usual stuff:

  When:   7:00pm (doors open 6:45pm) on
          Tuesday, 20th February, 2001
  Where:  2nd Floor
          Compaq Computer
          139 Frome Street
          Adelaide SA
  Cost:   FREE
  Who:    Anyone and everyone.
          No pre-registration necessary.

Presentation:

  Richard Sharpe will be giving a talk titled ``Developing a Samba
  Client Library'':

  While there have been a number of Samba client libraries developed,
  from SMBlib in 1996 to libsmb++ more recently, they all suffer from
  having been abandoned by their authors and are no longer supported.
  In late 2000, Caldera wanted a supported Samba client library to
  allow them to enhance Konquerer, so they contacted the Samba team
  among others.  Because of my knowledge of the Samba source code, and
  the fact that I had done SMBlib all those years ago, I was awarded
  the task.

  This talk will explain what libsmbclient is, how it was developed
  and what it means to the open source community. It will demonstrate
  a simple GTK+ test application developed with libsmbclient and look
  at where this library is expected to be used and what its future may
  be.  It will also discuss some of the problems encountered during
  its development and how closely tied it is to Samba.

  This talk is intended for all open source enthusiasts, and while no
  knowledge of Samba is required, it may help.

Extras:

  As per usual, if you are having a problem with your Linux
  installation, feel free to bring your machine, but please warn
  <A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A> beforehand.
