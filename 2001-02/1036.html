Hi DrWho,

&gt; I don't think anyone is saying that anyone else is not doing an excellent
job.  A
organisation can only be formalised when things are going well.  I think that
LinuxSA CAN
be formalised is a healthy sign and is cause for celebration.

Hey, I'm just wanting us to look at the positives and the negatives.  If we
incorporate we become a legal body which has positives and negatives.  For
example, we can lobby easily, but we also can get sued.  If we can get sued, we
need insurance.  If we need insurance we need to raise money.  If we need to
raise money we probably need the concept of membership.  If we need the concept
of membership, we probably need to offer people something to become members, or
else they'll keep their $$$ in their wallets.

I agree it will be a good thing if we can overcome the obsticles.  Over the last
3 or so years that I've been here at LinuxSA I've always thought we should
incorporate.

&gt; Nothing need change as far as the services already provided.  LinuxSA will be
a NON-PROFIT
organisation and hence will not necessarily attract fees for services already
provided by
Netcraft, etc and may earn respect rather than fear from other organisations.

Things are good now.  We have a good report with Netcraft, AUUG, Linux Australia
etc.  I'm just saying that we need to see what benefits we get for what it will
cost us.

&gt; It is unlikelly that the mailing list or any other service will change in any
way - it is
just LinuxSA will be more formal and organised and will provide extra services
for fees
provided.  This could be a software / publication library, FTP mirror, etc.

Agreed.  The list may not change, but we have to decide what benefits membership
provides (if any) or find another way to raise funds.

&gt; Of course the main motivation for me wanting to see LinuxSA formalised is the
increased
lobying power it will give LinuxSA.

I don't actually see this as a necessity, personally.  But you're welcome to
have that as something you'd like to persue.
 
&gt; It is time to move on and see this as a move forward - not a dangerous change.

It's only a move forward if it benefits those who are involved in LinuxSA.  If
there are no benefits, why do it? 

It's only dangerous if we make the transition badly.

Michael...
