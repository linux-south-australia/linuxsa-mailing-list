Nick!

&gt; ... that's what nmap does to see if the ports are open.  It's normal nmap
&gt; behaviour.  In fact, that's what nPulse is designed to do.

Yes, I understand that. But is it worth port scanning your own system so
much that you can't tell if someone else is doing it to you?

&gt; Interesting thoughts.  I'll have a bit of a close watch.

Based on something that actually happened. Unfortunately, the other
person (there were three of us - three is a good number) didn't consider
nPulse as a suspect and only told us in the latter part of our
"post-mortem" session. My point is that nmap et al can be legitimate but
they're often not. Hence, paranoid programs such as TCPD and SSH have a
tendency to view port scanning as suspicious.
