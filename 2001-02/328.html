Hi.

This is turning into a saga...

&gt; &gt; 1. Check the boot messages. are there any serial ports recognised?
&gt; ttyS0 and ttyS1 are recognised in the boot messages.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I think about it I read somewhere that a file
&gt; /usr/share/doc/setserial-2.17/rc.serial  needed to be copied to
&gt; /etc/init.d/serial but no one has mentioned this. Anyone know if this is
&gt; necessary?

Well, it should be part of standard install. Did you? (not sure we should
go there..)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Get into the bios setup and make sure the ports are turned on at the
&gt; &gt; normal interupts etc.
&gt; Double checked the BIOS settings.

cool. Does this port work under another OS &lt;cringe&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. If that pans out ok, su to root, and use cu to talk to the port
&gt; &gt; directly, like this:
&gt; I haven't got cu in the path and can't find it in my install. I'm using RH
&gt; 7.0. Should I have it?

It's part of the uucp package. Maybe it isn't standard, but it would be on
the CD. Taylors UUCP is common, and loaded on my 6.1 and 6.2 boxen. Never
mind, do you have minicom and xminicom, (serial comms packages) they would
do similar. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4. Any sort of recent modem should pass this test. My 56k is a tassie
&gt; &gt; devil, and I think I paid $125 when they were still expensive...
&gt; Hmmm. Would a firmware upgrade on the modem help? I found an upgrade on
&gt; their site.

Well, probably not. It might improve the modem capabilities, but talking
to a serial port is pretty low on that list. If it isn't working now, I
don't think a firmware upgrade will help.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5. Oh yea, when you get this sorted, please fix the html mail thing &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; Fixed yet?

You bet. Saved you from DL!
