&gt; &gt; I can think of several emotions that could've been expressed by that
&gt; &gt; sigh. Do you have a preference?
&gt; 
&gt; it was exasperation, but probably wasn't neccessary -- I take it back (hgis)

LOL.

&gt;&gt; I'm opportunistic enough to buy hardware from retailers that have 
slim
&gt;&gt; margins - though I'll at least make sure there's a manufacturers
&gt;&gt; warranty.
&gt; 
&gt; fair enough -- these days, I tend to go for slightly more profitable
&gt; businesses, particularlyl when buying something other than a commodity item,
&gt; simply because I would like them to be around to support me if it breaks or
&gt; whatever  -- it's certainly easier than returnign to the manufacturer, as my
&gt; recent HD experience has shown :)

One way or another we pay. Speaking of the fun & games you've been 
having with hard drives, your problems made me decide to keep the
control boards from any hard drives I have to toss, just in case.
 
&gt; mmm, but IIRC (and it was a long time back), this was about the places they
&gt; were advertising on... if you appreciate the free services like /., then one
&gt; way of supporting them is to do business with those that support them...
&gt; likewise, if you like the RSPCA, you may think it appropriate to choose to
&gt; do business with XXX brand doggy buscuits, as they sponsor the RSPCA...

Nup. It was a bit simpler than that, but since you aren't that
interested, I'll let it lie.  Personally, I'd rather give the money
directly to the service - RSPCA ... whatever.

&gt; well, in my exerience, they are less intrusive -- I just close them when
&gt; they popup (I hate popup ads, so I refuse to suport them), and occasionally
&gt; click on the odd banner ad...

At least we can agree on popup ads. :-) In fact I make a point of
staying away from sites that use popup ads. Yeah, I might be missing out
on something I want .... but, fish in the sea.

&gt;&gt; Truth to tell, I don't think it'll happen. What should be regulated: The
&gt;&gt; quantity of adverts on any given page. Who should regulate it: Self
&gt;&gt; regulation would be nice (& perhaps the only likely way it'd work).
&gt; 
&gt; So the way to do this is to not view pages with too many ads... and support

Another option is what Dan Shearer mentioned to me (He thought I was
someone else when he said it), what he said was "Tell them about
junkbusters." ( <A HREF="http://www.junkbusters.com">http://www.junkbusters.com</A> ) It is basically a proxy
which'll filter out adverts. I'm checking out diiifferent options
(suggested on the web page) until I find one I like. Currently I'm
looking at Guidescope, though I doubt I'll keep it in place for long.
