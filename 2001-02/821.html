&gt; &gt; PHP is a scripting language, Java is a programming language.
&gt; &gt; So using PHP for programming tasks wouldn't be a good idea.
&gt; &gt; Using Java for scripting tasks is inefficient.
&gt;
&gt; This is the sort of thing I am interesting in looking at now,
&gt; rather than discovering that our chosen technology isn't up to
&gt; the job when it starts to crumble. Scalability, scalability,
&gt; scalability.

I think you'll find that performance can be quite comparable whether you are
using PHP, mod_perl, Java Servlets or JSPs...

&gt; Don't want to go overboard, as we won't have to scale *that
&gt; high...probably around 5G of data, 100-200 simultaneous users
&gt; (worst case.)

I think you'll find that the main difference between the Java-type solutions
and the PHP/Perl-type solutions is that Java has a slightly higher overhead,
but if you do it right, it scales better from a developer's perspective.
It's better for more complex, heavy-weight development efforts... If you're
doing somethign fairly simple, and a simple ScriptingLanguage to Database
connection is ok for your architecture, then go PHP or perl. If it's
complex, and you want to have a middleware layer (EJB, CORBA, etc), go Java.
ie:

PHP looks like:

PHP(presentation and business logic) -- database...

Java looks like:

JSP/Servlets (Presentation) -- MiddleWare (Business Logic, oftenwith CORBA
or EJB) -- Database...

&gt;
&gt; A big factor in what platform we go for is ease of development.
&gt; Not like windows-level easy, but we don't want to spend a day
&gt; writing a simple database driven app.

hmm... depends how simple :)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Although writing a PHP page to "listen for" requests might
&gt; &gt; appear easier, PHP isn't likely to have the grunt to parse
&gt; &gt; the XML, apply business rules and do a series of complex
&gt; &gt; database transactions.
&gt;
&gt; That is an interesting topic: I have just written an application
&gt; in PHP that did all those things! (Not many business rules though.)
&gt;
&gt; With things like optimizers and now script caching, PHP is
&gt; looking better for enterprise stuff. As I said, we won't be
&gt; runnning absolutely massive sites, and if we scale our dev
&gt; platform up too high we will lock customers out because our
&gt; development bill is too high for their small-medium site.
&gt;
&gt; Interestingly, PHP can interface to Java objects, so perhaps
&gt; you could use both for different scenarios...write the simple
&gt; stuff with PHP, but use Java when it comes to some heavy
&gt; duty operations, or if PHP demonstrates that it is not up
&gt; to certain tasks.

Personally, I would suggest choosing one appropriate technology and sticking
with it. You'll run into far few problems this way...
