&gt; The alternative would be to convince one of the Local Government

Sponsorship is unlikely, as the state government is ripping
funding out of council libraries.

Libraries are more than happy to receive donations of
books from hobbyist groups.  For example, the Aussi
Masters swimming clubs contribute books on swim coaching
to the library on Kintore St, City.

This isn't cost-free to the library.  Despite that, they make an
effort to get contributed items catalogued and shelved quickly.

A quick browsing of my bookshelf suggests that we need about $1,500
to make a worthwhile donation of books that would adequately
cover UNIX computing.  Mind you, this would be something
excellent to do, as it would genuinely make Linux cheap to
install and configure.  So maybe we need to start making
chocolate crackles.

Being serious for a moment, that might do it.

  $1 * 70 people at meeting * 10 meetings = $700

So if we got a core of people together to supply an snack during
the meeting break we could fund a decent range of computing
books for the Adelaide library in about two years.

Thoughts?
