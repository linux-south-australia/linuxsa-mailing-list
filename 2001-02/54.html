&gt; Basically "We can't make money selling this OS, so it must be bad for us".

In a business, "we can't make money with X" _does_ mean "X is bad [or
rather, not good] for us". Of course, it is possible to make money with
Linux and OS software, so it's not neccessarily bad for a company (although
it was bad for the likes of Corel, since they seemed incapable of making
money from it...)

&gt; Also some extraordinary misinformation "if it isn't MSWord format
&gt; is must be
&gt; unsuitable" - rtf isn't good enough, or dont they know about it?

rtf isn't good enough. 99% of the known world uses MS .doc, .xls, .mdb,
.ppt, etc. _Any_ weakness in reading or writing these file formats in
exactly the same way as the MS products do will be seen as incompetance by
the average user or IT Manager. Most businesses want to be seen to be on the
leading edge wrt technology, and atm, this means Office2000. They will be
embarrassed in front of their clients if they can't read (or have trouble
reading) the latest MS Word .doc format document ("oh, we can only accept
files in MS Word 97 format" makes them sound 3 years off the pace -- MS
using the year for their version number and ensuring incompatible file
formats was a piece of marketing genius...). Additionally, given the fact
that most users find it hard to work out if they are running Windows 97 or
Word 98, imagine the trouble they will have with trying to make Word 2000
save in thie "RTF" format, and the confusion when they open the document,
and word asks them if they want to convert to .doc format... "What's a
format? Is that like Bold or Italic?" ... ... ...
