David,

I would consider myself to be a typical Windows developer that
may, in the future, like to move across to Linux. The majority
of us have spent many years using Visual C++ and Basic, FoxPro,
C++ Builder, JBuilder and Delphi etc. I'm confident that if tools
are made available for Linux that are very similar to what we
are use to will assist in the migration from Windows.

I'm sure the tools you mentioned are quite good...however I have
my doubts they enable the same ease of development as the above
programs (have you used them?). I may be incorrect...if so, please
demonstrate the RAD capabilities at a future user group meeting.

I agree that in some circumstances Linux may be a better solution
...what I don't agree with is ignoring Microsoft products purely
on the basis that it comes from Microsoft. To answer your question
...since I am more familiar with W2K and IIS..and provided those
tools can achieve the outcome adequately...I would implement them.
However...since your example stated that I had knowledge in RH6.2
and Apache (which I don't)...cost would definitely be a factor...
and yes I would probably choose this option instead.

I apologise if I gave the impression that I was accusing some on
this list as following the "Linux" religion. I welcome healthy
debate on why Linux products should be used rather then Microsoft
alternatives...but it needs to be unbiased...not just a forum for
Microsoft bashing...IMHO.

Sure a number of factors do need to be considered when determining
the software a business should use...but to suggest that by using
"non-free" software the IT staff have no idea...and management is
incompetent is absolute rubbish.

Why be wary of Borland's motives...it is obvious...they want to
create a niche market...for the purpose of profit (how nasty!!!).
If they weren't in business to make a profit then I think as a
shareholder you would be in your rights to lodge that claim. I'm
not sure what will be the licencing arrangement...either way how
does this stop you developing open software?

Regards,
Richard Watkins

Richard!

&gt; With all due respect I'm yet to see a development suite
&gt; under Linux with the same level of functionality that
&gt; Kylix should allow...although I am happy to admit that
&gt; I could be wrong.

Do you know how to:

* program gnome or gtk+?
* program Qt?

In turn, have you ever:

* used GLADE?
* used KDevelop?

Both these widget sets contain drop in components that range from the
simple combo boxes, to whole pre_made default menus, to editors that
will highlight and indent C programs automatically...

Not only that, but providing you have the right GLADE module - really an
XSL translator - you can turn GLADE into:

* gtk+ under C
* gtk-- for C++ (yes, gtk-- is a C++ widget set)
* gtk+ under PERL

And even more...

&gt; I will not be drawn into a discussion about the so-called
&gt; incompetence of Microsoft products...

I am not drawing you into a discussion about that at all. I was pointing
out that under a set of similar circumstances, and with nothing but
licencing cost - and perhaps reliability - Linux would be the most
sensible implementation. If, for example, you wanted a company web
server whose only purpose was to serve static web sites, and it was a
box all on its own, if you had the knowledge to drive IIS + Windows 2000
or RedHat 6.2 and Apache, would you:

* recommend Windows 2000?
* recommend RedHat 6.2 and Apache?

&gt; I am not as biased
&gt; as some on this list...they are all tools (including Linux)
&gt; ...not a religion.

Accusing some on this list of following a religion is an interesting way
to side-step a reasonable debate. I agree that all computer software and
their O/S's are tools and that some tools are more suited to some jobs
than others.

&gt; However, if I was an investor in a company that focuses
&gt; on the development of applications under KDE or Gnome I
&gt; would encourage them to purchase "non free" software if
&gt; it allowed them to produce the finished product in a
&gt; quicker time then "free" software.

This is a decision that requires a number of factors. 

&gt; In closing it appears that a free version will be available
&gt; for open-source and free-software (GPL) development...what
&gt; else could you ask for...see link below for more details:

So, you have to pay to make closed source software and not pay to make
open source software. 

I applaud Borland's decision in releasing Delphi/Builder for Linux (call
it Kylix if you will), but I am cynically wary of their motives. Do you
know if Kylix itself will be released under GPL or LGPL? If it and its
itinerant library are not, then you may as well write under closed
source...
