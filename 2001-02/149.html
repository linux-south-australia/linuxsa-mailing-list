&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently installing a linux server in a public primary school to interface
&gt; with the sa.edu.au SINA internet system.

I work in a Catholic school and we'll be headed down the same track
shortly (ie, last August :0)).

&gt; The point of installing this server is to do SMB, (hence preventing them from
&gt; installing NT), and installing squid to do proxy caching and do all
&gt; authentication against the SINA squid authentication module so that all the
&gt; little kids only have to remember one user name and password, so they just type
&gt; in their windoze login, and they don't neeed to authenticate against a proxy
&gt; server to get web access.

[snip]

&gt; The only thing we are having troubles with is squid.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone tryed to get squid to authenticate to another squid server or
&gt; anything similar. If so, we'd love to see some config scripts etc or how you've
&gt; done it !

Squid authentication modules are just standard executable programs.
Squid runs the program, which accepts the username and password
seperated by a space on stdin. The module does it's thing and then
displays either ERR or OK on stdout. Try running the module by itself
from the command line. This will tell you whether it's the module's
config that's broken or whether it's squid's. These types of modules
usually accept their configuration from the command line arguments you
provide, so check these.

You could also run tcpdump whilst testing the module, so that you can
see how it talks to their servers. I would be quite interested to see
how they're doing it (I think it might be radius).

Hope it helps,
Matt
