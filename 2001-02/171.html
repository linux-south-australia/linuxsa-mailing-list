I'm experiencing a fairly "weird" error with my time server. "ntpdate -d
my.time.server" shows:

6 Feb 14:21:46 ntpdate[12803]: step time server [ip address] offset
-3543.085861 sec

It's a local machine that synchronises to its own internal clock. I know
this isn't the perfect setup but I'm attempting to get a proof of
concept working. Now the time server "xntpd" baulks presumably because
of the offset (of 64 hours). Now it's on a local network, it pings
sensibly (between 0.unmeasurable to 0.3ms response time at the worst),
the hardware clocks are within 1 minute of each other.

* What does the offset field actually mean?

The people who wrote the documentation for xntpd are quite obviously
programmers who can write an excellent program but not terribly useful
documentation. They've explained - to the finest detail - how time
service works but have forgotten that not everyone actually understands
the terminology and hence it may as well be techno-babble.

&lt;sigh&gt;

After this experience I might see if the LDP would accept a
"XNTPD3/NTPD4 Setup Howto" that didn't contain so much information that
the wood gets lost for the trees.

* What would cause the offset to be such a ridiculously high number?

I have other machines on the same network and same subnet that display
results such as this:

6 Feb 14:37:23 ntpdate[1650]: adjust time server [ip.address] offset
0.000029 sec

ps

I sent this message once already but it hasn't appeared in, like 15
hours...so if you get it twice, sorry :-P
