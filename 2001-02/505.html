No, Alan.  Anyone who wants to license his code will need to talk to
them.  Existing licenses can continue, however.

 &gt; Software is not like audio CDs and novels, which are essentially
 &gt; _fixed_ works which earn money through replication.
 &gt; Software must constantly change.
 &gt; Copyright law was not written
 &gt; to take account of this continuous-change aspect of software.
 
I din't understand why you'd make that assertion.  It's obviously
wrong. 

For what it's worth, I also don't quite understand why you think these
issues kick in when someone dies.  I can write a couple of sentences
on a piece of paper which will assign all the rights for all the software
I hold copyright on over to you, and that'd create exactly the same
situation:  people would then need to come to you to license what was
once my code, and any license which was granted before the transfer
remains in effect.  As far as copyright is concerned, there's not much
that's particularly special about death, apart from the fact that the 
lifetime of the copyright will start to lapse.

[ it will in Australia, anyway.  In the US it probably won't:  Section
  8, clause 8 of the US consitution says, "[The Congress shall have power]
  To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for
  limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
  respective writings and discoveries constitution".  Note that the "limited
  time" isn't actually specified.  Congress keeps voting to extend it;
  it used to be for a fixed number of years, then it was after the copyright
  owner died, then it was 7 years after they died, then it was 20 years,
  and it's now 50.  Soon they'll probably vote to make it 100.

  The cynics call this the "Disney Amendment," because the number of years
  before the expiration of copyright tends to map pretty closely to the
  number of years since Walt Disney's death.  And we couldn't have Mickey
  Mouse turned over to the public domain when Disney is making so much money
  out of it, could we? ]

 &gt; Presumably the copyright would still apply to a modified
 &gt; work, because that would be like a book with spelling
 &gt; errors corrected or a few footnotes added, or like a
 &gt; re-mix of an audio CD.
 &gt; But derived work might be less clear.
 
They're usually equivalent.  It depends on the license.  You can formulate
a license which covers derived works (whether a court will uphold those
clauses in the license probably depends on the court's overall opinion of
the construction of the license, but that's no different to copyright
in any other sphere anyway).

For what it's worth, the Digital Agenda Copyright Act 2000 (which 
amends the Copyright Act 1968) doesn't talk about derived works at all,
so the treatment of derived software is exactly the same as the general
treatment of derived works in other parts of the Copyright Act.

 &gt; The concept of "benefits" maybe does not apply to
 &gt; open source software, since the main benefit might only
 &gt; be fame or something.

I'm not sure that that makes any difference.

 &gt; It seems like copyright confers:
 &gt; 1.	The right to receive moneys earned from the work.
 &gt; 2.	The right to control the work artistically.
 &gt; But (1) does not apply to free software, and (2) does not
 &gt; apply if the artist is dead.
 
You've artificially restricted the set of rights which copyright confers.
It also provides the right to transfer any or all of those rights to a 
third party.  You can do it by selling the copyright, signing it over to
someone for free, or by having it disposed with the rest of your estate
after you've died.

You can also choose to give up your copyright (by donating your work
to the public domain).

 &gt; That's why I'm asking. I don't see linuus' heirs taking over
 &gt; his supervisory role. Nor do I see linux making money, unless the
 &gt; heirs want to also release the code in a non-free form.

Perhaps he'll donate it to the public domain in his will.  Perhaps he'll
will it to someone else.  Perhaps he'll do nothing, and it'll be tied up
for years with lawyers, before being claimed by the Government with other
parts of his esate which didn't appear in the will.  Who knows?  Ask him.

 &gt; The case of the linux is very muddled by the fact that
 &gt; there are hundreds or thousands of authors now.
 &gt; But even in the case of single-author software, the
 &gt; interpretation of copyright is not clear to me.
 
Don't confuse "author" with "copyright owner" (authors can sign their rights
to others).  Also don't confuse the set of events which occur when one
author dies with the set of events which can occur when the copyright owner
dies.

Linux is essentially an anthology.  Copyright law has long been able to
cope with the concept of an anthology of works by lots of different authors:
Each author retains the rights over their work, but there's a separate 
compilation copyright over the anthology.

 &gt; My prediction is that if linus _was_ eaten by a shark, then
 &gt; linux would immediately fork, and there would be multiple
 &gt; supervisory committees, each claiming to channel the true
 &gt; spirit of linux.

So why doesn't that happen right now?  I think there's a fairly strong
social dynamic in the open source world *against* that kind of conduct.
It doesn't seem particularly realistic to me here.

 &gt; Someone might then buy the copyright to linus' work from the
 &gt; heirs for a large sum of money, and they might try to make
 &gt; really big trouble!

They can do that.  They can't affect existing GPL license grants, though,
so the net effect of that would be zero (so the code would fork into
"costs dollars" and "free", and the free one would continue in exactly the
way it's working now, and the "costs dollars" one wouldn't get used by
anyone).

 &gt; In fact, I would say that this would be very likely indeed.

Do you have some kind of reason for thinking that, or are you just making
this all up?
