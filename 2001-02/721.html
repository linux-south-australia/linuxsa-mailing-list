&gt; Has anyone had any experiences in setting up high-availability
&gt; load-balancing
&gt; etc etc web servers? (I should add that they will be serving dynamic
&gt; content.)
&gt; 

High avaialability is probably not going to be an  issue.

Engineering a high avaiablity linux system is no different to enginerering
an NT one, exceopt teh OS tends to not need as much work and I suspect
less reboots. Obviously liek any os, it is best to keep to mature well
undestod version, unless there is some really pressing reason to use a new
version (eg security patch, new feature you just cant live without).

The hardware issues are of course similaar.

Hardware and software raid are available, however if you plan on using pre
existing equpimewnt you will ahve to make sure that appropriate linux
drivers can be avaialbe.

In particular many of the mother boards which have "hardware raid" dont
really seem to have hardware raid, they seem to have some sort of hack
based in bios and requiring (typically win 32) drivers.

Sola UPS have source code avaialbe drivers for interfacing with thier
UPS.

As for load balancing, how do you currently do it?

There are a few ways of doing it I beleive some invlove hardware, if you
have that hardware(eg layer 3 "switches"), there will probably be little
difference to the way you do it now.

Ditto dns based load balancing, except mayeb now you migth use bind
instead of whatever it si you use on NT as your dns.

If your currnet web server/os do some magic then you may have to look at
some of these other solutions eg hardware based or dns based to achieve
your load balancing.
