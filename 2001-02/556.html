&gt; They can do that.  They can't affect existing GPL license grants, though,
&gt; so the net effect of that would be zero (so the code would fork into
&gt; "costs dollars" and "free", and the free one would continue in exactly the
&gt; way it's working now, and the "costs dollars" one wouldn't get used by
&gt; anyone).
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; In fact, I would say that this would be very likely indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have some kind of reason for thinking that, or are you just making
&gt; this all up?

Mark,

Well, I know that this has appeared briefly in slashdot also, but....

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/16928.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/16928.html</A>

This article is exactly the kind of "give me back my trademark"
thing that I was thinking of.
And Yl&ouml;nen isn't even dead yet.
Now I know that there are differences between the SSH situation
and the linux situation, but there is some points of similarity here too.

If you transpose the SSH story a bit, I could envisage the heirs of
Linus (after the shark attack) 4 years afterwards suing the
perpetrators of FreeLinux for using the Linux trademark and
harming the shareholder value of the Linux Software Corporation Inc.

So, no, I was not just making this up for light entertainment.
And by a curious coincidence, Yl&ouml;nen is apparently a Finn!
The parallels are eerie.
Just run the clock forward to 5 years after the shark, and
there you have it.
It might make a good movie...
A shark, ideological warfare, California swimming pools,
corporate intrigue.....
Well now I'm starting to make it up.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
