&gt;I'm keen. I think that Simon needs to be careful about pluggin too much, 
&gt;but
&gt;I'm sure he will... perhaps we should invite a telstra and/or other
&gt;telco/ISP in to give a counter to the Agile push... I'm keen for Simon to
&gt;give a talk with no plugs or criticisms, then 2 mins for any ISP to plug or
&gt;whatever.

You can't really blame him for plugging Agile/Internode, and seeming that 
everyone kinda knows his position on this one, does it really matter anyway. 
I mean, Telstra is going to plug Bigpond, Optus will plug theirs, iPrimus, 
theirs, etc, etc. It's just a fact of business!!!

However, I think that if asked, judging by the way he talks in the emails on 
linuxsa, he would give as unbiased opinion as possible. (thats only a 
judgement made by reading his emails, I haven't met the guy) Besides that 
like I said before, everyone or most people would almost be expecting 
Agile/IPA plugs, as he would more than likely use it as an example, and why 
not, he is in the perfect position to do so.

If Simon does a talk on ADSL then I think I would try to actually make it to 
a Linuxsa meeting. I have yet to do so!!!!

My 2.2 cents worth :-) &lt;G&gt;

Regards,

Michael
