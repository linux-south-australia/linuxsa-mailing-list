&gt; &gt; what about the use of the trademark "Linux"?
&gt; 
&gt; It's not entirely clear in my mind.  My thinking is that Linus wrote this
&gt; software named, "Linux", and granted free access for anyone to use it, which
&gt; I think implies the right to use the trademark (e.g. "I'm running Linux"; or
&gt; "I'm distributing Linux.")  If you modify Linux is it still Linux?  I think
&gt; perhaps it is, because modifying it is another right that Linus granted.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't want to go to court on just my thinking.

Indeed not.  The intellectual property rights of copyright and trade
marks
are distinct.  So the GPL license that allows you to modify Linux source
code gives you no rights to the Linux trademark.

The "Linux" trademark, at least in the US, was granted to Linus
Torvalds by a US court after someone tried to misuse it.  Linus
delegates the day-to-day maintenance of the trademark to Linux
International.

LI, on Linus' behalf, has registered "Linux" in some other countries,
yet others have followed the lead of the US court.  Linux is not a
registered trademark in Australia -- however, laws do not require
registration for a trademark to be in practical effect.  I've had
this explained to me by a lawyer for the AARNet name: it was insanely
complex, so if it matters to you, get some legal advice.

Some years ago Linus posted a rough policy on the use the Linux
trademark
to the linux-kernel list.  If it matters to you, go and look for it.
