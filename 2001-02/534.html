&gt; I know there's been a discussion about linux in school and in workstations,
&gt; but i was quite disgusted when i had to summarize a piece out of my
&gt; computing text book at school. This chapter was on Operating systems,
&gt; Network operating systems was one of the subheadings. What i was totally
&gt; offended by was that not once did it mention Linux OR UNIX as a networking
&gt; OS or server OS. They did mention OS's like Novell, Windows NT (oh of
&gt; course) and LANtastic, but no Linux nor UNIX. Like lets be serious here,
&gt; what kind of OS is windows NT, one tiny lil thing it doesnt like it asks for
&gt; you to reboot it 1000 times a day, before the poor little IT tech has to
&gt; come and fix it.

That's funny, becasue I thought Lantastic was a Peer-Peer network system,
without needing a dedicated server.  At least version 6 & 7 were like that back
in the dark ages of thinking DOS was cool and desqview was awesome :)

&gt; This was only one thing i was quite offended by, there was another, that
&gt; same day. My teacher also offended me about linux too! simply because of his
&gt; naivity towards anything but Mac OS or Microshaft products. I was talking
&gt; about cable and how he has his puters all connected up to cable at home. He
&gt; was saying how he has a NT workstation running wingate, i then told him
&gt; about my setup, my Linux gateway/server. He was like "A *LINUX* server" like
&gt; who would ever use something like that. I then went on to explain to him
&gt; that when he has to reboot his windows NT machine several times a day, i can
&gt; leave my very low powered linux server on for months on end without even
&gt; getting close to wanting a reboot. He then uttered some bullshit to try and
&gt; convince me NT was better and then told me to sit down as he was about to
&gt; start the lesson.

I'd be curious to know exactly the contents of the "Bullshit" he uttered, some
of it might have even made sense, although NT being better is only a relative
thing, it's better at being NT than linux is at being NT.

&gt; I must admit, for somethings, windows NT may be the better option, but when
&gt; it comes to running a server, nothing can beat the reliability and sheer
&gt; power of LINUX! *roar* :)

This is true, NT does have it's place, But wouldn't it be more prudent to
reflect on the power and flexibility of Unices in general?  I know quite a few
people using Free/Net/Open BSD platforms, and one in particuly was quite adamant
about FreeBSD being really good, and from his POV the BSD Daemon is cuter than
Tux :)

Anyway, this being slightly beside the point, in fact I haven't got a clue what
the point was, so it's probably a good idea to completely disregard this email
before sending all flames to /dev/null

Cheers

Tim
