&gt;  &gt; (3) She also sent a "Microsoft Word" document as an attachment.
&gt;  &gt; Reading such documents requires proprietary software that the reader
&gt;  &gt; must pay Bill Gates for.  The reason we have communication standards
&gt;  &gt; (like the Internet RFC 822 that defines the format of email messages)
&gt;  &gt; is so that one vendor can't lock us in and require us to pay them in
&gt;  &gt; order to communicate with others.  If Rep. Eshoo isn't a believer in
&gt;  &gt; monopoly, she should communicate in public standards rather than
&gt;  &gt; proprietary formats.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On a related topic, I find it objectionable that my new computers have
&gt; been vandalized with various stickers and unsolicited markings inside
&gt; and out.  Perhaps this viewpoint would be of interest to your email list.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a letter I addressed to an email address at the site of one
&gt; of these unsolicited markings on the outside of my new computer, together
&gt; with their well-thought-out reply:
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; Subject: Vandalism of informatic property (unsolocited advertising+virus)
&gt; Cc: <A HREF="mailto:mann@eecg.toronto.edu">mann@eecg.toronto.edu</A>

&gt;
&gt; Recently I purchased four new computers, and I requested that they be
&gt; shipped with no operating system, because we develop our own software
&gt; in my lab, and we have a policy against using Closed Source software or
&gt; operating systems.  Therefore, we would expect blank hard drives.
&gt;
&gt; However, all four of my new computers appear to have been contaminated
&gt; with informatic detritus of some kind, which appears to include
&gt; an unsolicited advertisement.  In particular the word "Windows",
&gt; which appears to be a trademark of your corporation, appears on each
&gt; of my computers when booted.
&gt;
&gt; Presently, we are posting a copy of this waste material to our main WWW
&gt; server to seek advice from the computer science community as a whole,
&gt; on how best to dispose of it, as well as advice on what fee would be
&gt; reasonable for us to charge for its disposal.
&gt;
&gt; We are also seeking advice from the community, and hoping that other
&gt; scientists can analyze these waste products to confirm their origin,
&gt; as well as give us advice on how best to decontaminate our systems,
&gt; and to obtain three independent quotations for having this unwanted
&gt; material verifiably removed from our computers.
&gt;
&gt; Since the hard drives in question are each approximately 40 gigabytes,
&gt; and the best way for us to make this waste matter available to other
&gt; scientists for analysis has been to "dd" the entire hard drive contents
&gt; to our WWW site, this requires considerable space on our main file
&gt; server that supports or WWW server.
&gt;
&gt; Accordingly, we seek a storage fee for this waste matter, until such
&gt; time as we can collect sufficient opinions on how best to dispose of it,
&gt; and to ensure that it has not adversely affected any of our computers,
&gt; as well as how best to ensure that new computers we order in the future
&gt; are not similarly contaminated.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice you can provide on the nature of this waste product would
&gt; be greatly appreciated, especially if it might expedite the analysis
&gt; so that we can free up the 160 gigabytes of space on our WWW server
&gt; that the samples occupy.
&gt;
&gt; The unsolicited message displayed on the screens seem to partly match
&gt; a sticker that was found on the side of each computer reading "Windows
&gt; 2000 Professional 1-2 CPU Certificiate of Authenticity".
&gt;
&gt; It might seem, therefore, that your corporation would be the
&gt; corporation responsible for contamination of my computers with
&gt; this waste product, virus, or unsolicited advertising material.
&gt;
&gt; Please advise if your company can assume blame for this deliberate
&gt; vandalism of my new computer, or if this was an accidental act and
&gt; merely a result of negligence on the part of your company.
&gt;
&gt; I would welcome your comments on what fee you feel might be
&gt; reasonable fee for disposing of this material, and how long we should
&gt; need to keep it publically available on our WWW server for reasonable
&gt; analysis.
&gt;
&gt; I am sending to this email address because this is the address that
&gt; I find from visiting the WWW site that appears on the unsolicited
&gt; stickers attached to the outsides of my new computers.
&gt;
&gt; I will also be scanning the surfaces of my computers and posting copies
&gt; of these stickers to the WWW in order to obtain a quote for having
&gt; them removed from the outsides of my computers and having the housings
&gt; cleaned.
&gt;
&gt; If you can advise on a removal process for these unsolicited
&gt; advertising stickers, or what you feel you might be willing
&gt; to pay as a reasonable fee for their removal, please advise.
&gt;
