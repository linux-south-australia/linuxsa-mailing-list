Charles!

&gt; All I'm saying is that I won't be held responsible for your actions.  If you
&gt; decide you want to use this list on your server then go ahead.  If not then
&gt; don't.  Which ever way you choose it's on you.  At the moment that is the
&gt; stand that I have.  Now, this may of course change in the future but for now
&gt; that's the way I see it.

That's not exactly what you're saying.

&gt; Do you have a permenant IP?

David is Rebel's main administrator. So he takes care of MANY IPs.

&gt; If so and you don't hack then why are you
&gt; worried?

Because I have downloaded nmap and various other things. Because I can,
with enough effort, crack sites BEFORE he is aware. Now, I know that
David (Newall) would throw me out of Rebel as soon as he detected it,
but the way you've structured this wouldn't take it into account.

&gt; hurt.  So how you would be denied at thier site if you have done nothing, is
&gt; something I don't understand.

If your list denies a whole ISP's subnet then it's very possible. Given
that hosts.deny accepts subnets, I'd be interested to know how youre
list would react if I fed it 0.0.0.0.0 (i.e. ALL IP ADDRESSES) .

&gt; Germany where hackers and script kiddies are a friggin plague.  It is hard
&gt; to find a network over here sometimes that doesn't have problems about being
&gt; denied at some sites.

Hmmmm...Germany must have problems. I've not encountered one ISP here
that has any problems apart from the usual "my router died" ineptitudes
(Making it E.... for You)...

&gt; Do you really want AOL users on you server anyway? ;) just a joke.

No such thing as a joke. Tough. AOL is still the biggest ISP in America
I believe. So you would piss just about every company in the WORLD who
wants to market to the American market because some d*k*h*d decided to
put aol.com on your deny.list...AOL has a lot of money. And on staff
lawyers.

You won't win a case on them with what you've stated on your web-site.
Trust me. I don't think you'd need a lot of money to knock your
arguments over legally and AOL have millions to spend on legal fees (US
dollars) because they have billions to lose if they don't.

&gt; OK next
&gt; time I'll go kick my dog instead. (hint: that was a joke too. hehe).

Fine. You can't be touched by Australian law there. But in SA, that's a
legal act of cruelty and the RSPCA or a respectable citizen could sue
you on the dog's behalf.

&gt; Anyway, like I said at the moment it's not a large list at all.  Just 10
&gt; ip's for now.  Have about 500+ waiting though.  Am also trying to figure out
&gt; the best way to setup the whole thing.  If you have any good ideas I'd love
&gt; to hear them.  I'm totally open to suggestions.  PLEASE! hehe.

Hmmmm...only 10 bad internet addresses. Maybe we are being paranoid...
