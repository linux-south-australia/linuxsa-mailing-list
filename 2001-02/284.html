Hmmm...

I've just installed Mandrake 7.2 from the APC Linux Pocketbooks.
Notably:

1) Setup

I had to use vgalo to get the X setup to work correctly. My first
attempt got me the wonderful squiggly mess that X makes when it simply
tries to overdrive one's hardware. After a while I read the first page
and pressed F1 to get a proper lilo prompt.

2) Setup Observations

- partitioning

The setup was OK. I had a time of it fiddling with the partitions. I'm
used to fdisk so these GUI partition/fdisk things are foreign to me and
in my opinion, DrakFdisk (for want of a better description) was no worse
than Disk Druid and just as confusing. It had an "automatic select"
option which probably would have done things automatically for me but I
didn't try it.

I couldn't find fdisk itself.

The worse thing I found was that I couldn't quite fathom how one gets
extended partitions. I'm still not sure whether I have one.

- package selection

I have a really small hard drive. Hence, it complained even when I had
no packages selected. Selecting packages by hand was painful, slow and
annoying but I've come to expect this. Woe to those who attempt to
install any Linux distro from Mandrake, Suse or Redhat (and probably
Debian) onto a 1Gb hard drive and expect not to have to wade through
tonnes of options working out what you really need.

- installation

Installation went very smoothly. It was slower than a text based RH 6.2
install but still :-) I was running it under X.

- GRUB options

Any newcomer would be confused by the expert grub configuration. GUI or
not...but I managed. Looking at GRUB it has a setup that is as esoteric
as NT-LOADER, and apart from the fact that you see things Linux in a
grub configuration file its configuration format is suspiciously
NT-LOADER boot.ini'ish.

3) First boot

The first things I noticed was that it was SLOW. Bit time SLOW. I make
this complaint about RedHat installs too, but this was even slower than
RH 6.2 default installation. I diagnosed the problem as:

* kernel

Mandrake - even more so than RedHat - seem to turn on every option they
think you might need. Whilst most of them are modules, a significant
number aren't. Furthermore, it had decided that my <A HREF="mailto:AMD-K6-III@450">AMD-K6-III@450</A> was an
i486 and hence I got landed with i486 kernels. At least, this is what I
think is happening.

* setup

Not much different from RedHat. In fact, I'd say if you knew RedHat
you'd probably be able to bumble around Mandrake without too much
hassle. In fact, if you avoided any of the "Drak" GUI utilities you
could probably not even notice you're using Mandrake.

Now, after a serious rebuild of the kernel (with my usual piles of
optimisations) it is going faster. But I'm still convinced my rebuilt RH
6.2 is faster....oh well.

4) Final Comments

It's another distribution. It appears to work. If it's supposed to be
optimised for speed, then Mandrake's definition of speed is different to
mine, but then again I must remember that I've recompiled almost every
library and every major program on my main computer.
