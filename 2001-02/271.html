Richard!

&gt; Have you ever actually used an IDE like Delphi/C++Builder/JBuilder or MS's
&gt; Visual Studio?

I've developed a basic installer in Delphi. I have played with JBuilder.
In addition, about 7 years ago I developed a "match making" program
under Visual Basic (Version 3 I think). I didn't put the interface
together but I did code the backend and so forth. 

&gt; I don't think you have.

As an integrated development environment they are all quite good. They
seem to hail from the "everything under one box" style; whereas Unix (in
my opinion) tends to be more of a "lots of specialised tools glued
together using scripting tools such as bash". In my opinion, pulling
together:

* glade
* CVS
* autoconf and automake
* bash & PERL
* X

is an integrated development environment but it doesn't suffer from the
"everything under one box" or for that matter serious licencing issues.
And, having experienced a little development under both it takes more
knowledge to use glade et al. but this is knowledge that can actually
help you understand the program you're writing.

People who know how to "program JBuilder" or "program Delphi" don't
necessarily know how to program. I've come across a few source trees
that are essentially cobbled together messes.

My main point is that I'm not altogether convinced that this "all in
one" IDE drive (not of the hardware type) is the only way to go. 

&gt; I know that they are some of the best IDE tools available.

The emphasis is on "some". I'd hazard a guess that I haven't said they
are "bad" :-)
