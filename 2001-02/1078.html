&gt; Is it time to have a linuxSA meeting to discuss this point?

We already are.


&gt; I for one would like to see a body offering support to schools,
&gt; community and needy organisations too cash strapped to use MS stuff.

Ha!  Are you volunteering?  Then do so.  My goodness, we have trouble
getting people to stand up and talk once a month.  How will incorporation
change anything?

I'm in favour of incorporation, but lets understand the benefits, and leave
the la-la land out of it.  Incorporation will give us a legal entity, able
to make representation where otherwise we can't.  For example, *I* can be
on the SA IT council through my company; or indeed through AUUG.  I cannot
be on that council though LinuxSA because LinuxSA does not legally exist.
I can run public events through my company without risking my house, as
indeed can AUUG; I cannot do that through LinuxSA because LinuxSA does not
legally exist.

Incorporation will not permit LinuxSA to contract to rent the Convention
center for a week for $50,000, in order to hold a free event, because at
the end of the event LinuxSA will not be able to meet its debts, which the
officers should know.  If they made such a contract they would be personally
liable.  They probably would lose their houses, and they might well go to
gaol, too.

Is anybody still arguing this point?
