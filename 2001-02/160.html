I think the redhat 7 distro comes on 3 CDs, 2 of them for standard install
option and the third has extra stuff.

I think amongst the extra stuff is the X v4 rpms.

Try looking there if you have the 3 cds.

Sometimes people only get the first two CDs eg if they have burnt a copy
of downloaded ISOs, if that is the case, then you wiill have to try other
methods which other people will no doubt details.

&gt; Well here I am, a mere (linux) child ready to start the journey of a
&gt; thousand desktops but I don't know how to take that first step.
&gt; Seriously though folks, I updated my system from RH 6.2 to RH 7 and for
&gt; a home user so far I've had no complaints at all.
&gt; But the time comes that all us youngsters must venture out on our own
&gt; ........ well, I've just had a look and the world of X is very scary :)
&gt; What I want to do is to upgrade from X3.3.6 to X4, but how do I get
&gt; there?
&gt; I've tried to find a HOWTO on it but unsuccessfully, all I've been able
&gt; to find was the FDU HOWTO
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/FDU/index.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/FDU/index.html</A> , but this basically
&gt; advocates downloading the entire thing, Hmmm says me as I contemplate my
&gt; limited bandwidth (scratches head), I should be able to upgrade off my
&gt; RH7 CD, but how? (scratches head and searches CD until severe baldness
&gt; sets in)
&gt; Well I've got almost no where, is it worthwhile downloading the whole of
&gt; XFree86 - 4 or can I upgrade easily off the CD?
&gt; Here's hoping that the 1000 mile journey will be an easy one, (crosses
&gt; fingers).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; David Creed.
