&gt; 
&gt; Good morning! (At least here in Norway).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Very interesting reading! :) Notes on the way:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 1. He speaks about TOPS-20, ITS (the Incompatible Timesharing System),
&gt;&gt; Multics, Apollo Domain, the Lisp Machine, Cedar/Mesa, and the Dorado but
&gt;&gt; what realtion it have to Microsoft?!
&gt; 
perhaps ms is a bit like ali baba and the 40 theives.. he got rich but 
couldn't tell anyone how he got it :)

&gt; 
&gt; This dude Daniel who is hosting this page is one of the editors.
&gt; 
also notice he works for _'bill'_

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. Unix Gulag - he probably don't know meanin of this word (and such 
&gt; 
&gt; thing
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; isults me). My grandparents were in real Gulag and I know what it is.

so, i gather its not a nice word then?  My trusty dictionary says it's 
"Soviet security service, est 1930, responsible for prisons and forced 
labour camps". hmmm  gues he is not as good with words as he thinks.

&gt;&gt; 3. I used LispM in 91 and I had good impression from it but it can be 
&gt; 
&gt; used
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; only for acadeimcal purposes - not for real life.
&gt;&gt; 4. He probably forgot about that Unix started such thing as InterNet 
&gt; 

well, he probably wasn't born in _time_ to know that little snippet

&gt; (oh...
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; OK purists... ARPANET :) . What whole world will do if people awake 
&gt; 
&gt; tomorrow
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; and find that there no such things as email, www, ICQ, IRC and so on and 
&gt; 
&gt; on?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 5. If you will not maintain LispM system properly it will spiral down. So 
&gt; 
&gt; to
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; be "good operator of OS" you must be well trained - doesn't matter what 
&gt; 
&gt; OS
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; is.
&gt;&gt; 6. "In particular, thanks to Bill for increasing my swap space." - he 
&gt; 
&gt; mean
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Bill which I thinking about?! :)

can't see how 'bill' increased his swap space.. after all there is still 
a limit to how big it gets without becoming inefficient or confused 
(especially when the OS requires kludges to make it work)

perhaps he means william clinton?  his swap space was the oval office

&gt;&gt; 7. When this book will be released I will replace all "Unix" to "Windows"
&gt;&gt; and it will be PURE TRUTH! :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the first two lines there is a link to klick on. This will lead you to 
&gt; the table of contents wich also states that this book was published:
&gt; 
&gt; June 1994
&gt; 
&gt; It is:
&gt; 
&gt; 329 pages
&gt; 
&gt; And:
&gt;  includes free Unix Barf Bag :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly this book is now out of print :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Regards Jo
&gt;
