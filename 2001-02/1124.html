&gt; It's all a bit 1990's, isn't it? :-)  I can't quite understand the point
&gt; of lugging a library around from meeting to meeting when we're all connected
&gt; to the Internet.
&gt; 

Presumably becasue:
a) electronic versionoff books arent as common as we'd like(there does
seem to be a good umber of OReilly's titels in electronic formts)
b) publshing the text of books in an electronic form may well have soe
copyrright "issues"

Of course the library need not be lugged, it could remain in one place and
the booking and returns could be arranged electronitcally.

It is possibel tht under this scenario the whole library may not beed to
be lugged just those titles going in and out - iwth poular titles this
owudl probably mean just taking them from one person and hadnign tehm to
the next at the meeting.

It is also possible that the library not be conducted at the meeting.
Eg a sutiable locaton perhaps a business with an interest in the
organistion host the library. Loans and returns coudl then occur during
nomal business hours at a set location - look Ma no lugging!!

Once again reservation etc coudl ahppen electronicallyviw the we and the
books woudl meerely need to be checked in and out when physically
returned/borrowed.

I would be happy to write the software for this if we ever do
do this and an appropriate system does not already exist, however it might
not happen tomorrow, my spare time is not as copiuous as I'd like.

ps
no "lug" puns intended
