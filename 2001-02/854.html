&gt; Last year I brought up the suggestion that a talk about ADSL would
&gt; benefit LinuxSA users because we obviously have an interest in its role
&gt; out, availability and history. At this month's meeting, Alex Garner
&gt; (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:alex@netcraft.com.au">alex@netcraft.com.au</A>) informed us that a person with experience
&gt; in the area was available to give an impartial overview of ADSL issues.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe this would be of benefit and that it should happen. The only
&gt; question, Alex, is when...

David,

Mea culpa.  I had offered to organise an ADSL presentation
for the meeting just gone, but I am under somewhat of a timetable
pressure this month and had to withdraw.  Richard Sharpe then went
out of his way to fill in with a presentation on the excellent
work he is doing.

LinuxSA is a volunteer organsiation, and these things happen.

It is grossly unfair to take Alex to task over my failings.

I note that your name doesn't appear in the list of presentations
at:

I hope this is an oversight.

Glen
