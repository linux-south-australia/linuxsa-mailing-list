Chuck!

(Note that I'm CCing this to the LinuxSA mailing list as I think others might
get some benifit from it as well.)

Exactly what public services are you going to be running? Here are some of my
suggestions (ie, what I do):

mail: Web based mail using IMP (<A HREF="http://www.horde.org/imp/">http://www.horde.org/imp/</A>). Very nice interface.
I use it exclusivly for my work email now. It uses IMAP, so you have to have
IMAP running, but you can lock it down so that only the localhost can access it.
Make sure that your IMAPd is configured correctly and you continually check for
security updates.

<A HREF="ftp:">ftp:</A> Don't allow anonymous access, unless you desperately need it (ie, you are a
mirror for someone). If you are distributing your own software, you can do it
via http. If you do need to run it, make sure that you run a secure ftpd and
again, continually check for security updates.

dns: Run the latest stable version of bind. Do not allow zone transfers except
from anywhere except trusted, authorised hosts. Note that bind does not use
tcp_wrappers. Again, you need to continually check for security updates.

web: Run the latest stable version of Apache. Don't allow untrusted and untested
CGI scripts on your server. Make sure that you tighten down security on
.htaccess type files so that users can't override your settings. Again,
continually check for security problems and update as neccessary. Apache doesn't
use tcp_wrappers, unless you set it to inetd instead of standalone - and in my
opinion, on a personal site, that's just plain silly (running it from inetd that
is!).

shell: Are you really going to be providing shell access on your server? If you
are, then DO NOT do it using telnet, it is too easy to sniff passwords, for
starters. Run openssh version 2, and make sure that you have it tightened down.
If you are not providing shell access to the general Internet community, then
set up your tcp_wrappers to only allow it from trusted hosts.

Notice something repetitive? You ALWAYS need to be on top of security. I
recommend subscribing to two or three security related mailing lists. This
should give you a general 'feel' for things, and you can then research more into
anything that you think might affect you.

In the five (what I consider) most common services that I've listed above, only
three of them use tcp_wrappers, and in those that do, you can tighten it down to
trusted hosts, or at least not allow just anyone access to the computer.

I would be interested in finding out exactly what services you are / plan on
running. I still maintain that you do not need to blacklist IPs, you should deny
everything and then allow what you want. How is your server going to cope when
the list gets large? Remember that there are MILLIONS of hosts on the Internet,
and any one of them might be a hacker today, but tomorrow they might not be. I
would like to see how well your server copes when you get a few thousand hosts
in your database (let alone a few million??).

Remember, if you are providing a service for your customers (whether for free,
or for a charge) you have to make it easy for your users to get to your systems.
If they can't get in, then they will go to your competition, even if it costs
them a little bit more money. Think about this from a personal point of view for
a second, what would you rather in a hosting company: to be able to get in when
you need to to update your homepage, as a customer who your hosting company
trusts, for example, or to not be able to get in, and when you ask why, you're
told: well, 6 months ago that IP address was used to try and hack me and now I
don't trust it. Never mind the fact that it was 6 months ago, and it was done by
a dial-up user who only had that IP address for 25 minutes!

Think about it very closely, do you really want to run the risk of alienating
customers, who are very likely paying for your running costs!

Quoting "Charles Williams ( CEO ACNS )" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:cwilliams@acns-online.com">cwilliams@acns-online.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; This is for servers that offer public access to services with directly
&gt; connected to the web.  Not internal stuff.  Internal network security
&gt; is VERY simple as you stated.  External is something else.
