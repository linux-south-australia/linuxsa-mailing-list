Evan!

&gt; I applaude the introduction of Kylix I expect it's Borland's last gasp at
&gt; staying afloat.

Yes, I have a nasty suspicion it is too.

&gt; Background: At our last staff IT meeting the Linux issue came up following
&gt; discussions about the licensing costs of MS office etc. I suggested we give
&gt; Star/Open office a try We then moved to the topic of Linux as an
&gt; alternative to WinNT. I now have the dubious honour of devising a proof of
&gt; concept setup that open source based workstation is just as functional as
&gt; WinNT with MS apps.

Well if you need help there's always the list.

&gt; To compound it though we have internally developed applications (very much
&gt; core to the business) based on VB and SQL Server.

What can I say?

&gt; David suggested all the toolkits around for Linux but they just all seem
&gt; too hard too much hassle to setup and use.

You point and click and then use an editor of your choice to fill in the
blasted spaces. What more can I say? Are we so brainwashed by Microsoft
and Borland that we don't realise that something like GLADE which:

* sets up UI
* sets up callbacks (methods as Delphi calls them)

You do realise that you have to code the method button.click. You can't
RAD delphi into doing specialist things with your database. At some
stage RAD stops, and development must occur.

Call me absolutely stupid - and many have - but since when has
DELPHI/MICROSOFT VISUAL XYZ (c++, basic etc) - been anything more than a
quick interface creator. If DELPHI is as wonderful as you claim it is,
why can't it write the code for source forge without human intervention?

They're not too hard. Maybe you can't install Linux. Maybe setting up
GNOME with RedHat or Mandrake or Suse's installation programs is way
beyond your expertise. Maybe learning Qt is far too difficult for you.
Maybe you hate C. Use gtk and use perl, python or whatever. I don't
care. Perhaps clicking "Install Development Environment" is way too much
for you...

Methinks you haven't even bothered to even attempt to setup these
development environments and, possibly, you're not even aware they're on
your system. What you're saying is that the retraining necessary to use
one or more of these toolkits may prove too expensive. But to state that
they "seem too hard [and] too much hassle to setup and use" is not true
from my point of view.

I think, also, you're deliberately making gtk+ and Qt look difficult to
program when they're not. Geez, even I can write applications in them
and programming isn't one of my strenghs (although I understand source
code in virtually any existing language if it's presented to me)...

&gt; As a developer I would love the ability to move to Linux develop
&gt; applications in a RAD style in the same way I can with Win32 VB/Delphi. I
&gt; know there are lots of organisations of varying size who would make the
&gt; move once such an environment becomes available for Linux even if their
&gt; backend remains MS Sql Server the client software need not be MS.

Believe it or not I managed to pull together a match making program
using Visual Basic once. It was quite amusing, and a bit laborious. You
should try running a ranking algorithm in Visual Basic where you can't
guarantee all the ranks will be there. But I digress...you seem overtly
worried about the interface and blase (pronounced blah zay) about the
coding.

Worry about the coding. The interface is easy.

Admittedly, we might have to learn C or C++. I don't suppose Microsoft
developed Windows 2000 in Visual Basic or Delphi...I wonder why. Have no
idea. Maybe it wasn't the right tool for the choice...

&gt; Until such time I really cannot see MS based organisations like us making
&gt; the switch in a serious sense and currently I sadly suspect there will only
&gt; be a novelty factor in trying Kylix.

Look. If you pay me something like $10 000 000 I'll develop - in
collaboration with others - a RAD application that has similar
functionality to VB. Let the programmers think that programming is
Visual Lloy....I can see myself becoming the "Next Bill Gates [tm]"!!!

&gt; As to the licensing I think they should release a working demo version with
&gt; the DB objects so people can actually try it show it to the bosses and then
&gt; say it is far better than what we do or at least as good. I don't see our
&gt; organisation paying 1600 so I can experiment. If it proves worthwhile we
&gt; would not have a problem with paying the price for 3-4 licenses so long as
&gt; any run-time stuff is freely distributable.

I agree with you on that point.

And this ain't off topic...
