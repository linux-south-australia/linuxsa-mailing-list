It was Sun, 11 Feb 2001 23:57:32 +1000, when Richard said...
RS&gt; Hi,
RS&gt; 
RS&gt; I was trying to get my truetype fonts working so I can use Magicpoint, and
RS&gt; X would not start.
RS&gt; 
RS&gt; It kept complaining about not being able to find a font called fixed.
RS&gt; 
RS&gt; Has anyone seen this before?
RS&gt; 

Many of us have seen this before. The XFontServer is having problems locating your fixed font -- very important font that.
Try reordering your fontpaths...

Robyn: The unix/:7100 (or other number) is a reference to the font server port number. This is only applicable to the XFSTT server. XF4 is not crippled in this way.

Jake: X does not suck for this. You must remember that X wasn't designed for people with no idea to go and install 140,000 ttfs, and run a german theme that uses half of them. I also feel compelled to say that &lt;rant&gt;ing and then making a reference to a loop that involves GDM is fairly rude. GDM is beta, and loops involving *DM's are user faults. Sorry.
