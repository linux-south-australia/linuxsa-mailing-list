I am 100% behind this.

The Linux community world wide needs to formalise and be organised.  Who read the article on slashdot and in last weeks IT section of the Australian quoting Microsoft on saying that open source and Linux is a threat to innovation and policy makers should be educated about this?  Linux groups need to be political as well and development focused.  I use Linux
for political rather than technical reasons - even though it's technical credentials are great.  I would like to see more lobbying and organisation, transparency, accountability, publicity, marketing, etc, etc, etc.

I also believe we have duties as citizens also - some of which include providing an alternative software solution to low income earners, charity groups and other non profit organisations who can not afford MS software and consultants.

The list just goes on and on.  I am 100% behind incorporating Linux SA.  I have not been to very many meetings although I have followed the discussions closely and feel very strongly about Linux advocacy.  I for one would be pleased to hold an office position or even help out with publicity and marketing of Linux in South Australia, and help out in other way required.

Linux is a very serious endeavour now - billions of dollars are being invested in it.  Lets do our bit to make those investments worthwhile.

&gt;We should incorporate well before Installfest, have some transparent, clear
&gt;and active leadership, and continue on our merry way.
&gt;
&gt;Comments? (particularly from those on the "organisers" list -- who is on
&gt;there now?)...

&gt;
&gt;PS: Personally, I think that Geoffery and co have done (and are doing) a
&gt;great job, but I think it's time this group became an independant entity, so
&gt;that certain things (mailing lists, InstallFests, lobbying) can happen more
&gt;efficiently.
