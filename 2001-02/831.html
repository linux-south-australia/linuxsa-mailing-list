np. :)

The thing is I lurk a lot.  I won't say something unless I feel there is a
need and then (normally) only if I know what the F**K I'm saying. hehe.  So
it is no wonder you haven't heard from me much.  Anyway,  did you check out
my new homepage?  My personnel one that is not the company one.  I don't
push that except in my sig. and that one is just my development site.  Not
even my server.  hehe.  It's the worst server I could find to use for
development.  Hosted by a company called Strato.  They are the masters at
cheap hosting in Germany. hehe.

Subject: RE: Deny List project


&gt; &gt; &gt; ? Isn't there somehting missing from this email -- or have I missed
&gt; &gt; &gt; something key from somewhere else? What is it that you are denying,
why
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; &gt; you denying it, why should someone send an IP address to the deny
list,
&gt; &gt; what
&gt; &gt; &gt; do I do with the list? etc?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm not denying anything.  The why is simple.  If someone has been
hacked
&gt;
&gt; ?
&gt;
&gt; yes you are, you're denying selected IP addresses access to your system...
&gt; Nothing wrong with that, it's just information that is essential to
&gt; understand what the term "Deny list" means :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; from an IP  address they will add it to thier hosts.deny file.  By
sharing
&gt; &gt; this file with other server admins we can help each other stop a hack
&gt; &gt; attempt before they get to your server.  The list will be updated as
often
&gt; &gt; as possible all you have to do is add the list to your hosts.deny file
and
&gt; &gt; away you go.
&gt;
&gt; ok, fair enough...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Additionally, (and you are welcome to deny me an answer to this if you
&gt; &gt; want
&gt; &gt; &gt; :) ) who/what is acns? (my understanding is that they/you/it
&gt; &gt; are/is based
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ACNS is my company.  And what does where I'm based have to do with
wanting
&gt; &gt; to help other server admins protect their servers from hackers from
around
&gt; &gt; the world?
&gt;
&gt; nothing. Just interested. That's why I said you could deny me an answer --
&gt; it's none of my business :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Germany)... Looking back at your posts to LinuxSA, they seem somewhat
&gt; &gt; unique
&gt; &gt; &gt; in that they don't relate to anything else on the list (the best one
was
&gt; &gt; one
&gt; &gt; &gt; saying how impressed you were about all the feedback re your site, but
&gt; &gt; there
&gt; &gt; &gt; was no discussion at all about your earlier posts, at least not
&gt; &gt; on-list),
&gt; &gt; &gt; and tend to be promoting your site, which, as far as I can tell, is a
&gt; &gt; German
&gt; &gt; &gt; ISP with a /.-style weblog, containing news about yourself... I must
&gt; &gt; admit,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm interested now :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, you may wish (or not) to read a little closer before passing
&gt; &gt; judgements. :)
&gt;
&gt; hmmm... not really judging, I was just intrigued by your mysterious cameo
&gt; appearances on this list :) Sorry if I sounded critical...
