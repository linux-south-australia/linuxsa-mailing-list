Hi all (newbie query).

I booted up my Linux box recently, and amongst the list of messages that
usually come up was one that read something like:

WARNING:  check time reached, running e2fsck is recommended

or something similar.

Okay, I've not used e2fsck before and (other than when first installing
Linux on this machine) I only use the "mount" command when inserting a
new CD-ROM.  That is, infrequently.

So I su'd, and after viewing fstab to see what partitions were mounted
as what names, I entered:

e2fsck /dev/hda1

I got the error message:

e2fsck 1.17, 26-Oct-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
/dev/hda1 is mounted.  

WARNING!!!  Running e2fsck on a mounted filesystem may cause
SEVERE filesystem damage.

After that, I declined to go further and figured I'd better get some
advice before mounting and unmounting filesystems on the drive.

My question sort of runs like this:

If I unmount the root directory (/), which means all files and
sub-directories (recursively) underneath root *also* get unmounted,
doesn't that mean those files are unaccessible until I mount the root
directory again?

That being the case, isn't /bin underneath root?  I mean, how can I use
the "mount" command (i.e. calling the mount program, which is in /bin)
if, by definition, it isn't available?  Or do I have to copy the mount
program to a floppy (or another hard drive partition) and run it from
there?

Essentially, how can you run a program (even a Linux command) from an
unmounted partition?  And if *all* partitions were simultaneously
unmounted, wouldn't you have an unusable system (unless you had at least
the "mount" command available to you elsewhere)?

As you can probably tell, very newbie stuff, but mounting and unmounting
filesystems and hard drive partitions has always worried me a bit...


TIA.

R,

Paul.
