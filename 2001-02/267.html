&gt; Have you ever actually used an IDE like Delphi/C++Builder/JBuilder or MS's

One thing  that I have enjoyed with Delphi is that it has been around
since 1994. And before that, Borland Pascal with its object pascal.
I find the core language to be better than C/C++, and with all the hype
over Java, I find that Java is just catching up (except for cross
platform), even Java is a hack at times (string object). Delphi has always
provided a more pure object development system
than VB and from the begining it has been a proper compiler where VB used
to be just P-code and interpreter in the one executable.
If you want to code down to the metal in Delphi, you can. If you want to
crash your system with bad pointers, you can. If you want to manipulate
strings and data without memory leaks and malloc'ing, using a standard
part of the language, you can. If you want to use the IDE and form
development tools to enhance your work, you can. You have a lot of choice.
The only things that are against it (technically) are the collection of
its own API's it has built up over the years since the very first Turbo
Pascal, that C/C++ is more widely used, and its initial lack of cross
platform implementation (GNU Pascal and FreePascal partly fix this).

KDevelop looks very good... when compared to vi/emacs and gdb.
Of course, things are changing.

Dale.
