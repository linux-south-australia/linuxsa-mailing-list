Michael,

That sounds very familiar.
This happens to me particularly when I reinstall from source.

The problem is the pesky --prefix parameter of ./configure in the
source directory.
People putting together distributions seem to change their
mind about exactly where to put log files and config files
every 6-12 months or so.

So now you just have to find out where the config and log files
_really_ are for your new installation.

The info could be embedded in some user manual - which often
gets modified to reflect the ./configure --prefix options.
Or you could go on a mad hunt.
Here are some places where I would look:

/usr/local/apache/conf/
/etc/httpd/
/etc/httpd/conf/
/home2/apache/conf/

These are obtained from "locate httpd.conf" on some of my machines.
Admittedly the /home2/apache/conf was one that I personally
entered as --prefix. But the others are quite common.

Every time I install new software now (like a new package from
source per day), I look to see what prefix it will use, and try
to set it to something sensible. If you're using an RPM,
you don't get much choice, I guess. 

Good luck with your hunting!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
