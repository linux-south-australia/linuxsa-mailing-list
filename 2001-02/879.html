Hmmmm...

&gt; If you read the statement I made.  Such problems would occur mostly when the
&gt; ISP has a high rate of hackers.

Or one hacker who's hacked one of the ISP's machines.

&gt; This issue is being worked on now.  by recording the email address and IP
&gt; address of the person submitting the "to be blacklisted" IP and setting a
&gt; limit on the number of request needed from unique users we should be able to
&gt; keep most to a limit.  Any ideas in this area either?

So, what if 500 people genuinely want to kill some subnet? Your script
then goes and denies it. Where is an arbitrary limit? I could do
something like:

1) Create 500 fake e-mail addresses
2) Start by sending 10 reports
3) Check to see if IP is blacklisted
4) If not increase until all 500 used
5) If not decrease until reports are 0

If I suspect that you're recording e-mail addresses, I go back to step
one.

&gt; Part of this answer is above.  Another thing is that if an ISP wishes to
&gt; have some IP's removed they must make contact with all people that reported
&gt; the IP.  This I believe will prove to be beneficial in that, it may move
&gt; ISP's to be a bit more diligent in regards to what users do across thier
&gt; network.  Any ideas?

Must they? Why? And how? How do you advertise an IP address that is
going to be banned and NOT tell the ISP? Surely the ISP could manually
add some IP to their firewall rules, or to hosts.deny and so forth.
Surely you couldn't say:

"We suggest you ban this IP subnet but we won't tell you the subnet.
Please contact these people..." - but what do you say to the people? I
got your email address from Deny List Extravaganza but I don't know what
subnet you reported...

&gt; mind when looking at the big picture.  The largest problem are NAT's and
&gt; dial-in connections.  big pain. hehe.

Incidentally, I didn't think that my MAC address went over TCP/IP over
the Internet. I thought that the packets on that layer contained IP
address and routing information, and TCP headers and the data payload. I
might be wrong (and I'm feeling lazy and can't be bothered reading the
book about TCP/IP on my bookshelf)...
