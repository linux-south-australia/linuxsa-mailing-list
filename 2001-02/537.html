&gt; The mention of LANtastic suggests that the text is old ...
Book published last year :)
Information Processes and Technology - HSC Course - g.k Powers.
&gt;
&gt; What school was that, BTW? Perhaps we should send some paper mail to the
&gt; school extoling the virtues of Linux and pointing out that the French
&gt; education system is using it in a big way, as is the Mexican
&gt; school system,
&gt; etc ...

Its St. Patricks Marist, Dundas
151 kirby st, dundas, nsw 2117

This wouldnt work, as the Head of IT doesnt have a clue about Linux. He
complains about a Novell server he has running as a gateway to the WAN
(which has to be novell, for some odd reason)

Hmmm maybe it has to be novell because the Catholic education office doesnt
trust NT as a gateway :) I'm sure a linux gateway wouldnt have any problems!
But as vladimir says " if it aint broke, dont fix it"


&gt;
&gt; &gt;This was only one thing i was quite offended by, there was another, that
&gt; &gt;same day. My teacher also offended me about linux too! simply
&gt; because of his
&gt; &gt;naivity towards anything but Mac OS or Microshaft products. I was talking
&gt; &gt;about cable and how he has his puters all connected up to cable
&gt; at home. He
&gt; &gt;was saying how he has a NT workstation running wingate, i then told him
&gt; &gt;about my setup, my Linux gateway/server. He was like "A *LINUX*
&gt; server" like
&gt; &gt;who would ever use something like that. I then went on to explain to him
&gt; &gt;that when he has to reboot his windows NT machine several times
&gt; a day, i can
&gt; &gt;leave my very low powered linux server on for months on end without even
&gt; &gt;getting close to wanting a reboot. He then uttered some bullshit
&gt; to try and
&gt; &gt;convince me NT was better and then told me to sit down as he was about to
&gt; &gt;start the lesson.
&gt;
&gt; It may be that NT does not crash for hime that often, but he most likely
&gt; cannot run it with any speed on the sort of low resource machines that
&gt; Linux will run on.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;what a joke!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I must admit, for somethings, windows NT may be the better
&gt; option, but when
&gt; &gt;it comes to running a server, nothing can beat the reliability and sheer
&gt; &gt;power of LINUX! *roar* :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Anyway, something to have a winge about :)
&gt; &gt;
