Not commenting on what you've said below, other than to correct some 
misconceptions:

 &gt; Some time ago, upon visiting the Parliament web site, I was greeted

You have a right to personally view the proceedings of parliament under
certain terms and conditions defined by the parliament.  You certainly
don't have a "democratic right" to a webcast of the parliament in whatever
format you desire, or, for that matter, in any format at all.

 &gt; Upon reading the terms and conditions from the web site - I found
 &gt; that it is illegal to reproduce or use the webcast in an manner
 &gt; contrary to the intention of public access (ie - slicing and dicing
 &gt; to fit a particulary view point for example) which is fair enough. 

The Commonwealth of Australia is essentially exercising copyright over
it.  

 &gt; I understand that media streaming may be preferable to mp3 files
 &gt; for legal reasons. 

There are no legal issues which would cause MP3 to be less preferred than
any other format.

 &gt; Any thoughts or plans of action?

Convincing those who have the ability to change things will be much 
easier if you don't throw in ridiculous distractions about things like
"democratic rights" which you don't have, or hand-waving about legal
problems which don't exist.

Get educated on the issue and write some letters.  I'm sure lots of 
people would be interested in helping if you showed any kind of likelihood
of success.
