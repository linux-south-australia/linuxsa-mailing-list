Everything that supports IP supports static IP addresses;  The question
you should be asking is, "Does my service provider provide a static IP
address with the ADSL service it has offered to the marketplace?"

If your service provider is Telstra, the answer is, "No" -- You cannot
obtain an ADSL service from Telstra with a static IP address.  This is 
a deliberate product-packaging decision Telstra has made, not a limitation
of the underlying technology.

On the other hand, if your service provider is basically anyone who
isn't Telstra, the answer is, "Yes."  Since there is no technical limitation
standing in the way of the provision of static IP addresses, and since the
market obviously wants them, Telstra's competitors are only too happy to 
offer them to you.

This is typical of Telstra's mindset.  They come from a history of 
telling customers what they want/need and never offering any useful 
alternatives to anyone who wants something different.  Telstra's 
competitors, however, have a mindset which is rather more flexible.

 &gt; so does ADSL support static IP or not? i have heard its the hardware that
 &gt; telstra give to customers, and have heard its adsl that doesnt support
 &gt; it. so which is it?

Both of those explanations are wrong.  The hardware Telstra supplies 
does support it, but they choose not to utilize that support. 

Be clear on this:  The problems with getting a static IP address with 
a Telstra ADSL connection are *not* problems you will face if you get 
your ADSL connection through anyone else.  Telstra is not the only ADSL
service provider in the country, and with the brainfucked customer-hostile
attitude they're taking towards the provision of the service, they're
entirely likely to be the *minority* service provider (Hint:  The
headlines you read last week about ADSL outages only affected Telstra
customers, not all ADSL customers in Australia.  And the stories which 
described the fact that there were no high-level afters hours technical
staff available on-call to fix the problems they had last week were true,
which is why Telstra ADSL customers experienced an outage which lasted
all night instead of an outage which lasted a few minutes.

[ that's actually a general rule for most Australian telecommunications
  service, by the way:  The problems you experience when you deal with
  Telstra are usually something you don't need to experience if you deal
  with Telstra's competitors. ]

You are a customer;  You know what you want;  You know what Telstra has
on offer.  Is Telstra offering what you want?  No.  So don't use them.

 &gt; On an aside, where do you find ISDN cards to put into a machine to act as a
 &gt; router?
