Jason -- please please please do something about your typing skills. one or
two typos per sentence is readable, one or two per word is not. Note the key
at the top right of the typewriter part of your keyboard -- it's the
backspace key ... it's how we correct typos... :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So has anyone done the full Java-based webserver thing yet? I
&gt; &gt; remember hearing that Linux was *the platform for enterprise
&gt; &gt; Java deployment (sic), but is it actually being used as such?
&gt;
&gt; Full java based web servers are definately avaiable.


There's two things mentioned here -- Java-based web servers, and Java-based
web development.

The first is an Apache replacement written in Java. It serves plain old
HTML, although may have modules to do other things as well... just like the
Apache core.

The second is modules for a web server (whether it's Apache, a Java-based
web server, or something else). It serves HTML generated by some sort of
Java program, whether it's plain old CGI wiht Java, Servlets, or JSPs...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Servlets might be aproblem in theory.
&gt;
&gt; There is a high hit (a few secs) when startigna JVM. AN d in theory
&gt; servelts need a jvm started avery time they run.
&gt;
&gt; To get around this, servlets I believe are per loaded to overcome the
&gt; start up hit of java.

yes. :)

JSP's are also interesting -- often, the first time they are used, the JSP
is translated into a servlet, and then compiled into bytecode. However, once
it's compiled and loaded, it's fast.

&gt; So you shoudl nto noticve any hit becasue of ajve perse.
&gt; At leat no worse than perl or any other interpredted language.

Java gets pretty fast these days, although Linux is not its' fastest
platform (I could be wrong there).

&gt; And _possibly_ better than other interpreted languages because a ot of
&gt; Java jvms with jits cache already translated code blocks, whereas I am
&gt; not sure that other interreters eg perl, python, sh do this.

I doubt you'll find much speed difference between a well-programmed JSP on a
good Java implementation as against an equivalently well-programmed PHP or
mod_perl script. I have no evidence for this though :)

&gt; &gt; And wouldn't the development time be a bit high? Again, I would
&gt; &gt; have thought that just writing PHP pages that listen for requests
&gt; &gt; (like XML-RPC does) would be much quicker, both in dev time and
&gt; &gt; run-time speed, than running a Java servlet.
&gt;
&gt; Not if you know java.
&gt; No longer than perl or any other programming language that you know.

One of the main reasons organisations choose Java is development time.
There's a high overhead, certainly initially, but once in the swing of
things, it tends to be a very efficient language to write in (and puh-lease,
all ye hardcore C programmers, I'm not talking about terseness, I'm talking
about general ease -- it's often more typing, but there are advantages to
it)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; And in the long run you can probably get alot of reuse of code if you
&gt; think about what you do before you do it.

The key to writing reusable software is to not be afraid to throw code out.
:)

&gt; Also in enterprise scenarios where you are doing more thatn just servinng
&gt; web pages(eg you have oteh standalone aps that access the database), you
&gt; would almost certainly be able to use your classes in other
&gt; applications.

depending on how well you design them :)

&gt; I think the real advantage of java though might not be revleant in your
&gt; case.
&gt; Write once run almost anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; This is attractve for large organsitions with many databases and many
&gt; platforms to supprt. You can usually use the smae code on all with java.
&gt; BUt this probably is nto an issue for you. However I spsuect tht is part
&gt; of the reason probalby alarge part of the reason that databse companies
&gt; like java so much froma marketing perspective and why you see so much
&gt; java enabled stuff around databases.

interestingly, this is becoming irrelevant for many organisations -- how
often do organisations really change their server platform :) The real
reason is that it's a good language, and it's good for the marketing boys...
:)
