Richard!

&gt; I am new to this mailing list (and mailing lists in general).  

ooerr...a newbie to pick on. And he didn't even post his first
message(s) in HTML...this is just not good enough. How can we possibly
flame newbies if they post their messages in text? (1)

&gt; I have
&gt; sent two messages already but both have appeared in the wrong place in
&gt; relation to the original message on the LinuxSA web page.

I think the default way the LinuxSA web page displays messages is by
date. Not thread. So if they won't appear immediately after what they
relate to. Please be aware that the LinuxSA mailing list occasionally
does odd things like display answers to questions BEFORE the questions
and so forth...

&gt; All I did
&gt; last time was reply to the original message and copied to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.</A>

You can:

* press reply only

And it goes to the poster of the message

* reply to all

And it goes to all the people listed in the to and cc fields
 
&gt; Can someone please let me know the routine for replying to a posted
&gt; message, before I make a fool of myself again?

Well, you sit in front of your computer. Somehow reply to it (you didn't
specify what mailer you're using and I can't be bothered about looking
at your mail headers) and type. You then press send...

(1)

This e-mail is tongue in cheek. Do NOT post messagesd in HTML. The
easiest way not to is not to use Outlook (Express or otherwise). People
who use Outlook generally are too stupid to work out how to stop Outlook
from using HTML (2). It's 40 degrees and I have only one single in wall
air conditioner and have no idea how I'll pay my electricity bill for
it...

(2)

I said generally, so if you happen to be one of the enlightened ones who
manage to turn it off don't even think about flaming me...I've
overstocked on petrol pre price rise and there's more than enough to
flame you out of existence :-)
