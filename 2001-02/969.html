This is incredibly vague and idealistic. I think it also falls short of
the problem. I agree of course with the idea of making the production of
code more professional, auditable, accountable and predictable, but in a
perfect world, as you know, it can't always work like that as there
factors other than coding. 

I have seen some software developed with the aid of Visual Source Safe,
which made the task of inspecting and controlling changes and absolute
dream, but then deployed in such a hap-hazard fashion, that they will
probably have to rebuild the NT machine from scratch becuase the
registry is fsck'd.

Also, controlling your creation.

Where I'm working now, they designed the sh*t of the network. Routers,
hubs, switches bridges, VLANs, subnets, ad infinitum. However, when
something doesn't work, they hack it. So now, it breaks *all the time*.
There is no version control on the entire system.

I do not think it is possible to control the configuration with
software. At some time you rely ont the people working on it.

Thats is for my "I had to work on saturday, and nothing worked and there
was nobody from the client company to fix it so now I'm grumpy because I
could have been at the pool watching Latinas" rant.
