Hi Michael,

AMD Duron would be the best processsor you could use for a low powered
server. They are higher performance than Intel Celeron, almost the same
performance as the Pentium III, if not the same, and they've been
benchmarked at 90% of the speed of the AMD Athlon, yet they are the cheapest
in price available CPU on the market.

As much ram as possible is good. With current ram prices, it may be a good
idea to stock up on 256mb sticks, and use these as an alternative to 128mb
in the servers.

If the computer is being used for email, pop3 style retreval only then a
10gb hdd would be suitable. However, if you were to be using an IMAP setup
where all user email is stored on the server, then I would suggest 10gb may
be not enought. Even in the small business of 5 to 10 staff, I have seen
total mailbox sizes going over 20gb (eg, pam and tommy movies being passed
around the office ;-).

The video card would be adequate. I saw Tim recommended using a PCI card, if
you were to find a brand new PCI card for sale, it would cost more than
double an AGP, and if you were going to look second hand PCI, your already
shooting yourself in the foot !

Intel Pro/100+ NIC are good, high performance network cards .... if you use
them with that other operating system ;-(
Using them with the available Unix drivers, you will find it to be a low
performance card. Try looking at 3com 10/100's. A litle more expensive,
however definatly worth the extra $$$.

Using a netcomm modem is probably gonna send your cost up a little. I would
recommend a generic brand modem say a discovery modem from leader. Same
chipset, half the price. Very good quality modems.

Hope this helps.

Jeremy

Subject: Suggest a Hardware Configuration for a Gateway, small
webserver, etc


Hi all,

in the coming months my cousin who owns a computer business wants to offer a
linux solution to some of his clients as an internet solution,
The machine needs to be able to be: a dialup internet gateway, small time
webserver, firewall, small time SMB server, small time email server. Without
going way out of proportion what would be a good kind of system to ensure
good compatibility with Red Hat 6.2 note: we will be building the systems
from the ground up. I would like to know, like what is a nice average hdd,
motherboard, ram, etc. that linux would be comfortable with. The system
probably will not be streesed too much it is only for small businesses that
just want a permanent connection to the net mainly for email.

I am thinking maybe like:
AMD Duron 700
128MB RAM
10GB IDE HDD
4MB AGP graphics
Intel Pro/100+ NIC
Netcomm Roadster II modem

we preferrably want to use new components in the machines while keeping the
cost as low as possible.

how does this sound, all opinions and comments welcome please :-)


regards,

Michael
