&gt; I'm experiencing a fairly "weird" error with my time server. "ntpdate -d

This is telling you that your clock was almost exactly an hour off
(-3600 seconds).

&gt; It's a local machine that synchronises to its own internal clock. I know
&gt; this isn't the perfect setup but I'm attempting to get a proof of
&gt; concept working. Now the time server "xntpd" baulks presumably because
&gt; of the offset (of 64 hours). Now it's on a local network, it pings
&gt; sensibly (between 0.unmeasurable to 0.3ms response time at the worst),
&gt; the hardware clocks are within 1 minute of each other.
&gt;
&gt; * What does the offset field actually mean?

It's the value by which the time was adjusted to set the correct time.

&gt; * What would cause the offset to be such a ridiculously high number?

Presumably the clock was set wrong.  If your CMOS clock uses local
time, as opposed to UTC, then it could be due to DST differences.

&gt; I have other machines on the same network and same subnet that display
&gt; results such as this:
&gt;
&gt; 6 Feb 14:37:23 ntpdate[1650]: adjust time server [ip.address] offset 0.000029 sec

That's more typical.

&gt; I sent this message once already but it hasn't appeared in, like 15
&gt; hours...so if you get it twice, sorry :-P

I've noticed mail configuration problems from your site, but they
don't seem to affect the list.  You should have received a message
from me on the subject.

&gt;&gt; or you can start with just setting the date manually (or even with rdate -s)

&gt;
&gt; I had to adjust the hardware clock on the time server using hwclock. Now
&gt; because I haven't rebooted the system, it's possible that the change
&gt; hasn't come about in Linux's internal system clock. Which means that it
&gt; will jump 12 hours ahead on next reboot (1)...however there are some
&gt; salient thoughts here:

I don't understand where you get the 12 hours from.  But I think
there's still a problem with the Linux kernel that setting the date
doesn't change the hardware clock, which is a particular nuisance if
you're running xntpd.

&gt; * ntpd is using the hardware clock
&gt;
&gt; If this is so, then why is my backup server (another machine using ntpd
&gt; synchronisation) keeping the correct time? It's hardware clock and
&gt; system time are both correct. About 12 hours ago they were 12 hours
&gt; ahead...but system time syncs wonderfully

What you've shown so far looks like a single jump of one hour.  Are
you getting this at regular intervals without intervening reboots?

&gt; * ntpd is using the system clock
&gt;
&gt; If this is so, I can't for the life of me work out why it thinks there
&gt; is -3500 milli-seconds difference (way to many for ntpd to fix).

Seconds, not milliseconds.

&gt; Interestingly, if I use:
&gt;
&gt; * ntpd -b time.server
&gt;
&gt; The time gets set correctly but an hour behind. This silly behaviour is
&gt; the behaviour I'm trying to fix; my main server which actually needs to
&gt; keep the time properly loses time all the time. Even so, the server it
&gt; syncs to:
&gt;
&gt; * pings at unmeasurable speeds (i.e. very very quickly)
&gt; * has the correct time (except the hardware time might be out - see
&gt; above)
&gt; * manages every other machine's time service sensibly
&gt;
&gt; And my main server drops an hour! For no particular reason at all...

Hmm.

&gt; I'm beginning to think I'm losing UDP packets like mad, but everything
&gt; else speaks nicely to the machine (mainly TCP/IP traffic and SMB over
&gt; TCP/IP) and I'm not hearing any complaints about network speed being
&gt; noticeably different. This, I think, may be an explanation but I can see
&gt; the UDP packets bouncing backwards and forwards about every minute (when
&gt; ntpd polls the time server) and they don't appear to be terribly out of
&gt; order.

This is definitely not a network problem.  How often does this happen?
Do you have the right time zone set?
