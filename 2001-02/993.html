<H1>Parliament House and the ABC using Windows Media Format</H1>

Some time ago, upon visiting the Parliament web site, I was greeted with a Windows Media Format icon when attempting to access a live 'webcast' of parliamentary proceedings as is my democratic right.  Upon reading the terms and conditions from the web site - I found that it is illegal to reproduce or use the webcast in an manner contrary to the intention of public access (ie - slicing and dicing to fit a particulary view point for example) which is fair enough.  I understand that media streaming may be preferable to mp3 files for legal reasons.  However, I found nothing in the terms and conditions for the Parliament House streaming section that requires the use of Windows Media Player as opposed to say Real Player or any other suitable alternative that is universally accessible.  The same can be said for the ABC web site.  I am bitterly disappointed.  Has our own pivotal political and media institutions sold out?  What can be done?  Upon inquiring - I was basically told to get!
 stuffed.  After inquiring further - I was advised that streaming alternatives will be considered in 'future enhancements' - in other words 'get stuffed'.

What about low income earners who can not afford several hundred dollars for a Windows licence on top of a either donated or cheap second hand computer?  I am concerned that Parliament House and the ABC are not meeting their own universal access obligations.

Any thoughts or plans of action?
