Stephen!

&gt; SOOOOooooooo its a windows problem, :-)))) I reckon you should be flamed to
&gt; death, nothing personal just a good roasting   ;-)))))

It is not solely a Windows problem.

&gt; Anyways.. When you installed the S3 did you put it on PCI-1 slot? W-blows is
&gt; funny if your video card is placed on a PCI slot after other cards, not all
&gt; the time but sporadic.

Funnily enough I did. I wouldn't have expected an Operating System (?)
to get funny about where one's video card actually is.

&gt; Next, depending on version of windows the realtek
&gt; needs updated drivers to work.  I know, I have the same cards on some comps
&gt; and could not get them to work without drivers from net.  I still have them
&gt; here if you want me to send them to you.

Given the tone of this e-mail, and that it's running under an insecure
Operating System (?) I think I'll get the drivers myself. Who knows what
your drivers would do?
 
&gt; Oh and lastly, S3's  have a habit of using IRQ 10 as default, check W-blows
&gt; for V-card IRQ even though it did not tell you there was a conflict.

Yes, it does use IRQ 10. But what's wrong with that?

&gt; Ill help you along since you are linux guru and might have trouble with a
&gt; flawed, corrupt system ;-)

I do actually know how to operate Windows, but thank you nonetheless.

&gt; Press start, - settings- control panel - system icon - device manager -
&gt; display adapter - (click card) properties..
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry could not resist ;-)

You are not sorry. Desist!
