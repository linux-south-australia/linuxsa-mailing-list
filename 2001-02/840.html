Charles,


&gt; Do you have a permenant IP?  If so and you don't hack then why are you
&gt; worried?  You won't be denied if you don't do anything.  Server admins want
&gt; people to come to thier servers.  They just don't want them comprimised or
&gt; hurt.  So how you would be denied at thier site if you have done nothing, is
&gt; something I don't understand.  Also, if your on a dynamic dial-in service
&gt; and you find yourself being denied access on certain servers it should tell
&gt; you something.  Get a new ISP.  They are obviously letting hackers and/or
&gt; script kiddies run loose on the net.  Once a ISP gets the rep of allowing
&gt; hackers and/or script kiddies then they get shut out of a lot of sites
&gt; anyway.  Trust me, this much I have found out the hard way.  I'm living in
&gt; Germany where hackers and script kiddies are a friggin plague.  It is hard
&gt; to find a network over here sometimes that doesn't have problems about being
&gt; denied at some sites.


I cannot agree with this statement. The idea of changing ISP is obsurd
-- lets say that a reputable ISP (such as Internode, Rebel etc) gets
someone dialing up to their  service and `hacking' and gets their
current IP on the ban list, that would mean that anyone else using that
IP would be banned. Surely one should not be expected to change ISPs
because of one stupid person wants to be a pain. How would one combat
this? The unfortunate reality is that there are many people using a
service with dynamic IP allocation. Even Telstra's ADSL (ugghhh...) uses
DHCP. It'll be a while until every house, office or building has its own
static IP (Although some businesses, particularly the larger ones have
static IPs). How do you plan to work with problems such as this?

Secondly, if I was to install this list on one of my servers, how am I
assured that its genuinely a hacker/script kiddie IP? While you may not
deliberately put an incorrect address in there, someone else (maybe a
hacker or script kiddie :-) might.

Finally, how would you assure that this list stays up-to-date? It may be
that someone who had an IP on the blacklist may have left that ISP and
no longer is attached to the IP. That would mean that there is some poor
Joe User guy with a blacklisted IP.

It's a good idea, but it is flawed by no fault of your own.
Unfortunately, System Admins have to deal with these hacker people. It's
a reality. It is also unforunate that a genuine attempt by someone such
as yourself to block these people from our servers can (an attempts
undoubtably will) be mamed by these hackers/script kiddies.
