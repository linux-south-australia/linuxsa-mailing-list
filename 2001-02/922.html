I went to Simon's talk at the IEEE.  It was extremely interesting, and
simultaneously encouraging and depressing!

&gt; I'm keen. I think that Simon needs to be careful about pluggin too much, but
&gt; I'm sure he will... perhaps we should invite a telstra and/or other
&gt; telco/ISP in to give a counter to the Agile push... I'm keen for Simon to
&gt; give a talk with no plugs or criticisms, then 2 mins for any ISP to plug or
&gt; whatever.

`No criticism' is a bit of an ask when part of the talk described the
regulatory hurdles a new carrier has to jump along the way to the very
high and important hurdle of interconnection to the Telstra network.
I think the audience would be better served by just allowing Simon to
speak his mind.

A Telstra viewpoint would of course be welcome.  There *may* be a good
justification for their behaviour...

In particular, I would like to hear an update on how Agile are going
with stopping the cockatoos from nibbling the wires on their tower/s.
The day after the IEEE talk, DSTO was off the net for the same reason.

Cheers,
Mike Pope
