Thanks, I'll check this out. The connection is a cable connection, through Telstra I think. I'm
quite happy for everything to be console based, I was basically wondering about the servers
networking capabilities.

&gt; IPCHAINS or ipfwadm
&gt; 
&gt; these two programs do the same thing. ipfwadm is just a later version i
&gt; guess?
&gt; This program is used for firewalling and as the name suggests forwarding
&gt; ip's in a sense.
&gt; Basically what this program does is when a request is sent from one of the
&gt; two machines, it registers who it is from, requests the information, and
&gt; then when received, sends information back to person who asks for it. *by
&gt; the way this is a kinda newbie way of explaining it*
&gt; 
&gt; An example of what you would need to run on the linux machine for you to get
&gt; the system forwarding ip's (masquerading as its called) is the following:
&gt; 
&gt; /sbin/ipchains -A forward 192.0.0.0/24 -j MASQ
&gt; 
&gt; OR
&gt; 
&gt; /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -P tcp -S 192.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0
&gt; /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -P tcp -S 192.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0
&gt; 
&gt; This will set up a gateway on the linux box. But this will certainly NOT
&gt; filter any packets, you'll have to read up on that one yourself :)
&gt; 
&gt; Then! in windows, go to the TCP/IP settings for the NIC for the LAN, and put
&gt; in the IP of the linux machine you have set up as a gateway, in the gateway
&gt; section. REBOOT, and if you've set everything good, u should have yourself a
&gt; gateway :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; what can I expect the 486 to support.
&gt; It will certianly support everything running in the console... well maybe
&gt; not serving large amounts of data too efficiently, but it will serve as a
&gt; good gateway for sure!
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno about X windows... it may run, but just too slow! :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The subnet will be run off
&gt; &gt; a dynacally assigned IP (read
&gt; &gt; between the lines). The 98 machine is involved in serving
&gt; &gt; streaming data , tha Mac primarily is used
&gt; &gt; for surfing.
&gt; 
&gt; Streaming data?? What type of connection would you be using then?
&gt; 
&gt; are you fimilar with dhcp and linux? You'll have to make sure you install a
&gt; program called dhclient. If using cable/adsl that is, you'll have to run
&gt; this on startup.
&gt; 
&gt; PPP is a totally different story. Dont ask me about that one. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck.
&gt; 
&gt; Adam W.
