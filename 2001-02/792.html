<H1>Adaptec SCSI Card</H1>

Dear all,
	I've just added an Adaptec 2930U SCSI card and Sony CRX160S CD-RW to my
system, but I'm unsure which module I need to add to the kernel to get
it to work.

	Can someone point me in the right direction? There isn't an option for
that card model, or even 29xx in the 2.4.1 source. Maybe a patch to the
source is available?

	Curiously, when I compiled the SCSI stuff into the kernel, rather than
modules, I could see the CD drive in /proc/scsi/scsi, but when I tried
to access it, I had "/dev/scd0 has wrong major or minor number", in
spite of it looking OK according to devices.txt. Even then, I couldn't
see the card, which is probably why I couldn't mount the drive.

	I'm prepared to have the obvious slapped in my face, apart from "is the
card installed?" etc. On booting up, CTRL-A can access the card, and it
successfully identifies the drive.

	I'd rather not have to reconfigure "Other_OS" just to use the CD
burner! Come to think of it, I'd rather not boot "Other_OS" at
all...haven't had to for 18 months, why start now?

Thanks in advance.
