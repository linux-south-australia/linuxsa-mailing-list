Glen!

&gt; This isn't cost-free to the library.  Despite that, they make an
&gt; effort to get contributed items catalogued and shelved quickly.

Hence, if we were to do such a thing we should make sure it is known
that we're both scratching each other's backs so to speak.

&gt; A quick browsing of my bookshelf suggests that we need about $1,500
&gt; to make a worthwhile donation of books that would adequately
&gt; cover UNIX computing.  Mind you, this would be something
&gt; excellent to do, as it would genuinely make Linux cheap to
&gt; install and configure.  So maybe we need to start making
&gt; chocolate crackles.

I can feel a lamington drive coming on, but $1500 to $2500 especially if
we got someone like the BookShelf to give us a discount (they give me a
10% discount for being a regular purchaser, so I can't see any reason
why _someone_ couldn't approach them on our collective behalves).

&gt; So if we got a core of people together to supply an snack during
&gt; the meeting break we could fund a decent range of computing
&gt; books for the Adelaide library in about two years.
&gt; 
&gt; Thoughts?

Let's go ahead. Believe it or not, disposals (1) can be very lucrative.
I'm a member of a group who runs disposals on a regular basis with about
10 to 15 contributors at $2 each. They give away half but they float
very well on it - they're able to dispense about 1 to 2 thousand a year
on members' outings each year just from this.

Disposals don't attract the GST. Raffles do... ;-P
