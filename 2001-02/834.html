&gt; &gt; I'm not denying anything.  The why is simple.  If someone has been
hacked
&gt; &gt; from an IP  address they will add it to thier hosts.deny file.  By
sharing
&gt; &gt; this file with other server admins we can help each other stop a hack
&gt; &gt; attempt before they get to your server.  The list will be updated as
often
&gt; &gt; as possible all you have to do is add the list to your hosts.deny file
and
&gt; &gt; away you go.
&gt;
&gt; Since you are publicising your "deny list" here I wonder if this puts you
&gt; under Australian and South Australian jurisdiction.  The reason I wonder
&gt; is because you are effectively saying that every IP address on your list
&gt; is that of someone who has indulged in some sort of computer crime.  This

Not quite so.  The site states that "By contributing your hosts.deny list
you can help other server admins stop a possible hack attack on thier system
before it starts.  This goes for DOS attacks and such as well.  Just send
you contributions/additions to the Deny List as an email attachment to the
Deny List!" and one of the topics of discussion is "Should we wait until "X"
number of people have reported an IP address before adding it to the list?".
But I can see where you may get that impression.


&gt; could put you at serious risk of libel, or worse.  It may also be a breach
&gt; of privacy regulations.  Given recent legal precedents in Germany
regarding
&gt; material on an Australian web site that breaches German law, I think there
&gt; could be a lot of sympathy within Germany that you should face extradition
&gt; to Australia should your list be a breach of Australian law.

Waiting on my lawyer to get back to me on that one.  We may have to do this
as a verified service only.  I hope not because then I may not be able to do
it without some serious help and help is REALLY hard to find now days. hehe.

&gt;
&gt; I think compiling a quality list of rogue IP addresses is a worthwhile
project,
&gt; but "send me your deny IP addresses" lacks any form of scrutiny or due
diligence
&gt; and surely borders on criminally negligent.  What happens when somebody
sends
&gt; you the IP address of www.microsoft.com, or of www.anz.com.au?  The
implication
&gt; is that you blindly record it, thus causing innocent third parties
immeasurable
&gt; damage.  You be careful now.
&gt;
This is not necessarily true.  This is for the use of a server admin that
may or may not feel the, for instance microsoft.com, may pose a threat to
his server.  Thus the admin adds the microsoft.com domain to his deny list.
Me personnaly HAVE added microsoft.com to my deny list.  I don't trust 'em.
hehe.  In other words if you feel you wish to use the list then do so.  It
is your choice and has nothing to do with the IP's being banned.  I don't
see this list being used by AOL or some large corporation that someone would
be upset that they can't get into.
For one, at the moment the list has exactly 10 entries.  These are IP's that
I have personnally verified as DOS and/or Intrusion attack IP's.  I am
holding all IP's at the moment until the scripts are done.  Once we feed
them through the scripts then we will see which IP's get washed out.  By the
way, I do need help with the scripts. :) lol.
