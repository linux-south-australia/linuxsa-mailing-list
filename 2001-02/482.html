Alain!

&gt; I have been wanting to use ipchains for a few days now.  Most of my systems run
&gt; RH6.2 2.2-14, im uping to 2.2-17 soon.  I did take a look at syntax in the man
&gt; pages, however I still didn't have a clue as to how to write a rule.  I did see some
&gt; good faq's online about using it, but still had no good examples.

Take it to the latest available kernel (except maybe the 2.4.X series if
you don't want to get yourself muddled too much at the moment) available
at your distributor. RedHat have released RPM's for 2.2.18 at least and
it looks like 2.2.19 is just about to come out. It's at -pre10.

&gt; I will try these, and go from there.  If you could, quickly that is, let me know how
&gt; to disallow all ftp access to a subnet, but allowing another subnet full access?

You need to understand IP addresses. I'm going to assume that you
do...so:

[assume the script flushes the rules, sets a policy of deny on all
default chains (input, output, forward)]

# This allows incoming requests on port 21
ipchains -A input -i ppp+ -p tcp -s 10.1.1.0/24 $UNP -d $ME 21 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A output -i ppp+ -p tcp -s 10.1.1.0/24 21 -d any/0 $UNP -j
ACCEPT

# This allows the outgoing request on port 20 to other_host
# Required for non-passive FTP
# DO NOT enter these two if you only allow passive FTP into your site
ipchains -A output -i ppp+ -p tcp -s $ME 20 -d any/0 $UNP -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -i ppp+ ! -y -s any/0 $UNP -d $ME 20 -j ACCEPT

# This allows passive FTP
ipchains -A input -i ppp+ -s any/0 $UNP -d $ME $UNP -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A output -i ppp+ ! -y -s $ME $UNP -d any/0 $UNP -j ACCEPT

[other bits and pieces]

Now, if you want to log any of this add an "-l". DON'T log the data
channell or the passive FTP or you'll probably overrun your log file! If
you want to deny something, then turn the ACCEPT into DENY. So, if you
wanted to deny 10.0.0.0/24 you could write all the above but substitute
the ACCEPT for DENY.

Personally, I'd just chuck the incoming requests to port 21. If the FTP
server won't respond to commands they'd have to find some way of sending
it commands and then hijacking the session.

You should also look into /etc/ftpaccess which may be an easier but
higher level way of doing what you need. TCP Wrappers might help you
too.

Please be aware that if you just set your firewall to default DENY
everything and only enter the above information you will probably end up
with an unusable system because DNS, HTTP, POP in or out won't work. So
be careful when planning your firewall and try not to install it while
your system is in production.

Or you could be very embarassed!

An alternative - but less secure - way to run a firewall using ipchains
(or similar packet filtering stuff) is to run it on a default policy of
ACCEPT and DENY services you don't want to offer. This is much easier to
set up than a default DENY firewall because you generally don't
accidentally deny services you wanted.

However, if you forget to block a service that you are running but don't
want to exposed it's, well, exposed to the world.

With a default DENY firewall, if you forget say that you've got a pop
server running the world won't be able to talk to it unless you
explicitly enable it. Look at it this way: it's more secure to enable
the things you want to enable and deny everything else (whether by
design or you simply forgot that it's running) than forget to deny
something that could compromise you.

There are many good HOWTOs on firewalls and principles. A book "Linux
Firewalls" by Robert Ziegler (New Riders) is also very good.

Please be advised that everyone has a different point of view as to what
is "secure" and what is "not" and that at the end of the day security is
a balance between usability and security.
