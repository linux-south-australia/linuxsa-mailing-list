&gt; And yet diff doesn't use much memory until it needs to resynchronise
&gt; after a difference.  Then it can take lots of memory, depending on how
&gt; far it has to scan to resynchronise.  How did you write a diff in perl
&gt; (or any language) that worked better than the standard diff?

It depends on what you call "better": if it will be "fast" then you will
need alot of memory. If your "better" = "size" then it's possible to write
another diff which will take longer to work but will be tiny on memory. I
simply wonder that diff which shipped along with RH6.2 (in my case) cannot
work with big files. diff even not trying to load files as soon as it check
the file sizes. And the question was is it possible to run diff on big files
without making another program (see my quote about bicycle :) - simply I was
forced to reinvent bicycle because I was short on time to play around with
diff...
