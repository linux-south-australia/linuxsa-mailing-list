QNX was the operating system used in the Canadian programme to
build a computer for schools (similar to the earlier UK programme
that lead to the BBC Micro).

It was based on a rought approximation of the UNIX API, but
with the operating system being a set of cooperating
processes rather than the single address space model used
by traditional UNIX (including Linux).

It was cheap and had quite a following in Australia, especially
in Canberra which had a QNX bulliten board.  The cooperating
process model had a lot to commend it, for example, you could
rip out the scheduler and insert your own (a feature that made
device control people very happy).  UNIX programs were easily
ported.  The result was much more usable than MS-DOS.  The only
real competitor was Coherent, but after spending you $99 you
found that Coherent would only compile a &lt;64KB object, which
has enough at the time for GhostScript or other complex applications.

The company then refocussed.  The QNX APIs became POSIX standard
(which lead to a change in all file formats).  A company-supported
real time scheduler was added.  The price skyrocketed to more than
that of the hardware.

Skipping a few years (over the release of BSD/386, it's troubles,
and the eventual dominance of Linux) you can see that the real-time
focus of some Linux distributors is going to cause QNX big problems.

Yes, the Linux archietecture is worse for real-time than QNX.  But
Linux is going to have less life-cycle costs simply because so many
people know how to program it.  Worse still, it's going to be hard
for a private company to compete with Linux's device driver support.

Anyway, QNX need get onto developers' PCs to compete with Linux in
QNX's core market.  And that means QNX has to be given away to
meet Linux's pricing.  The 'non-comercial use' clause is an way
to prevent that give away from eating into sales.

Can't see it working.  Basically QNX had their chance to be
the freeish UNIX and blew it.  Now they're are being bulldozed
by what economists call the 'network effects' of Linux's
market share.

                      -------------------------

Borland's tactic for Kylix looks the same, but is actually
very different.  Kylix is free when used to produce GPL-licensed
applications.

Best case for Borland is:

 - Developers for vertical markets use Kylix + Linux to
   reduce system cost.  Delphi + Windows offers a
   viable fallback should the experiment fail.

 - Linux developers use Kylix rather than develop own
   GPL-licensed alternative.

 - Delphi programers at least program for easy Kylix
   porting.  This allows two sales to the one set of
   developers: Delphi now, possibily Kylix later.

 - Delphi revenues rise, as Visual Basic developers
   gain insurance against possible Microsoft shenanigans
   on the Windows platform.

 - In longer run, Delphi/Kylix grows in interoperability
   and wins sales where developers need mixed Windows/Linux
   applications.

In short, Borland's move is an offensive strategy that leverages
Linux's advantages against the Visual Basic + Windows combination
in a way that is difficult to Microsoft to respond to.
