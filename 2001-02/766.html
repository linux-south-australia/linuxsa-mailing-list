Hi,

Because of confusion, and an off-again, on-again problem, it turns out that
I am giving a talk at tonight's meeting.

For those who missed it, here is the title and abstract again.

Title: Developing a Samba Client Library

Abstract

While there have been a number of Samba client libraries developed, from
SMBlib in 1996 to libsmb++ more recently, they all suffer from having been
abandoned by their authors and are no longer supported.  In late 2000,
Caldera wanted a supported Samba client library to allow them to enhance
Konquerer, so they contacted the Samba team among others.  Because of my
knowledge of the Samba source code, and the fact that I had done SMBlib all
those years ago, I was awarded the task.

This talk will explain what libsmbclient is, how it was developed and what
it means to the open source community. It will demonstrate a simple GTK+
test application developed with libsmbclient and look at where this library
is expected to be used and what its future may be.  It will also discus
some of the problems encountered during its development and how closely
tied it is to Samba.

This talk is intended for all open source enthusiasts, and while no
knowledge of Samba is required, it may help.



&gt;                                                            Is there
&gt;anything else that you need?

No, I should have everything I need ...

&gt;Thanks a bundle,
&gt;--
