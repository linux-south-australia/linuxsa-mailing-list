&gt;&gt; 1. Is it acceptable to require that Samba 2.2.0 or better also be installed
&gt;&gt; and configured to run on the next reboot. We only actually need nmbd to
&gt;&gt; run, and we would configure Samba so that it does not involve itself in any
&gt;&gt; elections etc if it is not already installed and configured.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We should probably add some obvious comments at the front of the master
&gt;&gt; smb.conf file to ensure that if they later go to install and configure
&gt;&gt; Samba, they can figure out what is going on.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 2. Is it acceptible to not touch anything and require the user to know what
&gt;&gt; to do if konqueror hangs, and that they should then go and install Samba
&gt;&gt; and configure it properly?
&gt;
&gt;For inexperienced users option 2 is pretty bad. If you only need nmbd
&gt;how about a third option:

Yes, that is what I though ...

&gt;3. Have an nmbd package separate from the Samba package (though
&gt;generated from the same source package). The samba package could also
&gt;contain nmbd for simplicitly or alternatively have it depend on the
&gt;nmbd package. Have the Konqueror package depend on either the nmbd
&gt;package or the Samba package (if both contain nmbd) installed. If nmbd
&gt;is in both never have both installed much like you don't have two
&gt;MTA's installed.

Ok, this is an interesting option, but what I am concerned with is creaping
complexity and the time it will take to get this out in everyone's release
cycle.

I already think that RedHat have made a Samba install far more complex than
it need be, as they have three RPMs for Samba:

  Samba-Common
  Samba-Client
  Samba 

I am not sure what others are doing WRT this, but it worries me that
introducing an nmbd only subset may increase the complexity for installers
and for people moving from a libsmbclient-using workstation to a Samba server.
