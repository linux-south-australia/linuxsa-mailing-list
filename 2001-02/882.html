Or *could be* innocent victims that were just the next recpient of a 
dynamically assigned IP address.

Simon

p.s. and I'm sorry, but calling IP addresses 'addys' is just so last century :)

&gt;Thus the list.  by having the list of another admin (that has been hacked or
&gt;attempted) you have addy's that COULD BE that next big hack.

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; At a deep level, I've skimmed all of these words in this thread and
&gt;  &gt; this keeps coming back to me:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; - Why not run your system securely in the first place?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The problem with any form of deny list has partially do to with a
&gt;  &gt; false sense of security that it might generate - the next big hack is
&gt;  &gt; guaranteed to come from somewhere that you don't expect!

&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Do you have a permenant IP?  If so and you don't hack then why are
&gt;you
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; worried?  You won't be denied if you don't do anything.  Server
&gt;admins want
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; people to come to thier servers.  They just don't want them
&gt;comprimised or
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; hurt.  So how you would be denied at thier site if you have done
&gt;  &gt; &gt;nothing, is
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; something I don't understand.  Also, if your on a dynamic dial-in
&gt;service
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; and you find yourself being denied access on certain servers it
&gt;should tell
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; you something.  Get a new ISP.  They are obviously letting hackers
&gt;and/or
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; script kiddies run loose on the net.  Once a ISP gets the rep of
&gt;allowing
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; hackers and/or script kiddies then they get shut out of a lot of
&gt;sites
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; anyway.  Trust me, this much I have found out the hard way.  I'm
&gt;living in
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Germany where hackers and script kiddies are a friggin plague.  It is
&gt;hard
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; to find a network over here sometimes that doesn't have problems
&gt;  &gt; &gt;about being
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; denied at some sites.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;I cannot agree with this statement. The idea of changing ISP is obsurd
&gt;  &gt; &gt;-- lets say that a reputable ISP (such as Internode, Rebel etc) gets
&gt;  &gt; &gt;someone dialing up to their  service and `hacking' and gets their
&gt;  &gt; &gt;current IP on the ban list, that would mean that anyone else using that
&gt;  &gt; &gt;IP would be banned. Surely one should not be expected to change ISPs
&gt;  &gt; &gt;because of one stupid person wants to be a pain. How would one combat
&gt;  &gt; &gt;this? The unfortunate reality is that there are many people using a
&gt;  &gt; &gt;service with dynamic IP allocation. Even Telstra's ADSL (ugghhh...) uses
&gt;  &gt; &gt;DHCP. It'll be a while until every house, office or building has its own
&gt;  &gt; &gt;static IP (Although some businesses, particularly the larger ones have
&gt;  &gt; &gt;static IPs). How do you plan to work with problems such as this?
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;Secondly, if I was to install this list on one of my servers, how am I
&gt;  &gt; &gt;assured that its genuinely a hacker/script kiddie IP? While you may not
&gt;  &gt; &gt;deliberately put an incorrect address in there, someone else (maybe a
&gt;  &gt; &gt;hacker or script kiddie :-) might.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;Finally, how would you assure that this list stays up-to-date? It may be
&gt;  &gt; &gt;that someone who had an IP on the blacklist may have left that ISP and
&gt;  &gt; &gt;no longer is attached to the IP. That would mean that there is some poor
&gt;  &gt; &gt;Joe User guy with a blacklisted IP.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;It's a good idea, but it is flawed by no fault of your own.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;Unfortunately, System Admins have to deal with these hacker people. It's
&gt;  &gt; &gt;a reality. It is also unforunate that a genuine attempt by someone such
&gt;  &gt; &gt;as yourself to block these people from our servers can (an attempts
&gt;  &gt; &gt;undoubtably will) be mamed by these hackers/script kiddies.
