&gt;I would also like to know more on this product. Having been in the Tandem
&gt;world for 10+ years, I would
&gt;like to here some "real"  life experiences. With most so called clustering
&gt;software there is severe performance loss
&gt;from each cluster trying to manage the other ones. 

There is clustering software and there is clustering software, and the term
is much abused these days.

First, and foremost, no one is really doing yet what I would consider to be
real clustering. That is, the concept that Digital (DEC) pioneered with
their Distributed Lock Manager etc.

Some people refer to Beowulf style setups with PVM and distributing a
single app across a (possibly) large number of machines with a high speed
interconnect as clustering.

Some people are doing high-availability and there are a number of fail-over
things available.

I also note that IBM have just made their DLM from HACMP available as
something close to GPL, I think, so we can start building real clusters.

Some people, like Sistina (www.sistina.com) are providing a cluster-wide
file system that looks really good, GFS.

The TurboLinux clustering, when I last looked at it, was focussed at high
performance web farms, and used the Linux Virtual Server software to
dispatch web requests to a farm of back-ends. It also monitored performance
of the back-ends to see which system should reveive the next request.
However, it does not have a cluster file system at present. You really need
to serve static content, or your dynamic content must be based on a
separate database engine, or you have to be able to get away with using
RSYNC or perhaps DRBD to replicate your file systems.  It would be
interesting to use GFS and the IBM DLM in this sort of setup, but I suspect
that not many of the commercial databases are happy with GFS as yet,
although they may be happy with IBMs DLM (I imagine that DB2 is).

&gt;Having heard that Linux is pretty reliable and that some users were now
&gt;clustering systems, I've from a personal point of 
&gt;view decided to take a little notice of Linux. ( Please forgive me for being
&gt;slow off the mark ! ) 

Well, Linux is pretty reliable and interesting.
