actually, to be honest, I don't really mind if Simon plugs his company
somewhat. I suppose I was speaking for the silent masses. I'll try not to do
that in the future. However, having Simon and Mr Telstra there, with Simon
criticising Telstra as he is prone to do (probably quite justifiable) and
then the Telstra guy defending as you'd expect, could be ugly...

hmmm :)

&gt; I went to Simon's talk at the IEEE.  It was extremely interesting, and
&gt; simultaneously encouraging and depressing!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm keen. I think that Simon needs to be careful about pluggin
&gt; too much, but
&gt; &gt; I'm sure he will... perhaps we should invite a telstra and/or other
&gt; &gt; telco/ISP in to give a counter to the Agile push... I'm keen
&gt; for Simon to
&gt; &gt; give a talk with no plugs or criticisms, then 2 mins for any
&gt; ISP to plug or
&gt; &gt; whatever.
&gt;
&gt; `No criticism' is a bit of an ask when part of the talk described the
&gt; regulatory hurdles a new carrier has to jump along the way to the very
&gt; high and important hurdle of interconnection to the Telstra network.
&gt; I think the audience would be better served by just allowing Simon to
&gt; speak his mind.
&gt;
&gt; A Telstra viewpoint would of course be welcome.  There *may* be a good
&gt; justification for their behaviour...
&gt;
&gt; In particular, I would like to hear an update on how Agile are going
&gt; with stopping the cockatoos from nibbling the wires on their tower/s.
&gt; The day after the IEEE talk, DSTO was off the net for the same reason.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Mike Pope
