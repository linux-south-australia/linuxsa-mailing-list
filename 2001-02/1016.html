I had this message forwarded to me, which some list members may be
interested in, as the ATO web site has been discussed here before.

Cheers

Alex!

&gt; Subject: Open Electronic Goverment -ECI
&gt; 
&gt; You may not be aware but the Linux comunity is developing a campain 
&gt; to motivate the tax office to issue their 
&gt; ECI (Electronic Commerce Interface) for the BAS returns 
&gt; in a linux format. THIS IS A TEST CASE!
&gt; as the start of influencing all goverment electronic comunications.
&gt; 
&gt; Please  distribute to all linux members.
&gt; ...................................................................
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To support our position we need all possible interested parties To:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Contact the ATO Business Tax Reform Infoline [ 132478]
&gt; 
&gt; AND ..... /Or
&gt; 
&gt; ESD Technical Support on 1300 139 373
&gt; and request the 
&gt; "ATO Electronic Commerce Interface" in Linux or Unix format.
&gt; 
&gt; We have to ensure the Tax Office understand  there is a
&gt; substantial demand.
&gt; .................................................................
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "OPEN ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT" with Business and the people - ECI
&gt; 
&gt; THE GAME PLAN
&gt;  "Open Electronic Government" With the Business and the People, seeks:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. 	To ensure all Government data and/or software provided 
&gt;         via electronic format is able to be used from  common 
&gt;         operating systems and utilities, ie:
&gt; 
&gt; ·	- Microsoft Windows/NT
&gt; ·	- Unix/Linux
&gt; ·	- MacIntosh
&gt; ·	- Other ? 
&gt; 
&gt; 2. 	That software solutions will utilise true open standards,
&gt;         without proprietary extensions. 
&gt;         (ASCII, HTML, RTF, PDF ...  But NOT word)
&gt; 
&gt; 3.      The interface specification shall be an open publication.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. 	Where special readers, viewers or interactive solutions 
&gt;         are required, 
&gt;          - they will be made available to end-users 
&gt;            at no cost premium between operating systems.
&gt;  
&gt; .        - they will not require the purchase of more 
&gt;            than the simple utilities.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. 	All solutions provided shall NOT enable security breaches.
&gt; 
&gt; 6.      Total data transfered via the utility should be 
&gt;         made know to the end user.
&gt;  
&gt; ...................................................................
&gt; Discussion
&gt; 
&gt; THE GAME PLAN
&gt; "To ensure all Government network interfaces are based on
&gt; true open system standards"
&gt; 
&gt; We have now started the process with:
&gt; 1   the excellent article by .
&gt;      Rodney Gedda  <A HREF="mailto:rodney@linuxworld.com.au">rodney@linuxworld.com.au</A>
&gt;      <A HREF="http://linuxworld.com.au/news.php3?nid">http://linuxworld.com.au/news.php3?nid</A>=472&tid=2
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Muli's correspondence  to  Mr. S Vesperman
&gt;     (Asst.Commissioner Goods & Service Tax Queensland)
&gt;     has been refired to  Mr. Mark Bond, (Director of Goods &
&gt;     Services Tax Electronic Service Delivery)
&gt;     for a formal response.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. While we believe that the ACCC will be a valuable tool in
&gt;    bringing pressure to bear,
&gt;    We do not yet think the time is ready to approach them. 
&gt;    We need to have clearly defined objectives as we cannot 
&gt;    move the goal posts once we start.
&gt; 
&gt; PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Contact the tax office and...
&gt; 
&gt;     Would all interested parties comment to myself on the
&gt;     following so we can develop clear objectives:
&gt; 
&gt; A.   What open standards should be adopted by Government
&gt;      Departments in dealing with business and general public 
&gt;      via electronic means.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; B.   What format is suitable for distribution of documentation :
&gt;         -  Plain ASCII
&gt;         -  HTML  Vers ?
&gt;         -  RTF
&gt;         -  PDF
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -    When the GST commenced, the Manual was downloaded in PDF
&gt;      = exact copy of printed document.
&gt;      Now, if you want to get the Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) A
&gt;      Guide for Employers 2000,
&gt;      the downloaded printed version 150+ pages is
&gt;      unformatted, without page breaks, etc. very frustrating!
&gt;       (I am using Netscape on Linux)
&gt; 
&gt; C.   It is of no concern that the Government does not make the
&gt;      ECI program code available
&gt;      what is important is that the interface specification 
&gt;      is made available
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; D.   I note with the ECI software a number of individuals have
&gt;      offered their services to write the ECI however; 
&gt;      I do not want to give any Government departments
&gt;      in the future a OUT in that no Linux person came forward 
&gt;      to write theinterface, so they have not provided same.
&gt; 
&gt; E.   From comments received, we  will develop a clear set of
&gt;      guidelines that can be pursued with the tax office 
&gt;      and after winning, most likely utilising the ACCC,
&gt;      the precedent  may be applied to all Government departments.
