meanwhile, back in the real world...

even if your reasoning was perfect (which it isn't -- there are many reasons
a company may have for choosing any one piece of software (free or not) over
any other piece of software), it's far too much of a grey area, no matter
how clear it seems to you... in fact, it's grey even when it's clear...

hmm...

I'll leave it at that.

&gt; Let's spend thousands of dollars when the tools are free. I forgot that
&gt; about business - I pay them so they can waste my money. It would be
&gt; interesting to determine whether using "non free" software when you
&gt; could use "free" software is against the principle as stated in the
&gt; Trade Practices Act (or is it the company's act) that basically says:
&gt;
&gt; "You are legally required to take a decision that will not detriment
&gt; your company, shareholders and make profit"
&gt;
&gt; Given the obvious disadvantages of using Microsoft tools for some
&gt; purposes (eg IIS for basic web server, Exchange and so forth) but not
&gt; others (eg talking to people who insist on only using Microsoft Office
&gt; 2000 document types), could it be argued that:
&gt;
&gt; "Using IIS and Windows 2000 with the incumbent licencing costs is an
&gt; obvious disbenefit to your company and the decision that your managers
&gt; took on your behalf is a decision that was not in your shareholders'
&gt; best interests and therefore you have breached section blah blah
&gt; blah..."
&gt;
&gt; Citing the various free unices and such as viable, reliable and
&gt; easy-to-use alternatives to Windows 2000 and IIS. And I wouldn't even
&gt; dare them to start arguind their IT staff had no idea; I'd turn around
&gt; and then file a claim that not only had they acted without the
&gt; shareholders' best interests in this manner, but they also were
&gt; incompetent in hiring staff...
