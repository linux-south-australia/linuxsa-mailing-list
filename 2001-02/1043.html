&gt; &gt; IMHO, it's time.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree.  It's probably time.  
&gt;
&gt; But... :-) we need to realise that incorporation means covering our backsides
&gt; with insurance.  This will mean we need $$$.  This means we need to have the
&gt; concept of membership and membership fees.  

This isn't such a terrible thing.  Other lugs do it :)  If we can get
enough sponsors, then we can make membership free.  
 
&gt; And if we have membership fees then people like Compaq may want something for
&gt; using their place every month, Netcraft might want something for hosting the web
&gt; page and mailing lists, AUUG may see us as a competitor and be less likely to
&gt; help us out like they did last year, and if this is the case what of the issue
&gt; of open vs closed mailing lists?  What benefits do members get?  ie why should I
&gt; pay $$$ when I can come to meetings, participate on the mailing list etc without
&gt; joining?  Do we _really_ want to go down this path?

I would like to say, on behalf of AUUG, that AUUG does not see LinuxSA as
a threat.  In fact, AUUG are quite supportive (and have been in the past)
of LinuxSA.  AUUG is about promoting Unix and Open Source development.  

IIRC, there was talk in the past about AUUG helping LinuxSA become an
incorporated body.  I am not sure where the rest of the AUUG executive
committee members stand on this issue, is it worth pursing this matter and
finding out what is involved?  What are peoples thoughts on this matter?

If LinuxSA becomes an incorporated body, then we can seek sponsorship from
local companies to cover costs (even membership - which I think should be
free).  Companies and or organisations who are currently proving services
to LinuxSA for free, may prefer the recognition that they get as an
"Official" sponsor.  Furthermore, there are organisations such as Linux
International <A HREF="http://www.li.org">http://www.li.org</A> who can provide support and funding for
user groups advocating Linux. 

LinuxSA is great as it stands, but I think we can make more of an impact
if we are an incorporated body.  The current organisers put a lot of effort
into LinuxSA and companies Compaq and Netcraft are currently donating
time/venues/web space/whatever for free.

Incorporating LinuxSA, gives the current organisers a chance to distribute
hidden mundane duties they do, and it gives the companies that are already
helping/supporting LinuxSA a chance to be recognized as sponsors.
