Ok...  This looks like it works fine.  I appreciate the help!

One more task I failed to ask about is to seperate the log files into
specific files per server.  IE I have 10 hosts, logging to a central server,
I would like to see the files individually.  Does syslog facilitate this in
any way?  Or will I have to script it out by the host name with a tail of the
large syslog files?  In general I would like to have a seperate directory
keeping a copy of all logs per server.  This will be for security auditing.
We need to have specifics when we contact law enforcement due to breakins.
Without an un-corrupted log file its hard to get them to realize the truth of
the situation.  Anything written is 100X better than spoken.

Thanks for the help!

&gt; &gt; What about specifying the line twice?
&gt; &gt; i.e.
&gt; &gt; mail.info        /var/log/maillog
&gt; &gt; mail.info       @syslog.server
&gt;
&gt; This works.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I would hope that doesnt allow untrsted hosts to send
&gt; &gt; syslog data to your host?
&gt;
&gt; It does, and is a known issue.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there a way to allow certain ip's? or just all or nothing?
&gt;
&gt; Use ipchains (or whatever is appropriate for your kernel revision)
&gt; to narrow down the IP range that syslog can accept (if you need
&gt; to know the port, look in /etc/services).  Note that if someone
&gt; can guess the IP address(es) that you are monitoring, then they can
&gt; easily forge packets that will circumvent your filtering rule.
&gt; This, too, is a known issue.
