&gt; &gt; &gt; WARNING:  check time reached, running e2fsck is recommended
&gt;
&gt; (This message came up after the "autorun" messages come up, BTW.)

I don't know what you're running, so this is meaningless to me.  Does it
come
up when it's trying to mount the file system in question?

&gt;&gt; If you use the -F option to shutdown, it touches a flag in the root
filesystem
&gt;&gt; that the boot scripts check for, and force a filesystem check on
ReBoot[tm].
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; "shutdown -Fr now" can be your friend (unless people are still logged in
:-).

&gt; OK.  I found that "shutdown -Fh now" is *also* valid (i.e. it's not just
&gt; reboot-specific),

The first paragraph I wrote (and quoted above) states that -F is the option,
and
how that affects the process of booting.  You need to (re-)boot in order for
the
boot scripts to pick up the existance of whatever file it touches in /
(forcefsck?)
to force the fsck.  "It's not just reboot-specific" is semantic nit-picking.

&gt; The warning comes up while the kernel is still booting, despite the fact
&gt; that during the init process the filesystems (all ext2) on each of the
&gt; three partitions gets checked.

Clarification:  the kernel has booted before init runs (perhaps minus some
modules and dynamic configuration).  "the init process" does not check the
file systems, it runs programs from inittab dependant on the run level the
machine has been booted to.  Coincidently, the boot script lives there,
which,
incidently, checks filesystems, but their relation to init is the same as
when
you run "ls" - they're all children of process 1.

&gt; Maybe fsck is running and the system warning only gets turned off if
&gt; e2fsck runs?

fsck is a front end to e2fsck (and other fsck's, depending on the file
system
type).  e2efsck should be reseting the "Last checked" attribute on the file
system in question when it runs to successful completion.  It sounds like
that for whatever reason, that attribute isn't being reset.

&gt; Or maybe there's something about running e2fsck manually that's
&gt; different from the way init calls it?

No.

&gt; Or something.

Firstly, you're not mounting a CDROM at bootup, are you?

If not, determine which file system it's complaining about.
Then, post the results of this to the list:

for FS in `mount | awk '$5 == "ext2" { print $1}'`; do
    echo ${FS}:
    dumpe2fs ${FS} 2&gt; /dev/null | egrep '(time|M.* count|heck)'
    echo
done
