&gt; &gt; ? Isn't there somehting missing from this email -- or have I missed
&gt; &gt; something key from somewhere else? What is it that you are denying, why
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; you denying it, why should someone send an IP address to the deny list,
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; do I do with the list? etc?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not denying anything.  The why is simple.  If someone has been hacked

?

yes you are, you're denying selected IP addresses access to your system...
Nothing wrong with that, it's just information that is essential to
understand what the term "Deny list" means :)

&gt; from an IP  address they will add it to thier hosts.deny file.  By sharing
&gt; this file with other server admins we can help each other stop a hack
&gt; attempt before they get to your server.  The list will be updated as often
&gt; as possible all you have to do is add the list to your hosts.deny file and
&gt; away you go.

ok, fair enough...

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Additionally, (and you are welcome to deny me an answer to this if you
&gt; want
&gt; &gt; :) ) who/what is acns? (my understanding is that they/you/it
&gt; are/is based
&gt; in
&gt;
&gt; ACNS is my company.  And what does where I'm based have to do with wanting
&gt; to help other server admins protect their servers from hackers from around
&gt; the world?

nothing. Just interested. That's why I said you could deny me an answer --
it's none of my business :)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Germany)... Looking back at your posts to LinuxSA, they seem somewhat
&gt; unique
&gt; &gt; in that they don't relate to anything else on the list (the best one was
&gt; one
&gt; &gt; saying how impressed you were about all the feedback re your site, but
&gt; there
&gt; &gt; was no discussion at all about your earlier posts, at least not
&gt; on-list),
&gt; &gt; and tend to be promoting your site, which, as far as I can tell, is a
&gt; German
&gt; &gt; ISP with a /.-style weblog, containing news about yourself... I must
&gt; admit,
&gt; &gt; I'm interested now :)
&gt;
&gt; Well, you may wish (or not) to read a little closer before passing
&gt; judgements. :)

hmmm... not really judging, I was just intrigued by your mysterious cameo
appearances on this list :) Sorry if I sounded critical...
