HI richard,

yes there are such products.. one of then has a skirting board and a 
flashing panel product that fits in the home as a skirting or flashing 
on the wall and you plug in where you want to.. its aimed at the 
domestic market.. 

there are others with similar stuff.. try looking at electrical supply 
people like  lawrance and hansen or such like.

Sorry i can;t remember the exact name of the product.. it is aussie made 
though.. try L&H  if they know about it...

&gt; does anyone know of a company that makes power rails? ie like power boards
&gt; but with rails rather than individual sockets, so you can have your power
&gt; plugged in anywhere along the length of the rail?
&gt; 
&gt; ie instead of:
&gt; 
&gt;  --------------------
&gt; | / \  / \  / \  / \ |
&gt; |  |    |    |    |  |
&gt;  --------------------
&gt; 
&gt; with 4 places to put plugs,
&gt; 
&gt; it looks like:
&gt; 
&gt;  ---------------------
&gt; |=====================|  and you plug plugs in like:    \
&gt; |=====================|                              --
&gt; |=====================|                                 /
&gt;  ---------------------
&gt; 
&gt; so that each pin goes into a separate rail. This way you have an unlimited
&gt; number of power sockets and they are anywhere around the room... I believe
&gt; that they are usually a number of metres long, and are installed into the
&gt; wall. I _think_ they were developed fairly recently by an Adelaide-based
&gt; company...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; anyone know what I'm talking about? got a URL? -- when I search, I get
&gt; everything but this :)
