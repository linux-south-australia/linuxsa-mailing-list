&gt;Don't forget to check out projects like MOSIX -- It's free, and does the

Hmmm, having had a look at brief look at the MOSIX web page, it seems to me
that it is only aiming at one facet of what clustering is all about.

It would perhaps be useful to define some terms here as well since there is
so much abuse of the term.

Gregory Pfister, of IBM, wrote 'In Search of Clusters' a number of years
ago, and it is the definitive book on the area, in my view. It cites a lot
of early work by Digital on the subject.

The taxonomy starts with distributed computing, where lots of instances of
an application cooperate with each other to produce a result.

The next level is where services are available on all machines in the
'cluster' that allows a single application to run across all machines in
the cluster. This seems like what MOSIX and Beowulf clusters provide.

The next level involves a cluster-wide file system, where all machines in
the cluster see a single file system and use a DLM to coordinate access to
them all.

The highest level is where there is single operating system (image) running
across all the machines in the cluster that functions as one entity, not a
lot of entities that cooperate with each other. Your application might be
running anywhere in the cluster and might migrate as the need arises, and
parts of it might run on different machines, accessing services elsewhere
in the cluster.
