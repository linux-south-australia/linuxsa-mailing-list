Might this be awkward for peopel who are rabidly involved?
Ie it seems possible that many of the potential organisers for this sort
of event might be at the SAGE conference and therefore not in their home
state when the event is on, or have to rush back in an obscene hurry.

This would be OK for us here, but probably not so good for all the other
states, if the event is to be held the same day all over the nation.


&gt; 4.  What shall we call it?  I think we should maintain the name
&gt;     "Installfest" for continuity's sake, but "Freedom Day" has a nice
&gt;     ring  about it.

Unless all publicicty is very clear on the issue I suspect "Freedom Day"
(conspiracy theory - down with the UN, smash the world bank, Resistance!
etc etc you get the idea) might possibly draw people who are not the least
bit interested in Linux (or even copmputers) and converseley may not
attract a lot of people who might be intrested in Linux etc. 

This would of course be exacerbrated if the event were to be
international.

Whiel acknowledgin tat the open source software movementis a politcal one,
I suspect the term "Freedom Day" might be too political soudning in many
ways, for many people in many places.

Installfest is to my mind a much better fit for the event it "gets over"
what the event is about and seems less ambiguous.
