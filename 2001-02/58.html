Well,

theres a story about this big australian corporation that went with the 
upgrade mentality,  their IT department made an 'smelligent' decision.. 
they would upgrade under contract to the supplier of their 'stuffedware'.

Some of the staff at the 'coalface' (as it were) were actually quite 
literate and worked out how to design things like 'databases', 
'document' and spreadsheet templates to make their work easier.

So they went home one Friday and came back on the following Monday to 
find something like a hangover waiting for them.  All their data, 
templates and other important stuff was locked up tight in the 'old' 
version of the stuffedware.

To say the least, their IT helpdesk was swamped by calls from frustrated 
and not-so-happy workers in the central aussie bush with no-way of 
getting the IT people lined up for the ritual slaughter.

"What.. you can't get at your data??  No-one told us that any one even 
used that!!"
"Well, yes there is a problem with that,  yes we'll have to install the 
older version for you.... Pardon...  it'll be a week before we can get 
to you....  I'm sorry its the best I can do"

So the IT people sheepishly rolled up and installed the 'older' version 
for those that complained.. there are so many sites and so many people 
that it took nearly four weeks to complete at sites from brisbane to pt 
hedland.

How do I know this??  I was working in a Central Queensland town and 
oftern went into the heart of the area to work under contract for the 
Big Aussie.. the staff were eager to tell me about the troubles IT has 
caused them... no wonder they nearly went broke.

I think that any software firm that creates that amount of havoc must 
have a hidden agenda..  sales, upgrades and twenty years of guaranteed 
income for starters.. hmmmm maybe their not that dumb afterall...

Linux only seems to need minor patches and conscienscious effort to get 
it up and running with minimal maintenance.  Even an experimental kernal 
has run stably for over year without a reboot.

The main challenge is convincing the average user who sees nothing but 
MacroShit on his screen that there are alternatives...  Can you see a 
user using Unix at the command line level?  I sure can't.  It is the 
principle of Human Computer Interation (HCI) that premises people like 
the WIMP interface, and respond better to icons that look like such and 
such than a dull blinking cursor that expects them to know the right 
commands (mind you, most people could probably remember 'spread', 
'write' and 'database' if thats all they need to know).

A friend of mine who is an  expert on os/2 has stated that the people 
lost likely to bag other OS's are not likely to have ever used them.. 
relying on non-contact information to 'form' their opinions..

The general observastion i can make about Linux is:  people think they 
have to be a geek to install and use it.

IMHO  this is no longer the case, Linux sales in Japan were outstripping 
the main contender, IBM has annouced Linux support and has made their 
software and development tools available, as have Inprise with the 
'Kylix' (Delphi in sheeps clothing) programming tool.

THis leads me to believe that linux is about to see a huge shift. Corel 
might have been ahead of their time, but they may yet make money from 
the Office suite (which is fully compatible with its windows equivalents)

Thats my 2 cents... I'm Kent Brockman... NOT
