&gt; 1.  The Installfest should be on the same day all over the country.
&gt;     I'm  on record for saying that I don't like this solution, but I'm
&gt;     clearly in the minority, so I'll accept it.

I think the consensus last year around the nation was that on one day is
desirable -- let's try it this year... In fact, I'm all for a worldwide one
day eventy...

&gt; 2.  It should be on 18 or 25 August.

I think the 26th has been bandied around a lot nationally... was it a
saturday or a sunday in 2000?


&gt; As I pointed out, AUUG isn't the only organization interested in the
&gt; Installfest, so we should all get together and discuss how we're going

the national list is about to have it suggested, I think...

&gt; to organize it.  I do think AUUG is the only organization capable of
&gt; organizing a nation-wide event, however.  Questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Who wants to participate?

all the LUGs, all linux-related businesses, any other Linux related
organisation, and the rest of us  :)

&gt; 2.  When should we hold it?

IMHO, Aug 25 or 26

&gt; 3.  If we do agree to have it on the same day across the country, what
&gt;     do you think of a live video link?  I suspect we can get some
&gt;     videoconferencing people to sponsor that sort of thing.

is it worht it? maybe... time zones? Only if it's fully sponsored, and
there's maybe a star speaker or somthing :)

&gt; 4.  What shall we call it?  I think we should maintain the name
&gt;     "Installfest" for continuity's sake, but "Freedom Day" has a nice
&gt;     ring  about it.

IMHO, InstallFest or InstallDay is definitely better -- sums it up nicely,
has a history, is more Linux than UN-related, etc... :)
