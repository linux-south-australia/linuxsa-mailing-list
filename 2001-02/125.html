&gt; Richard, sorry for the delay in responding - other priorities.

'sok, I think this thread is dead anyway...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; sigh.
&gt;
&gt; I can think of several emotions that could've been expressed by that
&gt; sigh. Do you have a preference?

it was exasperation, but probably wasn't neccessary -- I take it back (hgis)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; sigh. I'm not trying to force anyone into anything. It is your
&gt; right to wear
&gt;
&gt; I made no mention of force. Hmm! I should've emphasised the 'you' in
&gt; front of the word choose.

obligate is similar to force -- I suppose I interpreted it stronger than it
was meant...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I'm opportunistic enough to buy hardware from retailers that have slim
&gt; margins - though I'll at least make sure there's a manufacturers
&gt; warranty.

fair enough -- these days, I tend to go for slightly more profitable
businesses, particularlyl when buying something other than a commodity item,
simply because I would like them to be around to support me if it breaks or
whatever  -- it's certainly easier than returnign to the manufacturer, as my
recent HD experience has shown :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; exposure is no good until someone buys something. I don't see
&gt; why you don't
&gt; &gt; get this.
&gt;
&gt; Put simply, there are likely to be more people out there with a similar
&gt; philosophy to you than there is to me. If they have the exposure & can't
&gt; sell their stuff, then either their stuff is crap, their adverts suck,
&gt; they're edvertising in the wrong place or all of the above.

mmm, but IIRC (and it was a long time back), this was about the places they
were advertising on... if you appreciate the free services like /., then one
way of supporting them is to do business with those that support them...
likewise, if you like the RSPCA, you may think it appropriate to choose to
do business with XXX brand doggy buscuits, as they sponsor the RSPCA...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I dislike the advertisers, but at least on the internet,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are not intrusive like on TV & radio...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No!? Perhaps you have access to an internet that I don't.
&gt; There is very
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; banner ads sit at the top of your screen on a web page that you
&gt; are looking
&gt; &gt; at. They do all they can to attract attention away from what
&gt; you are doing.
&gt; &gt; TV and Radio ads interrupt your program to give you an ad. I
&gt; don't see how
&gt; &gt; you can say that banner ads are not less intrusive than TV and
&gt; radio ads...
&gt;
&gt; Yep, at the top, down the sides & just about everywhere else they can
&gt; be squeesed in. I've even come across a couple of (Joe Public) sites,
&gt; that have little popup windows advertising a certain internet based
&gt; company whose name begins with 'Y'

well, in my exerience, they are less intrusive -- I just close them when
they popup (I hate popup ads, so I refuse to suport them), and occasionally
click on the odd banner ad...


&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; little about the internet that I think should be regulated,
&gt; advertising
&gt; &gt; &gt; would certainly fall into that category though. From curiosity, do you
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; hmm... I don't see why... what would need regulating, and by
&gt; whom would it
&gt; &gt; be regulated?
&gt;
&gt; Truth to tell, I don't think it'll happen. What should be regulated: The
&gt; quantity of adverts on any given page. Who should regulate it: Self
&gt; regulation would be nice (& perhaps the only likely way it'd work).

So the way to do this is to not view pages with too many ads... and support
those that have what you think is a sensible, sustainable number of ads...
the Internet is almost 100% capitalist in this regard -- there can be no
regulation, so it's completely driven by market forces... (of course, in
many other ways, it's completely socialist, and in most ways, it's
completely anarchistic)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; I think that wading through ads is something you do at porn and
&gt; mp3 sites.
&gt; &gt; They are not what I am talking about. I'm referring to /., user
&gt; friendly,
&gt; &gt; and so on...
&gt;
&gt; ROFL!  I'm amazed that some people will assume 'the worst'.  Ignoring
&gt; (for the moment) the fact that I have a 200MB/month download limit (& I
&gt; very rarely break that limit). What does it matter where the adverts are
&gt; found, adult entertainment or not?

sorry, not meaning to acuse, but illegitimate type sites do tend to suffer
more from ads than legitimate sites like Slashdot...

&gt; No they weren't what I was talking about either, in fact we're probably
&gt; talking about the very same thing, but from a different perspective.

maybe... :)
