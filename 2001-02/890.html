&gt;They want me to sign a 12 month contract for '1.5Mbs' connection with (at
this 
&gt;time unconfirmed) $300 yearly renewal fee at $135 / month.  I think a 12
month 
&gt;contract is unreasonable - 3-4 months would be fine.  I also do not own the 
&gt;modem - I rent it for around $300 / year.

With the exception of $300/year renewal, that does not seem to be much
different to the others I have seen. Does it have a download limit.

&gt;I am wondering if ADSL is worth the bother at all considering the technology 
&gt;has been available for a very long time now and is much cheaper in other 
&gt;countries ($30 / month in the USA I heard).

Well, I was told by a reliable source today that he has just signed up for
a USD80/month plan that is 1.5Mb/s down and unlimited data rate. There was
also no install/sign/join fee, and on a business plan, they throw in a
small aDSL router.

However, given that aDSL has been going for longer in the US than here, and
the geater competition and market, I do not think you can really compare.

I have taken up a 1.5Mb/s aDSL link at around $139/month, and I can tell
the difference. Download speeds of 80kB/s are great.

I now have the WebGear Wireless kit (2Mb/s) with a Linux gateway/firewall
between us and the internet, and it is great. The wireless gear was very
easy to set up. Everything needed is in the latest releases; in my case I
used Mandrake 7.2.

&gt;When I asked about Linux support or the willingness to provide technical 
&gt;informatiion if required (I made it clear time and time again that I am
happy 
&gt;to work things out myself if I just have the right techincal informatin) - 
&gt;Primus literally told me to get stuffed - they told me that I am on my own 
&gt;thank you very much.  All I was asking is if Primus uses standard protocols, 
&gt;set up, etc, and if - I would be fine.

Well, the ISP I am using is quite happy for me to use Linux or FreeBSD, or
anything. And, they even have people who know about Linux and FreeBSD.
Someone called Mark, I believe.
