&gt; sorry for messy reply - sehr busy :)

I tried Coda a few months ago - the experience was pretty horrible. As far
as I am concerned it's pretty far away from primetime, and for many
applications it may never be suitable. My two main gripes:

1) Fixed-size container filesystem

All coda storage has to be in a container file on the host filesystem, it
is fixed size and cannot (easily) by adjusted later.

2) Not possible to do disconnected use from startup.

If my laptop is connected to the coda filesystem, and then disconnects,
things work as expected (disconnected use). If I turn my laptop off, take
it home and start it up I cannot access my local coda filesystem in
disconnected mode - it needs to be connected then disconnected for it to
work.

At the time I tried it 2) was a known bug (actually perhaps 'shortcoming'
might be a better word) and is possibly fixed now. 1) is rather annoying
though and it seems unlikely to change.

Something that worked more like NFS would be good.
