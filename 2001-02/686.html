&gt; * are you sure it's not a REAL hardware problem?
&gt;

Well, the drive is used daily and there's no other signs of it that I can
tell. That drive's got an NT4 partition on it that was running fine when I
last used it, about a month ago. It's got that RH Linux partition that seems
to be fine (apart from the partitioning issues), and the FAT partition is
used regularly under Windows with no known problems.

&gt; The behaviour you're describing is very, very weird to say the least.

Don't I know it!

Actually, I just went back to an old RH5.1 install, and ran mke2fs there,
which ran fine.

Now that's got me thinking, maybe I never actually have done any
partitioning from this RH6.x install (from memory it was originally 6.0,
then got upgraded to 6.2 from an APC CD). It could be that the original
partition for the 6.x install was done from the 5.1, and the other
partitioning might have been done from any of Caldera, tomsrtbt disk, or a
BSD boot disk. Hmmm.

Anyway that would seem to point somewhere other than the hardware. If anyone
has any suggestions as to whether this issue is worth pursuing (and how to
do so) I'm open to it.

And I was just thinking about trashing that 5.1 installation to reclaim the
disk space. Maybe I'll hang on to it for a bit longer after all....
