Quoting James Mclean &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jamesmc@tne.net.au">jamesmc@tne.net.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; list,
&gt; ok, ISDN or ADSL??
&gt; 
&gt; ideally i would like a static IP, and have heard confilicting reports of
&gt; weather
&gt; ADSL supports static IP, whereas i know ISDN does it easily.

Yes, ADSL supports it. Telstra doesn't. This would only be consumer friendly, 
agains't Telstra company policy ;-) 

ISDN will give you a full duplex connection to your regular ISP, if they are a 
regular 56k provider, and you want 64k, normally you can connect as if it's a 
regular 56k dial-in account. If you want more than 64k, then it would be a 
matter of asking your provider for the number of increments of 64 you wish to 
use.

ADSL is asynchronous, which if to be used for a high performance web / email 
server, may not necessarily suit your needs. I've heard from many users there 
are still many bugs with Telstra's ADSL and equipment that it's not really 
worth using at this stage. 

&gt; 
&gt; what is the general opinion around the list?

Telstra suck !

&gt; 
&gt; Bandwidth is a small consideration (128k ISDN), but static IP is very
&gt; important
&gt; (ie web/mail server with domains to be connected to it)

I would suggest Internode / Agile when they have their ADSL service offerings 
will be providing static IP's upon request to users who require from what I 
have heard. After speaking with Telstra representatives I have learned that 
Telstra are running 2mb FDDI bandwidth links to each DSLAM in every supported 
exchange, which isn't necesarily a bad thing if there are not many users on the 
service, but in Telstra's case, there may be 1000 or more users sharing 2mb 
bandwidth. The other bandwidth consideration is where your node will be located 
in relation to the exchange. The further you are from the exchange, the slower 
your link as it is still running on copper wire.

&gt; 
&gt; so does ADSL support static IP or not? i have heard its the hardware
&gt; that
&gt; telstra give to customers, and have heard its adsl that doesnt support
&gt; it. so
&gt; which is it?

ADSL definantly supports it. Not sure about the hardware, since Telstra have 
had Alcatel specifically design it for them, it is more than likely that they 
have designed it to do that, otherwise it's done on the exchange end.

&gt; 
&gt; On an aside, where do you find ISDN cards to put into a machine to act
&gt; as a
&gt; router?

Traverse make ISDN cards compatible with linux. I think Leader Computers stock 
a generic ISDN card for approx, $80, not sure if it's linux compatible or 
not .. ??
