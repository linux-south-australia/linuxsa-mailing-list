&gt; Mea culpa.  I had offered to organise an ADSL presentation
&gt; for the meeting just gone, but I am under somewhat of a timetable
&gt; pressure this month and had to withdraw.  Richard Sharpe then went
&gt; out of his way to fill in with a presentation on the excellent
&gt; work he is doing.
&gt; 
&gt; LinuxSA is a volunteer organsiation, and these things happen.
&gt; 
&gt; It is grossly unfair to take Alex to task over my failings.

I should just point out that the ADSL talk I was talking about at the
meeting was in consideration of a conversation I had with Simon
Hackett from Aglie. He gave a fascinating talk to the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers about what Agile is doing at the
moment, especially down at the Coorong. I asked Simon (when we were
short of a speaker, before Richard jumped in at the last minute) if he
would be interested in presenting a similar talk to LinuxSA with a few
minor alterations.

- Add in some stuff about ADSL, maybe including a 'how it actually
  works' bit, with specific reference to the Telstra implementaton of
  ADSL.
- Try to make it impartial, and non commercial.
- Emphasise the aspects of the Agile Coorong rollout that use open
  source software, and explain what is being done there.
- Aim the talk at the 'engineer' in all of us and bring along photos
  of boxes, routers, radio towers and other cool equipment and gear.

Simon said that this was fine, and I said that I'd find out what the
feeling was at the meeting about weather or not there would be any
objections to such a talk (thinking about the comercial aspects) and
get back to Simon with a yes or no.

So now might be a good time to ask "Is this talk what you guys want to
see".

Is this talk what you guys want to see?

To be fair, I think that we should only hear opinions from people who
actually go to the meetings.

Also, some feedback from those who have actually seen Simon's talk
(Alan Kennington, David Newall, Nick Stock, et al) would be
appreciated.

Cheers

Alex!
