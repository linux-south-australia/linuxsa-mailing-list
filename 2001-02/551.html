Ryan!

&gt; How exactly would I go about configuring my Linux Debian 2.2 box to email?

Be more specific. Do you mean to local addresses or to somewhere over
the Internet?

&gt; that is, if I type in mail &lt;email addy&gt;, type the email, ^D.. for it to
&gt; actually *Get* to the desination?  (currently I get a "Message Frozen"
&gt; email)

&lt;sigh&gt;

If you relay through an ISP it's much easier to use their SMTP server.
Despite the fact that you can use your own - and my ALIAS (not me, no
not me) has been doing so for a long time now - there are some paranoid
people and/or broken implementations of Sendmail which won't masquerade
properly as another domain.

&gt; I assume I'd need to configure SMTP?

Yes. Debian probably has /usr/doc/HOWTO/mail or some such thing. Take a
look at it.

&gt; Will something like: tail -f /var/log/messages | grep time | mail &lt;mail&gt; &lt;
&gt; ^D "\c"

Probably and probably not. There are a few things at
<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/">http://freshmeat.net/</A> that I've seen in passing that can do these kinds
of things. One of them is called logwatch and you probably already have
it. Try looking up something like "logs email send" and so forth..

Because in the past I was not me, I refuse to accept any responsibility
for any e-mail
 that I sent in the past.
The other lloy0076 was and is an imposter.
 At least according to some...
