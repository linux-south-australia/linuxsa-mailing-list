Hi David & Steve

All slots in a pc are created 'almost' equal.

Almost being the operative word here.

&gt; &gt; SOOOOooooooo its a windows problem, :-)))) I reckon you should be flamed
&gt; &gt; to death, nothing personal just a good roasting   ;-)))))
&gt;
&gt; It is not solely a Windows problem.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyways.. When you installed the S3 did you put it on PCI-1 slot? W-blows
&gt; &gt; is funny if your video card is placed on a PCI slot after other cards,
&gt; &gt; not all the time but sporadic.
&gt;
&gt; Funnily enough I did. I wouldn't have expected an Operating System (?)
&gt; to get funny about where one's video card actually is.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Next, depending on version of windows the realtek
&gt; &gt; needs updated drivers to work.  I know, I have the same cards on some
&gt; &gt; comps and could not get them to work without drivers from net.  I still
&gt; &gt; have them here if you want me to send them to you.
&gt;
&gt; Given the tone of this e-mail, and that it's running under an insecure
&gt; Operating System (?) I think I'll get the drivers myself. Who knows what
&gt; your drivers would do?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh and lastly, S3's  have a habit of using IRQ 10 as default, check
&gt; &gt; W-blows for V-card IRQ even though it did not tell you there was a
&gt; &gt; conflict.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it does use IRQ 10. But what's wrong with that?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Ill help you along since you are linux guru and might have trouble with a
&gt; &gt; flawed, corrupt system ;-)
&gt;
&gt; I do actually know how to operate Windows, but thank you nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Press start, - settings- control panel - system icon - device manager -
&gt; &gt; display adapter - (click card) properties..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry could not resist ;-)
&gt;
&gt; You are not sorry. Desist!
&gt;
