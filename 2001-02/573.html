&gt; &gt; Hello Group. I am experiencing problems with routed.
&gt; 
&gt; From what I glean below you're not running routed but you do have a
&gt; routing problem. 

right and wrong. Not a routing problem, an interface configuration
problem. see below.


&gt; &gt; Feb 13 21:27:29 graphite network: Bringing up interface lo succeeded
&gt; &gt; Feb 13 21:27:30 graphite ifup: route: netmask doesn't match route address

bingo! this is the root of your problems. The rest is a help message
from the route command

&gt; &gt; Feb 13 21:27:30 graphite ifup: Usage: route [-nNvee] [-FC] [&lt;AF&gt;]
&gt; &gt; List
&gt; &gt;  kernel routing tables
&gt; &gt; Feb 13 21:27:30 graphite ifup:        route [-v] [-FC] {add|del|flush} ...

&gt; hmmm, do a search for
&gt; documentation on TCP/IP and routing.

There's a pearl of advice

&gt; &gt; Now I cant find anything that would be the problem apart from during the
&gt; &gt; setup I setup the static ip on the linux machine
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IP : 192.168.1.1
&gt; &gt; Netmask : 255.255.255.255
&gt; &gt; Nameserver : 127.0.0.1
&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't IP be IPADDR? Check that FIRST.

well, I would check FIRST your netmask. It looks wrong. I think you want
255.255.255.0


&gt; &gt; Feb 13 21:28:34 graphite linuxconf:     Executing: /sbin/route add -net
&gt; &gt; 255.255.255.255 netmask 255.255.255.255 dev eth0
&gt; 
&gt; That is an error. Big time. That says "broadcast to all umpteen million
&gt; internet addresses". I'm sure we all love you but not _that_ much...look
&gt; in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 or such.

uh, only if his eth0 is connected to the internet, and with an ip of
192.168.x.x, unless there was some big ipv4 oberhaul, there isn't going
to be a problem.

Generally, you set up your ethernet on a class C.

IP: 192.168.1.x
MASK: 255.255.255.0
broadcast: 192.168.1.255
netowrk: 192.168.1.0

(generally, these days you do not need to supply the last two arguments,
the tools can figure it out)


and then, when it comes to the internet, you need to worry about default
gateways, and extra interfaces and stuff ( you haven't mentioned how
this is setup for you)

Also, it looks as if linuxconf (shudder) is trying to get a DHCP address
for you. If you are on a network with a DHCP server, this is good. If
not tell linuxconf not to use DHCP or BOOTP.

good luck,
Jake
