PHP will do the job fine. We run something similar here in PHP...it was
easy.
All you have to do is fopen("<A HREF="http://www...">http://www...</A>", "r"), and you can read the
results
just as if it was a file.

PHP is, IM*H*O (don't want any wars!) a little bit easier to use than
perl...IMHO IMHO IMHO

Hi all,

At 05:31 PM 2/19/01 +1030, you wrote:
&gt;list,
&gt;
&gt;how would i write a small script to test if a connection is still
available?
&gt;
&gt;i would like to use PHP idealy, but would bash or a perl script be more
&gt;suited?
&gt;i dont know bash or perl though.
&gt;
&gt;could i have some ideas on the syntax its self?

You would probably find Perl easier. I found it very easy to learn (with
about 6 months of
prior C prog. experience and one of those cheap "...in 21 days..." books).
IMO the syntax was like a hybrid of C and Shell-scripts, but there are
probably better critiques
available from the proffessional programmers on the list.

&gt;i am guessing that i would need to ping every minute or less often, and if
&gt;i get
&gt;no result back, then wait 15 mins and reconnect.
&gt;
&gt;the link is a ppp link
&gt;
&gt;how would i do this?

Just curious, but wouldn't it be simpler to just check for ppp0 in an
ifconfig output?
I realise this won't do diddley in the way of diagnosing a PPP link that
has gone 'stale' but
then again pings won't work if the ISP happens to block ICMPs.

Cheers,
-Dan

unsatisfactory
