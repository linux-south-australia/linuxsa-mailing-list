Richard Russell openned the following can of worms:
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, it's time.

I agree.  It's probably time.  

But... :-) we need to realise that incorporation means covering our backsides
with insurance.  This will mean we need $$$.  This means we need to have the
concept of membership and membership fees.  

And if we have membership fees then people like Compaq may want something for
using their place every month, Netcraft might want something for hosting the web
page and mailing lists, AUUG may see us as a competitor and be less likely to
help us out like they did last year, and if this is the case what of the issue
of open vs closed mailing lists?  What benefits do members get?  ie why should I
pay $$$ when I can come to meetings, participate on the mailing list etc without
joining?  Do we _really_ want to go down this path?

&gt; We should incorporate well before Installfest, have some transparent, clear
&gt; and active leadership, and continue on our merry way.

Do we _need_ such formalisation (besides insurance) to hold an installfest?  I
don't think so.  Afterall Richard, you did a _great_ job last year!
 
&gt; Comments? (particularly from those on the "organisers" list -- who is on
&gt; there now?)...

I'd guess that Geoffrey, Matthew [Tippett] and probably Alex are on the list.
 
&gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; PS: Personally, I think that Geoffery and co have done (and are doing) a
&gt; great job, but I think it's time this group became an independant entity, so
&gt; that certain things (mailing lists, InstallFests, lobbying) can happen more
&gt; efficiently.

Are things so bad now?  LinuxSA works for me right now.  Not to say that I'm
against formalising our merry little band, but there are cons as well as pros. 
Oh well, here probably comes a long discussion, and it wasn't even started by
David or Alan :-)
