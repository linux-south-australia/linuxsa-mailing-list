Glen!

&gt; Mea culpa.  I had offered to organise an ADSL presentation
&gt; for the meeting just gone, but I am under somewhat of a timetable
&gt; pressure this month and had to withdraw.

That's OK.

&gt; Richard Sharpe then went
&gt; out of his way to fill in with a presentation on the excellent
&gt; work he is doing.

Yes, it was quite a good talk. Very interesting and I think the
smbclient library will make integrating the SMB protocol in Unix
applications much easier than it was before.
 
&gt; LinuxSA is a volunteer organsiation, and these things happen.
&gt; It is grossly unfair to take Alex to task over my failings.

I wasn't taking Alex to task. I think I should assume that you are under
a lot of work pressure and have misinterpreted what I said. I was
indirectly trying to say to Alex that I think it would be appropriate to
time-table a talk on this subject. I can't for the life of me interpret
what I said as taking Alex to task.

&gt; I note that your name doesn't appear in the list of presentations
&gt; at:
&gt; 
&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/</A>

It appears on the tips page. I have submitted another tip about
continuing an ftp transaction but it hasn't been put onto the web-site
yet.

&gt; I hope this is an oversight.

Yes, it is. I have offered to do at least one talk, and possibly more
than one. If I recall correctly, I offered to do a presentation on
DocBook and one "hands on" kernel rebuild. If you listen carefully over
the next three days someone else and me are about to offer to take on a
rather time consuming, volunteer task...

I honestly do not know where you are coming from.
