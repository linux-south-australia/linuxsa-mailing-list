&gt;No the reason why this is such a disgrace is because he is one of the

&gt;The book is published by heinemann and written by G.K Powers.
&gt;
&gt;This is why its pretty sag, because its so new!

Ahhhh, now that suggests a way forward.

Can you give me the ISBN of the book please.

We could get a copy (I could spring for a copy) and review it, and then
write to the Education Department with our criticisms ...

We could offer to disseminate our criticism widely and see if that evokes a
response.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi Adam,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What year is the book published? The fact that it mentions LANtastic would
&gt;&gt; indicate its reasonably old.
&gt;&gt; Is your teacher a full time computing teacher? Might need to cut him / her
&gt;&gt; some slack, not all of them are enlightened. :-)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I know there's been a discussion about linux in school and in
&gt;&gt; workstations,
&gt;&gt; but i was quite disgusted when i had to summarize a piece out of my
&gt;&gt; computing text book at school. This chapter was on Operating systems,
&gt;&gt; Network operating systems was one of the subheadings. What i was totally
&gt;&gt; offended by was that not once did it mention Linux OR UNIX as a networking
&gt;&gt; OS or server OS. They did mention OS's like Novell, Windows NT (oh of
&gt;&gt; course) and LANtastic, but no Linux nor UNIX. Like lets be serious here,
&gt;&gt; what kind of OS is windows NT, one tiny lil thing it doesnt like
&gt;&gt; it asks for
&gt;&gt; you to reboot it 1000 times a day, before the poor little IT tech has to
&gt;&gt; come and fix it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This was only one thing i was quite offended by, there was another, that
&gt;&gt; same day. My teacher also offended me about linux too! simply
&gt;&gt; because of his
&gt;&gt; naivity towards anything but Mac OS or Microshaft products. I was talking
&gt;&gt; about cable and how he has his puters all connected up to cable
&gt;&gt; at home. He
&gt;&gt; was saying how he has a NT workstation running wingate, i then told him
&gt;&gt; about my setup, my Linux gateway/server. He was like "A *LINUX*
&gt;&gt; server" like
&gt;&gt; who would ever use something like that. I then went on to explain to him
&gt;&gt; that when he has to reboot his windows NT machine several times a
&gt;&gt; day, i can
&gt;&gt; leave my very low powered linux server on for months on end without even
&gt;&gt; getting close to wanting a reboot. He then uttered some bullshit
&gt;&gt; to try and
&gt;&gt; convince me NT was better and then told me to sit down as he was about to
&gt;&gt; start the lesson.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; what a joke!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I must admit, for somethings, windows NT may be the better
&gt;&gt; option, but when
&gt;&gt; it comes to running a server, nothing can beat the reliability and sheer
&gt;&gt; power of LINUX! *roar* :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyway, something to have a winge about :)
