Well, it was getting too frustrating not being able to trust what
mke2fs/fdisk were up to. As it happens, a colleague had just lent me a copy
of Partition Magic 5 to try out so I used that to restore my extended
partition to 4G, which worked fine, but left me wondering why I was having
to use a Windows-based GUI tool to do what I should be able to do under
Linux with ease? Which led me to <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/">http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/</A> and an
interesting comparative experience.

I used parted to remove the new partition I'd created earlier, then to
expand my existing root partition by another 2G (instead of creating a new
partition and using that for /usr as I had planned to do with fdisk).
Excellent!

Inspired (and after having my system slow to a crawl running XWindows - why
*did* I only create a 40M swap?) I used parted to shrink my old RH5.1
partition to make space for an larger swap. No problemo.

Not exactly an extensive test, but I'm very pleased with the ease of being
able to do that.

parted, however, follows the traditional Linux terse and abrupt 'do what I
tell you' style operation. Unlike fdisk, etc., tell parted to do something,
such as delete a partition, and it's done! Which was a bit disconcerting
first time around (luckily I *had* specified the correct partition to
delete!). Hmmm, second time I tried using the -i (interactive) switch but I
still didn't get any prompting. By the way, they suggest re-creating any
partitions accidentally deleted - don't forget to make a record of the
partition sizing beforehand!

I found the partition parameter representation style a little, well, clumsy.
parted shows and uses a "disk space in Megabytes" format to define partition
start and end. Which, of course, end up being fractional (and a tad
nonsensical, one partition starts at the same "size" as another finishes,
e.g. 2025.144). Personally I'd prefer to stick to the old cylinder
definitions, even if they don't mean what they used to. Apart from that,
when resizing an ext2 partition you can't also change its starting location
(but you can do that afterwards in a separate step - not sure why they
couldn't accommodate doing both at the same time, but it's no biggie) and
when I created a swap partition, it wouldn't actually show as being of type
swap (but mkswap(?) didn't have a problem with it).

Download the disk image and create your single parted boot disk, couldn't be
easier.

Partition Magic 5 claims to handle ext2 partitions, but I didn't put it to
the test. It comes on 2 floppies and boots into that DOS/Windows environment
(not sure what MICROS~1 call it) and presents a GUI/menu system to operate
it. A graphical representation of the disk layout can be clicked on to
choose the partition and a graphical means of adjusting partition size and
location is provided. All I can say is it worked for adjusting the extended
partition size because that's all I used it for.

Good luck to all you partition manipulators, and: "Be careful out there".

P.S. I'm still keen to resolve what's happening with fdisk/mke2fs - I'd
still appreciate suggestions of where/how/who to follow this up (with).
