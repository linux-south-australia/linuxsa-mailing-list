David,
&gt;
&gt;Well if you need help there's always the list.
&gt;
Well so far it has been easy nuf, any distro (in this case winlinux (I hear
the moaning) ) Installed with KDE and openoffice. I have an xterminal to
connect remotely (they like the idea of multiple sessions etc being
offloaded from there machine to someone elses). Open office is installed on
4 machines, Bosses at home (NT), HR manager at work (NT),  mine at work
(NT) and Linux box. So far they were surprised as to how close it is to
outofbox usability (DUH). So they are playing with it, macro compatability
with XL will be stumbling block but if it helps reduce our license to a
handful of people it's done the job as format compatability of word/data is
good.

I will slowly usurp their desktops through xterm to the linuxbox but I need
to get samba going (so far all I can do with it is spell it (just))

&gt;&gt; To compound it though we have internally developed applications (very much
&gt;&gt; core to the business) based on VB and SQL Server.
&gt;
&gt;What can I say?
DOH! is normally sufficient :P

&gt;&gt; David suggested all the toolkits around for Linux but they just all seem
&gt;&gt; too hard too much hassle to setup and use.
&gt;
&gt;You point and click and then use an editor of your choice to fill in the
&gt;blasted spaces. What more can I say? Are we so brainwashed by Microsoft
&gt;and Borland that we don't realise that something like GLADE which:
&gt;
&gt;* sets up UI
&gt;* sets up callbacks (methods as Delphi calls them)
&gt;
&gt;You do realise that you have to code the method button.click. You can't
&gt;RAD delphi into doing specialist things with your database. At some
&gt;stage RAD stops, and development must occur.

Sorry for the generalisation, I briefly looked into  1 or 2 toolkits
halfheartedly Kdevelop and gtk (from memory). Once I realised the learning
curve will be slightly longer than 8 mins I put it aside as a console ui
was sufficient for my needs in Linux at the time.  

&gt;Call me absolutely stupid - and many have - but since when has
&gt;DELPHI/MICROSOFT VISUAL XYZ (c++, basic etc) - been anything more than a
&gt;quick interface creator. If DELPHI is as wonderful as you claim it is,
&gt;why can't it write the code for source forge without human intervention?

Ok, your absolutely stupid, but correct! :) 

&gt;They're not too hard. Maybe you can't install Linux. Maybe setting up
&gt;GNOME with RedHat or Mandrake or Suse's installation programs is way
&gt;beyond your expertise. Maybe learning Qt is far too difficult for you.
&gt;Maybe you hate C. Use gtk and use perl, python or whatever. I don't
&gt;care. Perhaps clicking "Install Development Environment" is way too much
&gt;for you...

Bugga I typed setup and it said welcome to Linux ;-)
Then I expected to have all I needed, didnt so I got it installed both
binary/source rpms as well as slackware packages etc. 

&gt;Methinks you haven't even bothered to even attempt to setup these
&gt;development environments and, possibly, you're not even aware they're on
&gt;your system. What you're saying is that the retraining necessary to use
&gt;one or more of these toolkits may prove too expensive. But to state that
&gt;they "seem too hard [and] too much hassle to setup and use" is not true
&gt;from my point of view.

I have as mentioned earlier but time was pressing so I opted for console
and simple makefiles/gcc etc. 

&gt;I think, also, you're deliberately making gtk+ and Qt look difficult to
&gt;program when they're not. Geez, even I can write applications in them
&gt;and programming isn't one of my strenghs (although I understand source
&gt;code in virtually any existing language if it's presented to me)...


&gt;&gt; As a developer I would love the ability to move to Linux develop
&gt;&gt; applications in a RAD style in the same way I can with Win32 VB/Delphi. I
&gt;&gt; know there are lots of organisations of varying size who would make the
&gt;&gt; move once such an environment becomes available for Linux even if their
&gt;&gt; backend remains MS Sql Server the client software need not be MS.
&gt;
&gt;Believe it or not I managed to pull together a match making program
&gt;using Visual Basic once. It was quite amusing, and a bit laborious. You
&gt;should try running a ranking algorithm in Visual Basic where you can't
&gt;guarantee all the ranks will be there. But I digress...you seem overtly
&gt;worried about the interface and blase (pronounced blah zay) about the
&gt;coding.
&gt;Worry about the coding. The interface is easy.

no coding is easy the interface sucks! It is repetitive and reminds me of
the old cobol days where I only ever had 1 complete cobol header file and
just rehashed it.

RAD is designed to save time on the TEDIOUS repetitive blocks of code so
you can actually write the code that does the work not manage the GUI. Of
course with Delphi and later versions of VB you can define your own classes
inherit polymorph etc but I have yet to have a need for anything like that.

&gt;Admittedly, we might have to learn C or C++. I don't suppose Microsoft
&gt;developed Windows 2000 in Visual Basic or Delphi...I wonder why. Have no
&gt;idea. Maybe it wasn't the right tool for the choice...

Actually.... NO, but VB is funny because they do x-compile to c++ then use
VCC to build binary :)
Wish I could catch it mid-step I could then optimise my code much easier.

&gt;&gt; Until such time I really cannot see MS based organisations like us making
&gt;&gt; the switch in a serious sense and currently I sadly suspect there will only
&gt;&gt; be a novelty factor in trying Kylix.
&gt;
&gt;Look. If you pay me something like $10 000 000 I'll develop - in
&gt;collaboration with others - a RAD application that has similar
&gt;functionality to VB. Let the programmers think that programming is
&gt;Visual Lloy....I can see myself becoming the "Next Bill Gates [tm]"!!!

I don't think it's the functionality so much as the compatability. GCC
supports the text based Borland Object Pascal not the GUI side of things.
Delphi was a packaged up widgetised version of that. but if you could come
up with a VB CLONE for Linux then you can write your own cheque! Kylix is
Delphi on Linux not an alternative to Delphi.

&gt;&gt; As to the licensing I think they should release a working demo version with
&gt;&gt; the DB objects so people can actually try it show it to the bosses and then
&gt;&gt; say it is far better than what we do or at least as good. I don't see our
&gt;&gt; organisation paying 1600 so I can experiment. If it proves worthwhile we
&gt;&gt; would not have a problem with paying the price for 3-4 licenses so long as
&gt;&gt; any run-time stuff is freely distributable.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with you on that point.

BULLSHIT you're just teasing :)

&gt;And this ain't off topic...


Evan
