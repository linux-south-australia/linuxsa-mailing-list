Hi,

I am soliciting input on ways to deal with the following problem.

Before getting down and dirty, the background is that we (Caldera and I)
want libsmbclient to work and for users to be able to use it easily without
having to be technical experts and to do lots of funny things to get it to
work.

That being said, we are looking for the simplest way to achieve that, and I
think that many of the people on this list can sympathize with that view
and can offer useful advice.

Now to the details.

libsmbclient sends NetBIOS datagram requests to browse the network and find
the SMB servers out there.

When the programmers who wrote some parts of Windows NT and Windows 95 were
coding, they made a mistake that causes problems now. Win2K has fixed this
problem.

The mistake was that when responding to a NetBIOS datagram, they always
send it back to UDP port 138, regardless of the source port in the request. 

This causes problems on two fronts:

 1. libsmbclient is a library that will mostly be run by ordinary users.
    Ordinary users cannot get access to port 138, so they cannot see 
    the responses, and thus cannot browse a NT- or Win9X-based workgroup.

 2. Even if a proxy were run as root to grab that port and ferry the 
    responses to libsmbclient (which can be done with TDB), the user will
    experience problems when trying to start Samba if they decide to
    do so at a later stage.

It turns out that I can code things to have nmbd receive the responses
(which it will do if it is running) and give them to me via TDB (a facility
in the latest version of Samba--2.2.0 and above).

Now, please do not worry too much if you do not understand the technical
details so far. They are fairly well established, both from tracing packets
and talking on the various Samba lists.

What I am now trying to get input on is:

If a Linux distro is installing a package that uses libsmbclient, like say
konqueror:

1. Is it acceptable to require that Samba 2.2.0 or better also be installed
and configured to run on the next reboot. We only actually need nmbd to
run, and we would configure Samba so that it does not involve itself in any
elections etc if it is not already installed and configured.

We should probably add some obvious comments at the front of the master
smb.conf file to ensure that if they later go to install and configure
Samba, they can figure out what is going on.

2. Is it acceptible to not touch anything and require the user to know what
to do if konqueror hangs, and that they should then go and install Samba
and configure it properly?
