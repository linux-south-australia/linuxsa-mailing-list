At a deep level, I've skimmed all of these words in this thread and 
this keeps coming back to me:

- Why not run your system securely in the first place?

The problem with any form of deny list has partially do to with a 
false sense of security that it might generate - the next big hack is 
guaranteed to come from somewhere that you don't expect!

&gt;  &gt; Do you have a permenant IP?  If so and you don't hack then why are you
&gt;  &gt; worried?  You won't be denied if you don't do anything.  Server admins want
&gt;  &gt; people to come to thier servers.  They just don't want them comprimised or
&gt;  &gt; hurt.  So how you would be denied at thier site if you have done 
&gt;nothing, is
&gt;  &gt; something I don't understand.  Also, if your on a dynamic dial-in service
&gt;  &gt; and you find yourself being denied access on certain servers it should tell
&gt;  &gt; you something.  Get a new ISP.  They are obviously letting hackers and/or
&gt;  &gt; script kiddies run loose on the net.  Once a ISP gets the rep of allowing
&gt;  &gt; hackers and/or script kiddies then they get shut out of a lot of sites
&gt;  &gt; anyway.  Trust me, this much I have found out the hard way.  I'm living in
&gt;  &gt; Germany where hackers and script kiddies are a friggin plague.  It is hard
&gt;  &gt; to find a network over here sometimes that doesn't have problems 
&gt;about being
&gt;  &gt; denied at some sites.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I cannot agree with this statement. The idea of changing ISP is obsurd
&gt;-- lets say that a reputable ISP (such as Internode, Rebel etc) gets
&gt;someone dialing up to their  service and `hacking' and gets their
&gt;current IP on the ban list, that would mean that anyone else using that
&gt;IP would be banned. Surely one should not be expected to change ISPs
&gt;because of one stupid person wants to be a pain. How would one combat
&gt;this? The unfortunate reality is that there are many people using a
&gt;service with dynamic IP allocation. Even Telstra's ADSL (ugghhh...) uses
&gt;DHCP. It'll be a while until every house, office or building has its own
&gt;static IP (Although some businesses, particularly the larger ones have
&gt;static IPs). How do you plan to work with problems such as this?
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, if I was to install this list on one of my servers, how am I
&gt;assured that its genuinely a hacker/script kiddie IP? While you may not
&gt;deliberately put an incorrect address in there, someone else (maybe a
&gt;hacker or script kiddie :-) might.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, how would you assure that this list stays up-to-date? It may be
&gt;that someone who had an IP on the blacklist may have left that ISP and
&gt;no longer is attached to the IP. That would mean that there is some poor
&gt;Joe User guy with a blacklisted IP.
&gt;
&gt;It's a good idea, but it is flawed by no fault of your own.
&gt;Unfortunately, System Admins have to deal with these hacker people. It's
&gt;a reality. It is also unforunate that a genuine attempt by someone such
&gt;as yourself to block these people from our servers can (an attempts
&gt;undoubtably will) be mamed by these hackers/script kiddies.
&gt;
