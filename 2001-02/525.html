&gt; &gt;Does that mean that they didn't work originally with the standard
&gt; &gt;WaveLAN drivers? I would have thought that the standard ones
&gt; would work
&gt; &gt;if they are using the 802.11b (or whatever it is) standard.
&gt; &gt;I could be wrong though, as I've only ever used the Lucent cards.
&gt;
&gt; I have no idea.

Well.. it doesn't really matter what the transmission standard is, the
actual driver for interfacing between the card and the computer is
completely arbitrary. Different 802.11b cards made by different
manufacturers may (should!) be able to communicate with each other, but as
far as I know there isn't really a standard for drivers (judging by the
thousands of drivers in existence today) However, WaveLAN is a bit unusual
in that AT&T, WaveLAN, Orinoco and Cabletron cards will all work with the
same driver. The only incompatibility in this case seems to be the stickers
they attach in the factory :)
