&gt; &gt; In other words if you feel you wish to use the list then do so.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect that you are putting yourself into the position of being an
&gt; expert offering advice.  Even though you receive no benefit for giving
&gt; that expertise you still have a duty of care.  Your advice must be
&gt; sound, and if somebody incurrs damage from taking it they may have a
&gt; against you.

All I'm saying is that I won't be held responsible for your actions.  If you
decide you want to use this list on your server then go ahead.  If not then
don't.  Which ever way you choose it's on you.  At the moment that is the
stand that I have.  Now, this may of course change in the future but for now
that's the way I see it.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It is your choice and has nothing to do with the IP's being banned.
&gt;
&gt; Other than the obvious something, being that those IP's are then isolated
&gt; from me.

Do you have a permenant IP?  If so and you don't hack then why are you
worried?  You won't be denied if you don't do anything.  Server admins want
people to come to thier servers.  They just don't want them comprimised or
hurt.  So how you would be denied at thier site if you have done nothing, is
something I don't understand.  Also, if your on a dynamic dial-in service
and you find yourself being denied access on certain servers it should tell
you something.  Get a new ISP.  They are obviously letting hackers and/or
script kiddies run loose on the net.  Once a ISP gets the rep of allowing
hackers and/or script kiddies then they get shut out of a lot of sites
anyway.  Trust me, this much I have found out the hard way.  I'm living in
Germany where hackers and script kiddies are a friggin plague.  It is hard
to find a network over here sometimes that doesn't have problems about being
denied at some sites.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't see this list being used by AOL or some large corporation
&gt;
&gt; But I *do* see this list being used by somebody with a grudge against AOL,
&gt; namely by submitting AOL's IP addresses.  Maybe they submit it from 942
&gt; different forged email addresses.  Does that meet your "must be submitted
&gt; by X people" criteria?

Do you really want AOL users on you server anyway? ;) just a joke.  OK next
time I'll go kick my dog instead. (hint: that was a joke too. hehe).
Anyway, like I said at the moment it's not a large list at all.  Just 10
ip's for now.  Have about 500+ waiting though.  Am also trying to figure out
the best way to setup the whole thing.  If you have any good ideas I'd love
to hear them.  I'm totally open to suggestions.  PLEASE! hehe.
