&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm experiencing lost connections with my ADSL connection, and the only way
&gt; to get back the connection is to turn off the ADSL modem and turn it back
&gt; on. The thread "ADSL review"
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/</A>) talks a
&gt; little about this. The thread said the modem wasn't up to specs so nothing
&gt; could be done, but this didn't happen to me when the modem was connected to
&gt; the other box running win98/2000 so I can't help but to think it's a problem
&gt; with the pppoe driver.

Well, since I was the person who started that thread, I guess I'd
probably be fairly well placed to answer your question.

The symptoms that you are descibing sound pretty much identical to the
problems that we were suffering when we first set up. The actual problem
mentioned in the thread was actually tracked down to a faulty network
card, which, re-reading the thread, kinda does tie in with what John
Edwards was saying in
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-09/682.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-09/682.html</A>. After replacing 
the LAN card, the problem cleared up.

Now we are having a problem in which the link starts to deteriate after
a period of time, very similar to a modem that isn't retraining
correctly. At the moment I have a cron job running every three hours to
drop the link and bring it up again. Yes, that really is how bad it is!

Having said that, I'm not too sure that we don't actually have a problem
with the phone lines going into our server room, as we are having
problems with normal modem dropouts as well. I have our phone company
coming out to check wiring and whatnot early next week, so hopefully
we'll be able to get it sorted out.

Tell you what though, we do seem to have had a lot of problems with the
service... If anyone on the list knows of a carrier/ISP who will provide
a 2Mb syncronous service for the same price as our 1.5Mb asyncronous
ADSL service, you might have a new customer! (This is in the CBD, in
Currie Stree).
