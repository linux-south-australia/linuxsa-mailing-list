Thank you Very much David Lloyd, and Daryl Tester!

I have been wanting to use ipchains for a few days now.  Most of my systems run
RH6.2 2.2-14, im uping to 2.2-17 soon.  I did take a look at syntax in the man
pages, however I still didn't have a clue as to how to write a rule.  I did see some
good faq's online about using it, but still had no good examples.

I will try these, and go from there.  If you could, quickly that is, let me know how
to disallow all ftp access to a subnet, but allowing another subnet full access?
Far too many people are trying anonymous ftp to our sites, and it would be nice to
drop them at the front door.  However I would like to know if you can log the IP
before it is dropped.  Maybe then I can track down who the annoying party is.

&gt; &gt; What about specifying the line twice?
&gt; &gt; i.e.
&gt; &gt; mail.info        /var/log/maillog
&gt; &gt; mail.info       @syslog.server
&gt;
&gt; The first one seems to catch it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; In some examples it looks like you can do this, and it will write to both.  I
&gt; &gt; havent tried it yet, but it may work.
&gt;
&gt; I tried that and it don't work.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Syslog -r  ?  Thats it?  I would hope that doesnt allow untrsted hosts to send
&gt; &gt; syslog data to your host?  Is there a way to allow certain ip's? or just all
&gt; &gt; or nothing?
&gt;
&gt; Run some firewall rules on your hosts. Something like:
&gt;
&gt; ipchains -A input -i ppp+ -s any/0 -d $MYIP 541 -p udp -j DENY
&gt; ipchains -A input -i eth+ -s $MYSUBNET $THESUBNET -d $MYIPD 541 -p udp
&gt; -j ACCEPT
&gt;
&gt; And if you have a default policy of deny that will only allow syslog to
&gt; your local subnet and deny anything on a ppp link...
