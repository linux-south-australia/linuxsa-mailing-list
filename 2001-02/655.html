Ryan,

Prior to debian 2.2, I used sendmail to send and fetchmail
to receive.  Nowdays I use exim to perform the send role.
At the time of the last upgrade I didn't want to loose my
sendmail configuration as I had put some time into getting
it just right for use with overnight connect to ISP.  However
the debian docs indicated that exim is debian's preferred MTA.
I was delighted at the ease with which things worked.  When the 
configuration script ran, I told it that I had a smart host
(not connected directly to the internet or some such thing).

I noted that when the install was complete, mail is sent by
/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/exim

Later I discovered that a dud address was causing a delay 
during my daily ISP hook-up, my solution: edit /etc/exim.conf
under "remote_smpt:" add connect_timeout = 3m

Hope this helps.

If not, please let the list know what mail transport agent (MTA)
you have selected, perhaps somebody with experience with it
could come to your rescue.

As for your second question, (automatic send of a log file).  As
you have guessed, a script will need to be written, you appear
to have identified all the correct bits.  Have a look at the man
page for mail to see how stuff can be piped to it.  Work at it one
bit a a time.  For instance put something into a pipe with echo or
cat, then try mailing it to yourself.  When that bit is right,
replace the trivial content with the tail bit.  I wouldn;t use the
-f flag with tail for this role because the -f will never close the
pipe!

Good luck.

&gt;Heya.
&gt;
&gt;How exactly would I go about configuring my Linux Debian 2.2 box to email?
&gt;that is, if I type in mail &lt;email addy&gt;, type the email, ^D.. for it to
&gt;actually *Get* to the desination?  (currently I get a "Message Frozen"
&gt;email)
&gt;
&gt;I assume I'd need to configure SMTP?
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, how can I make it so when certain text (in particular, my ppp
&gt;connect time) in /var/log/messages will automatically email an address?
&gt;
&gt;Will something like: tail -f /var/log/messages | grep time | mail &lt;mail&gt; &lt;
&gt;^D "\c"
&gt;
&gt;work ?
&gt;
&gt;(i honestly have no idea)
&gt;
&gt;thanks.
&gt;
&gt;Ryan.
