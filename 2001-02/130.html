&gt; &gt; If I have same files which differs only by extra LF in the end diff
&gt; &gt; tries to load them. So diff not working (or need special options)
&gt; &gt; this way.
&gt;
&gt; I'm having a little difficulty understanding exactly what you mean.
&gt; I think you are saying you have two files like the following:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;    FILE 1                 FILE 2
&gt;    blah blah blah^J       blah blah blah^J
&gt;    more blah blah^J       more blah blah^J
&gt;    ...                    ...
&gt;    another line^J         another line^J
&gt;                           ^J
&gt;
&gt; These are identical except for an extra line-terminator at the end of
&gt; FILE 2.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, perhaps you mean you have two files like this:
&gt;
&gt;    FILE 1                 FILE 2
&gt;    blah blah blah^J       blah blah blah^J
&gt;    ^J                     more blah blah^J
&gt;    more blah blah^J       ...
&gt;    ^J                     another line^J
&gt;    ...
&gt;    ^J
&gt;    another line^J
&gt;    ^J
&gt;
&gt; The first file is the same as the second, but with blank lines, ie
&gt; "extra LF" inserted (after every line).
&gt;
&gt; In the first case the amount of memory needed should be small since the
&gt; files are identical right up to the last byte.  An implementation might
&gt; choose to buffer some part of each file, for example one line, or as much
&gt; as it can, or somewhere in between.  The diff provided with RH7.0 buffers
&gt; 8k per file.  (In the first case the memory needed would be about 16K.)

I mean first case.

&gt; In the second case the two files are very different, and the memory needed
&gt; depends on how diff resynchronises.  If it requires two matching lines
&gt; (in each file) before they are considered to be resynchronised then both
&gt; files must fit in memory.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect that you had two files that were like the second case, above.
&gt; Those files were really very different.  There's nothing "only" about
&gt; an extra LF "on the end" of every line.

I know that diff must work that way but under 6.2 it says that memory
exhausted as soon as check file sizes. Even not tries to read them. May be I
need to check for newer diff version.

&gt; &gt; I doing the same thing as diff
&gt;
&gt; Are you really?  You seem to have some uncertainty about what diff does,
and
&gt; so I have trouble accepting that you are doing the same thing.  You
probably
&gt; meant that you are producing the same output.

No... I mean that I utilize same algorithm - synchronizing after difference
encountered. But I not buffering data as diff do - just remember where I
must continue to compare after resync. Output is different and depends on
task which I doin'.

&gt; Did you the read the manual page and see the options relating to comparing
&gt; large files with scattered small changes?  Did you try them?  What result
&gt; from that?

I'm not so stupid! :) Of course I tried them all - result the same - "memory
exhausted".

Vladimir
