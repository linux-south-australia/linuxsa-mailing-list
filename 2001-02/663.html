&gt; I checked few different modern modems before posting - all of them claim
&gt; that they are Hayes compatible and all of them understand ATW command (I
&gt; didn't compared whole extended set). So statistically "every" modem will do
&gt; so.

Another gem.  Vladimir, you are so amusing tonight.  Now, it seems, that
checking a few (is that three?) out of thousands gives a statistical "every".

&gt; I don't know what Hayes model you're looking but as I remember my old Hayes
&gt; SmartModem 1200 (alluminium case - good style :) of 1989 this command was
&gt; supported.

Is that right?  I think the old 1200baud Hayes modems did not support
"buffered" connections.  The port speed was adjusted (after connection) to
be the same as the line speed, so it's hard to imagine how you could use
a command that would permit you to choose between the "two" values.

&gt; PS: Anyway givin' try to this command will not break your modem :)

I think there's an obvious point which I made before: Different modems
have different commands.  Without knowing what modem we are talking
about what is the point in trying to guess the command?  There is another
point that I hinted at, but refrained from making in too obvious a way
(and now shall say clearly and unambigously): this list is not a substitute
for reading the manual; which in this case is the modem manual; and which
in this case can only be read by somebody with that type of modem.

Boring and brainless thread, and by the way if you check the archives has
been discussed before.  All of these points, by the way, including "read
your own goddamn manual," and "gee ATW works for me, it must work for you,
too."
