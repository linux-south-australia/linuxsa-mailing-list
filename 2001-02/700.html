&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I have just recently installed a new network of 30 pc's, running windows 98,
&gt; connecting to a linux box running samba and a whole heep of internet
&gt; services. My one problem which I have just come across is none of the Win98
&gt; boxes seem to be following any of the group policies I have set. I have
&gt; created a config.pol file, placed it in /home/netlogon and all the machine
&gt; policies have taken effect but nothing else. I even created a user policy
&gt; and nothing happened.
&gt; 
&gt; The procedure I followed to setup policies were :
&gt; 
&gt; * Create Unix Groups, add Users to groups. (this is working because the
&gt; logon scripts are reliant on groups and these work perfect)
&gt; * Installed Policy editor, Group policy support from /tools directory on the
&gt; Win98 cdrom.
&gt; * Enabled User level access control (also tried shared level access control)
&gt; * Created policy file with all appropriate groups and machine policy and
&gt; placed config.pol in /home/netlogon
&gt; 
&gt; After all this each PC followed the default computer policy, however if I
&gt; update the default computer settings in config.pol none of the win98 pc's
&gt; change.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any experiences in this field or knows what step(s) I have
&gt; missed or forgotten ?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help greatly appreciated.

Windows 95 had to be updated to make use of group policies. I have seen
the same thing for Windows 98, but I don't know of an available patch.
You can try the Windows 95 one (let me know if you can't find it).

Also, try running poledit on the workstation and setting it to
automatically update from the default location (in case it changed it's
mind or something).

Hope it helps,
Matt
