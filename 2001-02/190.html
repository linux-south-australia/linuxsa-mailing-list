Let's spend thousands of dollars when the tools are free. I forgot that
about business - I pay them so they can waste my money. It would be
interesting to determine whether using "non free" software when you
could use "free" software is against the principle as stated in the
Trade Practices Act (or is it the company's act) that basically says:

"You are legally required to take a decision that will not detriment
your company, shareholders and make profit"

Given the obvious disadvantages of using Microsoft tools for some
purposes (eg IIS for basic web server, Exchange and so forth) but not
others (eg talking to people who insist on only using Microsoft Office
2000 document types), could it be argued that:

"Using IIS and Windows 2000 with the incumbent licencing costs is an
obvious disbenefit to your company and the decision that your managers
took on your behalf is a decision that was not in your shareholders'
best interests and therefore you have breached section blah blah
blah..."

Citing the various free unices and such as viable, reliable and
easy-to-use alternatives to Windows 2000 and IIS. And I wouldn't even
dare them to start arguind their IT staff had no idea; I'd turn around
and then file a claim that not only had they acted without the
shareholders' best interests in this manner, but they also were
incompetent in hiring staff...
