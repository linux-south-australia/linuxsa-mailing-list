I have received a few emails from David Lloyd that are stupid and moronic.
Therefore, all emails I receive from David Lloyd will be stupid and moronic.

Despite the logical flaws in that argument, it seems to work :)

&gt; Vladmir!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I checked few different modern modems before posting - all of them claim
&gt; &gt; that they are Hayes compatible and all of them understand ATW command (I
&gt; &gt; didn't compared whole extended set). So statistically "every"
&gt; modem will do
&gt; &gt; so. It really depends on "What can be called Hayes compatible" -
&gt; &gt; compatibility with basic command set or compatibility with
&gt; extended command
&gt; &gt; set too.
&gt;
&gt; So if I meet three Russian immigrants who make sweeping generalisations,
&gt; I suppose all Russians make sweeping generalisations.
&gt;
&gt; DL
&gt;
&gt; ps.
&gt;
&gt; I know at least 3 Davids who are all wonderful, kind, gentle, diplomatic
&gt; people. I am one of them. Maybe all people called David are wonderful
&gt; people...
&gt;
&gt; ps to the ps.
&gt;
&gt; My point is that your posting as quoted is, well, to put it in one of
&gt; two ways:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Statistically inept
&gt;
&gt; Even a Year 12 mathematics student wouldn't make such an inept
&gt; statement. You haven't stated how many a few is, or said their brands. I
&gt; suppose you've checked the majority of modems that claim they are Hayes
&gt; compatible.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Troll bait
&gt;
&gt; I was tempted to say "absolutely stupid" or "moronic" but decided that
&gt; was impolite. So troll bait it is. What's troll bait? "Deliberately
&gt; saying something that is absolutely stupid and/or moronic in order to
&gt; elicit even more stupid and/or moronic answers"...
&gt;
&gt; *hmmm*
