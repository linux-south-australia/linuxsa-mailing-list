&gt; Hi all!
&gt; As a branch from another thread, I'm now curious.  How would
&gt; those on the list go about overwriting every physical
&gt; byte/sector of a linux drive/partition, using linux tools?  This
&gt; is something that is often done in situations involving data of
&gt; a confidential or secure nature, and I was curious as to the
&gt; methods that might be used in a linux environment to achieve
&gt; this action.
&gt; Don.

which ever tool u use, if someone really wants to (all it takes is 
access to the raw read on the drive and a Digital Cro with the ability 
to 'mask' the signal) reconstruct the drives previous contents, they'll 
find a way.

In England, the Home Office rules for Hard drives was:

	remove the drive, dissassemble (steffanie), grind the platters
	to a powder and retain for 12 years.

	Pretty effective, i'd say.

US Dod (something like):

	Write the drive with inverted bits, all 0's, all 1's, random
	bytes, then zeros on each pass and repeat 6 times over entire
	drive

fairly good against raw read technique.

&gt;&gt; If I really
&gt;&gt; wanted to wipe the drive clean, I'd start with a low-level
&gt;&gt; format, should the tool for the particular brand drive exist (it
&gt;&gt; does for some), then use something like Norton's Wipeinfo to
&gt;&gt; repeatedly overwrite all sectors of the drive with garbage byte
&gt;&gt; data.
