&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 	I have been asked to set up a gateway machine for a two
&gt; machine subnet for a friend (I have never
&gt; tried anything like this before). He has a 486 (specs not
&gt; available to me yet) to act as the gateway
&gt; for a Mac (pre OS X) and a Windoze98 machine. What kinds of
&gt; things should I be reading about and
IPCHAINS or ipfwadm

these two programs do the same thing. ipfwadm is just a later version i
guess?
This program is used for firewalling and as the name suggests forwarding
ip's in a sense.
Basically what this program does is when a request is sent from one of the
two machines, it registers who it is from, requests the information, and
then when received, sends information back to person who asks for it. *by
the way this is a kinda newbie way of explaining it*

An example of what you would need to run on the linux machine for you to get
the system forwarding ip's (masquerading as its called) is the following:

/sbin/ipchains -A forward 192.0.0.0/24 -j MASQ

OR

/sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -P tcp -S 192.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0
/sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -P tcp -S 192.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0

This will set up a gateway on the linux box. But this will certainly NOT
filter any packets, you'll have to read up on that one yourself :)

Then! in windows, go to the TCP/IP settings for the NIC for the LAN, and put
in the IP of the linux machine you have set up as a gateway, in the gateway
section. REBOOT, and if you've set everything good, u should have yourself a
gateway :)




&gt; what can I expect the 486 to support.
It will certianly support everything running in the console... well maybe
not serving large amounts of data too efficiently, but it will serve as a
good gateway for sure!

I dunno about X windows... it may run, but just too slow! :)


&gt;The subnet will be run off
&gt; a dynacally assigned IP (read
&gt; between the lines). The 98 machine is involved in serving
&gt; streaming data , tha Mac primarily is used
&gt; for surfing.

Streaming data?? What type of connection would you be using then?

are you fimilar with dhcp and linux? You'll have to make sure you install a
program called dhclient. If using cable/adsl that is, you'll have to run
this on startup.

PPP is a totally different story. Dont ask me about that one. :)

Good Luck.

Adam W.
