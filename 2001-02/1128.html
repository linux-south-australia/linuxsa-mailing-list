Hi all,

When do we start baking?

I'll bake for the next meeting.

&gt; &gt; The alternative would be to convince one of the Local Government
&gt; &gt; Authorities or the Local Government Association to run such a library

&gt; &gt; buying power and possible could sponsor it as well.
&gt;
&gt; Sponsorship is unlikely, as the state government is ripping
&gt; funding out of council libraries.
&gt;
&gt; Libraries are more than happy to receive donations of
&gt; books from hobbyist groups.  For example, the Aussi
&gt; Masters swimming clubs contribute books on swim coaching
&gt; to the library on Kintore St, City.
&gt;
&gt; This isn't cost-free to the library.  Despite that, they make an
&gt; effort to get contributed items catalogued and shelved quickly.
&gt;
&gt; A quick browsing of my bookshelf suggests that we need about $1,500
&gt; to make a worthwhile donation of books that would adequately
&gt; cover UNIX computing.  Mind you, this would be something
&gt; excellent to do, as it would genuinely make Linux cheap to
&gt; install and configure.  So maybe we need to start making
&gt; chocolate crackles.
&gt;
&gt; Being serious for a moment, that might do it.
&gt;
&gt;   $1 * 70 people at meeting * 10 meetings = $700
&gt;
&gt; So if we got a core of people together to supply an snack during
&gt; the meeting break we could fund a decent range of computing
&gt; books for the Adelaide library in about two years.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts?
