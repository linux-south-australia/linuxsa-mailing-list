Hi Geoffrey,

Can you please make some sort of determination on this please, or pass it
on to your minions to do so?

Whilst I have always agreed that HTML should not be posted to mailing
lists and newsgroups (or even ever), it is becoming increasingly obvious
that allowing it onto the list unaltered is not in the best interests of
the linux cause.. especially if you are a newbie.

That there are offers to supply code to fix the issue (or even solutions
already available) means the only cost to Netcraft would be some processor
cycles.

How about it?

Michael

&gt; &gt; Has the mailing list host (Netcraft) agreed to the proposal?
&gt; 
&gt; I take their silence on the matter as indication that they haven't. Dale
&gt; Long and Daryl Tester, from memory, have both offered to code something
&gt; and to my knowledge their offer has not been undertaken. As you'd be
&gt; aware other people have created rather amusing flame wars from posts
&gt; that I've put about HTML e-mail - even when I've been extraordinarily
&gt; polite (1) - so what more can I say?
&gt; 
&gt; DL
&gt; 
&gt; (1) which is why I don't bother about being too diplomatic any more
&gt; about it. People seem to flame the subject of HTML rather than the
&gt; actual posting...
