&gt; - package selection
&gt; 
&gt; I have a really small hard drive. Hence, it complained even when I had
&gt; no packages selected. Selecting packages by hand was painful, slow and
&gt; annoying but I've come to expect this. Woe to those who attempt to
&gt; install any Linux distro from Mandrake, Suse or Redhat (and probably
&gt; Debian) onto a 1Gb hard drive and expect not to have to wade through
&gt; tonnes of options working out what you really need.

What differs here from RH is that during individual package install it
actually shows dependancies (sp?). Rather coming up with a screen
afterwords with the dependancy problems (aka RH). Which is very annoying
as you can't choose individual packages to disregard plus it doesn't
show what categories they belong to either in the previous selection
area.

So thats one up for Mandrake but otherwise I don't like the installer.

mdk.

P.S. Another annoying RH problem, index.html package is required by
Netscape & Lynx. Very stupid when you don't normally install the RH
user's guide etc or have any interest in a link page to RH.


&gt; 
&gt; - installation
&gt; 
&gt; Installation went very smoothly. It was slower than a text based RH 6.2
&gt; install but still :-) I was running it under X.
&gt; 
&gt; - GRUB options
&gt; 
&gt; Any newcomer would be confused by the expert grub configuration. GUI or
&gt; not...but I managed. Looking at GRUB it has a setup that is as esoteric
&gt; as NT-LOADER, and apart from the fact that you see things Linux in a
&gt; grub configuration file its configuration format is suspiciously
&gt; NT-LOADER boot.ini'ish.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) First boot
&gt; 
&gt; The first things I noticed was that it was SLOW. Bit time SLOW. I make
&gt; this complaint about RedHat installs too, but this was even slower than
&gt; RH 6.2 default installation. I diagnosed the problem as:
&gt; 
&gt; * kernel
&gt; 
&gt; Mandrake - even more so than RedHat - seem to turn on every option they
&gt; think you might need. Whilst most of them are modules, a significant
&gt; number aren't. Furthermore, it had decided that my <A HREF="mailto:AMD-K6-III@450">AMD-K6-III@450</A> was an
&gt; i486 and hence I got landed with i486 kernels. At least, this is what I
&gt; think is happening.
&gt; 
&gt; * setup
&gt; 
&gt; Not much different from RedHat. In fact, I'd say if you knew RedHat
&gt; you'd probably be able to bumble around Mandrake without too much
&gt; hassle. In fact, if you avoided any of the "Drak" GUI utilities you
&gt; could probably not even notice you're using Mandrake.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, after a serious rebuild of the kernel (with my usual piles of
&gt; optimisations) it is going faster. But I'm still convinced my rebuilt RH
&gt; 6.2 is faster....oh well.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Final Comments
&gt; 
&gt; It's another distribution. It appears to work. If it's supposed to be
&gt; optimised for speed, then Mandrake's definition of speed is different to
&gt; mine, but then again I must remember that I've recompiled almost every
&gt; library and every major program on my main computer.
