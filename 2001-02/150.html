Martin!

&gt; crond: can't lock /var/run/crond.pid, otherpid may be 13493. Resource
&gt; temporarly unavailable.


Run 

[<A HREF="mailto:martin@localhost">martin@localhost</A> martin]% ps ax | grep cron

You may see a PID file in /var/run or /var/lock. Do:

[<A HREF="mailto:martin@localhost">martin@localhost</A> martin]% cd /var; find -name cron*

You may need to run that as root. When cron starts some initialisation
files and some programs write their PID in /var/lock (or is it
/var/run)...if it dies unexpectedly it's unable to delete them and it
thinks that cron is still running. Personally I don't like this
behaviour; I can't see what's wrong with doing somethin like ps ax |
grep cron but still.

&gt; cron stat failed (/etc/cron.d)
&gt; 
&gt; This occurred at the time that I deleted the /etc directory.

stat is a system call that reads inode contents. That's esoteric, so
what it is really saying is "I can't find cron.d or any information
abuot that file". Does it exist? If it doesn't it should be a direcotry.

&gt; Does my system just need a reboot to fix the problem? However, if I reboot
&gt; the system, I am scared that it would come back up.

It probably doesn't require a reboot. It should come back up. You could
attempt moving the cron directory under /var/spool/cron to something
like /var/spool/cron.backup and reinstalling cron from your original CD.
Then move /var/spool/cron.backup to /var/spool/cron.
