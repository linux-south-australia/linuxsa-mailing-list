&gt; Richard Russell openned the following can of worms:

heh -- it's my forte :)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IMHO, it's time.
&gt;
&gt; I agree.  It's probably time.
&gt;
&gt; But... :-) we need to realise that incorporation means covering
&gt; our backsides
&gt; with insurance.  This will mean we need $$$.  This means we need
&gt; to have the
&gt; concept of membership and membership fees.

yes

&gt;
&gt; And if we have membership fees then people like Compaq may want
&gt; something for
&gt; using their place every month, Netcraft might want something for

so be it -- they may also like to sponsor us financially...

&gt; hosting the web
&gt; page and mailing lists, AUUG may see us as a competitor and be

ditto for netcraft

&gt; less likely to
&gt; help us out like they did last year, and if this is the case what

hmm... I don't think AUUG competition will be a problem...

&gt; of the issue
&gt; of open vs closed mailing lists?  What benefits do members get?
&gt; ie why should I
&gt; pay $$$ when I can come to meetings, participate on the mailing
&gt; list etc without

This is what needs talking about -- maybe we should look at other LUGs...
but IMHO, a quasi-voluntary system could work -- you can participate in all
but voting...

&gt; joining?  Do we _really_ want to go down this path?

IMHO, yes. I know there are positives and negatives, but I think the
positives outweigh the negatives...

&gt; &gt; We should incorporate well before Installfest, have some
&gt; transparent, clear
&gt; &gt; and active leadership, and continue on our merry way.
&gt;
&gt; Do we _need_ such formalisation (besides insurance) to hold an
&gt; installfest?  I
&gt; don't think so.  Afterall Richard, you did a _great_ job last year!

it wasn't easy. We don't need it, but it would help... it would also help
with a number of other issues that have cropped up in the last months...

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Comments? (particularly from those on the "organisers" list -- who is on
&gt; &gt; there now?)...
&gt;
&gt; I'd guess that Geoffrey, Matthew [Tippett] and probably Alex are
&gt; on the list.

any comment from the organisers?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; rr
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS: Personally, I think that Geoffery and co have done (and are doing) a
&gt; &gt; great job, but I think it's time this group became an
&gt; independant entity, so
&gt; &gt; that certain things (mailing lists, InstallFests, lobbying) can
&gt; happen more
&gt; &gt; efficiently.
&gt;
&gt; Are things so bad now?  LinuxSA works for me right now.  Not to

no, but IMHO, it's time to chnage :)

&gt; say that I'm
&gt; against formalising our merry little band, but there are cons as
&gt; well as pros.

yes...

&gt; Oh well, here probably comes a long discussion, and it wasn't
&gt; even started by
&gt; David or Alan :-)

yes :)
