I suspect db2 is quite expensive too, possibly on par expense wise with
oracle.

I am also not sure that db2 has been avaialbe for linux longer.


I havne;t used db2 much, nor oracle for that matter.
I iused oracle at uni and found irt to do sort of what I expect.

I ahve also used db2 a bit, thught mainly a version called db2 connect
used for connecting to other db2 dbs from various machines.
I have used it on linux to connect to an as400.

It does not seem to be as inutitive as orcle (if you can call any sql
intuitive) however this may have been soemthing to do with the fact that
I was connectig to an as400 whcih aprarenlty uses a diufferent sort of
structure for databases ( ia m not sure if this is a different
conceptual model  or if it is really different), but anyway, I did not
like it that much.

However my view may be skewed by the fact I spent a  bit more time sitting
behind oracle at uni, than I have behind db2, and that the db2 I was uisng
was connected to an arguably non standard system.
