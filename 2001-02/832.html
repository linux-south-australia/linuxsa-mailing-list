&gt; I'm not denying anything.  The why is simple.  If someone has been hacked
&gt; from an IP  address they will add it to thier hosts.deny file.  By sharing
&gt; this file with other server admins we can help each other stop a hack
&gt; attempt before they get to your server.  The list will be updated as often
&gt; as possible all you have to do is add the list to your hosts.deny file and
&gt; away you go.

Since you are publicising your "deny list" here I wonder if this puts you
under Australian and South Australian jurisdiction.  The reason I wonder
is because you are effectively saying that every IP address on your list
is that of someone who has indulged in some sort of computer crime.  This
could put you at serious risk of libel, or worse.  It may also be a breach
of privacy regulations.  Given recent legal precedents in Germany regarding
material on an Australian web site that breaches German law, I think there
could be a lot of sympathy within Germany that you should face extradition
to Australia should your list be a breach of Australian law.

I think compiling a quality list of rogue IP addresses is a worthwhile project,
but "send me your deny IP addresses" lacks any form of scrutiny or due diligence
and surely borders on criminally negligent.  What happens when somebody sends
you the IP address of www.microsoft.com, or of www.anz.com.au?  The implication
is that you blindly record it, thus causing innocent third parties immeasurable
damage.  You be careful now.
