&gt; IMHO, I think ongoing relationship with AUUG would be good. I personally
&gt; don't see why we shouldn't be separate, and I feel like I'd prefer that, but
&gt; maybe it shuold be persued a little... hmm

It's also worth observing that AUUG and LinuxSA have approximately the
same goals and interests, with LinuxSA being perhaps a little more one-
eyed about flavour of unix (AUUG embraces all flavours; LinuxSA only
shows interest in the free ones), and being more active on an informal
basis.  AUUG is more active on a formal basis, for example its excellent
annual conferences, and its smaller but equally excellent symposia.  I
regret that I was unable to attend the 2nd Open Source Symposium, which
AUUG held here in Adelaide late last year, but I understand that many of
us did go, and that it was a good thing.


AUUG can contribute much to us, and it tries to regularly.  The thing
is that we can contribute to AUUG, too.  AUUG needs local enthusiasm and
local members.  It needs members who will organise local meetings.  It
needs a Geoffrey or a Matthew (splitter! ;-) ).  Why are so few of us
members of AUUG?  Why don't we consider become affiliated with AUUG?
