Quoting "Charles Williams ( CEO ACNS )" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:cwilliams@acns-online.com">cwilliams@acns-online.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; For one the site is a LOT faster.
&gt; For two you have full control of your list still.  It's on your server.
&gt; For three it is not designed for anti-spam but for denying hackers
&gt; access to
&gt; your systems.  It's a way of getting hacker/script kiddie/malcontent IP
&gt; address' and adding them to your hosts.deny file so they can't connect
&gt; to
&gt; your servers.  Thus protecting your servers.
&gt; 
&gt; That's about it for now.  I started it because I am a member of the
&gt; cobalt
&gt; list and lot of folks there have been trying to compile everyone else's
&gt; list's together.  Well, now we just have a centralized location.

What do you need the hosts.deny service for anyway? The only services you should
be running out of inetd is POP3 or perhaps INET, and normally you would deny
"ALL:ALL" and then allow "LOCAL my.domain". Apache doesn't use hosts.deny. SSH
does, but you should be locking that down too. FTP, well we just won't get into
that one.

My point is in /etc/hosts.deny should be "ALL: ALL" and then ALLOW what you want
in, ONLY FROM MACHINES YOU TRUST, eg, your local IP subnet.

Seems like common sense to me.

Darryl

BTW, Most of my servers aren't running any services which use inetd, things like
named, or sendmail. You should be taking the opposite approach to what you are.
Deny everything and then allow what you want allowed. Things like Apache are
what you would want to allow. Things like telnet are what you would want to
deny.
