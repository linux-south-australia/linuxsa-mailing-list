&gt; I'm curious, though, does comm need to use as much memory as diff does?

No.  That's an advantage of presorting.  Diff can need a lot of memory
because when it finds two lines that don't match it needs to read ahead
through one file until it finds the end of the extra lines.  The trouble
is which file has the extra lines?  It needs to read ahead through both,
looking for a match, and to make it more interesting it might be that
*both* files have extra lines (for example when you change lines.)

Comm has a trivial task: When it has two lines that don't match, the
one that is sorted before the other is unique; it prints that line
and compares the next line from that file with the current line from
the other.  It can work with little more memory than it needs to hold
one line, although it probably reserves enough for two lines (one from
each file.)
