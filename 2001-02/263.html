All,

Most all of the installs that I have done have been on Desktop or Server
PC's and I am having problems with XFree86 on a laptop.
I am trying to install Mandrake 7.2 on a Twinhead P79TX Pentium 233. It has
a Trident 2MB Video card so I am trying to use the SVGA X server as the
chipset is listed as supported. I currently have the machine booting
without issuses. X starts but the screen is all blotchy and washed out
looks crap.
There is no real picture at all, its all garbled and looks like its in the
wrong color resolution as every other pixel looks somwhat visable. When I
examine the error.log file from `startx 2&gt; error.log` everything looks like
it has started ok and that video card features have been detected.

However,
I am having a little trouble with the screen. What do I put in the
XF86Config file for the monitor? Anyone had any laptop experciences that
could help with getting X setup on this baby. Could it be the screen colour
depth? I haven't had the time to try every color combination. Am I on the
right track?
