No the reason why this is such a disgrace is because he is one of the
writers of the HSC in computing. The book is as new as it comes, as the
course changed from computing studies last year, to Information, Processes
and Technology, this year.
The book is published by heinemann and written by G.K Powers.

This is why its pretty sag, because its so new!

&gt; Hi Adam,
&gt;
&gt; What year is the book published? The fact that it mentions LANtastic would
&gt; indicate its reasonably old.
&gt; Is your teacher a full time computing teacher? Might need to cut him / her
&gt; some slack, not all of them are enlightened. :-)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I know there's been a discussion about linux in school and in
&gt; workstations,
&gt; but i was quite disgusted when i had to summarize a piece out of my
&gt; computing text book at school. This chapter was on Operating systems,
&gt; Network operating systems was one of the subheadings. What i was totally
&gt; offended by was that not once did it mention Linux OR UNIX as a networking
&gt; OS or server OS. They did mention OS's like Novell, Windows NT (oh of
&gt; course) and LANtastic, but no Linux nor UNIX. Like lets be serious here,
&gt; what kind of OS is windows NT, one tiny lil thing it doesnt like
&gt; it asks for
&gt; you to reboot it 1000 times a day, before the poor little IT tech has to
&gt; come and fix it.
&gt;
&gt; This was only one thing i was quite offended by, there was another, that
&gt; same day. My teacher also offended me about linux too! simply
&gt; because of his
&gt; naivity towards anything but Mac OS or Microshaft products. I was talking
&gt; about cable and how he has his puters all connected up to cable
&gt; at home. He
&gt; was saying how he has a NT workstation running wingate, i then told him
&gt; about my setup, my Linux gateway/server. He was like "A *LINUX*
&gt; server" like
&gt; who would ever use something like that. I then went on to explain to him
&gt; that when he has to reboot his windows NT machine several times a
&gt; day, i can
&gt; leave my very low powered linux server on for months on end without even
&gt; getting close to wanting a reboot. He then uttered some bullshit
&gt; to try and
&gt; convince me NT was better and then told me to sit down as he was about to
&gt; start the lesson.
&gt;
&gt; what a joke!
&gt;
&gt; I must admit, for somethings, windows NT may be the better
&gt; option, but when
&gt; it comes to running a server, nothing can beat the reliability and sheer
&gt; power of LINUX! *roar* :)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, something to have a winge about :)
