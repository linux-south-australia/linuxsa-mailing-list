&gt; &gt; the question was is it possible to run diff on big files without making
&gt; &gt; another program
&gt;
&gt; The answer is yes, of course it is.  As I explained it all depends on how
&gt; different the two files are.  If you have small differences diff will need
&gt; only small amounts of memory, even with infinitely large files.

Not so (at least under RH6.2)... If I have same files which differs only by
extra LF in the end diff tries to load them. So diff not working (or need
special options) this way.

&gt; I still would like to know what you did in perl that worked in a case
where
&gt; diff didn't work.  What was the data?

I doing the same thing as diff do but not loading file into memory. It takes
additional time to process but it works because I can seek through file fast
enough.

It's DNS TLD zone file.
