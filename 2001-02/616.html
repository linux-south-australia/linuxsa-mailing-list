Recently there was a thread on some backup problems being experienced by
a user with reading their tapes. Hopefully some of the people out there
who had some suggestions may be able to help me.

I have a HP DAT24 external scsi tape drive using HP DDS3 tapes.
Originally the system was using a HP DAT8 (DDS2 tapes) external drive.
Both running through the same adaptec scsi card. This is attached to an
HP vectra desktop running RH6.2 operating as the internet gateway, file
server (using samba) and DHCP server.

DAT8 drive seemed to work fine however, we upgraded to the DAT24 by just
shutting down the server and replacing the drive - both using the same
scsi device number on the back of the drive.

The DAT24 responds to commands such as "mt -t /dev/st0 rewind" but gives
autosense errors when given "mt -t /dev/st0 retension". We are using
"tar xvbf 20 /dev/st0 / --exclude [/path/filename}" to backup. However
the drive keeps giving autosense errors and fails on backup at random
files. There is only about 6-8GB of data on the system at present of
which some is being excluded so the tape should be able to hold the
entire data uncompressed. I have tried adding the "z" command to
compress the data but still fails. I have also tried reading all the
documentation supplied by HP and on their site but all suggestions seem
to fail.

Any suggestions of what to try or should we just be returning the drive
to the manufacturer?

TIA

Robert
