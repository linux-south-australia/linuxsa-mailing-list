"As someone else suggested I think an active role in public ediucation
would be good, as think that we would be well served with a
spokesperson/press officer."

Unless I am mistaken - was this 'someone' myself?  Publicity and marketing is crucial - as we have learned the hard way with Micro$oft.  It is the only way to explain why they are so successful with consumers and policy makers.  I think we sometimes underestimate the importance of public relations and marketing.

As for the following - why not model LinuxSA on the common Linux business model?  Free access but services cost.  Such as with Mandrake - if I do not pay for the software then I do not receive services such as installation support, printed documentation, some commercial software, etc.  The Mandrake mailing lists are free.

Voting rights would of course be granted with membership only.

Nothing need change - except that extra services could be provided on top of what is already provided - access to online and physical resources - perhaps some kind of limited technical support via email?

&gt;If we were to charge menbership fees, then I reckon the only thing that
&gt;memebrs should get different from non members is maybe a pin or similar
&gt;low merchandise, preference for any giveaway, or any event and hopefully a
&gt;mebership card(ideally with discounts that we migth negotiate at various
&gt;places - eg bookshops, and hardware suppliers, perhaps isps) and kudos.
&gt;
&gt;I beleive that with that sufficient people would join to keep the
&gt;organisaiton afloat.
