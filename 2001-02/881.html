&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you read the statement I made.  Such problems would occur mostly when
the
&gt; &gt; ISP has a high rate of hackers.
&gt;
&gt; Or one hacker who's hacked one of the ISP's machines.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This issue is being worked on now.  by recording the email address and
IP
&gt; &gt; address of the person submitting the "to be blacklisted" IP and setting
a
&gt; &gt; limit on the number of request needed from unique users we should be
able to
&gt; &gt; keep most to a limit.  Any ideas in this area either?
&gt;
&gt; So, what if 500 people genuinely want to kill some subnet? Your script
&gt; then goes and denies it. Where is an arbitrary limit? I could do
&gt; something like:

Subnet's are not taken. Only IP's.  read the info on the site.  Specifacally
the topics of discussion.

&gt;
&gt; 1) Create 500 fake e-mail addresses
&gt; 2) Start by sending 10 reports
&gt; 3) Check to see if IP is blacklisted
&gt; 4) If not increase until all 500 used
&gt; 5) If not decrease until reports are 0
&gt;
&gt; If I suspect that you're recording e-mail addresses, I go back to step
&gt; one.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Part of this answer is above.  Another thing is that if an ISP wishes to
&gt; &gt; have some IP's removed they must make contact with all people that
reported
&gt; &gt; the IP.  This I believe will prove to be beneficial in that, it may move
&gt; &gt; ISP's to be a bit more diligent in regards to what users do across thier
&gt; &gt; network.  Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Must they? Why? And how? How do you advertise an IP address that is
&gt; going to be banned and NOT tell the ISP? Surely the ISP could manually
&gt; add some IP to their firewall rules, or to hosts.deny and so forth.
&gt; Surely you couldn't say:
This is also on the site.

&gt;
&gt; "We suggest you ban this IP subnet but we won't tell you the subnet.
&gt; Please contact these people..." - but what do you say to the people? I
&gt; got your email address from Deny List Extravaganza but I don't know what
&gt; subnet you reported...
&gt;

Again subnets are not taken at the moment.  And from the response generated
from the topics of discussion on the site, they more than likely will never
be taken.  Thus if someone wants to block a subnet on thier server they must
add the info themselves.


&gt; &gt; mind when looking at the big picture.  The largest problem are NAT's and
&gt; &gt; dial-in connections.  big pain. hehe.
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, I didn't think that my MAC address went over TCP/IP over
&gt; the Internet. I thought that the packets on that layer contained IP
&gt; address and routing information, and TCP headers and the data payload. I
&gt; might be wrong (and I'm feeling lazy and can't be bothered reading the
&gt; book about TCP/IP on my bookshelf)...
&gt;
The MAC is initially in the packet but is dropped along the way most of the
time.  It is not normally needed.  However, you can do a MAC request.  Just
trying to figure out the best way to incorperate this.
