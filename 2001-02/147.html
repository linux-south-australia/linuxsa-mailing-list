It was Mon, Feb 05, 2001 at 10:30:04AM -0800.  Alain Satre spake:
&gt; Recently a few servers which had just been built were broken into with
&gt; the rpc vunerablity in RH6.2, now made very common by the ramen worm.
&gt; We have since patched the machines, and  assumed they were in good
&gt; heath.  Occasionally we still seem to see odd occourences of connections
&gt; to this machine, and I am frankly unable to trust the machine since the
&gt; breakin.  Today I was notified by an admin at another company that there
&gt; were portscans from one of thoes machines, to his servers last night.  I
&gt; can only assume that someone is still able to use our servers for
&gt; malicious useage.  I however find no trace of the common ramen worm
&gt; files, like .poop, so I think this maybe done manually.
&gt; 
&gt; Since we had not had the chance to install countermeasures like
&gt; tripwire, I dont know if files have been changed.  Does anyone know of a
&gt; way to check each rpm install to see if all files are valid?  Or a way
&gt; to compare filesizes across the board to see if files have been
&gt; changed?  Has anyone ever recommended a good UNIX/Linux virus scanner?
&gt; Are they even worth investing in?

# rpm -Va

but if they've stuffed with rpm, or the rpm database - which has been known
to happen - it won't give you accurate results.
