&gt; Hi all
&gt;
&gt; I'm available to help out.
&gt;
&gt; Please let me know the timetable of events.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; what do people think? Any volunteers for coordinating (I can't this

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Why don't we try to piggyback on the Sage-AU conference in July?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I just came back from an AUUG board meeting, and until the minutes
&gt; &gt; &gt; are published I probably cannot confirm that they are interested in
&gt; &gt; &gt; supporting a national install day.  I also cannot confirm that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; name, "Freedom Day," was mentioned. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, I don't know why not.  The minutes give the details, but I can't
&gt; &gt; see any reason not to say what's going to be in them.  I can confirm.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course, that doesn't address Richard's question.  During the
&gt; &gt; meeting, we checked what had been said on the lists so far, and the
&gt; &gt; general feeling was:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  The Installfest should be on the same day all over the country.
&gt; &gt;     I'm  on record for saying that I don't like this solution, but I'm
&gt; &gt;     clearly in the minority, so I'll accept it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  It should be on 18 or 25 August.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As I pointed out, AUUG isn't the only organization interested in the
&gt; &gt; Installfest, so we should all get together and discuss how we're going
&gt; &gt; to organize it.  I do think AUUG is the only organization capable of
&gt; &gt; organizing a nation-wide event, however.  Questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  Who wants to participate?
&gt; &gt; 2.  When should we hold it?
&gt; &gt; 3.  If we do agree to have it on the same day across the country, what
&gt; &gt;     do you think of a live video link?  I suspect we can get some
&gt; &gt;     videoconferencing people to sponsor that sort of thing.
&gt; &gt; 4.  What shall we call it?  I think we should maintain the name
&gt; &gt;     "Installfest" for continuity's sake, but "Freedom Day" has a nice
&gt; &gt;     ring  about it.
