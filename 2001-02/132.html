&gt;Yes, ADSL supports it. Telstra doesn't. This would only be consumer friendly,

Yes...  Telstra seem to be finding it desparately hard to get static 
ip provisioning working, we're beating them up about it (they 
buggered up my own home link, one of the test beds for the Internode 
/ Agile ADSL service, just this afternoon, so I'm back on a modem 
right now - howls of anguish...)

&gt;ISDN will give you a full duplex connection to your regular ISP, if they are a
&gt;regular 56k provider, and you want 64k, normally you can connect as if it's a
&gt;regular 56k dial-in account. If you want more than 64k, then it would be a
&gt;matter of asking your provider for the number of increments of 64 you wish to
&gt;use.

Concur. ISDN using Data-Over-Voice is quite cost effective, and its 
not hard to find ISP's who will support ISDN indial on the same 
dialup price points as 56k indial (well, we do, anyway :) )

&gt;ADSL is asynchronous, which if to be used for a high performance web / email
&gt;server, may not necessarily suit your needs. I've heard from many users there
&gt;are still many bugs with Telstra's ADSL and equipment that it's not really
&gt;worth using at this stage.

[Pedantic point - ADSL is *speed asymmetric*, not *asynchronous* - 
but we know what word you meant :) ]

ADSL is a train wreck internally to Telstra. Just awful. How do they 
maintain this sort of lack of planning and provisioning quality so 
consistently with every single new 'initiative' - and this is for a 
product well over 3 years late!

Anything other than dynamic IP assignment has caused us grief with 
every single service we've provisioned thus far - literally none of 
them have worked without an initial provisioning request, a long 
delay, a fault report, another long delay, denial of any problem in 
some cases, followed by it eventually being made to work.

This is actually a critical issue behind our deferral of ADSL release 
in our own name - we are just not interested in wearing Telstra's 
shocking reputation in this space by unavoidable association (which 
is why they don't have their own static IP offering yet either);

So I'm working on a combination of creative DSL CPE configuration 
overlaid on the Telstra dynamic offering, which generates a static 
address end-to-end for our customers via an interesting sort of 
sleight of hand. The customer visible outcome is an ethernet 
delivered service which delivers via static IP's.

We can do dynamic addressing right now, and that works fine (well, ok 
enough), I'm just sure that almost everyone on this list at least 
will want a static address assignment :) We might wind up launching 
dynamic ahead of static, but I don't expect a lot of takeup on it.

Unfortunately, my preferred router platform remains mysteriously 
absent from the Telstra approved list of CPE devices, so I'm spending 
happy afternoons in international phone calls right now lining up 
alternative CPE devices that can do what I need and which Telstra 
will allow me to connect, to support static addressing. I've found 
the right hardware in theory, I'm just trying to get supply organised 
now.

What I'm cooking up is just so far and away cleaner than Telstra seem 
capable of (even though we'll be doing it over their 'network'), that 
I believe it'll be worth the wait (and my apologies to our beta 
customers who are having to live with the provisioning issues above 
on the existing apology for a static offering that we're running with 
in the meantime via Telstra - this isn't the final product 
configuration).

&gt;  &gt; Bandwidth is a small consideration (128k ISDN), but static IP is very
&gt;  &gt; important
&gt;  &gt; (ie web/mail server with domains to be connected to it)
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest Internode / Agile when they have their ADSL service offerings
&gt;will be providing static IP's upon request to users who require from what I
&gt;have heard. After speaking with Telstra representatives I have learned that
&gt;Telstra are running 2mb FDDI bandwidth links to each DSLAM in every supported
&gt;exchange, which isn't necesarily a bad thing if there are not many 
&gt;users on the
&gt;service, but in Telstra's case, there may be 1000 or more users sharing 2mb
&gt;bandwidth. The other bandwidth consideration is where your node will 
&gt;be located
&gt;in relation to the exchange. The further you are from the exchange, the slower
&gt;your link as it is still running on copper wire.

yes, we'll be offering static IP assignments. On current indications, 
it might require a higher setup fee so we can put in a better DSL 
device, which in turn has enough smarts for us to work around 
Telstras' internal train wrecks, but otherwise it'll be very smooth 
indeed.

Your Telstra representative has his brain busted, FDDI has only one 
speed, 100 megabits per second (and token ring derived half duplex at 
that). So either it's 2mb/s on something else, or 100 MB/s on FDDI 
[hint: It's likely to be neither].

Also because Telstra have so dramatically speed limited what they'll 
offer to customers (directly or via wholesale structures such as we 
use), the speed achieved will be either the stated speed or nothing 
at all.

The ADSL standard Telstra is using is capable of up to 8mb/s 
downstream - and they could choose to configure the gear to 
auto-range up to that speed where possible - but they've chosen to 
speed limit it to 1.5mb/s at best.

Why? Well, I guess they're just making life easier, eh? Got to love 
them, making sure we remain behind the rest of the world as long as 
possible.

In their world, this is probably seen as an advantage - the customer 
experience is consistently mediocre for all customers who can get the 
service at all.

[sorry, having had Telstra f^&* over my home ADSL tonight, I'm in a 
less than civil mood about them. Don't get me started about their 
interest in repairing faults rapidly, either - it's nonexistent, 
we've tried. We have a contractual commitment in terms of time to ack 
a fault and time to repair, but unfortunately the ADSL 'techs' don't 
believe that this contract exists, and run to their own sweet idea of 
fault repair timeframes - and have actually said so when we've 
complained!]


&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; so does ADSL support static IP or not? i have heard its the hardware
&gt;  &gt; that
&gt;  &gt; telstra give to customers, and have heard its adsl that doesnt support
&gt;  &gt; it. so
&gt;  &gt; which is it?
&gt;
&gt;ADSL definantly supports it. Not sure about the hardware, since Telstra have
&gt;had Alcatel specifically design it for them, it is more than likely that they
&gt;have designed it to do that, otherwise it's done on the exchange end.

Telstra's problem IMHO is related to some very bad choices of 
equipment, and some just astonishingly strange choices in terms of 
how they configure it, in respect of the DSL management gear they run 
_internally_ in their network (between your house and our head end 
routers).

Telstra didn't have Alcatel 'design' anything. These are standard 
Alcatel DSLAM units, and  commonly available (though not especially 
great in this application) Shasta PPPoE PVC aggregation units. The 
level of 'design' in this network is very very close to zero.

There are a set of worlds' best practice ways in which a Telco like 
Telstra anywhere else in the world would provide a clean wholesale 
interface to the DSLAM layer in the exchanges. And then there is what 
our Worlds Best Practice local dominant Telco does. Making life 
easier... not.

They've gone to enormous trouble to configure the shasta units in a 
manner which seems purposely designed to annoy us. And, of course, 
any attempts at requesting more flexible configuration has been met 
with the usual complete lack of timely response to such requests. 
Just a case of the usual idea of Telstra responsiveness ('oh yes, we 
might implement that in about a year').

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; On an aside, where do you find ISDN cards to put into a machine to act
&gt;  &gt; as a
&gt;  &gt; router?
&gt;
&gt;Traverse make ISDN cards compatible with linux. I think Leader Computers stock
&gt;a generic ISDN card for approx, $80, not sure if it's linux compatible or
&gt;not .. ??

Certainly I've had lots of positive feedback (including from several 
of our own staff) on the Traverse cards, which support Data over 
Voice nicely as well.

ISDN, if you install it in the 'On Ramp Home Highway' flavour, is 
substantially cheaper than ADSL to run, full duplex, and works 
everywhere. If 64k or 128k that's rock solid (and full duplex) 
appeals, DoV ISDN is really not a bad option [ but me - well, I'm 
hooked on the 1 meg plus rates via ADSL at this point :) ]

Sincere apologies for the delays in our getting our stuff out of the 
door, and thanks for those who are being superhumanly patient about 
it. Best we can do in the face of our friends at Telstra. The good 
news is that we have cracked the code on how to work around their 
sillynesses, I'm just trying to get appropriate CPE gear sourced at 
this point.

Cheers,
Simon
