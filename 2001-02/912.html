&gt; The unfortunate reality is that there are many people using a

&gt; static IP...

It's worse than this.  IETF is pretty committed to making
all host IP addresses dynamic.  The dynamic address does get
a static name, through secure and dynamic DNS.

This is unlike the current ISP's dynamic addresses, where your
DNS name changes when your IP address changes.

And there are few host applications that care if the IP address
changes between host reboots, as long as the host's DNS name
remains the same.

In this environment, it's difficult to see how a list of IP
addresses of 'hacked' machines can stay valid for long.

                ------------------------------------

The real answer to the current hacking problems are simple:

 - the major reactive response is automated system adminstration
    - maintain software
       - Red Hat Network, Novell ZenWorks, etc
       - Linux has an advantage here, because distributions
         have a single package format rather than each package
         needing attended installation.
    - LDAP registries
       - make it hard for an attacker to be anonymous, eg: you
         just can't "create an account".
       - retain configuration information
       - maintain the software packages installed
    - home directories on network file systems or SAN
        - so they are backed-up
        - and changes between backups can be tracked
    - provide protocols, not software
        - use IMAP for mail, etc
        - provide disk using NFS, SMB, iSCSI
        - protocols allow you to deploy a service once, rather
          than once per client software package.
          For example, a change in a version of e-mail client
          doesn't lead to a need to upgrade the mail servers
          and the same server can be used for UNIX, Windows
          Mac and Palm users.

   All of this allows a potentially hacked machine to be rebooted
   from a CD-ROM which reinstalls the OS and the packages the user
   had (which are still configured the same as the user had them).
   Twenty minutes later the hacked machine is back in service.

 - the major proactive response is to prevent programming
   errors leading to high access
    - kill C as a Internet daemon language.  No more buffer overflows,
      the #1 cause of current security bugs.
    - add shades of gray to UNIX's "user/root" duality.  Allow root
      tasks to surrender powers using the "capability" feature.
    - increase the use of code review and other software engineering
      techniques

All this is happening in Linux-land, and faster than it is happening
with Windows.  It just needs to happen sooner.
