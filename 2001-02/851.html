&gt; &gt; This is attractve for large organsitions with many databases and many
&gt; &gt; platforms to supprt. You can usually use the smae code on all with java.
&gt; &gt; BUt this probably is nto an issue for you. However I spsuect tht is part
&gt; &gt; of the reason probalby alarge part of the reason that databse companies
&gt; &gt; like java so much froma marketing perspective and why you see so much
&gt; &gt; java enabled stuff around databases.
&gt; 
&gt; interestingly, this is becoming irrelevant for many organisations -- how
&gt; often do organisations really change their server platform :) The real
&gt; reason is that it's a good language, and it's good for the marketing boys...
&gt; :)

I think one of the original poster's questions was whay was is there so
muuch hoopla about java on db company's websites.

My points above were meant to answer this.

My point is that in  many organisations you will find a variety oiof
desktop/client machines, and being able to develop the app once and runit
on most of those platforms is useful.

Ie I was not really talking about the server.
I was talking about all the things that access the server.

And yes, apart from all that java is a good language imo.
