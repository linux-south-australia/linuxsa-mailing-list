Nick et al:

On the other hand, I with a co-worker concluded that:

1) nPulse took a system down through accidental means
2) nPulse may contain a trojan

Essentially it killed tcpd and somehow caused name resolution to fail.
If it hadn't caused name resolution to fail I would be less suspicious
of it. Here is a likely sequence of events:

1) install nPulse

- on Saturday morning

2) nPulse

- begine running nmap (as its backend)

3) nPulse

- starts to behave suspiciously
- starts scanning ports and attempting to make connections to in.ftpd
and in.telnetd and pop3 and ssh

4) Unknown error

- somehwere DNS goes and it falls back to /etc/hosts
- ssh baulks because it resolves hostname.the.company to the wrong (but
legitimate) IP address
- in addition see (5) for identd

5) TCPD

- somewhere TCPD notices the port scan failures
- TCPD thinks there's a possible breakin and starts denying connections,
including ident which ssh and sendmail uses

6) Result

- no system logins allowed via ftp, telnet, pop or ssh
- name service fails on the machine
- it looks like a broken into system

I intend to take a very, very careful look at the nPulse source and have
a go at seeing whether it's trojan. In addition, nmap itself (well, it
is a port scanner and I can think of more illegitimate uses for it than
legitimate ones) has always been subject to my mind.
