&gt; If it's RedHat, you should be able to get away with something like:
&gt; 
&gt; * rpm -Uvh (the package name)

The only problem with this is that RedHat's RPMs are missing a few
compile-time features (like LDAP routing). I would personally back up
any files you want to keep across the two versions and uninstall old
sendmail before compiling and installing new sendmail.

&gt; And rebuilding the sendmail.cf file in the correct place. I think that
&gt; is /etc/mail/sendmail.cf whilst older version use /etc/sendmail.cf. I
&gt; always forget which version is precompiled to look where so you may take
&gt; an extra 2 or 3 minutes figuring it out. Naturally, the documentation
&gt; should tell you where to put it as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that you say the computer is not connected to the Internet or
&gt; acting as a mail server at the moment I've guessed that you are going to
&gt; have to rebuild the sendmail.cf anyway, hence I would:
&gt; 
&gt; * upgrade SendMail before worrying about how to configure it too much
&gt; * once upgraded, make sure you have access to the Internet and the
&gt; /usr/doc/HOWTO or <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A>

There is also some fantastic documentation available with sendmail.
There's the intro and the Operations guide as well as the README files
spread throughout the sendmail source.

Hope it helps,
Matt
