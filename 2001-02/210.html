&gt;Citing the various free unices and such as viable, reliable and
&gt;easy-to-use alternatives to Windows 2000 and IIS. And I wouldn't even
&gt;dare them to start arguind their IT staff had no idea; I'd turn around
&gt;and then file a claim that not only had they acted without the
&gt;shareholders' best interests in this manner, but they also were
&gt;incompetent in hiring staff...

I tend to agree with most of what you said David, except that in some cases,
the IT staff do have some idea, but theyre locked in a little square box
with MS logos 
stamped all over it.
Granted, I know many businesses/companies/gov. organisations who employ MS
drones, but
(from the employers illinformed point of view anyway) there's no point
employing a Unix expert when all they'll 
be doing is turning the handle on an NT network.  Change needs to happen at
both ends of the 
spectrum, ground level & decision-making level.  I'm doing my level best to
change the ground 
level perceptions, but something really needs to happen at the top of the
ladder as well.
The top-level brass need to be convinced that there's better solutions out
there which will save
so much money, money which they can pour back into R & D and provide better
systems for ppl to work with.

&lt;Ahhh, such fun to dream of the ideal world..........SLAP!.....back to
reality........&gt;

I mean, think of the ridiculous amount spent on licensing Windows & Office
for every PC.
This would more than finance support costs for open source systems, which is
one of the perceived 
"drawbacks" of switching to the opensource environment.

Anyway, theres my 2c worth for the day.........
