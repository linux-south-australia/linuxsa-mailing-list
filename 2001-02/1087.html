&gt; Is anybody still arguing this point?

no. I think it's quite clear that incorporating makes LinuxSA liable for
actions of LinuxSA, rather than individuals being liable. It's also clear
that in cases of negligence or misconduct, the Office Holders could also be
personally liable to the members. Point is that it makes liability
transparent and clear.

Why I think we should incorporate:

o it enables us to make financial transactions without resorting to the
cover of a group like AUUG.
o it enables us to get our own insurance for events we are running.
o it enables us to have an entity to say and do things under, rather than
just being a loosely associated group of people. We will be "LinuxSA Inc"
rather than "a bunch of like-minded individuals who call themselves
LinuxSA".
o it (may) enable companies to claim their contributions to LinuxSA against
tax(?)
o it enables us to actually have a budget for things like InstallFest,
rather than relying on individuals to take the risk (last year it was
effectively me who would have been liable for damages, and David Newall who
footed the bill for a few (not insignificant) things...)
o it enables us to decide somewhat formally in what direction we as a group
want to head -- and indeed, if we want to head anywhere at all...

My experience with InstallFest2000 was that there were certain things that
were made more difficult because of our lack of legal existence. Even
deciding on whether to do it was hard, as there was no formal, somewhat
authoritative leadership.

There's a bunch of other reasons, but I have a feeling that this won't
progress any further until our leaders say something -- yes, no, or we don't
mind either way (but would probably prefer X). Geoffrey? Matthew??? Who
else?????

PS again, I would like to make it clear that I am not taking a dig at our
leaders... I'm just saying maybe it's time to change the way we do things?
I'd very much appreciate it if someone on the organisers list could respond.
Thanks.
