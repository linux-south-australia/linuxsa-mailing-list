&gt; So has anyone done the full Java-based webserver thing yet? I
&gt; remember hearing that Linux was *the platform for enterprise
&gt; Java deployment (sic), but is it actually being used as such?

Full java based web servers are definately avaiable.
I think w3.org has one (it may enve be it's referece server these days -
or at least one of them).

Sun/javasoft also have one.

try www.javasoft.com

I ahve run the w3 one a bit, and did not notice any real difference form
apache, but I was only playigniwth it. ie noether apache or it were loaded
probably no more than a couple of requests a second.

 
&gt; I would have thought that Java is the last thing you want 
&gt; listening for web requests, purely because it is slow. Is this
&gt; a valid assumption, or are they loaded into memory, where they
&gt; run just as fast as any other program?

A java web server is no problem. It is of course already runnning just
like any other daemon server.(as oppsed to a server started via inetd)

Servlets might be aproblem in theory.

There is a high hit (a few secs) when startigna JVM. AN d in theory
servelts need a jvm started avery time they run.

To get around this, servlets I believe are per loaded to overcome the
start up hit of java.

So you shoudl nto noticve any hit becasue of ajve perse.
At leat no worse than perl or any other interpredted language.

And _possibly_ better than other interpreted languages because a ot of
Java jvms with jits cache already translated code blocks, whereas I am
not sure that other interreters eg perl, python, sh do this.
 &gt; 
&gt; And wouldn't the development time be a bit high? Again, I would
&gt; have thought that just writing PHP pages that listen for requests
&gt; (like XML-RPC does) would be much quicker, both in dev time and 
&gt; run-time speed, than running a Java servlet.

Not if you know java.
No longer than perl or any other programming language that you know.

Of course if you dont know it then it will take longer you will need to
learn it but tha tis nto a java problem.

Java is not a slower langauge to develop in than any other langauge,
assuming you know it. In fact I find it quite fast to develop in, it hasa
very rich standard api and there are lots of non sandard apis you can get
if you want. Imo the fact taht is tis OO also contributes to its
development speed. Other might not agree of course.

Also you probably gain a lot in felxibility.

And in the long run you can probably get alot of reuse of code if you
think about what you do before you do it.

Also in enterprise scenarios where you are doing more thatn just servinng
web pages(eg you have oteh standalone aps that access the database), you
would almost certainly be able to use your classes in other
applications.

I think the real advantage of java though might not be revleant in your
case.
Write once run almost anywhere.

This is attractve for large organsitions with many databases and many
platforms to supprt. You can usually use the smae code on all with java.
BUt this probably is nto an issue for you. However I spsuect tht is part
of the reason probalby alarge part of the reason that databse companies
like java so much froma marketing perspective and why you see so much
java enabled stuff around databases.
