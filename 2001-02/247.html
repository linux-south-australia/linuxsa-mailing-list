If the NAT works without problems from the Firewall security, then i 
should be able to access the page.  I think (a little out of my depth 
here, so comments from the more experienced would be appreciated) that 
your firewall may not allow the connection.

Assuming it does, the NAT requires an address alias that forwards the 
packets to the machine with the web pages (this will in turn alias the 
returning packets). You may also need to get the ports set up for this 
too (remember that ports are also where hackers look for an exploitable 
hole in your security).

Well i've pretty much exhausted my little knowledge here, over to the 
more experienced to help out from here.

&gt; Hi Gregory
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for supporting me .
&gt; 
&gt; The Windows98 station should be accessbile from the Web and it should be
&gt; able to access the web, too. ( The user of this box have its own
&gt; homepage on this W98box ;-( )
&gt; 
&gt; So, but how can i configure NAT on the Linuxside ? 
&gt; 
&gt; For example:
&gt; The side witch shows to the Internet has the ip 100.100.100.100.
&gt; the other side shows to the private Network 192.168.0.111 
&gt; 
&gt; The Windowsbox has the IP 192.198.0.100 
&gt; 
&gt; When a request form the Internet is send to the original IP Adress (real
&gt; Adress from ISP)
&gt; 100.100.100.221 the PC with 192.198.0.100 should answer.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that makes it a little more clearer.

&gt;&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I need a little help, how to configure NAT on a SUSE Linuxbox (6.4). 
&gt;&gt; The Linuxbox is also a firewall.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; should be simple
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; A windows98 PC should be accessible from the Internet, but with a
&gt; 
&gt; lokal
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; IP-adress.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; but can u clarify what this means?  are you saying that i should be able
&gt; 
&gt; to access your win98 machine over the web? or did u actually mean the 
&gt; win98 box should be able to access the web via the NAT box?
&gt; 
&gt; with a NAT , generally u should have an internal address for other 
&gt; machines to use and u can also supply DHCP service from the NAT.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; All you need to to is set up the wondows box under the network settings 
&gt; to 'point' to the NAT, including DHCP if needed (WINS should not be 
&gt; required). the NAT should have details on its address etc, then you 
&gt; should be able to use the win98 box to surf.  Test the new config by 
&gt; opening a command session on w98 and 'ping' your NAT address to see it 
&gt; the TCP/IP stack is working and talking to you box (assuming the link 
&gt; layer is ok)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can anybody  tell me want i must do or where i can find infos about it
&gt; 
&gt; ?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Henning
