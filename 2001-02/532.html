Hi Adam,

What year is the book published? The fact that it mentions LANtastic would
indicate its reasonably old. 
Is your teacher a full time computing teacher? Might need to cut him / her
some slack, not all of them are enlightened. :-)

Subject: School Text Book and Teacher.


I know there's been a discussion about linux in school and in workstations,
but i was quite disgusted when i had to summarize a piece out of my
computing text book at school. This chapter was on Operating systems,
Network operating systems was one of the subheadings. What i was totally
offended by was that not once did it mention Linux OR UNIX as a networking
OS or server OS. They did mention OS's like Novell, Windows NT (oh of
course) and LANtastic, but no Linux nor UNIX. Like lets be serious here,
what kind of OS is windows NT, one tiny lil thing it doesnt like it asks for
you to reboot it 1000 times a day, before the poor little IT tech has to
come and fix it.

This was only one thing i was quite offended by, there was another, that
same day. My teacher also offended me about linux too! simply because of his
naivity towards anything but Mac OS or Microshaft products. I was talking
about cable and how he has his puters all connected up to cable at home. He
was saying how he has a NT workstation running wingate, i then told him
about my setup, my Linux gateway/server. He was like "A *LINUX* server" like
who would ever use something like that. I then went on to explain to him
that when he has to reboot his windows NT machine several times a day, i can
leave my very low powered linux server on for months on end without even
getting close to wanting a reboot. He then uttered some bullshit to try and
convince me NT was better and then told me to sit down as he was about to
start the lesson.

what a joke!

I must admit, for somethings, windows NT may be the better option, but when
it comes to running a server, nothing can beat the reliability and sheer
power of LINUX! *roar* :)

Anyway, something to have a winge about :)
