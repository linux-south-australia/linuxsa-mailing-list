Evan!

&gt; So far I have received 5 - for APC , 2 for PCWORLD.

But this isn't a statistically valid sample. You are a university
graduate with a B.Sc and M.Sc (possibly Honours too) and you should have
been taught this in computer science or numerical science.

&gt; I leafed through PCworld one and it highlights particularly firewall setup
&gt; and 'GAMES'.

They are both extraordinarily important subjects. You want games to play
with, and a firewall to make sure the bad guys don't play with you (1).

&gt; I picked up MadDogs RH6.1 for dummies over a year ago, it's ok as far as it
&gt; goes and it certainly got me going, it covers most things to the point of
&gt; getting them going , but falls short in some places, has anyone looked at it.

I have not looked in it. Given that my opinion counts far more than
anyone else's around here (except for a certain "g", but we won't get
into that discussion or "q" might appear too (2))...

&gt; I like to think I'm breaking out of my newbie skin and bordering on Linux
&gt; incompetant. So I was looking for something with a bit more info without
&gt; being overwhelmed any suggestions?

Yikes.

I think I prefer newbies. Newbies have the potential to be competent
whilst Linux incompetents are, well, just incompetent.

&gt; I wasn't sure if these books would be appropriate, so any suggestions are
&gt; appreciated

If you have the money, talk to Richard Sharpe (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:sharpe@ns.aus.com">sharpe@ns.aus.com</A>)
about the courses he runs. Alternatively, you might want to whisper
something to Robyn Manning (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:rmannin@powercom.com.au">rmannin@powercom.com.au</A>) who recently
posted something about a course she will be presenting.

My advice is:

* get whatever book suits you
 - it doesn't matter which one
 - get the one that you can understand

* browse places like Amazon, The Bookshelf, what Geoffrey/Netcraft
brings at LinuxSA meetings
 - and if you see a book whose subject interest you, buy it
 - practice

In the end, it's practice, practice and practice. You can read as much
theory as you want. I can tell you as much as I know - and more - and
trust me I won't stop talking. I essentially would choose a topic, get a
book, muck round with the topic and although I sometimes get the theory
back to front (3) I generally know enough to actually use what tools
I've taught myself.

Hope this helps.

But you always let the good guys (and gals) play games with you :-P

(2)
Star Trek - my advice to you, in Star Trek terms is that if you want to
learn more about Linux, "Make it so!"

(3)
Upside down, inside out or whatever; teaching one's self by experience
and reading isn't the mark of a stupid person in my opinion

P.S.

How come Armageddon didn't happen at the turn of the century? I thought
Nostradamus said it would...
