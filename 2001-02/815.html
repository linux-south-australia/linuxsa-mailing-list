&gt; PHP is a scripting language, Java is a programming language.
&gt; So using PHP for programming tasks wouldn't be a good idea.
&gt; Using Java for scripting tasks is inefficient.

This is the sort of thing I am interesting in looking at now, 
rather than discovering that our chosen technology isn't up to
the job when it starts to crumble. Scalability, scalability,
scalability.

Don't want to go overboard, as we won't have to scale *that
high...probably around 5G of data, 100-200 simultaneous users
(worst case.)

A big factor in what platform we go for is ease of development.
Not like windows-level easy, but we don't want to spend a day 
writing a simple database driven app.
 
&gt; Although writing a PHP page to "listen for" requests might
&gt; appear easier, PHP isn't likely to have the grunt to parse
&gt; the XML, apply business rules and do a series of complex
&gt; database transactions.

That is an interesting topic: I have just written an application
in PHP that did all those things! (Not many business rules though.)

With things like optimizers and now script caching, PHP is
looking better for enterprise stuff. As I said, we won't be
runnning absolutely massive sites, and if we scale our dev
platform up too high we will lock customers out because our
development bill is too high for their small-medium site.

Interestingly, PHP can interface to Java objects, so perhaps
you could use both for different scenarios...write the simple
stuff with PHP, but use Java when it comes to some heavy
duty operations, or if PHP demonstrates that it is not up
to certain tasks.
