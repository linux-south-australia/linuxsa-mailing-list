&gt; Hi all!
&gt;
&gt; I getting multigig gz archives with text files coming to system everyday.
&gt; They almost the same but some lines removed, some added... I have
&gt; BIG DB and contents of DB must be sychronized with these files. Not good
&gt; idea to check whole DB against newly arrived file everyday because it
&gt; takes too long. So I came to idea that using diff on these files and then
&gt; importing these diffs to DB will work better. I skipped part of piping
&gt; gunzip to diff and just tried to run diff on two big files. No matter
&gt; what sort of options I pass to diff but I get "diff: memory exhausted"
&gt; all the time. Now I have workaround for my problem but it still
&gt; interesting is there way to use diff on BIG files?
&gt;

Would comm work for your purposes?  You would probably want to suppress the
duplicate lines.  That is:
   comm -3 file1 file2

You'd be able to see which lines are unique to each file.  Of course, that's
assuming that both files are sorted.  And the output might be a bit more
than what you're looking for.  (output for the above command is two columns:
column 1 shows lines unique to file1, column 2 shows lines unique to file2)

I don't think comm needs to use much memory to run.  I think it only uses as
much as is needed to keep track of where it's at in each file and the
current lines it's comparing.

Being a Linux newbie, however, I could be very, very, very wrong.
