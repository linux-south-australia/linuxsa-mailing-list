&gt; &gt; As a branch from another thread, I'm now curious.  How would
&gt; &gt; those on the list go about overwriting every physical
&gt; &gt; byte/sector of a linux drive/partition, using linux tools?  This
&gt; &gt; is something that is often done in situations involving data of
&gt; &gt; a confidential or secure nature, and I was curious as to the
&gt; &gt; methods that might be used in a linux environment to achieve
&gt; &gt; this action.
&gt; 
&gt; Software can't reliably wipe the previous contents of a hard
&gt; disk drive.  The basic problem is that the drives are reliable,
&gt; and this means that a huge amount of magnetic flux is aligned.
&gt; Because of the scale of this, the previous flux alignments are
&gt; also readily discerible on the drive, although at a few orders
&gt; of magnitude below that used by the heads.
&gt; 
&gt; The usual routine in a confidential environment is to disassemble
&gt; the drive, take a belt sander to the platters, and remove all the
&gt; magnetic coating.  This somewhat lessens the drive's resale value :-)

LOL

Wouldn't it be just as effective & less destructive to dissasemble & zap
the platters with an electromagnetic field several times? Or 
alternatively, wouldn't quick cycling the temperature of the platters be
enough to distort the residual magnetic fields enough to give the
desired result?
