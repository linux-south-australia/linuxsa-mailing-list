&gt; If I have same files which differs only by extra LF in the end diff
&gt; tries to load them. So diff not working (or need special options)
&gt; this way.

I'm having a little difficulty understanding exactly what you mean.
I think you are saying you have two files like the following:


   FILE 1                 FILE 2
   blah blah blah^J       blah blah blah^J
   more blah blah^J       more blah blah^J
   ...                    ...
   another line^J         another line^J
                          ^J

These are identical except for an extra line-terminator at the end of
FILE 2.

On the other hand, perhaps you mean you have two files like this:

   FILE 1                 FILE 2
   blah blah blah^J       blah blah blah^J
   ^J                     more blah blah^J
   more blah blah^J       ...
   ^J                     another line^J
   ...
   ^J
   another line^J
   ^J

The first file is the same as the second, but with blank lines, ie
"extra LF" inserted (after every line).

In the first case the amount of memory needed should be small since the
files are identical right up to the last byte.  An implementation might
choose to buffer some part of each file, for example one line, or as much
as it can, or somewhere in between.  The diff provided with RH7.0 buffers
8k per file.  (In the first case the memory needed would be about 16K.)

In the second case the two files are very different, and the memory needed
depends on how diff resynchronises.  If it requires two matching lines
(in each file) before they are considered to be resynchronised then both
files must fit in memory.

I suspect that you had two files that were like the second case, above.
Those files were really very different.  There's nothing "only" about
an extra LF "on the end" of every line.


&gt;&gt; I still would like to know what you did in perl that worked in a case
&gt;&gt; where diff didn't work.  What was the data?
&gt;
&gt; I doing the same thing as diff

Are you really?  You seem to have some uncertainty about what diff does, and
so I have trouble accepting that you are doing the same thing.  You probably
meant that you are producing the same output.

Did you the read the manual page and see the options relating to comparing
large files with scattered small changes?  Did you try them?  What result
from that?
