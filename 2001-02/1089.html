&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to be building a custom system within the next few weeks in 
&gt; which I will be putting a dual head graphics card. Originally I was 
&gt; going to purchase a Matrox G450 32M but after seing a 3D benchmark 
&gt; between the G450 and the Leadtech Winfast GeForce MX DH Pro, I 
&gt; decided that the Leadtech would be better.
&gt; 
&gt; Although I can find documentation on X windows supporing dual head 
&gt; G400, I cannot fing anything about the G450. Will the G450 work in 
&gt; dual head mode with the G400 drivers in X? Also I cannot find 
&gt; anything about support for the Leadtech in dual head mode. If no DH 
&gt; support exists for this card (or will not be developed in the future) 
&gt; I would prefer not to buy it.
&gt; Can anyone answer any of these questions or point me to a web site 
&gt; which does?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Nathan.

Yes it does. And it does it quite nicely. The 450 drivers are a bit borked though :( but still work.

Did you know that if you took all the economists in the world and lined
them up end to end, they'd still point in the wrong direction?
