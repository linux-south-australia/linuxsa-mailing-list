&gt;I know there's been a discussion about linux in school and in workstations,
&gt;but i was quite disgusted when i had to summarize a piece out of my
&gt;computing text book at school. This chapter was on Operating systems,
&gt;Network operating systems was one of the subheadings. What i was totally
&gt;offended by was that not once did it mention Linux OR UNIX as a networking
&gt;OS or server OS. They did mention OS's like Novell, Windows NT (oh of
&gt;course) and LANtastic, but no Linux nor UNIX. Like lets be serious here,
&gt;what kind of OS is windows NT, one tiny lil thing it doesnt like it asks for
&gt;you to reboot it 1000 times a day, before the poor little IT tech has to
&gt;come and fix it.

The mention of LANtastic suggests that the text is old ...

What school was that, BTW? Perhaps we should send some paper mail to the
school extoling the virtues of Linux and pointing out that the French
education system is using it in a big way, as is the Mexican school system,
etc ...

&gt;This was only one thing i was quite offended by, there was another, that
&gt;same day. My teacher also offended me about linux too! simply because of his
&gt;naivity towards anything but Mac OS or Microshaft products. I was talking
&gt;about cable and how he has his puters all connected up to cable at home. He
&gt;was saying how he has a NT workstation running wingate, i then told him
&gt;about my setup, my Linux gateway/server. He was like "A *LINUX* server" like
&gt;who would ever use something like that. I then went on to explain to him
&gt;that when he has to reboot his windows NT machine several times a day, i can
&gt;leave my very low powered linux server on for months on end without even
&gt;getting close to wanting a reboot. He then uttered some bullshit to try and
&gt;convince me NT was better and then told me to sit down as he was about to
&gt;start the lesson.

It may be that NT does not crash for hime that often, but he most likely
cannot run it with any speed on the sort of low resource machines that
Linux will run on.

&gt;what a joke!
&gt;
&gt;I must admit, for somethings, windows NT may be the better option, but when
&gt;it comes to running a server, nothing can beat the reliability and sheer
&gt;power of LINUX! *roar* :)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, something to have a winge about :)
