Hi,

I'm currently installing a linux server in a public primary school to interface 
with the sa.edu.au SINA internet system.

The point of installing this server is to do SMB, (hence preventing them from 
installing NT), and installing squid to do proxy caching and do all 
authentication against the SINA squid authentication module so that all the 
little kids only have to remember one user name and password, so they just type 
in their windoze login, and they don't neeed to authenticate against a proxy 
server to get web access.

The way the system is installed is as follows:


1 Class C ip address masqueraded to a number of schools.
We dial up to SINA using a Cisco 2600 with an ISDN wik module installed (128k)

we are allocated one class A subnet to work within.

We have installed two network cards in the linux server, one is on the sina 
allocated class A network plugs directly with a crossover cable into the Cisco 
2600 router.  (keeping in mind the router is preconfigured by SINA and we have 
no access into it).

The second network card then runs a 10.1.1.x subnet for the clients to work off.

The router has all it's routing correctly setup. We have internet access from 
the linux box, and all the workstations and samba are talking to the server 
from the other network card.

The only thing we are having troubles with is squid.

Has anyone tryed to get squid to authenticate to another squid server or 
anything similar. If so, we'd love to see some config scripts etc or how you've 
done it !

TIA,
Jeremy
