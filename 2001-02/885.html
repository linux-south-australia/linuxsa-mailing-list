I agree, I'm getting pretty much sick of the whole thing, costs are certainly holding up Australian businesses and, well, IMHO are allowing other parts of the world to leave us further behind. Telstra has a lot to answer for as far as restricting opportunities for competition with other nations in on-line development and offerings.  The other smaller DSL players as just as limited due to that fact.
Update, Agile/Internode still at least a month away as of 20/2/201 when I last spoke to them.
Dingoblue due to announce in 4 weeks their offerings ( I spoke to a DB rep and if what he says is true Dingoblue will once again be the best not only for dial up, but for DSL too)
IPrimus, well enough has been said below.

Note: I think its Alcatel, the DSL card peeps promise to have linux drivers next month. (theregister.co.uk)

Richard!! you have DSL now...who did you end up with?

&gt; I would certainly like to see configuration demonstrations as well as our legal rights.  I have recently decided against signing up with Primus.
&gt;
&gt; They want me to sign a 12 month contract for '1.5Mbs' connection with (at this time unconfirmed) $300 yearly renewal fee at $135 / month.  I think a 12 month contract is unreasonable - 3-4 months would be fine.  I also do not own the modem - I rent it for around $300 / year.
&gt;
&gt; They never got back to me regarding potential price increases over the course of the 12 month contract (considering that I would be required to pay the rest out if I cancel if, say, the connection sucks) or what the yearly renewal fee is.
&gt;
&gt; I am wondering if ADSL is worth the bother at all considering the technology has been available for a very long time now and is much cheaper in other countries ($30 / month in the USA I heard).
&gt;
&gt; When I asked about Linux support or the willingness to provide technical informatiion if required (I made it clear time and time again that I am happy to work things out myself if I just have the right techincal informatin) - Primus literally told me to get stuffed - they told me that I am on my own thank you very much.  All I was asking is if Primus uses standard protocols, set up, etc, and if - I would be fine.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts people?
&gt;
&gt; The were 'reasonable' on one aspect

&gt; &gt;Hi Alex
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; So now might be a good time to ask "Is this talk what you guys want to
&gt; &gt;&gt; see".
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;Yes
