&gt;&gt; I am new to this mailing list (and mailing lists in general).  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ooerr...a newbie to pick on. And he didn't even post his first
&gt; message(s) in HTML...this is just not good enough. How can we possibly
&gt; flame newbies if they post their messages in text? (1)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have
&gt;&gt; sent two messages already but both have appeared in the wrong place in
&gt;&gt; relation to the original message on the LinuxSA web page.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I think the default way the LinuxSA web page displays messages is by
&gt; date. Not thread. So if they won't appear immediately after what they
&gt; relate to. Please be aware that the LinuxSA mailing list occasionally
&gt; does odd things like display answers to questions BEFORE the questions
&gt; and so forth...
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All I did
&gt;&gt; last time was reply to the original message and copied to
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.</A>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; You can:
&gt; 
&gt; * press reply only
&gt; 
&gt; And it goes to the poster of the message
&gt; 
&gt; * reply to all
&gt; 
&gt; And it goes to all the people listed in the to and cc fields
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can someone please let me know the routine for replying to a posted
&gt;&gt; message, before I make a fool of myself again?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you sit in front of your computer. Somehow reply to it (you didn't
&gt; specify what mailer you're using and I can't be bothered about looking
&gt; at your mail headers) and type. You then press send...
&gt; 
&gt; DL
&gt; 
&gt; (1)
&gt; 
&gt; This e-mail is tongue in cheek. Do NOT post messagesd in HTML. The
&gt; easiest way not to is not to use Outlook (Express or otherwise). People
&gt; who use Outlook generally are too stupid to work out how to stop Outlook
&gt; from using HTML (2). It's 40 degrees and I have only one single in wall
&gt; air conditioner and have no idea how I'll pay my electricity bill for
&gt; it...
&gt; 
&gt; (2)
&gt; 
&gt; I said generally, so if you happen to be one of the enlightened ones who
&gt; manage to turn it off don't even think about flaming me...I've
&gt; overstocked on petrol pre price rise and there's more than enough to
&gt; flame you out of existence :-)
