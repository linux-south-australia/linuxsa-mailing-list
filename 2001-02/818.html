SOOOOooooooo its a windows problem, :-)))) I reckon you should be flamed to
death, nothing personal just a good roasting   ;-)))))
Anyways.. When you installed the S3 did you put it on PCI-1 slot? W-blows is
funny if your video card is placed on a PCI slot after other cards, not all
the time but sporadic.  Next, depending on version of windows the realtek
needs updated drivers to work.  I know, I have the same cards on some comps
and could not get them to work without drivers from net.  I still have them
here if you want me to send them to you.

Oh and lastly, S3's  have a habit of using IRQ 10 as default, check W-blows
for V-card IRQ even though it did not tell you there was a conflict.

Ill help you along since you are linux guru and might have trouble with a
flawed, corrupt system ;-)
Press start, - settings- control panel - system icon - device manager -
display adapter - (click card) properties..

Sorry could not resist ;-)

&gt; I have a phantom etherenet problem. Here's the situation:
&gt;
&gt; 1) box is a Linux Mandrake 7.2 install
&gt;
&gt; 2) ethernet card is
&gt; Aug 29 12:54:10 localhost kernel: ne2k-pci.c: PCI NE2000 clone 'RealTek
&gt; RTL-8029' at I/O 0xe400, IRQ 10.
&gt; Aug 29 12:54:10 localhost kernel: eth0: RealTek RTL-8029 found at
&gt; 0xe400, IRQ 10, 00:00:21:E8:11:9C.
&gt;
&gt; 3) used to work under RedHat 6.2
&gt;
&gt; 4) modprobe ne2k-pci will find it
&gt;
&gt; 5) ifup ETH0
&gt;  - I get a "DELAYING" initialisation
&gt;  - no log messages at all
&gt;
&gt; Now I probably should say that I installed Windows and had to change
&gt; over my AGP card for my older S3 Virge (because Windows 98 VI doesn't
&gt; cope with AGP i740 cards) and that Windows recognised the card but
&gt; wouldn't ping to the network either. I ended up having to use a null
&gt; modem connection to play StarCraft.
&gt;
&gt; The only thing that I did that I can think of that would affect it was
&gt; opening the box and adding the S3. There's no obvious hardware conflicts
&gt; or anything at all like that so I'm wondering how one might work out
&gt; what's going wrong...or if anyone else has seen this before.
