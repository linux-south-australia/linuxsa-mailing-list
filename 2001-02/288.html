&gt; As an integrated development environment they are all quite good. They
&gt; seem to hail from the "everything under one box" style; whereas Unix (in
&gt; my opinion) tends to be more of a "lots of specialised tools glued
&gt; together using scripting tools such as bash". In my opinion, pulling
&gt; together:

I don't think this is just your opinion -- I think you would find a lot of
evidence that an _Integrated_ development environment is, in fact,
integrated, whereas the Unix "each tool does one thing well and we combine
them in flexible ways" is, in fact, a lot of tools with glue -- it's the
whole difference between the philosophies...

&gt;
&gt; * glade
&gt; * CVS
&gt; * autoconf and automake
&gt; * bash & PERL
&gt; * X
&gt;
&gt; is an integrated development environment but it doesn't suffer from the

I don't think it's integrated. They may work well together, but they aren't
integrated. Integrated _means_ "everything you need integrated into one
cohesive whole"... The idea of an IDE is that you don't need to leave it.
Sure, you could say that "unix" is an Integrated development environment,
and if you so, I'll just say "whatever" -- it's not an IDE in the
traditional IDE sense... similarly, LaTeX is not a word processor...

&gt; "everything under one box" or for that matter serious licencing issues.
&gt; And, having experienced a little development under both it takes more
&gt; knowledge to use glade et al. but this is knowledge that can actually
&gt; help you understand the program you're writing.

yes.

&gt; People who know how to "program JBuilder" or "program Delphi" don't
&gt; necessarily know how to program. I've come across a few source trees
&gt; that are essentially cobbled together messes.

yes.

&gt; My main point is that I'm not altogether convinced that this "all in
&gt; one" IDE drive (not of the hardware type) is the only way to go.

no, it's not. There are many tools for many jobs. You use a RAD IDE for what
it's good at, and other tools for what they are good at...

&gt; &gt; I know that they are some of the best IDE tools available.
&gt;
&gt; The emphasis is on "some". I'd hazard a guess that I haven't said they
&gt; are "bad" :-)

bloody lawyers.

rr -- having a bad day and being generally grumpy, argumentative and
pedantic in his own special way...
