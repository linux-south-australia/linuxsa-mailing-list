&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I did a port scan, using nmap, of an NT server on my network.  It had four
&gt; ports open -
&gt; 
&gt;   135/tcp    open        loc-srv
&gt;   139/tcp    open        netbios-ssn
&gt;   6667/tcp   open        ?
&gt;   6668/tcp   open        ?
&gt; 
&gt; The ?'s are there because I can't remember what they said - something to do
&gt; with IRC (I believe those ports are commonly used by IRC).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought this was a little strange, considering I don't run any IRC
&gt; servers on my network, and if I did, I sure as hell wouldn't run them on
&gt; NT.  So I telnetted to port 6667 of the server.
&gt; 
&gt; It did this:
&gt; 
&gt;   [<A HREF="mailto:root@medusa">root@medusa</A> /root]# telnet jester 6667
&gt;   Trying 10.1.1.5...
&gt;   Connected to jester.aiew (10.1.1.5).
&gt;   Escape character is '^]'.
&gt; 
&gt; .. and I pressed enter a few times...  then it kicked me off
&gt; 
&gt;   Connection closed by foreign host.
&gt;   [<A HREF="mailto:root@medusa">root@medusa</A> /root]#
&gt; 
&gt; So I rescanned the server - and the ports were closed.
&gt; 
&gt; Both 6667 and 6668 were closed.

If something goes wrong, you can always reboot it. NT servers like to
have a rest every once in a while ;-)

&gt; Should I be worried?  It's in another building, and for some reason, the
&gt; VNC server has stopped working - so I'm going to have to use that age-old
&gt; NT administration tool - the car - to check it out.
&gt; 
&gt; The linux bits of this post are nmap, and I telnetted from a linux box :)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone ever seen these ports opened on an NT server before?

No. Check the task list in task manager for anything out of the
ordinary. We're running NT as a PDC, file server and WINS server and we
don't have any of these ports open.
