Thought you might like to hear my experience moving a Red Hat install 
originally located on a hard drive that was a secondary IDE slave (hdd), but 
now moved to a primary master (hda).

I recently got a old pentium 100 from a friend for some etherboot 
experimentations.  The drive I was going to use in this box was originally 
configured as a secondary slave (hdd) in another machine.  While as 
secondary slave, I installed Red Hat 6.1 server and all it's partitions (/, 
/usr, /home, /var, swap) on the same hard disk.

My problem was that when I moved the hard drive over to the new experimental 
box, all the LILO references pointed to /dev/hdd1 as boot and root devices.  
  This wasn't good, as I had installed the hard drive as a primary master 
(/dev/hda).  Hmmm.  I originally thought that I could simply use the 
"root=/dev/hda1" and "boot=/dev/hda1" command line parameters to my boot 
floppy in order to point LILO to the correct boot and root partitions.  I 
was wrong.

What I forgot about was /etc/fstab.  Fstab keeps all the filesystem 
information for your pc.  So, when I booted into Red Hat with my "boot.." 
and "root.." parameters, Linux gave me a host of errors saying that it 
couldn't find the partition at /dev/hdd1.  /dev/hdd1 was the location of my 
boot and root partitions as they existed in the old machine.  OK.  So all I 
had to do was edit /etc/fstab and change the filesystem references from 
/dev/hdd* to /dev/hda*, right.  Well, when I went to do this, I forgot that 
Linux loads the root partition in read only mode during error conditions.  
What was I to do now?  There must be some way to edit this thing, right?

What helped me out of this jam was that at the LILO boot prompt, you can 
feed in a read-write parameter to LILO.  When my boot floppy got to the LILO 
prompt, here's are the arguments that I sent to LILO in order to allow me to 
edit /etc/fstab:

LILO
boot: boot=/dev/hda1 root=/dev/hda1 rw

The "rw" parameter mounted the root filesystem as read-write, thus giving me 
permission to edit /etc/fstab and change the references from where my Linux 
system was originally installed (/dev/hdd*) to my new installation 
(/dev/hda*).  Once I saved the file and rebooted, all my filesystems came up 
like a charm.  I then was able to go into linuxconf, edit LILO to the 
correct root and boot partitions, and tag the Master Boot Record of the hard 
drive so that I didn't have to boot from a floppy.

now if only my damn Xconfig worked right..

cheers,
scott
