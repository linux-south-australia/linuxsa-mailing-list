Yes I have created a full java-based webserver project!

I used Tomcat 3.1 (also known as jakarta), which is a java application that
processes JSP pages (available from www.apache.org), I connected it to the
Apache Web Server 1.3.12.  
I also connected the JSP's to an EJB server where the EJB's connected to a
threaded Database Connection manager transporting the data to and from the
database via CORBA (if required) to get and save data from an Oracle 8i
database.  I used CORBA (Inprise's Visibroker) as there was a requirement to
be able to connect to several databases simultaneously that were not all
Oracle 8i databases.
The process works well with Apache processing the web requests and passes
any JSP requests through to Tomcat, which then builds and/or submits the
required pages to and from the user.  
I also configured the JSP pages so that they were precompiled which removes
a runtime compilation step. 
The performance is excellent (the backend was a Sun Sparc).
I have also installed the same configuration on a Red Hat 6.2 partition on
my notebook with success, so that I am able to test configurations and code
changes in a small, single environment before uploading it into the Sun
Sparc's Unix environment.

I have had no problems with this infrastructure and find it very tailor-able
to changing needs and load, with no performance issues.

Subject: Java servlets

Hi,

I hear all this talk from Oracle, IBM, et al. about Java-enabled 
databases, and about using Java servlets to 'web-enable' your
databases.

So has anyone done the full Java-based webserver thing yet? I
remember hearing that Linux was *the platform for enterprise
Java deployment (sic), but is it actually being used as such?

I would have thought that Java is the last thing you want 
listening for web requests, purely because it is slow. Is this
a valid assumption, or are they loaded into memory, where they
run just as fast as any other program?

And wouldn't the development time be a bit high? Again, I would
have thought that just writing PHP pages that listen for requests
(like XML-RPC does) would be much quicker, both in dev time and 
run-time speed, than running a Java servlet.

Comments appreciated...I'm wondering whether I have missed a boat, 
and whether everyone else has missed it too.
