How can we remember the programmer heroes of the software revolution?

Or of the Internet revolution?

Already, such heroes as Jon Postel have died.
I think there should be at least a web site somewhere to
remember the contributions of people like him and Werner Icking.

Is there such a thing already?
And which other internet and/or software heroes have died already?

Just an idle thought at 3 a.m. ....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Werner Icking had a big set of info on his home page about
cycling in his city, Bonn (Beethoven's old town).
<A HREF="http://wsv.gmd.de/fahrrad/">http://wsv.gmd.de/fahrrad/</A>
It's ironic that one of the paths he describes on this web-site
has killed him.

PPS. In these days of the Internet and the free software revolution,
there are so many people who now really are heroes, but who
are reachable in a few minutes in a very direct way.
This is something new in history, that so many people can
become really world famous -- _and_ so directly reached by so
many other people. 30 years ago, such people would have been
lucky to get their name in a book, and then you'd be lucky to see them
at a seminar somewhere.
Maybe this answers the riddle of why people write free software
so energetically. How else could you enter into meaningful
communication with so many people and be appreciated and
known by name? Appreciation is worth something!
