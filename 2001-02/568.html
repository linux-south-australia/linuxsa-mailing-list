 &gt; This article is exactly the kind of "give me back my trademark"
 &gt; thing that I was thinking of.
 &gt; And Yl&ouml;nen isn't even dead yet.
 &gt; Now I know that there are differences between the SSH situation
 &gt; and the linux situation, but there is some points of similarity here too.
 
Now you're talking about something totally different.  We began on copyright,
now you're on to trademarks.

The *worst* thing that can happen if a trademark owner gets uppidy is that
you need to change the name of your product (i.e.: Linux would need to be
called something else).

Note, however, that the Linux trademark is already widely licensed, and
its use under those licenses can't be revoked.  Since Linus has posted
an implied license to the linux-kernel mailing list, anyone who obtains
ownership of the trademark later is going to have a very hard time 
in making any current users of it change anything at all.

On a related note:  Copyright, trademarks and patents are totally 
different concepts.  However, any discussion of one invariably leads
to conflation with the other (which is what has happened here:  We
started talking about what happens to copyright after death, then,
with no warning or prompting, the conversation switched to trademarks.
Why?  Don't know).

It's important to remember what they are:

   - Copyright:  
       A government-granted monopoly over the expression of an idea.
       Note that an idea itself can't be copyrighted, only the instantiation
       of it (so you can't copyright the concept of a word processor, but
       you can copyright your implementation of it).  You don't need to
       actively defend your copyright, you can selectively enforce it.

   - Patent:
       A government-granted monopoly over an idea.  Note that the
       implementation of an idea can't be patented, only the idea itself (so
       Apple can't patent Mac OS, but they can patent the idea of using a 
       trash can to represent a file deletion tool, the folder and document
       metaphor, etc).  You don't need to actively defend your patent; you
       can selectively enforce it.

    - Trademark:
       A government-granted monopoly over the use of a particular word, 
       phrase or image in a particular context.  Note that context is 
       important:  You can trademark "Linux" as it applies to operating
       systems, but if Papermate comes up with a pencil which they want
       to call "The Linux Pencil" then your trademark can't stop them.
       If you don't actively defend your trademark, you lose it.

Each of these is treated in a similar way to property (that's why they're
called "Intellectual Property", right?).  This means they can be bought,
sold, transferred, donated, bequeathed (and stolen) just like "real"
property.  Unlike "real" property, though, they can also be "licensed."

If you violate copyright, you need to cease publication of the item which
has caused the violation, or change it enough so that it no longer violates,
or obtain a license from the copyright owner.  If you violate a patent,
you need to cease publication of ANYTHING which embodies any of the ideas
in the patent, or license it from the owner.  If you violate a trademark,
you need to cease publication of anything which offends the trademark,
or obtain a license from the trademark owner.

If you license one of these items (i.e.: obtain the right to use it from
the owner), the conditions of that license are the conditions of your use.
If the owner decides to change the license later, YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF
WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT THOSE CHANGES as long as the original license
remains in force.  So, if you're using some GPL software, and the copyright
owner decides to make it go commercial, YOU have the option of whether 
you'll accept the new license terms or continue to use the old license
terms (commercial licensors get around this by putting life-limiting 
clauses in their licenses, so they can terminate them at any time, thereby
causing the original license to be severed.  The GPL has no such terminating
clauses, it's a perpetual license).

That's why there is no danger whatsoever of any bad stuff happening to
software if someone "big" in the open source community dies.  If Linus
dies and his lawyer wants to make a lot of money for his estate by
commercially licencing the kernel, the trademark, or any patents he
might happen to hold, the existing non-commercial licenses will still
exist, and you will have the option of ignoring the lawyer and continuing
to use and develop products under the auspices of the original licenses.

 &gt; If you transpose the SSH story a bit, I could envisage the heirs of
 &gt; Linus (after the shark attack) 4 years afterwards suing the
 &gt; perpetrators of FreeLinux for using the Linux trademark and
 &gt; harming the shareholder value of the Linux Software Corporation Inc.
 &gt; So, no, I was not just making this up for light entertainment.
 &gt; And by a curious coincidence, Yl&ouml;nen is apparently a Finn!
 &gt; The parallels are eerie.

There are no parallels at all.  The OpenSSH group never received a license
to use the "SSH" trademark.  The trademark owner is simply pointing out
that they've never had any legal right to use that symbol in that context.

In contrast, the owner of the Linux trademark has repeatedly pointed
out that anyone has a right to use that word in that context provided 
they follow his rules.  That's a license.  It can't be overridden later
unless the existing licensees (i.e.: all of us) agree with the new terms.
