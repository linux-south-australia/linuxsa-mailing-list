Yes - please be more explicit in your problem definition.  I'm
inferring that you are attempting to use vi to edit/view two
files simultaneously, as very few other applications that I
know of display "swap file errors when opening files of the
same name" (paraphrased).

If you _are_ using vi, and it _is_ on a linux box, chances are
it's vim[1].  "vi -R filename" opens the file in read only mode,
which doesn't create the swap/lock file (the program "view"
should do this as well, as it's a symlink to vi/vim).

[1]  This probably also applies to vi, but apart from short term
     usage on other 'puters, my vi experience is being rapidly
     swapped out of that working storage I so lovingly call my
     brain.  Fer instance, I'm quite sure traditional vi doesn't
     have Python hooks into its innards, but it's a feature I use
     often enough.
