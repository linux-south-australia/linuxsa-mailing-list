Thanks for the info - I think I will demand some more answers.  I would not normally be so sceptical except that I have emailed the guy something like 5 times politely asking how they are going in relation to my queries and I have not heard squat - that got my alarm bells ringing.

I am wondering if I should wait before signing a 12 month contract to see what alternatives are available or come up.

I will take a look at Agile and see what they can do.  I am very unhappy with the technical support at Primus (where Linux is concerned) and am wondering if another ISP would be better suited.  The only problem is that I have found local ISPs to be very expensive, strict on quotas, etc (in the past) so I have been turned off them also.

I hope Agile can offer what I am after.

&gt;&gt; They want me to sign a 12 month contract for '1.5Mbs' connection with
&gt;&gt; (at this time unconfirmed) $300 yearly renewal fee at $135 / month.
&gt;&gt; I think a 12 month contract is unreasonable - 3-4 months would be fine.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm, I disagree. Telcos really do have some large up-front costs in
&gt;installing this kind of thing. I work for a Telco, and we can spend
&gt;something like $5000 installing a wireless microwave link, and charge
&gt;customers as little as $1500 - a longer contract is just the pay off you
&gt;have to have to a reasonable install fee!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; They never got back to me regarding potential price increases over the
&gt;&gt; course of the 12 month contract (considering that I would be required
&gt;&gt; to pay the rest out if I cancel if, say, the connection sucks) or what
&gt;&gt; the yearly renewal fee is.
&gt;
&gt;Well, I'd ask to see the contract in full. Okay, if you cancel the
&gt;contract because you changed your mind, it's fair that you pay out the
&gt;remaining cash. But if you cancel the contract because Primus have
&gt;failed *their* end of the deal by not supplying the serivce they said
&gt;they would (i.e. the connection sucks) then you'd be in a position to 
&gt;argue that Primus broke the contract, and not you. Have a look at the
&gt;T&C.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am wondering if ADSL is worth the bother at all considering the
&gt;&gt; technology has been available for a very long time now and is much
&gt;&gt; cheaper in other countries ($30 / month in the USA I heard).
&gt;
&gt;Well, Telstra have never been the most rapid of movers, has it? *grin*
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; When I asked about Linux support or the willingness to provide
&gt;&gt; technical informatiion if required (I made it clear time and time
&gt;&gt; again that I am happy to work things out myself if I just have the
&gt;&gt; right techincal informatin) - Primus literally told me to get
&gt;&gt; stuffed - they told me that I am on my own thank you very much.
&gt;
&gt;Well, sometimes they have to do that - make it clear (at a sales level)
&gt;that this is the case - see if you can talk to a tech in support before
&gt;signing up?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any thoughts people?
&gt;
&gt;Otherwise, have a talk to Agile about their ASDL - I've known Simon a
&gt;while, and I'd imagine that their ASDL will be what you need when they
&gt;release it. (No, I don't work for that Telco in Adelaide :-)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
