Vladmir!

&gt; I checked few different modern modems before posting - all of them claim
&gt; that they are Hayes compatible and all of them understand ATW command (I
&gt; didn't compared whole extended set). So statistically "every" modem will do
&gt; so. It really depends on "What can be called Hayes compatible" -
&gt; compatibility with basic command set or compatibility with extended command
&gt; set too.

So if I meet three Russian immigrants who make sweeping generalisations,
I suppose all Russians make sweeping generalisations.

DL

ps.

I know at least 3 Davids who are all wonderful, kind, gentle, diplomatic
people. I am one of them. Maybe all people called David are wonderful
people...

ps to the ps.

My point is that your posting as quoted is, well, to put it in one of
two ways:

1) Statistically inept

Even a Year 12 mathematics student wouldn't make such an inept
statement. You haven't stated how many a few is, or said their brands. I
suppose you've checked the majority of modems that claim they are Hayes
compatible.

2) Troll bait

I was tempted to say "absolutely stupid" or "moronic" but decided that
was impolite. So troll bait it is. What's troll bait? "Deliberately
saying something that is absolutely stupid and/or moronic in order to
elicit even more stupid and/or moronic answers"...

*hmmm*
