David,
One thing I learned at uni is I dont like stats and their validity. It was
a summary of what I received in reply.

I will be honest, if not for games, we wont need half the things that are
coming out. I like games my kids like games, so any help in getting these
games to work under linux is good. 

I recall a certain Star craft player exclaiming their joy in getting SC to
work under wine. :PP

On to more serious matters, sufficient how-tos abound for firewalls etc. I
as yet have no need for them, I setup a simple firewall using ipchains
based on MAdDogs book and it served my purpose I dont profess to understand
the exact syntax of ipchains and it was a while ago. But in the main I also
run a PC firewall under windows which surfices.

I don't always have access to the net and I enjoy reading so I thought
about picking up something a bit  different, I am on a steep learning curve
and I like to take things slowly.

If it bothers you I shall revert back to my newbieness :)

As for the courses, I hate courses unless 
1. They are interstate,
2. paid for by work
3.  and provide lots of free booze and food

So with all due respect to the course holders I don't feel a pressing urge
to attend anything atm. It's just my tinkering and I go off on a number of
tangents as my interest dictates.

&gt;
&gt;Evan!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So far I have received 5 - for APC , 2 for PCWORLD.
&gt;
&gt;But this isn't a statistically valid sample. You are a university
&gt;graduate with a B.Sc and M.Sc (possibly Honours too) and you should have
&gt;been taught this in computer science or numerical science.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I leafed through PCworld one and it highlights particularly firewall setup
&gt;&gt; and 'GAMES'.
&gt;
&gt;They are both extraordinarily important subjects. You want games to play
&gt;with, and a firewall to make sure the bad guys don't play with you (1).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I picked up MadDogs RH6.1 for dummies over a year ago, it's ok as far as it
&gt;&gt; goes and it certainly got me going, it covers most things to the point of
&gt;&gt; getting them going , but falls short in some places, has anyone looked
at it.
&gt;
&gt;I have not looked in it. Given that my opinion counts far more than
&gt;anyone else's around here (except for a certain "g", but we won't get
&gt;into that discussion or "q" might appear too (2))...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I like to think I'm breaking out of my newbie skin and bordering on Linux
&gt;&gt; incompetant. So I was looking for something with a bit more info without
&gt;&gt; being overwhelmed any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Yikes.
&gt;
&gt;I think I prefer newbies. Newbies have the potential to be competent
&gt;whilst Linux incompetents are, well, just incompetent.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I wasn't sure if these books would be appropriate, so any suggestions are
&gt;&gt; appreciated
&gt;
&gt;If you have the money, talk to Richard Sharpe (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:sharpe@ns.aus.com">sharpe@ns.aus.com</A>)
&gt;about the courses he runs. Alternatively, you might want to whisper
&gt;something to Robyn Manning (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:rmannin@powercom.com.au">rmannin@powercom.com.au</A>) who recently
&gt;posted something about a course she will be presenting.
&gt;
&gt;My advice is:
&gt;
&gt;* get whatever book suits you
&gt; - it doesn't matter which one
&gt; - get the one that you can understand
&gt;
&gt;* browse places like Amazon, The Bookshelf, what Geoffrey/Netcraft
&gt;brings at LinuxSA meetings
&gt; - and if you see a book whose subject interest you, buy it
&gt; - practice
&gt;
&gt;In the end, it's practice, practice and practice. You can read as much
&gt;theory as you want. I can tell you as much as I know - and more - and
&gt;trust me I won't stop talking. I essentially would choose a topic, get a
&gt;book, muck round with the topic and although I sometimes get the theory
&gt;back to front (3) I generally know enough to actually use what tools
&gt;I've taught myself.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this helps.
&gt;
&gt;DL
&gt;
&gt;(1)
&gt;But you always let the good guys (and gals) play games with you :-P
&gt;
&gt;(2)
&gt;Star Trek - my advice to you, in Star Trek terms is that if you want to
&gt;learn more about Linux, "Make it so!"
&gt;
&gt;(3)
&gt;Upside down, inside out or whatever; teaching one's self by experience
&gt;and reading isn't the mark of a stupid person in my opinion
&gt;
&gt;P.S.
&gt;
&gt;How come Armageddon didn't happen at the turn of the century? I thought
&gt;Nostradamus said it would...
&gt;
&gt;-- 
&gt;Let's get loud, let's get loud,
&gt;Ain't nobody gonna tell me
&gt;Who I'm allowed to do now...
