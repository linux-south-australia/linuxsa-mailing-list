dan!
to keep things extra simple, head over to <A HREF="http://freesco.org,">http://freesco.org,</A> and get their
floppy based router distro.
it is extreamly limited, but may provide enough functionality to act as
gateway/router between networks. failing that, do a server install of debian or
redhat and you will have a fully functioning router/firewall/web server/ftp
server/mail server/ proxy server. cant gaurentee how well a 486 will hold out
with all that, perhaps just use the proxy to save some bandwidth.
also, of importance, get any/all latest security fixes for your distro of
choice!

Subject: Re: setting up a gateway for a two machine subnet


&gt; Thanks, I'll check this out. The connection is a cable connection, through
Telstra I think. I'm
&gt; quite happy for everything to be console based, I was basically wondering
about the servers
&gt; networking capabilities.

&gt; &gt; IPCHAINS or ipfwadm
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; these two programs do the same thing. ipfwadm is just a later version i
&gt; &gt; guess?
&gt; &gt; This program is used for firewalling and as the name suggests forwarding
&gt; &gt; ip's in a sense.
&gt; &gt; Basically what this program does is when a request is sent from one of the
&gt; &gt; two machines, it registers who it is from, requests the information, and
&gt; &gt; then when received, sends information back to person who asks for it. *by
&gt; &gt; the way this is a kinda newbie way of explaining it*
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; An example of what you would need to run on the linux machine for you to get
&gt; &gt; the system forwarding ip's (masquerading as its called) is the following:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; /sbin/ipchains -A forward 192.0.0.0/24 -j MASQ
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OR
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -P tcp -S 192.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0
&gt; &gt; /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a masquerade -P tcp -S 192.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This will set up a gateway on the linux box. But this will certainly NOT
&gt; &gt; filter any packets, you'll have to read up on that one yourself :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then! in windows, go to the TCP/IP settings for the NIC for the LAN, and put
&gt; &gt; in the IP of the linux machine you have set up as a gateway, in the gateway
&gt; &gt; section. REBOOT, and if you've set everything good, u should have yourself a
&gt; &gt; gateway :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; what can I expect the 486 to support.
&gt; &gt; It will certianly support everything running in the console... well maybe
&gt; &gt; not serving large amounts of data too efficiently, but it will serve as a
&gt; &gt; good gateway for sure!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I dunno about X windows... it may run, but just too slow! :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The subnet will be run off
&gt; &gt; &gt; a dynacally assigned IP (read
&gt; &gt; &gt; between the lines). The 98 machine is involved in serving
&gt; &gt; &gt; streaming data , tha Mac primarily is used
&gt; &gt; &gt; for surfing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Streaming data?? What type of connection would you be using then?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; are you fimilar with dhcp and linux? You'll have to make sure you install a
&gt; &gt; program called dhclient. If using cable/adsl that is, you'll have to run
&gt; &gt; this on startup.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PPP is a totally different story. Dont ask me about that one. :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Good Luck.
