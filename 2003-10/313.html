Hi Brian,

&gt; My sentiments too. The printer is the infamous Canon BJC4550, and it does
&gt; work. It is connected to a Knoppix box on lp0. There are no errors
&gt; in the logs however it will not print at all from knoppix. 
&gt; According to cups the print job is "canceled" on each attempt. However 
&gt; when printing from a networked PC it produces the output described 
&gt; earlier...black page with white text. 
&gt; Me thinks it is hardware related. It has worked ok in the past.

Is the system still in the same configuration as when it worked in the
past ?

Before upgrading hardware, I'd try an alternative to cups (though this
may not be possible if you're limited to the use of Knoppix only).
Try LPRNG (lpd) as the spooler to replace cupsd, & use apsfilter to
setup your printer & install the driver of choice. My thoughts being
that it maybe a foobarred printer filter/driver.
Or also try printing with it plugged into a different box, using
different apps & 'lpr'.

May still be the hardware as you say, but I'll always eliminate the
possibility of software glitches before I lay money down for new
hardware.

If per chance you manage to narrow it down to being a knoppix problem,
then there's always <A HREF="http://www.knoppix.net/forum/">http://www.knoppix.net/forum/</A>

&gt; The MB is an older AT. I have played around with the bios ECP, SPP stuff
&gt; but, that did not change anything.

Best regards,
Rick
