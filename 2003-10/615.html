&gt; Take a deep breath...

&gt; Someone once told me "the difference between the ordinary and the 
&gt; extraordinary, is that little extra" and I am trying to brainstorm a way 
&gt; to help the little extra make its way into Free/Open Source Software.

Yay, there should be more of it.

&gt; So, can we come up with a set of "best practices" that developers should 
&gt; use when contributing software to the Commons?

That's hard, and I can't think of anything useful to contribute, but ...

&gt; I also started to think of a company that would be paid to test the 
&gt; software, kind of like Comsumer Reports. This would be publicly funded, 
&gt; along with another company paid to fix the errors reported by the first 
&gt; company.

Most of what you described and a good deal more is what you'll find
surrounding a packaging effort for any OS serious about its packages.
Debian is the largest and most thorough, Gentoo, ports etc. What I mean
by "surrounding" is that the team putting the package together have gone
through nearly all of what you describe and in many cases documented it
formally or informally -- and often passed the results back to the
original author. 

It is a well-guarded secret (why, I don't know -- too boring?) how much
effort is put in to create quality, consistent packages for a distro
from free packages around the net. If it was within the scope of a
company then Red Hat would have managed it, but as we've seen recently
they have had to acknowledge the job is just too hard/big for them to do
thoroughly, and they've adopted something along the lines of the Debian
model to concentrate on funding their perceived value items. The
commercial incentive isn't there, and the results are at best average
over time.
