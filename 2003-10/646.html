 MS Office 2003 vs Open Source/Open Standards

 Some folks don't like Michael Robertson and even more folks don't like
 Lindows but you cant deny that Microsoft have come up with a very
 nasty piece of work in MS Office 2003. So lets not bother with nasty
 vibes directed to Michael or his product and instead discuss the
 implications of Office 2003 vs Open source that he is bringing to our
 attention.

 "Imagine if a computer virus emerged that secretly attached itself to
 one of the most popular software programs ever. Imagine if the largest
 media outlets unwittingly praised this secret pairing, encouraging
 millions of people to install it. Imagine if none of the major
 antivirus programs would detect it. Imagine if once installed, it
 could alter anything on your computer without your consent or
 knowledge. Imagine if the virus was at the control of a greedy entity
 that has repeatedly trampled on consumers and smaller companies to
 advance its corporate agenda. Imagine if it could force everyone who
 wanted to communicate with you to also carry the virus so it would
 insidiously spread person to person.  Sound like a scary sci-fi plot?
 It's not science fiction. This week MO3 will be released on the 
world."

 Michael discusses all this in his latest 'Michael's Minute'  which can
 be read at <A HREF="http://lindows.com/mm">http://lindows.com/mm</A>

 He also discusses the ability to delete software from connected
 computers running MO3 and refers to this story which sounds like very
 unfriendly MS behaviour to me, 
 <A HREF="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/docs/remotedelete.html">http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/docs/remotedelete.html</A>
 where an X-Box user has had parts and directories of his X-box
 harddrive deleted by Microsoft without any permission or warning from
 MS.

 We of the linux world need to be warning people of the dangers and
 incompatibilities that will arise from the purchase and use of Office
 2003 and future MS products. 

 We need to be telling people about OpenOffice and StarOffice and all
 the other non-MS Office products now available and how they leave the
 future open for continued access to data and files. 

 We need to be telling everybody about open source and why it is good
 business to be able to control your own data and just who knows about
 what you have on your hard drives.

 (We should also note the ability that exists in Michael's Lindows
 Click-N-Run service to access a subscribers hard drive and delete
 programs that no longer are licensed for use etc.)

 Cheers,
 Ian
