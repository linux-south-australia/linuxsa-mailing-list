Here's the response to the Forbes article:

<A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2003101402426OSLL">http://linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2003101402426OSLL</A>

Linux Today asked the Free Software Foundation's Bradley Kuhn if he would like 
a chance to respond to today's piece at Forbes.com. He gave a brief statement 
and permission to post it here:  
 
"Like many articles in the mainstream media, it does not represent any of the 
sides all that well.  
 
"We have an ongoing productive and friendly conversation with CISCO and 
Broadcom regarding their violation. In no violation case have we ever filed a 
law suit, and rarely even get the point to threaten one, because most 
companies feel that it is better for them and their customers to come into 
compliance.  
 
"Companies make a conscious choice to join the GPL'ed world and build their 
products in freedom. They are required in return to respect the communities 
rights, and the characterizations in the article don't point out that it is a 
conscious quid pro quo for companies. Also, Free Software licensing terms 
give much more permissions than any proprietary equivalent that a company 
might base their product on."

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; The article made me so angry. I don't know how such a moron can get a job
&gt; publishing such drivel. It's not uncommon to find that crap on forbes, I've
&gt; seen similar articles before. But this one, is the worst I've seen so far.
&gt;
&gt; Reminds me of Jim Allchin's statement:
&gt;
&gt; "I'm an American, and I believe in doing things the American way".
&gt;
&gt; pfft... a lot of Linux development is done in America by Americans. Oh, but
&gt; even more development is done offshore, therefore it's communist garbage.
