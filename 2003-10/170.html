<H1>Lindows: requirement to have an Internet connection to install applications</H1>

<PRE>
The first thing I will say is that I really don't use Lindows, for 
several reasons, but I do go to the forum to try to help people rsolve 
their problems.

Three issues have come up, and I am not getting a reasonable answer from 
them, so I bring it up here:

1. Unplugging the network cable will slow Lindows down to a crawl! I 
would like to know what would be causing this, and how to stop it.

2. Users are forced to have an Internet connection to install the 
modofied .deb files they downloaded from Lindows.com. I say modified 
because Lindows.com encrypts their .debs after getting them from 
Debian.  I asked him why, and here is some of the dialoh=gue and the 
President of Lindows.com's response:

&gt; kendall,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We have discussed this before, but the powers that be over there 
&gt; should think @ this logically.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 1. Having CD's does not prevent anyone from using Lindows as a 
&gt; "broadband system."
&gt;
&gt; FreeBSD is more of a broadband system then Lindows, you could install 
&gt; from a floppy disk and download all of your applications for FreeBSD 
&gt; over the Internet. But that's not a reason for them to stop making CD's.
&gt;
&gt; Think about it this way, if Mc Donalds suddenly said they were "a 
&gt; vegitarian restaurant" and don't serve hamburgers, that would only 
&gt; eliminate the possible sales they could make.
&gt;
&gt; Its not a real reason.
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, they do say that they are compatable with most modems.
&gt;
&gt; That's not a real reason.
&gt;
&gt; "If you are not able to connect to the Internet at all...then maybe 
&gt; LindowsOS is not the best choice for you? "
&gt;
&gt; So, I am not going to pin this on Kendall, I think that's actually 
&gt; unfair.I thought Keven might step in before and let the blame land 
&gt; where it belongs.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Keven -
&gt;
&gt; What is the real reason why folks have to have an Internet connection 
&gt; to install software your customers legally acquired from Lindows.com ?
&gt;
&gt; Why isn't authentication checked at download time rather than 
&gt; installation time? And why is making your customers have an Internet 
&gt; connection more important than the risk of having to say this:
&gt;
&gt; "If you are not able to connect to the Internet at all...then maybe 
&gt; LindowsOS is not the best choice for you? "
&gt;
&gt; What's the reason?
&gt;
&gt; Is there spyware in Lindows that requires an Internet connection???
&gt;
&gt; Its sure is strange that if my computer does not have its ethernet 
&gt; cord plugged in, Lindows slows to a crawl!
&gt;
&gt; Click and Buy is not a good reason, you already have an auntication 
&gt; code in order to download.
&gt;
&gt; You are blocking yourself out of markets that mostly only have dial 
&gt; up, such as Australia...
&gt;
&gt; Chris has already shown that if you have a valid Lindows license you 
&gt; could take CNR to a few other distributions and just use that, 
&gt; probbaly at risk of system instability, and in a more complicated 
&gt; manner than simply using the application files that come with the 
&gt; distribution
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What's the reason for inconveniencing so many people?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; James Leone


&gt; LindowsOS is designed to work with an Internet connection. Asking CNR 
&gt; to work without a connection is like asking your email client or web 
&gt; browser to work without an internet connection. The entire beauty of 
&gt; CNR is it's ability to do all the software management, deliver 
&gt; products via the net, etc.
&gt;
&gt; A computer without Internet connectivity is about as useful these days 
&gt; as a TV without an antenna.
&gt;
&gt; If you're looking for an OS that not only utilizes the Internet, but 
&gt; LEVERAGES it, then LindowsOS is for you. If you're looking for an OS 
&gt; that doesn't require the Internet, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt; We have no plans of turning LindowsOS into a non-Internet leveraged 
&gt; OS. So if anyone is holding their breath for us to go back to the dark 
&gt; ages of non-digital distribution, I'd suggest you exhale. It's not 
&gt; going to happen.
&gt;
&gt; Kevin 


accept it. if you do not like it use another method to install software. 
lets also agree that MOST of the Lindows users do not care about this 
issue. lets leave Lindows concentrate on the issues affecting majority 
of the users.

Well said Pistooli, and thank you.

There is no big hidden agenda here. We simply believe in the Internet 
and a digital world. Look at all the companies Michael Robertson has 
started...MP3.com, SIPphone, Lindows.com, Sadiesonline.com, etc. ALL of 
them are about DIGITAL distribution via the web. It's what WE believe in 
and DO.

If we sound "pissy" it's because we really do grow weary of people 
coming into our pizza joint and telling us we should serve hanburgers. 
WE ARE ABOUT DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION!

I'm always amazed when supposed "geeks" want to do things the old, slow, 
less-technical way. In my David Spade voice: "It's called the 
'Internet,' look into it."

3. As I read the GPL, it seems that they are in violation of it. The 
president of the company said the following:

&gt; have been through this conversation many-many times. bottom line is 
&gt; that you need a network connection to install programs from CNR. 
&gt; that's the way it is. lets All ppl who purchased Lindows and CNR are 
&gt; legally entitled to distribute the binaries free of charge if they want.
&gt;
&gt; Correct. You are free to distribute the binaries and of course, the 
&gt; source code. However, we are under no obligation to package those 
&gt; binaries in any particular way. Just like .deb's are different from 
&gt; .rpm's, so can OUR binaries be compiled, encrypted, packaged, etc. in 
&gt; any fashion we wish.
&gt;
&gt; Just like you need to use dpkg to install a debian, you have to use 
&gt; CNR to install our packages. The fact that you CAN, under the GPL, 
&gt; distribute the binaries, is the very reason we use our own method of 
&gt; packaging, since we sometimes do distribute proprietary software as 
&gt; well using this same system. Oh, and yes, we ARE trying to run a 
&gt; business here to pay for the 50+ employees who work full time on our 
&gt; CNR service.
&gt;
&gt; So...knock yourselves out. Distribute the binaries and source code to 
&gt; any GPL software you get from Lindows.com. The GPL requires the 
&gt; distribution of binaries and source, but does NOT require you to make 
&gt; available whatever compiler, packager, encryption, etc. you may choose 
&gt; to use.
&gt;
&gt; There will always be the "do it yourself" types (change their own oil 
&gt; in their car, cut their own hair, bottle their own water, grow their 
&gt; own wheat, bake their own bread, etc.). We're not trying to prevent 
&gt; that. But please don't try and limit others who WANT to pay for a 
&gt; service because they are NOT the "do it yourself" type.
&gt;
&gt; Kevin 


Then I said:

&gt; Correct. If you make the Encryption Key source available.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the GPL:
&gt;
&gt; "3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
&gt; under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
&gt; Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
&gt;
&gt; * a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
&gt; source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
&gt; and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
&gt;
&gt; * b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three 
&gt; years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of 
&gt; physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable 
&gt; copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the 
&gt; terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
&gt; software interchange; or,
&gt;
&gt; * c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
&gt; distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed 
&gt; only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the 
&gt; program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in 
&gt; accord with Subsection b above.)
&gt;
&gt; The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
&gt; making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source 
&gt; code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
&gt; associated interface definition files,...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *****plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of 
&gt; the executable*****"

No response from Lindows.com.
