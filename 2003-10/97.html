It's most of the core elements of Linux I want to learn about or at least be
informed enough to know whether I want to learn more.  I don't think I'll ever
contribute to code in the kernel, but using RPMS, X-windows, building &
managing packages etc is realistic.  I also agree $1000s is too expensive,
especially from a users (non professsional) perspective.

The people that seem to get the most from the Hands-On Linux course are
those that are into Systems and Network Admin. That said, there's a
great deal in there that's more generic. You can find a link to the
course outline at <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/index2.html">http://www.iit-training.com.au/index2.html</A> .

This course doesn't show you how to click on a button to get a menu on
the screen and doesn't show you how to use a particular word processor,
but it does go through things like package management, rebuilding the
kernel, security and the various components that make up the graphical
interface (a behind-the-scenes look).

If enough people were interested in a course on the same sorts of
things, I'm sure IIT Training would consider running a series of courses
on particular aspect of Linux that you'd like. Like with any company you
want something from, send a polite wish list of the sorts of things
you'd like to see in a course, as well as the course length, etc, etc
and I'm sure they'll look into it. Nothing may come of it in the really
short term, but you can always ask :-).

thx,
Matt
