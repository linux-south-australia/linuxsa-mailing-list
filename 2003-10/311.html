So,
if it's printing over the network then are you treating it as a 
postscript printer and then rendering onto whatever's native?  If so,
can you capture this output and run it through ghostscript and see if 
it's wrong?

Again,
What ARE you printing? What kind of application?  What happens if you 
print a text file with no formating?  Does it work as expected?

&gt;&gt;Weird,

&gt;My sentiments too. The printer is the infamous Canon BJC4550, and it does
&gt;work. It is connected to a Knoppix box on lp0. There are no errors
&gt;in the logs however it will not print at all from knoppix. 
&gt;According to cups the print job is "canceled" on each attempt. However 
&gt;when printing from a networked PC it produces the output described 
&gt;earlier...black page with white text. 
&gt;Me thinks it is hardware related. It has worked ok in the past. 
&gt;The MB is an older AT. I have played around with the bios ECP, SPP stuff
&gt;but, that did not change anything.

&gt;&gt;(connected to a Solaris server via ethernet). The admin just power cycled the 
&gt;&gt;machine and all was well again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;No idea what was causing it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have come up against a brick wall while trying to diagnose a printing
&gt;&gt;&gt;problem. I am getting a negative of a normal printout i.e. the page is
&gt;&gt;&gt;printing black leaving white text. Hell, I have looked at everything I can
&gt;&gt;&gt;think of....drivers, bios, the printer. Has anyone seen this ? Can you
&gt;&gt;&gt;point me in the right direction ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Thanks
