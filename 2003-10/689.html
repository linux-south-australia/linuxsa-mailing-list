&gt; &gt; I happen to have all of the update packages as well. They'll fit on
&gt; &gt; another CD...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Therefore:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Mandrake 9.2 + updates = 4 CDs
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joseph Tan has them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, cool, maybe I'll still give it a go.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For what it's worth, I can't see anything WRONG with Mandrake 9.2. A
&gt; &gt; few clicks and it's installed (for the most part) and it just
&gt; &gt; started to work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm confident that I could give this to my computer illiterate
&gt; &gt; mother to install and she'd only have to ask me one or two easy to
&gt; &gt; answer questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Except if she has an LG CDROM drive :) I was thinking of giving it to
&gt; my sister to try out, but now I'll have to make sure she doesnt have
&gt; an LG CDROM drive. LG should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a
&gt; drive that could be broken by (non-malicious) software.
&gt; 

Yep that includes me as well.

Even if they are not willing to support Linux, the drives should be
tested to ensure that hardware damage can't happen. Perhaps LG have
rushed some of their product lines to market before giving the design a
good going over?? Perhaps we are going to see window viruses written to
spread and kill LG drives. Are there enough of LG drives around for
someone to be bothered??

Perhaps it will be the last LG I'll be buying..
