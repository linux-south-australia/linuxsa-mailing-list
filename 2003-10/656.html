&gt; (and interesting comments after)

Not really - they're the same comments rehashed whenever this argument
comes up.  And the "this has been fixed in Windows" comment is to larf
- DLLHell still lives on well in 2000 and XP, even amongst Microsoft's
own products (so that comment regarding it being easier coming from
one central vendor is a crock).

I would be nice if (Unix) applications were designed/setup so that
they could use private versions of libraries in case you were unable
to upgrade a system library (i.e. it's being used by something else).
I remember the java startup script used to do some hacking with dynamic
link paths for similar reasons.  At least you can have multiple versions
of Unix libraries - you can't load more than one DLL of the same name
under NT/2K no matter what version (at least, this used to be the case).
