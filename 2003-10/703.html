&gt; That is not security through obscurity, the only reason it's not 
&gt; foolproof is because someone with root access can tamper with 
&gt; the logs 
&gt; and security access on the local machine.
&gt; 
&gt; If you feel this is a poor solution, then what do you suggest as a 
&gt; better one for numerous servers with multiple administrators? You're 
&gt; saying that someone who gives everyone root access immediately with a 
&gt; shared password is more competent than someone who adds a layer of 
&gt; additional per-user authentication?
&gt; 
&gt; Coupled with remote syslog, a per-user system will at least yield 
&gt; 'session opened for user root by bob (uid=1001)' in the security 
&gt; logging. How can you offer any kind of accountability when 
&gt; everything is 
&gt; logged as 'root', an account that multiple people have access to? 
&gt; Tracking back who was on what IP address at what time is never 
&gt; particularly effective or conclusive.

Heya John,

     I never brought security into this.  If you have a look back through
the parent thread at your last email and the last line of your post before
your signature you'll see this "It's by no means foolproof, but like most
security measures it's a good way of keeping honest people honest.".  That
is what you said and I merely added to it thinking you meant what you typed.
It cannot be used as an effective security mechanism.  As far as auditing I
personally would use an auditing piece of software.  My choice is and always
be something similar to sudo.  Do not assume like most people do that sudo
in my intended use is not for security but rather an auditing piece of
software for those people you consider to be honest.  In an environment with
multiple people with root privs, and yes it is quite common I agree, but you
first off should not be giving them root access if they shouldn't have it.
In other words every company takes a said risk when hiring someone.  That
risk may not have high risk value and therefore a person with the lowest
risk (among other criteria I hope) is hired for the position of admin and
given root privs.  You can equate this to security clearances throughout the
world for miscellaneous entities (government, corporations...etc).  So to
make my point I suppose you could say that every person that is given the
privs for root should be trusted at the highest risk factor of the entire
group.  If that entire group drops (or raises) to an unacceptable level than
something has to be done with the weakest link.  I would never put this into
place for security but rather like oops I made a mistake or so in so made a
mistake and now I know why.  In fact sudo in itself if not properly
administrated should automatically be banned.  All a person has to do is be
given sudo privs for vi and it's all over.  You might think of obvious
reasons but just remember that you can run shell commands from vi, and they
don't get tracked so that means !exec $MyFavShellWithoutAHistory.  After
that it is all over and you can't even tell they ran sudo vi.  It should
never be used for a secure purpose.  Auditing is what I would use this
software for and nothing else relevant to this thread.  Policies and
Procedures are what allow companies to stay running therefore like any
department you should have your own policy.  1 person out of the group has
root (most senior) and the rest have sudo "(ALL) ALL" if need be but again
no difference except now it is tracked.
