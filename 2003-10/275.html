On the same subject, after listening to streaming radio on the net I
ended up finding this record label:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.magnatune.com/&gt">http://www.magnatune.com/&gt</A>; "We are not evil"

Same kind of theory, you can download all their music, and then if you
like it you can licence it for a price you think is fair. I hope this
way of doing things catches on more in the future.

&gt; Janis Ian (of 70s hit "At Seventeen" fame), after publishing an article about the free downloading of music files received over 1200 email responses, including:
&gt; 
&gt; 16 offers  to help her convert to Linux,
&gt; 96 offers to help convert her download files from MP3 to Ogg Vorbis and 1 offer of marriage.

&gt; Below is the tail end of the article that elicited such responses:
&gt; 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Free exposure is practically a thing of the past for entertainers. Getting your record played at radio costs more money than most of us dream of ever earning. Free downloading gives a chance to every do-it-yourselfer out there. Every act that can't get signed to a major, for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners, enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts. Where else can a new act, or one that doesn't have a label deal, get that kind of exposure?
&gt; 
&gt; Please note that I am not advocating indiscriminate downloading without the artist's permission. I am not saying copyrights are meaningless. I am objecting to the RIAA spin that they are doing this to protect "the artists", and make us more money. I am annoyed that so many records I once owned are out of print, and the only place I could find them was Napster. Most of all, I'd like to see an end to the hysteria that causes a group like RIAA to spend over 45 million dollars in 2001 lobbying "on our behalf", when every record company out there is complaining that they have no money.
&gt; 
&gt; We'll turn into Microsoft if we're not careful, folks, insisting that any household wanting an extra copy for the car, the kids, or the portable CD player, has to go out and "license" multiple copies.
&gt; 
&gt; As artists, we have the ear of the masses. We have the trust of the masses. By speaking out in our concerts and in the press, we can do a great deal to damp this hysteria, and put the blame for the sad state of our industry right back where it belongs - in the laps of record companies, radio programmers, and our own apparent inability to organize ourselves in order to better our own lives - and those of our fans. If we don't take the reins, no one will.
