Flash: Mandrake Linux 9.2: How to download?

Mandrake Linux 9.2 was released only 7 days ago, but has already 
received many excellent reviews from the world's press. In an early 
review of Mandrake 9.2, the 'Open For Business' website (ofb.biz) 
concluded: "Mandrake Linux 9.2 exhibits a level of refinement that we 
have not previously encountered with a GNU/Linux distribution from any 
developer."

Over 10 Terabytes of Mandrake 9.2 ISO images have been downloaded by
MandrakeClub members so far! This huge payload proves that BitTorrent
technology is a smart choice for delivering large files to a wide audience.

Even still, several members have reported hitting a few snags when 
trying to download the ISOs with BitTorrent. Fortunately, all these 
issues have now been addressed, and a new 'BitTorrent FAQ' has been 
posted with solutions and suggestions:
<A HREF="http://www.mandrakeclub.com/article.php?sid">http://www.mandrakeclub.com/article.php?sid</A>=1302

So, if you're a current Club member and still don't have Mandrake 9.2, 
be sure to read the FAQ and get busy downloading today!

Important note: MandrakeClub Members with 'Silver' membership and above 
can download the first three ISO images from the 9.2 PowerPack, which 
includes many proprietary applications such as Flash Player, RealPlayer, 
Acrobat Reader, Java Runtime Environment, proprietary drivers 
(winmodems, Nvidia, ATI, ADSL) and more.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a pretty disappointing experience in getting Mandrake 9.2 over
&gt; the weekend, even if you are a Mandrake Club member with access to fast
&gt; ADSL. Has anybody managed to download the 3 CD download edition?
&gt; 
&gt; If so would they please it along to LinuxSA Tuesday night? I'll bring a
&gt; laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
