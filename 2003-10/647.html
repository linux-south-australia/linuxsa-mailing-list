&gt;  MS Office 2003 vs Open Source/Open Standards
&gt;
&gt;  Some folks don't like Michael Robertson and even more folks don't like
&gt;  Lindows but you cant deny that Microsoft have come up with a very
&gt;  nasty piece of work in MS Office 2003. So lets not bother with nasty
&gt;  vibes directed to Michael or his product and instead discuss the
&gt;  implications of Office 2003 vs Open source that he is bringing to our
&gt;  attention.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip.



&gt;  He also discusses the ability to delete software from connected
&gt;  computers running MO3 and refers to this story which sounds like very
&gt;  unfriendly MS behaviour to me,
&gt;  <A HREF="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/docs/remotedelete.html">http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/docs/remotedelete.html</A>
&gt;  where an X-Box user has had parts and directories of his X-box
&gt;  harddrive deleted by Microsoft without any permission or warning from
&gt;  MS.

Ian, there is a discussion going on in the Lindows forum re MO3. We're 
trying to get clarification as to what was meant by 'MO3'.

&gt;  We of the linux world need to be warning people of the dangers and
&gt;  incompatibilities that will arise from the purchase and use of Office
&gt;  2003 and future MS products.
&gt;
&gt;  We need to be telling people about OpenOffice and StarOffice and all
&gt;  the other non-MS Office products now available and how they leave the
&gt;  future open for continued access to data and files.
&gt;
&gt;  We need to be telling everybody about open source and why it is good
&gt;  business to be able to control your own data and just who knows about
&gt;  what you have on your hard drives.

All sounds pretty good to me :) I do have to run windows on a couple of PCs 
:( but MS applications like Office and Media Player are banned. OO is great 
and there are plenty of nice alt media players, even in the windows world.

&gt;  (We should also note the ability that exists in Michael's Lindows
&gt;  Click-N-Run service to access a subscribers hard drive and delete
&gt;  programs that no longer are licensed for use etc.)

Ian, you're a bit incorrect on this. Lindows has Click-N-Run and 
Click-N-Buy, which are functionally the same except, of course, you buy 
apps from the latter. The CNB service includes for application developers 
an API which they can OPT to use. This is a piece of code which requires 
the CNB(R) to check with the Lindows servers that the app is currently 
licensed, It doesn't delete anything but it will stop the app working if it 
is not listed as licensed. There is a debate going on at present as to the 
merits of this and the ? of what happens if you are 
disconnected/standalone. PLs note, Lindows have stated they had to work 
with developers to provide a way to stop application theft. THe use of the 
API is opt in however. It is up to the developer.

&gt;  Cheers,
&gt;  Ian
