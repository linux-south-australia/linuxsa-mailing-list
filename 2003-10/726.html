&gt; &gt; I have been running the 2.4.22 kernel for sometime now, but have now
&gt; &gt; changed over to 2.6.0-test9.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It has been compiled with the preemptive option.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am now finding that CPU intensive tasks like bzip2, lame, oggenc, etc
&gt; &gt; are now all running a fair bit slower than what they used to under
&gt; &gt; 2.4.22.
&gt; 
&gt; Ouch.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is this because of the preemptive scheduling, or would you think
&gt; &gt; somthing else is wrong?
&gt; 
&gt; I've used 2.4.22 with and without preemptive scheduling. To be perfectly
&gt; honest, for my usage it didn't appear to make too much of a difference
&gt; either way.

But that was 2.4.22... ?

&gt; I'd be more inclined to take a look at precisely how you've compiled the
&gt; kernel. Also, make sure that your hard drive is using DMA (if it's not,
&gt; then that will slow everything down).
&gt; 
&gt; And seeing you've compiled it yourself (!) ....

Whats the (!) for?
You think that compiling your own kernel is bad thing or somthing?
Its my only option since im running Linux-From-Scratch.

&gt; ... why don't you turn the
&gt; preemptive scheduling off and see whether that makes a difference? If it
&gt; were causing lots of people similar pain, I'm sure it would have been said
&gt; on the linux kernel mailing list [on which I lurk].

Im now running 2.4.0-test9 with preemptive turned off, and everying is back up to speed.

So my original question still stands:

&gt; &gt; If it is because of the preemptive scheduling, im kinda wondering why
&gt; &gt; its being labled as such a big feature of 2.6.0 when obviously it wont
&gt; &gt; suit everyone.

And another:
Its appears to slow down CPU intensive tasks... so what does it speed up?
Ive heard its meant to help with responsiveness, but i didnt see that effect at all, even the opposite.

Mark.
