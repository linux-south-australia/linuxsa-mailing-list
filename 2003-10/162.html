from ny times - subscripion based, so hereya go:

Trial lawyers have watched with increasing interest in recent months as
malicious computer viruses and worms - all exploiting security flaws in
Microsoft software - have crashed computers and networks around the
world. It is only a matter of time, they said, before the class-action
suits against Microsoft start dropping.


 The first came last week, filed in State Superior Court in Los Angeles,
 asserting that Microsoft engaged in unfair business practices and
 violated California consumer protection laws by selling software
 riddled with security flaws. The suit seeks class-action status. More
 such suits are anticipated.


  The litigation, legal experts said, is an effort to use the courts to
  make software subject to product liability law - a burden the industry
  has so far avoided and strenuously resisted.


   "For a software company to be held liable would be a real extension
   of liability as it now stands," said Jeffrey D. Neuburger, a
   technology lawyer at Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner.


    To date, software companies have sidestepped liability suits partly
	by selling customers a license to use their programs - not actual
	ownership - with a lengthy list of caveats and disclaimers. So the
	warranty programs offered by PC makers, for example, cover hardware
	but not software.


	 The industry has argued that software is a highly complex product,
	 often misused or modified by consumers. Assigning responsibility
	 for a failure, the argument goes, would be unfair to any single
	 company.


	  Besides, software executives say, the industry is a fast-changing
	  global business that is largely led by United States companies.
	  Opening the industry up to product liability lawsuits, they say,
	  would chill innovation and undermine the competitiveness of
	  American companies.


	   Yet whether the software industry can remain beyond the reach of
	   product liability is still not certain. The modern economy - from
	   office work to financial markets to power grids - depends
	   increasingly on software. And the trial lawyers are not the only
	   ones who think software makers should face stronger incentives to
	   create products that are more reliable and secure. 


	   Outside of the courthouse, regulations and legislation may also
	   be deployed to prod the industry toward more secure software. A
	   report last year by a National Academy of Sciences panel, made up
	   largely of computer scientists from universities and companies,
	   included the recommendation that "policy makers should consider
	   legislative responses to the failure of existing incentives to
	   cause the market to respond adequately to the security
	   challenge."


	    The debate over software liability seems certain to become more
		intense, computer security experts say, and some shift toward
		holding software makers responsible for defects may be
		inevitable. 


		"The broad issue is, as a matter of policy, do we want suppliers
		of products and systems that are critical to our economy to be
		able to absolve themselves of all liability," said Mark D.
		Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is a senior vice
		president of Solutionary Inc., a computer security firm.


		 But class-action suits against Microsoft over security matters,
		 legal experts say, will be hard-fought and difficult to win.
		 Such cases are trying to break new ground in a way that recent
		 class-action antitrust suits against Microsoft, for example,
		 did not.


		  In the antitrust cases, the class-action plaintiffs filed in
		  the wake of the landmark federal case that found the company
		  was a monopoly that had repeatedly abused its market power.
		  Microsoft has tried to settle its antitrust class actions,
		  including agreeing to pay a $1.1 billion settlement in
		  California earlier this year.


		   Microsoft, by contrast, has suffered no reverses in court
		   that would establish any liability for flawed software. In
		   the current case, it is conceding nothing. Microsoft issued a
		   statement saying that developing the most secure software
		   possible was a top priority for the company.


		    "This complaint misses the point," the Microsoft statement
			added. "The problems caused by viruses and other security
			attacks are the result of criminal acts by the people who
			write viruses."


			 The suit was filed by an experienced product liability
			 lawyer, Dana B. Taschner, on behalf of Marcy Levitas
			 Hamilton, a Los Angeles film editor, and other members of
			 the proposed class.


			  The 19-page complaint is a broad-brush document arguing
			  that Microsoft's Windows operating system, which runs 90
			  percent of all personal computers in the world, is poorly
			  designed, flaw-ridden, and that the company ships software
			  it knows is riddled with security flaws. The complaint
			  adds that Microsoft's system for warning the public of
			  security problems is so confusing and technically complex
			  that it is of little use to the ordinary computer user. 


			  Because of Microsoft's insecure software, the complaint
			  asserts, Ms. Hamilton suffered identity theft - someone
			  obtained unauthorized access to her Social Security number
			  and bank account information, which was stored on her
			  computer.


			   Still, a big hurdle for class-action plaintiffs, legal
			   experts say, will be the standard software license. It is
			   what all computer users see and click to agree to - even
			   if they seldom read it - when they start a new machine or
			   load a new software program. For the plaintiffs to
			   prevail, a judge will have to rule, in effect, that the
			   software license is unenforceable or is overridden by
			   another standard, like the "fit for intended use" rule
			   that applies to most consumer products.


			    Class-action lawyers say they are confident that this
				standard will eventually be applied. "As a matter of
				policy, I think the courts will find that software
				companies have basic obligations to provide a product
				that does what it is supposed to do," said Terry Gross,
				a partner of Gross & Belsky, a firm in San Francisco.
				"And that the companies cannot avoid those obligations
				just because of the language in the license."
