Sounds all good to me. I don't use Mutt or Pine (well, I haven't for ages)
so it didn't even cross my mind (selfish M$ user that I am; no choice at
work, I'm afraid!).

Plain text it is. :)

try reading non plain text in mutt or pine and you will know ;-) html source
code is a bit of a pain to read ;-) kmail also has this effect by 
default but you can turn it off.

There are also security reasons to not open html mail

&gt; 2) Is there a practical reason for not liking HTML emails or is this a 
&gt; 'religious' thing? Seriously, if it actually causes problems I'll be 
&gt; happy to change.
&gt;
&gt; As for Crossover Office, I might give it a go if I can't get 
&gt; everything I need running under WINEX.

&gt; &gt; Have a look at<A HREF="http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere">http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere</A> are lists of 
&gt; &gt; working
&gt;
&gt; apps/games and how he got them to work. Dreamweaver MX is listed. BTW, 
&gt; this is one of the apps I'd like to get working and life is too short 
&gt; - nothing wrong with WYSIWYG at all! Build the page then polish in 
&gt; text mode.
&gt;
&gt; Dreamweaver certainly works, and has for ages.  Consider both 
&gt; commercial versions of Wine if you want maximum compatibility; both 
&gt; Transgaming's WineX for games, and Codeweavers Office for 
&gt; applications.

&gt; &gt; Next thing happened when I tried to load EA Cricket 2002; it came up 
&gt; &gt; with an
&gt;
&gt; error message describing 'evil copy protection'. Now, I felt sure that 
&gt; I had read that WINEX 3.0 had better support for SafeDisc or whatever 
&gt; copy protection EA uses so this puzzled me. So is this as simple a fix 
&gt; as downloading a NOCD patch for Cricket 2002 and installing it? If so, 
&gt; that's interesting that the same facility by which people use to copy 
&gt; games illegally and then get past the copy protection is essential to 
&gt; running games which I bought legally in WINEX.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So, any solutions, people?:-)
