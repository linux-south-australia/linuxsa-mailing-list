Mark,

&gt; It's so freakin' childish.  

What logic do you have when all you can accuse me of as childishness?

Whether we choose to like this or not, I happen to have identified a
legitimate concern that a minority in our western society may have. I
doubt--though I may be wrong--that you have ever experienced the use of
the word in question in a physically or emotionally threatening manner.

&gt; As I look back through the thread history I can't help thinking that
&gt; David Lloyd, Flame Magnet, appears to be the prime mover that started
&gt; pushing the level of discussion from mere adolescence down the slope
&gt; to childishness.

I shall assume that there is no childishness in appending intriguing
appellations to my name. Seriously, someone with your intellect should be
able to invent an appellation far more witty and &lt;G&gt; rated, but I digress.

&gt; Again.
&gt; 
&gt; End of thread.  Please.

Why is it that people accuse me of childishness when I made a perfectly
valid statement in the first place? How about being constructive, as some
others have been, and pointed out such matters as the changing use of
language, the vernacular and usage that pertains to a person's peer group?
How about attempting to pull apart some of the analogies that I posted to
the various lists?

As to these points:

 "That language over time changes."

 Agreed.

 "That changes occur."

 Agreed.

 "That Damian was making no judgments."

 Agreed, but I could launch into a long tirade about why I find the
 usage of the word 'gay' as a synonym of 'pathetic' or 'unworthy'
 offensive [1] but this isn't the time and the place. Anyone who wants to
 talk about that can talk off list.

I'll stack a few of my own in:

 "That members of LinuxSA may point out matters which cause them offence."

 Agreed.

 "That other members of LinuxSA will understand and sympathise with such
  matters."

  This is quite obviously false. It's a big ask and it's not a reflection
  on LinuxSA really.

 "That we should unquestioningly accept all the changes made over time,
  and in this specific instance in language" coupled with "That we should
  be silent about other people's use of language regardless of what
  offence it may cause".

  I am quite prepared to vigorously argue these last two in the
  affirmative if we  would all like me to. Great debater that I am,
  though, I will lose both  propositions unless I have terribly, terribly
  misunderstood the type of  people who happen to be listening to this.

However, what I am prepared to say is that we (as usual) see issues from
two vastly different perspectives. In relation to you, no doubt you have
found what I have said as "childish". From my point of view it is not. I
can live quite happily with this state of affairs.

So, yes, I agree with you: From your (Mark Newton's perspective) what I
(DSL) have said is childish. But if you're willing to so publicly push
your own, personal point of view on this matter, then so am I.

If you've noticed--which no doubt you have--*I* haven't flamed ANYONE in
this thread...


DSL

(1) Mind you, the explanation would come across better in person rather
    than e-mail ;-P
