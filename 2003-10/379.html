there is a lack of information here, and a sad kind of cause an effect.
1) we fix windows, therefore, all must use windows. aunt betty doesnt
know windows OR linux. your logic says that windows is therefore the
best thing for her. meh. ive forgotten how to troubleshoot windows. most
fo my friends now call me for linux help, as they have gleefully
converted after the latest round of nasty virii issues. computerbank
recips use linux. 99% are content - and more than content:) the issues
are rarer - once thigns are setup, all goes relatively smoothly. they
are kind of smug about not getting viruses. they dont decide to clean up
there directory, removing important dlls - cause they cant:))))) the
kids dont lose their essays. all runs relatively well.

relatively - printer compatability bit us recently. the flppy and cd
mounting thing is still a bit of an issue. navigating the dir tree is a
change in head space. but recent distros  like redhat and mandrake are
really making it easier for novices  - both windows refugees and novice
puter types alike.

2) dual boot. must have apps tend to be used less - people find they
have apps that are as good as, or maybe tolerable once used to. or not.
but as its an evolving situation. to dismiss peopel using linux caus eof
one app seems a bit premature:) i advocate it becaus eof the many apps
on teh plus side - and the other pluses like the no crap virus trouble
shooting i mentioned before. goddess, how do you windows types cope with
such a crippleware system?

3) aunt betty is hard to get back on the internet full stop, my friend.
read techcomedy.com sometime. 99% of complaints are about WINDOWS users
trying to get back online and failing. its not about o/s, its about
users. i have equal trouble with windows and linux issues - its about
education and good analogies sometimes:)

and re yr button -- used kde or gnome lately? gak. damn context menues.
or enlightenment. im sticking with fvwm:)
but then, because im runnign linux, I CAN. we have choice in linux land.

&gt; 'And to those poor souls who must use Windows forever, either for job
&gt; reasons or because there is a Windows app they simply must have that
&gt; isn't available for Linux and won't work through either Wine or Win4Lin,
&gt; all I can really say is, "I feel your pain."'
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not going to get wrapped up in a technical discussion as to what
&gt; operating system is 'the best'
&gt; 
&gt; There are a number of reasons why I use Windows.  If I was to choose my
&gt; desktop for purely religious reasons, then I would run Linux or BSD.  I
&gt; am not a religious person, however.  A significant part of my job is to
&gt; support users and networks that run Windows, and the familiarity that
&gt; comes from using it myself for the last 10 years gives me a distinct
&gt; advantage.
&gt; 
&gt; Essentially my job is to fix things that are broken.  If everyone
&gt; switched over to Linux, as you appear to be advocating, then I can't
&gt; tell you how difficult it would be for me (or indeed anyone) to get
&gt; Auntie Betty back on the internet when she had a problem.  It would go
&gt; something like this:
&gt;                                            
&gt; 
&gt; "You can't get on the internet?"
&gt; 
&gt;    "No."
&gt; 
&gt; "OK, could you click the Start button please, then click Settings and
&gt; Control Panel."
&gt; 
&gt;    "I don't have a start button."
&gt; 
&gt; "You don't?  What version of Windows are you running, Mrs Betty?"
&gt; 
&gt;    "I don't have Windows.  My newphew got rid of it last week.  He said
&gt; this was much better"
&gt; 
&gt; "Oh right.  What operating system do you have on your computer"
&gt; 
&gt;    "What's an operating system?"
&gt;                                            
&gt; 
&gt; How are you going to diagnose her problem?  What if Auntie Betty is
&gt; running a Window Manager that you've never seen?  I could go on, but you
&gt; get my point.
&gt; 
&gt; oh, and re: copy/paste?  Try using the right mouse button - context
&gt; menus are something I never saw enough of when running Linux desktops.
