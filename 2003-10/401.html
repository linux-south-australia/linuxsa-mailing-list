 &gt;&gt; "OK, could you click the Start button please, then click 
 &gt;Settings and 
 &gt;&gt; Control Panel."
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt;    "I don't have a start button."
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; "You don't?  What version of Windows are you running, Mrs Betty?"
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;
 &gt;When I did a stint of tech support for an ISP I had several 
 &gt;customers who WERE running windows simply reply "What's a 
 &gt;Start button?"
 &gt;
 &gt;With over 6 billion human beings on the planet you will 
 &gt;always encounter your share of bona-fide morons. These 
 &gt;individuals shouldn't ever be allowed near a computer in the 
 &gt;first place! But hey! It's a free country!  *shrug*

I don't think that's fair.  Just because Auntie Betty isn't interested
in the inner workings of her computer, doesn't mean she shouldn't have
access to email and a web browser (even if she does call her web browser
"the internet")

When Aunt Betty rings up a vendor (ISP, printer, digital camera, etc)
for support, practically speaking, it's only really possible to help her
if she is running Windows.  That is all I'm saying.  I'm not saying it's
a good thing, I'm just saying that's the way it is.

I sincerely hope that this will change, and all the good work that the
open source community does it working towards this.

Still, I find the "omg, if you use windows you must be an idiot"
attitude tiresome.

 &gt;Recent versions of redhat are now even more user friendly in 
 &gt;many ways than windows can ever hope to be. I just installed 
 &gt;a new mobo and all I had to do with redhat was select OK a 
 &gt;few times and it setup ALL the onboard stuff (sound card, 
 &gt;ps/2 mouse etc...) perfectly and effortlessly. Windows 
 &gt;however couldn't setup a single device!
 &gt; I'm still hunting 
 &gt;around for drivers, and then there's the endless reboots!

I find it difficult to believe that your new mobo didn't come with
drivers for Windows...

 &gt;Computers and software, like everything (except M$'s 
 &gt;policies) are constantly evolving. Your arguments become less 
 &gt;valid with every passing day.

I wish they would.
