&gt;  &gt;Some standardisation for configuration tools would, of

&gt; 
&gt; And until they exist on every Aunt Betty's PC, then, IMHO, it is not
&gt; practical to offer her support (unless you limit support to a few,
&gt; recent distributions.)

Well most vendors probably won't officially support *all* linux
distributions, just the ones they think are the most popular. You're
never going to be the situation where every distribution supports the
same configuration tools.

&gt; 
&gt; If Aunt Betty's three year old PC is running RedHat 6.2, how practical
&gt; do you think it would be to get her digital camera up and running?  How
&gt; about that new canon printer she just purchased from Harvey Norman?
&gt; How *practical* (not possible: practical) would it be to have telephone
&gt; support staff available to help her?
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO, not very.

Well most likely the camera box would say that it needs a certain
distro/version of linux (even better just an LSB compliant
distribution :-). Much like newer devices don't support windows 95
anymore.

I think it will be interesting to see whether non technical people
will have very old versions of open source operating systems on their
machines like you see with windows based machines.  Whilst there are
still the technical issues of doing an upgrade (which should be mostly
fixable by the distribution itself), there are less barriers (eg cost,
cpu requirements) to upgrading as compared to windows.
