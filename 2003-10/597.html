Okay so I got WINEX working, no worries. CVS'ed it, configure
--enable-pthreads, make depend && make, make install and the original
wineserver problem ceased to exist. I then had to configure my cdrom drive
in the .wine/config file and point it in the right direction of my c_drive,
no problem; I expected no less. It worked fine with anything which didn't
involve Installshield 6 or above (okay, okay, that's most programs but I'm
getting to that :-)). So I was able to install RtCW and Unreal Tournament
and both worked. REALLY well. VERY impressed with that.

So then when it came to installing any Installshield programs, it fell down.
A Windows-native Stdole32.tbl file was needed I was told. At least the error
was consistent with many programs so that if I solved one, I solved them all
so I was optimistic. I grumbled about having to use a Windows file and
installed it into the system32 folder of the virtual c_drive, adding
"stdole32.tlb" = "native" to the .wine/config file. Suddenly Installshield
works. Yippee. :-)

Okay, new problems; Dreamweaver won't work (shuddap all web-designers; I'm
only trying out a WYSIWYG editor for a friend!). It installs but won't work.
It just freezes when I load the executable with virtually no clue as to what
went wrong. Have to do a bit of research on this one, obviously.

Next thing happened when I tried to load EA Cricket 2002; it came up with an
error message describing 'evil copy protection'. Now, I felt sure that I had
read that WINEX 3.0 had better support for SafeDisc or whatever copy
protection EA uses so this puzzled me. So is this as simple a fix as
downloading a NOCD patch for Cricket 2002 and installing it? If so, that's
interesting that the same facility by which people use to copy games
illegally and then get past the copy protection is essential to running
games which I bought legally in WINEX.

So, any solutions, people?:-)
