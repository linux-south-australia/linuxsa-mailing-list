&gt; 
&gt; I find it difficult to believe that your new mobo didn't come with
&gt; drivers for Windows...

What is believable, and extremely cruel on MS's part, is that if the
mobo swap involves chipset changes, your system will probably bluescreen
on you at the first reboot. There may be ways of resolving that, but
most people don't do this every day, so you land up re-installing and
having to convince the drones in MS licensing activation that you didn't
just install the same license onto a second computer.

This is what irks me the most. There is a presumption of guilt embodied
in the very fact that I have to ask permission to swap my hardware
around if I use a current MS OS.

By comparison, the linux swap hardware story is generally good.
Certainly, you have to try real hard to land up in a non-booting
situation, and there is nil of this guilt trip junk imposed on you in
the process.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;Computers and software, like everything (except M$'s 
&gt;  &gt;policies) are constantly evolving. Your arguments become less 
&gt;  &gt;valid with every passing day.
&gt; 

This must just be a matter of time and marketshare. If everyone was
running linux, I'd bet there would be a downloadable system analysis
tool that would deliver everything that tech support needs to know about
the distro, the ppp settings, the state of the network and serial
devices, etc, etc. It's not hard, and the resulting support would
potentially be much better than the lock-step stuff that is dished up to
the windows world. The tech support people would probably enjoy a chance
to think in their job. :)

&gt; I wish they would.
