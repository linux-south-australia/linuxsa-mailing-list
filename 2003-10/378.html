You clicked on the URL and missed the chars past the comma to the end of the URL.

make sure you get the full URL and it comes up just fine.

And this is just some of what you will read...
"
 China, Japan, and South Korea recently announced that they would work
 together to create a new, Linux-based operating system that would end
 their dependency on Microsoft. 

 In late August, China’s State Council (its governing body) issued a
 proclamation requiring all government ministries to buy only locally
 produced software during their next upgrade cycle. Given the limited
 number of locally produced software titles, the directive seemed more
 symbolic than substantive. That is, until the joint announcement from
 China, Japan, and Korea that they would work together to create a new
 operating system—based on Linux—that would eliminate their dependency
 on Microsoft. In this article, I’ll look at the Asian Linux
 initiatives and how they will affect U.S. and Western companies over
 the next three to five years.
