Hi Corey,

My first question is why are you trying to run RTCW in Wine/Winex, when
it is supported natively under Linux ?

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/wolf/linux/wolf-linux-1.41-3.x86.run">ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/wolf/linux/wolf-linux-1.41-3.x86.run</A>


As far as getting other apps to work, I've had more success with Wine
than Winex. Apart from some DirectX & Installshield support, Winex
always seems to be approx. 2 Wine releases behind in what works.
Speaking from experience only.

It also greatly depends on what the application or game is, as each
(usually) needs to be configured with the right *.dlls (preferably from
a working windows install), via the ~/.wine/config file.

<A HREF="http://www.frankscorner.org/">http://www.frankscorner.org/</A> is THE definitive Wine site to visit for
getting things working. It has some nice Howtos for a lot of popular
apps/games, & the forums are very good also.

Hope it helps,


Regards,
Rick

&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I've been playing around with WINE and WINEX and no matter how hard I
&gt; try, I just can't get the bugger working properly. My only success
&gt; thusfar has been in downloading the latest WINE source and installing
&gt; it, doing a workaround in deleting a .wine-corey folder in /tmp and
&gt; bang, it works......somewhat. Using it I was able to install RTCW and
&gt; run it smoothly (REALLY good). Unfortunately, the keyboard didn't work
&gt; but I figured that was minor tweaking there. VERY little else worked.
&gt; When I ran winecheck, it rated my install at around the 13% mark.
&gt; Weird.
&gt; 
&gt; Worse is WINEX. I CVS'ed the latest version, ran ./configure, make
&gt; depend && make and make install. Then ldconfig. Then I tried to invoke
&gt; winex and got the old '/tmp/.wine-corey/server (something or other):
&gt; does not exist'. Okay I've been here before and when you try to mkdir
&gt; the folders required, you hit the '[insert relevent folder here]: is
&gt; not a socket' error message. Doing some reading, it seems it has
&gt; something to do with the later versions of LibC or something like that
&gt; but this error is as old as April apparently yes the latest CVS
&gt; version of WineX still does this.
&gt; 
&gt; Can someone please point me in the direction of a proven link or give
&gt; me some guidance because I'd really like to get this happening. The
&gt; system I'm running this on is virtually a vanilla RH9, AMD Athlon XP
&gt; 2200, 512Mb RAM, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; 
&gt; Corey.
