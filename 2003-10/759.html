&gt; So, basically, the problem is:
&gt;
&gt; a) ADSL connection from Linux/FreeBSD box works fine.

Yes.

&gt; b) Any machines NAT'ed behind this run god awful slow, or not at all.

No. Any WINDOWS Machines behind the NAT are stuffed. They can ping, they can
view webpages (HTTP listings of aarnet work, google loads on occasion, my
webmail will work), IRC works but is very laggy. Any downloading happens at
about 88 bytes/second then times out after a few minutes. Any Linux based
boxes behind the firewall fly along at 180kB/second. It is not hardware
based as on dual boot systems (doze/nix) Windows is slow, Nix is quick
(tried 6 diff windows machines, 3 with booting into `nix using Knoppix live
or proper dual boot)

&gt; You've tried swapping modems, network cards, machines, changing MTU
settings
&gt; on both Windows/Linux network adapters, all to no avail?

Modem - tried Alcatel SpeedTouch and my DSL-300
Network cards - combinations of 7 different NICs, mostly RealTek based, but
Intel and a few others as well
Machines - 7 machines total, 6 Windows (3 of which were dual booting) and a
dedicated Linux Laptop
MTU settings - 1200, 1412, 1450, 1460, 1492 and 1500 all attempted on the
doze interfaces, the PPP tun interface and the network interface PPP is
running over in any concievable combination. (1460 is the connect.com
suggested MTU).

&gt; I've seen this problem before, but can't remember what the fix was.

I'm sick of seeing this problem and would really appreciate ANY input!

&gt; R

Cheers, Craig.
