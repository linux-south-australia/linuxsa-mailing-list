My advice is to view in operation the unit you're thinking of purchasing.
Not just the model, the actual unit. (An additional benefit of this approach
is that you get the chance to compare different models first-hand). There's
so much variation between individual units, even for the big names, that you
have a fair chance of landing yourself (a brand-spanking new, unseen) one
that will have a defect that:

 a) Doesn't qualify as a defect according to the service agent
 b) Does qualify, but the service agent can't fix it (even though they may
try)[1]
 c) Does qualify, they'll fix that but muck something else up in doing so[2]

I've had either first-hand experience with the above or had colleagues
relate their tales of woe, most disappointingly as often as not even with
"brand name" equipment. The best way to avert disappointment is to examine
your unit first-hand prior to purchase. Once you have a decent monitor in
your possession, it should give you good service provided you follow the
guidelines: avoid heat, direct sunlight, magnetic fields, etc. And I also
take great care to avoid subjecting (crt) monitors to shock - always move
them gently, avoid hard bumps, vibration, etc. According to a recent story,
you should also take steps to prevent Tiddles (the cat) from urinating on
your LCD panel. This doesn't seem to be covered by warranty.

With panels, be sure to check (and compare) the manufacturer's "dead pixel"
policy.

[1] I sent my Philips 20" analogue monitor back twice because the picture
was skewed on one side. Twice it came back with no discernible difference.

[2] A friend recently sent for repair his 21" ViewSonic because of some kind
of sync/colour issue. It got fixed but now the focus is terrible compared to
what it was.
