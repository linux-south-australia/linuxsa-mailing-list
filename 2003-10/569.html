Micael,

Ok you have my attention.

I have three nephews ... that need PCs.
Do you have enough machines for one each plus a dialup server =)

I'm not a student, but want to organise a christmas present
for my brother'n'law as he has enough to worry about as the
kids are hitting highschool next year =)

have you a phone number that we could discuss whats a fair price =)
i can pick from anywhere (i can find =)

what wattage PSU do you need?

cheers,

Kim

&gt; I've got several HP vectra computers plus other assorted
&gt; motherboards, snd/vid cards etc in a garage.
&gt; 
&gt; The HPs are 166MHz MMX boxen mostly with RAM (32M), but no HDD. They
&gt; have both ISA and PCI slots. And USB and onboard snd/video that
&gt; should work fine with linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Nice little MB with a 486DX/100 that would make a nice little ogg
&gt; vorbis player.
&gt; 
&gt; Several PCI ATI Mach 64 vid cards.
&gt; 
&gt; A box of keyboards. (mostly AT plugs).
&gt; 
&gt; A few other cases with misc Pentium MBs inside.
&gt; 
&gt; Offer me whatever you think something is worth to you. 'Course if
&gt; you're a poor student like me you can have it for nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; I need a working ATX PSU, too.
&gt; 
&gt; If it all sits around for much longer, someone can have it all for
&gt; nothing. ("all" being the catch).
