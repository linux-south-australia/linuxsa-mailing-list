I like topics Linux/BSD OSS networking et.al This list covers a huge
range of topics associated with these areas with some real clued in
people to help. Topics like this one have a habit of getting so far up
peoples nose they just look elsewhere for their interests.

There are few good Linux lists, especially of the caliber of LinuxSA.
There are millions chat-rooms, lost-soul lists, hate mail and righteous
indignation shit lists that have covered this in depth and would love to
here from you all.

It does not take much to ruin a list, however, more of this stuff would
certainly move us in that direction.

&gt; Here's a use of the word lame from the Simpsons:
&gt; 
&gt; Black Comedian on TV: "Black guys, we drive a car like this [leans back and 
&gt; looks cool] a do do do doo doo... but white guys, they drive like this [leans 
&gt; forward and screws up face] a ding ding da ding ding..."
&gt; 
&gt; Homer: "hahahahahaha, it's true! We're SO lame!"
&gt; 
&gt; The kids on South Park also use the word "gay" in the context that I did, so 
&gt; it is not a localised meaning of the word.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, the correct term for referring to homosexuals is "queer". As in "Queer 
&gt; eye for the straight guy", and "Queer as folk". Also at Uni, we have "queer 
&gt; space", a place where non-straight people can hang out in comfort and safety.
&gt; 
&gt; The term "gay" has multiple meanings. However, I will acknowledge that in the 
&gt; demographic of this mailing list, it may not be seen that way.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore,
&gt; 
&gt; I hereby apologise for use of the word "gay" in a context you dont like.
&gt; 
&gt; Damien.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your choice.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I learnt something new today 'gay' can also now mean 'lame'. 'Lame' used
&gt; &gt; &gt; to mean you were limping but it obviously has a new meaning now too as
&gt; &gt; &gt; in pathetic, stupid etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Robyn
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually Robyn, I think the lame and pathetic applies to the sad sacks
&gt; &gt; who use the word in that way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lets see - substitute their name in that scsenario - do they like the
&gt; &gt; use of something describing them as an inference of
&gt; &gt; failure/uselessness/'lameness'?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Its pathetic, and I'm shocked to see it here in this forum. I thought
&gt; &gt; there was more intelligence here than that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And anyone who wants to bitch at me for posting this - go ahead. I'm
&gt; &gt; pretty steamed about it, and happy to respond to grumbles accordingly.
