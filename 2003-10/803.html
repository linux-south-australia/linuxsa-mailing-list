&gt; 
&gt; Now that I have your attention, some more level-headed background:
&gt; 
&gt; At the Linux.Conf.Au I'll be presenting a paper about Vinum, a volume
&gt; manager for BSD.  One thing that has never been adequately explained
&gt; is the performance.  There's plenty of "&lt;MyOS&gt; is better than
&gt; &lt;YourOS&gt;" and "&lt;MyVM&gt; is better than &lt;YourVM&gt;" out there, but I
&gt; honestly don't know myself how well they compare.
&gt; 
&gt; For the paper, I'd like to attempt some sort of comparison, both of
&gt; software (and maybe hardware) RAID systems on the same OS platform,
&gt; and also across platforms.  In particular, I'd like to be able to give
&gt; the delegates an incentive to port Vinum to Linux.  On the other hand,
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I want to be scrupulously honest.
&gt; 2.  I don't have much time.
&gt; 
&gt; Both of these goals would be helped if somebody else, preferably with
&gt; a strong Linux background, were to help me with the testing.  If I can
&gt; also get my hands on some state-of-the-art disk hardware for testing,
&gt; that would also be excellent.
&gt; 
&gt; Any takers?

I'm not a taker, but I thought you'd like to know that someone else in 
this group posted a link to a slashdot article about BSD v.s. Linux. 
They conducted very thorough experiments, but I can't recall the 
outcome.  Search slashdot for that research, or maybe the person who 
originally posted the link will do a reost.
