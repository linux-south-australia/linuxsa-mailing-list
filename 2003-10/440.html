Thought this might be interesting for some.

Australia's history will be viewed digitally in the OpenOffice.org 
office suite as part of plans to preserve the quality and accessibility 
of government documents.

The National Archives of Australia (NAA) is using the open source 
software to help store and display archived documents from government 
agencies.

The decision to use OpenOffice.org came last November, at the beginning 
of a project to develop methods for preserving digital records, said 
Perth-based assistant director of digital preservation Simon Davis.

The Agency to Researcher Digital Preservation Project arose from a 
policy change in 2000 which gave the NAA full custody of to-be-retained 
digital records from government agencies.

The project team decided that using proprietary data formats for 
archiving would not ensure files could be opened and replicated on the 
computer systems of the future.

The NAA must archive some documents for 30 years, and the licensing 
costs and IP issues associated with proprietary software were deemed too 
costly.

"Open source is really, really important to us because over time it 
means we can retain data presentation," said Davis.

"Cross platform development is really important, because we can't say 
you must have a Windows machine to access this file [in the archives]. 
Who knows what platform most people will be using in 30 years time? So 
if you have a Linux machine, for example, you should have equal access."

The introduction of OpenOffice.org was helped by the NAA's decision to 
use XML as the format to which digital documents are converted for 
preservation.

Davis said the project team then developed an XML tool for converting 
and viewing archived documents, XENA (XML Electronic Normalising of 
Archives).

Based on open source code libraries, the Java-based GUI tool converts 
documents to XML form.

"It can also render any XML schema it supports, and supports plug-ins to 
help it work with more file types," he said.

Development of XENA has involved writing viewers for many file types, 
including obsolete ones, but OpenOffice.org reduced some of this work.

"We don't use XENA for viewing word [processing, spreadsheet, drawing 
and presentation] documents because we haven't written a viewer that can 
show documents as well as OpenOffice.org," said Davis.

For these documents, XENA creates a basic XML document and adds 
metadata. XENA then sends content to OpenOffice.org, which converts the 
binary data and sends XENA back the XML markup. XENA then "calls" 
OpenOffice.org to display the document, said Davis.

The NAA will soon convert legacy archives via OpenOffice.org's XML 
format, which will be "a significant amount of work", said Davis.

However, while this is the best way to preserve documents at present, 
the NAA was not obliged to use OpenOffice.org forever, he said.

The NAA was "some way off" using OpenOffice.org on their desktop PCs, 
for instance, he said.

"When the next version of [Microsoft] Office is released, the question 
will be how well is XML support documented. Can they say there are the 
300 tags and if you want to manipulate, this is how you do it," he said.

"If Microsoft's XML is fully documented, then great, we might keep them 
and OpenOffice.org both in the digital repository," he said.

The Mitchell, ACT-based secure digital repository houses master copies 
of archived digital documents. The smallest of the four servers in the 
two purpose-built rooms can hold three quarters of a terabyte, according 
to Davis.

To help the NAA's XML strategy, Davis joined the Organization for the 
Advancement of Structured Information Standards' Open Office XML Format 
Technical Committee last year. The Committee consists of companies and 
individuals around the world that communicate via a weekly 
teleconference to further OpenOffice.org's XML capabilities.

"Sun [Microsystems] asked us to get involved. Basically my role is to 
make sure it [the technical developments] suits the NAA, and help 
archival purposes," said Davis.

"We'd hope many software vendors will use OpenOffice.org's XML in the 
future, it's really good being fully documented," he said.

Davis said that before the Agency-to-Researcher project ends "around 
June", the NAA will continue adding to XENA before making it available 
for download under the GPL "sometime before Christmas". The application 
would be of benefit to archival institutions, as well as private 
companies, around the world, he said.

Davis estimated the general public would have to wait about five years 
until archives in OpenOffice.org format would be available via the NAA's 
Web site.





Cheers,
David Creed
