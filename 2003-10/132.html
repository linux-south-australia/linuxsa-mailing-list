&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to setup a gateway today. I want to do it myself though, not
&gt; use something like Smoothwall etc. I have the gateway box all ready,
&gt; just installed Debian and configured the NICs etc. The thing that i
&gt; have never been able to find is just a simple guide to setting up a
&gt; gateway, without going into firewall settings and all that etc. Well
&gt; there was on i was reading the other day for 2.2 kernel but it didn't
&gt; work, even though i followed the steps correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically i just want to get internet connectivity through the gateway
&gt; for other computers on my LAN as fast as possible. I know how to
&gt; configure the clients, just not the actual gateway. I will read about
&gt; iptables and all that later, i just need the internet first, as i
&gt; don't want to spend 3 days reading a book until i get it all going.

Seems a bit irresponsible but hey...

&gt; So yeah, just what steps and stuff do i need to get it working. By the
&gt; way i want to use DHCP.

echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Then point all of your other computers at that machine for their
default route.  You'll then be able to get out provided you are
connected as you say in your first paragraph.
