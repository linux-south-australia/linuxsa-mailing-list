Hmmm...

&gt; The kids on South Park also use the word "gay" in the context that I
&gt; did, so it is not a localised meaning of the word.

Seinfeld, The Simpons and South Park. All American television shows, all
very popular. So is Days of Our Lives...

&gt; Also, the correct term for referring to homosexuals is "queer". As in
&gt; "Queer eye for the straight guy", and "Queer as folk". Also at Uni, we
&gt; have "queer space", a place where non-straight people can hang out in
&gt; comfort and safety.

Is it now? Some people in the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender community
[which, by the way, is the current "in vogue politically correct way in
Adelaide to talk about the community you're talking about] dislike the
appellation "Queer". "Queer" was invented at about the time when the male
and female not-heterosexual populations decided that they should really
work together and not be separatists. It was also invented by crazy,
left-wing members of the GLBT community. University Students and their
associations seem to adore the term. Commercial TV shows will use it
because it's more sexy than the "Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Eye for
the Straight Guy" ;-P

Personally, the term "Queer" stinks, it's wrong and I don't like it.

&gt; The term "gay" has multiple meanings. However, I will acknowledge that
&gt; in the demographic of this mailing list, it may not be seen that way.

There you go, you've assumed that I didn't understand how you meant it in
the first place. That is a dangerous, and incorrect, assumption.
Assumptions will get you in trouble ;-P You could, if you wanted, invite
me [off list] to explain in more detail why I dislike that particular use
of this particular word...

But as it stands, that is an illogical statement to make and what's worse
it's irrelevant to our discussion.

&gt; Therefore,
&gt; 
&gt; I hereby apologise for use of the word "gay" in a context you dont like.

Oh, they are graciously accepted...

&gt; P.S: On posts like that your sig should be:
&gt; 
&gt; r&gt;:|

Really?

;-P
