Davina,

&gt; Brenda,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically, it's apt he is bagging compared to FreeBSD's ports. He says
&gt; &gt; Debian takes too long, longer than FreeBSD, to release packages as
&gt; &gt; stable.
&gt;
&gt; Debian takes a significant amount of time to produce a release that is
&gt; called "STABLE". This does not mean that those released in "UNSTABLE" are
&gt; actually, well unusable and/or unstable. An analogy might be: there is a
&gt; verb form in Ancient Egyptian which by tradition is called "the
&gt; infinitive" but it has nothing at all to do with what English or German
&gt; would term an infinitive.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; But i thought Debian would be faster than FreeBSD as there's a
&gt; &gt; larger userbase and more people working on and testing packages etc.
&gt;
&gt; There are thousands of more packages in Debian's apt repository. Also what
&gt; is allowed in and out of the Debian apt repository and the ports
&gt; collection is allowed under different philosophies.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I know FreeBSD has a stable development aswell as bleeding edge don't
&gt; &gt; they? Same as Debian? So, is there any real difference between packages
&gt; &gt; released for both OSs... as in newness and stability etc?
&gt;
&gt; Well, yes. One set of packages is for Debian and the other for FreeBSD.

Obviously. But i'm talking about cross-platform packages. Like Apache, PHP,
etc - well anything that runs on Linux will run on most UNIXs won't it?

&gt; However, if I may be serious for a while, this is a pernnial question. The
&gt; best answer is:
&gt;
&gt;  1. Test BOTH
&gt;  2. Whichever satisifies YOUR needs the best is obviously the best one for
&gt;     you

I know this. But I was simply asking generally whether Debian releases
packages before or after FreeBSD. As in, does Debian take longer usually to
release a package under stable as FreeBSD does under their version of
stable - when comparing the same package, like Apache for example. Even
though they may be released under different rules, was this person right in
saying that FreeBSD releases packages as stable before Debian?

&gt; (2) may change as time goes on.
