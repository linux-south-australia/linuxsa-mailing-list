&gt; I have been running the 2.4.22 kernel for sometime now, but have now changed over to
&gt; 2.6.0-test9.
&gt; It has been compiled with the preemptive option.
I've been running the 2.6-test8 kernel for a couple of days now, also in
preemptive mode. I find that on a single cpu machine (P4 2.4 GHz) the
desktop is slightly more responsive, though that may not be due to
preemptiveness. On a dual cpu machine (Dual P3-500) there doesn't seem
to be much improvment in terms of noticable speed. I have noticed that
CPU loading seems more consistant than on 2.4 so perhaps the scheduler
has improved.

&gt; I am now finding that CPU intensive tasks like bzip2, lame, oggenc, etc are now all running
&gt; a fair bit slower than what they used to under 2.4.22.
I have not noticed any change with any of these kind of tasks

&gt; If it is because of the preemptive scheduling, im kinda wondering why its being labled as
&gt; such a big feature of 2.6.0 when obviously it wont suit everyone.
One thing that really annoyed me when changing from 2.4 to 2.6-pre was
the mouse handling. It appears to be more sensitive, and has some kind
of 'acceleration' that I can't find a way of turning off. Does anyone
know what causes this and how to turn it off?
