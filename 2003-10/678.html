&gt; &gt; Quite weak really. You've advocated that we should drop all security

&gt; Hell, it worked for Microsoft, right?

&gt; Damien:  I'm really doubtful about this.  Binary packages for *all*
&gt; Linux'es will never, ever work IMO - I mean, the amount of different
&gt; kernels, libraries, etc out there mean that the same application's not
&gt; going to work in every enviroment unless you pull all sorts of duplicate
&gt; dependencies over, i.e. version 1.3 and 1.4 of x library, not to mention
&gt; all sorts of other fun things. This ain't Windows - it's the land of
&gt; choice, and we've sure got plenty of it.
&gt;
&gt; Then of course you've got more then one architecture; not just 32-bit x86
&gt; code, but PPC, etc.  Good luck getting a x86 package running on a G4.

It could at least cover the most popular x86 distributions. PPC packages could 
be in another part of the site. Anyway, if this guy manages to setup a 
respository of easy-to-install packages for the most popular distributions 
(ie installs on recent mandrake/suse/redhat boxes), then I think that will be 
a positive thing and would hopefully become a popular place for people to 
find software they want.

I don't know what David Lloyd's going on about regards to security. The 
administrator has the ability to disallow non-root installs in the global 
config file. It's no less secure than allowing people to compile stuff in 
their home dir anyway, so what's wrong with allowing a non-adminstrator to 
install pre-compiled stuff?

&gt;
&gt; R
&gt;
&gt; (This is why things such as Ports are in place).

Go tell your Grandma to "just cd to /usr/ports then type 'find . -name 
'somepackage', then cd to the appropriate directory if it finds it, then type 
'make install clean' and let it go. If it has a problem, just cvsup your 
ports tree by... etc etc"

or in Windows:

Download the setup.exe from the site and click on it to install.

or with Autopackage.

Download the setup.package from the site, right click the file and choose 
properties then the permissions tab. Make sure the "exec" checkbox is ticked, 
click OK. Now click the file to install it.
