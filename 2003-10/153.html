&gt;&gt; Yep, that's what i thought. Now to finding the module(s)...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What about initrd? That's for storing in memory the modules the
&gt;&gt; kernel needs to boot isn't it? How did you make your initrd images?
&gt;&gt; I made one with the mkinitrd tool but it still didn't work.

Hello Robert,

Looks like you sent this to the Ice Mailing list.. your not subscribed..
anyway I approved it, as this may be a interest to some of the club
members.

&gt; I don't normally use Mdk, but I've got a machine set up with it that I 
&gt; fiddle with different distro's on. 

I hope you will not be too disappointed, but I think that Mandrake 9.1
would be a better choice.

&gt; However after changing the scsi card 
&gt; from a aic7xxx type to an aha1542, so that I've got an external 
&gt; connector and a boot option.
&gt; I found that even after changing /etc/modules.conf and running
&gt; pnpdump &gt; isapnp.conf then modifying the result, the dang thing still 
&gt; gives the complaint:
&gt; busybox: init aic7xxx error: no aic7xxx adapter found.
&gt; when starting. So I am wondering how to make it forget it used to have 
&gt; an aic7xxx adapter in it.

This sounds like a initrd problem, that's if your seeing the error very
early in the boot process, and your right no matter what you do, you
will see the error, as the module would have been built into the initrd
file..    you can fix your situation with the "mkinitrd" command..  Now
even I would have to review howto run that command, but first go through
man file for "mkinitrd" e.g. "man mkinitrd".

O.K. here's how I would go about it..  now this will be rough, as I am
not going to try it just to see if it's correct..  Warning if you get
this wrong your Linux will not boot at all, so anything that you do from
my instructions is at your own risk. First make sure that your
/etc/modules.conf file is in order, as mkinitrd will use that file.

Make the image
mkinitrd /boot/initrd-test.img `uname -r`

Edit the lilo.conf file.. add a test boot..   here's an example, of
course your should be different.. depending on your hardware config etc.

image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label="test"
        root=/dev/hda5
   # note the initrd entry
        initrd=/boot/initrd-test.img
        append="devfs=mount hdc=ide-scsi acpi=off quiet"
        vga=788
        read-only

Once you have worked it all out..  DON'T FORGET to run the "lilo"
command when you have finished

Cheers
Mark

Binh.
