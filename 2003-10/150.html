&gt; Yep, that's what i thought. Now to finding the module(s)...
&gt; 
&gt; What about initrd? That's for storing in memory the modules the kernel needs
&gt; to boot isn't it? How did you make your initrd images? I made one with the
&gt; mkinitrd tool but it still didn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now i'm compiling the kernel again, but all the options that i had as
&gt; modules in the IDE/ATA category i've changed to Y. Let's see if that was
&gt; where the problem was..
&gt; 

I'd suspect the most likely cause of the problem would've been in the
File Systems section of menuconfig. Specifically CONFIG_EXT3_FS for the
ext3 file system if that's what you're using. From the kernel help file
for ext3 support....

"Be aware however that the file system of your root partition (the one
containing the directory /) cannot be compiled as a module, and so this
may be dangerous."

I'm real lazy these days and can't be bothered wasting time recompiling
kernels or packages for the miniscule performance optimisation benefits,
so I just use the stock redhat kernels which come with their own
initrd's. In human terms the difference isn't really all that noticable,
well at least not to me. I prefer to spend my time developing
fvwm-themes or helping people with their linux problems on EFNET's
#linuxhelp.

Incidently, you can get a full working LAN in about 30 secs with the
quicktables tool from <A HREF="http://qtables.radom.org">http://qtables.radom.org</A> assuming you have a
kernel with iptables support.

If you have any other questions or problems you can always try to get
instant help on IRC on #linuxhelp on any of the EFNET servers listed at
<A HREF="http://www.efnet.org/?module">http://www.efnet.org/?module</A>=servers
Of course there are many linux help channels on many networks but that's
where I usually hang out and one of the friendliest help channels I've
found.
