&gt; There are ways of avoiding DLL Hell in Windows, such as making use of

Then I guess that beggars the question as to why Microsoft don't use
them.  Note that I'm talking about DLL Hell from a support point of
view, not development.  I still have the scars from the last MDAC
upgrade mess I had to sort out.

&gt; after 4 years of developing COM objects & other DLLs I think I
&gt; landed in DLL Hell only twice, because I kept a close eye on what was
&gt; going on.

So it wasn't imposed on you from someone else's packages/application,
which was what I was referring to?

&gt; If you're using the .Net framework you can have multiple versions of
&gt; assemblies being referenced using the same name, and manage which
&gt; software is talking to which version.

Is this the same as a DLL?
