Jordan,

&gt; I don't think that's fair.  Just because Auntie Betty isn't interested
&gt; in the inner workings of her computer, doesn't mean she shouldn't have
&gt; access to email and a web browser (even if she does call her web browser
&gt; "the internet")

Agreed, however:

&gt; When Aunt Betty rings up a vendor (ISP, printer, digital camera, etc)
&gt; for support, practically speaking, it's only really possible to help her
&gt; if she is running Windows.  That is all I'm saying.  I'm not saying it's
&gt; a good thing, I'm just saying that's the way it is.

What? I can't decide whether that's a legitimate statement or whether that's
flamebait. Either way it's a statement that is at least bordering on the
illogical if not the plain silly.

I tend to find supporting end users on Linux a lot easier because, if I get
really stuck, I can get them into a command line. That tends to get rid of
the:

 "Was there a dialog that says [whatever]?"

 "Huh? What's a dialog?"

One can simply say:

 "Type l s p c i then press the return button. Read out slowly what it says
  to me."

..it's much easier to do that than have to ask someone to click this menu,
then that menu, enter this, press that and does the sound card appear in the
drop down box that appears. Then to have to explain what a drop down box is.

;-P
