Hey Damien,

&gt; I've got one of those benq 19" monitors (earlier version when they were called 
&gt; acer - it's the g991).. and I'm pretty happy with it... However, my friend's 
&gt; monitor has lost quite a bit of colour in one of the corners of the screen. 
&gt; Personally I'm fed up with acer/benq stuff (my acer burner just died).

I have an Acer AC901 19" CRT. Very happy with it. Purchased from Cherry
Computers 12 mnths ago.(they were on special at the time $495)

&gt; 
&gt; I have a  friend who has a Mitsubishi monitor (21" I think)... he's had it for 
&gt; years and it's never failed him. It squeals at some refresh rates though.
&gt; 
&gt; We have the diamond view monitors at Uni, and they seem to be ok. It looks and 
&gt; works exactly like my acer monitor at home, so they might actually be the 
&gt; same monitor with different branding.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't tried the LG ones, so I don't know.

I also have an LG Flatron ez T710B 17" flat screen which has excellent
colour and is probably the best bang for buck 17" CRT you will find. (IT
Warehouse sell them and there may be a 19" version available.

&gt;

Cheers,
Anthony
