Mark,

&gt;  &gt; Whether we choose to like this or not, I happen to have identified a
&gt;  &gt; legitimate concern that a minority in our western society may have. I
&gt;  &gt; doubt--though I may be wrong--that you have ever experienced the use
&gt;  &gt; of the word in question in a physically or emotionally threatening
&gt;  &gt; manner.
&gt; 
&gt; The word wasn't used in a physically or emotionally threatening manner.

I didn't specifically say that in this instance it was.

&gt; Being able to tell the difference is important. 

Being aware that it's usage as a perjorative term--which I think you'd
agree that it definitely was--can offend regardless of its intent or not.

&gt; It'd be a shame if the whole world was well-adjusted enough to not give
&gt; a damn about homosexuality but still talked to you "in a physically or
&gt; emotionally threatening manner" because you were an annoying git who
&gt; kept getting up everyone's noses with irrelevent off-topic bullshit.

It would be, wouldn't it just? It's not irrelevent [sic] nor irrelevant.
Nor is it necessarily off topic, nor bull-shit, however I am talking from
my own perspective. You have yours, as I mentioned before.

Perhaps I should be more forgiving for those who have used a week of
Windows ;-P

LOL
