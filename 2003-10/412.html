 &gt;&gt; I don't think that's fair.  Just because Auntie Betty isn't 
 &gt;interested 
 &gt;&gt; in the inner workings of her computer, doesn't mean she 
 &gt;shouldn't have 
 &gt;&gt; access to email and a web browser (even if she does call her web 
 &gt;&gt; browser "the internet")
 &gt;&gt; 
 &gt;&gt; When Aunt Betty rings up a vendor (ISP, printer, digital 
 &gt;camera, etc) 
 &gt;&gt; for support, practically speaking, it's only really 
 &gt;possible to help 
 &gt;&gt; her if she is running Windows.  That is all I'm saying.  I'm not 
 &gt;&gt; saying it's a good thing, I'm just saying that's the way it is.
 &gt;
 &gt;I think you might have meant to say:
 &gt;
 &gt;"it's only really possible *for me* to help her if she is 
 &gt;running Windows."

No, that's not what I meant to say.

 &gt;Some standardisation for configuration tools would, of 
 &gt;course, be a lot of help.

And until they exist on every Aunt Betty's PC, then, IMHO, it is not
practical to offer her support (unless you limit support to a few,
recent distributions.)

If you've got a brand-spanking new PC with the latest distro then modern
hardware support is now very good.  That's fine for you.

However, Aunt Betty's PC is three years old (about average for your
average Aunt Betty).  Aunt Betty buys a new digital camera to take
pictures of her grandkiddies.  Now let's say she's running Windows 98SE
- she inserts the CD, the installation program runs automatically and
installs the driver and software (hopefully without blue-screening)

If Aunt Betty's three year old PC is running RedHat 6.2, how practical
do you think it would be to get her digital camera up and running?  How
about that new canon printer she just purchased from Harvey Norman?
How *practical* (not possible: practical) would it be to have telephone
support staff available to help her?

IMHO, not very.

Don't get me wrong, I think open source is A Good Thing.  I think Linux
is A Good Thing.  I just don't think it's ready for everyone yet.

My apologies to anyone with the name Betty. :-)

Regards,
