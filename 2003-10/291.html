Oh gimme a break... in the words of Seinfeld:

"Aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? When somebody asks me for 
directions to Israel, *I* don't fly off the handle!" -- Jerry Seinfeld.

Here's a use of the word lame from the Simpsons:

Black Comedian on TV: "Black guys, we drive a car like this [leans back and 
looks cool] a do do do doo doo... but white guys, they drive like this [leans 
forward and screws up face] a ding ding da ding ding..."

Homer: "hahahahahaha, it's true! We're SO lame!"

The kids on South Park also use the word "gay" in the context that I did, so 
it is not a localised meaning of the word.

Also, the correct term for referring to homosexuals is "queer". As in "Queer 
eye for the straight guy", and "Queer as folk". Also at Uni, we have "queer 
space", a place where non-straight people can hang out in comfort and safety.

The term "gay" has multiple meanings. However, I will acknowledge that in the 
demographic of this mailing list, it may not be seen that way.

Therefore,

I hereby apologise for use of the word "gay" in a context you dont like.

Damien.

P.S: On posts like that your sig should be:

&gt; &gt; As soon as it got childish you could have stopped reading it.

&gt; &gt; I learnt something new today 'gay' can also now mean 'lame'. 'Lame' used
&gt; &gt; to mean you were limping but it obviously has a new meaning now too as
&gt; &gt; in pathetic, stupid etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Robyn
&gt;
&gt; Actually Robyn, I think the lame and pathetic applies to the sad sacks
&gt; who use the word in that way.
&gt;
&gt; Lets see - substitute their name in that scsenario - do they like the
&gt; use of something describing them as an inference of
&gt; failure/uselessness/'lameness'?
&gt;
&gt; Its pathetic, and I'm shocked to see it here in this forum. I thought
&gt; there was more intelligence here than that.
&gt;
&gt; And anyone who wants to bitch at me for posting this - go ahead. I'm
&gt; pretty steamed about it, and happy to respond to grumbles accordingly.
