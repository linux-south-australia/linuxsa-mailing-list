&gt; I happen to have all of the update packages as well. They'll fit on
&gt; another CD...
&gt;
&gt; Therefore:
&gt;
&gt;  Mandrake 9.2 + updates = 4 CDs
&gt;
&gt; Joseph Tan has them.

Ok, cool, maybe I'll still give it a go.

&gt; For what it's worth, I can't see anything WRONG with Mandrake 9.2. A few
&gt; clicks and it's installed (for the most part) and it just started to work.
&gt;
&gt; I'm confident that I could give this to my computer illiterate mother to
&gt; install and she'd only have to ask me one or two easy to answer questions.

Except if she has an LG CDROM drive :) I was thinking of giving it to my 
sister to try out, but now I'll have to make sure she doesnt have an LG CDROM 
drive. LG should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a drive that could be 
broken by (non-malicious) software.
