MIT has released their courseware. <A HREF="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/index.htm">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/index.htm</A>

This is IBM's LPI courseware. Start with LPI Certification 101 Part 1.
<A HREF="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/views/linux/tutorials.jsp">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/views/linux/tutorials.jsp</A>

I believe LPI exams are being held at LCA2004.

&gt; especially from a users (non professsional) perspective.

&gt; &gt; I want to do a Linux course but, I have no interest in Networking.

&gt; &gt; Are there courses for people like me? :)
&gt; 
&gt; The people that seem to get the most from the Hands-On Linux course are
&gt; those that are into Systems and Network Admin. That said, there's a
&gt; great deal in there that's more generic. You can find a link to the
&gt; course outline at <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/index2.html">http://www.iit-training.com.au/index2.html</A> .
&gt; 
&gt; This course doesn't show you how to click on a button to get a menu on
&gt; the screen and doesn't show you how to use a particular word processor,
&gt; but it does go through things like package management, rebuilding the
&gt; kernel, security and the various components that make up the graphical
&gt; interface (a behind-the-scenes look).
&gt; 
&gt; If enough people were interested in a course on the same sorts of
&gt; things, I'm sure IIT Training would consider running a series of courses
&gt; on particular aspect of Linux that you'd like. Like with any company you
&gt; want something from, send a polite wish list of the sorts of things
&gt; you'd like to see in a course, as well as the course length, etc, etc
&gt; and I'm sure they'll look into it. Nothing may come of it in the really
&gt; short term, but you can always ask :-).
&gt; 
&gt; thx,
&gt; Matt
