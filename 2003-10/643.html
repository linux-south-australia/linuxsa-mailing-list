David, David, David...

Would you like me to paste the contents of the website in here? Maybe I can 
give you a quick summary so you don't have to do the hard task of pasting a 
link into a web browser.

It is not meant to replace the packaging format of a distribution, but rather 
be complimentary to it. It is intended to be distribution independent, i.e. a 
single package works on any distribution. Tell me how I can configure a tool 
to let me download packages from the Debian distribution onto my Mandrake 
box?

It is intended for third party applications, games, proprietary software, etc 
(like the loki game installer, but more general). On the TODO list they are 
planning "self-contained" packages, that include the entire installer, not 
just a stub that downloads the installer, as well as interactive installs 
that allow the user to choose where they want the package to go, and various 
other options.

So... what's the apt command for installing something as non root into a 
directory of my choosing, for a package I've already downloaded (that may or 
may not have all of its dependencies met)? Keep in mind it should be 
interactive so that Mr/Ms former-windows-user has no problems with it.

Cheers,

Damien

(P.S: How was that for a first flame? :)

&gt; Damien,

&gt; &gt; I just thought I would report on my experiences with the autopackage
&gt; &gt; tool version 0.3.5. I tested the package installer by downloading a
&gt; &gt; package (in this case Gaim 0.7.0):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.autopackage.org/downloads/gaim/">http://www.autopackage.org/downloads/gaim/</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It cannot fetch dependencies from the net yet, so all packages in that
&gt; &gt; directory are required. I ran the installer by typing the following
&gt; &gt; command.
&gt;
&gt; It looks like "yet more redundancy" to me.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Overall, I think it's a very promising packaging format and should make
&gt; &gt; installing software a lot simpler for the user. It is intended to be
&gt; &gt; distribution-independent, and so the very same packages should install
&gt; &gt; on SuSE, Redhat, Debian, slackware, etc etc... having a repository of
&gt; &gt; cross distribution packages would simplify things a whole lot. I
&gt; &gt; encourage anybody interested to check out the project
&gt; &gt; (www.autopackage.org).
&gt;
&gt; Under Debian one can do:
&gt;
&gt;  auto-apt gaim
&gt;
&gt; ...and auto-apt will just run off and download, preconfigure and configure
&gt; all packages necessary to run gaim. It's not ported to apt4rpm yet but the
&gt; port wouldn't be too difficult.
&gt;
&gt; WHY introduce yet another packaging format?
&gt;
&gt; Pray tell me what's so difficult with:
&gt;
&gt;  * synaptic
&gt;  * apt-get install BLAH
&gt;
&gt; ???
