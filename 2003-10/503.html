 &gt;&gt; Is there another method I should try?
 &gt;
 &gt;Nero is a Windows program that is supported by a company; 
 &gt;they might know the answer ;-)

I think it's fairly safe to assume that is a dig at my comments of a few
days ago.

Perhaps, to be more clear, I should have said "how can you possibly hope
to train a legion of support droids to fix problems on unknown operating
systems when they can't read the solutions from a book?"

Of course, the obvious answer is not to use products and services from
companies who employ support droids.  And the solution for any company
providing products and services is not to hire support droids.  Next
time, I will try to think a little more before posting.

As for Nero, the following settings should work:

  Data Mode 1
  Block size: 2048
  Image header 0
  Image trailer 0
  Scrambled unticked
  Swapped unticked

I'll be the first to admit that Nero can be picky with images.  If
you're using XP (gasp!) you could try this:

With regards (and tail firmly between legs),

 &gt;How many CDROM's has your computer? You may be able to burn 
 &gt;it under Linux using knoppix if you can manage to get knoppix loaded.
 &gt;
 &gt;BTW, UniSA do allow Linux computers on the network -- their 
 &gt;IT staff just don't particularly support it. Nonetheless I 
 &gt;have gotten a Linux box onto the UniSA network (a RedHat 9.0 
 &gt;box), it authenticates very nicely against the Win2K servers 
 &gt;they have their and prints very well. I've managed to 
 &gt;convince the Uni's Socks server to allow it for SSH out and so forth.
 &gt;
 &gt;I can set one of these up for about 2-3 hours work (time to 
 &gt;install and time to explain to end customer).
 &gt;
 &gt;Maybe you should talk to me?
