The new G4 iBooks look damn nice, likewise with the new Powerbook's.  I've
been holding off upgrading my aging G4/500 for a while, but I'm finally doing
it - 10.3 absolutely and utterly rocks, it's gotten rid of bugs that have
irritated me since day one of using OS X.  The original Superdrives (DVD
burners) were awful slow at 1X, but now they're at 4X, it's definitely worth it.

Unfortunately Apple have just recalled all their 1.25ghz model due to a memory
issue or something :-(

Seriously, from the perspective of somebody who daily uses Windows, OS X and
Linux for desktop stuff, definitely consider an Apple for a laptop.  Battery
life is fantastic, and they're damn useful when you're on the road - things
just work, you can throw firewire cameras into it and it just works, and they
take a beating pretty well, considering (My G4/500 was dropped a million
times, always by somebody else tripping over a cable or something - the case
itself ended up with some scratches and one dent, but it just kept on working
no problems.  iBook's are even sturdier.  I've got friends with Toshiba/Acer
laptops that have died from tiny drops).

And you can always throw Linux on it :-)
