try reading non plain text in mutt or pine and you will know ;-)
html source code is a bit of a pain to read ;-) kmail also has this effect by 
default but you can turn it off.

There are also security reasons to not open html mail

&gt; 1) It was RTF, not HTML

&gt; 2) Is there a practical reason for not liking HTML emails or is this a
&gt; 'religious' thing? Seriously, if it actually causes problems I'll be happy
&gt; to change.
&gt;
&gt; As for Crossover Office, I might give it a go if I can't get everything I
&gt; need running under WINEX.

&gt; &gt; Have a look at<A HREF="http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere">http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere</A> are lists of
&gt; &gt; working
&gt;
&gt; apps/games and how he got them to work. Dreamweaver MX is listed. BTW, this
&gt; is one of the apps I'd like to get working and life is too short - nothing
&gt; wrong with WYSIWYG at all! Build the page then polish in text mode.
&gt;
&gt; Dreamweaver certainly works, and has for ages.  Consider both commercial
&gt; versions of Wine if you want maximum compatibility; both Transgaming's
&gt; WineX for games, and Codeweavers Office for applications.

&gt; &gt; Next thing happened when I tried to load EA Cricket 2002; it came up
&gt; &gt; with an
&gt;
&gt; error message describing 'evil copy protection'. Now, I felt sure that I
&gt; had read that WINEX 3.0 had better support for SafeDisc or whatever copy
&gt; protection EA uses so this puzzled me. So is this as simple a fix as
&gt; downloading a NOCD patch for Cricket 2002 and installing it? If so, that's
&gt; interesting that the same facility by which people use to copy games
&gt; illegally and then get past the copy protection is essential to running
&gt; games which I bought legally in WINEX.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So, any solutions, people?:-)
