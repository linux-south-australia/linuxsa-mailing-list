&gt; Next you'll tell me that homosexuality has nothing to do with
&gt; homosexuality.

 John: Homer, what have you got against gays?
Homer: You know!  It's not... usual.  If there was a law, it'd be
       against it!
Marge: Oh Homer, please!  You're embarrassing yourself.
Homer: No I'm not, Marge!  They're embarrasing me.  They're embarrassing
       America.  They turned the Navy into a floating joke.  They ruined
       all our best names like Bruce, and Lance, and Julian.  Those were
       the toughest names we had!  Now they're just, uh...
 John: Queer?
Homer: Yeah, and that's another thing!  I resent you people using that
       word.  That's our word for making fun of you!  We need it!!  Well
       I'm taking back our word, and I'm taking back my son!
