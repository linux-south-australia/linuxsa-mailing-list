Regulars would know of the community project I have been working on, 
trying to get e-Smith working as the server for a computer room with 10 
terminals running XP Pro. This is located at the Bagster Community 
House, Salisbury North.

Although we are just volunteer workers we seem to have things working 
to a point but I would really appreciate somebody who really knew their 
Linux / Win systems to help me get the problems ironed out and the 
system working to its capacity.

(1) The server will dial the modem but as soon as the number has 
dialled it switches to off-hook status.

(2) We have set one machine up with roaming profiles but now need to 
somehow transfer those settings to the other 9 machines.

(3) We want the server to act as a print server for a Lexmark Z53 and 
an old HP LaserJet II. I think the Lexmark is set up but not sure about 
how to hook the LaserJet in as well.

So we would like the help of somebody very familiar with 
troubleshooting e-Smith or similar server distros and also familiar 
with networking requirements with XP Pro. 

Oh, we only have access to the room between 9 - 3 Monday to Thursday 
less time when the room is used for classes.

Please email me off list if you live close to Salisbury North and you 
can offer us some help in those times.

 Cheers,
 Ian
