&gt; Weird,

My sentiments too. The printer is the infamous Canon BJC4550, and it does
work. It is connected to a Knoppix box on lp0. There are no errors
in the logs however it will not print at all from knoppix. 
According to cups the print job is "canceled" on each attempt. However 
when printing from a networked PC it produces the output described 
earlier...black page with white text. 
Me thinks it is hardware related. It has worked ok in the past. 
The MB is an older AT. I have played around with the bios ECP, SPP stuff
but, that did not change anything.

&gt; machine and all was well again.
&gt; 
&gt; No idea what was causing it.

&gt; &gt; I have come up against a brick wall while trying to diagnose a printing
&gt; &gt; problem. I am getting a negative of a normal printout i.e. the page is
&gt; &gt; printing black leaving white text. Hell, I have looked at everything I can
&gt; &gt; think of....drivers, bios, the printer. Has anyone seen this ? Can you
&gt; &gt; point me in the right direction ?
&gt; &gt; Thanks
