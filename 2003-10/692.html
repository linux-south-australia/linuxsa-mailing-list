&gt; &gt; Do not use paraphrase, eg just press enter and move on.
&gt; &gt; Make sure you made the keys as the user on both ends and not as 
&gt; &gt; root in a users folder.
&gt; &gt; Make sure authorised_keys is a file and not a folder
&gt; 
&gt; also you might like to disallow root logins from external interfaces
&gt; and run a second ssh server on the internal loopback device that
&gt; accepts root logins, so requiring ssh authenticated access to the
&gt; host before getting near a root account, and requiring properly
&gt; setup ssh agent forwarding...
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,

I guess I have never really understood why you shouldn't allow root logins.
I mean really what is the difference between logging into your user account
and then su'ing to root?  What security does this provide?  In my opinion it
doesn't provide anything except it's a tiny but more complex.  If anything
you should turn off SSHv1 and do not use RSA keys at all.  Although taking
into account that you might have client issues with DSA keys and a possible
V1 vs. V2 issue as well, but I think any software remotely recent should be
able to handle these just fine.  Even when using cleartext authentications
mechanisms I would think that allowing root is just as well as letting
someone expose their password for other systems and the root password when
su'ing.  Any thoughts?
