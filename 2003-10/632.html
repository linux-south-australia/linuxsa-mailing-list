Dan,

&gt; It is a well-guarded secret (why, I don't know -- too boring?) how much
&gt; effort is put in to create quality, consistent packages for a distro
&gt; from free packages around the net.

Tell me about it. 

&gt; If it was within the scope of a company then Red Hat would have managed
&gt; it, but as we've seen recently they have had to acknowledge the job is
&gt; just too hard/big for them to do thoroughly, and they've adopted something
&gt; along the lines of the Debian model to concentrate on funding their
&gt; perceived value items

They'll still have to have a reasonable development team to fix "Fedora" up
ready for an official "RedHat" release. The Debian model is good but having
spent a year fixing "Debian" for an OEM release there's always those bits
and pieces that are just not right for a real, production release.

Unfortunately, whilst the Debian community model is by no small means the
best way to develop a distribution, the community tends to come up with a
product that is almost, but not quite, suited to business needs.
