Dear Puzzled Person,

This is called "support in the raw" :-) I have Bcc'd you on this, and
sent this To: LinuxSA because that's where you'll find all sorts of
well-informed people. I may or may not be available to discuss this
further in any reasonable time but The List Never Sleeps.

The problem you reported is that small web transfers work (in your case
from Windows machines) but big ones stall. I just realised when perusing
some network rules this morning that what you are seeing is probably the
Path MTU Discovery problem being present somewhere in the route between
the hosts experiencing the problem and the destination hosts.

Path MTU Discovery is where some host is trying to work out the best
sized MTU and does so by sending out the largest packet it can with the
"don't fragment" bit set in the expectation that it will get back an
ICMP type 3 error code 4 "Fragmentation required by DF bit set". Some
extra-keen but not very clueful router or firewall administrator is
blocking these ICMP packets. This has nothing to do with whether ping
works (that's ICMP types 8 and 0.) For two reasons at least this problem
can be quite erratic, and what's worse the evidence you need to solve
the problem is being dropped on the floor :-)

One alltheweb.com hop away I found a good description at
<A HREF="http://blue-labs.org/howto/mtu-mss.php">http://blue-labs.org/howto/mtu-mss.php</A> . Also read RFC1191 which defined
PMTU. I'm no network guru but I view firewalls blocking this particular
ICMP type and error code as being bad not cautious. If you have ICMP
ratelimiting switched on the risk is pretty low.

If my vague recollections are right your firewall/router is a Linux
machine and itself has no problems fetching stuff with wget, so this
suggests the fault is with the firewalling behaviour on that machine.

If so, under Linux 2.4 a rule that should fix the problem is

	$IPTABLES -A INPUT -p ICMP --icmp-type 3/4 -j ACCEPT

(IIRC there's information in the archives of this list from at least
three years ago from people like Glen Turner and David Newall on this
very topic and it is likely to be better than this message.)
