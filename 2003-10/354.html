Hi,

At the risk of continuing a thread I soooo want to die, I will clear up some 
issues. Firstly, I think it was 100% correct of David to respond to me how he 
did. I would have preferred that he voiced his concerns in private with me, 
rather than taking the thread down that direction. Nevertheless, it was 
probably useful to get such concerns out in the open.

I totally agree that my usage of the word was not appropriate. I would never 
want to make somebody feel bad about who they are, and that was certainly not 
my intention.

Now can we kindly go back to praising all things Open Source, and bashing MS? 
:)

Thank you.

Damien

P.S: IE sux0rz &gt;:)

&gt; It's a public mailing list that has always covered a wide range of
&gt; topics not only Linux. This I feel has kept the list alive. If someone
&gt; was offended by anothers use of language then something needs to be
&gt; said, and it was. I will always defend ones need to say they were
&gt; offended.
