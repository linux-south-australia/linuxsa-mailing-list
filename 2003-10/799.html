&gt; I was wondering if there is a simple way to change the interrupt a device
&gt; uses?  I added an Advansys SCSI to the computer and, for a while, everything
&gt; was fine. However after I updated software, I found that the SCSI had grabbed
&gt; the interrupt that sound previously had - hence no sound!
&gt; I've had a look at the drivers source for both advansys and i810_audio (no
&gt; luck), and on google (ditto). If anyone has any ideas I'd appreciate it.

Yes, ive got an advansys scsi card and have noticed that it doesn't
share interrupts nicely. Interrupts are set by the plug n play (pray)
bios, and what options the bios gives you varies. Also some physical
slots are tied together on the motherboard, so if the bios provides no
options, start shuffling cards around and see how you go. Watch IRQ
allocations in the boot sequence, and try and get the advansys on its
own. I suspect its (not) sharing with your sound.

My system only functions OK with one particular order of cards in the
pci slots! When in a problematic configuration the access lights
illuminate on the scsi cdrom drives and the whole system locks hard for
a couple of seconds before continuing with a scsi reset logged. Well,
thats under linux, windows locks hard and stays that way! Very annoying.
