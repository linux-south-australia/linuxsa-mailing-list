James,

Firstly, I don't think you need to apologise for either using or not using 
Lindows any more than for RH or Mandrake. All are Linux (I know, linux is 
the kernel etc). What's really the issue here? I have a small business and 
I (will) make my money by targeting my perceived customers, with products 
which I hope differentiate me from others. Each Linux is flavoured for 
different markets. Lindows is maybe less configurable and has quirks but it 
is geared towards a particular market. I won't use the 'target market' term 
(oh bugger, I just did). If anyone disagrees with how they package, market, 
distribute their product, that user/consumer/customer can go elsewhere - no 
probs! There's plenty of choice.

The only relevant issue here is the GPL one and maybe it should be 
discussed with the relevant parties who created the GPL. I don't know if 
Lindows is non-complient or not - I'm no lawyer. Sorry, the NIC cable issue 
is relevant too but as a technical problem - maybe should have been a 
separate post. I must try it :)

I've been  a Lindows Insider since May 2002. I started with stuff-all 
knowledge and now still know stuff-all but at least I can use Linux on a 
daily basis. It probably would not have happened except that Lindows 
promised me that I'd have a Linux easy enough to use and in general they 
have made good on the promise. The Lindows forums have been hot lately with 
many many new Linux users coming on board and you and I and many others 
have been working hard to help out, getting people up to speed, comfortable 
and satisfied. As I posted on the forum, my main concern is how to provide 
quality service to all these new heads (or bums in seats).

Love em or hate em or neither (ie just use/not use), Lindows have brought 
Linux to the masses. The great unwashed (me) may never be the same again.

cheers

Patrick

&gt;The first thing I will say is that I really don't use Lindows, for several

&gt;
&gt;Three issues have come up, and I am not getting a reasonable answer from 
&gt;them, so I bring it up here:
&gt;
&gt;1. Unplugging the network cable will slow Lindows down to a crawl! I would 
&gt;like to know what would be causing this, and how to stop it.
&gt;
&gt;2. Users are forced to have an Internet connection to install the modofied 
&gt;.deb files they downloaded from Lindows.com. I say modified because 
&gt;Lindows.com encrypts their .debs after getting them from Debian.  I asked 
&gt;him why, and here is some of the dialoh=gue and the President of 
&gt;Lindows.com's response:
