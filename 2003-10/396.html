This gets back to my idea of people sharing their configuration files, 
and my idea of having a developer friendly certification program that 
the developers themeselves would provide with the software.

If configuration files could be downloaded based upon the situation,  
FreeBSD and Linux would be a hell of a lot easier to use and much  more 
useful. Not to say that they are not.  Ironically I have moade the most 
progress on my desktop for both of these.

However in server space, its been a lot of wasted time, at least for me.

The total cost of ownership issue is much the same as it was for me as 
when I wanted a Netware client.  Sure Caldera would have sent someone 
out for $1,000 to give me something I got for free with Windows.  It was 
out of pure stubborness on my part that I finally figured it out on my 
own. But it was not because of total cost of ownership.

With my configuration floppy and an intimate understanding of my network 
here, the cost of the software and the maintenance is lower t han 
Windows. That is not a stretch by any means.

I think its time that we leverage the experience of the Unix community 
and make scalable configurations available for download from pages that 
describe what the configuration parameters are. I hope to start up a 
repository in a few weeks.

To become viable and not the shun of business, the Unix community needs 
to _first_ share configurations or script files to allow for proper 
configuration of applications in an understandable way.

Then, if that doesn't work, we can more or less be assured that only 
undocumented or unsolved problems come our way.  having an archive of 
answers available for searching is definitely good, however, it still 
gets back to RTFM, and that compete with Windows.  Although I appreciate 
the existing documentation, there is always a missing step, or its out 
of date, so I usually have to look up multiple sources of information 
and even expiriment to solve a problem.  That's why I usually try to 
document and test what I had to do to get something to work, but its 
probably better if I just made some configuration files available, or 
best if I did a combination of both.
