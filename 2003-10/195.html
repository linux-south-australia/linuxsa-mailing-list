<H1>FYI: Dual Channel DVI</H1>

I've spent the last good week on this, and it doesn't seem to be documented
*anywhere* particulary well, so just an FYI for those here (and google, as I
always seem to find LinuxSA postings when I'm looking for something).

If you're looking at getting a large LCD/Plasma monitor that's going to do
more then 1280x1024 on DVI, you're going to need a video card that does "Dual
Channel DVI".  It appears that single channel DVI, which most cards do, only
supports up to 1280x1024 maximum.

Problem is absolutely nobody advertises, or states in their technical notes
what their cards do - it's just "DVI".

ATI Radeon's &gt;9600 seem to do dual channel fine, but their Linux support is
poor for 3D stuff (ATI's drivers like to crash randomly, and the DRI stuff is
particulary slow).  Most modern nVidia cards support dual channel as well;
problem is it seems some manafacturers seem to (deliberately?) cripple their
cards abilities to output, as even though the card can think it can do a high
resolution, the actual resolution you get is 1280x1024.

Which makes your computer do VERY odd things; not only do some graphic modes
look really bloody odd, but you get this affect at non-1280x1024 modes
(including text) which make the screen look all stretched - it looks like
somebody's fiddled with the V-height and H-height settings (Which aren't
available on DVI) and made the screen size bigger then the physical size; you
can't see everything properly.

I've tried many cards; two Geforce 4 MX's (which didn't support dual channel
DVI *at all*), a MSI Geforce FX5600 (which supported it, but the card appeared
crippled as hell), a Triplex Geforce 4 TI 4200 which I'm currently using
(which seems to support it, but the nvidia kernel currently is crashing
randomly, with call traces in my syslog), amongst others.  There's simular
problems under Windows, so it isn't Linux specific.

All these cards work at high resolutions fine using a VGA cable; problem is
that LCD monitors at these kind of resolutions look fuzzy as hell unless you
use DVI.  I get a headache after 5 minutes of working in an xterm.

I'm trying to get the guys who built this machine to locate an nVidia card
that'll support this properly; if anybody knows of one, let me know.  If not,
all good, I just get to live a few more days in Linux with it being more like
Windows Land ;-)
