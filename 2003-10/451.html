Hi all

I've been playing around with WINE and WINEX and no matter how hard I try, I
just can't get the bugger working properly. My only success thusfar has been
in downloading the latest WINE source and installing it, doing a workaround
in deleting a .wine-corey folder in /tmp and bang, it works......somewhat.
Using it I was able to install RTCW and run it smoothly (REALLY good).
Unfortunately, the keyboard didn't work but I figured that was minor
tweaking there. VERY little else worked. When I ran winecheck, it rated my
install at around the 13% mark. Weird.

Worse is WINEX. I CVS'ed the latest version, ran ./configure, make depend &&
make and make install. Then ldconfig. Then I tried to invoke winex and got
the old '/tmp/.wine-corey/server (something or other): does not exist'. Okay
I've been here before and when you try to mkdir the folders required, you
hit the '[insert relevent folder here]: is not a socket' error message.
Doing some reading, it seems it has something to do with the later versions
of LibC or something like that but this error is as old as April apparently
yes the latest CVS version of WineX still does this.

Can someone please point me in the direction of a proven link or give me
some guidance because I'd really like to get this happening. The system I'm
running this on is virtually a vanilla RH9, AMD Athlon XP 2200, 512Mb RAM,
etc.

Thanks in advance.

Corey.
