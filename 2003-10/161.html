I can imagine it'd be just like this. 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

"Merlin, Inc. technical support. How can I help you?" 

"Yesterday I've bought your sword..." 

"Congratulations, sir, you've made the right choice!" 

"It doesn't work." 

"What does it mean - doesn't work?" 

"It doesn't cut the dragon's head." 

"Have you read the manual, sir?" 

"A noble knight have not to know how to read! But my armor- bearer has read 
it for me aloud twice." 

"Well, sir. Have you taken the sword out of the sheath?" 

"Yes." 

"Is that really so? Check it again, please." 

"I've done it, I say to you!" " 

Okay, sir. Now check the edge sharpness." 

"Ough!" 

"You shouldn't do it  with your finger, sir." 

"What thinger? I've done it with my phongue! I always check a sharp flavour 
of my dishes like that." 

"You see, sir, a sword has a bit different construction than your
dinner
dishes. The term 'sharp' means here..." 

"I'm not obliged to know you technical terms! I'm a user, not a
hardware
specialist. You'd better answer why doesn't it work!" 

"Did it work before?" 

"I don't know, I've bought it only yesterday!" "Okay, sir. Have you
done
anything with it?" 

"No!" 

"Are you  sure?" 

"Well, I only took it out of the sheath." 

"Did you try to grind it yourself?" 

"What for?" 

"You know better, sir. Maybe you tried to install new spells on it?" 


"No, I use the default ones, which are supplied with the sword!" 

"Maybe it's the spoiling, sir? How long ago have you updated your holy 
water?" 

"I've downloaded the fresh version only two days ago!" 

"I see, sir. Then look if there are unscreened sources of black magic 
nearby. They may create hindrances for the sword." 

"What sources?! I'm in the desert!" 

"Don't be so nervous, sir." 

"I'm not nervous!" 

"Then why do you pant?" 

"Because the dragon is chasing me!" 

"Oh, so the dragon is near you?" 

"Yes, genius, he is already QUITE near!" 

"Excellent, sir! Give him the receiver." 

"And what if he bites my arm off?" 

"Sorry, sir, but medical issues are beyond our competence." 

"Next time I'll buy a sword of Morgana, Ltd.!" 

"Well... okay, sir. Describe at least how the dragon looks." 

"Well, he is such... yellow... with a red moustache..." 

"It's clear now. You should begin with it. It's a non-licensed
dragon, a
Chinese counterfeit." 

"And?" 

"Read the license agreement, sir. Merlin, Inc. doesn't guarantee any 
compatibility with non-certified devices." 

"And what shall I do?" 

"Don't use cheap no-name dragons anymore, sir." 

"Looks like HE is going to use me right now! Aaagh! No! 
Aaaaarrrgghhh!!!!..." 

"Sir? Sir, are you okay?... Well, in any case, Merlin, Inc. thanks you for 
your business."
