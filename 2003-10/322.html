&gt; A staggering 525 emails, or 11.4% of the total list traffic is from David

&gt; 
&gt; When I last read LinuxSA in May, David Lloyd was spouting the same
&gt; irrelevant, off-topic, tiresome, turgid, ranting, 'lame' rubbish that I see
&gt; in this very thread. I can only assume that mails 1 to 524 are similar.
&gt; 
&gt; Before I delete the entire mail archive and unsubscribe, I extend my deepest
&gt; sympathies to the rest of the LinuxSA list who seem able to tolerate this
&gt; where I can not.
&gt; 

Agreed! What is even harder to understand is his hypocrisy.

When I had an eggdrop bot with a megahal module in #linuxsa on
irc.freenode.net David delighted in teaching it conversations about
myself or my mother having sex with various farm animals or worse. When
I voiced an objection to this offensive language and behaviour he
laughed long and hard and insulted me for my lameness. I therefore
removed my bot from the channel. He has offended me greatly and affected
my life in many ways.

He informed me in in no uncertain terms that my assistance in the
forthcoming linuxconf2004 was definately NOT wanted, dismissed outright
my volunteering to participate in the CSDN as a distributor, intimidated
me on every level with every posting I make to this list, and resisted
any attempts I make to discuss my concerns intelligently with him. 

David acts like the tin-pot dictator of all things linux in Adelaide,
and has the nerve to project the image of a mistreated downtrodden
victim of an ugly hate crime over the perceived misuse of a three letter
word spoken in jest.

I have refrained in the past from spamming this list with these
irrelevant issues, but this thread we have all been subjected to demands
this simple response from me.

David! Stop being so gay! Please! Stop it!

Alex
