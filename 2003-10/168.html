&gt;&gt; Sun Microsystems crossed the line from "troubled" to "doomed" yesterday.
&gt;&gt; This is sad news for the open-source community, and we need to think
&gt;&gt; about how we're going to deal with it. The most pressing questions are,
&gt;&gt; "What becomes of Java?" and, "What becomes of OpenOffice.org?" These are
&gt;&gt; questions that matter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires that the 
&gt; auditor to modify the financial statement report if they believe that 
&gt; the company is "doomed."
&gt; A typical report might say:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming 
&gt;&gt; that the Organization will continue as a going concern. The 
&gt;&gt; Organization has sufffered recurring losses that raise substantial 
&gt;&gt; doubt about  its ability to continue as a going concern. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I didn't see a report that had that wording in it, so I consider ESR's 
&gt; statement premature.

Following up a bit more:

Sun's Net Income:

2001: $927 Million profit
2002: $587 Million loss
2003: $3,429 Million loss, of which $2,125 Million was unique to 2003. 
Sun wrote off $2,125 Million of costs that are usually expensed over 30 
years.


Sun's current net book value: $6,491 Million

Net book value means the value of what they own, less what they owe, as 
recorded on the books. The value of what they own approximates fair 
market value, but could differ. Some assets may be recorded at the 
orginial purchase value, but the value of the fixed assets are reduced 
over time AKA "depreciated."

If the current year's pace of losses continue, Sun, in all fairness 
should be expected to loose $1,500 Million per year from here on out. So 
Sun would not be at  $0 net worth for another 4.5 years, and that 
assumes that they will not make additional management changes to correct 
the current rate of loss.

There is a clear trend in the decline of their product sales.   In  2001 
they sold $15,015 Million in product, but in 2003 they only sold $7,793.
I looked at the detail of that decline and found that $6,146 of the 
decline was related to a decline in Computer Systems products sales, 
which had been $12,389 Million in 2001, but was only $6,243 Million in 
2003.  Network Storage product sales only declined by $1,076 Million 
from $2,626 to $1,550.

Sun Microsystems is by no means dead, and has a reasonable time to take 
corrective action to keep themselves afloat.  If they do nothing, they 
will be dead in 4 years.

But, seeing as how their sales have declined by $6,000 Million  per year 
since 2003, it is impressive that the bottom line has only shown a swing 
from $927 Million of profit in 2001 to an (arguably) $1,500 Million 
dollar loss in 2003.

they may end up making a fundamental change in  their business strategy
