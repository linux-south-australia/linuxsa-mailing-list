I saw this very positive review of Mr. Greg Lehey's book, the Complete 
FreeBSD, 4th Edition :-)

Cheers!

&gt;The Complete FreeBSD Fourth Edition
&gt;
&gt;Author: Greg Lehey Publisher: O Reilly ISBN: 0596005164 Price: £31.95
&gt;
&gt;IT'S ALMOST TEMPTING TO RECOMMEND THIS WORK AS A GENERAL PURPOSE GUIDE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN COMPUTING AND THE EVOLUTION OF UNIX
&gt;
&gt;Given the vast amount of online and printed GNU/Linux documentation available, FreeBSD novices must feel somewhat left out in the cold. Online documentation is sparse and tracking down a FreeBSD title on shelves stacked with generic Unix and Linux oriented titles must surely be taxing. However, the quality of available FreeBSD material is excellent, and the lack of choice of titles can work to the newbie's advantage. Indeed, part of FreeBSD s attraction must surely lie in this simplicity of approach. After all, there is only one distribution of FreeBSD and this is maintained by a central group of developers. It may not be bleeding edge, but it is stable and the FreeBSD skillset is relevant across all such systems. Linux users will also be seriously attracted by the excellent ports approach to package management, which has been adopted with great success by Gentoo Linux. 
&gt;
&gt;The Complete FreeBSD reflects admirably the simple, clean Unix philosophy of this powerful OS. A good deal of highly usable knowledge is packed into a decent sized volume, and the eminently readable style of writing and thorough approach to the subject matter is a far cry from the busy, cramming-oriented titles so often encountered in the Linux world. And this work s credentials are excellent. Previous editions of this classic text were published by FreeBSD distributer Walnut Creek. This fourth edition is now in the capable hands of O Reilly's Community Press division, which aims to reflect the knowledge and voice of specific technical communities. The latest edition reflects changes in the latest FreeBSD Release 5, as well as focusing on new topics such as wireless networking and a wider range of desktop environments. However, author Greg Lehey is keen to avoid more time-sensitive issues and material which is easily available elsewhere. It s evident that the author really does care that his readers get the most from this title, and the attention to detail throughout is exemplary. 
&gt;
&gt;Given their shared roots and philosophy, Linux users should have little difficulty getting to grips with FreeBSD. The Complete FreeBSD offers thorough, in depth coverage of all aspects of this OS, from installation issues to basic tools, file systems and a range of network services and clients. Chapters covering emulation, the Vinum volume manager and the Ports Collection will be of great interest to those migrating from other OSs, and useful summaries of all the interesting FreeBSD configuration files will prove extremely helpful to users of other Unix flavours. There s also plenty of highly readable material which provides a good overview of the FreeBSD community and development process. The Complete FreeBSD also touches on a good deal of low level x86 hardware issues. Indeed, it's almost tempting to recommend this work as a general purpose guide for anyone interested in computing and the evolution of Unix. As a Linux user, it's hard not to be jealous of an OS which offers such seriously exciting and readable documentation.
