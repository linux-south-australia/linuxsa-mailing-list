&gt; Why would you buy an old guide:

Hmm,

Most the Microsoft training guides I've read are designed in a fashion where
they explain _how_ to do something, and not really _why_ you want to do it. 
They'll give detailed information on scenarios where if this problem exists,
then X is what you want to look at, but there's hardly anything on the logic
behind the reasoning (if you don't count Microsoft Logic).

Given, there are some out there that do, but I've found they're rare.

The books seem to quickly become redundant, which sucks.  I was planning on
doing a MCSE around 2 years ago (ack, glad I didn't - some employers since
then have told me seeing a MCSE on a resume makes them instantly throw it out,
heh); I've got some expensive books sitting home which have been gathering
dust.  I remember trying to look something up 2K3 specific the other day,
trying to understand some policy or which, and it was absolutely no help at all.
