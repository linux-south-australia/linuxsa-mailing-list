When I did a stint of tech support for an ISP I had several customers
who WERE running windows simply reply "What's a Start button?"

With over 6 billion human beings on the planet you will always encounter
your share of bona-fide morons. These individuals shouldn't ever be
allowed near a computer in the first place! But hey! It's a free
country!  *shrug*

Recent versions of redhat are now even more user friendly in many ways
than windows can ever hope to be. I just installed a new mobo and all I
had to do with redhat was select OK a few times and it setup ALL the
onboard stuff (sound card, ps/2 mouse etc...) perfectly and
effortlessly. Windows however couldn't setup a single device! I'm still
hunting around for drivers, and then there's the endless reboots!

Computers and software, like everything (except M$'s policies) are
constantly evolving. Your arguments become less valid with every passing
day. IMHO of course.

Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of
confusion and bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication and
courage.  But if we don't practice these tough habits of thought, we
cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us -- and we
risk becoming a nation of suckers, up for grabs by the next charlatan
who comes along.
