<H1>Playing DVD's In SuSE Linux 8.2/FreeBSD 5.1</H1>

<PRE>
Yesterday I picked up LinuxUser magazine, and saw a DVD article in there 
that gave me a spark of hope to get my DVD's playing not in Linux, but 
in FreeBSD.  I had honestly given up on playing DVD's in Linux, as I had 
RTFM, and had grown frustrated because it would not work for me.  I 
figured that if it were a software problem, the FreeBSD ports would be 
the least likely to have a problem, so I installed the dependent 
applications listed in the article. The packages and versions I 
installed are shown when are as follows when I run pkg_info:


FreeBSD 5.1 packages:

libdvdcss-1.28 & libdvdcss-1.25
libdvdplay-1.01
libdvbpsi-0.1.3
liba52-0.7.4
ffmpeg 0.4.7
xmms-mad-0.1.1
faad2-1.1_1
libogg-1.0_1,3
libvorbis-1.0_1,3
libdvdread-0.9.4
libdvp (not installed)
ogle-0.9.1

Of course I had the ports collection installed and I had recently ran 
cvsup.  Popped in the "Catch me if you can DVD" and it worked!      :-)   


**** Reverse engineering sucess ****

The Next thing I wanted to do was copy the setup I had on FreeBSD on 
SuSE Linux 8.2. Siga showed these packages as installed before I started:

libdvdcss 1.2.6-fr2
libdvdplay (not installed)
libdvbpsi (not installed)
a52dec 0.7.4-fr3
ffmpeg (not installed)
libmad (not installed)
faad 2.0-rc1-1
libogg-1.0-92
libvorbis 1.0-95
libdvdread 0.9.4-ogle1
libdvp (not installed)
ogle not installed

I searched around and found some of the RPM's I wanted at:

<A HREF="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-redhat.html">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-redhat.html</A> & <A HREF="http://rpm.pbone.net">http://rpm.pbone.net</A>

After I had replaced packaged and mucked around, these were the packages 
I had installed on my system:

libdvdcss-1.28-1 (from vlc page)
libdvdplay-1.01-fr2
libdvbpsi-0.1.2-fr2
a52dec-0.7.4-fr3
ffmpeg 0.4.7-0.20030701-1.fr
libmad-0.15.0b-fr1
faad2.0-rc1-1
libogg-1.0-92
libvorbis-1.0-95
libdvdread-0.9.4-fr3
libdvp (not installed)
ogle-0.9.1-ogle1alsa
ogle_gui  0.9.1-ogle1

Stuck the CD in and got an error message that read something like what 
is being reported here:

<A HREF="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2003/debian-user-200305/msg01639.html">http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2003/debian-user-200305/msg01639.html</A>

&gt;libdvdread: Using libdvdcss version 1.2.6 for DVD access
&gt;&gt; libdvdread: Can't open file VIDEO_TS.IFO.
&gt;&gt; ERROR[ogle_nav]: faild to read VIDEO_TS.IFO
&gt;
His solution:

&gt;cancel that, after I could not find the correct drive name I just linked to 
&gt;/dev/cdrom and it worked.
&gt;
And that worked for me perfectly as well.

I already had a /dev/dvd device, so I removed it by running  this 
command in the shell:

rm /dev/dvd

and then made a symbolic link from /dev/cdrom to  /dev/dvd by running  
this command in the shell:

ln -s /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd


************* Conclusion****************

It appears that Ogle and Videolan require a device called /dev/dvd to be 
used to read DVD's.
