&gt; Well hopefully people that put those type of solutions into place do 
&gt; not have jobs long after they do.  It makes no sense whatsoever to 
&gt; implment security through obsecurity.  In my opinion those type of 
&gt; solutions are for lazy and or incompetant administrators.

That is not security through obscurity, the only reason it's not 
foolproof is because someone with root access can tamper with the logs 
and security access on the local machine.

If you feel this is a poor solution, then what do you suggest as a 
better one for numerous servers with multiple administrators? You're 
saying that someone who gives everyone root access immediately with a 
shared password is more competent than someone who adds a layer of 
additional per-user authentication?

Coupled with remote syslog, a per-user system will at least yield 
'session opened for user root by bob (uid=1001)' in the security 
logging. How can you offer any kind of accountability when everything is 
logged as 'root', an account that multiple people have access to? 
Tracking back who was on what IP address at what time is never 
particularly effective or conclusive.
