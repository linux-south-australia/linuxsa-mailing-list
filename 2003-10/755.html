Xnet (I think?) were a company in Sydney who were showing off their stuff 2
years ago when I was working at exhibitions such as CeBIT and Comdex; they had
a simular system to Citilan, however to get access you just entered your
credit card details into a HTTPS web server, and off you went.

Too bad they were charging something like $8/hour, plus data :(

I think they've got some AP's here in Adelaide now, I've certainly picked up
SSID's of Xnet in Rundle St before running kismet.

Something that does worry me about most the hotspots out there, though - they
don't offer any end to end client security, that is, it's completely open for
people with sniffers to see what you're doing.  Sure, if you're smart, you've
already got most services SSL'ed (mail, ssh, https, etc), but this isn't
always the case.

What's wrong with a VPN?  It comes with additional advantages, such as
authentication already handled, and as with some implementations it could be
in the form of a ppp tunnel (pptpd/poptop, for example), data accounting would
be a hell of a lot easier to implement.  I'd also imagine you could hack
something together on the AP side that could act like a NAS, therefore making
ISP Billing systems operate with it.
