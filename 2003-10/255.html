Inetd, in conjunction with Dan Shearer, is holding the first of
several advanced Linux courses:

Advanced Linux Security & Networking

  * Two days
  * Instills security concepts without technical babyfood
  * Don't forget to take your pre-configured WAN when you leave

  Full Course Details: <A HREF="http://www.inetd.com.au/pdf/inetd-training-alsn.pdf">http://www.inetd.com.au/pdf/inetd-training-alsn.pdf</A>
  Online Registration: <A HREF="http://www.inetd.com.au/training">http://www.inetd.com.au/training</A>


This course is based around a customised version of Knoppix Linux
running several operating systems concurrently on a virtual network,
so you are able to practice anywhere with exactly the environment
you used in class.  The material is applicable to other varieties
of Unix and includes practical advice for protecting networks and
hosts against attack.

The course is being delivered by Dan Shearer assisted by Chris
Foote.  Chances are you know both of these as technical experts
involved in the Internet and infrastructure community.  Local
courses, local instructors, global context.

Who is Inetd?  Inetd is a hosting company that focuses on services
which promote open source software, open standards and regional
peering.

Why is Inetd doing training?  We are raising awareness of important
issues for our customers and our community.  These are the tools of
trade for us and our collegues, and if we share them they can only get
better.

Why is Dan Shearer doing training?  Because with *this* training
course he gets to build virtual systems for the students, and
besides, he's always wanted to create open training content.  Ah
yes -- one of the outcomes of this is a modular, 'open content'
training course :-)

Why aren't we using OS 'foo' instead of Linux? Because Knoppix
already exists, and because of User Mode Linux. We know about other
technologies, we are looking at other technologies, other technologies
will be on our Live CD... but this course is going to be a Knoppix-based
winner anyway!
