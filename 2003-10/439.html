Jeez, I wish I to could complain about (cough) winblowz, or at least have a

Yes I am a computer user, I really don't like any version of the former, just 
put up with its stupid blue screening and just hanging for no reason but, 
'please sir reboot me'.
Yes I confess I like computers and I also got out of my way to make linux run 
on most platforms, to me a computer is just a TV set (you people do know what 
a television is) with a keyboard.
Well back in the days that quite a lot of the older generation of computer 
users that still exist (have not gone mad) you know the beast that I am 
talking about trs-80, apple }{, amstrad, bbc's and the good old commodore 
(not the car). yer I am now an old fart.
But still those old computers on today standard was much simpler to use and 
make them do things like controlling equipment, unlike the predecessor user 
unfriendly and bloody hard to program.
So before you start to complain about the OS that you,we,us and them hate just 
remember to bad it is there, now if the linux platforms made them selfs a 
little bit easier to install programs and make things work more of use would 
say "smeg bill, free is better" this is basically the only major user point 
of view problem I can see. 
I still run a broken version of redhat 9 on the note book and it works 90% of 
the time, it to hangs and crashes and does the windows trick, yes it would 
need the kernel recompiled to get the apci working and then may be it will be 
95% working, I have tried my hardest to get it to work but there is allways 
some thing that decides to stop working, getting close to the point of having 
to pay someone to get it working 100% or install windows pfffft to the 
latter.

My five cents with gst included

Also remember the way to add a value service to your customers is to know of 
the other OS' and there bugs and work with them.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Heh, sounds awfully familiar; I always look like an idiot when I fix
&gt; &gt; &gt; issues on a Windows machine, as I'm trying to double-escape, d-5-down
&gt; &gt; &gt; or :wq or something, which just results in whatever editor I'm using
&gt; &gt; &gt; spitting out garbage all over the screen.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Same goes for people using an editor like nano/pico; ack, people are
&gt; &gt; &gt; just kidding themselves saying 'nano is better'.  More like 'I'm lazy"
