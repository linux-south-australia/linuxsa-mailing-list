'And to those poor souls who must use Windows forever, either for job
reasons or because there is a Windows app they simply must have that
isn't available for Linux and won't work through either Wine or Win4Lin,
all I can really say is, "I feel your pain."'

I'm not going to get wrapped up in a technical discussion as to what
operating system is 'the best'

There are a number of reasons why I use Windows.  If I was to choose my
desktop for purely religious reasons, then I would run Linux or BSD.  I
am not a religious person, however.  A significant part of my job is to
support users and networks that run Windows, and the familiarity that
comes from using it myself for the last 10 years gives me a distinct
advantage.

Essentially my job is to fix things that are broken.  If everyone
switched over to Linux, as you appear to be advocating, then I can't
tell you how difficult it would be for me (or indeed anyone) to get
Auntie Betty back on the internet when she had a problem.  It would go
something like this:
___________________________________________

"You can't get on the internet?"

   "No."

"OK, could you click the Start button please, then click Settings and
Control Panel."

   "I don't have a start button."

"You don't?  What version of Windows are you running, Mrs Betty?"

   "I don't have Windows.  My newphew got rid of it last week.  He said
this was much better"

"Oh right.  What operating system do you have on your computer"

   "What's an operating system?"
___________________________________________

How are you going to diagnose her problem?  What if Auntie Betty is
running a Window Manager that you've never seen?  I could go on, but you
get my point.

oh, and re: copy/paste?  Try using the right mouse button - context
menus are something I never saw enough of when running Linux desktops.
