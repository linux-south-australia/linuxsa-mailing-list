Dear Technical Support: 

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a 
slow down in the overall performance, particularly in the flower and 
jewelery applications that had operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. 

In addition,Husband 1.0 un-installed many other valuable programs, such 
as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, but installed undesirable 
programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0. 

And now Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and House Cleaning 2.6 simply 
crashes the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these
problems, but to no avail. 

What can I do?

Dear Desperate: 

First keep in mind; Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while 
Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Try entering the command C: \ I 
THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME and download Tears 6.2 to install Guilt 3.0. 
If all works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run 
the applications Jewelery 2.0 and Flowers 3.5.But remember, overuse 
can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0 

or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will create boring 
Loudly.wav files. 

Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 or reinstall another
Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will crash
Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does
have a limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You
might consider additional software to improve memory and performance. I
personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9. 

Good Luck: Technical Support 




Software Problem 

Eighteen months ago I upgraded to Girlfriend 1.0 from Drinking Mates 4.2
which I'd used for years without any trouble. 
However, there are apparently conflicts between these two products and 
the only solution was to try and run Girlfriend 1.0 with the sound
turned off. 

To make matters worse, Girlfriend 1.0 is also incompatible with several 
other applications, such as Lads Night Out 3.1, Football 2 and Playboy
6.1. Successive versions of girlfriend proved no better. 

A shareware beta-programme, Party Girl 2.1 that I tried, had many Bugs 
and left a virus in my system, forcing me to shut down completely for 
several weeks. 

Eventually I tried to run Girlfriend 1.2 and Girlfriend 1.0 at the same 
time only to discover that when these two systems detected each other
they caused severe damage to my hardware. Sensing a way out, I then
upgraded to Fiancée 1.0 only to discover that this product soon had to
be upgraded (at great cost) to Wife 1.0, which I reluctantly agreed to,
because, whilst Wife 1.0 tends to use up all my available resources, it
does come bundled with FreeSex Plus and Cleanhouse 2000. 

Shortly after this upgrade however I then discovered that Wife 1.0 can
be very unstable and costly to run. 

For example, any mistakes I made were automatically stored in Wife 1.0's
memory and could not be deleted. They then resurfaced months later when
I had forgot about them. Wife 1.0 also has an automatic Diary Explorer
and E-mail porn filter, and can, without warning, launch Photostrop and 
Whingezip! These latter products have no help files and I have to try
and guess what the problem is myself. 

Additional costly problems are that Wife 1.0 needs updating regularly, 
requiring Shoe Shop Browser for new attachments and also Hairstyle
Express, which needs to be reinstalled every other week. 

Wife 1.0 also spawns unwelcome child processes that also drains my 

resources. It also conflicted with some of the new games I wanted to
try, stating that they are an illegal operation. When Wife 1.0 attaches
itself to my Audi TT program it often crashes or runs the system dry. 

Wife 1.0 also has a rather annoying pop-up called Mother-in-Law, which 
can't be turned off. 

Recently I've attempted to try Mistress 2000, but there could be
problems, a friend has alerted me to the fact that if Wife 1.0 detects
the presence of Mistress 2000 it tends to delete all my MS Money files
before un-installing itself. 

Any Ideas?
