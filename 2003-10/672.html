&gt; Then I guess that beggars the question as to why Microsoft don't use
&gt; them.  Note that I'm talking about DLL Hell from a support point of
&gt; view, not development.  I still have the scars from the last MDAC
&gt; upgrade mess I had to sort out.

Hehe...  oh well in that case I'll stay out of it.  "Support Messes" all 
over are generally caused by people who don't really know what they're 
doing, and so in that sense my personal feeling is that one platform's 
as bad as another ! :)  Incidentally, I'm glad I'm a developer, and not 
a support person.

&gt;&gt;after 4 years of developing COM objects & other DLLs I think I
&gt;&gt;landed in DLL Hell only twice, because I kept a close eye on what was
&gt;&gt;going on.
&gt; So it wasn't imposed on you from someone else's packages/application,
&gt; which was what I was referring to?

Oh righto...  no, those couple of times were whilst working on group 
projects and everyone seemed to have a different version of the damn thing.

&gt;&gt;If you're using the .Net framework you can have multiple versions of
&gt;&gt;assemblies being referenced using the same name, and manage which
&gt;&gt;software is talking to which version.
&gt; Is this the same as a DLL?

Yeah, from what I understand it's the .Net successor to DLL's.

Carry on,

J =)
