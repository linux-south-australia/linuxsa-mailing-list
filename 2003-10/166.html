ICANN closes VeriSign service
Anick Jesdanun
OCTOBER 06, 2003

THE .com and .net domain name operator, VeriSign, has bowed to pressure and
agreed to suspend a new online search service blamed for such side effects
as disabling spam filters and networked printers.

The decision came hours after the main oversight body for the internet
threatened legal action against VeriSign unless it shut down its Site Finder
service by Saturday evening. The company manages the central database, or
registry, for ".com" and ".net", which are the most widely-used domain
names.
"We will accede to the request while we explore all of our options,"
VeriSign spokesman Tom Galvin said on Friday. VeriSign will meet the
deadline after the oversight group rejected the company's request for a few
days' extension, Mr Galvin said.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers had declared Site
Finder in violation of VeriSign's contracts for running the master address
lists for ".com" and ".net", two of the most popular domain name suffixes on
the internet.

Paul Twomey, ICANN's chief executive, said in a letter earlier Friday to
VeriSign executive Russell Lewis that the changes "have had a substantial
adverse effect... on the stability of the internet".

VeriSign had earlier rejected suspension requests from ICANN, but the latest
carried a legal threat.

Mr Galvin was critical of ICANN's tactics, saying it made the request
"without so much of a hearing" and based its findings on "anecdotal and
isolated issues".

VeriSign officials have described the service as a useful navigational tool
for lost web surfers - though it also generates unspecified revenues from
two search engine partners.

An ICANN committee had hearings planned Tuesday in Washington DC, to review
technical issues.

Officials from the US Commerce Department, which has ultimate oversight over
the internet's core infrastructure, declined comment.

ICANN, as Commerce's designee to oversee the internet addressing system,
grants contracts to run databases containing listings for various domain
names. VeriSign has the contracts for ".com" and ".net".

Internet computers around the world regularly check VeriSign's lists to
properly route email and requests for ".com" and ".net" sites. When there is
no match, VeriSign's computers previously sent back a "no such name" message
which conformed to internet standards. But on September 15, VeriSign began
diverting traffic to its search site.

Spam filters that had depended on the "no such name" message stopped working
properly, as have some networked printers. Meanwhile, mobile web services
have gotten swamped with more data than the normal "no such name" response,
potentially generating higher phone bills.

And business rivals are upset that VeriSign was making money off its
monopoly on the ".com" and ".net" directories. At least three federal
lawsuits have been filed, including one seeking class-action status.

Mr Twomey said VeriSign "has both a legal and a practical obligation to be
responsible in its actions", and he said the service violates several
contractual provisions, including ones on equal access and operating
unauthorised services.

VeriSign has argued that ICANN previously permitted similar services.
ICANN's contract with operators of ".museum", for example, specifically
allows requests for nonexistent names to reach an index of museum sites. The
".com" and ".net" contracts do not mention the issue.
