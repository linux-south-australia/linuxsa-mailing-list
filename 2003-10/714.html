&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I guess I have never really understood why you shouldn't allow root 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logins.  I mean really what is the difference between logging into 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your user account and then su'ing to root?  What security does this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; provide? 

&gt; &gt; &gt; For systems with multiple administrators, forced non-root logins can 
&gt; &gt; &gt; provide a better audit trail and a more fine-grained control 
&gt; &gt; &gt; of access. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's by no means foolproof, but like most security measures 
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's a good way of keeping honest people honest.

&gt; &gt; Well hopefully people that put those type of solutions into place do not

&gt; have jobs long after they do.  It makes no sense whatsoever to implment
&gt; security through obsecurity.  In my opinion those type of solutions are for
&gt; lazy and or incompetant administrators.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not security through obsecurity (this isn't OpenBSD, dammit!), it's just
&gt; a way of keeping track of things.  Allowing direct root logins is just damn
&gt; silly, IMHO.

When I worked at The Bunker, we had as many as a dozen SysAdmins.
We had well over 300 FreeBSD and Linux servers, plus more Solaris
boxes then I care to mention that I did not have access to [1]... 

we logged in via ssh to a local user account, then had a bunch
of scripts to handle things that needed to be done as root.

occasionaly we needed to patch things by hand, but ultimately only in an
emergency.

everything was done remotely, as we were in London and the bunker is in the
boonies... so ssh was made mandatory for any access, including copying files.
we kept our ssh id key info on encrypted volumes, using cfs, we made heavy
use of the ssh-agent and ssh forwarding ... all mail was via IMAP over SSL,
and internal mail servers were moved to SMTP over TLS, IIRR.

there is so much info that you can gather about a system from reading the
daily/weekly/monthly system and security reports =)

the two senior SysAdmins kept encrypted copies of all the root passwords,
the other SysAdmins had access to what they were allowed by ssh...
this does make it tricky from time to time, but there were procedures
in place to handle such events ... 

but it all worked on the premise that, if an un-authorised person could
log in as a user to a server, then they could as well easily gain root
access and the whole systems was compromised. there was only one system
compromised a couple of years ago[2]. thats why we used this ssh setup
and only ran required serives in external interfaces, loopback firewalling,
paranoid mail servers, etc...

cheers,

Kim

[1] the finance industry are a very paranoid bunch =)
[2] by the senior sysadmin to prove the point...
