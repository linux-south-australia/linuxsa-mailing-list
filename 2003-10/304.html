tower. Has a floppy drive and onboard video and sound, but no memory or hard 
disk or anything like that. $100 or offers.

There is also some audio componentry that you guys might be interested in.

AntiSkip) and Single Tape Deck in the one unit. Very high quality and 
professional device, retails for over $1000, will sell for offers around $400.

BASS - Offers around $100

- Technics Stereo Integrated Amplifier - 175 Watts per Channel, a variety of 
inputs and 2x Left and Right Outputs - VERY good amplifier, takes whatever you 
throw at it. Offers around $150 

Well, that's about it for now. I have too much stuff and too little room, and 
am not happy to be getting rid of it all, but unfortunately, sacrifices must be 
made.

Look forward to hearing from you all!

- Adam
