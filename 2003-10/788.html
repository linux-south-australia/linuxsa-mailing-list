Been using it for a while now on several machines. In general I really
like it, not ever having to worry about installing a new version is very
nice.

It also has a large portage of packages, all source built (there are a
few bins) and including practically every app/game you would ever want.

It requires a Internet connection to download it sources and to update
it's portage. This takes a fair time on a slow connection and should be
done fairly regularly so I would only use it if you don't mind tying up
your phone line or if you have broadband.

The faster the machine you run it on, the better. Installing/upgrading
on a sub Ghz machine can be a little painfully (think days of
compiling).

If you have ever used the BSD ports system you will see similarities.
Debian's apt is also a bit similar, though mainly binary.
