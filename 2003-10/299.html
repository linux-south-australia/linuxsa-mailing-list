hey all,

look, noone would dream of using the word 'nigger' nowadays, its
associated with unimaginably horrenous racism and oppression and
cruelty. oddly enough, its a derivative of niger, meaning black. you
could argue that it shouldnt offend anyone accordingly, and, if the
intention wasnt there to insult, it cant be bad.

but you are wrong. language is about the meaning we agree to give words.
gay used to mean happy, now its become about sexuality and associated 
specifically with the homosexual/lesbian/transgender community. if it 
is used in a perjorative sense to deride something, that derision 
attachs to its current accepted usage. intention may  mean something 
different, but intention doesnt necessarily translate into action.  

its about respecting others. i am certain no ill was meant of it, but i 
am saddened by the current counterculture mentality of derision where 
'gay' is lame (and hence being idetified as gay is somehow wrong) and 
women are 'bitches'. its all too easy to fall into appalling vernacular. 
so dont.

its not about being precious and hypersensitive. its about respecting
otehrs and their differences. if something is identified as hurtful,
dont use it. simple really!

if only the world could do it more often:)

now,ca we PLEASE get back to teh important flaming, like why emacs users
are so wrong, and vim is the r0xX0r?;)))

(note the intended usage of counterculture script kiddie language to
prove my 'hip, happening' status amongst you young uns?;)  )

r:) &lt;- no gruumpy devil today!

ps usage of the word microsoft as a substitute for lame may be
acceptable on this list. but lame seems to be a perfectly good word to
describe, well, lame!

pps dsl has been remarkably reestrained, considering. targetting him
seems a little harsh. i was far grumpier. now, moving back to it all - 

debian is the one true distro! you are all wrong if you dont use it!
nyah nyah!

MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
