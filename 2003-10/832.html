Hi Jordan,
    Being a Bash guru is great, but you would get much better results by
using the right tool for the right job. I would strongly recommend you learn
Perl, which is very similar in alot of ways to bash, but it works better
with Apache, and also has security built in for running as CGI scripts. It
also wouldn't hurt on your resume if you could write bash AND perl scripts.

    The problem here really is not how you do the job, but how secure is it?
Even if you only use these scripts internally, there is not much to stop a
disgruntled employee from exploiting a bash loophole and doing serious
damage to your setup.

    Perl is not very difficult to learn, and apart from being extremely
useful for other things in a network environment, it is probably the leading
CGI language used on the internet before asp and php. In a dynamic web page
environment, perl has many powerful features that most other scripting
languages don't have, like on the fly graphics generation and database
manipulation.

    I would strongly recommend you download some info on perl, or if you are
feeling rich, purchase a book. The book that I learnt perl and CGI from was
on O'Reilly book called "CGI Programming with Perl" by Guelich, Gundavaram &
Birznieks. The ISBN 1-56592-419-3. This book is excellent and will teach you
everything you need to know about CGI, including Security, Graphics,
Databases and other data presentation and manipulation like JavaScript. It
will teach you how to program CGI pages, the traps and some tips about how
to make your pages secure, and how HTML does things not usually covered in a
bash or other scripting language tutorial. The book also covers email and
XML, debugging techniques and optimisation. I don't remember how much I paid
for my copy, but whatever it was it was well worth the money, you won't be
sorry.

    Finally, another big thing about perl is CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network. This is a place where you can go to avoid reinventing the
wheel in your scripts. Chances are that if it is a common thing, it is in
CPAN. I have also heard that CPAN modules are now available as rpm packages
to make them much easier to use. I am yet to find those on the net yet, but
I haven't really gone looking for them either. I hope this has helped out.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: html forms and bash scripts.


&gt; I have apache executing bash scripts on a machine and echoing the
&gt; results back to the browser in html.  Works great.  Is there an easy way
&gt; to pass information from a html form to a bash script as a variable?  Am
&gt; I missing something obvious?  I've tried a few things and googled around
&gt; and can't seem to come up with anything.  Am I going about this the
&gt; wrong way - should I learn perl/something else?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
