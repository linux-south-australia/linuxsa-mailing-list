&gt; &gt; ... why don't you turn the
&gt; &gt; preemptive scheduling off and see whether that makes a difference? If it
&gt; &gt; were causing lots of people similar pain, I'm sure it would have been said
&gt; &gt; on the linux kernel mailing list [on which I lurk].
&gt; 
&gt; Im now running 2.4.0-test9 with preemptive turned off, and everying is back up to speed.
&gt; 
&gt; So my original question still stands:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; If it is because of the preemptive scheduling, im kinda wondering why
&gt; &gt; &gt; its being labled as such a big feature of 2.6.0 when obviously it wont
&gt; &gt; &gt; suit everyone.

Surely pre-emptive multitasking is what makes servers like Apache, MySQL, PgSQL,
Tomcat pretty handy at dealing with squillions of web pages per second?

Anything that wants to deal with lots of processes, lots of processors,
lots of transactions, lot of concurrent connections, lots of I/O.
 
Which is a totally different ball park to a single thread hogging all the CPU.

&gt; And another:
&gt; Its appears to slow down CPU intensive tasks... so what does it speed up?
&gt; Ive heard its meant to help with responsiveness, but i didnt see that 
&gt; effect at all, even the opposite.

I would image that measuring responsiveness on a commandline or even a gui
for a single user would be a difficult job. I recon that they are focusing
on the (internet & NAS) server end of the scale going in this direction.

cheers,

Kim
