Matthew,

&gt; you'd never want to have to explain what you were doing out the front of
&gt; Adam at 2am in the morning with a laptop.

It reminds me of the time when I was at Murray Bridge with some other
friends/colleagues and our car had broken down, full of computer gear
outside of Teen Challenge (which had just burned down a few months
beforehand).

AND one of them happened to be in jeans, black shirt and black beanie [it
was winter] and smoking outside.

Needless to say we attracted the attention of some local police officers.

:-)

DSL

(Oh, I happened to be up at Murray Bridge installing a network. About 6-8
hours of work, all volunteer, not necessarily easy and for a charity. I
didn't have to do this; I wasn't required to. It wasn't a WFTD placement
either.)
