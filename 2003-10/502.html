&gt; Hi there,
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you don't mind me asking.
&gt; 
&gt; What is: "output decoder",

There's more than one way to decompress a MP3; XMMS has several output decoders (i.e. 
'plugins') available, which all have different characteristics; MAD for example has much richer 
sound quality, but it uses more CPU.

You'd also have output decoders for things such as MIDI files, MOD/XM files, SID files, list goes 
on.

&gt; "ALSA" and what do you actually mean by 

Man, you've never heard of ALSA?

<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/">http://www.alsa-project.org/</A>

ALSA leaves OSS for dead.  In fact, ALSA now replaces OSS in 2.6, leaving OSS as "depreciated".

&gt; "..a decent playlist" ?         I thought a playlist would just be a 
&gt; playlist.

This becomes more evident the larger playlist you have; I've usually got at least 20K items in my 
playlist, and the efficiency of the better ones is brilliant.

iTunes, for example, has a fantastic playlist; different ways of sorting, "smart" playlists (i.e. 
filters into a metaplaylist), listing by genre/year/artist, list goes on.  They seem completely 
useless at first, but if you've got properly tagged MP3's, you can't live without them.

&gt; Thanks
