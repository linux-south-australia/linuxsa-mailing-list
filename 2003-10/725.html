Mark,

&gt; I have been running the 2.4.22 kernel for sometime now, but have now
&gt; changed over to 2.6.0-test9.

Oh.

&gt; It has been compiled with the preemptive option.

I see.

&gt; I am now finding that CPU intensive tasks like bzip2, lame, oggenc, etc
&gt; are now all running a fair bit slower than what they used to under
&gt; 2.4.22.

Ouch.

&gt; Is this because of the preemptive scheduling, or would you think
&gt; somthing else is wrong?

I've used 2.4.22 with and without preemptive scheduling. To be perfectly
honest, for my usage it didn't appear to make too much of a difference
either way.

&gt; If it is because of the preemptive scheduling, im kinda wondering why
&gt; its being labled as such a big feature of 2.6.0 when obviously it wont
&gt; suit everyone.

I'd be more inclined to take a look at precisely how you've compiled the
kernel. Also, make sure that your hard drive is using DMA (if it's not,
then that will slow everything down).

And seeing you've compiled it yourself (!) why don't you turn the
preemptive scheduling off and see whether that makes a difference? If it
were causing lots of people similar pain, I'm sure it would have been said
on the linux kernel mailing list [on which I lurk].
