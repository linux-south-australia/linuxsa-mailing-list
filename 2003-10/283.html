&gt; &gt; As soon as it got childish you could have stopped reading it.
&gt; &gt; Your choice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I learnt something new today 'gay' can also now mean 'lame'. 'Lame' used
&gt; &gt; to mean you were limping but it obviously has a new meaning now too as
&gt; &gt; in pathetic, stupid etc.
&gt; &gt;

&gt;
&gt;Actually Robyn, I think the lame and pathetic applies to the sad sacks
&gt;who use the word in that way.
&gt;
&gt;Lets see - substitute their name in that scsenario - do they like the
&gt;use of something describing them as an inference of
&gt;failure/uselessness/'lameness'?

I think its being used in the reverse sense. To my 14yo, if something is 
good its 'bad'. If he reckons something is really good, its 'sick'. So like 
it or not, language usage is changing and like every generation since Adam 
we just going to have to accept that the next generation is going to 
'bugger' up our language. Don't be shocked and it isn't pathetic either. 
Its just change. I note that Damien was making no judgements, he just used 
a word in a manner common to him and his peers. So tomorrow morning, when I 
get up 'wid da birdies', I think I'll be joyous, happy and gay - with my 
preferred use of the word. :)


&gt;Its pathetic, and I'm shocked to see it here in this forum. I thought
&gt;there was more intelligence here than that.
&gt;
&gt;And anyone who wants to bitch at me for posting this - go ahead. I'm
&gt;pretty steamed about it, and happy to respond to grumbles accordingly.
