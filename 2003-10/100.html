How do I start?

Take a deep breath...

Someone once told me "the difference between the ordinary and the 
extraordinary, is that little extra" and I am trying to brainstorm a way 
to help the little extra make its way into Free/Open Source Software.

I have had a

So, can we come up with a set of "best practices" that developers should 
use when contributing software to the Commons?  I was hoping to come up 
with a voluntary system of self assessment instead of outside criticsm, 
because we are talking about work voluntarily contributed to the 
Commons. I was also hoping to have the system be self apparent to the 
end user.


So far all I have is, is an idea of placing a very visible standardized 
set of notes on the project page. Note that they are really a set of 
best practices that the author will voluntarily answer in the project 
page note. If a standardized format were followed, people would know by 
reading the notice, what practices were used during development. 

So my brainstorm so far has created this list:


* What did the software do for the author ?
* Did the author intend for it to be fully functional, or a building 
block for something else
* If the author tested the software
* What flavor of Unix the software was tested in
* Versions and Md5's of the software and dependent packages
* Where and what the key configuration files are
* Who else tested the Software
* What flavors of Unix were tested
* Common problems
* % of features not provided by GUI
* A committment to make GUI's easily available to a GUI user in an 
intuitive "GUIesce"manner. The GUI is only activated if a user requests 
it, such as not to intrude upon the desktop space of those that do not 
want one.


I also started to think of a company that would be paid to test the 
software, kind of like Comsumer Reports. This would be publicly funded, 
along with another company paid to fix the errors reported by the first 
company.



Please add comments,  ideas, etc.
