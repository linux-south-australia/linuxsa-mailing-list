Damien,

&gt; David, David, David...

Repetition of my name only increses the chance that I'll be picked up by a
search engin.

&gt; Would you like me to paste the contents of the website in here? Maybe I
&gt; can give you a quick summary so you don't have to do the hard task of
&gt; pasting a link into a web browser.

If you like.

&gt; It is not meant to replace the packaging format of a distribution, but
&gt; rather be complimentary to it.

Oh?

&gt; It is intended to be distribution independent, i.e. a single package
&gt; works on any distribution. Tell me how I can configure a tool to let me
&gt; download packages from the Debian distribution onto my Mandrake box?

What's wrong with apt? You're obviously not familiar with it.

&gt; It is intended for third party applications, games, proprietary
&gt; software, etc (like the loki game installer, but more general). On the
&gt; TODO list they are planning "self-contained" packages, that include the
&gt; entire installer, not just a stub that downloads the installer, as well
&gt; as interactive installs that allow the user to choose where they want
&gt; the package to go, and various other options.

I see.

&gt; So... what's the apt command for installing something as non root into a
&gt; directory of my choosing, for a package I've already downloaded (that
&gt; may or may not have all of its dependencies met)?

I see.

 apt-get install damien-uern

 apt-cache show damien-uern

 "This package will install regardless of your security levels or
  policies."

&gt; (P.S: How was that for a first flame? :)

LOL

Quite weak really. You've advocated that we should drop all security in
favour of usability.
