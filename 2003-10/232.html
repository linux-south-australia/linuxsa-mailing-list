I am pleased to announce that Adelaide Institute of TAFE has now officially 
registered the domain edulug.org
edulug.org will be the host for new initiatives by Adelaide TAFE IT Studies 
Dept and will be the portal for OSS training and information.

The site will be managed by students, for students, with support form staff 
and hopefully with expert input from Linuxsa contributors.

As a supporting role, we have started a TAFE linux  users group (although 
we will cover all aspects of OSS) and we will encourage self
development, student presentations and peer support across schools, TAFE's 
and VET sectors.

We are developing monthly meetings/learning-workshops be based on core 
Linux/OSS/BSD topics, eg
installation, configuration, X, security, DHCP, DNS, SAMBA, MAIL, and so 
on, etc etc.

We will try to keep it related to real-world skills needed by organisations 
to integrate and take advantage of OSS and
last but not least it will ALL be practical based, e.g. each monthly 
meeting/workshop will be a hands on affair so that topics covered will be 
done with people's
hands on the keyboards! Not only will you have access to knowledgeable 
people, you will be able to try, break it and fix it.

Needless to say all comments about our direction, monthly workshops and 
offers of assistance are warmly welcomed.

Further news about our progress will be made available to LinuxSA as we go.
