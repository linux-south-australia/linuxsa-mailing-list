&lt;input value=0.22&gt;
I've always said that windows has a place. it's been the OS for newbies, 
because there's a lot less to configure and break, it hides most of the 
workings from you.
on the other hand, not knowing how it works can increase the chance of 
something going wrong when someone says "hey, all these .dlls are clogging up 
my directory, and I never load them".
if you're not careful with what you do, running in linux as root (as many 
newbies will all the time, and others at least some of the time) is like 
playing with a loaded gun, while running in windows as admin (which you 
always are in the personal range) you at least have a smaller caliber.
and yes, as soon as you use linux as a normal user, you have most of your 
dangerous goods confiscated.

windows has always had a place, that being easy to use and hiding the workings 
making it good for newbies, before they're ready for a real OS.
but I'm happy to say that linux's desktop with some distros is giving MS a 
real fight, so now all MS has is numbers (which means that it's still a 
default and most hardware makers aiming for desktop think only of windows) 
and the vast ammounts of money from running a monoploy and cutting corners, 
like security and stability and the like.
&lt;/input&gt;

Happy hacking
Adam
