Hi,

I just thought I would report on my experiences with the autopackage tool 
version 0.3.5. I tested the package installer by downloading a package (in 
this case Gaim 0.7.0):

<A HREF="http://www.autopackage.org/downloads/gaim/">http://www.autopackage.org/downloads/gaim/</A>

It cannot fetch dependencies from the net yet, so all packages in that 
directory are required. I ran the installer by typing the following command.

sh gaim-0.70.package

The .package file has a shell script front end, like loki's game installer. It 
found that I did not have the autopackage program on my computer and prompted 
me for my root password in order to install it. It then fetched the 
autopackage program from the net as well as the GTK2 frontend (as it had 
detected I had GTK on my system) - this was around 220K of downloads.

The installer launched the GUI front end and showed me its progress in a 
manner similar to most Windows application installers. After it had finished 
I checked to see what it had actually done.

Gaim was installed in ~/.local/bin (with libraries in ~/.local/lib and so 
forth). The reason it was in my home directory was because I ran the 
installer as a normal user (yay, local installs!). It had modified my .bashrc 
so that gaim was in my path and the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable was set. The 
package database was kept in ~/.package, which also kept an uninstall script 
for the program.

Removing all the packages installed was done with:

package remove gaim gnutls libgcrypt libgpg-error 

this also restored my .bashrc to its original state.

Overall, I think it's a very promising packaging format and should make 
installing software a lot simpler for the user. It is intended to be 
distribution-independent, and so the very same packages should install on 
SuSE, Redhat, Debian, slackware, etc etc... having a repository of cross 
distribution packages would simplify things a whole lot. I encourage anybody 
interested to check out the project (www.autopackage.org).

Cheers,

Damien
