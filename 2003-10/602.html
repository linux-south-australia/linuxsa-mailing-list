1) It was RTF, not HTML

2) Is there a practical reason for not liking HTML emails or is this a
'religious' thing? Seriously, if it actually causes problems I'll be happy
to change.

As for Crossover Office, I might give it a go if I can't get everything I
need running under WINEX.

&gt; Have a look at<A HREF="http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere">http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere</A> are lists of

apps/games and how he got them to work. Dreamweaver MX is listed. BTW, this
is one of the apps I'd like to get working and life is too short - nothing
wrong with WYSIWYG at all! Build the page then polish in text mode.

Dreamweaver certainly works, and has for ages.  Consider both commercial
versions of Wine if you want maximum compatibility; both Transgaming's WineX
for games, and Codeweavers Office for applications.

&gt; Next thing happened when I tried to load EA Cricket 2002; it came up 
&gt; with an
error message describing 'evil copy protection'. Now, I felt sure that I had
read that WINEX 3.0 had better support for SafeDisc or whatever copy
protection EA uses so this puzzled me. So is this as simple a fix as
downloading a NOCD patch for Cricket 2002 and installing it? If so, that's
interesting that the same facility by which people use to copy games
illegally and then get past the copy protection is essential to running
games which I bought legally in WINEX.
&gt; 
&gt; So, any solutions, people?:-)
