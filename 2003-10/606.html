&gt; 1) It was RTF, not HTML

Hrm, my webmail translated it back as HTML, at least.

&gt; 2) Is there a practical reason for not liking HTML emails or is this 
&gt; a 'religious' thing? Seriously, if it actually causes problems I'll 
&gt; be happy to change.

Given my dark color settings, it looks awful and is barely readable?  Mailers
such as mutt, which I also use, won't interpret it unless you feed it to
something like lynx, which most people don't bother doing.

You'll probably find a large amount of people will automatically ignore
non-plain text formatted emails sent to mailing lists.  If you want help, then
it's probably a good idea not to do it :)

&gt; As for Crossover Office, I might give it a go if I can't get 
&gt; everything I need running under WINEX.

WineX is for games.  Don't even bother trying to get complex apps running
under it, you're wasting your time.

Look at Wine.

&gt; &gt; Have a look at<A HREF="http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere">http://frankscorner.org/index.phpThere</A> are lists of 
&gt; &gt; working
&gt; apps/games and how he got them to work. Dreamweaver MX is listed. 
&gt; BTW, this is one of the apps I'd like to get working and life is too 
&gt; short - nothing wrong with WYSIWYG at all! Build the page then 
&gt; polish in text mode.
&gt; 
&gt; Dreamweaver certainly works, and has for ages.  Consider both commercial
&gt; versions of Wine if you want maximum compatibility; both 
&gt; Transgaming's WineX for games, and Codeweavers Office for applications.

&gt; &gt; Next thing happened when I tried to load EA Cricket 2002; it came up 
&gt; &gt; with an
&gt; error message describing 'evil copy protection'. Now, I felt sure 
&gt; that I had read that WINEX 3.0 had better support for SafeDisc or 
&gt; whatever copy protection EA uses so this puzzled me. So is this as 
&gt; simple a fix as downloading a NOCD patch for Cricket 2002 and 
&gt; installing it? If so, that's interesting that the same facility by 
&gt; which people use to copy games illegally and then get past the copy 
&gt; protection is essential to running games which I bought legally in WINEX.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, any solutions, people?:-)
