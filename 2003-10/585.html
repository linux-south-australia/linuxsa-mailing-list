&gt; Flash: Mandrake Linux 9.2: How to download?
&gt; 
&gt; Mandrake Linux 9.2 was released only 7 days ago, but has already 
&gt; received many excellent reviews from the world's press. In an early 
&gt; review of Mandrake 9.2, the 'Open For Business' website (ofb.biz) 
&gt; concluded: "Mandrake Linux 9.2 exhibits a level of refinement that we 
&gt; have not previously encountered with a GNU/Linux distribution from any 
&gt; developer."
&gt; 
&gt; Over 10 Terabytes of Mandrake 9.2 ISO images have been downloaded by
&gt; MandrakeClub members so far! This huge payload proves that BitTorrent
&gt; technology is a smart choice for delivering large files to a wide audience.
&gt; 
&gt; Even still, several members have reported hitting a few snags when 
&gt; trying to download the ISOs with BitTorrent. Fortunately, all these 
&gt; issues have now been addressed, and a new 'BitTorrent FAQ' has been 
&gt; posted with solutions and suggestions:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.mandrakeclub.com/article.php?sid">http://www.mandrakeclub.com/article.php?sid</A>=1302
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you're a current Club member and still don't have Mandrake 9.2, 
&gt; be sure to read the FAQ and get busy downloading today!
&gt; 
&gt; Important note: MandrakeClub Members with 'Silver' membership and above 
&gt; can download the first three ISO images from the 9.2 PowerPack, which 
&gt; includes many proprietary applications such as Flash Player, RealPlayer, 
&gt; Acrobat Reader, Java Runtime Environment, proprietary drivers 
&gt; (winmodems, Nvidia, ATI, ADSL) and more.

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It's been a pretty disappointing experience in getting Mandrake 9.2 over
&gt; &gt; the weekend, even if you are a Mandrake Club member with access to fast
&gt; &gt; ADSL. Has anybody managed to download the 3 CD download edition?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If so would they please it along to LinuxSA Tuesday night? I'll bring a
&gt; &gt; laptop.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt; Joseph Tan
&gt; 
&gt; and for goddess sake tell me how - ive been trying for a few days with
&gt; lots of bittorrent issues...
