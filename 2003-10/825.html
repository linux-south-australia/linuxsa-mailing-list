Brenda,
 
&gt; Basically, it's apt he is bagging compared to FreeBSD's ports. He says
&gt; Debian takes too long, longer than FreeBSD, to release packages as
&gt; stable.

Debian takes a significant amount of time to produce a release that is
called "STABLE". This does not mean that those released in "UNSTABLE" are
actually, well unusable and/or unstable. An analogy might be: there is a
verb form in Ancient Egyptian which by tradition is called "the
infinitive" but it has nothing at all to do with what English or German
would term an infinitive.

&gt; But i thought Debian would be faster than FreeBSD as there's a
&gt; larger userbase and more people working on and testing packages etc.

There are thousands of more packages in Debian's apt repository. Also what
is allowed in and out of the Debian apt repository and the ports
collection is allowed under different philosophies.

&gt;I know FreeBSD has a stable development aswell as bleeding edge don't
&gt; they? Same as Debian? So, is there any real difference between packages
&gt; released for both OSs... as in newness and stability etc?

Well, yes. One set of packages is for Debian and the other for FreeBSD.
However, if I may be serious for a while, this is a pernnial question. The
best answer is:

 1. Test BOTH
 2. Whichever satisifies YOUR needs the best is obviously the best one for
    you

(2) may change as time goes on.
