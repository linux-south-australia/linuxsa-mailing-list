&gt; I would be nice if (Unix) applications were designed/setup so that
&gt; they could use private versions of libraries in case you were unable
&gt; to upgrade a system library (i.e. it's being used by something else).
&gt; I remember the java startup script used to do some hacking with dynamic
&gt; link paths for similar reasons.  At least you can have multiple versions
&gt; of Unix libraries - you can't load more than one DLL of the same name
&gt; under NT/2K no matter what version (at least, this used to be the case).

I would say it still is.

Under XP installing the new Novell client 4.9 with remote management
enabled on a machine with an old NVIDIA driver revision results in BSOD 
on boot up.

Why? Because Novell overwrites a dll file used by the NVIDIA driver
because it has the same name.

You might think this is not such a bad problem, just upgrade to the
latest NVIDIA driver. However some laptop makers use modified versions
of the NVIDIA drivers and don't update them, making it rather difficult.

Anyway enough Windows bashing

Cheers
Martin
