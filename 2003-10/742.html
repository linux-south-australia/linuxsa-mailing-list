&lt;quote who="David Fitch"&gt;
&gt; hey all,
&gt;
&gt; I've finally been informed that my work is going to pay for
&gt; me to go to the linux conf (yay!) so now I'm wondering about
&gt; taking a laptop.
&gt;
&gt; Is it worthwhile (not having been before)?
&gt; is there "hands-on" stuff or some reason it would be useful?
&gt; would I get mugged if it was running windoze?
&gt;
&gt; Dave
&gt; (yes the last one was a joke).


Hi Dave,


It's great that you're coming to LCA2004.  It will be an experience!


A laptop is definately worthwhile for many reasons - you'll be receiving a
CD full of software that corresponds to talks that you'll hear (a Knoppix
like bootable CD) so you can try stuff out.  You'll also hear about
people's latest project and you may wish to check it out and you might
like to "apt-get dist-upgrade" or similar since you'll have lots of fast
free bandwidth.  Or you might go to a BOF session, do a "cvs update", fix
some annoying bug and maybe win a prize!  Or enter the "hackfest" and
showcase your skills and maybe win a prize.  There's lots of reasons
really :-)

Lots of LCA attendees bring laptops, to the point that when the organising
committe choose the conference bag, we choose something that can
accommodate a laptop!

See you in January - the conference is only 11 weeks away...
