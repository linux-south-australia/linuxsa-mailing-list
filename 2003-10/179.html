<H1>Xinetd services and a delay with no DNS?</H1>

Hi Everyone,
I"ve been playing around with redhat 9 on a server or three and am noticing
an annoying delay which i can't seem to fix with xinetd services.

I've narrowed it down to the service trying to do a reverse DNS lookup of
the IP address, either with ident lookup (which i read but don't understand
what it is) or a normal lookup.   it has a 30 second timeout which then goes
on with it as normal.

I"ve looked at various ways to try to disable it including:
/etc/nsswitch.conf - i can get rid of DNS in the hosts entry and it goes
very quickly which is what i base my theory on.
/etc/xinetd.d - the various files i've tried disabling the logging on sucess
and failure lines to nothing or just the userid as per the manual and it
doesn't seem to make much difference.  i tried a restart of xinetd every
time i changed an entry to be sure and also killed the services running
under them (pop3 and ftp for example).
/etc/xinetd.conf - also changed this logging success/failure options as well
to no avail.
/etc/hosts - added a manual entry for my test machine and that seemed to
make it quite a bit faster but i don't really want that as a fix.

so, i'm appealing to the xinet gurus out there to help me out.    i also
have a firewall on the machine which i read may be making things much slower
to do these ident lookup things, but i wouldn't have thought so.

basically all this 'server' is a two NIC machine with NAT out etc.....

any ideas?
thanks
Matthew
