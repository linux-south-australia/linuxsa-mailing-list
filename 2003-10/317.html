&gt; Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Participating ISPs can set their own rates for access, so ask yours if
&gt; &gt; you want to know how much it'll cost (Internode is offering free access
&gt; &gt; for a while to promote the launch of the network;  Not sure about the 
&gt; &gt; others)
&gt; 
&gt; It would be kind of useful if there were some type of "recharge" type
&gt; cards like those mobile phone things. I guess that would help for
&gt; international visitors and tourists. Also, if ISP X offered a 
&gt; recharge rate better than ISP Y then that might make a good business 
&gt; proposition as well.

Heh, I design/wrote/implemented a system *exactly* like that up in Sydney 
going back a year and a half ago (...hey, didn't I tell you about this?), and 
it's been incredibly successful; never marketed it commercially, though.

If anybody's interested in it, though, feel free to give me a yell about it; 
I've been toying with the idea of GPL'ing most things I've done so far, as 
it'd be really good to have others develop on it; it'd be really nice to have 
an open source internet cafe solution, both in terms of server and client 
access (knoppix based cd-distro for clients would be really ideal, IMO).  I 
have to say that most of the Windows-based internet cafe software (at least, 
from a client perspective) is horrible.
