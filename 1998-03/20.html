Hi all,

I recently unsubscribed because I was getting to much mail and not easily 
being able to sort it.
 
I then started an account on one of my linux boxes just for the linux sa
mailing list (hence the email address) and also with a view to a html
archive (when I or someone figures out how to and has the time to) do
this.  

It sounds to me like some people would like it and some dont care.  But no
one objects to it.  It therefore would make sense to put it in the subject
field.

By the way, if anyone has a script or something that will archive the mail
into html, I would be most happy to put it in place so we get an archive
of this list happening.

Trevor.

&gt; &gt; Excellent idea.  A lot of lists are doing this now. It makes it a lot
&gt; &gt; easier to sort through mail, especially when you get 80+ a day.
&gt; 
&gt; I get a similar amount of mail, but by using filtering on the Sender:
&gt; field all my mail gets sorted.  
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming that most people use Linux to read their mail, I think
&gt; a fetchmail/procmail talk might be in order.
&gt; 
&gt; Any takers?
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW I think that we should stay with the [LinuxSA]-less headers.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
