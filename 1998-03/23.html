I don't think you understand what is being suggested.  This isn't
something that people would add to the Subject line.  It is something that
the mailing list prepends to the Subject line before it resends it.  Most
mailing lists do this, and for good reason.  If you have access to
procmail, or some other mail filtering program then great.  But many of us
don't, and for us having the mailing list listed in the subject is very
very useful.

It dosn't matter if it is [LSA], [LinuxSA], *LSA* or whatever just as long
as there is something there that identifies the mail as being from the
mailing list.
