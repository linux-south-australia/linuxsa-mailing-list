&gt;Not to mention the license agreement from Microsoft which partly says

&gt;I'm not sure what validity these license agreements have, but it sure
&gt;doesn't help your case against Microsoft if they've already said that
&gt;they don't guarantee the software to work for more than 3 months.

It has been noted since the invention of punch cards, and the fact that
puch cards dissolve in coffee, that the safest form of insurance is to
backup. Surely a succesful back-up system would constitute less of a risk,
especialy is you approach the insurance company and say, "we back-up in
such-and-such a manner and can retrieve it with such-and-such an accuracy,
so it doesn't matter *if* the software fails, just *how often*." This make
it much less platform independent, unless you want to go into which OS is
more stable. (Geoffrey - feel free to post any uptimes you may have :o] )

Expect things to fail, it's part of life.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I you spend the time showing the
insurance company rep (who theoretically wants your business) that the risk
is less beacuse of what backup policies *you* implement, and not what
software you use, you could talk reason to even a hard-core
computer-illiterate techno-phobe insurance salesperson.

&gt;(PS. please only quote the bits that are necessary for your reply,
&gt;place your response below the quoted text, and remove the LinuxSA
&gt;trailer.  There's especially no need to send 3 extra copies of the
&gt;trailer to the list.)

I wasn't going to say anything, but I might have to start a small, yet
nonetheless impressive tantrum if I see another "I agree" post.

According to the latest official figures, 43% of all
