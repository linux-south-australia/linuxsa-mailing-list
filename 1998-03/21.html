  Trevor&gt; Hi all, I recently unsubscribed because I was getting to
  Trevor&gt; much mail and not easily being able to sort it.

Until this storm erupted, I'd been averaging 3.8 emails on this group
per day (for the last 9.5 months). 
 
  Trevor&gt; I then started an account on one of my linux boxes just for
  Trevor&gt; the linux sa mailing list (hence the email address) and also
  Trevor&gt; with a view to a html archive (when I or someone figures out
  Trevor&gt; how to and has the time to) do this.

It sounds like more of you should be using emacs GNUS to read your
mail/News; it would easily sort this list out (and you could score
postings by username so you could filter out people that make dumb
suggestions all the time ;-) )

  Trevor&gt; It sounds to me like some people would like it and some dont
  Trevor&gt; care.  But no one objects to it.  It therefore would make
  Trevor&gt; sense to put it in the subject field.

  Trevor&gt; By the way, if anyone has a script or something that will
  Trevor&gt; archive the mail into html, I would be most happy to put it
  Trevor&gt; in place so we get an archive of this list happening.

Yes, there are packages available (see the following (debian) package
descriptions - I'm not saying this is an exhaustive list, but its a
good start):

Package: hypermail
Description: Create HTML archives of mailing lists
 Creates crosslinked and threaded HTML archives of mailboxes or
 mailing lists.  Can be configured to automagically update the
 archives when new messages arrive.

Package: mhonarc
Description: Mail to HTML converter
   _MHonArc_ is a Perl program for converting e-mail messages as
   specified in RFC 822 and RFC 1521 (_MIME_) to HTML.

Package: wmf
Description: Web Mail Folder
 Converting Emails to HTML and make index files (author, data, subject,
 thread). Of course there are other programs making the same, but here are
 some points which not all have:
        - correct threading without level limitation
        - quoted-printable text encoding
        - HomePage-Hyperlink (X-URL)
        - faces support
        - breake indexes in different pages to make them smaller
          (don't break between threads)
        - index time limitation (older mail disappears from the index)
        - frame support

  Matt&gt; I get a similar amount of mail, but by using filtering on the
  Matt&gt; Sender: field all my mail gets sorted.

  Matt&gt; Assuming that most people use Linux to read their mail, I
  Matt&gt; think a fetchmail/procmail talk might be in order.

  Matt&gt; Any takers?

  Matt&gt; FWIW I think that we should stay with the [LinuxSA]-less
  Matt&gt; headers.

Ditto that one.
