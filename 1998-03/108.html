go through with it anyway.
it certainly lives up to it's screenshots... it is a tad unstable... and
quite a bit slow, but besides that it's generally froody :)
as far as I can tell, if you don't like it, it doesn't leave any scars to
your system... it's initiated with the exec command in your .xconfigrc
or whatever it is in either the default or your home directory, like other
window managers.

speaking of xwindows, mine isn't in too good health.
whenever running either eterm, xterm, or any other text based program (eg
pine, ncftp), it sometimes locks the system up completely. this is a
random occurence, and only seems to happen while I have one of the
aforementioned programs loaded.

any comments, ideas, or help would be appreciated :)
