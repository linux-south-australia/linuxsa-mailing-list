Alex
I use samba on several machines - it's great.
the interaction between permissions, locking etc. is tricky but what you
are after is pretty straight forward  - "create mode" allows you to
change the mask samba applies on top of the usual permission masks. by
default it is set to 0750 - not much use to you!!!
in a redhat environment a better setting is 775 which matches the usual
umask.

Samba also does domething funny with the user execute bit which it turns
on for ordinary files - It uses it to simulate the fat "archive" bit
which unix doesn't have. There is a setting somewhere to turn this off
but you don't need to worry about it (it doesn't do any harm) 

My public directory settings on my home networks server are:

[public]
   comment = Public Stuff
   path = /home/samba
   public = yes
   writable = yes
   printable = no
   write list = @root
   create mode = 0775

note: I restrict writing to persons in the root group on this machine

on my office server I restrict access to the staff group (@staff)

[public]
   comment = Public Stuff
   path = /home/samba
   public = yes
   writable = yes
   printable = no
   write list = @staff
   create mode = 0775

I've  set the unix permissions for the samba directory to match as 

drwxrwsr-x  16 root     staff        1024 Jan 30 15:10 samba

note the group is set to staff  (chown .staff /home/samba)
and  the set gid in on to enable files created in the directory to be 
modifiable by others in the staff group not just the person who placed
them there
 (chmod g+s /home/samba)

you most likely are looking for something in /home/httpd/html... and
might like to have a group  called webauthors instead of the whole staff
- principles are the same. 

hope this helps

regards
Adrian Butterworth
