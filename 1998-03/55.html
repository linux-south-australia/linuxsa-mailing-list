&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a need to allow Windows 95 clients to log into an NT File
&gt; server using VPN and PPTP over the internet.... I want to do this
&gt; using our linux box which is currently acting as our internet
&gt; gateway/firewall... is this possible?
&gt; 
&gt; Detail:
&gt; 
&gt; We have an NT box, which is our main file-server and logon server
&gt; within our building... people sit down at their windows 95 computers
&gt; in the morning, and log into this server in order to have access to
&gt; their home drives and shared client directories... this is all done
&gt; using straightfordard Windows NT networking.  However, we also have a
&gt; linux box which is acting as our gateway to the internet... this is
&gt; primarily used as a proxy server for providing desktop web-browsing
&gt; services and ftp services to each of the windows 95 desktops with only
&gt; the linux proxy having a valid internet ip address (internal ip's are
&gt; made-up).  However what we want to do now, is to allow for people to
&gt; log into our NT server over the internet, via the linux internet
&gt; gateway, so that it would be *as though* they had logged in via
&gt; Windows NT RAS or from within our building itself, and therefore were
&gt; able to print to the printers on our intranet, or access their files
&gt; on the file-server... as I understand it, it could be done if we
&gt; replaced the linux box with NT Server running Ms-Proxy server and then
&gt; ran Routing and Remote Access Server on this machine... this would
&gt; allow win95 clients to log in as though they were making a RAS
&gt; connection except that it would be using an IP number rather than a
&gt; telephone number... however, I want to avoid using NT if I can, so is
&gt; there anyway that this can be done using the linux proxy?  Is there a
&gt; linux product that could be used to allow people to log into the
&gt; intranet over the internet and be active as though they had logged in
&gt; on a local machine on the intranet?
&gt; 
&gt; The reason that we want to do this *rather* than simply using RAS to
&gt; dial-in to the NT server using a normal telephone line is that often
&gt; the people dialing in will be doing so from interstate or overseas,
&gt; which makes the telephone connection hugely expensive... we want to
&gt; avoid this if possible, and thus utilise the internet as the medium
&gt; for connecting to our network...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks and regards
