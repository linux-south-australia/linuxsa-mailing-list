On the subject of Ralph Nader:

&gt;  &gt; Maybe someone who has knowledge of Mr Nader can email the list
&gt;  &gt; and tell us how he fits into the bigger IT industry picture.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I know he doesn't fit into "the bigger IT industry picture"
&gt; at all -- He's what the US media calls a "consumer advocate."  Think
&gt; of "Choice" magazine compressed down into one man's head and you'll
&gt; have hit the nail on the head (so to speak).
&gt; 
&gt; ... which is to say that although people on this list who read his
&gt; comments might very well agree with them, the fact that Mr. Nader
&gt; wants them to happen doesn't even begin to suggest that they actually
&gt; *will* happen.

Then again, nobody believed that safety in cars was marketable when he
was campaigning for the inclusion of seat belts.  There was a time
when Detroit resisted seat belts vigorously.  Today try and find a
medium to large sized car without an airbag!


Cheers,
