Hi David,

you wrote:

&gt; Basically the problem is that to get Linux to do anything useful
&gt; typically requires adding things to the kernel...

Really??  My laptop is a very useful Linux machine, and I haven't
added anything to the kernel that came with my Linux distribution.

&gt; which constitutes
&gt; "modifying" the product... If the system fails for whatever reason,
&gt; there is nobody to blame but the person/company that made the
&gt; modifications... hence, an insurance company is unlikely to insure your
&gt; system (which would be necessary if u r going to use this to set up
&gt; systems for clients - unless u r big enough to simply wear the risk of
&gt; law-suit yourself or as a company)

I don't understand what difference an insurance company would see
between Windows 95 supplied by Microsoft, and Slackware supplied by
Walnut Creek or Red Hat Linux supplied by Red Hat Software?  Or is
there only a difference if I modify the kernel?

&gt; If u r big enough, u can do that, but for most companies of a small to
&gt; medium size, the risk is too great... at least with microsoft, u have
&gt; somone to blame if the software fails... and u can sue them... (which
&gt; makes an insurance company more comfortable - since they can offset
&gt; their risks...)

Microsoft -- someone to blame??  I don't think so.  I know very little
about law, but from what I've learnt from TV, the company with the
most money/with the most lawyers is the one that wins the court case.
How many companies have ever even attempted to sue Microsoft when (not
if :-) Microsoft's software fails?

Not to mention the license agreement from Microsoft which partly says
that they only warrant their software to act like the manual says it
should for 90 days after you get it and in any case, their liability
won't be more than you paid for it.

I'm not sure what validity these license agreements have, but it sure
doesn't help your case against Microsoft if they've already said that
they don't guarantee the software to work for more than 3 months.

(PS. please only quote the bits that are necessary for your reply,
place your response below the quoted text, and remove the LinuxSA
trailer.  There's especially no need to send 3 extra copies of the
trailer to the list.)
