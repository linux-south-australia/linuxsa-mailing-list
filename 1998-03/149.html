&gt; 0x310 is correct.  Although the base address of the card is 0x300, the

&gt; 
&gt; If you're interested, the relevant code is in wd.c:

&gt; I presume you assigned an IP address to the card with ifconfig even
&gt; though you didn't say so in your message?  That would certainly cause
&gt; no packets to be sent out from the card.

I sussed it out eventually. I now have IP Masquerading, POP/SMTP mail
clients, Samba (thanks to the APC article :), the works.

I even made a couple of little Winnows icons that turn the internet off
and on from the windows box for the less enlightened members of the
family :)

It appears that my problem was that I was trying to assign 192.168.1.X to
the machines. They are working now on 192.168.0.X Not understanding much
about networking, I can see now why this doesn't work (netmast
255.255.255.0?) but I'm sure I've setup Windows TCP/IP networks this
way... maybe I screwed up elsewhere.

After I got it working I had a nightmare problem with windows trying to
dial out to ping local hosts - even with a hosts file in c:\windows - I
removed dial up networking and it would still dial out!!! I fixed it using
the usual method - nuke and reinstall.

Par for the course :)
