&gt; I was wondering if anybody here had used various releases of linux on
&gt; their systems and could give an unbiased recommendation to me as to which
&gt; release io should use.
&gt;
&gt; I have used RedHat 4.2 and Slackware 96 (august) and found that i
&gt; prefered to use the slackware release. I was wondering what RedHat 5.0
&gt; was like and what the newer releases of slackware were like.
&gt;
&gt; I would like to hear comments/sugestions about what metro-x is and how it
&gt; stacks up against other window managers/x-servers which ever it is.
&gt;
&gt; Is there any CD`s available taht contain newly released uptodate versions
&gt; of linux software available at minimal cost.

First and foremost, I tended to prefer the Slackware release, mainly for the
Ncurses setup and pkgtool utilities, I wasn't very keen on using X for
everything as RedHat seems to prefer.
I would be interested to know if RedHat have remedied this situation in
release 5.

As for Metro-X from what I can work out it's an X-server with a few extra
accelerated features.  I personally am comfortable using the standard server
for my card (Diamond Stealth 64 S3) as it seems to work flawlessly.

Infomagic release a set of CDs every 3-4 months for a cost of about $40-$50
and it generally includes slackwarte, RedHat and the Debian releases.  Plus
a near complete copy of the sunsite online file archives.

I'f I'm wrong on any of the above information I would appreciate correction
as I'm still reasonably new to Linux.

Tim Aslat
