Basically the problem is that to get Linux to do anything useful
typically requires adding things to the kernel... which constitutes
"modifying" the product... If the system fails for whatever reason,
there is nobody to blame but the person/company that made the
modifications... hence, an insurance company is unlikely to insure your
system (which would be necessary if u r going to use this to set up
systems for clients - unless u r big enough to simply wear the risk of
law-suit yourself or as a company)

If u r big enough, u can do that, but for most companies of a small to
medium size, the risk is too great... at least with microsoft, u have
somone to blame if the software fails... and u can sue them... (which
makes an insurance company more comfortable - since they can offset
their risks...)

&gt; 
&gt; Under the GNU licence would it be possible for a company to embed a 
&gt; piece of rubbish in the code, which they could call their own? They 
&gt; could then sell *that* to the customer (bundling Linux along with it,
&gt; of 
&gt; course).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I have found that one of the major difficulties in implementing linux
&gt; 
&gt; in
&gt; &gt;a corporate environment is not specifically a technical issue, rather
&gt; a
&gt; &gt;political and financial one... the problem is this... Since Linux is 
&gt; not
&gt; &gt;a commercial operating system, with a defined 'owner', Insurance
&gt; &gt;comapnies _will not_ insure it... This is something of a problem if u
&gt; r
&gt; &gt;an out-sourcing IT company wanting to implement systems for
&gt; clients...
&gt; &gt;basically, u cannot get insurance unless u either use a commercial
&gt; &gt;flavour of un*x or use windows nt (which despite the technical
&gt; &gt;difficulties - of which there are many) nonetheless has a defined 
&gt; owner,
&gt; &gt;and is therefore acceptable to an insurance company....

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 	computer makers will endorse UnixWare 7.0 as the 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 	standard Unix operating system for Intel-based 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Unfortunately Linux does not have the marketing might to get 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that comment.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the statement.  Linux is not *the* 
&gt; standard
&gt; &gt;&gt; Unix OS for Intel based hardare; in fact it's not even *a* Unix.  
&gt; Only
&gt; &gt;&gt; when Linux passes the SVVS (or whatever it's called now), will it 
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; any genuine stake in the Unix market.  For now it has as much stake
&gt; 
&gt; as
&gt; &gt;&gt; Apple should expect with their new (yet to be released) Mach based 
&gt; OS.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; On the other hand, do we care about Unix(tm)?  For me it's enough 
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; Linux is a Unix-like OS.
