This is getting way off topic and would be better discussed in another
forum but :

&gt;  
&gt;  I've heard stories about so-called 'Internet Service Providers' denying
&gt;  certain traffic to their users, but I didn't think it was widespread,
&gt;  more just an attempt by some small time providers to force proxy use to

It may interest you to know that nearly all providers directly deny
access to port 80 outbound - guess what even the 'big' so-called ISPs !
Telstra are presently testing Cisco Cache engines that transparently proxy
a web request - that is they rewrite a request for data to a proxy cache
that fetches the pages.

I know of a lot of ISPs who use cisco policy routing and squid configured
in accel/cache mode with linux transparent proxy to do the same thing.
It is quite reliable and (if done right) will lead to better QoS to the
user.

&gt;  conserve bandwidth (which often they have too little of ;-) Apparently
&gt;  the telco/cable systems do this also, one can only imagine why ... I'd
&gt;  be interested to hear in the summary whether the pricing is for an
&gt;  Internet connection, or just certain services behind a firewall (for
&gt;  option 2, what services/ports are enabled ....) 

When you consider that 40% of what a large group of users look at can be
stored on 20 gig of disk caches are a cost effective way to povide
internet access in a country where WAN costs and per byte charging make it
hard to do the crazy deals people see in the US though for some stupid
reason expect here !

Mind you plently of ISPs have tried to do the crazy deals - 9 have now
gone broke in 20 months in SA alone !
