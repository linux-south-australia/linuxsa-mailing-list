&gt; It has been noted since the invention of punch cards, and the fact that
&gt; puch cards dissolve in coffee, that the safest form of insurance is to
&gt; backup. Surely a succesful back-up system would constitute less of a risk,
&gt; especialy is you approach the insurance company and say, "we back-up in
&gt; such-and-such a manner and can retrieve it with such-and-such an accuracy,
&gt; so it doesn't matter *if* the software fails, just *how often*." This make
&gt; it much less platform independent, unless you want to go into which OS is
&gt; more stable. (Geoffrey - feel free to post any uptimes you may have :o] )

I'm sure many of you have heard this before, but I do like telling it
:-).

The reliability of our production web server for the last few years
has only been limited by the reliability of our electricity supply
company; our maximum uptime was 327 days, that being the duration
between blackouts.

&gt; &gt;(PS. please only quote the bits that are necessary for your reply,
&gt; &gt;place your response below the quoted text, and remove the LinuxSA
&gt; &gt;trailer.  There's especially no need to send 3 extra copies of the
&gt; &gt;trailer to the list.)
&gt; 
&gt; I wasn't going to say anything, but I might have to start a small, yet
&gt; nonetheless impressive tantrum if I see another "I agree" post.

I agree.
