&gt;&gt; I was wondering if anybody here had used various releases of linux on
&gt;&gt; their systems and could give an unbiased recommendation to me as to which
&gt;&gt; release io should use.
&gt;
&gt;First and foremost, I tended to prefer the Slackware release, mainly for the
&gt;Ncurses setup and pkgtool utilities, I wasn't very keen on using X for
&gt;everything as RedHat seems to prefer.
&gt;I would be interested to know if RedHat have remedied this situation in
&gt;release 5.

I agree. After running a single slackware server from the beginning,
we tried Red Hat 4.1 (just released at the time) when it came 
time to build another one.
However, (and this might just be me) the differences between
the two seemed quite significant. From the weird "user-is-his-group"
group system to the fact that (like Timothy said) Metro-X is
pushed as being ALMOST NECESSARY.

Keep in mind that I don't even run X-windows on any of the
slackware servers we run (5 of them now). The whole use
of a GUI (that is only used on the console) on an ISP server
(that I mostly work on remotely anyway) seemed like a waste
of resources. I do most of my work from my Windoze95 office
machine (on a standard dial-up) and walk around to the console
just for reboots and such.

Personally, this was enough for me to format over Redhat and start again
with Slackware. Not to mention the amount of "open-source" and
sunsite software/daemons that are available as compared with
sourcing out RPMs (this is MOHI, I could be proven wrong there ;-)

The synopsis I have derived (which is also MOHI) is that:

-If you can't live without your GUI, better get RedHat.
(Metro does has more functionality to it than XFree)

-If you know the commands (and the filesystem), at least give
Slackware a go. (It is pretty damn reliable)

Anyway, speaking as a fellow "newbie-guru" (neither one nor the other :-),
that's my 2 cents worth.
Metro-X-patriots can feel free to dispute anything I've written,
but I am just voicing what I've observed (in our situation).

Regards,
-Daniel
