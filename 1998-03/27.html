&gt; I was wondering if anybody here had used various releases of linux on 
&gt; their systems and could give an unbiased recommendation to me as to which 
&gt; release io should use.

I'll try to stay away from this :).

&gt; I have used RedHat 4.2 and Slackware 96 (august) and found that i 
&gt; prefered to use the slackware release. I was wondering what RedHat 5.0 
&gt; was like and what the newer releases of slackware were like.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to hear comments/sugestions about what metro-x is and how it 
&gt; stacks up against other window managers/x-servers which ever it is.

Metro-X is an X server, provided with the Red Hat Linux Official Boxed
Set as an alternative to XFree, but for most video cards, you will
find that XFree runs better than Metro-X.  The advantage of purchasing
Metro-X even if you don't use it is that Metro Link are big supporters
of the XFree project, so you help the development of XFree.  Metro
Link have already donated their dynamic loading technology and their
multi-head stuff to the XFree project.
