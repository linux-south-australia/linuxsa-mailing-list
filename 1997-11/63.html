"Andrew Allison" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:aallison@eleceng.adelaide.edu.au">aallison@eleceng.adelaide.edu.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt; I look forward to the day when products of equivalent, or better, 
&gt; functionality to Excell, Word or Access become available for LINUX. 

So do I!  Microsoft have become far too powerful for my taste, and I
look forward to the day when there are credible alternatives to all of
their products.  If those alternatives are available for Linux, well
that is just so much better!

On a side note, those of us interested in the GUI wars will have noted
a frequent pattern over the last 10 years, namely Apple does something
and then Microsoft does something similar.  I find it curious that
Microsoft released Win-NT quite some time ago, and despite that I hate
that it binds the windowing system so closely with the OS, and that I
find it incomprehensible to administer, the OS kernel actually is quite
good.  I think you could make Win-NT feel quite like Unix (in fact there
are a couple of organisations who have done exactly that.)

But I digressed.  What I find interesting is that Apple's replacement
for MacOS, Rhapsody, is Mach with an Macintosh like Window system and
with a Finder like file manager.  I think I'm not contravening any
confidentiality agreement by saying this in public: I personally think
that the current user interface of Rhapsody is much poorer than on MacOS,
but of course it's still early days and so they have a time to make it
better.

Oh, I digressed again.  Having had an opportunity to walk away from toy
operating systems, Microsoft seem to have chosen to bury Win-NT in the
mire that is Windows, and then to have further clouded the issue by
releasing a cut down version, Windows 95, which is yet another toy
operating system.  Now we see Apple almost ready to release a brand new
one for the Macintosh, and under the bonnet it's Unix, or something close
enough that we'll all just love it.

I have been saying, for many years now, that Unix lost it's opportunity
to be a serious desktop operating system because Macintosh and Windows
had the market sewn up.  Well it seems that I might (happily) be proven
wrong.  By promoting a Unix-like environment in a serious desktop
appliance, Apple might just give the whole Unix industry the inertia and
direction needed to make Unix work on the desktop.  To explain, briefly:
Unix lacks serious desktop applications, it lacks a single GUI (sadly
it has so many different GUI's that it confuses the world at large), and
it lacks print technology.

That last point is important, and I want to explain it.  If I invent a
new kind of printer, I only have to write a driver to make it work with
every Windows or Macintosh application; but with Unix, every application
will need to be rewritten to support my printer.  Ghostscript is close
to what is needed, but it's not quite right.  I should be able to write
my X program so that it opens a window using a printer device context
instead of a display device context, and use all of the standard X
primitives in order to render a printed page.  I shouldn't have to write
my display routines using X primitives, and my print routines using
postscript.

So how will Microsoft react to the Rhapsody threat?  If Rhapsody proves
the savour for Apple that Apple sorely need, Microsoft may well have to
write a whole new operating system.  Hey, the might even buy Unix from
SCO and HP!  :-)
