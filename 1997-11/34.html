OK, this is getting boring people. Collectively you are acting like a
bunch of CS geeks who are defending something against nothing. Who gives a
crap if someone thinks Microsoft is good, and someone else thinks it is
bad, and someone else has a carrot up his/her arse. Who cares? My
suggestion is that we all get past puberty, and drop the whole emotional
Microsoft vs. Netscape/Linux/Mac etc style debates, because they are
simply counter productive. If you have something worthwhile to say about a
product or a company, that is based on some sort of objective reality,
then please, I'm sure we'll all be quite happy to receive it, and delete
it if it doesn't concern us. If you are intent on proving your manhood (or
womanhood, depending on who you are) by trashing other companies or
people, please, set up another mailing list...

PS this is not directed at anyone in particular, just those prone to the
	"Holy War" syndrome...
