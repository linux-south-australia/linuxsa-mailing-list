Sorry, I know this has nothing to do with IE or MS but I thought
I would post it anyway :-)

We are setting up a new server (at the psychology dept, Adel Uni)
I would like to try an alpha but being on a tight budget the only
affordable way to do it is at the board ie buy the processor (500MHz)
and motherboard (164LX) and the  glue it together with other standard
PC bits (this sounds simple?). This should cost a bit less than a dual
300MHz pentium. 

The trouble is the alpha is completely foreign territory.
Has anyone done this? Are there known pitfalls/problems. Particularly
firmware - booting, I am not yet sure what would come on the motherboard.
As for as I know the board has standard power connectors and takes
standard 168pin DIMMs ?

We are also looking for benchmarks and comparisons for alpha and intel
configurations. We have collected a heap of benchmarks off the web but 
they mainly relate to processor performance and I am more interested in 
IO (comparisons of linux on alpha and intel - disk/network performance,
I have found only one set of disk figures so far - RH Linux 4.1 on a
pentium).
I would particularly like to find out if the alpha m/b electronics
support the PCI bus any better than an Intel type board eg can support 
higher sustained transfer rates on the PCI bus ( I gather an Intel board
can only manage about a third of the potential PCI bandwidth).

Any pointers or suggestions appreciated,

Thanks

Mark.
