I think you might need to read the Dynamic-IP-Hacks mini-HOWTO. You see,
generally you can't figure out other peoples' IP addresses if they haven't
got a domain name, except if you know the subnet (then you can
ping'n'tell).

Some of the hacks in the howto show you how to 'publish' your IP address
on a webpage, or send it to somebody every time it changes. Perhaps this
is way too clumsy for you, and you just want to be able to ssh to a
domain.. Don't despair ;-

There is a service on the 'net called Monolith, and they offer a service
called dyndns.. It's a DNS service that changes when /you/ change your IP.
Whats' more, its' completely free for any sort of use, and they offer some
other great services as well (home pages, free normal DNS).. For more

 Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies
 the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry
 penguin charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more
 careful about what they say if they had.
