Hi Andrew and all,

&gt; PS Does anyone have *first hand* experince of any LINUX viruses?

In IMHO, talking about viruses on a multiuser, "system independent"
operating systems is silly.

It's a different ball game in the Unix world. Most programs are
distributed in the system independent form of source code-

- Cracks for various systems (like the Linux one that gets you root access
when you ran 'mount' or something like that) in immaterial, because source
code will be system independant. It's would be silly if it was system
dependant and had wades of machine code for a particular CPU.

- Most self appointed Crackers i've met are brainless (and i've met one or
two).

- Even if you downloaded a distribution with a small trojan piece of code
added, why would a maintainer bother going to all that trouble, when maybe
a few people will download the code, and compile it (that's if they could
compile it) then to discover it's a nasty piece of software. News travels
fast, and it isn't long before the distribution is removed off the site.

- And even then... most people compile and run distributions in a user-
Nuff-said. You are being silly if you download a new/unknown/untrusted  
distribution and run it as a root.


                              *   *   *   *

Basically, the effect is reduced. Anybody who is a programmer and is
capable of writing system programs will not bother with this, because it's
simply a waste of time.

Anybody here who operated BBS's or Messydos machines should be far less
worried when operating Linux. It's a silly worry. It's like being worried
about an evasion from mars, or worrying about your eyeballs dropping out
of your eye sockets.

see ya
