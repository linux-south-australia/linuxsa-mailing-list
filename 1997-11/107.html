Hi all,
Part of our loyalty and cautious interest that Internet is the source of

information for professional people and saving this source from any
threat should the job of every one of us but not you only.
Kindly note that if you receive an e-mail titled, “JOIN THE CREW”, DO
NOT open it! It will erase EVERYTHING on yow hard drive.
Send this letter out to as many people at yow can. This is a new virus
and not many people know about it as yet. This information was received
from IBM.
Please share it!
Also, If anyone receives mail entitled, “ PENPAL GREETINGS! ”, please
delete it WITHOUT reading it. This is a dangerous virus propagating
across the Internet through e-mail. It appears to be a friendly letter,
but by the time you read it, its too late. It uses the Trojan Horse
Virus and will have already infected the boot sector of your hard drive,
destroying all of the data present. It is a self-replicating virus, and
once the message is read it will AUTOMATICALLY forward itself to anyone
whose address is in your mailbox.
Hope this might prevent someone gets into major problems.

regards
selva
