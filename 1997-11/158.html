OK I believe it!  I see there are only three people using PPP on pasa now
so I guess the rest of you are using compressed slip.

I must admit I have always prefered CSLIP for dedicated connections but
PPP has many benifits and in aome cases there is no choice ;-)

&gt; &gt;I find this difficult to believe as both systems have been around for a
&gt; &gt;long time!  I know that APANA in South Australia are using FreeBSD as a
&gt; &gt;terminal server for several people using Linux as well as a lot of other
&gt; &gt;OS's.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, having had exactly the same problem myself (linux box into
&gt; pasa.apana.org.au), I find it quite easy to believe.  It might work
&gt; with some particular configurations or config file tweaking or
&gt; something, but I ended up solving the PPP problem by changing to
&gt; SLIP.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I think Matthew Brady is using Linux to connect to their hub site with
&gt; &gt;Linux PPP called skynet.apana.org.au to a FreeBSD box called
&gt; &gt;pasa.apana.org.au
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You can finger both of these systems.  pasa will tell you the systems
&gt; &gt;connected and the type of connection! 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Matthew is contactable via <A HREF="mailto:brady@skynet.apana.org.au">brady@skynet.apana.org.au</A>
&gt; 
&gt; You're quite right, of course.  It would be well worth getting in touch
&gt; with Matthew if you need to get this stuff working.  For me, though,
&gt; it was simpler just to go with SLIP, which worked "out of the box".
