&gt; At the last LinuxSA meeting I spoke to Geoffrey about a problem I am
&gt; having with ppp to my ISP. Everything looks fine until I actually try to
&gt; use the connection. My ISP uses FreeBSD and Geoffrey thought he had
&gt; heard of a problem between FreeBSD and Linux, but didn't have any other
&gt; info with him. If anybody has any info I would really appreciate it,
&gt; because I can find nothing in the READMEs, FAQs, HOWTOs, on the Web or
&gt; in Newsgroups.

Hi Peter,

Here is the information I was thinking of:

&gt;  &gt; Someone mentioned to me the other day that Linux (sometimes?) won't
&gt;  &gt; talk PPP to FreeBSD due to a buggy PPP implementation under Linux.
&gt;  &gt; Are you able to give me some details on this or a reference?
&gt; 
&gt; Not really, other than the fact that I'm not sure we can completely
&gt; blame Linux -- That much is not conclusive.
&gt; 
&gt; FreeBSD comes with two PPP implementations.  One of them is essentially
&gt; identical to the kernel PPP that comes with Linux, and uses the same
&gt; userland pppd program as a front-end.  I'm not aware of anyone actively
&gt; using that implementation due to the fact that the other implementation
&gt; that comes with BSD, "ijppp", is so much easier to use for dial-on-demand
&gt; applications.
&gt; 
&gt; ijppp is implemented entirely in userland.  It works by attaching itself
&gt; to an IP-tunnel network interface then encapsulating and de-encapsulating
&gt; packets between the interface and its controlling terminal.  That's the
&gt; version that I believe almost everyone is using using with FreeBSD.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, both versions support Predictor-1 compression.  When predictor-1
&gt; is enabled, however, Linux PPP and FreeBSD ijppp cannot talk to each 
&gt; other.
&gt; 
&gt; I was planning on performing some tests between the Cisco at work and
&gt; ijppp to determine if I can talk to a Cisco with pred1 enabled; That's
&gt; one of the items on the list of things I'll do if I ever manage to achieve
&gt; more than six consecutive days in Adelaide :-)  Depending on the outcome
&gt; of that test I'll be able to get a better idea of whether it's ijppp-pred1
&gt; or pppd-pred1 which is at fault.
&gt; 
&gt; My gut feeling is that it's actually ijppp that's the problem here, because
&gt; pppd is so well-tests on essentially every other UNIX platform capable
&gt; of running PPP.  It's also worth pointing out that ijppp's config file
&gt; can be hacked to make it work with Linux PPP by inserting the following
&gt; lines in the section describing a link to a Linux machine:
&gt; 
&gt;    disable pred1
&gt;    deny pred1
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
