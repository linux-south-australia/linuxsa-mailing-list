&gt; Ladies and Gentlemen,
&gt; I have a problem with a small Linux box that I'd appreciate some help with.
&gt; I am wishing to run this machine as a gateway only.  No  keyboard and no
&gt; monitor; just a box with a network cable running out of it.
&gt; The problem I'm having is that if I turn off (disable) the keyboard and/or
&gt; video in the BIOS, LILO refuses to load properly.
&gt; All I end up getting is "LI-" and lots of noise from the speaker. How do I
&gt; tell LILO to ignore the keyboard and video hardware settings??
&gt; I really don't wish to have to have a keyboard and monitor on this beast.  
&gt; The video setting won't matter I'm fairly sure, but the keyboard being
&gt; switched off at the BIOS is important for me to be able to boot without a
&gt; keyboard attached!

Hi Don,

There might not be a solution.  It seems that "it just works" for some
computers and "it just doesn't work" for others.  I had a server that
I _had_ to have a keyboard attached to (regardless of the BIOS
setting), otherwise Linux wouldn't load.  The replacement server
didn't need a keyboard.

Have you tried booting with the keyboard unplugged, both with and
without the BIOS keyboard setting enabled?

The "LI-" is unusual though.  The "LILO start message" section in the
LILO documentation mentions "L", "LI", "LIL?", and "LIL-" but not
"LI-".

Regards,
