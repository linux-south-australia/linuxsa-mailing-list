&gt; I am not saying that they will convert directly, but the format will be 
&gt; consistent, and so with varying payloads the the program could be made 
&gt; portable.  When it attacks it checks what platform it is on, and then it
&gt; applies that attack.  The Internet worm (Guess what report I am reading)
&gt; had attack code for VAX and Sun's.  It's payload (itself) was a c program
&gt; that it compiled to continue the next attack.

Well, i be damned, although, this program would still have to combat the
huge differences in the Un*x's. Every flavour of Unix has a slightly
different system function set. Structures are named differently, and
things are in different places. All this will had bulk to the code, make
it for complex, and prone to fail.
 
&gt; Also with a complex system sometimes backdoors are put in for debugging 
&gt; and are forgotten to be taken out before delivery.  They are not intentional
&gt; but are still bad.

Yes, i wrote a backdoor into a program i did a few years ago.

I guess viruses can be more than just executable images that attach
themselves onto other executable images and delete harddisks etc. 

I guess the world isn't so safe after all.

&gt; This has been a fun rant :).

I'll second that.
