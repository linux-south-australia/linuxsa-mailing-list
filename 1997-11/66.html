Hi all,
-- original snipped --
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There might not be a solution.  It seems that "it just works" for some
&gt; &gt; computers and "it just doesn't work" for others.  I had a server that
&gt; &gt; I _had_ to have a keyboard attached to (regardless of the BIOS
&gt; &gt; setting), otherwise Linux wouldn't load.  The replacement server
&gt; &gt; didn't need a keyboard.
&gt; 
&gt; There are some BIOS's out there that will not boot without
&gt; a keyboard attached. Find another motherboard if you have this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The "LI-" is unusual though.  The "LILO start message" section in the
&gt; &gt; LILO documentation mentions "L", "LI", "LIL?", and "LIL-" but not
&gt; &gt; "LI-".
&gt; 
&gt; Does this problem occur when you disable the keyboard, but leave
&gt; all video enabled?
Yes.

&gt; Again this might be a find another motherboard
nah...it's only a 486 anyway.  It'll do till I can afford another Pentium+
board and CPU.

&gt; problem. I suggest not disabling the video, even if you don't
&gt; have a monitor attached, because it's always useful if the machine
&gt; goes down. I have a machine which never has a monitor on it, but I
&gt; leave an old VLB card in it, enabled. This machine also has a
&gt; (very) cheap keyboard connected to it so I can cleanly shut it down
&gt; when I need to (occasionally) move it.
That's what I'll be doing.  I have a spare keyboard that I'll leave plugged
in for the heck of it.
I only have 3 monitors for 4 systems, and the machine in question is my
secondary Linux machine that I am currently using for ISP dial up and IP
Masquerading only.
Anyone got the url for diald????

For those who remember my difficulties getting IP Masq. to work; the
problem was an invalid gateway setting that was added as part of the
install process.
