&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Part of our loyalty and cautious interest that Internet is the source of
&gt; 
&gt; information for professional people and saving this source from any
&gt; threat should the job of every one of us but not you only.
&gt; Kindly note that if you receive an e-mail titled, ?JOIN THE CREW?, DO
&gt; NOT open it! It will erase EVERYTHING on yow hard drive.
&gt; Send this letter out to as many people at yow can. This is a new virus
&gt; and not many people know about it as yet. This information was received
&gt; from IBM.
&gt; Please share it!
&gt; Also, If anyone receives mail entitled, ? PENPAL GREETINGS! ?, please
&gt; delete it WITHOUT reading it. This is a dangerous virus propagating
&gt; across the Internet through e-mail. It appears to be a friendly letter,
&gt; but by the time you read it, its too late. It uses the Trojan Horse
&gt; Virus and will have already infected the boot sector of your hard drive,
&gt; destroying all of the data present. It is a self-replicating virus, and
&gt; once the message is read it will AUTOMATICALLY forward itself to anyone
&gt; whose address is in your mailbox.
&gt; Hope this might prevent someone gets into major problems.
&gt; 
&gt; regards
&gt; selva

I recommend all people on the list read the following page

	<A HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html">http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html</A>

Both of these "email virii" have historically been hoaxes.  

Before forwarding any messages about virii or the like please
check with a reputible site to check its authenticity.  Although
based on fear of virii, these type of messages are wasteful of 
peoples time and resources.

Matt
