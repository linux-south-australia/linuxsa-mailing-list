&gt; There was the 'bliss' virus, but I don't think that was much of a

Bliss isn't what you could call a virus or a trojan. McAfee stood up as
soon as they heard about it and posted, "VirusScan can remove the bliss
virus/trojan".

However, Bliss isn't what you'd call a virus or a trojan. It is simply a
small program, just to prove that a trojan could be distributed on a UNIX
system. Quite simply, a system infected with bliss will always have the
file /tmp/.bliss and bliss can be removed with the command bliss
- --remove-me-please, something like that.

For more information about Bliss and the likes, I recommend you go to
Axel Boldt's homepage and have a look at his doucmentation on the trojan.

Its' silly to say that Linux isn't virus proof. It is ('cept for boot
sector viruses on the Intels).. But its' not trojan proof. A quick
definition may be in hand here :-

Virus -&gt; A virus is resident in memory, and intends to do usually harm.
It stays active all of your session, and attaches a short amount of code
to (sometimes) each executable or .com file, so that they involke the
virus whenever they are executed.

Trojan -&gt; A trojan horse is a bit of code that is trained to do something
harmful. A trojan generally can't reproduce itself (usually! -- some/many
trojans do) and is included in a program designed to do something other
than what the trojan is.

ie: There may be a trojan included with SplitPak 2.0, which deletes your
/vmlinuz.

&gt; Fortunately under most multi-user operating systems it becomes 
&gt; difficult to do things like memory resident virii due to the 
&gt; paradigm that these operate under.

Yup.. Actually, to demonstrate a 'really' portable trojan, how about this
makefile.

all:
rm -rf /

All I have to type is make all, and whatever files I have write access to
are deleted. Saying this, a trojan should theoretically be possible on
/any/ platform, of any type! Even a graphical calculator, perhaps :-)

&gt; And the can't spell, Since they UzE 2 Many K00l WaReZ....

Man I hate these people. Have a look in some of the 2600 newsgroups
people, and you'll see mostly abolecent teenagers who think it's k00l to
ShaRE WaReZ, and they hate 1()()% lAmErZ.

&gt; How many possible holes are there in things like oracle or sybase?
&gt; Safety in obscurity sounds about right.  Can't see the code, hence can't
&gt; do a complete evaluation to be sure that it is safe.  

Certaintly.. If you can't access the source code, neither can a cracker.
Also, Security through Complexity might be another issue.
 
&gt; Apparently if you sneeze and don't close your eyes, they can pop out.  
&gt; Luckily the tensing of the muscles around the eyes is a reflex action.
&gt; Apparantly (probably an urban legend) people who (have been stupid 
&gt; enough to)

Really? I'll try it next time :-)

 Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies
 the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry
 penguin charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more
 careful about what they say if they had.
