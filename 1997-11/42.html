<PRE>
I am posting this message expecting to be informed that it is 'off
topic'.
However why I think it is relevant for this list:
a) It gives you, the linux users an intimate look at other OS'es
b) Its relevant in the view of the recent thread of "Microsoft Sucks"
    and some anonymous users (MR NEWALL!!!) stating:
    "Ah yes Hitler is bad but at least the trains run on time!"
c) It gives you ammo for convincing others why Linux is superior :-)
d) It makes a damn good read.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;However, I work with Joe Vasquez and Shawn Rappaport. I read your
&gt;&gt;articles on the Netware 4 list. I am in a unique situation with Shawn
&gt;&gt;and Joe here. I am one step from becoming an MCSE but have about 2 years
&gt;&gt;experience with Netware (3.11 and 4.1). I fully realize the superiority
&gt;&gt;of NDS over anything NT has or will have in version 5.0 with ADS. Shawn
&gt;&gt;and I are trying to integrate more Intranetware servers on our LAN and
&gt;&gt;WAN but I am having to justify this immensely. Can you recommend some
&gt;&gt;hard facts or documentation to back me up. I know you write for Network
&gt;&gt;VAR magazine and I need some factual unbiased documentation to back me
&gt;&gt;up. Your articles or any others would help. If you are too busy just say
&gt;&gt;so in an E-mail. 
&gt;
&gt;Joe,
&gt;
&gt;I'd be happy to help, at least where I can. Because this is such a
&gt;common question I'm taking the liberty to post it in a couple of other
&gt;places; the Netware 4 list being one of them IN fact, I may turn it
&gt;into an article sometime!
&gt;
&gt;The problem is where to start? There's been a couple of good
&gt;suggestions on the list, so check them out. I've enclosed an article
&gt;that's on cnpnet by Wayne Rash as well. Remembering that the devil is
&gt;in the details, let's start by looking at the myths:
&gt;
&gt;Novell's lack of protected mode operation makes it unreliable, whereas
&gt;NT is a stable, crashproof system. This claim comes from MIS geeks
&gt;that took a degree in computer science without understanding much of
&gt;what they're talking about. The realities are that properly written
&gt;code will not crash a netware server - many of us have seen netware
&gt;servers that run for years, continuously; it's seldom I see a crashing
&gt;netware server anymore. While netware 3 has some reliablity problems
&gt;due to memory management, the memory manager was rewritten completely
&gt;in netware 4 to virtually eliminate memory fragmentation, a leading
&gt;cause of process shutdowns and server crashes in NT. While I do see NT
&gt;servers that run for months, I've yet to see one run continuously for
&gt;years, and the norm is a restart weekly to clean up memory.
&gt;
&gt;NT does have protected memory, but it's limited. To gain performance,
&gt;version 3.5 placed the disk drivers in ring 0, then with version 4 the
&gt;lan and video drivers went there as well. That's a significant portion
&gt;of the peripherals running in vulnerable ring 0, and improperly
&gt;written drivers are another major cause of NT server crashes. As for
&gt;memory protection for applications just try running Visio 3.1 on NT
&gt;3.5 or above. Instant crash, I believe caused by improper disk access.
&gt;
&gt;Scalability:
&gt;This one is pretty funny, it's been blathered about for so long. The
&gt;sad fact is that NT needs enourmous amounts of RAM and CPU. Our
&gt;minimum recommended server is a P200 with 128 megs of ram; netware is
&gt;far, far more efficient. Now NT does scale from there - for any given
&gt;amount of RAM and disk channel a CPU bound process will experience a
&gt;50% improvement in performance with a second processor, a third will
&gt;add another 25%, a fourth another 10%. Tests by Intel and Compaq as
&gt;mentioned in PC week claim another 20% performance enhancement with
&gt;another FOUR CPUs. This was tested with 4 gigabytes of RAM, the next
&gt;version SQL server and an OS patch that allows for three gigabytes of
&gt;RAM to be dedicated to an application, up from the current 2 gigs of
&gt;application space.
&gt;
&gt;If you look carefully you'll find that the recommended method of
&gt;performance enhancement is faster processors, more processors, more
&gt;RAM, faster disk channels, faster NICs, moving processes off
&gt;overloaded machines, and DEC Alpha. There IS no server tuning as we
&gt;know it. I've explained how scalable NT is with more processors, and
&gt;as the minimum recommended processor is nearly the fastest available
&gt;(the Pentium II's, have faster clock speeds but show almost no
&gt;performance enhancement; between 6-10% above a PPro200) there isn't
&gt;much help there. Once the disk channel is adequate and the server is
&gt;running fast ethernet there's little to do except add more servers or
&gt;move to an Alpha. Additional servers seem to be the best option, and
&gt;in fact many enterprise environments are mandating no more than 25
&gt;users per NT server - you can find that claim in PC week, the Gartner
&gt;Group, and other magazines. Contrast that with the MANY Netware
&gt;installations running hundreds of users on a single 486-66 server.
&gt;Check out Novell's Appnotes, March 1996 - there's an article by Compaq
&gt;on scalability. They tested 498 workstations running Netbench 3 for an
&gt;emulated 2500-5000 users, all on a single Proliant 4500-133, single
&gt;processor. The server's processor had peaked at 100% utilization much
&gt;earlier, but they saw a continued improvement in performance as
&gt;workstations were added - the EISA bus was not saturated, and
&gt;apparently neither were the bus mastering NICS and SCSI cards.
&gt;
&gt;That brings up another point Novell not being Symmetrical multi 
&gt;processing. While Netware is, in truth not completely SMP compliant
&gt;this is HARDLY a serious shortcoming. Netware is multi processor
&gt;capable first by taking good advantage of bus mastering adapters,
&gt;allowing the onboard application specific processor to handle much of
&gt;the load. This frees up the CPU for other tasks. This is one reason
&gt;why Novell happily admits that there is little improvement (about 10%)
&gt;in file and print performance when adding multiple CPUs. However,
&gt;Oracle claims great scalability for CPU intensive operations under
&gt;Netware - When they first announced SMP compliant Oracle for Netware
&gt;they claimed scalability of 100% for the second processor, 100% for
&gt;the third and 90% for the fourth - and while they didn't state exact
&gt;figures they did indicate that their testing showed good scalability
&gt;for higher processor counts. I've also talked to Oracle, Gupta and
&gt;Novell (Groupwise) engineers who ALL agree that their respective
&gt;appications run faster on Netware, processor for processor than
&gt;anything else.
&gt;
&gt;Much is made over NT's preemptive multi tasking, yet we've all seen
&gt;cases where an application or process goes off to lala land, taking a
&gt;good portion of the system with it. The best example is the current
&gt;troubles Microsoft is having with their exchange mail system. At
&gt;13,000 users they've got the biggest exchange system in the world, yet
&gt;it does hiccup frequently. Much of the problems can be attributed to
&gt;mail storms; in the words of a Microsoft engineer I met last week:
&gt;"Exchange does do very well, until it's heavily loaded. Then it falls
&gt;to it's knees." Dispite claims of multi threading it appears to be
&gt;severely restricted to a single process; we've seen it refuse to
&gt;handle client connections while trying to contact a configured
&gt;Exchange server that was temporarily unavailable. I'd speculate that
&gt;this may be due to the transaction tracking done by exchange, but it's
&gt;a pretty poor design if processes can easily block each other.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and a final performance point - that enclosed html document states
&gt;emphatically that gigabit ethernet is wasted on NT - it topped out at
&gt;150 megabits/s, while Solaris and Netware were around 680 megabits/s.
&gt;
&gt;Now let's look at troubleshooting and disaster recovery. NT, like all
&gt;windows products has a patchquilt design, where configuration
&gt;information may be found in the registry, win.ini, system.ini or an
&gt;application specific ini file. In addition a standard was never
&gt;developed regarding WHERE auxilary files were to be located. DLLs can
&gt;be scattered hither and yon, making manual system correction
&gt;absolutely impossible. This has led to the rise of 'smart' application
&gt;uninstallers and the promise of smart applications in some future
&gt;release. However, the standard solution to any difficult problem with
&gt;system configurations is a fresh installation. Several customers have
&gt;complained that they are now wizards at installing NT, because they
&gt;have so much practice. 
&gt;
&gt;Netware installation is sometimes viewed as a mystery largely because
&gt;it only needs to be done once. Netware problems can ALWAYS be sorted
&gt;out by unloading nlms or preventing them from being loaded in the
&gt;first place to do diagnostics, and outdated modules can be easily
&gt;found - they're in the system directory unless application specific,
&gt;then they may be in the application directory. The configuration is
&gt;analogous to the Macintosh, which has a simple, elegant configuration
&gt;methodology. I've been able to move applications from one Mac on a
&gt;network to another because of this - it's quite simple to find the
&gt;additional system extensions required to make things run, even mac
&gt;microsoft products. Just TRY this with Office 95!
&gt;
&gt;Networking
&gt;"IPX stinks, it's too chatty, and Novell doesn't have a real IP 
&gt;solution." The modern implementation of IPX, utilizing burst mode,
&gt;NLSP and sap/rip filtering is really no chattier than IP, and just as
&gt;efficient with WAN traffic. Of course there's Netware/IP, which still
&gt;includes an IPX stub. Saying this isn't real IP is EXACTLY the same as
&gt;saying Microsoft's TCP/IP solution isn't real IP - to be exact, it's
&gt;NetBios encapsulated in an IP packet. As such it has all the
&gt;shortcomings of traditional netbios - it can be very chatty, tends to
&gt;use broadcast traffic rather than directed packets, has naming
&gt;problems, and doesn't play very well with WAN links. I've done NT on
&gt;Wans, and I'm here to tell you it stinks. Many of the problems are
&gt;solved ONLY by very fat pipes - a 56K connection is the minimum, and
&gt;even at that there are problems with timeouts if the WAN gets even
&gt;moderately busy.
&gt;
&gt;Name resolution is a major issue with NT - A browse master is required
&gt;at each location, and dispite the fact that the Domain controller is
&gt;supposed to be the browse master BY DEFAULT, it's very easy to start a
&gt;'browse war', were another NT machine, or worse, a 95 workstation
&gt;insists on trying to be the browse master, and as it's not configured
&gt;to recognize the rest of the network it becomes very easy to lose
&gt;sight of anything across the WAN. It's possible to set up NT to handle
&gt;WAN links gracefully, but it's not easy - nor is it typically done. I
&gt;could discuss this at GREAT length, but I think we'll save the rest of
&gt;the network issues for another time.
&gt;
&gt;Of course we're all aware of the domain issues. Reliability requires a
&gt;backup domain controllers for each domain, whereas NDS partitions
&gt;should be replicated - but a dedicated machine isn't necessary. The
&gt;OFFICIAL recommendation by microsoft is three machines minimum per
&gt;domain - a Primary Domain Controller, a Backup Domain Controller, and
&gt;a server. But then hardware is cheap, right? Any structure in your
&gt;'directory' requires a unique domain for each group - and the minimum
&gt;three machines. With NDS, NO additional machines are needed to create
&gt;an organizational unit.
&gt;
&gt;Domain trusts are rather fragile. The domains periodically
&gt;authenticate to each other, then change the agreed password. If they
&gt;can't communicate for an extended period the trust is broken,
&gt;requiring an on site administrator to recreate the trust manually.
&gt;This wouldn't be so bad except that this can really only be done from
&gt;the domain controller. I've had a LOT of experience managing a 11 site
&gt;WAN here in the Seattle area for the state employement security
&gt;department. All are connected in a hub arrangement to the central site
&gt;through 56k frame relay, 7 sites are NT. Before I moved the central
&gt;site to NT we had a complete trust model - one server per site, each
&gt;site was independent so we couldn't use a single domain, even if there
&gt;was enough bandwidth for it. Over a year's time each server would
&gt;routinely fail to authenticate to at least one other site, sometimes
&gt;for as much as 8 hours. This indicates that we were close to failure
&gt;on the trusts, although they never actually failed while the WAN was
&gt;up. Adding the 7th site prompted me to move to a modified master
&gt;domain model. All the users are still on their site domain but the
&gt;trusts have been reduced - each site only trusts the central domain.
&gt;We've seen the elimination of the authentication failures, but it
&gt;pointed out something that I'd noticed a long time ago - remote admin
&gt;of a NT server is difficult; only the addition of PC Anywhere really
&gt;solved it. SMS would also, but it really is only good for managing the
&gt;NT environment and doesn't do much for the rest.
&gt;
&gt;Security
&gt;"NT is C2 certified!" Big, big BS. NT 3.51 server is certified without
&gt;a NIC; the addition of networking (including a modem) removes the
&gt;certified status. Netware has finally completed the certification
&gt;process, and has provided a methodology for third party vendors to
&gt;certify their products at the C2 level, creating for the first time
&gt;anywhere a mix and match capability for a C2 certifiable network.This
&gt;is unique; all other certified products must be tested in the EXACT
&gt;configuration specified, alterations remove the certification. In
&gt;response Microsoft's new position is that they are re-examining the
&gt;value of a C2 class certification to themselves and their customers.
&gt;
&gt;Of course the certification is only part of the security issue. What
&gt;really counts is how easy it is to break in or otherwise trash the
&gt;system. About 6 new exploits were found for NT in the last year; while
&gt;most were patched this does not speak well for the future as most were
&gt;REMOTE exploits. While it's possible to break into a Netware system
&gt;(even 4.x, and without server access) there are few real, tested ways.
&gt;There's an excellent FAQ on the subject; look up Simple Nomad in any
&gt;of the search engines. He maintains FAQs on both Netware and NT
&gt;security, as well as unix systems.
&gt;
&gt;This should get you started. Bear in mind I didn't say not to use NT,
&gt;or that it sucks. Like any other system keep it's limitations in mind
&gt;when doing system design and never, ever believe the marketing claims.
&gt;Tell Joe I said hi, and that I finally finished my MCSE.
