&gt; So there are products that will convert say Alpha instruction ELF's to x86

I am not saying that they will convert directly, but the format will be 
consistent, and so with varying payloads the the program could be made 
portable.  When it attacks it checks what platform it is on, and then it
applies that attack.  The Internet worm (Guess what report I am reading)
had attack code for VAX and Sun's.  It's payload (itself) was a c program
that it compiled to continue the next attack.

&gt; Also, i was reading an article in the Dr Dobbs journal at the start of the
&gt; year that talked about "Remote Agent's". These are programs that simply
&gt; "float" around the internet in an interpreter style environment and do
&gt; things like network maintenance etc.
&gt; 
&gt; A bit dangerous, but highly interesting ;). One of the agents they talked
&gt; about was a program that gathered finger information on a group of hosts.
&gt; Very clever indeed. It would be a whole new avenue to explore.
&gt; 

I agree on this.  In intrusion detection research there are people looking at
autonomous agents.  Individual programs that exist in a distributed fashion
to give robustness to the system.  Each program exists independently to the
others and will be able to work seperately.

In one report on the internet worm it talks about the true 'network worms'
that would move around a network, using known exploits and then covering it's
trail.  It would only exist on one machine at a time, branching from machine
to machine on the network.

These autonomous agents could make virii very mean indeed. 

I was reading in a NT report that there are two threads running under NT that
stop you changing it from a workstation to a server. (It is a registry entry
modification).  This is the same idea, but running on the server. 

&gt; 
&gt; When you purchase this commercial unix software, do you buy it off the
&gt; shelf?, or do you download it from public FTP site, or off the vendors ftp
&gt; site?.  How is most commercial Un*x software acquired (from your
&gt; experiences)?.
&gt; 

A number of ways, via a CD, via the net, via a public net site.  I can 
give examples of each of these if needed.  

The issue is that you can't be sure that the software is good or not.

How many cover CDs have had virii on them.   Quite a few.

Again it falls down to security and procedure.  

&gt; 
&gt; Yes i agree here... but pretty rare to say the least. I think this is the
&gt; exception.
&gt; 
&gt; But you have to agree with me that the small machine dependant style
&gt; viruses that you used to get on single user systems like Mac, and MSDOS
&gt; couldn't practically exist on Linux?. They were heaverly system dependent
&gt; because they were msdos x86 executables that were composed of x86
&gt; instructions, used the pc bios, and did things to the hardware that it
&gt; could only do on pc's (you talk to pc hardware via port registers, other
&gt; more advanced CPU's have mapped IO memory, different instructions,
&gt; different byte sex, different word precision). The diversity of hardware,
&gt; and un*x, is so great.. I just couldn't think how i could write a virus.

I would say that most of those virii relied on full access to the system. 
Under Unix (and NT for the most part) it is a different matter.  You
are abstracted from the hardware, this makes life tougher, but not
altogether impossible.

I agree it it would be a shift in the virus paradigm.  There are virii that
target the Win95 platform (given I haven't read much on it), that use the
win32 interface.  This should be able be extend to the Linux kernel API.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But commercial applications may not have source, and you may have no other
&gt; &gt; option to trust it.  Some applications even require setuid root to work
&gt; &gt; properly.  You can't look at the code, you *HAVE* to trust it.
&gt; 
&gt; These are pretty big reputable companies, releasing packeted software.
&gt; I just find it unbelievable for this to happen. I couldn't see how a
&gt; backyard operator would globally release a Linux/Unix related destructive
&gt; product and bring down half the worlds machines, or even a fraction of the
&gt; worlds machines without being noticed, reported, and ellimated before it
&gt; effected everybody.

Two issues here, scope and intent.

Scope
=====

Firstly I am not saying that there are people who try to affect large 
numbers of machines.  If it affects a small number of machines, it still will
affect them.  Most security exploits only directly affect a small number of 
people.  

These exploits are still possible on people who aren't directly affected. 

Intent
======

The intent of code is usually good.  Most companies will be trying to sell 
products.  If the product is small then they can be try to be sure the 
security aspects of their code are good.

If, however the product is large, then it will become difficult to make 
sure that all aspects are secure.  It takes just one buffer overflow to make
a app insecure.   

To exemplify this look at NT.  It is a fairly well designed product.  But 
because of the complexity of the system it is difficult to ensure that it
is secure.  There are lots of holes all over the place.  Subscribe to 
NTBUGTRAQ to find out how many. 

Some of the more influential people in security have said that NT is most 
secure when it is off (that can be said of all operating systems OTOH).

Also with a complex system sometimes backdoors are put in for debugging 
and are forgotten to be taken out before delivery.  They are not intentional
but are still bad.


This has been a fun rant :).
