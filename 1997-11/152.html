&gt; At the last LinuxSA meeting I spoke to Geoffrey about a problem I am
&gt; having with ppp to my ISP. Everything looks fine until I actually try to
&gt; use the connection. My ISP uses FreeBSD and Geoffrey thought he had
&gt; heard of a problem between FreeBSD and Linux, but didn't have any other
&gt; info with him. If anybody has any info I would really appreciate it,
&gt; because I can find nothing in the READMEs, FAQs, HOWTOs, on the Web or
&gt; in Newsgroups.

Generally, I don't think that there are many problems connecting F/BSD to
Linux. I've used an older ISP that runs FreeBSD and it worked perfectly on
my Linux box.

What I suggest you do is you turn on verbose logging, and perhaps open up
a session in minicom and login yourself, and then exit out without hanging
up and running pppd manually.

Also, you might like to try the "router type" pap-secrets configuration :-

username
password

What type of authentication are you using Client-Server? Is it just
password or is it chap/pap?
 
&gt; If you think that looking at my setup and logs might help, you can read
&gt; them on the web at <A HREF="http://www.hal9000.net.au/~pjeffrey/ppp">http://www.hal9000.net.au/~pjeffrey/ppp</A> or I will
&gt; email them to you.

Don't have web access ATM -- I'm offline. Can you please send me your
logs?
