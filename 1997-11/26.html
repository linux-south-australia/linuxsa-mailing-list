&gt;&gt; What I want to know why would you want to cripple a perfectly good
&gt;&gt; operating system with Micor$oft crap.
&gt;
&gt;This is a completely unfair comment because a lot of Microsoft's stuff
&gt;is very good or better.  Word, Excel and Visual C++ are three products
OOohhh... Boy! You really asking for it :-)
Ok, Lets start:
Word: Overfeatured behamoth, far too complex for many people who are
forced to use it.
Excel: That one is actually ok :-)
Visual C++: Slower than Delphi, Slower than C++ Builder from Borland.

&gt;that spring immediately to my mind as examples of superb software, which
&gt;is not to say that they are perfect--no software is--but I think any
&gt;sensible analysis would have to agree that they are closer to perfect
&gt;than to crap.  
I beg to differ. I have to work with Micro$oft shit every day and I
consistantly find
it overfeatured, badly written, buggy, expensive and minimaly supported.
Oh yes you can buy support from MS.

&gt;At least one of these products is the market leader, and
&gt;this speaks volumes to it's 'crapness' (or otherwise.)
It is market leader because of its bundling and overbearing tactics.
Witness the recent Judgeent by Department of Justice.
Case in point, the SA Government is *NOT ALLOWED* to use
any software that is not Microsoft. I recently had a highly placed user
ask to use lotus notes. Application was refused because it was not
microsoft.
&gt;
&gt;The emotive charge, "Micor$oft crap" (SIC), is doubly damaging because
&gt;it is so clearly delusional.  
This is where I stopped reading the rest of your message.
"CLEARLY DELUSIONAL"
&lt;Rant mode on&gt;
Hahahahahaha... My dear MATE!
I will give you a fuc*ing specific example how fuc*ing *DELUSIONAL* I
am.

It took me 2 days to from download to setup a fully functional WWW
server
(with cgi). Now I have never done this before in my life. It took me 2
days
(ok I am a slow learner). The server happened to be Apache (1.2.x).
That server is still running almost a year later. It was free.

It took me 3 weeks to try to set up the MICROSOFT CRAP (and I use the
word advisedly) IIS3 with frigging Developer suite. In the end we canned
the
project. This was at the time when Micorcrap's own WWW server was
crashing.
We spend something like $2000+ on the setup.

Microsoft: "Install our Internet technology, its far superior to the
rest."
Customer: "But your own WWW server crashes, you tell us it superior
where
	your example site is off the air?"
Microsoft: "We dominate the market! Therefore our software must be
superior."
Customer: "I can get a better product for free!"
Microsoft: "You just wait till Chairman Gates becomes God Emperor of
Universe!"

Dont talk to me about MICRO-FRIGGING-SOFT superiority, the only reson it
is where is today is because amateurs like you keep grunting in ectasy
at its
graphical interfaces.
&lt;Rant mode off&gt;

Ok to be reasonable.
I have used, installed and administered Microsoft and non-microsoft
products.
Sadly, given a choice (which I dont have anymore) I would chose
non-microsoft 
products any day. I base this purely on my extensive experience of over
10 years
in the professions of Systems Development and Systems Administration.
