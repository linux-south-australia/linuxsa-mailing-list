&gt; Hi Andrew and all,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; PS Does anyone have *first hand* experince of any LINUX viruses?
&gt; 
There was the 'bliss' virus, but I don't think that was much of a 
true virus, more of a replicating trojan.  I think we are getting
into *word definition* territory here, so 'nuff said.

&gt; In IMHO, talking about viruses on a multiuser, "system independent"
&gt; operating systems is silly.

I disagree, it should be theoretically possible to have virii on 
any platform.  Multi-user or not.

Fortunately under most multi-user operating systems it becomes 
difficult to do things like memory resident virii due to the 
paradigm that these operate under.

When you say system independent, I assume you mean one that is not
tied to any particular binary/cpu format.  It is trivial to get
an application to compile a piece of code.  With consistent formats
such as 86open and ELF, it should be possible to make a binary
that could be portable across many platforms.

&gt; 
&gt; It's a different ball game in the Unix world. Most programs are
&gt; distributed in the system independent form of source code-

Not true.  Most free software yes, most commercial software no.

&gt; - Cracks for various systems (like the Linux one that gets you root access
&gt; when you ran 'mount' or something like that) in immaterial, because source
&gt; code will be system independant. It's would be silly if it was system
&gt; dependant and had wades of machine code for a particular CPU.

True, buffer overflows are tied to a platform/CPU, but things like the 
sendmail debug exploit of old are *totally* system independent.  There are
very few of these around but they still do exist, and it is trivial for
a developer to forget about good procedure and put a back door in.

&gt; - Most self appointed Crackers i've met are brainless (and i've met one or
&gt; two).

And the can't spell, Since they UzE 2 Many K00l WaReZ....

&gt; - Even if you downloaded a distribution with a small trojan piece of code
&gt; added, why would a maintainer bother going to all that trouble, when maybe
&gt; a few people will download the code, and compile it (that's if they could
&gt; compile it) then to discover it's a nasty piece of software. News travels
&gt; fast, and it isn't long before the distribution is removed off the site.

Again you are only looking at the free software world.  You may need a 
piece of software that has a nasty, but you need that piece of software and
the vendor may be slow in sending out patches/updates.

&gt; - And even then... most people compile and run distributions in a user-
&gt; Nuff-said. You are being silly if you download a new/unknown/untrusted
&gt; distribution and run it as a root.

But commercial applications may not have source, and you may have no other
option to trust it.  Some applications even require setuid root to work
properly.  You can't look at the code, you *HAVE* to trust it. 

How many possible holes are there in things like oracle or sybase?
Safety in obscurity sounds about right.  Can't see the code, hence can't
do a complete evaluation to be sure that it is safe.  

&gt; Basically, the effect is reduced. Anybody who is a programmer and is
&gt; capable of writing system programs will not bother with this, because it's
&gt; simply a waste of time.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody here who operated BBS's or Messydos machines should be far less
&gt; worried when operating Linux. It's a silly worry. It's like being worried
&gt; about an evasion from mars, or worrying about your eyeballs dropping out
&gt; of your eye sockets.

Apparently if you sneeze and don't close your eyes, they can pop out.  
Luckily the tensing of the muscles around the eyes is a reflex action.
Apparantly (probably an urban legend) people who (have been stupid 
enough to)

OTOH invasions from Mars......

&gt; 
&gt; see ya

My rant is over :)

ciao

Matt
