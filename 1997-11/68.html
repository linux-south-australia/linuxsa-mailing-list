Hiyas...I know this isn't technically about Linux itself, but since this
problem is stopping me from using Linux,and I am desperate for a fix, I
thought I'd ask some of the gurus on here anyway....

My problem is thus:
I had a p133 with a Soyo 430FX motherboard, running several harddrives, in
order:
primary controller, master, mode 3 730Mb IBM IDE drive
primary controller, slave, mode 4 1.6Gb Seagate IDE drive. ST31720A I
think.
secondary controller, master, mode 4 Quantum fireball 3.8Gb IDE drive
secondary controller, slave, IDE/ATAPI CDROM drive.
(there is more in system - ie. scsi cards and associated drive and cdrom,
and et6000 video card, 3dfx card, and awe32, but AFAIK they are irrelevant
to this problem..)

I upgraded the motherboard up to a Tyan S1571 Titan Turbo AT-2 motherboard,
as the first step of a larger upgrade. In doing so, win95 fell over and
died, but I was expecting that. What I wasn't expecting was that the new
motherboard completely refuses to acknowledge the existence of the Seagate
harddrive.
(Said drive having  ~1Gb of linux partitions and a ~600Mb DOS parttion)

I upgrade the BIOS on the motherboard, but this did not make a difference.
I have played extensively with BIOS options, but nothing will make it see
the drive.

The Seagate drive will not be recognized, no matter what I do - I have
tried it in these configurations:
Single master, no otehr drives.
Slave, with (and without)  a master.
Master with a slave.
Interesting enough, when the seagate is a master and has a slave, the Slave
is still found, even thou the master is not!

If I take the drive, cables, etc. into another system, it works fine. The
cabling is not at fault.

This motherboard will read all other drives without a problem, which would
seem to say that it is not at fault.
The harddrive will work in all other systems, (although I have yet to try
it on an exact same motherboard as mine), which appears to say it is not at
fault either!

BTW, When I say 'does not work' 'does not detect' etc, I mean that the
system will
a) Not auto-detect the harddrive - ie. comes up as None.
b) Will produce an error if the specs are manually entered. 'Drive not
found.'

I have spent several sleepless nights trying everything I can think of, but
needless to say, I haven't succeeded.
If anyone has any ideas or suggestions or magic wands to wave, please let
me know, as at the moment I have had to resort to using an O/S which took
half a dozen complete wipe-reinstalls and a million reboots before it would
work properly. (Working properly defined as all devices installed and
working, and able to run more than 2 applications without crashing...And I
know it'll only last like this for about a week anyway ;( )

If all else fails, does anyone want to buy a 1.67Gb drive, good condition,
etc. from me? Only condition is I get to copy everything off it first ;)

Also, if anyone is running older systems, I'm looking to sell my 8Mb 72pin
EDO SIMMs (have 4), and also a single 8 or 16Mb 72pin FP SIMM.

Thanks in advance, and cu() ppl!
Toby
