&gt; When you say system independent, I assume you mean one that is not

&gt; an application to compile a piece of code.  With consistent formats
&gt; such as 86open and ELF, it should be possible to make a binary
&gt; that could be portable across many platforms.

So there are products that will convert say Alpha instruction ELF's to x86
instruction ELF's etc ? I didn't know they existed. 

Also, i was reading an article in the Dr Dobbs journal at the start of the
year that talked about "Remote Agent's". These are programs that simply
"float" around the internet in an interpreter style environment and do
things like network maintenance etc.

A bit dangerous, but highly interesting ;). One of the agents they talked
about was a program that gathered finger information on a group of hosts.
Very clever indeed. It would be a whole new avenue to explore. 

&gt; &gt; It's a different ball game in the Unix world. Most programs are
&gt; &gt; distributed in the system independent form of source code-
&gt; 
&gt; Not true.  Most free software yes, most commercial software no.

When you purchase this commercial unix software, do you buy it off the
shelf?, or do you download it from public FTP site, or off the vendors ftp
site?.  How is most commercial Un*x software acquired (from your
experiences)?.

&gt; True, buffer overflows are tied to a platform/CPU, but things like the 
&gt; sendmail debug exploit of old are *totally* system independent.  There are
&gt; very few of these around but they still do exist, and it is trivial for
&gt; a developer to forget about good procedure and put a back door in.

Yes i agree here... but pretty rare to say the least. I think this is the
exception.

But you have to agree with me that the small machine dependant style
viruses that you used to get on single user systems like Mac, and MSDOS
couldn't practically exist on Linux?. They were heaverly system dependent
because they were msdos x86 executables that were composed of x86
instructions, used the pc bios, and did things to the hardware that it
could only do on pc's (you talk to pc hardware via port registers, other
more advanced CPU's have mapped IO memory, different instructions,
different byte sex, different word precision). The diversity of hardware,
and un*x, is so great.. I just couldn't think how i could write a virus.

&gt; But commercial applications may not have source, and you may have no other
&gt; option to trust it.  Some applications even require setuid root to work
&gt; properly.  You can't look at the code, you *HAVE* to trust it. 

These are pretty big reputable companies, releasing packeted software.
I just find it unbelievable for this to happen. I couldn't see how a
backyard operator would globally release a Linux/Unix related destructive
product and bring down half the worlds machines, or even a fraction of the
worlds machines without being noticed, reported, and ellimated before it 
effected everybody.

See ya
