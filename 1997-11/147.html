&gt; Well, i be damned, although, this program would still have to combat the

Certaintly.. But several different types of the virus may be released, one
for IRIX, one for BSD and one for Linux, for example. While they'll not
work on the machine which doesn't support it, one of them will, and if
they're distributed correctly, that'll make for some mayhem!
  
&gt; Yes, i wrote a backdoor into a program i did a few years ago.

Really? What program was it (reply via personal e-mail if you feel the
list isn't appropriate; or don't reply about it at all!).
