&gt; &gt; By what you have indicated the people who are attacking
&gt; &gt; fit into the later category and hence you have traced it

&gt; &gt; to the PPP connection.  Note that they could still be
&gt; &gt; spoofing valid IP addresses for some poor schmuck who is
&gt; &gt; going
&gt; &gt; to get the blame.
&gt; 
&gt; I've just joined the list, so I haven't seen the previous threads, but
&gt; couldn't you setup your firewall rules with ipfwadm to deny all packets
&gt; from that IP address?

I suggested that.  

Another problem is that if the attacker is using OOB packets they
would possibly be spoofing their IP address.  This means that they could
get past most of the IPFW stuff quite easily, unless of course you deny
everything.

We would really need to know more about the network topology to work out
what the best solution is.
