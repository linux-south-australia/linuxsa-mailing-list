&gt; &gt; Ladies and Gentlemen,
&gt; &gt; I have a problem with a small Linux box that I'd appreciate some help with.
&gt; &gt; I am wishing to run this machine as a gateway only.  No  keyboard and no
&gt; &gt; monitor; just a box with a network cable running out of it.
&gt; &gt; The problem I'm having is that if I turn off (disable) the keyboard and/or
&gt; &gt; video in the BIOS, LILO refuses to load properly.
&gt; &gt; All I end up getting is "LI-" and lots of noise from the speaker. How do I
&gt; &gt; tell LILO to ignore the keyboard and video hardware settings??
&gt; &gt; I really don't wish to have to have a keyboard and monitor on this beast.  
&gt; &gt; The video setting won't matter I'm fairly sure, but the keyboard being
&gt; &gt; switched off at the BIOS is important for me to be able to boot without a
&gt; &gt; keyboard attached!
&gt; 
&gt; There might not be a solution.  It seems that "it just works" for some
&gt; computers and "it just doesn't work" for others.  I had a server that
&gt; I _had_ to have a keyboard attached to (regardless of the BIOS
&gt; setting), otherwise Linux wouldn't load.  The replacement server
&gt; didn't need a keyboard.

There are some BIOS's out there that will not boot without
a keyboard attached. Find another motherboard if you have this problem.

&gt; The "LI-" is unusual though.  The "LILO start message" section in the
&gt; LILO documentation mentions "L", "LI", "LIL?", and "LIL-" but not
&gt; "LI-".

Does this problem occur when you disable the keyboard, but leave
all video enabled? Again this might be a find another motherboard
problem. I suggest not disabling the video, even if you don't
have a monitor attached, because it's always useful if the machine
goes down. I have a machine which never has a monitor on it, but I
leave an old VLB card in it, enabled. This machine also has a
(very) cheap keyboard connected to it so I can cleanly shut it down
when I need to (occasionally) move it.
