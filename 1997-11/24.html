&gt; What I want to know why would you want to cripple a perfectly good
&gt; operating system with Micor$oft crap.

This is a completely unfair comment because a lot of Microsoft's stuff
is very good or better.  Word, Excel and Visual C++ are three products
that spring immediately to my mind as examples of superb software, which
is not to say that they are perfect--no software is--but I think any
sensible analysis would have to agree that they are closer to perfect
than to crap.  At least one of these products is the market leader, and
this speaks volumes to it's 'crapness' (or otherwise.)

The emotive charge, "Micor$oft crap" (SIC), is doubly damaging because
it is so clearly delusional.  We are in an age where Microsoft is trying
to displace Unix, and this comes from the mouth of one who should be
arguing in favour of Unix.  The comment is so clearly bigotted and wrong
that it must make people question the veracity of everything else which
comes from that mouth.

Never, ever say anything bad about the opposition unless you are certain
you can justify your claim in a dispassionate and unbiased forum.  It's
better to say nothing about them than to be emotionally dramatic.

I personally use IE3 on my workstation, which is a Windows-95 machine,
not because I think it's brilliant, but only because it happens to be
free.  As a matter of fact, IE3 appears to be at least adequate as a
browser, and I dare say that IE4 is better.  How does it compare to
Netscape, or CyberDog, or any of the other credible competing products?
I don't know, I imagine they all have their advantages.  Microsoft's
browser at least has a cost advantage, and may even be technically
better for all I know or care.  Again, it's not crap.

Note that I think all people who choose IE3 for only cost reasons should
be "beaten viciously" because it's obvious that Microsoft isn't giving
it away as a favour, but to crush the competition.  Everyone should
support the competition where doing so gives a satisfactory result for a
satisfactory cost.  That goes for languages, user software, and operating
system software.
