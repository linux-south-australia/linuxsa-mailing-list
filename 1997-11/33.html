I can't discuss this with you because you won't debate rationally.
You obviously have a large chip on your shoulder and refuse to see
any good in Microsoft's products.  That's very sad for you.
The fact that there are faults in Microsoft's products, such as that
they take up a lot of disk space, or that they have some bugs, or that
you don't like the feel of them, does not make them crap.  If it did
there would be no software product that was not crap.  And by those
standards, even you would be crap.

&gt; Visual C++: Slower than Delphi

Goodness, you are so irrational on this that you think it's okay to
compare a C++ compiler with a Pascal compiler.


&gt; it overfeatured, badly written, buggy, expensive

How would you know if Microsoft code was badly written?  Have you ever
seen any?  I suspect you are basing your opinion on the logic that because
you hate Microsoft their code writing practices must therefore be bad.


&gt; It took me 3 weeks to try to set up the MICROSOFT CRAP (and I use the
&gt; word advisedly) IIS3 with frigging Developer suite.

Well look, Borland have had some complete fizzers too, but that doesn't
make the rest of the products crap.  Why is your standard on Microsoft
so much higher?  Nobody was talking about IIS3, but about IE4.  I added
Word, Excel and VC++ to the fray, by way of examples that Microsoft have
good products.


&gt; amateurs like you keep grunting in ectasy at its graphical interfaces.

This is the greatest cheek of all.  As it happens I'm a professional with
20 years experience.  That's probably why I can defend a company that
I don't particularly like.  You, on the other hand, can do nothing but
gibber mindless screeches while keeping your eyes firmly closed and your
head up your ... in the sand.

You don't even know me.  You know almost nothing about me.  You'll find
an awful lot of people in Adelaide who actually do know me, and who are
likely to draw unfavorable conclusions about you based on your ignorant
and juvenile attempt to insult.  You can't even tell the difference between
a reasoned discussion and a grunt of ectasy (SIC).

You should grow up, apologise to me for the unwarranted cheek, apologise
to this list for frothing at the mouth, and accept that Microsoft is NOT
synonymous with crap.  You should also keep in mind that your rantings
are now on public record, and in years to come someone searching for
everything you ever said is going to read them.  I'd be embarrassed.
(In fact I *am* embarrassed by some of the things I've said before. :))
