I can't remember who was asking a while ago about alpha motherboards 
and availability etc, but this PR list of oem's might be of help. I've 
tried to cut out most of the "uninteresting marketing information" and 
just leave the more relevant stuff... It's not directly linux related, 
so hit delete now if you aren't interesting in axp ...


FOURTEEN SYSTEM VENDORS WORLDWIDE
ANNOUNCE PCs BASED ON ALPHA 21164PC CHIP

LAS VEGAS, Nev., November 17, 1997 - Today at the COMDEX show in Las
Vegas, fourteen leading-edge computer system manufacturers announced
new, low-cost PCs based on the Alpha 21164PC microprocessor.  New
systems will be available in the sub- $2,600 price category and will
contain the Alpha 21164PC chip and Alpha PC164SX  motherboard, which
were introduced last spring.

The companies introducing Alpha 21164PC systems include:

AHCS International		MaxVision Corporation  A-Trend
Technology Co. Ltd.		Microway, Inc.
Alta Technology, Inc.		Multiwave Technology, Inc.
Aspen Systems, Inc.		Polywell Computer, Inc.
Carrera Computers, Inc.		Tri-Star Computer, Inc.
DCG Computers, Inc.  		Visual Technology, Inc.
Enorex Microsystems, Inc.	Vobis Microcomputer AG
			
Dan Casaletto, vice president, Alpha Microprocessor Product Line at
Digital Semiconductor, a Digital Equipment Corporation business,
welcomed the introductions  as evidence of the growing market
opportunity for Alpha among consumers who want top  visual computing
performance at an affordable price.

"These new systems represent the range of the lowest-priced Alpha
machines on the market," Casaletto said.  "As companies roll out their 
new AlphaPowered systems,  more and more users will discover awesome
Alpha performance for visual computing  such as image processing,
video editing, and Web content development - and that they  can have
it for less than $2,600."

The Alpha 21164PC microprocessor, co-designed with Mitsubishi
Electric, is  marketed and sold by Digital Semiconductor, Mitsubishi
and Samsung Electronics.  The processor runs at speeds of 400MHz,
466MHz and 533MHz.  It delivers estimated performance ranging up to
12.4  SPECint95 and 16.1 SPECfp95, to power the lowest  priced,
highest performance Windows NT based systems available today.

Ken Maruno, general manager, Alpha Product Marketing at Mitsubishi
Electric  Corporation, said, "The Alpha 21164PC microprocessor
represents an excellent competitive opportunity for high-volume Alpha 
in the Windows NT market.  Mitsubishi is promoting the wider adoption 
of Alpha technology by building the Alpha 21164PC  chip and board
products for the high-volume system market."

"This lineup of system manufacturers using the Alpha 21164PC processor 
is the beginning of a growing source of performance-focused PCs and an 
expanding market for  our Alpha chips," said Syed Ali, executive
director CPU Marketing for Samsung  Electronics Ltd.  "Samsung sees a 
bright future for Alpha systems as the best performers  in the Windows 
NT visual computing market."

To enhance its visual computing performance lead, the Alpha 21164PC
was the first Alpha processor to utilize motion video instruction
(MVI) extensions.  Added to the  base Alpha architecture, these
instructions accelerate the performance of video data  compression
algorithms that implement MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video and prevailing
videoconferencing standards.  MVI will be included in all future Alpha 
microprocessors.
