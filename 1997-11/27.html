&gt; &gt; What I want to know why would you want to cripple a perfectly good
&gt; &gt; operating system with Micor$oft crap.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a completely unfair comment because a lot of Microsoft's stuff
&gt; is very good or better.  Word, Excel and Visual C++ are three products
&gt; that spring immediately to my mind as examples of superb software, which
&gt; is not to say that they are perfect--no software is--but I think any
&gt; sensible analysis would have to agree that they are closer to perfect
&gt; than to crap.  At least one of these products is the market leader, and
&gt; this speaks volumes to it's 'crapness' (or otherwise.)

Although in a lot of ways I agree on both channels.  (Yes I
know splinters
come from sitting of fences.)

Microsoft has improved the quality of their software. 
Although it might be
to some extent familiarity, I don't mind the feel of some MS
software.
If you compare the quality of Word 2.0 and Word 97 they are
a world apart.

I too use MS software on my machine, but that is sometimes
because it is
the best tool for the job.

&gt; The emotive charge, "Micor$oft crap" (SIC), is doubly damaging because
&gt; it is so clearly delusional.  We are in an age where Microsoft is trying
&gt; to displace Unix, and this comes from the mouth of one who should be
&gt; arguing in favour of Unix.  The comment is so clearly bigotted and wrong
&gt; that it must make people question the veracity of everything else which
&gt; comes from that mouth.

It does frustrate me sometimes when I hear Linux (or other
OS) advocates
rephrasing Microsoft Windows to Micro$oft Window$ or
Microsloth Windoze,
and then in the same sentence try to fight viemently that
Linux is the 
better option.

Linux is the better options in a lot (and ever increasing)
of cases.  
But there is a need for products of Microsoft's ilk.

A company like Microsoft does not get to a market
*stranglehold* like
is has with just pure technical brilliance.  Gates (and his
marketeers)
have done a brilliant job of selling a sometimes technically
stunted 
product to a large portion of the market.

&gt; Never, ever say anything bad about the opposition unless you are certain
&gt; you can justify your claim in a dispassionate and unbiased forum.  It's
&gt; better to say nothing about them than to be emotionally dramatic.

One thing I did notice about when there was the negative
Linux article
in the Times in the UK, how few other magazines jumped on
the band wagon.
I think that in some ways Linux has got a lot more good
publicity in
the way that the Community did not mail bomb the author,
espousing the
virtues of Linux against "Micro$oft crap [sic]".  

APC mentioned that that was something that the Linux
Community should be
praised for, showing a mature, even headed attitude towards
publicity and
IT in general.  I think that paraphrasing/substituting names
is along a
similar line.  By not saying anything and exercising
restraint the Linux
community was respected.

There is and always will be strong advocates for various
things.  But keep 
in mind that no-matter what you say, think or do, the market
will ensure
that the fittest survives.  Be that due to marketing,
technical or just
folklore.

&gt; Note that I think all people who choose IE3 for only cost reasons should
&gt; be "beaten viciously" because it's obvious that Microsoft isn't giving
&gt; it away as a favour, but to crush the competition.  Everyone should
&gt; support the competition where doing so gives a satisfactory result for a
&gt; satisfactory cost.  That goes for languages, user software, and operating
&gt; system software.

Now that I have said be nice to Microsoft, I also think that
the way in
which Microsoft take technical shortcuts for corporate gain
is a problem.
They are not known for following established standards.  

It is true that they have a monopoly, it also follows that
they can throw
their weight around and try to establish competing
standards.  But again
the best presented will (in most cases) win.  I don't think
that Linux 
will get to many inroads if people put MS just because they
are there.

That said, take a step back and try to convince your
grandmother to use 
Linux for writing a letter to you.  I think that there will
be very
few choices for her. (I assume no-one has a *hacker*
granny).

If the Linux Community shows a mature even-headed approach
to presenting
Linux then Linux might stand a chance.

Another way of putting it, would you buy a brand A from
someone if they
always seemed bitter about brand B?  It would possibly lead
me the 
opposite way to B just to see what the fuss is about.  On
the other hand
if brand A was compared (as David said) evenly with B and
shown to be
better then I would definately by A.  

Nuff said.

ciao

Matt
