Agreed totally and Wholesomely 8-). We should make the list professional.
I'll admit, I've just started a Melbourne based Linux Group. Matthew
suggested that LUV had a little bit of fluff on it. 

Not being critical, but the last several posts seemed to be fluff --
something we all should stop doing. Fair enough, Microsloth is the
worst company in the World. Even I beleive that, and I *know* everybody on
the list does.

Please direct such postings into alt.flames or something, I don't think
they're appropriate for a 'linux support' mailing list. Somebody want to
flame me for that (please don't.. /somebody/ has to pay for the bandwidth) 

Calm down guys. I think a version of IE 4.0 for UNIX should just prove
Microsoft's ignorance.

 Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies
 the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry
 penguin charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more
 careful about what they say if they had.
