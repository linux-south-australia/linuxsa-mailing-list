&gt; Wow, You sure know your stuff man.
&gt; By the virtue of this complement device I will
&gt; now try to extract some more esotericTCP/IP knowledge.
Here goes.

&gt; How can I track down an IPs login account on an ISP?
&gt; I can get it down to the PPP port most of the time
&gt; but then I have no means of getting the user login.
&gt; Aaaah... for the good old days when people were working
&gt; from Unix boxes! These OOB attackers are giving me the pips.

You could try using the ipfw stuff to stop suspect packets.
As I said before I haven't played with IPMASQ/IPFW before
and so I am just playing with the concepts.

That would stop the OOB packets.  Depending of course on
your network topology.

Let's expand the scenario.  If I understand correctly (I
don't know the acronym for that :).  An hacker of any 
intelligence would spoof their IP address also.  But from
my experience you also a large number of *LUSERS* (using the
correct terminology :) that get an exploit and do it anyway.

If they spoof then you can't track them.

By what you have indicated the people who are attacking
fit into the later category and hence you have traced it
down
to the PPP connection.  Note that they could still be 
spoofing valid IP addresses for some poor schmuck who is
going
to get the blame.
