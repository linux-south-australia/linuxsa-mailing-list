Pine is simply a mail-user-agent (MUA). What this means is that its' only
useful purpose is to send and receive e-mail. It will /not/ dial for you. 

You need to enlist the help of another program, called pppd (for PPP) or
dip (for SLIP) to /dial/ netcom, and a program called fetchmail to get
/mail/ off netcom.

Pine includes a basic SMTP delivery agent, so you don't need to worry too
much about setting up a proper delivery agent properly. 

&gt; PS: Netcom says all it has for me is my DNS numbers to help me access the
&gt; net with linux !!! (?)

You should ask netcom to give you a permanent IP address. However, in my
recent dealings with them over a spam matter, it's unlikely they'll
co-operate without a bit of money on their side.

If you can put up with a temporary IP address this is fine, ie: if Windows
works, Linux can and will as well.

btw: It looks like you're in need of a good howto. Go to
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP</A> (needs to be UPPERCASE!) and you'll find some
great Linux documentation.

btw: there should be a simple browser on your RedHat CD!

 Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies
 the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry
 penguin charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more
 careful about what they say if they had.
