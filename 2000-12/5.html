&gt; Let's think about this.  Adam *did* say that most of the list messages are
&gt; duplicated, so to suggest that they were addressed to him as well as to the
&gt; list does smack of poor logic, if not something else.  What do you think
&gt; that something else might be, Robyn, since you find (I suppose) the idea
&gt; that it could be disingenuity to be uncalled for and/or rude?  Maybe Tim
&gt; hasn't seen the debate before, in which case it's poor logic, pure and
&gt; simple.  That sounds even ruder to me, but hey, I never promised that I
&gt; could do tact.

Well, I am jus a hick farmer up ere in the queensland bush so I aint too
brite. 

I am on quite a number of lists and indeed manage a fairly big one, so I
probably skim some of the posts a bit... I think the message from adam
that I saw said:

&gt;I am still getting dupes :(  Can someone at the server side please
&gt;investigate this for me :(

and I didn't read the quoted material that followed all that well, but
looking back it says:

&gt;I appear to be recieving majority of the posts from this list twice.  
&gt;It's only the odd one or two that don't get duplicated.  Am I somehow
&gt;added to the list twice?  Is anyone else experiencing this weirdness?
&gt;
&gt;I shall unsubscribe and see if I can post (which I imagine will show
&gt;whether or not my 'second self' at this same email address is active on
&gt;the mailing list), and then if not, will resubscribe and see what
&gt;happens!

'Appear' to be getting a majority? A perception perhaps. Sometimes it
feels like I'm getting two of everything as well - and the replies get
here before the questions, but that's another story...

So, do I slit my wrists now or can it wait til morning?

sheesh.

tim

I got two copies of the message again... Geez I seem to be getting TWO of
EVERYTHING... AHHHHH!!!!!
