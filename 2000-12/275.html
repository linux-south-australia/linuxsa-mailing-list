&gt; I have given you the best of my knowledge in this area and pointed you to 
&gt; a list with potentially more experience in doing the kind of thing you

For this I thank you.

&gt; are looking for. There are people on the LRP list who have done BGP using
&gt; LRP. The linuxsa list gave you a good perspective on some pro's and con's.

But they don't just use lrp they also need ot use some actual routing
software.
I di actually go and look at sites such as freesco (sattic routing only)
lpr, gated, and zebra.

I ahve read stuiff in mailing lists archives (it seems these days half
the hiost on any given search iengine/index are mailing archive
messages,ofr better or worse).

But none of that is as helpful as talking to someone has actually done
it.
Hence my carefully worded question that described I think exactly what I
was looking for.

I thanks you for your efforts, but I think I have done all of the obvious
stuff on researching the topic, I would actually liek some specific now
though.

&gt; I would not expect all the people in linuxsa who have not done it to put
&gt; their hands up and say 'No, I have not done it'.
&gt; 

No I dont think that would be useful either.

What I was hoping to find was "yes I have done it" or I"I haven't but fred
down the road has here his email address give him a try..."

Thanks

Jason
