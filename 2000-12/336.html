&gt; At APANA, we've found it quite effective to email the log to the ISP, and

&gt; take action against the offender (they can identify them from their own logs,
&gt; given the IP number,and time of day - so overseas ones need to be told our
&gt; time zone).
&gt; 
&gt; ISP's often have an address such as abuse@, or failing that just try root@ or
&gt; check on their web page for an address.

Steve,

I always do this anyway.
I sent a full report to SENet already before I sent this query
to linuxSA.
What I was looking for from linuxSA was some technical info on what
that particular kind of attack looked like.
I understood the other 90% of the attack, I think.

A couple of hours later I reported a later attack to wanadoo.fr
(in french, of course).
The only time I don't report attacks is if they're from Korea,
China or some such place, which is about 30% of all attacks.
They never, ever reply, even if the address in the DNS SOA
is correct.

I also always quote timezone, with full firewall log, and
if it's complicated, I send the tcpdump log too.
Most ISPs in the english-speaking world will send an
auto-reply to abuse@ messages.
Some actually require you to use NTP to validate your time-stamps!

If abuse@ doesn't work, I try webmaster@. Rarely does root@ work,
maybe because many of the machines don't run unix.
I also often check the ISP webpage for abuse@ addresses.
But very few ISPs indeed have info on where to
send abuse reports. That surprises me really.
I almost always have to guess.
The DNS SOA is the most reliable source of info on who to
send messages to mostly.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
