&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is cheaper than
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; analogue phone lines :)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is much more expensive
&gt; &gt;&gt; than in Australia.  Local calls, data or voice (at least they got that
&gt; &gt;&gt; bit right) cost $0.10 per 90 seconds.  Until a couple of years ago,
&gt; &gt;&gt; German telecommunications looked like something out of the dark ages.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The symbol was a post horn with a flash around the handle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One thing that a lot of people miss is the fact that Germany has a
&gt; &gt; population of something like 4 times that of Australia in an area
&gt; &gt; the size of Victoria. They don't have to run cables so far in
&gt; &gt; Germany.
&gt;
&gt;That's not as significant as the amount of money they're roping in.
&gt;That would work here, too.

Probably, but the cable cost would be much more here, but you do have a 
valid point.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; My fathers family lives in a small town near Trier in the former
&gt; &gt; West Germany. The town only has a population of about 2000 and in
&gt; &gt; Germany is termed a Village or "Dorf" thats where the name
&gt; &gt; "Hahndorf" comes from. I think "Hahn" is a mayor or something like
&gt; &gt; that (too lazy to look it up).
&gt;
&gt;Hahn is a rooster.  In the case of Hahndorf, it was the name of the
&gt;bloke who founded it.

Correct you are.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway despite the fact that this town is small, they have fully
&gt; &gt; fledged ISDN. My uncle has his entire house ISDNified. He runs it
&gt; &gt; all through his computer and can monitor or pickup any line in the
&gt; &gt; house.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, but that's a private PABX (pretty normal stuff in Germany).  How
&gt;much did he pay for it?


I can't remember but it wasn't terribly expensive.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; He can use 2 B Channels to access the internet through T-Online the
&gt; &gt; equivalent of BigPond here, ie. the biggest telco DeutscheTelecom's
&gt; &gt; Internet arm.  He gets charged roughly 1DM per 30minutes I
&gt; &gt; think. Thats using 128K.
&gt;
&gt;If that's the case, prices have dropped rapidly.  But I suspect you're
&gt;talking about the access prices.  Even then, that's cheap for Germany.
&gt;The latest prices I have seen for Internet access in Germany are round
&gt;DM 0.049 per minute.  You used to have to add to that the cost of the
&gt;local call (DM 0.08 per minute), but I'm not sure they haven't made an
&gt;exception now.

That is the price for the t-online connection not for the actual call, 
however I seem to remember him saying something like it was a local call and 
didnt cost much anyway.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; My sister also lives in Germany and also has ISDN in her house. So
&gt; &gt; do about 20 other of my relatives in and around the same area, so
&gt; &gt; either my family is well developed and technofreaks!!!! or Germany
&gt; &gt; is just adopting ISDN and in this case a lot faster and cheaper than
&gt; &gt; Australia because mainly, they have more population per square KM
&gt; &gt; than Australia and thus the Telco's don't have to run cables so damn
&gt; &gt; far between cities.
&gt;
&gt;Look at the prices I quoted at the top of the message (right, that's
&gt;me without the attribution).  Do you disagree with them?

No I don't disagree with the fact that DeutscheTelecom is getting more money 
from their customers because they have several million more but also it 
costs them less to run the cables between cities, towns and villages than it 
does in Australia.

Hell the likelyhood of a town of 2000 getting ISDN in Australia is about as 
likely as our petrol prices going back to 70c a litre before Christmas!!
