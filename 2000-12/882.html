guys,
it was working fine, and ok for a while. i would shutdown and then reboot
and would work well. the beeping was while it was running after while, which
i thought pointed to the overheating problem.
as for the pitch of the tone, it was like high then low.
no overclocking, no smoke either... (duh!?)

i guess it was a socket 370, got it confused with my other cyrix...

i am gonna try all ya suggestions tonight, thanx a lot fellas.
now all i need is the same amount of help on my php question!!!

cheers,
jmc

&gt; &gt;  symptoms - atx celron 400, on gigabyte board, socket 7.
&gt;
&gt; umm.. wouldn't that be a socket 370?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  a while back, it was making crazy beeping noises, kinda like a late
80's
&gt; &gt;  videogame.
&gt;
&gt; Was it a single pitch tone, or multiple?  Did you count them?  Were the
&gt; tones long or short?  Was the computer working at the time, or was this
when
&gt; you powered up?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  was that overheating, think so... i thought powersupply was
&gt;
&gt; Were you overclocking? :-)  Was there smoke coming out of your case?
&gt;
&gt; Have you tried running the motherboard without no cards except video?
&gt;
&gt; Find your motherboard manual, locate the diagram for the jumper pins for
&gt; power switch, power LED, etc.  If you can't find it, write yourself a
&gt; diagram of their current positions.  Pull them all out and just insert the
&gt; power switch lead.
&gt;
&gt; If you can, try a different motherboard in your system.
&gt;
&gt; If all else fails:  Gigabyte are a fairly reputable manufacturer - the
&gt; warranty should be at least two years.  When did you buy it?  Where did
you
&gt; buy it?
&gt;
&gt; Hoping it helps,
&gt;
&gt; Jordan.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  fellas,
&gt; &gt;  i am pretty sure that my mb is dead, i need confiramtion of my worst
&gt; &gt; nightmare.
&gt; &gt; stuffed, so it
&gt; &gt;  got put it away for a month or so. i put in a new powersupply
yesterday,
&gt; (no i
&gt; &gt;  did not have a bad christmas...) but nothing. the powersupply is good,
&gt; and the
&gt; &gt;  one i took out was also good, i tried it in another system. thought it
&gt; might
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt;  the switch, tried another, no good. tried removing the switch, and
using
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; jumper,
&gt; &gt;  no good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  ok here is the thing, press the switch, and the cpu fan moves, but then
&gt; stops.
&gt; &gt;  have i killed my motherboard?? the ram that was in it is fine and
works,
&gt; as do
&gt; &gt;  all other things. video, lan sound etc.
&gt; &gt;  all things point to dead motherboard.... doh!!
&gt; &gt; &gt; any ideas??
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; thankx
&gt; &gt; &gt; james mcle
