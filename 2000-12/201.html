&gt; &gt; &gt; The multitasking I spoke of was "pre-emptive" meaning it's just real fast
&gt; &gt; &gt; task switching.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what the original responder actually meant here; he
&gt; probably did mean what you said but didn't use terms such as "timeslice"
&gt; and other jargon :-)

Timeslice is not really jargon in a discusionof multitaskignit is a pretty
fuindamental term to somethign.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I thought that pre-emptive meant that the OS decided when a process's
&gt; &gt; timeslice was up and just did the context switch the program had no say.
&gt; &gt; (as opposed ot cooperative multitaskign when the program voluntarily
&gt; &gt; yeilds cpu whenever it feels like it)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.

So there is no reltionship bewteen an os having/supproting pre-emptive
multitasking and fast context switching?

Obviouly the faster the context switch the better but whether it is fast
or slow the reason for the context switch, ie whether the process was
pre empted by the os or whetehr it yeilded or whatever other reason, is
nto related to the speed of the cotext switch?


 &gt; &gt; Ie the OS _pre-empts_ the process. I did not realisepremeptive 
&gt; &gt; multitasking was any faster in context switching. Comments?
&gt; 
&gt; It's not. How efficiently a process can allow the context to switch
&gt; includes, but is not limited to, the following factors:
&gt; 
&gt; * hardware design
&gt; * O/S design
&gt; * compiler design (i.e. the compiler could create code that was simply
&gt; not friendly to a context switch but ran really fast with few switchtes,
&gt; or it could attempt to optimize for it context switching but run not so
&gt; fast with few switches)

My hazy recollection is the work a os needs to do for a context switch is
the smae as far as I can gather no matter how many switehcs it does, ir
whether it does many or few in a given time period.

It needs to store state of the runnifg process and
restore state of the process that is about to be run.

Ie save registers ,program counter etc for process whose slice has
expired, restore registers, program counter etc fo rprocess whose
timelsice is just beging.

I thoght it needed to do all that and mroe that I have no doubt forgotten 
regardless of how many times in a given period it has to context switch.

I can easily see how hardware design would affect this and maybe see how 
os design might.

How does compiler design affect this?
