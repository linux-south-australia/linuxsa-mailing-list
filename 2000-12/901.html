&gt; Actually Alan, much as I do not like the idea of a DVD style of coding on my

&gt; specification and not compulsory)

It will be compsulory if you wish to watch Hollywood content.

Linux is threatened in much the same way as by CSS -- an operating
platform that can't display Hollywood content cannot become a
mainstream operating platform.

What's more likely to kill this is high-end business computing.
They *want* to make many, many copies of their data, they call
them back-ups.  So we might end up with ATA-spec drives with
coding and SCSI-spec drives without.  But Hollywood content
won't allow itself to be copied to SCSI-spec drives.  In this
scenario, you pay extra to run Linux and still can't watch
movies.

Alan's claim that "nobody cares" is tosh: Cox and Stallman have
made their views plain, so at least two influential people care.

What we need are people that are influential in Hollywood's world
to get the Linux virus.  This is inevitable, there's nothing so
much like a Hollywood script as the development of Linux, but the
question is one of timing.
