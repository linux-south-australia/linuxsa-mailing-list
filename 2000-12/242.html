A router is a thing that routes. Ie it moves packets from one network to
another at the (logical) network level (typically ip).

What harware or software it runs is not all that important as to what it
is.
 
A 386 linux box and static routes migth be a router, so might a $100+
juniper or cisco.

It is what it does (function) not what is is made(form) of that makes a
router a router and a host a host.

It is sort of like defining a client server.

Just because a box is big and powerful doesn;t mean it ia a server.
It could be a big powerful client.

&gt; &gt; An old ISP adage is to let routers route and servers serve. The lines are
&gt; &gt; getting a bit blurred these days as portions of policy, security, QoS and
&gt; &gt; routing are being implemented in many different kinds of network equipment
&gt; &gt; at all sorts of levels. But its a good rule of thumb. [That right, all you
&gt; &gt; ISP people here?]
&gt; 
&gt; What defines a router? Hardware containing as OS optimised for routing
&gt; running only routing based services? Or A generic OS (perhaps compiled in
&gt; a way that optimises it for routing) running only routing based
&gt; processes/services? Or hardware and OS optimised for routing? Surely
&gt; network load and so on would dictate what would be be better solution.
&gt; 
&gt; This rule can also apply to database servers, print servers, firewalls and
&gt; so on. But it also depends on capacity and load and security, among other
&gt; things.
