Hi,

&gt;  fellas,
&gt;  i am pretty sure that my mb is dead, i need confiramtion of my worst
&gt; nightmare.
&gt;  symptoms - atx celron 400, on gigabyte board, socket 7.
&gt;  a while back, it was making crazy beeping noises, kinda like a late 80's
&gt;  videogame. was that overheating, think so... i thought powersupply was
&gt; stuffed, so it
&gt;  got put it away for a month or so. i put in a new powersupply yesterday, (no i
&gt;  did not have a bad christmas...) but nothing. the powersupply is good, and the
&gt;  one i took out was also good, i tried it in another system. thought it might
&gt; be
&gt;  the switch, tried another, no good. tried removing the switch, and using a
&gt; jumper,
&gt;  no good.
&gt;  
&gt;  ok here is the thing, press the switch, and the cpu fan moves, but then stops.
&gt;  have i killed my motherboard?? the ram that was in it is fine and works, as do
&gt;  all other things. video, lan sound etc.
&gt;  all things point to dead motherboard.... doh!!
&gt; &gt; any ideas??

Your description seems to indicate a dead motherboard. Depending upon how
much is onboard, unplug all periferal devices, and cards. Leave the
monitor plugged in only. If the motherboard will power up (of if you have
an off-board video card, try as a last step unplugging that as well),
progressivly plug back in the devises till ity stops working. Otherwise,
you need a new motherboard.

cya
