Hey y'all,

I'm working on a project at the moment.  It's written, so far, purely in
PHP3.  It accesses a PostgreSQL database, an LDAP server and verious other
things.

I want a user authentication mechanism.

I could use HTTP authentication, with the $PHP_AUTH_USER variable[1].
However, I think I can see issues with this method.  I want most of the
site to be accessable without login.  Certain areas will require users to
be logged in, certain areas will be different depending on whether you're
logged in or not.  Users need to be able to log on and log off randomly.
I'm using a custom-written session management system, tailored to the needs
of the project, which uses cookies to store a session ID..

Basically, I don't think that basic HTTP authentication is going to be
suitable for my needs.

I could be totally wrong, of course - let me know if you think I'm wrong!

So, instead of HTTP WWW-authenticate type authentication, I've so far
decided to implement my own.

What I would really like to do is use PAM to validate username/password
pairs.  Then I can use the pam_ldap module and not have to worry about
doing any extra programming.

I've checked the PHP manuals - there don't seem to be any functions for
PAM.

This is either because nobody has written them - I doubt that's the reason
- or because it's not PHP's place to worry about authentication.

I want the following:

A form is drawn on the screen with a username box, password box, and submit
button.  It's stored on a secure (https) server, so the session traffic
(specifically, the password) is encrypted.  The user enters a
username/password, the PHP script takes the pair and passes it to PAM, who
validates it through all the proper channels.

Thoughts, anyone?  Am I totally wrong?  Is the WWW-authenticate method
bug-free and nice and easy to use and dynamic and stuff?  I keep reading
things on the PHP web site like:

"Both Netscape and Internet Explorer will clear the local browser window's
authentication cache for the realm upon receiving a server response of 401.
This can effectively "log out" a user, forcing them to re-enter their
username and password. Some people use this to "time out" logins, or
provide a "log-out" button."

...

"This behavior is not required by the HTTP Basic authentication standard,
so you should never depend on this. Testing with Lynx has shown that Lynx
does not clear the authentication credentials with a 401 server response,
so pressing back and then forward again will open the resource (as long as
the credential requirements haven't changed)."

*shudder* stuff that - I want something that I know will work, without
stuffing around for IE and Netscape and Lynx and argh!

Happy to accept criticism :)


Cheers..

Nick :)

		$title="Invalid Login";

			In order to proceed you will need a valid username/password.

		exit;
	}

	if(!isset($PHP_AUTH_USER)) {
		authenticate();
	} else {
		if (!($PHP_AUTH_USER == $a_valid_username) && ($PHP_AUTH_PW == $that_usernames_password)) {
			die("Invalid username and/or password.");
