&gt; In Europe (Germany I think) they have a more enlightened

&gt; sharing exchanges. They make this work by only allowing the properly

&gt; surfaces are polished stainless steel that is easily marked. At the end
&gt; of the working day, they dust for fingerprints, make a record, and clean
&gt; it for the next day's work. This means everyone can get things done
&gt; quickly, and is accountable for their actions. 

This doesn't sound like the Germany I know.  I've watched telecom
linesmen both here and there, and they do a better job here.  I've had
complete idiots change my ISDN parameters in the exchange, and nobody
even knew about it.  It took four hours of tracing to prove that they
were mangling my call setup packets.

&gt; Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is cheaper than
&gt; analogue phone lines :)

Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is much more expensive
than in Australia.  Local calls, data or voice (at least they got that
bit right) cost $0.10 per 90 seconds.  Until a couple of years ago,
German telecommunications looked like something out of the dark ages.
The symbol was a post horn with a flash around the handle.
