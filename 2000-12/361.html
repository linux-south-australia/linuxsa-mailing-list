It isn't open source, but it comes close.

The absolute best Radius server I have ever seen is Radiator, by Open
Systems Consultants in Victoria, <A HREF="http://www.open.com.au/radiator">http://www.open.com.au/radiator</A>

It's written by Hugh Irvine (who used to be a part-owner of connect.com.au),
and it really is God's Own Radius Server.

The whole thing is written in perl with a well-documented API for adding
additional plug-in modules for wierd authentication and/or accounting
schemes.  The Radiator customer mailing lists provide excellent support
as well; If you post a question about how to achieve something wierd with
Radiator, more often than not you'll get Hugh and friends sending you
a new perl module which does it (and to have an authentication scheme 
based on a group defined by the contents of a user's .plan is exactly the
kind of wierd thing I'm talking about).

Priciing is based on the number of servers you'll be running (i.e.:
If you've paid to run it on five machines, they trust you to pay more
if you use it on more than five servers).  It comes with very well-written
and easy to follow full source code in perl, free upgrades forever, full
documentation, example configurations, and great support.

 &gt; Also is it posible to simulate the NAS....
 
Not entirely sure what you mean here.  Radiator comes with a perl/tk 
application which sends Radius AAA requests to the server and displays
the responses they've yielded, if that's what you mean.  I'm not sure
about what other simulation you'd be interested in, though.
