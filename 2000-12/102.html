&gt; Part of this difference between deb and rpm based distros is probably
&gt; due to deb based distributions all originating from Debian, a
&gt; non-commerical entity - and thus not seen as nearly as big a
&gt; competitor as say Red Hat. Also AFAIK the number of RPM based
&gt; distributions is _much_ larger than deb based ones, so you expect to
&gt; see more `forking'.

I think this is a major misunderstanding, and a common one. It has to do
with the fact that a functioning open source project involves much more
than the code being available. An open source project involves a
cooperating community.

I don't regard the Debian distribution as the same thing as the Debian
collection of packages, even though nearly 100% of it by volume is the
Debian collection of packages.

The Debian distribution consists of several items including packages, an
installer, a manifesto cum philophopy cum political statement, docs
specific to Debian and a few other things. One portion of this
distribution is in itself an entire open source project, package
management. Package management is done in an open source manner by a
cooperating community.

Not one commercial distribution does that so far as I have noticed.
Control of an RPM package is done by someone who has a salary, a boss, a
deadline and maybe forty or more other packages. This does not produce as
good a result as giving control of a package to an open source team who
keep working until it is finished.

Unsuprisingly, Debian package management tends to respect the open source
maintainers of the actual programs to a greater extent. Default config
files and permissions for example are made to suit both parties, the
Debian packagers (who abide by a set of policies) and the original author
(who could well have written the package for an OS quite unlike Linux.) A
busy RPM package maintainer simply hasn't got time to talk to all the
authors and teams of all the packages involved. A Debian package
maintainer, on the other hand, often has people submitting patches to
packages and is contributing effort on a volunteer basis.

This is the reasoning that leads me to conclude that:

   1) A collection of well-maintained packages is the most important thing
      for a sound server distribution

   2) Open source package management works better. As it happens, in Linux 
      Debian is the only mass example of open source package management

   3) Regardless of the relative merits of rpm and dpkg, open source
      package management is the most important thing. If the rpm and dpkg
      technologies were suddenly exchanged overnight I would still prefer
      the open source package repository since would likely still be of a 
      better quality.
