Hi,

&gt; I have what I believe to be an Adelaide-designed Unix minicomputer that
&gt; was manufactured in Melbourne and sold for work on oil rigs and scientific
&gt; purposes. I got it from the lab at DSTO that is supposed to have designed
&gt; the machine. So there is at least one machine that was not imported
&gt; (besides the few x86 boards designed and manufactured here, the skinny
&gt; little 286 manufactured in Camden park was years ahead of its time, what
&gt; was it called now??)

Ahh, fond memories of Microbyte. The only PC system I've found that came
default with SCSI HDD, and external 5 1/4 SCSI Floppy. They were the first
PCs I had anythinhg to do with. They also did a 386 SX model. Problem was
they used non-standard BIOS, so didn't work properly with non propriotry
3.3 versions of DOS.

&gt; Melbourne has a rare treasure, the only working first-generation computer
&gt; in the world that someone discovered in a CSIRO warehouse 50 years after
&gt; it was switched off. I don't know how that restoration project is going.
&gt; Don't rule out some bizzare (imported) equivalents lurking in ghettos in
&gt; Adelaide.

It may have been reported on the Science Show early in the year.

Ok I think.

cya
