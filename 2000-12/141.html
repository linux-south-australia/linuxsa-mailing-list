&gt; This is the only good explanation I have for why there seem to be far
&gt; fewer conflicts and problems with packages on Debian server systems. As
&gt; you'll see from the discussions on freshmeat I pointed at yesterday my
&gt; experiences seem very common.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have a better explanation?

Short version:

1. Larger amount of diversity among RPM based distributions which
   results in the generation of incompatible (between distros) of RPM
   packages.

2. RPM based distributions in order to separate themselves from the
   other ones sacrifice compatability for features. Also from a
   marketing point of view they don't want to be seen as
   yet-another-redhat clone.

Long version:

Conflicts and problems with rpm packages have mostly been due to
versions of libraries and installation directories. More to the point,
conflicts and problems nearly always occur when attempting to install
an RPM built for one distribution on a different distribution.

The reason this happens more on RPM based systems than deb ones is
that there is a larger number of RPM based systems and more diversity
among these distributions compared to the deb based ones. Distros
ocassionally have different names for the same package which causes
problems with dependencies. I also suspect (though have no numbers to
back this up) that the user base of Debian is significantly larger
than commerical deb based distributions). Simply speaking, taking a
random deb package to be installed on a random deb based distribution,
chances are it was built on a Debian system, and will be installed on
a Debian system. Not the same situation with RPM based systems.

Different distributions have at different times decided when it was
best for them (and their users) to switch to new versions of
particular libraries. Take glibc as an example - there was a time
period of approximately 1.5-2 years between Red Hat releasing a
distribution which replaced libc5 with glibc and Caldera releasing
one. Both distributors had valid reasoning for the timing of their
upgrades.

Thus for a significant period of time, if a RedHat user released an
RPM package of a program, it was easy to produce one which not work on
a Caldera system as the version of libc against which it was
dynamically linked would not exist. Note that this problem (though on
a much smaller scale) is currently happening again with the glibc 2.2
upgrades.

Although these problems generally haven't occurred on deb based
systems, you are likely to run into very similar problems if you try
to install a deb package built for woody (Debian unstable) onto potato
(Debian stable) or slink (older Debian stable). You can view
incompatability problems between different releases of Debian as
similar to incompatability problems between different distributions.

No matter how the RPM based distributions handle their package
management development there are going to be compatability problems
until they can agree on at least a minimal common base on which to
generate packages.

Chris.
