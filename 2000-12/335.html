I have just been playing around with apc Linux pocketbook 3 and have =3D
installed rh7
Everything went very smoothly - all hardware detected (except it only =
=3D
detected 64 mb of ram instead of 128 ? But more on that later.)
except I cant get anywhere on the internet.
After many many many tries to connect I finally had success.
using RHppp dialler in KDE I got error message -" unable to activate =3D
interface"=3D20
( under GNOME I got a lot of " Application rp3 (process 10885) has =3D
crashed due to fatal error (segmentation Fault)
KPPP seemed a bit more stable and would connect everytime but then "ppd =
=3D
daemon died unexpectedly" within 2 seconds.
Using the logs I was getting the errors
    peer is not authorized to use remote address 203.38.231.193
or
    LCP terminated by peer (^@^@M_^@&lt;M-Mt^@^@^@W)
I seemed to be able to get around these problems by playing with the =3D
dialup settings.
i.e.: autoconfigure hostname from this IP shutting down DNS when =3D
connected etc
Finally I could connect every time. But could not get anywhere No DNS =
=3D
appears to be assigned as Netscape and mail were a complete loss
but I could ping some ip addresses some of the time - (explanation I =3D
would ping one ip address and it would work then Id try another and it =
=3D
would say network unavailable then I'd try the original one again and it =
=3D
would not work - network unavailable pinging www addresses would never =
=3D
work)
I Know this all sounds a bit like Gibberish and very very vague but it =
=3D
was 3AM.
Does anyone have any idea where I'm going wrong.

A Bit more info to help you :
    I work for the ISP that I'm trying to connect to - checked this =3D
mornings logs at work and could not find any errors only me logging on =
=3D
about 50 times.
    the night before this I installed the mandrake & KDE (from the apc =
=3D
pocket book) on the same machine and connected to the net first time =3D
every time surfed - mailed - news etc etc ( Connection set-up was =3D
quicker that in windows )
    The only difference between the two nights hardware set-up was for =
=3D
the RH install I had taken my network card out. (maybe it hasn't =3D
installed something I need)
Once again sorry about the Gibberish but any help would be appreciated !
