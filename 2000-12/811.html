Hi Alan,
	It looks as if they want to stop the 'imaging' of drives; eg `dd
if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/hdb` or using such tools as Ghost to do the same
job.  Strange though, why would they deem it necessary?  What is there
to protect?  The data is not thiers, therefore the restriction on
copying a disk would be contrary to legislation I would have thought.

&gt; 
&gt; This hasn't hit slashdot yet, though I don't know why.
&gt; Maybe they're at a party.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an excerpt:
&gt; 
&gt; =======================================================
&gt; Hastening a rapid demise for the free copying of digital media,
&gt; the next generation of hard disks is likely to come with
&gt; copyright protection countermeasures built in.
&gt; 
&gt; Technical committees of NCTIS, the ANSI-blessed standards
&gt; body, have been discussing the incorporation of content
&gt; protection currently used for removable media into
&gt; industry-standard ATA drives, using proprietary technology
&gt; originating from the 4C Entity. They're the people who brought
&gt; you CSS2: IBM, Toshiba Intel and Matsushita.
&gt; 
&gt; The scheme envisaged brands each drive with a unique
&gt; identifier at manufacturing time.
&gt; 
&gt; The proposals are already at an advanced stage: three drafts
&gt; have already been discussed for incorporating CPRM (Content
&gt; Protection for Recordable Media) into the ATA specification
&gt; by the NCTIS T.13 committee. The committee next meets in
&gt; February. If, as expected, the CPRM extensions become part of
&gt; the ATA specification, copyright protection will be in every
&gt; industry-standard hard disk by next summer, according to IBM
&gt; =======================================================
&gt; 
&gt; Could somebody more clued up than me please say what's going
&gt; on here?
&gt; I get the impression you won't be able to read the contents
&gt; of your own disk drive without getting some keys off the net
&gt; or something like that.
&gt; All current disk backup software will fail, and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt; It's like all the worst things about DVD encryption
&gt; transposed onto the standard hard disk.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone been following this development?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
