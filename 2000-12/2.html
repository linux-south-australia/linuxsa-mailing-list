&gt; &gt; I think the dupes are there because of the way the list is set up...
&gt; 
&gt; I feel that you must surely recall that being discussed many times before,
&gt; and that the consensus always was that the list does it the right way.  It
&gt; correctly leaves the sender's address untouched.  Adam said that most of the
&gt; list messages are duplicated.  Unless you honestly believe that they were
&gt; all addressed to him as well as the list your suggestion smacks of extremely
&gt; poor logic or a disingenious attempt to restart a tired old debate.  Please
&gt; do not resurrect the "I want the sender/from address rewritten" debate.

Um, gee, no, sorry. I don't think I've been on the list that long and
haven't seen any previous discussion on the subject, merely suggesting as
to how it might have happened... eg I get a lot of dupe mail when people
respond to one of my questions. It doesn't particularly worry me as I just
change to address when I respond as I am now and I have a quick alias set
in pine for the list... PLaces like egroups, which most people use, it's
simply a matter of replying, whereas if you reply to all here (at least
with pine) then the message gets sent to the list and the individual. 

I'm upset and deaply hurt that you think I have poor logic and am trying
to disrupt the list and so I am going to go away and cry now and probably
won't post to the list any more.

tonight.

tim

BTW, I got two copies of the message.
