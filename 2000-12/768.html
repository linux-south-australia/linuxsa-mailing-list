Hi Robyn,

&gt; What's the difference between passive and non-passive ftp

Quick summary:

    FTP uses two connections between you and the FTP server - one
    for commands, one for file transfers - the latter is made by
    the server to you, the former by you to the server.  Firewalls
    don't generally like this.

    Passive FTP uses one connection between you and the FTP server
    and both commands and file transfers are effected across the
    same connection.  Firewalls generally like this.

More detail:

Normal (non-passive) FTP sees the FTP client (program) connect
to the FTP server (also a program) using a TCP channel to port
21 on the remote server.

The FTP client executes FTP commands over this TCP stream but
any resulting file transfers and/or directory listings are not
delivered over the same TCP stream, but in fact the FTP server
establishes a *new* TCP stream back to your computer, allowing
the FTP server take advantage of TCP sliding window protocols
to make best use of available bandwidth, among other things.

Passive FTP is when the FTP client connects to the FTP server
using a TCP channel to port 21 on the remote server also using
this channel for executing commands, however all file transfer
and directory listings are transferrred inside that same client
opened TCP channel as well - meaning a firewall doesn't need to
allow a remote site to connect to an inside host to effect any
file transfers (unlike when using non-passive).

&gt; and which is the better one to use?

Depends on your circumstances, behind a tight firewall that
prevents non passive FTP, then passive is the best - otherwise,
normal FTP is probably better as it makes better use of TCP's
sliding window flow control protocols.

There are plenty of more technical (and perhaps more specifically
accurate) descriptions of how the FTP protocol actually works, 
but I think the above summary makes it easy to understand.

Cheers

Leigh
