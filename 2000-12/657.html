&gt; [1] Can anyone explain how Gnumeric+Abiword etc fits into OpenOffice,
&gt; which is sort-of what the Gnome Foundation say they are aiming for?
&gt; OpenOffice (ex-StarOffice) is usable but with a monster code base, Gnome
&gt; Office is promising but not very functional comparitively, and I can't see
&gt; how the two can be fused in any timeframe that matters (ie, years.)

GNOME Office is just that - the GNOME office suite.  It may or may not include
portions of OpenOffice.  Currently GNOME office includes abiword, gnumeric, dia,
gimp, eog, gnome-pim and gnome-db.  Portions of OpenOffice may be added and
other bits may be removed as time progresses.

OpenOffice is mandated by Sun to be released under two licences - the GPL and
the SISSL (the Sun community licence thing).  Consequently the abiword (or any
other free software) cannot be merged into OpenOffice unless the authors of the
free software also agree to release under the SISSL (which means allowing Sun to
make a commercial product from your code).  For example, Abiword has over 100
authors, so logistically speaking it's just about impossible to merge the two
code bases as you'd need to contact all the abiword contributors and get their
permission :-(  

There are a number of projects ongoing to componentise OO and others to provide
CORBA bridging technology for OO and bonobo (ie GNOME OLE (sort of:)) to
communicate seemlessly.  So at the end of the day it all may come together,
which may take some time, but in the mean time the openning up of all that code
is a good thing because existing projects can (and are) reusing instead of
writing from scratch.  It is my understanding that GNOME / KDE office people are
incorporating OpenOffice code in their respective projects as we speak :-)

When it comes to GNOME office functionality can I suggest waiting a small number
of months until GNOME 2.0 arrives?  The new bonobo-ised desktop and apps are
quite complete functionality-wise and interroperability-wise.  Should be *very*
cool!
