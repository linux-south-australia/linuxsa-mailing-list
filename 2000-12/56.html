&gt; I assume it's no big deal to pull new services through an existing

&gt; sorts of things you can only fill when you build them?

depends on how long the duct is. I recently saw a couple of guys have a
hell of a time putting a new cable through a mere 35 feet (approx) of
ducting. Anyway, in rural areas they do it the cheap way. They drop the
cables into a trench - no ducting - and fill in in. And by rural I mean
outside a major city. Even if they did use some sort of ducting, I doubt
they would be able to feed new (additional) cable through the distances
involved...
 
&gt; It's what one does when the government says, "other utilities are
&gt; underground in this area, so you do the same," yet you don't want to pay the
&gt; up-front expense of putting in your own trench.  Simple enough concept.

I guess you are talking city applications. I really doubt it will ever
apply to rural areas. Services in rural areas are poor, but of course
nobody lives there so there's not enough money involved to make it
worthwhile... Everything is done as cheap as possible.

Even though the country depends on the rural sector totally... But of
course the farmers are just whingers according to our fattass overpaid
polititions... They can feel free to come out and figure out how to
produce a crop on zero income...
