&gt; I have recently acquired the download version of Linux Mandrake 7.2.  
&gt; After using Diskdrake to partition the hard drive and assign mount

&gt; that my CD installation disc could be corrupt as some important
&gt; packages could not be installed and then on the next step the error
&gt; 'hdlist not found' and I can not do much from there.  I suspect that
&gt; 7.2 has been released prematurely from some reports that I have been
&gt; getting from around the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any ideas - please let me know.

No ideas, really, except that the disk has a problem. Is it and iso you
burned or did you buy it? Or is it the pressed version

I got my Duck7.2 on cdr from everythinglinux and installed it on two
machines. Runs on both, tho having some x probs on one. On this box it's
my main work machine, tho I'm still in the process of moving things over
as I did a clean install. 

7.2 does have a lot of new packages, like KDE2, which are a bit raw. but
it generally does work and some of the stuff is very nice. The new
konquerer browses the whole network and samba shares nicely so that even
my wife can handle it at last. Sure, a bit windowish... But better :-)

The install on this box went pretty well flawless, tho there do seem to be
a few glitches in the package selection - not as bad as a previous version
as I remember.

Premature... Maybe, but I'm happy. I'm sure the next will be
better. Everything is developing so quickly it's hard to get a 100%
perfect install it seems.
