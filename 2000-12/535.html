&gt; Has ANYONE had any luck with CUPS on MD7.2
&gt; 
&gt; I can get a test page with various drivers and that's about it. I can
&gt; print text from a couple of apps, though tend to get bits cut off here and
&gt; there. I can't print direct from a term as it cuts off the left margin by
&gt; one character, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to remove it, but it seems that there are a dozen dependency
&gt; problems... I hate it so much I'd like to go back to lpd which worked fine
&gt; before, but it seems that things like printtool are missing (replaced by
&gt; links to printerdrake and CUPS stuff...
&gt; 
&gt; But really, what's the use of a test page. You'd think if it printed a
&gt; test page then it would print other stuff as well. But graphics from
&gt; netscape, gimp, etc are crap... Usually a black blob...
&gt; 
&gt; Pity, as it's a nice distro otherwise. But I feel if I can't work it then
&gt; dog help the newbies....

Works perfectly for me and my Canon bjc 210 printer. Have you done a
MandrakeUpdate to get the latest fixes???
