&gt; Which is what I expect to happen when they say, "we'll put it above ground
&gt; now, and move it later."  Cynical or realistic?  I think the latter.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also if you dont have ht emoney now but expect to have it later....
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm.  Telstra doesn't have the money?  What an interesting concept.  Optus?
&gt; I guess they have just as much dosh.  Electricity suppliers?  No shortage of
&gt; dought there.  Did I miss anybody?

I have to agree. The only thing missing is the will to act in a certain
way. While there is a choice between options, and one option uses less
money in the short term, then that option will be chosen. The only
things that might change that are legislation, massive risk of
prosecution by third party, or overwhelming market opportunity. None of
the above loom.
