Jason!

&gt; Timeslice is not really jargon in a discusionof multitaskignit is a pretty
&gt; fuindamental term to somethign.

I agree, but the original poster obviously would have thought it was
jargon...(otherwise he probably would have said something similar to
what you said).

&gt; So there is no reltionship bewteen an os having/supproting pre-emptive
&gt; multitasking and fast context switching?

Not as far as I can recall. 

&gt; Obviouly the faster the context switch the better but whether it is fast
&gt; or slow the reason for the context switch, ie whether the process was
&gt; pre empted by the os or whetehr it yeilded or whatever other reason, is
&gt; nto related to the speed of the cotext switch?

I don't believe so to a noticeable degree. Depending on the
implementation, a context switch which was known about (i.e. the process
KNOWS it is about to give up context) could be optimised to happen more
quickly, than if it were forced by the operating system. But a good
implementation attempts to minimise these differences because context
switching is supposed to be transparent.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I thoght it needed to do all that and mroe that I have no doubt forgotten
&gt; regardless of how many times in a given period it has to context switch.

Yes, but it doesn't need to save the registers if there's only one
process ever running (such as in MS-DOS)...

&gt; I can easily see how hardware design would affect this and maybe see how
&gt; os design might.
&gt; 
&gt; How does compiler design affect this?

I would surmise that you could write assembly which relied on a lot of
context specific stuff, and assembly which did not. But I don't write
assembly :-) One thing that springs to mind is that you're likely to
lose registers in a context switch, so if you only every spoke to memory
it may be more efficient in the long term....you could avoid having
stuff that is always around (const declarations for example) stored in a
place that would be affected by context switching and so forth...
