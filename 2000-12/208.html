&gt; &gt; Obviouly the faster the context switch the better but whether it is fast

&gt; &gt; nto related to the speed of the cotext switch?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe so to a noticeable degree. Depending on the
&gt; implementation, a context switch which was known about (i.e. the process
&gt; KNOWS it is about to give up context) could be optimised to happen more
&gt; quickly, than if it were forced by the operating system. But a good
&gt; implementation attempts to minimise these differences because context
&gt; switching is supposed to be transparent.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I thoght it needed to do all that and mroe that I have no doubt forgotten
&gt; &gt; regardless of how many times in a given period it has to context switch.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but it doesn't need to save the registers if there's only one
&gt; process ever running (such as in MS-DOS)...

Then you dont ahve a multitaskign system and cotext switching is not an
issue.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can easily see how hardware design would affect this and maybe see how
&gt; &gt; os design might.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How does compiler design affect this?
&gt; 
&gt; I would surmise that you could write assembly which relied on a lot of
&gt; context specific stuff, and assembly which did not. But I don't write
&gt; assembly :-) One thing that springs to mind is that you're likely to
&gt; lose registers in a context switch, so if you only every spoke to memory
&gt; it may be more efficient in the long term....you could avoid having
&gt; stuff that is always around (const declarations for example) stored in a
&gt; place that would be affected by context switching and so forth...

I am not sure if it is possible write programs (unless you hadn assemble
them) that don;t use registers. If you did I think they would be very slow
and memory acess is quite slow compared to register access, I blieve.

You shouldn't  lose registers in a context switch, that is part of a
context swtich to save the registers to memory for the old process and
resotre them form meory for the new.

Even so evenif you did, I am not sure hwo this is compiler related.
Could you expand a little?

Any one have any idea how long it takes to do  context swicth in an x86
machine, eg a pIIIa nd how long it takes to fetch adn resutl a bit of
data to and form memory to a register or if it is possible to actually
perfrom any useful operationon data in memroy as aopposed to in a
register?
