Hi Everyone, I'm sorry that this is off topic but I can't think of a group of
people that are more likely to know how to sort this out.
I've been getting an unsolicited  URL reminder from a Brazillian/Argentinian sex
site for the past few months. I've sort of managed to track down one of the
machines that is hosting the sites (a Debian box), but can't find the origin of
the mails, since they are spoofed both in the sender address and the recipient
address (both change each mail and are never never my address unless you look in
the full headers). The majority of the sites are redirected through an Argentian
subdomain redirection service (who I have emailed about this) but the last one
as I said is a Debian box that is directly accesible on the net (telnet and ftp
ports are open). I have tried emailing root at this machine (gelo.inova.com.br -
inova are a Braziallian ISP, so mailing them I don't think will do any good
though I have tried) to get the message across that I don't want amy (more)
mails from them, but my mailer gives me a return with a not an allowable
rcpthost error.
First, what does this mean (just out of curiosity)? and second how can I do
something about this (I know I could just filter the mail, but it seems that
these people are doing everything they can to avoid filtering)?
I have tried getting their attention by repeatedly telneting their machine with
a shell while loop and occasionally using my email address as the login so they
know where to look (yes, desperation).

thanks
Dan
