Subject: Apache + PHP4

Hi again folks, (* what about adaptive?))?



I have run into a some problems lately, trying to configure Apache.  They
are listed below, and if anyone could shed some light on them for me, it
would be much appreciated :)

The system is Conectiva 6.0, which (afaik) goes about things in a Red Hat
sort of manner.

1) httpd.conf has the UserDir module loaded and added, and the UserDir is
specified as www.  However, I could not initially view any of the files on
my $HOME/www.  Some people in #linuxhelp suggested that it is neccessary
in Red hat to chmod 0755 $HOME and $HOME/www for this to work.  It did,
but it seems like a workaround, as now any user can view the contents of
my entire home directory - is there a more elegant way to a chieve a
working userdir setup?

2) I have the php4 and mod_php4 packages installed on this machine.
httpd.conf has this line:
LoadModule php4_module        modules/libphp4.so

which was originally commented out.  However, in the AddModule section,
there is no commented line to add libphp4..c (using a .c in place of the
.so of the module file seems to be the done thing.).  There is an
#AddModule mod_php4.c line, but I have no mod_php4.so in the modules/
directory.  Putting an AddModule libphp4.c results in this error upon
starting httpd:

Starting httpd: Syntax error on line 328 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot add module via name 'libphp4.c': not in list of loaded modules

Whenever I try to access a PHP script (that was previous working in
Slackware), I receive a "this file is of type application/x-http-php... do
you want to view or save to disk" so it musn't be being parsed by the
server (which is pretty obvious, since the module isn't being added or
loaded or sometihng).

Does anyone know how to load or add the php module correctly?  Has anyone
done it on a Red Hat box?

Thankyou very much for your help.

Cheers,

Tim Riley
