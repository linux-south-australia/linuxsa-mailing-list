&gt; I have tried getting their attention by repeatedly telneting their machine with
&gt; a shell while loop and occasionally using my email address as the login so they
&gt; know where to look (yes, desperation).

This could be interpeted as an intrusion attempt - it's a really bad
idea, and won't achieve what you want. If they're really a spam haven,
they'll also love you for repeatedly supplying your e-mail address to
them - spammers love active e-mail addresses...

Filtering at your end is the best solution, if it is possible.
