this sounds like a pretty good way about it. So you would recommend Debian
as the base system? I was looking at Slackware, as everyone I've spoken to
seems to think that Slackware makes you learn the ins and outs of Linux.

The only thing about slackware that concerns me is that some software -
coreldraw for linux, wordperfect office for linux etc. seem to require
a debian or redhat package manager. 

 
&gt; Depends if you want to go the whole roll-your-own, or if you 
&gt; would be happy 
&gt; using hand-holding tools like apt and dpkg (or the inferior 
&gt; RedHat subquivalents
&gt; [1])... Personally, I would install a base debian system and 
&gt; go from there. 
&gt; When you go through the installation process, you'll come 
&gt; accross a point where 
&gt; it wants to install various tasks or packages. Select none, 
&gt; and you'll have a 
&gt; working Linux installation that will not really have anything 
&gt; usefull installed 
&gt; on it. From there, you can either go the roll-your-own route 
&gt; and download and 
&gt; compile from source whatever software you want (or just 
&gt; download and install 
&gt; the tarballs) or you can use the tools and do things like 
&gt; `apt-get install gcc` 
&gt; to download and install the C compiler... it's also possible 
&gt; to use apt to 
&gt; download and compile source in an automated kind of way -- 
&gt; I've never done it 
&gt; before, but I think it's just a few extra commands...
&gt; 
&gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [1] it's a joke... :)
