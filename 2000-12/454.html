&gt; &gt; Why not post all of the headers?  That way you give us more (maybe
&gt; &gt; sufficient) information to help you.

Some information on 200.188.32.212: they were reported to spamcop.net,
and also listed on orbs.org, in September. (source: orbs.org) Seems like
they're not overly interested in securing their open relay. The SOA for
the zone gbl.com.br lists <A HREF="mailto:sysadm@gbl.com.br">sysadm@gbl.com.br</A> as a contact e-mail address
for this domain. Doing a whois search for 200.188.32.212 shows that it
is part of the Brazilian Research Network, and lists the co-ordinator's
e-mail address as <A HREF="mailto:gomide@nic.br.">gomide@nic.br.</A> It may also be worth trying postmaster
and abuse addresses at the domain above. There's a few contact points
which you may want to try...

&gt;           2000 10:30:28 -0300 (BRV)

Having got this far, the rest may be forged. This IP address is also
part of the Brazilian Research Network, so sending the full headers to
one of the contacts above is probably your best bet.
