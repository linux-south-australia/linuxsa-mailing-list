David!

&gt; I agree.  And if we had 1,000 computers amongst us to put to the problem,
&gt; which I think we don't, then it would *still* take us 22 years on average.

Some of us are more than 22 years old...and likely to be still alive in
22 years time as well. I know I plan to be...what's wrong with waiting
22 years? Besides, I said "not too difficult", I didn't say
"impractical" :-(

&gt; Of course that's also assuming that we know it uses only lower case letters.
&gt; Add upper case and numbers and the time leaps to 13 *millenia*.   "doesn't
&gt; strike me as being too difficult..."

Maybe we should just ask God - he does know all...

&gt; Perhaps there might be some small value in attacking the algorithm.

Actually, the thought occured to me that we could just crack into
Microsoft's computers and hijack the actual algorithm. In that way,
Bazillians who know dick all about cryptography may be able to shed some
light as to how to crack the stupid thing..

I think it's _HIGHLY_ _I M M O R R A L_ to advise someone on a practical
means to crack documents anyway - how do we know the person who first
got it is legitimate anyway?
