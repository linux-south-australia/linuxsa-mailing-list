Robyn!

&gt; What's the difference between passive and non-passive ftp and which is the
&gt; better one to use?

You've correctly identified the two different types of ftp. Basically:

ACTIVE
------

1) You initiate a connection with another ftp server, sending commands
emanating from an unprivileged port to its port 21
2) If it authenticates you, the server calls you back from its port 20
to one of your unprivileged ports

Commands are sent via the original connection, and data is sent or
received on the second call back. The reason why most people now
consider this unsafe is that you have no way of determining whether the
callback is actually from the real ftp server you really want it. I
could listen to any requests emanating from your network to port 21 and
trojan my own ftp responses back.

Naturally, I could range from installing root kits, viriis and so
forth...

PASSIVE
-------

1) You initiate a connection with another ftp server from an
unprivileged port to its port 21
2) If you are allowed, you create a connection from an unprivileged port
to an unprivileged port on the ftp server over which data is transferred

This is considered more secure becauseyou have more certainty about who
is talking to you. It's more difficult to perform a cracker in the
middle attack with passive ftp. Naturally, no matter which ftp style you
choose to use you should make sure you're getting your ftp stuff from a
trusted source anyway.

Most modern web browsers and most security conscious ftp servers
implement passive ftp these days. I only ever use passive ftp. Many
people consider ftp inherently evil, anyway,
