 &gt; I don't think it's a question of uplink
 &gt; capacity as there is a fibre optic cable to the exchange.

There are fibre-optic cables going to virtually every exchange.  It's all 
to do with whether there is sufficient population density in an area to
support the quite considerable infrastructure investment needed to make 
it happen, and has very little to do with the actual bandwidth servicing
an exchange area (which is, for all intents and purposes, unlimited).

For what it's worth, this is one of the reasons you should be upset at
Telstra's privatization.  Before it started down that route ten years
ago, there was a strong sense from the Government that Telecom should
be delivering benefits to all Australians even where it wasn't necessarily
profitable to do so (which is where the USO's came from -- It should cost
the same amount to have a telephone connected anywhere in Australia, even
if Telstra needs to roll-out $100,000 worth of infrastructure to service
one household).  Cross-subsidization was the rule:  Immensely profitable 
capital cities would subsidize loss-making regional areas.

Now corporations law forces Telstra to do everything it can to maximize 
returns to shareholders -- If they take steps to deliver community benefits
in ways which aren't profitable, the shareholders can actually sue them, 
or, in some cases, the directors can be criminally prosecuted.  And rather
than USO's being simply assumed as a necessary way of running a nation-wide
telecommunications network, they're now continually called into question,
with the implication that they'll be dropped or watered-down if they can't
be justified.  Instead of subsidizing loss-making areas with profitable 
ones, Telstra is trying to keep the money from the profitable areas and
spend as little as possible in the country where they don't make any money.

They would not have this problem if they were not listed on the stock 
exchange.

So, a community like McLaren Vale will not end up with ADSL in the short-to-
medium term, because:

   - Telstra wouldn't find it short-term profitable to install it, and
     doing things which the shareholders perceive as unprofitable can land
     the Directors in jail;  and

   - Other carriers don't have the resources to install it, because they
     have the same unprofitable equipment outlays which Telstra would face to
     do the same thing, plus the additional Telstra-imposed transmission
     costs to get bandwidth from an exchange as far away as McLaren Vale to
     a more suitable Internet bandwidth delivery point -- Even if it would
     one-day become profitable because the new carrier was the only show in
     town, if you don't have the resources to install it in the first place
     then that's a moot point.

Of course, one could also argue that the old-days Telecom wouldn't have
been innovative enough to introduce ADSL in the first place, and
telecommunications wouldn't have been opened to competition without
commercializing Telstra, so I guess the knife cuts both ways.

 &gt; Admittedly there is strong community support to retain the
 &gt; district's rural character, but this is overdoing it...

Some councils have been overdoing that bit for ages.  I couldn't get
council approval for a satellite dish on the council building in a Southern
wine-growing area due to "heritage" reasons -- The fact that the building
in question is less than ten years old didn't matter, because the whole
town is heritage-listed.

... and there you get the *other* reason that non-Telstra carriers
won't/can't move somewhere like that:  Laying out a telecommunications
network involves digging up roads, erecting towers with unsightly antennae,
and all manner of other things which "disturb the character" of a town. 

If you're in a residential area covered by a council which is hostile to
those notions, it's no real surprise that the only carrier in town is the
one who is legally obligated to be there, and that you have to put up with
second-rate service because they wont bother doing anything beyond what
the Telecommunications Act forces them to do.  The councils who have 
willfully promoted public hysteria over microwave emissions from
telecommunications transmission towers, fought against cable installations,
mounted legal action against tower erections, and all the other obstructive
things they can do against carriers, have harmed the public benefits
their residents can get from telecommunications competition in many rather
subtle ways...
