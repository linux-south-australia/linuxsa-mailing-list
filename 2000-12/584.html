&gt;&gt;&gt;You're kidding, right?  Look, suppose you can test each possibility in 1
&gt;&gt;&gt;nanosecond, which you can't because modern computers can't access memory
&gt;&gt;&gt;that quickly, let alone execute the many instructions needed to setup and
&gt;&gt;&gt;test each possibility.  But anyway, let's pretend that you have a *really*
&gt;&gt;&gt;quick machine.  It will still take you an average of 20 million years to
&gt;&gt;&gt;crack that ten character password.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What a load of bullshit David. More like 36Hours
&gt;&gt;been there had to do that..did it
&gt;
&gt;You must be borrowing distributed.net to get those sorts of results on
&gt;password cracking.
&gt;
&gt;If the authentication system could keep up with you (and most authentication
&gt;systems will have a pausing behaviour on password failure) you've still got
&gt;26^6 possible passwords with just a weak 6-letter code. If I'm generous and
&gt;say your system can do 1000 such password checks per second, you're still
&gt;looking at 85 hours to check all possible combinations. There's a slim
&gt;chance someone might take a crack at it. An average Radius server would be
&gt;at peak performance answering 30 authentication requests per second.
&gt;
&gt;This is why you should always use a 7-character password for anything that's
&gt;important, the single extra character will extend the 85 hours to 90 days of
&gt;checking. By that time you've probably changed the password anyway, or
&gt;someone will have noticed what's going on, or the protected information is
&gt;no longer valuable. If someone's that desperate to get the password and has
&gt;no way of sniffing it off your network, they're more likely to use some
&gt;tempest-style gear and an unmarked van to capture your keystrokes, or come
&gt;in and bludgeon it out of you.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know what sort of encryption word uses, but humans have had
&gt;remarkable success over the years in breaking elaborate cyphers by looking
&gt;for common patterns rather than brute force. Humans also tend to use things
&gt;like pets names[1] for passwords, so a dictionary attack can be far more
&gt;effective.
&gt;
&gt;John Edwards
&gt;
&gt;[1] This is marginally more clever than the people who use their
&gt;bank-assigned pin number as a password.
