Michael!

&gt; Microsoft should go into making hardware, and not software. It is now
&gt; obvious that Micro$oft can come up with some damn good reliable hardware,
&gt; more reliable than their stupid OSes. I have an Intellimouse Explorer and a
&gt; Internet Keyboard Pro they both work better than windows.

I may be wrong but I don't believe that Microsoft invented the
Intellimouse.

&gt; BTW I have 256MB of RAM in my machine and RH7 reports it as 64 now I have
&gt; added that little line into LILO on my boot floppy but it hasnt changed it,
&gt; and I cannot find any hint of lilo on the HDD except the executable. RH7 has
&gt; moved heaps of the config files around or renamed them or something because
&gt; I can no longer find a lot of them in /etc/

If you added the line but then forgot to run lilo (which I always
do)....did you run lilo too?

&gt; Someone what graphical way can I stop daemons from running coz my system
&gt; takes F**KING ages to boot. Its an AMD Athlon 800, and I have a reasonably
&gt; fast HDD so it should fly but it doesnt.

RedHat 6.X series comes with ntsysv. Type that as root from the prompt
and you'll get a text-based graphics program. In theory. LinuxConf
should cope as well. Incidentally, if RedHat 7.0 is like any other
RedHat release the kernel they make will be, how shall I put it,
terminally slow. I have absolutely no idea what RedHat do to them...

You may want to investigate rebuilding it. Remember to use kgcc and not
RedHat GCC 2.96.

&gt; Also while I am at it I have a Netcomm Roadster II USB how do I get RH7 to
&gt; talk to it. Seeming RH7 now has a USB module??

It does. In /usr/src/linux/documentation (I think - it may just be doc),
do a search for USB using grep:

[<A HREF="mailto:mkratz@localhost">mkratz@localhost</A> documentation]% grep -r "USB"

&gt; And is there a program that will allow me to authenticate to an NDS tree and
&gt; login to a BorderManager server??

Probably. Try looking up something at freshmeat.net.
