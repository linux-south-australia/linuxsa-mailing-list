&gt; eg make sure you have a CD in the drive and do the following:
&gt; 
&gt; add a new share, say call it cdrom and add the following to the smb.conf file
&gt; in /etc/
&gt; 
&gt; [cdrom]
&gt;         comment = this is my cdrom on my linux server
&gt;         path = /mnt/cdrom
&gt;         guest ok = Yes
&gt; 
&gt; You will see a folder appear in the Windoze machine when you go through the
&gt; network called CDROM
&gt; 
&gt; This should work just fine for you to check it out, make any addition you like
&gt; after this to enhance the share.

Okay, done just what you said.  I have a smb share for the zip disk
mount point.  If I have a disk (there ARE files on it) in the zip drive,
and I use Network Neighbourhoor to go to \\skywalker\zip I see nothing
(the empty mount point dir).  If I put a file in that dir ("cp
/etc/fstab /mnt/zip") I see fstab in the dir.

Now, I delete the file I put there (duh) and mount the zip disk ("mount
/mnt/zip").  I then browse back to the same share and I see the files on
my zip disk on it.

The problem with this is:

Windows users would need telnet/ssh/other access to the box to mount
their disks before they can use them with the smb share.  They then need
to unmount them before they eject them.

I want a system where the disk can be inserted and mounted on insertion
(like Gnome does with CDROMs now) and unmounted when the eject button is
pressed (or after a timeout).  This way I can use them with Samba just
like if the disk was on a Windows box.  Is it possible to have this kind
of setup using Samba, or should I move the zip disk onto a Windows
machine?

Cheers,
Adam
