&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is much more expensive
&gt;&gt; than in Australia.  Local calls, data or voice (at least they got that
&gt;&gt; bit right) cost $0.10 per 90 seconds.  Until a couple of years ago,
&gt;&gt; German telecommunications looked like something out of the dark ages.
&gt;&gt; The symbol was a post horn with a flash around the handle.
&gt;
&gt; One thing that a lot of people miss is the fact that Germany has a
&gt; population of something like 4 times that of Australia in an area
&gt; the size of Victoria. They don't have to run cables so far in
&gt; Germany.

That's not as significant as the amount of money they're roping in.
That would work here, too.

&gt; My fathers family lives in a small town near Trier in the former
&gt; West Germany. The town only has a population of about 2000 and in
&gt; Germany is termed a Village or "Dorf" thats where the name
&gt; "Hahndorf" comes from. I think "Hahn" is a mayor or something like
&gt; that (too lazy to look it up).

Hahn is a rooster.  In the case of Hahndorf, it was the name of the
bloke who founded it.

&gt; Anyway despite the fact that this town is small, they have fully
&gt; fledged ISDN. My uncle has his entire house ISDNified. He runs it
&gt; all through his computer and can monitor or pickup any line in the
&gt; house.

Yes, but that's a private PABX (pretty normal stuff in Germany).  How
much did he pay for it?

&gt; He can use 2 B Channels to access the internet through T-Online the
&gt; equivalent of BigPond here, ie. the biggest telco DeutscheTelecom's
&gt; Internet arm.  He gets charged roughly 1DM per 30minutes I
&gt; think. Thats using 128K.

If that's the case, prices have dropped rapidly.  But I suspect you're
talking about the access prices.  Even then, that's cheap for Germany.
The latest prices I have seen for Internet access in Germany are round
DM 0.049 per minute.  You used to have to add to that the cost of the
local call (DM 0.08 per minute), but I'm not sure they haven't made an
exception now.

&gt; My sister also lives in Germany and also has ISDN in her house. So
&gt; do about 20 other of my relatives in and around the same area, so
&gt; either my family is well developed and technofreaks!!!! or Germany
&gt; is just adopting ISDN and in this case a lot faster and cheaper than
&gt; Australia because mainly, they have more population per square KM
&gt; than Australia and thus the Telco's don't have to run cables so damn
&gt; far between cities.

Look at the prices I quoted at the top of the message (right, that's
me without the attribution).  Do you disagree with them?
