Actually Alan, much as I do not like the idea of a DVD style of coding on my
HD (frankly I don't think it will work, some manufacturer will profit from
people like us who value no coding on our drives, after all it is only a
specification and not compulsory) As for not being able to share files and
stuff this without a key, this is nonsense.  It only works if the software you
want has a key that interacts with the drive, no key no interaction = free
software no problem.

Sure it is another dent in freedom to use what belongs to us, however, intel
learned their lesson well with the PIII ID and dropped it for the PIIII. It is
all about choice, choose not to buy a drive that is encoded in such a manner
and as soon as the profits start to drop they will quickly change their
minds.  OH and the great SATAN is on our side :-)  M$ absolutely do not want
this either LOL

So I suggest you climb out of your bomb shelter and stop hoarding food and
start enjoying life again ;-)  After all it is Xmas

Best wishes all for the New Year and drive carefully

&gt; If you can cope with 4-letter words, here's the pigdog

&gt; If you have a more mild-mannered style, you might prefer
&gt; these (one of which I pointed to a couple of days ago):

&gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; Oddly enough, the PigDog idea of what to do about it
&gt; is the same as what I thought myself:
&gt; But zillions of Gigabytes of disk drives while you
&gt; can still get ones that can read and write files
&gt; in the normal fashion.
&gt; In 6-12 months, you won't be able to get any more
&gt; normal disk drives.
&gt; You'll need special software and keys to be able to
&gt; read and write files or even move them around on the disk.
&gt;
&gt; I.e. linux and open source will die!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, and Merry Northern Winter Solstice to all!!
