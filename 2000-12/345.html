Hi,

&gt; &gt; Named after a Mongolian ruler, who coincidentally released Marco Polo on
&gt; &gt; the same date as Adelaide was established.
&gt; 
&gt; Also well known in a Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem around 1800:
&gt;    "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
&gt;     A stately pleasure-dome decree:
&gt;     Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
&gt;     Through caverns measureless to man
&gt;        Down to a sunless sea..."
&gt; 
&gt; More useless info:
&gt; Coleridge was recovering from dysentery at a farm.  He took some opium that
&gt; had been prescribed and sat down to read Purchas' Pilgrimage.  Next thing he
&gt; knew, he was zoned for about three hours, only to come back down to earth
&gt; with an entire poem composed in his head dealing with the subject he was
&gt; reading about.  He wrote it down immediately.  Later, when he returned to
&gt; his writings, he scarcely even remembered or recognized the work.
&gt; 
&gt; Who knows... maybe they named the restaurant thus because the food has a
&gt; similar effect...?

Maybe we should bring along Douglas Adams "Dirk Gentley's Holistic
Detective Agency" and read what "realy happened :)

cya
