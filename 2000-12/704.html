&gt; Hey y'all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm working on a project at the moment.  It's written, so far, purely in
&gt; PHP3.  It accesses a PostgreSQL database, an LDAP server and verious other
&gt; things.
&gt; 
&gt; I want a user authentication mechanism.
&gt; 
&gt; I could use HTTP authentication, with the $PHP_AUTH_USER variable[1].
&gt; However, I think I can see issues with this method.  I want most of the
&gt; site to be accessable without login.  Certain areas will require users to
&gt; be logged in, certain areas will be different depending on whether you're
&gt; logged in or not.  Users need to be able to log on and log off randomly.
&gt; I'm using a custom-written session management system, tailored to the needs
&gt; of the project, which uses cookies to store a session ID..
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, I don't think that basic HTTP authentication is going to be
&gt; suitable for my needs.
&gt; 
&gt; I could be totally wrong, of course - let me know if you think I'm wrong!

Not necessarily. You can set specific directories to require
authentication with most web servers.

&gt; So, instead of HTTP WWW-authenticate type authentication, I've so far
&gt; decided to implement my own.
&gt; 
&gt; What I would really like to do is use PAM to validate username/password
&gt; pairs.  Then I can use the pam_ldap module and not have to worry about
&gt; doing any extra programming.

You can use (as I have done in the past) PAM_LDAP, and Apache's
mod_auth_pam to authenticate the user. It's also not too hard (in perl
and C, anyway) to write an application that makes use of PAM by itself.

&gt; I've checked the PHP manuals - there don't seem to be any functions for
&gt; PAM.
&gt; 
&gt; This is either because nobody has written them - I doubt that's the reason
&gt; - or because it's not PHP's place to worry about authentication.

I haven't used PHP, but I thought you could do PAM-type stuff with
it....

Hope it helps,
Matt
