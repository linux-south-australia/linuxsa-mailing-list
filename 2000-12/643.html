&gt; I accept that.  But we are talking about the recommendations of a parliamentary
&gt; committee - not the lawful enactment.  When the recommendations are translated
&gt; into a Bill, I would expect your view (with which I concur) to be incorporated.
&gt; You are right to raise the issue at, or slightly before, that time.

Hi Brian,

Whilst agreeing that recommendations from senate committees are
not always accepted by the government and become legisation, I
don't share your sanguine view.

Getting a Bill substantially modified before it reaches the floor
of the House of Reps is a lot simpler than getting it modified after
it is tabled.

This requires engaging the responsible ministers, departments and
staff of the key pollies.  The Senate committee report gives us
an avenue of access into those staff.  It also helps us to educate
them -- you saw how painful it was during the Broadcasting Services
Amendment to educate politicans and their staff when the hammer was
down on them to consider the Bill.

Given our failure there, we need to start engagement well before
people start drafting legisation.  And the senate committee report
is disturbing as it implies that the two major parties are not yet
even aware that Linux users have an interest in intellectual
property.

One of the most effective ways of engaging the committee and its
advisors is to point out the consequences of their recommendations
becoming law.

&gt; You have little evidence to that effect.  I have evidence that you are
&gt; screaming before you are struck.

Please Brian, we need help -- not people that wish to score debating
points.  If you don't want to help, then don't hassle those that are.

If you want to help, we will be brainstorming our response one night
in January -- I'll send details to the list closer to the time.  Our
response will then be considered by the committee members and their
advisors in February.  Those advisors include the intellectual property
experts at Attorney General's, this makes engaging with the committee
all the more important for avoiding stupid legislation in the future.

Glen
