Congratulations Caroline

Another woman on the mailing list. I don't know much Mandrake but RedHat has 
a command sndconfig and another one called modemtool, both must be run as 
root. These configure the relevant files for you. 

Can you play audio cd's in Windows?

Are you using kde or gnome for your window manager? I can help with kde.

Stay in touch and your prob's will get sorted out.

Robyn

&gt; Can some one please help -   I am a Linux newbie and my installation of
&gt; Mandrake 7.2 went like a dream - it says my sound card, an Ensoniq Audio
&gt; PCI (1370) is configured correctly, and when I boot into and log off from
&gt; KDE I have sound.  I also have sound when I test the configuration, but the
&gt; rest of the time I have silence, and cannot play audio cds, although I can
&gt; access cd-roms from both my cd-rom drive and my burner (my burner is not
&gt; connected to the sound card).  Obviously I have to do something else but
&gt; have no idea where to go from here.
&gt;
&gt; I have read the HowTos and something I have read suggests it may have
&gt; something to do with my internal ISA modem, a Diamond Voice 56i, which
&gt; hasn't been recognized ( I am using Windows to access this site!) but
&gt; should be if I knew what to do.  According to the info with my card I can
&gt; set it manually with jumpers.  My Award Bios is currently set up to
&gt; recognize Plug and Play, should I change that?
&gt;
&gt; My audio card uses IRQ 10 in Windows and IRQ 5 in Dos and I have no
&gt; conflicts under Windows and no IRQ sharing.  My modem is on Com Port 4.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you
