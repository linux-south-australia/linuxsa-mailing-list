geez... firewood mostly. the saturday BBQ usually.
 
&gt; Oh, you do actually understand the point and it seems that you might be
&gt; causing a raucous for nothing. You said it yourself...."pvc tubing that
&gt; other service [sic] could be threaded through"...not necessarily PVC
&gt; though.

I spend a bit of time watching the telstra (or subcontractor) guys trying
to do a bit of this. But then the conduit ends up being too small and they
dig it up and put a bigger bit in. Then they cover it in and another crew
come out to dig it up again to finish the connections. etc. And the guys
here are a bit nervous. I don't think they'd like having 11kv power lined
running through the same conduit... So I guess we wouldn't see that here
:-)
 
&gt; &gt; Our crummy trenches are not really reusable. If the phone line goes they
&gt; &gt; dig another trench. If they lay in another service then it takes even
&gt; &gt; longer as they work around the existing services.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, get new trenches. You might get a new Government too!

I have some ideas about that. Looking for a volunteer. Needs licence for
articulated vehicle. Email privately. Encrytpted. Shhh...

&gt; Well, actually it will be easier. You are less likely to walk into the
&gt; electricity pole on your way to the shop!

I have a feeling the poles will be around here long after I'm gone. And
now that telstra have scrapped the fibre optic that was going to pass 30
meters from our door they can all go to hell... or a windows beta test
program...
