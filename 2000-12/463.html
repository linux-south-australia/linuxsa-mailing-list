As has been said by others, Mandrake 7.1,2  and Redhat 7.0 have an automounting
function (named differently) They operate the in a similar fashion to a windoze
automount function.  If you dont have this on your system, follow the links from
Dan's previous mail and add this functionality.

I use Mandrake 7.1 in the fashion you are after and have no troubles from anyone
accessing  the cdrom without mounting it for every use, so it can be done quite
easily.

my FSTAB for zip =

/mnt/zip /mnt/zip supermount fs=vfat,dev/zip 0 0

Put a disk in and its readable, change it and it remounts the new one, ditto for
floppy, cdrom etc


Good luck

&gt; &gt; eg make sure you have a CD in the drive and do the following:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; add a new share, say call it cdrom and add the following to the smb.conf file
&gt; &gt; in /etc/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [cdrom]
&gt; &gt;         comment = this is my cdrom on my linux server
&gt; &gt;         path = /mnt/cdrom
&gt; &gt;         guest ok = Yes
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You will see a folder appear in the Windoze machine when you go through the
&gt; &gt; network called CDROM
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This should work just fine for you to check it out, make any addition you like
&gt; &gt; after this to enhance the share.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, done just what you said.  I have a smb share for the zip disk
&gt; mount point.  If I have a disk (there ARE files on it) in the zip drive,
&gt; and I use Network Neighbourhoor to go to \\skywalker\zip I see nothing
&gt; (the empty mount point dir).  If I put a file in that dir ("cp
&gt; /etc/fstab /mnt/zip") I see fstab in the dir.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I delete the file I put there (duh) and mount the zip disk ("mount
&gt; /mnt/zip").  I then browse back to the same share and I see the files on
&gt; my zip disk on it.
&gt;
&gt; The problem with this is:
&gt;
&gt; Windows users would need telnet/ssh/other access to the box to mount
&gt; their disks before they can use them with the smb share.  They then need
&gt; to unmount them before they eject them.
&gt;
&gt; I want a system where the disk can be inserted and mounted on insertion
&gt; (like Gnome does with CDROMs now) and unmounted when the eject button is
&gt; pressed (or after a timeout).  This way I can use them with Samba just
&gt; like if the disk was on a Windows box.  Is it possible to have this kind
&gt; of setup using Samba, or should I move the zip disk onto a Windows
&gt; machine?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
