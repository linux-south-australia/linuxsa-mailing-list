Me bad! You guys are right. Should have re-familiarized myself before
responding.

The 286 introduced Protected-mode while the 386 improvement was
Enhanced-mode.

(edited to fit)
Starting with the 80286 chip in the IBM AT, a new processor mode was
introduced called protected mode. This is a much more powerful mode of
operation than real mode, and is used in all modern multitasking operating
systems. The advantages of protected mode (compared to real mode) are:
Ability to multitask, meaning having the operating system manage the
execution of multiple programs simultaneously.

Windows 386 enhanced mode allows multitasking of MS-DOS-based applications
and enables you to have more control over those applications than is
provided in standard mode. For example, in 386 enhanced mode you can run an
MS-DOS-based application in a window, whereas in standard mode, MS-DOS-based
applications can run only in a full screen.

The multitasking I spoke of was "pre-emptive" meaning it's just real fast
task switching.

While working at M$ I installed a copy of Windows 2.0 from the boneyard
server. It looked and acted just like "DOS shell" that came in older
versions of DOS (5.0 I believe).

&gt; Not. The 286 couldn't do multitasking. The 386 introduced protected-mode
&gt; which ushered in the multitasking OS like Windows and Linux. Windows 2.0
on
&gt; the 286 was really the old DOS Shell program, a simple ASCII drawn file
&gt; manager that was dumped from memory when another program was started.
Yuck!
