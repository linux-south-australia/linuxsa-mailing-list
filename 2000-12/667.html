Money.

&gt; And correct me if I'm wrong, but maybe this is just
&gt; "the Internet is the disk drive" - to paraphrase
&gt; SUN's motto.

Apparently, it's going to be your whole "desktop" over HTTP.

&gt; It seems to me that what the opposition is up to is
&gt; getting some sort of NFS and NIS going on an Internet
&gt; scale.

NFS v3 is apparently quite nice these days. I would personally use LDAP
over NIS, though.

&gt; If that's what it is, then I think that maybe I need
&gt; something similar for my linux environments.
&gt; Suppose I have a home computer system, an office
&gt; computer network, and a laptop.
&gt; At present, if I want to modify a document or software
&gt; on my laptop, I need to download it from home, modify it,
&gt; and remember to copy it back before I get home and
&gt; modify the home copy.
&gt; 
&gt; So there's some sort of distributed file system problem here,
&gt; with possibly very low bandwidths available for
&gt; doing the sync.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:
&gt; Is there anything that does this sort of thing for linux?
&gt; 
&gt; Could such a thing be cobbled together from mirroring software,
&gt; and NFS etc. etc.?

Samba allows you to compile in support for SSL. This is not the best
distributed file system in the world (particuluarly given you mentioned
you want low-bandwidth), but would be quite acceptable over SSL. Coda is
also a very scalable distributed file system. I haven't looked into it
very much, but it is apparently quite flexible and stable.

At Xavier College, we use a home-grown HTTP type thing that looks
similar to the Windows 'My Computer' thing.

&gt; I start to work on a document on my laptop in a hotel.
&gt; The computer says "hold on - first check if the
&gt; other nodes have changed anything".
&gt; I connect to the net.
&gt; The "Internet disk drive" layer does a sync of that file.
&gt; I modify that file, and say "commit that".
&gt; The "Internet disk drive" layer does another sync.

Most Unix-based file systems will do some kind of locking.

You could use something like CVS or rsync to give the impression of a
"virtual" (well, there's my quota of buzzwords) filesystem.

hope it helps,
Matt
