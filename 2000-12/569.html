&gt; a 10 letter password would be 256^10
&gt; iterations of testing, which in computer terms doesn't strike me as
&gt; being too difficult...

You're kidding, right?  Look, suppose you can test each possibility in 1
nanosecond, which you can't because modern computers can't access memory
that quickly, let alone execute the many instructions needed to setup and
test each possibility.  But anyway, let's pretend that you have a *really*
quick machine.  It will still take you an average of 20 million years to
crack that ten character password.

Fortunately it doesn't need to be that hard.  Most people, if not forced
otherwise, choose passwords comprising only lower case letters, so the 10
character password is only 26^10.  If you have a good algorithm perhaps you
can try 1,000 passwords per second (more realistic than the 1,000,000,000 I
was going to allow when you had a 256 character alphabet) in which case it
will take an average of only 22,000 years.  That's much more likely.
