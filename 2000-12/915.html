&gt; &gt; Actually Alan, much as I do not like the idea of a DVD style of coding on my
&gt; &gt; HD (frankly I don't think it will work, some manufacturer will profit from
&gt; &gt; people like us who value no coding on our drives, after all it is only a
&gt; &gt; specification and not compulsory)
&gt;
&gt; It will be compsulory if you wish to watch Hollywood content.

If it's not on your drive how can it be compulsory?

&gt;
&gt; Linux is threatened in much the same way as by CSS -- an operating
&gt; platform that can't display Hollywood content cannot become a
&gt; mainstream operating platform.

Hmm i'm not sure I follow your logic, do you mean that the operating system will
be no good if it does not have the ATA spec on the hard drive?

&gt;
&gt; What's more likely to kill this is high-end business computing.
&gt; They *want* to make many, many copies of their data, they call
&gt; them back-ups.  So we might end up with ATA-spec drives with
&gt; coding and SCSI-spec drives without.  But Hollywood content
&gt; won't allow itself to be copied to SCSI-spec drives.  In this
&gt; scenario, you pay extra to run Linux and still can't watch
&gt; movies.
&gt;

That could be the case, we shall know most likely by the end of 2001

&gt;
&gt; Alan's claim that "nobody cares" is tosh: Cox and Stallman have
&gt; made their views plain, so at least two influential people care.

Indeed, if we keep it on the boil it will be harder for them to justify their
actions

&gt;
&gt; What we need are people that are influential in Hollywood's world
&gt; to get the Linux virus.  This is inevitable, there's nothing so
&gt; much like a Hollywood script as the development of Linux, but the
&gt; question is one of timing.

Indeed, but the circles they move in are more likely shark like in that they feed
of each other's kills :-)

Much as I dislike it, we need the uneducated, self grandising and wholly self
interested politicians on our side.  I don't think we can count on  the USA now
that Bush is in, it will have to be other countries who try to stop this. All we
need is to find a way to show how much it will negatively affect them and we have
a chance.

Does this kind of bullshit ever stop or is this the everlasting war we must
face...

Steve
