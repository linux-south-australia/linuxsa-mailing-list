Tim et al!

&gt; Arround here it tends to be the poles that 'wear out' rather than the
&gt; wire.

Why? Because you sit and rotate on them...&lt;evil grin&gt;

&gt; Logic escapes me (geez, not again!). You'll have to tell us what sort of
&gt; trenches they have down there

Now, if the army has dug them they generally contain a good number of
well trained, in shape your men which some women (and some men) would
find rather enticing. Unfortunately, unless they've changed policy,
they're unlikely to contain women unless they are medical officers. What
policy? That women can't fight on the frontline - stupid policy if you
ask me. Why should the men only be allowed to shoot othes?

&gt; they're certainly different to the ones up
&gt; here. Are they open trenches that allow you to lay other service and then
&gt; cover again or some sort of open pvc tubing that other service could be
&gt; threaded through - or are we assuming that enough fibre will be put down
&gt; initially to cope with any future use (ha!) Anyway, I don't understand the
&gt; rent thing... Rent a trench?

Oh, you do actually understand the point and it seems that you might be
causing a raucous for nothing. You said it yourself...."pvc tubing that
other service [sic] could be threaded through"...not necessarily PVC
though.

&gt; Our crummy trenches are not really reusable. If the phone line goes they
&gt; dig another trench. If they lay in another service then it takes even
&gt; longer as they work around the existing services.

Well, get new trenches. You might get a new Government too!

&gt; Maybe you can point these guys in the right direction!!!

East. Always East towards the mountains...

&gt; Seriously, while it is nice to get the services underground, I don't see
&gt; how burying the fibre cable will make it easier to later bury electric
&gt; cable (for example). My poor logic can only see it making things harder.

Well, actually it will be easier. You are less likely to walk into the
electricity pole on your way to the shop!

&gt; Now if ALL the services are being put in at THE SAME TIME, it's another
&gt; matter.

&lt;ponders&gt;
How does one put banking (which is a service) into the trench
&lt;/ponders&gt;

I wonder whether David is being serious or not, funny or otherwise....
