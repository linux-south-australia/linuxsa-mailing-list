&gt; a while back, it was making crazy beeping noises, kinda like a late
&gt; 80's videogame. was that overheating, think so... i thought
&gt; powersupply was stuffed, so it got put it away for a month or so. i
&gt; put in a new powersupply yesterday, (no i did not have a bad
&gt; christmas...) but nothing. the powersupply is good, and the one i
&gt; took out was also good, i tried it in another system. thought it
&gt; might be the switch, tried another, no good. tried removing the
&gt; switch, and using a jumper, no good.
&gt;
&gt;  ok here is the thing, press the switch, and the cpu fan moves, but
&gt;  then stops.  have i killed my motherboard?? the ram that was in it
&gt;  is fine and works, as do all other things. video, lan sound etc.
&gt;  all things point to dead motherboard.... doh!!

If you ask me, it's more likely to be a dead or dirty fan.  That would
cause overheating, which could cause the other thing you alluded to.

Try removing the CPU and fan and see if the fan is clogged with dust.
If so, try cleaning the dust off; this might be enough to get it
moving again.  Otherwise you at least need a new fan.  You may *also*
need a new MB or CPU, but there's nothing in what you report which
would suggest it.
