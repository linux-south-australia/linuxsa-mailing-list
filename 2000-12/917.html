Please excuse this message, which is intended for Richard Russell.

Richard,

Your mail system appears to be incorrectly configured.  The transcript below
shows mail-intake-1.mail.com rejecting a message from <A HREF="mailto:davidn@rebel.net.au">davidn@rebel.net.au</A> on
the basis that there is no such user.  Obviously there is such a user, and
in any case mail-intake-1.mail.com has no way to tell if this is the case.

Regards,

David

Ah.  Festinisers.   The mailing list I setup early in the installfest
planning.  I guess we can get rid of that! :-)  Thanks.

&gt; Subject: Some exciting news regarding rebel
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is an important announcement concerning your account on rebel.net.au.
&gt; Topics covered: We are moving offices; making rebel faster; and
&gt; implementing
&gt; a "fair share" policy on downloads.
&gt;
&gt; We are moving offices to Level 7, North Terrace House, 19 North Terrace,
&gt; Hackney in mid-January.  Our support and modem telephone numbers will both
&gt; change at that time.  We do not yet know what those new numbers
&gt; will be but
&gt; we will send you further email as soon as we know them.  Our old numbers
&gt; will continue to work for six weeks after we move in.
&gt;
&gt; As part of the move we will get a much faster connection to the internet,
&gt; and you will find information downloads very much more quickly.
&gt; In case you
&gt; are interested in the technical details: We are commissioning a 2Mbps LMDS
&gt; link (that's like a microwave radio link) between our new offices and the
&gt; SANTOS building in the city.  This link will be operated by AAPT.  From
&gt; SANTOS the link will go through AAPT's high speed ATM network, to their
&gt; offices in Pirie Street.  It will terminate at our new Cisco
&gt; router, located
&gt; in the SAIX rack in AAPT's third-party equipment room.
&gt;
&gt; We are also purchasing an Ascend MAX digital access server, which will
&gt; support 56k modems.  We anticipate it will be online by April next year.
&gt; You should then find your modem connect-speed is 50% faster to as much as
&gt; twice as fast!
&gt;
&gt; As well as dramatically increasing the speed of our service, we will be
&gt; implementing a "fair share" policy for data.  We are examining the
&gt; alternatives and will announce our plans early next year.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, we are also considering introducing new services aimed at better
&gt; meeting your needs.  We are particulalry interested in your ideas
&gt; on how we
&gt; can better serve you.
&gt;
&gt; If you wish to discuss any of this news with us, please send email to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:admin@rebel.net.au.">admin@rebel.net.au.</A>
&gt;
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt;
&gt; Rebel Administration Team
