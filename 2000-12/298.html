I have heard that it is possible to remotely tell your computer to
connect to your isp in a manner something like the following:

1. You ring your home telephone number, waiting for two rings and then
putting the phone down.

2. Your computer is listening for rings, and if it counts precisely
two of them, it takes this as a signal that it should connect to the
isp.

3. Your computer dials up the isp and makes a ppp connection.


This would be very handy if you are away from home and you want to
have access to your machine over the internet.  You just "ring up your
computer" and tell it to start ppp.  It doesn't even have to answer
the phone to get the message so it doesn't cost a phone call!

The question is, how to do it?

I had heard that this could be done using mgetty.  But I have been
reading a bit of mgetty documentation and can't see any mention of
this application.  Has anyone heard of this or whether mgetty can be
used for this?

Thanks,

Mark.
