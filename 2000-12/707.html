Martin!

&gt; I need to install a tape drive onto a Red Hat Version 7 machine? What is a
&gt; good tape drive and how do I go about installing one?

Most tape drives are reasonable these days, although I would probably
avoid Seagate ST20000-RCVT Travan style drives myself [1]. The ones I've
seen are SCSI and most modern drives should slot into a SCSI card
without causing too many problems. That is to say, if you have a driver
for the SCSI card it's almost certain you can use a SCSI tape drive.

Installing is really quite simple. Get the SCSI card working (on a
default RedHat 7.0 kernel you may be lucky enough for it to just work -
other than that you'll have to fiddle with compiling the kernel on
RedHat 7.0 which is a saga in itself). Insert drive, make sure its
terminated and powered and it should be detected automatically.

I may have two particularly bad samples but they seem painfully slow and
the other person I work with thinks they're slower than they should be
too - it's running on a RH 6.2, Athlon 800 (I think - it may be 900)
with 64Mb of RAM and everything else seems normal...not to mention we
need to upgrade because the tapes aren't large enough.
