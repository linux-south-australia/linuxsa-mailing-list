&gt;  &gt; I don't mind this, however:
&gt;  &gt; "The Committee recommends that a provision be introduced into the
&gt;  &gt; Copyright Act 1968, similar to section 100 of the Copyright, Designs and
&gt;  &gt; Patents Act 1988 (UK), which authorises a copyright owner or their agent
&gt;  &gt; to seize a copy of their work (or other subject matter) that is offered for
&gt;  &gt; sale or hire from a place other than a regular or permanent place of
&gt;  &gt; business."
&gt;  &gt; ie if you are offering to sell copies of M$Office from your home -
&gt;  &gt; watch out!
&gt; 
&gt; I have a huge problem with this.
&gt; 
&gt; If selling MS Office would have the potential to be a life and death
&gt; situation, then I'd agree with you.  But it isn't;  Authorizing a
&gt; company to enter your home without your consent on the suspicion that
&gt; you're infringing their copyright is a remedy which is vastly out of
&gt; proportion to the size of the threat.
&gt; 
&gt; I can see what they want to do here:  they want to allow private search
&gt; and siezure in places shared marketplaces, where people might be selling
&gt; illegal software (trash and treasures, temporary stalls in markets,
&gt; country fairs, etc).
&gt; 
&gt; What they've actually written, though, is that they desire to permit
&gt; copyright owners to enter any building at all which isn't a permanent
&gt; business.  Including your house.
&gt; 
&gt; No way.  If someone like Microsoft suspects that a private citizen is
&gt; selling copies of Windows from their home, a basic sense of reality
&gt; would suggest that permitting them to raid the home is disproportionate
&gt; when other remedies (e.g.: obtaining a restraining order) would achieve
&gt; the same end result.
&gt; 
&gt; Law is a balancing act, where remedies are supposed to be coupled to the
&gt; size of the threat:  You don't execute someone for defaulting on a parking
&gt; ticket;  You don't give someone a fine for murder.  The sanctity of the
&gt; home is a common law right which has been legally recognized for centuries;
&gt; A lot of thought should be given to any attempt to abridge that right,
&gt; especially when said abridgement is being lobbied by multi-billion dollar
&gt; profit-centered companies who couldn't give a rat's arse about your legal
&gt; rights or your privacy.
