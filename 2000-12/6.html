&gt; Yes it does!  I just finished saying that hanging new wires on poles will
&gt; turn into an excuse to prolong the life of the poles.  Look at it this way:
&gt; If you hang them on a pole, then in 10 years time people will claim that it
&gt; makes litle senst to dig a trench underneath fibre cable just to replace
&gt; worn-out power lines when the new power lines could be hung with the fibre,
&gt; especially if someone is planning to move the fibre underground later.

Arround here it tends to be the poles that 'wear out' rather than the
wire.
 
&gt; a prime position to claim reasonable rent from every other utility that
&gt; needs to lay cable.  Etsa (or whatever they call themselves now), and every
&gt; other telco, will be more-or-less forced to use those trenches (because it
&gt; will be cheaper to pay rent than lay a second trench.)  And with a perfectly
&gt; useable trench in the ground the government may well mandate, "thou shalt
&gt; move thy cables underground NOW."  You say "too costly"; I say "licence to
&gt; print money."

Logic escapes me (geez, not again!). You'll have to tell us what sort of
trenches they have down there, they're certainly different to the ones up
here. Are they open trenches that allow you to lay other service and then
cover again or some sort of open pvc tubing that other service could be
threaded through - or are we assuming that enough fibre will be put down
initially to cope with any future use (ha!) Anyway, I don't understand the
rent thing... Rent a trench? 

Our crummy trenches are not really reusable. If the phone line goes they
dig another trench. If they lay in another service then it takes even
longer as they work around the existing services. 

Maybe you can point these guys in the right direction!!!

Seriously, while it is nice to get the services underground, I don't see
how burying the fibre cable will make it easier to later bury electric
cable (for example). My poor logic can only see it making things harder. 

Now if ALL the services are being put in at THE SAME TIME, it's another
matter.
