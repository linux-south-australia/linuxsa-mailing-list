&gt; Melbourne has a rare treasure, the only working first-generation computer
&gt; in the world

When I visited Melbourne Uni a few years ago, and viewed that machine, it
was not working.  Aside from the high probability that the wires no longer
worked (insulation failed), the vacuum tubes were also kaput, and out of
production. They had no restoration project in place at that time, because
it was going to cost a lot of money, but also because they weren't sure that
an old machine with new wires, tubes and whatever would be as interesting as
an old machine with all original parts.  So perhaps the machine isn't the
only working computer of it's era, but is the only complete machine of the
era.

I understand that they turned on a piece of ENIAC a few years ago, to mark
it's -- what would that be? 50th anniversary?
