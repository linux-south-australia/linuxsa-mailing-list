&gt; What's not clear is whether free BGP software is good enough.

We would only know if a PC would be suitable if we knew the target
application. A small company with a few PC's, some servers and a moderate
bandwidth, with enough techies around to bring it up and tweak it if it
falls over and the occasional blown power supply or outage being
acceptable? I would guess this. Or, a service with large ammounts of
critical data using high bandwidth and large tables, with customers who
would scoop your heart out with a spoon at any hint in drop of connection.

I guess it depends on how established it is under Linux and what level of
flakeyness it is at. If a 'gated' or other set of software under Linux
supports it well, then it could be easily packaged into one of the LRP's,
or used as a standard part of another distribution.
