&gt; &gt;The "spadmin" program is looking for a default Queue for the printer
&gt; &gt;what could the possible options be?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've tried to find the answer to this in the man pages and the CUPS
&gt; &gt;pages and I haven't come up with it yet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Once I've sorted out this problem I would like to go on and install the
&gt; &gt;mandrake 7.2 & Staroffice 5.2 combination on other peoples computers,as
&gt; &gt;I have been telling lots of people about how good this system is
&gt; &gt;(previous experience with Red Hat) Especially with mandrake's graphical
&gt; &gt;configuration, but this problem is slowing me down.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;any help would be appreciated
&gt; &gt;

&gt; 
&gt; As one of those crazy things I was doing, I was thinking about this
&gt; while trying to sleep in the heat!  I believe that Staroffice will do a
&gt; flat postscript dump to a printer command (lpr -Plaser) in my case.  Why
&gt; don't you configure it to do that with your CUPS system, and use
&gt; whatever command you'd use to print a PS file using CUPS?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam

&gt; --
thanks for givig up your sleep time to ponder my problems, I've tried
all sorts of configurations for the spadmin program as well as hand
editing Xpdefaults and i've come to the conclusion that it must be a
software incompatability problem between CUPS and star office 5.2,
because i even loaded up RH6.2 onto a spare HDD and installed so 5.2 and
had no problems printing. CUPS say on their web site that if you are
having trouble see your Distributor, SUN want $19.95 US and Mandrake say
it is all possible so that leaves me with KWord and a group of "Win"
freaks laughing (even though they paid ove a grand for the software that
they are using. As I'm not a programmer I will have to wait for somone
else to solve it.

thanks again to all that have given helpful tips

regards Darrin Ritter
