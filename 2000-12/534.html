Can someone please offer some sugeations re getting automounting working !

After I installed Mandrake7.2 everything worked fine - just click on the 
cd-rom Icon on my screen and up would come the contents of the cd-rom.

Last night I :
upgraded to kde 2.0.1 - seemed to go very well
Played around with compiling a kernel - seemed to go very badly ! (but not to 
worry I left the working kernel as my default :-)
Had a look in drake config at the "Startup Services" and disabled some of the 
ones I was really sure I didn't need. Like remote access etc
The had a look at my installed RPM'S & Uninstalled some that I was sure I 
didn't need.

Guess what - Automount no longer works (sigh from the audience !)
I can manually mount the cd & floppy and they work fine.

So Tonight I have:
Gone in & installed a package am-apps (said it had an upgraded version of 
automount in it!)
Went into startup services and enabled AMD
Restarted the machine and in the startup list it said starting automounter 
and a tick.
When I shut down it says stopping automounter.
But I still cant access my cd or floppy without manually mounting them first.

I am obviously missing something somewhere, but ?

----

Another quick question -

When I Installed I chose to automatically log onto a user
I have since deleted that user
Can someone point me in the right direction so I can set up my current user 
for autologin.

TIA

Matt
