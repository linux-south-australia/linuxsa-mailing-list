With all due respect, that's not how the system of Government in this
country works.

Parliamentary committees make recommendations for legislation.  Drafters
write the legislation, incorporating those recommendations.  The Bill
is then tabled, and once that has happened there's basically no chance to
have the more controversial aspects of it changed, because by that time
the Government has committed itself to living-through any political heat 
they'll receive on the issue.  Finally, the bill is voted on by the
parliament, which rubber-stamps it with the Government's seal of approval.

There are only two real opportunites to fight bad legislation:  One is
during the committee phase, which is why it's important to object to the
more odious aspects of the Copyright Act now.  The other is in the Senate,
where the Democrats currently hold the balance of power, and can therefore
influence the direction of legislation before the final vote is taken.

The Government is not going to use its majority on the Committee to include
controversial provisions in its recommendations, then use its own legislation
drafters to write those controversial provisions into legislation, just so
they can use their parliamentary majority to vote against bits of their own
bill once they reach the light of day.  If you don't want something to turn
up in legislation, you need to work against it before the legislation is
written.  And, for the new Copyright Act, that's now.
