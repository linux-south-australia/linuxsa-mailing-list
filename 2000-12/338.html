Ahhh yes... so thats how its done.

In IE5 and above if you add a site to your faves list, it downloads a small
icon from that site and uses it for that new link on the faves bar (along
with the page title name).
I imagine this is what it is.

Theres prolly no way to stop it... maybe the best solution will be creating
an icon for your site?
Sorry... i dont know what size pic would be required.

&gt; A small but annoying problem for my web server which I would
&gt; like to fix. I'm getting a lot of requests for a file
&gt; "favicon.ico" that has never existed on my system. The
&gt; server logs the attempt as follows (anonymised):
&gt;
&gt; 111.222.333.444 - - [09/Dec/2000:11:01:46 +1030] "GET
&gt; /favicon.ico HTTP/1.0" 404 1447 "-" "Mozilla/4.0
&gt; (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)"
&gt;
&gt; And of course there's a corresponding entry in the error
&gt; log; which is rapidly filling up with this garbage. The
&gt; common factors with all of these requests are:
&gt;
&gt; 1) They are using Internet Explorer 5.0 or later (in this
&gt; example IE 5.5 on Win2000).
&gt;
&gt; 2) They have come directly to the site (or specific page)
&gt; from somewhere else. This problem doesn't happen during
&gt; subsequent internal site navigation by these clients.
&gt;
&gt; I guess this is yet another Microsoft-specific behaviour;
&gt; and remedies which come to mind include:
&gt;
&gt;  - Putting the requested 1447-byte favicon.ico file in every
&gt; directory. I assume this file comes standard with NT Server?
&gt;
&gt;  - Refusing access to IE 5.x clients  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;  - Running a cron job to prune the server logs
&gt;
&gt;  - Redirecting the favicon.ico request to a special page;
&gt; contents yet to be determined.
&gt;
&gt; Suggestions anyone?
&gt;
&gt; - - - - -
&gt;
&gt; And following up an earlier thread: I have been told by
&gt; BigPond, Optus, Connect, Ozemail, SENet, ihug and several
&gt; others that only two broadband technologies are available in
&gt; my area: ISDN and satellite.
&gt;
&gt; Both BigPond & Optus _specifically_ told me there will be no
&gt; ADSL or cable from the McLaren Vale exchange until at least
&gt; 2003 - if ever. I don't think it's a question of uplink
&gt; capacity as there is a fibre optic cable to the exchange.
&gt;
&gt; Admittedly there is strong community support to retain the
&gt; district's rural character, but this is overdoing it...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt; Fraser Farrell
