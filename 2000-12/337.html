<H1>favicon.ico , etc</H1>

A small but annoying problem for my web server which I would
like to fix. I'm getting a lot of requests for a file
"favicon.ico" that has never existed on my system. The
server logs the attempt as follows (anonymised):

111.222.333.444 - - [09/Dec/2000:11:01:46 +1030] "GET
/favicon.ico HTTP/1.0" 404 1447 "-" "Mozilla/4.0
(compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)"

And of course there's a corresponding entry in the error
log; which is rapidly filling up with this garbage. The
common factors with all of these requests are:

1) They are using Internet Explorer 5.0 or later (in this
example IE 5.5 on Win2000).

2) They have come directly to the site (or specific page)
from somewhere else. This problem doesn't happen during
subsequent internal site navigation by these clients.

I guess this is yet another Microsoft-specific behaviour;
and remedies which come to mind include:

 - Putting the requested 1447-byte favicon.ico file in every
directory. I assume this file comes standard with NT Server?

 - Refusing access to IE 5.x clients  ;-)

 - Running a cron job to prune the server logs

 - Redirecting the favicon.ico request to a special page; 
contents yet to be determined.

Suggestions anyone?

And following up an earlier thread: I have been told by
BigPond, Optus, Connect, Ozemail, SENet, ihug and several
others that only two broadband technologies are available in
my area: ISDN and satellite. 

Both BigPond & Optus _specifically_ told me there will be no
ADSL or cable from the McLaren Vale exchange until at least
2003 - if ever. I don't think it's a question of uplink
capacity as there is a fibre optic cable to the exchange.
 
Admittedly there is strong community support to retain the
district's rural character, but this is overdoing it...


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
