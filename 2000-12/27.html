John!

&gt; One street where friends lived had a gas line replaced, which involved
&gt; wrecking a number of driveways and digging up neat lawns. They got it
&gt; wrong, and dug it up again a few months later. Once proud homeowners on
&gt; that side of the street let their gardens go wild and their lawns fill
&gt; with weeds because there was no point maintaining them anymore. I'd
&gt; consider that ugly.

Yes it is ugly, however there are a few points:

1)
I've forgotten whether it's a common bylaw, part of legislative law or
common law but the verge ALWAYS belongs to the Council and not the owner

2)
There is a law which specifies that the owner of the house shall keep
the verge in reasonable condition

Now, if someone actually got organised and formed a petition to the
council and/or the utilities to have them financially reimburse them for
damage caused by such digging up we might get somewhere. There's no
point in sulking because someone has wrecked your lawn - better to do
something about it...
