Ahhh, Tim, you sound all twitter and bisted :-)

&gt;&gt; Agreed, this is topic not for the faint hearted, I was very much tempted
to get

&gt;
&gt;But the point is the gov does and will do really stupid things and we
&gt;pay... The things that have been done to screw farmers of late are pretty
&gt;bad... like the silly gun laws. Won't even go into the stupid things like
&gt;how they think a semi auto .22 is more dangerous than a lever action
&gt;.243... 

Well, this is not all that surprising really. You see, a .22 can easily be
turned into a hollow point and get them pollies with their snouts in the
trough, while a .234 is a jacketed round, and could go in a pollie's left
ear and out the right without disturbing the air between :-)

&gt;         Then we have gst and the amount of bullshit work that has to go
&gt;into that. Then there's the good one about farmers having to pay for the
&gt;water they've stored in dams, etc... 

It's all a grand conspiracy played out by the Libs. You see, they expect to
lose the next election, but then they can offer to dismantle Labour's
disasterous GST the next time around. The electorate has an incredibly
short memory, don'cha know?

&gt;But of course they still win votes by announcing 80 million in aid to cane
&gt;farmers - that's where they throw $7000 at farmers to pay their interest
&gt;for another year so the banks can get a better price seeling them up. Lets
&gt;remember who john's pals are.

He hasn't got that many relatives, has he?

&gt;Would they bring in a stupid law to benifit their MS bed buddies (and yes,
&gt;a school is stuck with MS in Qld)... 

Seems like a local QLD issue there :-)  Besides, the more students are
exposed to the evil empire, the more they will be ready for Linux :-)

&gt;I'd bet on it.
