&gt; &gt; hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Re the LDAP question -- I don't know if someone has already answered your
&gt; query, but thought you may like to know that this is a Linux list, not an
&gt; LDAP list... There may be some LDAP experience here, but it's not very
&gt; concentrated... Try the linux-ldap list on
&gt; <A HREF="http://oslab.snu.ac.kr/~djshin/linux/mail-list/,">http://oslab.snu.ac.kr/~djshin/linux/mail-list/,</A> or perhaps do some
&gt; searching of your own... Most of the expertise on this particular list
&gt; (LinuxSA) is Linux-focussed, so if you have a really linuxy LDAP
&gt; question, you may find an answer here, but otherwise you will be better
&gt; off going elsewhere with your query...
&gt; 
&gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; PS: I searched for "LDAP FAQ" on google, and got some results that could
&gt; be promising leads for more general LDAP resources -- try them...


Warning:  Lots of verbage!  But worth the read (imho) if you ever want to
remove an exchange server...

Hello,

Along this vein, I have just had the pleasure of having my boss agree to
remove an Exchange server in preference for a Sendmail server.

He agreed, with the condition that users were still able to access a global
address list, like Exchange provides.

I said "great!" and showed him some demo clients, with MS Outlook
98/Express set up to use an "LDAP Directory Service", pointing to our LDAP
server.

Outlook's LDAP client is not great.  It works, and all, it lets you search
for people - but you HAVE to search.  You *have* to click on the Address
Book, then click "Find", then type part of a name, etc.  It's a	pain.

Or, of course, you can type part of a name in the "To/Cc/Bcc" field, and
have it auto-complete....

He said "no good" - he wants the users to be able to see a LIST of everyone
in the organisation on the screen as soon as the Address Book is started,
or the "To:" button is clicked.

So I went searching for addons.

Microsoft is a bit painful with Outlook.


"Microsoft does not supply a Messaging Application Programming Interface
(MAPI) service to allow Outlook in Corporate/Workgroup mode, to access
e-mail on an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP4) Internet mail server.
This article describes a third-party solution which will provide this
functionality."

What I really want is to have IMAP and *browsable* LDAP installed at the
same time, but it looks like this will have to wait...

HOWEVER:

There's a tool available for free from <A HREF="http://www.nexus.com/">http://www.nexus.com/</A> called
Messageware, which you can install as a "service" in Microsoft Outlook 97
or 98.

To install it in Microsoft 98, you have to have installed 98 in
"Corporate/Workgroup Mode" - otherwise it doesn't support the addition of
third-party services, like Nexus' Messageware.

So, after ages of stuffing around with installing and removing and crashing
Microsoft Outlook 98, I finally made it install in "Corporate/Workgroup"
mode.

I added the Messageware service, and it works *REALLY* well.  The drop-down
box lists all the ou's in my LDAP server, and upon choosing an ou, all the
people from it are listed.  It even supports distribution lists, with the
objectclass=xtDistributionList (or whatever) attribute.

When it starts up, it does a search of all entries on the LDAP server (you
can define the starting depth) and caches them.

It's good.  It's worth its filesize in gold.  It means I can succesfully
almost completely replace Exchange - considering we don't seem to be using
Exchange's group calendering functions - but I think we'll develop one
in-house anyway :)

What sucks pig turds is the fact that when Microsoft Outlook is installed
in "Corporate/Workgroup" mode, you CANNOT install an IMAP service without
buying or finding a third party one.  MS kindly points you to
<A HREF="http://www.us.syntegra.com/imapsp/,">http://www.us.syntegra.com/imapsp/,</A> who charge $150 per client for the
service, after a 30 day evaluation, or something.

You can, however, install "Internet E-mail" - which amounts to a pop3
client.  hahaha.

But it's worth it, to be RID of Exchange.

On reading back through this email, I find that it's all over the place and
horribly difficult to interpret, but I put that down to the fact that I'm
fucking exhausted, so if you have a problem with it, sod off.  :-)


Hope this helps someone :)  Feel free to contact me if you want any help,
or information.

Aren't corporate environments a pain to work in!!  (sometimes ;)


Cheers...

Nick :)
