&gt; 
&gt; By the way that should have been and uses BGP for exterior routing.

Last time I did the PC ISP BGP router type thing, the largest problem I
had was the instability of the various linux ethernet card drivers.  I'm
sure thats been resolved in the last few years, although you
should definately go for some brand name cards.

As to the BGP side of it, I'd highly recommend Zebra
- <A HREF="http://www.zebra.org/">http://www.zebra.org/</A>  It has a cisco-like interface and from what I
hear, its quite stable and feature rich these days.  I'd personally avoid
gated like the plague - it you can infact get it to compile up on your
platform, you'll probably find yourself going through multiple versions
until you actually find one that works properly.

My preference would definately be a purpose built hardware/software
router, but with a bit of effort and patience you should be able to hack
together something to do this.
