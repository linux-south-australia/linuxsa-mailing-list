I'd be curious to know what demmand there is for such a beast in
Adelaide. There was (for instance) at one stage a Telecommunications
museum in Adelaide. It is currently in storage, and has been for over 10
years. I believe one reason for closing it was lack of patronage.

Having said that, I once hd (and to a certain extent more-or-less still
do) contacts into the Investigator Science Centre of Adelaide. It has been
trying to move to larger premesis for some time now, and one proposal that
met with some success was to move it and "related" museums all into one
complex. I think if there were serious demmand for such a museum, then
getting some movement towards setting it up should be easy. I think in
terms of populating it there would be little trouble, I have a number of
friends with all sorts of hardware, and I'm sure many of you out there do
too.

The problem of seeting it up is finding money and a location. Tho such an
institution would be interesting, if there were an entry charge, many
people would be discoraged from entering. If there were no entry charge,
then there is a quesiton of sponsorship (the SA government is unlikely to
be of assisttance here). Housing in a well public transport serviced area
would also be a problem.

The first hurdle however is still demmand. Do people think there is a
demmand for such an entity in Adelaide ?
