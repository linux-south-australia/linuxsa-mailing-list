I'm sure you didn't. Many do though.

&gt; that I believed that they actually took a release of the new RedHats,

&gt; and so on...

They have never done this as far as I know.

Gael took RH5.1 (5.2?) and put KDE and libraries on it for his own use,
put up the ISO image, posted a message and went on holiday. When he got
back from holiday he had a huge inbox, distributors in Australia and the
US were selling CDs with his ISO and people were contributing fixes. Gael
nearly swallowed his false teeth. <A HREF="http://www.portalux.com/nnl/686.html.">http://www.portalux.com/nnl/686.html.</A>
After that more or less they started development. So Mandrake pretty much
never didn't do their own development. Mandrake have some interesting
differentiating factors (as do most of the others.)
