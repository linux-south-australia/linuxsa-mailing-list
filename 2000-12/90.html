&gt; &gt;     - RPM has no policy implications. It is just a tool. There are some

&gt; &gt;       there are no particular standards. dpkg is policy-driven. There is
&gt; &gt;       pre-determined, predictable right way to do many things. The tool

&gt; I suspect that the main problems that people have with RPMs not being
&gt; compatible between distributions are not due to the RPM
&gt; format. 

I agree. The main problems stem from a lack of policy.

&gt; Instead its mainly caused by the way in which the programs
&gt; have been built - eg expected directory hierarchy, versions of
&gt; libraries linked against etc. 

This is largely policy.

&gt; Maybe some users of
&gt; deb-based-but-not-Debian distibutions (such as Corel and Storm (I
&gt; think)) could comment on how well things work when they use Debian
&gt; archives as a source for new packages.

Progeny, Storm and (back then) Corel seem to have made a point of the fact
that they are using the _exact_ packages that Debian use. They are using
live Debian underneath as far as I understand it, rather than putting
their own mods on some Debian snapshot. This means that each distro is
accepting Debian policy. (I believe most of the mini Debian distros do
much the same but I've never checked.)

&gt; Apt support for RPM's sounds very exciting - apt can make it very easy
&gt; to keep a system up to date. Unfortunately until distributions are
&gt; more compatible, it probably still be necessary to have different
&gt; archives for different distributions.

Debian-using distros do not have this model.
