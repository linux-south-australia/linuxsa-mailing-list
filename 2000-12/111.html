&gt; 
&gt; Well I think that many of the distributions would argue that they have
&gt; a cooperating community of users.

They certainly do, and very healthy ones too. But this is not the same
thing as a community of developers. If I want to influence how SuSE/RH put
together sendmail*.rpm I get to talk to a SuSE/RH employee whose job is to
package sendmail, not run an open source project for packaging sendmail.

This isn't a subtle difference, it is a big difference. 

This is the only good explanation I have for why there seem to be far
fewer conflicts and problems with packages on Debian server systems. As
you'll see from the discussions on freshmeat I pointed at yesterday my
experiences seem very common.

Do you have a better explanation?
