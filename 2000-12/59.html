&gt; Hello all.  Was wondering if anyone could shed some light on an
&gt; unusual problem.
&gt; 
Possibly...

&gt; Friend of mine had difficulties trying to access a harddrive
&gt; containing windows partitions on "new" second hand hardware (mb &
&gt; processor) and initially harddrive recognised in BIOS.  
&gt; 
&gt; System booted fine several times under windows.  Attempted to install
&gt; secondary harddisks and BIOS stopped recognising the windows
&gt; harddrive.  

So your friend has a 2nd hand system, with 1 hadrdrive that 
boots fine under windows.   but after you installed a second hard drive 
and now it won't boot at all. 
 although you can boot from a bootable cdrom and a floppy boot disk.
OK .
  1) check to see if  both hard drives are set to the same [master/slave]
setting ( look for jumpers on the hard drive ) and they are connected on
 the same thick ribbon cable . The setting are usally printed on the hard drive
somewhere ?
 They refer to jumpers you may need to change.

If they are  then you have either 2 masters or 2 slaves together and 
that normally doesn't work.  :(

Try removing  the new hard drive, does it boot now ?
If so 
 change the jumper setting  on the new hard drive from slave --&gt; master
                                                        or master---&gt;slave   
Now it should boot !   :)

&gt;Used the LinuxCare rescue CD (the one from the Install Fest with that 
&gt; funny warning :) to see if the partitions were ok and ran linux 
&gt; fdisk. 
&gt; 
&gt; Viewed current partions then and then accidently used the write and
&gt; exit option instead of just quit, and got a warning message regarding
&gt; the MBR on a disk with DOS partitions (can't remember the exact
&gt; warning) and to read the fdisk man page.  

it's alway a good idea to read error messages carefully. but If you 
only viewed the partitions and then wrote and exited. 
they should still be the same.  :)

&gt; 
&gt; Checked the page and nothing seemes to relate to the actual
&gt; situation.  System won't recognize nor boot with this HD connected
&gt; (except in linux - LinuxCare CD or floppy bootdisk), even DOS boot
&gt; disks/CDs seem to fail with HD connected.
&gt; 
&gt; Would anyone have advice as to:
&gt; 
&gt; a.  What the problem could be.
&gt; b.  An either Linux or DOS solution.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice at this point would be greatly appreciated.

If that doesn't help then email the error messages and any partition info 
you can find in fdisk for both hard drives and I might be able to help more  :)
