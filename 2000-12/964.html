I have thought about this post for some time and offer it as food for dis=
cussion.

At the outset please note I am not a "WinTroll" or other childish put dow=
n offered by some list members. =20

I love the concept behind Linux. A free open OS enables a huge diversity =
of software solutions. I dislike the closed environment of Windows, I am =
forced to do everything their way. Doesn't mean that is wrong but I like =
the idea of choice.

Probably 12 months ago I tried RH 6.0 and it took me a few goes to get ev=
erything set up but it worked and I enjoyed the experience. For whatever =
reason I lost access to the Linux partition so went back to Windows. Unde=
r RH6 I couldn't get printer access.

I did find the file structure intriguing but concede that it offers a def=
inite cure to the "teenage bedroom" syndrome offered by windows. It reall=
y is a mess.

Recently I came across the pocket book with RH and MD so fired up Partiti=
on magic and installed MD7.2 with no drama. Everything went very smoothly=
, the only thing missing is my UMAX 1220s scii card.

This is my dilemma : The GUI of KDE or Gnome is great, excellent to work =
with, the preinstalled programmes are very good but to download off the n=
et is a nightmare. I have a folder full of downloaded programmes [rpm's, =
tars etc] and with few exceptions none of them work because something is =
always missing.

if Linux is to be more than a hobby system it has to address the problem =
of people like me that have reasonable computer skills but are not intere=
sted in peeling back every layer of the Linux onion to reach the core.  L=
inux does have an excellent graphic interface and it is simple to use BUT=
 there are not enough dialog boxes to tell you what is happening, where i=
t is happening and when it is finished. Take GNORPM a fairly straightforw=
ard programme to use but doesn't tell me it has completed its task. It do=
es tell me it has failed to install because of dependency issues. The fru=
stration in downloading files only to have them fail is enough to drive p=
eople away from the OS. I have looked at Connectiva 6.0 with its APT get =
function and that may offer some help.

It seems to me that Linux needs some uniformity when it comes to basic li=
braries concerned with compressed programmes off the net.=20

I realise I cannot use Linux for my business at present because of a lack=
 of a suitable equivalent programme to Quickbooks but everything else I n=
eed is there and maybe soon Linux will have the small business issues han=
dled. If Quickbooks 7.4 was available tomorrow for Linux I would move to =
a Linux only box but as it stands it can't offer me real life computing s=
olutions for my business, and the little I know of it shows me its superi=
ority over Windows in many respects.

In conclusion: I don't want to be a command line computer user but if all=
 else fails I will dig deep if I have to.

Steve Nicholls.
