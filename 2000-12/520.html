 &gt; I don't mind this, however:

 &gt; to seize a copy of their work (or other subject matter) that is offered for
 &gt; sale or hire from a place other than a regular or permanent place of
 &gt; business."
 &gt; ie if you are offering to sell copies of M$Office from your home -
 &gt; watch out!

I have a huge problem with this.

If selling MS Office would have the potential to be a life and death 
situation, then I'd agree with you.  But it isn't;  Authorizing a 
company to enter your home without your consent on the suspicion that
you're infringing their copyright is a remedy which is vastly out of
proportion to the size of the threat.

I can see what they want to do here:  they want to allow private search
and siezure in places shared marketplaces, where people might be selling
illegal software (trash and treasures, temporary stalls in markets, 
country fairs, etc).

What they've actually written, though, is that they desire to permit 
copyright owners to enter any building at all which isn't a permanent
business.  Including your house.

No way.  If someone like Microsoft suspects that a private citizen is
selling copies of Windows from their home, a basic sense of reality
would suggest that permitting them to raid the home is disproportionate
when other remedies (e.g.: obtaining a restraining order) would achieve
the same end result. 

Law is a balancing act, where remedies are supposed to be coupled to the
size of the threat:  You don't execute someone for defaulting on a parking
ticket;  You don't give someone a fine for murder.  The sanctity of the
home is a common law right which has been legally recognized for centuries;
A lot of thought should be given to any attempt to abridge that right, 
especially when said abridgement is being lobbied by multi-billion dollar
profit-centered companies who couldn't give a rat's arse about your legal
rights or your privacy.
