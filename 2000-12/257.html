&gt; You have assumed a middle to high end scenario for routing. What scope is
&gt; Jason looking for? It goes without saying that for high capacity systems
&gt; you use the best you can get that is optimised for that role. The same
&gt; goes for database servers, firewalls, transaction systems and so on.

MMy understadnign is that it is not really the size of the network you are
rotuign for ie how many addresses are in your network that is the issue to
complxiety and correctbness(it may be with thoutghput however but for my
case I am not inerested in throughput).

Ratehr I get the impression that the problems with correctness and
complexity are defined by your external realtionships.
Ie how many neghbours you have.

Or basically are you multijhomed?

And if so then how you swap routing info?


&gt; 
&gt; The worse thing about a PC as a router is that you have a noisy box and
&gt; bulky box. Whereas a purpose made rack mounted system with quiet and
&gt; redundant power supplies are much better. Even in the scope of print
&gt; servers, depending on the site and scenario, a dedicated (or integrated)

No the noise you can(or I could) live with. The reliabilty is the real
issue. And the software you can put on it.

&gt; print server is often more suitable, less intrusive and less hassle than
&gt; reviving a 486 with Linux. Even if it is more costly up front.
&gt; 
&gt; But this all depends on the target implementation.
&gt; Embeded Linux may enter the area of dedicated routers. Who knows how it
&gt; will change. IOS seems to be in need of a rethink.

May well. However I bet it woudl be tweaked and have extra modules, or
application sitting on top of it.

&gt; An unoptimise OS and hardware (eg: Linux or FreeBSD on a PC) may be
&gt; suitable for the capacity of some needs.

Capacity certainly.
Capacity is almost certainly at least as much  hardware issue as software.

Complexity however is a different story.
