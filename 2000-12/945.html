Pretty much true.

I have what I believe to be an Adelaide-designed Unix minicomputer that
was manufactured in Melbourne and sold for work on oil rigs and scientific
purposes. I got it from the lab at DSTO that is supposed to have designed
the machine. So there is at least one machine that was not imported
(besides the few x86 boards designed and manufactured here, the skinny
little 286 manufactured in Camden park was years ahead of its time, what
was it called now??)

Melbourne has a rare treasure, the only working first-generation computer
in the world that someone discovered in a CSIRO warehouse 50 years after
it was switched off. I don't know how that restoration project is going.
Don't rule out some bizzare (imported) equivalents lurking in ghettos in
Adelaide.
