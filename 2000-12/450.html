&gt; 
&gt; Recommendation 8 (paragraph 4.38) is of particular concern.  They're
&gt; proposing that the onus of proof be reversed for criminal copyright
&gt; prosecutions (i.e.: the ones you can go to jail for).  In particular,
&gt; someone who claims to be the copyright owner will not need to prove that
&gt; they really are the owner, and that the defendant really is unauthorized
&gt; to deal in the copyrighted materials -- i.e., there needs to be legally-
&gt; admissible evidence that the material in question isn't, say, public-domain.
&gt; The proposal is that it'll be the defendant's job to prove that the person
&gt; who claims to be a copyright owner is lying, or that they have authorization.

What would be considered proof? I mean, would a copy of the source from
the original place be suitable? Most GPL'd software will usually contain
a statement saying that it was to be released under the GPL. The same
would go for a BSD-style license.

&gt;  &gt; and I'm sure there is more.
&gt; 
&gt; Lots.

Too much to read.....
