&gt; Can some one please help -   I am a Linux newbie and my installation of
&gt; Mandrake 7.2 went like a dream - it says my sound card, an Ensoniq Audio
PCI
&gt; (1370) is configured correctly, and when I boot into and log off from KDE
I
&gt; have sound.  I also have sound when I test the configuration, but the rest
&gt; of the time I have silence, and cannot play audio cds, although I can
access
&gt; cd-roms from both my cd-rom drive and my burner (my burner is not
connected
&gt; to the sound card).  Obviously I have to do something else but have no
idea
&gt; where to go from here.

You say you have sound at these times.... but are you only trying cd music??
If you are, then im thinking that your sound is normaly working, its just
that your mixer settings are wrong.
Try playing with "aumix" a bit to see if the cdrom's audio line is muted or
the volume is down.

&gt; I have read the HowTos and something I have read suggests it may have
&gt; something to do with my internal ISA modem, a Diamond Voice 56i, which
&gt; hasn't been recognized ( I am using Windows to access this site!) but
should
&gt; be if I knew what to do.  According to the info with my card I can set it
&gt; manually with jumpers.  My Award Bios is currently set up to recognize
Plug
&gt; and Play, should I change that?

Ive found its always better to leave "Plug an Play aware OS" in the bios to
"no".
Linux prefers it this way and it also gives less headaches with conflicts in
Windows.
But if you set it to "no", windows might have a bit of a stress cos itll
prolly need to redetect all your PCI cards.

Now, is your modem a "WinModem" ??
If it is, youll have a few problems getting it going under linux.
I havnt played with winmodems at all, so could someone else help out
here....

MWP

&gt; My audio card uses IRQ 10 in Windows and IRQ 5 in Dos and I have no
&gt; conflicts under Windows and no IRQ sharing.  My modem is on Com Port 4.

&gt; Thank you
&gt;
