George!

&gt; I have a need to crack a password on a MS-Word Document.

Excellent. Passwords were meant to be broken.

&gt; is there
&gt; anything that will do more than two chacters (password is about 10)...
&gt; platform doesn't matter but I would like the source regadrles...

A stupidly simple shell script could do that. Perl would be easier. What
are you asking, because I presume that you've already thought of these
answers...
 
&gt; Before someone says it... I'm not trying to get into a document that i'm
&gt; not supposed to have... :)  A friend what had this word document for two
&gt; years and has forgotten what it is.

President Reagan claimed that US citizens were under threat from the
Communists when they were not. He, nonetheless, killed people otherwise.
Given that the President of the United States of America's lies - and
they were lies - can cause peoples' lives to be lost, what faith are we
to have in this statement?
 
&gt; Fortunately I have a spare windows computer and a lot of spare cpu
&gt; cycles on a Linux box. So if it takes a day, it doesn't matter...

Brute password checking. Boring. Recursive loops or even explicit
loops....
