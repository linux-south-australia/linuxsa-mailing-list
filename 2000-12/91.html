<H1>SQUID: Filemap bits?</H1>

<PRE>
People,
	How concerned should I be, when the squid cache manager says 51% of
my file map bits are in use?  Its currently using only 0.5GB of a 6GB store,
will use of filemap bits prevent the store expansion to its full size?
Should I have mkfs'd with different parameters for more inodes etc.?  Where
should I look to fully grok filemap bits?

TIA,
	Jamz
