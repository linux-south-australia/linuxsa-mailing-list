I am about to swap a second hand PCI SCSI II interface (10mb/s bandwidth?) with an external port in return for a Ricoh 2mb buffer IDE burner that is driving me up the wall.  Linux appears to prefer SCSI at most times, especially for cd burning (which is why it 'emulates' SCSI over IDE for a burner).  Is this a good swap?

I have heard that SCSI adaptors are quite expensive, especially ones with an external port (which I intend to link to a scanner) and use far less CPU time than IDE even if IDE speed is approaching or even exceeding many SCSI adaptors.  Is this true?

Would I then be able to stick in another SCSI hard drive with the SCSI burner?  The 10mbs bandwidth concerns me and I am wondering if I should purchase a new SCSI adaptor (this one is two years old).  I am not sure if I have the bandwidth right, but that is what I thought someone told me.

What is the bandwidth of a modern IDE interface?  Is it true that IDE relies more on the CPU?  Is SCSI ultimately more reliable?  Everyone I have spoken with tells me that IDE is certainly respectable and fast today, but SCSI is more reliable and less resource hungry.

Secondly - I am thinking of getting a Yamaha 4mb buffer 8x write r/w burner to go with the SCSI adaptor.  I have heard many good things about Yamaha.  I am picking it up for around $400 inc gst.

I ask these questions as I know very little, still!!!!

There is so much to learn for someone who has never studied computers in his life!

Thank you for your time, and I hope someone can help me :-)

Regards,

Ian Mcleod
