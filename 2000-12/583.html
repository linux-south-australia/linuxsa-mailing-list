&gt;&gt;You're kidding, right?  Look, suppose you can test each possibility in 1
&gt;&gt;nanosecond, which you can't because modern computers can't access memory
&gt;&gt;that quickly, let alone execute the many instructions needed to setup and
&gt;&gt;test each possibility.  But anyway, let's pretend that you have a *really*
&gt;&gt;quick machine.  It will still take you an average of 20 million years to
&gt;&gt;crack that ten character password.
&gt;
&gt;What a load of bullshit David. More like 36Hours
&gt;been there had to do that..did it

You must be borrowing distributed.net to get those sorts of results on
password cracking.

If the authentication system could keep up with you (and most authentication
systems will have a pausing behaviour on password failure) you've still got
26^6 possible passwords with just a weak 6-letter code. If I'm generous and
say your system can do 1000 such password checks per second, you're still
looking at 85 hours to check all possible combinations. There's a slim
chance someone might take a crack at it. An average Radius server would be
at peak performance answering 30 authentication requests per second.

This is why you should always use a 7-character password for anything that's
important, the single extra character will extend the 85 hours to 90 days of
checking. By that time you've probably changed the password anyway, or
someone will have noticed what's going on, or the protected information is
no longer valuable. If someone's that desperate to get the password and has
no way of sniffing it off your network, they're more likely to use some
tempest-style gear and an unmarked van to capture your keystrokes, or come
in and bludgeon it out of you.

I don't know what sort of encryption word uses, but humans have had
remarkable success over the years in breaking elaborate cyphers by looking
for common patterns rather than brute force. Humans also tend to use things
like pets names[1] for passwords, so a dictionary attack can be far more
effective.

[1] This is marginally more clever than the people who use their
bank-assigned pin number as a password.
