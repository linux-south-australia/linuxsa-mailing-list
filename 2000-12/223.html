Hi Tim,

I think you are right..

I will wait until 7.3 comes out when the 2.4 kernel is FINALLY released and I will then get the deluxe boxed set again.

If anyone wants it I will happily burn a copy for them.

What's the deal with copying?  It is funny that since I moved away from Microsoft and do not have their screwed up ideas rammed down my throat every time I switch the computer on - I actually WANT to do the right thing by the company.  I am quite happy with Mandrake and only want to copy what is intended for copying.

I feel an ethical dilemna coming on :-(

&gt;&gt; I have recently acquired the download version of Linux Mandrake 7.2.  
&gt;&gt; After using Diskdrake to partition the hard drive and assign mount
&gt;&gt; points - packages are installed but I then receive an error suggesting
&gt;&gt; that my CD installation disc could be corrupt as some important
&gt;&gt; packages could not be installed and then on the next step the error
&gt;&gt; 'hdlist not found' and I can not do much from there.  I suspect that
&gt;&gt; 7.2 has been released prematurely from some reports that I have been
&gt;&gt; getting from around the Internet.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If anyone has any ideas - please let me know.
&gt;
&gt;No ideas, really, except that the disk has a problem. Is it and iso you
&gt;burned or did you buy it? Or is it the pressed version
&gt;
&gt;I got my Duck7.2 on cdr from everythinglinux and installed it on two
&gt;machines. Runs on both, tho having some x probs on one. On this box it's
&gt;my main work machine, tho I'm still in the process of moving things over
&gt;as I did a clean install. 
&gt;
&gt;7.2 does have a lot of new packages, like KDE2, which are a bit raw. but
&gt;it generally does work and some of the stuff is very nice. The new
&gt;konquerer browses the whole network and samba shares nicely so that even
&gt;my wife can handle it at last. Sure, a bit windowish... But better :-)
&gt;
&gt;The install on this box went pretty well flawless, tho there do seem to be
&gt;a few glitches in the package selection - not as bad as a previous version
&gt;as I remember.
&gt;
&gt;Premature... Maybe, but I'm happy. I'm sure the next will be
&gt;better. Everything is developing so quickly it's hard to get a 100%
&gt;perfect install it seems.
