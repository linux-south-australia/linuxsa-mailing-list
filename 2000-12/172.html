&gt; Ok... this has me puzzled.
&gt; Cant true "multitasking" (running more than one prog at once) only be done
&gt; on SMP systems (eg systems with more than one CPU).
&gt; Arent all single CPU systems just task-switching (like linux on a snigle CPU
&gt; system)?

I think it is all a matter of definition as well as 'computer science
official terms' verses 'human language in every day use terms'.

All single (non-parallel) CPU systems do task switching very quickly, so
that it seems like multiple tasks are being done at once. Eg: multiple
clocks update on screen at the 'same' time. 'Same' is just very
subjective, depending on whether you are the computer or a human user.

Task switching is a term I like to use for the old DOS Shell and similar
systems where you could swap between multiple programs that were
concurrently in memory, but only the program in focus would actually be
doing anything. Programs that where not in use would not be executing any
code at all.
