OK, I should be able to sort this out on my own, but due to the fact that my
brain has stopped, I can't... I've been messing around with my debian box,
and trying to make XF86 work like I expect it to. I have Debian potato
(2.2), with XF86 3.3.6, a Diamond Viper V330, HelixCode GNOME 1.2 (latest
deb from the helixcode website) with sawfish/sawmill, and 2 unsolved
problems...

Initially I struggled making my mouse work. It's a MS Intellimouse Explorer
USB/PS2 (the one with the red LEDs -- ooah). I have it plugged into my PS/2
port with the supplied converter, and mostly it works fine. However, I have
only 2 buttons working, and no wheel. So I try using XF86Setup to screw with
the mouse (eg try changing protocol from PS/2 to IMPS/2), and now it's
screwed. (oh really?) ... It seems that every time I do much with that
program, the mouse gets excited and input becomes garbled. Whenever I move
the mouse, the pointer runs around the screen like it's on speed, and
buttons go off randomly. So I give up on that, but it's unbeleivably
difficult to make it revert to normal -- if I edit /etc/X11/XF86Config
manually, it appears to have none of the settings I changed in it... I can
run XF86Setup again, and no matter whether I tell it to base the X config on
the existing config or not, it comes up with the mouse problem. The only way
I can seem to reconfigure it is by using xf86configure... and then that
works... kinda... (I guess that half is two problems -- the
how-do-I-make-my-intellimouse-work-with-3-buttons-and-a-wheel problem and
the what-do-I-do-when-my-mouse-is-on-speed problem...

However, now that the mouse has come down, all seems ok - I start gdm
(reboot, even -- after trying a few times), and it looks good... I log in...
the XServer gets stoned[*] and dies... doesn't matter who I log in as --
root or a user... I can't find any error logs... ~/.xsession-errors has
nothing, nor does /var/log/messages, or anythign else I cna think of off the
top of my head... where do I look to fix this problem? oh, and by the way...
I recently (immediately before X broke entirely, but after my mouse went off
the rails) did an apt-get update/upgrade, and got the latest Helix stuff...
this _may_ be broken... could someone else download it and break their
machine to make me feel better? Thanks ;)

In short:
How do I make an Intellimouse (ooah) work with 3 buttons and a wheel
How do I stop my mouse getting excited when using XF86Setup to configure for
3 buttons and a wheel
How do I find out why X is dying when I log in (and how do I fix it is the
next question, but that's easy when you know why it's dying -- or so I've
been told ;)

[*] well, ok, this is taking the metaphor too far... the mouse on speed is
actually quite accurate though :)
