&gt; Hi all.
&gt; 
&gt; Just after some advice from someone who can tell me a bit about Win2000
&gt; maybe...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to talk a friend into using linux for a server box rather than
&gt; going to something like NT or win2000.
&gt; 
&gt; The box would just share files, printer, net connection... Not sure about
&gt; web server... The usual stuff. I think linux would do everything they
&gt; want, just they only know windows.
&gt; 
&gt; So to hit the hip pocket I was wondering what sort of win2000 would you
&gt; need... Say there are about 4 or 5 workstations connected to this (I'm not
&gt; sure... Does that mean you would need win2000 for 5 clients, or will an
&gt; ordinary win2000 client do most of the basic stuff. like the 5 client
&gt; version costs about $1600 up here, which seems pretty ridiculous...

Okay. Whay you need is a Windows 2000 server which comes with 5 client
lincences, which is the minimum you can get I believe. the licences can be
bought seperately. What a client license does is authorise you to connect a
workstation to the server. The client license does not, however, allow you
to install an OS on the client, that's extra. Not sure about Win 2K, but
with NT 4, you have to select whether you want 'per server' or 'per client'
licensing, just to complicate things.

Of course, sharing the net connection takes extra software, since Win NT
(and 2K I believe) can't by default share a connection unless each machine
has a real IP address.

&gt; I figure you could set up a pretty good linux server for a bit less than
&gt; that :-)  Even if you had to hire someone to set it up.

Undoubtedly.
