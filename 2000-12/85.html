On Mon, 4 Dec 2000, Paul Schulz wrote (along with several others in
private mail):

&gt; What feature does 'rpm' have that is lacking in 'dpkg'?

There are two, but one in particular potentially has value to some users:
RPM allows the user to have different versions of the same package on the
same system. (There is a workaround for dpkg.)

You really should read the articles I pointed you at because the analysis
done by the author and some of those who commented on his work is quite
thorough, much more so than what I posted. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough,
but when I said:

  "The work described and the resulting discussion brings out many technial
  features of both systems. I won't repeat technical information that is
  in these articles, but it mirrors my experiences well. "

what I meant was that if you don't read the articles referred to then mine
won't have much value.
