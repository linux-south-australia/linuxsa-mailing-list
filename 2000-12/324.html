&gt; Geoffrey!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Kublai Khan (off Glen Osmond Road)
&gt;
&gt; Named after a Mongolian ruler, who coincidentally released Marco Polo on
&gt; the same date as Adelaide was established.

Also well known in a Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem around 1800:
   "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
    A stately pleasure-dome decree:
    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
    Through caverns measureless to man
       Down to a sunless sea..."

More useless info:
Coleridge was recovering from dysentery at a farm.  He took some opium that
had been prescribed and sat down to read Purchas' Pilgrimage.  Next thing he
knew, he was zoned for about three hours, only to come back down to earth
with an entire poem composed in his head dealing with the subject he was
reading about.  He wrote it down immediately.  Later, when he returned to
his writings, he scarcely even remembered or recognized the work.

Who knows... maybe they named the restaurant thus because the food has a
similar effect...?
