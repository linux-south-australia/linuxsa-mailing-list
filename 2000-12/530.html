I have had cups running with no problems under Mduck7.2, I have a apple
postscript laser writer and there are two drivers, one specifically for the
apple and another generic postscript.  They both worked just fine ( i did
remove 7.2 for other reasons in favour of 7.1)
 Have you checked the margin settings for the driver you are using?  You can
do this by running printtool and reset the printer taking care off course to
check the settings.  It sounds to me (guessing though) that you have the wrong
printer driver installed.

As for printing from the term, did you pipe it through eg cat filexxx  |  lp
???? Or did you print through KDE terminal with the print button (I think
there was one but cant be sure) either way try both and check the results.


More specific details may help

&gt; Has ANYONE had any luck with CUPS on MD7.2
&gt;
&gt; I can get a test page with various drivers and that's about it. I can
&gt; print text from a couple of apps, though tend to get bits cut off here and
&gt; there. I can't print direct from a term as it cuts off the left margin by
&gt; one character, etc...
&gt;
&gt; I tried to remove it, but it seems that there are a dozen dependency
&gt; problems... I hate it so much I'd like to go back to lpd which worked fine
&gt; before, but it seems that things like printtool are missing (replaced by
&gt; links to printerdrake and CUPS stuff...
&gt;
&gt; But really, what's the use of a test page. You'd think if it printed a
&gt; test page then it would print other stuff as well. But graphics from
&gt; netscape, gimp, etc are crap... Usually a black blob...
&gt;
&gt; Pity, as it's a nice distro otherwise. But I feel if I can't work it then
&gt; dog help the newbies....
