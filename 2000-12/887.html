Hi Tim

I'd say one of you 8 gig drives didn't like being powered down and got stuck 
on starting up again. I'd keep an eye on them and leave them on overnight, so 
that they power down, one at a time and see if you can isolate which one it 
was.

&gt; Until a few days ago I had a P120 system with 2 x 8gig fugitsu drives and
&gt; 48 meg ram running a triple boot win 95 - MDK 7.2 - MDK 7.0
&gt;
&gt; the two drives were master and slave on the primary IDE (I now have them on
&gt; separate IDE channels)
&gt;
&gt; the Master drive had /dev/hda1 as a extended partition with various fat
&gt; partitions and two linux partitions for / and /home - tagged as type 83 of
&gt; course. It also had /dev/hda2 as the windows 95 partiton and an old boot
&gt; magic part on /dev/hda3 - not used anymore.
&gt;
&gt; The system was booted with Boot Magic from a mandrake dirstro.
&gt;
&gt; It runs pretty much 24/7 in a nice airconditioned room.
&gt;
&gt; A couple of days before christmas I came to the machine with the screen
&gt; saver running and the drives powered down. Hadn't been used in a while. I
&gt; moved the mouse and the rives power up - then it locks hard and I get the
&gt; horrible dead drive controller clicking sound coming from a drive. I lost
&gt; an old 1 gig drive on this machine a few months back (maybe a conected
&gt; problem) and had a similar sound.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, had little choice but to kill the power. Not surprisinly, the
&gt; machine wouldn't boot and gave a funny sound.
&gt;
&gt; So the box was opened and everything disconnected to find the prob. The
&gt; slave drive has quite a few bad blocks on it and it's older, so I tried it
&gt; first - but it sounded fine during power on. I booted tomsrtbt and checked
&gt; the drive. Looked okay so I bagged it. Had all the important data on it :-)
&gt;
&gt; The master drive also powered up okay on it's own, but wouldn't boot.
&gt; Didn't get a controller error though. Booted with toms and had a look with
&gt; fdisk. Looked okay except there was only one linux partition! Okay, so my
&gt; /home partition was wiped it seemed...
&gt;
&gt; On closer inspection tho, I found that the /home partition, which is
&gt; definately ext2, had been retagged as a fat type 6 partition - so it was
&gt; there. I couldn't mount it with toms however, so I figured it was damaged.
&gt; I have since been able to mount the partition, so not sure what the trouble
&gt; was there.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, it was a fairly new install and I couldn't get it to boot, so I
&gt; cleaned the part with / and made a new filesystem, did bad blocks on it,
&gt; etc, and it all looked fine. The drive works, no bad blocks...
&gt;
&gt; I did an fdisk /mbr from dos and even got the win part to boot...
&gt;
&gt; So after losing a drive and then having a major crash like this I got
&gt; worried about power supplies and mb's  - so I went out and got whatever I
&gt; could on christmas eve. My nice computer guy opened his shop and I got a
&gt; fairly good deal on a PIII 700 with case and mb and ram (it was all he
&gt; had).
&gt;
&gt; I put the two 8 gig drives in that - both as master drives on each ide and
&gt; the cd as a primary slave. MDK 7.2 is reinstalled and so is bootmagic.
&gt;
&gt; I can now even mount the old /home partition and it looks okay. Had to
&gt; fiddle a bit with MDK 7.0 as it was on the other drive and was shifted from
&gt; hdb to hdc, but it's working now as well.
&gt;
&gt; So, the questions :-)
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas how or what happened ???
&gt;
&gt; If I retag the 'lost' /home partition from 6 to 83, will it wipe it... At
&gt; the moment windows can 'see' it but can't mount it of course. I'm still
&gt; getting my cd-writer going (ide) and have to get the kernal right. When
&gt; I do I'll try and back it up just in case.
&gt;
&gt; There is not a lot on this /home part as it was a fairly new install, but
&gt; there is a little data and some downloads with cost me a bit in time and
&gt; money on the slow connection...
&gt;
&gt; This has to be the worst crash since I've been using linux (for several
&gt; years) but what really strange is that all the hardware seems to be
&gt; working. Drives are going fine in the new machine and the old box is
&gt; working fine on another drive on the 'test bench'. I was sure it had to be
&gt; some sort of hardware thing - perhaps with the two hd's on the one channel
&gt; on the old mb - I don't know.
&gt;
&gt; I'd just like to think it wasn't a linux software glitch that damaged the
&gt; mbr and changed partition table entries!!!
