Hmmm?  That maybe.  Obviously I don't get notified when somebody joins the
list.  It's hard to keep track of everybody, and the topic comes up so
frequently.  If Tim hasn't seen that discussion then I apologise for saying
that he "must surely recall" it.  However...

&gt; I thought your message to him was uncalled for and rude.

I suppose this is the bit that you found rude:

&gt;&gt;  Adam said that most of the
&gt;&gt; list messages are duplicated.  Unless you honestly believe that they were
&gt;&gt; all addressed to him as well as the list your suggestion smacks of
extremely
&gt;&gt; poor logic or a disingenious attempt to restart a tired old debate.
Please
&gt;&gt; do not resurrect the "I want the sender/from address rewritten" debate.

Let's think about this.  Adam *did* say that most of the list messages are
duplicated, so to suggest that they were addressed to him as well as to the
list does smack of poor logic, if not something else.  What do you think
that something else might be, Robyn, since you find (I suppose) the idea
that it could be disingenuity to be uncalled for and/or rude?  Maybe Tim
hasn't seen the debate before, in which case it's poor logic, pure and
simple.  That sounds even ruder to me, but hey, I never promised that I
could do tact.
