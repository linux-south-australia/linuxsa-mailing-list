&gt;&gt; BTW, do you know why M$ chose drive letters and the '\' over the
&gt;&gt; traditional Unix / method??
&gt;
&gt; 1) OS limitation; you can't "graft" a file system tree with a limited
&gt; file system/OS (and later implementations of grafting were a kludge).
&gt; Hence the drive letters (original DOS didn't have directory hierarchies
&gt; either - it was just a straight CP/M ripoff).
&gt;
&gt; 2) Potential for lawsuit from the Unix camp (I think AT&T had just
&gt; started marketing Unix, as Bell Labs. couldn't).

Hmm.  There are too many other things in Microsoft which look
UNIX-like, and which would give more grounds for lawsuits than the
choice of a / character.  I'm sure you could find prior uses of / for
directory delimiters.

I think the real issue was that they had already started using / for
option flags (so you could do things like DIR/W, whatever that means).
They needed a different character for the directory delimiter, and
nobody realized what a problem it would be.

&gt; I'm a bit rusty on the timelines[1], but bear in mind that in those
&gt; days, Microsoft had arranged for some little-known outfit called the
&gt; Santa Cruz Operation to port Xenix to Intel machines, so Microsoft
&gt; were influenced in some fashion by Unix at the time.

They started porting XENIX in 1980.  I think the first DOS with
subdirectories was 2.0, which must have come out about 2 or 3 years
later.

&gt; As to "\" vs "/", it was just a perverse choice I think. There's a
&gt; DOS int 0x21 call to switch it to "/", which is what people who had
&gt; to work with both Xenix and DOS sometimes did.

I think you'll find it has atrophied.  There were some good reasons
why it wouldn't work, probably assumptions in userland code.

&gt;&gt; which is what people who had to work with
&gt;&gt; both Xenix and DOS sometimes did.
&gt;
&gt; I gave up on Xenix after tickling too many (well, two) code
&gt; generation bugs in their C compiler (and MS Basic offered you all
&gt; the advantages of MS Basic with none of the advantages of running it
&gt; under Unix(/Xenix) - I could never figure out how to disable ^C
&gt; processing without editing the binary, which made it useless for the
&gt; BBS I was trying to write for someone).

Not that long ago (about 7 years) I wrote some significant software
for XENIX.  Yes, the entire software development environment was
terrible, but I was able to get the GNU tools working, and after that
it wasn't too bad.  About the only real nuisance was the lack of NFS.
