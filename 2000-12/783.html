&gt; What's the difference between passive and non-passive ftp and which is the

Firewall authors want you to use passive, as all connections
are then established from the client to the server and are
thus easily tracked.

Server owners like you to use the standard form and would
get rid of passive if possible as it opens up the server
to a simple denial of service attack (ask for a passive
connection, which leaves the server with a port awaiting
a connection, repeat until ports on server exhausted).

Download statistics from the AARNet mirror suggests that
FTP is only marginally more efficient than HTTP.

I don't understand why people are dissing FTP's security.
It is actually quite secure if you run a secure authentication
method like Kerberos.  If you only have a few files you
want to distribute then encrypt them with GPG and make them
available for anonymous FTP.  Now the files are safe even if
your server is hacked.  This looks less secure than SFTP, but
it's actually much more secure.
