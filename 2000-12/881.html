&gt; fellas,
&gt;  i am pretty sure that my mb is dead, i need confiramtion of my worst

&gt;  symptoms - atx celron 400, on gigabyte board, socket 7.
&gt;  a while back, it was making crazy beeping noises, kinda like a late 80's
&gt;  videogame. was that overheating, think so... i thought powersupply was
&gt; stuffed, so it
&gt;  got put it away for a month or so. i put in a new powersupply yesterday, (no i
&gt;  did not have a bad christmas...) but nothing. the powersupply is good, and the
&gt;  one i took out was also good, i tried it in another system. thought it might
&gt; be
&gt;  the switch, tried another, no good. tried removing the switch, and using a
&gt; jumper,
&gt;  no good.
&gt;  
&gt;  ok here is the thing, press the switch, and the cpu fan moves, but then stops.
&gt;  have i killed my motherboard?? the ram that was in it is fine and works, as do
&gt;  all other things. video, lan sound etc.
&gt;  all things point to dead motherboard.... doh!!
&gt; &gt; any ideas??
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thankx 
&gt; &gt; james mcle


ok   Some motherboards have a over temp alarm set in the bios that 
will beep if it gets too hot .  (possibly your cpu fan has died)
was the system working ok but just beeping  or did it beep and not boot.? 
many bios's do a self check before booting and use beeps to alert you to
problems.  (such as memory errors video error etc)
If you post some more details of the symptoms  ie
how many beeps and when do they occur?
is there a video signal?
and what cards do you have plugged into the motherboard?
I might be able to help more.

If the cpu fan almost turns over then stops you may have a short across 
your power supply. 
try removing all your hardware and leave just the video card.  (  with the
power off , after earthing your self on the case of course ! 
( unplug floppy power, hdd power, and remove sound cards etc) 
 if it boots ok now then one of those was shorting your psu .  
add them back one by one and check to see if the problem returns.

goodluck and let me know what happens
