This isn't at all clear.  I've just read a paper on packets
that had TCP/UDP checksum errors despite having fine link
layer CRCs. [1]

Such packets were present in 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 20,000
packets.  1 in 20,000 is a very common if you think in
packets/second terms.

A major cause of these errors was cheap hardware in hosts.
In particular
  - memory
  - motherboards
  - ethernet interfaces

The moral seems to be that if you are planning to use a PC-based
router then you need to buy from the high end of the market.

Similarly, the names "Intel" , "3Com", "Cisco", "HP", "Compaq"
were prominent by their absence in the listings of malfunctioning
gear.  "DLink" and "Apple" appeared too often for my liking.

Serial overruns also seem to be a problem: this comes down
to UARTs and configuring CTS/RTS handshaking on the modem.

Even one additional bad packet per second generated by a router
will cause a huge backoff for the two communicating hosts, and
thus undo any headline packets-per-second figure.
