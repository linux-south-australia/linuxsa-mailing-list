&gt; Yes, $1600 is correct and ridiculous which is why
&gt; major corporations don't jump on the upgrade wagon very often.

Licensing fees are not quite as big an issue for major corporations as you may 
think... the real reason they don't upgrade immediately is stability and so on 
-- most organisations have a policy of waiting for the first service pack before 
rolling out new Windows and Office releases... They also tend to stay a minor 
version or two behind -- I know of an NT guy who was adminstering a few linux 
boxes, and he would refuse to have the latest kernel on them, always staying 
2 or 3 releases behind... While licensing is a major cost, in most 
organisations, it is dwarfed by the cost of support staff, and if a particular 
release is not reliable, the cost of support sraff increases significantly. Note 
also that it's really only the larger corporations that actually understand the 
cost of support staff, as they have whole divisions of support staff with their 
own budgets. Smaller organisations tend to underestimate the cost of support, as 
it's provided in an employee's spare time -- hence licencing costs are a bigger 
issue for them...
