Damien! [Ho ho]

You did not say what size filesystems need to be backed up, what type of
backup device you have available, nor what sort of network connectivity is
supplied.  I'm going to assume that you are still choosing backup device,
and that the system is a stand-alone unit which must be backed up locally,
rather than via a network.  In these circumstances you need to make sure
that you choose a backup device that can store more data than fits on a
filesystem.  The reason I say that is because it's too much to hope that
staff can change media mid-backup, so each backup must fit on a single unit.
Theoretically you could design your backup strategy around specific
sub-directory trees, for example maybe /home/project fits on one (say) tape,
and /home/everything-else fits on another tape, leaving all of the rest of
the filesystem for the third tape; but it's easier if you can just backup
/dev/sd01 to one tape, /dev/sd02 to a second and /dev/sd03 to the third.  I
say again: it's easier if each filesystem fits on a single backup media.
It's even better if all filesystems fit on one unit, because then you can
backup everything in one go.

I believe tapes still provide the greatest capacity, although with DVD-R
coming along (87GB?), maybe that might be an interesting option.  But no,
don't even think about it.  All reports that I've heard suggest that DVD-R
is not yet prime-time.  Stick to tapes.  I suggest DAT is a good choice.
You can backup oodles of GB on one DAT, and it seems quite reliable.

How often you backup depends on your particular needs, but daily (I mean
nightly) probably isn't unreasonable.  Do make sure that you have plenty of
copies.  It's common to have a regime where every so often, say quarterly, a
complete backup is taken onto new media, and then stord off-site forever.
Never overwritten!  It's common, in addition, to have a number of sets of
media which are used in rotation on a daily or weekly basis.  I don't think
ten sets is too many.  Data is so hard to recover without backups.

So either daily or weekly, depending on your needs: if all filesystems
combined will fit on one tape then do that; otherwise split the backup over
a few nights putting complete filesystems onto separate tapes.

What program should you use?  I suppose the standard choices would be dump
or tar.  I rather like cpio.  It's simple and portable.  Use find to
generate a list of names on the filesystem you are copying, and pipe that
into cpio.  The output of cpio goes to your tape device:

  cd /
  find . -xdev -print | cpio -o | dd bs=64k &gt; /dev/rmt0

One tip: It's a great idea to put, at the start of each tape, a "tape file"
that describes what is on the tape.  Do that using echo and/or date, writing
to the non-rewinding tape device:

  cd /
  date +"backup of / taken on %c" | dd bs=64k of=/dev/nrmt0
  find . -xdev -print | cpio -o | dd bs=64k of=/dev/rmt0

The advantage of that is that you can know what is on a tape by catting it:

  $ cat /dev/rmt0
  backup of /home & /devel taken on Sat Nov 04 12:02:33 EST 1989

Remember that you are running the backup on a live-filesystem, which means
changes can take place as you backup.  If you change a file while you are
copying it to tape the backup of that file will be valueless.  At best you
will get some sort of message (on stdout), at worst no warning at all.  Do
try to schedule these backups when nothing else is being done on the
filesystem.  Sometimes that cannot be achieved, but then sometimes it
doesn't matter if a file is properly backed up or not.

Schedule your backups using cron.  Make sure you check for a tape in the
tape drive before you start, and send an error message if it's not there.
Something like the following is good:

  #! /bin/sh
  # backup home and devel filesystems
  # run at cron at 3am every monday by the following crontab entry:
  # 0 3 * * 1 /usr/local/sbin/monday-backups

  # retension the tape... generally a good idea, and it gives us some idea
if no tape is inserted
  mt -f /dev/rmt0 retension || {
    echo "Unable to retension tape.  Perhaps there is no media in the
drive?" |
      mail -s "Backup of /home & /devel failed" admin damien
    exit 1
  }

  # write a tape header
  date +"Backup of /home & /devel taken on %c" | dd bs=64k of=/dev/nrmt0

  # write the backups
  cd /
  (find home devel -xdev -print | cpio -o | dd bs=64k of=/dev/nrmt0) 2&gt;
/tmp/errors$$

  # mail errors to important people
  [ -s /tmp/errors$$ ] &&
    mail -s "Errors backing up /home & /devel" admin damien &lt; /tmp/errors$$
  rm -f /tmp/errors$$

  # rewind and eject the tape
  mt -f /dev/rmt0 rewoffl


None of the above discussion applies to files which are maintained by an
application that maintains online/offline state in those files.  Informix is
an example of such an applicaiton.  The problem is that you simply cannot
take a copy of an Informix data store and expect the data engine to use that
file.  Informix will notice that the file was not properly closed, and will
want to perform some sort of error recovery.  Last time I used Informix, it
had a "fast recovery" mode that seemed to take only about two days to
recover our system.  Not pretty.  If you have such an application either use
it's backup facility, or else shut that application down before backing up.

Have fun.

David

P.S. Ignore DL when he suggests Amanda.  That is probably not the answer for
you.
