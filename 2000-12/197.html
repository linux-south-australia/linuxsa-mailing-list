Jason!

&gt; &gt; The multitasking I spoke of was "pre-emptive" meaning it's just real fast
&gt; &gt; task switching.

I'm not sure what the original responder actually meant here; he
probably did mean what you said but didn't use terms such as "timeslice"
and other jargon :-)

&gt; I thought that pre-emptive meant that the OS decided when a process's
&gt; timeslice was up and just did the context switch the program had no say.
&gt; (as opposed ot cooperative multitaskign when the program voluntarily
&gt; yeilds cpu whenever it feels like it)

Yes.

&gt; Ie the OS _pre-empts_ the process. I did not realise premeptive
&gt; multitasking was any faster in context switching. Comments?

It's not. How efficiently a process can allow the context to switch
includes, but is not limited to, the following factors:

* hardware design
* O/S design
* compiler design (i.e. the compiler could create code that was simply
not friendly to a context switch but ran really fast with few switchtes,
or it could attempt to optimize for it context switching but run not so
fast with few switches)

I'm sure there's more things than this, but it's a start...
