Oh, yeah.  Sigh.

 &gt; We have until February until the next meeting of the committee
 &gt; if we wish to comment.
 &gt; Of particular concern:
 &gt;  - employers are held responsible for software on employees
 &gt;    machines.  So you can expect a corporate crack down on
 &gt;    installation of any software, free or otherwise.
 &gt;  - Stating that your machine shouldn't be ceased because
 &gt;    it is running Linux and thus can't possibly infringe
 &gt;    doesn't cut it -- you still lose the machine and need
 &gt;    to go to court to get it back.
 
I'm sure the submission you're sending will cover these in detail anyway.

Recommendation 8 (paragraph 4.38) is of particular concern.  They're 
proposing that the onus of proof be reversed for criminal copyright 
prosecutions (i.e.: the ones you can go to jail for).  In particular,
someone who claims to be the copyright owner will not need to prove that
they really are the owner, and that the defendant really is unauthorized
to deal in the copyrighted materials -- i.e., there needs to be legally-
admissible evidence that the material in question isn't, say, public-domain.
The proposal is that it'll be the defendant's job to prove that the person
who claims to be a copyright owner is lying, or that they have authorization.

Recommendation 9 (paragraphs 4.42 and 4.43) seem squarely aimed at the
Napsters of the world:  It'll be a criminal offence to advertise the
availability of unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.

Paragraph 4.44 begins a discussion of end-user piracy.  Currently it is
not a criminal offence to use an unauthorized copy of copyrighted software
(the copyright owner can sue you, but can't send you to jail).  The 
Committee sees it as desirable to change this, introducing provisions for
a criminal offence called "End-User Privacy."  This is the bit Glen
referred to above, where employers are held criminally responsible for
piracy by their employees (recommendation 10).

Chapters 4 and 5 also draw attention to the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act 1988 (UK), which create a civil power of search and siezure with respect
to copyright infringements.  This act permits the concept that someone like
Microsoft could obtain a search warrant to enter your premises and search
for illegal software.  Taking a power which has traditionally been reserved
for the police and making it available to private organizations who are 
motivated exclusively by profit and who have shown a history of, uh,
creative interpretations of laws strikes me as reckless in the extreme,
yet this something the committee is seriously considering.

 &gt; and I'm sure there is more.
 
Lots.

Sigh.
