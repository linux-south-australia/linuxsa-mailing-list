CSIRAC.  It's at the new museum in Melbourne.  It's the only intact
complete first-generation computer.  The others are either not intact
or have been rebuilt with modern components.  Because CSIRAC is a
original artifact there are no plans to add the modern components that
would be required to make it operational.  ABC's Quantum had a segment
in
1999; I wouldn't expect a follow-up :-)

On museums in general, I've seen a lot of proposals but none have got
up beyond simply piles of junk simply because curatorial expertise has
been lacking.

Rather than collect everything on one place, a more obtainable outcome
would simply be a national collection register and curatorial advice.
It might be worthwhile approaching the Powerhouse Museum to see if they
have a scheme.  That way, people could register that they have a Sun3
with complete manuals.  Institutions can then approach them for a loan
if
it is needed.  This is pretty much what the zoos do with their animals.

National Archives and the National Library may also be in a position
to assist: they are greatly concerned about the amount of computer-
readable content that are receiving and are aware of the need to also
preserve access to hardware to access this content in the future.

I'm too busy in the next few months to do anything about this.  If
someone is motivated, then contact me by mail and I'll arrange some
introductions to the Powerhouse, Archives and NLA.
