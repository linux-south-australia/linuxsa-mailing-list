Robyn!

&gt; I'm back, out of hospital and fighting fit (well almost).

Sorry to hear you were in hospital. I hope it was something you
volunteered for as opposed to a totally unexpected visit.

&gt; I'm installing Linux for him on the weekend and am asking for your help as to
&gt; what I need as far as libraries and programming environments for the above
&gt; languages.

Look for things called "development" and "java". RedHat and Mandrake
seem to divide their development packages into "core development" stuff
and "peripheral" development stuff. The "core" stuff you really need;
the "peripheral" stuff you may not need. "core" would be things like the
compiler, libraries that are almost always needed (eg standard input
output libraries, terminal control stuff etc) whilst "peripheral" is
like "xlib - the X libraries" and so forth.

&gt; I'm not sure whether to install RedHat 7 or Mandrake 7.2. I've not used
&gt; Mandrake before. I think I have the relevant drivers for his video card etc.

They both are, apparently, good although RedHat 7.0 has its own
peculiarities. I'm not sure which RedHat Mandrake 7.2 descends from.

&gt; After everything is set you should see us online sometime over the weekend.
