&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is much more expensive
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than in Australia.  Local calls, data or voice (at least they got that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bit right) cost $0.10 per 90 seconds.  Until a couple of years ago,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; German telecommunications looked like something out of the dark ages.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The symbol was a post horn with a flash around the handle.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing that a lot of people miss is the fact that Germany has a
&gt;&gt;&gt; population of something like 4 times that of Australia in an area
&gt;&gt;&gt; the size of Victoria. They don't have to run cables so far in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Germany.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That's not as significant as the amount of money they're roping in.
&gt;&gt; That would work here, too.
&gt;
&gt; Probably, but the cable cost would be much more here, but you do have a
&gt; valid point.

Cable's cheaper for ISDN.  You only need one wire (that's right, half
of a pair) per B channel (phone line).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyway despite the fact that this town is small, they have fully
&gt;&gt;&gt; fledged ISDN. My uncle has his entire house ISDNified. He runs it
&gt;&gt;&gt; all through his computer and can monitor or pickup any line in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; house.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, but that's a private PABX (pretty normal stuff in Germany).  How
&gt;&gt; much did he pay for it?
&gt;
&gt; I can't remember but it wasn't terribly expensive.

They're not overly expensive.  I paid DM 800 for my first one, DM 550
odd for the second.  At the time, the $ was about DM 1.30 (in fact, it
is again).  The cost of the box was almost completely offset by a
discount from Deutsche Telekom, and each box gave 8 internal lines and
controlled 2 B channels.  I was just wondering how the prices had
changed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; He can use 2 B Channels to access the internet through T-Online the
&gt;&gt;&gt; equivalent of BigPond here, ie. the biggest telco DeutscheTelecom's
&gt;&gt;&gt; Internet arm.  He gets charged roughly 1DM per 30minutes I
&gt;&gt;&gt; think. Thats using 128K.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If that's the case, prices have dropped rapidly.  But I suspect you're
&gt;&gt; talking about the access prices.  Even then, that's cheap for Germany.
&gt;&gt; The latest prices I have seen for Internet access in Germany are round
&gt;&gt; DM 0.049 per minute.  You used to have to add to that the cost of the
&gt;&gt; local call (DM 0.08 per minute), but I'm not sure they haven't made an
&gt;&gt; exception now.
&gt;
&gt; That is the price for the t-online connection not for the actual
&gt; call, however I seem to remember him saying something like it was a
&gt; local call and didnt cost much anyway.

He should make up his mind.  Look at the prices above.

&gt;&gt;&gt; My sister also lives in Germany and also has ISDN in her house. So
&gt;&gt;&gt; do about 20 other of my relatives in and around the same area, so
&gt;&gt;&gt; either my family is well developed and technofreaks!!!! or Germany
&gt;&gt;&gt; is just adopting ISDN and in this case a lot faster and cheaper than
&gt;&gt;&gt; Australia because mainly, they have more population per square KM
&gt;&gt;&gt; than Australia and thus the Telco's don't have to run cables so damn
&gt;&gt;&gt; far between cities.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Look at the prices I quoted at the top of the message (right, that's
&gt;&gt; me without the attribution).  Do you disagree with them?
&gt;
&gt; No I don't disagree with the fact that DeutscheTelecom is getting more money
&gt; from their customers because they have several million more but also it
&gt; costs them less to run the cables between cities, towns and villages than it
&gt; does in Australia.
&gt;
&gt; Hell the likelyhood of a town of 2000 getting ISDN in Australia is about as
&gt; likely as our petrol prices going back to 70c a litre before Christmas!!

I'll test that statement.  Echunga has a population of 436, and I'm
about to apply for an ISDN connect.
