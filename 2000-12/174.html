&gt; &gt; Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is cheaper than
&gt; &gt; analogue phone lines :)
&gt;
&gt;Remember that this is the same place where ISDN is much more expensive
&gt;than in Australia.  Local calls, data or voice (at least they got that
&gt;bit right) cost $0.10 per 90 seconds.  Until a couple of years ago,
&gt;German telecommunications looked like something out of the dark ages.
&gt;The symbol was a post horn with a flash around the handle.

One thing that a lot of people miss is the fact that Germany has a 
population of something like 4 times that of Australia in an area the size 
of Victoria. They don't have to run cables so far in Germany.

My fathers family lives in a small town near Trier in the former West 
Germany. The town only has a population of about 2000 and in Germany is 
termed a Village or "Dorf" thats where the name "Hahndorf" comes from. I 
think "Hahn" is a mayor or something like that (too lazy to look it up). 
Anyway despite the fact that this town is small, they have fully fledged 
ISDN. My uncle has his entire house ISDNified. He runs it all through his 
computer and can monitor or pickup any line in the house. He can use 2 B 
Channels to access the internet through T-Online the equivalent of BigPond 
here, ie. the biggest telco DeutscheTelecom's Internet arm.
He gets charged roughly 1DM per 30minutes I think. Thats using 128K.
My sister also lives in Germany and also has ISDN in her house. So do about 
20 other of my relatives in and around the same area, so either my family is 
well developed and technofreaks!!!! or Germany is just adopting ISDN and in 
this case a lot faster and cheaper than Australia because mainly, they have 
more population per square KM than Australia and thus the Telco's don't have 
to run cables so damn far between cities.

My 2.2 cents worth. (GST incl.)

Regards,

Michael
