&gt; I have recently acquired the download version of Linux Mandrake 7.2.  After using Diskdrake to partition the hard drive and assign mount points - packages are installed but I then receive an error suggesting that my CD installation disc could be corrupt as some important packages could not be installed and then on the next step the error 'hdlist not found' and I can not do much from there.  I suspect that 7.2 has been released prematurely from some reports that I have been getting from around the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any ideas - please let me know.

Best idea I can pass on is to buy the CDs from a reputable source rather
than spend the time dl-ing and building isofs etc etc. I buy mine from
Linux Systems labs in Melb via o/night delivery, maybe there are local
suppliers also.

I also read somewhere of various 'versions' of LM 7.2. Having checked
the CDs I bought against the 'official current' LM 7.2, I can attest
that they are not e pre-release. The genuine LM7.2 actually does install
and load and run quite well FWIW :).

If cost is a huge hurdle and you don't want to spend a whole $15.00 on
your own set, you can borrow mine for free. Email me off list if
necessary.
