&gt; Please Brian, we need help -- not people that wish to score debating
&gt; points.  If you don't want to help, then don't hassle those that are.

At least Mark had the good grace to post the comment to which I was reacting in
his reply.  You remark is not justified.

Regarding help, I would be very pleased to help in any way I can.  Our current
Federal government is not know for its moderate and sound response to a
situation - eg the absurd gun buy-back scheme (how the PM could congratulate
our Shotgun Gold Medallist when he has done so much to make entry to the sport
difficult is beyond me).

I think Mark's fears are sound, but need to be expressed in a way which cannot
be seen as an emotional reaction.  We also, in my view, need to adopt a
pro-protecting-intellectual-property stance if at all possible.
