New APC Linux Pocket Book available at decent newsagents for $20, has
Mandrake 7.2 and RH 7.0. Plus Win4lin with an extended trial period,
VMWare, and that GPLed one.

I almost sound like an add.. BTW Geoffrey Bennett makes an apearence on
it.

mdk.

&gt; &gt; I have recently acquired the download version of Linux Mandrake 7.2.  After using Diskdrake to partition the hard drive and assign mount points - packages are installed but I then receive an error suggesting that my CD installation disc could be corrupt as some important packages could not be installed and then on the next step the error 'hdlist not found' and I can not do much from there.  I suspect that 7.2 has been released prematurely from some reports that I have been getting from around the Internet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone has any ideas - please let me know.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Best idea I can pass on is to buy the CDs from a reputable source rather
&gt; than spend the time dl-ing and building isofs etc etc. I buy mine from
&gt; Linux Systems labs in Melb via o/night delivery, maybe there are local
&gt; suppliers also.
&gt; 
&gt; I also read somewhere of various 'versions' of LM 7.2. Having checked
&gt; the CDs I bought against the 'official current' LM 7.2, I can attest
&gt; that they are not e pre-release. The genuine LM7.2 actually does install
&gt; and load and run quite well FWIW :).
&gt; 
&gt; If cost is a huge hurdle and you don't want to spend a whole $15.00 on
&gt; your own set, you can borrow mine for free. Email me off list if
&gt; necessary.
