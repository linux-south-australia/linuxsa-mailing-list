&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This would be very handy if you are away from home and you want to
&gt; &gt; have access to your machine over the internet.  You just "ring up your
&gt; &gt; computer" and tell it to start ppp.  It doesn't even have to answer
&gt; &gt; the phone to get the message so it doesn't cost a phone call!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The question is, how to do it?
&gt; 
&gt; The question also is, once it is connected, how will you reach it, you
&gt; won't know its IP, unless it has a static IP, in which case, why not have
&gt; it dialled al the time ?


did anyone ever use ozemail, back when it still was ozemail? When you
dialed up, your IP address was linked to your account name, so if I had
an account jbloggs, then my address would

jbloggs.oemail.com.au -&gt; &lt;some ip address&gt;

this was cool, because, well its obvious isn't it :)
