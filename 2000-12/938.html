&gt; That's the problem: it wouldn't be "mini" for long. I know that there are
&gt; enough people around Adelaide with various models of old computers that a
&gt; warehouse would be required very quickly.
&gt;
&gt; People who want to do this sort of thing can get grants from the
&gt; government to help if they put in time, I believe. I also think that there
&gt; is a very large amount of raw material in Adelaide to work with and that
&gt; it would be good if someone (ie, not me) did something about it.

IMHO, this is being approached from the wrong end... the quantity of gear in
Adelaide is nt really relevant. What is relevant is what sort of a museum
(and what size of a museum) would be interesting and worthwhile to create.
Just because someone has an old Apple ][ that they like but have no use for,
doens't mean that it needs to go into a museum. If a museum were to be
created (and I am still unconvinced of the need for one), it would have to
have only signifigant models in there... No point in showing the evolution
of the Sun range... In reality, it would only need to have 20 or so
computers in it. If it got to 50, it would be too big. Also, I think that to
make it worthwhile (ceertainly, to get any money from the government), one
would have to focus on signifigant events, people and computers in Adelaide.

My suggestion for someone who may want to do this: find out about the
history of computing in Adelaide, and dig up the relelvant old people and
computers, and see what you find. Don't bother with a random Sun 3, unless
it's "just like the one that so and so used to do blah in 1973" or
something. It would have to be focussed around interesting events in the
development of the CS and EE departments of Unis and TAFEs (and schools), as
well as the development of industry...

This could, in fact, make a good research project for someone -- perhaps
honours...
