Mike!

&gt; Any ideas ?

It's odd to say the least. It implies that the tcpdump you're using has
been linked against another shared object and the memory sizes are
different. This could be because:

* you installed a binary tcpdump that is just ever so slightly out of
sync with your system
* someone else installed a binary tcpdump behind your back [1]
* you installed other libraries which have this incompatibility
* someone else did [2]

[1]
Possible...check your firewall logs and other things. I wouldn't be
panicking quite yet though.

[2]
Possible...see above.

The solution would be to get a trusted binary and install it again and
see what it does; or alternatively get a source distribution and rebuild
it. However, if someone has trojaned one or more of your shared
libraries this might not be the best solution. Can you think of anything
you've done (no matter how slight it seemed at the time) that might have
changed this...
