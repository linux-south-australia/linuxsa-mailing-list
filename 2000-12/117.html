Not. The 286 couldn't do multitasking. The 386 introduced protected-mode
which ushered in the multitasking OS like Windows and Linux. Windows 2.0 on
the 286 was really the old DOS Shell program, a simple ASCII drawn file
manager that was dumped from memory when another program was started. Yuck!

Subject: introduction


&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I've just subscribed to the list, and thought i'd introduce myself, so
&gt; here's a brief
&gt; introduction!
&gt; 
&gt; My name is Alastair, I'm a pom and have been in Adelaide, Australia for 6
&gt; months now. I'm a 
&gt; contract web developer, and currently use MS tools. Having been rather
&gt; annoyed
&gt; at MS products, particularly over the last couple of months, I'm looking
at
&gt; learning
&gt; and developing sites using open source tools, PHP, mySQL etc. etc. I first
&gt; used
&gt; linux in about 91/92 when it was first released, on my old 286, but
haven't
&gt; really
&gt; look at it since then. Linux certainly seems to have come along and before
&gt; it's
&gt; too late, I'm going to get back into it! Anyway, I'll finish here for now,
&gt; I'll probably
&gt; lurk for a while until I start my linux installation
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers!
&gt; 
&gt; alastair

&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; &gt; with the fact that a functioning open source project involves much more
&gt; &gt; than the code being available. An open source project involves a
&gt; &gt; cooperating community.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I think that many of the distributions would argue that they have
&gt; a cooperating community of users.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't regard the Debian distribution as the same thing as the Debian
&gt; &gt; collection of packages, even though nearly 100% of it by volume is the
&gt; &gt; Debian collection of packages.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Debian distribution consists of several items including packages, an
&gt; &gt; installer, a manifesto cum philophopy cum political statement, docs
&gt; &gt; specific to Debian and a few other things. One portion of this
&gt; &gt; distribution is in itself an entire open source project, package
&gt; &gt; management. Package management is done in an open source manner by a
&gt; &gt; cooperating community.
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst I agree that the package management is done in a much more open
&gt; manner in Debian than other distributions, with the exception of
&gt; proprietary packages that some distributions include, the
&gt; distributions include corresponding source packages for all the binary
&gt; packages. Although they often don't include the entire build
&gt; environment, its not difficult to put together a few scripts to
&gt; rebuild the distribution from source (I've done this myself for a few
&gt; distributions now).
&gt; 
&gt; The development model from many commercial Linux distributions are in
&gt; `ESR-speak'[1] Cathederalistic whilst Debian is more Bazaar-like, but
&gt; I think its incorrect to say that they aren't Open Source projects
&gt; (excluding those that have proprietary bits).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone is free (and has the tools available) to fix/develop packages
&gt; and send the patches to the package maintainers (their email addresses
&gt; are listed in the source packages). I'm pretty sure an overworked
&gt; package maintainer would quite happily apply good
&gt; patches/enhancements. I definitely like it when other people do my
&gt; work for me :-) 
&gt; 
&gt; Just because not everyone can get `check-in' permissions doesn't mean
&gt; that its not an open source project. Many open source projects
&gt; restrict the number of people who can actually commit to the source
&gt; tree but still accept patches for many others. To get a package into
&gt; the Debian distribution you need to be a member of the `Debian entity'
&gt; (which is becoming a longer process) or get a Debian member to sponsor
&gt; you.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Control of an RPM package is done by someone who has a salary, a boss, a
&gt; &gt; deadline and maybe forty or more other packages. This does not produce
as
&gt; &gt; good a result as giving control of a package to an open source team who
&gt; &gt; keep working until it is finished.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that packages are normally maintained by a single person, but
&gt; I agree its better to have someone packaging the program who wants it
&gt; and actually uses it. That being said, there have been problems where
&gt; people no longer use a package or lose interest in maintaining it but
&gt; fail (or sometimes refuse) to hand over it to someone else.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; maintainers of the actual programs to a greater extent. Default config
&gt; &gt; files and permissions for example are made to suit both parties, the
&gt; &gt; Debian packagers (who abide by a set of policies) and the original
author
&gt; &gt; (who could well have written the package for an OS quite unlike Linux.)
A
&gt; 
&gt; Default configuration files and permissions should be set to suit the
&gt; requirements of the _users_ of the distribution, not the package
&gt; maintainers or upstream.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; busy RPM package maintainer simply hasn't got time to talk to all the
&gt; &gt; authors and teams of all the packages involved. A Debian package
&gt; &gt; maintainer, on the other hand, often has people submitting patches to
&gt; &gt; packages and is contributing effort on a volunteer basis.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is the reasoning that leads me to conclude that:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    1) A collection of well-maintained packages is the most important
thing
&gt; &gt;       for a sound server distribution
&gt; &gt;    2) Open source package management works better. As it happens, in
Linux
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;       Debian is the only mass example of open source package management
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst I agree that the commercial distributions would gain by opening
&gt; up their distribution development more. I don't think that a single
&gt; distribution is going to be the best distribution for everyone. There
&gt; are niche distributions out there that are a better fit for people
&gt; with specific requirements, even if they are developed in a more
&gt; closed manner.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    3) Regardless of the relative merits of rpm and dpkg, open source
&gt; &gt;       package management is the most important thing. If the rpm and
dpkg
&gt; &gt;       technologies were suddenly exchanged overnight I would still
prefer
&gt; &gt;       the open source package repository since would likely still be of
a 
&gt; &gt;       better quality.
&gt; 
&gt; Only if it has apt. I can't live without apt anymore :-) 
&gt; 
&gt; Chris.
