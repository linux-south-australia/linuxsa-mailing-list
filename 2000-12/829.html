Hello folks,

Today I installed Conectiva Linux 6.0 on my machine here at home, and I
would like to share my impressions of this distribution.

The install was of a very high standard - it included what we've come to
expect from the recent releases of distributions.  It has both X (gtk+)
and text based installations.  Partitioner, then selection of an
installation type, and then if one wishes, further package group and then
individual package selection.  Adequate context help was provided by an
auto-hidden tab.  The install was quite pleasing on the eye too, with
several 'slides'giving the keen user an overview of some of the features
of the system.

One of the main reasons that persuaded me to move back to an RPM-based
distribution (from Slackware) was the integration of APT (Advanced Package
Tool).  Conectiva have written an RPM backend for this tool, enabling one
of Debian's most useful features to be used with an RPM-based distro
(presently only Conectiva).  For those who don't know, apt handles
dependancy management, downloading (from CD, HTTP or FTP source) and
installing the packages, removing them, as well as verifying their
checksums against a GnuPG signature.  This makes system maintenance
extremely easy (really folks, this is bordering on hedonism!), and makes
the Red Hat Network look silly.  This evening I am performing an apt-get
dist-upgrade (albeit rather slowly), and so far it is working like a
charm.

In terms of programs and technologies, Conective 6.0 is very current.  It
support Reiser-FS, Logical Volume Management in the included 2.2.17 kernel
(extra kernels are included for SMP and enterprise systems etc).  It uses
XFree86-4.0.1 (3.3.6 is in the extras CD), and includes KDE 2.0 (2.0.1
sitting in updates), GNOME 1.2, OpenSSL (plus a thing called FreeS/WAN
that I know nothing about), and lots more... I suggest you take a look at
their FTP site for the full listing of packages
(ftp.conectiva.com/pub/conectiva/6.0).

Security-wise, the distribution seems very good.  There is a 'server'
install that I haven't tried, but the workstation system seems very tight.
Most services that can be started at boot-time will put there scripts into
/etc/init.d, but leave alone the rcX.d directories, so the user must
enable these services themself, because very little is enabled by default.
Also, if you check Linuxtoday or BugTraq or something of the like, you'll
notice that Conectiva often beats the other distros to security updates,
leaving the others to trail in your apt-getting dust =)

Conectiva is a Brazilian distribuation, but it is trilingual (Portuguese,
Spanish, English), and I have found no problems using it in English.  More
information can be found out at <A HREF="http://en.coneciva.com">http://en.coneciva.com</A> or
<A HREF="http://http://distro.conectiva.com.br/prefs.html?url">http://http://distro.conectiva.com.br/prefs.html?url</A>=/&ck=idioma&ckval=en
.

In short, one could describe Conectiva 6.0 as Debian without the hassle,
Madrake without the messiness, and Red Hat without gcc-2.96 :)  I have
found it to be a very polished distribution.

Now here comes the good news - speaking to one of Conectiva's employees
today, he said that he would most probably be able to send down some CDs
for the LinuxSA'ers to try out.  So, when they arrive, I'll send another
message and bring them along to the next meeting for hand out.

Cheers,

Tim Riley
