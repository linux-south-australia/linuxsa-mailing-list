&gt; No that makes it not network, not datalink, not mac sublayer and not
&gt; physical.
&gt;
&gt; It doenst mean it is transport, there are four other layers you can
&gt; choose above transport in the the OSI mdoel an 2 you can choose in the
&gt; TCP/IP model that are about network layer.
&gt;
&gt; Just because it is above layer 3 doesnt mean it is layer 4.

true. But it is also clearly not application, not presentation and not
session. :)

interestingly, the RFC referenced earlier says:

   "ICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher
   level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP, and
   must be implemented by every IP module."

The best thing that has been said so far was someone who said earlier that
TCP/IP does _not_ fit into the ISO's OSI 7 layer model. This is pretty much
universally agreed on. TCP/IP gets described as anything from 3 to 5 layers,
and these layers do _not_ neatly fit into the OSI model. As Glen said, ICMP
does Network Layer type things, but is carried on a Network Layer Protocol
(IP).

Anyway, the original question is answered, and clarified below, using ASCII
art (why? because I can, and it's great for procrastinatory purposes):


an IP Packet (X means "stuff that isn't presently relevant", and each
tab-stop is four bits:

Bits:
0								31
|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|

-------------------------------------------------
|  X	|  X	|	X	|		X		|
-------------------------------------------------
|		X		|  X	|	  X		|
-------------------------------------------------
|  X	|  X	|  Protocol	|		X		|
-------------------------------------------------
|			Source Address			|
-------------------------------------------------
|			 Dest Address			|
-------------------------------------------------
|			X			|	X	|
-------------------------------------------------
|	Data...						|
:								:
-------------------------------------------------

Notes:

Protocol -- This is a number that is found in /etc/protocols. If the data
section is TCP, then this number is 6, if it's ICMP, it's 1, and there are
others...

Source and Destination Addresses -- These are IP addresses. Note that there
are no ports.

Data -- the contents of the IP packet, interpreted using the number in the
Protocol part of the IP header.


Now, a UDP packet is carried entirely within the data section of an IP
packet, looks like this:



-------------------------------------------------
|  Src Port	| Dest Port	|	X	|	X	|
-------------------------------------------------
|	Data....						|
:								:
-------------------------------------------------

TCP is similar, but has more stuff in it after the ports. Note that the
Source and Destination ports are defined here (same in both UDP and TCP).


An ICMP packet, which is also carried entirely within the data section of an
IP packet, looks like this:

-------------------------------------------------
|   Type	|   Code	|	  Checksum		|
-------------------------------------------------
| Stuff depending on Type of the ICMP packet    |
:								:
-------------------------------------------------

As you can see... no ports.

That is all. Hope you enjoy reading this ASCII art as much as I enjoyed
creating it -- and I did enjoy creating it :)
