&gt;Actually, Dingoblue is good, I left internode, because of the limit on
hours and
&gt;small web-page space limits and the cost of maintaining the domain name
with
&gt;them. Overall I found them to be un-competitive, however, I had and still
have
&gt;nothing but praise for their service and speed. I will certainly look
carefully
&gt;at their DSL offerings when it arrives, but based on previous experience
I'm not
&gt;sure if they will be equal to other providers on cost.

It depends who you mean when you say "other providers". Dingo blue has
always had an unsustainable pricing structure for Internet, especially for
their more remote areas. Fortunately for Optus who provided the network for
them, this massive loss paid off when they sold Dingo Blue to AGL.

Optus cannot indefinately give Dingo Blue customers a free ride now that
they don't own it anymore, and sooner or later, AGL shareholders are going
to notice that the Internet business is losing money for no good reason.
They will either have to raise prices, reduce service levels or even
introduce download limits .. the horror. I suppose it's also possible that
AGL paid millions so they could discover the secret of remaining
cashflow-postitive whilst delivering 5Gb for $27 each month..

Internode, on the other hand, actually makes a profit and employs people in
Adelaide without using anyone else's money.

If you don't care where the service comes from, and price is the only
important thing you might want to ask someone who pre-paid for 12 months on
EISA about how clever it is to use an obviously-losing-money ISP.
