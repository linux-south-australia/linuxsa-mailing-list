On the basis of 'competance', a prospective employer would be well 
advised to check a persons' motivation for doing a 'formal' course as 
opposed to 'self taught'.

The person who is self taught and doing it well has greater motivation 
than a 'formally' trained person who 'got through'.  The self taught may 
also demonstrate better abilities and problem solving purely based on 
their own errors at the time of 'trying' out the adminstration of a system.

I think that too much emphasis is placed on formal quals, which points 
the to employer thinking the 'formal course' relinquishes them of any 
internal training.  I can save this company $$$ by choosing the best 
trained people... NOT!!

cheers big ears :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; It always amazes me how many people generalise how they learn and expect the

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  As linux people you above all should know
&gt;&gt;&gt; the value of choice, freedom and individual preferences.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no absolute right and wrong here, there is just choice and
&gt;&gt;&gt; preferential learning style.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think you have missed the point here Steve.  The original theme concerned
&gt;&gt; whether a person could be a better sysadmin with or without formal training,
&gt;&gt; and whether employers might be well advised to choose the unqualified person.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; IF the only person who could possibly suffer from your ignorance is you, then
&gt;&gt; sure - learn any way you like.  However, a sysadmin can do serious damage to
&gt;&gt; their employer and the jobs that employer offers.  In that case, qualifications
&gt;&gt; which ensure minimal damage being done would seem an essential first
&gt;&gt; requirement for the employers choice of sysadmin.  Obviously,
&gt;&gt; successful experience is an additional attraction.
&gt;&gt; So sorry, Steve, there IS an "absolute right and wrong here".
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting, but not accurate. I would not conclude that a person is ignorant
&gt; because they did not receive formal training, although I'm sure this was not the
&gt; way you meant for me to take it. :-)
&gt; Measurement of competence of one's capability is not measured by the paperwork they
&gt; have acquired, it is measured on "can they do the job"  So, can a person be a
&gt; better sys-admin without formal training, I see no reason why not, indeed those
&gt; very same people who have learned without formal training can and do a first rate
&gt; job.  As for qualifications, qualifications provide a "measure of assurance" that
&gt; you will not damage the system, not ensure it. In one of my earlier posts you will
&gt; see that I did indeed state that qualifications were a confidence providing support
&gt; to employers who did not know you, and could not be reasonably expected to just
&gt; take your word for it.
&gt; 
&gt; That's why educational institutes have recognition of current competencies (RCC)
&gt; and recognition of prior learning (RPL), to address the very real issue of people
&gt; who can do the job, are doing the job, and have learned in an informal and or  in a
&gt; non structured manner.
&gt; 
&gt; At the end of the day, I would say that it is the employers responsibility to
&gt; decide who is competent and who is not, proper assessment by the employer should
&gt; ultimately be the deciding factor.
&gt; 
&gt; :-)
