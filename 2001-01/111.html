&gt; and "will" were injudicious.  Let's keep some perspective here, and remember
&gt; that the members of the CPRM committee can't even agree on it yet, so it's
&gt; a bit premature to talk about devices where it's going to compulsorily 
&gt; appear.

Hey, if any proposal by any group or company, might infringe on the freedoms I
experience as an open-source consumer, then I think it's worth contemplating
here on the LinuxSA mailing list.  If I can't blow things out of proportion
here, where can I? :)

If the proposal isn't adopted in anything like what has been reported then
nothing is lost and we've benefited from a lively discussion.  

And I refuse to defend my lack of ability to formulate a logical and reasoned
argument as well!  Ha! :-)

[snip]

&gt; Throughout this controversy, am I the only one who has wondered why The
&gt; Register has been the only media outlet who has done any research into
&gt; this story?  Other agencies have carried brief three-paragraph stories, 
&gt; but they've all quoted The Register as a source -- Nobody else has asked
&gt; any questions, or claimed to be delivering any answers.  Surely if it's
&gt; that big and important there'd be interest from elsewhere, yes?  Because
&gt; until that happens, The Register is making all kinds of accusations in 
&gt; an environment which features *no* corroborating voices.

It has been all a bit strange.  For something that would be a big deal if it
happenned I would've thought there would be more coverage.  In addition, the
supposed opposition to the plan by the GiantInRedmond would've been newsworthy
in it's own right by those who hang off little Billy's every word.  So the lack
of corroborating evidence is unusual...

&gt; Personally, I'd place far more credibility in the RISKS forum digest, which
&gt; is edited to a high standard (and which has exhibited consistently high
&gt; quality for as long as I can remember), than I'd place in The Register (an
&gt; online publication which I'd totally ignore if not for the fact that Alan
&gt; K. keeps posting URLs from it).  

And I'd agree, except that news from a mailing list quoting an Intel mail
address regarding what Intel's plans really were (in response to negative press)
might not be all that credible either.  But I don't subscribe to that list, so
your guess is better than mine.

I really do hope it all is just hyperbole.
