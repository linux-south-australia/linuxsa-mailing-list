&gt;See... Here another rule... It is from your list. You don't care much for
&gt;your personal system as for vital systems.
&gt;
&gt;I think here alot of people on this list who have rules similar to this. So
&gt;if everyone will post his rules we can compile law of linux security! :)

I think it would be a good idea for LinuxSA to compile a list of recommended 
security techniques. They could be broken up into say:
-Mandatory (ie. a must)
-Highly Recommended (ie. if you want really good security, not a must but 
should be definately considered)
-Suggested (ie. if you have a bit of spare time, why not)
-Not really important but could help nevertheless (if you are really 
paranoid)

Maybe someone could set up a php3 form on the linuxsa site to take 
submissions and people could submit them, so that they get loaded into a DB 
then a few people could go through and classify them and sort them out, then 
publish them on a webpage. I am willing to help with the Webpage bit. 
Admittedly I use Micro$oft FrontPage but I can still KISS*

* Keep It Simple Stupid

Well I am not doing too bad with my box anyway I am still relatively a so 
called newbie but no one has managed to get into my box so far. (touch 
wood). That doesn't mean that you people can go out and try!!! the few of 
you that actually know my domain name and server anyway!!

Regards,

Michael
