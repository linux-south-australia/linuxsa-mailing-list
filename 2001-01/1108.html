&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been running the new 2.4.0 kernal version for a couple of weeks now (the final version, not a pretest version), and I've just decided to try and get some of my internal devices on my laptop to work. One of which is the CardBus Xircom modem, which from my reading it seems that it is supported by the newer version of pcmcia-cs.
&gt; 
&gt; I downloaded the source for pcmcia-cs-3.1.24 and had no problems with the configure script. The compile seemed to proceed ok, but when it did the depmod stage, it complained about a lot of unresolved symbols. 'make install' did not give any errors at all. The PCMCIA-HOWTO isn't terrably helpful, it says to rebuild the pcmcia package from scratch, which is what I'm trying to do in the first place!
&gt; 
&gt; System summary is:
&gt; NEC Versa LXi, 128Mb RAM, PIII-500, Mandrake 7.2 (pretty much standard except for the kernal update), pcmcia-cs-3.1.24 source
&gt; The device I am trying to get going is a Xircom modem that is part of an internal card, which also includes a network card (the network card is an Intel Pro/100 and works fine)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone managed to get this going and can give me some pointers?
&gt; 


I have kernel 2.2.18 and pcmcia 3.1.22 and is was flawless. I remember
seeing something about pcmcia-cs and kernel 2.4.  

Wasn't pcmcia supposed to be integrated into the kernel at some point?
