&gt; &gt;Are we talkgn about computing here ot the use of computers in schools

&gt; &gt;Especially if you think that they might also want to prepare kids for what
&gt; &gt;they will find in the real world one day. These days what most people find
&gt; &gt;on real world PCs is word/excel/windows.
&gt; 
&gt; We must work to disabuse teachers of this falacy. Computing changes every
&gt; few years. Anyone in year 8 today, being taught to use the current crop of
&gt; Microsoft progucts will face a very different environment when they finish
&gt; year 12.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, using StarOffice, for example, will give them much lower cost
&gt; of ownership access to similar tools.

Actually they currently get all teh MS upgrades for "free"(well at no
direct cost to the school).
In addition I think the teachers are allowed to use copies at home.

So the tco is not likely to be lower, I would suggest probably higher due
to higher support costs.

In addition it is quite possible that a kid who uses workd 98 this year
will use word 2o00 nexct year.

&gt; We must point out to them the falacy of the above argument and that open
&gt; source software will drive their dollar further and allow them to achieve
&gt; better results.
&gt; 
&gt; I sometimes wonder if the Independent Schools Association might not be a
&gt; better target?
&gt; 


Possibly they might not be covered under he all encompassing agreement
that I believe are in place with state schools.


I donthink making a representationis a bd thing.
I dont hink opensource software cnat be useful in schools.
I do think that ove the short to medium term it can not reaplce all closed
source software and I dont beleive that their is suitable open source
software of sufficient quality currenlty availalbe for most geenral
computing needs in most schools.


I also dont think that anything much will happen over the next few years,
possibly decade.

I think open source software needs to be more widely accepted aeverywhere
else throughout the community before it can and willbe widely accepted in
most k-7 schools, and probably in most k-12 schools.
