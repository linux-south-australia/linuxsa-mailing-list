&gt;That's good. At the client end (or at the office router end) will you also
&gt;be permitting some kind of PCI card solution, much like Traverse only for
&gt;ADSL not ISDN?

Yes. The complicating factor is not technical, it's making a clean 
pricing model in terms of what this does to the install costs. We 
have been sampling both PCI and USB based DSL 'modems' in addition to 
desktop ethernet-port delivery devices.

&gt;I take it is this just plain trunk bandwidth, ie there is no
&gt;differentiation on which direction bytes are going? I notice you haven't
&gt;constrained bytes going upstream and that you permit servers. What happens
&gt;if I start serving a copy of mirror.aarnet to anyone who wants it?

If you start mirroring such a thing you'll flood your 256k of 
back-channel rate very quickly and get very bored trying to surf in 
the forward channel direction. If you insist, you're welcome. Because 
of the constrained backchannel rate on ADSL in general I don't see 
this as a problem (yet).

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Do please let this list know the instant you can justify repricing an
&gt;Agile wireless connection to compete with ADSL. I'm sure many here would
&gt;be most interested but the current spread spectrum installation fee is
&gt;something like 40 times that of ADSL, isn't it? Maybe I misunderstood this
&gt;comment.

We loose money on the ADSL install fee as it stands today - we don't 
loose money on wireless installs today.

Yes, current wireless link install fee is $8800 (inc) but calling 
this 40x the ADSL install fee is both mathematically incorrect and a 
somewhat unfair treatment of the cost differential (ratios aren't 
really a good way to compare these).

This isn't the same as DSL - its faster, its symmetric, and generally 
we're selling it to people who want a leased data service with a QoS 
statement attached, and who don't want to tolerate the 
'oversubscription' rates that need to be applied in ADSL.

I'm mulling over a middle ground which I might call 'wireless ADSL' 
with a lower installation fee and a different QoS to the Agile 
wireless derived service. Its complicated by various issues and they 
aren't trivial - but it's 'on the list', yes.
