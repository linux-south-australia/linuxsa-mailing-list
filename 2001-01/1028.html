&gt; Hiya list,
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a job coming up in a couple of months where I'll be in Europe
&gt; for 7 or 8 weeks, but will be in a different town each day, and in any
&gt; one country for only a couple of consecutive days. I'm trying to find
&gt; the best solution for being able to connect to the net while I'm there
&gt; that won't cost me all of my earnings. Hotel phone costs can be quite
&gt; daunting - in the past I've come across charges that are more than 4X
&gt; the normal rate - so toll free connections would be most desirable
&gt; (though some hotels even charge for these)
&gt; 
&gt; I've had a brief look at using GRIC through Internode but at $6.60/hour
&gt; before phone costs I was hoping some of you jet-setters may have a
&gt; better solution. The astronomical number of ISPs in Europe makes it
&gt; difficult to look into them all - I'd still be going through the A's by
&gt; the time I left!
&gt; 
&gt; Hope someone can help?


AT&T worldnet. I use it in Canada and Latin America and places in
between. I have no idea how much it costs, but there is a local (and
sometimes toll-free) number in I think every country and sometimes every
city in the world.
