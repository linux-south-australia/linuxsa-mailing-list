If you can cope without access at night, the best solution I've found is
knowing the free software communities in each country. They always seem to
be able to come up with a solution. I can generally plug into a
decent-speed ethernet at an office in most countries in the West, and
although I haven't travelled much in the East recently there always seemss
to be people offering to help with modem access. Good manners dictates
quid pro quo, so try to solve some problem or present new technology or
something at each stop.

&gt; The language barrier can be a little tricky sometimes, but I'm sure
&gt; you'll get by.

Most people can learn enough to be useful in a fortnight. That's a month
in total for any two of German/French/Spanish, which should be enough to
very significantly help. Coming from Australia seems to help quite a bit
too, my theory being that Australia is too insignificant to have created
much in the way of negative images :-) The main thing is to realise that
there are hundreds of millions of multilingual people in the world who
don't speak English and don't have a desire to do so. Plenty of IT
professionals seem to have this outlook as well.
