A few quick questions...

looking for a cheap PC for my computer-illiterate dad, that he can use to
run Windows, and I can have a partition with a real OS on it for when I'm up
there... (and for when Linux takes of the world and dad wants to use it!)

So I'm looking at the ads etc, and I see a whole lot of stuff that I don't
really know anything about, and certainly have no idea if they work under
Linux...

1. integrated chipsets.
a) Graphics power is not important here, but I'd like them to run X. Can
these new integrated chipsets do this?
b) sound -- ditto
c) network -- ditto
d) etc -- ditto
basically, given that he wants to run word and IE, and I may want to run
linux with X, will we have any major compatibility issues? will they get
solved, or are there IP issues with them?

2. Modem. He'll need one, and I'd like to get him an internal one. Was there
a conclusion to the PCI modem discussion? many integrated chipsets don't
have ISA, so "hmmm...". Also, what is this AMR thing, and will it work with
Linux, and do AMR modem cards exist anywhere (I have seen none), and do they
work etc?

3. Backup. one of the reasons that he's getting a new computer is that I
have convinced him that his 5 year old p90 is going to die, and he will lose
all his stuff, as will my mum, and my sister. What's an intelligent, cheap,
easy-to-use backup system for Win98/ME/Linux. I'm asking mainly about
hardwrae here. His computer will be networked to my brother's (at least for
a while) so I could set them up to duplicate their data directories over the
network, but... hmmm.. any comments?

4. Does anyone have any specific recommendations for a particular mobo or
dealer? I want to get a well-built system for him, as I don't have the time
to fix it, and he doesn' thave the skills.

5. Finally: What's a Northbridge? What's a Southbridge? :) -- (Toms Hardware
just answered this question reasonably well for me --
