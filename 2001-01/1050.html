Simon has a good point here. While I can understand that people
occasionally will feel a little nervous about committing to a 12 month
(or more) contract with a 'newer' or "small" telco (and I'm not sure
that Agile is necessarily that "small" :-), I think that's just a risk
that they are going to have to take.

After all, us newer telcos are often taking a similar risk with the
outlay for installations - if the client defaults, we'll be left wearing
the cost (and hoping that the next client at the install site wants to
buy our service....)

And without meaning this in a rude way, if people feel that the 'risk'
of being with one of these telcos is not worth while, then there are
several larger telcos that will be happy to provide a much more
expensive solution :-)

Cheers,
