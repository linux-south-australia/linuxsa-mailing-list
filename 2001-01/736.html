&gt; As the subject states, i'd like to raise the whole topic of linux as a
&gt; workstation/client, as i would love to be using linux as a workstation.
&gt; Although i simply dont think its user friendly enough to be using it as a
&gt; workstation for one. The second reason i cant use it as a workstation is
&gt; because the software needed daily on my machine i cant find for Linux.
This
&gt; would be advanced HTML editors, graphics editors for web graphics, and so
&gt; on. The software i need has been made for the windows OS, as nearly
everyone
&gt; in this world today is out to make some $$$, they would be stupid to write
a
&gt; program for another OS if they wanted to make some serious cash.

You need some source of free programs which you can use everyday? Try
www.linuxberg.com or linux.davecentral.com . There alot of different
programs which you can find useful. Anyway feel free to ask: "Do you know
such program which doin'... ?" This way you can build the system which will
satisfy all of your needs.

&gt; Why has microsoft succeeded in having their OS on 80% of machines
worldwide?

As survey of 2000 states: only 49%

&gt; 1) because their OS complies to what the users want, and gives you nothing
&gt; else - its simple

That's right... But Linux give you the power... You can be in control of
computer and it will do what you want - not what system itself want to do.

&gt; 2) because its user friendly

IMHO: GNOME is user friendly too

&gt; 3) because mr gates was around at a good time to write an OS for IBM

No one knows when it is "good time"

You tried to compare Windows and Linux - I think that it's different systems
with different purposes.

What Windows is: It's the beautiful Boing-747. People in nice clothes
boarding it. Then it makes its airborne and after few minutes explodes in
the air.
What Linux is: alot of people in dirt and oily clothes come to runway and
start assembling something which looks like a plane. After this one is
completed it get the airborne and then fly away behind horizon.
