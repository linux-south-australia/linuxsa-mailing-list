&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; At one of my sites we are experiencing problems with Travan style tape
&gt; drives ...
&gt;
&gt; We use them every day with Amanda, and we have seen two Travan drives give
&gt; up in the last two months.
&gt;
&gt; We are considering a move to DAT or DLT.  DLT is more expensive than DAT,
&gt; but has twice the capacity: 40GB uncompressed vs 20GB uncompressed (DDS4),
&gt; but is somewhat more expensive (not quite twice ...).
&gt;
&gt; What have been the experiences with these devices out there, especially
&gt; where they are used (written to) each day?

I've found DDS hardware to be very short-lived.  I bought a job lot of
3 DDS-2 drives in America about a year ago (USD $70 each), and one is
already dead (you can have it and play around if you want; maybe some
serious head cleaning would help).  I think the DDS drives are
becoming more reliable with increasing version number, though: the
DDS(-1) drives I had years ago lasted less than 6 months.  I also have
a DDS-4 drive here which is 8 months old and hasn't died yet.

I also have a refurbished Quantum DLT-4000 (20 GB native).  It hasn't
died either, but I haven't used it as much.

In general, I'm very mistrustful of any kind of tape drive.  From what
I've heard, DLT has the best reputation for reliability.
