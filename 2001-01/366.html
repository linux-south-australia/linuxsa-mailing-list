David & All,
i am 19, and i have setup many linux machines from 486's to my laptop and i
believe i have a good grasp of the install process. i have been through the kernel
panics and recompiles associatedwith it.
many a time i have re-installed because i felt like playing with partitions
etc.
i have many books, from programming to idiots guides to some of the unleashed
books, to web-design and php.
i am currently implimenting my home page in php4 & mysql, and also building my
own gateway/webserver/firewall connected to a Linux/Windows 10baset network. i
have worked in web design places, but i really want to be a sysadmin which needs
a piece of paper!!i believe i have as much skill and experience as many of you
do (perhaps not the sysadmin types, of course), but only having that certificate
under your arm proves that.
i can do all of the common tasks, but until i have that certificate, no go!
i have intentionally bought & setup network equipment, set up samba, php4 and
mysql'd my web site, killed 486's celerons and the like, all in the name of
learning. TAFE is shit house, i have leart 100 times more stuff tinkering with and
killing my network, breaking programs at home that TAFE could have taught me!
i hardly use samba, but i can say i have set it up, and know how to use and
administer it. this is the reason why!!

anyway, my two cents worth, why the current education system sucks.

&gt; David!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is no qualification that would satisfy me, other than experience.
&gt; &gt; I learned by doing.  I think that's the only way, but some people will
&gt; &gt; have a different view on the matter.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with you wholeheartedly here except there are many
&gt; financially-unchallenged businesses who are willing to pay for people
&gt; who have pieces of people, despite the fact these are the same
&gt; businesses who will complain they can't afford to buy more electricity,
&gt; raise wages and other similar fiscal issues.
&gt; 
&gt; There is, I believe, a balance between practical, applied learning which
&gt; you allude to and theoretical learning. In my opinion our academic
&gt; institutions - especially the Universities - can't get things right.
&gt; They seem to be either "applied XYZ" but no theory - so a person can,
&gt; for example, be ABLE to set up NT Server to serve a site serving
&gt; millions but not WHY it works OR they lean the other way and land you
&gt; with all theory and NO hands on.
&gt; 



&gt; Personally, I learned by:
&gt; 
&gt; * doing
&gt; 
&gt; I installed linux and I reinstalled it at least 40 times before I was
&gt; satisfied I knew how to install it. There are some who don't have the
&gt; time or patience so a course may help them. But you can only see install
&gt; dramas for yourself if you are watching one...
&gt; 
&gt; * reading
&gt; 
&gt; I have a rather large collection of computer books, mainly O'Reilly
&gt; based but some "Unleashed" series. To the unaware, the O'Reilly books
&gt; will make more sense if you know Linux or you have at least attempted
&gt; and failed to implement their subject. They are excellent books and they
&gt; tend to cover their subjects in great detail, but the downside is that
&gt; you can accidentally miss the wood for the trees.
&gt; 
&gt; * asking this list and other lists
&gt; 
&gt; Believe it or not I've suffered my own uncalld for flames too. I still
&gt; have a glitch with the "RTFM" without telling people where the manual is
&gt; or how to access it. Sometimes people don't read manuals simply because
&gt; they have no idea it exists...the caveat to talking on a list like this
&gt; is:
&gt; 
&gt; a) there's bound to be someone who will kill you if you send your email
&gt; in HTML format
&gt; b) just because it's email doesn't mean people turn off their sense of
&gt; humour - but almost everyone has no sense of humour when they read what
&gt; they get
&gt; 
&gt; And a host of other problems. My own solution to these weaning problems
&gt; is to give as good as you get :-)
&gt; 
&gt; * watching
&gt; 
&gt; Go to the LinuxSA meetings and if you get the chance to see a "live"
&gt; system - whether it's a business system or just your next door
&gt; neighbours - ask. And don't STOP asking...how are you supposed to learn
&gt; about things if you don't know or won't ask about them? Although you may
&gt; strike a blast of sarcasm, arrogance or someone just being plain
&gt; patriotic, if you ignore the connotation and read what they actually SAY
&gt; you might find some gems of wisdom (1)...
&gt; 
&gt; As I said before, James. Just go and do it and come running to us when
&gt; you encounter the first thing you don't understand and can't work out
&gt; how to fix...
&gt; 
&gt; DL
&gt; 
&gt; (1)
&gt; I maintain I generally always answer the question, or alternatively keep
&gt; on topic in a lateral manner of thinking at all times...

&gt; The hate stands ready...
&gt;  Send forth your terror into HELL!
