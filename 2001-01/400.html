&gt;Back around 1980, I was a teenager playing around with TRS-80's and assembly
&gt;programming.  My friends and I wrote some programs that interested an
&gt;investor, and next thing we knew we were writing cutting-edge software for
&gt;new PC competitors.  We didn't realize that this was unusual for our age.
&gt;When I turned 18, educators and family convinced me that I had to go and get
&gt;the "piece of paper", so I took some time off from hacking and went to
&gt;college.  This slowed down the learning process considerably, and the next
&gt;thing I knew the marketplace passed me by, and these days I'm just a techie.
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile, not long before then, Bill Gates had dropped out of college and
&gt;started his own company.  And to think we used to chuckle over the sloppy
&gt;junk that IBM and Microsoft pushed out on the market...  (Actually, we still
&gt;chuckle over the Microsoft products...)

I think your comparison is incorrect ...

After all, William Gates III [I think] had a number of advantages:

1. He was where the action was
2. He had the good fortune to have very wealthy parents
3. His mother was on the board of IBM
