That's actually a really, really, good issue to touch on.

It happens that I agree with you on this.

So the question is - how do we support the 'occasional' overrun 
(which, you're right, I would be perfectly happy to swallow) 
automatically, without swallowing the firehose on the 
porn-sucking-bastards?

[noting that the porn-sucking-bastards are the ones that call you on 
the phone and scream blue murder, law suits and writing your name up 
in a negative context on toilet doors if you don't let them pull data 
flat out 24x7 for $25 per month.

They almost always don't mean it, but I hate people screaming at my staff.

Right now I really do agree that such people are better off (for me!) 
doing that to Optus, and letting me concentrate on caring for the 
needs of real people with real lives.]

I supposed we could conceivably set up an excess charging policy 
which allows up to (say) two excess bills out of 12 months to be 
absorbed by us. Would that satisfy your requirements? Do you think 
other people would go for that?

Cheers,
  Simon
