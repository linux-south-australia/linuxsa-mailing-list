Sure John, I should have told Dingoblue I did not need their poor business
model, I did not need their low cost or unlimited time or downloads.  Please
get a grip on reality, your points are fine, but cost, if you read my previous
mail, was NOT the primary reason for picking Dingoblue.  I stated that I would
be happy to pay more for such service. Don't you understand... I dont think
about what I D/L or how long I stay on for, that in itself is worth the money.
And while I'm on it, Internode's business strategy and others who still limit
hours or apply D/L charges are the ones who should be reviewing their business
models.  The Internet is and will be permanent part of our work and play
habits.  Limits of any kind are a model for disaster.

Simon H. once said to me, the business models for ISP's must be value adding
and include complementary services. I hope he hasn't changed his mind on this
as he was quite correct.  The ISP business model of just dial-up services is no
longer valid.

&gt; &gt;Actually, Dingoblue is good, I left internode, because of the limit on
&gt; hours and
&gt; &gt;small web-page space limits and the cost of maintaining the domain name
&gt; with
&gt; &gt;them. Overall I found them to be un-competitive, however, I had and still
&gt; have
&gt; &gt;nothing but praise for their service and speed. I will certainly look
&gt; carefully
&gt; &gt;at their DSL offerings when it arrives, but based on previous experience
&gt; I'm not
&gt; &gt;sure if they will be equal to other providers on cost.
&gt;
&gt; It depends who you mean when you say "other providers". Dingo blue has
&gt; always had an unsustainable pricing structure for Internet, especially for
&gt; their more remote areas. Fortunately for Optus who provided the network for
&gt; them, this massive loss paid off when they sold Dingo Blue to AGL.
&gt;
&gt; Optus cannot indefinately give Dingo Blue customers a free ride now that
&gt; they don't own it anymore, and sooner or later, AGL shareholders are going
&gt; to notice that the Internet business is losing money for no good reason.
&gt; They will either have to raise prices, reduce service levels or even
&gt; introduce download limits .. the horror. I suppose it's also possible that
&gt; AGL paid millions so they could discover the secret of remaining
&gt; cashflow-postitive whilst delivering 5Gb for $27 each month..
&gt;
&gt; Internode, on the other hand, actually makes a profit and employs people in
&gt; Adelaide without using anyone else's money.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't care where the service comes from, and price is the only
&gt; important thing you might want to ask someone who pre-paid for 12 months on
&gt; EISA about how clever it is to use an obviously-losing-money ISP.
