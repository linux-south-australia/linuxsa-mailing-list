 &gt; &gt; one of the common attributes of that mindset is that people who want
 &gt; &gt; something for nothing don't pay bills very well.
 &gt; 
 &gt; so you're saying that all of us that are on one of these plans are
 &gt; freeloaders???  that's quite a generalisation! 

It certainly is.  It's not the kind of generalization I'd ever make, either
(hint:  Any sentence which starts with the phrase, "So you're saying..." is
probably wrong).

There's a HUGE difference between saying, "unprofitably cheap access
tends to attract people who don't want to pay any money," and "Everyone
who is using an unprofitably cheap access plan is a freeloader."  The
first phrase is talking about a tendency, a bias;  The second is talking
about an overgeneralization.

 &gt; i can tell you never did psych
 &gt; or even economics for that matter :)  for a  psych there are probably seven
 &gt; (just a guess) or so different motivations here, the economist would say
 &gt; that not wanting something for nothing is totally unnatural and untrue.

Right -- And that's why ISPs which don't run on unprofitably cheap access
plans have so many customers:  People actually *LIKE* customer service.
They *LIKE* being able to talk to a helpdesk person who knows how to tie
shoelaces.  They *LIKE* ISPs which never, ever, ever produce busy signals.
They *LIKE* being able to have their modem call answered by modern equipment
which won't drop-out.  They *LIKE* ISPs who don't channel thousands of
users through congested upstreams.

If you want those kinds of features, someone needs to pay for them.  For
the EISAs and OGNs and AusNets of the world, the people who actually paid
for them were the shareholders.  The result now?  The shareholders got
sick of it, and those ISPs are now dead.  Can you give me any hints about
how the customers got a good deal out of that arrangement?

 &gt; are you a commie? (only joking)

Sigh.

 &gt; &gt; Companies of the calibre of BHP, CBA, etc don't use ISPs who don't have
 &gt; &gt; a viable business model.
 &gt; 
 &gt; are you telling me that cable and wireless-optus (i gather the former
 &gt; owners of dingo-blue) don't have a viable business model?  shit don't
 &gt; let the dow hear about that :)

DingoBlue was assimilated by Optus recently because they haven't been
making any money, in case you haven't been watching.

Cable and Wireless wants to sell Optus because they're not making any 
money either (among other reasons). 

 &gt; my point was that multi-national telcos, that own satellites etc. have
 &gt; bandwidth coming out of there noses and have a
 &gt; very good idea of what they are doing. 

Yes, you're right -- And, in case you haven't noticed, multi-national 
telcos are not coming into Australia and selling $25 all-you-can-eat
access plans!  

How much will you pay to use UUNet?  BigPond?  AAPT (aka connect.com.au)?
Lots!  

Optus' DingoBlue is an aberration.  In fact, *OPTUS* is an aberration.
C&W want to bail out for all kinds of reasons.

 &gt; we may not like it, but the
 &gt; shareholders do, and  they are not blind to the workings of markets,
 &gt; which is the reason many of them got to own shares in the first place :)

How naive.  Explain the .com boom to me then.
