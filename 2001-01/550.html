&gt; &gt;&gt; There's no reason why LinuxSA shouldn't join too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; except for the fact that we don't actually exist...
&gt;
&gt; What kind of excuse is that?

hmm... don't know... But I would have thought that to be an incorporated
association to get membership of the IT Council. (just an assumption)

(looks up website)

<A HREF="http://www.itcouncil.asn.au/aboutus/index.html">http://www.itcouncil.asn.au/aboutus/index.html</A>#join and
<A HREF="http://www.itcouncil.asn.au/aboutus/docs/mem_appl.doc">http://www.itcouncil.asn.au/aboutus/docs/mem_appl.doc</A> seem to imply that we
would need to be incorporated (ie "exist")

----
Join the IT Council
Any Information Industry Association may apply for membership of the IT
Council for South Australia.  An application form should be used for that
purpose. The application must be proposed and seconded by separate members
of the IT Council.  If you would like to join the IT Council, please
download the membership application form [ Word Doc ], fill it in and fax or
mail it to the IT Council
----
and:
----
Conditions of Membership

The IT Council for South Australia as the peak body for the IT&C industries
would like to include all IT&C Industry Associations as members in order to
be truly representative of the industry.

IT Council's role is to encourage members of the industry to become members
of an association that is relevant to them.  Its role is also to represent
industry wide views to Government, business and the community.  In turn IT
Council expects Industry Associations to represent their particular members
according to their constitution, rules and guidelines.
----


so without LinuxSA incorporating, we can't really represent our particular
members according to our constitution, rules and guidelines, seeing as we
don't have a condstitution without incorporating, yah yah?

:)

PS: greg -- hope you don't mind me posting this to the list... it seemed
relevant enough.

PPS: I think that this would be an effective way to go for influencing
industry and government.
