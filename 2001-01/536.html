<PRE>
Having (1) searched the SA Government web-site - obviously based on IIS
and ASP - it appears that the Hon. Dr. Michael Armitage, MP is the 
Minister most likely to be able to suggest IT policy for the whole SA 
Government.

He is in charge of:

* ICS
 - a body that developes internal computing services for the Government

* Information and Economic Policy Office
 - the name speaks for itself

I would suggest that he, or a speaker from the latter office I've
mentioned (or both) would make an interesting discussion at a LinuxSA
meeting. Keeping an open mind we could, quite simply, ask the Minister
to talk about the Government's support of IT in general and how the
Government views the growing (I think) Linux/BSD based IT industry...

Now, I haven't proposed this e-mail to create a discussion about IT
policy in the SA Government. Nor am I attempting to elicit political
responses based on the Minister's part affiliation, or that he is a
member of the current Government. Hence, if you reply on list your reply
should discuss the merits or lack thereof of inviting the Minister, or
his representative(s) as a public speaker.

The original started with the word "From" but some e-mail systems escape
that with a &gt; (&gt;). Don't you hate that?
