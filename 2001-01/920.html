&gt;Simon H. once said to me, the business models for ISP's must be value adding

I'll bite :)

Lets take those paragraphs in order. Apologies for the length, but 
you've hit one of my hot buttons :) In doing so, I'll put the case 
for why I think we (Internode) are a great choice as an ISP, as well. 
Apologies for those who think I'm just trumpet-blowing - you can hit 
'd' now if you wish.

On the first comment (limiting downloads or hours): Your statement 
that limits of any kind are a model for disaster is false IMHO.

Think of a petrol station - how long lived is a petrol station going 
to be if it charges you $25 per month for unlimited downloads of 
petrol into your car?

What about if he throws in unlimited downloads into all the cars you own?

What about if he lets your bring in a ute full of jerry cans and fill 
them up to hand on to his mates?

This sort of mental attitude about ISP's seems to abound on the 
presumption that bandwidth is free. Well it's getting cheaper, which 
is great. But free is a long way from the truth, and per-head 
consumption is rising at least as fast as per-MB costs are dropping.

If bandwidth was free, it wouldn't be one of my two largest monthly 
expenses (the other one being staff salaries).

If I'm supposed to let you connect and download that non-free 
bandwidth up to 24x7, for (say) $25, how was I supposed to pay for 
the bandwidth *and* the $27 per month Telstra charges me for an ISDN 
channel, and stay in business? The answer's pretty obvious - I don't 
do it, because it doesn't work.

And - lets see what's happening - we seem to be surrounded by ISP's 
who fold, or get bought out to avoid folding, lately. Indeed we've 
been doing some of the buying of late. Gee, I sure don't think we're 
doing it wrong :)

All consumer ISP accounts are limited in some axis, to make them 
viable, *or* the ISP concerned is going to hit the wastebasket 
eventually. Even Optus and/or Dingo Blue - one is for sale, the other 
already sold, just lately.

But perhaps you're not aware of all of the limits that are inherent 
in the models being used.

It is very common for ISP's to play up the lack of a few of those 
limits as misdirection to hide the implementation of limits in other 
axes. And this is a survival mechanism for the ISP concerned!

For instance, limit vectors can include:

- hours per month
- megabytes per month
- the use of dynamic IP's versus static IP's when a session is initiated
- session time limits
- idle time limits
- throughput limits (created by bad engineering or oversold upstream
	bandwidth or, deliberate rate limits on sessions)
- whether multilink ppp is permitted
- whether ISDN indial is permitted (with or without MPPP, with or 
without DoV support).
- percentage likelihood of getting a busy signal when you want to log in
- cross subsidy, *by you* of those porn-sucking-download fiends on 
the other lines
- acceptable use policy preventing access by multiple computers, or 
the running of servers, or automated download systems, or use by 
anyone outside of your immediate family except under your direct 
personal supervision (these are all in the Big Pond residential ADSL 
conditions!)

It's the old adage, 'good, fast, cheap, pick any two' in action. We 
made a day one choice to shoot for 'good' and 'fast' ahead of 
'cheap'. And we're thriving.

Since we do charge, fairly, for hours and/or megabytes, we allow 
multilink ppp. We allow ISDN indial for the same price as modem 
indial. We support ISDN data-over-voice (again including multilink) 
so you can dial in to us at a very low cost using ISDN if you can't 
yet get ADSL and you want to stop using a modem. We aren't afraid of 
you downloading lots of stuff via any of these vectors.  We don't 
have to run session limiters or speed limiters.

Since we do charge, fairly, we have enough lines, and we have 
absolute, gobsmackingly huge amounts of available bandwidth here. You 
want to download something? You've got it.

We happily support all these things because our cost model charges, 
fairly, for our customers' use of our resources.

TANSTASFL - ALL OF THIS COSTS MONEY

It is not, in principle, dishonourable for ISP's to offer an account 
with no limit on hours or megabytes, but I bet they'll limit you on 
something else instead - like simultaneous logins, or any or several 
of the things I noted above. What's bad is if they advertise without 
clearly stating their chosen limits (and nearly nobody mentions the 
'no simultaneous logins' limit in their 'unlimited' account, do they? 
We *dont have such a restriction*)

And now, the 'heartstrings' argument :)

Is Dingo Blue building the first non-Telstra rural broadband network 
in the history of South Australia, to blow away the inequities of 
living in the country in SA for voice calls and Internet access? No, 
but we are - and we're proud of it.

Is Dingo Blue providing broadband enabled buildings all over the 
Adelaide city area, and in Tech Park, and elsewhere, helping a whole 
raft of incubator centers to provide cost effective space for new 
companies to grow and prosper here in Adelaide? No, but we are - and 
we're proud of it.

Tell me I'm not spending your money wisely. I think we are :)

The core reason why you should use 'us' and not 'them' is beyond just 
the fact that our quality of service is at the top of the heap. The 
core reason is that everyone in this state should try, really hard, 
to do business with others IN THIS STATE for our collective future 
benefit.

Reward me and I'll reward you back. That's how the wheel turns. Its 
something I've always practiced in my own business dealings and damn 
it, it works.

To the second comment in Stephen's message above:

I think we've still stuck to that strategy (providing good value and 
providing complimentary services).

We are way past being just a dialup ISP. We provide a lot of value 
add beyond dialup - ADSL *will* be out of the gates for us very soon, 
and our offering value-adds way past the things that Telstra Retail 
imagine people want from ADSL.

We're like you - we're technical people, we pride ourselves on being 
technical people, we know what you want. 'They' only know what their 
focus group of housewives (and house husbands!) imagined they wanted. 
If you want bland, go to them, with our blessings.

We have, in the Adelaide CBD (in the first instance), some hugely 
exciting new offerings in the works that will blow way past ADSL. We 
are busily laying optical fibre all over the place, and being 
increasingly creative with copper, and we are examining a few good 
options for the next generation of our wireless broadband offerings 
(taking them far beyond our existing, successful, 802.11b derived 
systems).

Finally, I'll note that I believe that businesses do well by also 
understand what they're NOT good at, and partnering with other local 
businesses who do.

Hence, for example, we don't do web presence design. We don't do 
software development. We don't do database design work. Others in 
this town are at world class in that realm - why do a lacklustre job 
when they're brilliant? I believe in that, and I apply it in what we 
do. And they do the same in return, referencing us when their 
customers want a fast, reliable ISP and/or broadband carrier.

I also apply it the other way around - if I can't find someone 
offering me a world class answer and I know we can do it better 
ourselves, we often do.

Lately that's meant biting the bullet and installing Cisco 5400 
voice/fax/modem/ISDN access servers all over the state and all over 
the country, because we got tired of stupid, or overpriced (or both) 
virtual-port offerings from other people.

We are trying really damn hard, as we always have. We enjoy 
competition, and we appreciate suggestions, always.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we think we're a great choice 
in terms of an ISP.

Thanks for listening.

Cheers,
   Simon Hackett
