Gentlepersons,

Don't know if you have seen this before but I ran across a PCAuthority
(Feb 2001 page 31 'Naked PC') article today which talks about the
following M$ article - note you need to register as a 'system builder'
with M$ to access the following url

<A HREF="http://oem.microsoft.com/worldwide/502453.asp">http://oem.microsoft.com/worldwide/502453.asp</A>

Anyway, basically M$ tells its OEM system rebuilders that a PC without
an operating system is

"...useless until customers install system software themselves. It's
like selling a house without a roof..."

- ----&gt; would you buy a house controlled by M$ software??????

And that

"...if you act on your customers' willingness to buy Naked PCs—knowing
full well they are at risk of acquiring pirated operating systems
elsewhere—you expose them to legal risks, viruses, and frustrating
technical troubles. Hardly the stuff of great business relationships,
particularly when they come back to you for help. And even if your
customer manages to illegally acquire and install operating systems
elsewhere, it still costs them far more time and money than they
bargained for. No matter how you look at them, Naked PCs are bad for
your customers. Which means they are also bad for you..."

- ----&gt; heaven save the world if a customer forsakes M$ for something of
THEIR own choosing

Further that you as a system builder should:

"...Highlight the fact that the PC will not work without an operating
system. Mention that preinstalling the operating system on the new PC
saves considerable time, expense and trouble. After all, your
expertise is valuable. You install system software day in, day out, so
there is little question you're best equipped to do it well..."

- ----&gt; I would expect a price drop since I'm doing it my self and not
paying for some pimply youth, and everyone knows how hard it is to
install Linux now a days

And

"...Warn customers that acquiring the PC "naked" and subsequently
pirating the software is never a good option. Explain the risks:
technical troubles, upgrade problems, viruses and the law..."

And how is this as a punch-line

"...Politely decline to expose your buyers or their businesses to such
troubles..."

- ----&gt; ie don't act as an independent system analyst and offer the best
solution even if it's not a M$ one, but save them from the evils of
Linux etc.

And

"...Point out the benefits of a legally licensed, preinstalled
operating system. Customers have the original CD so they can reload
the software. They also have a manual for everyday troubleshooting,
and a Certificate of Authenticity that proves the software is legal.
In short, protect your customer and your good name. Sell your PCs
fully equipped with legally licensed operating systems preinstalled.
Otherwise, who knows what you're leaving your customers—and
yourself—open to?..."

- ----&gt; what can I say....

And of course (which is fair enough as I don't condone software piracy
- - hey doesn't GPL over comes that issue)

"...Acquire software from Microsoft OEM Distributors—your only assured
source of legal Microsoft products..."

Cheers,

Anthony {Tony} Riling
