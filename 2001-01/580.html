ME&gt; I have installed Linux on my machine which I am dual booting with Windows 98.  I am currently running Redhat 6.2. 
ME&gt; I have changed the Windows manager to Windows maker.
ME&gt; 
ME&gt; I have the following questions:
ME&gt; 
ME&gt; 1    How do i find out what version of Window manager I am running?

In windowmaker you can right-click the desktop/root_window, and select info - the answer lies within.


ME&gt; 2    If I am running an updated version (eg 6.0) is it backwards compatible with previous Window Makers??

Windowmaker has not yet reached v1.0 - I think you are reffering to 0.6x.x.
The current branch is compatible (Theme wise) back to 0.52.0.
The dockapp compatibility side is a whole different kettle of fishola, and comes down to 'how' the app was written - that is, does it rely on version specific libraries or not. Most dockapps will work on most current versions of Windowmaker.


ME&gt; 3    How do I install the Theme??  I have searched on the net for installation documents, followed them but the theme does not seem to be installing.  Any tips/tricks/advice is much appreciated.

Theme installation is done by unpackinging the theme.tar.gz file into your ~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/Themes/ directory, and loading the theme via the right-click-on-root-window menu.
For more detailed information, try wm.themes.org and look at the docs, or wait until teknix finishes the much needed update to <A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org">http://www.windowmaker.org</A>


ME&gt; 4    (OFT) Where would I find information about setting up my modem and configuring Linux for the Internet plus setting up sound security.

<A HREF="http://www.linux.com">http://www.linux.com</A>  has some very good tips and tricks for first timers, newbies, and adepts alike - check it out.
Securing your soundcard is not really that important ;)
