<H1>NIC Problem</H1>

Hi everyone,

i just installed Linux Mandrake 7.2 - its taken me a while to install
because i had a few problems, but now that i have it installed i love the
distro, i could very easily learn to use this 24/7 rather than windows.

I only have this one problem, its a bit of a major problem - I cant get my
Network Card to install. ( this is a big problem cause i need my NIC to get
my cable)
I have previously installed this card on a linux system - its the network
card <A HREF="mailto:Optus@home">Optus@home</A> gave me with the cable and it uses the mod "de4x5"

I tried installing it during the install but the machine just kept
stalling - like the mouse would not move, i couldnt reboot with ctrl-alt-del
either.
I thought ok - maybe it just wont install during the install, so i skipped
the install and waited till i got the box up and running.
I then went to insmod de4x5 and it simply stalls again.
ctrl-alt-del doesnt work again.

Note: during the install it would detect what kind of card it is, but then
just stall.

I'm guessing it is some kind of IRQ/DMA problem, conflicting with another
card, i just dont know where to start.

I would start ripping out the cards and just leave the NIC in there, but the
problem is that this is the only configuration that works with windows,
meaning if i swap the card positions, one of the cards will not work. Yes, i
know this is annoying! :)

What i have in my system -
Matrox g400 video card - AGP

Adaptec AIC-7850 SCSI card
SMC ??? Network Card
Soundblaster LIVE! Vale soundcard.

Thanx to anyone that replies.
