[...stuff about office routers for home-to-office ADSL users...]
&gt; This also requires a change in IOS to support the feature we need to 
&gt; do what we want to do - I've got this achieved as a formal Cisco 
&gt; internal feature request and I'm rattling chains internally in Cisco 
&gt; at this time to get it implemented.

That's good. At the client end (or at the office router end) will you also
be permitting some kind of PCI card solution, much like Traverse only for
ADSL not ISDN?

&gt; I've been playing with the cost modeling around a 'one tenth the 
&gt; cost' pricing basis lately
  :
&gt; Comments welcome. I suspect that a 5000 Mb cap would be enough for 
&gt; most rational humans using ADSL as an office linking technology, 

For most purposes this would be fine. Most people go into their office
several times a week if not every day, and downloads to laptops or
borrowing CDs etc can keep the cost down. I have worked in situations in
the past where there was a bare end-to-end ISDN connection and people did
keep it flat chat 24x7 running mirroring applications. But careful
application of rsync reduced this to a trickle.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Your support would be sincerely appreciated, as would your comments
&gt; &gt;  &gt; on the above price points
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The prices seem very reasonable to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks - it's actually not something we've had a lot of feedback on 
&gt; as yet.
   :
&gt; In terms of our trunk access to pick up and send bytes, this 
&gt; constraint to date is economic, upon us - whether that trunk results 
&gt; in us making a profit or a loss is directly a factor of the overload 
&gt; we choose in terms of customers-per-megabit of trunk bandwidth.

I take it is this just plain trunk bandwidth, ie there is no
differentiation on which direction bytes are going? I notice you haven't
constrained bytes going upstream and that you permit servers. What happens
if I start serving a copy of mirror.aarnet to anyone who wants it?

&gt; So - what's the long term future for ADSL in this country? I think 
&gt; it'll be quite big, but if Telstra don't pull their finger out, there 
&gt; will likely also be a viable market in alternatives to ADSL of a 
&gt; similar performance level (such as our existing Agile wireless 
&gt; systems), and other ways to skin a similar cat will also emerge in 
&gt; some places. ADSL is likely to be the mid term winner in the 
&gt; 'ubiquitous sort-of broadband' stakes in metropolitan Adelaide in my 
&gt; view.

Do please let this list know the instant you can justify repricing an
Agile wireless connection to compete with ADSL. I'm sure many here would
be most interested but the current spread spectrum installation fee is
something like 40 times that of ADSL, isn't it? Maybe I misunderstood this
comment.
