 &gt; &gt; It is misinterpreting a specification for use of CPRM
 &gt; &gt; with the Compact Flash media format (which supports either semiconductor
 &gt; &gt; flash memory or IBM microdrives) probably because Compact Flash uses the
 &gt; &gt; same command protocol interface as standard PC harddrives. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; But further articles at "The Register" suggest that the changes are proposed
 &gt; changes to the ATA spec, not the ATAPI spec,

CompactFlash devices are ATA compliant, so yes, I agree that those Register
articles are consistent with the RISKS article which I posted earlier today.

Reference to the ATAPI spec is curious given that the only place I've seen
anyone refer to the ATAPI spec so far has been The Register's web site, and
that reference was only to say that CPRM wasn't affecting ATAPI.  As such,
I'm left wondering why they mentioned it at all -- Perhaps they believe
that drawing breathless attention to stunningly obvious revelations of 
oblique trivia is actually a worthwhile contribution to the discussion.

Are you confused yet?

 &gt; so it any ATA X.Y-compliant device (for whatever versions of X and Y)
 &gt; will have CPRM built-in, independent of whether the "original intention"
 &gt; was to include it in non-removeable media or not.

I'd be interested in whether you have any source other than The Register
(like, say, an openly-available protocol spec from the CPRM website) which
leads to that conclusion.  Thus far the only views on this issue which I've
seen have either appeared in The Register, or have used The Register as 
their sole source of information.

Note, by the way, that none of the statements you've made after the word
"so" above are in any way supported by any of the statements you've made
before the word "so".  In particular, I believe use of the words "any"
and "will" were injudicious.  Let's keep some perspective here, and remember
that the members of the CPRM committee can't even agree on it yet, so it's
a bit premature to talk about devices where it's going to compulsorily 
appear.

Here's how I think the "story" really broke:

   * Someone with half a clue (i.e.: less than a full clue) read some of
     the CPRM website materials.  Some of those materials contained keywords
     like "content protection" which sounded "bad" to the clue-impaired 
     reader, who didn't have enough background knowledge to understand the
     context in which they were being used.

   * Said clue-impaired reader forwarded sanitized extracts of CPRM website
     materials to a journo at The Register.  Journo had even less technical
     clue than the original reader, so he gobbled it up without even thinking
     about it, and churned out the panic-stricken articles we've been reading
     about in this forum for the last couple of weeks.  I'd lay odds that some
     of the sentences in the original article were copied verbatim from the
     email message which would have accompanied the extracts of the CPRM web
     site materials.

   * Individuals with rather more clue than the two protagonists described 
     above have since hotly debated the issue on the RISKS forum, and that
     discussion has culminated with someone from a company who is actually
     part of the CPRM committee pointing out that the protocol extensions 
     don't have all that much to do with hard disks.

   * Contributions like that are condemned as spin-doctoring by those who
     have twisted themselves out of shape on the debate so far, even though
     they're coming from the only organizations in the world who are actually
     in a position to authoratively comment on the design of CPRM.  When you 
     eliminate qualified comment, all that's left is spin, hype and
     conjecture.

Once that last step is taken, the whole "conspiracy" angle becomes self-
perpetuating.  Anyone who has a contrary view is deemed to be tainted by
the conspiracy, and hence ignored or ridiculed by anyone who would be
interested in saying anything about the issue (and remember that the only
people who are intersted in saying anything about it are those who think
they're about to lose control of their hard disks, since without that angle
the whole thing is a bit of a yawn).

 &gt; The guys at "The Register" also had an article suggesting that the 4C's
 &gt; went into damage control with lots of similar email clarification and
 &gt; that they weren't convinced that the problem was going away despite
 &gt; the clarifications.

When confronted with a choice between alluding to a vague conspiracy, or
publishing an article saying, "Uh, sorry, we goofed," I expect the 
overwhelming majority of media organizations to carry out the former 
course of action, rather than the latter.

As such, said media organizations go on to render themselves guilty of all
the things they accuse their opponents of being guilty of, including the
accusation of "damage control."  Attacking your opponent by making unproven
associations between their behaviour and unlikable attributes of your own
conduct is known as "projection," and reeks of hypocrisy.

Throughout this controversy, am I the only one who has wondered why The
Register has been the only media outlet who has done any research into
this story?  Other agencies have carried brief three-paragraph stories, 
but they've all quoted The Register as a source -- Nobody else has asked
any questions, or claimed to be delivering any answers.  Surely if it's
that big and important there'd be interest from elsewhere, yes?  Because
until that happens, The Register is making all kinds of accusations in 
an environment which features *no* corroborating voices.

Personally, I'd place far more credibility in the RISKS forum digest, which
is edited to a high standard (and which has exhibited consistently high
quality for as long as I can remember), than I'd place in The Register (an
online publication which I'd totally ignore if not for the fact that Alan
K. keeps posting URLs from it).
