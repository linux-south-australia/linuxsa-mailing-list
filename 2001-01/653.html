I just thought that it might be worth mentioning that ISP's in Adelaide
have been using HDSL technologies for *years*, and can probably supply
them if you're interested in a high-speed/high-quality link that's not a
Telstra service. For those interested, ETSA also have a massive
HDSL/Pairgain copper network they've been building up over the last
decade.

Approximate costs are around $6000 for the setup, plus a Telstra PAPL
service that you have to commit to for 12 months, which may or may not
work. The cost is distance dependant, usually under $200 per month for a
4-wire service. This gives you a real 2Mb/s send AND receive, although
data is going to cost more again on top of what I've mentioned. You'll
also need to be connected to the same exchange as your ISP, which will
generally mean you need to be in the CBD.

There are also continuing dramas with the availability of the PAPL
service, but apparently it's still on the Telstra price list for now.
