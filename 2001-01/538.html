&gt;&gt; You might have noticed an article on computer education entering the
&gt;&gt; Curriculum in SA in a big way.

No, where was this?

&gt;&gt; I suspect that this is nothing more than a Microsoft entrenchment
&gt;&gt; tool.
&gt;
&gt; Actually, this depends on who is driving the curriculum process.  I
&gt; wouldn't be at all surprised that Microsoft will feature
&gt; significantly but this may not be solely because of
&gt; Microsoft. However, I susepct the curriculum developers:
&gt;
&gt; * possibly may not have used anything but Microsoft products
&gt; * may assume that young people are computer illiterate (1)

And want to keep them that way?

&gt; * may take into account the teacher education required
&gt;
&gt; I would also hazard a guess that most computer teachers may be more
&gt; familiar teaching Microsoft products than Linux based products.

No question.

&lt;lots of good commentary snipped&gt;

I agree with most of this.  The current attitude to computer education
in SA seems to be to make good users of computers rather than people
who understand computers.  My daughter is 15, about to start year 11,
and based on the curriculum we decided that there was no point in
doing *any* of the computer subjects, since they were so clearly
geared towards "how to use Microsoft".  There's more than just
Microsoft that's wrong in this picture: "how to use Linux" would be
only marginally better.  The thrust should be "understanding (oh, and
using) computers".

&gt; AUUG exists but - let's face it and no offence to AUUG - LinuxSA
&gt; does seem to be the strongest, most vibrant "unix like" users group
&gt; in SA.  There is no friction between AUUG nationally and LinuxSA
&gt; locally.

Of course, being one of the local AUUG people, I'm going to have to
take issue on that one :-) And yes, there's no friction.  Still, it's
obvious that LinuxSA is there to promote Linux.  In that respect, it's
similar to Microsoft.  AUUG is a little broader in approach, but even
then, we still have UNIX in our name.  Still, we can point to our
support for open systems in general.

One of the things I've been considering is that AUUG join the IT
Council for South Australia (<A HREF="http://www.itcouncil.asn.au/">http://www.itcouncil.asn.au/</A>).  I suppose
it's time to follow up on that one.  I've spoken to Denis Wall about
that, and he thinks it would be a good idea.  There's no reason why
LinuxSA shouldn't join too.

&gt; (3)
&gt; I acknowledge that RedHat, Mandrake et al. do have some marketing clout,
&gt; but I would draw one's attention to a Polish consortium (eeck - there
&gt; was a story on SlashDot about a Polish hotel that went to Linux) that is
&gt; an umbrella organisation for all commercial Linux support companies and
&gt; individuals and performs similar functions to a Chamber of
&gt; Commerce...

This sounds like a global version of the IT Council for SA.  Do you
have a URL?
