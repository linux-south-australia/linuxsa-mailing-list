Thanks.
Going through the how-to again, was the option for tonight (again) anyway.
I was hoping there would be something simple, like a kernel with all this
stuff already working.

&gt; &gt; Hi Guys
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone had any success with getting Windows 98 machines connecting
to a
&gt; &gt; VPN through a Linux proxy?
&gt; &gt; At the moment, I have Redhat 6.2 box running a patched 2.2.16 kernel. It
&gt; &gt; almost works, as in there seems to be at least an attempt to connect,
but
&gt; &gt; still can't get it going.
&gt; &gt; I had previously tried 2.2.14, and 2.2.18, with no success at all.
&gt; &gt; Does 2.4.0 do this any better?
&gt;
&gt; Unless your using Shiva VPM, there is alot of work needed.
&gt;
&gt; Get a hold of the VPN-Firewall HOWTO and read it over and over again.
&gt;
&gt; If it is Shiva, then it will work. If you can ping through your proxy,
&gt; Shiva will work.
&gt;
&gt; The VPN HOWTO is very good - it details a few things you need to do.
&gt; This involves a bit of programming IIRC.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck!
