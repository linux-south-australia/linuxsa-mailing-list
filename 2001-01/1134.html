&gt; allocation forward for maintenance on the cacheing equipment we run 
&gt; here, tell me again where my cached bytes were so cheap?
&gt; 
&gt; We have a lot of equipment devoted to cacheing because for us its a 
&gt; performance issue - it helps to make the Internet seem quick for our 
&gt; customers - and whether the effective dollars-per-MB rate is 
&gt; acceptable to them is a choice they can (and do) make - it being a 
&gt; (relatively) free country.

They do indeed, I am not nad I dont think I have suggested any particular
pricing for your products.

I do however suggest that other pricing plans apart from yours are viable,
or at least appear to be based on other local but sizeable ISPs who
appear to be reporting profit.

I am also suggesting that it would seem equitable to me that ISPs who do
charge on a megabyte basis at some level eg for all byte sor after some
threshold, pass that saving onto the user.

&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; On the rest of your message:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not going to debate you on the merits or otherwise of where we 
&gt; choose to spend our profits. That's our choice, and we're comfortable 
&gt; with it. Our customers direct concern is whether they're getting 
&gt; sufficient value on their service for the money they're paying for 
&gt; it. I do think that whether we use those profits on things that 
&gt; materially improve the telecommunications landscape in this country 
&gt; is a good thing to use them for. You are free to disagree, as you 
&gt; seem to do, and that's just fine.
&gt; 
&gt; I will make the statement, however, that if you don't encourage 
&gt; people like us to succeed, I promise you that you'll never get that 
&gt; fibre 10 metres from your front door that you say you want, because 
&gt; without competition, Telstra will never, ever, do that for you. ever. 
&gt; So that's your choice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And is certainly not doing "joe blow" user a whole lot of direct good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Depends whether 'joe blow' wants to see flat rate untimed national 
&gt; voice calls this year, or in 10 years time, doesn't it.
&gt;
&gt; Now, you might find it personally more rewarding to wait for Telstra 
&gt; or Optus to be innovative, but I am choosing to spend my money where 
&gt; my mouth is - instead of hoping for that fibre-laden, cheap phone 
&gt; calls future, I'm actually helping to build it. I'm comfortable with 
&gt; the choices I'm making, as you presumably are with yours.

I have no doubt you are making sound commercial choices.
And certianly would expect you  to justify your choices to me.
I just dont find your "reasons to use internode - heartstrings section"
pull my heartstrings very tenderly.
