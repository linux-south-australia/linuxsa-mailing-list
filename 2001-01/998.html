Simon,

&gt; - Connection to an office via L2TP rather than a plain Internet link is fine
&gt; (However the DSL router cost for the router needed will add to the 
&gt; install fee in this case, I'm still wrestling with finding the best 
&gt; value for money 'high end' DSL customer end box for this option)

This sounds very interesting. Perhaps you can give a 'to the nearest
$1000' type estimate on this. I've not the slightest clue what one of
these might cost.

How will the charging model work in this case? Does the ADSL just become a
piece of copper direct to the office, ie $install plus $rental and that's
it, with the $ just the same as for a service that includes bytes?

&gt; Your support would be sincerely appreciated, as would your comments 
&gt; on the above price points

The prices seem very reasonable to me. 

What are you committing to in terms of fault reporting and repairing? This
is one area where it would be possible for you to do much better than
Telstra's ISDN team does, from my experience (I didn't get any resolution
until I went down the pits with the repair staff. The nicest bit was where
I reported the fault for the nth time and the person taking the report
said "Hey, didn't you just answer my question on the LinuxSA list this
morning?" :)

&gt; and suggestions on what else we could 
&gt; offer that would be of use to you in an ADSL service.

I'd like to know what it means that ADSL is a shared service, or so I've
read. When everyone on an exchange is using ADSL, can we expect the the
performance to drop? (Not that this will happen until some large telco
starts agressively pushing ADSL nationwide, of course :-) If you were to
accurately describe in a sentence or so the long-term outlook for ADSL
you'd be well in front of everyone else in the transparency stakes.
