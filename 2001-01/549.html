Hi,

Let me emphasize a point that Greg Lehey has made.

The current Computer Education vision enunciated in the Advertiser,
presumably by the Government, is not one that will make South Australia a
great information industry state.  It is one that will simply make SA a
user of other people's software, and also-ran in the information industry
stakes.

The bold strategies are being promoted by the governments of China, Mexico,
and France, where they recognize that putting the means to turn their
citizens into computer literate people, people who can program, rather than
turning them into mouse-waving users of other country's software, is of
greater help to their economies in the long run.

The points that we must get across are that:

  Continuing to rely on Microsoft:

   - Keeps funds flowing out of the country
   - Does not produce an information industry, rather it produces a 
     country dependent on other people's software.

  Shifting to a strategy of promoting open source software, even at
Reception levels, however, does the following:

   - Makes better use of existing equipment and makes funds go further.
   - Reduces the outflow of foreign reserves and money
   - Promotes a strong, self-sufficient, information industry in SA.

Let's face it, the computer industry changes so quickly, that even someone
finishing year 12 will have to face a new generation of software by the
time they finish a computer degree, and will see a change of software
within two years of finishing a TAFE course.

So, to insist that students must learn to use today's dominant software is
utter rubbish.

Regards
