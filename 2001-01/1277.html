Peter didn't write:

But Outlook Express did.

Very quickly, ipchains works in a sequential manner. The first rule that
happens to match "wins"; if no rules match then the default policy
(which is, by default, ACCEPT) wins. Hence, in English you could say:

* allow 10.0.0.254 only
* deny all IP from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 inclusive
* default policy is DENY

Hence, when the rules are checked, .254 will be allowed even though it
would be denied by the middle rule. Why? Because it comes before the
middle rule. What you probably want to do is something similar to the
above.

As for specifying contiguous addresses, you should start to do some
research on what are known as sub nets, netmasks, CIDR et al; basically
you need to learn a working knowledge of how to specify IP addresses. At
the end of your research you should understand things like:

192.168.0.0/24
192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0

The reason you want to learn IP addressing is that you can use netmasks
in your ipchains rules. So:

ipchains -A input -i eth0 -p tcp -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT

Is a rule that says "accept all TCP packets whose source is anywhere
between 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255. I could have written 10.0.0.0 to
10.0.0.255 in 255 rules but why bother when there's a short cut?

Essentially, think creatively about what networks and subnets you want
to deny and accept and you'll come up with the answer. To do this you'll
need to understand IP addressing techniques.

Now, you shouldn't run your firewall script from rc.local because it is
generally run last. You should run your firewall script as close to
system start up as you can get it. My script actually starts BEFORE my
interfaces get up. Why? There's an irritatingly slight, but very real,
window when someone may be able to slip past your script.

Other sources of info are:

* the IPCHAINS howto
* TCP/IP Unleashed by Macmillan
* Building Linux Firewalls by Robert Ziegler

But start with the IPCHAINS Howto. If you are stuck for money or
something like that, duck into a local TAFE library or UniSA at the
levels and find a book that describes IP addressing and photocopy like
mad - it should be less expensive than buying one.

Incidentally, most of us find it easier if you try to avoid sending HTML
encoded mail from one of the Outlook's. I had to perform all sorts of
weird things to your mail to read it.
