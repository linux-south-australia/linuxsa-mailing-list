People has this topic gone askew somewhat?

I think most have or know of people working within ISP's. I have a number 
and they all say the unlimited plans do not make them money if they are 
raped to the limit. But as it turns out I think 10% of them are and the 
remainder are reasonable and they at least do not lose money on them.

The mindset (in my case) is that I do not want the restrictions of time or 
download for the off chance I will need it perhaps once or twice a year. 
Time I will for sure data though is really kept within 600 mb a month. I 
think that's reasonable for most average consumers.

The mp3 heads who constantly steam stuff down get up into the multi-gb but 
across the whole it averages them back to under a gb in most cases.

I think an unlimited only plan from an ISP doesnt give them sufficient 
buffer money wise so they have their other plans for the simple I'll check 
my email once a day type stuff.

Regards

Evan

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the hallmarks of the "$25 unlimited" style of plans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that they tend to attract people who have a mindset which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wants something for nothing.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; well that narrows it down to... everyone!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bzzt, wrong.
&gt;
&gt;bollocks.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; like who says "a free burger? nah, i'd rather pay!" ??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually, yes.  I do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd much rather pay for a good healthy meal at a reputable
&gt; &gt; establishment that I knew was capable of delivering a quality
&gt; &gt; meal at an affordable price.
&gt;
&gt;bollocks again.  ok, what about a free serve of beef wellington
&gt;at the hilton, included with the price you paid for the room.
&gt;would you knock that back, and insist on paying?  sheesh.
&gt;
&gt;what about a free upgrade to business class, because there is a
&gt;spare seat, and the ticketing clerk liked you?
&gt;
&gt;the rule of tanstaafl (there aint no such thing as a free lunch)
&gt;is fundamental economics, *someone* ends up paying, if not only
&gt;the environment, only those determined to be terminally poor
&gt;try to ensure it will be them paying :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So these would be the same people who have an unlimited phone
&gt; &gt; account with their telco, oh yes, that's right, that business
&gt; &gt; model doesn't work!  *laff*  wake up.
&gt;
&gt;let me spell it out, and can you all please stop taking this
&gt;so personally, work out the *average* use, how much that costs
&gt;and charge accordingly.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; So why did they sell it?
&gt;
&gt;how would i know? :)
&gt;
&gt;business i guess, doesn't mean they're going the way of eisa though.
&gt;
&gt;when the state bank collapsed (as did the rural and industrial in perth)
&gt;due to corrupt/incompetant directors, people in the banking industry
&gt;didn't run around saying "oh god, the directors of westpac must be
&gt;incompetant too!"
&gt;
&gt;please, there is a forrest out there, not just a couple of trees.
