&gt; &gt; I think it would be a good idea for LinuxSA to compile a list of recommended
&gt; &gt; security techniques.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been suggested before and nothing happened.

Here's my bit for a start, chopped out of an old email. If someone wants
to collect and colate improvements and post the result, feel free.

------- Start Security Snippets

1. General: I consider security to be the ability to know that your data
is in the state that it should be in. Another word for this might be
system integrity. Building a system to prevent damage from malicious
crackers is a very good aim, not because that is the most serious risk
(for most people it isn't, by a long shot) but because all the things you
do to that end also protect against the more common and frequently more
dangerous threats to integrity that abound - dud backup media, sloppy
sysadmins, misleading records, slack operating system developers, outdated
software, poor network design etc.

2. Good Passwords. Choose good passwords. Encourage your users to do the
same by running password cracking programs regularly.

3. Start from a known-good state. If you layer all sorts of integrity
controls on top of a system that started to decay long ago (or which
aleady has a cracker in residence) you are wasting your time.

4. Backups. Good ones. Multiple ones. Complete ones. Cycle through
off-site secure storage.

5. Know Your Files. In other words, run some software that keeps a record
of every file on your systems. Do you have a way of verifying that a
restored backup contains exactly the files that you thought were backed
up? Do you have a way of telling every time a file changes in your
privileged binary directories? Can you answer the question 'what non-user
files changed on my system over the last three days?' Tripwire and
FreeVeracity (and Veracity) are two solutions which work. (Free)Veracity
is the only one capable of network operation.

6. Tell Outsiders Nothing Directly. Every time you tell someone what
version of a piece of software you're running you are giving away
information that can be stored, for checking every time a new
vulnerability is discovered. Many networks don't have very many services
exposed to the Internet, frequently just web, mail and ssh. This makes is
very easy stop the daemons giving trivial identification on connection.
Networks that have a need to expose many services face different problems.

An example of the trivial nature of this:

  $ telnet mail.openbsd.org 25
  Trying 128.138.192.83...
  Connected to openbsd.cs.colorado.edu.
  Escape character is '^]'.
  220 openbsd.org ESMTP Sendmail 8.10.1/8.10.1/millert ready willing and
  able at Fri, 19 Jan 2001 11:17:13 -0700 (MST)

7. Tell Outsiders Nothing Indirectly. Send mail to dfgdfgfdg.dfgfdgdg at
your network. Have a look at the headers you get back. Typical bits of
information include: software and operating systems and versions on
machines inside the firewall, client software and operating system
information. Clever analysis over multiple messages can yield even more
information. Consider sanitising your headers and tuning your error
responses.

8. Assume Insiders Are Outsiders. You can't do this absolutely, but in
general try to make sure every machine on a network is running a firewall
and otherwise configured as if the machine in the next room is run by
someone with hostile intent. Done to the correct degree in any given LAN
you shouldn't impact usability.

9. No Plain Text. There is rarely a need to run protocols that do not
securely encrypt at least the password of a session, and hopefully the
entire contents of a transmission. Consider using scp or secure ftp, for
example. Use ssh instead of telnet. Etc.

10. Eschew Obfuscation. The less complication you have the easier it will
be to spot where your systems aren't being managed with a view to
integrity. Don't try to gain security through obscurity, at least as a
major end in itself.
