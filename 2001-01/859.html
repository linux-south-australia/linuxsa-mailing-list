That all depends on the type of market share you attract.

One of the hallmarks of the "$25 unlimited" style of plans (which aren't
really unlimited - See their TOS's) is that they tend to attract people
who have a mindset which wants something for nothing.  And, one of the 
common attributes of that mindset is that people who want something for
nothing don't pay bills very well.

If you're running a business, attracting people who don't pay their bills
as customers for a service which would lose gigadollars even if everyone
*was* paid up isn't spectacularly bright.  And, for all the hype about
loss-leader marketting, I'm not actually aware of ISPs like DingoBlue,
iPrimus and EISA actually making any money out of their Internet business...

 &gt; no one has mentioned what these companies 'make' from their high end
 &gt; customers, one could contend that perhaps a couple of contracts on the
 &gt; bhp, cba etc end of town do actually make their books balance, regardless
 &gt; of the not that great loss from keeping a few 'geeks:)' happy with cheap
 &gt; access.

Companies of the calibre of BHP, CBA, etc don't use ISPs who don't have
a viable business model.  They want someone who is going to give them
reliability and stability over a long-term period, and they're prepared to
pay a bit more to get that.

Even if flash-and-burn ISPs actually *offered* corporate access plans (many
don't!), why would a large corporate want to share the pipe with countless
thousands of freeloaders using up all the bandwidth?  Should you make sure
the corporate customer gets what they need by rate-limiting the dialups?  If
so, how would you feel about being one of those dialup customers?

 &gt; i'd suggest that backyard isps that go bust with unlimited bandwidth - 
 &gt; the isdn link supporting 50 modems and 250 customers &lt;G&gt; - just don't
 &gt; have the sales staff to bring in the big bikkies.
 
I think the problem is a bit more fundamental than that.  For example,
if you've reached the size where it's reasonable to run 50 modems and
you're still on an ISDN link, something is seriously wrong deep in your
organization.

I suspect that those ISPs probably run with rather worse customer-to-modem
ratios than 5-to-1 anyway :-)   (not that customer-to-modem rates mean 
diddly-squat; what's really important is whether you get a busy signal)

 &gt; lets face it, with the ridiculous cost of tv advertising, getting public
 &gt; support by offering these 'great' deals would be a drop in the ocean
 &gt; to a well managed multinational telco.

But word of mouth is cheap.
