&gt; Right -- And that's why ISPs which don't run on unprofitably cheap access
&gt; plans have so many customers:  People actually *LIKE* customer service.
&gt; They *LIKE* being able to talk to a helpdesk person who knows how to tie
&gt; shoelaces.  They *LIKE* ISPs which never, ever, ever produce busy signals.
&gt; They *LIKE* being able to have their modem call answered by modern equipment
&gt; which won't drop-out.  They *LIKE* ISPs who don't channel thousands of
&gt; users through congested upstreams.

for $25 per month my friend gets unlimited access from bigpond, 24/7 helpdesk
no busy signals ever, so how can you say it isn't feasible?

&gt; Cable and Wireless wants to sell Optus because they're not making any 
&gt; money either (among other reasons). 

can you site something here, please.. a company report or such?
nothing personal, but i just don't beleive this one.
 
&gt; in case you haven't noticed, multi-national 
&gt; telcos are not coming into Australia and selling $25 all-you-can-eat
&gt; access plans!  

time will tell

&gt; How much will you pay to use UUNet?  BigPond?  AAPT (aka connect.com.au)?

see above
 
&gt; Optus' DingoBlue is an aberration.  In fact, *OPTUS* is an aberration.
&gt; C&W want to bail out for all kinds of reasons

&gt;  &gt; we may not like it, but the
&gt;  &gt; shareholders do, and  they are not blind to the workings of markets,
&gt;  &gt; which is the reason many of them got to own shares in the first place :)
 
&gt; How naive.  Explain the .com boom to me then.

sigh

when things are going up, people buy them.  simple.  only fools expect it 
to last forever and they'd be the same ones that'd be blind to the fact that
many are overpriced.  this does not mean that they can't buy and sell the
shares in the mean time for a profit.  it's one of those situations where
the smartest will be the ones that get out just before the 'crash' or
slowing. - rivkin is supposed to be good at this kind of thing...
