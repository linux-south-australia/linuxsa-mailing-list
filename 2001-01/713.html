Martin!

Your Outlook somehow buggered up and send me something that I couldn't
easily read. You might want to investigate this because some clients or
recipients of your messages may find it difficult to read your message.
I think it has something to do with the fact that Outlook is sending a
multi-part MIME message because you may have HTML mail on...

Anyway, on to your question.

A lame server is a server that has delegation for a domain but is not
authoritive for that domain. In other words, when I lookup an address I
am referred to that server. But it's "lame" because I may or may not be
able to get the address I require...

According to the Cricket and Locust Book (O'Reilly's BIND Book) there's
not much you can do about this unless it's one of your own domains. You
could forward said message to the owner of the domain but even for what
I do I get plenty of these messages.
