e-smith are also using redhat 7.0 for their 4.1 beta and seem to be happy enough
with it.  As a server and workstation it seems to go just fine.  They do recommend
for development 6.2 though. Personally I have installed RH 7.0 and found it quite
nice.

&gt; &gt; &gt;I am interested in why you think RH7.0 is a crock.  Would you care to go
&gt; &gt; &gt;into more detail?
&gt;
&gt; I posed this question, not because I was contemplating using RH7.0 and
&gt; wanted to see what others thought, rather I was interested in why people
&gt; seem to be bagging RH 7.0.
&gt; I have commented below.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;1. Historical. RH X.0 has always had problems, and that includes 4.0, 5.0
&gt; &gt;    and 6.0.
&gt;
&gt; I agree (partially) . RH 5.0 sucked.  RH 6.0 had install problems.
&gt; I have installed RH7.0 on quite a few machines (varied architecture) now
&gt; and haven't had a problem with it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;2. Experience. I have installed or upgraded several machines with 7.0, and
&gt; &gt;    have had some major problems, esp with:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    a- The GCC version they ship
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    b- The 2.2.16 kernel source RPM would not compile at all even with egcs.
&gt; &gt;       I had to upgrade to 2.2.18 ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    c- Which meant that I could not get VMware to work at all until I upgraded
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    d- Prior to upgrading the kernel, modules would not compile.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    e- DOCBOOK still seems broken, although DL may be overzealous in upgrading
&gt; &gt;       things.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, the interface is slick, umm, that is, the shell, which has always
&gt; &gt;been slick :-) The GUI is kinda nice as well, but I am only a user.
&gt;
&gt; I disagree with this.  Sure, there are teething problems with some small
&gt; parts of RH 7.0.  If you keep up to date with the patches as they come out,
&gt; I don't think that these problems are major enough to warrant avoiding this
&gt; version.
&gt; If we all took this attitude, who would report bugs?  Would we be waiting
&gt; 12+ months for the next release.  A little pain and suffering for the
&gt; greater good isn't that much to deal with.
&gt;
&gt; I use RH 7.0 on 3 proxy servers, 1 mail server, 1 DNS, An IMP server and
&gt; several workstations (including two laptops).
&gt; It seems to perform better than 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2.
&gt;
&gt; Of course all of the above is based on personal experience and is my opinion.
&gt; You can take it or leave it as you wish.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;My first suggestion is, don't use RH7.0. It is a crock. Use RH 6.2 and wait
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;for RH 7.1.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
