&gt;Hellooo list,

&gt;Just to throw in my 2c worth:
&gt;
&gt;Quoting Stallings[1]
&gt;"......ICMP is, in effect, at the same level as IP in the TCP/IP
&gt;architecture...."
&gt;
&gt;The IP level is one below the transport layer - the internet layer!

All this shows is that there can be many different viewpoints here.

Stallings is articulating a simplistic point of view.

However, Richard Stevens puts a similar point of view in TCP/IP
Illustrated, but he does show ICMP in different ways.

Having spent lots of time on protocols, from X.25 through to DECnet and
then later TCP/IP, and having spent lots of time dissecting protocols in
Ethereal, and having given many TCP/IP classes where I try to explain these
concepts, it is obvious that there are no clear cut answers.

One can assign protocols on the basis of which protocols they are carried
inside of, or one can assign protocols based on functionality.

Both approaches have problems ...

Assigning by layer leads to problems when one considers IP over X.25, both
of which are considered to be network layer protocols, and what about
tunneling of one protocol inside another?

However, assigning by functionality leads to other problems. For example,
X.25 looks very much like a transport layer protocol to me, not a network
layer protocol. It has end-to-end delivery guarantees and ensures that the
data arives in order with no loss of data and so forth ...

In addition, protocols like NetBIOS over TCP are effectively carried in a
null session layer that does nothing[1] ...

So, the world is complex, and I will continue to insist that one can regard
ICMP and IGMP as being at the transport layer[2], but will also insist that
ICMP is not a transport protocol.

[1] Samba uses the called name for virtual servers.  While I have recently
found out that Windows NT 4.0 can support multiple NetBIOS names, I really
doubt that they can be used to invoke different configurations, including
different domains.

[2] Since ICMP is carried directly inside of IP datagrams, with no other
headers and no concept of a null layer (CF NLPIDS and Frame Relay
encapsulation), there is merit in this.

&gt;Cheers,
