&gt; IBM, arguably make the "better" hard drives you can get. Seagates
&gt; are renound for trouble, yet I myself had not had any fail. Fujitsu
&gt; are ok as well, but having the option, the IBM is a better drive.

Are you absoultely sure you're talking about SCSI and not IDE? As far
as IDE and Segate goes, I wouldn't really know, but I can vouch for
the Segate barracuda and cheeta SCSI range, especially the cheeta.
I've got more systems than I care to remember running with segate
cheetas and the main reason I can't remember how many there are is
cause none of them have had any problems. And they are fast. VERY
fast.

The IBM's are just as good, and price wise are about the same. The
rule I use when deciding weather to go the IBM or Segate is "which one
is available now".

In other words, if the suppliers are out of one, I get the other.

I've had problems with Fujitsu drives before, but they were IDE, so
that's probably not relevant.

Also, as always, keep the high spin SCSI drives cool. If they are not
well ventilated they get VERY hot, IBM especially. (The funny thing is
that no matter how hot I've let an IBM get, they still don't fail.)

And for what it's worth, this e-mail, and every other LinuxSA e-mail
is delivered via an IBM SCSI drive.

Cheers

Alex!
