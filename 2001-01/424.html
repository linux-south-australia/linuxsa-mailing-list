&gt; You shouldn't necessarily blow off formal education - pursued properly, it
&gt; can help you to succeed.  Just don't underestimate the value of what you can
&gt; learn on your own.  Don't think for a minute that you HAVE to have a piece
&gt; of paper to succeed.  Just apply yourself to whatever it is you enjoy doing,
&gt; and do it the best that you can.  If formal education helps, great!  But if
&gt; you stop to measure your success by "papers", money or fame, you'll fall far
&gt; short of your potential.


I have done a  formal training at uni, but dont have the piece of
paper.

I am lucky I managed to find an employer who employs on the basis of
practical examination rather than a piece of paper.

However having said this, I think that the university experience was very
very very helpful.

It gives you a basic understanding of the subject matter rather than a
this is how you do this on platform x using lagnuage Y, though you do get
a _little_ bit of that too.

This is extremely helpful, I think it makes it far easier to pick up new
languages, and different approaches.
It sertainly makes it much easier to walk up to some machen and work out
how to perform some operation given teh docs, as you probably ahve some
idea baout the priciple of whatever it is you wnat to do adn hiw it works.

You still have to muddle and struggle, but I think I muddle and struggle
far less due to that foraml conceptual training.

I also think that it helps in other areas, such as the skills it gives you
in finding answers for yourself, report writing, organising your thoughts,
analysing a given scenario etc etc.

I am very glad I have that uni experience uder my belt, I doubt if I would
have the job I have now, without that formal training, even though my
employer does not require the piece of paper. 

I seriously dont think I would have learned as much in the period before I
started here, or since I have worked here, without that training.

I really think that for the majority of people those skills that you pick
up at uni as well as the basic knowledge are very useful.

I actually know a lot of people who are still at uni, or have just
finished, and once they actually start working they tend to see the value
of their courses, far more than they did at the time that they were doing
them.

Obviously the people I am talking about are doing Bachelors in IT or CS,
so I woudln't presume to comment on other fields. I feel pretty safe that
most people on this list are in fact probably thinking baout IT/CS if they
are thinking about uni.
