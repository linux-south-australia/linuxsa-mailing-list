Michael,

Here is my tale of woe.

Thinking that I would try to be better than average,
I downloaded and tried to build version 9.1.0.
But....

1.	It ran out of virtual memory while compiling on my
	old 486. It needed 13.5 MByyes while compiling.
	So I have to kill off half my processes.
	It also took over an hour to build.

2.	While installing, it overfilled my disk.
	So I went around uninstalling heaps of RPMs,
	including "vi", so that I had to re-install it from CD.

3.	There were two bugs in the 9.1. software - actually just
	incompatibilities with RedHat 5.2.
	So I had to edit two bind source files.

4.	When I ran the final named binary, it couldn't understand
	any of my config files. I wanted a TTL parameter, and
	it didn't recognize half the things in /etc/named.conf.

5.	It made 5 copies of itself while running, using a total
	of 10.7 Mbytes of memory, of which 6.5 Mbytes is resident.
	This is compared to 2 Mbytes total previously.

So the 9.1.0 bind is
-	incompatible with old config files
-	uses tens of MBytes more disk for the binaries
-	uses heaps more RAM

Hence I am now compiling 8.2.3 in the hope that I can salvage
my system.
I've pretty much spent a whole day just on this one task.
What a bother!!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  As always -- flames to /dev/null, where they belong.
