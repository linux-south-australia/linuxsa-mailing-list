&gt; I rebooted, it came up fine with the 2.2.16-3 kernel no problems
&gt; whatever,
&gt; with the 2.2.14 kernel it couldnt find the modules though??

I had a similar problem to this with my RH box at work once... IIRC, what I
did was install a new kernel using the RPM. However, I forgot to modify lilo
and re-run it. What I saw when I rebooted my machine a week or so later was
this:

old kernel booting
no modules found...

After fixing lilo, all was well... new kernel, found modules, etc...

When I looked at the fs, the old kernel was not there, and neither were its
modules. The new kernel was there, as were its modules. So why was the old
kernel booting at all? Fortunately, it still existed on disk in the same
location as previously, although without an inode, so was invisible to the
fs. Fortunately, it hadn't been written over (I had used the box for a week
or so since upgrading, remember), so still booted. Lilo obviously remembers
where the kernel is stored by remembering a physical location on the disk
(it can't use the fs structure, as it hasn't loaded the fs driver, which is
in the kernel). However, the modules are located after loading the kernel,
and rely on file names, and the fs existing... Hence, my old kernel worked,
but couldn't find any modules. After running lilo, the MBR had the location
of the new kernel, and the new kernel would load, and then look on the fs
for the modules, which existed. All turned out ok... :)

(this, BTW, explains why one can't have one's root fs driver compiled as a
module -- the kernel uses the fs to load the modules... On a related note,
it's also why /etc as a separate partition won't work -- /etc/fstab is
needed to mount the non-root partitions, which would then include /etc, so
/etc/fstab wouldn't be visible to the fs until... etc...)

hmmm....

I go to sleep now...
