Hi Mike,

&gt; &gt; One of the hallmarks of the "$25 unlimited" style of plans

&gt; 
&gt; well that narrows it down to... everyone!

Bzzt, wrong.

&gt; like who says "a free burger? nah, i'd rather pay!" ??

Actually, yes.  I do.

I'd much rather pay for a good healthy meal at a reputable
establishment that I knew was capable of delivering a quality
meal at an affordable price.

That way, I would be safe in knowning that (odds on), because
someone (me) had paid for the meal, nobody would be cutting
corners to deliver a cheap half-cooked disease infested pattie
in a 2 week old stale bun with more mould than you'd find under
a pharmacist's finger nails and browned lettuce.

&lt;exaggeration used to make a vivid point&gt;

&gt; in my expreiance they attract people who don't want to be
&gt; surprised by the occasional $100 bill that is outside their
&gt; budgets.  everyone (that pays their bills:) has to budget !
&gt; 
&gt; normal 'mum and dad' customers that don't want to learn advanced
&gt; algebra just to understand their bill for something they hardly
&gt; understand anyway.

So these would be the same people who have an unlimited phone
account with their telco, oh yes, that's right, that business
model doesn't work!  *laff*  wake up.

Paye as you use is how nearly everything in the world works,
your electricity bill, phone bill, mobile bill, water bill,
shopping bill, clothing bill, you bloody name it bill - why
on EARTH should Internet access be any different?

&gt; &gt; Companies of the calibre of BHP, CBA, etc don't use ISPs who
&gt; &gt; don't have a viable business model.
&gt; 
&gt; are you telling me that cable and wireless-optus (i gather the
&gt; former owners of dingo-blue) don't have a viable business model?

So why did they sell it?

Q.E.D.

Cheers

Leigh
