&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that I'm saying that programming should be the goal of
&gt;&gt;&gt; K-12 computing, I think understanding should be.  But
&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding thye method and limitations of programming
&gt;&gt;&gt; is part of understanding computing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; i believe some basic introductory programming would benifit those planning to go
&gt;&gt; onto a uni computer course, perhaps in C or another easier to use language.
&gt;&gt; which brings the point, that many computer teachers would have no idea, and
&gt;&gt; would need retraining.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a while ago there was a plan to get MCSE into high schools, perhaps the
&gt;&gt; governments current plans are leading to this? Would it be hard to get in first,
&gt;&gt; even if only a few schools, with the RHCE instead?? pity it costs $2500.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Without this understanding of programming, we end up with
&gt;&gt;&gt; a society that is too easily taken in by schemes for
&gt;&gt;&gt; electronic voting or missile defence systems.
&gt;
&gt; Are we talking about computing here or the use of computers in
&gt; schools?

Yes.

&gt; If we are specifically talking about computing, i.e. basic computer
&gt; science, then sure open source will be fine.
&gt;
&gt; But if you are talking about the ordinary every day use of computers in
&gt; schools ( at least in junior primary and primary schools), the usage is
&gt; not much different to business.

I'm not so much concerned about what their intention is.  I'm thinking
more about what should be happening.  By training a generation of
Microsoft operators, we're condemning them to being second-best to
people in other countries--see Richard's comments.

&gt; I.e. they use PCs to do other work.
&gt;
&gt; The PC and associated applications are not the topic themselves,
&gt; they are simply tools, like pencils and books.
&gt;
&gt; At least this is how it is in the school where my mum is k-7 librarian and
&gt; at the schools of her schoolteacher friends.
&gt;
&gt; Under this scenario it is very difficult to see open source being
&gt; particularly useful.
&gt;
&gt; Especially if you think that they might also want to prepare kids for what
&gt; they will find in the real world one day. These days what most people find
&gt; on real world PCs is word/excel/windows.

I hope that in 10 years time better things will be generally
available.  They should be training the kids for the future, not the
present.

&gt; Not only that most teachers know word/excel/windows and have enough
&gt; trouble using it, let alone learning/using another tos, particularly when
&gt; they have little interest in doing so, and probably even if they were
&gt; interested it would take them several years to get to a usable level.
&gt;
&gt; The training supplied by the dept is dismal to non existent.

OK, but we don't have to accept that as a given.

&gt; So while it is possible that they might use star office for their needs,
&gt; it is highly unlikely that it would actually happen.

I don't see any advantage in replacing Microsoft Office with Star
Office.  I'm talking about the individual's relationship with
computers.

&gt; What would be more likely is that the PCs wouldn't get used as much.
&gt; (there are still some classrooms where the PC is never turned on -
&gt; this would likely increase if you took away the OS/apps which they
&gt; have spent lots of time getting to some level of familiarity with
&gt; and told them to start again).

Not if they required it to fulfil the curriculum.

&gt; Remember a lot of teachers don't want to do PC support and don't want to
&gt; do PC training (I don't mean don't want to be trained, I mean don't want to be
&gt; PC trainers). They are not trained, equipped or interested in doing so.
&gt;
&gt; Some do  and I applaud that.
&gt; Some do under the most adverse environments, e.g. no support from
&gt; principals little peer support and few funds, policy made by schools
&gt; councils who have no understanding of IT/computers, completely self
&gt; taught, largely in their own time.
&gt;
&gt; Taking away that investment in time and skills(no matter how pitiful
&gt; these skills are) would be extremely demoralising and quite possibly
&gt; would set computer usage in schools back a few years or more.

So we don't take away that investment, we build on it (possibly
propping up a rickety structure in the process).

&gt; Especially given there is no real practical reason to do so, in the
&gt; majority of cases.
&gt; As I say if you are specially teaching "computing" is computer science/IT
&gt; principals, then sure open source would be extremely useful, possibly
&gt; indispensable once you have it and appropriately skilled teachers in
&gt; place.

Exactly.  Obviously the level of skills would be commensurate with the
fact that it's a high school and not a university, but I don't see why
kids shouldn't learn basic programming skills in school.

&gt; But for non "computing"  every day  desktop use I cant really see open
&gt; source software being all that useful.
&gt;
&gt; There is more here at stake than good philosophy.

Indeed.
