Actually, Dingoblue is good, I left internode, because of the limit on hours and
small web-page space limits and the cost of maintaining the domain name with
them. Overall I found them to be un-competitive, however, I had and still have
nothing but praise for their service and speed. I will certainly look carefully
at their DSL offerings when it arrives, but based on previous experience I'm not
sure if they will be equal to other providers on cost.

Now, with Dingoblue you are actually on the Optus network and if you sign up for
long distance calls with them you can have-
no download limits and no time limits for $27-month, yes you read it right. ZIP
d/l and no boot time. .I  can leave my modem running days on end and with my
e-smith server, it can be set to reconnect at specific times, or all the time.
Need 100mg update for your mandrake, deb, rhat, no probs, run agent click all
and go to bed and sleep without worrying about $$$$ as the megs come down or the
4hour boot... this is enough to convince me alone, in fact I would pay more for
this type of service.

So Simon, want to give us some PR on why we should use Agile rather than an
alternative?

&gt; &gt; &gt;From memory and a little experience, to get online you must use
&gt; &gt; &gt;their software. When I tried them they didnt even have support for
&gt; &gt; &gt;NT.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I suspect much is the same now for Linux. I also believe once you
&gt; &gt; &gt;close their browser it drops the connection.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;May I be rude and ask why AOL and not Ozemail/Internode etc?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have to second that question :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [pauses to think for a while, and a light goes on]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; By "AOL", I initially thought 'America OnLine'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But maybe you mean Asia Online? [which a lot of people seem to also
&gt; &gt; call 'AOL', to the huge confusion of everyone around them]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
