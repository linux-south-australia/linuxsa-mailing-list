&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the hallmarks of the "$25 unlimited" style of plans
&gt; &gt; &gt; is that they tend to attract people who have a mindset which
&gt; &gt; &gt; wants something for nothing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; well that narrows it down to... everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; Bzzt, wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; like who says "a free burger? nah, i'd rather pay!" ??
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, yes.  I do.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd much rather pay for a good healthy meal at a reputable
&gt; establishment that I knew was capable of delivering a quality
&gt; meal at an affordable price.
&gt; 
&gt; That way, I would be safe in knowning that (odds on), because
&gt; someone (me) had paid for the meal, nobody would be cutting
&gt; corners to deliver a cheap half-cooked disease infested pattie
&gt; in a 2 week old stale bun with more mould than you'd find under
&gt; a pharmacist's finger nails and browned lettuce.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;exaggeration used to make a vivid point&gt;

But internet access is different from a restaurant.
At a restaruant if a customer eats a meal, the meal is gone and cant be
replicated.

A web page and associated grepchis however can be serverd to the next
customer of an isp at very little cost, probably very close to free after
some point when the relevant equipment and cofiguration time  costs have
been recovered.

Even dynamically genrated pages have this property in many cases, as the
button bars and other images etc are all cachable.

And of course ISPs effectivelyu dont ahve to pay for local traffic with
ISPs of simlar size.

So the restaruant analogy doens not appeaar all that sound.

Of course the buigger the isp the bigger their cache and the beter
perering arrangements they are liekly ot be able to negotiate.

So it seems to me that a big isp canif they choose offer very attrractive
accounts and on avaerage still make money per user.

I an also think of at least one SA based national ISP that appears to do
this and appers to be reporting profit.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; in my expreiance they attract people who don't want to be
&gt; &gt; surprised by the occasional $100 bill that is outside their
&gt; &gt; budgets.  everyone (that pays their bills:) has to budget !
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; normal 'mum and dad' customers that don't want to learn advanced
&gt; &gt; algebra just to understand their bill for something they hardly
&gt; &gt; understand anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; So these would be the same people who have an unlimited phone
&gt; account with their telco, oh yes, that's right, that business
&gt; model doesn't work!  *laff*  wake up.
&gt; 
&gt; Paye as you use is how nearly everything in the world works,
&gt; your electricity bill, phone bill, mobile bill, water bill,
&gt; shopping bill, clothing bill, you bloody name it bill - why
&gt; on EARTH should Internet access be any different?

Well actually in mst cases your cite it is not truly user pays.
There is cross subsidisation as you pointed out on another list.

It is effectively the same with isps, I belive they perform an averaging
function.
Now I am not saying that soem isps are nto consiously runnign at a loss,
some are.

But I beleive it is possible for a large isp, the larger the better, to
amke moeny on average per user with realtviely low fix prced access
schemes with few limitation(certianly not unlimited however).

As stated above I belvie there is at least one SA based national isp who
is doing this and reportign profit.

 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Companies of the calibre of BHP, CBA, etc don't use ISPs who
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't have a viable business model.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; are you telling me that cable and wireless-optus (i gather the
&gt; &gt; former owners of dingo-blue) don't have a viable business model?
&gt; 
&gt; So why did they sell it?
&gt; 

Amongst other things internal ineffiencies.
Staff who are in sore need a the clue bat.

These are of course nto the stated reason, but these are problems that
optus has and I belive optus internet to have.
