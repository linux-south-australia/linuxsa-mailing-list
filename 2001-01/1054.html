Andrew Reid spake...
&gt; 
&gt; Hello People,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure that most of us have either seen or used Disk Druid (Used by at
&gt; least RedHat for Partitioning drives during install) during our lives,
&gt; but I had wondered wheather it is available outside Installation
&gt; Programs.
&gt; 
&gt; I would have thought that it will run, but a 20 Second search revealed
&gt; nothing besides references to Install Guides.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone either use it and know where to get it from, or recomend some
&gt; other partitioning program?
&gt; 
&gt; For the time, I am happy with fdisk, but I thought if Disk Druid is
&gt; available, I might give it a whirl (I am still impressed at how easy it
&gt; is to create RAID Partitions).
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions, comments etc. All welcomed :-)

not exactly answering your question, but:

from man fdisk..

BUGS 

	There are several *fdisk programs around.  Each has its problems
	and strengths.  Try  them  in  the  order cfdisk,  fdisk, sfdisk.
	(Indeed, cfdisk is a beautiful program that has strict requirements
	on the parti­ tion tables it accepts, and produces high quality
	partition tables. Use it if you can.  fdisk is  a  buggy program
	that does fuzzy things - usually it happens to produce reasonable
	results. Its single advantage is that it has some support for BSD
	disk labels and other non-DOS partition tables.  Avoid  it  if  you
	can.  sfdisk  is  for  hackers only - the user interface is
	terrible, but it is more correct than fdisk and more powerful than
	both fdisk and cfdisk.  Moreover, it can be used noninteractively.)

	The IRIX/SGI type disklabel is currently not supported by the
	kernel.  Moreover, IRIX/SGI header  directo­ ries are not fully
	supported yet.
