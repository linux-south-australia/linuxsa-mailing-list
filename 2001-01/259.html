Interesting stuff....

&lt;snip&gt;
		3) Last time maddog was in Adelaide we addressed a group of
experts
     	 in EDS. Yes, they let him in the door without the roof falling in.
&lt;/snip&gt;

I take it that the group of experts were technical people?? ; -)

I have nothing against technical experts in either government or EDS, as a
general rule they're all very good, but like all government/corporate
environments, its never the people on the ground floor who make decisions.
There are also a number of people in non-technical, decision-making roles
who I do have a lot of time for, however when the crucial decisions have to
be made, it never seems to be these people who make them!!
Ah well.............



		&gt; [...] Stuff about EDS in SA

		Three data points that I can add:

		   1) EDS had the first (and I believe still only) publicly
advertised
		      EDS LUG. I head that it was established when anything
to do with
		      Linux was a very serious offence nearer HQ. EDS is a
US company with
		      HQ in Texas.

		   2) The Unix group here in Adelaide are knowledgable and
free software-
		      friendly. 

		   3) Last time maddog was in Adelaide we addressed a group
of experts
		      in EDS. Yes, they let him in the door without the roof
falling in.

		There are other interesting things. If those responsible
want to talk
		about them I'm sure they will (you know who you are.)
