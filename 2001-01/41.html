&gt; In peoples opinions what are some good alround books which explain in detail
&gt; how to do a lot of this stuff with also a focus on security, using most
&gt; probably red hat 6.2 or 7 and also which would be better to go with at this
&gt; time Red Hat 6.2 or Red Hat 7??

The Linux operating system differs from Windows in treating
HTTP, SMTP and DNS as applications, not as part of the operating
system proper.

So for these services you have two choices: buy the best book for
each service, or choose a distribution that chooses the applications
for you and fudges a consistent interface.  The best books for the
BIND DNS server and the sendmail SMTP server are published by
O'Reilly.  Once you have read these, the documentation shipped
with the software is comprehensible.

The Apache HTTP server can pretty much be configured from the
documentation.

The packet filtering code is built into the Linux kernel.  This
is a packet filter, and not a stateful firewall.  It may be enough
for what you need.  Or not.  O'Reilly also have the best firewalling
book, combine this with the IP Tables HOWTOs.

As for the distribution route -- have a look at e-smith.  I've had
good reports from uni network engineers about it.

This variety of applications is the flip-side of being
able to choose the best application to supply each service.
If it bothers you, Linux has a world of consultants that
will do the configuration for a reasonable charge -- some
of those people are on this list.

And yes, paying $500 for a range of good books to configure
free software is a bit unexpected.  On the plus side, they
are good books, not re-hashed manuals.
