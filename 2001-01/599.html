To add to your argument.

Open source software has a better fit to a curriculum design.

It makes it easier to offer a range of subjects to students
and grow from using to understanding to creating.

For example, using a word processor, understanding stylesheets,
and looking behind the curtain at how the word processor throws
a menu onto the screen.

The problem with the closed-source stuff is that you can't
look behind the curtain and grow and understanding of programming
in people that are interested.  The most you can do is fiddle
with a macro language, and these are usually far removed from the
world of programming.

Not that I'm saying that programming should be the goal of
K-12 computing, I think understanding should be.  But
understanding thye method and limitations of programming
is part of understanding computing.

Without this understanding of rogramming, we end up with
a society that is too easily taken in by schemes for
electronic voting or missile defence systems.
