David!

&gt; This would have to be the most breathtaking example of contrariness that
&gt; I've heard so far all millenia.

That's a total piece of crock. I thought you were only about 40 years
old so how could you possibly have been hearing things for millenia?

&gt; He's the richest man in the world.

He'd make dang good sugar daddy then...

&gt; He's more influential than the US president.

A total piece of crock as well. He doesn't command the armed forces or
the FBI. He doesn't command the CIA. I'm not suggesting that the CIA
would assassinate him, but I'm not suggesting that they couldn't either.
Anyway, I wouldn't do what either of them told me to...

&gt; Nine out of every ten
&gt; computers operate using his software.

The proof?

&gt; He formed the company that
&gt; displaced IBM.

IBM had a business partnership with MicroSoft and IBM are still
developing hardware whilst MicroSoft are still developing something that
some call software...
 
&gt; Perhaps he's not a successful flautist?  Is that it?

How do you know?
