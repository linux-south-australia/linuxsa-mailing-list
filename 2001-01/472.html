&gt; &gt; Yes it can -- you can transport data where congestion and
&gt; &gt; corruption loss is acceptable to the application.  For
&gt; &gt; example, realtime voice, video and cricket scores (there's
&gt; &gt; a multicast channel for this).
&gt; 
&gt;  :
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So you can transmit knowing that data will reach the other end.
&gt; &gt; What you don't know is the quality of the received data.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't follow this. Here's why: how can you know anything for sure about
&gt; the success of a UDP conversation? You can assume things, like you can
&gt; with ethernet. But how can you know?
&gt; 
Surely Glen was bring up an academic point.

UDP is by definition an Unreliable data protocol (or something)

But what Glen is saying (if I may be so bold) is to disagree with the
comment that "[it] cannot transport anything with certainty[1]" and say
that you can "transport data *where data loss is acceptable* with
certainty[2]", and even employ a checking process (feedback) to make
sure that some parts actaully do make it (key video frames maybe?)

I think from a statistics POV, there is a close to zero chance that no
data will get through, therefore making [2] believable.

The difference between [1] and [2] being the quality of the data being
transmitted, not the quality of the transmission itself.

Yes, I just finished Cryptonomicon for the second time :)

The trouble with doing something right the first time is that nobody     
appreciates how difficult it was.
