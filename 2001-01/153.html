Matthew!

&gt; Not quite, the kernel doen't do anything to the filesystems.

I've gotten myself into a linguistic quagmire. s/kernel/file system
manager/ if you will...

&gt; The filesystem
&gt; itself (I assume ext2 fs or similar) keeps track of homw many times it has
&gt; been mounted.  When fsck is run in /etc/rc.d/sysinit (or similar) it goes
&gt; through all the filesytems in /etc/fstab and checks them if needed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) do start up stuff
&gt; &gt; 2) read /etc/fstab
&gt; &gt; 3) get mount counts for all file systems to be mounted
&gt; &gt; 4) determine which ones need to be fsck'ed
&gt; &gt; 5) run a parallel fsck on them all
&gt; 
&gt; So step 1,2 are already done by /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit.

Yes, I know that.

&gt; And 3,4 are done already by fsck

Not quite. If I run:

[lloy0076]# fsck

I get an error...

Someone tells fsck to do it...

&gt; The run parallel brings in a number of other issues.
&gt; 
&gt;   o Running them serial will take time.

Yes.

&gt;   o Running them purely in parallel is bad if they are on the same disk.

Yes. I hadn't taken this into account....

&gt;   o Running them in serial if they are on the same disk is the best we can do
&gt;     (to avoid thrashing the disks).

Agreed.

&gt;   o Running the disks in parallel in also fine (the bottle neck is the
&gt;     physical speed of the disk).

If there are more than one disk..

&gt; So, what happens is exactly that.  The partitions are ordered by physical
&gt; disk and each list run concurrently.

Oh, I see.

&gt; So all in all your situation can't be improved much using existing
&gt; 2.2 filesystems.  The fsck time for journaling filesystems might be
&gt; different - YMMV.

Your Milage May Vary?

&gt; The last thing that might be an option is getting 2-4 smaller disks and
&gt; running large partitions.

Oh but there are some who INSIST on making HUGE / partitions....
