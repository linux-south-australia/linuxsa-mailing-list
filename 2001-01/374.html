James Mclean spake...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; David & All,
&gt; 
&gt; i am 19, and i have setup many linux machines from 486's to my laptop and
&gt; i believe i have a good grasp of the install process. i have been through
&gt; the kernel panics and recompiles associatedwith it.
&gt; 
&gt; many a time i have re-installed because i felt like playing with
&gt; partitions etc.
&gt; 
&gt; i have many books, from programming to idiots guides to some of the
&gt; unleashed books, to web-design and php.
&gt; 
&gt; i am currently implimenting my home page in php4 & mysql, and also
&gt; building my own gateway/webserver/firewall connected to a Linux/Windows
&gt; 10baset network. i have worked in web design places, but i really want to
&gt; be a sysadmin which needs a piece of paper!!i believe i have as much
&gt; skill and experience as many of you do (perhaps not the sysadmin types,
&gt; of course), but only having that certificate under your arm proves that.

You don't need a piece of paper.  I'm living proof, if you need it - I've
been in Systems Administration for 4 years, after 1 year of doing clerical
work, straight after leaving school.  I'm good at my job too - a damn sight
better than [insert really high percentage here] of MCSE, or other
certificate, -holding sysadmins.

I got my jobs because I'm good at what I do, and because I understand
exactly what I'm doing, and because I understand what my employers need,
and at the same time understand what my employers don't understand.  And
because I really enjoy it :)  Power and creativity, all in one .. cool!

&gt; i can do all of the common tasks, but until i have that certificate, no
&gt; go!

Are you saying this because you actually believe it, or because you're
trying to provoke a response?  :)

&gt; i have intentionally bought & setup network equipment, set up samba,
&gt; php4 and mysql'd my web site, killed 486's celerons and the like, all in
&gt; the name of learning. TAFE is shit house, i have leart 100 times more
&gt; stuff tinkering with and killing my network, breaking programs at home
&gt; that TAFE could have taught me!  i hardly use samba, but i can say i have
&gt; set it up, and know how to use and administer it. this is the reason
&gt; why!!

Get a job as a generic computer guy somewhere, and you'll know what to
do from there.  Just go out and do it.  If you have the skills you say you
have, and I'm sure you do, and you have a real, honest, sincere interest
and love for the work, you can't fail.  (You also have to believe you can't
fail ;)

&gt; anyway, my two cents worth, why the current education system sucks.

IT is too all-over-the-place at the moment.  It will settle down - god
knows when though.  Until it does, we can all enjoy the opportunities chaos
so frequently brings :)


Cheers,

Nick
