&gt; 
&gt; I disagree. People who are teachers generally are reasonably intelligent
&gt; people. Whilst I'm not, of course, suggesting they all could achieve
&gt; membership of Mensa, but they are certainly not incapable of learning
&gt; how to use a new GUI. If you put a teacher used to Windows on a
&gt; Macintosh 9.X system they can generally use the system; if you put a
&gt; teacher used to Windows on GNOME or KDE with some icons on the desktop
&gt; and so forth I'm sure they'll be able to use the system.
&gt; 

Firstly usign gnome does not actually get much work done.
Moving fiel a to directory x sinto in itslef all taht useful ona day to
day basis teaching say  geography, english, art  or history.

Secondly I actaully wonder how many teachers you actually know, or how
much work you have done in schools.

As alluded to I actually know quite a few  teachers persoanlly, and ahve
acctually worked in s=chools which on the face of it shoudla vhe extremely
ocomputer literate staff and students - but haven't.

&gt; They may have trouble but as you've noted they're having trouble any
&gt; way. No matter what O/S you run you're going to have users who "have
&gt; trouble" with it and the tools available for it.

Yes so what make it harder?


&gt; &gt; The trainging supplied by the dept is dismal to non existant.
&gt; 
&gt; Research and Development in Australia - private and Government - is
&gt; dismal. I can't disagree with you there.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So whiel it is possible that they might use star office for tehre needs,
&gt; &gt; it is highly unliekly tht it woudl actually ahppen.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm begininning to think that you are more pessimistic than I am. If too
&gt; many people took this particular attitude then it would never happen. 


Oh it may well happen but onlyu afer wider acceptance inthe genral
community in particualr, business, tertiay education institutions and
maybe gonverment.

Until then I cant see it.

Simply not enough motiviation or support/trained personel.


&gt; &gt; What would be more likely is that the PCS woudl nto get used as much.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that such a bad thing?

Yes.

&gt; &gt; (tehre are still some classrooms where the PC is never turned on - this
&gt; &gt; woudl liekly increase if you took away teh OS/apps which they have spent
&gt; &gt; lots of time getting to some level of familiarity with  and told them to
&gt; &gt; start again).
&gt; 
&gt; In such a classroom I would hazard the guess that it wouldn't matter.
&gt; They're not going to learn anyway. On the other hand, they may have just
&gt; concluded that Windows is not stable enough for their use - and I know
&gt; teachers who refuse to use their networks and prefer to take work home
&gt; because their Windows based networks fail constantly.

Stability tends not the be the issue, it is complexity/and or a total lack
of interest.

&gt; 
&gt; This situation doesn't prevent the installation of another operating
&gt; system. What it needs is meaningful discussion with the teachers and the
&gt; offering of appropriate training. It also requires the offering of a
&gt; useful, stable system no matter what O/S it's running.

Which is not likely to be forthcoming. As it is not now.

What is it you actually think 8 years odls do with computers? or 10 years
olds, or 5 year olds?
 
10 year olds and older sure I can see them using linux I cna see them
programing if interested.

But for a 7 year old? With a techer who can only just change defautl fonts
in word who ahs taken 2 years to get to that point and is not actaully
that interested or encourraged to be interested anyway?


&gt; &gt; Remember a lot of teachers dont want to do PC support and dont want ot
&gt; &gt; do PC training(I dont mean dont want to eb trained, I mean dont want ot be
&gt; &gt; PC trainers). They are not trained, equipped or interested in doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with you there. But that is an human resource, operational
&gt; issue. You could, for example, determine the teachers who do want to do
&gt; PC support, develop a job description of "area IT support teacher",
&gt; increase allowances and base pay rates to reflect their new level of
&gt; responsibility and everyone is happy. This has absolutely nothing to do
&gt; with the operating system on hand.


Yes but it is oen that is not likelly to be resolved. 

Currenlty what happensis this.
They get sent a few resumes fromt eh local TAFE IT course and get told to
pick one amongst a few schools(the exact numder of schools varies with
how many students each school has and how "disadvantaeg" they are).

They then get to choose one for these TAFE graduates who are quite
posouibly fresh from school with no expereinece themsevles and who tehn
inherent say 2 or 3 networks with 50-100 PCs on each network and basically
cant lose their job for 2 years. Ie teh support tehy get is basically from
create a job to reduce unemployment statistics type schemes.


&gt; In fact, reading between the lines what you're saying is that it doesn't
&gt; happen now. So what will change if it doesn't happen in the future?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some do under the most adverse environemnts, eg no support from
&gt; &gt; princiapals little peer support and few funds, policy made by schools
&gt; &gt; counclis who have no understanfdign of IT/computers, completely self
&gt; &gt; taught, largely in their own time.
&gt; 
&gt; We, as a user group, should reach out to these people and offer our
&gt; support. We may not be able to proffer them Linux but there are so many
&gt; people here who understand:

But you dant want to offer support, you want to offer conversion.
Ie you will help but only if they adopt your "religion".


&gt; * TCP/IP
&gt; * Security issues
&gt; * DNS
&gt; * Real-world business experience in IT

You are off your rocker. They dont now what tcp/ip is and dont care, that
is not what they need in the classrom generally - well it is not what they
need most.

The poitnis tehy dotn want ot know.
They are not computer teachers tehy are noraml teachers who teach basic
stuff, english, maths etc.
They dont for the most part teach CS and dont want to.
They dont want to supprot a TCP/IP network and make it work.
It they did they would have done CS courses.

&gt; And the list goes on. For example, using a combination of a few Linux
&gt; box's and a few Windows box's you can teach people about all of the
&gt; above things; for the audience we'd probably lean towards the Windows
&gt; side of things and how well it can integrate with a different O/S. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Taking away that investment in time and skills(no matter how ptiiful these
&gt; &gt; skills are) would be extermely demoralising and quite possibly would set
&gt; &gt; computer usage in schools backa  few years or more.
&gt; 
&gt; Losing the opportunity to help these people develop real world skills
&gt; with a variety of Operating Systems - including Windows, Mac OS &lt; X, Mac
&gt; OS X, the *BSD's, Linux, BeoS - because someone is so pessimistic to not
&gt; even try is worse. Much, much worse.


But they dont need to learn every oS under the sun.
They probably dont want to, they get ocnfuesed enough with one.


&gt; &gt; As I say if you are specially teachign "computing" is computer sicnese/IT
&gt; &gt; principals, tehn sure open source woudl be extermely useful, possibly
&gt; &gt; indispensible once you have it and appropriately skilled teachers in
&gt; &gt; place.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But for non "compuiting"  every day  desktop use I cant really see open
&gt; &gt; source softewware beign all that useful.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree. All O/S's have their places including Linux and it doesn't
&gt; have to be on the server side. Let's see:
&gt; 
&gt; * Office Style Stuff
&gt;  - Open Office
&gt;  - Star Office
&gt;  - KOffice

Like I said so they abandon years of hard earned "skills" just to make a
few hundred linuxsa people happy?

They abandon the collective work of their students because theise
prodiucts typcially do nto falwlessy import word docs,a dn they learn an
entirly new os/interface adn applcaiiton just to do what they already do
with (typically) lesser tools?

Makes sense.

How about we few hundred  abandon(temporarily for
the period we commit ourselves to help) our deals and go and help out with
teaching/supporting them in/de mystifying them whatever it si they already
have?
(I wont change what I do , because I am already doing this)

&gt; 
&gt; If you really insist on using MS products, I think that the Unix version
&gt; of IE still exists. I've never been able to get it to build on my Linux
&gt; system, but there seems to be people who have. And what's wrong with the
&gt; others?

I dont use many MS products, I use linux most of the day every work day.

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, much more. To finish, I'll quote from Jekyll & Hyde the Musical:
&gt; 
&gt; "We have the chance to take charge of our fate
&gt; Deep down we must know tomorrow's too late
&gt; One rule of life we cannot rearrange
&gt; The only thing constant is change
&gt; The only thing constant is change..."
&gt; 
&gt; And, may we all strive to make things change for the better!

Yes but sometimes you have to work in smaller increments.
Over greater time periods.
