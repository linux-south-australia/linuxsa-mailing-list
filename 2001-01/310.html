Peter!

&gt; i.e. the X screens are large and coarse and need to be dragged around
&gt; the screen in order to view all information on the screen.
&gt; I think it is defaulting to the lowest settings i.e. 640*420

It's probably no more difficult than reading HTML e-mail which just
rendered itself pink on white (1) but you are correct in your
assumption. X tries not to kill screens as far as possible and if it
can't work out what you've got it goes to the lowest common
denominator...

&gt; Graphics controller: S3 Savage IX Multi Display Adaptor
&gt; Video memory: 8MB 100MHz SGRAM
&gt; LCD display panel 14.1-inch 1024 * 768 (XGA, 18 bit color)
&gt;  *** Note 18 bit color, Windows seems to be able to use 32 bit color
&gt; OK ***

Yep.

I see you've installed RedHat 7.0 which means you'll probably have to
ferret in the text configuration file unless they've managed to roll
XF86Setup (a graphical setup program) into the distribution...it's worth
having a look.

&gt; What do I need to do to get X to display in the correct resolution?

Well:

* try xvidtune (but don't set go overboard with it)
 - once you've worked out what your LCD display likes, then muck around
with Xconfigurator to set it permanently

* try looking at /etc/X11/XF86Config
 - back it up before you do anything
 - look for monitor lines, card lines and so forth
 - the documentation (I think it's in that directory too) should help
you
