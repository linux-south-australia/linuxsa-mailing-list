&gt;&gt; However, assigning by functionality leads to other problems. For example,
&gt;&gt; X.25 looks very much like a transport layer protocol to me, not a network
&gt;&gt; layer protocol.
&gt;
&gt;X.25 is a transport layer protocol.  It's just not a useful one: it
&gt;has slow setup times, addressing that is not necessarily global and
&gt;per flow charges.

Well, all the doco I have ever seen labels X.25 as a network layer protocol.

&gt;The link layer is HDLC, the OSI protocol in the LAP-B family.
&gt;The physical layer is synchronous serial, this was specified
&gt;down to the connector level, which is where the V.35 connector
&gt;appeared.

Bloody aweful connector as well. Anyway, you are saying, then, that X.25
does not have a network layer?

&gt;You used to see terminals directly connected to an X.25 network.
&gt;These would then place calls to servers running applications like
&gt;the Dialog search engine.
&gt;
&gt;You could buy X.25 switches (with synchronous serial interfaces
&gt;running from 9.6Kbps to 48Kbps) and a terminal server called
&gt;an X.29 PAD (packet assembler/disassembler).
&gt;
&gt;Telcos rolled out X.25 networks with these sort of applications
&gt;and devices in mind.
&gt;
&gt;As the Internet became popular it made sense to place X.25
&gt;calls between IP routers and tunnel IP packets over X.25.  It
&gt;wasn't called "tunnelling", as that word didn't appear
&gt;until later.
&gt;
&gt;One of the tragedies of the Australian networking component
&gt;industry was that a few powerful individuals promoted X.25
&gt;as a transport layer well after it was apparent that TCP/IP
&gt;was more useful.  So Australia ended up making some of the
&gt;world's best X.25 switches, just as they were becoming
&gt;irrelevant.
&gt;

&gt;Glen
