David!

&gt; There is no qualification that would satisfy me, other than experience.
&gt; I learned by doing.  I think that's the only way, but some people will
&gt; have a different view on the matter.

I agree with you wholeheartedly here except there are many
financially-unchallenged businesses who are willing to pay for people
who have pieces of people, despite the fact these are the same
businesses who will complain they can't afford to buy more electricity,
raise wages and other similar fiscal issues.

There is, I believe, a balance between practical, applied learning which
you allude to and theoretical learning. In my opinion our academic
institutions - especially the Universities - can't get things right.
They seem to be either "applied XYZ" but no theory - so a person can,
for example, be ABLE to set up NT Server to serve a site serving
millions but not WHY it works OR they lean the other way and land you
with all theory and NO hands on.

Personally, I learned by:

* doing

I installed linux and I reinstalled it at least 40 times before I was
satisfied I knew how to install it. There are some who don't have the
time or patience so a course may help them. But you can only see install
dramas for yourself if you are watching one...

* reading

I have a rather large collection of computer books, mainly O'Reilly
based but some "Unleashed" series. To the unaware, the O'Reilly books
will make more sense if you know Linux or you have at least attempted
and failed to implement their subject. They are excellent books and they
tend to cover their subjects in great detail, but the downside is that
you can accidentally miss the wood for the trees.

* asking this list and other lists

Believe it or not I've suffered my own uncalld for flames too. I still
have a glitch with the "RTFM" without telling people where the manual is
or how to access it. Sometimes people don't read manuals simply because
they have no idea it exists...the caveat to talking on a list like this
is:

a) there's bound to be someone who will kill you if you send your email
in HTML format
b) just because it's email doesn't mean people turn off their sense of
humour - but almost everyone has no sense of humour when they read what
they get

And a host of other problems. My own solution to these weaning problems
is to give as good as you get :-)

* watching

Go to the LinuxSA meetings and if you get the chance to see a "live"
system - whether it's a business system or just your next door
neighbours - ask. And don't STOP asking...how are you supposed to learn
about things if you don't know or won't ask about them? Although you may
strike a blast of sarcasm, arrogance or someone just being plain
patriotic, if you ignore the connotation and read what they actually SAY
you might find some gems of wisdom (1)...

As I said before, James. Just go and do it and come running to us when
you encounter the first thing you don't understand and can't work out
how to fix...

I maintain I generally always answer the question, or alternatively keep
on topic in a lateral manner of thinking at all times...
