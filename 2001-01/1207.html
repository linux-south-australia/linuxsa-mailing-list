Hi.

I switched from Tanberg 1/4" SCSI 1.2Gb tape to Sony DAT a year or so ago.
The drives are used for database backup in linux boxes every working day,
and I have yet to have a failure. I did have one drive that went awol
until we rebooted the box (it was confused, wouldn't release the tape),
and I've had 1 tape cartridge die on me. I think I have about 7 drives in
circulation. 

Certainly price comes into the DLT vs DAT equation. Not only are the
drives a lot more expensive, but you can buy a bootload of DAT tapes for
the cost of a set of DLT tapes. I would expect the DLT drives to be
superior for the price.

Greg, how did you get DAT drives for $70 ? The best price I see around is
just under $1000 for a namebrand DDS2...

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At one of my sites we are experiencing problems with Travan style tape
&gt; &gt; drives ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We use them every day with Amanda, and we have seen two Travan drives give
&gt; &gt; up in the last two months.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We are considering a move to DAT or DLT.  DLT is more expensive than DAT,
&gt; &gt; but has twice the capacity: 40GB uncompressed vs 20GB uncompressed (DDS4),
&gt; &gt; but is somewhat more expensive (not quite twice ...).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What have been the experiences with these devices out there, especially
&gt; &gt; where they are used (written to) each day?
&gt; 
&gt; I've found DDS hardware to be very short-lived.  I bought a job lot of
&gt; 3 DDS-2 drives in America about a year ago (USD $70 each), and one is
&gt; already dead (you can have it and play around if you want; maybe some
&gt; serious head cleaning would help).  I think the DDS drives are
&gt; becoming more reliable with increasing version number, though: the
&gt; DDS(-1) drives I had years ago lasted less than 6 months.  I also have
&gt; a DDS-4 drive here which is 8 months old and hasn't died yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have a refurbished Quantum DLT-4000 (20 GB native).  It hasn't
&gt; died either, but I haven't used it as much.
&gt; 
&gt; In general, I'm very mistrustful of any kind of tape drive.  From what
&gt; I've heard, DLT has the best reputation for reliability.
