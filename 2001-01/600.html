&gt; Not that I'm saying that programming should be the goal of
&gt; K-12 computing, I think understanding should be.  But
&gt; understanding thye method and limitations of programming
&gt; is part of understanding computing.

i believe some basic introductory programming would benifit those planning to go
onto a uni computer course, perhaps in C or another easier to use language.
which brings the point, that many computer teachers would have no idea, and
would need retraining.

a while ago there was a plan to get MCSE into high schools, perhaps the
governments current plans are leading to this? Would it be hard to get in first,
even if only a few schools, with the RHCE instead?? pity it costs $2500.

&gt;
&gt; Without this understanding of rogramming, we end up with
&gt; a society that is too easily taken in by schemes for
&gt; electronic voting or missile defence systems.
