David!

&gt; My first question relates to that wonderful browser, Netscape, and it's
&gt; beautiful (thick sarcasm) e-mail system.

Your netscape problem is odd. What type of system are you running
(distro, netscape version, RAM etc)?

&gt; My second queary relates to Mozilla, in a failed attempt to fix my email
&gt; problem I've installed Mozilla 0.6 (I've also tried build 18), now it
&gt; seems to work ok'ish, and in principle it's a great browser to use, my
&gt; worry with it is that it seems to use about 8 times the memory of
&gt; Netscape!! thus sucking up all of my systems meager resources. I just
&gt; downloaded the 'full installer' and followed the clear directions. Has
&gt; anyone else had this problem or have I stuffed up big time without
&gt; knowing it?

No. Mozilla is a memory hog. Even if you dump 50% of its "reported"
memory (as shared memory between itself) it still rivals X
itself...Mozilla is a good program. It's reasonably robust (provided you
avoid mail like the plague, don't use Java and certainly don't use
JavaScript)and it performs well on a 650MHZ Athlon with 385 MB of memory
and a TNT2 Ultra/32Mb.

Or to put it another way, its performance is just CRAP...

I use it because I have the resources to make it APPEAR to go reasonably
fast (1) just as I do with Star Office 5.2 (1)...

DL

(1)

In comparison to other GTK+ based programs, or programs that don't use
an XML specification to draw themselves (Mozilla uses some thing called
XUL to render itself, which, from what I've gleaned is an XML
specification for how it actually draws itself. The glitch is that is
also uses something VERY slow [read Java of some type] to speak to the
underlying graphics system). Let's just say that Mozilla and Star Office
should not be used with less than 128Mb of RAM and a 366MHZ
processor....

Otherwise, well, I suspect your performance in comparison to a Windows
based brower or MS Office will fall in favour of Windows (2)

(2)

MS Office, although it is definite bloatware, doesn't behave half as
idiotically as Star Office...and on another gripe...Java only runs
sensibly on Windows or Mac OS...trying to get an X Browser under Linux
to run Java or even Java Script is difficult, to impossible (3)

(2)

Java is crap. Period.
