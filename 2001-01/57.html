Subject: lca 'early-bird' discounts extended to Jan 6

 /* please forward appropriately */

We, the organisers of linux.conf.au, being fundamentally nice people,
have decided to extend the time for the 'early-bird' discount such that
it continues until this Saturday, the 6th of January.

                <A HREF="http://linux.conf.au/register/">http://linux.conf.au/register/</A>

What this means for those who have not yet registered is that you will
still get last year's 'early-bird' prices if you register this week.

What this means for those of you who have already registered is that you
may continue, guiltlessly, to encourage your friends and associates to
accompany you.

What this means for us (the organisers) is that we have allowed ourselves
to recover peacefully from New Year's celebrations. Surely a winning
situation all around.

As a reminder, the 'early-bird' prices are:

        $99  for students
        $250 for hobbyists (LUG members, etc)
        $540 for the full Professional rate.

After this weekend these registration prices will each be raised by a
'late fee' of $50. Please be assured that this is not an irrational act
of spitefulness, we need to meet our own costs in a timely manner and
your prompt payment is appreciated. We are nice people, after all :)

Everyone attending will have full access to the four days of conference
sessions, including all the tutorials, all the paper presentations, all
the keynotes, all the Birds of a Feather meetings ... and the pub crawl.

The prices really are as low as we could possibly make them. Remember
that this is not a trade show, and this is not an 'Expo'. This is a
developers conference, where you hear about free software from the
people who wrote it and have ample opportunity to talk to them in detail
about it.


Full details of the topics to be presented are at:

        <A HREF="http://linux.conf.au/papers/">http://linux.conf.au/papers/</A>

including people such as:

        John 'maddog' Hall of Linux International (dinner speaker)

        Alan Cox (UK): kernel guru, outlining secret plans for 2.4
        Dave Miller (USA): kernel networking guru
        Andrew Tridgell (Oz): creator of Samba, rsync, hacking TiVo
        Rasterman (Oz, in USA): Enlightenment, hardware accelerated X11
        Rik van Riel (NL, in Brazil): kernel memory management
        Richard Gooch (Oz, in Canada): devfs, and a new init system


Registration information is at:

Online registration, for Visa, Mastercard and Bankcard is at:

A schedule of events (including social events!) is at:

Only two weeks to go! We look forward to seeing you there.

Have a Happy New Year,

Conrad.
