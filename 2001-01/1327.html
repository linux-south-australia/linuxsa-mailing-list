	Hmmm and a double hmmm.  After, trying to dechiper the documentation
re granting access rights for MYSQL I seem to have stuffed up the password
option even for root.  Now its seems even root has lost access (without the
appropriate password).  Unfortunately, after many hours and cups of coffee
(or was that cheap cask red wine) I think I entered some commands
incorrectly and now, nutting?  I've tried all combinations of commands that
I did with the password (I know, I know I should have stayed away from this)
but can't get root on (this sounds vaguely crude).

	Now I want to somehow (in reasonable layman's terms) get to the
grant table and check how to change the permissions.  Or, do I need (or
would it be better) to  re install mysql or linux or something?

	Just a quick note re documentation.  This covers most things linux.
Why is the documentation to most things so damn difficult to understand.  It
seems that unless one has a strong unix background or is an experienced
techie, geek, sysadmin or whatever, then one is constantly behind the linux
8 ball.  I don't mind trying to understand some things but it really annoys
me when a great deal of the docs seem to presume an in-depth understanding
of all things unix/linux.  I think the next real linux revolution will begin
when people can access low level tutorials on linux which steps you through
a process.  I know this is hand holding and may be difficult to do with the
many different flavours, but bugger me if most newbies don't go through the
same learning curves.  I also appreciate that much of the docs are written
by dedicated users who may not have the time or expertise to create easy to
use lessons. Am I just asking too much and is it that only by sweating true
linux blood all over my keyboard (or was that a glass of cheap red wine that
I just spilt) will I ever get to understand the beast within (within linux
that is). Did I say this was a quick note? 

	Oh well, flame away, it's just that as a dedicated end user and not
a real, or even false, geek or programmer who wants to be rid of the M$ trap
I find that some times the learning curve one needs to achieve is costing me
many hours of lost sleep and mucho red wine, and hey I guess every cloud has
its silver lining.

&gt; Hi There!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; attempting to create a database as a user but get an access denied
&gt; message
&gt; &gt; whenever I try and do something.  If I log on as su I get full access to
&gt; &gt; mysql.  I tried giving the /usr/share/mysql directory full permissions
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; all by issuing a chmod cmd, but still can seem to get access as a user.
&gt; Any
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, that's not a UNIX problem. The MySQL database has its own
&gt; authorisation scheme and doesn't let just any user log onto it and
&gt; access the data. Why don't you goto <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</A> and check out
&gt; their rather hefty documentation? Look especially for terms such as
&gt; "security", "authorisation". If you've got a later version you will need
&gt; to use the "GRANT" SQL statment.
&gt; 
&gt; You'll also find a host of links to various projects from that address.
&gt; You could also try searching on MySQL on (<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/">http://freshmeat.net/</A>). MySQL
&gt; has been bound to virtually every modern language available (PERL, C,
&gt; PHP, C++) and has many tools to access it other than the ones that come
&gt; with it. In fact, the little frontend that comes with it is really just
&gt; a test example of what it can do.
&gt; 
&gt; You could lookup a book called "MySQL" by publisher New Riders. It's
&gt; very good. But the documentation should be fine as well - it's not quite
&gt; as polished as the book (i.e. it's written by programmers and I think
&gt; it's undergone translation to English) but it's technically correct.
