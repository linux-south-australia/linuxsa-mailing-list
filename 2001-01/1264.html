&gt; The online registration payment page at <A HREF="http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/">http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/</A>
&gt; downright refuses to let you in if you're running linux, your
&gt; browser must tell their server that it's running MacOS or windows. 
&gt; 
&gt; The government's defence for this is that the site is in beta, and
&gt; they can't possibly be expected to support all OS's. Oddly enough,
&gt; this site has been in 'beta' for nearly 3 years now. Ecommerce sites
&gt; everywhere else work with most browsers, leave it up to the
&gt; powers-that-be to choose a system that relies on a specific OS..
&gt; 
&gt; To rub salt into the wound, the error page
&gt; (<A HREF="http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/Ecomm/BadBrows.html">http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/Ecomm/BadBrows.html</A>) tells me to
&gt; 'upgrade' my operating system to suit their site..

The icing on the cake with this one, is that the web site only
operates from 5:30am to midnight, Monday to Friday. Furthermore you
can't register anything other than a bog standard alpha numeric car.
(Not sure about motorcycles). I can't use the service, cause I use
Linux, I have a custom numberplate and I register my cars on the
weekend.

However...

It is entirely possible that they could be onto something, so for a
trial period of two weeks the Linuxsa Mail server will only operate
from 05:30 to Midnight, Weeknights, and you can only ask questions
that appear in the Linux FAQ.

OK?

Cheers

Alex!
