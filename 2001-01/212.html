&gt;&gt; How do you know it is DOS?

&gt; I turned one off and on:
&gt; 
&gt; Starting MS-DOS etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Loading HIMEM.SYS

I'm pretty certain that this is the startup sequence from Robocop
(no, really! :-).  The old arcade game emulated this bit as well.

The 'net has many pictures of BSOD'ed ATM machines (probably
already mentioned earlier in the thread; my email has been
very spotty recently).

As an aside:  a company I did some work for recently had an smallish
ISDN PABX installed (NEC Xen?), and it came with an EULA for MS-DOS
6.2 while simultaneously boasting about its high-tech features[1].
This included a UI so cryptic that end users aren't allowed to
program them at all.

[1] MS-DOS 6.2 is a bitch to ROM - from memory, DR-DOS would've been a
    better choice, or no DOS at all.  I couldn't see them using much in
    the way of "DOS features", since it was an total embedded solution.
