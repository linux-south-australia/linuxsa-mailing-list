I wholeheartedly apologize for continuing this thread, but I really feel a
point is being missed, here.  (I solemnly swear I won't touch this thread
again...)

&gt; &gt; &gt; As linux people you above all should know the value of choice,
&gt; &gt; &gt; freedom and individual preferences.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no absolute right and wrong here, there is just choice and
&gt; &gt; &gt; preferential learning style.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think you have missed the point here Steve.  The original
&gt; &gt; theme concerned whether a person could be a better sysadmin with
&gt; &gt; or without formal training, and whether employers might be well
&gt; &gt; advised to choose the unqualified person.

No, the original theme was concerning whether you need "a piece of paper
under your arm" to prove you are a valuable sysadmin.  So far, I've had two
sysadmins work under me that had no piece of paper, but were damned good at
what they did.  The results of their work was proof enough.

I don't think anyone is suggesting to avoid formal training.  It's just that
people shouldn't be blown off simply because they didn't have the privilege
to afford the time and money to obtain it.  And note that formal training
usually lags a ways behind the leading edge of technology.

&gt; &gt; IF the only person who could possibly suffer from your ignorance
&gt; &gt; is you, then sure - learn any way you like.  However, a sysadmin
&gt; &gt; can do serious damage to their employer and the jobs that employer
&gt; &gt; offers. In that case, qualifications which ensure minimal damage
&gt; &gt; being done would seem an essential first requirement for the
&gt; &gt; employers choice of sysadmin.

But, unfortunately, I've never seen a degree offered in "common sense".

I would agree that successful completion of formal training is a strong and
helpful indicator, but making it a "first requirement" is exactly what I
would argue against.  It shouldn't be any kind of requirement.

It's dangerous for a manager or administrator to put too much trust on
"pieces of paper" during the hiring process.  The piece of paper does not
guarantee that the person won't royally screw up your network.  And the lack
of one doesn't mean the person is not qualified.  You need to take into
account all aspects of a person's education, experience and disposition to
determine whether they deserve a chance to prove themselves.  I've always
been amazed at how much discovery of a person's potential happens DURING the
interview.

If you throw out a resume just because it doesn't indicate the right "piece
of paper", God help you stay competitive in Information Systems.
