&gt; Subject: Re: IBM and Intel push copy protection ... (Gilmore, RISKS-21.17)
&gt; 
&gt;   [Received via Dave Farber, whom Patrick had requested to post a correction.]
&gt; 
&gt; Content protection technology misinformation generates negative web-press
&gt; coverage:
&gt; 
&gt; An article on *The Register* website "Stealth plan puts copy protection into
&gt; every hard drive" contains false information that the 4C's (Intel, IBM, MEI,
&gt; Toshiba) Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) is to be applied to
&gt; all PC hard drives.  It is misinterpreting a specification for use of CPRM
&gt; with the Compact Flash media format (which supports either semiconductor
&gt; flash memory or IBM microdrives) probably because Compact Flash uses the
&gt; same command protocol interface as standard PC harddrives.  The technology
&gt; is neither intended nor licensed for use with PC harddrives and is optional
&gt; even for the supported media types (flash memory and microdrives). John
&gt; Gilmore, a noted privacy and consumer advocate, has picked up the article
&gt; and further propagated the erroneous information and mentioned Intel
&gt; "IBM&Intel push copy protection into ordinary disk drives".  I have alerted
&gt; public relations at Intel and are disseminating accurate information within

But further articles at "The Register" suggest that the changes are proposed
changes to the ATA spec, not the ATAPI spec, so it any ATA X.Y-compliant device
(for whatever versions of X and Y) will have CPRM built-in, independent of
whether the "original intention" was to include it in non-removeable media or
not.

The guys at "The Register" also had an article suggesting that the 4C's went
into damage control with lots of similar email clarification and that they
weren't convinced that the problem was going away despite the clarifications.
