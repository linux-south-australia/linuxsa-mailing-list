&gt; &gt; It doenst mean it is transport, there are four other layers you can
&gt; &gt; choose above transport in the the OSI mdoel an 2 you can choose in the
&gt; &gt; TCP/IP model that are about network layer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just because it is above layer 3 doesnt mean it is layer 4.
&gt; 
&gt; true. But it is also clearly not application, not presentation and not
&gt; session. :)

No argument from hme thre, I was just sayign your stated reason for your
conclusion seemd a little short on logic.


I have read that somepeopel consider ICMP to be network level as it is
used to deal with networklevel idssues, but quite clearly it does nto fit
into any  of the common network architecture layers simply.

I have a problem with teh idea of it being a transport level layter
because it does not  tranpsort anything.

I have also read some comentaries that suggest that the transport layer
shoudl rpvide end to end relaible connections, which is celarly not the
case with ICMP, or UDP.

I dont nexcessarily agree with these comentaries, but it just adds that
much more confusion to what was iuntil this pioint a nice clear debate.

&gt; interestingly, the RFC referenced earlier says:
&gt; 
&gt;    "ICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher
&gt;    level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP, and
&gt;    must be implemented by every IP module."
&gt; 
&gt; The best thing that has been said so far was someone who said earlier that
&gt; TCP/IP does _not_ fit into the ISO's OSI 7 layer model. This is pretty much
&gt; universally agreed on. TCP/IP gets described as anything from 3 to 5 layers,
&gt; and these layers do _not_ neatly fit into the OSI model. As Glen said, ICMP
&gt; does Network Layer type things, but is carried on a Network Layer Protocol
&gt; (IP).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the original question is answered, and clarified below, using ASCII
&gt; art (why? because I can, and it's great for procrastinatory purposes):
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; an IP Packet (X means "stuff that isn't presently relevant", and each
&gt; tab-stop is four bits:
&gt; 
&gt; Bits:
&gt; 0								31
&gt; |	|	|	|	|	|	|	|	|
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |  X	|  X	|	X	|		X		|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |		X		|  X	|	  X		|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |  X	|  X	|  Protocol	|		X		|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |			Source Address			|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |			 Dest Address			|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |			X			|	X	|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |	Data...						|
&gt; :								:
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Notes:
&gt; 
&gt; Protocol -- This is a number that is found in /etc/protocols. If the data
&gt; section is TCP, then this number is 6, if it's ICMP, it's 1, and there are
&gt; others...
&gt; 
&gt; Source and Destination Addresses -- These are IP addresses. Note that there
&gt; are no ports.
&gt; 
&gt; Data -- the contents of the IP packet, interpreted using the number in the
&gt; Protocol part of the IP header.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now, a UDP packet is carried entirely within the data section of an IP
&gt; packet, looks like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |  Src Port	| Dest Port	|	X	|	X	|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |	Data....						|
&gt; :								:
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; TCP is similar, but has more stuff in it after the ports. Note that the
&gt; Source and Destination ports are defined here (same in both UDP and TCP).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; An ICMP packet, which is also carried entirely within the data section of an
&gt; IP packet, looks like this:
&gt; 
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; |   Type	|   Code	|	  Checksum		|
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; | Stuff depending on Type of the ICMP packet    |
&gt; :								:
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see... no ports.
&gt; 
&gt; That is all. Hope you enjoy reading this ASCII art as much as I enjoyed
&gt; creating it -- and I did enjoy creating it :)
