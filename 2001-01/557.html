<H1>Squid and DNS Question</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
My end goal is to serve a particular page no matter what IP address or
DNS hostname is given to a web server. The server will:

* have no internet or ethernet connectivity
* run mgetty on a single dial-up line

Hence, I'll have almost total control over everything. I was thinking of
two ways to do this, one of which I'm certain would work but would be a
bit of work, the other I'm not sure of but it would be easier:

FIRST WAY

* all DNS packets (query or status) received resolve to ${WEB_SERVER_IP}

Hence, no matter what the dial-in user tried to resolve, they'd get my
web server's IP address. I've read the BIND O'Reilly Book and other
matters and looked at <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/">http://freshmeat.net/</A> and there doesn't appear to
be any easy way to convince any name server implementation simply to
respond with a query found reply.

Mind you, it could be possible I'm not looking in the right place or
simply have missed something somewhere...anyone know of any current DNS
servers - they can be beta - that show this functionality? Running on
RedHat 6.2 of course.

SECOND WAY

* setup Squid and have it serve a set page regardless of what the client
requested

Using a transparent proxy, I'd set up Squid to do as I've stated. Is
this at all possible? That is to say, can you setup Squid in such a way
as to ignore what the user has requested and just give said user some
page else?
