Hi There!

&gt; attempting to create a database as a user but get an access denied message
&gt; whenever I try and do something.  If I log on as su I get full access to
&gt; mysql.  I tried giving the /usr/share/mysql directory full permissions for
&gt; all by issuing a chmod cmd, but still can seem to get access as a user.  Any

Firstly, that's not a UNIX problem. The MySQL database has its own
authorisation scheme and doesn't let just any user log onto it and
access the data. Why don't you goto <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</A> and check out
their rather hefty documentation? Look especially for terms such as
"security", "authorisation". If you've got a later version you will need
to use the "GRANT" SQL statment.

You'll also find a host of links to various projects from that address.
You could also try searching on MySQL on (<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/">http://freshmeat.net/</A>). MySQL
has been bound to virtually every modern language available (PERL, C,
PHP, C++) and has many tools to access it other than the ones that come
with it. In fact, the little frontend that comes with it is really just
a test example of what it can do.

You could lookup a book called "MySQL" by publisher New Riders. It's
very good. But the documentation should be fine as well - it's not quite
as polished as the book (i.e. it's written by programmers and I think
it's undergone translation to English) but it's technically correct.
