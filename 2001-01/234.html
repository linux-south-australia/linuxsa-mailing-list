&gt; Locally (AUS) available diskless workstations that run linux?

What about stock-standard cheap Intel boxes in custom cases? We've done
one large (the videoscreens-hanging-in-airports job) that involved a
highly customised case designed by someone else and are currently doing
another using a micro ATX motherboard inside a small footprint desktop
case. This latter is just a set of carefully-chosen off the shelf parts.
We used Adrenalin (www.adrenalin.net.au, 84100777, Intel gaming machine
specialists) to source this stuff. We're still getting Adrenalin to work
out how to make the fan(s) quieter, but it's a good start. With an LCD
touchscreen the footprint is very small.

&gt; aka. 'Netstations' etc. Boot from rom/flash and have basic apps available
&gt; but little or no HD.

We tend to use network booting for this. Remoteboot on PCs used to be a
PROM along the lines of Linux's Etherboot and Netboot. Now they can be PXE
as well, which to my surprise seems to have been reduced in capabilities
somewhat from what it was originally. I'm doing some more research into it
now. Mark Newton posted about PXE with FreeBSD a little while ago, search
the archives. If there's demand I'll dig out one the papers I've got on
the details of how a PROM-based remoteboot works but I think the Etherboot
docs are pretty good.

I have also been playing with LinuxBIOS, www.linuxbios.org, which is about
completely replacing your FLASH BIOS with a Linux kernel that knows enough
to bootstrap an OS on the hard drive. Nearly everything a BIOS provides
these days is ignored by modern OSs, which go direct to the hardware.
There is a lot of work going on in the LinuxBIOS world concerning
Disk-On-Chip brand FLASH media. There is also supposed to be a web
searchable archive of postings going up any day now. If LinuxBIOS
interests you be prepared to use cvs pserver and flash your BIOS. I'd
advise getting one of those motherboards where you can set a jumper to
force the BIOS to be flashed from whatever is in the floppy/cd drive,
otherwise you could be sorry :-)
