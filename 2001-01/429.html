Our local sugar mill group is doing a bulk PC purchase of about 300-400 Ipex 
PCs... I did send a letter to them pleading for a 'real' pc, but they wanted 
something cheap... Anyway, this box will be going out to 100's of farmers in 
the area and I think it will go against my hopes of weaning a few onto linux 
at the farmers computer group.... 

Anyway, I'm checking compatibility lists, but if any have first hand advice, 
this is the stuff i'm worried about...

The mb is an 'ipex columbia' (not sure what it really is) VIA PM133VT8605

It has only 1 agp and two pci slots apparently, which is a bit of a worry. 
Usual usb, ps2 ports but only 1 serial (with optional 2nd).

The onboard video is S3 savage4 2D/3D using 16 meg of the system memory I 
assume... I worry about linux compatibility with this. Sure, at least the 
video can be upgraded, but it's extra expense.

Sound is Sigmatel Codec on board sound. Don't see anything in the alsa 
drivers, but not sure what to look for... I have the via686 working on this 
box, but I'm not familiar with this onboard sound...

The modem is an internal netcom. I asked a lot of questions on that one 
without much responce. Not sure if it's onboard or pci. They swear it's not a 
winmodem, but I have my doubts. About the only bit of info was a model number 
something like '5060' 

The Lexmark Z12 printer. My understanding is that the Z11 is a winprinter - 
or worse a win9Xprinter. Is the Z12 the same. They are offering a $30 upgrade 
to a hp640c, but I doubt many will do the upgrade...

In the end it's an IPEX Celeron 633 pc with 64meg ram and a 10gig drive with 
'printer' for $1440. Since we are up in NQ I don't suppose we should expect 
too much for that, but I would have rathered a slightly better pc for 
slightly more...

There is a $200 option for PIII 667 and more for PIII 866 etc.  +$30 for 20 
gig  +$70 for 128 ram...

Comments, esp from Oz, appreciated.

thanks, 

tim
