I have multiple 'personal' systems for my own personal use. Some are
development and have gcc. Others perform other roles that do not
need gcc either for space reasons, security reasons or maintenance
reasons. I consider my own personal systems vital.

Other benefits of this rule of thumb are present in ideology's relating to
limiting the number of service a host offers for the purposes of
reliability and up-time.

The rule is a rule of thumb and common sense for both security and
maintenance issues. Don't install what you dont need. It can apply to
aspects of life other than computing.

On a LAN, a compromised 'personal' workstation can be used as a platform
to attach other local systems. A personal system might also have useful
keys (ssh, gpg etc..) and other similar information that could be used to
compromise other 'vital' systems.
