&gt;&gt; This email raised two issues that are surprisingly interesting to me, when
&gt;&gt; considering myself as a 'techie'.  I am particularly interested in the
&gt;&gt; efficiency of education - I think this is because I spent the entirity of
&gt;&gt; highschool and university HATING what I was doing, but simultaneously
&gt;&gt; 'admitting' that I was picking up some _invaluable_ skills.  This, to me,
&gt;&gt; suggests inefficiency; a few pearls of wisdom floating in an ocean of
&gt;&gt; &lt;insert expletive&gt;.
&gt;&gt; It is my belief that the education system needs MASSIVE reform
&gt;
&gt;You mean you want every school/college/institute/university to
&gt;accurately determine each student's precise future requirements and
&gt;then to tailor-make a special 100% relevant and enjoyable course for each
&gt;student?

Yes, it is the tension between wanting to be spoon-fed and taking the
responsibility for one's own education, and grasping every opportunity to
learn. 

There is plenty of experience to be had, even at Unis and TAFE for those
with the gumption :-) 

Then of course, it is possible to gain experience with employers, albeit by
selling yourself for a low income.  Unfortunately, the government has made
it much more difficult for students to gain much needed experience by
putting all sorts of red tape in the way of employers. Who wants to employ
anyone unskilled who cannot bring in instant dollars when you have to pay
workcover, superanuation, possibly payroll tax, and so on.

&gt;You are talking about individual (and extraordinarily intuitve) tuition which
&gt;no bulk education system can provide.  Incidentally, people develop and
change
&gt;with time, so the likelihood that the tutor's decisions about what to provide
&gt;turn out to be wrong, is high.
&gt;
&gt;Institutions can't provide individual attention, and it must be remembered 
&gt;that
&gt;'universal education' was never instituted to provide education, but
rather to
&gt;be the means of socialising the lower classes, and preventing troublesome
&gt;nuisance youngsters becoming rebellious and dangerous adults.  It is
educators
&gt;who have tried to meld their agenda with this not-very-noble idea and grabbed
&gt;the opportunity to provide a lot more, albeit with limited success. 

Oh, wow, a cynic.

[Perceptive, but politically incorrect statement about public schools removed]

&gt;I have always thought that the Waldorf approach of treating the person in a
&gt;holistic way concerning mind body and spirit made sense, and that the

This is highly off-topic, but, ummm, just what is this 'spirit'? It seems
indistinguishable from 'mind'.
 
&gt;Summerhill (A.S. Neale) idea of self-managed disciple and voluntary
&gt;participation was sound.  However, few such schools exist, so it is not 
&gt;possible
&gt;to know whether such ideas would be effective universally.  In the meantime I
&gt;guess we should make the best use of what we have.
&gt;
&gt;"If you think education is expensive, try living without it"  ( a partly
&gt;relevant quote from an unknown source)
