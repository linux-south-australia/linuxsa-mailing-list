Richard!

&gt; You might have noticed an article on computer education entering the
&gt; Curriculum in SA in a big way.

It had to happen at some stage. We are attempting to pretend we are the
lucky, intelligent company.

&gt; I suspect that this is nothing more than a Microsoft entrenchment tool.

Actually, this depends on who is driving the curriculum process.  I
wouldn't be at all surprised that Microsoft will feature significantly
but this may not be solely because of Microsoft. However, I susepct the
curriculum developers:

* possibly may not have used anything but Microsoft products
* may assume that young people are computer illiterate (1)
* may take into account the teacher education required

I would also hazard a guess that most computer teachers may be more
familiar teaching Microsoft products than Linux based products.

&gt; The article suggested that there would be an official curriculum from
&gt; Reception to year 10, and would include skills in wordprocessing, graphics,
&gt; etc.

That is obviously Microsoft Office.

&gt; I think that a great deal of scrutiny should be applied to the proposed
&gt; curriculum to ensure that it does not become nothing more that a means to
&gt; entrench MS in the minds of millions of school leavers.

Someone needs to go into the Department of Education, discover what
group, committee, advisory body or manager is developing or managing the
curriculum process, what stage it is at and how to comment or even how
to weasle one's way onto said advisory body. Now, I could do this if
that's what people wanted...

Furthermore, I think that LinuxSA could possibly start holding
discussions with various Ministers and Shadow Ministers and make this
community known at the top-most political level. It is possible to drive
policy changes from the Parliament. Whilst some - perhaps even you - may
see this as an overtly political move, and others may see it as
absolutely useless, I'm almost tempted to convince one of the MPs in SA
to ask the Government "has Microsoft approached you when developing
policies related to IT, computers, technology and computer software
training? If so, in what form? Are you prepared to table the
documents?".

I would hazard the guess that Microsoft has and will continue to do so.
In my opinion, and only in my opinion, it's politically naive to believe
that Linux's possible technical superiority (2) will carry the debate on
its own merits when we are speaking to busy people who may never have
the time to actually try Linux out for themselves.

Whilst Linux in SA, and globally, lacks the marketing clout of Microsoft
(3) I see no reason at all for its lack of political awareness or
activities. I confess I'm from an activist background myself so stirring
the political teapot seems a reasonable thing for me to do, but it will
become more difficult for all Department Heads to entrench Microsoft if
Parliament, for example, directs all Departments to do a thorough,
documented search of all computer solutions and that one of these
solutions must not be Microsoft based in a computer related decision.

This would occur either because: the Executive proposed this as policy
and had the Lietunant Governor proclaim it under a lawful regulation, or
the Parliament directed the Executive. Either way requires that someone
starts speaking to the politicians (under our Westminster style
government, the Executive except for the L. Governor is a member of
parliament) in a sensible, reasonable and non-political, but
informative, manner.

I am not talking about waving political banners or staging rallies
outside of Parliament house. I am talking about reasonable, sensible
discussion with reasonable, sensible people. Whilst this would be easier
and I believe slightly more effective if LinuxSA were a formally
incorporated body, or at least a non-incorporated body with a slightly
more defined mission statement type affair, who else is there in SA to
represent the Open Source community?

AUUG exists but - let's face it and no offence to AUUG - LinuxSA does
seem to be the strongest, most vibrant "unix like" users group in SA.
There is no friction between AUUG nationally and LinuxSA locally.

I think I should develop some type of Open Source policy...

(1)
Unfortunately, I'm almost certain many curriculum designers assume that
young people of today are totally computer illiterate

(2)
The possible is there to prevent the ignition of any flame wars; my
opinion is definite but people seem to misinterpret these things at
times

(3)
I acknowledge that RedHat, Mandrake et al. do have some marketing clout,
but I would draw one's attention to a Polish consortium (eeck - there
was a story on SlashDot about a Polish hotel that went to Linux) that is
an umbrella organisation for all commercial Linux support companies and
individuals and performs similar functions to a Chamber of Commerce...
