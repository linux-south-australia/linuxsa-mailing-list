&gt; If you want those kinds of features, someone needs to pay for them.  For
&gt; the EISAs and OGNs and AusNets of the world, the people who actually paid
&gt; for them were the shareholders.  The result now?  The shareholders got
&gt; sick of it, and those ISPs are now dead.  Can you give me any hints about
&gt; how the customers got a good deal out of that arrangement?
&gt; 

Well assuming that the users were ahppy enough with the level of service
they may well ahve saved money for the time that the sercie was available.

Eg if they paid say $400 per annum, and the company fled halway through
their 12 months access, but they managed to get say 600 hours of
acceptable to them acces in that first 6 months and the next best
option for them was $1 an hour, then yes they may well be happy.

Short term they cmae out ok.
For the next six months they just go and fid the nex5t ISP is is loss
leading.
If they are using the account pruely as  a leach account, say an
aternative to say 19 cents a meg access, who cares?

I know at least 3 peopel who use pseudo unlimeited accoutns for jsut that
prupsoe, so tehy dont have to downaloan isos etc throug their telstra
direct accounts.

Sure the customer servcie may have been crappy, but after they were set up
they come out financially in front.

Right off the top of my head that is one scenario in which the customer
might be happy and might consider it a good deal..
