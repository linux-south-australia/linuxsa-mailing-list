&gt; I don't follow this. Here's why: how can you know anything for sure about
&gt; the success of a UDP conversation? You can assume things, like you can
&gt; with ethernet. But how can you know?

You don't know that the goodput due to loss and
congestion isn't temporarily zero.

You know it is not permanently zero, because then
you would get either a routing change or an ICMP
Unreachable.

The effect of goodput on the application is going
to vary by application.  For example, take a cricket
score application.  The client sits in the task bar.
The server sends the score for each ball:

   West Indies batting 10 out for 35 runs after 5.1 overs.
   Trying to reach Australia which batted 5 out for 435 runs.

Now even a 90% loss rate is still going to give reasonable
application performance (compare this to the performance
of TCP, which sucks at 5% loss and is unusable at 15% loss).

Now if the server gets an ICMP message it can safely remove
that client from the list of addresses that it sends the
scores to.

I think Sun mis-moulded a lot of people's views of the
applications that are suitable for UDP when they foolishly
tried to run NFS over it.

My point to David was that you can't use ICMP as a transport
protocol, because the server is never informed when the client
becomes unreachable.
