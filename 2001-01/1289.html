HOW TO SUBMIT
========================================

   This year's format will consist of a three day tutorial
   program, followed by a two day technical conference.

   Presentations during the technical conference will include:
          
    1. Invited Talks
    2. Reviewed Papers
    3. Works In Progress
    4. Panel sessions.
       
   Timeslots are available for 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute presentations.
   5-10 minutes should be reserved for questions from the audience.
   
   15 minute timeslots are less formal and are to allow people to talk
   briefly about some topic of interest or problem without having to
   prepare a formal paper ("Work in Progress"). WIP submissions should be
   made to the programme committee as per the deadlines mentioned above.
   
   People presenting a 30+ minute talk will receive free conference
   registration.
   
   People presenting a 15 minute talk will receive a 50% discount on the
   conference registration fees.
   
   If you wish to present a paper, send a brief abstract ("Summary
   Abstract") to the address below by the due date. Please indicate
   whether you are asking for a 15, 30, 45 or 60 minute timeslot.
   
   Summary Abstracts should be 100 -- 200 words in length. Papers should
   have a technical or managerial system administration orientation, and
   should not contain advertising.
   
   Authors will be notified of whether their submission has been accepted
   or rejected.
   
   Authors of Conference Papers will be required to submit an Extended
   Abstract of between 3 and 5 pages by the date specified. This should
   be sufficient to define the structure of the paper, the major points
   covered and the areas which require further work. A draft paper is
   also submitted to allow the conference committee to provide feedback
   and assistance. The Programme Committee will assist authors in
   organising their work to help ensure the quality of papers and
   preparedness of authors.
   
   Authors giving 30+ minute presentations will be expected to provide a
   final "camera ready" paper for inclusion in the conference
   proceedings. This final copy must be submitted in an approved format
   (see "Author Guidelines") or in plain ASCII text. Authors should note
   that formal papers are required - submissions consisting solely of
   slides are not considered sufficient.
   
   Authors giving 15 minute presentations (i.e. WIPs) may submit slides
   in lieu of formal papers.
   
   Author Guidelines

   The Programme Committee will be preparing guidelines to assist authors
   in planning their papers and presentations. We encourage those
   inexperienced in public speaking to trial their papers at the local
   chapter meetings.
   
   To assist authors, templates and instructions for use of those
   templates will be provided in the following formats:
     * Microsoft Word
     * FrameMaker 5.5
     * HTML
       
   Paper submissions will be expected to be submitted using one of these
   templates. 
   
Tutorials

   Tutorial sessions will be either half day or full day in duration.
   People wishing to present tutorials should submit an abstract of the
   material they wish to present, who their intended audience is, and an
   indication of whether they require a half day or a full day timeslot.
   Tutorial presenters are required to submit a tutorial draft to allow
   the committee to provide feedback and assist with the the editorial
   process. Tutorials should be run in lecture format.
   
   Suggested topics include:
     * Computer and Network Security
     * Directory Enabled Networking
     * Cross Platform Interoperability
     * Network Attached Storage
     * Application of Perl, Java, Tcl, Python, etc
     * Management practices for System Administrators
     * Network Attached Appliances
     * Windows Administration
       
   Tutorial presenters will be paid AUD$500 for a half day tutorial and
   AUD$1000 for a full day tutorial. An additional "bonus" payment of
   AUD$125 per half day of tutorial given will be paid to presenters who
   submit camera-ready originals of handout material on-time in
   accordance with the published schedule. SAGE-AU will reimburse
   tutorial presenters reasonable costs of producing handout materials;
   materials submitted on-time will be printed by SAGE-AU on the
   presenter's behalf.
   
   As with papers, tutorials should have a technical or management
   orientation and should not contain advertising.
