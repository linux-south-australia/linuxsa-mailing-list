David Newall answered this pretty well. I'll try and give an end-users
perspective of the programming issue that he pointed out.

Let's take the best case and say you use an ambitious desktop project such
as Gnome which has a printing subsystem, and you set the printer to be A4
(ie you don't use one of the distros where that is the default:) That will
work for apps that use the Gnome Printing Architecture, which is an
increasing proportion of Gnome apps but certainly not all of them. Note
that an application that uses the GTK widget set isn't necessarily a Gnome
application, and probably doesn't use the Gnome printing system. There are
many more GTK apps than Gnome apps.

What about netscape, xpdf, lyx or korganizer, each of which a Gnome user
may well find essential? And if you don't use Gnome, KDE or one of a very
small number of other comprehensive alternatives you don't even have the
benefit of an attempt at a standard underlying printing system, so you
don't even have a core of applications that print in the same way.

Most of the people on this list will hardly even notice having to make
manual modifications to quite a lot of applications. But most users will,
and with good reason. It is bad design in Unix (or rather, until recently,
no design at all) that leads to this situation.
