&gt; 
&gt; Yes it can -- you can transport data where congestion and
&gt; corruption loss is acceptable to the application.

No it cannot.  Don't ignore the requirement, "with certainty."  Any loss
of data with no corresponding notification introduces uncertainty.


&gt; Even in UDP you still get errors if there is no application
&gt; listening on the socket, or if your traffic is administratively
&gt; denied, etc.

UDP delivery is not guaranteed, and no error is necessarily returned.
I should point out that ICMP shares this characteristic, so it's not
beyond the bounds of possibility that you might send UDP packets to a
host which no longer exists.  (To make it quite clear: you could send
the packets and the final router's ICMP unreachable never returns.)
Leaving aside this sort of pathelogical case, you are saying that an
essential difference between ICMP and UDP is that with UDP you *might*
get an error returned if you try to send to a host that is unreachable
but with ICMP you won't.  Put another way, you might know that your UDP
transmission failed, but with neither UDP nor ICMP can you ever know
that it succeeded.


&gt; So you can transmit knowing that data will reach the other end.
&gt; What you don't know is the quality of the received data.

What's interesting about this is that in order to use UDP for transport
where you care that at least some of the data arrives you must introduce
your own feedback loop.  Is there any reason why you can't use ICMP to
send your payload in both directions.  Agreed you won't get notification
of a small set of error conditions, such as an offline host, but then
no feedback is not so hard to interpret.


and later: 
&gt; My point to David was that you can't use ICMP as a transport
&gt; protocol, because the server is never informed when the client
&gt; becomes unreachable.

I do wish you would stop implying that I claimed ICMP was a transport
protocol.  I've already refuted, in no uncertain terms, ever making such
a statement.  By all means tell us why ICMP cannot be used as a transport
protocol, but please do not single out me.  I don't want people thinking
I'm confused on the issue when I'm not.
