If you wish to go the promise way and you are not doing it commercially buy
an ultra100 IDE controller it will save you many $$$'s. This can be modified
into a Fastrak 100 without too many issues if you can solder (see
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/promise_raid/raid100.htm">http://www.geocities.com/promise_raid/raid100.htm</A>) you must have
ptiflash.exe version 1.09, the latest that comes with the controller will
not do it. I have a copy and have modified quite a few of these cards
successfully.

I have not installed it on linux yet, but a friend of mine has, and the
redhat drivers from promise are apparently zillions times easier to install
then the fastrak66 - he is a relative linux newbie and he had it all going
first attempt! - (my instructions to get the FT66 going runs into pages and
is a real prick)

For dual boot, use lilo.

Tarek

Subject: A quick Question re win4lin


Hi Guys & Gals (Merry Xmas & Happy New Year to all)

I've just installed & Set-up the demo for win4lin 2 - everything went well.
I've installed and set-up win 98.
The only problem is when I try to set up the devices - IE lpt ports & game
Ports win4lin config says they are unavailable because they are "Root only"
which means I have no "lpt1" under windows.
Win4Lin says that I need to change the privileges for this device.
Can someone please inform me the easiest way to do this.
(please try to remember I am a relative newbie)


The other question I have is, I am thinking of making my Linux install a bit
more permanent because it seems to be going very well (at the moment I have
just got an old 4gig Maxtor hanging in my pc and when I want to swap OS I
just unplug one HDD and plug in my Win 98) what I want to do is make a dual
boot set-up on one drive. I've been thinking about  the promise ata66 IDE
raid cards and another HDD and set-up a RAID 0. I know they work well for
win has anyone used one under Linux & are they easy to set-up ?

Regards Matt
