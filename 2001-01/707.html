I have to agree with the comments regarding design work and GIMP and linux
per se.  I've recently installed linux with a dual boot partition simply
because my wife who is a multimedia graphic designer just can't bear to be
without Photoshop and Freehand as well as Flash etc.  Granted she generally
uses a Mac at work but when she needs to do work of an evening or at
weekends the PC versions of these packages will do the job and she can
easily port between work and home.  No way will she be able to do all the
work using GIMP and whatabout Flash?

Still, some people may argue that win4lin or vmware or some such thing is
the way to go, but I don't agree.  I think that developers must be made to
see that linux is *the* alternative OS of choice and that there are many
thousands of users who would use their products if  ported to linux.
Perhaps also once industry standard packages are readily available for linux
and they work accordingly (unlike the pain associated with StarOffice for
example) then the snowball effect may occur.

The same is true for educational institutions.  I can't convince my 14 year
old (yet anyway) that she can use linux for all her work and port it easily
between her M$ platform at school and linux at home.  It is this generation
that must be targeted, since they will be the ones who will put pressure on
companies to provide appropriate software that doesn't cost the proverbial
arm and a leg.

&gt; IMHO: Who born to crawl - cannot fly...
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes it's not good idea to use linuxbox as designer workplace. Most
&gt; of
&gt; designers wish to use some extraordinary plugins which hard to find for
&gt; GIMP
&gt; (or even don't exist at all) and they don't want to loose their time on
&gt; building their linuxboxes as designer workplace (may be someone will make
&gt; such stations on commercial basis? :)
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to be more interesting to hear how such things as GIMP,
&gt; ImageMagic,
&gt; gd and so on can be used for generating images on the fly (as MRTG and gd
&gt; doin'). Such implementations could be useful for people who reading this
&gt; conference.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course you can tell about some tricks which could be used for creating
&gt; nice images (like emboss, outline and so on) but there no need to take
&gt; much
&gt; of this stuff. If someone interested in image making techniques they can
&gt; join some desginers conference.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope to be there... Who knows... :)
&gt;
