&gt; There is only one ISP in the country I know of that actually makes money 
&gt; from offering a truly unlimited service (and FYI, the former operations
&gt; manager there is now on Internode's staff). Providers like Onetel and 
Primus

&gt; with such plans are doing so to gain market share in the hope that they 
can

&gt; work on turning a profit later on.


Of course this is a risky strategy for the provider, because they can be 
shut 
down at any time by events beyond their control; for example:

 - If their shareholders get nervous and sell sell sell...

 - If their funding source dries up. Even the most ardent venture 
capitalist 
won't throw money at a loser indefinitely. Or the parent company decides 
to spend their money on a different division; or itself goes bust.

 - They fail to achieve their market share target for whatever reason. 
Think of all the ISPs that have vanished because of poor customer 
service, 
persistent hardware/network problems, or well-advertised competition.

 - Their customers desert them en masse (to someone cheaper) once they 
finally start charging to make a profit. 


Never forget that a fundamental motive for being in business is to 
make a profit, somehow. You may have philosophical or idealogical
objections to this motive, but that's how our society works at the
moment. And even charities have to make enough money to pay their 
bills. Lots of dot-coms learned this concept the hard way
recently.

So anyone contemplating an ISP who offers unlimited time, unlimited 
downloading, and is cheap, should remember that one day you will 
pay. Either for the true cost of your service, or in the inconvenience
of moving to another provider when yours goes bust, or simply from 
having to share a finite bandwidth and hardware resource with hordes 
of spongers. 

For a business, the latter two issues are significant. Most of you 
will have experienced the frustration of an unreachable corporate 
website, or having to wait hours or days for a download to complete.
Or if you're the business with the bodgy connection, the annoyance
of not being able to connect when you want to. Search your memories.
What sort of impression did this leave on you as a customer? 

Now think what would a customer do if a rival company offered an 
equivalent product or service ten times faster, and/or was there 
whenever they wanted them?

So I don't begrudge paying Optus that little bit extra per month 
for a reliable permanent connection. That, incidentally, works 
fine from a standard install of Linux.

As for AOL itself, I can immediately think of one restriction. As 
a result of yet another multi-thousand spams episode from "aol.com"
early last year, the entire domain is now rejected by my 
mailserver (with the exception of a couple of people I know 
personally).

My 2.2 cents worth...


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
