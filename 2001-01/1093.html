&gt; &gt; Erg!!  I do my best to NOT encourage Advertisers, that's like
&gt; &gt; swimming in shark infested waters during a feeding frenzy!
&gt; 
&gt; fair enough, but where does the money to run "free" services come from? eg

Richard,

Is the service free (to the public) or not? If it is, why do you
feel the need to emphasise the word free? If it isn't free, why use the
word at all?

Now, I agree that these services have costs, but if you answer yes to my
first question above, then that is NOT my problem, nor should it be.

&gt; /.? rid /. of its advertisers, and suddenly it has almost zero income, and
&gt; it ceases to exist.

I doubt it would cease to exist. I'm sure they have other ways to offset
their costs. Example: Netcraft, don't bombard the email list with
advertisments, yet so far as I'm aware the list itself is free. After
having a quick look at the linuxsa webpage, I note that there is very
little advertising there either. Yet for all of that, linuxsa (and the
email list) hardly seems to be dissappearing. If anything, it's growing!

Having said that, just because /. chooses to cover their costs by
carrying adverts, does not obligate me (or anyone else) to acknowledge
those advertisers any more than we absolutely have too. If you _choose_
to do so, that is your right.

One last point before I move on: If a service (free or not - especially
on the internet) is as good (as you seem to be suggesting /. is) then
the advertisers will be clammering to be associated with the service for
the exposure alone.

&gt;  I dislike the advertisers, but at least on the internet,
&gt; they are not intrusive like on TV & radio...

No!? Perhaps you have access to an internet that I don't. There is very
little about the internet that I think should be regulated, advertising
would certainly fall into that category though. From curiosity, do you
use spam filters?

&gt; You do understand by point though, don't you?

Understand: I think so.  Agree: No.


Allan

P.S. To answer my first question myself:-

No. If people have to wade through advertising (especially irrelevant)
to get the info they are after, then the service is not free.
