&gt; Hay Linux SA Mailing List

Firstly, you spell "Hay" "Hey". Get the slang spelled correctly.

Secondly, I am not the mailing list although my opinion, although equal
to others, is obviously worth more than others...

&gt; I was wondering if it would be possable to list the commands or
&gt; programs i should use for a Red Hat 6.0 Machine.

It's about as difficult as getting people using Microsoft Outlook
Express V 5.X, as you are, to consistently use HTML. The commands are
there, you just can't find them or can't be bothered about looking for
them. Even though Outlook has a help function that will tell you how to
turn off HTML.

I'd suggest:

* man ipchains (if you don't have it, get it from freshmeat.net/ [search
for it])
* man hosts.allow
* man inetd

&gt; And what would be the best way to approch the situation.

Try being much more specific. And try to write your e-mail in a format
which doesn't irritate people...

&gt; And is it possable to reject Packets from certain ip ranges?

Like yours? That's easy...

* ipchains -i ppp+ -s {MICKS_IP_RANGE} -d {MYIP} -j DENY

Where the shell variables speak for themselves...

DL

ps.

If any _people_ decide that this e-mail is sarcastic they are correct.
Condescending. Correct. But correct, as in information? Yes.
