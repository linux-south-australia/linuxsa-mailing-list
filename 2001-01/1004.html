&gt; &gt; Security is very strange thing to learn. Commonly it's a set of rules
which
&gt; &gt; you must obey (remove unused programs, keep up to date and so on). But I
&gt; &gt; never saw them somewhere... So everyone makes such set by themself and
&gt; &gt; nobody knows how good it is. For eaxample: It's their decision to have
gcc
&gt; &gt; or not (some exploits need gcc on system). But then it takes time to
install
&gt; &gt; & remove gcc when they need to compile something and makes life slighly
&gt; &gt; inconvinient. So keeping restrictive policy not good for attacker but in
the
&gt; &gt; same time it's not good for yourself.
&gt;
&gt; It can depend on the 'function' of the machine in question. I usually
&gt; have gcc on a desiganted development/desktop/workstation/support machine.
&gt; I compile what I need there. I don't have gcc on dedicated firewalls,
&gt; gateways, web servers etc... It depends on the final 'level of service'
&gt; that a host will be providing and where it is situated.

See... Here another rule... It is from your list. You don't care much for
your personal system as for vital systems.

I think here alot of people on this list who have rules similar to this. So
if everyone will post his rules we can compile law of linux security! :)
