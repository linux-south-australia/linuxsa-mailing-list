&gt;  &gt; - Connection to an office via L2TP rather than a plain Internet

&gt;  &gt; install fee in this case, I'm still wrestling with finding the best
&gt;  &gt; value for money 'high end' DSL customer end box for this option)
&gt;
&gt;This sounds very interesting. Perhaps you can give a 'to the nearest
&gt;$1000' type estimate on this. I've not the slightest clue what one of
&gt;these might cost.

Circa $2k right now, but I'm hoping the next new Cisco DSL router 
with the appropriate capabilities (SOHO 77) will become available 
here soon and may halve that figure. Unclear as yet.

This also requires a change in IOS to support the feature we need to 
do what we want to do - I've got this achieved as a formal Cisco 
internal feature request and I'm rattling chains internally in Cisco 
at this time to get it implemented.

&gt;
&gt;How will the charging model work in this case? Does the ADSL just become a
&gt;piece of copper direct to the office, ie $install plus $rental and that's
&gt;it, with the $ just the same as for a service that includes bytes?

It's a very good question, and one I've been wrestling with for a 
while - and I'm undecided on right now, to be frank.

Its appealing to pitch it as just the 'transport only' cost with no 
megabyte limit at all. The thing that pushes back against that is the 
fact that there is a substantial factor in the cost of deploying ADSL 
related to the amount of 'trunk' bandwidth into the metropolitan 
DSLAM network that has to be purchased. If someone were to flatline 
their link into their own office day in and day out they'd use a 
relatively expensive proportion of that overhead cost up - and could 
cause such a link to cost us far more money than we'd charged for it.

I've been playing with the cost modeling around a 'one tenth the 
cost' pricing basis lately - i.e. an office connection being reframed 
as providing up to 5000 Mb per month (10 x the Internet cap), with an 
excess per MB fee of around $0.02 per MB (around 10% of the Internet 
excess rate).

Comments welcome. I suspect that a 5000 Mb cap would be enough for 
most rational humans using ADSL as an office linking technology, 
while ensuring that someone who wanted to use it for 24x7 video 
streaming from their office would contribute a (reasonable) amount 
towards the trunk bandwidth they'd be making me pay for to support 
their activity.

&gt;  &gt; Your support would be sincerely appreciated, as would your comments
&gt;  &gt; on the above price points
&gt;
&gt;The prices seem very reasonable to me.

Thanks - it's actually not something we've had a lot of feedback on 
as yet. I think that for a mythical 'average' consumer they look 
high, but that's not something I can fix until Telstra relent on a 
number of overpriced aspects of their wholesale access components. 
"we do what we can..."

&gt;What are you committing to in terms of fault reporting and repairing? This
&gt;is one area where it would be possible for you to do much better than
&gt;Telstra's ISDN team does, from my experience (I didn't get any resolution
&gt;until I went down the pits with the repair staff. The nicest bit was where
&gt;I reported the fault for the nth time and the person taking the report
&gt;said "Hey, didn't you just answer my question on the LinuxSA list this
&gt;morning?" :)

Unfortunately the ADSL wholesale access commitments in this respect 
aren't exactly stellar, and all we can do is mirror them in our own 
commitments as a result. In fact, the Committed Information Rate 
(CIR) statement by Telstra (underlying their wholesale _and_ retail 
offerings in this space) is in fact ZERO (yep, zip, nada, nothing at 
all).

Telstra are trying hard to differentiate ADSL from what they consider 
to be 'premium/business' offerings like ISDN (their positioning, not 
mine!) with such limitations.

It is the careful reflection of these issues in our own Terms and 
Conditions, making sure we've found them all, and making sure we 
frame them to accurately reflect which are under our control and 
which are not which is one of the things delaying our launch of our 
own product. We don't wish to be crucified by a Telstra failure by 
swallowing the angst ourselves.

For what it's worth, in practice, I suspect (i.e. have observed to 
date and hope going forward) that the ADSL service reliability and 
ability to hit peak transfer speeds will be pretty good. It's been 
pretty good so far.

However, I would say in general terms that ADSL won't ever work as 
well as it does on the first day you try it. A lot of issues stand to 
degrade ADSL performance, the main two being inter-pair interference 
if the rest of the occupants in your street also start using it, and 
congestion in the 'trunk' uplinks back to 'us' which will be 
dependent on the extent to which we can afford a sufficient ratio of 
customer-to-trunk bandwidth at Telstra's current pricing to us.

[We are working on using Agile's carrier license to mitigate some of 
these costs by punching a direct fibre tail into the Adelaide CBD 
exchanges, but with Telstra all these things take longer than you 
want and cost more than you wish they did]

&gt;  &gt; and suggestions on what else we could
&gt;  &gt; offer that would be of use to you in an ADSL service.
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to know what it means that ADSL is a shared service, or so I've
&gt;read. When everyone on an exchange is using ADSL, can we expect the the
&gt;performance to drop? (Not that this will happen until some large telco
&gt;starts agressively pushing ADSL nationwide, of course :-) If you were to
&gt;accurately describe in a sentence or so the long-term outlook for ADSL
&gt;you'd be well in front of everyone else in the transparency stakes.

ADSL is a shared service at almost every level of the network diagram 
concerned.

The only non-shared component is the tail from your analog phone 
service into the local exchange.

Everything from then on involves some form of potential or actual compromise.

I haven't got a clear statement from Telstra regarding whether they 
constrain bandwidth between their metro exchange network and the CBD 
(where we take our bytestream out of their network). I suspect they 
won't limit things here because they own the road (but there is no 
committment either way from them - note the zero CIR figure I 
mentioned above). My guess is that this part won't be an issue.

In terms of our trunk access to pick up and send bytes, this 
constraint to date is economic, upon us - whether that trunk results 
in us making a profit or a loss is directly a factor of the overload 
we choose in terms of customers-per-megabit of trunk bandwidth.

Once we have direct exchange access we will be able to reduce some 
(but not all) of the Telstra charges upon us for achieving access to 
their DSLAM network (some of their charges are for the speed of the 
entry point, others for the speed of the tail circuit to our premises 
- we can mitigate the second but not the first with our own fibre).

We suspect it'll work out ok, but will become very much like the 
American experience with ADSL, which includes a typical scenario of 
ADSL working very quickly for some several months and then 
progressively slowing down in 'busy' periods as the Telco concerned 
starts rate limiting at either or both of the choke points noted 
above in order to control their costs.  I speak with friends in the 
USA whose '1.5 megabit' ADSL service maxes out at more like 400 
kilobits per second during busy periods, and I'm not surprised (guess 
what, they are using, ahem, 'unlimited' pricing models there).

Our own plans, once we've rolled and we're working cleanly with 
Telstra-wholesaled ADSL, we'll be pursuing our own offering using our 
own hardware in the Telstra exchange side. We have access to do this 
in theory, there just happens to be a whole, different, set of 
adminstrative mountains Telstra require us to climb in order to play 
in the direct-copper-both-ends access sandpit. And a whole new set of 
unreasonable pricing models, and the usual negotiation environment 
(if you don't like it, you know where the courts are...).

So - what's the long term future for ADSL in this country? I think 
it'll be quite big, but if Telstra don't pull their finger out, there 
will likely also be a viable market in alternatives to ADSL of a 
similar performance level (such as our existing Agile wireless 
systems), and other ways to skin a similar cat will also emerge in 
some places. ADSL is likely to be the mid term winner in the 
'ubiquitous sort-of broadband' stakes in metropolitan Adelaide in my 
view.

Cheers,
Simon
