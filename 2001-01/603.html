&gt;Are we talkgn about computing here ot the use of computers in schools
&gt;
&gt;Especially if you think that they might also want to prepare kids for what
&gt;they will find in the real world one day. These days what most people find
&gt;on real world PCs is word/excel/windows.

We must work to disabuse teachers of this falacy. Computing changes every
few years. Anyone in year 8 today, being taught to use the current crop of
Microsoft progucts will face a very different environment when they finish
year 12.

In addition, using StarOffice, for example, will give them much lower cost
of ownership access to similar tools.

We must point out to them the falacy of the above argument and that open
source software will drive their dollar further and allow them to achieve
better results.

I sometimes wonder if the Independent Schools Association might not be a
better target?


&gt;Not only that most teachers know word/excel/windows and have enough
&gt;trouble using it, let alone learnign/using anoteh rtos, particularly when
&gt;they have littel itnerest in doing so, and probably even if they were
&gt;interested it would take them several years to get to a usable level.
&gt;
&gt;The trainging supplied by the dept is dismal to non existant.
&gt;
&gt;So whiel it is possible that they might use star office for tehre needs,
&gt;it is highly unliekly tht it woudl actually ahppen.
&gt;
&gt;What would be more likely is that the PCS woudl nto get used as much.
&gt;(tehre are still some classrooms where the PC is never turned on - this
&gt;woudl liekly increase if you took away teh OS/apps which they have spent
&gt;lots of time getting to some level of familiarity with  and told them to
&gt;start again).
&gt;
&gt;Remember a lot of teachers dont want to do PC support and dont want ot
&gt;do PC training(I dont mean dont want to eb trained, I mean dont want ot be
&gt;PC trainers). They are not trained, equipped or interested in doing so.
&gt;
&gt;Some do  and I applaud that.
&gt;Some do under the most adverse environemnts, eg no support from
&gt;princiapals little peer support and few funds, policy made by schools
&gt;counclis who have no understanfdign of IT/computers, completely self
&gt;taught, largely in their own time.
&gt;
&gt;Taking away that investment in time and skills(no matter how ptiiful these
&gt;skills are) would be extermely demoralising and quite possibly would set
&gt;computer usage in schools backa  few years or more.
&gt;
&gt;Especially given there is no realpractical reason to do so, in the
&gt;majority of cases.
&gt;As I say if you are specially teachign "computing" is computer sicnese/IT
&gt;principals, tehn sure open source woudl be extermely useful, possibly
&gt;indispensible once you have it and appropriately skilled teachers in
&gt;place.
&gt;
&gt;But for non "compuiting"  every day  desktop use I cant really see open
&gt;source softewware beign all that useful.
&gt;
&gt;There is more here at stake than good philosophy.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Not that I'm saying that programming should be the goal of
&gt;&gt; &gt; K-12 computing, I think understanding should be.  But
&gt;&gt; &gt; understanding thye method and limitations of programming
&gt;&gt; &gt; is part of understanding computing.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; i believe some basic introductory programming would benifit those
planning to go
&gt;&gt; onto a uni computer course, perhaps in C or another easier to use language.
&gt;&gt; which brings the point, that many computer teachers would have no idea, and
&gt;&gt; would need retraining.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; a while ago there was a plan to get MCSE into high schools, perhaps the
&gt;&gt; governments current plans are leading to this? Would it be hard to get
in first,
&gt;&gt; even if only a few schools, with the RHCE instead?? pity it costs $2500.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Without this understanding of rogramming, we end up with
&gt;&gt; &gt; a society that is too easily taken in by schemes for
&gt;&gt; &gt; electronic voting or missile defence systems.
