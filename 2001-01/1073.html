&gt;Another thought: what about a clear statement in your docs on what

Anything that speaks TCP/IP over Ethernet will do, mate.

Also expecting to support (some) PCI and USB devices in the fullness 
of time (they work fine - its the support issues that you correctly 
suspect are the issue there).

To encapsulate customers' experiences, we need to have customers - 
there's a cart-before-the-horse issue there. But we routinely support 
customer connections from many different operating systems today.

&gt;Telstra insist that you have a proprietary operating system and that you
&gt;be able to show the original install media to the Technician when he
&gt;comes. Telstra also understands that people use Linux with ADSL but (as
&gt;you'd expect) verbally disown all notion of warranty and support, and have
&gt;no provision on their form. In discussions with Telstra I had several
&gt;people explain to me in detail why Linux was an unreliable option and
&gt;simply shouldn't be used. "So what about FreeBSD then" wasn't the response
&gt;that they were looking for :-)

Good thing we aren't Telstra then :)
