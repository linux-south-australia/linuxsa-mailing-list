Michael (Neuling)!

Thank you for addressing me formally. Each person speaks in their own
style and I make no apologies at all for what I have said in the past on
this topic. Whilst I could discuss my stupidity (a paraphrase of your
last sentence here quoted) I will repost the reply. Humour me while I
critique what I've already said:

"I see. Do you actually know what SYN packets are? I'd like to see you
run a server with all the SYN packets denied or rejected. It would be
amusing..."

1) "I see."

That is a filler. It's an acknowledgment that I had - and I had - read
what Mick Collins wrote before. If a person manages to take offence at
this comment I suggest they not dare venture anywhere near any people.
People say "I see" quite often.

2) "Do you actually know what SYN packets are?"

Apart from the actually, this is a valid question. The adverb actually,
however, does change its connotation from a mere request and display
that I have assumed that Mick Collins does  n o t  know what SYN packets
are. Again, people make assumptions about what people know all the time.

3) Rest of the sentence

I was, perhaps, a little unclear. If I were running sourceforge I would
hardly render my packet filter to deny all incoming requests to all
services. In this situation rejecting all packets from an external
source with the SYN flag set could be seen as a little "strange" to
"very paranoid"...

I apologise I didn't make this point more clear. I would, though, find
it amusing if someone did this on a server they wanted to be accessible
from the outside world (i.e.the Internet).

"As for the string you sent as an example, I don't think that ipchains
can help you there. ipchains fiddles with ports, ip sources and
destinations and not the payload so it has no way of determining what
the payload is. Furthermore that string could be a legitimate part of a
payload as it was when I downloaded your e-mail.:

4) 

Tell me what is wrong with this. Whilst I certainly haven't gone into
the detail that Michael Neuling has, tell me what is wrong with this
quote. If you can prove to me that this quote is:

a) wrong
b) incorrect
c) patronising
d) rude

I will - without reservation - make a full apology. Mick Collins sent an
example string (which I won't reproduce but it looked like the "let's
hang their modem up" string) and I pointed out that it can be part of a
valid payload. Furthermore ipchains sets up tables that base their rules
on ports, ip sources and ip destinations among other things.

5) "I'm not sure what netfilter can do in this area..."

In my opinion, the admission of ignorance or a lack of knowledge when a
person has no need to have that knowledge - I don't currently work with
a 2.4.0 series kernel - is not the basis for stupidity. 

Now, to quote Michael Neuling:

"Also let me apologise for Mr Lloyd's reply.  In the style which makes
mailing lists useless all over the internet, he insulted you and then
proceeded to not give you a solution to your problem.  Please don't be
discouraged in participating in the list because of his stupidity.  "

1) "Also let me apologise for Mr Lloyd's reply"

It is invalid to apologise on someone else's behalf. Furthermore, I
don't think my reply was technically incorrect nor overtly insulting. I
expect that you will revoke this apology especially as it's on my
behalf.

2) "In the style...not give you a solution"

Perhaps what I said wasn't overly friendly. Be aware that I was talking
to someone who consistently irritates me because I'm not yet irritated
with HTML email to simply send it to /dev/null. Furthermore, I have
helped many people on this list including those who I appear to hold in
disdain. You, Michael Neuling, have totally and utterly misunderstood,
misinterpreted and quite possibly deliberately twisted what I said.

3) "Please don't be...stupidity"

That sentence leads me beyond belief. It is utterly baseless, totally
unfounded and - in my opinion - libel. Pure and utter libel.
Unfortunately we are not in America where the court systems do accept
e-mail as the basis for evidence, but I assure you that if you ever
publish that in a form acceptable as evidence in any Australian court's
jurisdiction you shall be the defendant in a libel and/or defamation
case.

I hope I make myself perfectly and utterly clear. I don't care what
people say about me provided that it is:

* based on fact; or
* could reasonably be based on fact

Whilst, in hindsight, I could have made my posting more clear and more
understandable - I had left some context out - I dare say to all the
members on this list that they, too, leave context out. This list has
been, jokingly, accused of being pedantic but surely we are not that
pedantic.

To close, your pithy statement about the state of my mind - or whatever
you define as "my stupidity" - is not at all based on fact, insulting
and in print would be, I believe, defamatory.
