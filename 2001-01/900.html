&gt; This utilities intended to make some money for you

Not exactly.

&gt; not only information, isn't it?

What else isn't it?

&gt; So there are no such thing as a
&gt; free launch -
&gt; there alot of such systems but they cost some money (in most cases
&gt; expensive)

You mean it would require so much R&D to write a programme to monitor a
network interface and provide a few statistics that it can't possibly be
open-sourced and released to the public domain?  The entire Linux
distribution I'm using is "a free lunch."  All I want is a bit of salt with
my chips!

&gt; It's not so easy as you can think

I don't think it's _easy_.  Writing and developing a linux distribution
isn't easy - but it is a useful tool, and it's free.  A decent PPP monitor
sounds to me like a useful tool.  I just thought that MAYBE there might be
one for free.

'parently not.

Regards,

Jordan.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Jordan!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I've spent quite some time Google-browing and
&gt; Freshmeat-fishing, but to no
&gt; &gt;avail..  I'm looking for a program or script to extract or create
&gt; statistics
&gt; &gt;(total time connection up, number of times connection has
&gt; gone up, total
&gt; &gt;kilobytes up/down, etc) for ppp connections.  I realise
&gt; there are bits of
&gt; &gt;information in various logs, ifconfig etc., but something a
&gt; little more
&gt; &gt;structured would be preferable
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It would be nice for a client to be able to type something like;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;gimme-info 4 jan 2001
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;and have "gimme-info" provide total statistics for ppp0
&gt; since the 4th of
&gt; &gt;January 2001 (say...the start of a monthly billing period).
&gt; Also, stuff
&gt; &gt;like this would be cool:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;gimme-info all-sessions
&gt; &gt;gimme-info this-session
&gt; &gt;gimme-info last-session
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You get the idea.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Please let me know if I'm missing something obvious. (ahhh what am I
&gt; saying,
&gt; &gt;you will anyway!!!)
&gt;
&gt; Yep... You do... This utilities intended to make some money
&gt; for you - not
&gt; only information, isn't it? So there are no such thing as a
&gt; free launch -
&gt; there alot of such systems but they cost some money (in most cases
&gt; expensive). So only way here is to create your own one or ask
&gt; some one to
&gt; create it for you or just buy it - you select! :)
&gt;
&gt; Couple years ago I had ISP in my homeland and I was forced to
&gt; make such one.
&gt; It's not so easy as you can think. I have spent few weeks on
&gt; it until I got
&gt; good realtime stats on private web.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway if you need some information and don't need it to be
&gt; looking nice you
&gt; can setup your logrotate to rotate /var/log/messages once per
&gt; month and then
&gt; do grep ppp /var/log/messages. Then you can use some
&gt; formatting tool or
&gt; write some tiny perl program which will calculate numbers
&gt; which you need.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My thanks for your time and my ignorance :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Regards,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Jordan Noblet.
