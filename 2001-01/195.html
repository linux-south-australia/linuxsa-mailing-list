&gt; We should produce a local, SA Linux Manifesto (and I will email

is this like the UnaBomber's manifesto? hmmm...

&gt; separately to this). We should present this to members of each party to
&gt; present to their governing bodies. I think I have enough contacts to get
&gt; a Linux manifesto through the ALP state council, and to get it put to
&gt; the Liberal state body as well...what do we all think of this?

I wonder what it will be for. What, exactly are we manifesting, and why
would politicians (or rather, the voting public (or whoever people what to
claim has the power here...) care about it? I think I may also write a Pasta
Manifesto...

&gt; Politicians are here to stay whether they suck or not. And unfortunately
&gt; they're the ones who will have the power to force their depts. to use
&gt; Linux - not the dept. CEO's....

I assume that is what you are attempting to manifest for -- to get the PS to
use Linux...

as someone who works in IT in a government dept (but speaking solely for
myself as an individual who happens to be employed there...)...

1) EDS and The Contract. It blows. I think it is up for renegotiation
soonish though. AFAIK, it makes it difficult for many departments to change
from what they run now (or what EDS is running for them, or whatever). Most
of the computers that I know of in the PS are Windows or Solaris, but I
imagine most ofther departments have an assortment of proprietry OS's. There
is some linux around, but it's generally kept outside of the EDS contract
through the work of people who would rahter not deal with EDS (2 reasons for
using Linux: 1 -- it's free and not windows, etc. 2 -- AFAIK, it doesn't
come under the EDS contract.)

2) Why Linux? In reality, Linux is just one "brand name" that is very
prominent under the umbrella of Open Source software (and I am not meaning
to get into an ERS vs RMS Open Source/Free Software debate here, nor a Linux
vs anything debate...). In my experience, an enormous amount is spent on
writing custom software -- most likely, more than is spent on proprietry
commercial software. So there are really two issues here -- use Open Source
over Proprietry, and release code as Open Source. I believe Matthew Tippett
did a speil about this at a LinuxSA meeting once.

3) I don't know what a "Manifesto" really is, or why it would have any
effect on anyone. Why not try a proposal, or a policy or something? I guess
I'll never be a politician (which is not a bad thing, all things
considered).

I don't knwo quite why I bothered writing all that... I was initially going
to say "yeah -- whatever", but the problem is that I seriously think that
our government should release the software it writes as Open Source. There
is no competition, hence no competitive advantage to be retained by keeping
the source closed. In terms of getting the public servants of the state
using Linux, I really think that that is less important. What we need is a
less restrictive contract with EDS (or someone else or some other
companies). There is already movement towards Open Source generally (in my
dept, at least, there is a lot of Linux, Apache, and other free software
being used - unfortunately, we are stuck with Solaris for technical,
political, contractual and practical reasons, and these will be very very
hard to change)... AFAIK, DAIS is the department to influence -- I think
they set the IT policy for the rest of governement... but I could be
wrong...
