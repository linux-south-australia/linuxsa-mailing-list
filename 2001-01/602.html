Are we talkgn about computing here ot the use of computers in schools

If we are specifaly talking about computing ie basic computer science then
sure open source will eb fgine.

But if you are talkign about the ordinary every day use of computers in
schools ( at least in junior primary and primary schools), the usage is
not much different to business.

Ie they use PCs to do other work.
The PC and associated applicaitions are not the topic them selves, tehy
are simly tools, liek pencils and books.
At elast this si how it is in teh school where my mum is k-7 librarian and
at the schools of her schoolteacher friends.

Under this scenario it is very difficult to see open source beign
particulalry useful.

Especially if you think that they might also want to prepare kids for what
they will find in the real world one day. These days what most people find
on real world PCs is word/excel/windows.

Not only that most teachers know word/excel/windows and have enough
trouble using it, let alone learnign/using anoteh rtos, particularly when
they have littel itnerest in doing so, and probably even if they were
interested it would take them several years to get to a usable level.

The trainging supplied by the dept is dismal to non existant.

So whiel it is possible that they might use star office for tehre needs,
it is highly unliekly tht it woudl actually ahppen.

What would be more likely is that the PCS woudl nto get used as much.
(tehre are still some classrooms where the PC is never turned on - this
woudl liekly increase if you took away teh OS/apps which they have spent
lots of time getting to some level of familiarity with  and told them to
start again).

Remember a lot of teachers dont want to do PC support and dont want ot
do PC training(I dont mean dont want to eb trained, I mean dont want ot be
PC trainers). They are not trained, equipped or interested in doing so.

Some do  and I applaud that.
Some do under the most adverse environemnts, eg no support from
princiapals little peer support and few funds, policy made by schools
counclis who have no understanfdign of IT/computers, completely self
taught, largely in their own time.

Taking away that investment in time and skills(no matter how ptiiful these
skills are) would be extermely demoralising and quite possibly would set
computer usage in schools backa  few years or more.

Especially given there is no realpractical reason to do so, in the
majority of cases.
As I say if you are specially teachign "computing" is computer sicnese/IT
principals, tehn sure open source woudl be extermely useful, possibly
indispensible once you have it and appropriately skilled teachers in
place.

But for non "compuiting"  every day  desktop use I cant really see open
source softewware beign all that useful.

There is more here at stake than good philosophy.

&gt; &gt; Not that I'm saying that programming should be the goal of
&gt; &gt; K-12 computing, I think understanding should be.  But
&gt; &gt; understanding thye method and limitations of programming
&gt; &gt; is part of understanding computing.
&gt; 
&gt; i believe some basic introductory programming would benifit those planning to go
&gt; onto a uni computer course, perhaps in C or another easier to use language.
&gt; which brings the point, that many computer teachers would have no idea, and
&gt; would need retraining.
&gt; 
&gt; a while ago there was a plan to get MCSE into high schools, perhaps the
&gt; governments current plans are leading to this? Would it be hard to get in first,
&gt; even if only a few schools, with the RHCE instead?? pity it costs $2500.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Without this understanding of rogramming, we end up with
&gt; &gt; a society that is too easily taken in by schemes for
&gt; &gt; electronic voting or missile defence systems.
