Hi this is interesting (the thread on ADSL , not my drivel that follows).  

I'm planning on moving into a new house in the next cupla weeks and was
contemplating scraping the current system of having a 2nd dedicated phone
line for internet connections.  My investigations into ADSL, as the most
preferred alternative, indicated that only TELSTA was in the position of
supplying this service, I can't find any other company (in Tassie at least)
that is proposing to offer ADSL at competitive rates, at least in the
foreseeable future.

The question is, does one bite the bullet and go with TELSTRA (at least in
the short term), or is it advisable to wait to see what the market does?  My
gut feeling is that to wait means having to have a 2nd line installed and
then paying for the extra line rental and ISP call charges and putting up
with bloody snail paced download times.  One wonders how much more
competitive the other players will be, when they finally come up with ADSL
packages.

This is all too hard, does anyone have any inside info as to the expected
roll out of the other telco's and what is the general feeling as to how to
go? Also, as a reasonable linux newbie, I wonder if there is any hassle
involved in setting up a linux box to run ADSL.

Just my two bits worth...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of any aDSL suppliers apart from Telstra who are
&gt; actually
&gt; &gt; deliving?
&gt; 
&gt; Not as yet, although the company onnect.com.au (Of which Internode is a 
&gt; customer) has told me that they will be releasing something in early 
&gt; February. They also promised static IP, and will be delivered at 2MB.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what their pricing will be like but it would have to be 
&gt; competitive to be better than a Telstra Plan (Although Businesses may see 
&gt; it differently)
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; After waiting ages for Internode/Agile, I rang them today on the day
&gt; they
&gt; &gt; promised they would be able to announce product, only to find that they
&gt; &gt; have delayed for another month :-(
&gt; 
&gt; He he.. Anything new there? :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
