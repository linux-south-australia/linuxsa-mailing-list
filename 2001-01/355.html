Martin!

&gt; I am not terribly impressed with the way that nVidia has approached the
&gt; issue of providing 3D/GLX drivers for Linux, although perhaps they do
&gt; deserve some kudos for doing this at all.  Unfortunately, it has been
&gt; some 4 months since the last release.  I guess that perhaps they feel

I probably should mention that X does run noticably faster with these
new drivers...so it's not all bad. It's just that I seem to have hit
against a "optimised but buggy" vs "stable but slow" tradeoff...

&gt; I should mention that I also upgraded to XFree86 4.0.1 (from 3.3.6) at
&gt; the same time as installing the GLX drivers, so this may possibly be
&gt; part of the problem.

It may be. My XFree86 4.0.1 using the nVidia drivers that ship with
XFree86 4.0.1 and GLX worked fine before though...
