&gt; This system shows some peculiarities:
&gt;
&gt; * Squid hijacks 90% (or more) of the memory
&gt;  - I've tried mempools on and off
&gt;  - I've tried mempool_limit (some arbitrary number)
&gt;  - I've reduced/changed the cache_mem size
&gt;
&gt; Is it normal for squid to use that much memory? Having looked at the
&gt; server with only one person using it, the hard disk seems to thrash.
&gt; I've hazarded a guess that it's swapping out as well as talking to the
&gt; Squid cache.

#  TAG: cache_mem       (bytes)
#       NOTE: THIS PARAMETER DOES NOT SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM PROCESS
#       SIZE.  IT PLACES A LIMIT ON ONE ASPECT OF SQUID'S MEMORY
#       USAGE.  SQUID USES MEMORY FOR OTHER THINGS AS WELL.
#       YOUR PROCESS WILL PROBABLY BECOME TWICE OR THREE TIMES
#       BIGGER THAN THE VALUE YOU PUT HERE

So if you have default 8 MB your squid will be somewhere about 24 MB. But in
same time:

#       If circumstances require, this limit will be exceeded.
#       Specifically, if your incoming request rate requires more than
#       'cache_mem' of memory to hold in-transit objects, Squid will
#       exceed this limit to satisfy the new requests.  When the load
#       decreases, blocks will be freed until the high-water mark is
#       reached.  Thereafter, blocks will be used to store hot
#       objects.

So how much memory allocated depends on needs of squid and you almost have
no way to control it.

#  TAG: memory_pools    on|off
#       If set, Squid will keep pools of allocated (but unused) memory
#       available for future use.  If memory is a premium on your
#       system and you believe your malloc library outperforms Squid
#       routines, disable this.

#  TAG: memory_pools_limit      (bytes)
#       Used only with memory_pools on:
#       memory_pools_limit 50 MB
#
#       If not set (default) or set to zero, Squid will keep all memory it
#       can. That is, there will be no limit on the total amount of memory
#       used for safe-keeping.

mem_pools - just optimization measure. It means that if squid successfully
allocated some memory (even in excess of cache_mem) it will not be released
(if no memory_pools_limit) or will be released only overhead over
memory_pools_limit. So if you wish that Squid will shrink itself after
serious load set memory_pools off and Squid will try to achieve size of
cache_mem * 3 or set memory_pools on and memory_pools_limit below cache_mem
* 3.

Of course it's bad idea to have swap and cache on one physical drive. Data
will be moved commonly between cache and swap if squid will be low on
memory.

&gt; * Squid fails to allocate memory
&gt;  - /var/log/messages contains messages such as:
&gt;    xmalloc...failed to allocate 4096kbytes
&gt;    terminated child process
&gt;    sent sigsegv
&gt;
&gt; These probably appear when the server is busy. I'm told they never used
&gt; to appear (some six months ago) and that the server has gotten
&gt; inexplicably slow. I've taken down any unnecessary resource users but it
&gt; is said this server ran faster under its current setup.
&gt;
&gt; How much memory does squid allocate?

Look above - memory_pools control which routines will be used by Squid to
allocate memory. If you will have memory_pools on then Squid will run
slightly faster.

So for your config

cache_mem 6 MB
memory_pools on
memory_pools_limit 20 MB

will be good if you have some other services runnin'. It will run slower
under heavy load because swap will be involved but if your users will not do
overload it will run good. Also if you runnin' server as dedicated for Squid
then it will be good idea to have 128 MB of RAM (or more) and disabled swap
at all. Simply Squid have no idea where the current object is - in RAM or in
swap because system hides this info and thus Squid cannot optimize
interactions with swap. But aware: if you will set memory settings for Squid
wrong (too high) then some tasks (which started by cron for example) will
give you "bus error" or "no memory" messages.

&gt; * cache directory
&gt;  - cache directories range from 00 to (or some such number)
&gt;  - under these directories are further directories with similar
&gt; hexadecimal names
&gt;  - cache data only appears in 00/00
&gt;
&gt; I would have expected that Squid would have distributed its cache data
&gt; more efficiently. There are some 20 or more directories, yet it looks as
&gt; though it's storing all data in one. Is this normal? Abnormal?

#       cache_dir Type Directory-Name Mbytes Level-1 Level2
#       'Level-1' is the number of first-level subdirectories which
#       will be created under the 'Directory'.  The default is 16.
#
#       'Level-2' is the number of second-level subdirectories which
#       will be created under each first-level directory.  The default
#       is 256.

Squid will create directories accordingly to this setting and then will fill
every directory with data just one-by-one. When directory will get 255
objects then Squid start to fill next directory. This setting allow you to
set how much objects your storage can hold. In default configuration squid
can get no more than 1044480 objects. It's enough because you will probably
run out of inodes before you will fill last directory. But when Squid will
remove some object it will not try to fill that position again until it will
reach last directory. So storage of Squid works in round-robin manner and I
consider it as very effective.
