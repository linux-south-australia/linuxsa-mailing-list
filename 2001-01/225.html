Firstly, I've seen HTML mail at least twice before from Mick. I'm sad to
see he managed to get a virus on his machine and I hope he's running
something like AVX for Windows now :-)

&gt; Whats makes it worse is that we could handle this in a happy way that
&gt; notifies (reminmds) HTML mail senders, and hides HTML or strips it from
&gt; being seen on the list.

Last time I politely pointed out that people would get happier responses
if they turned off HTML mail, someone - and it wasn't me - managed to
create a flame war about it. I agree that we could handle this in a
happy way and so forth...Daryl Tester (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:dt@picknowl.com.au">dt@picknowl.com.au</A>) has
already offered a solution...

Personally I think people take e-mail far too seriously but then again,
that is my opinion. We can make of it what we will...

DL

ps.

I am not attempting to reignite this thread again. There comes a stage
where "accidents" happen too often..._far_ too often to ignore...
