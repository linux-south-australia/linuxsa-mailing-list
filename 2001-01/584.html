Sure why not let the surgeons practice on a few patients, doesn't matter that we lose a
few in the process, its hard knock learning experience and makes the surgeons feel good
about how they learned the _hard _way.  *NOT*

If I had a dollar for every accident, crash, hiccup and down right criminal negligence
claim because people were not trained at all / properly I could afford MS software for
life.  Try telling that to the judge" Oh sorry your honour I thought it best he learn
the hard way, how did I know he would kill himself in the process,  I thought he would
have more experience that way"

Hard knocks in my book come well after the basics are covered.  And the experience will
come after you have SAFELY managed the basics.

&gt; It wasn't long before I graduated to a more powerful machine - Dad's V8 ute.
&gt; Unfortunately, it took off in reverse a whole lot faster than I anticipated and
&gt; I accidentally ran down my younger brother.  The whole family was upset about
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway,  I learned my driving in the school of hard knocks.  The one thing I
&gt; have that no driving school can give is EXPERIENCE.  On that basis I reckon I
&gt; am a far better driver than any of those 'qualified' smart alecs.  Society
&gt; should recognise the real practical skills that people like me have, don't you
&gt; think?
