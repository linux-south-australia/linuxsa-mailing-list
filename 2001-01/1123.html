G'day,

&gt;  &gt; The real pointis that the internode guys keep telling about all the
&gt;  &gt; expense, which soudns very reaosnable and is, but they are not mentioning
&gt;  &gt; the techiniques they can and almost certianly do use to decrease actual
&gt;  &gt; bytes downloaded.
&gt;  &gt; Ie I dont think they are presenting a very accurate picture.

It's an extremely accurate picture.  Not everything gets cached and you're also
not even considering gnapster and people who receive Email with various movie
and other files that would never be cached.  

I'm not an Internode employee or at this point a customer of theirs, but I
definitely respect their comments made in this discussion as all of it is based
on reality, not on loss-leader advertising/wishful thinking.  

For once, a company comes along and is honest about the way things work and
don't bull-sh*t you about how their pricing system works. 

I appreciate that they take their Internet business seriously and intend to be
here long into the next decade (a zillion years in Internet time).  Their
business plan is sustainable.  They won't disappear when they receive their
next invoice for wholesale Internet data. 

&gt;  &gt; Yes but every time that someone mentions one of these ISPs that use a
&gt;  &gt; dffrent combination to gpood and fast, that person gets a interndoe person
&gt;  &gt; telling them why this is nto good, or how this is unsustainable, which is
&gt;  &gt; blatantly not true in many cases.
&gt;  
&gt; I take it you're referring to me, since I've been the one using the word
&gt; "unsustainable."

Most people on this list have the ability to find out for themselves just how
unsustainable a $25/month all you can eat type account really is.  If someone
doesn't want to believe it, they can set up their own system and have family
members leech off their system for $25/mo all you can download.  The party
won't last much longer than the first bills from the wholesale provider.  

&gt; As far as the historical record goes, I think there's ample evidence of
&gt; imploding ISPs to show that what I've been saying has quite a bit of 
&gt; merit.  But maybe you know something I don't.

Could it be that all the loss-leader advertising has made that deep of an
impression?

&lt;/soapbox&gt;

Cheers,
Gaelyne
