If you wanted to increase the swap partition, you could use Partition Magic
to shrink a partition close to it then recreate the swap partition when you
reboot.
Of course this is dependent on whether you can take the machine down, and on
how paranoid you are on playing with partitions on a server...... ;-)
(if you dont have PM i could forward you a copy of the boot disks from v6,
as long as you format them after use!! ;-)

Pete and all!

&gt; Obviously the easy way to fix some of the hassle would be a second hard
&gt; drive to house the cache, mainly to cut down the disk activity, having the
&gt; cache & the swapfile on the same drive isnt the best scenario.

Yes. I have suggested having a dedicated disk for the squid cache could
be beneficial.

&gt; A 64mb swap is probably a little underdone too, experiment with it a bit,
&gt; all depends what size your hard drive is.

I would have liked to but at the time I was working on it I was unable
to. Certainly if I do install another O/S I'll readjust how it's setup.

&gt; Also if you plan to upgrade to RH 6.2, try compiling a new kernel with
&gt; Reiserfs support & format your cache partition in Reiserfs.  I know
Reiserfs
&gt; does have some issues, but for a proxy cache its hardly a high risk if you
&gt; keep the partition separate.

Sounds like a good idea. I'll suggest that to them as well - besides it
does appear that ReiserFS is reasonably stable but it's "fsck" utility
is either slow (like slower than fsck.ext2) or a little unstable (i.e.
don't trust it). Luckily, the guy who knows the most about fsck.reiserfs
is coming back from holidays/exams so that should improve this year.

&gt; (i didnt use the kernel from here as I built my own, actually I u/g it to
&gt; 2.2.18 last week)

Unless I have to rebuild a kernel I like to install default kernels
built by the distributors. That way recovery is so much more easy...
