&gt; And as a side issue, listen up and listen good ATTITUDE IS WHAT GETS YOU EMPLOYED AND
&gt; KEEPS YOU THERE....NOT THE PAPERWORK, NOT THE ABILITY...ITS THE ATTITUDE... hire for
&gt; attitude and train for skill.  Ask any employer who has a tech with a bad attitude,
&gt; they will never go down that road again.

Um, there are tow sides to this.,
In the majority of cases atitiude may get you employed.

This in itself is a not good thing I think.

Like I said I was fortunate I was hired after taking a technical
examination. BY this I dont mean i]to make it soudn liek I kknew or know
everythign I neeed to know to tdo my job,. I don't, and am constantly
learning.
However teh practivcal emaniationI thik gives the employer a feel for how
you approach problems and that you have the basic fundamental knowledge
requried to approach those problems.

On the other hand...
I have worked at lots of places where peopel were hired on attitude.
Ie the level of confidence they displayed at the interview(s), and the
fact that if the employer said do you know about X the procpetive employee
says yes mentions a few buzwords and then if they are the best dressed and
have the ost bits of paper, proabbaly get the job.

This is bad.
A lot of the peopel I went to uni got jobs by being the best at creatve
writng(of their resumes), dressing well and acting(attitude).

They then lose their jobs quickly, move to other jobs typcially for
reasons such as "it was not going where I wanted to go"  or "they
expected too much from their employees" (ie "they expected me to be able 
to do what I said I could in the interview and I cant because I was
too imaginative in my abilities"),or other  meanginless reasons.


This leads to unhappy workers, unhappy clients and apparently unhapppy
employers.
(I recently read an article that wrote up teh results of a survey that
said tht on average most emplyoers woudl not rehire 30% of their staff. Ie
they made a mistake in hiring someone in 30% of the peopel they hired).
So whie l it may be true that many employers hire on attitude it is also
true that most employers in a fairly high percentageof cases regret doing
so.

There are lots of tools avaiable to employers who want to be more
careful about who they y hire, including practical examinations and
pyschological profiling (which in my experience _ i have undergone at
leeast two such profiles  - is very accurate).

Increasingly we are seeing these beign used. 
They are routinely used in large organisations.

The moral of this long story is if you get a job wholey based on
atttiude, particularly in techinal areas, dont be surprised if you or you
employer or clients are unhappy.

If I dont get a job because I didnt wear a suit, or because I answered
honestly (eg I said I _DONT_ knoW about this field) I am quite happy - it
is not the sort of place I want to work.

Employers might hire on attitude(at least the majority) but I try and
avoid those places if at all possible (ie if I am not too broke).
I know I probably wont be happy there.

The other part of the moral is that employers are beginign to learn that
hiring on attitude does not do them or their employes and clients justice,
particuarly in specialist/technical fields and are starting to use better
tehchniques than just the interview(s) to screen applicants.
