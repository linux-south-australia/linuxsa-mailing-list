&gt; I have just rebooted my computer after a rather strange occurance.  My
&gt; netscape froze for no apparent reason, which was strange enough in
&gt; itself, but then I clicked on the window menu so I could kill
&gt; netscape, and after clicking my machine started beeping wildly at me
&gt; and wouldn't stop.  It sounded a bit like I was holding down an
&gt; invalid key and so beeping multiply --- although it seemed to beep a
&gt; bit faster than that.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, thinking it might be a keyboard problem, I pulled the keyboard
&gt; out of its socket (and I pulled the mouse out too) and waited a while,
&gt; but the beeping continued.  After waiting some time, and not being
&gt; able to do much else, I rebooted the machine.
&gt; 
&gt; What went wrong?  Possible contenders are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I am running kernel 2.4.0-test10, so perhaps that has a bug in it?
&gt; 2.  I am running helix gnome and sawfish --- problem?
&gt; 3.  Hardware fault?
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Mark.

Many moden mother boards have a over temp alarm wich will beep repeatedly
check your bios settings . if you have an over temp alarm check to see what
temp it is set for.  
note if its set quite high and is still going off [ the bios should report the
temp for you]  check you cpu cooling fan it may not be working well.
