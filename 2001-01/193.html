Oh, theory schmeory. Politics do not belong on this list.

May I close this discussion by stating that all politicians suck, and
AFAIKS, the only people whose best interests they are cooncerned about are
themselves.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [lloy0076 said] if only our (stupid Liberal) government had the same idea.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; sigh.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Guess we should have voted for National Action^W^WOne Nation.
&gt;
&gt;Without getting into too much political debate:
&gt;
&gt;1)
&gt;
&gt;The Australian Labour Party's original platform was to support and help
&gt;Australian labour. This took many forms, one of the primary ones was the
&gt;prevention of labour that allowed itself to be exploited. And that
&gt;labour was black (1). One Nation and National Action's manifesto don't
&gt;differ significantly from the EFFECT of the old Labor Party platform,
&gt;but their reasons are different.
&gt;
&gt;Whilst the old Labor Party platform appears to have been an inept
&gt;attempt at keeping wages high (as opposed to shareholder's profits), the
&gt;parties you mention seem only to formulate their policies on race.
&gt;
&gt;The current "Liberal" government is a classical all-out capitalist
&gt;free-market driven bunch of whackos. If you were to read Adam Smith's
&gt;treatise on economic theory he would detest our interpretation of
&gt;capitalism. He clearly - and very clearly stated - he was a scientist
&gt;and tried his best to determine what was around him, and that you
&gt;shouldn't base one's judgments in economic matters just on science. I'm
&gt;certain he'd find Howard/Keating/Hawke's interpretration of capitalism -
&gt;i.e. let the free market destroy Australian industry and export
&gt;potential to the extent where we have to devalue our dollar to make up
&gt;the difference - quite abhominable.
&gt;
&gt;In fact, I'd hazard to say that Marx and Smith would detest our
&gt;society's economics as much as each other, if only for different
&gt;reasons.
&gt;
&gt;And before anyone goes off their high horse and adds "he's a Liberal,
&gt;Conservative, National Action" supporter to my various appelations, I am
&gt;on the right wing of a major left wing party. Now, I'll leave you to
&gt;work out which party that is...couldn't be too hard given there's only
&gt;two major one's in Australia and I don't vote Liberal...
&gt;
&gt;2)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Aynway... I'm really quite surprised that ATMs use MSDOS (or windows or
&gt;&gt; linux or anything really...)
&gt;
&gt;I was too. I'm trying to work my mind about it, but I guess I could
&gt;mangle ncurses to look like one of those atm screens....it's scary what
&gt;happens when one thinks "outside of the box"....
&gt;
&gt;&gt; unix or something... I was also suprised at the implication that ATMs use
&gt;&gt; intel hardware... Again, I expected something obscure... Does anyone know
&gt;&gt; what software and hardware combination our Australian ATMs tend to use? Has
&gt;&gt; anyone ever seen an ATM BSOD? :)
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm...do you think we'd get a sensible answer out of the banks if we
&gt;asked their tech staff outright?
&gt;

&gt;You're too late...
