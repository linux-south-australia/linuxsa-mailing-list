&gt;  I currently use Lucent WaveLAN gear for my Internet Connection to

At least one of you is likely to be breaking federal 
telecommunications law in the process. Exciting, isn't it?

&gt;This gear is really cheap (The genuine Lucent cards retail for about
&gt;$300, I believe) and an antenna, pigtail and all the bits add up to
&gt;about $600. The gear is capable of 10Mbit/Sec (It adjusts iself
&gt;according to noise / environment) which is nothing to sneeze at.

Performance claims on 802.11b spread spectrum equipment are even more 
bogus than performance claims for '56k' modems.

What you've forgotten to factor in, for a commercial service, are 
items including:

- site survey and install labour
- equipment maintenance
- extra hardware at the customer end to virtualise a customer circuit 
across the shared broadcast domain implemented by the radios, unless 
you really did want your next door neighbour (and his mate across 
town) to mount your filesystem while you surf
- impossibility of making any statement, at all, about QoS of the 
resulting service, or recovering from people running illegally 
over-powered links or just plain saturating the link with traffic 
beyond your control
- starting a company, gaining and paying for a carrier license so the 
activity is actually legal, and surviving the compliance costs of 
retaining that license

&gt;As the gear is capable of an Access Point mode, you can connect several
&gt;clients to one "Central" antenna, acting somewhat like a 10Mb hub --
&gt;sharing the central antenna.
&gt;

Yep. See above.

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; I'm mulling over a middle ground which I might call 'wireless ADSL'
&gt;  &gt; with a lower installation fee and a different QoS to the Agile
&gt;  &gt; wireless derived service. Its complicated by various issues and they
&gt;  &gt; aren't trivial - but it's 'on the list', yes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Possibly the Lucent gear is a solution? It's cheap for people to get,
&gt;install is trivial and costs pretty much nothing for data transport. I
&gt;know there are issues with the ACA etc. But I've been quite impressed
&gt;with the gear during the time that I've used it, and maybe a specialist
&gt;product could be worth a look. Maybe this could be 'Wireless ADSL' as it
&gt;is relatively easy to configure these things to run at rates similar to
&gt;ADSL (or faster :-)
&gt;
&gt;I'd be interested in your, and other people's opinions, comments etc on
&gt;the viability of such a delivery medium.

Its an absolutely sensible suggestion. And in various places around 
the world (mostly in countries where it's actually legal, but here in 
Australia, anyway, as well), various small communities are setting up 
their own wireless ethernet broadcast domains using this sort of gear.

They're getting popular because the entry cost, if you're keen and 
able to contribute your own labour without including that in the cost 
accounting, it can seem like an effective 'neighbourhood internet'.

There are some scaling issues, some QoS issues, some legal issues, 
some serious security issues (everyone's on the same broadcast 
domain, as already noted), but the biggest long term issue is the 
likely 'diminishing returns' effect as the cells run out of 
bandwidth, and everyone wishes a few less people had joined in - but 
they're not volunteering to leave.

This has an end game which has similarities with the 'tragedy of the 
commons' - if everyone's sharing a common resource and using it as 
much as they like, that works really really well until there is no 
longer enough common resource to go around.

[which, interestingly, is also the risk factor for all-you-can-eat 
ISP's - the pricing model looks viable until the ISP concerned runs 
out of their initial available bandwidth and hasn't got enough income 
to afford the next link upgrade]

Cheers,
Simon
