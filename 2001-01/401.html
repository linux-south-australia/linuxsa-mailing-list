&gt;David & All,
&gt;i am 19, and i have setup many linux machines from 486's to my laptop and i
&gt;believe i have a good grasp of the install process. i have been through
the kernel
&gt;panics and recompiles associatedwith it.
&gt;many a time i have re-installed because i felt like playing with partitions
&gt;etc.
&gt;i have many books, from programming to idiots guides to some of the unleashed
&gt;books, to web-design and php.
&gt;i am currently implimenting my home page in php4 & mysql, and also
building my
&gt;own gateway/webserver/firewall connected to a Linux/Windows 10baset
network. i
&gt;have worked in web design places, but i really want to be a sysadmin which
needs
&gt;a piece of paper!!i believe i have as much skill and experience as many of
you
&gt;do (perhaps not the sysadmin types, of course), but only having that
certificate
&gt;under your arm proves that.
&gt;i can do all of the common tasks, but until i have that certificate, no go!
&gt;i have intentionally bought & setup network equipment, set up samba, php4 and
&gt;mysql'd my web site, killed 486's celerons and the like, all in the name of
&gt;learning. TAFE is shit house, i have leart 100 times more stuff tinkering
with and
&gt;killing my network, breaking programs at home that TAFE could have taught me!
&gt;i hardly use samba, but i can say i have set it up, and know how to use and
&gt;administer it. this is the reason why!!

Ohh, wow, and angry young man :-)

Perhaps TAFE is not the right place for you. Maybe you should consider an
education at UniSA or Adelaide Uni.

The things that these places teach you can be learned on your own, but they
have a structured approach and the people who set up the courses try to
distill many many years of expeience and theory for you to benefit from.

So, tell me, why does setting 'socket options = TCP_NODELAY' improve the
performance of clients accessing Samba?

&gt;anyway, my two cents worth, why the current education system sucks.

I am not sure I like the exchange rate :-)

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; David!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no qualification that would satisfy me, other than experience.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I learned by doing.  I think that's the only way, but some people will
&gt;&gt; &gt; have a different view on the matter.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I agree with you wholeheartedly here except there are many
&gt;&gt; financially-unchallenged businesses who are willing to pay for people
&gt;&gt; who have pieces of people, despite the fact these are the same
&gt;&gt; businesses who will complain they can't afford to buy more electricity,
&gt;&gt; raise wages and other similar fiscal issues.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There is, I believe, a balance between practical, applied learning which
&gt;&gt; you allude to and theoretical learning. In my opinion our academic
&gt;&gt; institutions - especially the Universities - can't get things right.
&gt;&gt; They seem to be either "applied XYZ" but no theory - so a person can,
&gt;&gt; for example, be ABLE to set up NT Server to serve a site serving
&gt;&gt; millions but not WHY it works OR they lean the other way and land you
&gt;&gt; with all theory and NO hands on.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Personally, I learned by:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; * doing
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I installed linux and I reinstalled it at least 40 times before I was
&gt;&gt; satisfied I knew how to install it. There are some who don't have the
&gt;&gt; time or patience so a course may help them. But you can only see install
&gt;&gt; dramas for yourself if you are watching one...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; * reading
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have a rather large collection of computer books, mainly O'Reilly
&gt;&gt; based but some "Unleashed" series. To the unaware, the O'Reilly books
&gt;&gt; will make more sense if you know Linux or you have at least attempted
&gt;&gt; and failed to implement their subject. They are excellent books and they
&gt;&gt; tend to cover their subjects in great detail, but the downside is that
&gt;&gt; you can accidentally miss the wood for the trees.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; * asking this list and other lists
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Believe it or not I've suffered my own uncalld for flames too. I still
&gt;&gt; have a glitch with the "RTFM" without telling people where the manual is
&gt;&gt; or how to access it. Sometimes people don't read manuals simply because
&gt;&gt; they have no idea it exists...the caveat to talking on a list like this
&gt;&gt; is:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; a) there's bound to be someone who will kill you if you send your email
&gt;&gt; in HTML format
&gt;&gt; b) just because it's email doesn't mean people turn off their sense of
&gt;&gt; humour - but almost everyone has no sense of humour when they read what
&gt;&gt; they get
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; And a host of other problems. My own solution to these weaning problems
&gt;&gt; is to give as good as you get :-)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; * watching
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Go to the LinuxSA meetings and if you get the chance to see a "live"
&gt;&gt; system - whether it's a business system or just your next door
&gt;&gt; neighbours - ask. And don't STOP asking...how are you supposed to learn
&gt;&gt; about things if you don't know or won't ask about them? Although you may
&gt;&gt; strike a blast of sarcasm, arrogance or someone just being plain
&gt;&gt; patriotic, if you ignore the connotation and read what they actually SAY
&gt;&gt; you might find some gems of wisdom (1)...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; As I said before, James. Just go and do it and come running to us when
&gt;&gt; you encounter the first thing you don't understand and can't work out
&gt;&gt; how to fix...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; DL
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (1)
&gt;&gt; I maintain I generally always answer the question, or alternatively keep
&gt;&gt; on topic in a lateral manner of thinking at all times...
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; The hate stands ready...
&gt;&gt;  Send forth your terror into HELL!
