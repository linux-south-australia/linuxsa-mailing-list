James!

&gt; have worked in web design places, but i really want to be a sysadmin which needs
&gt; a piece of paper!!i believe i have as much skill and experience as many of you
&gt; do (perhaps not the sysadmin types, of course), but only having that certificate
&gt; under your arm proves that.

Oh? I work in system administration and I bluntly offered my services to
someone who seemed to remember me about six to eight months' later when
he needed someone to assist him in one of his bigger contracts...

&gt; i can do all of the common tasks, but until i have that certificate, no go!

Look here. You've said you're 19. I would suggest you cut this negative
frame of mind out of your thoughts immediately. If you change that to "I
can do all the common tasks - hell I've done them myself - I will get
myself a system administration job or contract and hope that my employer
will pay some HR development so I don't have to pay it myself"...

In the nicest, nicest manner: don't stuff your chances just because you
happen to think negatively. The power of positive thinking is
real...you're life is what you make out of it and if you decide that
you're not going to be employed because you have no pieces of paper,
then that will become one extra burden you carry around trying to get a
job.

&gt; learning. TAFE is shit house, i have leart 100 times more stuff tinkering with and
&gt; killing my network, breaking programs at home that TAFE could have taught me!

:-) Welcome to the real world...
