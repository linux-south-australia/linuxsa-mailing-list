Tim!

&gt; I'm tempted to try reiserfs for the heck of it for the /home part. Is this a
&gt; good/bad idea. Any personal pros and cons... Or should I just stick with
&gt; ext2. (after losing the last ext2 part I'm tempted to try something new).

ReiserFS seems to be OK but from what I've gleaned from the ReiserFS
mailing lists (yes, I lurk there and they are VERY busy) it is a little
fragile. And there appears to be some "should we support 2.2.X when
2.4.X comes out" issues about the place. My advice would be:

1) 

Yes, it would work; you're probably going about the "correct" way just
installing it on part of your system rather than taking the whole system
to Reiser.

2)

Make sure you back it up, no matter WHAT file system you happen to use;
one would think this goes without saying, but I'm allowed to preach what
I don't practice (at home at least - I managed to install AMANDA quite
successfully backing up a reasonable system for a place I contract to
[for?])

Naturally, you probably should start lurking on the mailing lists for
Reiser and so forth...

If you are using Linux 2.4.0 and RedHat 7.0 I would stick with ext2 as
it seems that RH 7.0 has, hmmm, how shall I put it? It has "issues"....
