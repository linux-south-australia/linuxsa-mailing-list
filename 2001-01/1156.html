A question from someone who doesn't know much about this kind of thing...

Why would an ISP (particularly a small one) want a secondary mail/DNS server
on the other side of the world? I understand the need for redundancy, etc.,
but would have thought that another ISP close by, or perhaps in another city
or even state, would be plenty good enough. You'd want to be sure that they
didn't share the same points of failure in their network connectivity, but I
would have thought that you could do this without going to the other side of
the world. I mean, if all routes to your server and to your secondary server
in another city are down, then I would have thought that it's too far gone
to worry about having a backup here... Assumedly, if the DNS is
innaccessible, then the servers it points to are mostly innaccessible too,
and if the mail server is down, then having a backup here won't help,
because clients wouldn't be able to get to it until the link returned
anyway... and if all the links are down, then the country's probably been
bombed or something, and there are more important things to worry about...
Am I completely wrong here?

&gt; I operate a small Internet presence firm in Connecticut, US. I'm
&gt; looking for an ISP in Australia that would be interested in colocating
&gt; one of our secondary name and mail servers (running linux, of course)
&gt; in return for us colocating one of their server here.
