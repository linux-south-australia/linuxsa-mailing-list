&gt; UDP is by definition an Unreliable data protocol (or something)

www.google.com &lt; "UDP Definition" [I'm Feeling Lucky]

"Short for User Datagram Protocol, a connectionless protocol that, like TCP,
runs on top of IP networks. Unlike TCP/IP, UDP/IP provides very few error
recovery services, offering instead a direct way to send and receive
datagrams over an IP network. It's used primarily for broadcasting messages
over a network."

www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/U/UDP.html

Isn't it great that we live in age where we can find anything by
Googling(tm) it.

UDP is good for listening to police broadcasts from Los Angeles, playing
Quake, etc.  TCP/IP would demand to send all the packets and make sure they
arrived, so if any connection anomolies arise, the whole thing would get
terribly out of sync while it tries to play catchup.  It doesn't matter if
the client never gets a few packets correctly.  It'll live.

The bottom line is:  If you need to get a whole bunch of data from place to
another unmolested, then TCP/IP is used.  If you have lots of continually
changing data to transport quickly and it's not vitally important to have
every single scrap of information, then UDP will do better.

If you want to find out how many ms there are between two points, ICMP is
the stuff.

Thats how I see it anyway.  As with everyone else, I'm continually learning.
If anyone has anything to add that i've missed, I'm happy to hear it.
