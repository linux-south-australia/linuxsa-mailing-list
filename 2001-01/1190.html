&gt; When 
&gt; running a 100mb/s adapter in a server, with all the clients having 10mb/s
&gt; adapters, would having this adapter in the server quicker than the rest be
&gt; an advantage?? As in, when the server uploads, would it send data out at say
&gt; 20mb/s when sending packets to two clients with 10mb/s adapters??

You should find the network will run at the slowest speed of 10MHz 
(assuming you are using plain hubs and not routers/switches)
and of course that all other topography is normal for the given medium.  
The most important issue will not be the medium, but the adapters
speed (and if the 100MB/S can switch to lower speed)

remember, the data can't pump faster than the card works otherwise u 
will get a data overflow on the MAC frame buffer - result is data loss.
The server regrettably won;t work at 20MB/s due to the constraints of 
the slower cards reading the data, if at all, in part the neduim quality
affects the data stream on the cable (this requires knowledge of RF 
electrical characteristics to explain) and the higer rate will also give 
rise to
greater signal degradation than the receiver can handle.

&gt; 
&gt; Would there be a site on the internet that goes into all the basics of say,
&gt; the tech/hardware side of running/setting up somn like an ISP. I'm just
&gt; interested in what kind of hardware they use as in
&gt; hubs/connections/switches/adapters/interfaces.

Perhaps you could also look at this site i found:

wwwhost.ots.utexas.edu/ethernet

(whuch i have just confirmed still exists) and has a fairly complete 
explanation in there

and also look at CISCO

<A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/">http://www.cisco.com/</A>
and 3COM

<A HREF="http://www.3com.com/">http://www.3com.com/</A>
as they are two big players in the IT communications field.

After you have absorbed the first site, use the search engines and look 
around for more stuff, there is buckets if it out there

good luck

greg

&gt; TIA!
