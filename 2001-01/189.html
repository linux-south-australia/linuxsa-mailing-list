Richard!

&gt;&gt; [lloy0076 said] if only our (stupid Liberal) government had the same idea.

&gt; 
&gt; sigh.
&gt; 
&gt; Guess we should have voted for National Action^W^WOne Nation.

Without getting into too much political debate:

1)

The Australian Labour Party's original platform was to support and help
Australian labour. This took many forms, one of the primary ones was the
prevention of labour that allowed itself to be exploited. And that
labour was black (1). One Nation and National Action's manifesto don't
differ significantly from the EFFECT of the old Labor Party platform,
but their reasons are different.

Whilst the old Labor Party platform appears to have been an inept
attempt at keeping wages high (as opposed to shareholder's profits), the
parties you mention seem only to formulate their policies on race.

The current "Liberal" government is a classical all-out capitalist
free-market driven bunch of whackos. If you were to read Adam Smith's
treatise on economic theory he would detest our interpretation of
capitalism. He clearly - and very clearly stated - he was a scientist
and tried his best to determine what was around him, and that you
shouldn't base one's judgments in economic matters just on science. I'm
certain he'd find Howard/Keating/Hawke's interpretration of capitalism -
i.e. let the free market destroy Australian industry and export
potential to the extent where we have to devalue our dollar to make up
the difference - quite abhominable.

In fact, I'd hazard to say that Marx and Smith would detest our
society's economics as much as each other, if only for different
reasons.

And before anyone goes off their high horse and adds "he's a Liberal,
Conservative, National Action" supporter to my various appelations, I am
on the right wing of a major left wing party. Now, I'll leave you to
work out which party that is...couldn't be too hard given there's only
two major one's in Australia and I don't vote Liberal...

2)

&gt; Aynway... I'm really quite surprised that ATMs use MSDOS (or windows or
&gt; linux or anything really...)

I was too. I'm trying to work my mind about it, but I guess I could
mangle ncurses to look like one of those atm screens....it's scary what
happens when one thinks "outside of the box"....

&gt; unix or something... I was also suprised at the implication that ATMs use
&gt; intel hardware... Again, I expected something obscure... Does anyone know
&gt; what software and hardware combination our Australian ATMs tend to use? Has
&gt; anyone ever seen an ATM BSOD? :)

Hmmm...do you think we'd get a sensible answer out of the banks if we
asked their tech staff outright?
