&gt;Hmmm...
&gt;
&gt;I managed to get VMware running on an "out of the box" RH7.0 install
&gt;just a few days ago. There is a bug in the 2.2.16 kernel that effects
&gt;the virtual CD but that is minor in the greater scheme of things...

OK, maybe I was mistaken about that one ... It's hard to remember now after
all the hacking I did over the Christmas break ...

Maybe the problem I had was I had modified the LAPB driver so you can
specify its mode (DTE vs DCE) on module load, and all worked well under
RH6.2, but try as I might, I could not get it to compile under RH7.0 with
the supplied 2.2.16 kernel, so I pulled down 2.2.18 and built that, but
then I needed the PCMCIA stuff and so on it went.

Fortunately, things work OK now that I run 2.2.18 on my Laptop and 2.4.0 on
my BP6.

I also felt a lot better after the coding binge where I implemented an SMB
client library over the break. It is great to have a GTK+ program that can
browse the network and see all the workgroups, servers, shares, files, etc
on your Windows network.
