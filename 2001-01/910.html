&gt; I supposed we could conceivably set up an excess charging policy

&gt; other people would go for that?

Observation: if you accidentally leave the phone off the hook to Israel or
not notice a mains pressure leak on your hot water system there is
precedent I've heard of for Telstra and the former E&WS to waive the bill,
at their discretion. It isn't written anywhere, nobody could hold them to
it as far as I know. But it is in the spirit of what you describe as
supporting "normal people living normal lives". This sounds a bit like
what you are proposing to formalise. I don't know how well it maps though.

Suggestion: in my work with intelligent houses I have been surprised at
how often people respond to having big, easily-seen meters of some
description (eg on a computer screen, or a big digital readout somewhere)
giving them instantaneous and cumulative readings of items such as energy
use, energy efficiency, water use. A meter or two with a clear explanation
(and maybe, projection) of what consumption patterns mean might help you
out here.
