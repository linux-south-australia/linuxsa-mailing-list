Hi Brenton

If you can run the dos program chkdsk and check the disk and it comes up with 
bad sectors you can return the drive and they should take it. There is no 
excuses from suppliers these days to having bad sectors on a drive.

&gt; G'day,
&gt;
&gt; Looking for some suggestions on how to diagnose a known flaky disk
&gt; but which currently refuses to fail...
&gt;
&gt; About six months ago, a hard disk started making very worrying
&gt; klunking noises, followed by the very obvious noise of
&gt; the spindle motor ramping up after having been stopped.  Sounded
&gt; very much like a head crash, except that only one or two spots
&gt; on the disk seemed to be affected... the rest of the disk works
&gt; fine.
&gt;
&gt; I've just discovered that the failed drive is still under
&gt; warranty, and so would like to return it for replacement.
&gt;
&gt; Trouble is, now I can't make it fail.
&gt;
&gt; Presumably some intelligence on the drive has mapped out
&gt; the bad sectors, and so diagnostics, including those
&gt; provided by the manufacturer, report that all the sectors
&gt; of the disk are okay.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't run badblocks(8) yet, that's next...
&gt;
&gt; So two questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1) What other tools are available to exercise the disk?  Compiling
&gt; the kernel certainly creates activity, but I'd prefer something
&gt; that is more systematic (and thorough!)
&gt;
&gt; 2) Can you obtain a list of bad blocks from an IDE (ATA?) drive?
&gt; (Yes, I know that this is supported by SCSI drives, but that's
&gt; not the question here.)
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
