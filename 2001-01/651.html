Hi,

Having carefully read Simon's message, I must say that I really appreciate
the level of effort that Internode/Agile are putting into aDSL, and can
understand the delays that this has caused.

It certainly also reinforces my views of our favourite monopoly.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear Richard,
&gt;
&gt;To respond to your criticism (below), I would like to explain why we 
&gt;haven't yet launched xDSL formally in Adelaide.
&gt;
&gt;Since people on the linuxsa list tend to enjoy details, I'll supply them.
&gt;
&gt;The core reason is that we are absolutely insisting that we _do_ get 
&gt;it right before we open the doors. Yes, we've had to revise our 
&gt;intended launch date by four weeks as a result.
&gt;
&gt;The reasons why its taking some time are manyfold, and I'm going to 
&gt;lay them out here. They include resolution of our internal 
&gt;provisioning procedures - and some technical issues - to ensure that 
&gt;when we open the door, we can, and will, service our customers 
&gt;professionally and promptly.
&gt;
&gt;The service works fine technically, at a low level. At a high level, 
&gt;we're working to resolve a few issues which Telstra has imposed upon 
&gt;us to limitations inherent in the technical choices that they have 
&gt;made in providing us with infrastructure access to deliver the 
&gt;service.
&gt;
&gt;Those technical limitations include some which make it impossible for 
&gt;Telstra, at present, to offer ADSL as a business focussed and/or high 
&gt;quality home service, including providing static IP addressing and 
&gt;other features that we know our professional customers will expect. 
&gt;We've nailed effective ways to provide those things despite the 
&gt;limitations in the underlying service because we know our customers 
&gt;want them.
&gt;
&gt;To resolve those issues, we have been developing our product around 
&gt;the use of Cisco DSL customer premises equipment, instead of the 
&gt;cheap and cheerful Alcatel boxes that Telstra pitches to their own 
&gt;customers at present - and which are part of the problem.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, yet again, Cisco haven't yet done what we need either 
&gt;- there is a specific IOS feature change we need in order to deliver 
&gt;the flexible and effective service we want to deliver, making it both 
&gt;easier to use and more powerful than the options pitched to the 
&gt;market by Telstra.
&gt;
&gt;I have been in weekly phone and email discussion with Cisco engineers 
&gt;both in Sydney and in San Jose working on getting this issue 
&gt;resolved, and the delays in doing so are the other major barrier to 
&gt;our being comfortable in launching the service right now. I expect 
&gt;that to be resolved Real Soon Now, as I've (just) found a workaround 
&gt;that will get things moving in the meantime.
&gt;
&gt;To make it worse, to date, mysterious delays within Telstra mean that 
&gt;Cisco have been unable to have their equipment certified to connect 
&gt;to Telstra phone lines, despite _significant_ effort on their part to 
&gt;push Telstra along to get this done. This is one of those 'any day 
&gt;now' issues, that was anticipated to be resolved in two weeks, about 
&gt;two months ago.  It was supposed to be 'definitely' resolved by today 
&gt;- and it isn't. Mysteriously, Cisco just don't seem to be making it 
&gt;to the top of the testing list. Strange, isn't it. The issue isn't 
&gt;technical, I am 100.0% sure of that.
&gt;
&gt;In summary: While I am sure you didn't mean to imply incompetence on 
&gt;our part in your comments, below, by saying we 'can't get it right', 
&gt;I wanted to underscore for your benefit and that of others that it 
&gt;is, absolutely, our drive to deliver a competent, supportable, and 
&gt;effective service.
&gt;
&gt;To do that, we have insisted that this service is an example of a new 
&gt;drive inside our organisation to make sure that when you ask us to 
&gt;pick up a ball, we don't drop it again.
&gt;
&gt;In other words, my own quality focus is the issue, because I know 
&gt;that if I don't insist on our organisation delivering a quality 
&gt;solution in this realm, we might as well not bother at all. We have a 
&gt;great technical reputation, and I'm insisting that ADSL is something 
&gt;that underscores, rather than damages, this reputation!
&gt;
&gt;We are hugely, hugely aware of how important it is to get this out of 
&gt;the door rapidly, and we're working on it as hard as we can, 
&gt;commensurate with the roadblocks I've noted above (compounded with 
&gt;the major one - that Telstra held back the access we needed to the 
&gt;network itself until the day of the launch of their retail service, 
&gt;which meant we've had to start from behind and run like the devil - 
&gt;and that's exactly what we're doing)
&gt;
&gt;So to paraphrase your comment - we insist on not (knowingly) getting it
wrong!
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure you'd be less than impressed if we promised you a service 
&gt;and it didn't work properly on arrival, and you'd be telling the 
&gt;linuxsa list all about _that_ as well.
&gt;
&gt;Be assured that I'm less than happy about the delay, too - and 
&gt;acutely aware that we're letting people down in having to wait a bit 
&gt;longer before we can open the doors.
&gt;
&gt;I ask for your patience, and for your continued (and appreciated) 
&gt;support of a local company doing great things in the face of the 
&gt;mediocrity of the Telstra offerings in general, and in this space in 
&gt;particular. I believe you'll be impressed with the results.
&gt;
&gt;The actual low level service stability during our test deployments 
&gt;has been excellent - I'm sending this via an Agile ADSL service now, 
&gt;in fact.  So we expect the outcome to be very good indeed, Real Soon 
&gt;Now.
&gt;
&gt;I am asking you to be patient, and I know that isn't a happy thing to 
&gt;ask.  But I'm asking it anyway. Please wait.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Simon Hackett
&gt;Internode / Agile
