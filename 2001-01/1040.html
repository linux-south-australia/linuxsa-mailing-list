Of course, one way to get the most out of your internet connection, in terms
of bandwidth, speed and time, is to implement a decent caching proxy server
(squid, etc) on your linux box (either firewall or some other machine). It's
possible to use squid as a transparent proxy if you want (look it up), or
you can just go with a normal cache... Also, you may as well attmept to peer
your cache with that of your ISP, usually as a child-only... I would assume
that most ISPs would be doing cache peering with other ISPs, but if yours
isn't, find out what ISP is the closest to your ISP (and preferably, has the
lowest data costs as well), and do a child-peer with them... You'll find
your effective connection speed increases, and you use less bandwidth. If
you're lucky, you may even end up reducing the cost per Mb to your ISP, by
using their cheaper connections more than their more expensive
connections... I know Lincoln College used to do this with Smug at Adelaide
Uni, as traffic between the two was free, and our 20+Gb cache plus their
couple-of-Gb cache, plus I think Adelaide's multi-Gb cache made for a lot of
cache in which to store the popular files...
