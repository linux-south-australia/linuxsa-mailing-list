there is a business model called 'running at a loss' radio stations do it
all the time with 'commercial free weekends'

nothing is wrong with this, it does pay for itself in market share
and that's work a hellofa lot more than mere megabytes.

no one has mentioned what these companies 'make' from their high end
customers, one could contend that perhaps a couple of contracts on the
bhp, cba etc end of town do actually make their books balance, regardless
of the not that great loss from keeping a few 'geeks:)' happy with cheap
access.

probably the average 'unlimited' customer is really looking for a fixed
rate - budget piece of mind, rather than the deal of their lifetime.

i'd suggest that backyard isps that go bust with unlimited bandwidth - 
the isdn link supporting 50 modems and 250 customers &lt;G&gt; - just don't
have the sales staff to bring in the big bikkies.

lets face it, with the ridiculous cost of tv advertising, getting public
support by offering these 'great' deals would be a drop in the ocean
to a well managed multinational telco.

just my ideas :)
