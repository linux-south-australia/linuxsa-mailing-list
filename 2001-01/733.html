G'day all, i'm fairly new to this mailing list, but i think its great that
you can post your queries up on the board and hope someone can answer your
question. I also think its great because you can learn about other peoples
problems, and if they so happen to mess up your system, you'll have a fair
idea on how to fix it.

As the subject states, i'd like to raise the whole topic of linux as a
workstation/client, as i would love to be using linux as a workstation.
Although i simply dont think its user friendly enough to be using it as a
workstation for one. The second reason i cant use it as a workstation is
because the software needed daily on my machine i cant find for Linux. This
would be advanced HTML editors, graphics editors for web graphics, and so
on. The software i need has been made for the windows OS, as nearly everyone
in this world today is out to make some $$$, they would be stupid to write a
program for another OS if they wanted to make some serious cash.

Dont get me wrong, i love linux. I love learning about linux, its the best
server OS i have dealt with. I just strongly beleive that Linux will have to
get some serious work done on their software supported, before any 100%
newbies start using it as a workstation over microsofts products.

Why has microsoft succeeded in having their OS on 80% of machines worldwide?
1) because their OS complies to what the users want, and gives you nothing
else - its simple
2) because its user friendly
3) because mr gates was around at a good time to write an OS for IBM

Hey i might be wrong. But give me a break - i'm 16. Give me some credit,
wouldnt you rather see the kids learning about computers, or whatever they
like doing than on the streets doing drugs, and causing trouble.

I hope i have made some sort of contribution here, and i hope you'll respect
what i've said rather than just make smart ass comments relating to
spelling, grammar, my opinions.

Thank you.

Adam W.
