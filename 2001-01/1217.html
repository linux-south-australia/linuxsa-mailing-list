&gt; &gt; We are considering a move to DAT or DLT.  DLT is more expensive than DAT,
&gt; &gt; but has twice the capacity: 40GB uncompressed vs 20GB uncompressed (DDS4),
&gt; &gt; but is somewhat more expensive (not quite twice ...).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What have been the experiences with these devices out there, especially
&gt; &gt; where they are used (written to) each day?
&gt;
&gt; Our experience with DLT Drives has been that they are very fragile -- We use
&gt; Sun E series servers and the DLT drives that Sun provide, and they are very
&gt; sensitive to how they are treated... We replaced one mechanism about three
&gt; times in as many months, and had multiple firmware upgrades and so on. The
&gt; tapes are also delicate... If the tape header (the little metal hook) is
&gt; bent at all, then the drive mechanism reaches out to get it, and pulls it in
&gt; to the winder, and then doesn't ever come out, as it depends on the tape to
&gt; pull it back out again... Great drives otherwise though...

We have a StorageTek silo with six DLT drives in it, which has had to have
a series of services on it recently. Then again, I have a machine under my
desk with a Quantum DLT drive that has never hickuped.

I would have to say DON'T use DDS3 -- we have had constant problems with
getting reliable reads from the things. We have an outsourcer who makes 4
DDS3 tapes a week, which we immediately read, and the failure rate is
about 25%. Some of these tapes don't even read when immediately tested on
the machine that wrote them.

Also, we have found that Digital tapes are much less reliable than those
from Sony.

Cheers,
Mikal
