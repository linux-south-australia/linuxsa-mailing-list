Hi There!

&gt; As the subject states, i'd like to raise the whole topic of linux as a
&gt; workstation/client, as i would love to be using linux as a workstation.

This topic is likely to start a heated discussion. You might want to
look up at the mailing list archives the thread on Linux in schools that
fairly much argues this subject in relation to schools specifically.

&gt; Although i simply dont think its user friendly enough to be using it as a
&gt; workstation for one.

Some would disagree. It depends on what you mean by "user friendly". I
know people who would be better off with a locked down Linux system
(where they didn't know how to get to the root passwords) - those type
of people who insist on fiddling with everything. I'm certain at least a
quarter of glitches that happen with Windows isn't really the operating
system's fault. Rather the operator who doesn't know buggers something
up...

&gt; in this world today is out to make some $$$, they would be stupid to write a
&gt; program for another OS if they wanted to make some serious cash.

No money? People, especially businesses, will pay for good software no
matter what platform it is written for.

&gt; server OS i have dealt with. I just strongly beleive that Linux will have to
&gt; get some serious work done on their software supported, before any 100%
&gt; newbies start using it as a workstation over microsofts products.

I am inclined to agree here. But this is a chicken and egg problem. If
there's no market for supporting Linux on the workstation, then there's
less support. If there's less support, there's going to be less market.

&gt; 1) because their OS complies to what the users want, and gives you nothing
&gt; else - its simple

Because they have told users what they want. And their users are
following them like sheep. They possibly try to infiltrate the education
systems to make people more dependant on them...

&gt; 2) because its user friendly

To a certain extent. Mac OS, once you get used to it, is more user
friendly.

&gt; Hey i might be wrong. But give me a break - i'm 16. Give me some credit,
&gt; wouldnt you rather see the kids learning about computers, or whatever they
&gt; like doing than on the streets doing drugs, and causing trouble.

What's this got to do with Linux as a client or a work station? Are you
trying to troll?

&gt; I hope i have made some sort of contribution here, and i hope you'll respect
&gt; what i've said rather than just make smart ass comments relating to
&gt; spelling, grammar, my opinions.

1)

You spell fine. I wish some others did too...

2)

Your grammar is fine. I wish some others were...

3)

You are entitled to your opinion. Just so long as it is the same as mine
:-P
