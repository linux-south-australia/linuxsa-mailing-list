Research seems to indicate the opposite.  Authors of a 1999 paper
supposed
this was because spell checkers removed the sanction of teachers that
occurs when K-6 students explore the language.  Others claim that the
study
is skewed as computers only available to rich schools, therefore results
skewed towards homes more likely to read to their children.

Note that last point.  Reading to your children is still the most
effective single strategy for teaching K-6 literacy.  Schools have less
to do with it than parents, something that I wish John Laws would
understand.

I don't know of any research into the effects of word processing
on 7-12 literacy.  This isn't too surprising.  It's only been the
last few years when computers have become ubiquitous enough for
such a study not to be skewed by local factors.  We might need
to wait a few years yet for firm results.


&gt; Schools should focus on giving students the skills (for want of
&gt; a better word) that they will need for life -- thinking, reasoning,
&gt; expressing, understanding, learning, inventing.

Schools would argue that using word processing is done precisely to
improve written expression.

You should not also ignore the look of the finished product.  Children
are excited about seeing their work printed looking like a book.  And
motivating students is one of the best tactics for letting them learn.

There is a huge amount of work that goes into developing a curriculum.
There's very little class time that doesn't address wider goals than the
immediate task at hand.  As you wrote, computing isn't an end in itself.

My concern is that the huge amount of work in curriculum development
does allow for vendor lockin of the entire education process.  For
example, a vendor could present curriculum and teaching materials that
refer exclusively to its products.  And this concern isn't only
limited to Microsoft, but extends to McDonalds and some other
companies.  It is very difficult for schools to refuse these offers,
and perhaps they should not if the school goes in with its eyes open.


I need to point out here that these are my views, and not those
of my employer (who works at the nexus of computers, networks,
education and research).
