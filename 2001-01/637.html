I am dismayed to see so many arguments in this thread which
simply advocate specific non-MS products as the panacea for
computer education. This merely perpetuates the continuing
(and disturbing) trend in state schools towards vocational
training rather than a real education.

"Use the latest version of Product X and your kids will be
ready for the 21st century", and "Products Y & Z aren't as
good for your kids because..." have been shovelled onto
parents for years. By lots of companies selling lots of
things. If we enter the battle for hearts & minds at this
level then our voices will be lost in the din.

IMO we would do better if we showed school decision makers
that many alternatives to Microsoft's flagship products do
exist which can fulfil *educational* objectives. These
alternatives need not necessarily be Linux products.

The *real* emphasis in computer education needs to be on
concepts and broad understanding - not how to automatically
do 5 point Arial Italic footnote subscripts in the latest
version of Word. Or StarOffice, or KOffice,...

I'm sure we all know some recent school leavers, and
graduates of computer courses, who are completely baffled by
messages such as "disk full". Or unable to comprehend the
concept of compressed files; or HTML vs Text in email. Why?
Because their "education" has focused on performing a
limited sequence of actions in a few specific programs. This
may be Education Dept policy - maybe they want zombies? - or
simply a reflection of many teachers' lack of computer
skills. 

To counter the effects of state school "computer education"
I ensured that my own children had access to a wide variety
of programs & systems to play with after hours. This has
enormously increased their understanding of what a computer
does and can do.

For example, a few months ago I met my 13 y.o.'s computer
teacher for the first time. Her opening comment was "What's
a Beowulf cluster? Your son wants to build one at
school...."


cheers, 
Fraser Farrell
