&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't.
&gt; 
&gt; AOL seems to run their Australian service out of the US. This means that
&gt; your ip requests are routed through the AOL servers in the US, with some
&gt; local caching. The recent Singapore link outage really showed the
&gt; inadequacy of the arrangement in my opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know anything about connecting to them with linux.

&gt; &gt; ok gang,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i am about to sign up with AOL but first i wan to know:
&gt; &gt; 1) can i dial-up their server without their "AOL" software?
&gt; &gt; 2) what other limitations do they have as fare as their ISP access goes?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the reason i ask is that when i called to find out about this - they didnt 
&gt; &gt; seem to know what linux was... anyway....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks for your help,

Dunno if someone covered this earlier, but AOL (Aust) is owned by both AmericaOnline and AAPT (Telecom NZ).
The two plan packs available (4hr / unlimited) are reasonably priced, and AOL are giving away a heap of prizes (50 per month), 5 of which are computers (IIRC). 
But... I'ts still AOL :(
That means you still must use their software, and I wouldn't do that.
