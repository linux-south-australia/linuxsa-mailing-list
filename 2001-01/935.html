&gt; ok, what about a free serve of beef wellington at the hilton,
&gt; included with the price you paid for the room.

Free....or included with the price of the room - which is it?

&gt; what about a free upgrade to business class, because there is a
&gt; spare seat, and the ticketing clerk liked you?

I already fly business class.

&gt; work out the *average* use, how much that costs and charge
&gt; accordingly.

No thanks, I've seen too many ISPs go broke trying that, it just
isn't a model that can work on any scale IMNSHO.

I've been there, done that.  I built or helped build more ISPs
than I care to remember (one mine, many as a consultant), and
the ones that are still trading successfully today are not the
ones that provide any form of truely unlimited access.

The proof is in the pudding - which is included in the price of
said pudding, or free if you want to think of it that way.

At the end of the day, it is a (relatively) free country and,
people like me who are prepared to pay for the priveledge of
being able to demand higher quality service (regardless of
industry), are entitled to do so.

Cheers

Leigh
