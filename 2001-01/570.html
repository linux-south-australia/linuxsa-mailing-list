Hi Group,

In my spare time (not!), I'm helping a community development group to
create an archives CD. We've got thousands of scans of non-ocr'able
documents, which are saved as image files. I'm wrapping the image files up
in html and dumping the whole lot onto CD along with the history of the
group which links in all the scanned documents.

Anyway, my question:

Is there a way of creating an AUTOSTART.INF on the CD that will cause it
to load the index.html in the default web browser automatically on W9x
boxes, AND create that .INF file on linux. I have the source for a Visual
Basic solution, but no VB..



FYI, Linux (mostly) based tools I have been using for the project:

Along the way, I've found and created a few simple tools to ease the
burden of handling so many files:

Compupic (yes, I even paid for it!) for quickly viewing and cropping the
images on screen.

Xnview for batch processing to size and depth.

tiffsplit for extracting tiffs out of multipage tiff archives (from the
scanning co)

SmartHTML as a preprocessing language to take the (simple) marked up plain
text and process it into html.

And a couple of shell scripts to pick up a list of images and wrap them in
html, such that clicking on one image leads you to the next.

Oh, and I must repent because I sinned a couple of times by using the iMac
for some scanning and creating a few graphics files that were easier to do
in GraphicConverter than the gimp. The rest of the project has been done
exclusively on Linux. I even used StarOffice to convert incoming word
files to plaintext...

Regards and thanks,

Michael
