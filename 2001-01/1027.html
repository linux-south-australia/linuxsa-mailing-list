Hi Josh,

I actually paid $15 per diskette, planning to eventually pass them on to
someone that does Multimedia. They are keen users of LS diskettes! For
the time being, I'll be weighting my chances whether to try or not, even
though I could throw away $15, but if it works... :o) I'll think about
it for some time, I considered to dedicate them to Linux, then if I will
have no need for them anymore, they could've been re-formatted to be
used in windows. See, I've got an old computer dedicated to Linux, not
too fast, but does its job for the time being and all this thanks to
people like you. Many people from LinuxSA have help me since I started a
few years ago with RedHat 5.0. Funny, there are sooo many changes,
versions and so on ...
LinuxSA is a very nice community :o)
Thanks for having you around!
Best wishes,

Nick.

&gt; &gt; Yes indeed, you are right, it does say that one should not re-format the
&gt; &gt; diskette!
&gt; &gt; Never read that information! Can't play around with them can I? This is
&gt; &gt; not fair and in the same time would be a pity to destroy an 120MB
&gt; &gt; storage device.
&gt; 
&gt; Give it a bash.  Its possible that they can't handle FAT or something
&gt; microsoftly weird like that.  We only ever tried them on windows; so perhaps
&gt; ext2 might be nicer to them.  Although it is a shame that it costs $20 a
&gt; throw if it fails.
