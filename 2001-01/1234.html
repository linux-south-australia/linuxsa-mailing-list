&gt;Hi, i'm just reading up on Virtual LAN, how they work, what they do etc.

Cool, Vlan's are nifty if you're working mostly with ethernet.

&gt;I was just wondering. Does Virtual LAN switching enable you to select users
&gt;connected to different ports on a switch, and put them in different
&gt;collision domains no matter what segment of the network they come from.

Yes, although VLAN's are often more useful and interesting as a way to have
multiple networks running over the same physical link (a VLAN trunk between
switches) without them being able to 'see' each other. If you just want to
seperate your network into walled segments, 2 ordinary switches might be
cheaper than one that supports vlans (but then you'd have to physically move
patch cables to switch a user between segments, instead of
'clickety-click-done' on the keyboard).

A side effect of this is that it's a way of saving on router ports (which
are often very expensive). You can run a single ethernet cable between a
vlan switch and a router (or linux box) that understands vlans, and use it
to route data between network segments, at the same time doing firewalling
and accounting if needed. This could be handy in a windows environment where
many people insist on sharing drives without passwords.

It might also be useful in a place where you can't trust the users to stick
with the IP address you've assigned them. You could assign each user a VLAN
and appropriate routing restrictions so that they can only receive (and
send) traffic destined for (or originate from) the IP subnet assigned to
their vlan, regardless of ARP announcements or packet spoofing.

&gt;For example.
&gt;
&gt;Segment 1 - 3 users, a1, b1, c1, connected via a hub.
&gt;
&gt;segment 2 - 4 users, a2,b2,c2,d2, connected via a SWITCH.
&gt;
&gt;Can you select to put users a2, c2, and b1 into one Virtual LAN. and the
&gt;other users in another VLAN??
&gt;Or have i somehow misunderstood the use, purpose and function of VLAN
&gt;Technology??

You can do something similar to what you describe, but not exactly, since
VLAN's won't work over a hub. Another neat thing about VLAN's is that any
old ethernet device can be a part of one without having to know anything
about them. Hence, when you plug a hub into a switch on a port with a
designated VLAN, all of the users on the hub are part of that particular
Virtual Lan.

One more thing, vlan's come in at least 2 flavours, 802.1Q and ISL. The
former is the more open standard supported by linux and just about
everything that works with vlan's, the latter is the Cisco proprietary
standard (although some Cisco gear doesn't support it :).

At least one member of this list develops vlan code as part of his job, so
I'm sure he'll comment if I've got anything wrong :)
