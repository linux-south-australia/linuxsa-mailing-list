G'day David,

    You probably know this already, but you really NEED Ken Beyer's
excellent exposition on loading RH 6.2 on the Toshiba Tecra 8100.  The site
can be contacted at

<A HREF="http://wtsupport.metatec.net/technotes/redhat6.2-tecra8100.html">http://wtsupport.metatec.net/technotes/redhat6.2-tecra8100.html</A>

    This is the best I have seen.  It talks about RH6.2, but it is quite
relevant to RH7.0.  As you will no doubt read in his article, there are 4
ways of getting X to work.  Xig

<A HREF="http://www.xig.com">http://www.xig.com</A>

puts out a driver which you can download, and it works for 10 minutes after
which it cuts out.  For the princely sum of $US129, you too can have a
working copy.  I haven't bought the copy, I feel it is too pricey.  (After
purchasing a Tecra?).  I can vouch for the display, it is great.

    S3 Savage have also put out their drivers (binary only) and they can be
contacted on

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.S3.com/pub/S3/mobile/270_290/">ftp://ftp.S3.com/pub/S3/mobile/270_290/</A>

    (There is an underscore between 270 and 290).  I haven't tried this
driver yet, because of lack of time, pressure of work and an incredibly
peripatetic lifestyle.  When I get time, I will do it.  As yet I haven't
tried X-4.x.  All in good time, when I get it.  I have also had other
interests.

    There are other descriptions on how to get the soundcard (Yamaha YMF744)
working using ALSA, how to get the modem (Lucent MARS DSP), a winmodem,
going.

    As far as your Xircom is concerned, forget it.  They won't release
drivers nor any details about their card.  I got a D-Link NIC which works
just a treat.  One little caveat, however, your PCMCIA module is not loaded
until some time after the lo interface message comes up.  In the end it all
works.  Another alternative to this might be the NetComm Truconnect joint
NIC and modem to fit in your PCMCIA slots.  I haven't tried this as yet, but
it looks good.  Reference PC Active Issue 4 February 2001, page 94.  It
might also be on

<A HREF="http://www.pcactive.com.au">http://www.pcactive.com.au</A>

    I hope this is of some interest to you.  I envy you your RAM and hard
disk.  I only have 128 MB and a 12 GB hdd.

Cheers,   Rick McQueen-Thomson

&gt;
&gt; Hi There!
&gt;
&gt; I'm attempting to get X to behave itself on a Toshiba Tecra 8100 and it
&gt; simply refuses to. The machine comes with an S3 Savage XGA video card
&gt; and I either get:
&gt;
&gt; * 800x600, 16bpp (full screen)
&gt;  - run under X-3.3.6
&gt;
&gt; * 800x600, 16bpp (not a full screen)
&gt;  - run under X-4.0.1
&gt;
&gt; 1024x768 refuses to work. I can't convince X-4.0.2 to compile (I got a
&gt; source version). Has anyone had any luck with these machines? Linux
&gt; works charmingly on it; the machine has 196Mb RAM, a 20Gb HDD and it's a
&gt; 733 PIII and Windows runs it perfectly.
&gt;
&gt; Also, I can't get the PCMCIA Xircom modem card to work. It comes up with
&gt; "Cardbus: Can't allocate high memory" or some such error. I've hacked a
&gt; few things in from the Internet but they were already in the default
&gt; configuration....
