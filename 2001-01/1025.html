&gt; The errors for the RX packets seem rather high to me.  Anyone care to
&gt; comment?  Offer some advice?

RX errors come commonly from buffer overflow problems. Method of fixup
depends on kind of hardware you're using (sometimes you simpy cannot do
something). If you have external modem you must set speed on link from modem
to UART higher than your connection speed. If your UART allows try to change
FIFO buffers size. Also give priority to UART IRQ - by default it's very
low.

Also in rare cases RX errors can come from incomatibility of your modem with
modem of your ISP so line noise can break some of frames.

&gt; Is the MTU too high?  My understanding is that 1500 is a nice figure for
&gt; Ethernet but for a dialup connection,  a value around 400 (ish) is more
&gt; suitable.
&gt; My download link speed sits on or about 50666, the upload link starts at
&gt; 31200 and drops to about 24000 after about a day.
&gt; I am greedy and want it to stay at 31200 all the time (a co-worker can
&gt; achieve this).

Lowering of MTU will help to get more speed because if you have received
1500 bytes packet and one byte was incorrect (missed) another side will
resend this packet again. In case with lower MTU you resend packets will be
smaller (ie they will consume less bandwith). But in same time you will get
more packet headers which need bandwidth too (40 bytes for each packet). So
judge for yourself.
