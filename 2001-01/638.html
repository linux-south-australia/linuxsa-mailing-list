&gt; &gt; Particularly word processors with spell checkers. The spell
&gt; checker was one
&gt; &gt; of the worst things to happen to writing.
&gt;
&gt; Research seems to indicate the opposite.  Authors of a 1999 paper

well, I speak from Empirical and anecdotal evidence, so I win.


&gt; supposed
&gt; this was because spell checkers removed the sanction of teachers that
&gt; occurs when K-6 students explore the language.  Others claim that the
&gt; study
&gt; is skewed as computers only available to rich schools, therefore results
&gt; skewed towards homes more likely to read to their children.
&gt;
&gt; Note that last point.  Reading to your children is still the most
&gt; effective single strategy for teaching K-6 literacy.  Schools have less
&gt; to do with it than parents, something that I wish John Laws would
&gt; understand.

John Laws... John Laws... Valvoline ads... know what I mean? -- that's the
extent of my familiarity with the man :)


&gt;
&gt; I don't know of any research into the effects of word processing
&gt; on 7-12 literacy.  This isn't too surprising.  It's only been the
&gt; last few years when computers have become ubiquitous enough for
&gt; such a study not to be skewed by local factors.  We might need
&gt; to wait a few years yet for firm results.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Schools should focus on giving students the skills (for want of
&gt; &gt; a better word) that they will need for life -- thinking, reasoning,
&gt; &gt; expressing, understanding, learning, inventing.
&gt;
&gt; Schools would argue that using word processing is done precisely to
&gt; improve written expression.
&gt;
&gt; You should not also ignore the look of the finished product.  Children
&gt; are excited about seeing their work printed looking like a book.  And
&gt; motivating students is one of the best tactics for letting them learn.

hmmm ... maybe...

&gt;
&gt; There is a huge amount of work that goes into developing a curriculum.
&gt; There's very little class time that doesn't address wider goals than the
&gt; immediate task at hand.  As you wrote, computing isn't an end in itself.
&gt;
&gt; My concern is that the huge amount of work in curriculum development
&gt; does allow for vendor lockin of the entire education process.  For
&gt; example, a vendor could present curriculum and teaching materials that
&gt; refer exclusively to its products.  And this concern isn't only
&gt; limited to Microsoft, but extends to McDonalds and some other
&gt; companies.  It is very difficult for schools to refuse these offers,
&gt; and perhaps they should not if the school goes in with its eyes open.

so we're all voting labour and/or democrat next election in hope of
increasing education funding so that schools can afford not to be bought
out... :)

&lt; please don't anyone respond to that, it was a throw-away comment... :) &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I need to point out here that these are my views, and not those
&gt; of my employer (who works at the nexus of computers, networks,
&gt; education and research).

mmm
