&gt;I am interested in why you think RH7.0 is a crock.  Would you care to go 
&gt;into more detail?

1. Historical. RH X.0 has always had problems, and that includes 4.0, 5.0
   and 6.0.

2. Experience. I have installed or upgraded several machines with 7.0, and 
   have had some major problems, esp with:

   a- The GCC version they ship

   b- The 2.2.16 kernel source RPM would not compile at all even with egcs.
      I had to upgrade to 2.2.18 ...

   c- Which meant that I could not get VMware to work at all until I upgraded

   d- Prior to upgrading the kernel, modules would not compile.

   e- DOCBOOK still seems broken, although DL may be overzealous in upgrading
      things.

However, the interface is slick, umm, that is, the shell, which has always
been slick :-) The GUI is kinda nice as well, but I am only a user.

&gt;&gt;My first suggestion is, don't use RH7.0. It is a crock. Use RH 6.2 and wait
&gt;&gt;for RH 7.1.
&gt;
