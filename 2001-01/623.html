&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Not that I'm saying that programming should be the goal of
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; K-12 computing, I think understanding should be.  But
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; understanding thye method and limitations of programming
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is part of understanding computing.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; i believe some basic introductory programming would benifit those planning to go
&gt; &gt;&gt; onto a uni computer course, perhaps in C or another easier to use language.
&gt; &gt;&gt; which brings the point, that many computer teachers would have no idea, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; would need retraining.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; a while ago there was a plan to get MCSE into high schools, perhaps the
&gt; &gt;&gt; governments current plans are leading to this? Would it be hard to get in first,
&gt; &gt;&gt; even if only a few schools, with the RHCE instead?? pity it costs $2500.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Without this understanding of programming, we end up with
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a society that is too easily taken in by schemes for
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; electronic voting or missile defence systems.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are we talking about computing here or the use of computers in
&gt; &gt; schools?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.

Obviously not that used to the commonly used english or contruct. Too much
time spent building your relationship with computers.
:-)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If we are specifically talking about computing, i.e. basic computer
&gt; &gt; science, then sure open source will be fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But if you are talking about the ordinary every day use of computers in
&gt; &gt; schools ( at least in junior primary and primary schools), the usage is
&gt; &gt; not much different to business.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not so much concerned about what their intention is.  I'm thinking
&gt; more about what should be happening.  By training a generation of
&gt; Microsoft operators, we're condemning them to being second-best to
&gt; people in other countries--see Richard's comments.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I.e. they use PCs to do other work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The PC and associated applications are not the topic themselves,
&gt; &gt; they are simply tools, like pencils and books.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At least this is how it is in the school where my mum is k-7 librarian and
&gt; &gt; at the schools of her schoolteacher friends.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Under this scenario it is very difficult to see open source being
&gt; &gt; particularly useful.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Especially if you think that they might also want to prepare kids for what
&gt; &gt; they will find in the real world one day. These days what most people find
&gt; &gt; on real world PCs is word/excel/windows.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that in 10 years time better things will be generally
&gt; available.  They should be training the kids for the future, not the
&gt; present.

It is sort of hard to teach somethign that has not been written/invented,
and perhaps not even imagined yet.

&gt; &gt; Not only that most teachers know word/excel/windows and have enough
&gt; &gt; trouble using it, let alone learning/using another tos, particularly when
&gt; &gt; they have little interest in doing so, and probably even if they were
&gt; &gt; interested it would take them several years to get to a usable level.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The training supplied by the dept is dismal to non existent.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, but we don't have to accept that as a given.


No but it is likely to remain the case for the indefinate future.
And to remain so with the current crop of teachers probably including
those very recently graduated.

I have actually in the last 4 years done some tertiary level course aimed
at computing for education students (easy points for non major topics).

These courses basically were word processing with word at a very basic
level (tabs for the start ofa pragraph, italics bold and differnet font
faces/sizes) and excel(mainly as a database) on windows for workgroups
platform.

I have no reason to believe this is not representitive for most education 
students.

They actually teach the same things to a slightly mroe advacned it IT1,
albeit on a more up to date windows platform.

If we want to make an impact this is where it would seem to me to be most
profitable, on the next crop of teachers.

Try getting open source into the unis(by the way I have actually tried to
do this to some extent, with no success whilst I was at uni).

If you really want to get open source into schools, I think that you need
to get open soure into businesses and into the minds of the next and next
after taht generationof teachers who will after all be the next
generation of policy makers.


&gt; &gt; So while it is possible
that they might use star office for their needs,
&gt; &gt; it is highly unlikely that it would actually happen.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see any advantage in replacing Microsoft Office with Star
&gt; Office.  I'm talking about the individual's relationship with
&gt; computers.

But schools aren't trying ot build up realtionships between student and 
PC.
The PC is simply a tool. Like a pnecil or a book.

Schools are simply trying to teach kids to work with the ost modern
equipment/sofftware they can afford, and as far as i can determine the
software that kids are most liekly to see in otehr environments, eg home
and businesses.

&gt; &gt; What would be more likely is that the PCs wouldn't get used as much.
&gt; &gt; (there are still some classrooms where the PC is never turned on -
&gt; &gt; this would likely increase if you took away the OS/apps which they
&gt; &gt; have spent lots of time getting to some level of familiarity with
&gt; &gt; and told them to start again).
&gt; 
&gt; Not if they required it to fulfil the curriculum.

Theoretically they are I beleive required to fulfil the curriculum now.
It just means that the curriculum doesnt get fulfilled.
In any case at k-7 level the judgement of whtehr trhe curriculum is being
fulfilled is largely fdoen byt he teacher, in most cases.
About 3 years ago I did a terms work doing PC/Mac support at one of
adelaide private schools, where every kid frompirmary to year 10 (byt now
it will be every kid to yr 12- not sure about junior primary) had a
laptop.

In that envrionment I think it is fair to say that being computer literate
and probably interested in computing is very helpful if you wnat ot meet
curriciulum goals.

Guess what - 50%(in my estimation, based on my expereicnes with them and
tehir attituds and comments) or so of teachers just were not interested,
and only used their laptops because they were forced into it.

This was an environment where each of them and each of the kids in their
classes had a computer.

A big advance right now would not be getting teachers to use open source,
it would simply be to get all teachers using PCs at all.

My mum is her schools IT "expert". This scares me, and at times makes me
laugh.

She can barely copy a file from one PC to another.

But every thing she can do she has been taught privately or taught
herself.

I am not kidding when I say at the last two schools she has been at she is
the very best they have. She is thte one who organises teh trisp to
"school of the future" she is the one who gets teh kids scannign images
into their projects, she is the one who takes the kids from the teachers
who _flat_out_refuse_to_teach_with_comptuers_, so those kids get a go too.

And judging from her teacher friends (all k-7 I believe) this is about the
best you can expect.

And from their conversations, most of their peers are simply not
interested.

I reiterate. In my opinion it would be a good step just to get all
teachers using PCs at this stage, let alone getting them using
"idealogically" correct software.

&gt; &gt; Remember a lot of teachers don't want to do PC support and don't want to
&gt; &gt; do PC training (I don't mean don't want to be trained, I mean don't want to be
&gt; &gt; PC trainers). They are not trained, equipped or interested in doing so.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some do  and I applaud that.
&gt; &gt; Some do under the most adverse environments, e.g. no support from
&gt; &gt; principals little peer support and few funds, policy made by schools
&gt; &gt; councils who have no understanding of IT/computers, completely self
&gt; &gt; taught, largely in their own time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Taking away that investment in time and skills(no matter how pitiful
&gt; &gt; these skills are) would be extremely demoralising and quite possibly
&gt; &gt; would set computer usage in schools back a few years or more.
&gt; 
&gt; So we don't take away that investment, we build on it (possibly
&gt; propping up a rickety structure in the process).

There are probably hundreds of thousands of person hours invested in what
teachers currenlty know about lets be specific curenlty that is mainly MS
products.

Given 1 training day or so a term, how long do you think it would take
them to get proficient on what is arguably much harder to learn software
concepts?


&gt; &gt; Especially given there is no real practical reason to do so, in the
&gt; &gt; majority of cases.
&gt; &gt; As I say if you are specially teaching "computing" is computer science/IT
&gt; &gt; principals, then sure open source would be extremely useful, possibly
&gt; &gt; indispensable once you have it and appropriately skilled teachers in
&gt; &gt; place.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly.  Obviously the level of skills would be commensurate with the
&gt; fact that it's a high school and not a university, but I don't see why
&gt; kids shouldn't learn basic programming skills in school.

Actually we were talking about k-12 which is largely not high school. 

But it is sort of hard to teach programming to a 5 year old.
Not impossible, but hard. Particularly with vi and gcc.
Not enough grasp of abstract concepts.
Not enough abulity to abstract.
Probably haven't learnt to write words of 5 character yet.

At this age group I really cant see current open source tools being of
much use. Too much work for too little reward.

High school computing classes(ie computer science like concepts)
definately.

Older kids certainly - but not that many of them. 

But the majority of k-12 desktop PCs, I just cant see it.


&gt; &gt; But for non "computing"  every day  desktop use I cant really see open
&gt; &gt; source software being all that useful.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is more here at stake than good philosophy.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed.
