&gt; You mean it would require so much R&D to write a programme to monitor a
&gt; network interface and provide a few statistics that it can't possibly be
&gt; open-sourced and released to the public domain?  The entire Linux
&gt; distribution I'm using is "a free lunch."  All I want is a bit of salt
with
&gt; my chips!

You think so?! How much days and night you have spent to learn Linux? So
IMHO you've paid for using of Linux...

&gt; I don't think it's _easy_.  Writing and developing a linux distribution
&gt; isn't easy - but it is a useful tool, and it's free.  A decent PPP monitor
&gt; sounds to me like a useful tool.  I just thought that MAYBE there might be
&gt; one for free.

I saw utilites which can give you information which you need and it was free
but they calculating only traffic passed through your ppp* interfaces and
how long they were up and no user names. If I will remember where then I'll
send you URL.
