Dear Richard,

To respond to your criticism (below), I would like to explain why we 
haven't yet launched xDSL formally in Adelaide.

Since people on the linuxsa list tend to enjoy details, I'll supply them.

The core reason is that we are absolutely insisting that we _do_ get 
it right before we open the doors. Yes, we've had to revise our 
intended launch date by four weeks as a result.

The reasons why its taking some time are manyfold, and I'm going to 
lay them out here. They include resolution of our internal 
provisioning procedures - and some technical issues - to ensure that 
when we open the door, we can, and will, service our customers 
professionally and promptly.

The service works fine technically, at a low level. At a high level, 
we're working to resolve a few issues which Telstra has imposed upon 
us to limitations inherent in the technical choices that they have 
made in providing us with infrastructure access to deliver the 
service.

Those technical limitations include some which make it impossible for 
Telstra, at present, to offer ADSL as a business focussed and/or high 
quality home service, including providing static IP addressing and 
other features that we know our professional customers will expect. 
We've nailed effective ways to provide those things despite the 
limitations in the underlying service because we know our customers 
want them.

To resolve those issues, we have been developing our product around 
the use of Cisco DSL customer premises equipment, instead of the 
cheap and cheerful Alcatel boxes that Telstra pitches to their own 
customers at present - and which are part of the problem.

Unfortunately, yet again, Cisco haven't yet done what we need either 
- there is a specific IOS feature change we need in order to deliver 
the flexible and effective service we want to deliver, making it both 
easier to use and more powerful than the options pitched to the 
market by Telstra.

I have been in weekly phone and email discussion with Cisco engineers 
both in Sydney and in San Jose working on getting this issue 
resolved, and the delays in doing so are the other major barrier to 
our being comfortable in launching the service right now. I expect 
that to be resolved Real Soon Now, as I've (just) found a workaround 
that will get things moving in the meantime.

To make it worse, to date, mysterious delays within Telstra mean that 
Cisco have been unable to have their equipment certified to connect 
to Telstra phone lines, despite _significant_ effort on their part to 
push Telstra along to get this done. This is one of those 'any day 
now' issues, that was anticipated to be resolved in two weeks, about 
two months ago.  It was supposed to be 'definitely' resolved by today 
- and it isn't. Mysteriously, Cisco just don't seem to be making it 
to the top of the testing list. Strange, isn't it. The issue isn't 
technical, I am 100.0% sure of that.

In summary: While I am sure you didn't mean to imply incompetence on 
our part in your comments, below, by saying we 'can't get it right', 
I wanted to underscore for your benefit and that of others that it 
is, absolutely, our drive to deliver a competent, supportable, and 
effective service.

To do that, we have insisted that this service is an example of a new 
drive inside our organisation to make sure that when you ask us to 
pick up a ball, we don't drop it again.

In other words, my own quality focus is the issue, because I know 
that if I don't insist on our organisation delivering a quality 
solution in this realm, we might as well not bother at all. We have a 
great technical reputation, and I'm insisting that ADSL is something 
that underscores, rather than damages, this reputation!

We are hugely, hugely aware of how important it is to get this out of 
the door rapidly, and we're working on it as hard as we can, 
commensurate with the roadblocks I've noted above (compounded with 
the major one - that Telstra held back the access we needed to the 
network itself until the day of the launch of their retail service, 
which meant we've had to start from behind and run like the devil - 
and that's exactly what we're doing)

So to paraphrase your comment - we insist on not (knowingly) getting it wrong!

I'm sure you'd be less than impressed if we promised you a service 
and it didn't work properly on arrival, and you'd be telling the 
linuxsa list all about _that_ as well.

Be assured that I'm less than happy about the delay, too - and 
acutely aware that we're letting people down in having to wait a bit 
longer before we can open the doors.

I ask for your patience, and for your continued (and appreciated) 
support of a local company doing great things in the face of the 
mediocrity of the Telstra offerings in general, and in this space in 
particular. I believe you'll be impressed with the results.

The actual low level service stability during our test deployments 
has been excellent - I'm sending this via an Agile ADSL service now, 
in fact.  So we expect the outcome to be very good indeed, Real Soon 
Now.

I am asking you to be patient, and I know that isn't a happy thing to 
ask.  But I'm asking it anyway. Please wait.

Cheers,
Simon Hackett

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of any aDSL suppliers apart from Telstra who are actually
&gt;deliving?
&gt;
&gt;After waiting ages for Internode/Agile, I rang them today on the day they
&gt;promised they would be able to announce product, only to find that they
&gt;have delayed for another month :-(
&gt;
&gt;Seems they can't quite get it right :-(
