Its a fair question.

We happen to run a machine at above.net in San Jose, CA (ns1.on.net).

The reason we do that is mainly to provide a DNS server on the other 
side of the planet; The difference relative to another ISP 'close by' 
is that if you loose complete US&lt;-&gt;Australian connectivity (some of 
us are old enough to remember that this sometimes does happen :) ), 
then entities trying to resolve your domain names from elsewhere in 
the planet (outside of Australia) will still be able to do so.

Why does _that_ matter? Because (for instance) the failure mode for 
an smtp sender if a domain name is unresolvable is to present your 
domain name as nonexistent - not unreachable, but actually absent 
from the world - resulting in a mail bounce that you'd rather not 
have happening. Since it's not just us, but it's a _lot_ of customer 
domains we're protecting in this manner as well, the 'per customer' 
overhead of doing this becomes an acceptable aspect of overall 
running costs.

It's ok if your domain names resolve but your own site is unreachable 
- mail senders will retry in this circumstance, but not necessarily 
if the name is unresolvable because all of your dns servers are down.

[as I write the above, I find myself wondering whether it's actually 
still true, however - I believe it used to be, but maybe this has 
changed these days, as smtp senders are still undergoing some forms 
of evolution over time... any other points of view?]

We've also found a secondary but very helpful reason to have a host 
we control in the USA - it lets us run network tracing tools and 
uptime measurements of our network *from the perspective of 
California*, which has been utterly invaluable to us in diagnosing 
all sorts of obscure network faults that every one of our upstreams 
have subjected us to at various times - some of these are the results 
of various forms of pathological asymmetric routing situations that 
are much simpler to understand when you can approach the 'pipe' from 
both ends.

&gt;A question from someone who doesn't know much about this kind of thing...
&gt;
&gt;Why would an ISP (particularly a small one) want a secondary mail/DNS server
&gt;on the other side of the world? I understand the need for redundancy, etc.,
&gt;but would have thought that another ISP close by, or perhaps in another city
&gt;or even state, would be plenty good enough. You'd want to be sure that they
&gt;didn't share the same points of failure in their network connectivity, but I
&gt;would have thought that you could do this without going to the other side of
&gt;the world. I mean, if all routes to your server and to your secondary server
&gt;in another city are down, then I would have thought that it's too far gone
&gt;to worry about having a backup here... Assumedly, if the DNS is
&gt;innaccessible, then the servers it points to are mostly innaccessible too,
&gt;and if the mail server is down, then having a backup here won't help,
&gt;because clients wouldn't be able to get to it until the link returned
&gt;anyway... and if all the links are down, then the country's probably been
&gt;bombed or something, and there are more important things to worry about...
&gt;Am I completely wrong here?
&gt;
&gt;rr
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; I operate a small Internet presence firm in Connecticut, US. I'm
&gt;  &gt; looking for an ISP in Australia that would be interested in colocating
&gt;  &gt; one of our secondary name and mail servers (running linux, of course)
&gt;  &gt; in return for us colocating one of their server here.
