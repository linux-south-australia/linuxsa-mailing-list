When I think back to the scene in 'The Life of Brian", I remember the 
street full of worshipers, neatly divided into two groups subscribing to 
the 'holy gourd' and the 'holy sandal'.  Yet both worshipped the same 
messiah.

I think that Linux is an International Consortium right now, its not 
that noticable, but through our combined efforts in contributions and 
testing, we are making a standard work and work well.  Surely we are not 
about to subscribe to partisan factions over such an issue, even if an 
'International' consortium were to evolve the Linux core, I think you 
would find we would still have the kernel and other Open Source  items 
at our fingertips.

Surely the major players must realise the value of our support and 
ability to provide such quick testing, correction and patch releases for 
a problem when it arises.  This itself gives the major players an edge 
not before seen.  Their need for an alternative platform may also 
release more material back to the Open Community the likes of which we 
have never seen.

I think we are the consortium and other players, money and all, still 
require the experience and advise of the Open Source community.

&gt; 
&gt; Here's a sample paragraph:
&gt; 
&gt; =============================================
&gt; What's more, industry titans such as IBM
&gt; Corp. (stock: IBM); Compaq Computer Corp.
&gt; (stock: CPQ); Intel Corp. (stock: INTC);
&gt; Hewlett-Packard Corp. (stock: HWP); and
&gt; Oracle Corp. (stock: ORCL) are pouring
&gt; billions of dollars into developing Linux
&gt; products and want to exert more influence on
&gt; the direction of the kernel, based on
&gt; customer feedback. 
&gt; =============================================
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to suggest that linux could one day go down the
&gt; same sort of path as the X Window Consortium or
&gt; the Internet Engineering Task Force.
&gt; I.e. In my opinion, linux could become some sort
&gt; of open standard watched over by an itnernational
&gt; standards body.
&gt; 
&gt; Does nyone agree with me?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
