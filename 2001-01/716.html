Id like to know how to script gimp.

Ideally not using scheme.(sionce I dont know scheme )

I'll be honest I have never tried this or properly read the docs.
But I beleive it is possible forma quick skim of the docs.

Scritping image manipulation would be really handy at times.

&gt; Hello everybody.
&gt; I'm going to be giving a talk for the March meeting, and consequently need to submit a synopsis of some description to Geoffrey about it. I don't want to rabbit on and lose people with my whirlwind of knowledge ;) so I'm going to ask you want you would like me to focus on.
&gt; The talk/discussion will be about the wonders of the GIMP and how it will change your life. I have a funny suspicion that there are not too many GIMP using or otherwise, graphic designers attending the LinuxSA meetings.
&gt; I guess I really need to know what it is that the majority of you would like to learn about the GIMP, or even graphic applications in general.
&gt; I could take the "tools and what are they are" approach, the "how to manufacture funky backgrounds and icons", the ever popular "web graphics and you" action, or one of the many other 'kewl' topics that people can come up with.
&gt; Basically, I want this talk to be of benefit to the majority of you, so let me know what it is you want to do - if anything at all...
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, if you do reply, make sure you'll be attending the meeting too :)
