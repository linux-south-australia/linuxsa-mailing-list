I know this has been announced here earlier today, but I wanted to share
the amusing way the announcement is put. I am sure any project managers
of large mission critical projects can relate to the self-proclaimed
mush-for-brains title. Anyhoo, rejoicing time.



Linus announces 2.4

From: Linus Torvalds <A HREF="mailto:torvalds@transmeta.com">torvalds@transmeta.com</A>
To: Kernel Mailing List <A HREF="mailto:linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org">linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org</A>
Subject: And oh, btw..

In a move unanimously hailed by the trade press and industry analysts as
being a sure sign of incipient braindamage, Linus Torvalds (also known
as the "father of Linux" or, more commonly, as "mush-for-brains")
decided that enough is enough, and that things don't get better from
having the     same people test it over and over again. In short, 2.4.0
is out there.

Anxiously awaited for the last too many months, 2.4.0 brings to the
table many improvements, none of which come to mind to the exhausted
release manager right now. "It's better", was the only printable quote.
Pressed for details, Linus bared his teeth and hissed at reporters, most
of which
suddenly remembered that they'd rather cover "Home and Gardening" than
the IT industry anyway.

Anyway, have fun. And don't bother reporting any bugs for the next few
days. I won't care anyway.

Linus
