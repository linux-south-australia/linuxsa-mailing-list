Richard!

&gt; We should also ask for a speaker from Labour and the Democrats ...

That is a good point but I was attempting to avoid this particular
meeting becoming a political discussion point, hence I chose to invite
the Hon. Dr. Armitage in his capacity of Minister of the Crown, not
member of the Liberal party.

&gt; This would have the effect of raising the profile of LinuxSA in South
&gt; Australia so that politicians understand that we are interested in what is
&gt; happening, and that we vote and that we care.

On the other hand, what you have suggested is also an excellent idea;
for once I can equally support both ideas but will say that getting a
spokesman for all three parties at the same meeting, on a set date could
be a timetabling nightmare. However, the wonderful thing about not
having a committee is that once a decision to do something is made we
can duck for cover and stare aimlessly in Geoffrey's general direction
;-P

Mind you, I'd be willing to attempt to coordinate something if that's
what people wanted.

&gt; We will also have to ensure that the meeting is well attended!

Yes.
