&gt; Its a pity Oz doesn't have freedom of speach in our constitution, or the
&gt; first amendment !

One of the things I learnt in Australian History when I studied it was
that consitutions like that of France and the US (which was modelled to
some extent the French) explicitly give you a list of rights and
everything else is potentially forbidden. Allegedly the .au constitution
(which also draws on the French and US constitutions) tries to do things
in the opposite way: list what you can't do and everything else is
potentially a basic right.

I don't know that I really think things work that way in practice, but
I've always wanted to ask an expert if the constitution is in fact
designed like this.
