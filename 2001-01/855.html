&gt;Sure John, I should have told Dingoblue I did not need their poor business
&gt;model, I did not need their low cost or unlimited time or downloads.
Please
&gt;get a grip on reality, your points are fine, but cost, if you read my
previous
&gt;mail, was NOT the primary reason for picking Dingoblue.  I stated that I
would
&gt;be happy to pay more for such service. Don't you understand... I dont think
&gt;about what I D/L or how long I stay on for, that in itself is worth the
money.
&gt;And while I'm on it, Internode's business strategy and others who still
limit
&gt;hours or apply D/L charges are the ones who should be reviewing their
business
&gt;models.  The Internet is and will be permanent part of our work and play
&gt;habits.  Limits of any kind are a model for disaster.

I would agree with the converse, limits are required to avoid disaster.

There is only one ISP in the country I know of that actually makes money
from offering a truly unlimited service (and FYI, the former operations
manager there is now on Internode's staff). Providers like Onetel and Primus
with such plans are doing so to gain market share in the hope that they can
work on turning a profit later on. That makes for great deals for end users,
but in the end the same users are going to lose out. To provide a truly
unlimited account for modem dialups would cost something in the realm of
$400 per month with today's bandwidth prices. Anyone offering unlimited
time+downloads for less is cutting corners somewhere (reduced service) or
hoping that some customers use it less than others. In the latter scenario,
any time you're not using the account flat-out, you're subsidising someone
else's usage, why should you pay for more than you need?

The obligatory debate analogy (usually works best after someone compares
unlimited Internet to a smorgasbord): Unlimited time+download Internet is
like a Pizza shop that sells all-you-can-eat home delivered pizzas for a
fixed low price. Show me a business working with that model, and you have a
basis for the unlimited utopia you feel everyone needs.

Without a limit, a handful of customers can hog a lot of bandwidth or lines
and ruin the service for everyone. You've been spared from this with the
dingo blue experience, because they've had enough resources to throw at the
situation to avoid that.

For some case studies, Telstra's switch to unlimited downloads on cable used
up their entire international bandwidth, so they had to put in limits to
keep their entire Internet Service useable. Optus introduced no limits on
their service, and were forced to enact a limiting system a short time
afterwards.

There's also an precipitating effect where users who lust for unlimited
amounts of downloading migrate towards providers offering unlimited
downloads. Ordinary users who aren't affected by limits stay happily where
they are, or, move ISP's because the "unlimited downloads" service starts to
slow down due to too many "unlimited downloaders". The sad thing is that for
every unlimited ISP that collapses, two more rise in it's place, with the
new owners convinced it will work because other people must be making money
out of it.. so the free ride for the unlimited downloader continues. ISP's
concerned with providing good service don't want these customers, so they
don't provide pricing plans that will attract them.

With some limits, Adam Internet (my employer) offers near-unlimited time
accounts for $16 per month, with nice fast service, that saw some people
hold calls of up to 2 weeks long over the holiday period. At that sort of
price, it can be a part of a lot more people's work and play habits, but it
can't happen without limits.

&gt;Simon H. once said to me, the business models for ISP's must be value
adding
&gt;and include complementary services. I hope he hasn't changed his mind on
this
&gt;as he was quite correct.  The ISP business model of just dial-up services
is no
&gt;longer valid.

Doomsayers have been making comments like that since 1994, and there are
plenty of ISP's that have been making money from Dialup services since then.
Dialup services are going to be most popular way to access the Internet
until at least 2005. While some users will treat ISP's like petrol stations
and hunt for the best price, others will establish a relationship with their
provider that will help them to make the most of the Internet. Value-adding
is one way of making more money in a saturated market, but a common element
amongst nearly all successfull ISP's is the notion of "core business".
Trying to value-add too much loses the focus, and results in poor quality of
service.
