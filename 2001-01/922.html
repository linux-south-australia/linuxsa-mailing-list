&gt;Actually, Dingoblue is good, I left internode, because of the limit 
&gt;on hours and
&gt;small web-page space limits and the cost of maintaining the domain name with
&gt;them. Overall I found them to be un-competitive, however, I had and still have
&gt;nothing but praise for their service and speed. I will certainly 
&gt;look carefully
&gt;at their DSL offerings when it arrives, but based on previous 
&gt;experience I'm not
&gt;sure if they will be equal to other providers on cost.

Here's the intended launch costs. Comments most sincerely welcome:

All costs *include* GST:

Install: $259

Monthly:	$89/Mo		256k download/64k upload speeds
	OR	$129/Mo		1500k download/256k upload speeds

Includes:
		500 Mb/Month download and (probably $0.16/Mb thereafter)

- Static IP addressing available

- Servers at your end are fine

- Connection to an office via L2TP rather than a plain Internet link is fine
(However the DSL router cost for the router needed will add to the 
install fee in this case, I'm still wrestling with finding the best 
value for money 'high end' DSL customer end box for this option)

If you compare this to the Telstra plans (excepting the residential 
only 'unlimited' ones) this comes in just a touch below the 'without 
preselection' price points from Telstra. We encourage you to 
preselect someone else instead and enjoy better phone rates as a 
result (and as an offset to the pricing difference offered by Telstra 
for remaining 'loyal' to them).

Our 'per MB' fees are lower than the Telstra ones. The Telstra 
residential all-you-can-eat is limited by their acceptable usage 
policy, and the limitations are so severe that almost all linux based 
connections would break that AUP. Sure, you can sign up anyway and 
lie to them, but I do actually think they'll wind up 'popping' you 
because they'll need to avoid being ripped dead by people exploiting 
that price plan.

We can not, and do not, intend to follow them down that sinkhole, and 
besides, no option for a static IP address is no fun, eh?

Due to limitations (explained at length in a posting some days back) 
in the way Telstra let us 'at' their copper right now, we are 
breaking even at the numbers above - barely - against our true costs 
to deliver ADSL.

What we need, and want, is a lot of customers, to give us leverage 
with Telstra, so we can force down our wholesale access prices and 
then be able to drive down the retail numbers as well.

Your support would be sincerely appreciated, as would your comments 
on the above price points, and suggestions on what else we could 
offer that would be of use to you in an ADSL service.

Having run a DSL line at my home for the last 8 weeks during our 
shakedown trials, I have to say that as a home connection mechanism, 
DSL rocks.

Pity about the availability gaps - but this is actually improving in 
Adelaide quite fast (Norwood got enabled today, for instance, and we 
have the schedule in our hands for most of the rest of Adelaide)

We can plug a lot of the gaps with our radio-based Agile broadband 
system - but that won't be able to compete with DSL on price until 
we've finished reworking our radio CPE equipment (again!) to reduce 
its deployment price - but stay tuned on that front.

&gt;[...]

&gt;So Simon, want to give us some PR on why we should use Agile rather than an
&gt;alternative?

Thanks for the query ("I'm glad you asked!") - and I think I've more 
than answered that in my previous posting :)

Cheers,
  Simon
