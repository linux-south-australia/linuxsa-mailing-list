&gt; James!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; have worked in web design places, but i really want to be a
&gt; &gt; sysadmin which needs a piece of paper!!i believe i have as much
&gt; &gt; skill and experience as many of you do (perhaps not the sysadmin
&gt; &gt; types, of course), but only having that certificate under your
&gt; &gt; arm proves that.
&gt;
&gt; Oh? I work in system administration and I bluntly offered my services to
&gt; someone who seemed to remember me about six to eight months' later when
&gt; he needed someone to assist him in one of his bigger contracts...

I strongly agree with David's advice.  And I can vouch for what happens when
you think you have to have the piece of paper.

Back around 1980, I was a teenager playing around with TRS-80's and assembly
programming.  My friends and I wrote some programs that interested an
investor, and next thing we knew we were writing cutting-edge software for
new PC competitors.  We didn't realize that this was unusual for our age.
When I turned 18, educators and family convinced me that I had to go and get
the "piece of paper", so I took some time off from hacking and went to
college.  This slowed down the learning process considerably, and the next
thing I knew the marketplace passed me by, and these days I'm just a techie.

Meanwhile, not long before then, Bill Gates had dropped out of college and
started his own company.  And to think we used to chuckle over the sloppy
junk that IBM and Microsoft pushed out on the market...  (Actually, we still
chuckle over the Microsoft products...)

You shouldn't necessarily blow off formal education - pursued properly, it
can help you to succeed.  Just don't underestimate the value of what you can
learn on your own.  Don't think for a minute that you HAVE to have a piece
of paper to succeed.  Just apply yourself to whatever it is you enjoy doing,
and do it the best that you can.  If formal education helps, great!  But if
you stop to measure your success by "papers", money or fame, you'll fall far
short of your potential.

There's more than a few people I know that wish they would've believed this
when they were your age.
