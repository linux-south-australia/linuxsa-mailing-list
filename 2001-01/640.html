Whic schools are you talking about? As far as I know, we pay around $112
per Pentium-class or greater machine each year. This covers a small list
of Microsoft's desktop software. Even if we don't run Windows on a
machine, we are still supposed to pay this "tax" on it. I'd hardly say
that that is free.

&gt; So the tco is not likely to be lower, I would suggest probably higher due
&gt; to higher support costs.

Most of the support we have to offer is not on how to use software, but
more on fixing things that are broke. If we were using any multi-user
operating system on the desktops, we could cut down our support by a
significant amount, as we could implement effective security.

&gt; In addition it is quite possible that a kid who uses workd 98 this year
&gt; will use word 2o00 nexct year.

... And will need to learn all of the differences between the two
versions. Staff also need to be re-trained (not just in how to use it,
but being confident enough to be able to teach it).

&gt; &gt; I sometimes wonder if the Independent Schools Association might not be a
&gt; &gt; better target?

Better, yes. The Catholic Education Office might also be worth a look.
The biggest problem that I have found is the 3rd party applications
which *must* be run by all schools. Funnily enough the vendors of these
products aren't interested in porting their apps, as they already have
guaranteed income. People like SSABSA inflict software upon schools
which the school *must* run, but they are so proprietry that they don't
(at the moment) run under wine.

&gt; Possibly they might not be covered under he all encompassing agreement
&gt; that I believe are in place with state schools.

If you are talking about the Microsoft / Schools License agreement, it's
not optional for SA state schools, but is for others.

&gt; I also dont think that anything much will happen over the next few years,
&gt; possibly decade.

This is where you are wrong. There are a number of people who are really
looknig around for an 'edge' over other schools, or just something that
works. We will see Linux used for teaching in schools over the next
couple of years. It will be slow, but it has started. We're hoping to be
using a few older machines to teach Networking to the Certificate III
students (yr 11 / 12). They won't be running Windows.

Hope it helps,
Matt
