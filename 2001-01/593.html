&gt; &gt; Very much so agreed. what can we do to stop this? i beleive that the
&gt; &gt; only way is to get Linux into primary schools how ever that will become
&gt; &gt; hard now, because you would believe that it would be mandatory for
&gt; &gt; schools to have m$ based computers...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Rsises point...  too hard for kids? ther is a debian project for kids
&gt; &gt; that could be used...
&gt; 
&gt; Don't think this is the issue - at least it would be readily overcome if
&gt; it were.

[no direct relevance to above quotes]

What are they going to use instead?  I have no doubt that the education
department .. or decs .. or whatever they are now .. would have minimal
issues with going with another system or set of packages - I'm fairly
confident that there's no big MS conspiracy happening, and I'm also fairly
confident that there's now enough FUD-type stuff regarding MS that the top
dogs would be ready to listen.

I'm sure we, as the hive-mind that we are, could come up with viable
alternatives to MS stuff.  This is Australia - the little guys can still
get their words in, if they're put forward well enough.

It's really really really hot and humid here in Broken Hill at the moment,
so forgive me if I'm making redundant comments.  :)

Nick, who's dreaming of beaches.
