G'day,

Looking for some suggestions on how to diagnose a known flaky disk 
but which currently refuses to fail...

About six months ago, a hard disk started making very worrying 
klunking noises, followed by the very obvious noise of 
the spindle motor ramping up after having been stopped.  Sounded 
very much like a head crash, except that only one or two spots 
on the disk seemed to be affected... the rest of the disk works 
fine.  

I've just discovered that the failed drive is still under 
warranty, and so would like to return it for replacement.  

Trouble is, now I can't make it fail.  

Presumably some intelligence on the drive has mapped out 
the bad sectors, and so diagnostics, including those 
provided by the manufacturer, report that all the sectors 
of the disk are okay.  

I haven't run badblocks(8) yet, that's next...

So two questions:

1) What other tools are available to exercise the disk?  Compiling 
the kernel certainly creates activity, but I'd prefer something 
that is more systematic (and thorough!)  

2) Can you obtain a list of bad blocks from an IDE (ATA?) drive?  
(Yes, I know that this is supported by SCSI drives, but that's 
not the question here.)  

cheers,

behoffski
