&gt;Having (1) searched the SA Government web-site - obviously based on IIS
&gt;and ASP - it appears that the Hon. Dr. Michael Armitage, MP is the 
&gt;Minister most likely to be able to suggest IT policy for the whole SA 
&gt;Government.
&gt;
&gt;He is in charge of:
&gt;
&gt;* ICS
&gt; - a body that developes internal computing services for the Government
&gt;
&gt;* Information and Economic Policy Office
&gt; - the name speaks for itself
&gt;
&gt;I would suggest that he, or a speaker from the latter office I've
&gt;mentioned (or both) would make an interesting discussion at a LinuxSA
&gt;meeting. Keeping an open mind we could, quite simply, ask the Minister
&gt;to talk about the Government's support of IT in general and how the
&gt;Government views the growing (I think) Linux/BSD based IT industry...

We should also ask for a speaker from Labour and the Democrats ... 

This would have the effect of raising the profile of LinuxSA in South
Australia so that politicians understand that we are interested in what is
happening, and that we vote and that we care.

We will also have to ensure that the meeting is well attended!

&gt;Now, I haven't proposed this e-mail to create a discussion about IT
&gt;policy in the SA Government. Nor am I attempting to elicit political
&gt;responses based on the Minister's part affiliation, or that he is a
&gt;member of the current Government. Hence, if you reply on list your reply
&gt;should discuss the merits or lack thereof of inviting the Minister, or
&gt;his representative(s) as a public speaker.

&gt;The original started with the word "From" but some e-mail systems escape
&gt;that with a &gt; (&gt;). Don't you hate that?
