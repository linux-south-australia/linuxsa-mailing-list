&gt; David & All,

&gt; i have intentionally bought & setup network equipment, set up samba, php4 and
&gt; mysql'd my web site, killed 486's celerons and the like, all in the name of
&gt; learning. TAFE is shit house, i have leart 100 times more stuff tinkering with and
&gt; killing my network, breaking programs at home that TAFE could have taught me!
&gt; i hardly use samba, but i can say i have set it up, and know how to use and
&gt; administer it. this is the reason why!!

I taught myself to drive.  Who needs teachers?
One day, while Dad was away, I went out to the shed and just had a go.  It felt
good.  Later I had another try and this time I got the engine running, but I
couldn't work out how to get the damned thing moving.
Eventually, after several tries, I succeeded.  Although I killed two chickens,
demolished the pigsty and severely damaged the shed (It turned out I hadn't
found out how to brake) Mum and Dad congratulated me on my initiative
and encouraged me to persist.
It wasn't long before I graduated to a more powerful machine - Dad's V8 ute.
Unfortunately, it took off in reverse a whole lot faster than I anticipated and
I accidentally ran down my younger brother.  The whole family was upset about
that.

Anyway,  I learned my driving in the school of hard knocks.  The one thing I
have that no driving school can give is EXPERIENCE.  On that basis I reckon I
am a far better driver than any of those 'qualified' smart alecs.  Society
should recognise the real practical skills that people like me have, don't you
think?
