I can't say I've ever had it happen to me on a Linux box, but that's not
that uncommon on Win9x machines.  When an application becomes unstable, it
can do funky things with the i/o buffers.  It sounds like a buffer overflow.
As you put it, it would sound like an invalid key was being held down.  In
Windows, this can sometimes be resolved without rebooting if you can manage
to kill the application.  (Not easy since the mouse and/or keyboard wouldn't
be responding...)

I've also seen keyboard and/or mouse lock-ups after static discharge, which
could sometimes(although rarely) cause the same symptom.  In the latter
instance, only a reboot will solve the problem.

I don't know that I'd worry about it unless it happens again a couple more
times in the near future.

&gt; &gt; I have just rebooted my computer after a rather strange occurance.  My
&gt; &gt; netscape froze for no apparent reason, which was strange enough in
&gt; &gt; itself, but then I clicked on the window menu so I could kill
&gt; &gt; netscape, and after clicking my machine started beeping wildly at me
&gt; &gt; and wouldn't stop.  It sounded a bit like I was holding down an
&gt; &gt; invalid key and so beeping multiply --- although it seemed to beep a
&gt; &gt; bit faster than that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, thinking it might be a keyboard problem, I pulled the keyboard
&gt; &gt; out of its socket (and I pulled the mouse out too) and waited a while,
&gt; &gt; but the beeping continued.  After waiting some time, and not being
&gt; &gt; able to do much else, I rebooted the machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What went wrong?  Possible contenders are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  I am running kernel 2.4.0-test10, so perhaps that has a bug in it?
&gt; &gt; 2.  I am running helix gnome and sawfish --- problem?
&gt; &gt; 3.  Hardware fault?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts anyone?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,

&gt; Many moden mother boards have a over temp alarm wich will beep repeatedly
&gt; check your bios settings . if you have an over temp alarm check
&gt; to see what
&gt; temp it is set for.
&gt; note if its set quite high and is still going off [ the bios
&gt; should report the
&gt; temp for you]  check you cpu cooling fan it may not be working well.
