Matthew!

&gt; Morning Guys & Gals
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, I hope this comes out in plain text 'cos I'm writing in Outlook
&gt; 2000

&lt;self musing&gt;
* he's politically correct
* he makes an effort to get Outlook 2000 to speak text
* perhaps the people (and I must confess, I use the term with the
greatest advice) who can't get Outlook 2000 to speak test after system
crashs might take notice
&lt;/self musing&gt;

Now...

&gt; Reinstalled my Linux onto my main HDD tonight(dual boot with win 98) -
&gt; instead of the having it on old one that was hanging in my PC

Should I ask whether you backed up any important data before you did
this :-?

&gt; noticed that my drive is set to slave but didn't think much of it at the
&gt; time.

&gt; then played around for a while and decided to change my boot loader over to
&gt; lilo [on Linux 2.4.0]
&gt; booted RH7.2 cd & typed rescue

So you've installed a "dot zero" kernel onto a "dot zero" RedHat system.
Exactly how did you install 2.4.0? I hope you used an RPM created by
RedHat itself because it's s-gcc (stuffed GCC) 2.96 is, well, not
guaranteed to work.

&gt; any help would be appreciated

Doing a quick search at <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A> for "RedHat 7.0 grub"
(without the parenthesis) comes up with bits and pieces and I'd surmise,
but that it's some kind of module loader or thing. If you have the
space, I think the safest way to recover would be:

* Install RedHat 6.2/Debian (or whatever just NOT RedHat 7.0) onto a
totally separate partition
 - the separate partition doesn't have to be large

* Mount the RedHat 7.0 partitions from that installation

* Get the data you really need from it

And forget about using RedHat 7.0 until RedHat 7.1.

Incidentally, it's been noted that RedHat have gone quiet on the updates
and that this is usually indicative of a new release, or bugfix release
about to appear (within three to four weeks - kinda like Linux 2.4.0
which was always about to appear)...
