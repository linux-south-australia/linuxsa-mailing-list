<H1>Netscape address book problem</H1>

Hello Linux gurus of South Oz,
I'd like to ask two trivial questions of this prestigious group and I'm
hoping that they haven't been answered too many times in the past and
that the asking of them doesn't make me seem too ridiculous.

My first question relates to that wonderful browser, Netscape, and it's
beautiful (thick sarcasm) e-mail system.
Each time I choose an e-mail address from the address book to include in
an e-mail, Netscape and the e-mail I'm composing drop out on me, it's
very frustrating. Is there something I can do to remedy this problem?
I used to use good ol' reliable Pine, and personally it's quite adequate
for my needs, but I'm sharing the use of my system with my "significant
other" who has only used Windohs in the past, so ...... she "needs" a
nice flashy graphical e-mail system, oh well.

My second queary relates to Mozilla, in a failed attempt to fix my email
problem I've installed Mozilla 0.6 (I've also tried build 18), now it
seems to work ok'ish, and in principle it's a great browser to use, my
worry with it is that it seems to use about 8 times the memory of
Netscape!! thus sucking up all of my systems meager resources. I just
downloaded the 'full installer' and followed the clear directions. Has
anyone else had this problem or have I stuffed up big time without
knowing it?

System specs are
166Mhz pentium
64 Meg RAM
Redhat 7 (2.2.16-22) - upgraded from 6.2 with Bastille Linux

I'm not sure what information I should include to make my problem
clearer or to aid in it's solving, if anything is needed, please ask and
I'll supply it straight away.
If anyone can point me to some relevant information or give me some
direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
David Creed
