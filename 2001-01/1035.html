Hi.

I think I can comment on this, but I don't think the task can be done with
available tools. I think your friends best option is to either do as you
first suggested and netatalk a linux box as a file server for important
files, keeping a vanilla as possible Mac system on the iMac; or grab a
copy of retrospect and schedule a nightly backup via ftp to the linux box.
(actually retrospect ftp works very well, I used it on the last major
upgrade of my G3)

A virgin Mac system install is pretty quick, and there is not much to do
once you kick it off until you reboot the Mac with the system installed.
Your friend could have a spare drive on the shelf with the system on it,
just waiting for the failure..

BTW, what is he trying to protect against? Hardware failure is pretty rare
on the (ide) drives on iMacs...

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Hello All,
&gt; 
&gt; I was approached yesterday by a friend who works for a primary school
&gt; who wanted to know how he could backup his iMac 'Fileserver' to a Linux
&gt; box.
&gt; 
&gt; I initally suggested using netatalk and copying across the user data
&gt; each night, efectively keeping a copy.
&gt; 
&gt; This is apparently not satisfactory. If the server dies, he wants to be
&gt; able to go to the Linux Server, rip out the backup data hard disk, and
&gt; put it into the iMac.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought maybe using rsh to pipe the contents of the hard disk to the
&gt; remote one, but I then remembed that it needed to run on a PPC
&gt; Processor.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that distributions such as LinuxPPC and MkLinux exist, but I
&gt; wasn't sure how I would go about getting a small (TomsRTBT sized) Linux
&gt; onto a CD (as the iMac has no floppy) and booting up into Linux, so that
&gt; I could run a small shell script to do the rsh stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to be able to give my friend some advice, but not having all of
&gt; the answers myself, I was hoping that someone from LinuxSA might have an
&gt; idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Your thoughts, suggestions and comments are all greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Kind Regards
