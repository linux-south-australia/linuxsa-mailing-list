Martin!

&gt; This is a strange one. I running POSTFIX on my server (POP3 incoming
&gt; mail and SMTP outgoing mail) and a mix of OUTLOOK EXPRESS and OUTLOOK
&gt; 2000 on my client PC's.

I see. You're Outlook has created one of those silly mime contraptions
that double one's bandwidth.

&gt; Someone at my place of employment forwarded 5 JPEG files to me (they
&gt; use Outlook Express).

Isn't that wonderful? They're probably either:

a) jokes
b) pornography
c) business related graphics

Did they happen to SAY what they were?

&gt; However my Outlook 2000 couldn't display them.

Ever tried pine-&gt;save attachments-&gt;X-&gt;gimp?

&gt; Outlook 2000 decided to display these JPEG files as text (shows the
&gt; code that makes up these files).

I'm spinning around, get out of my way...you know I love you 'cos I like
it like that...(1)

&gt; However, if we saved these files to their hard drive and then created
&gt; a new email and attached these 5 JPEG files, my Outlook displays them
&gt; properly.

So, this implies that DumbBlind 2000 can't cope with DumbBlind Not 2K
emails with JPEG attachments...

&gt; There are only a few of us who are using Outlook 2000, so I forwarded
&gt; the original email to another user using Outlook 2000. The email
&gt; arrived perfectly.

Isn't that wonderful?

&gt; Has anyone seen/heard of a problem like this? Can anyone help?

I have to thank you very much for this e-mail. It even makes my
laterally on topic discussions about politics or religion and Linux look
like they're on topic...

My diagnosis:

* You were trying to work out whether the mailing system (presumably
running on some kinds of Unix/SVR4/BSD/Mongrel based code) was buggering
your email

Well, it's not. Trust me. Unless you're using Microsoft Exchange, I
would almost, 99% guarantee that the mail transport agent isn't
surreptitiously ambushing, destroying and killing the e-mail.

My advice:

* Want reliable e-mail?

Downgrade Outlook or reboot the computer running it or both...

OK, I like Kylie Minogue. How droll...
