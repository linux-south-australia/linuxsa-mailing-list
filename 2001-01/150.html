&gt; The kernel keeps track of the number of times that you have mounted any
&gt; one particular partition. If that partitions is marked as being
&gt; checkable (i.e. run fsck on it at initialisation) the kernel initiates
&gt; this process. It appears that most partitions will fsck on the same
&gt; time, however because of the way the system is initialised fsck does not
&gt; parallelize; that is to say it runs sequentially.

Not quite, the kernel doen't do anything to the filesystems.  The filesystem
itself (I assume ext2 fs or similar) keeps track of homw many times it has 
been mounted.  When fsck is run in /etc/rc.d/sysinit (or similar) it goes 
through all the filesytems in /etc/fstab and checks them if needed.

&gt; 1) do start up stuff
&gt; 2) read /etc/fstab
&gt; 3) get mount counts for all file systems to be mounted
&gt; 4) determine which ones need to be fsck'ed
&gt; 5) run a parallel fsck on them all

So step 1,2 are already done by /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit.

And 3,4 are done already by fsck

The run parallel brings in a number of other issues.

  o Running them serial will take time.  
  o Running them purely in parallel is bad if they are on the same disk.
  o Running them in serial if they are on the same disk is the best we can do
    (to avoid thrashing the disks).
  o Running the disks in parallel in also fine (the bottle neck is the 
    physical speed of the disk).

So, what happens is exactly that.  The partitions are ordered by physical 
disk and each list run concurrently.  

So all in all your situation can't be improved much using existing 
2.2 filesystems.  The fsck time for journaling filesystems might be 
different - YMMV.

The last thing that might be an option is getting 2-4 smaller disks and 
running large partitions.

Matthew
