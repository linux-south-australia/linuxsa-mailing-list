List,

I am trying to help a friend install RedHat 6.2. I have a couple of
problems:
1.	I am in Adelaide
2.	Friend is in Mudgee NSW
3.	It is several years since I did a RedHat install

If someone gets an 'ah HA!' when they read this problem description,
please let me know so I can try to get the friend up and running. Then I
will suggest they subscribe to this list for further help ;-)

Problem Description:
Installing RedHat 6.2 from CD (unknown origin). System is a Pentium
class something, 6Gb hard disk, 64Mb RAM. Two existing FAT32 partitions
exist, approx 3Gb each. Intention is to drop Linux into the space taken
up now by the second FAT32 partition, making a large 'hold-all' root
partition and a 128Mb swap partition.

Boot from CD, run either fdisk or disk druid from GUI install menu,
unable to change (delete+add+add) existing second FAT32 partition into a
swap partition and an ext2 root partition. Delete seems to happen ok in
Disk Druid. Fdisk identifies three existing partitions, not two, and has
trouble with deleting the second and third partitions. Disk Druid
identifies two existing FAT32 partitions, and will make a swap
partition, but not an ext2 partition in the place of the second FAT32
partition. Error generated by Disk Druid looks something like 'boot
partition is too large'. I figured this might have something to do with
the LILO limitation, but I thought we could do the install and use a
boot floppy if necessary to get to Linux.

Sorry this is a bit sketchy, but doing this by remote control is quite
difficult.

Any ideas anyone??

TIA

Bruce
