&gt; &gt;I am interested in why you think RH7.0 is a crock.  Would you care to go
&gt; &gt;into more detail?

I posed this question, not because I was contemplating using RH7.0 and 
wanted to see what others thought, rather I was interested in why people 
seem to be bagging RH 7.0.
I have commented below.


&gt;1. Historical. RH X.0 has always had problems, and that includes 4.0, 5.0
&gt;    and 6.0.

I agree (partially) . RH 5.0 sucked.  RH 6.0 had install problems.
I have installed RH7.0 on quite a few machines (varied architecture) now 
and haven't had a problem with it.

&gt;2. Experience. I have installed or upgraded several machines with 7.0, and
&gt;    have had some major problems, esp with:
&gt;
&gt;    a- The GCC version they ship
&gt;
&gt;    b- The 2.2.16 kernel source RPM would not compile at all even with egcs.
&gt;       I had to upgrade to 2.2.18 ...
&gt;
&gt;    c- Which meant that I could not get VMware to work at all until I upgraded
&gt;
&gt;    d- Prior to upgrading the kernel, modules would not compile.
&gt;
&gt;    e- DOCBOOK still seems broken, although DL may be overzealous in upgrading
&gt;       things.
&gt;
&gt;However, the interface is slick, umm, that is, the shell, which has always
&gt;been slick :-) The GUI is kinda nice as well, but I am only a user.

I disagree with this.  Sure, there are teething problems with some small 
parts of RH 7.0.  If you keep up to date with the patches as they come out, 
I don't think that these problems are major enough to warrant avoiding this 
version.
If we all took this attitude, who would report bugs?  Would we be waiting 
12+ months for the next release.  A little pain and suffering for the 
greater good isn't that much to deal with.

I use RH 7.0 on 3 proxy servers, 1 mail server, 1 DNS, An IMP server and 
several workstations (including two laptops).
It seems to perform better than 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2.

Of course all of the above is based on personal experience and is my opinion.
You can take it or leave it as you wish.

&gt; &gt;&gt;My first suggestion is, don't use RH7.0. It is a crock. Use RH 6.2 and wait
&gt; &gt;&gt;for RH 7.1.
