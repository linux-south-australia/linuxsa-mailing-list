&gt; This gear is really cheap (The genuine Lucent cards retail for about

More like around $600 RRP, isn't it?

&gt; and an antenna, pigtail and all the bits add up to
&gt; about $600.

But you are missing the equipment to plug the wireless cards into at
either end :-)

&gt; The gear is capable of 10Mbit/Sec (It adjusts iself
&gt; according to noise / environment) which is nothing to sneeze at.

Well, depending on what gear the cards are in, yes. But some equipment
the cards plug into will drop that to as low as around 2Mbps
half-duplex.
 
&gt; As the gear is capable of an Access Point mode, you can connect several
&gt; clients to one "Central" antenna, acting somewhat like a 10Mb hub --
&gt; sharing the central antenna.

The Lucent Access Points have pretty high software licensing fees to
allow this feature (well, their software fees are pretty high for any of
their features :-) Cabletron and Enterasys have some similarly featured
products at a lower price than Lucent that have been recently become
available, but I've not had a chance to test their abilities yet.

&gt; Possibly the Lucent gear is a solution? 

Possibly. But I think Simon was looking at something that Agile can
provide some level of QoS with, and the Lucent or equivalent products by
themselves may not cut it for this application, and they will need a
decent router added into the system, upping the cost even more. Then
again, who am I to suggest what Simon is thinking? :-)

&gt; I'd be interested in your, and other people's opinions, comments etc on
&gt; the viability of such a delivery medium.

Well, it definitely works in the type of application that we are using
them for.

Cheers,
