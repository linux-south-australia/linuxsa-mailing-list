Last evening, Simon Hackett in his talk at
Engineering House about setting up a Carrier
for telecommunications mentioned in rather positive
terms the idea that phone calls over the Internet
may in future be charged at a distance-independent rate.

Well, this morning at 10:30, I got a phone call from
the Philippines asking me if I'd like to receive
a free copy of some business magazine.
They found my phone number through the government's
information on me, which has been posted on the Internet
for all the junk mailers of this world to see.

Thought:
If phone calls are charged in the new Internet paradigm
in a distance-independent manner, and if everyone becomes
a business person (due to the government's propensity to
classify everyone and their dog as a business person),
and if all business people get into directories on the
Internet, then we can all expect to receive regular
offers of free magazine issues from every country on this
jolly little planet!!

As if junk mail weren't bad enough!
What I need is a "procmail" program for voice calls.

I'm beginning to think that communication isn't such a good
thing after all.

By the way, the previous free magazine offer I received
on the phone was from Thailand.

Cheers and grunge,
Alan Kennington.
