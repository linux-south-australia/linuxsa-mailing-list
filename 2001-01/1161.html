You young whippersnapper :)

Actually, there's a subtle underlying issue in the above that's worth 
pointing out - total loss of US&lt;-&gt;Australian connectivity is now very 
rare, but it is in fact quite common for an individual national 
and/or international upstream to loose international connectivity or 
to suffer an internal routing meltdown in their own national network 
(happened to Telstra as a downstream consequence of loosing a fibre 
link into Asia a month or two ago, for instance), while all the 
others stay up.

The point is that a single-homed ISP, especially, is at a high degree 
of vulnerability in this situation, unless they have a DNS server on 
someone elses' backbone, and ideally in someone elses' country.  But 
even a multi-homed ISP can loose connectivity to you, if you and they 
don't share a common national backbone provider, and a peering link 
between the two (or more) national backbones fails in a strange 
enough manner (for instance, high congestion but not sufficiently 
complete loss to break the BGP link between the two entities)

Partial failures in 'the matrix' are exceedingly common - that's why 
most major ISP's are multi-homed, but even then it's sometimes not 
enough. And routing issues in the global internet are the epitome of 
a head f**k at the best of times - the situation is so complex that 
solutions that might seem rational in a corporate environment (like 
dynamic routing protocols) just don't scale. Welcome to the nightmare 
of the devil we can't do without - BGP4 :)

Cheers,
Simon
