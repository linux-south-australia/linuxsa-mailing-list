&gt; &gt; TCP is on the transport layer and ICMP is too. but surly TCP is needed 
&gt; &gt; to send a ping.  are you sure that ICMP is on the transport layer?
&gt;
&gt; yes, he is sure. Ports are implemented _within_ TCP (& UDP). TCP and UDP
&gt; (and ICMP) packets are transported using IP.
&gt;
&gt; Think of it like a phone system. IP is like the number you dial. With TCP
&gt; and UDP, it's like you are asking to speak to a particular person (port
&gt; number). With ICMP, it's like you are talking to the phone, and hence,
&gt; don't need to ask for anyone by name. But you still need the phone number
&gt; to call to talk to that phone (you still need the IP transport packet).
&gt;
&gt; so: IP can contain TCP, UDP or ICMP (and others). TCP and UDP implement
&gt; ports. ICMP doesn't. Note that all ports are is a mechanism for telling a
&gt; particular program to deal with a particular packet. Send a packet to TCP
&gt; port 80, and it goes to `httpd`. Send a packet to UDP port 69, and it goes
&gt; to `tftpd`. If you have a telnet session set up, it will be listening on a
&gt; random tcp port &gt; 1024 -- that is how packets meant for it, as opposed to
&gt; any other telnet session, are identified. There is no `pingd`. No program
&gt; needs to be identified to run it. It's an _essential_ part of any TCP/IP
&gt; stack (TCP/IP includes the entire suite of protocols -- IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP
&gt; and so on). So, the networking software itself responds to the ICMP
&gt; packets. There is no need for ports. It's just like talking to the
&gt; telephone itself. BUT, just like with TCP and UDP, you still need the IP
&gt; layer to get you to the correct computer in the first place.
&gt;
&gt; seriously, go get some sleep, then go and buy that book I mentioned. :)
