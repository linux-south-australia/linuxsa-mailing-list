&gt;&gt; then about 500 µs to transfer the data, you can imagine what an impact
&gt;&gt; that is: it effectively halves the throughput.
&gt;
&gt; So, if I run software RAID over two UDMA 66 IDE drives on the same IDE
&gt; bus (1), doesn't that imply that it defeats the purpose?

Indeed it does.

&gt; Let's say I stripe (RAID 2 is it, I always get the numbers back to
&gt; front)...

RAID-2 is completely obsolete.  Hamming codes, wasted disks and
things.

&gt; RQ1:
&gt;  HD1 CYL1
&gt;
&gt; RQ2
&gt;  HD2 CYL2
&gt;
&gt; (Where I've requested some data, it goes to the first hard drive,
&gt; cylinder one for the first block and request 2 and so forth)
&gt;
&gt; But if they serialise then I may as well do:
&gt;
&gt; RQ1L
&gt;  HD1 CYL1
&gt;  HD1 NB
&gt;
&gt; (where NB is the next block)
&gt;
&gt; Which would have the added advantage of no software RAID interpretation
&gt; between me and my file system (and a less complex system, blah, blah).
&gt;
&gt; &lt;hmmm&gt;
&gt; I need to purchase another HD and fiddle with this
&gt; &lt;/hmmm&gt;

Hmm.  I'm not sure you've addressed enough of the issues.  I try to at
<A HREF="http://www.vinumvm.org/vinum/intro.html,">http://www.vinumvm.org/vinum/intro.html,</A> but it's a complicated
business.  To compress it into a couple of lines, though, RAID tends
to issue multiple requests in parallel.  Put one ATA (IDE) drive on
each controller, and it works fine.  Put two ATA drives on each
controller, and it works at half the speed.  And yes, I have a
prototype NAS box here, built by a company which thinks it knows what
it's doing, and they've chosen a motherboard with 2 ATA66 controllers
over one with 4 ATA33 controllers.  No question which is faster for
RAID.
