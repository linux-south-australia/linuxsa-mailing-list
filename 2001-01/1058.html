&gt; I think that the general concept of allowing unused Mb

&gt; more than 500Mb download limit per month on a *continual* 
&gt; basis, but allowing unused Mb accrue up to a certain 
&gt; limit would probably solve the problem.

May as well add my 2c worth.

One thing that puts me off bandwidth charging is that I know that a lot of
the data I download is *not* costing the ISP in question x cents per
megabyte, however that charge is passed on to me.

With a specific download in mind, I will look around for a suitable
mirror, 'suitable' being one that is connected to my ISP via some sort of
peering arrangement, where data costs nothing or next to nothing.

Now I more than appreciate there are some fairly large technical issues in
differentiating between 'expensive' and 'cheap' downloads. However I
personally would be happy to jump through a few hoops if it meant I wasn't
charged/was minimally charged for data which didn't cost my ISP much. 

For instance using a particular proxy server to access SAIX connected
archives. 

Anyway, I know there are a whole boatload of technical issues there, but
it's food for thought.
