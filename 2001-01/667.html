&gt; &gt; In addition I think the teachers are allowed to use copies at home.
&gt; 
&gt; Whic schools are you talking about? As far as I know, we pay around $112
&gt; per Pentium-class or greater machine each year. This covers a small list
&gt; of Microsoft's desktop software. Even if we don't run Windows on a
&gt; machine, we are still supposed to pay this "tax" on it. I'd hardly say
&gt; that that is free.

State schools.
My info could be incorrect, but that is what I am lead to believe.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So the tco is not likely to be lower, I would suggest probably higher due
&gt; &gt; to higher support costs.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the support we have to offer is not on how to use software, but
&gt; more on fixing things that are broke. If we were using any multi-user
&gt; operating system on the desktops, we could cut down our support by a
&gt; significant amount, as we could implement effective security.
&gt; 

You are a  fulltime support guy at a school, I believe?

Most state schools from k-7 from my understadning dont have such a beast.
At best they can expect to access a guy on a limited basuis with limited
skills, or to pay for an outside consultant at outside consultant rates.

I suspect that the support for widespread *nix delployment would be much
higher overall. There is imply less familiarity amongst the community at
large.

In most cases a teacher would not be able to ask a parent of a child, ask
their own children or spouse for help, because *nix is simply not widely
used in the greater comunity. This from my experience happens a hell of a
lot now(of course a lot of the time I cant help, because I dont knwo
windows that well).


&gt; &gt; In addition it is quite possible that a kid who uses workd 98 this year
&gt; &gt; will use word 2o00 nexct year.
&gt; 
&gt; ... And will need to learn all of the differences between the two
&gt; versions. Staff also need to be re-trained (not just in how to use it,
&gt; but being confident enough to be able to teach it).
&gt; 

Yes.
However that was not the point I was adressing with that paragraph.

The point is they will quite possibly leave school having used the "the
latest and greatest" (whatever that may be).

Typcialy these changes from version to version are evolutionary, not
revolutionary.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I sometimes wonder if the Independent Schools Association might not be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; better target?
&gt; 
&gt; Better, yes. The Catholic Education Office might also be worth a look.
&gt; The biggest problem that I have found is the 3rd party applications
&gt; which *must* be run by all schools. Funnily enough the vendors of these
&gt; products aren't interested in porting their apps, as they already have
&gt; guaranteed income. People like SSABSA inflict software upon schools
&gt; which the school *must* run, but they are so proprietry that they don't
&gt; (at the moment) run under wine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Possibly they might not be covered under he all encompassing agreement
&gt; &gt; that I believe are in place with state schools.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are talking about the Microsoft / Schools License agreement, it's
&gt; not optional for SA state schools, but is for others.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I also dont think that anything much will happen over the next few years,
&gt; &gt; possibly decade.
&gt; 
&gt; This is where you are wrong. There are a number of people who are really
&gt; looknig around for an 'edge' over other schools, or just something that
&gt; works. We will see Linux used for teaching in schools over the next
&gt; couple of years. It will be slow, but it has started. We're hoping to be
&gt; using a few older machines to teach Networking to the Certificate III
&gt; students (yr 11 / 12). They won't be running Windows.

These is a difference between teaching Computer Science liek topoics, such
as networking to yr 12s and techign english to year 3s. I ahve continually
made this distinction through out the thread, and continually stated that
for CS like topics that an open source *nix would be excellent.

I just cant see it being used by a grade 3 to do their "what I did in teh
holidays composition".
