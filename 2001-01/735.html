Point taken, & i would have said the same ;- )
Unfortunately I couldnt leave it alone, needed the extra PCI slots for more
NIC (yes i know i could've given existing NICs dual IP addresses, but thats
not as good as physically separate interfaces)

Good news is that I have the machine running now.  Some unnamed idiot who
looks a whole lot like me was referring to the wrong installation notes.  
Originally I did a test install of the proxy server, & the root partition
for that was on hda5.
The live install (the one which is currently on the machine) had the root
partition on hda7.
No wonder the kernel couldnt find init, its not usually located in
/home!!!!!
It still refuses to boot with the kernel on the hard drive (errors about not
syncing), but booting with the 2.2.18 floppy works ok.  I'll be compiling a
2.2.18 kernel & it all should work fine.

Thanks

- Daddy! Do you know that sun rise and falls everyday?
- Did you checked it?
- Yep!
- Does it have any bugs?
- Nope!
- And it still working?
- Yep!
- THEN LEAVE IT ALONE!

Sometimes it not good idea to break something which working. At least new
box doesn't cost your pain and unhappy clients, isn't it?

I think that your problem is that you have different chipset for disks or
something about it. Or if your boot disk is SCSI you must have SCSI support
compiled into kernel.
	
Sometimes LILO cannot pass all (or some - don't know exactly) to kernel. In
this case try to add option in lilo.conf (if have access)
append="init=/bin/sh".

Regards,
Vladimir
