Hi,

&gt; &gt;Do please let this list know the instant you can justify repricing an
&gt; &gt;Agile wireless connection to compete with ADSL. I'm sure many here would
&gt; &gt;be most interested but the current spread spectrum installation fee is
&gt; &gt;something like 40 times that of ADSL, isn't it? Maybe I misunderstood this
&gt; &gt;comment.


 I currently use Lucent WaveLAN gear for my Internet Connection to
another ISP in the city. It works like a charm and is really nice.

This gear is really cheap (The genuine Lucent cards retail for about
$300, I believe) and an antenna, pigtail and all the bits add up to
about $600. The gear is capable of 10Mbit/Sec (It adjusts iself
according to noise / environment) which is nothing to sneeze at.

As the gear is capable of an Access Point mode, you can connect several
clients to one "Central" antenna, acting somewhat like a 10Mb hub --
sharing the central antenna.
 

&gt; I'm mulling over a middle ground which I might call 'wireless ADSL' 
&gt; with a lower installation fee and a different QoS to the Agile 
&gt; wireless derived service. Its complicated by various issues and they 
&gt; aren't trivial - but it's 'on the list', yes.


Possibly the Lucent gear is a solution? It's cheap for people to get,
install is trivial and costs pretty much nothing for data transport. I
know there are issues with the ACA etc. But I've been quite impressed
with the gear during the time that I've used it, and maybe a specialist
product could be worth a look. Maybe this could be 'Wireless ADSL' as it
is relatively easy to configure these things to run at rates similar to
ADSL (or faster :-)

I'd be interested in your, and other people's opinions, comments etc on
the viability of such a delivery medium.

Regards,
