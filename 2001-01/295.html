Hi all,

As some of you know, I'm writing a new (GPL'd) revision control system
called Katie.  If you're not a programmer and you're not particularly
interested in revision control systems, you can probably skip to the
next message in your inbox.

If you're familiar with ClearCase, you'll know what I'm trying to
achieve.  If you're familar with CVS, the most obvious difference is
that rather than copying the files from a repository to your
workspace, you mount the repository as a filesystem.  This leads to a
few neat things:

- The equivalent of 'cvs checkout' is nearly instantaneous as there is
  no need to download any files.

- Access to previous versions of files can be done through the
  filesystem using standard Unix commands.  For example, instead of:
    cvs diff -r1.1 -r1.2 myfile
  you can do:
    diff myfile@@/main/1 myfile@@/main/2
  'myfile@@' is a hidden directory containing the entire revision
  history of 'myfile', so you can of course use shell wildcard
  expansion:
    diff myfile@@/main/[12]

The above is partly what drove me to start writing Katie, but the main
reason was the lack of support for directory versioning that CVS has.
In Katie, directories are versioned just like regular files, so if you
delete a file, you can go back and see it just by looking at a
previous version of the directory (again, through the filesystem, so
no new commands are needed -- for example 'mydirectory@@/main/3' would
contain the contents of the third revision of mydirectory).

Katie has reached the stage where everything I've described above
works fine, but there is still lots that's missing (like tags/labels,
branches, permissions, and a thousand other things).

If this (in its primitive state) sounds interesting to you, I'm
looking for people to start playing with it and giving me feedback (or
even assisting with its development).  To download it, see:
