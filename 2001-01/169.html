IMHO, successive compiles should produce identical results, not one
bit out of place as confirmed by checksums.  However, there are a 
number of things that can spoil this.  For instance, minor upgrades
to your system using a dependancy checking package manager may update
shared libraries.  Some programmers introduce a date/time stamp into
their code (Linux kernel).  The operation of make/Makefile could result
in a dependancy due to unintended file save that alters the sequence
in which *.o file are presented to the linker.  

As much as I'd like to use checksums to help confirm that a given
piece of source respresents a particular executable, its not always
possible.  If you are lucky, you may be able to confirm that two
instances of an executable are from the same source if "sum" or "diff"
confirms it.  However, the converse may not hold true, bit-wise 
different executables _could_ have been produced from the same
source.

Hope this helps,

&gt;This is going to sound particularly weird, but if I were to compile a
&gt;program with the same compiler and same compiler flags would it create
&gt;exactly (I mean EXACTLY) the same machine code each time? Or could each
&gt;compilation be subtly different?
