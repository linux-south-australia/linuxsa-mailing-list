&gt;What Windows is: It's the beautiful Boing-747. People in nice clothes
&gt;boarding it. Then it makes its airborne and after few minutes explodes in
&gt;the air.
&gt;What Linux is: alot of people in dirt and oily clothes come to runway and
&gt;start assembling something which looks like a plane. After this one is
&gt;completed it get the airborne and then fly away behind horizon.

Here's the extended version of this one:

UNIX Airways
Everyone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport.

They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece, 
arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building.

Air DOS
Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the
plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on
again,
and so on ...

Mac Airlines
All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act
exactly the same.  Every time you ask questions about details, you are
gently
but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and
everything
will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up.

Windows Air
The terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage
check
and boarding, and a smooth take-off.  After about 10 minutes in the air, the
plane 
explodes with no warning whatsoever.


Windows NT Air
Just like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes
out all 
the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes.


Linux Air
Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own
airline.  
They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves.
They charge 
a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also
download and 
print the ticket yourself.  When you board the plane, you are given a seat,
four bolts, 
a wrench and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html.  Once settled, the fully
adjustable seat is 
very comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single
problem, the 
in-flight meal is wonderful.  You try to tell customers of the other
airlines about 
the great trip, but all they can say is, "You had to do what with the seat?"
