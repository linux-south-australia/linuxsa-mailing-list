Hi James & David

You could also check out <A HREF="http://www.manpower.com.au">http://www.manpower.com.au</A> as they have a branch in 
Adelaide where you can join the Global Learning Centre and learn Linux and 
others for free.

&gt; &gt;     Where is the best place for somone to get training in the sysadmin
&gt; &gt; side of things, particulary unix and linux?? where did you all get
&gt; &gt; qualifications?
&gt;
&gt; Try looking out for:
&gt;
&gt; * <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/">http://www.iit-training.com.au/</A>
&gt;
&gt; They run "Hands On Linux Courses". I think its current presenter/tutor
&gt; is Richard Sharpe (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:sharpe@ns.aus.com">sharpe@ns.aus.com</A>) and I know he's led a
&gt; number of these courses in the past.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; i want to be a sysadmin later in life, what course(es) do you all
&gt; &gt; reccomend?
&gt;
&gt; I didn't do any courses. In fact, I decided I'd start a B.Info Tech at
&gt; Flinders and ended up telling the tutors how to fix the problems that
&gt; occurred in my first tutorial.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; i am doing diploma IT at tafe, and it is boring. virtually no linux any
&gt; &gt; where. are thier any current sysadmins here?
&gt;
&gt; A good many of us are. If you have no money at all (which being a
&gt; student is probably the case), I'd just suggest setting up a little
&gt; network at home and tinkering. Take a look at various job descriptions
&gt; (start at <A HREF="http://www.linux.org.au/">http://www.linux.org.au/</A> who have a job section) and see what
&gt; you would need to know and teach yourself...
&gt;
&gt; We'll help you, even when your computer crashes, you have to use Outlook
&gt; and forget to change the HTML settings (1)...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; i an not wanting to do computer science, i have heard it is VERY
&gt; &gt; mathematical, of  which i am not...!
&gt;
&gt; Have you actually looked at a syllabus? If you get into real multi-media
&gt; programming, graphics and a host of other applications, having a good
&gt; grounding in theoretical mathematics is almost imperative. By "real" I
&gt; mean not the "use the gimp - create graphics", I mean "create graphical
&gt; applications using some prog. language"...
