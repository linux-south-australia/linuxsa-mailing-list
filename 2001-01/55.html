<H1>which line does sendmail access denial apply to?</H1>

Suppose I get bits and pieces of junk mail from all
kinds of random addresses, and suppose the
"From" line shows a different source address to the
"Received:" line.

Now suppose I create a file /etc/mail/access.db
containing a bunch of domains and addresses.

Question:
Which lines do the access denials refer to?

Since the most authentic line is probably the "Received:"
line (e.g. a couple of weeks ago, I got an email
which was "From" someone at ibm.com, but "Received:"
from somewhere completely different), I'd like to know
which domain name I should be putting in the
access.db file.
If it blocks only the "From" line, then I'm going to
block the wrong domains.
If it blocks the "Received:" source address, then
I need to hit the "e" key in mutt or whatever mailer,
and read the real source, and put that in the access file.

Someone out there must have worked this all out.

I've checked the sendmail book, but I can't make sense of that.
I've also ready the sendmail.cf file, and I can't make
sense of that either.
But my access.db file appears (via the K command) in
many different rules.
Sendmail.cf files are about as much fun to read as
hexadecimal machine language dumps.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
