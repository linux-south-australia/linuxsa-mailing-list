&gt; Very much so agreed. what can we do to stop this? i beleive that the only way is
&gt; to get Linux into primary schools how ever that will become hard now, because
&gt; you would believe that it would be mandatory for schools to have m$ based
&gt; computers...
&gt; 
&gt; Rsises point...  too hard for kids? ther is a debian project for kids that could
&gt; be used...

Don't think this is the issue - at least it would be readily overcome if it
were.

As I see it you are both correct, and it IS an issue that governments and
governmental institutions in SA are making M$ their standard.  (Yuk!)
I suppose we should be fair and point out that even as recently as 1995, Linux
wasn't sufficiently known (or developed?) to compete.  Maybe FreeBSD might have
been a viable option, had it been known (Greg?).
In any event the competition against M$ wasn't there, and M$ has become a de
facto standard.
Nowadays we have 'outsourceing' whereby the IT body is charged with the duty of
maintaining the existing system, not introducing a new one.  There is also
little profit for them in providing GNU/Linux or FreeBSD cpw the commissions on
sale of M$ products.
We need to develop some sort of strategy to ovecome the - to us at least -
obvious problem.  Perhaps we might start by a public condemnation of the
outdated system which is costing taxpayers many $$$$ when the cost of open
source, after conversion, would be trivial?  The cost of conversion might not be
very high, either - perhaps someone like Glen could help us quanitify this?
Lets give the situation some more thought and continue the discussion over time?
