&gt; PS: re whoever said TANSTAAFOS (there ain't no such thing as a free OS),
&gt; this is absolutely true. The development of Linux is funded by many
&gt; different groups -- Linux-based companies, other companies doing Linux
&gt; developement, companies employing people who do Linux development,
&gt; Universties, individuals and so on. If they don't get something back for
&gt; their contributions, they will stop. Even an individual hacker needs to eat,
&gt; and will want good computer gear. For him or her to contribute effectively,
&gt; someone has to pay for their food and their computer (and, no doubt, their
&gt; bandwidth). These days though, I imagine that the vast majority of code is
&gt; coming from organisations that are conscious of the fact that their
&gt; developers are writing GPL'd code. This code must give them some sort of
&gt; payback somewhere, otherwise developing it ceases to be profitable, and they
&gt; stop developing. This is why, if you read /., you should click on the
&gt; advertisers once in a while, and occasionally buy something from that
&gt; clickthrough... This is how /. (and others) make their money, and if the
&gt; advertisers are not getting a profit from that advertising, they will stop
&gt; advertising, and /. will lose money, and close... Advertisers don't just
&gt; blindly pay to support a site... Actually, if any organisation supports
&gt; something you like, and you decide to buy something from that organisation,
&gt; you really should make it clear to them that one of the reasons you bought
&gt; from them or noticed them was their advertising on /., or their sponsorship
&gt; of the InstallFest, or the fact that you know that they pay for kernel
&gt; development, or whatever. In reality, the only way that they will continue

Erg!!  I do my best to NOT encourage Advertisers, that's like
swimming in shark infested waters during a feeding frenzy!

(That last should go down well!)
