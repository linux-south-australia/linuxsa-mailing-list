&gt; PLEASE NOTE: I am sending my reply through list, rather than to you
&gt; Richard & CCing the list. This is NOT meant in a personal way, I simply
&gt; see no point in sending (or receiving) two copies of the same message.

ack

&gt; &gt; &gt; Erg!!  I do my best to NOT encourage Advertisers, that's like
&gt; &gt; &gt; swimming in shark infested waters during a feeding frenzy!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; fair enough, but where does the money to run "free" services
&gt; come from? eg
&gt;
&gt; Richard,
&gt;
&gt; Is the service free (to the public) or not? If it is, why do you
&gt; feel the need to emphasise the word free? If it isn't free, why use the
&gt; word at all?

I emphasised it because the services tend to be free to use but not to
provide -- just because it comes to the consumer for no cost, doesn't mean
that no-one is paying for it ever.

&gt; Now, I agree that these services have costs, but if you answer yes to my
&gt; first question above, then that is NOT my problem, nor should it be.

sigh.

&gt; &gt; /.? rid /. of its advertisers, and suddenly it has almost zero
&gt; income, and
&gt; &gt; it ceases to exist.
&gt;
&gt; I doubt it would cease to exist. I'm sure they have other ways to offset
&gt; their costs. Example: Netcraft, don't bombard the email list with
&gt; advertisments, yet so far as I'm aware the list itself is free. After
&gt; having a quick look at the linuxsa webpage, I note that there is very
&gt; little advertising there either. Yet for all of that, linuxsa (and the
&gt; email list) hardly seems to be dissappearing. If anything, it's growing!

ooah wow... Netcraft's main business is in selling their services. Most of
their time goes into that as well. The mailing list is relatively small in
terms of what Netcraft do. I don't think it is valid to compare the effort
Netcraft put into this mailing list to the effort that /. puts into their
site.

&gt; Having said that, just because /. chooses to cover their costs by
&gt; carrying adverts, does not obligate me (or anyone else) to acknowledge
&gt; those advertisers any more than we absolutely have too. If you _choose_
&gt; to do so, that is your right.

sigh. I'm not trying to force anyone into anything. It is your right to wear
a rump steak on your head if you want (<A HREF="http://www.hatsofmeat.com">http://www.hatsofmeat.com</A>). However,
if you use the services of a business, and you want to keep using the
services of that business (for whatever reason) then it is important to you
that that business continues to exist -- otherwise you can't do business
with them. That's why, if you want a regular supplier of computer hardware,
you would choose a profitable supplier rather than one that gets by on
unrealistically slim margins... That's why if you use a free service on the
web that you want to continue to use, you will hope that they continue to
exist, and would consider doing business with those that sponsor that
service.

&gt; One last point before I move on: If a service (free or not - especially
&gt; on the internet) is as good (as you seem to be suggesting /. is) then
&gt; the advertisers will be clammering to be associated with the service for
&gt; the exposure alone.

exposure is no good until someone buys something. I don't see why you don't
get this.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;  I dislike the advertisers, but at least on the internet,
&gt; &gt; they are not intrusive like on TV & radio...
&gt;
&gt; No!? Perhaps you have access to an internet that I don't. There is very

banner ads sit at the top of your screen on a web page that you are looking
at. They do all they can to attract attention away from what you are doing.
TV and Radio ads interrupt your program to give you an ad. I don't see how
you can say that banner ads are not less intrusive than TV and radio ads...

&gt; little about the internet that I think should be regulated, advertising
&gt; would certainly fall into that category though. From curiosity, do you

hmm... I don't see why... what would need regulating, and by whom would it
be regulated?

&gt; use spam filters?

no -- I don't get that much spam, but spam is different from banner ads that
I am referring to (perhaps I didn't make that clear)

&gt; &gt; You do understand by point though, don't you?
&gt;
&gt; Understand: I think so.  Agree: No.

fair enough.

&gt; P.S. To answer my first question myself:-
&gt;
&gt; No. If people have to wade through advertising (especially irrelevant)
&gt; to get the info they are after, then the service is not free.

I think that wading through ads is something you do at porn and mp3 sites.
They are not what I am talking about. I'm referring to /., user friendly,
and so on...
