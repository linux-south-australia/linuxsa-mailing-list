James!

&gt;     Where is the best place for somone to get training in the sysadmin side of
&gt; things, particulary unix and linux?? where did you all get qualifications?

Try looking out for:

* <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/">http://www.iit-training.com.au/</A>

They run "Hands On Linux Courses". I think its current presenter/tutor
is Richard Sharpe (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:sharpe@ns.aus.com">sharpe@ns.aus.com</A>) and I know he's led a
number of these courses in the past.

&gt; i want to be a sysadmin later in life, what course(es) do you all reccomend?

I didn't do any courses. In fact, I decided I'd start a B.Info Tech at
Flinders and ended up telling the tutors how to fix the problems that
occurred in my first tutorial.

&gt; i am doing diploma IT at tafe, and it is boring. virtually no linux any where.
&gt; are thier any current sysadmins here?

A good many of us are. If you have no money at all (which being a
student is probably the case), I'd just suggest setting up a little
network at home and tinkering. Take a look at various job descriptions
(start at <A HREF="http://www.linux.org.au/">http://www.linux.org.au/</A> who have a job section) and see what
you would need to know and teach yourself...

We'll help you, even when your computer crashes, you have to use Outlook
and forget to change the HTML settings (1)...

&gt; i an not wanting to do computer science, i have heard it is VERY mathematical,
&gt; of  which i am not...!

Have you actually looked at a syllabus? If you get into real multi-media
programming, graphics and a host of other applications, having a good
grounding in theoretical mathematics is almost imperative. By "real" I
mean not the "use the gimp - create graphics", I mean "create graphical
applications using some prog. language"...
