&gt; &gt; So why does the marketplace have the impression that "the point of ADSL"
&gt; &gt; is to provide a technology which will permit you to download CD images
in
&gt; &gt; the blink of an eye for free?
&gt;
&gt; I don't think that consumers really want ADSL.  What they do
&gt; want is a cheap, broadband, routed, always-on Internet.
&gt; That is, a "real" Internet service.

Besides the cheap bit, isnt that what ADSL is??
Yes, its fast, always connected, convinent, avaliable to almost everyone...
What else could I possibly want out of an internet connection??

I guess ADSL is almost a "quick fix" for Australia and its low-end broadband
but what else do we really need (besides more ADSL competition and cheaper
prices) ??

&gt; They have been told by some ISPs and some Ministers of the Crown
&gt; that ADSL is such a real Internet service.  You can't blame
&gt; consumers for believing what they read.
&gt;
&gt; IMHO ADSL is an interim technology until Australian society bites
&gt; the bullet of constructing an optical local loop.  Note that
&gt; the costs of this are not large by state or local government
&gt; standards, perhaps less than has been spent on AFL and soccer
&gt; sporting stadia in the last few years.

But really... what are the advantages of doing this over ADSL??
It would cost a lot to install, a lot to run, a lot for the home user...
Yes, it would be faster, but why would a home user want any more speed than
what ADSL can offer at lower prices??
