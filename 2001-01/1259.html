&gt; The online registration payment page at <A HREF="http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/">http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/</A>
&gt; downright refuses to let you in if you're running linux, your browser
&gt; must tell their server that it's running MacOS or windows. 
&gt; 
&gt; The government's defence for this is that the site is in beta, and they
&gt; can't possibly be expected to support all OS's. Oddly enough, this site
&gt; has been in 'beta' for nearly 3 years now. Ecommerce sites everywhere
&gt; else work with most browsers, leave it up to the powers-that-be to
&gt; choose a system that relies on a specific OS..
&gt; 
&gt; To rub salt into the wound, the error page
&gt; (<A HREF="http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/Ecomm/BadBrows.html">http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/Ecomm/BadBrows.html</A>) tells me to 'upgrade'
&gt; my operating system to suit their site..
&gt; 

This sounds like an issue it is worth taking up in a formal manner.
It sounds like an equity of access issue.

To me it is like sayng you can only pay for you regirstraion(other govt
service) using a State Bank Visa or CBA Mastercard.

If I get no objections I am going to forward the emails of this thread to
a guy I know from uni who is a young libber and is runnign for
preselction in Adelaide.

He is employed as a web developer so he should understand the issues.
He is a bit of a linux/be person too, so he will probably be sympathetuc.

I think this woudl work well for us, because he is in the lib party, and
arily active, and he woudlbe mortivated to address the issue, because it
gives him mmo for his preselections.

I also suspect that he might at least have some contact with armitage,
though I am nto sure to waht extent, presuambly they are in the smae
branch as he is runnign for the smae seat in preselection.

Any objections from any of the posters to me forwarding their email to
him?

Please forgive the positng of his url, I am not for or against him, but if
he were to be elected I think it woudl be reasonable to assume he woudl be
the most IT savvy MP in .au, as well as posiibly a very linux freindly
one. I do think that.

His url is www.turnerforadelaide.com.

Some of you probably know him.
I suspect he did attend some linuxsa meetings.

I would encourage any one who has IT/Govt related iusues to take them up
with him.

Eg the people that were talking about a submission far linux in
schools/education.

I suspect the same synergy as descirbed above (Ie we want action, he wants
ammo) might be useful.
