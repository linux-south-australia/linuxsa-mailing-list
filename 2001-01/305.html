sorry,sorry,sorry
The linux distro should read MD7.2 (not RH7.2)
the 2.4.0 kernel was booting fine using Grub.(I compiled it myself)
It was only after I changed to lilo that the prob started.

That's what happens when you send e-mails at 4:30 it the morning.

&gt; Matthew!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Morning Guys & Gals
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Firstly, I hope this comes out in plain text 'cos I'm writing in Outlook
&gt; &gt; 2000
&gt;
&gt; &lt;self musing&gt;
&gt; * he's politically correct
&gt; * he makes an effort to get Outlook 2000 to speak text
&gt; * perhaps the people (and I must confess, I use the term with the
&gt; greatest advice) who can't get Outlook 2000 to speak test after system
&gt; crashs might take notice
&gt; &lt;/self musing&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Reinstalled my Linux onto my main HDD tonight(dual boot with win 98) -
&gt; &gt; instead of the having it on old one that was hanging in my PC
&gt;
&gt; Should I ask whether you backed up any important data before you did
&gt; this :-?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; noticed that my drive is set to slave but didn't think much of it at the
&gt; &gt; time.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; then played around for a while and decided to change my boot loader over
to
&gt; &gt; lilo [on Linux 2.4.0]
&gt; &gt; booted RH7.2 cd & typed rescue
&gt;
&gt; So you've installed a "dot zero" kernel onto a "dot zero" RedHat system.
&gt; Exactly how did you install 2.4.0? I hope you used an RPM created by
&gt; RedHat itself because it's s-gcc (stuffed GCC) 2.96 is, well, not
&gt; guaranteed to work.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; any help would be appreciated
&gt;
&gt; Doing a quick search at <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A> for "RedHat 7.0 grub"
&gt; (without the parenthesis) comes up with bits and pieces and I'd surmise,
&gt; but that it's some kind of module loader or thing. If you have the
&gt; space, I think the safest way to recover would be:
&gt;
&gt; * Install RedHat 6.2/Debian (or whatever just NOT RedHat 7.0) onto a
&gt; totally separate partition
&gt;  - the separate partition doesn't have to be large
&gt;
&gt; * Mount the RedHat 7.0 partitions from that installation
&gt;
&gt; * Get the data you really need from it
&gt;
&gt; And forget about using RedHat 7.0 until RedHat 7.1.
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, it's been noted that RedHat have gone quiet on the updates
&gt; and that this is usually indicative of a new release, or bugfix release
&gt; about to appear (within three to four weeks - kinda like Linux 2.4.0
&gt; which was always about to appear)...
&gt;

&gt; The hate stands ready...
&gt;  Send forth your terror into HELL!
