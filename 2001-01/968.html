Hiya list,

I've got a job coming up in a couple of months where I'll be in Europe
for 7 or 8 weeks, but will be in a different town each day, and in any
one country for only a couple of consecutive days. I'm trying to find
the best solution for being able to connect to the net while I'm there
that won't cost me all of my earnings. Hotel phone costs can be quite
daunting - in the past I've come across charges that are more than 4X
the normal rate - so toll free connections would be most desirable
(though some hotels even charge for these)

I've had a brief look at using GRIC through Internode but at $6.60/hour
before phone costs I was hoping some of you jet-setters may have a
better solution. The astronomical number of ISPs in Europe makes it
difficult to look into them all - I'd still be going through the A's by
the time I left!

Hope someone can help?

Cheers,
michael.
