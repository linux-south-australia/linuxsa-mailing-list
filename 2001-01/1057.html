even if you do include music, which (i hear:) averages about 4 megs a piece,
500 mbs is still a hellovalot.  'a porn addict' as someone else put it
would also have to be a complete w#nker (get it?:) to download 500 megs of
it a month, sheesh, a one megabyte jpeg is a bloody detailed and big picture.

perhaps we are really talking about software pirates here, if you were
downloading images of cd-roms, _then_ you'd exceed the 500mb i guess.

&gt; How about 750 Mb/Mth?
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming we're talking about a modem, frankly, 500Mb is typically 
&gt; 'enough' (and our dialup accounts don't currently run on a 500 Mb 
&gt; limit, our 'flat rate' option is 250 Mb included) but I've been 
&gt; thinking over the merits of raising it -somewhat- as the compromise 
&gt; to solve that previously discussed issue (how to avoid -most- people 
&gt; seeing an excess bill -most- of the time).
&gt; 
&gt; Frankly, a modem is good for about 10 MB's an hour flat out - so 
&gt; you're saying that 'anyone' could easily spend &gt; 50 hours per month 
&gt; running their modem flat out downloading stuff - not casually 
&gt; surfing, but balls-to-the-wall downloading - but without downloading 
&gt; games or music or the like? Something in that scenario doesn't 
&gt; wash...!
&gt; 
&gt; i.e. lets postulate that such a 'typical' person logs in 5 nights out 
&gt; of 7 (say 20 nights per month), that's the equivalent of about 2.5 
&gt; hours downloading flat out, or (say) 5 hours downloading at a 50% 
&gt; duty cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; Not much of a social life in there, eh? Then again, perhaps members 
&gt; of this list are a-typical in respect of their pursuit of a social 
&gt; life :) :)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon

&gt; &gt;  &gt; The true loss leader is the Dingo Blue $25 account, no argument

&gt; &gt;  &gt; If you can make hay in the meantime, good luck to you (modulo your
&gt; &gt;  &gt; guilt factor supporting random unknown multinationals rather than
&gt; &gt;  &gt; happy local businesses :) )
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;My concious suitably knowing at me, man I feel like a crook ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Actually I had intended to finish on my last note, but you seemed sincere in
&gt; &gt;getting feedback on the price structure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Sure I'd like to use a local business, internode would be great, now the need:
&gt; &gt;Price you have set, fine
&gt; &gt;Service you provide, great
&gt; &gt;Local business super.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;DOWNLOAD ....l 500mb nope sorry. I do not d/l games, music or the like, but
&gt; &gt;anyone could very easily run over 500.  To be realistic 1000mb would cover me
&gt; &gt;and then some, my kids could play games I could update my progs and surf
&gt; &gt;without fear of extra costs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If you raised the mb I could live comfortably with everything else.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Best wishes
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And its good to have you contributing to the list
