&gt; Oi!
&gt;
&gt; You can talk :-P
&gt;
&gt; DL
&gt;

Down to some details (citated from BIND 8 man page):

1. auth-nxdomain
       If yes, then the AA bit is always set on NXDOMAIN responses, even if
       the server is not actually authoritative.  The default is yes. Do not
       turn off auth-nxdomain unless you are sure you know what you are
doing,
       as some older software won't like it.

So you will get "authoritative" answers from your forwarder for zones which
not expired yet (i.e. zones which you can query and get reply wihtout of
NODATA bit in NXDOMAIN response)

2. forward
       This option is only meaningful if the forwarders list is not empty.
A
       value of first, the default, causes the server to query the
forwarders
       first, and if that doesn't answer the question the server will then
       look for the answer itself.  If only is specified, the server will
only
       query the forwarders.

Because your forwarder tends to answer question and will say that it's
"authoritative" (until zone present) your BIND will think that's everything
is OK because only way to check the truth - DIY. But your BIND will not do
it because it got good reply from your forwarder and he happy with it.

Note: I know that it works this way only in BIND 8 - BIND 4 don't have
NXDOMAIN (and no AA bit :) at all and thus he will always will get
"non-authoritative" on zone problems. So make sure that you have BIND 8 and
your forwarder too.

Satisfied and convinced? :)

Regards,
Vladimir
