&gt; &gt; Firstly usign gnome does not actually get much work done.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a framework that is familiar to people who are used to any GUI
&gt; style operating system.

Yes btu the problem is there are not many good applications that are
typically useful for everyday tasks and easy to use.


I work at an organisaiton that I woudl say is quite open source
orientated.
I do most of my workd using open source tools.

However we ahve not found a satisfactory open source word processor tha we
are all happy with.
And we are geeks who can typcially use advanced tools.

So great gone is as usable as windows, the problem is you cant acutlaly do
much useful with gone.
You cant word process a docuemnt.
Youc ant fdo page layout.

Unless perhaps you think grade 5s(and their teachers) might use troff or
latex.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Moving fiel a to directory x sinto in itslef all taht useful ona day to
&gt; &gt; day basis teaching say  geography, english, art  or history.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree, however, my point was that it's not a totally unfamiliar thing
&gt; for point-and-click people to use...

No its not.
But there are no applciation that are as slick, which is thepopint I was
trying to make.

 
&gt; &gt; As alluded to I actually know quite a few  teachers persoanlly, and ahve
&gt; &gt; acctually worked in s=chools which on the face of it shoudla vhe extremely
&gt; &gt; ocomputer literate staff and students - but haven't.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't, actually, say something that was contrary to what you said. I
&gt; said that someone familiar with, say, Windows wouldn't find something
&gt; GNOME/KDE based totally unfamiliar.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes so what make it harder?
&gt; 
&gt; You assume that it is harder.

Yes similar but not the same.
A lot of peopel know how to do stuff by rote.
Not a good way to know something but at leasty tehy know and can do
whatever task it is.
eg "go to windows buttoon, choose programs, choose accessories, choose
notepad"

Gnome would break that.
But qth is not really here nor there they can learn gnome by rote too.

What woudl make it harder is the lack of useful quality apps in the
appropraite problem domains and the lack of widespread kowledge of teh
platform in general.

 
&gt; &gt; Oh it may well happen but onlyu afer wider acceptance inthe genral
&gt; &gt; community in particualr, business, tertiay education institutions and
&gt; &gt; maybe gonverment.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Until then I cant see it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Simply not enough motiviation or support/trained personel.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From my, perhaps our perspective, the less trained people there are the
&gt; more competition for our services, so our contracting fees/salary/wages
&gt; are artifically higher. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is that such a bad thing?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes.
&gt; 
&gt; Having a basis of knowledge not based around computers is important too.

Indeed. That is my point.,
Most computer usage in schools is in support of some other topic.
They are not typcially used ot teach computing concepts, but to prepare
work/research owrk for otehr topics.


&gt; &gt; Stability tends not the be the issue, it is complexity/and or a total lack
&gt; &gt; of interest.
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, a GNOME desktop is no more complex than a Windows
&gt; desktop. As for a lack of interest, there's an old English saying: "You
&gt; can lead a horse to water, show the horse where it is. But you can't
&gt; make the horse drink..."

No it is not.
But configuring the underlying sytem is quite complex.

&gt; &gt; Which is not likely to be forthcoming. As it is not now.
&gt; 
&gt; Which we could have the opportunity to change.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What is it you actually think 8 years odls do with computers? or 10 years
&gt; &gt; olds, or 5 year olds?
&gt; 
&gt; Use them. Learn on them. Play educational games (for want of a better
&gt; description)...I certainly was on commodore 64's. I remember learning
&gt; "Bank Street Writer"...actually quite a good word processor :-)

Not anymore.
Sure they do that occasioanly.
But they do much more these days.
They word process, edit video, create mutlimedia documents, ie embedded
movies, urls, images, text sound etc.
Yes 8 year olds.
 
I have not even been able to digtise video under linux as yet and I am
fairly techincially savvy and reasonably au fait as a linux user.

&gt; &gt; But for a 7 year old? With a techer who can only just change defautl fonts
&gt; &gt; in word who ahs taken 2 years to get to that point and is not actaully
&gt; &gt; that interested or encourraged to be interested anyway?
&gt; 
&gt; I can actually see your point. I'm not sure, though, whether it
&gt; justifies doing nothing about it...


I have at no point said "do nothign about it".
I have said that at this point in time there are not sufficent quality
open source applciations to replace  close source apps and that inmay
cases an open source OS woudl provide no advantage and probably make life
genraly more difficult for those treachers who ahve botehred and made the
effort to learn thte toosl they ahve been given.

I ahve also said that for older stuendents learnign computer sciene type
topics open source OS and open source sogtware generally would be ideal.

&gt; &gt; Yes but it is oen that is not likelly to be resolved.
&gt; &gt; Realistically, no. I can't say this, or any other Government in
&gt; Australia actually understanding that training is not a cost - it's
&gt; adding value.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; cant lose their job for 2 years. Ie teh support tehy get is basically from
&gt; &gt; create a job to reduce unemployment statistics type schemes.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I know. Never mind the best person for the job system...

Exacltly.
And sadly the peopl they are "forced" to employ  are trained at tafe
largely if not exclusviely in windows platforms.

&gt; &gt; But you dant want to offer support, you want to offer conversion.
&gt; &gt; Ie you will help but only if they adopt your "religion".
&gt; 
&gt; Did I say conversion? Didn't I mention that it would be useful to have
&gt; experience of many operating systems? It's early in the morning - maybe
&gt; I can't remember what I said.

No you did not explicitly say "conversion" I was paraphrasing my
understanding of the gist of what you were saying.
 
&gt; &gt; You are off your rocker. They dont now what tcp/ip is and dont care, that
&gt; &gt; is not what they need in the classrom generally - well it is not what they
&gt; &gt; need most.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, my point was that this group has a lot of expertise in general
&gt; computing areas, and that we could make use of this expertise by
&gt; providing knowledge on points that teachers do want and need to know. It
&gt; was easiest to point at the technical side because we talk about a lot
&gt; of technical issues, but we have people who make presentations, people
&gt; who are teachers or have taught in schools before. So much talent...


And that woudlbe great if we did not evangalise and tell tehm what was
wrong and how it coudl eb replaced. If we just offered them help in the
areas they wanted and lef tit at that.

&gt; &gt; But they dont need to learn every oS under the sun. 
&gt; &gt; They probably dont want to, they get ocnfuesed enough with one.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you should work for Microsoft...

Why?

Thisis nto a microsoft issue.

We(the open source community) have to accept that like microsoft and
all other software companies(greoups?? organisations??)
there are shortcomings in the software we use/write/advocate and "market
niches" that open source does not effectively cover right now. Nd there
are users who at this point will probably find our software very difficult
to use. 
Not to say that it wont in the future. Not to say that it cant. Just that
it does not right now.

Part of being an adult is seeing the world as it is,not how we want it to
be.

Sure you can have visions and hopes, but you stillahve to accept today as
today.

&gt; &gt; Like I said so they abandon years of hard earned "skills" just to make a
&gt; &gt; few hundred linuxsa people happy?
&gt; 
&gt; Some people on this list have chosen to do that. You know very well they
&gt; have...some people won't and/or don't. Others just don't have a choice.

And for some situations it is not a practical choice.

&gt; &gt; They abandon the collective work of their students because theise
&gt; &gt; prodiucts typcially do nto falwlessy import word docs,a dn they learn an
&gt; &gt; entirly new os/interface adn applcaiiton just to do what they already do
&gt; &gt; with (typically) lesser tools?
&gt; 
&gt; Did I say use Linux only? You are saying use Microsoft tools only. I am
&gt; saying give people a choice.

I did not say use MS toosl only.
I suspect you probaaly ought to read my messages.
I did use a lto of MS appplcaitiosn as examples, because they are very
widely used, bothin schools and in teh wider community.
I dont recall ever sayignuse only MS tools.

I advocate usignthe best fitting tools for the job.

&gt; &gt; How about we few hundred  abandon(temporarily for
&gt; &gt; the period we commit ourselves to help) our deals and go and help out with
&gt; &gt; teaching/supporting them in/de mystifying them whatever it si they already
&gt; &gt; have?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I think you meant IDEALS.

Very perceptive. I do indeed mean ideals.
 
&gt; &gt; I dont use many MS products, I use linux most of the day every work day.
&gt; 
&gt; I was using "you" in the sense of "one". I think that you, Jason, have
&gt; mistaken my usage.
 
&gt; &gt; Yes but sometimes you have to work in smaller increments.
&gt; &gt; Over greater time periods.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, starting a dialogue with those who set policy now - which is all I
&gt; essentially was suggesting - is a small step. I don't think that you
&gt; want to, or are willing even, to do so. I might be - and I probably am -
&gt; wrong. In fact, I sincerely hope I am...personally I don't see the "it's
&gt; too difficult" as a valid argument. Nor do I see the "but we've already
&gt; learned skills in [whatever] so why make change" as a valid argument.

I dont think you wnat to  but amproably wrong, sort of emans you think I
do wnat to.

I ahve nto said and do not intend to imply that dialogue shoudl nto be
statrted.
Ia m sayign that we shoudl eb careful not to
push one solution onto schools, the way many of us think that ms have.
 
I am also sayign that we ahve to accpet that there are reas where open
source is nto the best solutuon and we need to be willignto accept that if
we are to present a fair case.

&gt; Every operating system, program and utility has its place. I think the
&gt; whole summary of this thread could be that we do not desire it so that
&gt; our students only learn a single, closed source operating system
&gt; because:

Most use of computers in shcool is not about teaching an OS or an
applcaiton it is about teching some otehr topic.

The computer is merely a tool used in some aspect of that teaching,
whether it be research or whether it be preparation/presentation of
information.

In this context it actaully makes sense to use one set of tools, so that
the teaching can concentrate on the topic matter, not onthe tools.

Ie in a geopgraphy lesson the students and teachers shoudl spend most of
their time thinking about geography, not thinking about how to get this
image ofa map onto that docuemnt.

Familar easy to use tools  means the students adn teachers spend less time
thinking about the tools and more time thinking about the base topic.

&gt; * technology and even Windows changes

Your point being?

&gt; * basing knowledge on sound theoretical concepts as opposed to
&gt; "hands-on" point and clicks can be more effective

One of the big points I am trygnto make is taht geneally computers are
being used to teach computign concpets.
They are being used as tools whiel teaching some completely unrelated
topic.

Teachers typcially dont need to teach baout fiel systems, or the DNS
system, or any other computer related field.


&gt; * in some circumstances, using a foreign OS does not make sense because
&gt; profits and export are sent overseas

So what loal OS woudl you suggest we use.

In any case it is not the OS which is the problem with open source it is
the applciations. More precisely the lack of them.


&gt; DL
&gt; 
&gt; p.s.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm most certainly not off my rocker...but you are definitely off your
&gt; spell checker ;-P
&gt; 

Bad news for you David. I often notice typos or bad spelling in your
posts, and simply choose to ingore them.
If it would help, I will bring attention to them in the future.
