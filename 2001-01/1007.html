 &gt; 
 &gt; One of the things I learnt in Australian History when I studied it was
 &gt; that consitutions like that of France and the US (which was modelled to
 &gt; some extent the French) explicitly give you a list of rights and
 &gt; everything else is potentially forbidden. Allegedly the .au constitution
 &gt; (which also draws on the French and US constitutions) tries to do things
 &gt; in the opposite way: list what you can't do and everything else is
 &gt; potentially a basic right.
 
Definitely not.

In both the US and Australia, anything which isn't explicitly defined
as illegal in statutes is, by implication, legal.  So if the law doesn't
say you're prohibited from driving a team of Llamas up Main Street behind
an Afghanistani marching band, you're allowed to do it.

I think the law says you can't do that :-)

Where the Australian and US constitutions really differ, though, is that
the US has a Bill of Rights which essentially provides a list of things 
which the Government isn't permitted to make illegal.  So, for example, 
when the First Amendment says, "Congress shall make no law abridging
freedom of speech...", it means that the Government of the day is not
permitted to pass a law of that nature.

In Australia, citizens have no such protection against the excesses of
our Government.  That explains the BSA, which would have been patently
illegal in the US, but which has passed almost without comment in Australia.

Note that the Bill of Rights only binds the Government -- When it says,
"Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech," that doesn't
prevent a consortium of private companies from getting together and
defining a technical standard which removes the potential for freedom
of speech for anyone who happens to use it, nor does it prevent a 
company from entering into a contract with a citizen where the citizen
voluntarily gives up their rights.  That explains DVD encryption, which
prevents DVD material from being excerpted in research, and legally binding
software license agreements where the licensee is prohibited from publishing
any negative reviews of the product without the prior consent of the 
licensor.

 &gt; I don't know that I really think things work that way in practice, but
 &gt; I've always wanted to ask an expert if the constitution is in fact
 &gt; designed like this.

Nope.  Australia's and the US's are similar in the sense of their operation
("everything not explicitly illegal is legal"), except that the US
constitution is equipped with a list of things which may not be made illegal.
