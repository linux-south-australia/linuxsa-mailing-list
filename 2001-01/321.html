Hi all,
this is a new post to this list as I just found it today.  It's good to see
that there is a linux SA site (I used to live in SA but recently moved to
Tassie).  Unfortunately there is no Tassie linux users group that I have
found so far.  Anyway, I'm still a newbie having just escaped from the evil
clutches of the blue screen of death (all I need now is to convince the
others in the family to make the fearful change and I can get rid of the
windoze partition for good).

Now to my question, actually it seems as though  I've got hundreds of them,
but anyway this has to do with star office 5.2.  I downloaded this the other
day on to a zip drive and went to install last night.  I cd'd to the zip
drive and entered the ./setup command only to be informed that this wasn't
found (sorry I cant give the exact messages as I'm at work now). I tried
entering the straight so5_2 etc etc (the file is a bin) and still nothing
happened. I tried everything to no avail.  I then fired up a file manager in
KDE and accidentally clicked on the file. Suddenly I was up and running,
unfortunately it installed at /root as a single user (I think) and I can't
get do a single user set up as another user.  I'm completely stumped as I
can't seem to work out how to do the network install.

Any ideas or hints greatly appreciated, by the way does the fact the file is
listed as so-5_2 blah  blah.bin..bi mean anything??

Thanks
Stan Bordeaux
