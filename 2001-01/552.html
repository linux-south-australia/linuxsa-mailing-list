&gt; This would have the effect of raising the profile of LinuxSA in South

&gt; We will also have to ensure that the meeting is well attended!

I don't know about other members on this list, but I'm not very interested in
attending a LinuxSA meeting where politicians are given the floor.  I'd much
rather hear of a technical overview of Geoffrey's "Katie", or what sort of
thing Dan is trying to do open-source-wise at Tellurian, or what Richard is
planning to do with his Caldera[?]-funded time, or Mark talking about why we
should be using *BSD instead of Linux.  ie something Linuxsy, or open-source
related, not something written by speech writers and presented by a good
talker, which'll be just spin to gain the votes of those attending.

Sure, politics has it's place.  That place may include LinuxSA sometimes.  But
if it does, I'm not very interested.  As per usual, just IMHO.
