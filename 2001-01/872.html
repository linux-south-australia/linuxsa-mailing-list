&gt; One of the hallmarks of the "$25 unlimited" style of plans is that they
&gt; tend to attract people who have a mindset which wants something for nothing.

well that narrows it down to... everyone!  like who says "a free burger? nah,
i'd rather pay!" ??

in my expreiance they attract people who don't want to be surprised by the
occasional $100 bill that is outside their budgets.  everyone (that pays
their bills:) has to budget !
normal 'mum and dad' customers that don't want to learn advanced algebra
just to understand their bill for something they hardly understand anyway.

&gt; one of the common attributes of that mindset is that people who want
&gt; something for nothing don't pay bills very well.

so you're saying that all of us that are on one of these plans are
freeloaders???  that's quite a generalisation!  i can tell you never did psych
or even economics for that matter :)  for a  psych there are probably seven
(just a guess) or so different motivations here, the economist would say
that not wanting something for nothing is totally unnatural and untrue.
are you a commie? (only joking)

&gt; Companies of the calibre of BHP, CBA, etc don't use ISPs who don't have
&gt; a viable business model.

are you telling me that cable and wireless-optus (i gather the former owners
of dingo-blue) don't have a viable business model?  shit don't let the dow
hear about that :)

my point was that multi-national telcos, that own satellites etc. have
bandwidth coming out of there noses and have a
very good idea of what they are doing.  we may not like it, but the
shareholders do, and  they are not blind to the workings of markets, which is
the reason many of them got to own shares in the first place :)

all this stuff is complete opinion, and no research/referencing is being
done here (obviously:) on either part.
