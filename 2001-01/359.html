Hi

There is an faq at the NVidia site that would cover some of your probs. 
depending on your type of video card.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've decided that my recently downloaded, official nVidia drivers (for
&gt; &gt; a Riva TNT2 Ultra) are causing my system to become less stable than it
&gt; &gt; normally is. I suspect that it's speaking very closely to the kernel
&gt; &gt; itself to the extent where a driver compiled against 2.2.17 won't work
&gt; &gt; with Kernel 2.2.18 without a rebuild...
&gt;
&gt; If you run /sbin/lsmod you will see an NVdriver module loaded.  This
&gt; provides card services through /dev/nvidia*
&gt;
&gt; &gt; In and of itself I don't this is particularly unusual, except there's
&gt; &gt; some closed source OpenGLX drivers that I simply can't build and every
&gt; &gt; now and then my system goes bust but only when I'm running X...
&gt;
&gt; Yes, the closed source nVidia drivers seem to be of quite poor quality.
&gt; My development machine has gone from being rebooted every 3 months or so
&gt; (usually due to poorly executed kernel frobbing), to needing a reboot
&gt; every 2-3 days after locking absolutely solid.  It was even worse than
&gt; this until I discovered a few things that seem to have a high
&gt; probability of failure:
&gt;
&gt; 1. If you use xdm, and try to log out after an X session, it appears
&gt; that the restart of the X server that this causes will sometimes lock my
&gt; system solid.  I presume this will be the same with gdm and kdm.  This
&gt; means that I don't log out now.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Recent xlockmores with OpenGL screensavers seem to occasionally crash
&gt; the server also.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Random crashes when running OpenGL programs, especially those that
&gt; exit unexpectedly :)
&gt;
&gt; I am not terribly impressed with the way that nVidia has approached the
&gt; issue of providing 3D/GLX drivers for Linux, although perhaps they do
&gt; deserve some kudos for doing this at all.  Unfortunately, it has been
&gt; some 4 months since the last release.  I guess that perhaps they feel
&gt; that the drivers are currently good enough to meet the "GL on Linux"
&gt; project goals, but unfortunately, they are not *really* good enough for
&gt; everyday use.
&gt;
&gt; I should mention that I also upgraded to XFree86 4.0.1 (from 3.3.6) at
&gt; the same time as installing the GLX drivers, so this may possibly be
&gt; part of the problem.
&gt;
&gt; I have also installed the utah-glx drivers on a separate machine with an
&gt; ATI card.  The drivers seem much more reliable, but the ATI card is not
&gt; as fast as the TNT or as good at rendering textures. Utah-glx also have
&gt; drivers for nVidia Riva cards, which I might also try at some point.
&gt; Utah-glx is at <A HREF="http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net">http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net</A> and runs on XFree86
&gt; 3.3.6.
&gt;
&gt; A recent "Ask Slashdot" article posed the question about which video
&gt; card has the best support under Linux, and there appeared to be a lot of
&gt; supporters for the Matrox G400, although apparently the 3D performance
&gt; wasn't quite up to the grade that nVidia sets.  The article is at
