&gt; * they are relatively easy to install
&gt; * others use them so there's support available
&gt; * they are relatively stable
&gt; * they are generally useful
&gt; * they are general purpose
&gt;
&gt; And the distributions are (in no particular order):
&gt;
&gt; * Mandrake 7.X series
&gt; * Redhat 5.2, 6.2

if easy to install is not a top priority (if you are installing for him, or
are willing to take the opportunity to help him learn about his computer,
then I suggest Debian.

&gt; Corel Linux - which appears to have died - may be worth considering as
&gt; well.

Corel is based on Debian, but is "easier" to use in a windows kind of way...
ie not really easier when it gets down to it, but it looks easier, and if
you don't want to do anything interesting, it is easier... however, IIRC, it
comes without gcc and so on...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I haven't suggested Debian to a newcomer because there's too many side
&gt; notes from respectable people (i.e. not me) that Debian may not be for
&gt; the faint hearted; I'm sure that it could be as easy to use as RedHat or
&gt; Mandrake and I know there are a number of people on list who use it and
&gt; support it so that may be an option too.

yeah, maybe -- depends if you are familiar with debian and/or want to
learn...
