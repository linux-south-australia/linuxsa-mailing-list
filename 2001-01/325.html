Not AARNet, this was something I organised when I worked
for Adelaide University.

The condition that Walnut Creek provide the Adelaide Uni
with free CDs is that they be lent to all that ask.  This
is done through the Help Desk on L7 of 10 Pulteney Street.
The loan period is three days, so it is worthwhile working
out partition sizes, etc before loaning the CDs.  Current
CDs are FreeBSD and Red Hat Linux.

Note that I had an ulterior motive -- to limit the distros
of Linux and BSD in use at the uni so that when IT Services
offered full support for Linux then it would be straight-forward
to implement a "standard" Linux environment (ie: the religious
wars over which distro wouldn't occur and ITS wouldn't be seen as
'forcing' a particular disto on the uni user base).  For this
reason the Help Desk doesn't keep other distros.

My current employer, AARNet, doesn't provide CDs, rather we
provide a large software archive at <A HREF="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/">http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/</A>
