Richard et Richard et al:

&gt; &gt; We should produce a local, SA Linux Manifesto (and I will email
&gt; 
&gt; is this like the UnaBomber's manifesto? hmmm...

Does that have a URL?

&gt; I wonder what it will be for. What, exactly are we manifesting, and why
&gt; would politicians (or rather, the voting public (or whoever people what to
&gt; claim has the power here...) care about it? I think I may also write a Pasta
&gt; Manifesto...

This would be something that we would discuss.

&gt; I assume that is what you are attempting to manifest for -- to get the PS to
&gt; use Linux...

Yes and no. More to get the parties aware that Open Source exists and
that Linux is an excellent and viable example.

&gt; 1) EDS and The Contract. It blows. I think it is up for renegotiation

It's the politicians who sign the contract. It's the people who install
the politicians. I don't feel like tackling the public service from
administration up - I think it would be more effective to tackle the
public service from people - politician - dept. head down...

&gt; 2) Why Linux? In reality, Linux is just one "brand name" that is very
&gt; prominent under the umbrella of Open Source software (and I am not meaning
&gt; to get into an ERS vs RMS Open Source/Free Software debate here, nor a Linux
&gt; vs anything debate...). In my experience, an enormous amount is spent on
&gt; writing custom software -- most likely, more than is spent on proprietry
&gt; commercial software. So there are really two issues here -- use Open Source
&gt; over Proprietry, and release code as Open Source. I believe Matthew Tippett
&gt; did a speil about this at a LinuxSA meeting once.

Well, I agree on this point. But there is an off chance that I'm writing
to a Linux related list...maybe that's reason enough...

&gt; 3) I don't know what a "Manifesto" really is, or why it would have any
&gt; effect on anyone. Why not try a proposal, or a policy or something? I guess
&gt; I'll never be a politician (which is not a bad thing, all things
&gt; considered).

You get the manifesto first, and then lever a policy later. Politics is
the art of the possible. Getting a political party's members (and I'm
talking about a member driven thing here) to accept something that
challenges them will be easier if it is manifested - eg. "That this
State Executive of the ALP endorses the `Open Source Manifesto' as a
basis for Open Source IT in government projects" - is easier than
putting a new policy in.

Policies come later.

&gt; companies). There is already movement towards Open Source generally (in my
&gt; dept, at least, there is a lot of Linux, Apache, and other free software
&gt; being used - unfortunately, we are stuck with Solaris for technical,
&gt; political, contractual and practical reasons, and these will be very very
&gt; hard to change)... AFAIK, DAIS is the department to influence -- I think
&gt; they set the IT policy for the rest of governement... but I could be

Yes, but it's not real. Can you determine, or guess who might be
stopping the various pieces going open source?
