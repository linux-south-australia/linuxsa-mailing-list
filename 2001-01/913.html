&gt; &gt; &gt; like who says "a free burger? nah, i'd rather pay!" ??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually, yes.  I do.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd much rather pay for a good healthy meal at a reputable
&gt; &gt; establishment that I knew was capable of delivering a quality
&gt; &gt; meal at an affordable price.
&gt;
&gt; bollocks again.  ok, what about a free serve of beef wellington
&gt; at the hilton, included with the price you paid for the room.
&gt; would you knock that back, and insist on paying?  sheesh.
&gt;
&gt; what about a free upgrade to business class, because there is a
&gt; spare seat, and the ticketing clerk liked you?

One would have to say that there is somewhat of a difference between a
coupon for a free burger and a meal thrown in when you pay Hilton prices for
a room or get a Frequent Flyer upgrade.

I've given users periods of free access good customers. We're not talking
about people who take a once off free or cheap offer, these are people who
have no loyalty, they do nothing but harm to your business and as soon as a
cheaper deal comes along, their off.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; So these would be the same people who have an unlimited phone
&gt; &gt; account with their telco, oh yes, that's right, that business
&gt; &gt; model doesn't work!  *laff*  wake up.
&gt;
&gt; let me spell it out, and can you all please stop taking this
&gt; so personally, work out the *average* use, how much that costs
&gt; and charge accordingly.

Why should on user pay for someone elses usage, isn't "user pays" the great
catch cry. I'm sorry, but I only want to pay for my usage and not prop up
some porn addict who's downloading GB's a month.

The bottom line is that if you charge $24.95 unlimited, you will lose money,
or you will provide an unacceptably bad service or more likely both.

&gt; please, there is a forrest out there, not just a couple of trees.

Yep, there is a forrest full of people who for some reason have forgotten
some basic rules of economics and there are going to be alot of ISP's
disappearing. World-Link comes to mind, there will be many more.
