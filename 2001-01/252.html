&gt; sorry its late.. am tired but..
&gt;
&gt; TCP is on the transport layer and ICMP is too. but surly TCP is needed  to
&gt; send a ping.  are you sure that ICMP is on the transport layer?

yes, he is sure. Ports are implemented _within_ TCP (& UDP). TCP and UDP
(and ICMP) packets are transported using IP.

Think of it like a phone system. IP is like the number you dial. With TCP
and UDP, it's like you are asking to speak to a particular person (port
number). With ICMP, it's like you are talking to the phone, and hence, don't
need to ask for anyone by name. But you still need the phone number to call
to talk to that phone (you still need the IP transport packet).

so: IP can contain TCP, UDP or ICMP (and others). TCP and UDP implement
ports. ICMP doesn't. Note that all ports are is a mechanism for telling a
particular program to deal with a particular packet. Send a packet to TCP
port 80, and it goes to `httpd`. Send a packet to UDP port 69, and it goes
to `tftpd`. If you have a telnet session set up, it will be listening on a
random tcp port &gt; 1024 -- that is how packets meant for it, as opposed to
any other telnet session, are identified. There is no `pingd`. No program
needs to be identified to run it. It's an _essential_ part of any TCP/IP
stack (TCP/IP includes the entire suite of protocols -- IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP
and so on). So, the networking software itself responds to the ICMP packets.
There is no need for ports. It's just like talking to the telephone itself.
BUT, just like with TCP and UDP, you still need the IP layer to get you to
the correct computer in the first place.

seriously, go get some sleep, then go and buy that book I mentioned. :)
