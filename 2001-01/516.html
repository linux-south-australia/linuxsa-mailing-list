Hmmm..

Just for information's sake I had a conversation via ICQ with the person
who has apparently left the list where the gist of what I said was that
the list isn't always this angry, there is always going to be someone
who writes or speaks in a fashion that you don't like, that this is a
small flame ware (not that I think it was anyway) and finally I said:

"I am talking to you because I do actually believe you can receive a lot
of help from the LinuxSA mailing list. Maybe not from me, but there are
others there. If you want me to go silent I shall..."

After a period of silence I assumed this person had started to ignore me
so I removed him from my icq list but I kept my history of the
conversation because I had the sneaking suspicion it wasn't going to be
quite so clean cut. I received more messages from this person, and to
quote one of them:

"good now remove me from your visable list
or i will packet your arse"

To which I replied:

"Look. I can't see you until you message me. Can you explain what it is
you want? If you want to remove ME from YOUR visible list, then you do
that from your end."

For those of you who use ICQ, to make someone go invisible you can:

* ignore them - option from a menu
* remove them completely

Because I had already removed the person I was unclear what the person
wanted.

For posterity's sake the md5sum under RedHat 6.2's unmodified version of
md5sum of this conversation is:

[<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@hdcp1">lloy0076@hdcp1</A> history]$ md5sum 66163269.db 
72908f42431b787d706a4469ad23768a  66163269.db

I have no idea what it is today, but first I am accused of being stupid
and then I get the impotent script kiddie threat...I should hope I never
have to use that particular md5sum, but it's going to be archived. Right
now.
