&gt; &gt; IBM, arguably make the "better" hard drives you can get. Seagates

&gt;
&gt; Are you absoultely sure you're talking about SCSI and not IDE? As far
&gt; as IDE and Segate goes, I wouldn't really know, but I can vouch for
&gt; the Segate barracuda and cheeta SCSI range, especially the cheeta.
&gt; I've got more systems than I care to remember running with segate
&gt; cheetas and the main reason I can't remember how many there are is
&gt; cause none of them have had any problems. And they are fast. VERY
&gt; fast.

On the segate SCSI thing, we had many systems running seagate 4gb drives,
and almost all of the drives failed within a month of the 3 year
warranty... It was on the get a new disk side of the magic date, but it
was still pretty annoying. They also got _really_ hot.
