Let me say that I was not suggesting that we should get all three parties
on together.

While it is a bigger committment of people's time, I think it would be more
effective to:

1. Invite the appropriate person from each for separate meetings. We could
perhaps ignore the Democats as being irrelevant to politics.

2. Let each side know that the other side is being invited to speak

3. Ensure that we get a good rollout, and try to get some 'industry
leaders' along to say that there is real use of Linux and FreeBSD out
there, and the pollies damn-well better listen to us.

This, however, ignores the fact that the bureaucrats can and do frustrate
any political instructions that come down, so we really should factor them
in here somewhere as well. 

My impression is that there is an influential faction within the government
that seems to believe that anything invented in Australia is second rate.
For example, I know of two agencies that have asked for Samba to be
supported. They have been knocked back, despite it being an Australian
developed product and that there are people in SA who know lots about Samba.

&gt;Richard!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; We should also ask for a speaker from Labour and the Democrats ...
&gt;
&gt;That is a good point but I was attempting to avoid this particular
&gt;meeting becoming a political discussion point, hence I chose to invite
&gt;the Hon. Dr. Armitage in his capacity of Minister of the Crown, not
&gt;member of the Liberal party.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; This would have the effect of raising the profile of LinuxSA in South
&gt;&gt; Australia so that politicians understand that we are interested in what is
&gt;&gt; happening, and that we vote and that we care.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, what you have suggested is also an excellent idea;
&gt;for once I can equally support both ideas but will say that getting a
&gt;spokesman for all three parties at the same meeting, on a set date could
&gt;be a timetabling nightmare. However, the wonderful thing about not
&gt;having a committee is that once a decision to do something is made we
&gt;can duck for cover and stare aimlessly in Geoffrey's general direction
&gt;;-P
&gt;
&gt;Mind you, I'd be willing to attempt to coordinate something if that's
&gt;what people wanted.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; We will also have to ensure that the meeting is well attended!
&gt;
&gt;Yes.

&gt;You have a deformed comb,
