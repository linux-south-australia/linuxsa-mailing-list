Totally agree with you Richard, I've caught this thread a bit late, but as
you say, it's the fault of those in government who signed The Contract in
the first place.
EDS are only doing what any other red-blooded company would do in the same
situation.  Its not their fault that we have 'technologically challenged'
people negotiating IT contracts for the government.
I've seen it many times since I've been working in government where
excellent technical solutions are knocked back simply because of policy.  In
some cases these solutions have been checked by EDS technical staff &
unofficially endorsed, by them, need I say more!  
Still..............the penguin is still infiltrating our networks, good
"policy" or not. ; - )  I believe in providing the most practical &
cost-effective technical solution, not the best solution possible that a
Microsoft product can provide.  If a MS product can do that, well & good,
but I havent seen too many cases where their products have been used purely
because they're the best for the job.
Footnote to this, about 12 months ago some EDS ppl (not techs) were
referring to Linux as a toy, I'm not sure if they still hold the same
opinion.  Some ppl in the Department (again, not techs) have asked why would
we want to use "shareware" products instead of MS products.
"Technologically challenged" is the polite way to refer to these people!!

(Note: these are my personal opinions only & in no way reflect the policies
of those I work for)

		&gt; 1) EDS and The Contract. It blows. I think it is up for
renegotiation

		Note that what I said here is mainly the fault of The
Contract, and those
		who signed it, not EDS, who are just serving the interests
of their
		shareholders within the confines of the contract.
