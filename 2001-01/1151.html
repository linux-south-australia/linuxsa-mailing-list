seems to be some confusion here -- the info2you web/sms gateway is a
separate entity to the sms.optusnet.com.au email/sms gateway... see below
for more clarification...

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is as close as I could find from optus for the
&gt; sms.optusnet.com.au
&gt; &gt; &gt; email gateway.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; From Optus' website
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.cwo.com.au/newsroom/1,1450,235,00.html">http://www.cwo.com.au/newsroom/1,1450,235,00.html</A>)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Web SMS will normally cost 20 cents per message received, per
&gt; &gt; &gt; recipient.  For those quick off the mark, Optus will be
&gt; giving away 200
&gt; &gt; &gt; Web SMS per month free to customers until the end of January 2001."

to send a message from this WEBsite, you need to log in, using your mobile
number and a password they sms to you.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So this means "we will foist extra charges upon you for something you
&gt; &gt; can't possibly have any control over and didn't ask for, short of
&gt; &gt; disconnecting from your contracted service".

no -- you need the password, hence you who control the password control the
costs. Also, the charges are charged to the _sender_, not the receiver, just
as with normal SMSs.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The TIO will be working overtime when sms spam victims get
&gt; their bills in
&gt; &gt; March.. maybe we'll even see some spammers end up in court due to the
&gt; &gt; easily quantifiable damages costs.
&gt;
&gt; I sincerely hope, and highly doubt, that the charge would be incurred by
&gt; the recipient of the message.  They would be bloody idiots if
&gt; that were the
&gt; case - it's trivial to send multiple email messages to a single
&gt; address, so
&gt; if I was nasty, used a public access terminal, etc etc - no.

The email service is different... I can't see how they could charge the
receiver, and it's impossible to link the sender with anything, so it must
be a free service... All I can say is that I don't want SMS spam, no matter
who's paying for it... However, I can't find any info on the optus website
regarding this service... it seems as if it's a recipe for disaster,
particularly as there seems to be no obvious way to disable it...

&gt; Someone want to confirm this with Optus?  :)

hmm... anyone?

I'm not near linuxsa email in business hours, otherwise I would ;)
