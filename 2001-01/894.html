&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the hallmarks of the "$25 unlimited" style of plans
&gt; &gt; &gt; is that they tend to attract people who have a mindset which
&gt; &gt; &gt; wants something for nothing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; well that narrows it down to... everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; Bzzt, wrong.

bollocks.

&gt; &gt; like who says "a free burger? nah, i'd rather pay!" ??
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, yes.  I do.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd much rather pay for a good healthy meal at a reputable
&gt; establishment that I knew was capable of delivering a quality
&gt; meal at an affordable price.

bollocks again.  ok, what about a free serve of beef wellington
at the hilton, included with the price you paid for the room.
would you knock that back, and insist on paying?  sheesh.
 
what about a free upgrade to business class, because there is a
spare seat, and the ticketing clerk liked you?

the rule of tanstaafl (there aint no such thing as a free lunch)
is fundamental economics, *someone* ends up paying, if not only
the environment, only those determined to be terminally poor
try to ensure it will be them paying :)

&gt; So these would be the same people who have an unlimited phone
&gt; account with their telco, oh yes, that's right, that business
&gt; model doesn't work!  *laff*  wake up.

let me spell it out, and can you all please stop taking this
so personally, work out the *average* use, how much that costs
and charge accordingly.

&gt; So why did they sell it?

how would i know? :)

business i guess, doesn't mean they're going the way of eisa though.

when the state bank collapsed (as did the rural and industrial in perth)
due to corrupt/incompetant directors, people in the banking industry
didn't run around saying "oh god, the directors of westpac must be
incompetant too!"

please, there is a forrest out there, not just a couple of trees.
