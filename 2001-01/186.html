&gt; Here's a way to reduce costs at a bank:

the link does actually state that cost was not the promary reason for
switching...

--------
Linux Online:: Was cost the primary reason involved in deciding to deploy
Linux in your ATMs?

Wagner/Bueno: Technically, no. We were using MS-DOS, an operating system
which could no longer fulfill our needs. An option was MS-Windows, but this
would have forced us to re-write a good part of our existing programs - not
to mention the cost of licenses for MS-Windows in each of the two thousand
ATMs. MS-Windows requires more frequent CPU upgrades than Linux does. This
is due to Linux's greater efficiency compared with other 32 bit operating
systems.
--------

anyway, whatever (he appears to be saying "technically no.", and then goes
on to say that the main reason was cost (of rewriting apps, upgrading
hardware, etc)... weird... :)

&gt;
&gt; In addition it appears the government has instructed the bank to replace
&gt; all closed source software with open source software as soon as is
&gt; practicable...if only our (stupid Liberal) government had the same idea.

sigh.

Guess we should have voted for National Action^W^WOne Nation.

Aynway... I'm really quite surprised that ATMs use MSDOS (or windows or
linux or anything really...) I don't know what I thought they'd be using (I
guess they have to use something) but I sort of assumed that whatever it
was, it would be somethign very proprietry and odd, like an NCR-specific
unix or something... I was also suprised at the implication that ATMs use
intel hardware... Again, I expected something obscure... Does anyone know
what software and hardware combination our Australian ATMs tend to use? Has
anyone ever seen an ATM BSOD? :)
