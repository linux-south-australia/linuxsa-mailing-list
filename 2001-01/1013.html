I think Gilmore keeps misrepresenting the nature of licensed material.  For
example, when he says,

    "Even if [consumers] have purchased the movie, and it's stored at home
on their own eqiupment, and they have high bandwidth access to it from
wherever they are."

he implies that sometimes publishers sell movies.  Perhaps some do, but
seldom.  I know of no movies sold by a publisher.  Dare I say that they
always licence the material?  The difference between buying and licensing is
that if I buy a movie it becomes mine to do what I like with.  As a
licensee, however, I am merely permitted access to the material under the
very strict conditions imposed by the owner (the studio.)  Naturally I don't
have to agree to those conditions, just as the studio doesn't have to grant
me a license.

Were I a studio I would factor media degradation into the licence fee.  I
certainly would not permit somebody to store the media in a carefully
conrolled environment while simultaneously enjoying access to that media in
their hot, dusty, bouncy car.  I would expect the licensee to take the media
with them in that nasty environment.

Were I a studio I might refuse to license the material to you until after it
had played in your local cinema.  Feeble though it may be, region coding of
DVDs is intended to provide a control over that.  (It also is intended to
provide control over local censorship issues.)

While sympathising with most of Gilmore's position, indeed while sharing his
very real fears and concerns over CPRM, I do wish he could treat other
people's intellectual property in a less cavalier manner.
