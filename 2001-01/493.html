Mick,

&gt; I have been stuffing around with ipchains HOW-TO and so forth for
&gt; quite some time now like some of you's. I was wondering if anyone
&gt; could possably help me. AGAIN! Im Sorry :( . I wanted to have a
&gt; ipchains -l kinda thing . or tcpdump but tcpdump -i ppp0 isnt what i
&gt; wanted.  I have installed on another machine ipchains -l b4 and it
&gt; worked fine. this is what I get on

When inserting rules each ipchains command has 3 parts which are:

  1) where the rules exists.  ie. which chain and where in that chain
  2) what packets match that rule.  eg. input interface is ppp0
  3) what to do if that rule matches eg. REJECT and log

So your problem is that you have not specified 1 and 2.  

Infact, you don't need to specify 2, which will result in all packets
being matched.  So a rule which matches ALL incoming packets and logs
them would be:
	ipchains -A input -j RETURN -l

BTW this will flood you logs so DON'T do it.

&gt; but also I wanted to reject all SYN packets and +++ATH0 and so
&gt; forth,

You can match on SYN packets (-y) but not on the content of a packet
with ipchains.  

... and yes, rejecting all incoming SYN packets destined for your box
is often done to make sure that no TCP connections can initialised
from external machines.

Also let me apologise for Mr Lloyd's reply.  In the style which makes
mailing lists useless all over the internet, he insulted you and then
proceeded to not give you a solution to your problem.  Please don't be
discouraged in participating in the list because of his stupidity.  

Regards,
Michael
