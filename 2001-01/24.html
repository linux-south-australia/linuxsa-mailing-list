[a] UDP packets do not have ACK bits
[b] ACK is not set on the first packet of this type (establishing
    connection) but will be set on the rest
[*] This was an "a" in the version I have (first with corrections),
    but is clearly supposed to be "b"

------------------------------------------------------

I have split the table from the book into 3 parts. The top 4 entries are
what goes on when an external client wants to ask your DNS server
something. You are most likely not going to need this, as you are
probably not running a DNS server that hosts entries if you are on a
dynamic IP address :-)

The second set of 4 are what you are probably after, as that's what your
local clients will need to use to get out to talk to external DNS
servers.

Finally, the last set of 6 are for server to server communication. I
imagine that you may well be able to set up a local caching DNS server
that needs server to server communications - if so, it's probably just
the first and final 2 of that set that are required (and the last 2 are
a duplicate of two entries in the second set of 4 - it's just pointing
out that what's being done over the ports is different).

HTH.

Cheers,
