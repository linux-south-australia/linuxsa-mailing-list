&gt; &gt; I downloaded several source RPM's from the WEB including the 2.4 Kernel.
&gt; &gt; I installed the RPMs. Various files appeared in the /usr/src/RPM/SOURCES

&gt; &gt; by step instructions such as the README files of previous kernels. How
&gt; &gt; do I configure the new kernel for my machine? How do I compile these
&gt; &gt; files?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not a total newbie but I cannot find any instructions. Where should
&gt; &gt; I look?
&gt; 
&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; the README file in /usr/src/linux usually is the quick guide to install,
&gt; configure compile and install the kernel from source. If this is a new
&gt; kernel source tree, check in /usr/src and make sure the link 'linux'
&gt; points to the new source tree first.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,

No. I am used to the /usr/src/linux tree. This RPM didn't produce the
usual tree structure. It created the tree
		/usr/src/RPM with 	BUILD
					RPMS/i386
					    /i486
					    /i586
					    /i686
					    /k6
					    /noarch
					SOURCES
					SPECS
					SRPMS
as subdirs below the RPM dir. The only files were in the SOURCES and
SPECS directories. There was no README file. There were files such as
Kernel-2.4.config.i386 or similar for various processors in the SOURCES
dir. There was also a kernel-2.4.spec file in the SPEC dir. No subdirs
appeared below the SOURCES dir. There appeared to be no header files in
a separate directory.

It is not only the kernel that is unpacking in this manner.
joe-2.8-43.src.rpm, rpm-4.0.1-0.29.6x.src.rpm and at least one other
.src.rpm unpacked into the same directories. There do not seem to be any
instructions in how to deal with these sources, or how to configure
them.

I am running Linux Mandrake 7.2 from the latest pocketbook. While it
works well as is I would like to upgrade and tweak it for my system but,
as you can tell, I am rather at a loss in this case.

David Simpson
