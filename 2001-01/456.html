&gt; The other part of the moral is that employers are beginign to learn
&gt; that hiring on attitude does not do them or their employes and clients
&gt; justice, particuarly in specialist/technical fields and are starting
&gt; to use better tehchniques than just the interview(s) to screen applicants.

I agree with what Jason said, but I think he might have misunderstood
what was meant by "hire for attitude."  Attitude is the attribute which
I prize most highly in my employees.  If somebody has not the technical
skills that I want, but knows that he or she can easily pick them up;
if he or she needs no motivating and is very willing to put in effort
to learn and understand a project requirement; these are the attitudes
I desire.  What I don't need is somebody who works to eat, not eats
to work.  A person who hasn't really got the skills, so please give the
project to someone else, also has the wrong attitude.
