&gt; untar it was easy. The second step "./configure" checked for gcc & cc and
&gt; could not find it - hence came to a screaming halt ! (these late nights are
&gt; killin' me !)

The configure script looks for gcc and cc simply by attempting
to run the commands "cc" and "gcc".  So either your PATH doesn't
include /usr/bin (which seems unlikely) or you haven't installed
the C compiler.

Find the packages "gcc", "byacc", "cpp", "ctags", "flex",
"gdb", "glibc-devel", "gperf", "lclint", "libtool", "libtool-libs",
"make", "m4", "patch", "strace", "ltrace", "XFree86-devel" packages for
your
distribution and install them.  You should now have something close
to the traditional UNIX software environment.

Then look for "-devel" packages for each of the RPMs (or whatever)
you have installed on your machine.  Install them too.  For example,
if "rpm -q -a | sort" lists "zlib" then look for "zlib-devel" on
the installation CD (ls *-devel*.rpm) and install it if it
exists.

SANE will probably also need some libraries, for example, the
JPEG library.  So look carefully at the configure output to
make sure that it isn't going to compile a stupid version of the
software because it is missing a library.  For example, if it
can't find X then you might not get any GUI utilities.  Install
the "not found" libraries, remove config.cache and run
./configure again.

This is some work, and most distributions have an installation
option (say "software development") that will do this for you.
Unfortunately, adding the facilities after installation is a pain.

Finally, ./configure compiles for debugging by default.  If you
are installing the program to use it, rather than develop it, and
won't ever care for looking at a core dump then

  CFLAGS="-O2 -s" ./configure

is the command you might want.
