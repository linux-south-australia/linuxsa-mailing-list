I want to hear what the pollys have to say, when they really have some people
who KNOW what they are talking about in the room...!
i bet they "have a busy schedule this time of year", and wont be able to make
it...

i say go all out to get someone in!

linux users must do something, because with schools going m$ and tafes and uni
doing less and less unix all the time, we need to act NOW!!

and i agree there is vested interests with all this shit, along with cushy
hours, wages, super, cars....


&gt; Richard!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; We should also ask for a speaker from Labour and the Democrats ...
&gt;
&gt; That is a good point but I was attempting to avoid this particular
&gt; meeting becoming a political discussion point, hence I chose to invite
&gt; the Hon. Dr. Armitage in his capacity of Minister of the Crown, not
&gt; member of the Liberal party.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This would have the effect of raising the profile of LinuxSA in South
&gt; &gt; Australia so that politicians understand that we are interested in what is
&gt; &gt; happening, and that we vote and that we care.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, what you have suggested is also an excellent idea;
&gt; for once I can equally support both ideas but will say that getting a
&gt; spokesman for all three parties at the same meeting, on a set date could
&gt; be a timetabling nightmare. However, the wonderful thing about not
&gt; having a committee is that once a decision to do something is made we
&gt; can duck for cover and stare aimlessly in Geoffrey's general direction
&gt; ;-P
&gt;
&gt; Mind you, I'd be willing to attempt to coordinate something if that's
&gt; what people wanted.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; We will also have to ensure that the meeting is well attended!
&gt;
&gt; Yes.
