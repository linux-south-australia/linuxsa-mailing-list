I have a 13 gig drive on one of te PC's here which dual boots Win ME for 
games and mdk7.2 for my wife to do work on... Since it's dual boot it has 
some vfat (fat16) partitions to share data etc.

Today I added a couple of fat partitions to the machine. There was some 
unused space at the end (past the 1024 barrier) and I also split the primary 
into 2 bits with the idea of making a new D: drive... It was a 2 drive 
machine and I removed the second drive (1.2 gig) and the plan was to keep the 
drive letters about the same.

Anyway, rearranged the linux parts quite a bit and all worked fine. But brain 
dead windows is having problems. I'm wondering if the partition table is 
wrong and if so how do I check it...

Windows is calling hda3 'J:' which wasn't what I wanted, but what the heck - 
unfortunately windows also had an extra drive, called 'G:' which was 
unformatted, but strangely enough was exact size as J:  Being curious as to 
what winshit would do here, I let it format G: and it quite happily formatted 
it.  So while it knows that J: is full of stuff (I copied there from linux) 
it thinks G: is empty. If I copy stuff to G: in windows I can acces it, but 
if I do a scandisk on G: it gets some fat errors and has to fix it - but I 
don't get any errors checking J:  I am fairly certain that G: and J: are the 
same partition - they are both 235 meg and none of the others are close to 
that.

The strange thing is from linux I can see hda3 and it looks fine. I can't see 
any of the stuff on the mysterious 'G:' drive.

So is this just a windows thing, or is there a problem with the partition 
table causing windows to see multiple drives. I think I originally used an 
old copy of partition magic to fisk partition the drive, but I've been using 
linux fdisk ever since, with no trouble...

Oh, and windows can happily see the drives past the 1024 barrier. hda3 is 
arround the 250 mark. hda13 and hda14 are at the end of the drive and win 
sees them fine. and just the once :-) 

Oh, and I made the fs on hda3, hda13 and hda14 with mkdosfs....
