Another thought: what about a clear statement in your docs on what
Internode considers to be supported operating systems would be good, and a
willingness to post pointers to HOWTOs or whathaveyou that encapsulate
customers' experiences.

Telstra insist that you have a proprietary operating system and that you
be able to show the original install media to the Technician when he
comes. Telstra also understands that people use Linux with ADSL but (as
you'd expect) verbally disown all notion of warranty and support, and have
no provision on their form. In discussions with Telstra I had several
people explain to me in detail why Linux was an unreliable option and
simply shouldn't be used. "So what about FreeBSD then" wasn't the response
that they were looking for :-)
