Hi Adam,

Just assuming there were nasty people on the list, wouldn't they just say
(offlist) " i am a nice guy and  security expert, I will look at your
set up for you "?

In this case, they get a look at your rules anyway.

And concievably "I am a nice guy and a security expert I will look at
your setup. By gosh, what a terrible thing, you really should have this
rule else your world willl end or you should at least move this ruel
here because...".

In this case if they can bluff well enough, they get alook at your rules
and maybe get you to put in a silly rule and you wont know about it or
have the benefit of "peer review".

I think you are better off with a public posting, at least that way any
mailicous replies(or replies form peopel whi dont knwo the subject area as
well as they think/should) are possibly going to be noticed and
questioned.

Off list you have no hope of avoiding bad or bogus advice.

On list there is at least a chance.

As for actually helping you, I know little of ifchains so I cant
actually help.

Jason

&gt; Hi firewall gurus.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyone one the list that would be prepared to take a look
&gt; at my firewall (ipchains & ipmasqadm) scripts and tell me whether or
&gt; not they will operate as I expect.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to put the script on the list just in case it is 
&gt; horribly flawed and will let in some nasty people that may be lurking
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
