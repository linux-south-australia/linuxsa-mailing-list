&gt; &gt;  As linux people you above all should know

&gt; &gt; There is no absolute right and wrong here, there is just choice and

&gt;
&gt; I think you have missed the point here Steve.  The original theme concerned
&gt; whether a person could be a better sysadmin with or without formal training,
&gt; and whether employers might be well advised to choose the unqualified person.
&gt;
&gt; IF the only person who could possibly suffer from your ignorance is you, then
&gt; sure - learn any way you like.  However, a sysadmin can do serious damage to
&gt; their employer and the jobs that employer offers.  In that case, qualifications
&gt; which ensure minimal damage being done would seem an essential first
&gt; requirement for the employers choice of sysadmin.  Obviously,
&gt; successful experience is an additional attraction.
&gt; So sorry, Steve, there IS an "absolute right and wrong here".
&gt;

Interesting, but not accurate. I would not conclude that a person is ignorant
because they did not receive formal training, although I'm sure this was not the
way you meant for me to take it. :-)
Measurement of competence of one's capability is not measured by the paperwork they
have acquired, it is measured on "can they do the job"  So, can a person be a
better sys-admin without formal training, I see no reason why not, indeed those
very same people who have learned without formal training can and do a first rate
job.  As for qualifications, qualifications provide a "measure of assurance" that
you will not damage the system, not ensure it. In one of my earlier posts you will
see that I did indeed state that qualifications were a confidence providing support
to employers who did not know you, and could not be reasonably expected to just
take your word for it.

That's why educational institutes have recognition of current competencies (RCC)
and recognition of prior learning (RPL), to address the very real issue of people
who can do the job, are doing the job, and have learned in an informal and or  in a
non structured manner.

At the end of the day, I would say that it is the employers responsibility to
decide who is competent and who is not, proper assessment by the employer should
ultimately be the deciding factor.
