Jason!

&gt; But if you are talkign about the ordinary every day use of computers in
&gt; schools ( at least in junior primary and primary schools), the usage is
&gt; not much different to business.

I agree but Governments and Government institutions could show
initiative until they lurched somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan.

&gt; The PC and associated applicaitions are not the topic them selves, tehy
&gt; are simly tools, liek pencils and books.

But if I were supplied with pencils whose leds only wrote one word then
broke I would be getting and suggesting different pencils. Why? Surely
it's difficult enough teaching K-1's to write but if you get hardware
problems as well it makes it even more difficult. 

&gt; Under this scenario it is very difficult to see open source beign
&gt; particulalry useful.

Under this scenario  y o u  believe it is very difficult to see open
source beign [sic] particularly useful. 

&gt; Especially if you think that they might also want to prepare kids for what
&gt; they will find in the real world one day. These days what most people find
&gt; on real world PCs is word/excel/windows.

Out of context, removing the especially, I agree with this statement.
But what are we training our children for:

* to become useless dolts who can only operate Company X products
* intelligent, problem solving people capable of learning whatever new
technology and products they might need to in real life

I think that many people forget that school is  n o t  real life.

&gt; Not only that most teachers know word/excel/windows and have enough
&gt; trouble using it, let alone learnign/using anoteh rtos, particularly when
&gt; they have littel itnerest in doing so, and probably even if they were
&gt; interested it would take them several years to get to a usable level.

I disagree. People who are teachers generally are reasonably intelligent
people. Whilst I'm not, of course, suggesting they all could achieve
membership of Mensa, but they are certainly not incapable of learning
how to use a new GUI. If you put a teacher used to Windows on a
Macintosh 9.X system they can generally use the system; if you put a
teacher used to Windows on GNOME or KDE with some icons on the desktop
and so forth I'm sure they'll be able to use the system.

They may have trouble but as you've noted they're having trouble any
way. No matter what O/S you run you're going to have users who "have
trouble" with it and the tools available for it.

&gt; The trainging supplied by the dept is dismal to non existant.

Research and Development in Australia - private and Government - is
dismal. I can't disagree with you there.

&gt; So whiel it is possible that they might use star office for tehre needs,
&gt; it is highly unliekly tht it woudl actually ahppen.

I'm begininning to think that you are more pessimistic than I am. If too
many people took this particular attitude then it would never happen. 

&gt; What would be more likely is that the PCS woudl nto get used as much.

Is that such a bad thing?

&gt; (tehre are still some classrooms where the PC is never turned on - this
&gt; woudl liekly increase if you took away teh OS/apps which they have spent
&gt; lots of time getting to some level of familiarity with  and told them to
&gt; start again).

In such a classroom I would hazard the guess that it wouldn't matter.
They're not going to learn anyway. On the other hand, they may have just
concluded that Windows is not stable enough for their use - and I know
teachers who refuse to use their networks and prefer to take work home
because their Windows based networks fail constantly.

This situation doesn't prevent the installation of another operating
system. What it needs is meaningful discussion with the teachers and the
offering of appropriate training. It also requires the offering of a
useful, stable system no matter what O/S it's running.

&gt; Remember a lot of teachers dont want to do PC support and dont want ot
&gt; do PC training(I dont mean dont want to eb trained, I mean dont want ot be
&gt; PC trainers). They are not trained, equipped or interested in doing so.

I agree with you there. But that is an human resource, operational
issue. You could, for example, determine the teachers who do want to do
PC support, develop a job description of "area IT support teacher",
increase allowances and base pay rates to reflect their new level of
responsibility and everyone is happy. This has absolutely nothing to do
with the operating system on hand.

In fact, reading between the lines what you're saying is that it doesn't
happen now. So what will change if it doesn't happen in the future?

&gt; Some do under the most adverse environemnts, eg no support from
&gt; princiapals little peer support and few funds, policy made by schools
&gt; counclis who have no understanfdign of IT/computers, completely self
&gt; taught, largely in their own time.

We, as a user group, should reach out to these people and offer our
support. We may not be able to proffer them Linux but there are so many
people here who understand:

* TCP/IP
* Security issues
* DNS
* Real-world business experience in IT

And the list goes on. For example, using a combination of a few Linux
box's and a few Windows box's you can teach people about all of the
above things; for the audience we'd probably lean towards the Windows
side of things and how well it can integrate with a different O/S. 

&gt; Taking away that investment in time and skills(no matter how ptiiful these
&gt; skills are) would be extermely demoralising and quite possibly would set
&gt; computer usage in schools backa  few years or more.

Losing the opportunity to help these people develop real world skills
with a variety of Operating Systems - including Windows, Mac OS &lt; X, Mac
OS X, the *BSD's, Linux, BeoS - because someone is so pessimistic to not
even try is worse. Much, much worse.

&gt; As I say if you are specially teachign "computing" is computer sicnese/IT
&gt; principals, tehn sure open source woudl be extermely useful, possibly
&gt; indispensible once you have it and appropriately skilled teachers in
&gt; place.

Agreed.

&gt; But for non "compuiting"  every day  desktop use I cant really see open
&gt; source softewware beign all that useful.

I disagree. All O/S's have their places including Linux and it doesn't
have to be on the server side. Let's see:

* Office Style Stuff
 - Open Office
 - Star Office
 - KOffice

Now, Star Office isn't MS Office but it is - rightly or wrongly - so
similar to MS Office that an MS Office user who knows what she's doing
should be able to make basic documents such as letters to parents,
school reports, luncheon menus, presentations for the Principal and so
forth.

* Internet Stuff
 - Mozilla
 - Netscape
 - galeon
 - Opera
 - IE Explorer

If you really insist on using MS products, I think that the Unix version
of IE still exists. I've never been able to get it to build on my Linux
system, but there seems to be people who have. And what's wrong with the
others?

* Games

There are many strategy, well thought out to dull boring games that are
open source on Linux. Maybe Diablo II won't run natively and such, but
these are school computers aren't they?

&gt; There is more here at stake than good philosophy.

Yes, much more. To finish, I'll quote from Jekyll & Hyde the Musical:

"We have the chance to take charge of our fate
Deep down we must know tomorrow's too late
One rule of life we cannot rearrange
The only thing constant is change
The only thing constant is change..."

And, may we all strive to make things change for the better!
