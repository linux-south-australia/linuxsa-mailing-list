&gt; This may be a longer discussion than you wanted, Ron, but as you can
&gt; see, I think there are a lot of things wrong with how copy protection
&gt; techologies are being foisted on an unsuspecting public.  I'd like to
&gt; hear from you a similar discussion.  Being devil's advocate for a
&gt; moment, why should self-interested companies be permitted to shift the
&gt; balance of fundamental liberties, risking free expression, free
&gt; markets, scientific progress, consumer rights, societal stability, and
&gt; the end of physical and informational want?  Because somebody might be
&gt; able to steal a song?  That seems a rather flimsy excuse.  I await
&gt; your response.

John -

I hope you appreciate this e-mail as helpful feedback, and not as a
criticism.

I read your e-mail at least a dozen times because, while I agree with most
of the individual points you made, and heartily applaud your commitment and
efforts toward open source, I found that I was bothered by the conclusion,
whereby a single theft is dismissed as acceptable to benefit the masses.
Something seemed fundementally wrong with that concept.

Then I remembered a short story by Ursala K. LeGuin called "Those who walk
away from Omelas"  It has to do with an entire civilization being happy,
plentiful and care-free at the expense that one individual suffers everybody
else's pains, misfortunes and miseries.

As you are rightly crusading for fundamental liberties, be careful not to
dismiss any.  I don't believe that was what your statement intended, but
remember that the copyright protection laws were also originally intended to
protect our fundemental liberties, not to intrude upon them.
