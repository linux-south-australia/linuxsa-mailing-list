yeah that would be one of the well documented "features" of lilo, easiest is to
create a small partition named /boot somewhere inside the first 1024 cylinders
of the harddrive if at all possible. the rest of the partitioning is most likely
failing because of this. on another note, try cfdisk. not at all user friendly,
but powerful as all hell.
you may need to shrink the first fat32 partition so that, make sure its is
backed up somewhere!!

ps just get your buddy to sign up any way...

have fun, hope it helps

&gt; Subject: RedHat 6.2 Install by remote control problem
&gt; 
&gt; List,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to help a friend install RedHat 6.2. I have a couple of
&gt; problems:
&gt; 1.	I am in Adelaide
&gt; 2.	Friend is in Mudgee NSW
&gt; 3.	It is several years since I did a RedHat install
&gt; 
&gt; If someone gets an 'ah HA!' when they read this problem description,
&gt; please let me know so I can try to get the friend up and running. Then I
&gt; will suggest they subscribe to this list for further help ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Problem Description:
&gt; Installing RedHat 6.2 from CD (unknown origin). System is a Pentium
&gt; class something, 6Gb hard disk, 64Mb RAM. Two existing FAT32 partitions
&gt; exist, approx 3Gb each. Intention is to drop Linux into the space taken
&gt; up now by the second FAT32 partition, making a large 'hold-all' root
&gt; partition and a 128Mb swap partition.
&gt; 
&gt; Boot from CD, run either fdisk or disk druid from GUI install menu,
&gt; unable to change (delete+add+add) existing second FAT32 partition into a
&gt; swap partition and an ext2 root partition. Delete seems to happen ok in
&gt; Disk Druid. Fdisk identifies three existing partitions, not two, and has
&gt; trouble with deleting the second and third partitions. Disk Druid
&gt; identifies two existing FAT32 partitions, and will make a swap
&gt; partition, but not an ext2 partition in the place of the second FAT32
&gt; partition. Error generated by Disk Druid looks something like 'boot
&gt; partition is too large'. I figured this might have something to do with
&gt; the LILO limitation, but I thought we could do the install and use a
&gt; boot floppy if necessary to get to Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry this is a bit sketchy, but doing this by remote control is quite
&gt; difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas anyone??
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; 
&gt; Bruce
