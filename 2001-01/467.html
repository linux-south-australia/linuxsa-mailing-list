&gt; &gt; Actually, though, I guess I don't REALLY think of [Bill Gates III]

&gt; This would have to be the most breathtaking example of contrariness that
&gt; I've heard so far all millenia.  He's the richest man in the world.
&gt; He's more influential than the US president.  Nine out of every ten
&gt; computers operate using his software.  He formed the company that
&gt; displaced IBM.

However, he has done so selling what is essentially a flawed product. I
can't think of another industry where this would be tolerated _at
all_. Imagine if the housing industry had the same tolerance towards bad
design and relied on sheer marketing muscle? How long do you think people
would put up with houses collapsing? Admittedly there is a big difference
between computers and houses (one would be a lot more deadly than the
other in the event of falling over...) but the idea is the same. I don't
consider Bill Gates a huge success. He _is_ successful in that he has
built a gigantic multinational corporation and become damn rich, but I
think on the customer satisfaction front he is nowhere near successful.


&gt; Perhaps he's not a successful flautist?  Is that it?

That, and also the fact I've never seen him playing bagpipes...EVERY
multi-billionare should play bagpipes. :-)

Cheers,

Sam!
