Actually most learning is done outside of a structured framework.  David is right
learn "what you want to learn, when you want it and in a manner that suits you" As for
the no paper no go stuff, sure it is not ideal but there are many people out there who
know jack about any form of computing making money and pulling the wool over lots of
businesses.  The paper work is for the people who *don't know you* to reduce the
likelihood of you being an complete moron.

Now, tell me, why on earth should TAFE teach you anything about about samba, PHP until
they become more popular with business or with the public.  TAFE is structured for
most of the stuff for most of the people for most of the time.  It does not specialize
it is controlled by the Australian National Training Authority guideline and the
Information Technology Industry Training Board, ie the training is structured by
others, including content and pathways.

As for TAFE taught me jack, maybe TAFE was not the right place for you and YOU made a
wrong choice in going there... did you do your home work on the training provider?

And as a side issue, listen up and listen good ATTITUDE IS WHAT GETS YOU EMPLOYED AND
KEEPS YOU THERE....NOT THE PAPERWORK, NOT THE ABILITY...ITS THE ATTITUDE... hire for
attitude and train for skill.  Ask any employer who has a tech with a bad attitude,
they will never go down that road again.

On a nice note, why don't you come in and see me and we can have a coffee at Adelaide
TAFE and maybe I can help with some of your issues.  I'll be based there from the 22nd
of January in the IT dept and would be happy to show you around.

Just call 8207 8200 and ask for IT studies who will then get a hold of me  ( I don't
have a phone number yet :-))

&gt; David & All,
&gt; i am 19, and i have setup many linux machines from 486's to my laptop and i
&gt; believe i have a good grasp of the install process. i have been through the kernel
&gt; panics and recompiles associatedwith it.
&gt; many a time i have re-installed because i felt like playing with partitions
&gt; etc.
&gt; i have many books, from programming to idiots guides to some of the unleashed
&gt; books, to web-design and php.
&gt; i am currently implimenting my home page in php4 & mysql, and also building my
&gt; own gateway/webserver/firewall connected to a Linux/Windows 10baset network. i
&gt; have worked in web design places, but i really want to be a sysadmin which needs
&gt; a piece of paper!!i believe i have as much skill and experience as many of you
&gt; do (perhaps not the sysadmin types, of course), but only having that certificate
&gt; under your arm proves that.
&gt; i can do all of the common tasks, but until i have that certificate, no go!
&gt; i have intentionally bought & setup network equipment, set up samba, php4 and
&gt; mysql'd my web site, killed 486's celerons and the like, all in the name of
&gt; learning. TAFE is shit house, i have leart 100 times more stuff tinkering with and
&gt; killing my network, breaking programs at home that TAFE could have taught me!
&gt; i hardly use samba, but i can say i have set it up, and know how to use and
&gt; administer it. this is the reason why!!
&gt;
&gt; anyway, my two cents worth, why the current education system sucks.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; David!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is no qualification that would satisfy me, other than experience.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I learned by doing.  I think that's the only way, but some people will
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a different view on the matter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I agree with you wholeheartedly here except there are many
&gt; &gt; financially-unchallenged businesses who are willing to pay for people
&gt; &gt; who have pieces of people, despite the fact these are the same
&gt; &gt; businesses who will complain they can't afford to buy more electricity,
&gt; &gt; raise wages and other similar fiscal issues.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is, I believe, a balance between practical, applied learning which
&gt; &gt; you allude to and theoretical learning. In my opinion our academic
&gt; &gt; institutions - especially the Universities - can't get things right.
&gt; &gt; They seem to be either "applied XYZ" but no theory - so a person can,
&gt; &gt; for example, be ABLE to set up NT Server to serve a site serving
&gt; &gt; millions but not WHY it works OR they lean the other way and land you
&gt; &gt; with all theory and NO hands on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally, I learned by:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * doing
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I installed linux and I reinstalled it at least 40 times before I was
&gt; &gt; satisfied I knew how to install it. There are some who don't have the
&gt; &gt; time or patience so a course may help them. But you can only see install
&gt; &gt; dramas for yourself if you are watching one...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * reading
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a rather large collection of computer books, mainly O'Reilly
&gt; &gt; based but some "Unleashed" series. To the unaware, the O'Reilly books
&gt; &gt; will make more sense if you know Linux or you have at least attempted
&gt; &gt; and failed to implement their subject. They are excellent books and they
&gt; &gt; tend to cover their subjects in great detail, but the downside is that
&gt; &gt; you can accidentally miss the wood for the trees.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * asking this list and other lists
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Believe it or not I've suffered my own uncalld for flames too. I still
&gt; &gt; have a glitch with the "RTFM" without telling people where the manual is
&gt; &gt; or how to access it. Sometimes people don't read manuals simply because
&gt; &gt; they have no idea it exists...the caveat to talking on a list like this
&gt; &gt; is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a) there's bound to be someone who will kill you if you send your email
&gt; &gt; in HTML format
&gt; &gt; b) just because it's email doesn't mean people turn off their sense of
&gt; &gt; humour - but almost everyone has no sense of humour when they read what
&gt; &gt; they get
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And a host of other problems. My own solution to these weaning problems
&gt; &gt; is to give as good as you get :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * watching
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Go to the LinuxSA meetings and if you get the chance to see a "live"
&gt; &gt; system - whether it's a business system or just your next door
&gt; &gt; neighbours - ask. And don't STOP asking...how are you supposed to learn
&gt; &gt; about things if you don't know or won't ask about them? Although you may
&gt; &gt; strike a blast of sarcasm, arrogance or someone just being plain
&gt; &gt; patriotic, if you ignore the connotation and read what they actually SAY
&gt; &gt; you might find some gems of wisdom (1)...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As I said before, James. Just go and do it and come running to us when
&gt; &gt; you encounter the first thing you don't understand and can't work out
&gt; &gt; how to fix...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; DL
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (1)
&gt; &gt; I maintain I generally always answer the question, or alternatively keep
&gt; &gt; on topic in a lateral manner of thinking at all times...
