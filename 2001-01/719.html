&gt; However, assigning by functionality leads to other problems. For example,
&gt; X.25 looks very much like a transport layer protocol to me, not a network
&gt; layer protocol.

X.25 is a transport layer protocol.  It's just not a useful one: it
has slow setup times, addressing that is not necessarily global and
per flow charges.

The link layer is HDLC, the OSI protocol in the LAP-B family.
The physical layer is synchronous serial, this was specified
down to the connector level, which is where the V.35 connector
appeared.

You used to see terminals directly connected to an X.25 network.
These would then place calls to servers running applications like
the Dialog search engine.

You could buy X.25 switches (with synchronous serial interfaces
running from 9.6Kbps to 48Kbps) and a terminal server called
an X.29 PAD (packet assembler/disassembler).

Telcos rolled out X.25 networks with these sort of applications
and devices in mind.

As the Internet became popular it made sense to place X.25
calls between IP routers and tunnel IP packets over X.25.  It
wasn't called "tunnelling", as that word didn't appear
until later.

One of the tragedies of the Australian networking component
industry was that a few powerful individuals promoted X.25
as a transport layer well after it was apparent that TCP/IP
was more useful.  So Australia ended up making some of the
world's best X.25 switches, just as they were becoming
irrelevant.

Glen
