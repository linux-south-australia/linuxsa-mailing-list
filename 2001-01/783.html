Hi Everyone, I hope all had pleasant time away.
I have been having a problem with keymapping since I upgraded to
XFree4.0.1 a couple of months ago, it has come to a head now that I really
need a tty to fix a broken machine.
First, I'm running linux on an iMac which so I hope people will still be
able to help me.
After installing the 4.0.1 RPMs and setting up the XF86Config file to use
the appropriate keyboard (macintosh_old, since I don't have a new kernel
installed - dealing keymappings apparently has changed in the new
kernels) and the X server works fine, all the keys (except for an as yet
unfixed bug that swaps alt and meta) are mapped properly. However, I
switch to a tty and the keymapping is all screwey (I can't actually find
all the keys I need to get back to the X display, or halt cleanly). This
can be reversed if I use the macintosh keyboard type in XF86Config, but
then the X server's keymapping is screwey. I've tried upgrading the /dev
tree to the use the new input layer, but that just makes it impossible to
get the tty keyboard working at all.
The weirdness starts only once the keymaps have bee loaded - pressing keys
during boot outputs the expected characters until /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
loads the keymap and then everything is wrong until the X server starts.
Is there some way to get the appropriate keymaps to work in the
appropriate places?

thanks
Dan
