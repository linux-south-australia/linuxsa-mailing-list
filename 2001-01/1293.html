&gt;From the weird-but-true department - a place I'm contracting for has
&gt;just deployed their "e-commerce" solution, and a week before they were
&gt;about to go live with it, it was pointed out to them that the database
&gt;they were connecting to wasn't up 24 by 7, and is in fact down for a
&gt;substantial period of time while the nightly backups are performed.
&gt;The powers that be just presumed (or should that be "assumed"?) it
&gt;was otherwise, and now all sorts of wonderful kludges are coming out
&gt;of the woodwork to make this happen.

Sounds like the I.T. developers didn't get the business requirements 
right before they developed the solution. You would have thought
that the I.T. folks would have alerted the business to the fact that the

database is not 24x7 as soon as the word "ecommerce" was
mentioned at the beginning of the project!! Making an assumption
that non-I.T. business users know when the database is down
for backups/maintenance is asking a bit much.
