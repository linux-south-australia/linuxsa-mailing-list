I'm generally in agreement. Still, I see two reasons to do it. The
first is appearences. It may aide us in convincing potential customers
to choose us over a competitor. The second reason is improved
performance, however slight, for those "other hemisphere" visitors to
our customers' sites.

&gt; A question from someone who doesn't know much about this kind of thing...
&gt; 
&gt; Why would an ISP (particularly a small one) want a secondary mail/DNS server
&gt; on the other side of the world? I understand the need for redundancy, etc.,
&gt; but would have thought that another ISP close by, or perhaps in another city
&gt; or even state, would be plenty good enough. You'd want to be sure that they
&gt; didn't share the same points of failure in their network connectivity, but I
&gt; would have thought that you could do this without going to the other side of
&gt; the world. I mean, if all routes to your server and to your secondary server
&gt; in another city are down, then I would have thought that it's too far gone
&gt; to worry about having a backup here... Assumedly, if the DNS is
&gt; innaccessible, then the servers it points to are mostly innaccessible too,
&gt; and if the mail server is down, then having a backup here won't help,
&gt; because clients wouldn't be able to get to it until the link returned
&gt; anyway... and if all the links are down, then the country's probably been
&gt; bombed or something, and there are more important things to worry about...
&gt; Am I completely wrong here?
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I operate a small Internet presence firm in Connecticut, US. I'm
&gt; &gt; looking for an ISP in Australia that would be interested in colocating
&gt; &gt; one of our secondary name and mail servers (running linux, of course)
&gt; &gt; in return for us colocating one of their server here.
