actually...... KeyCorp have cut their offer by half ($5 million), keeping 
only the smartcard/payment terminal/electronic banking business. Internet, 
consulting (university and public)and the rest is not KeyCorp core business 
and the offer was re-negotiated.


----------------&lt;snip&gt;------------------------------------
&gt;are) for ~$10 million last year sometime. At the time, employees were &gt;told 
&gt;that the consulting division would grow, if anything. Evidently, &gt;KeyCorp 
&gt;changed it's mind... or something like that...
&gt;
&gt;From what I see, this means two main things:
&gt;
&gt;1) There are a lot (30 or so) of skilled consultants suddenly entering

interesting..... so they fired people first, then re-negotiate to a lower 
offer.

&gt;Adelaide job market, with skills in Unix, Networking, Programming(Java,
&gt;Ada, CORBA, Web, etc etc etc).
&gt;
&gt;2) There will be a lot more work available for other companies willing to
&gt;take it on. It may be my misconception, but I was under the impression that
&gt;Camtech were one of the larger players in the Adelaide consulting market, 
&gt;so
&gt;them closing down means that there is about 30 people-worth more work
&gt;available in Adelaide for enterprising companies...
&gt;
&gt;If I were managing a consulting company, I would be attempting to recruit
&gt;key people from there, particularly the manager types who have all the
&gt;contacts and have been getting the business for Camtech. I would also be
&gt;trying to find out what contracts they had, and would attempt to win these
&gt;contracts (and, seeing as this is LinuxSA, I have to say "and try to use
&gt;Linux and OS software in innovative ways to fulfill these contracts").
&gt;Surely if you could get both the people and the contacts, then the 
&gt;contracts
&gt;would come relatively easily (as long as one's company was capable of
&gt;supporting this kind of expansion).
&gt;

cheers
