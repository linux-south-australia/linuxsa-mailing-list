on this subject,

the provider to the ISP is telstra, who by no coincidence charges for 
data at a rate of 19 - 21 cents per megabyte transferred through the ISP 
.. over and above any other charges they decide to levy for the connection.

&gt; Lets take those paragraphs in order. Apologies for the length, but  
&gt; you've hit one of my hot buttons :) In doing so, I'll put the case  
&gt; for why I think we ...

you bit alright.. not without just cause

&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; For instance, limit vectors can include:
&gt; 
&gt; - hours per month
&gt; - megabytes per month
&gt; - the use of dynamic IP's versus static IP's when a session is initiated
&gt; - session time limits
&gt; - idle time limits
&gt; - throughput limits (created by bad engineering or oversold upstream
&gt;     bandwidth or, deliberate rate limits on sessions)
&gt; - whether multilink ppp is permitted
&gt; - whether ISDN indial is permitted (with or without MPPP, with or 
&gt; without DoV support).
&gt; - percentage likelihood of getting a busy signal when you want to log in
&gt; - cross subsidy, *by you* of those porn-sucking-download fiends on the 
&gt; other lines
&gt; - acceptable use policy preventing access by multiple computers, or 
&gt; the running of servers, or automated download systems, or use by 
&gt; anyone outside of your immediate family except under your direct 
&gt; personal supervision (these are all in the Big Pond residential ADSL 
&gt; conditions!)
&gt; 
Having run a business myself (not in IT or ISP) i do understand the 
balance of income and expenses.  During my IT degree, one of our many 
frivilous exercises was to take Telstra charge document and turn it into 
a readable comparison between three of their services.

Belive me when i say that document took a few late nites to develop into 
a readable format and the results were quiter surprising when the sums 
were done.  If i was in the ISP game i think my prices would include 
download limits or time limits just as Simon points out.

regards

Greg
