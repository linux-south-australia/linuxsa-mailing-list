While reading the "Operating systems" thread, I came across the following
comments by Adams Hawes:

"I've been trying to install Licq under Debian and the only package available
was 0.7.6 when the latest stable release is 1.0.6 (or something like that) and
has been around for at least 6 weeks now.  I couldn't compile the source,
because Debian
doesn't install QT2.2 as default (2.0 is default) and there were no stable
packages for QT2.2 under Debian.  I tried installing the "unstable" packages
(probably stable but in the unstable devel ver of Debian) and it insisted in
installing about 30 other pakages from the unstable release (and they were all
base system stuff; init, XFree,
libc5 and 6, gcc, etc) and when it was completed my system was knackered
=&gt; enter the reinstall! "

I just thought that I would share how I have managed to install version 1.0.2
(current "stable" version according to licq.org). I have licq v0.85 installed
as a debian package & all the required packages (licq-plugin-qt2). I downloaded
the source from the licq website, and compiled adding the option
"--prefix=/usr" to each configure command. This probably isn't the best method,
especially for package management but it works for me at least.
