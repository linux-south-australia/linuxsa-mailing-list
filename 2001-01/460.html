&gt; &gt; The other part of the moral is that employers are beginign to learn
&gt; &gt; that hiring on attitude does not do them or their employes and clients
&gt; &gt; justice, particuarly in specialist/technical fields and are starting
&gt; &gt; to use better tehchniques than just the interview(s) to screen
applicants.
&gt;
&gt; I agree with what Jason said, but I think he might have misunderstood
&gt; what was meant by "hire for attitude."  Attitude is the attribute which
&gt; I prize most highly in my employees.  If somebody has not the technical
&gt; skills that I want, but knows that he or she can easily pick them up;
&gt; if he or she needs no motivating and is very willing to put in effort
&gt; to learn and understand a project requirement; these are the attitudes
&gt; I desire.  What I don't need is somebody who works to eat, not eats
&gt; to work.  A person who hasn't really got the skills, so please give the
&gt; project to someone else, also has the wrong attitude.

So in other words, do a search for 'Attitude' and replace with 'motivation'
it sounds like to me :)
