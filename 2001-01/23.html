It was Tue, 2 Jan 2001 12:52:16 +1030, when you spake,
&gt; Hi Guys & Gals (Merry Xmas & Happy New Year to all)
&gt; 
&gt; I've just installed & Set-up the demo for win4lin 2 - everything went well.
&gt; I've installed and set-up win 98.
&gt; The only problem is when I try to set up the devices - IE lpt ports & game
&gt; Ports win4lin config says they are unavailable because they are "Root only"
&gt; which means I have no "lpt1" under windows.
&gt; Win4Lin says that I need to change the privileges for this device.
&gt; Can someone please inform me the easiest way to do this.
&gt; (please try to remember I am a relative newbie)

The chown (change owner) method is one way of doing it,
another (my preference, since I prefer to leave the ownership of devices alone) is chmod (change permissions etc).
Another problem that can crop up, is if you remove the user (deluser), the ownerships are going to get tricky... maybe...

The command I would use would be:

chmod a+rw /dev/lp0  &lt;-- a=all +=add rw=read/write

This command gives read & write permissions of the device lp0 to all users.
not very secure, but it depends on your situation...

Another way to go is adding the user to the same group as the device, not something I'm into, but check the man page of adduser for the details of adding an existing user to an existing (or new) group.
