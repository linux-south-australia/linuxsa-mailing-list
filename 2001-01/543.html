&gt; &gt;Having (1) searched the SA Government web-site - obviously based on IIS
&gt; &gt;and ASP - it appears that the Hon. Dr. Michael Armitage, MP is the
&gt; &gt;Minister most likely to be able to suggest IT policy for the whole SA
&gt; &gt;Government.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;He is in charge of:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;* ICS
&gt; &gt; - a body that developes internal computing services for the Government
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;* Information and Economic Policy Office
&gt; &gt; - the name speaks for itself
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would suggest that he, or a speaker from the latter office I've
&gt; &gt;mentioned (or both) would make an interesting discussion at a LinuxSA
&gt; &gt;meeting. Keeping an open mind we could, quite simply, ask the Minister
&gt; &gt;to talk about the Government's support of IT in general and how the
&gt; &gt;Government views the growing (I think) Linux/BSD based IT industry...
&gt;
&gt; We should also ask for a speaker from Labour and the Democrats ...
&gt;
&gt; This would have the effect of raising the profile of LinuxSA in South
&gt; Australia so that politicians understand that we are interested in what is
&gt; happening, and that we vote and that we care.
&gt;
&gt; We will also have to ensure that the meeting is well attended!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Now, I haven't proposed this e-mail to create a discussion about IT
&gt; &gt;policy in the SA Government. Nor am I attempting to elicit political
&gt; &gt;responses based on the Minister's part affiliation, or that he is a
&gt; &gt;member of the current Government. Hence, if you reply on list your reply
&gt; &gt;should discuss the merits or lack thereof of inviting the Minister, or
&gt; &gt;his representative(s) as a public speaker.

&gt; &gt;The original started with the word "From" but some e-mail systems escape
&gt; &gt;that with a &gt; (&gt;). Don't you hate that?
