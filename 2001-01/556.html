&gt; collaborative manner. I never suggested that we stage this as a "lobby"
&gt; style meeting, but instead a meeting where we can all get together in a
&gt; relatively informal session and learn about each other.

I'd like that too, but to be brutally honest, I think that given the nature
of our meetings, and the general attitude that nerds and geeks have towards
politicians, I doubt it would be a sensible meeting[1][2]. Honestly, I think
that it would be a good idea to have some communication, but I personally
doubt that either group would get much out of this style of communication
(there is too much difference between the goals of each group (us &
politicians), and hence we wouldn't even be talking on the same level). I
think that the best way to go forward (if at all) is with some form of
formal communication, with a buffer group of people who are able to
understand each party and communicate the desires effectively. I seriously
think that the IT council of SA may be just the group...

[1] I don't mean this as a criticism of anyone in particular, but it is
true -- our meetings have a flavour that would not be comprehensible to
people not accustomed to the behaviour of flocks of nerds.

[2] sigh, now I'm using DL-style footnotes... :)
