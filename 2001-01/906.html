&gt; I thought I'd give it a try, so I set up a RH7.0 box from the
&gt; original release CDs from Netcraft (no updates at that time),

&gt; 
&gt; After ticking and applying many, many updates it kept getting
&gt; into dependency issues.  I have no idea how well any config
&gt; files would have stood up to the process, but the software
&gt; itself was not updated smoothly.

I believe the differences between distributions are extremely small when
it comes to running them on a daily basis for production servers and
workstations *especially* when there are many machines replicated from a
master config, and I'll even claim that I have facts to back this up. (If
someone wants to volunteer to assemble a document on this topic I'll feed
'em facts :-)  

But about packaging systems, since that's the topic...

As pointed out many times on this list (search the archives!) the people
who develop RPM are still working out how best to add a layer that does
dependencies. There are five projects at least for doing this, of which
autorpm is one. Another is the rpm backend for apt. And then Mandrake,
SuSE and TurboLinux each have their own updater that does dependencies. (I
haven't tried Turbo 6.1 yet..) None of these seem to be foolproof yet. Do
GnoRPM and kpkg try to do dependencies now?

RPM is a very functional format for specifying, generating and storing
applications in binary form, mostly for Linux but also for other platforms
such as commercial Unixes as well. *However* the issues of handling a
large collection of RPM packages simply haven't been solved definitively
by anyone anywhere yet.

But this doesn't necessarily matter. Hundreds of thousands (millions? who
knows?) of people use rpm to manage their Linux distribution. With the
exception of SuSE, all of the large rpm-using distros were RedHat once
upon a time. Do these people find life easier than Slackware users, who
don't have the rpm almost-database? I have a RedHat system and a Mandrake
system in daily use, and tend to do ad-hoc package updates 

I find the RockLinux (and to a tamer degree, Slackware) approach quite
attractive where a machine, usually a server, has a small number of tasks
to perform. Upgrading, say, three applications (perhaps squid, apache and
qmail or exim) from pristine sources isn't terribly hard and is certianly
exact.

For machines running many applications that I want to be continually
updated, such as my personal computer
(<A HREF="http://shearer.org/laptopsoftware.html">http://shearer.org/laptopsoftware.html</A>), I find running just two commands
every day or so does everything I need without intervention: "atp-get
update; apt-get dist-upgrade". It is astonishing how the complexity of
thousands of packages is managed without conflicts and failures. The
latest version of xyz mightn't be what I'd put on a production secure
server, but I certainly do want to have it on my testing system in order
to know what's happening with application development.

Is apt-get foolproof? Nope. With the unstable Debian tree (ie, the one
with daily new development, and guaranteed to break at times) I've had
dependency problems at a rate of about one a month, occasionally requiring
a bit of manual hacking to get around. With the stable Debian tree I've
never had a single one. They do happen very occasionally according to the
changelogs, but are quickly fixed.
