Hi...

Badblocks does work with IDE drives, but as you said, lots of IDE drives
these days are intelligent enuf to map around or somehow skip the problem
area.
I had a dead 2Gb HDD with teh same prob as yours, and badblock picked up
some of the blocks after a few read/write runs.

&gt; If you can run the dos program chkdsk and check the disk and it comes up
with
&gt; bad sectors you can return the drive and they should take it. There is no
&gt; excuses from suppliers these days to having bad sectors on a drive.

&gt; &gt; G'day,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looking for some suggestions on how to diagnose a known flaky disk
&gt; &gt; but which currently refuses to fail...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; About six months ago, a hard disk started making very worrying
&gt; &gt; klunking noises, followed by the very obvious noise of
&gt; &gt; the spindle motor ramping up after having been stopped.  Sounded
&gt; &gt; very much like a head crash, except that only one or two spots
&gt; &gt; on the disk seemed to be affected... the rest of the disk works
&gt; &gt; fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've just discovered that the failed drive is still under
&gt; &gt; warranty, and so would like to return it for replacement.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Trouble is, now I can't make it fail.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Presumably some intelligence on the drive has mapped out
&gt; &gt; the bad sectors, and so diagnostics, including those
&gt; &gt; provided by the manufacturer, report that all the sectors
&gt; &gt; of the disk are okay.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I haven't run badblocks(8) yet, that's next...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So two questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) What other tools are available to exercise the disk?  Compiling
&gt; &gt; the kernel certainly creates activity, but I'd prefer something
&gt; &gt; that is more systematic (and thorough!)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Can you obtain a list of bad blocks from an IDE (ATA?) drive?
&gt; &gt; (Yes, I know that this is supported by SCSI drives, but that's
&gt; &gt; not the question here.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; cheers,
&gt; &gt;
