This also depends on advertising and communication with the customer.
If an ISP advertises "All you can get for $25" and uses that to lure
people in knowing that they either do not read or may not understand the
fine print then they should provide what they advertise. One
tactic is to advertise in such a way as to be just legal but
still misguide the customer. Unfortunately
this occurs in many areas of marketing and with many different goods and
services. How does the 'average' consumer know that they are getting a
good deal, especially when thay are a new user? 
Consumer Affairs often has its hands full when following up on misleading
advertising.
On the other hand, some goods and services are provided at a cost that
could be considered too expensive because the marketing people know they
can charge a premium to make new people feel safe. I am refering to
brandname here, not technical support.
