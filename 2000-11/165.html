I have used many modems for many years and can say over the years external modems
appear to be more stable and download quicker.  I have seen internal modems "spike
100%" of the CPU during the connection handshake and cause some problems under
win9x especially if you are pushing it hard with two programs running at the same
time.

&gt; &gt; Incidentally since swapping to an external modem (Maestro Companion) I have
&gt; &gt; noticed that although it connects at the same speed as the previous software
&gt; &gt; modem (49.2Kbps) it seems to get better throughput on downloads than the
&gt; &gt; winmodem.  I guess it stands to reason that if you tie up your CPU doing
&gt; &gt; modem DSP stuff it can't be turning around packets as fast as when you
&gt; &gt; offload that to external hardware.
&gt;
&gt; How intriguing. You seem to have stated, succinctly and perhaps without
&gt; creating a flamewar, that hardware modems may achieve better throughput
&gt; than software modems despite what others might tell you and all the
&gt; hooha about how they are all the rage and that we should support the
&gt; contraptions.
&gt;
&gt; Now, whether this implies that you think that the winmodem you used to
&gt; use is "stupid" is up to you, nonetheless I would question your sense of
&gt; togetherness if you decided to go back to using it and hence getting
&gt; worse throughput on downloads than the hardware modem [1].
&gt;
&gt; Oh, and who got the free beer?

&gt; No, this isn't aimed at you directly; I am - and quite brazenly - taking
&gt; a side swipe at others :-)

&gt; It's our task is to expertly synthesize our synergies so that
&gt; hopefully we may completely empower catalysts for total quality
&gt; management
&gt; as a component of our plan to make our founder enough bread to exceed
&gt; the net worth of the world's richest man.
