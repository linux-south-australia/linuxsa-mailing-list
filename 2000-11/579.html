Hi All,
    The only prices I have found for Alpha systems in Australia (apart from
Compaq) were for Microway systems, the Australian number being 61-(02)
92094580. The problem I found was that apparently they ARE agents for
Microway, but by the time you buy a usable system, the cheapest price you
would pay was AUD$8000. I rejected this because I have seen other
advertisements for Alpha based systems that are similar to Intel PIII prices
in Magazines like Linux Journal, so there must be a cheaper way. I actually
priced up some of these systems from VA Research and other places and even
with the exchange rate it worked out to be about half this, but then who
knows what import duty would be, but even then it should be less. I gave up
looking for now, but I am still interested so if you find anyone else,
please let me know.

    As far as I can tell, an Alpha clone is IDENTICAL to a PIII clone except
the motherboard and Processor, so a system should only reflect that
difference. All other things are EXACTLY the same, video cards, HDDs, FDD,
cases, keyboards Networking cards etc. The Alpha motherboards fit into a
standard PC case and have standard PCI slots.
So as I see it, since an Alpha 21164-600Mhz Processor costs about the same
as a PIII-600 Processor so based on the price of a PC system with a PIII
being about AUD$3000, this means that according to the Australian Microway
agent a motherboard costs $5000, who is profiteering here huh?

    I am still contemplating ordering a motherboard and chip from OS and
buying all the other bits here and building my own system. even if I pay
$1000 after import duty and freight, by the time I deck out the rest of the
system it should come to well under $4000 which for my trouble is probably
the way to go. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; Can someone tell me where one might go to find out the price on Alpha
&gt; based systems?
