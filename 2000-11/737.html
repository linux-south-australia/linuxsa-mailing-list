&gt; That's not a standard convention by any means.  A lot

no, but many (or perhaps some :) apps that have the option of daemon
or forground mode do use an option like this -- eg:

from the fetchmail(1) manpage:
--------
DAEMON MODE
       The  --daemon  &lt;interval&gt;  or  -d  &lt;interval&gt;  option runs
       fetchmail in daemon mode.   You  must  specify  a  numeric
       argument which is a polling interval in seconds.
--------

&gt; of programs that expect to be run as deamons fork() and
&gt; session and disassociate themselves from controlling ttys
&gt; by default; to get them to run otherwise may involve
&gt; setting a command line option.

yes, so you either have a program running in daemon mode by default,
and pass it an option to force non-daemon mode, or the other way
round -- whatever :) ... usually daemon mode involves forks and
dissociation from ttys etc, yes. BTW: one thing to think about,
particularly if using the "&" method, is where output will go -- if
this program (what is it, by the way) normally writes to stdout, then
you may want to capture that output via a redirect (if there is no
daemon mode that handles this automatically) to a log file...


&gt; &gt; I do have a question about this kind of thing -- If you want to run
&gt; &gt; some daemon program as a specific user (eg it is a user's fetchmail),
&gt; &gt; then what do you do?
&gt; 
&gt; If I read the context of you question  correctly, usually:
&gt; 
&gt;    su - $USER_YOU_WANT_TO_RUN_AS -c "command arguments"
&gt; 
&gt; in an appropriately constructed rc file.


ok, that's approximately what I thought, but suppose (hypothetically)
that I wanted to give users the power to have processes start at
system boot -- what would be the sensible way to do that? I can only
think of having the user do something dodgy with cron, or talking the
sysadmin into setting up an rc script like the above for them. I
suppose it would be possible to set up an rc script similar to the
above, but make it more flexible, so that it would run "command
arguments" for everything written in a particular file in a users
homedir... eg: some sort of loop over every user, looking for a
particualr file in their home directory, and then looping over every
line in that file, executing that line as that user... Is that
sensible, or am I dreaming?
