Never used a label with spaces in it before.  My advice is don't.

Is this the default label, or are you entering this via the LILO Boot:
prompt?  Entering a numeric at the boot prompt tells the kernel what
init level to run to, so I'm not surprised that LILO is getting confused
(bear in mind that LILO is a boot loader - it can't afford to waste too
much program space, so it's possible that some of the program logic is
peculiar).
