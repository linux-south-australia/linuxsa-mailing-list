&gt; &gt; (Only thing is my X font server is not working, but I'll fix some other
&gt; &gt; time when I work out exactly what its for, grin).
&gt; 
&gt; back in old days, there used to be a dedicated machine on the network
&gt; that served the fonts to xterms on the network. These xterms were the
&gt; ones you see at some uni, no disk, just video card, ram, keyboard,
&gt; mouse, network.
&gt; 
&gt; The boxes booted and the first thing they did was use bootp to get an
&gt; IP, then they used the information either in their rom or in the bootp
&gt; info to download a kernel, then they booted. the other thing they used
&gt; to do is connect to a font server so that they can draw all the
&gt; different fonts.
&gt; 
&gt; XF86 used to have an inbuilt font server, but one bad thing about this
&gt; was speed. To display a font it hadn;t displayed before, the X server
&gt; had to find information for it (searching a list of directories) then
&gt; render it. This all took time, and it was time that the used was shaking
&gt; the mouse saying "whats wrong? why has my X session frozen".
&gt; 
&gt; So they moved it to a seperate process so that rendering could happen in
&gt; parrallel to the X server
&gt; 
&gt; Now, in the XF86Config file, you will see a line that says:
&gt; 
&gt; FontPath   "unix/:-1"
&gt; 
&gt; where this used to be list of directories, is now a reference to a unix
&gt; socket - kinda like a TCP socket except you can only connect to it from
&gt; the local machine (and other differences, like endian-ness i think).
&gt; 
&gt; So, you have to have a font server listening on that socket, and untill
&gt; you do, it has been my experience that you will have problems running X,
&gt; problems like, you can't. :) Obviously you can? Which may mean your font
&gt; server *is* actually running.

This is what my XF86Config file says:

    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local/"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/:unscaled"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/:unscaled"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
    FontPath   "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/"

My guess is XFree86 is not set up to use a seperate font server?
I did specify to use a font server what I configured X tho.
