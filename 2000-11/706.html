&gt;The duron's are good if you want to spend _a lot_ of money on the MB when
&gt;compared to the CPU (about 2 to 2.5 times dearer).

A good cheap PC-Chips Celeron board (performance of a 486 !) approx $120 - $130
before gst

A good celeron board FC-PGA Intel 815 chipset interchangable Pentium III and
Celeron approx $215 before gst

A good Socket A board eg, Epox VIA KT133 Chipset $190 before gst.


&gt;
&gt;Also if you go duron you don't have much of an upgrade path coz AFAIK the
&gt;duron's and athlon's aren't swappable (Socket A for duron, Slot A for
&gt;athlon) but this may change in the future

I challenge you to find an Athlon processor Slot A for sale (not second hand).
All AMD Duron CPU's and Athlon CPU's are now Socket A, the new generation Athlon's
normally are referred to as Thunderbirds. The duron cpu is based on the Athlon
cpu, only less cache, reviews on Tom's hardware shows that a duron of equivelant
clock speed to an Athlon will be approximately 10% slower than an Athlon.

Average pricing for CPU's as follows:

Duron 650 approximately $115 - $120 before GST
Intel Celeron 667 approx $160 - $180 before GST

AMD Athlon 800 approx $270 before GST
Intel Penitum III 733 approx $300 before GST

All benchmarks show that the duron's are much faster than celeron processors,
and all athlon's are faster than Pentium III processors. Either an Athlon or
Duron setup assuming you use both good mainboards, are going to end up approximately
$100 cheaper at equivelant clock speeds.

The only down side to choosing a Athlon / Duron setup, is the speed of the VIA
KT133 IDE controller. The 815 Controller has real ATA100 support, and gets much
higher performance out of hard disk drives. I've benchmarked a Western Digital
7200rpm 20gb ATA66 hdd on both a KT133 and 815 board, the KT133 was averaging
4.5mb/sec, whilst the 815 was doing approx 18mb/sec. Big difference. To solve
this problem, in all Athlon / Duron systems I build I install the Highpoint
ATA100 or Promise ATA100 controllers which average approx $50 ex GST and these
are achieving speeds of around 21mb/sec on the same WDATA66 7200rpm drive. I
know the highpoint cards are fully supported under linux now, I'm unsure of
the promise.

In my opinion, always go for a Duron / Athlon over Celeron / PIII. There is
no different in upgrade paths between the Socket A or FCPGA boards. In most
cases if you buy a duron or a celeron, and you have decided to set up to an
Athlon or PIII, generally your board will be obselete unless you can find a
second hand or older chip which will run in your board as manufacturers have
a habit of changing this slightly so you always must upgrade (eg, Slot 1 --&gt;
FCPGA or Slot A --&gt; Socket A etc).
