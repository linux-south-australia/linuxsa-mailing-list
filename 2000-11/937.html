Hmm

&gt; I would really like to contact anyone that has accomplished this, i believe i have half accomplished this, but am having serious trouble with sending data, works fine on windows, but cuts out when on linux, via ftp upload, large online form or irc dcc or anything. FTPing works if i create a directroy or upload a file thats &lt;1024bytes, why is this? DUNNO. browsing fine, icq msging fine, irc chat fine.

I think that translates as:

* I can't send data when using Linux
* I can send files via FTP which are less than 1024Kb
* I don't have these problems under Windows

&gt; I belive my setup is near perfect. Redhat latest. Not being able to upload severly SUCKS :(

I am using RedHat 7.0.

&gt; Anyone with experiance or an idea as to why this would be happening (ROARING PENGUIN PPPOE DRIVER) please put forward idea!

The PPPOE suggests it's an ADSL link. Have you checked the archives? A
while back there was a discussion about ADSL modems (?) dropping out
under Linux. Mind you, given that you have given us extraordinarily
little to go on I am taking a wild guess.

Would you mind retranslating what you said into something I can
understand at 1:00 AM without the use of my `Bad Grammar HOWTO' and also
specify things like:

* What version of RedHat
* What type of connection
* Any log messages (look in /var/log/messages -&gt; become root and use vi
or emacs to take a look)

?

I can understand that some people do not speak as fluently as me, but
there isn't really anything to go on. AND there was no subject line. Is
this person attempting to bait me into a flame war or is this person
being serious? Who knows?
