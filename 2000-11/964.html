&gt; &gt; I'd skip discussing pricing, it all gets a bit libellous.
&gt; 
&gt; yes, although it's an area of interest for all of us, is it not?

Pricing isn't the problem.  But then someone will mention the
relationship between price and service, and that's when the
presenter can find themselves threading through the minefield
so nicely provided by our libel laws.

Better by far to allow ISPs to attend and give out their
marketing materials and spruik for custom one-on-one after
the talk.

&gt; mention VDSL etc (the xDSL family).

VDSL can't run over Cat 3.  At 60Mbps its reach is about 500m
over Cat 5.

So ADSL and VDSL topologies are completely different.  ADSL
runs over existing copper to an exchange.  VDSL runs over new
copper to gear on a pole.  That gear is then optically networked.

So discussion of VDSL really belongs under "optical networks",
as one of a range of "last yard" technologies.

&gt; Perhaps a slide or two on history would be good.

Sorry, I don't understand this.  If you mean the history of DSL
technolgies then I think we could have the entire crowd snoring
after the first sentence.  The difference between the ADSL standards
is also real MEGO ["my eyes glaze over"] material.

&gt; I know that this gets controversial, but it certainly would be interesting to
&gt; hear a little about what some of the Telcos, ISPs and whatever else are planning
&gt; in Adelaide and SA...

We could give each of the broadband providers five minutes to outline
their rollout plans.  The danger here is that you might get four 5-minute
content-free market spiels.  Although that alone would say something
about the suppliers cluefulness :-)

Geoffrey, how's this looking?

Do any broadband providers have preferences for a date?
