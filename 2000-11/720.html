OK Guys
While all the superusers are away from conducting theirs LAN's ,
cleaning out their swimming pools on this hot Sunday morning ? , I will
document my current Catch 22 situation in no hope of catching someone
who has overcome a similar catch?
Swapped my RH6.1 for a Mandrake 7.1  recently with an working copy of
Samba included . Although I had fooled printtool in RH into thinking my
Canon 2000SP was a 610 as far as StarOffice and Netscape were concerned
, enabling me to print most of what I needed to print  , Mandrake aint
so accommodating but offers the hope of using Samba to use the printer
while running on the Win98 part of my machine . The Catch 22 situation
arises in trying to get all the stuff I need to compile smb.conf to do
this in a mull-over or hard copy form . OK OK buy the bloody book....
thats a trip to town and $'s I aint got!.
Anyway seems to me I am going to run into a font problem anyhow . When I
output a man page to say Office or /mnt/win_c ie 'man samba &gt;
./Offfice51/Desktop the bold type fonts come up wrongly , ie bold p
comes up as 'p#p' making most of the stuff hard to read and it prints as
shown . Putting the same output into MS Windows does the same thing with
the bold fonts and seems to leave out all the LF's CR's as well .
Yeh well the "locate font" command comes up with 8120 lines of bumff and
I got a feeling that the printer like the old ones I dealt with decades
ago only responds to specific ESC($27) sequences that is held as a dark
secret by the printer purveyors like Canon to Bill Gates .
Well getting Samba to run seems like it might open a few more computing
doors than simple printing and I will keep plugging at it and reckon I
shall probably get there in the end . Thanks for reading!
cheers
Bob Crockart
