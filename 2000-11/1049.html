David!

&gt; How does that price vary for distance (ie does it cost the same to run to
&gt; my local exchange, as to say Internode's doorstep ? How about through
&gt; non-residential areas ?

I should clarify. To make the overhead cables that currently exist into
underground cables costs a huge sum, in the order of 1000's (I'm sure
it's 10000 at least) per metre. Generally Councils do this and they have
to get quotes from contractors who will actually perform the work. It
depends on things like "will we have to drill through major rock
formations underground, do we have to take out the street furniture and
put it back" and so forth...

But the cost is astronomical - it's one of those things where it's
cheaper to stick them overhead at the start but if you ever want to go
underground, your total cost is just silly. At the same time, as Greg
pointed out, from memory add "extra" cables (eg the cable TV, ADSL lines
etc etc) doesn't add to the cost significantly...
