&gt; Regarding linux specific hardware.
&gt; You might me right, but I am looking for hard ware for linux only as I
want to build my second computer to run linux and linux only, so I am
willing to spend extra money for the hard ware that I need. I don't live in
a big city and it is hard to get hard ware and advice for linux from the
computer stores here in Ayr. They all use windoze and don't know any thing
about linux at all.

So if you can please sugest a good video card for linux please do.  Thank
you.

&gt; Consumers are obsessively price sensitive.  If company X makes a
&gt; printer for Linux and it turns out to be 10% more expensive than the
&gt; printer that company Y made for Windows, and then a driver is released
&gt; for company Y's printer ---- well few people will make the choice to
&gt; reward the support of company X.
&gt;
&gt; For example, there _are_ unix specific personal printers.  I own a
&gt; Lexmark E12.  It is a 10 page per minute, _postscript_, laser printer,
&gt; that cost me about $460.  This is about as close as you can get to a
&gt; Linux printer (given the state of the printing subsysytem ;-).
&gt;
&gt; Actually, it is a very good printer, but hey I don't see much good
&gt; happening to Lexmark for all their trouble.  Specifically they seem to
&gt; be laying people off and losing money.
&gt;
&gt; Will Matrox's helpful efforts wrt the XFree86 4.0 DRI mean that Linux
&gt; users will buy their product over the cheaper, faster Nvidia products?
&gt; I doubt so, even though Nvidia have been shown to be rather
&gt; duplicitious wrt their support for DRI.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Andrew
