Daniel!

&gt; &gt;First of all have you tried putting your clock speed back to normal?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes,  She's back to 400Mhz now :)

But did you fix the possible damage you caused it? I distinctly remember
that K6-II's generally run very hot (and Athlons are worse).

&gt; Ram - Replacing it. No success

With new RAM?

&gt; CPU - cant replace it. I have a pentium 233 here but I don't think my Epox MB
&gt; supports it :(

You could buy a new K6-II-500 for a very low cost.

&gt; Sound card - (SB 16 ISA) Haven't tried

Take it out then.

&gt; Video Card - (AGP Intel I740) Haven't tried

&gt; Should I even bother trying these?

Well, if you have the time and inclination it shouldn't hurt. Just don't
overclock them :-P

&gt; I can't understand why it is working now and not other occasions when I don't
&gt; touch a thing and the temp. doesn't change.  Is this just my lack of knowlage of PC componants?

It's very possible that you have some odd combination of components that
just don't like each other. When the computer boots they generally spit
messages about what's on which IRQ and such. Check them and if you have
two things on the same IRQ have a go at separating them. Some, if not
most, modern operating systems/mbs or whatever can cope with two devices
on one IRQ but I've seen phantom problems caused by this before...
