Damien!

&gt; Hola otra vez David.  Es bueno oír de usted otra vez.
&gt; Ciao ancora David.  Buono da sentirsi ancora da voi.

Eeeck! I'm not sure the Italians would express themselves like that, but
I get the feeling for what you're saying.

&gt; What most people would agree a word means in the dictionary sense and
&gt; how they would use it everyday conversation are two different things
&gt; (strict definition/effective definition).

No, they are not two different things. They are the same things. The
point of dictionaries is to present meanings as the word is used. Now
one could argue that the dictionaries themselves are wrong...

&gt;  This is English, not a
&gt; strict continental language (like Spanish or Italian, although they
&gt; have their own peculiarlarities [is that a word?  Maybe I should use
&gt; quirks?]).

peculiarities. It is a word but you spelled it incorrectly. Incidentally
I do know that I am writing in English :-)

&gt; Most people would read the question "Which is best" to
&gt; "Which is your favourite".

I would agree that most people would map the question "which is the
best" to "which is the favourite" but:

a) they're not answering the correct question
b) they're wrong
c) in the context of the original question the person is obviously not
asking what is the favourit
d) the whole thing stinks, I think it's wrong and I don't like it

&gt; For example, ask many Australians which is "best", Ford or Holden and
&gt; you'll just get their favourite (same with political parties).

Just because the majority of Australians voted Prime Minister Howard in
doesn't mean that Prime Minister Howard is the best Prime Minister.
Many, many centuries ago most of the western world believed the world
was flat.

&gt; If the answerer actually takes the meaning to be the "superlative of
&gt; good", this still is a subjective question.

It is not a subjective question. One can bring the question out of the
subjective and honestly rate one operating system against each other.

&gt; Ask three people
&gt; "Which is the best operating system?"
&gt;
&gt; and you could potentially get the three correct answers:
&gt;
&gt; "OpenBSD is the best, it is the most secure." [read, if you are looking
for the most secure operating system then OpenBSD is the one]
&gt; "BeOS is the best, it's built from the ground up for multimedia [ and so
forth...]

&gt; All three answers are correct for the individual answerers, yet all
&gt; are different.  ("Yes, we're all different.?; ?I?m not.")

No, they are all incorrect answers. Without a qualifier one MUST assume
that one is asking for ALL attributes to be superlative. If one doesn't
then you get mired into contextual wars...the "Which is the best XYZ"
begs the question against what criteria. The only way to logically
answer that "which is the best" is to either:

1) list out all the possibilities
2) state some answer and make sure you can say why

&gt; I'm sure we all understand the strict definition, but do we all
&gt; really use it in everyday conversation?

Yes.

&gt; What's the best soft drink?

Pepsi-cola from a post mix with extra mix...

&gt; What's the best brand of sneaker?

Reebok. Michael Johnson (I think) says so...

&gt; English is notorious for having
&gt; double meanings for what is said.

Well, the best is the superlative of good. If the best is the
superlative of good, then it has only ONE meaning.

&gt; LOL.

lollies perhaps?

&gt; &gt; In an Object Oriented paradigm it would be like an
&gt; &gt; abstract class...
&gt;
&gt; I'm intrigued.  An explanation please.


The abstracted parent class (call it "best") has a very definite
meaning. Now, you can create subclasses (children) which specify the
attributes you have decided make whatever the class represents the
best...BUT everyone agrees what the abstract class means, it's just that
there are and can be multiple children because in this case noone can
exactly agree how to cause a representation of said class to manifest.

I'd like to see that sentence go through Babelfish :-)

&gt; Absolutely!  Just like all the drivers on the road follow the traffic
&gt; code to the letter!

Ummm....sentence. Or more specifically, clause, subclause and
sub-subclauses.

&gt; &gt; &gt; "No Marge, when kids say bad, they mean good.  And to shake your
&gt; &gt; &gt; booty, means to wiggle ones behind.  Permit me to demonstrate."

&gt; Not a Simpsons fan I suppose, a bit contemporary for you? ;&gt;

I'm asking you to get up and wiggle your behind in front of everyone.
Why is it that noone understands my left-of-centre sense of humour? I'm
sure if you do most of the girls (and maybe some of the boys) who come
along might, well, make you an offer you can't refuse :-P

&gt; &gt; Pedantry is not, by my definition, petty.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, but from the dictionary (Merriam-Websters Collegiate):
&gt;
&gt; Pedant: 2 b : one who is unimaginative or who unduly emphasizes
&gt; minutiae in the presentation or use of knowledge
&gt;
&gt; Pedantic: 2 : narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously learned
&gt;               ^^^^^^^^
&gt; Petty: 3 : marked by or reflective of narrow interests and
&gt; sympathies.


Rubbish that means it's petty. Pedantic people can and are generally
quite imaginative. They focus on one issue and fix, argue etc it. Petty
people basically harp on with things for the sake of it with no purpose
at all.

&gt; You think that Bill Gates is an authorative source on Linux
&gt; distributions (or anything but bully tactics in corporate business)?

He must have spent some money  looking at it?

&gt; Do you even USE Linux????  (Joke ;)

Well, yes. It's my primary desktop operating system and I do contract
work involving taking care of RAID arrays, Samba, Sendmail, Amanda and
you name it...

&gt; The person was I, and I meant (and said) *Debian* *or* Mandrake.
&gt; Depending on the sort of person and task it would be put to, one or
&gt; the other could come out as superior.  Without qualification there
&gt; can be no answer as to the best (strict dictionary definition) Linux
&gt; distribution, but only an answer as to the best (for set purpose, ie
&gt; with qualification) or the best (my favourite) Distribution.

You neither gave reasons or said which was your favourite. Nor did you
specifically state that at the start. People aren't mind readers
(although I wish I was sometimes).

&gt; You lost me there (and I don't mean the can not not).  How does the
&gt; "best" have an answer?

Ummm, you could answer Redhat. It's very easy to make answers :-)

&gt; And by saying "There are no questions we
&gt; cannot not answer" means that we don't have to answer any questions.

&gt; I can not answer - no answer

&gt; I cannot not answer - I must answer
&gt;
&gt; No question I cannot not answer - there are no questions I must
&gt; answer.

You've stuffed the logic up. You've either failed to see the royal "we"
(I tend to talk in singular plural when writing). If you replace the we
with one (and adjust the grammar slightly) that statement makes perfect
sense.

&gt; &gt; Cosa dica? Non Lei capisco!
&gt; Umm.  {What is written? I don't understand!}  (dica - dictated or
&gt; says?? capisco - similar to capiscono - understand - It is Italian,
&gt; is it not?)

(I said in Italian): What are you saying? I don't understand you.
