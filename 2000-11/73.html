&gt; &gt; That much is clear.  I'm trying to find some other message in your
&gt; &gt; statement.  Certainly Open Source operating systems will get nowhere
&gt; &gt; if they don't run on currently available hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but really the hardware mfr should be writing the drivers, as they do
&gt; for windows. 

and to come full circle, that's just what Lucent have done - well, they
out-sourced it, but in essence that's what they did. The ltmodem driver
is a proprietary bit of software sponsored by Lucent.

(this is not aimed at Tim)

Notwithstanding that Winmodems are a not-really-bright-thing anyway, the
fact is there are lots of them out there in pre-existing systems, and
when an owner of one comes and asks if (s)he can use it if (s)he
installs Linux, our answer should be well-informed and informative.
Using a request for help as a soapbox to rant from is in my opinion
simply purile. If the module exists, simply say so, and point to it if
you know anything about it. If you know nothing about it, say precisely
that.

Is it Friday yet?
