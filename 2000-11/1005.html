&gt;I found the Telstra reference at

&gt;PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS.
&gt;
&gt;CONDITIONS NOT SUPPORTED
&gt;The following terminal operating conditions are not supported by Telstra and
&gt;may affect the PSTS service levels in this Attachment:
&gt;....
&gt;Data modems and facsimile Customer Equipment working at data signalling
&gt;rates greater than 2400 bit/s.

This indicates confusion, and was probably not checked by one of Telstra's
techos. 'signalling rates' indicates baud, while they have written 2400
b/s, which as others have said, is not the same. 

&gt;Data modems and facsimile Customer Equipment not conforming to ITU-T
&gt;Recommendations V.18, V.21, V.27 ter or V.34.
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;So it was my memory playing tricks, Telstra do not state baud but they do
&gt;state a signalling rate no greater than 2400 bps. Doh...
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, enough of the trivia, the only real limiting factor in Telstra's
&gt;network these days is the local loop.  From the originating exchange card to
&gt;the terminating exchange card Telstra carry all voice calls over a 64K
&gt;digital channel.  Thus, there is no reason (other than marketing/product
&gt;management and the grab for cash) that Telstra could not offer a base rate
&gt;ISDN service as it's base level PSTN offering.  In doing so the need for V90
&gt;modem technology would basically disappear along with all the quirks and
&gt;problems that modem technology brings with it.
&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry, the latest documentation from Telstra available on their web
&gt;sites
&gt;&gt; &gt; (now If I could rember where, umm maybe USO pages) explicitly states
&gt;2400
&gt;&gt; &gt; bps.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The USO that I downloaded makes no mention of this.  And if Telstra
&gt;&gt; have stated this, then that means that they've got it wrong, and that
&gt;&gt; they are now unable to distinguish the difference between baud and
&gt;&gt; BPS.  Baud is not the same as BPS (technically untrue, as most
&gt;&gt; signalling that occurs below 2400 bps the two are the equivalent rate).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact I don't believe the USO (Universal Service Offering) actually
&gt;&gt; &gt; defines what speed Telstra has to supply - I think you will find that
&gt;&gt; &gt; Telstra only has to supply a voice grade service.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Which is where the 2400 baud comes in - it's pretty much the maximum
&gt;&gt; bandwidth that you can squeeze out of a voice grade (3.3 Khz from
&gt;&gt; memory, but I may be out by a few hundred Hertz here) due to Nyquist.
&gt;&gt; Any bitrate over 2400 bps is done "by signalling trickery", like
&gt;&gt; QAM and run length encoding/compression, but the _baud rate_ cannot
&gt;&gt; exceed half the available bandwidth without sampling errors being
&gt;&gt; introduced.  Yet people keep making the same mistake (on both sides
&gt;&gt; of the fence) over and over again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Feel free to correct me, but please supply a reference to a document
&gt;that
&gt;&gt; &gt; supports your position.

&gt;&gt; Elementary communications, and my dealings with Telecom/Telstra and
&gt;&gt; modems in the mid 80's.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; BTW, an Altavista site-limited search cannot find any relevant
&gt;&gt; matches for "2400" on either www.telstra.com or www.bigpond.com.
&gt;&gt; I'm keen to see where Telstra have this in print.
