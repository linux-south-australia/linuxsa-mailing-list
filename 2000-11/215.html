&gt;&gt; Its a lot more expensive(comparatively liek $0 to $70+ - a a$70 modme is

&gt;&gt; modem.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, a real modem that works is more like $200-300 for me.

It's been a long time since I've paid anything like that for a real
modem, even PCMCIA.  One of the very annoying things about "winmodems"
is that they are little cheaper than traditional serial port based
modems.  But when just about every laptop nowadays includes a
"winmodem", and when I don't need a modem very often (only when I'm
away from an Ethernet), I'd be prepared to put up with it.

&gt;&gt; There is nothing stopping some interested party in writing the
&gt;&gt; appropriate software for win modems to run under other OS's, if
&gt;&gt; they so desire and can be bothered.
&gt;
&gt; And yes, this is probably illegal in many cases.

I very much doubt that the manufacturers would prosecute somebody for
doing anything which would help sell their equipment.

There's been a lot of talk about "winmodems" on this and other lists.
But AFAICT nobody has described how they work.  The current kind of
modem, effectively an emulation of a serial interface and an external
modem, seems less than clean: I strongly suspect that the first chip
in an external modem is another serial interface chip which turns the
data back in some parallel form suitable for processing by the
compression and error detection circuitry.  If a "winmodem" does away
with this double conversion, it makes sense.  But how do they really
work?  What work does the CPU need to do?

I accidentally bought a PCMCIA "winmodem" a couple of weeks
ago--nothing on the box or even on the docco CD pointed to the fact,
and it wasn't any cheaper than my current PCMCIA modem.  I couldn't
get it to work, of course, but it wasn't completely dead.  It
understood the "AT" command and responded correctly.  In fact, it
understood anything starting with "AT" and came back and said "OK",
regardless of the command.  That's not usable, but it's not as
completely brain-dead as I would have expected a winmodem to be.  Can
anybody shed any light on how these things are supposed to work?
