After finally getting my ADSL connection, I downloaded the iso for the first
Mandrake 7.2 CD. After burning it onto a CD and installing it (which hung
when it got upto the installation of teh bootloader, which worked anyway,
but when it booted Linux and fsck'd, it found a heap of errors).

I then tried to 'rpm -qipl * &gt; ~/rpms.info', but it just hung and seemed to
do nothing. I couldn't eb bothered waiting, so I stopped it, and tried
copying all the rpms to the HDD (cp * ~/rpms/). That eventually finished,
but occasionally it would just stop copying anything for about 30 to 60
seconds (or at least it appeared that way. if I did an ls in the directory,
no more files were added during this time). The CD activity light was active
however, but I couldn't hear the CD read head moving, even when it was
copying the files. When it finished, I did the rpm -qipl * and it didn't
report any errors, so were there read errors that were corrected?

Is there any way to check a CD for errors?

thanks,
Andy
