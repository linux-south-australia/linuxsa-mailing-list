&gt; Some HOWTOs say you need one, others say you don't.

You don't _need_ to run a firewall at all.  It is, however,
_strongly_ advisable that you run one.  In the same vein, you
don't need to run a separate box as your firewall, however it
is strongly advised that you do, as once the firewall is
penetrated by a determined enough cracker, then it's Game Over
Player None.  If that box happened also be hosting a web server
with a secure certificate, then they can make off with that, plus
whatever mail you had stored on there, plus any credit card details
you may have had stored there as well ...

It usually boils down to Risk Analysis (as does most things) - what
can you afford to lose?  What is your worst case scenario?

&gt; There will be no remote access to the box and most services will be
&gt; disabled except for mail and a proxy server so that we have net access.

And the webserver you mentioned before.
