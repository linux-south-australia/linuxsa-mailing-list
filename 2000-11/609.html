Hi All,
    Firstly for those of you who pointed me at the Sendmail FAQ to fix my
previous problem, thanks. BTW I wasn't being lazy, just ignorant that by
upgrading to a later version of RH Linux, I didn't expect POP mail to be
broken on a standard install of 7.0 whereas it is fine with previous
versions I have used. This leads me to my further problems with mail, namely
that it appears to be working normally except for the users cannot get their
mail with POP mail clients (O.K. they are using Outlook Express). Now before
some of you jump down my throat again and tell me it is in the Sendmail FAQ,
I know. Here it is quoted below, and it is relevant to my problems here.

3.10 Sendmail seems to be working fine, but when my users try to
connect to the mailhost to POP their mail, they can't connect. What's
wrong?

This really isn't a sendmail issue but you probably don't have the POP3
daemon installed. On Red Hat Linux, it's part if the IMAP RPM (IMAP-4.5-4).
Use RPM
to check and see if it's installed using the command rpm -q imap. If you get
a null response it's not installed and you need to install it to get this to
work. Just mount
your CD-ROM using the command mount /mnt/cdrom and install the IMAP RPM
using the command rpm -Uvh
/mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/imap-4.5-4.i386.rpm. Try connecting from your clients
again. If you still have a problem have a look at your /etc/inetd.conf. Look
for the line which ends with ipop3d and make sure it's not commented out
(e.g. prepended with a `#'). If it is, remove the pound sign, restart inet
using the command
/etc/rc.d/init.d/inet restart and try connecting again. Unless some step
discussed above was missed, that should take care of the problem.


O.K. here is the problem. Imap wasn't installed and I did this off the RH
7.0 Binary disks (a slightly later version, but not a significant issue).
Unfortunately, inetd.conf no longer exists, having been replaced with
xinitd.conf, so here is where the problem starts. There is no man page for
xinitd. I read the readme file, but I cannot work out what it means. Here is
a copy of xinitd.conf below.

#
# Simple configuration file for xinetd
#
# Some defaults, and include /etc/xinetd.d/

defaults
{
        instances               = 60
        log_type                = SYSLOG authpriv
        log_on_success          = HOST PID
        log_on_failure          = HOST RECORD
}

includedir /etc/xinetd.d

    Fine, that should be all the info you need, so can someone who can help,
please guide me in the right direction to get my mail working. As far as I
can tell this is a simple config problem, but it beats me why a standard
install has suddenly broken what must be one of the most used functions of a
Linux Server anywhere. I have never had this problem before and I must have
done about a hundred installs by now. Your help would be greatly
appreciated.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.
