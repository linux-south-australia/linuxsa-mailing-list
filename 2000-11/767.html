Hi Everyone,
The script I was getting help on before is nearly finished (I don't need
it any more, but I want to have it finished anyway). The problem I'm
having at the moment is that I can't figure out how to escape / as part of
the replace string in a sed s command:

I have a bash function set_value which modifies the value to equal $2
following an = sign just behind an occurence of $1 in my rc files like so:

set_value ()
{
   sed s/'^\( *# *\)*\(\&lt;'$1'\&gt; *= *\)\([^ #]*\)\( *#.*\)'/'\2'$2'\4'/
}

so "echo 'option = blank # dummy option' | set_value option value" returns

option = value # dummy option

Except...

One of the values that I need to set contains the character / as it's part
of a path. sed won't accept the argument since it screws up the s 
command. I've tried escaping it with \ in the argument but I get the
error:

./batch-bambe.test: line 1: 15912 Broken pipe             sed s/'^\( *#
*\)*\(\&lt;'$1'\&gt; *= *\)\([^ #]*\)\( *#.*\)'/'\2'$2'\4'/

(the function set_value is called as part of a fairly long pipeline
that sets numerous values in the rc file so this doesn't really help me)
I've had a look around for descriptions of what to do but cannot find
something which doesn't suggest doing what I have already tried.
Does anyone have an idea about how to fix this.

I'm guessing that doing this in Perl would have been easier, but it's
almost done now (assuming I get this last bit to work).

thanks
Dan
