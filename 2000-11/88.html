Heya Michael.

Its not the inactivity which is causing my premature disconnections; I am on
IRC when I'm on the net, and I'm usually downloading.

I have also heard rumours (no idea about their genuinity) that Asia Online
are soon to implement a 200MB limit on their unlimited deal; which I am
using; does anyone know any more about this?  I use Asia Online as I will
admit, I do download a LOT of stuff, and as a result this disconnection
every 4 hours doesn't bother me; I prefer it over having a pernament
connection with a download limit.  Hence why I am with Asia Online; I
appreciate whoever suggested Internode to me, and indeed they are an
excellent ISP, but they *do* have a download limit.  If I lived in Adelaide,
I would most defninitely go with Dingo Blue, but being on the fleurieu
peninsula I don't get the diversity and choice Adelaideains do, unless I'm
willing to fork out STD rates of course.

Additionally, how exactly would I go around writing a perl script, I could
whack on my apache web server, to run a command line?  (for example, have a
"dial the internet" ( = ifup ppp0 ) or "disconnect from the internet ( =
ifdown ppp0 ) or "change connection details" (no idea how to implement this,
I use linuxconf currently).  Some of them, particualry those changing
configuration files, would need root access, so how would I implement a
"login" procedure on this?

Webmin isn't a solution to this as I don't want its complexitity, even
though it *can* be customised.

I assume it'd be perl, any other non-perl based solutions to this would be
of interest also (it would ideally need to be accessed through a web
browser).

Thanks
Ryan.

&gt; Hi Ryan,
&gt; Better late than never, maybe.
&gt;
&gt; If you're happy (sort of ) to redial every 4 hours, just not every 2 - 20
&gt; minutes, then would you be satisfied to be only disconnected every 4
hours?
&gt;
&gt; I think your ISP is at fault here since I had a similar (well, exactly the
&gt; same) problem. At a guess I would think that your ISP is disconnecting you
&gt; after a period of inactivity for whatever reason (maybe they've run out of
&gt; modems and kick off the user with longest period of inactivity , or
whatever)
&gt;
&gt; I ended up writing a simple script that pinged an IP address (their's
actually)
&gt; every few minutes with a single ping, and since then I have not been
&gt; disconnected before time once! The number of calls to my ISP has dropped
by
&gt; 2/3.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Michael
