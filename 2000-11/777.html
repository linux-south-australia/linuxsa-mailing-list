&gt; Evan,

&gt; Harddrive - Tried replacing...No success

&gt; 
&gt; Any more suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; I can't understand why it is working now and not other occasions when I don't
&gt; touch a thing and the temp. doesn't change.  Is this just my lack of knowlage of PC components?

I am assuming that Linux doesn't boot at all.

You need to find out about the boot process of Intel-based PCs. This
will help you to be able to spot the problem almost instantly.

First, at power on, the CPU is powered up. Anything that happens from
here pretty much relies on this working.

Second, the RAM and video are initialised (this is still before anything
appears on the screen). If this fails, you will hear beeps (depending on
the BIOS manufacturer).

The video card then sends a signal to the monitor, this is the first
thing you will se on the screen.

Your BIOS will then do a power on self test. If anything fails, it will
usually beep, print a message and ask you to press F1 or something
(again, dependent on manufacturer).

You will also be given the option to enter the CMOS Setup utility
(usually by pressing Del).

If everything up to here works, and your various IDE and PnP devices
have been detected (for those boards that support it) the BIOS then
passes control to the master boot record on the hard disk.

The MBR will by default boot the operating system on the active
partition of the first hard disk. If you have LILO or another boot
mangler installed, you will probably see some kind of prompt or menu.


I am assuming that your machine doesn't appear to do much at all when
you power it up. Try removing all of your RAM. If it beeps, you know
that the CPU works. If not it's not looking good. Work through the above
list (which isn't completely accurate, but it's enough to get the
general idea) and see if you can fix the problem.
