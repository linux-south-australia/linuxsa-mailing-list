&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;  I think it matters to Larry Wall a lot.  Have a look at his
&gt; writings on the matter (www.perl.com).

"               What is Perl?

               Perl is an interpreted high-level programming language
developed by Larry Wall. According to Larry, he included in Perl all the
cool features found in other
               languages and left out those features that weren't so cool. 

               Perl has become the premier scripting language of the Web,
as most CGI programs are written in Perl. However, Perl is widely used as
a rapid prototyping language
               and a "glue" language that makes it possible for different
systems to work well together. Perl is popular with system administrators
who use it for an infinite number
               of automation tasks. 

               Perl's roots are in UNIX but you will find Perl on a wide
range of computing platforms. Because Perl is an interpreted language,
Perl programs are highly portable
               across systems. 

               Finally, Perl is more than a programming language. It is a
part of the Internet culture. It is a very creative way of thinking about
almost anything. 

"

It would seem that the words 'programming' and 'scripting' are used in the
context of the application of the language at the time the
programmer/scripter is using it.

I think that Perl has grown over time. If Perl could produce optimsed
compiled code without the interpreter attached, would it change what the
actual language is or what the end result 'tool' is? It would be nice to
see a gcc perl compiler, which would include or exclude the interpreter
engine based on whether the target perl source program contained exec'ed
code or not.

Dale.
