&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to start an application with some sort of flag so that it will
&gt; start and immediately go into the background.
&gt; 
&gt; My reason for this is I have an application I want to start at system startup
&gt; on my Rh 6.1 server, and if I put it in my rc.local file the system will stop
&gt; booting when it loads the application.

as another poster said, "&" will often work. However, you may want to
so something more sophisticated... If the application is designed for
this (and if it isn't, and is either your own, or is open source, it
is possible to modify it so it is), then it may be possible to run it
in daemon mode. Most apps that do this will accept a "-D" flag, but
check the doco for your app first. Also, you may want to adapt an
existing startup script -- check /etc/rc.d/init.d/* (or /etc/init.d/*,
depending on your distro) and pick an app that behaves as you want
yours to, and modify the startup script. This way you can get "start",
"stop", "restart", and so on for free. This is usually used for
server-type applications -- ie those that run as a non-user (root,
daemon, mail, etc), and serve some sort of client application in some
way -- they are usually not directly interactive, interacting only
with the client program. If your app doesn't really fit into this
category (and can't sensibly be made to do so), then it probably shouldn't
be started at startup... :) 

HTH

I do have a question about this kind of thing -- If you want to run
some daemon program as a specific user (eg it is a user's fetchmail),
then what do you do? Do you set up an rc script to start it as that user?
I can't think of any intelligent way to run a user daemon at startup,
independant of whether that user has logged in or not -- maybe I'm
missing something incredibly obvious here?
