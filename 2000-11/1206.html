G'day Danny,
I'm replying to give you encouragement as I've recently been thru the
wait & see stage and am still in the process of installing.
I bought PC Format (over $20-) coz it advertised mandrake 7. I found
someone with a dvd & berner but it turned out the distro was Suzi?!
I went to linux meeting & bought RedHat7 after hearing amazing stories
of installs taking only a few minutes. There were no instructions so
thort it was auto-run wiz type install. Read up on partitioning, did a
disk scan & defrag & tried to work out disk druid and Fdisk without
blowing away the other popular o/s (& it aint Mac). We learn early not
to mention that other one.
To cut a long story short(er) I posted my real name, address & ph. no to
the group & offered a slab of beer ( & I don't drink) to anyone offering
assistance. I did get a reply from Queensland & a very helpful person
actualy came out & four hours later & numerous visits to the bios for
boot sequence changes, we had it! ...so i thort.
The gui fires up but not much happens & then freezes. Yeah crash, just
like....
It only accesses 64 of my 128mg ram?
Then I found the 2nd install disk, but it wont pick up from where disk 1
left off to continue the install (that's why the list boxes were there
but not functioning)
Wot they don't tell you:
The printer will probably not work.
If it's an internal modem it will definately probably not work.
All this is seen as a great source of mirth by everyone else & may even
start something like the "which distro is best" war.
So wot do I have? No internet, not even a word processor.
Hey don't be too discouraged, I listened to a music cd on it once.
Wot a woftam!
Will the person who has the book from the library please return it soon.

Peace love & biodynamic rice from a fair- trade zone.
Noel..
p.s. Danny, don't forget not to post in html.
