&gt; There's been a lot of talk about "winmodems" on this and other
&gt; lists.  But AFAICT nobody has described how they work. 

Part of the problem is that the term "winmodem" is generic,
and appears to be used to describe several classes of modems.
The usage I most commonly associate it with is where the main
CPU does most of the DSP work.

&gt; I accidentally bought a PCMCIA "winmodem" a couple of weeks
&gt; ago--nothing on the box or even on the docco CD pointed to the fact,
&gt; and it wasn't any cheaper than my current PCMCIA modem.  I couldn't
&gt; get it to work, of course, but it wasn't completely dead.  It
&gt; understood the "AT" command and responded correctly.  In fact, it
&gt; understood anything starting with "AT" and came back and said "OK",
&gt; regardless of the command.  That's not usable, but it's not as
&gt; completely brain-dead as I would have expected a winmodem to be.  Can
&gt; anybody shed any light on how these things are supposed to work?

Part of the problem has been the extreme lack of documentation on
the manufacturers' part (this applies with most modems - I had a
heck of a time trying to get voice operation working with my
Tasmanian Devil modem until I stumbled across some Hayes
documentation for another modem that was 99% compatible, but at
least it still functioned like a data modem).  I have heard (but
not used) modems like the one it sounds like you were using; a
controller just smart enough to do some of the call control
(off-hook, switching voice paths, etc), and possibly even doing
the codec related work (A to D and back again), but no more than
that - the rest is up to the host to implement.

You would think that if it was in the manufacturer's best interest
to sell more modems, they'd be more likely to give the specs. and
internal details away, wouldn't you?
