Thanks Daryl
It's all working very well right now, I've strung a few scripts together to
make user & homedir creation a bit easier.
Webmin's custom commands are quite good, they allow you to put a parameter
(or 2 or 3) and pass them to scripts, so type in the username
& they get a home directory, permission changes to suit & get put in the
necessary groups, all in less than a second.
Last time I did all that with NT it took a liiiiittle bit longer!!
Cheers

		Sorry Peter - I didn't see this until now, because of the
null
		subject line (it got threaded with a really old message, and
		I have ~2500 emails in my inbox at the moment).

		&gt; Here's my modification to it, but it gives the following
errors:
		&gt; --Unexpected EOF while looking for `''
		&gt; --Line 9: syntax error
		&gt; It has me a bit confused, cause there's only 8 lines!

		That's because it's looking for something, and fell of the
end of
		the file looking for it.

		&gt; I'm sure the syntax is probably up the creek, but I'm not
sure where.
		&gt; (script newbies are a pain aren't they!)
		&gt; TIA
		&gt; 
		&gt; #!/bin/sh
		&gt; 
		&gt; awk -F:`
		&gt; {
		&gt;         # Build the option line for useradd
		&gt;         opt = "-u " $2 "" $1
		&gt;         system("useradd -n -c -M -d /dev/null -s
/bin/false " opt)
		&gt; }' /home/fred/smbpasswd

		Easy.  "-F:`" should read "-F: '".  No matching backtick
(which you
		didn't want anyway). (and you've probably solved this by now
...)
