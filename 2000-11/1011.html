Greetings, (Another Sunday morning rable)

What about the 'warrantee' on software?  Has anyone EVER claimed
against Microsoft's warrentee?  

Dan Schearer had some interesting things to to say yesterday at the
AUUG's Open Source Symposium tregarding the Open Source Software(OSS)
business models that we have seen (and haven't seen yet..)

With OSS, the claim can be made, (and apparently it was on some Y2K
disclaimers).. "With this product you have all the information you
need to fix any problem that may occur."

--
Problem:
--------
Regarding copying of software, I know of people who are unscrupulus in
this area.  These are the same people who copy tapes, video's,
computer games, thrive on Napster and will be queuing up when DVD-RW
hit's the shelves.

Some of these people run companies.

Solutions:
----------
Justify it...

  How can software be though of as 'property' when units of software
  are virtually boundless.  You can't 'use up' software.[1]

Legitimize it..

  Why can't I argue that.. "If I make a copy, and give it to someone,
  then arn't I doing the marketing job for the author and should
  expect some income from this?" (I should certainly be able to claim
  for the cost of the media.)  Not a very good argument when you think
  about books, but this is relevent when company income is then
  generated online, eg. the AOL giveaway CD (just leave us your credit
  card details) model.  [Why anyone would copy a AOL CD though is
  beyond me..]

  If revenue is generated via an online service model, maybe a
  solution is to develop software, funded through service offerings
  and give away the inital 'seed' software, and download updates.

Dilema:

  Wouldn't it then be morally wrong to use your AOL provided pppd to
  access another service providers?


-----
[1] - Maybe software can be used up, as in made obsolete.  For truth
      in 'disclaimers', maybe the disclaimer on all non-free licenced
      software should read:

      "This product has been guarrenteed not to do everything that you
      require it to do (bugs or otherwise), and to do things that you
      don't need. (We will try and convince you otherwise.) We are
      required to do this so that you become one of our valued
      customers, and we can continue to sell you software in the
      future.  We can then continue to produce dividends for our
      owners and to pay our lawyers, marketing staff, managers,
      lawyers and developers."

      "If the media that this software comes on is faulty in anyway,
      we will replace it.  If you require the software in another
      format, please use the enclosed form to order it free of charge."
