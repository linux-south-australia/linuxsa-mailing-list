Gday all  Im seeking help to get started on the LINUX  revolutionI cant
read books all my life.  I have a maxtor 1 gig H/D with a old win3.1/dos
6.2  install, and am hoping to use it as a dedicated LINUX drive.  My
problem is I not sure how to format the drive so  I can then partion it
(using FDISK) and still be able to add cdrom drivers  etc.  Do I still need
dos on the drive so it will boot up  after I have formated ?
Is the format c: or format c: /s commands valid  ? If i did a low level
format so drive was completely  clean, what files do i need on a floppy to
reboot and begin Fdisk (besides Fdisk  )  I have a full install of DEFINITE
LINUX 7.0 on a cd  from a LINUX format magazine..  Any help would be good,
I guess some of you guys  have been there before  Danny



if the machine is going to be a dedicated linux box, there is
no need for dos on the machine at all.

you can use dos fdisk to create your primary linux and your swap 
partitions. these won't be formatted yet, but you can set that up
before booting into linux and running the install.

if its reasonable, you should try to have the swap partion be equal
to your RAM.

since you are running 3.1 im going to assume you have an older
machine that can't use the CD rom as a boot device.
follow the instructions on making a boot floppy and use that
to install off of cd.

im not familiar with DEFINITE LINUX but since they are all pretty
similar im imagining a lot of the stuff will be self explanitory.

you should know the irq's for any devices and also if you are going
to set up X you should know the video adapter type and the horizontal
and vertical refresh rates for your monitor.

if possible, have 2 systems, one which is getting linux installed and
another you can use to be logged into irc or the mailing list so you
can ask questions if you get stuck.

in the future, when you are more familiar with file systems, you can
go back and reinstall and partition your disk into more than just
the 2 partitions that are needed. the reinstall practice will serve
you well.

Good luck and good choice :)
