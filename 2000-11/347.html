&gt; or why not let those who get upset about HTML mail delete it.

Although not upset about it, it annoys me, so yes, I do delete the
majority of them (I can't say all - even seasoned players sometimes
are forced by "innovative" products to email in mediums beyond their
control).

It comes down to email etiquette; if you cannot acquiesce to the
wishes of the list (-maintainer), then don't be surprised when
the silence is deafening after a post.  Unfortunately, this
usually encourages the person to post again, in HTML, again, so
a polite note is usually passed their way.  Then it breaks down
into a debate like this, again.  And the cycle repeats (as most
cycles do).

&gt; I think the evidence is that HTML mail is here to stay,

I think that the manufacturers of these products should put in
"reasonable" default settings (where of course "reasonable"
means "my preferences", which is disabled).  I think that
people should press carriage return occasionally after the 70th
character or so (see Greg Lehey's web pages on the matter, at a
URL that temporarily escapes me).  None of these three points are
likely relevant.

&gt; Why can't poeple just deal with it?

For the same reasons as hashed over before; it adds little to
the topic while adding considerable to the bandwidth; some
mailers don't cope well with them.  I understand LinuxSA has a
search engine now; feel free to look up previous conversations.

The "just deal with it" attitude is unfortunately becoming all
too prevalent.  I've just "won" a long running battle over a
certain .sa.gov.au domain to fix their extremely broken return
receipts, despite ignoring all emails to postmaster.  But it
took months of consistent pressure (plus some cunning scripts)
before they would fix it.  People only fix problems if it
directly affects _them_, not others.

&gt; You can't enforce your own preferences on a free-for-all mailing
&gt; list of 400+ people (what are we up to now?). It's impossible.

I believe English is spoken quite freely here, often over SMTP.
They're my preferences.
