&gt; Every cable you put up overhead is another company you have to negotiate
&gt; with to have it moved. Currently you have in South Australia you have
&gt; ETSA, Telstra and optus(I belive).. Optus may not be using their cable
&gt; but it was installed... Do you really want a few more there. You also
&gt; have problems with trees and people growing vines up stobie poles.

I've heard of trials in England where they're trialling data over power
cable to provide broadband access.  Currently Power lines can transmit a
signal at a frequency, but its used to switch hot water services and things
on and off, and its not a very fast line.  I'm not sure of the name of the
actual technology, but thats just the rumour I've heard.

Imagine being able to get highspeed data from your wall powerplug.  The age
of the internet-toaster will be lumped on us then.  Forseeable problems may
be downtime due to power outages,  but then, computers don't work too well
in those situations anyway.
