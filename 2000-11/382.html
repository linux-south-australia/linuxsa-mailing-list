Suse 6.4 Canon BJC 4550.


This response is encouraging. 

I remember talking to Canon people a couple of years ago about Linux
support and being given short shift. They have continued to drag their
feet. Ghost Script has carried the day but we miss out on a lot of
features available to Windows users. 

Unfortunately for Canon the horse may have allready bolted. Lexmark are
getting good reports and I understand have made genuine attempts to
provide software for Linux users. This is probably where I will look for
my next printer.

&gt; As an update to my recent posting (re: dialogue with Canon Inc. for Linux
&gt; drivers for my BJC-5000 WinPrinter &lt;spit&gt;), I have, indeed, received a
&gt; response from Canon Australia.
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, Canon Australia advise me:
&gt; 
&gt; - they received a copy of my letter to Canon Inc.
&gt; - apologise for not responding to my original letter (it apparently wasn't
&gt; received)
&gt; - thank me for my patronage, and gave me an InfoLine number and their
&gt; web-site address for more info.
&gt; 
&gt; plus, this paragraph:
&gt; 
&gt; "Presently Canon do not offer drivers for the Linux operating system but we
&gt; are advised that Canon Inc. (the parent company) are currently reviewing
&gt; this situation and evaluating the possible development of Linux drivers for
&gt; probable release late next year. We are also informed that they will be
&gt; looking at opportunities to advance on this schedule and that, once
&gt; released, we expect these will be made available for downloading from the
&gt; Canon Australia Website."
&gt; 
&gt; The InfoLine number provided was: (02) 9805-2864.
&gt; 
&gt; If you call Canon's Adelaide office, phone (08) 8201-9100, and ask for
&gt; technical support for your printer, they should be able to put your call
&gt; through to the InfoLine without the need to dial an interstate number. (I
&gt; would guess that anybody could call their respective State Canon office for
&gt; the same diversion).
&gt; 
&gt; Since the Linux situation is supposedly under consideration at the moment,
&gt; perhaps some more enquiries by other Linux users to Canon asking for Linux
&gt; drivers can influence the result of their "review".  And, of course, we
&gt; want Linux drivers that are officially endorsed by Canon and/or written by
&gt; the manufacturers, who best understand the way our device operates - after
&gt; all, we don't want to feed our sophisticated equipment just any old code to
&gt; keep it going! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Real hope for Linux users ? (or a lame attempt to keep a disgruntled user
&gt; quiet for a while?)
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has an EPSON or HP (or, perhaps any other brand, for that
&gt; matter), they could get onto the phone, too, and ask them for a Linux
&gt; driver.  When advised that Linux isn't supported, they could let them know
&gt; that they've heard that Canon are reviewing their situation on Linux - and
&gt; a quick whisper into their ear that they'd might want to look into Linux
&gt; themselves (after all, they wouldn't want to get left behind, would they?)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
