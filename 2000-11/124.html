&gt; Now John, I'm sure you know we're talking about a single modem and an
&gt; overpowered CPU.  After all, anybody who's run a large data warehouse knows
&gt; that you can't beat storage area networks for speed, but let's both agree
&gt; that banks of modems, like SAN, are not relevant to this discussion.

On the contrary, I'm running one box that has the equivalent of 310
winmodems in it, with 6 decent Motorola CPU's. For some reason it has
none of the normal problems associated with winmodems, probably because
it doesn't run windows but mostly because it is using DSP's in addition
to CPU's. This box also has the luxury of being connected through fibre
to the exchange rather than garden variety copper.

&gt; Perhaps, but that's true of all cheap modems, isn't it?  I mean, you don't
&gt; seriously expect us to believe that moving the CPU from the modem enclosure
&gt; to the mother board makes a difference, do you?

Experience tells me that it does. With established modem companies like
Lucent and Rockwell making modems since the BBS days, you'd think all
they have to do to make a winmodem is write some software to emulate
their existing chipsets. With the 3 years it's taken to get winmodems
into something workable, let alone better than a standalone modem, it
seems that it's been a little more difficult than that.

It's also worth knowing that a Rockwell 56K modem chip cost around $5 in
lots of 1000 last time I looked. The price difference between normal
modems and winmodems is probably a result of middle-men pricing
winmodems as the crap they are, and charging a premium for the now
superior 'real' modems.

John Carmack had some nice things to say about winmodems and their
potential for lower latency connections, so perhaps when there's an open
source V91 codec available we can start to see some cool stuff happen.
