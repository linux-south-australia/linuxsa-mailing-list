&gt; Which is an entirely reasonable point of view.  The Stallman's and 2600's of
&gt; the world would hold that it's harmless to give away software that you
&gt; bought, but they are wrong.  Firstly, the author of software is quite
&gt; reasonably entitled to say who may use that creation and in what manner, and
&gt; it has long been the norm that software is not sold, but is licensed for use

I use linux, open/free/cheap software because it's cheap/free and I'm not
a rich guy - and I like the feeling of being back in control (even when I
get totally lost and stuffed up).

I sometimes say to people 'use linux, it's cheap/free' and they say 'heck,
I get codes etc off the web and use copies of win software for free'. But
see, they are stealing, whatever. I don't really care and frankly due to
MS practices don't feel sorry for bill...

BUT I don't want to steal the shit. I like using legally free/cheap/open
stuff and feel happy about it. Sure, I may have occasionally been on the
wrong side with some software and maybe had 95 installed on 2 machines,
but my attitude is I don't use them at the same time and frankly use them
buggar all considering the money I spent, so bill has done well. Recently
I even bought the full copy of ME (at a ridiculous $400 for a fairly
ordinary repackage and slight upgrade) so that I would have an extra
licence rather than get tied up with some crap with an upgrade from 95.

I'd like to see more people getting more for their work with linux, but
then I happily do stuff for nothing when I can (I just wish I could
progress past working with ncurses and move into some gui stuff :-)  I
seem to have lost the ability to learn anything at the moment!)

As for the statement above... I really think MS has not put enough of the
cash back into a better product. Win2000 might be better than 3.1, but the
3.1-&gt;95-&gt;98&gt;ME progress has been a bit of a joke... Too much money goes
elsewhere and no amount of marketting (or controlling the market, buying
the opposition, etc) makes the product better.

But who cares. Linux is great and I don't see it vanishing in the near
future...
