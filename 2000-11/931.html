&gt; Well, I asked for it, didn't I :-) The whole lot went around 10 minutes

&gt; I think this means that anyone else who is embarrassed by old computer

Any of the cobwebs left!!!

I have a bunch of old pc stuff, but I collect it. It's amazing how it gets
used eventually when someone dumps their old pc here to fix. Anyway, I
doubt the demand would be as high up here in NQ. Not sure too many know
what a PC is :-)

I do have a Dick Smith VZ-200 and an Amstrad CPC464 probably stuffed.
Actually the VZ200 is not original anyway. I pulled it out of the plastic
boxes and hard wired all the bits together. Had to change the chip and a
resister on the printer port coz there was a design fault there, and I
ripped off the keyboard and wired my own matrix onto a 'real' keyboard.
I'm still amazed I did anything with a machine that had 2k video and 6k
mem - plus 16k dynamic ram... And still had a wp and learned assembly on
it...

The 32 column screen was a killer, tho still did wp with the thing. Not
exactly wysiwyg, but the output was still on a 80 col dot matrix. 

Shit my P120 looks good again... maybe I don't need that upgrade.
