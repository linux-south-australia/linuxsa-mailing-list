&gt;&gt; I infer you mean that WinModems are inferior hardware.  Inferior to what?
&gt; To current, state of the art standards.

I don't see how.  I suppose they are all v.90, which is current state of the
art.  Best of all, when "they" work out how to squeeze 56k both ways, and
assuming that the data pump is up to the task, a new driver will be
sufficient to upgrade the modem.  Sure modern "hardware" modems have flash
upgradeable firmware, but they don't have the luxury of effectively
limitless ROM, so all bets are off that the new firmware will fit in the old
hardware.  I'd say it sounds like WinModems are superior to other state of
the ard hardware.

&gt;&gt; Inferior to one of those x2 modems that are NOT v.90 compatible, and
which
&gt;&gt; are not upgradeable?
&gt; Do they still exist?

Spoken like one who never bought one! :-)

&gt; some people can't or don't want to use their CPU for something a dedicated
modem chipset can
&gt; do. I certainly don't, but I like to optimise my system for speed.

Many modems have quite slow CPUs.  Using your host CPU may actually
outperform these dedicated devices.  I'm minded of the time when MS-DOS disk
compression hit the market.  At that time 486 CPUs where the norm, and hard
disk controllers were quite slow.  Many systems (reportedly) ran faster
using CPU compression because of lower volume of data transfered.
