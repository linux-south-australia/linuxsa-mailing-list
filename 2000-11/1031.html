Greg!

&gt; That's interesting.  I don't see any reason not to hang fibre from
&gt; power masts.  In the last 3 years, I've had my phones cut off 4 times
&gt; for over a day (longest was 5 days) as a result of backhoe damage.
&gt; That won't happen if it's 10 metres up in the air.  And it's a lot
&gt; cheaper to lay for people in outlying places like where I live.

Generally overhead cables look rather dreadful and decrease the ambient
niceness of an area. You'll note that in many new developments the
cabling is and must be placed underground. It costs approximately $10000
per metre (yes it is that high) to take overhead underground. It's a lot
easier to install the cables underground at the start than to string
even more services above ground...

Underground cables generally:

* don't get blown over by wind
* don't cause street trees to be lopped
* are less likely to cause fires
* don't get done in by backhoes if people are actually a little more
careful about what they're doing and are used to having the cables
underground

I can see your point in the cables being cheaper to place above ground,
but I think - and this is my opinion - that cable should be installed
underground where budget, technical feasibility and perhaps the absence
of people with backhoes ( :-P it's a joke ) exist...
