Danny,

Good thinking!
Manuals are for computer science students.
Point-and-click should be sufficient for all computing.
If the Mac could do it in 1984, then why should we need
manuals in the next millennium?
You can't have a normal social life _and_ read computer manuals!
Look at anyone who reads computer manuals, and you'll see
what I mean.

Anyway, ......

&gt; I have a maxtor 1 gig H/D with a old win3.1/dos 6.2 install, and am hoping to use it as a dedicated LINUX drive.

If you're happy to part with the old win3.1 and dos6.2 software, things
will be easier.

&gt; 
&gt; My problem is I not sure how to format the drive so I can then partion it (using FDISK) and still be able to add cdrom drivers etc.
&gt; 

All good distributions will take care of this all for you
- just point and click!!!

&gt; Do I still need dos on the drive so it will boot up after I have formated ?

Not unless you really want it.
Keeping dos on the drive means _lots_ of hard work.
It's better to get rid of it.

&gt; Is the format c: or format c: /s commands valid ?

Before or after you install linux?

&gt; If i did a low level format so drive was completely clean, what files do i need on a floppy to reboot and begin Fdisk (besides Fdisk )
&gt; 

Any mainstream distribution will do all the formatting necessary.
It's a waste of time to format the drive manually in advance.

&gt; I have a full install of DEFINITE LINUX 7.0 on a cd from a LINUX format magazine..
&gt; 

Ah, a UK distribution at <A HREF="http://www.definitelinux.com/.">http://www.definitelinux.com/.</A>

&gt; Any help would be good, I guess some of you guys have been there before

Well, the best advice is to just stick the CD in the CD drive, and
point and click!
That's if you don't mind losing all your old software on the disk.


Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS. If you want to consider the other linux distributions, they're listed here:
