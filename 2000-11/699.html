Daniel!

&gt; I'm using an EPOX socket 7 MB and an AMD K6-2 400 o/c to 500 which has been running nicely for
&gt; nearly a year now.  Usually I would either replace the MB or CPU but I can't figure out why the
&gt; system decides to boot at different intervals.

I am going to be as nice as possible here. You have overclocked a chip
from 400 to 500. And now you are experiencing hardware problems which
are intermittent after nearly a year. I note that you possibly are a
student, so I may forgive you on age but:

1) Do chips have speed ratings for no purpose?

No. Overclocking generally eventually kills them. And it voids the
warranty.

2) If we don't follow the instructions of the universe, can we expect
things to behave normally?

No.

It boots at different intervals because it's an intermittent (look your
dictionary up) problem. 

The short of this little note is that overclocking WILL not probably
will but WILL shorten the life of your CPU. I supsect, for your CPU,
it's game over.
