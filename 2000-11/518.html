Dale!

&gt; Is this with AVP running as a resident process where the virus databases
&gt; are loaded into memory once, or when AVP is loaded per use?

AmaViS' web site seems to think that it takes a lot of resources. When I
first installed it at a place I work it crashed our mail server (which
wasn't a terribly fast machine, but nonetheless). I discovered that AVP
for Linux Daemon (resident process) simply didn't work. It wouldn't
detect the EICAR.COM test virus whereas the AVP for Linux non-daemon
which loads the databases pe use would.

&gt; I have noticed that AVP have added some nice features in the current
&gt; release at www.avp.com.au, including some mail integration.

That appears to have been around when I was looking at it. I must
confess I'd just encounteed the "AVP for Linux Daemon" won't detect
virus problems and if I remember the mail integration then required the
daemon...hence I was rather sceptical and I couldn't hack the code to
see what was going wrong.

&gt; I have not
&gt; looked at this yet. It may be better integrated than Amavis/AVP.

I hope their documentation improves at some stage...

&gt; I found that Amavis requires a wrapper for reporting for some clients.

Wrapper? In what manner? It's always done what I've wanted it to do...
