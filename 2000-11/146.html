Andrew!

&gt; Aren't regular expressions tricky?

Yes. That's why they're called regular [1] :-)

&gt; You need to be very careful about
&gt; what you say. (And David, I'm not having a go here - I can't recall the
&gt; number of times I've gotten a regexp wrong. I just want to help out
&gt; anyone that may try to get the regexp you've written to work, and can't
&gt; do so :-)

I don't have a problem when people point out that I have made a mistake
when I actually have made a mistake.
 
&gt; Firstly, in the regexp above, "D" and "d" will match the letters "D" and
&gt; "d", respectively. What you really want is "\D" and "\d" to match a non
&gt; digit and a digit. Or, if you prefer, "\D" is the same as [^0-9] and
&gt; "\d" is the same as [0-9].

That's correct. The sed/awk home pages, perldoc -k regexp and such will
help here.

&gt; So, in the assumed simple case that David was writing this regexp for,
&gt; it probably would have worked as expected. But move it to the big wide
&gt; world, and the explanation would have kept you wondering what was going
&gt; on.

Agreed. I tend to write the regular expression, run it through many test
cases and fine tune until it's correct. Using the "x" modifier at the
end can make it far more understandable..

&gt; Thought - I don't claim to be an absolute master of regexps, or a good
&gt; public speaker, but would people be interested in a LinuxSA talk about
&gt; regular expression and how they work (with most of the examples in Perl,
&gt; seeing that's what I know?)

Why not? We could make it a regular thing...

this is a regular !@#$ expression seems silly to me!/

Very powerful, but the syntax is baffling to say the least. I seem to
recall that one can write DES as a PERL regular expression, which in the
past made some T-Shirts military weapons in the U.S :-)
