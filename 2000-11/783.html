&gt; Also when I get home from work around 5 I start it and it doesn't work
then.
&gt; Then when I reboot it usually doesn't work either. ..but it's working now
?????
&gt;
&gt; Funny though I haven't had that much trouble today (Monday) compared to
the 'HOT' w/e we just
&gt; had.
&gt;
&gt; Any more suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; I can't understand why it is working now and not other occasions when I
don't
&gt; touch a thing and the temp. doesn't change.  Is this just my lack of
knowlage of PC
&gt; componants?

A rare possibiltiy is that the case is flexing during hotter weather and
shorting out on something.

Another rare possibility could be if you're running an LS-120 Drive - these
things are notorious for doing crazy things to POST sequences.

BUT

Try replacing your powersupply.  If the powersupply is supplying incorrect
power (due to something shorting out inside or wear or something, whatever)
then that can cause weirdness in hardware.  Replace it with a known good,
its a definite possibility that this is the source of your probs.

Also try unplugging/replacing your ide/fdd devices - if one of these has
dodgy power circuitry, they can do the same thing.  I had an ls-120 drive
with a faulty pcb that would cause the computer to not turn on when cold,
but you'd turn it on and off at the wall a half-dozen times, and then it
would boot.

Bad Power in a system can do all sorts of strangeness.
