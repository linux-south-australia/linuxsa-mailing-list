I feel that all children should be exposed to all O/Ss.
Unfortunately it seems that MS is pushing their products and no-one else has
taken their lead.
All parents can do is speakup at the P&C meetings and voice their opinion.
If YOU don't who will.

Regards
Phil Garbode

Worse. They have been targetting schools also. There are schools
offering MCP. Microsoft had a propaganda-fest a while ago, where
Microsoft spoke to the Catholic Schools about the whole thing. They'd
like MCP done by yr10 and the possibility of MCSE by the end of yr12.
It's a problem. Schools should remain product independent.
