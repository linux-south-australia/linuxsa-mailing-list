given that most isp's will give you a static IP for around $100, add $900 or
so, and for many small businesses this sorta connection would be good for a
low volume mail / web server give or take 5 mins down time per day.

&gt;&gt;  &gt; Traffic and set up costs probably cost more than 6 phone calls a day for
a
&gt;&gt;  &gt; few years I would think.
&gt;&gt;  &gt; Cos seems to be avlid reason to me.
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt; 6 x $0.25 x 365 = $547.50
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Plus the $20 - 40 per month you're probably paying for your net access
&gt;&gt; (let's be middle-of-the-road and say that's costing you $300 per year).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So all up you're spending nearly $900 per year on Internet access.
&gt;&gt; And you claim you're doing it that way to save you money.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Now do the sums for a fairly constant download  say a napster kid or a
&gt;warez junky on a 56k modem at say 18 cents a meg.
&gt;
&gt;The dial up option.
&gt;A $30 leach acount a 6 phone calls a day does not sound too bad.
&gt;$360 account access.
&gt;2190 phone calls @ 40cents ( I don't know how much a local call is these
&gt;days - I actually suspect it is cheaper)
&gt;$876.
&gt;line ~ $20 a month?
&gt;$240
&gt;
&gt;Total $1476
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The permament otpion:
&gt;Whereas say 10 meg an hour * 18 cents a meg * 24 hours *365 days.
&gt;10*.18*24*365 =$15768.
&gt;
&gt;Admittedly  most people probably don't won't suck
&gt;down that much, however even if you only sucked down 10% of that you are
&gt;still loking better than a permantnet link, for which cost I hanve't
&gt;factored in line rental, or any calls, though these are admitedly likely
&gt;to be few.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand you can get more than 10meg an hour with a56K mdoem.
&gt;And data is not usually .18 a meg for most people.
&gt;
&gt;I also acknowledge taht many accoutns have a 200 or so meg download limti
&gt;after you get chanrge 20 cnets or more for data, btu then again soem ahve
&gt;no download limit (after all with a nice set of sqirm redirectors anda
&gt;fat cache how much is the data really costing the isp?)
&gt;
&gt;If you can come up with better pricing, then let me
&gt;know.
&gt;I have two friends who both recently got leach accounts to compliemtn
&gt;their dial up permanent links with telstra direct/advacnde/whatever it si 

&gt;these days.
&gt;
&gt;One of them sucked down 300 meg last weekend -  he likes to try differnet
&gt;distros.
&gt;
&gt;Can you suggest any where you can suck down 1200 meg for about $30 a
&gt;month on a permanent link?
&gt;Because they and I would both love to take that option up thanks.
&gt;
&gt;Another scenario. The games player, say 10 meg an hour(a delieberate under

&gt;estimate - I think is really 12 -14 meg), 19 cents a meg, 4 hours a nights

&gt;4 nights a week, probably one call per night if you live in the metro
&gt;area.
&gt;(.19*40) + 40  $8 a night.
&gt;4 nigths a week $32.
&gt;52 weeks a year 
&gt;$32 *52
&gt;=$1664
&gt;
&gt;Already exceeds your $976,and that is without MP3s, web surfing and
&gt;sending those godawful 10 meg attachemnts these people love to send.
&gt;
&gt;And you claim a pemrant link is cheaper.
&gt;
&gt;Like I said I can see a case for a $30 or $40 dollar a month account and 6

&gt;redials a day.
&gt;
&gt;Not for all applications and not for all peopel but a peemanent link is
&gt;not necessarily cheaper if you suck data.
&gt;
&gt;I think I have given a couple  scenarios that show that the permanet link
&gt;can be and typcially is more expensive.
&gt;
&gt;Most fo the peopel I knwo with permanet linsk are failry careful about how

&gt;much they sue the net and use it less than they moght othwerise because of

&gt;dat charges.
&gt;
&gt;And if you can disprove me, by offering me a permanent account that
&gt;for $50 or less a month lets me suck down over a gig a month with noe exta

&gt;data charges , then you have yourself a new subscriber, and I would be happy

&gt;to retract my claims. 
&gt;(and quite possibly kiss your #$! in victroia square*)
&gt;
&gt;I am not however holding my breath.
