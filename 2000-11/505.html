* Subject: no computers day
*
* i told a user who was calling about an illegal operation error that it was
* 'No Computers Day' and that all the computers had been disabled.
* I told her that she may as well go home. I wished her a happy day and
* hung up.
*
* i thought i better follow up on this one. i heard her raised voice while
* still about 4m from her desk 'why cant she work just because it's no
* computer day'. she had already called admissions to ask them what
* they were doing without the use of their computers, but did not get to
* speak to the person she wanted.
*
* she told me she was seriously considering going home when i walked
* through the door.
*
* i am not kidding.

Userland. A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. ;]
