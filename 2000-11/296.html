&gt;So the question now is, why is HTTP downloads of pages so much slower ?

If a single FTP download is just as fast as the big proxy, yet http is
slower, could this perhaps be some sort of multitasking issue with the
smaller box?

Getting something via FTP involves a single fetch from the remote server.
HTTP nowadays involves fetching multiple objects, first the HTML page, then
dozens of images that a web designer somewhere added to give (or so they
thought) the information more appeal. Modern browsers take advantage of this
by attempting to load multiple images simultaneously .. something which is
nearly pointless on a modem link, but fair enough on a high-speed link where
there are different sorts of bottlenecks.

Each Image in a web page will also require a seperate connection to the
proxy server (in theory http/1.1 and persistant connections should negate
this..). Perhaps your proxy is doing an authentication routine, ident check,
or reverse lookup on every connection, that gives the page the appearance of
loading slowly?

You could always try speed testing web pages from the web server running on
the same system as the proxy, via the proxy. At least then you might be able
to eliminate the network interface from the problem.

How fast are your downloads through this proxy at the moment anyway? Even
with a pretty powerful (but busy)array of squid boxes, I see downloads go
down to 110KB/s when they would go over 200KB/s otherwise, but I'm also not
on the same subnet as those servers.
