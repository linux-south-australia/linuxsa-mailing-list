Dale and others,

People interested in comparing linux distributions might like to
look at my little list of about 50 linux distributions:

   <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/linux.html">http://www.topology.org/linux.html</A>#os

I've even linked some other people's lists  and lists of lists
of linux distributions.

Anyone care to sort these 50 distributions in order of goodness -
according to a range of criteria?
As Peter Plus once said about Russia and Afghanistan competing
in the 1980 Olympics javelin, 
"The winner is the neatest correct entry".

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS. If anyone has been noticing an alarming increase in
the number of TCP port 139 probes in Australian IP space
by Australian hosts since the beginning of October 2000,
it turns out that this might not be a mounting army of zombies
but rather a break-out of a dodgy version of McAfee virus scan
software. It seems that
McAfee VirusScan version 4.02 with data file 4086
(and possibly other variations) goes off and scans neighbouring
IP addresses continuously all day.
Not good for the per-MByte volume charges of people who have to
pay for their own Internet link, I think!
