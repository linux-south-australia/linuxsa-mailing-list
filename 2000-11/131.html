& is your friend here.

./myscript &

Calls myscript and places it into the background.

In your script, after each thing has happened, you can use

echo "has finished" | Mail <A HREF="mailto:user@domain.com.au">user@domain.com.au</A> -s "Task A"

Subject: Re: extract marked infix from filename with bash script?


&gt; Hi, I've sorted out the problem using bash's parameter expansion:
&gt;
&gt; (from memory)
&gt; HEAD=${INFILE%%.template.rc}
&gt; HEAD=${HEAD##*.p}
&gt;
&gt; this leaves just the number following the .p
&gt;
&gt; But I can't figure out how to nest this so I don't have to re-refer to
&gt; $HEAD (it seems inelegant, but I'm happy that it works)
&gt;
&gt; On the same project I'd like to know how I can get a script to drop itself
&gt; into the background; the script calls some very long running processes
&gt; (weeks) in the background, and I'd like it to wait in the background for
&gt; them to finish and then email to the user that they have finished. Any
&gt; ideas?

&gt; &gt; &gt;         I'm writing a script to set up batch jobs on a Beowulf at the

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I vaguely remember that you may have been a PHD or masters student at
&gt; &gt; the University and this was one of your projects. If you are, how's
&gt; &gt; things going with it?
&gt;
&gt; Nope, that's not me, I think you are thinking of Evan Bourlotos who has
&gt; posted about bits to do with a masters in CS.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's the problem: how do I extract a number in an infix from a
filename where the infix is of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; form '.pN.' (where N is the number)?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Because I don't have an example of an actual file name (it would be
&gt; &gt; useful), a perl regular expression such as:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; s/.*\.D(d)+.*/$1/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ...reads "match any character, but when you see one single dot, followed
&gt; &gt; by a non-digit, followed by one or more digits, save that for later and
&gt; &gt; call it $1". I think you need something that will match the pattern and
&gt; &gt; then allow you to extract just the digit parts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, I would have thought that sed would be able to find it given that
&gt; &gt; it works with (slightly different) regular expressions but I hope that
&gt; &gt; this tip helps.
&gt;
&gt; I had a look through the sed manual too; I need to brush up on my regexps,
&gt; but I think that what you have above should work with sed. Thanks.

&gt; &gt; If only all employers were nice enough to include the sorry part (or did
&gt; &gt; you add it manually)...
&gt;
&gt; The original disclaimer is 12 lines long, I paraphrased (as you'll not
&gt; the disclaimer doesn't follow the normal legalese) and apologised.
