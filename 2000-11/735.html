An act in one part with lots of cursing!

I sat on the floor on Sunday cursing and replacing fans on the hot-swap
canisters.  When I had checked the backs of the canisters with my hand, I
could not feel any air coming out of them, so I pulled the machine around
to have a look.

In three of the canisters, the fans were fluttering forlornly back and
forward, and clearly weren't moving lots of air. So, fearing that the
(ever-so-reliable Seagate 10,000RPM SCSI) drives would shut down from
overheating, I shut the machine down and replaced the fans.  (We had spare
fans because fans had failed before.)

We were lucky that I had decided to check the drives, because they might
have decided to shutdown in the middle of a busy work day, causing untold
amounts of misery (especially for me).

But I had lots to curse about. Firstly, there was SSI who made the
canisters and used those cheap fans.  Then there was the decision, two
years ago, to use SSI.  It seemed like a good idea at the time, but they
clearly weren't in it for the long haul.  The latest model were even worse,
with the fans giving up after only a couple of months.

Those fans have proven to be the weakest link in our whole high-reliability
strategy. The RAID controllers, on the whole have been reliable, especially
after we found the two canisters where the drives were wired up slightly
wrongly (with one SCSI ID pin unconnected, so the drives occassionally
changed IDs and locked the whole bus up). The drives have been super
reliable, even continuing to work after shutting down when overheating. Its
been those damn fans that have caused all the problems.

So, when someone asks you to pay a little more for a fancy hot-swap
canisters with a nice big fan on the back and snazzy little carriers that
the drives mount in, think carefully about it.  Especially if you want them
to work continuously for two or more years.

Caveat emptor.
