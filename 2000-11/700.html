Damien!

&gt; 26 is not exactly an underage boy.  (And I must say that I've never
&gt; heard such a term used myself.)

Un amico chi ha venti-sette anni....alora! Excusa, ma non posso parlare
l'espognola :-)

&gt; I meant subjective as in everybody has their own definition of what
&gt; "the best" means.

No. You're confused. Everyone agrees what "the best" means in a strict,
dictionary sense - it is the superlative of good - but what they define
as the best may turn up differently. 

&gt; It cirtainly has a dictionary meaning, but it is
&gt; also a term that has a personal meaning transending the strict
&gt; definitions of modern English

It certainly does have a meaning. It cirtainly doesn't (I don't know how
cirtain modifies the verb). It is not a term that transcends the strict
definitions of modern English - its definition is solid. The examples of
it differ. I assure you that "the best" has a strict syntactical,
English definition and most if not every English speaker on this list
understands it. In an Object Oriented paradigm it would be like an
abstract class...

&gt;(which I'm sure we all know is flimsy
&gt; at best when it comes to upholding strict definitions):

We all conform to the "Australian Government Printing Services" handbook
don't we?
 
&gt; "No Marge, when kids say bad, they mean good.  And to shake your
&gt; booty, means to wiggle ones behind.  Permit me to demonstrate."

Well, a demonstration at Tuesday night's meeting could make for some
fun.

&gt; After all, we don't want this to devolve into petty pedantry, now do
&gt; we?:)

Pedantry is not, by my definition, petty. 

&gt; Had the asker specifically wished a single authorative answer, would
&gt; they not have asked a single authorative source.

Such as Bill Gates?

&gt; As such, the
&gt; existance of multiple answers (albeit from multiple sources) should
&gt; be taken as an absolute cirtainty.

No, you've missed my original point. The original person - I suspect -
meant BOTH redhat AND mandrake are in my opinion as good as each other
and they are so good that they, collectively are the best. But the
person said RedHat OR Mandrake :-)

&gt; As such the question could not
&gt; possibly have beged a singular answer.  The term "best" cirtainly
&gt; does imply singular, but the whole question in context, does not.

The "best" does have an answer. There are no questions we cannot not
answer.
 
&gt; Es sido conversación agradable con usted por el correo electrónico.
&gt; Miro adelante a hablar otra vez.

Cosa dica? Non Lei capisco!
