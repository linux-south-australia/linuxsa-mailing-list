&gt;&gt; What other broadband is there in sa?

Amcom (who's name was previously Fibretel, that should give a hint) are busy
doing a lot of work around Adelaide for business. They're also laying fibre
from Melbourne &lt;-&gt; Adelaide &lt;-&gt; Perth. This fibre is going to run through
some lucky suburbs to reach it's ingress in the Adelaide CBD. Don't bother
them too much, it's not going to be price-competitive with ADSL just yet.

ETSA officially became a carrier on November 13, and have an existing
infrastructure that they can setup data networks on. Purists will cringe at
the thought of fibre being strung from pole to pole, but ETSA have years of
experience at doing this with cables. I'm sure most readers of this list
don't care how the 100's of Mbps of bandwidth gets to the end of their
street, as long as they can have some of it at a reasonable price.

Airnet.com.au locally have a carrier licence and are apparently doing a lot
of Wireless stuff around Adelaide. There's also a wireless broadband ISP
doing something down at the new eyesore^H^H^H^H^H^Hcomplex in Glenelg.

To save Leigh from the embarrasment of a plug, Agile are also happy to give
you a broadband link. Since they're connecting places as remote as the
Coorong, they're obviously happy to provide service to more than just the
denizens of the CBD.

If Telstra insist on making access to copper unreasonably priced, it may do
Adelaide a favour when better solutions come available to fill the niche. If
I might make a plug, support an ISP that's connected to SAIX. While
cheap/fast access to the USA is important to most people at the moment,
broadband done properly will change the way we use the Internet (and the way
we live our lives..). Only an ISP peering with other ISP's locally can make
this happen, routing traffic via Melbourne back to Adelaide is not the way
of the future.
