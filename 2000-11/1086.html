&gt; &gt; cabling is and must be placed underground. It costs
&gt; &gt; approximately $10000 per metre (yes it is that high)
&gt; &gt; to take overhead underground. It's a lot easier to
&gt; &gt; install the cables underground at the start than to
&gt; &gt; string even more services above ground...
&gt; 
&gt; Most cabling contractors will quote something like $40-$60 per
&gt; metre for underground cabling (from memory), not including the
&gt; cost of seeking permission.

That will get you duct in the ground (in some places, depending
on soil and/or other existing services that might be in the way),
fibre/cable will be additional on top of that, plus labour, plus
termination of said cables.

&gt; They have some really cool digging tools that can make it under
&gt; pavement etc without needing to disturb the surface past the
&gt; starting point.

Underbore - a very cool technology - however, only suitable when
other services are sparse - otherwise you can get into real trouble :)

&gt; I imagine the $10K figure includes getting lawyers involved in
&gt; addition to electrical engineers.

$10k per metre sounds like a typo to me.  Sorry, the most I've 
ever paid for fibre/duct underground even with underbore/trench
work combined was $200/metre, and *that* was expensive.

Most duct is usually PVC btw, not steel, unless you're in a really
busy busy underground area and are paranoid about backhoe fade.

Cheers

Leigh
