Adam!

&gt; I have had rh7 for about 2 days, went back to 6.2 for a few reasons. But
&gt; most of the rpms now cannot be installed via the 6.2 rpm installer, can i
&gt; simple update the package managment installer via another rpm and go about
&gt; my days. What would the package be called?

I can't resist it. 

REDHAT PACKAGE MANAGER [1] or RPM in short...

Basically wander about ftp.mirroraarnet.edu.au/pub/redhat and look for
that tar zipped version of RPM; I've forgotten its exact location but
trust me, it's NOWHERE obvious. You'll also find it on any RedHat 6.2 CD
as a binary, but again RedHat's idea of where to put the silly thing
doesn't exactly put it in the most obvious place.

I would have thought that a symlink from the root directory of the CD
would have made sense given that it IS the package manager :-(

ooerr, fancy calling something such an OBVIOUS name
