Jason!

&gt; Weren't you castigating the modem before because you  (I suspect
&gt; erroneously)thought they needed dedicated OS support(when in fact they
&gt; only needed drivers for the OS, the OS-presumably- just reads/writes the
&gt; data to and from memory and processes the interupts just liek it does for
&gt; the network card or any other card) which was only offered by one OS?

It's already been established that there are drivers for these modems.
Perhaps you haven't been following this thread.

&gt; Are you not now castigating the OS because it supports hardware?

I said it doesn't make sense to me.

&gt; Hey newsflash, in case you didn't see my repost of the linmodem url linux
&gt; supports &lt;w|l&gt;inmodems to some extent, presumably because they
&gt; exist and people have them.

I think YOU didn't see your posting...

&gt; I guess linux is a nonsense operating system then?

You are free to guess as much as you like.

&gt; If you want to bash windows or any other given product feel free, but
&gt; please bash it with fact not fud - and a biot of logic and consitency
&gt; might be good too.

Firstly, various people have expressed different opinions about software
modems. Some, such as David Newall, believe that these modems can - in
certain circumstances - be beneficial and make better use of current
resources. Others believe that they are simply a drain on resources.
Others have taken a middle of the road, factual line and asked whether
changing software drivers and such will break laws.

Eventually I'll go for a search through the archives and pull together
the pros and cons. Enough said about the modems themselves

Now, the fact is that I believe that WinModems, or software modems, are
not a good idea. There are some on this list who also seem to share at
least part of this belief. I have been consistent and logical to a fault
throughout this whole, little debate. Others have chosen to remove parts
of what I said, take them out of context and come up with odd statements
which imply I am castigating the OS (presumably those others meant that
I was bagging Linux) when I clearly didn't even say that in the first
place.

Woe be the day when people can't say things like "I don't think we
should support XYZ in Linux" simply because when they do others turn up
and tell them that they are castigating the hardware or bagging Linux.
Woe be the day when we all must prefix any statement with "I think" or
"I believe"...I do seem to remember someone accusing this list of being
overtly pedantic.

Now, had I said I believe that WinModems are:

* stupid
(etc etc)

would it really have made a difference? I do listen to the threads and
other things that are going on - not only on this list but on many of
the others, and I'm sad to say that software modems are, at best,
tolerated but certainly not embraced. Many people who run Linux don't
run on 650MHZ Athlons, PIII's and seem to think that they are an odd
idea and not suitable for them because they don't have the resources to
use them.

It's true that they haven't labeled the modems as stupid, but if we
shift connotation and rebadge "stupid" as "not sensible" or better "not
a technically well-balanced choice" we can see the parallel. Put into
context I believe that I have argued logically all the way throughout
this little discussion; it's true that if you remove bits and pieces of
what I have said, and somehow mangle "I don't see any sense in doing
something in Linux" into "Because I don't see any sense in doing
something I'm going to castigate/bag/ridicule Linux" might be able to
find some illogicality in my arguments.

Isn't it amusing how using words such as stupid can really throw people
off track :-? One argues to win, no matter how...
