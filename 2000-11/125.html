This link
<A HREF="http://www.austel.gov.au/publications/industry/Telecommbook.pdf">http://www.austel.gov.au/publications/industry/Telecommbook.pdf</A>  is
to Austel's sexy document RE this (2M download).  The question is
whether a driver constitutes "equipment" under the Telecommunications
Act (I'm not sure:
<A HREF="http://law.agps.gov.au/html/pasteact/2/3021/0/PA000240.htm">http://law.agps.gov.au/html/pasteact/2/3021/0/PA000240.htm</A>).  It
would seem that it is an offence to hook up an uncertified device
(<A HREF="http://law.agps.gov.au/html/pasteact/2/3021/0/PA003690.htm">http://law.agps.gov.au/html/pasteact/2/3021/0/PA003690.htm</A>), and
that if you developed such a driver you would proabably have to get it
certified by Austel before distributing it (subject to it being
"equipment") (This is a really interesting question).  You would
probably also breach any waranties that came with the modem (subject to
the Trade Practices Act).

I doubt that a computer is equipment under the Act (but that's a matter
of interpretation really).

David et al:

&gt; I'm sure it's not illegal to write a driver for a win modem, but
having done
&gt; so the modem would lose it's Austel licence, and so use on an
Australian
&gt; public telephone network would be illegal.  (BTW setting the time to
answer
&gt; to one ring is also illegal.)

Does this mean that any open-source, non-manufacturer driver module
could potentially invalidate your WinModem's Austel licence? In which
case, if Austel suddenly disliked you they could charge you a hefty
fine
or at least slap you on the wrist...
