Regarding linux specific hardware.

&gt; hat 6, for simple print jobs. I think it is time for companies to build
&gt; devices for linux. I was told once that it would cost too much money to do
&gt; this. But I find this hard to believe.

Consumers are obsessively price sensitive.  If company X makes a
printer for Linux and it turns out to be 10% more expensive than the
printer that company Y made for Windows, and then a driver is released
for company Y's printer ---- well few people will make the choice to
reward the support of company X.

For example, there _are_ unix specific personal printers.  I own a
Lexmark E12.  It is a 10 page per minute, _postscript_, laser printer,
that cost me about $460.  This is about as close as you can get to a
Linux printer (given the state of the printing subsysytem ;-).

Actually, it is a very good printer, but hey I don't see much good
happening to Lexmark for all their trouble.  Specifically they seem to
be laying people off and losing money.

Will Matrox's helpful efforts wrt the XFree86 4.0 DRI mean that Linux
users will buy their product over the cheaper, faster Nvidia products?
I doubt so, even though Nvidia have been shown to be rather
duplicitious wrt their support for DRI.


Cheers,


Andrew
