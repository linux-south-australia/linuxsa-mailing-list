Hi, I have an epson stylus colour 440 printer which is a windoze printer and
also could not get any drivers for linux for it. but it works ok under red
hat 6, for simple print jobs. I think it is time for companies to build
devices for linux. I was told once that it would cost too much money to do
this. But I find this hard to believe.

Regards Anthony Daniell.

Subject: Canon BJC-5000 - my experience from the top!


&gt; Hello, Penguinites.
&gt;
&gt; Just a quick rundown of my recent "dialogue" with Canon, with regards to
&gt; Linux drivers for my BJC-5000.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, it wasn't until AFTER I became a Linux newbie less than a year
&gt; ago that I realised that this printer falls into the category of a
&gt; WinPrinter.  &lt;spit&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I commenced the long search on-line for any piece of code that would
&gt; breathe life into my printer under RH 6.2 - even Turoprint couldn't get it
&gt; running:  www.turboprint.de
&gt;
&gt; It finally dawned on me with some posts on this list some months back that
&gt; these "GDI" printers basically didn't have much of a chance of budging
&gt; under Linux.  (Though I managed to get the light to flicker once!)
&gt; &lt;applause_optional&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "Why don't I ask the nice people at Canon for a driver?", I thought.
&gt;
&gt; My polite letter to Canon Australia in Sydney led to a stony silence for a
&gt; number of months.
&gt;
&gt; When I followed it up by phone, the response was equally unproductive:
&gt; "..we don't support Linux, check on-line as someone might have written a
&gt; driver for it under Linux..."
&gt;
&gt; OK, maybe Canon HQ may be interested to hear of my plight, after all any
&gt; decent company would at least provide some sort of response to a letter
&gt; from a concerned user of their product(s).
&gt;
&gt; Here's a step-by-step rundown of what I put into my letter:
&gt;
&gt; - Bought BJC-5000, which worked well under WinDoze
&gt; - Discovered Linux, but unable to find drivers for Linux on-line
&gt; - Informed them that Linux is expanding in user uptake
&gt; - Mentioned a possible niche for Canon to be seen to support Linux
&gt; - Suggested that products could be bundled with Linux drivers and badged
as
&gt; "Linux Friendly" (the marketing!)
&gt;
&gt; It would be foolish for me to have expected to have a CD with the right
&gt; Linux drivers in the mail the following week, though, I was interested to
&gt; read what the view was from the top.
&gt;
&gt; Naturally, I had addressed my letter "Attention" to the President & CEO
&gt; (which I found out via Canon's web-site was a Mr. Fujio Mitarai).
&gt;
&gt; And so, yesterday arrived a letter from Canon Inc. - with Mr Mitarai
&gt; (surprise, surprise!) passing the letter on to one of his other managers.
&gt;
&gt; In the three paragraph letter from Hideli Tomita (Manager, BJ Products)
was
&gt; the follwing reply:
&gt;
&gt; - my letter was acknowledged and there was regret for my "...unpleasant
&gt; experience..."
&gt; - my region is handled by Canon Australia, who will get in touch with me
&gt; - thanking me for bringing it to their attention
&gt;
&gt; Needless to say, I won't be holding my breath for any useful reply from
&gt; Canon Australia - which I'm guessing will be along the lines:  "...the
&gt; printer was developed by Canon HQ, maybe you should ask them for a
driver."
&gt;
&gt; In the meantime, I'll be considering my next printer purchase much more
&gt; carefully.
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Peter
