&gt; Is there a reason that there doesn't seem to be an open source virus
&gt; scanner? There seems to be an open source project for everything else :)

The main issue seems to be ongoing resources for maintaining
the virus database.  As far as the Open Source model goes,
you could view this as a service.

What is missing at the moment is a documented virus database
format.  This would allow an open sourced virus scanner to be
written and for competition in the provision of the virus
pattern database.

Obviously, this isn't in the interest of the existing vendors.
And unfortunately, not all the vendor's virus databases could
withstand the scrutiny that open source would bring.

Finally, sendmail now has hooks that could be used for a virus
scanner.  So it's now reasonable to start writing a high quality
e-mail scanner (eg: with ZIP in a library rather than as a
seperate executable).
