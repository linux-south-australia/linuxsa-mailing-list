Ok, so I take ages to answer questions. It's a free service, right? :-)

Someone asked me at the installfest why they couldn't use the USB port for
networking. They had two computers with perfectly good USB ports, so why
not plug them together?

A very good question. Parallel port networking has been around for years
(in Linux its called PLIP, ParaLlel IP), as has serial port networking
(you use a null modem cable between two computers and run PPP, the same
Point to Point Protocol that you use for dialing up your ISP) and even
TCP/IP over the SCSI protocol. But I'd never stopped to think about
networking over USB, even though it is a very obvious thing to do. So I
started looking. Here's what I found.

1. TurboLinux have funded a driver for a device which does USB &lt;-&gt;
Ethernet, see <A HREF="http://www.scyld.com/pub/usb/ethernet.html.">http://www.scyld.com/pub/usb/ethernet.html.</A> This isn't
exactly solving the problem because you have to buy some hardware. But it
shows someone thinks about this sort of thing (why you wouldn't just buy a
$10 ethernet card I don't know :-)

2. Windows does it, see <A HREF="http://www.pccablesdirect.com/ezlink.htm">http://www.pccablesdirect.com/ezlink.htm</A>

Incidentally, a list of reasons why the RT Linux project chose Firewire
over USB is given at
<A HREF="http://www.rtlinux.org/rtlinux.new/mailing_list/rtl.w5archive/9911/msg00382.html">http://www.rtlinux.org/rtlinux.new/mailing_list/rtl.w5archive/9911/msg00382.html</A>
I know that this isn't relevant to a home network where you just want some
simple networking for free, but some of the information about limitiations
of USB is interesting background.

In short the answer appears to be "no, you can't do it under Linux
yet". Surprising but true.
