&gt;&gt; I do.  I've felt, for a long time, that there was a compact between the
&gt;&gt; utilities and the people to beautify our environment by undergrounding
&gt;&gt; these services.  Installing new services above ground puts the lie to
&gt;&gt; that idea.  The argument that there are already overhead cables so a few
&gt;&gt; more won't make any difference does not hold water.  It's just a thinly
&gt;&gt; veiled way of saying that there is no intention -- ever -- of getting
&gt;&gt; rid of those cables; and bad luck to the people.  Cables are not pretty.
&gt;&gt; Quite the opposite.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; I'm sure that David might have forgotten to mention this point...
&gt;
&gt; Every cable you put up overhead is another company you have to negotiate
&gt; with to have it moved. 

Well, not in this case.

&gt; Currently you have in South Australia you have ETSA, Telstra and
&gt; optus(I belive).. Optus may not be using their cable but it was
&gt; installed... Do you really want a few more there. You also have
&gt; problems with trees and people growing vines up stobie poles.

We were talking about ETSA putting cables on their own masts.
