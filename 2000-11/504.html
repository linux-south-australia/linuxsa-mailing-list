Hi...

&gt; Does anyone know how to set print quota on a linux server?

Assuming Linux is the print server:
This is (unfortunately) not trivial.  There are two print servers
(that I know of) that will do page accounting: CUPS and LPRng.

CUPS is relatively easy to install & configure, but its page
accounting is very average.  On PostScript printers (I'm not sure what
happens with other printers) it uses the %%Pages: line in the
PostScript for the page count.  Sometimes Windows misreports this
count as 1, and smart users can modify this line so that they only get
charged for 1 page when printing their 70 page document.

LPRng is harder to install & configure, but its page accounting is
very good.  It uses the printer's hardware page counter to figure out
how many pages were actually printed for each job.  However, this only
works for certain printers, and then only if you're using a
bidirectional interface (Ethernet or serial -- bidirectional parallel
is not supported).  We're using a HP LaserJet 4MV PS connected over
Ethernet, and the page accounting works very nicely.  LPRng also
displays the user name and job name on the printer's display, which I
think is pretty cool.  ;-)

So, once you've got page accounting you need to somehow restrict
access to the printer when there is no quota left.  For LPRng I've
done this by writing an accounting filter.  The filter gets called
once the job has been spooled.  It checks if the appropriate user has
credit and either allows the job to continue or removes it from the
spool.  I don't think it's this easy with CUPS.  I've also got a
program that parses the printer accounting file and updates the
database when users print pages.  You'll probably need to build
something similar - I don't think there's a standard solution out
there.

You can find CUPS at <A HREF="http://www.cups.org">http://www.cups.org</A> and LPRng at

HTH.
