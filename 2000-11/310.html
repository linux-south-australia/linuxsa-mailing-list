&gt; Cool, looks like we have two volunteers signing up for the dia development
&gt; effort. Sign up and fix them bugs :-)  [1]

Wow, look at that, the helix update I did yesterday fixed my problem. Oh
well, looks like I'll have to find something else to do.... ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; [  Just to remind the list that if you find software that's cool, but doesn't
&gt; quite work properly, why not join that particular effort to either a) find the
&gt; problems, or b) fix the problems, or c) document the product.  Most open source
&gt; projects would love any of you from linuxsa to join and help out.  ]

Very good point. This exact topic was discussed on a number of Samba
mailing lists a couple of weeks ago. As far as I know, there were about
a dozen people who put up there hands. A lot of people believe that it's
only programmers that can help, but have any of you tried reading the
Samba documentation? Not completely up to date, so you have to rely on
books and stuff (not that there's anything wrong with buying Richard's
books ;-)).

&gt; [1] And no, I'm not pointing the finger at David/Matthew - they are probably
&gt; major contributors already :-)

Errr. Ummmm. Yes, that's right..... ;-)

&gt; Just suggesting that there might be people out
&gt; there with spare time on their hands who might like to help a project.  Go on,
&gt; you know you can help!

Even if it's just sending bug reports in the recommended format (see the
team responsible for the particular project - they are always happy to
let people know how they like their bug reports).

Perhaps this requires a LinuxSA
software-project-joining-and-generally-helping-fest, or similar :-P
