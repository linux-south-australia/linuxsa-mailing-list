&gt;&gt; &gt;Does anyone know when/if Telstra is going to/expected to interconnect
their
&gt;&gt; &gt;backbone into the Southern Cross Cable???
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Considering that it's owned by 3 of their competitors
(Optus/Cable+Wireless,
&gt;&gt; NZ Telecom, Worldcom), don't hold your breath waiting.
&gt;
&gt;Glen shakes his head at uncalled-for slur.  In fact Telecom NZ
&gt;would be thrilled if Telstra bought out their SCCN share.  And
&gt;C&W's corporate strategy is to be a bandwidth supplier, a carrier's
&gt;carrier if you like, so they would be thrilled to make a big
&gt;bandwidth sale to a major national carrier.

What makes you think they're in a hurry to use it?

They're just about to lose a lot of international ISP traffic and who knows
what else to wholesalers using Southern Cross, so they should have capacity
to spare for at least a short time. If there was a real need for Telstra to
use SC, why wouldn't they have invested in it themselves instead of focusing
on bandwidth into Asia?
Given that focus, would it not be in the interest of shareholders to
maintain that interest and not spend money with infrastructure owned by
their competition? At least nationally, Telstra havn't had much practice at
sharing bandwidth owned by others.

Just for trivia; weren't some of the older Aus&lt;-&gt;USA links owned by British
Telecomm?
