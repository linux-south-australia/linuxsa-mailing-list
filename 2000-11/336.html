&gt; Getting something via FTP involves a single fetch from the remote server.
&gt; HTTP nowadays involves fetching multiple objects, first the HTML page, then
&gt; dozens of images that a web designer somewhere added to give (or so they
&gt; thought) the information more appeal. Modern browsers take advantage of this
&gt; by attempting to load multiple images simultaneously .. something which is
&gt; nearly pointless on a modem link, but fair enough on a high-speed link where
&gt; there are different sorts of bottlenecks.
&gt; 
&gt; Each Image in a web page will also require a seperate connection to the
&gt; proxy server (in theory http/1.1 and persistant connections should negate
&gt; this..). Perhaps your proxy is doing an authentication routine, ident check,
&gt; or reverse lookup on every connection, that gives the page the appearance of
&gt; loading slowly?

I'd had thoughts along the same lines, but what is causing the wait ?
The system is running ident, does anyone know if the RPM version has ident
enabled in its compile ? I remember a web server running very slowly
because ident was firewalled off.

&gt; 
&gt; You could always try speed testing web pages from the web server running on
&gt; the same system as the proxy, via the proxy. At least then you might be able
&gt; to eliminate the network interface from the problem.

I'll try that.

&gt; 
&gt; How fast are your downloads through this proxy at the moment anyway? Even
&gt; with a pretty powerful (but busy)array of squid boxes, I see downloads go
&gt; down to 110KB/s when they would go over 200KB/s otherwise, but I'm also not
&gt; on the same subnet as those servers.

Well I'm pulling from mirror.aarnet for my tests, and the link into the
Uni is fairly fast, so I'm getting about 250KBs average.
