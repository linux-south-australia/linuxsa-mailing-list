&gt; OK, I agree, advertising on this list is not appropriate, and we know
&gt; that you work for that ISP.  Nevertheless, I think that this
&gt; information is interesting enough that we don't need to think of it as
&gt; advertising.  What do other people think?  Should we let Leigh speak?

I think that if something is an unsolicited Advertisement, it should have
something like [ADVERTISEMENT] in the subject line. However, if something is
more along the lines of information relevant to a topic of conversation, like
this has been, then it should be OK. I think that as long as it doesn't go over
the top, and remains relevant to a real thread, people should be allowed to plug
the linux-related products and services that they provide, particularly if they
have supported LinuxSA in some way in the past or present (as Internode, Agile,
NetCraft and Tellurian have -- among many others too numerous to mention).
Certainly in this case, many people are interested to hear about Adelaide ADSL
support for Linux, and while the Internode guys do plug internode, they have
also mentioned their competitors... :)
