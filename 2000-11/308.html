&gt; &gt; I'm not sure whether this is a linux problem or not. Nonetheless, I've
&gt; &gt; been saving DIA diagrams as EPS format. I then get the GIMP to translate
&gt; &gt; them (it takes a hideously long time to do so) but the output is just
&gt; &gt; plain awful; the text, for one looks as though it's been written with a
&gt; &gt; black marker that's running out of ink.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And it's extraordinarily large...anyone know what the cause of this
&gt; &gt; might be?
&gt; 
&gt; The default line widths in dia are a little excessive. Try reducing them
&gt; to a very small size. I'm having a problem printing from dia. The
&gt; diagram comes out fine, it just has a severe lack of text :-(.

Cool, looks like we have two volunteers signing up for the dia development
effort. Sign up and fix them bugs :-)  [1]

[  Just to remind the list that if you find software that's cool, but doesn't
quite work properly, why not join that particular effort to either a) find the
problems, or b) fix the problems, or c) document the product.  Most open source
projects would love any of you from linuxsa to join and help out.  ]


[1] And no, I'm not pointing the finger at David/Matthew - they are probably
major contributors already :-)  Just suggesting that there might be people out
there with spare time on their hands who might like to help a project.  Go on,
you know you can help!
