Recently I had a drive failure and now I'm a bit worried about what's left
of the machine...

The story: the box originally had 1 drive, a 1 gig WD with a windows
install. I added an 8 gig to the machine later on and installed
linux. Essentially the original 1 gig was barely used and was really only
there to run the boot manager at startup...

Anyway, the 1 gig eventually died suddenly and totally. That was no
problem as there was nothing important on it - but when it went the linux
session locked up hard and the master drive was making horrible noises,
etc. Had to switch off. At switch on, I had a drive controller failure...

No problem. I figured the 8gig drive was fine and had some backups
anyway. I replaced the 1 gig master with a 8 gig from another machine (I
bought a 13 gig, but had bios probs with my old P120, so I put the 13gig
in the other machine). I then rebooted linux with lilo - then the worries
started...

fsck gave up on the reboot and I had to run it manually. Had quite a bit
of 'damage', but mostly just lost log files and stuff - nothing critical.
Eventually cleaned up the / partition.  /home was on another partition and
it checked fine. The fat partitions seemed okay (I keep photos and data
there to share on the network and dual boot).

I then fixed everything up, lilo, the bootup, etc. And I installed a spare
linux install on the other drive. 

All seemed well until I next decided to then backup to CDROM. It was then
I started to notice unreadable files in /home. Just a few and nothing
critical, but they were on the home partition.

badblocks showed 16 blocks on the /home partition, so I went through both
drives and badblocked and fsck'ed again. Ended up with 16 on /home and
then 24 bad blocks on /   This time lost a few other files. Nothing that
affected the normal running of the box, but several docs and various files
in the kernal source, and an X server I wasn't using. 

So now I'm worried about this drive. Everything is now backup up in a
major way, as you'd expect. I have the other linux install as well...

The question is, would the drive have been damaged when the othe drive
went bad - they shared IDE0? Would the damage be physical or just the
filesystem? I suppose I need to wipe the part and run a r/w badblocks and
redo the fs as a test.

At the moment I'm still using the drive and it seems fine now, but I
wonder how long it will last. It's still fairly young, but that doesn't
mean much. I'm thinking it's going to vanish any minute :-)

thanks

tim
