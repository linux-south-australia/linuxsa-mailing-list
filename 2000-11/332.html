Hi all,
            after installing Red Hat 7 on my machine and changing some
config files, I discovered that my system was not booting properly.
After some searching I found that my lilo.conf was at fault. I had added
the line label="RedHat Linux 7" and on non floppy boots my PC was saying
INIT: Entering runlevel 7, and would then stop
    Further investigation of this uncovered that if I had a label of any
length ending in a number with one space preceding it, INIT would enter
that runlevel rather than the one specified in inittab. In addition to
this, the majority of other system services were started without
consent, e.g., HTTP, Telnet, NFS, etc. If the system services were
viewed by typing setup almost all of them had been selected. On
correcting the entry in lilo.conf and rebooting I found that these
services were no longer selected. Weird huh?

This looks like a bug to me, can anyone else shed light on it?
Although I have been using Linux for over 2 years I still consider
myself a newbie and thought I'd better ask the local crew before posting
to Red Hat or something. (Which I will do if no one else can tell me
anything about this)

:-P

Thanks,  Nathan.
