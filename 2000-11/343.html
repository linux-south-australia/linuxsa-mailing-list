tafe.sa.edu.au is called "barnnie" and is the main gate for ALL of TAFE SA.  It
is not unusual for activities being carried out particularly on evenings.  It
was recently upgraded due to extreme overload, but from what I hear the upgrade
did little to improve things.  I use the educational side of things every day
and to be honest if they were a private ISP they would be out of business by now
(EDS control all the servers for TAFE SA) I believe there is not a great deal we
can do about it because we no longer control what happens with the equipment we
use.
If you think Regency is bad go to Port Adelaide and see what its really like.

Also we use  WebCT online training programs  and its a big drain on resources.
So if you are unlucky to use the connection during a heavy WebCT night its just
you luck :-)

&gt; If I pull files from AARNET through Regency TAFE's stupid Novell
&gt; Bordermanager, when the stupid thing works I usually get betweeen 100 -
&gt; 300Kb/s Regency's connection goes to DETE in the city then to Internode.
&gt;
&gt; Their stupid proxy server here at Regency is always coming up with stupid
&gt; error messages. Tonight for 4-5 hours it said "Access Forbidden" no reason
&gt; it just does sometimes. (maybe they were doing something, but I don't think
&gt; so.) Other times for about 5 minutes it decides to say "Lost connection to
&gt; neighbour proxy server" This one is really annoying coz it happens whenever
&gt; it feels like it. Its not like an automated routine or something it just
&gt; happens at unpredictable times. The neighbour proxy is
&gt; adl0076.tafe.sa.edu.au this I think is running something different. Possibly
&gt; Squid, I think this is a Unix system because it is runnign Sendmail 8.8.6
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could always try speed testing web pages from the web server running
&gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same system as the proxy, via the proxy. At least then you might be
&gt; &gt;able
&gt; &gt; &gt; to eliminate the network interface from the problem.
&gt; &gt;Well I'm pulling from mirror.aarnet for my tests, and the link into the
&gt; &gt;Uni is fairly fast, so I'm getting about 250KBs average.
