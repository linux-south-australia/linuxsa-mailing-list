&gt; Ahhhhhhh, noooooo...
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen sooo many fireballs die it's scary. I had one in a brand new
&gt; machine approx 3 yr ago. I went to run it up for the company that I was
&gt; working for (preinstalled Win95 just had to load on Office) and the
&gt; partition table died. Not happy. All of the fireballs in that batch of
&gt; machines have since been replaced with Seagates which just keep going and
&gt; going and going.
&gt; 
&gt; My Bigfoot 6.4 Gb died on me approx 3 months out of warranty. Again not
&gt; happy.
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say I am a bit dark on Quantum HDs as I have had nothing but
&gt; probs with them. My experience has been Seagate or Fujitsu are the way to go

I think it's the luck of the draw with drives. I've had various brands
die, but they've all been old. I panicked after getting the Bigfoot 2.1
gig as everyone said they were bad, but it's still kicking. I just lost an
old 1 gig WD, but it was getting old and sad - and I think a fan failure
in the power supply helped to cook it and finish it off. It was always a
noisy little drive tho...

The 8.4 gig fugitsu is also acting a bit sad, but it too may have been
cooked. I have a dead Maxtor somewhere, but it has to be out of the dark
ages :-) And I had a 20 meg seagate die once :-) 

Actually I've been lucky with drives, even with boxes that are on 24/7...
