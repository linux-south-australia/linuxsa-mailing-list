    Adam&gt; anyone have any idea what it would take to get telstra to
    Adam&gt; support linux?  surely there must be some way we could make
    Adam&gt; them "see the light" so to speak

Below is a message I received from someone at Telstra a couple of months
ago.  It appears that they are looking into it.

Their current concerns seem to be the impact on their help desks, and
the number and type of distributions and the variances between them that
they would need to support.

My suggestion was that this support could be provided through user
groups.

Regards,
Martin

Dear Martin,
I work for Telstra in the Technology Solutions department and am researching
the use of Linux in our broadband products. 
I am especially investigating the increase in demand and popularity for
Linux(including the number of users currently in Australia and how this
figure has appreciated) and was hoping you could help me out with some
statistics. It would be greatly appreciated.

Thanking you,

Arife Halil
