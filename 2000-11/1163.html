&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup - You just need to fool Telstra into thinking you're making voice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; calls so they won't extort $1/hour out of you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather ironic, as they're both 64K point to point connections (plus,
&gt;&gt;&gt; with a data call, you're not using codecs at the far end to attach
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the PSTN network - you'd think it'd be cheaper. :-).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Exactly what I've been saying for years.
&gt;
&gt; I was talking to a Telstra employee the other day, and he was
&gt; telling me that in Europe, ISDN has become standard and PSTN and
&gt; they have phased out PSTN to such an extent that PSTN is more
&gt; expensive than ISDN is from Telstra!

Europe is a lot of countries, and that doesn't apply to them all.

In Germany, they have effectively phased out analogue phones, and it's
true that ISDN is cheaper than analogue.  But when I was living there
(up to about 3½ years ago), telephones were *very* expensive.  In
addition, every European country I know about meters local voice
calls.  The ISDN calls were metered at the same rate as the analogue
calls, and the only difference was the line rental (maybe $3 a month
cheaper).

When I returned from Germany, I was able to get a continuous Internet
connection, which I couldn't have afforded in Germany.  Despite this,
my Internet costs (data + phone) dropped by 95%.
