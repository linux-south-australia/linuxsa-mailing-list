Hmmmm....

You changed the subject and submitted your e-mail in HTML. Black text on
a white background looks really pretty in my grey background Netscape
Messenger mail reader. I mean it does...

I make the following observations:

* anyone who can point their browser at the appropriate URL can find out
whether they are ADSL enabled
* anyone who can talk to a sales person can probably get a salesperson
from Optus or Senet or wherever to tell them about ADSL
* advertisements that are covert - reference the John Laws case in
Sydney - can be construed as misleading, false and in the right
circumstances illegal [1]

This thread started because someone printed out what should have been,
and is, public knowledge. I've been to Telstra's home page and typed my
telephone prefix in and discovered that I'm not yet ADSL enabled. I
would point out that Telstra and any other service provider do make a
profit out of this, and they make it easy for you to help them make a
profit.

Now, a few more observations:

* as the thread continued some people discussed the merits of ADSL and
Linux
* others started to notice that someone was actually referencing a
particular ISP
* that person who started this thread has publicly apologised to those
he (I think) may have offended

We can divide this into two separate issues:

The "Advertising Issue"
-----------------------
Personally I think this was a rather inept way of supporting one of our
supporters regardless of whether the person is, was or has been employed
by that supporter. Let me state it bluntly, and more concisely -
Internode have supported LinuxSA in the past, they do by what I have
heard provide excellent service and I am prepared to stand by these
comments [2]. The point is, though, that the way this thread originally
turned up looked suspiciously like an advertisement rather than a piece
of information.

I reference my original observations. The information is there if we
want it - why proactively tell us without no apparent reason? Why make
allusions to an "unnamed" entity when you are obviously coming from an
e-mail address closely associated with said entity? It is true that some
people will want to be informed and that is a very valid reason.

But please, tell us who the good service providers are in the clear,
rather than making vague allusions. Making vague allusions to anything
can get you into a flame war - trust me, I know that is a fact :-)

The "ADSL/Linux" Issue
----------------------
Nothing wrong with that issue at all. My only, personal gripe is that
the subject didn't change...

The Suggestion [3]
------------------
I would like to make a suggestion to the group. Sometime, early next
year, can someone do a talk, presentation or whatever on ADSL, what it
means to us and how we might connect to it? We could invite various
providers' representatives along to be fair to everyone and make a good,
informative discussion that would benefit us all...

DL

[1]
Generally, if you are a public personality or broadcaster and you
support a product and get paid for it - but don't say so - you may have
breached the guidelines/law

[2]
No, I'm not advertising. I am simply stating a fact.

[3]
Yes, I will do it if someone pays me to shift to an ADSL related area,
and my connection, and my ongoing costs for the duration between now and
the presentation :-P

Don't you find it rather touching to behold
The OS that came in from the cold
Seen for what it is: religion, plus finesse
Countries, creeds, mean nothing - only Linux...
