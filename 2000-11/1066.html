&gt; All those people who say that whenever a security

&gt; all your systems will have a bit of work to do this week.

&gt; 
&gt; Alright, now be truthful, how many of you are going to install new
&gt; versions of all this stuff this week?

well, not all of it is actually installed on my system, and (this goes
for all of us) there is no value updating what is not installed. But to
answer your question, I am using MandrakeUpdate to upgrage the ones that
I do have installed. I did a chunk on the weekend, and would have
finished it except that my connection mysteriously dropped out somewhere
like a half hour into a download.

I do this updating regularly, and so should you. I do it immediately if
I judge it's a security risk on my system. And it is very very easy,
too. There are lots of fora where you can get security info news to help
you know when to update, like Linux Weekly News. (www.lwn.net from
memory)
