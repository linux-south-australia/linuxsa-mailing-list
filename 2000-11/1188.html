&gt; &gt; XF86 used to have an inbuilt font server, but one bad thing about this
&gt; &gt; was speed. To display a font it hadn;t displayed before, the X server
&gt; &gt; had to find information for it (searching a list of directories) then
&gt; &gt; render it. This all took time, and it was time that the used was shaking
&gt; &gt; the mouse saying "whats wrong? why has my X session frozen".
&gt;
&gt; I must admit I still prefer the built in X server as I find most the fonts
&gt; I use are loaded when X starts anyway. X 4 also provides a much nicer
&gt; built in font render which doesn't hang X whilst it's rendering the font.
&gt; (Although the user is still left thinking why didn't that font change till
&gt; it's rendered). However, with modern machines it's pretty quick anyway.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Funky things that you can do is add TrueType (windows) fonts, which I
&gt; &gt; have been trying to get going but have had little luck - but that's
&gt; &gt; another thread.
&gt;
&gt; Thread change :)
&gt;
&gt; The builtin render also supports truetype fonts natively A simple
&gt;
&gt;         Load  "freetype"
&gt;
&gt; in the Modules section of XF86Config then something like
&gt;
&gt;      FontPath    "/mnt/dos/windows/fonts"
&gt;
&gt; In the Files section of XF86Config then running:
&gt;
&gt; ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale
&gt; mkfontdir
&gt;
&gt; in the directory with true type fonts and bingo, you have ttf support. Of
&gt; course you'll need to restart X or run something like xset +fp path;xset
&gt; fp rehash if you don't feel like restarting.
&gt;
&gt; Now If only I could get netscape not to core dump when viewing various web
&gt; pages...but that's another thread :)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

I can't get my True Type Fonts working under X, it appears that if one of
your TT fonts is slightly funny it won't load any of them... XfsTT appears to
work but then when you select some of the fonts it crashes X....
Anyone know of a program to make sure that these TT fonts are valid and
working? A more useful error message from X would be helpful aswel...
