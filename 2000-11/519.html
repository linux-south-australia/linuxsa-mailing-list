&gt; AmaViS' web site seems to think that it takes a lot of resources. When I
&gt; first installed it at a place I work it crashed our mail server (which

&gt; for Linux Daemon (resident process) simply didn't work. It wouldn't
&gt; detect the EICAR.COM test virus whereas the AVP for Linux non-daemon
&gt; which loads the databases pe use would.

It seems to run fine on a P166MMX with sendmail. The daemon version
requires some subtle tricks to get it to work. The order of the paramters
is very particular. The manual is a complete bum-steer. I have tested it
on eicar.com, eicar.zip and eicar.zip.zip and several other viruses and it
works well. It did miss one virus that Vet picked up, but I think that
may be a database issue (out of date), but we do automate the database
update to occur nightly.

One debugging note, is that the resident version remembers parameters.
So you have to define all defaults on the call to it, or have only one
type of process (eg: just mail) use it (where general command line
scanning uses the non-resident version). This breaks the purpose of
'defaults'.

I think that the later version of AVP may address some of this.
