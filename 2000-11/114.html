&gt;Many modems have quite slow CPUs.  Using your host CPU may actually
&gt;outperform these dedicated devices.  I'm minded of the time when MS-DOS
disk
&gt;compression hit the market.  At that time 486 CPUs where the norm, and hard
&gt;disk controllers were quite slow.  Many systems (reportedly) ran faster
&gt;using CPU compression because of lower volume of data transfered.

Anyone who's run a large bank of modems for dialup knows that serial port
processng alone takes up a lot of resources for such a small amount of data,
that's why so-called "intelligent I/O" multiport boards are so popular. The
same goes for winmodems, anything you can do to use the CPU less on the host
computer makes it better to use.

Some might remember that the early winmodems (originally HFC?) would only
operate on pentium machines. Why? Because the sorts of calculations needed
to make a modem signal are much better done with analogue methods, or a DSP.
To do the same sort of thing with your normal CPU uses a lot of floating
point power, which is why a 486 or derivitive could not use them.

Some people might argue that a real modem costs $50 more than the winmodem
and achieves the same effect. Does it? It's quite possible that a winmodem
uses enough CPU power to make your computer perform like one 50Mhz slower..
which would have cost you perhaps $100 less .. making the winmodem a false
economy. For the dealers, of course, it is much easier to sell you a 700Mhz
system than a 650Mhz one that will run faster for you.

The other odd thing with earlier winmodems was that they had problems
talking to each other, they always liked to have a real modem on the other
end of the connection .. I suspect the digital-&gt;analogue conversion involved
some sort of tradeoff when being generated by a PC rather than a little box
with real capacitors inside it, that probably add analogue filtering effects
for noisy lines that take 100's of CPU cycles to duplicate.. how can you
allow for odd line impedance or any number of anomalies in a 45v (?) phone
system using a printed circuit board in a PCI slot?

Also, it's probably fair to mention that there are 2 types of Winmodems,
host-based CPU dependent models (really cheap and nasty) along with ones
that actually do have a DSP on them. The latter are trying to do the right
thing, but they have the ugly label of a winmodem on them, without the full
benefit of a real modem, so it's unlikely you'll find them for sale when
there are cheaper variants. As long as the winmodem software remains
closed-source, it's also unlikely that we'll see much improvement in them.
Modems have become very unfashionable with the advent of DSL, and it looks
like that's where R&D money is headed. A year ago, competition was hot for
ISP dialup access equipment, new features were being added all the time ..
now it's like none of the vendors even care.. (Cisco 5400 being the only new
product I've noticed this year, and it's only tangible improvement is in
voice software. The Max3000 hardly counts as new..).

Last, but not least, it's important for everyone to remember that all
phone-line modems are a hack for a medium that was never designed for them,
and that it's really quite ridiculous (or fascinating, depending on your
PoV) that the future is currently being shaped by their use.
