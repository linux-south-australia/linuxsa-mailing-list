No, not true. 

The reason graphics cards use dedicated CPUs isn't exclusively about the
grunt of the main processor (although that's a factor).  Graphics boards 
have their own CPUs because the processing power needs to be close to the
memory in order for the CPU to manipulate items stored there.

Consider what happens when a main processor accesses video memory:  In
order to manipulate a word in video RAM, the CPU needs to negotiate with
the PCI bus controller to access the bus, then it needs to fetch the 
word over the bus (which is probably running at a lowly 33 or 66 MHz), 
then it needs to perform its operation, then it needs to write the word
back, which involves an additional transaction with the PCI bus controller,
and an additional traversal of the low-speed PCI bus.

If DMA is being used to access the word the story is potentially worse
for small transactions:  The CPU says to the video card (via the PCI bus
controller and the bus), "Please transfer the word at address X into main
system RAM at address Y."  The video card would then do all the bits which
I've described in the previous paragraph to get the word into RAM.  The CPU
would then need to fetch the word from RAM to work on it, then arrange 
another DMA transfer to send it back.

Contrast that to the approach which includes a CPU on the graphics board.
The main system CPU would upload programs implementing graphics primitives
to memory used by the graphics board's CPU, then it can send the graphics
board CPU messages (across the PCI bus) like, "Apply a texture to the sphere
I'll get you to draw in a few microseconds...".  The pixel-bashing required
to draw a texture on a sphere potentially represents millions of pixel
manipulations -- But when the CPU which is carrying out those manipulations
is connected to graphics memory by, say, a 1 GHz bus (for example) instead of
a 33 MHz PCI bus, those manipulations can be carried out much, much faster,
because the data is being made to the processor with so much less delay --
and the main CPU can be put to better tasks (like, say, decoding MP3s :-)
while the graphics card is working on the textures.

The other win it gives is the ability to improve the performance of the
device at a later date by altering the firmware loaded on the card.  Found
a more efficient way to draw textures?  Fine - Implement the firmware, 
upload it to the card, and the main CPU doesn't need to do anything
differently to make texturing faster for /all/ applications which use the
device.

The same goes for mass storage controllers, network cards, sound cards,
modems, and almost anything else you can plug in to your computer:  Most
cards have some kind of dedicated on-board processing power, and the CPU
communicates with them in a way which is very similar to RPC.  Much more
efficient.
