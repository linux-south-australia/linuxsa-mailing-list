&gt; What have I done ???

asked a question that traditionally causes flame wars :)

Somehow, we have managed to keep this one almost entirely in jest, as you will see by the fact that no-one answered seriously... :)

If this looks like a flame war -- don't worry, it'n not... wait unti lDavid Lloyd says something really controversial, and then someone who doesn't get him responds, and then watch your incoming link get flooded with mail... :)

PS: and now for a serious answer re the original question...

for a Linux starter, RedHat or Mandrake seem to be the way to go. They are easy to use and install, and are quite good. Debian is a great distro, but is not for the faint-hearted -- it holds your hand less, but is generally accepted as being superior technically (if a little behind at times). Others to look into are SuSE (popular in Europe -- I think it has the best international language support), TurboLinux, and whatever else...

Just browse the web, read a reveiw or two, and then install one and see. Change to another if you don't like it..
