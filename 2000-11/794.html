YES !

I'm on the Ultra 300 satellite plan and it works perfect. As per usual, iHug
will give no support or assistance for a computer linux. When I had it
installed it took at least 2 days for them to figure out how to enable my
account and get my password working. I did find them to be the most
unhelpful people over the telephone. But ... $60 per month, unlimited
downloads really suits me quite nice.

The PCI card they gave me is made by a company called telemann satellite
solutions (www.telemann.com). The model of the card is SM200d. They have two
versions of software for linux available on their website, one for X and a
text version. On the website they slightly hinted that the X version
wouldn't work with the Ihug satellite, but I only downloaded the text
version. They give the full source code for the software and drivers. I did
have problems compiling on newer kernels, so I just did a vanilla install of
RH 6.1 with a 2.2.12 kernel and works perfect. As I use a different
operating system other than linux on my desktop, i'm runing ip masquerading
on my linux box and it's working very nicely.

I don't tend to get downloads much faster than about 22k per second, but i
can download about 2 - 3 files at once all at that speed :-)

Cheers

Jeremy

Hi,

I am looking at getting iHUG Ultra (Satellite) installed at my home.

The rates seem quite reasonable, but I wonder about linux compatibility.

Is anyone currently using the service?

I would like to know how you have gone running the PCI Card under linux,
and also what your download speeds have been like.

Thanks in advance

Regards

Andrew Reid
