&gt; Better by far to allow ISPs to attend and give out their
&gt; marketing materials and spruik for custom one-on-one after
&gt; the talk.

true -- perhaps they can have the choice of 1-2mins or some brochures (or both)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; mention VDSL etc (the xDSL family).
&gt;
&gt; VDSL can't run over Cat 3.  At 60Mbps its reach is about 500m
&gt; over Cat 5.
&gt;
&gt; So ADSL and VDSL topologies are completely different.  ADSL
&gt; runs over existing copper to an exchange.  VDSL runs over new
&gt; copper to gear on a pole.  That gear is then optically networked.
&gt;
&gt; So discussion of VDSL really belongs under "optical networks",
&gt; as one of a range of "last yard" technologies.

oh... Well anyway, it wouldn't hurt for whoever is talking about this stuff to
cover all the technologies briefly, with attention to two things in particular:
Linux compatibility and Australian/Adelaide availability.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps a slide or two on history would be good.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, I don't understand this.  If you mean the history of DSL
&gt; technolgies then I think we could have the entire crowd snoring
&gt; after the first sentence.  The difference between the ADSL standards
&gt; is also real MEGO ["my eyes glaze over"] material.

I suppose I mean just a few sentences on where we've come from, where we're
going, and where DSL fits in. ie: touch on modems, ISDN, xDSL, GPRS?, etc...
just timelines, bandwidth and characteristics... Not technical details, just an
overview...

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I know that this gets controversial, but it certainly would be
&gt; interesting to
&gt; &gt; hear a little about what some of the Telcos, ISPs and whatever else
&gt; are planning
&gt; &gt; in Adelaide and SA...
&gt;
&gt; We could give each of the broadband providers five minutes to outline
&gt; their rollout plans.  The danger here is that you might get four
&gt; 5-minute
&gt; content-free market spiels.  Although that alone would say something
&gt; about the suppliers cluefulness :-)

I seriously think we give them 2 mins each, and time them strictly... one bell
at 1:45, off the stage at 2:00
