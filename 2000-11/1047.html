Such software does not conform to the Open Source Definition. The OSD is
not a legally watertight definition (at least, it wasn't designed to be
and the authors therefore refuse to say that it is.) Open Source is not a
trademark in any country that I know of. Nevertheless most people find it
helpful if Open Source is used reasonably consistently.

There is a reasonable amount of software like this. There is also Ross
William's model from here in Adelaide, www.freeworldlicense.org, which
says "use it for whatever you like, but it is GPL on free platforms and
commercial on non-free platforms." This doesn't meet the OSD either.

&gt; &gt; Software theft hurts you and me both.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed.

Certainly. It may well not hurt Microsoft, but it certainly hurts free
software companies. A company running all its systems on pirated Microsoft
software isn't going to be purchasing free software services. Its IT costs
are also going to be artificially low, again reducing the incentive to
change to something better.

("So why therefore is Linux so popular in China where piracy is rampant?"
is not a counterargument to this, according to free software people who
have been to China. Apparently many Chinese do view piracy as theft, but
when the option is to steal something essential to business life _or_ pay
the equivalent of a year's salary for the same item, people feel they have
no choice. Given a free alternative they leap onto that
instead. &lt;shrug&gt;. I don't know China at all so I can't comment.)
