&gt; Its a lot more expensive(comparatively liek $0 to $70+ - a a$70 modme is

&gt; modem.

Only if you look at it that way. I have an old PC and don't have the CPU
power to play with. It's 'cheaper' for me to let the modem do as much as
it can rather than my overworked CPU... On the other hand many PC's are
waaaaay overpowered and the CPU is sitting there doing nothing, so why not
use the CPU...
 
But hey, surely the mfr should write the driver if they want you to use
their modem and they want to make a cheap modem. They want to keep it
proprietry, then fine - but write the damn driver.

&gt; Don't all modems used on a PC of some sort require the OS to operate them
&gt; at some level?

Hmm, well, with an external modem all the PC has to do is basic serial
handshaking and sending a few control commands - which are clearly defined
and written in a book, generally.

&gt; Aren't all modem proprietary to some level?
&gt; Where are all the open source modems?

Internally, I'm sure, but they tend to use a 'standard' command set -
which is why you can just stick a serial modem on pretty much ANY type of
PC and it will work. That PC does not have to be intel, windows, linux
etc. I can stick it on my old CPM machine if I want to.

&gt; There is nothing stopping some interested party in writing the
&gt; appropriate software for win modems to run under other OS's, if they so
&gt; desire and can be bothered.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact I think someone has been bothered so my statements are not even
&gt; academic.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact i think I heard about it here on this very list.

It's a nice effort, and I think lucent are being helpful. I still would
prefer the hardware to do the work. In any case, a crappy modem simply
will not work where I live, even say a acer external. They are crappy and
my phone is crappy so I need a good modem. So for me the whole thing is a
bit meaningless. 

The main thing to remember is that if the mfr doesn't write the driver to
support its crappy modem, then it's up to someone else to do it in their
spare time. But who wants to write the driver for a crappy modem. 

If I had a crappy modem like that, I could either a) spend a few weeks
trying to figure it out, convince them to give me specs, illegally reverse
engineer it, etc, or b) I could go buy a real modem...

I'd go for b)
