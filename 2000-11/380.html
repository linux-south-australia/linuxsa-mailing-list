David, I'm shocked.

&gt; I don't see how.  I suppose they are all v.90, which is current
&gt; state of the art.  Best of all, when "they" work out how to squeeze
&gt; 56k both ways, and assuming that the data pump is up to the task, a
&gt; new driver will be sufficient to upgrade the modem.  Sure modern
&gt; "hardware" modems have flash upgradeable firmware, but they don't
&gt; have the luxury of effectively limitless ROM, so all bets are off
&gt; that the new firmware will fit in the old hardware.  I'd say it
&gt; sounds like WinModems are superior to other state of the ard
&gt; hardware.

You can't talk of superiority or inferiority (both comparatives) until
you define your basis for comparison.  All modems we're looking at
handle modern protocols, so you'll have to find some other basis If
you're looking for something with the lowest component count, you
might find that the "win"modems are superior.  If you're looking for
something which runs without CPU support, they're clearly inferior.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Inferior to one of those x2 modems that are NOT v.90 compatible,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and which are not upgradeable?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do they still exist?
&gt;
&gt; Spoken like one who never bought one! :-)

You still overrun :-)  The paragraph below was reformatted.

&gt;&gt; some people can't or don't want to use their CPU for something a
&gt;&gt; dedicated modem chipset can do. I certainly don't, but I like to
&gt;&gt; optimise my system for speed.
&gt;
&gt; Many modems have quite slow CPUs.  Using your host CPU may actually
&gt; outperform these dedicated devices.

I would assume that all modems have CPUs adequate for the task.  What
you're really saying here, I think, is that the CPU load needed
wouldn't make a big dent in a 500 MHz Pentium.  I agree.

&gt; I'm minded of the time when MS-DOS disk compression hit the market.
&gt; At that time 486 CPUs where the norm, and hard disk controllers were
&gt; quite slow.  Many systems (reportedly) ran faster using CPU
&gt; compression because of lower volume of data transfered.

My experiences with software RAID-5 on 486s show that the allegedly
high CPU load is not even measurable on that category of processor.
