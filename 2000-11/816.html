&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I just ordered Redhat 7 respin edition to upgrade from 6.2 then after I
&gt; noticed on some lists on the web that there seems to be some deep
&gt; concerns about this upgrade. One comment even went as far as to say that
&gt; there were 2,500 bugs in it, reportedly based on information sourced
&gt; from the Redhat bug notification site.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been unable to find any reviews on this upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know of any reviews or have you had any experience or comments on
&gt; the upgrade.?

I've heard a few people say it was 'very bad'. Not for critical use, pain
in the bum to compile stuff, etc.

Probably wouldn't worry me as a system to play with, but doubt I'd use it
for the main box - I like to wait for .2 releases :-)

BTW I install RH6.2 on a box for another person the other day and I must
say I do think Mandrake has a nicer final product for the new
user. Desktops set up better, etc. I used RH as it was a 5x86 chip on a
486 MB, and it works lovely, but it's just not as good for the linux
unaware... Or at least it would take a lot more setting up to get 'right'. 

So I'm getting MAndrake 7.2 next... They are all good and have their good
points, and I started on Slack, but I just want something quick and easy
for the main working machine...
