Quoting David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@rebel.net.au">lloy0076@rebel.net.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; 
&gt; Ok, what steps does atp (the debian package manager) take to ensure that
&gt; its upgrades:
&gt; 
&gt; a) don't break your system for innocent purposes (eg it doesn't upgrade
&gt; Bind 4 to Bind 8 behind your back as a really silly example)
The debian development process takes care of this -- they are very strict, and 
have policies that meant that this is very unlikely to happen. It is actually 
possible to upgrade an insanely old version of Debian to a recent one with a 
single command. I forget what version it was now, but it was of the order of 
five years old (I beleive it had kernel 1.x). They are very careful not to 
write over old config files -- in fact, they check to see if you have changed 
the originals first... if they are changed, they aren't overwritten, and if 
they aren't changed, they are... clever, hey?

&gt; b) doesn't install Trojan horses

Debian are strict about who they let update the archive. There will be no 
trojans there becaues every developer is personally known by another developer 
and so on (BTW: try checking all the source of every package you install for 
trojans... in fact, think about the old c compiler trojan that doesn't actually 
appear in the source...)
