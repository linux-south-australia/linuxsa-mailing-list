The education department provide a copy of NT server to each school. For the
"admin" server, being for teachers / clerical staff only, yes that is very
true, they HAVE to have NT server ... which many schools have nothing but
problems with.

I have been setting up Linux servers as the student / intranet / proxy
servers for a few public schools now. The staff are more than happy with it,
but I'm not sure how that fits in with education department policty ...

Matthew!

&gt; Worse. They have been targetting schools also. There are schools
&gt; offering MCP. Microsoft had a propaganda-fest a while ago, where
&gt; Microsoft spoke to the Catholic Schools about the whole thing. They'd
&gt; like MCP done by yr10 and the possibility of MCSE by the end of yr12.
&gt; It's a problem. Schools should remain product independent.

I'm almost certain a teacher friend of mine was saying that it's
Education Dept. policy to have a Windows NT Server (whether it's useful
to the school or not)...

Don't you find it rather touching to behold
The OS that came in from the cold
Seen for what it is: religion, plus finesse
Countries, creeds, mean nothing - only Linux...
