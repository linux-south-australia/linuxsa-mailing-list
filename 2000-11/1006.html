&gt;Hi guys
&gt;
&gt;I removed the Samba rpm that came with RH7 and compiled Samba 2.0.7, I am 
&gt;trying
&gt;to do more compiling that just use the rpm. Now smbd and nmbd aren't in the 
&gt;list
&gt;of daemons (I think that's the right word) in Linuxconf to be enabled at
boot.

There are a number of problems with this (compiling your own stuff). Two
with Samba are:

  - The RPM actually puts things (smbd, nmbd, etc) in different places
    than the Samba compile and install process does.

    This is partially what you are experiencing. That and the fact that
    you do not have an smb script in /etc/rc.d/init.d. There is a sample
    script in the source.

  - The configure.in and thus configure script supplied with the source
    does not compile in PAM, because there are too many Linux distros that 
    either do not have PAM, or have the PAM libraries but do not use PAM.

    I am trying to get a better test into configure.in, but in the meantime
    you probably will need to rebuild Samba to include PAM. Do this by
    reruning configure:

    ./configure --with-pam

    You might want to delete config.cache first.


&gt;The other problem is that I don't have a inetd only a xinetd on the same
list 
&gt;as
&gt;above and I'm trying to set up Swat and I don't know where to put it so that 
&gt;it
&gt;starts up properly.

Well, you will need an entry for SWAT. You could copy and modify the Telnet
entry, for example ...

&gt;The hard drive thrashing problem is still there but it's not as bad.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this makes sense
&gt;
