&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, I can't find a copy of the original letter,
&gt;&gt; but one of the things [Bill] mentions is that "piracy deprives

&gt; Which is an entirely reasonable point of view.

Which I don't have a problem with, and don't believe I stated
otherwise.

&gt; The Stallman's and 2600's of the world would hold that it's
&gt; harmless to give away software that you bought, but they are
&gt; wrong.

I agree.

When you use software (whether bought or obtained "for free") you
abide by its licence.  If you can't, then don't use the software.
Simple choice to make, yet some people seem to have trouble doing
so.  There are some Open Source products that I can't (and therefore
don't) use because the licence forbids its use in a commercial
environment - I don't have a problem with not using it in those
roles.

I don't have an issue with purchasing software - I've stated on
this list before that I would dearly love to purchase a decent
web browser for my Unix platforms of choice.  I certainly don't
feel overcome by a need to then give that software to everyone
in my immediate vicinity (which, on the Internet, is everyone).

&gt; Software theft hurts you and me both.

Agreed.
