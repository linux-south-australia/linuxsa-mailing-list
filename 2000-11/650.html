You have asked a perfectly sensible question, because there is a such a
range of options. However Mark Newton gave a good reply when he said "no",
meaning he can't tell you which one is best. It depends on so many
factors. 

To give some examples: TurboLinux Chinese isn't best for me because I
don't do most of my work in Chinese. But it certainly is the best for a
very large number of other people. PocketLinux isn't best for me because I
use full-size computers to run Linux, not handhelds.

Eventually you pare the list down to distributions which set out to do
much the same job as far as you are concerned. Let me make up some
criteria that might apply to you: in English, on your sort of hardware,
costing either nothing or much the same, up-to-date, plenty of support in
LinuxSA and other places. The list might perhaps look like this: Debian,
TurboLinux, Red Hat, Mandrake, SuSE, Caldera.

Which is best out of these? I still can't tell you. But if you start to
define more what you are trying to do then you'll start to find out, and
other people will help you to decide. There is a set of factors that I
present to large companies when they are resolving this question, and it
is completely different to the things that you will need to be
considering.

If you are an IT student rather than just someone trying to run a word
processor then I strongly advise you to run at least three or four
distributions, prefererably simultaneously. It will help you understand
how operating systems are put together.

If you just want to do some basic user tasks be aware that Linux and BSD
have a higher initial learning curve. In contrast to certain other systems
you are expected to have a brain, but then you are allowed to use it.

The best answser I know of to the question "But why are there so many
Linux distributions?" is "Because there can be".
