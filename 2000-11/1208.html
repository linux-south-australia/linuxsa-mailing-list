&gt;Hi!
&gt;
&gt;I've finally managed to reactivate my second computer which is a:
&gt;
&gt;* 450MHZ k6-III [1]
&gt;* 64 Mb RAM
&gt;* relatively slow hard drive
&gt;
&gt;As in relatively slow, it's the current bottleneck on the computer. I
&gt;use Coax which is, I think, only 10mb/s so the network isn't
                                  ^^^^^^

That should be 10Mb/s, unless your setup is such that you actually get 10
milli-bits per second.

&gt;extraordinarily fast [2]. Now, if I've got it correct given that I'm the
&gt;only one using this machine on the network (there are only two machines
&gt;on the network) and it isn't a file server [3], the speed of my coax and
&gt;the hard drive won't particularly matter.

10Mb/s is ~ 1MB/s, which is not slow, especially compared to your ISP
access rate.

However, if you are concerned, a pair of 10/100 cards (RTL8139-based) and a
cross-over cable is cheap enough ... Ought be less than $100, and possibly
closer to $50.

&gt;Especially since I use a very inexpensive, but slow ISP [4].
&gt;
&gt;Now, I also intend to use:
&gt;
&gt;* a full blown name server (BIND 8.2.latest-stable)
&gt;* SendMail
&gt;* DHCP
&gt;* SSHD
&gt;
&gt;The SendMail will act as a relay for my main machine which will still
&gt;deal with all of my e-mail.
&gt;
&gt;From my understanding, none of these utilities/programs or such are
&gt;terribly disk intensive so my slow hard drive wouldn't kill them.
&gt;Furthermore, my slow Coax network wouldn't essentially be a bottle neck
&gt;either, or would it....
&gt;
&gt;What's peoples' opinion on this?
&gt;
&gt;DL
&gt;
&gt;[1]
&gt;I think a 500MHZ K6-II would have been faster :-(
&gt;
&gt;[2]
&gt;Yes, I know. Coax...irck...but it's what I've got and I don't have a
&gt;twisted pair cable and unless there's a reason I'm not wasting $25 to
&gt;get one
&gt;
&gt;[3]
&gt;The hard drive is only about 1 Gig or something
&gt;
&gt;[4]
&gt;Don't get me wrong - for ~30-35 AUD I get about 360 hours per month with
&gt;unlimited downloads and I've downloaded heaps in terms of mail, ftp and
&gt;http
&gt;
&gt;PS:
&gt;Interestingly, I have managed to make StarOffice 5.2 by Sun (not an
&gt;OpenOffice version) go fast! How? Stack 383MB of memory into an Athlon
&gt;650MHZ with a reasonably fast hard drive...rebuild the kernel using
&gt;Athlon GCC (based on pgcc) [i] and in fact it loads in, like, 2 seconds
&gt;and I now think my latest bottleneck is the hard drive system...sigh...I
&gt;want to eventually implement a RAID2 (or is it 1...where you basically
&gt;write/read alternatively to two drives, striping I think is the
&gt;technical term) with two 7200RPM drives....
&gt;
&gt;[i]
&gt;Not for the faint hearted. I feel over the "-O3 and above have serious
&gt;bug" problem...and I would get things like "Register EAX....cannot
&gt;derefence NULL pointer errors" at start up and other odd times...and it
&gt;nearly crashed my damn file system - lucky I realised what was happening
&gt;and powered down before it did whatever it was doing too badly [ii].
&gt;
&gt;[ii]
&gt;The advantages of having multiple, smaller partitions as opposed to one
&gt;huge partition, is that file system crashes will hopefully choose to
&gt;trash something like /usr or /usr/local or /tmp or /etc or /home rather
&gt;than /boot or / :-)
