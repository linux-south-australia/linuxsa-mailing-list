&gt; ...the dangers of naked PCs:

&gt; 
&gt; The propaganda war is heating up, looks like.

Maybe not, I've got my ACT PC User Group meeting notes
from the late 1980s with Bill ranting about piracy.
[Bill personally, he did his own ranting then]

So maybe it's just a continuation of a well-worn
theme.

This isn't to say that Miscrosoft don't have an
anti-Linux strategy.  I've seen aspects of it at
work in the univerisity sector, as recently as
this week.  I'd expect to see a strong push for
MSCE to become part of the tertiary computing
curriculum, perhaps under the guise of "real world
relevance" (a hook, line and sinker phrase for this
government).  And they're offering cash for unis
to use MS development software (although the offer
isn't put as bluntly as that).
