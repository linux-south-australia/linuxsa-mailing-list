Ryan:

&gt; *scratches head*

Head scratching is a worthy excercise@

&gt; The subject line in this thread isn't all that relevant now is it &lt;grin&gt;

Yes, and no. PERL is smart and it can cause your computer to
redial...think laterally.

&gt; I would say, perl is both, neither, and either, depending on one's
&gt; interpretation and personal definition of a "scripting language" and
&gt; "programming language".

Well, a scripting language is something that can call other tools
elegantly and is most easily used this way; a programming language is
one in which - given enough effort - you don't need any other tools
(such as sed, awk, cd, ls, wc etc) to get done what you want to be done
[1].

&gt; For interest's sake, what are your personal definitions of these?  I'd bet
&gt; my two dollars they all differentiate *slightly*.

I claim your bet. You can pay me, plus 10% GST, next meeting :-P

&gt; Or.. maybe we're looking at this question from the wrong angle... it could
&gt; be a ham sandwich in disguise?

I like ham. Ham is flavoursome. Ham is nice :-)))

Did I forget to prepend an "I Believe" for those who can't cope with
people who are confident to back their opinions as fact?
