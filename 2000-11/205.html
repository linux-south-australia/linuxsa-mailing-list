&gt; Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; We've got a small number of machines here connected to the internet via a
&gt; linux box which is acting as a router.  Recently the Traffic Reports we've
&gt; been getting from our ISP have shown abnormally high usage levels on the
&gt; link.  What I'd really like to see is some form of graphing which can show
&gt; me total ISDN link usage, and a breakdown for each of the IP's in our
&gt; subnet.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of something which would do this for me?  Does MRTG work
&gt; with Linux routers?

MRTG works with most things. If you find that there isn't an MRTG module
for what you want to do, or you can't use SNMP for some reason, try
writing your own. Most things you need will be in files in /proc and
perl is great for doing this stuff. If you don't want to write your own,
or want help, I have a very crude piece of code I wrote to show Network
load, CPU load, disk I/O and RAM/SAWP usage. It's not fantastic, but can
demonstrate how it works....

Hope it helps,
Matt
