This just arrived and low and behold Adobe is not supporting FrameMaker
at this time

Oh well I guess we could look at it a number of ways, there was no
market or expected market for it, or if my memory serves me correctly
one of their major shareholders M$ had something to do with it.  I
believe that Microsoft cash injection was used to keep the company from
hardship earlier this year or late last, can't remember when. No doubt
we will here more as the story progresses.

Subject: FrameMaker 5.5.6 beta on Linux
Date: Mon, 27 Nov 2000 20:46:24 -0800
From: FM Linux Admin &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fmlinux@Adobe.COM">fmlinux@Adobe.COM</A>&gt;
To: "FM.Linux.Users":;

Thank you for participating in the FrameMaker 5.5.6 on Linux beta 
program. The beta program has now completed, and the beta software is 
no longer available for download. The beta licenses will expire on 31 
December 2000, and you will be unable to use the product after that 
date.

The FrameMaker product team appreciates your feedback and 
participation in Adobe's investigations into the Linux market for 
FrameMaker. From this study, Adobe has determined that it will not, 
at this time, release a commercial version of FrameMaker or 
FrameMaker+SGML on the Linux platform. Of course FrameMaker 6.0 and 
FrameMaker+SGML 6.0 software continues to be available for the 
Windows, Mac and UNIX platforms.

If you have documents created with the FrameMaker 5.5.6 beta on Linux 
which you wish to continue to use, you have two choices. Documents 
created with the FrameMaker 5.5.6 Beta on Linux software may be 
opened with FrameMaker 5.5.6 or 6.0, or FrameMaker+SGML 5.5.6 or 6.0, 
on a Windows, Mac or UNIX platform. Alternatively you should save any 
documents created with the software to text before 31 December 2000, 
for that content to be accessible to other applications after 31 
December 2000.

Comments on the FrameMaker 5.5.6 on Linux beta program can be sent to:

Thank you again for participation in this program.

Best Regards,
The FrameMaker Product Team
Adobe Systems Incorporated
