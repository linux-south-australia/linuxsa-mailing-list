Talking about XFree86 4.0, what's the deal with Mandrake 7.2. I've just
installed it, and I'll put all that in another post, and it's working fine
on this box. Few little teething troubles, but not too much trouble with
X. This box uses a SIS 6326 card, or something like that, and it's
lovely. It even fixed the cursor problem I had with X 3.3.6 (with that
version I had a glitch on the cursor, but if I use the sw_cursor option it
would crash X randomly)

Anyway, works fine with this mandrake hybrid version of 4.01, whatever it
is. But I had no luck installing on the other box with the TNT2m64. IT
worked fine (normal non-3d use) on 3.3.6 with mandrake 7.0. With mandrake
7.2 and 4.01 it locks the screen and I can't seem to get out of it. The
box is still running and I can telnet in okay, but shutting X down doesn't
help and I can't seem to get any responce. In the end I just shutdown -r
now...

There doesn't seem to be any option in the install to use 3.3.6, but the
rpms seem to be included. I'm going to try and manually install 3.3.6,
except the base package seems to be 4.01 (or some home made mandrake
thing). Bit confusing for a dummy like me...

I don't normally dabble in the cutting edge like this on my production pc,
but I didn't really think mandrake 7.2 was a cutting edge release like it
seems to be. But I did want to have an easy way to look at KDE2 and
upgrade to some more recent gnome/gtk libs and stuff. I can't d/l that
much stuff..

Anyway, more on the ups and downs of the install later... :-)
