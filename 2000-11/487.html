Welcome back!

Interesting point.  SCO appeared to stop "innovating"[1] (matching feature
for feature) when they bought out Novell's Unixware, their only serious
competitor.  Paradoxically, they didn't do this with GNU/Linux or *BSD,
although they did choose to acknowledge and denigrate it (does anyone
remember the famous "letter" that SCO sent out?).  Perhaps they though
that Linux wouldn't be taken seriously because you couldn't "buy" the
product.  Rather ironic that their Unix section has been bought out by
a Linux crowd.

Postgres has always been an interesting little number, even since the
Stonebraker days.  I'm sure that MySQL may have helped push bug fixes,
though.  Nothing like a little healthy competition.
