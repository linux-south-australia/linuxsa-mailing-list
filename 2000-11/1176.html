Hi Tim,

Make sure you don't have any GL files from Mesa in the path, if you do find some
rename them so that they wont be used.

I don't know why but the files from Nvidia only work on a compiled kernel not
the installation one.

There is a good faq at Nvidia also.

You need to download 2 files from nvidia and install them.

Next you need to configure 'X'. Do you have 'Xconfigurator'? If not then edit
the attached file to suit your settings.

&gt; Talking about XFree86 4.0, what's the deal with Mandrake 7.2. I've just
&gt; installed it, and I'll put all that in another post, and it's working fine
&gt; on this box. Few little teething troubles, but not too much trouble with
&gt; X. This box uses a SIS 6326 card, or something like that, and it's
&gt; lovely. It even fixed the cursor problem I had with X 3.3.6 (with that
&gt; version I had a glitch on the cursor, but if I use the sw_cursor option it
&gt; would crash X randomly)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, works fine with this mandrake hybrid version of 4.01, whatever it
&gt; is. But I had no luck installing on the other box with the TNT2m64. IT
&gt; worked fine (normal non-3d use) on 3.3.6 with mandrake 7.0. With mandrake
&gt; 7.2 and 4.01 it locks the screen and I can't seem to get out of it. The
&gt; box is still running and I can telnet in okay, but shutting X down doesn't
&gt; help and I can't seem to get any responce. In the end I just shutdown -r
&gt; now...
&gt; 
&gt; There doesn't seem to be any option in the install to use 3.3.6, but the
&gt; rpms seem to be included. I'm going to try and manually install 3.3.6,
&gt; except the base package seems to be 4.01 (or some home made mandrake
&gt; thing). Bit confusing for a dummy like me...
&gt; 
&gt; I don't normally dabble in the cutting edge like this on my production pc,
&gt; but I didn't really think mandrake 7.2 was a cutting edge release like it
&gt; seems to be. But I did want to have an easy way to look at KDE2 and
&gt; upgrade to some more recent gnome/gtk libs and stuff. I can't d/l that
&gt; much stuff..
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, more on the ups and downs of the install later... :-)
