&gt; &gt; The reason being that a lot of the satellite data stuff is insecure. If
&gt; &gt; you had access to source code you could use the dish/receiver in a kind

&gt; &gt; packets using their IP, and get the data back anyway!
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to imply that one could back-hack their program and do all
&gt; sorts of evil things...I guess what I'm saying is that simply because
&gt; the code is not available doesn't mean people won't be able to find
&gt; bugs, cause bugs or exploit something...

When they introduced this, you needed a 1.8m solid dish, and a $8000
decoder, which pretty much kept it out of the hands of anyone with
enough spare time to abuse it. Bugs aren't the concern, using satellite
is like being on one huge ethernet segment, with a driver that only lets
you receive traffic for your allocated IP, and rejecting everyone else's
traffic. It is insecure by design.

It's also the reason why multicast news services and other broadcasts
haven't made much impact on the market, it's too difficult (read: not
cost effective) to secure them to make a product that can't be ripped
off. It may even be why Foxtel are still so keen on getting back the old
Galaxy boxes, since the hardware to decode the signal was part of a
contract before, but now that they're appearing at Garage sales anyone
can get hold of one.. and then it becomes a trusted-client issue,
dependent on the security in a cheap smart card.

Then you get the DeCSS-style million dollar question, is it illegal to
decode broadcast radio signals without paying for it?
