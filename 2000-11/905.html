&gt; 
&gt; Considering that it's owned by 3 of their competitors (Optus/Cable+Wireless,
&gt; NZ Telecom, Worldcom), don't hold your breath waiting.

Glen shakes his head at uncalled-for slur.  In fact Telecom NZ
would be thrilled if Telstra bought out their SCCN share.  And
C&W's corporate strategy is to be a bandwidth supplier, a carrier's
carrier if you like, so they would be thrilled to make a big
bandwidth sale to a major national carrier.

Iti is known that SCCN have sold bandwidth to Telstra.  But it's unclear
what part of Telstra (eg: possibly not Telstra Internet) nor
if it were bought simply to do connectivity testing for Telstra's
SCCN backhaul product.

Telstra also has a corporate strategy for offshore bandwidth.  They
are investing in a cable lay to Japan.  Once there they will purchase
Japan-US and Japan-Europe bandwidth at competitive prices.  It is
unclear to what extent Telstra Internet is bound by this strategy
after recent happenings.
