Hi Karl,

I wish people (not you specifically) would search the archives
before asking the same questions over and over - it gets quite
old to see the very same answers come back, this time admitedly
from someone else to last time (Hi Newt!).

Good advice, but then consult a lawyer anyway.

&gt; You might be able to use the new wireless LAN modules available,
&gt; though I don't think it is feasible to make your own.

Technically, yes, legally, no.

&gt; What about optical?

Likewise: technically yes, legally no.

Now, to quote chapter and verse, THIS is the law:

And THESE are the exemptions under the law:

So unless are covered by one of these exemptions, you cannot, 
for example:

* supply anyone with access to the Internet over a privately owned
  line link, regardless of who owns each end of the link, unless it
  is covered by a nominated carrier declaration, or indeed if the
  private owner of the link is a carrier (see above); or

* link two seperate houses together for any use whatsoever, Internet
  access or not (see Section 42 3(c)(i) above).

to name but two cases in point.

This is *SERIOUS* stuff, folks, it is law for a very good reason.

Telecommunications, while it may be fun at home, can affect life
or death situations (and does so on a daily basis).

I'm not trying to be overly dramatic here, nor am I providing anyone
with legal advice, I'm trying to educate people as to where they can
seek advice and/or information about the telecommunications legislation
that governs this field.

In conclusion, if you want to run your own private line link,
regardless of whether or not it is fibre, radio, laser, infra-
red on steroids, your own copper in the ground or overhead, or
anything that is covered by the legislation, SEEK LEGAL ADVICE
BEFORE YOU DO IT (not after).

&lt;/phew&gt;

Cheers
