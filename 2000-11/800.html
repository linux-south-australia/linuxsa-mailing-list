Me too :-(

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because the majority of Australians voted Prime Minister Howard in

&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that at the last federal election the
&gt; coalition actually lost the 2 party preferred vote, ie more pople put
&gt; the ALP as their first major party than the LP or NP. But the coalition
&gt; won more marginal seats, so we had a situation much like the US
&gt; presidential elections at the moment (although much fairer, since
&gt; electorates are more fine grained and preferential voting was used
&gt; here). So (assuming my memory is correct) the majority of Australians
&gt; did *not* vote Prime Minister Howard in. A majority of people in a
&gt; majority of electorates did, however. :)

That's not my recollection, but I don't have any facts to back me up either. 
From my memory I believe the coalition took about 52% for the last election, but
around 54% when they last _lost_ the election.   Feel free to correct me with
facts.

I reckon we'd have better government if we automatically tossed out a government
every 2 elections (sort of extending the American toss-out-the-president idea)
so the opposition can correct the complete stuff-ups of the previous government,
whatever their persuasion :-)

Leaving this really OT thread,
