&gt; For reasons of principle I would prefer not to go via Telstra.

See Leigh's posting about Agile's availability.  Greviously, the
list is missing Semaphore :-)  But it's rather well thought out,
so your odds are good.

Optus are also available, but they're less forthcoming than Agile
about exchanges that they have a presence in and I'd have to kill
you after I told you the exchanges that they operate out of.
Basically CBD &lt;bang!&gt; at present.

At the current state of play, unless you live in the CBD, you
won't have much choice.  This should improve, but slowly as
Adelaide isn't the first priority for the national telcos and
wannabes.  This is actually a strategic error as TransACT,
Amcom and similar companies are so good that the national
telcos may find themselves with just the east coast as their
market.

Cheers,
Glen

Declarations of interest:
 - I like Agile, as I know a lot of the people there.
 - I'm developing a service with XYZed (the Optus ADSL co)
   to terminate some of their ADSL connections on AARNet
   routers, providing a really neat way for unis to VPN
   into small CBD branch offices.
 - Telstra Internet was AARNet, about 5 years ago.
 - I've advised Amcon about their long-haul technology.
 - I'm buying fiber from TransACT.
In short, I'm totally and hopelessly compromised as an
unbiased source.  But I like to believe that my biases
are technically based :-)
