&gt; Dear all, I thought this might amuse you.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to find this report some years ago after talking to someone on
&gt; early the Alpha design team but couldn't. By chance I came across a
&gt; reference to it and guess what, it has re-appeared...
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.research.compaq.com/wrl/techreports/abstracts/TN-13.html">http://www.research.compaq.com/wrl/techreports/abstracts/TN-13.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; In case you are wondering what the hell this is all about, the report
&gt; concludes the effectiveness of the Dill and Kosher pickle in this
&gt; research. One particular pickle was well known to the Alpha design team
&gt; which had a brand name of Vlassic. Keeping the report in mind, when using
&gt; this brand as per the report, it became known as the Electro-Vlassic
&gt; demonstration.
&gt; 
&gt; Electro-Vlassic was a demo that the early Alpha chip design team liked to
&gt; do. The chip designers [you can safely assume that they were a weird group
&gt; to say the least] liked to attach probes to either end of one of these
&gt; pickles, and then plug the other end of the wire into the electrical
&gt; outlet [110VAC type that is]. By turning out the lights (in their
&gt; conference room) it could seen that the pickle glows as the report
&gt; verifies. Apparently it also started to smell VERY BAD after a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of you will have heard this before, so I hope I remembered it
&gt; correctly. I'm not 100% sure of my spelling of the pickle's name but it's
&gt; close to the mark.
&gt; 
&gt; You will notice that Electro-Vlassic can be abbreviated to EV.
&gt; Now you know what the EV in Alpha EV4,EV5,EV6 etc. really stands for - no
&gt; joke this is the real meaning!
&gt; 
&gt; BTW the corporate line is that EV "probably" stands for EVAX or Extended
&gt; VAX. It does not. The real origin was not considered commercially
&gt; acceptable (at least not back in the late 80's) but by the time it was
&gt; sussed out, the chip was already somewhere between EV3 and EV4, the
&gt; precedent had been set.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards - Richard
