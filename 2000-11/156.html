Er, no.  A "constant carrier" is always being generated (and scrambled,
for reasons I can't clearly remember, but basically to maintain a "mean"
signal on the line).  The CPU will be being using constantly to generate
that signal, so when you think the modem is "idle" (by not sending any
data), it still is being used.  I would think that the CPU load it would
be consuming would be fairly constant regardless of traffic being sent.

&gt; Perhaps, but that's true of all cheap modems, isn't it?  I mean, you don't
&gt; seriously expect us to believe that moving the CPU from the modem enclosure
&gt; to the mother board makes a difference, do you?

But this is very much like the old argument between UARTs and bit-banging
the serial data.  People used to say "oh, it doesn't matter, the CPU's
not doing anything", _until_ OSes started shifting to multitasking, and
then people had serious problems meeting the realtime constraints of
making sure that data got clocked out with minimal jitter ("you can't
toggle that bit now - some other process is currently executing" - by
the time you've context-switched a process because you have to toggle
a bit precisely, you've lost valuable microseconds).  How do you
guarantee responsiveness to phase shifting analogue signals when the
CPU load goes up? (this is a rhetorical question).
