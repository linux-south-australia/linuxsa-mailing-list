Michael,

I use several scripts here which send email.  The script below should speak
for itself...

#!/bin/sh                                                               
(                                                                       
 echo "To: Someone &lt;<A HREF="mailto:someone@somewhere.org">someone@somewhere.org</A>&gt;"
 echo "From: Jim OHalloran &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jim@kendle.com.au">jim@kendle.com.au</A>&gt;"
 echo "Subject: Scripted Email"
 echo
 echo "If you get this message, your cron job is working!"
 echo ""
 echo "  Jim."
) 2&gt;&1 | /usr/lib/sendmail -t                                           
exit 0                                                                  

The date command can return the current system date in various formats ("man
date" for more details).  Something like...

echo "The url is xyz.com/stats/`date +%Y%m%d`.htm"

In the above script should do what you're after.

Jim.

PS: If someone could tell me why messages created by the above script and
delivered into POP mail boxes managed by QPopper cause problems (invalid
from field apparently), I'd be really happy!

Subject: A few questions (auto mail script + SSH related)


Howdy all,

I have a few questions if someone could please answer them for me?

1. How do I (or could someone) create a simple mail script that is run by 
CRON that sends mail to a fixed address saying a few things and giving a url

with the date in it. I want it so that it can send mail to someone saying 
that this weeks stats are now available at xyz.com/stats/20001101.htm I want

it to be able to take the date from the machine and make the link that date,

ie YYYYMMDD.htm


2. I have managed to get SSH server installed onto my machine running RH6.2 
I installed it from the RPMS. now I have no idea how to actually get it to 
replace TELNET or get the private/public key things working, could someone 
please explain this to me or give me a url which explains it, I searched the

net but cannot find anything. Unfortunately I missed the SSH talk by 
Geoffrey.

3. When/IF I manage to get SSH running on my linux box is it possible for it

to answer on port 80 along with http or can't they both run on the same port

at the same time??? what about a virtual host???

Thats all (for now!!!!)

Thanks in advance to anyone who can give me a hand with this.


Regards,

Michael Kratz
