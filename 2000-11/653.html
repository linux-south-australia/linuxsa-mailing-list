&gt; If you are an IT student rather than just someone trying to run a word

&gt; distributions, prefererably simultaneously. It will help you understand
&gt; how operating systems are put together.

To a certain extent. The differences between different distributions are
far less than the differences between different operating systems.
Running many distributions is good for people who will work mostly with
Linux boxes in a number of different roles (web server, workstation,
firewall, etc), but to learn more about operating systems, play with as
many as you can. This is where FreeBSD and OpenBSD are great fun. They
are readily available and they are different.

As well as running many different operating systems, running them on the
same machine (multiboot) is great, because you can see how well they
play with others (in the case of SCO and NT/2000, not very well). And
running multiple operating systems on multiple machines over a network
is great to find out how well they play on a network.

Push them too hard and find out where they fall.

&gt; If you just want to do some basic user tasks be aware that Linux and BSD
&gt; have a higher initial learning curve. In contrast to certain other systems
&gt; you are expected to have a brain, but then you are allowed to use it.

Yes. Although, I am in the process of testing this on friends and
relatives who are not 'computer people'. They can get the job done, but
that's as far as it goes. For example, my uncle is a Uni student (not IT
degree) and he managed to install Mandrake 7.1 (I helped with the
partitioning) and started using it straight away. Coupled with Word
Perfect Office 2000, he will be able to move away from Windows very
easily.

&gt; The best answser I know of to the question "But why are there so many
&gt; Linux distributions?" is "Because there can be".
