&gt; Intel are spending more money than you can poke a stick at trying to find

&gt; anything you can do to use the host CPU makes that CPU a little less idle.

&gt; A Pentium machine is no longer a "normal" CPU.  It's obsolete and woefully
&gt; underpowered.  We are not talking about your vintage 486.

A pentium 120 is normal for my house. Not everyone needs much more :-)

&gt; But don't forget that when the modem isn't processing data, which is 99.999%
&gt; of the time, I get to use that extra 50Mhz for important tasks, like
&gt; displaying a coolscreen saver.
&gt; .... 
&gt; Perhaps, but that's true of all cheap modems, isn't it?  I mean, you don't
&gt; seriously expect us to believe that moving the CPU from the modem enclosure
&gt; to the mother board makes a difference, do you?

Perhaps modern PC's have too many 'cpus'. Surely the main CPU could be
doing a lot more of the work instead of haveing other chips to take the
work away and make it sit there idle all day... Like sticking fancy chips
on video cards and all the rest...

Serial transfer can be done by the CPU toggling a single data line and
running that through a chip to change the voltages... With a high speed
CPU it might be possible for the CPU to do ALL the modem work, toggling
the line at high frequency, then just run it through a chip or two and
some sort of isolating transformer. 

Can we get some more use out of the CPU by getting it to handle the disk
drive directly? just use a couple of d-a converter chips so that the CPU
can move the drive head directly from software...

Get the CPU to simply write bytes directly to the video memory rather than
rely on hardware accelleration by fixed firmware... PC's used to work fine
like that.

etc.
