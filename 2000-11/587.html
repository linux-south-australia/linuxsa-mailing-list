&gt; This talk about virus protection for mail servers is a very facinating and
&gt; interesting one indeed. However I have a question; primarily of
&gt; whether this
&gt; IS possible, and secondarily, if it is, how would I go about it:

Reading various information it would appear it's possible. I'm going to try
(but using Kaspersky Anti-Virus, not AVX). I making a sendmail config with
the options I thought I needed, not the RedHat default, but when i tried to
'compile' it, it failed. Now I'm trying qmail (Which i like more already,
even though I havn't got it working), but I've somehow missed the part that
says how to get qmail to listen to the smtp port. I did this last night, so
I was a little tired (i'm a morning person), but I think I need to use inetd
or something similar, but I don't know what to make inetd call.

&gt; My machine is on the net a lot, but I'm not on 24/7.  Is it
&gt; possible to set
&gt; up some sort of mail server on my linux box [with the virus protection
&gt; talked about on this thread] (56K connection to Asia Online), and when I
&gt; connect to the net, it retrieves the mail from my @dove.net.au account and
&gt; stores it on the mail server.

I havn't done this myself (and I'm sure someone will tell you how,
especially if I'm wrong), but I think you need to use fetchmail. Fetchmail
will get mail from your ISP and deliver it to your local system, which will
then do a virus scan then put it into your local users mailbox, which you
can then get.

If I manage to get qmail working on my test system then manage to convert my
(real) mail server to qmail without breaking everything, I'll let the list
know how I went with Kaspersky AV. Kaspersky AV is the one that costs
$108.90 per year. There's a trial version that is available on the website,
and my licence expires some time in January, so I have plenty of time to get
it working to see if it's worth it.

good luck,
Andy
