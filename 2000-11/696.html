&gt;I wouldn't go for RedHat 7.0 quite yet, though. I think it's still a
&gt;little "beta-ish" and RedHat .0 releases can be a little odd at times.

ive had nothing but probs with 7, ive tried it on multiple hardware but have
had littlee success, maybe to much to soon
6.2 ive found damn good, it would be my pick from RH until .1 or .2 are
out(7 that being)
