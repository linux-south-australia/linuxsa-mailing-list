&gt; Running many distributions is good for people who will work mostly with
&gt; Linux boxes in a number of different roles (web server, workstation,
&gt; firewall, etc), but to learn more about operating systems, play with as
&gt; many as you can. This is where FreeBSD and OpenBSD are great fun. They
&gt; are readily available and they are different.

For getting down to some of the nitty-gritty, the Linux Router Project, or
even Slackware. You can do this with Redhat and Mandrake, just ignore the
tools that they put in front of these.

With LRP, it is stripped down to the degree that you are not distracted by
much else. Some other mini distributions are like this as well, but use
their own init process, but the concept is the same.

After a while, you start to see the "Tao of Unix" and they all start to
feel the same , except for subtle differences and focuses (some not so
subtle).
This is the administration level. When it comes to programming at the
system level or making library calls, there can be some nasty gotcha's.
Then you start to think in terms of "What shell am I using", "What X
environment am I using", "Is it System V or BSD oriented", "Is it POSIX",
"What kernel and version am I using", and so on. You see systems in a more
modular way, know what might be common and what the systems specifics
there are.

For slapping a version on your system to have something to look at and
learn and get the initial feel of the whole thing, pick something like
Redhat, Mandrake, Debian Linux, or FreeBSD.

For a nice little Linux to play with to run on on a Windows box without
repartitioning or consuming a virutal filesystem with lots of stuff, try
FreeSCO or LRP or muLinux. This can sit on a floppy or consume way under
10MB of hard disk space. There is a FreeBSD one of these called Pico, but
I am not sure what state it is in.

Dale.
