&gt; I do.  I've felt, for a long time, that there was a compact between the
&gt; utilities and the people to beautify our environment by undergrounding
&gt; these services.  Installing new services above ground puts the lie to
&gt; that idea.  The argument that there are already overhead cables so a few
&gt; more won't make any difference does not hold water.  It's just a thinly
&gt; veiled way of saying that there is no intention -- ever -- of getting
&gt; rid of those cables; and bad luck to the people.  Cables are not pretty.
&gt; Quite the opposite.
&gt; 
I'm sure that David might have forgotten to mention this point...

Every cable you put up overhead is another company you have to negotiate
with to have it moved. Currently you have in South Australia you have
ETSA, Telstra and optus(I belive).. Optus may not be using their cable
but it was installed... Do you really want a few more there. You also
have problems with trees and people growing vines up stobie poles. 

I'll take my chances with the back-hoe any day...
