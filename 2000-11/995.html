Hi
Now that I have managed with the help of people using this address to
get my MS only Canon printer to output the required man pages to an area
of my computer where I can print them and have hundreds of pages of
"stuff" on Samba that might be useful , I want to make a few comments on
the current debate on the apparent dominance of MS in the market .
Although I am pleased to learn that the Linux OS is still part of the
tertiary studies in our institutions  , I suppose the real thrust of
what system is going to get the majority of the market share is going to
depend on Principle Officers in organisations using computers for a
particular purpose  . I was one of these guys years ago and I would be
very surprised if the current ones  not also first find a system that
did the job they wanted and then told the troops to get on with it . If
available printers modems and scanners  did not work with some system ,
open source or otherwise  , of course it was never considered!
While in these elevated positions , probably because of the well known
Peter Principle , I was also an amateur fiddler and still do so on an
old 486SX using Borland C++ in which you can add assembly language
instructions to your code . The early modems and printers came complete
with assembly language instructions for their operation and you could
make them go in a sort of a way and although I never quite succeeded
with MASM  to see how the "smart guys" did it although their assembly
code was there for anyone to assess and modify for their own purpose  by
examining the driver programs .
Well I would be very surprised if there is not people in this country
using the machine's assembly language to develop products and it seems
to me that they are somehow in the pocket of MS to so that the actual
machine instructions are never promulgated but so contrived that they
only work with MS products .  Well I reckon that this action is almost
certainly morally wrong and I believe some you guys out there have a
responsibility to break the nexus . If we let MS get away with what
seems to be uncompetitive behaviour that should be halted by exposing
the code . If you do not I think we could see $A down to $0.30US.
Well finally I add that I am more than a bit disappointed  with the vast
amount of data on Samba and hardly a mention of the operating principle
which I guess to be the assembly of message blocks in TCP/IP for
transmission to other systems  . Overwhelmed by HOWTO's for all
exigencies and no WHY's
thanks for reading this hot Sunday morning!
cheers
Bob Crockart
