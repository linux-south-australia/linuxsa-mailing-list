A "postponed" folder is a wonderful thing. Dredging up from the past I
think it is worth finishing off some comments about the C-Bus. I agree
with Daryl Tester in saying it isn't a good product. Toshiba have
apparently bought the IP rights to the C-Bus, according to the original
poster (circa 1973 or so :)

Daryl said in <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-08/396.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-08/396.html</A> :

&gt; FWIW, I tried twice to deal with Clipsal regarding their C-Bus
&gt; product - in both cases, it was a requirement that I _needed_ to
&gt; deal with the low-level protocol myself, as none of the controllers
&gt; had the capabilities that I needed.  As soon as the person on the
&gt; other end heard that, they'd switch off completely (no pun intended).
&gt; I was firmly given the impression that you bought the entire thing as
&gt; a black box, or it was nothing.  I chose nothing.

I was seconded by UniSA to run a project to build a front-end controller
for the C-Bus before it had been sold anywhere.  I know a little about the
protocol, the chips and the way the whole thing was developed. Certainly
none of it was anything to be proud about, for those on the list that were
trying to work up a bit of regional pride :-) :-) The idea and most of the
preprototype work was done as a out-of-hours hobby by the hardworking and
talented R&D director (a Canadian). The company then took this work (after
years of persuasion) and then did a minimally-funded product development
phase.

This meant that no consideration was given to long-term goals as a hobby
was turned into a production system. Key safety-critical elements are
controlled by uncommented ROMmed assembler understood by one person.  A
strange message structure and design limitations are inherited from the
hobby days, none of which is a reflection on the original author.
