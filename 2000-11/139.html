&gt; If you own/have legitimate access to a piece of hardware, why would it be
&gt; illegal to write software to use on it or to run it?
&gt; For example why would it be illegal for you to write a driver for awin
&gt; modem if you owned one and wanted to and could be bothered?

The recent amendments to the Copyright Act allow reproduction of code
for the purpose of reverse engineering for interoperability.

David Newall replied:
&gt; I'm sure it's not illegal to write a driver for a win modem, but having done
&gt; so the modem would lose it's Austel licence, and so use on an Australian
&gt; public telephone network would be illegal.

The situation is more complex.

Devices attached to the PSTN must meet certain criteria.  These are
usually set by an industry association and approved by the ACA.

These criteria can be essentially met with a letter to the ACA stating
that the criteria have been addressed in the product's design and that
the design workbook supporting this exists and is available for inspection.

There is nothing to prevent the author of a Linux device driver for a WinModem
from assembling a workbook that addresses the software criteria (and distributing
it with the software) and referencing the manufacturer's workbook for all other
criteria.

Furthermore, the criteria may be elided, for example, re-dial rates
are often elided from the workbook and into the owner's manual.
If the owner redials too frequently, then the telco simply
removes service to the approved device that is being used in an
unapproved fashion from the network.

I'm also a bit confused by all the anti-DSP feeling.  DSP-based modems
can actually be more efficient than running a serial modem -- the
interrupt rate is lower as the DSP-based modem can be programmed
to assemble entire PPP frames.  For example, the Cisco 5300 and
similar modem-servers are nothing more than boxes with hundreds of
DSP-based modems.

The real issue is fair access to documentation.  In Australia
the Trade Practices Act gives some support for customers seeking
service manuals for their purchases, so finding a friend at the
ACCC might be a good start if you are serious about building 
fixing the situation.
