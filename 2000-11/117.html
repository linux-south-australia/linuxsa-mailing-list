&gt; Anyone who's run a large bank of modems for dialup knows that serial port
&gt; processng alone takes up a lot of resources for such a small amount of
data,
&gt; that's why so-called "intelligent I/O" multiport boards are so popular.

Now John, I'm sure you know we're talking about a single modem and an
overpowered CPU.  After all, anybody who's run a large data warehouse knows
that you can't beat storage area networks for speed, but let's both agree
that banks of modems, like SAN, are not relevant to this discussion.
Perhaps you are confusing the issue by bringing in interrupt latency issues.

&gt; The same goes for winmodems, anything you can do to use the CPU less on
the host
&gt; computer makes it better to use.

Intel are spending more money than you can poke a stick at trying to find
CPU intensive applications, and they might not agree with you.  The
challenge for chip makers is to find CPU intensive applications to justify
the enormous power CPU that they can now make.  Today's truth is that
anything you can do to use the host CPU makes that CPU a little less idle.

&gt; Some might remember that the early winmodems (originally HFC?) would only
&gt; operate on pentium machines. Why? Because the sorts of calculations needed
&gt; to make a modem signal are much better done with analogue methods, or a
DSP.
&gt; To do the same sort of thing with your normal CPU uses a lot of floating
&gt; point power, which is why a 486 or derivitive could not use them.

A Pentium machine is no longer a "normal" CPU.  It's obsolete and woefully
underpowered.  We are not talking about your vintage 486.

&gt; Some people might argue that a real modem costs $50 more than the winmodem
&gt; and achieves the same effect. Does it? It's quite possible that a winmodem
&gt; uses enough CPU power to make your computer perform like one 50Mhz
slower..

You mean it only operates like a 950Mhz machine?  Damn, that's cruel.  :-)

&gt; which would have cost you perhaps $100 less ..

But don't forget that when the modem isn't processing data, which is 99.999%
of the time, I get to use that extra 50Mhz for important tasks, like
displaying a coolscreen saver.

&gt; The other odd thing with earlier winmodems was that they had problems
&gt; talking to each other, they always liked to have a real modem on the other
&gt; end of the connection ..

Perhaps, but that's true of all cheap modems, isn't it?  I mean, you don't
seriously expect us to believe that moving the CPU from the modem enclosure
to the mother board makes a difference, do you?

&gt; Last, but not least, it's important for everyone to remember that all
&gt; phone-line modems are a hack for a medium that was never designed for
them,
&gt; and that it's really quite ridiculous (or fascinating, depending on your
&gt; PoV) that the future is currently being shaped by their use.

Agreed.  Doubly so for v.90.  (Please, oh please, Nortel, change your
codec.)
