&gt; List,

&gt; I've come accross a strange problem that I have never seen before? It goes like this... :)
&gt; 
&gt; I start my Linux/Win98 workstation and immediatly it pauses at the CPU detection screen?  
&gt; Doesn't check for the RAM of coarse.  After physically turning the PC on and off at X amount of 
&gt; times the workstation finally decides to boot.  I've never had this troble b4.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using an EPOX socket 7 MB and an AMD K6-2 400 o/c to 500 which has been running nicely for 
&gt; nearly a year now.  Usually I would either replace the MB or CPU but I can't figure out why the 
&gt; system decides to boot at different intervals.

HArdware problem, obviously... PC's are nice to work on, you just need to
have some bits to swap around. I had this trouble on a PC here and it was
as simple as wiggling the ram a bit. Must have had a loose connection. I
cleaned it up and it went fine. In this case it could be ram or CPu gone
bad - or even a chip on the MB - had that one as well. 

BTW, I've never had a K6 MB... What are these like? They have a socket 7,
right, but what sort of memory simms/dimms, etc... I'm thinking of doing a
minor upgrade for a PC here that doesn't need much power. Not sure whether
to go K6 (cheap) or duron. (have a 600mhz celeron on another machine,
tempted to compare it to a 600mhz Duron)
