&gt;&gt; If you own/have legitimate access to a piece of hardware, why would it be

&gt;&gt; For example why would it be illegal for you to write a driver for awin
&gt;&gt; modem if you owned one and wanted to and could be bothered?

&gt; I'm no expert there, sorry, but I understand there might be some issues
&gt; with reverse engineering.

There are.

&gt; Hopefully the mfr would be willing to provide
&gt; the specs if you wished to make a driver, but they might not want there
&gt; proprietry code to be released.

It's a lot more involved than releasing the "specs".  In order to save
on the hardware, as most people have correctly surmised, they do a
lot of the DSP work on the motherboard CPU.  Digital Signal Processing
of modem signals isn't trivial (I haven't kept up with recent standards,
but Quad Amplitude Modulation was all the rage when I was a lad), and is
generally done by a dedicated high speed CPU in the modem specifically
designed for DSP use.  In moving something like into the Linux world, you
not only have to duplicate what the normal device driver does (which isn't
that complex - "just" shifting bytes to/from a UART) into synthesizing
and demodulating the signal itself.  A lot of algortihmic gruntiness,
most of which you can bet is proprietary and that manufacturers won't
want the source code floating around for.  Writing one from scratch
won't be trivial.
