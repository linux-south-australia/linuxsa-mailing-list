Richard!

&gt; &gt; Why not modify the mail list handler to strip/filter html attachments?

&gt; or why not let those who get upset about HTML mail delete it.

I do eventually. I haven't quite passed into the "I won't read HTML mail
at all" category...

&gt; I think the evidence is that HTML mail is here to stay, and even if you were to remove HTML mail from the LinuxSA mailing list, it will still prevail elsewhere.

Let's do some simple substitutions. If you remove thieves from Adelaide,
thievery will still happen elsewhere and therefore we shouldn't even
bother about removing thieves from Adelaide...

&gt; Why can't poeple just deal with it?

People can. Seeing I'm not whatever the singular of poeple is, I'm not
certain this applies to me (hehe).

&gt; Many text mail readers handle HTML OK (mutt seems to)

Many companies etc force you to use XYZ, and they seem OK but is XYZ the
most appropriate solution?

&gt; and those that don't could probably do with some development so that they can...

In another thread I have vaguely questioned the development for
development's sake theory.

&gt; whether you call HTML mail progress or not, it really should be up to the receiver (at least, on a mailing list) to deal with it.

I do. I have done.

&gt; You can't enforce your own preferences on a free-for-all mailing list of 400+ people (what are we up to now?).

Apparently you can't express your opinion about it either. Or am I being
too _harsh_? Maybe you are expressing an opinion too. 

&gt; It's impossible.

Oh yes? I'm reasonably certain one could concoct a server side script
that junked anything beginning with &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;/head&gt;, &lt;body&gt; and
&lt;/body&gt;. People who realise their mail IS NOT getting through just might
know that something is wrong...and they might look at the home page and
find out that all HTML mail is junked...

DL 

&gt; PS note that I prefer text mail, even when using OutLook at work, but I can handle HTML mail as well.

P.PS: Express your opinion then. Strongly and with fervour... :-P
