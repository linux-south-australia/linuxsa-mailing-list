&gt; The HD is a Quantum FireBall SE 6.4GB IDE Ultra ATA Mode 4.

Ahhhhhhh, noooooo...

I have seen sooo many fireballs die it's scary. I had one in a brand new
machine approx 3 yr ago. I went to run it up for the company that I was
working for (preinstalled Win95 just had to load on Office) and the
partition table died. Not happy. All of the fireballs in that batch of
machines have since been replaced with Seagates which just keep going and
going and going.

My Bigfoot 6.4 Gb died on me approx 3 months out of warranty. Again not
happy.

Needless to say I am a bit dark on Quantum HDs as I have had nothing but
probs with them. My experience has been Seagate or Fujitsu are the way to go

Oh, I don't like Maxtor's either as I had two brand new 10 Gb drives die on
me within a week of each other about two months ago

Damien


PS: I don't mean to offend anyone on the list by bagging a particular brand
of drive that s/he likes, I am just stating the facts and I know that other
people have they same points of view on Seagate and Fujitsu as I have on
Quantum and Maxtor.
