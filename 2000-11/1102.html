<H1>pppd problem?</H1>

Hey All,

I'm having a problem with my modem connection to work. At work we run a
small dial-in setup for the staff, which up until now has been working fine.
But suddenly I seem to be having a lot of problems. The modem disconnects me
after as short a time as 50 seconds, although it sometimes lasts up to 5
minutes. Whilst I was connected, I ran a ping on the dial-in server, and
here's what I got back:

64 bytes from 192.168.20.3: icmp_seq=95 ttl=255 time=140.6 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.20.3: icmp_seq=96 ttl=255 time=140.5 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.20.3: icmp_seq=97 ttl=255 time=2881.5 ms
wrong data byte #8 should be 0xd but was 0xb
        b a7 21 3a fe 7f b 0 8 9 a b c d e f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

64 bytes from 192.168.20.3: icmp_seq=98 ttl=255 time=1892.1 ms
wrong data byte #8 should be 0xd but was 0xc
        c a7 21 3a fe 7f b 0 8 9 a b c d e f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

        20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a 2b 2c 2d 2e 2f

As you can see, that's up to about ping 100. The first ping reply took 28
seconds, the next took 49 seconds, and then i got a whole stack back, which
counted down in time from the nearly 50 seconds to 140ms. On every single
one that was not 140ms, I got the wrong data byte message.

Anyone have ideas about the possible cause? I'm thinking it might be a modem
problem... But I don't know.  We have 8 lines for dial-in, and I seem to be
the only one having problems...
