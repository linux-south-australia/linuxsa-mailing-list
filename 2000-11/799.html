&gt; &gt;This seems to imply that one could back-hack their program and do all

&gt; &gt;the code is not available doesn't mean people won't be able to find
&gt; &gt;bugs, cause bugs or exploit something...
&gt; 
&gt; the linux version of the source code for my card is available
&gt; www.telemann.com . All outbound data is through the modem, and inbound is
&gt; sent to the satellite to it's mac address.  Is it possible to spoof a
&gt; hardware addresss ... ???

Yes, but the mac address only affects data that you're receiving, not
sending. IHUG will be mapping your IP to a mac address at their uplink.
Either the hardware only accepts frames destined for it's mac address,
or the software doesn't have the code in it to allow an arbitrary mac
address or a promiscuous mode.

My experience was with the Telsat cards, which were used for the starnet
service similar to Ihug Ultra in New Zealand. The software required you
to specify a filter to make sure you only got data for the IP's you
wanted.

Now I've grabbed the telemann code to see what makes it tick .. it acts
like an ethernet driver, and there is some code in there to set the mac
address, although possibly just so linux knows where packets came from..
there's also stuff to allow listening on multicast addresses, which will
need to be independent of mac address. IHUG used to have a page
explaining how to hook linux up to their multicast newsfeed, but the
server isn't there anymore.
