&gt; AVP for Linux, although not open source, is currently free. Everyone
&gt; should be aware that AmaViS chews up _huge_ amounts of resources...

According to www.avp.com.au, AVP for Linux costs $108.90. Am I missing
something?

I downloaded the user manual and it seems to do what I'd like (check both
outgoing and incoming mail. 'global mode of AVPKeeper for Linux'). I only
quickly glanced through the manual, so I'm not sure, but it appears to be
able to reply to person who sent the mail, informing them there was a virus
attached, send a message to the intended receiver, saying that someone tried
to send them a virus, and a mail admin, informing them who sent who a virus.
It doesn't seem to be able to put the name of the virus in the mail (I could
have missed that bit).


Anyway, my mail server (which is also a web server and DNS server) is
running on a P133 with 16M of RAM. Will this be enough? I don't really want
to upgrade the server, because it's hardly ever used (most of it's use is
receiving email, and LinuxSA mail makes up 50% of the total) and I'd like it
to suck as little electricity as possible.

Thanks,
Andy
