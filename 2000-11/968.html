&gt; Ummm... my HD died. One of the resistors one the circuit board appears to have
&gt; cooked, and has left a hard yellow residue around it. Cleverly, I don't back up
&gt; my data, so this means that I have lost a lot of things I really want.
&gt; 
&gt; The HD is a Quantum FireBall SE 6.4GB IDE Ultra ATA Mode 4. The model number
&gt; appears to be "6.4AT P/N SE64A011 Rev 01-B", and the circuit board has "ASSY:
&gt; 20-11438" printed on it. If anyone happens to have one of these, I would pay
&gt; some money for it so that I could attempt to salvage the data by swapping
&gt; circuit boards. Alternatively, if anyone thinks they'd know how to resolder a
&gt; resistor to it, I'd be interested to hear from them. Of course, I may just try
&gt; calling a professional and see what they would charge -- the data isn't worth
&gt; _heaps_ to me, but it's worth quite a few hours of my time, so that's worth
&gt; something...

I have limitted electronic experience, but dabble with a few things, and I
would think the resister would be a symptom, not a cause - so replacing it
wouldn't work. More likely a semi or chip has gone, or something like
that, and the resistor just ended up with too much current through
it... Maybe the whole board could be replaced, assuming it wasn't
something in the drive (motor, etc) that caused it all. (okay, I have had
circuits fail coz the resister failed, but usually it's coz I used a 1/4
watt instead of a 1/2 watt or better... One would think a drive was better
designed than that :-)

What does data recovery cost anyway... I'm assuming that there would be
companies out there who could get the data easily - but I'll bet it
costs. With good reason, no doubt, as you probably have to put the
platters in another drive or something. 

Anyway, can't really help. Only quantum here is a 2 gig bigfoot.
