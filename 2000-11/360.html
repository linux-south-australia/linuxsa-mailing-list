John!

&gt; When people start complaining, you can have the same HTML-email-is-bad
&gt; thread in reverse :)
&gt; "What's that, someone posted something that you can't easily read, Mr
&gt; HTML Poster?"

That seems awfully difficult and lengthy to essentially say something
like I said. I said:

QUOTE
There seems to be a plethora of HTML mail. Could those who use HTML
enabled browsers (eg, Netscape Messenger, Outlook Express and others)
please check to make sure that they use text? There are some people who
have a philosophical grievance with HTML e-mail, and others who just
junk it without reading it.

Now, one can demolish that particular statement in three ways [1]:

1) Go the way of Richard Russell...

It's there. It's here to say. I don't prefer it but I'll cope with it
anyway...

2) Go the John Edwards way...

Create a REAL flame war [2]...

3) Attempt to start a linguistics argument...

Could is the subjunctive, or future imperfect of the modal verb "to be
able to". Hence, the question actually means "is it possible that you
are physically capable of turning off HTML mail?" which I think [3] most
people are able to do.

Personally, I would prefer the third way. It's easier - and much less
work - than having to create a REAL flame war by setting one's
background to pink...

[1]
These are not the only three ways, just examples

[2]
Contrary to what it might seem, I rarely set out to start flame wars. If
people actually realised that I speak with conviction - as opposed to
being arrogant - rather than tip-toeing around subjects half of the so
called flame wars that I supposedly have created would never have
happened.
