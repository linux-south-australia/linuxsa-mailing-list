Dan:

&gt;         I'm writing a script to set up batch jobs on a Beowulf at the uni.

I vaguely remember that you may have been a PHD or masters student at
the University and this was one of your projects. If you are, how's
things going with it?

&gt; Here's the problem: how do I extract a number in an infix from a filename where the infix is of the
&gt; form '.pN.' (where N is the number)?

Because I don't have an example of an actual file name (it would be
useful), a perl regular expression such as:

s/.*\.D(d)+.*/$1/

...reads "match any character, but when you see one single dot, followed
by a non-digit, followed by one or more digits, save that for later and
call it $1". I think you need something that will match the pattern and
then allow you to extract just the digit parts.

Now, I would have thought that sed would be able to find it given that
it works with (slightly different) regular expressions but I hope that
this tip helps.

&gt; Employer required disclaimer (sorry for the bandwidth):

If only all employers were nice enough to include the sorry part (or did
you add it manually)...
