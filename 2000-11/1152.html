Not that you really have all that much interest
in PCI cards supporting the IEC958 TOSLINK ditial audio
standard, but.....

I almost posted a question about linux support for such cards on
this mailing list about 24 hours ago, but I perservered, and
found that the first, best such card suggested by the salesperson
at Allans was indeed supported by the very promising-looking
ALSA software (<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/~goemon/">http://www.alsa-project.org/~goemon/</A>), namely the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

The really surprising thing was that when I phoned the
support people in Melbourne for this Korean card, they said
outright that there was linux support for at least one card
in this family, by which I understood that they were aware of
the ALSA support.
But when I bought the card, I looked on the side, and lo and behold,
this was on the box:

OS Support
	Windows 95/98/2000, Windows NT, Linux

Minimum System Requirement
	Microsoft Windows 95/98/2000/NT, Linux
	etc. etc.

And when I remarked on this, the salesperson raised his eyes to the
sky as if to say "of course".

Well, I just thought I'd share that with you.
I remember that in the olden days, music things provided
support typically for the Mac and the ST (Atari, that is).
Now it's PCs with MS or linux software. I know that most music
gear supports Macs pretty well too.

It's refreshing just for once to not feel that one is part of
some underground sect when bringing up the subject of linux.

I'll let you get on with your breakfast now.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Not that you really wanted to know, but....
the card was a Hoontech Soundtrack YMF 754 Digital-XG.
With this, I can read music digitally into my PC over
fibre/fiber from my Roland VS-880EXHD in real time, as 
opposed to the 32 kbits/second MIDI link.
