&gt; Anyway, works fine with this mandrake hybrid version of 4.01, whatever it
&gt; is. But I had no luck installing on the other box with the TNT2m64. IT
&gt; worked fine (normal non-3d use) on 3.3.6 with mandrake 7.0. With mandrake
&gt; 7.2 and 4.01 it locks the screen and I can't seem to get out of it. The
&gt; box is still running and I can telnet in okay, but shutting X down doesn't
&gt; help and I can't seem to get any responce. In the end I just shutdown -r
&gt; now...

Have you tried downloading the X server from nvidia's website? Maybe that
will help? Although, 3.3.6 supported the TNT2, so I would have thought 4
would work properly. Is the TNT2 listed as compatible in X's docos?

&gt; There doesn't seem to be any option in the install to use 3.3.6, but the
&gt; rpms seem to be included. I'm going to try and manually install 3.3.6,
&gt; except the base package seems to be 4.01 (or some home made mandrake
&gt; thing). Bit confusing for a dummy like me...

If you select 'expert' install it does give you the option. I don't know if
it asks when you select custom, as I've never tried.

I doubt you want to re-install though, so you could try uninstalling the X
version 4 rpms, then install the 3.3.6 rpms, checking the config file, then
it should be able to run fine.

&gt; Anyway, more on the ups and downs of the install later... :-)

I like the installer (the graphical default one), but it completly freezes
my computer after it installs the boot loader, when it gets upto the
'configure X' part. When I reboot, everything's installed, but I get a heap
of errors when it fsck's. :(


Good luck,
Andy
