¡Hola David!  ¿Como está?

Robust discussions, that sounds more like it!

26 is not exactly an underage boy.  (And I must say that I've never
heard such a term used myself.)

I meant subjective as in everybody has their own definition of what
"the best" means.  It cirtainly has a dictionary meaning, but it is
also a term that has a personal meaning transending the strict
definitions of modern English (which I'm sure we all know is flimsy
at best when it comes to upholding strict definitions):

"No Marge, when kids say bad, they mean good.  And to shake your
booty, means to wiggle ones behind.  Permit me to demonstrate."


After all, we don't want this to devolve into petty pedantry, now do
we?  :)

Furthermore such a subjective question was asked in a public forum. 
Had the asker specifically wished a single authorative answer, would
they not have asked a single authorative source.  As such, the
existance of multiple answers (albeit from multiple sources) should
be taken as an absolute cirtainty.  As such the question could not
possibly have beged a singular answer.  The term "best" cirtainly
does imply singular, but the whole question in context, does not.

(And in keeping with my avoidance of pedantry, I wont get into the
issue of such a flippant question "begging" anything.  There was no
pleading involved.  Ooops, no pedantry, bad brain. :)

Es sido conversación agradable con usted por el correo electrónico. 
Miro adelante a hablar otra vez.

&gt; &gt; And David, why is it that every one seems to mention your name in
&gt; &gt; relation to flamewars???
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I wouldn't know. I call them robust discussions...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is because you call people chicken?
&gt; 
&gt; Chicken is a slang term for underage boys. Now, how old are you?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, how does the question beg a SINGULAR answer?  "The Best" is
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; subjective term.
&gt; 
&gt; It begs a singular answer. How can the superlative of "good" have
&gt; an
&gt; either-or answer?

&gt;  I can feel something inside me, say
&gt;  I really don't think you're strong enough....
