&gt; &gt; Postgres has always been an interesting little number, even since the
&gt; &gt; Stonebraker days.  I'm sure that MySQL may have helped push bug fixes,
&gt; &gt; though.  Nothing like a little healthy competition.
&gt; 
&gt; What will if happen if MySQL died away, leaving only Postgresql? 

I think that is pretty unlikely, and almost certainly undesirable. It
seems to me a bit like the way the BSD kernels keep the Linux kernel
honest. More importantly it lets us see what happens when different
technical decisions are made. In the Linux kernel there can be only one
virtual memory manager, one filesystem interface and so on. You need a
whole other operating system in order to try variations on this out on any
large scale, ie a scale that requires months or years of development and
design by several people. 

&gt; I guess
&gt; Oracle is the next target for the developers.

I think Oracle comes well before MySQL in the target list from what I know
of the Postgres team, if MySQL is there at all.  Very few freeware teams
that I know of have as an aim to destroy some other freeware. In a couple
of cases individual members of teams do see the main competition as some
other particular bit of freeware but this is both quite rare and evidently
unsuccessful. Certainly there are plenty of freeware projects that have
died as a result of the success of something else but that is more the way
it all works rather than a result of a non-technical war.

(Along these lines, the feature comparison chart on the mysql home page
wasn't very accurate or friendly up until at least the last time I looked
a few months ago. Hopefully they've changed it.)
