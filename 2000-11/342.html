Howdy all,

I have a few questions if someone could please answer them for me?

1. How do I (or could someone) create a simple mail script that is run by 
CRON that sends mail to a fixed address saying a few things and giving a url 
with the date in it. I want it so that it can send mail to someone saying 
that this weeks stats are now available at xyz.com/stats/20001101.htm I want 
it to be able to take the date from the machine and make the link that date, 
ie YYYYMMDD.htm


2. I have managed to get SSH server installed onto my machine running RH6.2 
I installed it from the RPMS. now I have no idea how to actually get it to 
replace TELNET or get the private/public key things working, could someone 
please explain this to me or give me a url which explains it, I searched the 
net but cannot find anything. Unfortunately I missed the SSH talk by 
Geoffrey.

3. When/IF I manage to get SSH running on my linux box is it possible for it 
to answer on port 80 along with http or can't they both run on the same port 
at the same time??? what about a virtual host???

Thats all (for now!!!!)

Thanks in advance to anyone who can give me a hand with this.


Regards,

Michael Kratz
