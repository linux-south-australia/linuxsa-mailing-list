It is not true, yes we have a licensing agreement with MS, however, as can be
seen with ALL private or public organizations it does not prohibit the use of
alternatives. If you use windows now then YOU have an agreement, you may just
not abide by it.  Unfortunately large organizations are more likely to be
audited.

For the MS paranoid I bring tiding of good news, if you pay attention to the
curriculum at TAFE SA you will see that we will have three modules using linux
next year and we are working hard to make the curriculum LPI objective
compatible. This will mean that those students who want to go further with linux
can do so by taking the LPI exam with some confidence.

BTW Adelaide institute is designing and piloting the new IT training packages,
which will be adopted SA wide. INCLUDING using linux

For those of you who are interested I can assure you there is a substantial push
within the TAFE area to move away from  MS only software application.

e.g.
C++ will be QT based
Servers will be MS & Linux
Web page design will no longer be Front-page but Dreamweaver
Plus numerous other small but significant changes

As i have said in the past on this list, it is not only the hackers  who are
trying to put a stop the the bullshit of MS, many well educated teachers are
doing there bit too, and given some of the politics that go on in a governement
departments we are doing it tough sometimes.

&gt;
&gt; I have been setting up Linux servers as the student / intranet / proxy
&gt; servers for a few public schools now. The staff are more than happy with it,
&gt; but I'm not sure how that fits in with education department policty ...

&gt; &gt; Worse. They have been targetting schools also. There are schools
&gt; &gt; offering MCP. Microsoft had a propaganda-fest a while ago, where
&gt; &gt; Microsoft spoke to the Catholic Schools about the whole thing. They'd
&gt; &gt; like MCP done by yr10 and the possibility of MCSE by the end of yr12.
&gt; &gt; It's a problem. Schools should remain product independent.
&gt;
&gt; I'm almost certain a teacher friend of mine was saying that it's
&gt; Education Dept. policy to have a Windows NT Server (whether it's useful
&gt; to the school or not)...

&gt; Don't you find it rather touching to behold
&gt; The OS that came in from the cold
&gt; Seen for what it is: religion, plus finesse
&gt; Countries, creeds, mean nothing - only Linux...
