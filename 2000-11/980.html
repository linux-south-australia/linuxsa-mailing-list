&gt; Maybe not, I've got my ACT PC User Group meeting notes

&gt; [Bill personally, he did his own ranting then]

Bill did this in the late _1970's_ when Microsoft had
their 4K and 8K BASIC (on paper tape), as reported by
Doctor Dobb's at the time.  Microsoft themselves had
barely been around 5 years (having formed in 1975).

&gt; So maybe it's just a continuation of a well-worn
&gt; theme.

Unfortunately, I can't find a copy of the original letter,
but one of the things he mentions is that "piracy deprives
Microsoft of the funds to build a better quality product."

&gt; And they're offering cash for unis
&gt; to use MS development software (although the offer
&gt; isn't put as bluntly as that).

Shades of McDonalds' University, or "Pepsi Presents Arithmetic"
from the Simpsons:

Troy: If you have three Pepsis and drink one, how much
      more refreshed are you?  You, the redhead in the
      Chicago school system?
Girl: Pepsi?
Troy: Partial credit!
