&gt; Daniel,
&gt; First of all have you tried putting your clock speed back to normal?

I agree... this has to be the first step.

&gt; Have you recently opened up the case and possibly dislodged something?
&gt; David is right (as always :P)

Not always....

&gt; &gt;Daniel!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm using an EPOX socket 7 MB and an AMD K6-2 400 o/c to 500 which has
&gt; been running nicely for
&gt; &gt;&gt; nearly a year now.  Usually I would either replace the MB or CPU but I
&gt; can't figure out why the
&gt; &gt;&gt; system decides to boot at different intervals.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I am going to be as nice as possible here. You have overclocked a chip
&gt; &gt;from 400 to 500. And now you are experiencing hardware problems which
&gt; &gt;are intermittent after nearly a year. I note that you possibly are a
&gt; &gt;student, so I may forgive you on age but:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1) Do chips have speed ratings for no purpose?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;No. Overclocking generally eventually kills them. And it voids the
&gt; &gt;warranty.

No... overlclocking does NOT kill hardware if done properly.
But yes of course it viods warranty (that of course if the reseller/OEM can
prove its been overclocked).

&gt; &gt;2) If we don't follow the instructions of the universe, can we expect
&gt; &gt;things to behave normally?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;No.

Yes.... since when has there been instructions to the universe??
Instructions are there to be followd and then improved apon.
If overclocking is done properly, there are no side-effects (like
instablility). So if you can get a PC to run 25% faster for no extra cost
with no stability problems, why not??

The www.overclockers.com.au site is run on dual 450 celerons with both CPUs
running at 550... its running linux and hasnt had one single problem since
the PC was set up as a web server 145 days ago.

&gt; &gt;It boots at different intervals because it's an intermittent (look your
&gt; &gt;dictionary up) problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The short of this little note is that overclocking WILL not probably
&gt; &gt;will but WILL shorten the life of your CPU. I supsect, for your CPU,
&gt; &gt;it's game over.

Bollocks.... overclocking ONLY EVER reduces the lifespan of hardware if it
running over temprature or its running at a higher voltage than whats
specified.

I suspect that your CPU is either running hotter than normal because of the
recent hot weather (and causing the weird problems), or that for some reason
a hardware/software configuration setting has caused it to become unstable.
