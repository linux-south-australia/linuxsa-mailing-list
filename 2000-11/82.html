&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That much is clear.  I'm trying to find some other message in your
&gt; &gt; &gt; statement.  Certainly Open Source operating systems will get nowhere
&gt; &gt; &gt; if they don't run on currently available hardware.

Operating Systems that accept and support inferior hardware simply
because it exists does not make any sense at all to me. That hardware
exists because of the capitalist, profit-making lunacy of the
conservative (not liberal) economic viewpoint. As others appear to be
pointing out, the total cost of ownership (if you can measure such
things as difficulty to use, system downgrade and such) is far higher
than the dollar cost of purchase.

Incidentally, before anyone starts to accuse me of being "left wing",
"keynsian" or "anti-conservative" I believe that free market forces when
measured for total cost of ownership (taking into account the effect on
the environment, how difficult it is to use, how much maintenance) can
work. It's a pity so many conservative minded economists can only speak
in dollars.

&gt; &gt; Yes, but really the hardware mfr should be writing the drivers, as they do
&gt; &gt; for windows.
&gt; 
&gt; and to come full circle, that's just what Lucent have done - well, they
&gt; out-sourced it, but in essence that's what they did. The ltmodem driver
&gt; is a proprietary bit of software sponsored by Lucent.

I see. So perhaps I assumed that people who said WinModems meant
WinModems...something has gone wrong today. I don't appear to be
translating English terribly well.

&gt; Notwithstanding that Winmodems are a not-really-bright-thing anyway

I was saying they are stupid. Not-really-bright is simply a watered down
version of that.

&gt; the
&gt; fact is there are lots of them out there in pre-existing systems

There are a lot of dud systems out there so let's support them all...

&gt; when an owner of one comes and asks if (s)he can use it if (s)he
&gt; installs Linux, our answer should be well-informed and informative.

Well, apart from not noticing that Lucent have written a driver for this
not-really-bright-thing anyway, I'm not entirely sure my answer wasn't
informative. 

&gt; Using a request for help as a soapbox to rant from is in my opinion
&gt; simply purile. 

Communicating one's feelings and emotion is part of the human
experience. That a subject has aroused such a lengthy debate is wholly
indicative to the feelings and thoughts about it.

&gt; If the module exists, simply say so, and point to it if
&gt; you know anything about it. If you know nothing about it, say precisely
&gt; that.

I gave one of many answers to the original question. Distilling the
ranting - as you put it - most people seem to agree to a certain extent
with the substance of what I said, whilst some do not agree with the
manner in which I said it. However, I am willing to grant that _I_
believe that WinModems are a stupid, brain-dead idea that the Linux
community would best not encourage.

&gt; Is it Friday yet?

Yes, it is. By the time you receive this e-mail it may very well be the
weekend.
