Hi Everyone,

This should be a quick question.

I am running an NT Domain here and we develop in ASP (eeek, I hear you all
say!) but we are trying to convert to PHP and doing so on a rapid scale.
At the moment programmers are used to logging into the NT Domain and
having the shares available so they can editthe files on the share and
save them and view them. I have recently added a Linux box to the network,
on UIP address 192.168.0.122. At the moment people see their files via
<A HREF="http://192.168.0.122/~username/test.php">http://192.168.0.122/~username/test.php</A> etc etc. I would like this to work
so that they login and they are allocated a share that they would see (eg
I login and I am automatically mapped to the linux box on drive (say z:)
and I am able to add and edit the files that I veiew on
<A HREF="http://192.168.0.122/~nigel/">http://192.168.0.122/~nigel/</A> There is no users on the linux box apart from
the ones that I create manually. (Eg me, sysadmin, 1 test user etc etc. )
Is there an easy way that I can create this system. I have tried a simple
system at the moment of having one share (<A HREF="http://192.168.0.122">http://192.168.0.122</A>) is a share
(/home/httpd) and everyone has access to this (even though I have stuffed
it up and no-one can write to the files but they can read them. 

I have read the documentation back to front, but I hate documentation and
can't seem to make heads or tails of it. Everything I try seems to be
ambiguios and I feel I have done it the right way. 

What I need is someone or something (a manual) that has what I am tryu\ing
to do step by step, including file permissions (as I am lackign in
education here), directories, etc etc.

Please excuse my spelling in this E-Mail as I am using a very slow telnet
session and can't be bothered back-spacing which takes about 2 minutes
each time I press it,.

Thanking everyone in advance...

Regards,

Nige
