&gt; AVX for Linux

AVX doesn't seem to be as flexible as AVP (from www.avp.com.au). AVP had a
~130 page manual (downloaded from the website. it seems to be in MS word
format though, but that's not a problem for me), and it seems to plug
'directly' into sendmail (add 'FEATURE(local_avp)' and 3 more lines to your
sendmail config. the manual tells you how to do it). AVX on the other hard,
and a .txt file, explaining how to use it. The help doesn't say anything
about using it to scan email, but I guess you could use AmaViS or something
similar with it.

As for updates, I couldn't find anything for AVX on the www.avp.com website.
the web site says the program contains an option to get the update itself,
but this may only be for the windows version. I couldn't see any option
documented in the help file. The AVP documentation says that you can get
updates from the AVP makers homepage (i can't remember the URL, but it was
something that ended with .ru). The AVP documentation also says there's a
AvpUpdater program that can get it for you (I havn't downloaded it yet).

Although AVP costs money, it appears to be a good product, or at least it
impressed me with it's documentation (which seems to include complete
examples of sendmail and qmail configurations).

Anyone had any real experience with either of these products?
