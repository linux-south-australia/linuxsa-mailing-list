&gt; That's not my recollection, but I don't have any facts to back me up either.
&gt;From my memory I believe the coalition took about 52% for the last election, but
&gt; around 54% when they last _lost_ the election.   Feel free to correct me with
&gt; facts.

OK :) I was curous, and not completely sure, but check out:

<A HREF="http://www.aec.gov.au/results/1998/tally_room/hor/two_party.htm">http://www.aec.gov.au/results/1998/tally_room/hor/two_party.htm</A>

ALP: 50.98, Coalition: 49.02
A difference of about 200,000 votes. In the context of an Australian
election, that makes to 200,000 or so difference in the US look quite
paltry, as it's a *much* larger percentage.

&gt; I reckon we'd have better government if we automatically tossed out a government
&gt; every 2 elections (sort of extending the American toss-out-the-president idea)
&gt; so the opposition can correct the complete stuff-ups of the previous government,
&gt; whatever their persuasion :-)

I dunno, there wouldn't be any incentive to do a good job. :)
Seriously, the most democratic system I've heard of is the NZ system,
which has only been around about 5 years I think. Don't know if it makes
for good government, though.

&gt; Leaving this really OT thread,

Yeah, me too. Mind you, it's easier to leave a thread when you've had
the last word. :) Feel free to continue privately, anyone.
