Hi Everyone. I have been trying to install the grace plotting 
package. I've rebuilt the SRPM for grace for ppc architecture without any
problems, but I can't get pdflib (one of graces dependecies) to rebuild
properly. The problem seems to be that make is installing in /usr/lib (see
below) while RPM is looking on the right place (/tmp/pdflib-root/usr) and
so fails to find it. I've spoken to the packegaer and he gave the anserws
you can see below. What he is suggesting seems to be right, but I can't
figure out how to fix it. Does anyone have a good grasp of makefile
authoring that can help me? Also, sort of on the same line, is there
anywhere I can find a good description of spec file authoring (it's
probably about time I learnt)?

Sorry about the length of this.

thanks
Dan Kortschak

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Hi Dan,

there seems to be something wrong with your "make" version. Usually, configure
should create Makefiles which use a variable called "prefix". And usually the
value of that variable can be overridden by adding arguments to the "make
install" call. This is what happens in the SRPM rebuild as well:

make prefix=/tmp/pdflib-root/usr install

Make then enters the pdflib subdirectory and "sub-calls" make in that
subdirectory

cd pdflib && make install

Usually the "prefix=..." argument should set the "prefix" environment variable
to the specified value for all "sub-calls" of make. That's why the "make
install" in the pdflib directory should have set "prefix" to "
/tmp/pdflib-root/usr" as well --- although you can't see it on the command line
(it is just a "make install"), the make in the pdflib subdirectory should know
from the "prefix" environment variable that it has to install the files in
/tmp/pdflib-root/usr instead of the default /usr, and this environment variable
should be set by the initial "parent" make.

So I suppose that for some reason your installation of the make program does not
correctly convey command line arguments of a parent "make" as environment
variables to the child "make"s.

This is not a problem of the pdflib SRPM but rather of your make environment.
Try upgrading the make RPM, or search the Linux PPC news groups if you can find
something about this problem.

Regards

Henrik

Hi Dan,

I don't really know why the make works with grace while it doesn't with
pdflib.
It is difficult for me to figure that out since on my machine things are
workingas they should. All I know is that make should use the environment
variable
MAKEFLAGS to convey any variable set on the command line to
"sub-makes". So
maybe you can try to add a line to the Makefile in the pdflib subdirectory
(directly below the line beginning with "install", and don't forget the
leading
tab in that line) which echoes this variable ("echo MAKEFLAGS ==&gt;
$(MAKEFLAGS)")to see if they were defined correctly.

Regards

Henrik
