G'day folks,

[...snip...]

I've written a mini-faq on ORHH and Data over Voice:

#######################################################################
How to get ISDN speed access to the Internet without paying huge
data call charges to Telstra.
#######################################################################

Get an OnRamp Home Highway installed (or better, have your existing
MODEM line converted into ORHH for half the price, circa $196 inc GST).

ORHH is OnRamp2 ISDN, but with a different pricing plan and a new
type of NT1 (network termination device, or box that sits at your
location).

Telstra's idea was to provide digital telephony to the home, two
64k channels arriving as two analog ports on the back of the NT1,
plus the ability to use an RS232 port to make 64k/128k ISDN data
calls (the NT1 emulates a modem on an RS232 port at 115200 baud),
and the NT1 also has a standard ISDN S/T port, all this using only
ONE existing copper line to the house.

What is Telstra's motivation to do this?  It costs them the price
of the NT1 hardware to provide a second line to a household that
wants one using ORHH.  It costs them hours and hours of expensive
labour and one or two fully equipped telco vans for several hours
to install a new copper line in a house (that doesn't already have
an existing second line, which is surprisingly the majority of all
domestic residences).

Here's the tarrif bits:

* local VOICE calls are UNTIMED flat rate ($0.18 plus GST per call),
  so you can plug one or two modems in the analog ports and dial a
  local numbers for a flat local call fee - just like a normal line;

* local 64k or 128k DATA calls are TIMED per 64k channel at $1/hour
  per channel (either on the RS232 port or on the S/T port) - very
  similar to OnRamp2, except no Xpress plans are available and you
  don't normally get an RS232 port on an OnRamp2;

"How is this useful to me", you ask?

Well, think about this for a minute:

* Local VOICE calls are untimed flat rate.

* Local DATA calls are timed.

Both of these call types are being made on the ISDN network.  They
both use the same digital path via the exchange to the destination.

The only difference between a 64k VOICE call carrying G.711 encoded
voice and a 64k DATA call carrying data is a single FLAG set at the
ISDN level during the establishment of the call.

"How does that help me", you ask?

It's a process called Data over Voice (DoV).  Cisco routers have
supported it for years, but only recently have fixed a bug that
prevented it from working properly in Australia.

You can nail up a 128k ISDN Data over Voice call for a flat rate
$0.18 (plus GST) per channel, and LEAVE IT UP just like a permanent
modem link, and it will cost you as much as an analog voice modem
call would!

"What's the catch", you ask?

Only a few routers/devices support DoV right now, and that includes
normal dialin access servers that ISPs use - a few ISPs have almost
finished implementing DoV indial on their access servers and soon
many will be announcing pricing plans (I've tested one production
system at home myself, its just the phone number that changes).

So, to summarise:

* you *will* be able to order (as a private home user) an OnRamp
  Home Highway from Telstra today;

* you *will* be able to use it as two normal phone lines in the
  interim while DoV support is finalised with ISPs; and

* you will be able to use DoV to dial ISPs (before Christmas I
  would expect - ring around and ask)!

More information, including a list of ISPs that support DoV or plan
to support it "Real Soon Now[tm]" can be found at Traverse, a company
which sells ISDN PCI cards and devices that support DoV:
