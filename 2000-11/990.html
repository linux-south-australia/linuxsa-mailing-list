&gt; I sometimes say to people 'use linux, it's cheap/free' and they say 'heck,
&gt; I get codes etc off the web and use copies of win software for free'. But
&gt; see, they are stealing, whatever. I don't really care and frankly due to

Tim,

I like/liked to explain linux in this way:

	With linux, everything is difficult.
	With MS, half the tasks are easy, the other half are impossible.

But now that during the last couple of years so many really
user-friendly GUI applications have come out, I'd have to amend that:

        With linux, half the tasks are easy, the other half are difficult.
        With MS, half the tasks are easy, the other half are impossible.  

My favourite slogan is:

	The Source be with you!

But how would people feel about having the bonnet of their car
locked so that they couldn't view the works or fix the car?
That's an MS car. Linux is sometimes like a car with the
bonnet permanently removed!
Linux car owners are continually working under the bonnet - but that's
because they _can_!

--------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; I'd like to see more people getting more for their work with linux, but
&gt; then I happily do stuff for nothing when I can (I just wish I could
&gt; progress past working with ncurses and move into some gui stuff :-)  I
&gt; seem to have lost the ability to learn anything at the moment!)

Perl/Tk!!!!

I said "rubbish" when I first saw tcl/tk.
But having written heaps of perl/tk software now, I can say that
this is the most pleasurable way to get into linux GUI programming.
If _I_ had more time/energy, I'd prepare my long threatened 
linuxSA talk on Perl/Tk.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
