John!

&gt; Incidentally since swapping to an external modem (Maestro Companion) I have
&gt; noticed that although it connects at the same speed as the previous software
&gt; modem (49.2Kbps) it seems to get better throughput on downloads than the
&gt; winmodem.  I guess it stands to reason that if you tie up your CPU doing
&gt; modem DSP stuff it can't be turning around packets as fast as when you
&gt; offload that to external hardware.

How intriguing. You seem to have stated, succinctly and perhaps without
creating a flamewar, that hardware modems may achieve better throughput
than software modems despite what others might tell you and all the
hooha about how they are all the rage and that we should support the
contraptions. 

Now, whether this implies that you think that the winmodem you used to
use is "stupid" is up to you, nonetheless I would question your sense of
togetherness if you decided to go back to using it and hence getting
worse throughput on downloads than the hardware modem [1].

Oh, and who got the free beer?

No, this isn't aimed at you directly; I am - and quite brazenly - taking
a side swipe at others :-)
