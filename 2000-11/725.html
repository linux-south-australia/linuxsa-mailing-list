Robert!

I am going to assume that you are just "waffling" to noone in particular
primarily because that's what your message sounds like [1].

&gt; Swapped my RH6.1 for a Mandrake 7.1  recently with an working copy of
&gt; Samba included.

It's good to hear that Mandrake distribute a copy of SAMBA that actually
runs without causing a segfault or other error. I presume you meant it
understands your smb.conf file.

&gt; Although I had fooled printtool in RH into thinking my
&gt; Canon 2000SP was a 610 as far as StarOffice and Netscape were concerned
&gt; , enabling me to print most of what I needed to print  , Mandrake aint
&gt; so accommodating

Aside from the Americanisms - such hideous convoluted, imported,
gramatically incorrect phrases such as "ain't" [2] - I'm not certain why
Mandrake, based on RedHat distributions, won't speek to the Canon
2000SP. Presuming you've kept your RedHat CD's you could install your
old printtool and see what it comes up with.

&gt; but offers the hope of using Samba to use the printer
&gt; while running on the Win98 part of my machine.

Now I'm confused. You're saying that the Windows 98 is on the SAME
machine? Reading your e-mail with your illustrious grammar I can only
presume that's what you mean [3]...

&gt; The Catch 22 situation
&gt; arises in trying to get all the stuff I need to compile smb.conf to do
&gt; this in a mull-over or hard copy form . OK OK buy the bloody book....
&gt; thats a trip to town and $'s I aint got!.

I think what you're saying is that you don't know how to do it and you
think you should buy Richard or someone else's Samba book...

&gt; Anyway seems to me I am going to run into a font problem anyhow.

Fonts are dreadful things, almost always proprietary of some sort and so
forth...

&gt; When I
&gt; output a man page to say Office or /mnt/win_c ie 'man samba &gt;
&gt; ./Offfice51/Desktop the bold type fonts come up wrongly , ie bold p
&gt; comes up as 'p#p' making most of the stuff hard to read and it prints as
&gt; shown.

Well you could try rendering it as html, and then printing it using some
browser. Look up man man2html.

&gt; Putting the same output into MS Windows does the same thing with
&gt; the bold fonts and seems to leave out all the LF's CR's as well .

This is Linux. Of course it leaves out all those extraneous bits and
pieces...

&gt; Yeh well the "locate font" command comes up with 8120 lines of bumff and
&gt; I got a feeling that the printer like the old ones I dealt with decades
&gt; ago only responds to specific ESC($27) sequences that is held as a dark
&gt; secret by the printer purveyors like Canon to Bill Gates .

Canon 2000SP's aren't that old are they?

&gt; Well getting Samba to run seems like it might open a few more computing
&gt; doors than simple printing and I will keep plugging at it and reckon I
&gt; shall probably get there in the end . Thanks for reading!
&gt; cheers

I'm sure you will. I'm not sure I've been of any help but still...

[1]
I prefer to speak my mind rather than beat around the bush

[2]
Although "ain't" is an Americanism, I consider an apostrophe necessary
as the "t" is obviously a contraction of "it"

[3]
Your style of writing in this documen is that you've written how you
would speak. It doesn't work. It doesn't make sense. Without hearing and
seeing you speak it, I can't exactly determine a context nor ask you
what you actually meant. And as I remarked at point [1], you do sound
like you're rambling rather than really asking for help...

My point is, be more specific and try to be more clear.
