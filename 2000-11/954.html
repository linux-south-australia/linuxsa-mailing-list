Richard,
With all due respect I beg to differ. I don't think at any stage Leigh was
pluggin Inode other than informing us of their intent in offering ADSL.
This is no, IMHO, different to someone asking which ISP(s) supports Linux
to which receive a plethora of Chariot are good Linux and Senet and and and
...

I asked a simple questions as to alternative offerings to which Leigh and
others replied for which I thank them.

I'd really hate to alienate someone like Leigh from the list who as far as
I can see in my brief time on the list has been valuable (as have a host of
others).

Finally I agree blatant spamming of unsolicited commercial information is
not appropriate on the list and really should not be accepted in any sense.
I think we get enough of that via alternative sources.

evan gets off his soap box.

:)


&gt;Can I suggest that we all take a little think about this Advertising
issue... I
&gt;would like to suggest that as SA's Linux User's Group, our role is (as
seen on
&gt;www.linuxsa.org.au/linuxsa) "To promote and support Linux in South
Australia".
&gt;This is very broad, and means that we should be supporting users, developers,
&gt;retailers, customers, and pretty much anything that has the word Linux in it.
&gt;
&gt;In relation to Ads and Plugs (they are different), surely these are
generally a
&gt;good thing. The more businesses that support and use Linux, the better.
Surely
&gt;we should be encouraging businesses to support linux, and surely we would
want
&gt;to know about them, so tha we can use them when we need to, recommend them
when
&gt;asked, and generally know the state of affairs in the Linux world in
Adelaide.
&gt;
&gt;BTW: an Ad (in my mind) is unsolicited, and blatantly trying to sell or
promote
&gt;something. It's sent by the marketing person at a company, and looks like
an ad.
&gt;A Plug (again, in my mind) is relevant to the topic of conversation, and
comes
&gt;as a digression from the real subject of an email (eg: Answering a question
&gt;about something, and then mentioning/recommending a company that one works
for).
&gt;
&gt;I think an appropriate behaviour is for people, when advertising, to either:
&gt;1) send via the <A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A> address, asking an organiser to
&gt;forward it on their behalf.
&gt;2) send it direct, with the subject prefixed with [AD].
&gt;personally, I think 2 is the best option, as it is more open...
&gt;
&gt;When plugging, people should make it clear that they work for or are
associated
&gt;with a certain company (or their sister company -- Internode and Agile are
&gt;separate, but _very_ close). Likewise, it would be a good idea to mention
that
&gt;you are _not_ associated with a company if you are just plugging a company
you
&gt;have heard to be good....
&gt;
&gt;As an eg, I would suggest that Leigh's stuff about ADSL has generally been of
&gt;the Plug type -- it has been in context of answering questions about ADSL,
but
&gt;is plugging a company he is closely associated with. IMHO, perhaps he should
&gt;have just made it clear that he was plugging, and that he has an association
&gt;with that company, and that would be acceptable. The SeNET mail was
actually not
&gt;an unsolicited ad, but in response to a request for info... ("Senet are
&gt;reportedly getting close, but can anyone from Senet confirm or deny this
&gt;report/rumour?" -- from Dan Shearer) The person stated that they were from
&gt;SeNET, and it was obviously a plug, and was not, in any way sly or
underhanded.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, That's all from me.
