&gt; Interesting -- When did maintainability become a property of a language,

Ever since I had to maintain my own Perl scripts, and had difficulty.
I'm a fairly careful sort of person - comment reasonably and clearly
(for the most part), and have even been known to document on
occasion.  However, when I started using Perl's reference and object
oriented features, I started spending more time trying to get the
syntax of references right and messing with the OOP machinery than
actually getting any useful work done.  When I started cutting and
pasting code from templates because I didn't understand how the OOP
mechanism worked, then I got really worried.  I won't even go into
maintaining other people's scripts (except that you really learn to
dislike the phrase "TMTOWTDI", because most people pick a way that's
disimilar to yours).  If you spend more than 10 to 20 hours a week
on the language, I'm sure these variations would stay fresher in
your (well, my) mind, but some of us don't have that luxury.  Me, if
I never see a bless() or shift again, I'll die a happy man (yes,
shift peeves me in shell too :-).

I'm not advocating the other P language that I've been known to
expose on occasion[1].  Perl's string manipulation and RE builtin
operations (how topical!) beat Python's hands down, and as I stated
before, POD is funky.  It's when I go back to a reasonable sized
system after an absence of a year and have trouble making relatively
simple changes to it, _that_ annoys me.

Yes, I believe maintainability is a property of a language.  It's
The Reason I No Longer Use Perl (acronymyze that, Mr Wall!).

[1] Well, maybe a bit.  Take the following -

class Foo:
  def Bar(self):
    print "Foo has been Bar'd"

f = Foo()
f.Bar()
Foo has been Bar'd

Mmmmmm, simple for a feeble minded person like myself.
