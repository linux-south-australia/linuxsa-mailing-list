Hi Richard

Thanks for the speedy reply I have the lines for swat in the appropriate files.
Do I need smbd and nmbd running when I use Swat? When I try to use Swat in
Netscape I get the following error 'Netscape is unable to locate the server
localhost:901'.

Any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong?

Robyn

&gt; &gt;Hi guys
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I removed the Samba rpm that came with RH7 and compiled Samba 2.0.7, I am
&gt; &gt;trying
&gt; &gt;to do more compiling that just use the rpm. Now smbd and nmbd aren't in the
&gt; &gt;list
&gt; &gt;of daemons (I think that's the right word) in Linuxconf to be enabled at
&gt; boot.
&gt; 
&gt; There are a number of problems with this (compiling your own stuff). Two
&gt; with Samba are:
&gt; 
&gt;   - The RPM actually puts things (smbd, nmbd, etc) in different places
&gt;     than the Samba compile and install process does.
&gt; 
&gt;     This is partially what you are experiencing. That and the fact that
&gt;     you do not have an smb script in /etc/rc.d/init.d. There is a sample
&gt;     script in the source.
&gt; 
&gt;   - The configure.in and thus configure script supplied with the source
&gt;     does not compile in PAM, because there are too many Linux distros that
&gt;     either do not have PAM, or have the PAM libraries but do not use PAM.
&gt; 
&gt;     I am trying to get a better test into configure.in, but in the meantime
&gt;     you probably will need to rebuild Samba to include PAM. Do this by
&gt;     reruning configure:
&gt; 
&gt;     ./configure --with-pam
&gt; 
&gt;     You might want to delete config.cache first.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The other problem is that I don't have a inetd only a xinetd on the same
&gt; list
&gt; &gt;as
&gt; &gt;above and I'm trying to set up Swat and I don't know where to put it so that
&gt; &gt;it
&gt; &gt;starts up properly.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you will need an entry for SWAT. You could copy and modify the Telnet
&gt; entry, for example ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The hard drive thrashing problem is still there but it's not as bad.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hope this makes sense
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Robyn
