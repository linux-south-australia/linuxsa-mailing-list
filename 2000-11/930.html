Tim!

&gt; may ask some advice about security later... Not sure how much I need to
&gt; worry, but the box does connect to the net for 3-4 hours every night

A general level of concern is always a good thing.

&gt; dynamic IP etc... At the moment I'm running all sorts of services to test
&gt; and play with, like httpd and ftp. Also like to telnet in from the other
&gt; box...

If you're doing that on the box that is connected to the Internet then I
think you probably do need to take notice a little bit more.

&gt; Should I set up the 486 (if it still goes) to do the ipmasq and
&gt; maybe a printer server rather than use my main linux box.

That is a subjective question that only you can answer. You could set it
up as such, but my main comment would be that it may not be terribly
fast, especially at boot up. Factors:

* it's a 486
* it's only got 8 MB of RAM
* my bet is that the swap disk will be very slow (compared to today's
HDs)

I'd be inclined to boost it to 16MB although I daresay you could get
away with just 8MB.

&gt; Or is that
&gt; overboard for this set up and should I just turn off the services on the
&gt; main box (this one) and set up ssh if I want to get in from the other
&gt; room.

You should experiment. It will give you something to learn and teach you
more if you happen to want to go further with Linux.

&gt; Is ssh difficult... 

To crack, yes. To setup, no.

&gt; Also is there a safe way to leave http and ftp
&gt; on this box.

Write the letters with texta :-) The answer is yes. I'd be inclined to
sit them behind a firewall on a security audited machine.

&gt; I usually have three machines on the net and share files
&gt; arround. I've used various things, but lately it's mostly been SMB, so
&gt; maybe I should dump the rest and just use samba to move files when I need
&gt; to...

I presume you mean Samba. The other machines would be Windows
machines...now this implies that you're letting your Samba server
respond to any person (script kiddie) on the Internet who happens to
scan port 139. Whilst Samba in itself isn't a security risk, it's easy
to accidentally share shares and files or do other silly things without
realising it until it's too late.

Personally I would setup a separate firewall, or at least run one on the
gateway machine.
