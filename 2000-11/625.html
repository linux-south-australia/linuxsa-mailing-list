&gt; To 'compile' a Sendmail mc file on Redhat, you'll need m4 and the
&gt; sendmail-cf packages installed.

Yeah, I have those, and I went through the README only including the options
I thought I needed (not using RedHat's default config as a reference -
mistake here, right?). When I finished and put it through m4, it didn't
complete successfully (I can't remember the error message, but I still think
I'd like to run qmail instead. Only problem is, to use AVP with qmail, you
need to replace qmail-queue with their own pre-built binary, so who knows
what they've done in it, and what patches they've included in it.

&gt; The prefered way to run qmail is with Dan's tcpserver program.

I saw that (after installing qmail), so I downloaded it and installed it,
but I havn't figured out where the config files are, or how to run it, once
the config is made :)

I also figured out I need to get 'checkpassword' to use qmail-pop3d. I'll do
that once I can get qmail to accept messages.

I must warn you though, that I'm in exam period at uni, with my final exam
today, so I've theoretically been too busy learning for exams to make qmail
work. We won't talk about what really happened ;)

wish me luck (for the exam as well as getting qmail working, thanks) ;)
Andy
