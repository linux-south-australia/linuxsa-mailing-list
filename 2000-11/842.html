G'day Tim,

    These comments more probably belong in a review on the Toshiba Tecra
8100.  I have both loaded Red Hat 7.0 de novo and upgraded it from Red Hat
6.2.  You need to use text installation.  Installation de novo works just
fine.  However when you upgrade, the system hangs halfway through rebooting.
I haven't had time to investigate why as yet.

    I have also read that the old glib libraries are not loaded on the disc
and therefore WordPerfect will not work.  Again, I haven't had time to
investigate this properly.  I won't go into the other wrinkles on sound,
video and modem.

    Since I need a word processor, I will probably put Red Hat 6.2 back

Cheers,  Rick McQueen-Thomson

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just ordered Redhat 7 respin edition to upgrade from 6.2 then after I
&gt; &gt; noticed on some lists on the web that there seems to be some deep
&gt; &gt; concerns about this upgrade. One comment even went as far as to say that
&gt; &gt; there were 2,500 bugs in it, reportedly based on information sourced
&gt; &gt; from the Redhat bug notification site.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been unable to find any reviews on this upgrade.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Do you know of any reviews or have you had any experience or comments on
&gt; &gt; the upgrade.?
&gt;
&gt; I've heard a few people say it was 'very bad'. Not for critical use, pain
&gt; in the bum to compile stuff, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Probably wouldn't worry me as a system to play with, but doubt I'd use it
&gt; for the main box - I like to wait for .2 releases :-)
&gt;
&gt; BTW I install RH6.2 on a box for another person the other day and I must
&gt; say I do think Mandrake has a nicer final product for the new
&gt; user. Desktops set up better, etc. I used RH as it was a 5x86 chip on a
&gt; 486 MB, and it works lovely, but it's just not as good for the linux
&gt; unaware... Or at least it would take a lot more setting up to get 'right'.
&gt;
&gt; So I'm getting MAndrake 7.2 next... They are all good and have their good
&gt; points, and I started on Slack, but I just want something quick and easy
&gt; for the main working machine...
