&gt; Unfortunately, I can't find a copy of the original letter,
&gt; but one of the things [Bill] mentions is that "piracy deprives
&gt; Microsoft of the funds to build a better quality product."

Which is an entirely reasonable point of view.  The Stallman's and 2600's of
the world would hold that it's harmless to give away software that you
bought, but they are wrong.  Firstly, the author of software is quite
reasonably entitled to say who may use that creation and in what manner, and
it has long been the norm that software is not sold, but is licensed for use
by a specific party.  This use of licence is an essential feature, that was
probably first introduced in the 1950's when business started manufacturing
software for their income.  At that time it was not clear that there could
be copyright in software, and so it was necessary to prohibit transfer of
title, which is what happens when you sell something.  If title was
transferred then the new owner would be allowed to sell reproductions.  We
do now have copyright in software so this legal nicety is no longer needed,
but it is still the norm.

Let's just think about that again: "The Stallman's and 2600's of the world
would hold that it's harmless to give away software that you bought."  You
have not bought software.  You have paid a fee that licences you to use it.
The purpose of that licence is to make it completely clear that you do not
have the right to give the software to anybody else.  Some software
manufacturers, in a spirit of generosity, do permit you to transfer the
licence and the software to third parties, but that is NOT an inalienable
right.

Secondly, the cost of producing software is enormous.  Very few customers
are willing to pay for the complete development cost, so software
manufacturers need to make a volume of sales to recover their costs.  It is
obviously true that giving away copies of software that you have "bought"
reduces the ability of authors to make the volume of sales that they need
for their livelihood.  Far from being harmless, this sort of illegal and
immoral action deprives the world of further benefits from programmers as it
drives those same programmers out of business.

Software theft hurts you and me both.

Seriously: Does anybody on this list deny that Windows 2000 is a better
product than DOS 1.0?  Comparing apples and oranges?  I think not.  I think
without income from DOS 1.0 there never would have been a Windows 2000.
(Note that I asked "better", not "good".)
