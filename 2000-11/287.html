Hi,

&gt; I have a similar set up at home for proxy/mail, although I'd wager it isn't
&gt; putting through the same number of users as you.

Currently 1, ultimatly about 20.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem is that using this proxy server, data pulled is about 5 times
&gt; &gt; slower to download as using the Uni's proxy server direct. This is being
&gt; &gt; implemented as a cost saving exersise, but performance is an issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Check that squid isn't paging - once it does, performance drops like a
&gt; rock.  This is applicable to top end systems as well as bottem end ones
&gt; (I have a pair of squid servers with currently 640M of memory to stop
&gt; them from paging).

Yes Memory may be the problem, its got 64MB, I thought that'd be enough,
but it may not be.

lets see...

running top whilst downloading.
64MB of RAM, 2.2MB free. Squid taking about 4.5MB
2.5MB of swap in use.

Not heavily overloaded.

Ultimatly I'm wanting to give this direct access to the 'net, but not if
its performance isn't up to scratch.

Ok, interesting, the HTTP performance is bad, but I've just compared
ftp-ing 2 16MB files from the same site, one via Adelaide Uni's proxy, the
other via my proxy. The speed was the same.

So the question now is, why is HTTP downloads of pages so much slower ?

cya
