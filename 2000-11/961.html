Hi,

Since no one else has answered, I'll draw on my limited experience, and be
corrected when necessary.

&gt; I am having a couple of small problems with a linux box and the NIS
&gt; server.
&gt; Nothing major, but I'd like to see if I can resolve them.
&gt; 
&gt; Details:
&gt; Linux Box running Redhat 6.2
&gt; NIS Server Irix 6.5.9 Indy Box
&gt; DHCP Served IP Address
&gt; 
&gt; Problem:
&gt; THe linux box is served an IP address. The linuxbox has no hostname.

I think this might be the source of the problem. I think Linux likes to
have a host name assigned to it, even if all other Internet info is
served by DHCP, because that is only server at init level2 when Networking
starts, and some services like to know the host name prior to that.

Alot of startup scripts initialise using the "uname" or "hostname" command
to gain the hosts name. In RH Linux this is one of the first steps. The
HOSTNAME file contins the hostname, and this is set in /etc/sysconfig
and /etc/rc.d/sysinit scripts, called befor /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/...

Try using the linuxconf utility to set the hostname field, and see if that
fixes the problem.


Corections anyone ???


cya

&gt; The box has bound to the server (users can log in with their name
&gt; and passwd). When a shell is launched, a message comes up saying
&gt; " No Address Associated with Name". What is causing this? I figure it
&gt; has
&gt; something to do with NIS, and the lack of hostname. Perhaps the nis 
&gt; server is looking for the client host name in the DNS and can not find
&gt; it?
&gt;  I can't give the machine a hostname and have it added to the
&gt; DNS as it is a demo machine and will probably be removed from our n/w.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem:
&gt; NIS doesn't seem to bind at boot. I have to run bind manually.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem (not nis related):
&gt; I can't seem to telnet to the box (using ip numbers). If logged into
&gt; the box, cannot telnet into localhost. error is "connection refused".
&gt; Nothing is in /etc/hosts.deny. What could be causing this ?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help appreciated.
