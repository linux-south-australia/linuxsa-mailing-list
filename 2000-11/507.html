Try AMaViS. If you look at the content headers of my Email message, you'll
probably find an "X-AntiVirus: scanned for viruses by AMaViS 0.2.1
(<A HREF="http://amavis.org/">http://amavis.org/</A>)" tag. ;]

Works almost specifically for sendmail, but it's way cool for postfix, qmail
and others. And it's free. All you need in addition is a scanner itself, and
it tells you where to go to get them.

* Subject: sendmail antivirus scanners
*
*
* Hi,
*
* A while ago, my dad got a bounced email because the mail he sent
* contained a
* virus. THe messge he got was an automatic response from the mailserver,
* saying a virous was found (and it included the name of the
* virus), and that
* the mail was undelivered.
*
* I was wondering if there's anything like that for use with
* sendmail, and if
* I can incorporate it with minimal effort. i'm using an old sendmail,
* possibly one that came with redhat 6.1, or a updated package from redhat.
*
* I'm planning to upgrade to a new version of sendmail sometime, but I'm in
* the middle of exam period right now.
*
* I'm looking through freshmeat and there's a couple that sound like they do
* what I'd like, but I'd need to rebuild (is this the correct term) the
* sendmail config, and I have no idea how to do it (this is the reason I
* havn't upgraded sendmail yet). Everything works now, somehow.
*
* I hope I don't get flamed for not learning how to make a proper sendmail
* config yet ;)
*
* thanks,
* Andy
