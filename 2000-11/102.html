&gt; &gt; Operating Systems that accept and support inferior hardware simply
&gt; &gt; because it exists does not make any sense at all to me.

&gt; I infer you mean that WinModems are inferior hardware.  Inferior to what?

To current, state of the art standards.

&gt; Inferior to one of those x2 modems that are NOT v.90 compatible, and which
&gt; are not upgradeable?

Do they still exist?

&gt; I'd say that if you can spare the CPU, which on modern
&gt; systems is quite likely, the flexibility of a "software" solution makes it
&gt; superior to a "pure hardware" modem.

That can be a valid point of view. Nonetheless, some people can't or
don't want to use their CPU for something a dedicated modem chipset can
do. I certainly don't, but I like to optimise my system for speed.

&gt; &gt; Incidentally, before anyone starts to accuse me of being "left wing",
&gt; &gt; "keynsian" or "anti-conservative"
&gt; 
&gt; Why would we accuse you of that, when you self-admit to two out of three of
&gt; them.  (Are you now also keynsian?)

To a certain extent I do believe in keynsian economics. Essentially he
believed that governments could balance the natural ups and downs of the
free market using such measures as the public service, public works or
lack thereof. Whilst a supporter of the free market system, unlike those
who have claimed Adam Smith's [1] beliefs there is a place for
government sponsored enterprise in the economy.

So, yes I am all three.

[1]
If you read Adam Smith in  c o n t e x t  you'll find that he counsels
against the immorality and abuse of the free market system. One gets the
surreal feeling that he is a messenger telling a story rather than a
preacher trying to convert. Unfortunately, many of the conservative,
economic rationalists have managed to pervert what he wrote and believed
into something that would, in my opinion, be quite contrary to what
Smith originally thought.

as a component of our plan to make our founder enough bread to exceed
the net worth of the world's richest man.
