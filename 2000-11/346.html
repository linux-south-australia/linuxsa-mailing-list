It was just as bad before EDS took over.

MWP

&gt; tafe.sa.edu.au is called "barnnie" and is the main gate for ALL of TAFE
SA.  It
&gt; is not unusual for activities being carried out particularly on evenings.
It
&gt; was recently upgraded due to extreme overload, but from what I hear the
upgrade
&gt; did little to improve things.  I use the educational side of things every
day
&gt; and to be honest if they were a private ISP they would be out of business
by now
&gt; (EDS control all the servers for TAFE SA) I believe there is not a great
deal we
&gt; can do about it because we no longer control what happens with the
equipment we
&gt; use.
&gt; If you think Regency is bad go to Port Adelaide and see what its really
like.
&gt;
&gt; Also we use  WebCT online training programs  and its a big drain on
resources.
&gt; So if you are unlucky to use the connection during a heavy WebCT night its
just
&gt; you luck :-)

&gt; &gt; If I pull files from AARNET through Regency TAFE's stupid Novell
&gt; &gt; Bordermanager, when the stupid thing works I usually get betweeen 100 -
&gt; &gt; 300Kb/s Regency's connection goes to DETE in the city then to Internode.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Their stupid proxy server here at Regency is always coming up with
stupid
&gt; &gt; error messages. Tonight for 4-5 hours it said "Access Forbidden" no
reason
&gt; &gt; it just does sometimes. (maybe they were doing something, but I don't
think
&gt; &gt; so.) Other times for about 5 minutes it decides to say "Lost connection
to
&gt; &gt; neighbour proxy server" This one is really annoying coz it happens
whenever
&gt; &gt; it feels like it. Its not like an automated routine or something it just
&gt; &gt; happens at unpredictable times. The neighbour proxy is
&gt; &gt; adl0076.tafe.sa.edu.au this I think is running something different.
Possibly
&gt; &gt; Squid, I think this is a Unix system because it is runnign Sendmail
8.8.6
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could always try speed testing web pages from the web server
running
&gt; &gt; &gt;on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same system as the proxy, via the proxy. At least then you might
be
&gt; &gt; &gt;able
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to eliminate the network interface from the problem.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Well I'm pulling from mirror.aarnet for my tests, and the link into the
&gt; &gt; &gt;Uni is fairly fast, so I'm getting about 250KBs average.
