The upgrade process from even 7.1 is iffy at best.  Mostly because of
7.2 having a slighty different Directory structure/heirachy.  A quote
from Mandrakeforum.com :

&gt; Adrian Saidac wrote "It looks like the 7.2 is build from groud up.
&gt; Many things are missing; many are completely new. I would like your
&gt; comments. Thanks, Adrian S.". 
&gt;
&gt; Here is part of the answer. Note also that we are basically filling
&gt; two CDs with downloadable 7.2. Not built from the ground up, and no
&gt; real deletions, but a lot of changes, including moving directories
&gt; per the requirements of the LSB.

Mandrakeforum.com is a great place to have a poke aroung for
installation isuues and upcomming features (it's kinda like
Slashdot.org for Mandrake users).  Also MUO (MandrakeUser.org) is
another good spot.  Anyway, I had some trouble upgrading 
from 7.1 to 7.2 so I would say back up your data before trying
anything (good idea anyway).  

Also, if you do try to upgrade I think it's advised to use
"liveupdate"  it's an executable file on the root of the install CD. 
You have to run it from X windows (and I would suggest running it
from something a little resource friendly) but it's meant to do an
upgrade better than booting from CD.

Good Luck.
Damien

&gt; hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Just a quick question.  I've never upgraded a linux box before. 
&gt; I'm running
&gt; Mandrake 6.0 and want to upgrade to 7.2.  I've checked the ftp
&gt; server and
&gt; found upgrades for all versions between 6.0 and 7.2 (including 7.2)
&gt; and was
&gt; wondering if I can just d/l the 7.2 upgrade rpm's and upgrade that
&gt; way or do
&gt; I need to d/l and upgrade using the others as well?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
