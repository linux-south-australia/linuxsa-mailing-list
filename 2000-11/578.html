This was forwarded to me from someone who works for a small Adelaide
company who does as much free software work as they can while also
being a Microsoft Certified Solution Provider (ie has at least two
Microsoft-certified staff.)

The question the sender has is, how should a small company reply, if at
all?

In any case for the rest of us it is a very interesting thing to see even
at the low level of a programme manager in Australia that Linux has some
presence in Microsoft. I wonder if the Microsoft employee thinks Linux is
a company?

Subject: Vendor Affiliation - Can you help me?
 
As part of our monitoring of the state of the market we would like to
find out how many of our MCSPs have any affiliation with Linux.  I would
really appreciate you help.  Would you reply to me at
<A HREF="mailto:sarahth@microsoft.com">sarahth@microsoft.com</A> to let me know if your organisation:

 1. has any affiliation with RedHat ie certified channel partner program
    /member of the RedHat network/ professional services partner program?
 2. how many of your staff are RedHat Certified Engineers?
 3. what role does your organisation play?  (ASP/ISV/System
    Integration/Reseller/Other)
 4. has any affiliation with TurboLinux or Caldera or Debian
 5. what % of your organisations revenue do you expect to come from the
    provision of Linux solutions during FY01?

Thanks in advance for helping me out.

Regards,

Sarah Theiss
