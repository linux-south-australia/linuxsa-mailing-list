&gt; Does anyone know of a Linux (or Winbloat) app that can edit PDF files

&gt; people that want it submitted was a PDF file.

Sorry, I don't. However, PANDA (<A HREF="http://www.stillhq.com/panda/index.htm">http://www.stillhq.com/panda/index.htm</A>)
was talked about on the weekend at the OSS2.
 
&gt; If no such tool exists, what would be the course of action that people
&gt; on the list would suggest?  I considered turning it into PS then
&gt; possibly a bitmap of some description, then adding text using GIMP.
&gt; After this, turn it back into PS then PDF and submit.  Any comments?

It depends on what you need to edit. If it's just adding some text to
various boxes, you may be able to do it with [your editor in here], by
editing the PDF or a PS version of the PDF, depending on how much you
know about the format of those files. It's been some time since I had to
poke around inside PS and PDF. (I don't feel a need to do it again in a
hurry either :-)

Cheers,
