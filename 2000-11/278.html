&gt; I've just setup Squid as a proxy server on an old Pentium 75 we have (old
&gt; enough to have the pentium bug according to the kernel). It has 64MB of
&gt; RAM and SCSI internals. I've setup RH6.2 on it, and its running a web
&gt; server and database fine.

I have a similar set up at home for proxy/mail, although I'd wager it isn't
putting through the same number of users as you.

&gt; The problem is that using this proxy server, data pulled is about 5 times
&gt; slower to download as using the Uni's proxy server direct. This is being
&gt; implemented as a cost saving exersise, but performance is an issue.

Check that squid isn't paging - once it does, performance drops like a
rock.  This is applicable to top end systems as well as bottem end ones
(I have a pair of squid servers with currently 640M of memory to stop
them from paging).
