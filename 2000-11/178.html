&gt;The real problem is that I want users to be able to
&gt;use "scp" to do file transfers, but not to be able to
&gt;wander around and look at everything and do nasty things
&gt;like getting "r00t shellz".
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, scp uses ssh to execute an "scp" process on
&gt;the server machine, or so it seems.
&gt;So you can't turn off ssh if you want scp to be permitted.
&gt;This is real problem, in my opinion, which reduces the
&gt;security of ssh.

ssh and scp do the same thing, just at different levels of interactivity,
there's nothing to stop someone from using scp to form a jerky method of
communicating by sending small files instead of tcp packets. Here's one way
around it that's sure to have a dozen security holes:

Perhaps you could have the home directories for these users on a partition
mounted noexec, then have the only executable binaries available to them
actually be setuid scripts (with an only slightly more privilidged UID)
wrapping the programs you want. This is totally unproven, I made it up just
now :)

ie:
---
#!/bin/sh

if [`echo "$1" | grep -c [^a-zA-Z0-9\:\.\/]` -gt 0]; then
    exit
fi

if [`echo "$2" | grep -c [^a-zA-Z0-9\:\.\/]` -gt 0]; then
    exit
fi

/path/to/scp $1 $2
---

You would then do something like "chmod +s nobody scp_wrapper.sh" so your
users still don't have access to sh, grep, or scp/ssh, but "nobody" does.
The litte bit of basic regex stuff there will prevent anything
non-alphanumeric from finding it's way to scp, except for . and : which are
required to make scp do something.

Maybe leave "." out as well if you only want users to scp to systems that
are in the hosts file (or those that can be reached as 8-octet hexadecimal
IP's..)

Tightening up shell access is hard if you want to let users having anything
more than numeric menu options. Avoid offering shell access if possible :)
