&gt; &gt; &gt; Works almost specifically for sendmail, but it's way cool for postfix, qmail

&gt; &gt; &gt; it tells you where to go to get them.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; so amavis is basically a mail filter that will combine your mail program with a existing virus scanner? ie -- you need to purchase a program from McAffee or someone (ie non free, non open), and use that? Are there any sensible ways of doing this entirely in Open source?
&gt; 
&gt; AVP for Linux, although not open source, is currently free. Everyone
&gt; should be aware that AmaViS chews up _huge_ amounts of resources...

Is this with AVP running as a resident process where the virus databases 
are loaded into memory once, or when AVP is loaded per use?

I have noticed that AVP have added some nice features in the current
release at www.avp.com.au, including some mail integration. I have not
looked at this yet. It may be better integrated than Amavis/AVP.
I found that Amavis requires a wrapper for reporting for some clients.
