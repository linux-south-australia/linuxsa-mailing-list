&gt; I have a maxtor 1 gig H/D with a old win3.1/dos 6.2 install, and am
&gt; hoping to use it as a dedicated LINUX drive.

Good call.

&gt; My problem is I not sure how to format the drive so I can then partion
&gt; it (using FDISK) and still be able to add cdrom drivers etc.

You shouldn't have to do things like this manually.  Redhat include an
option in the install to help newbies out.  I can't remember what it is
'cos I always click custom install, but it partitions, formats and
installs packages to turn your system into a generic Linux box.  I
assume that other distros are starting to ship with similar options.

&gt; 
&gt; Do I still need dos on the drive so it will boot up after I have
&gt; formated ?
&gt; Is the format c: or format c: /s commands valid ?
&gt; If i did a low level format so drive was completely clean, what files
&gt; do i need on a floppy to reboot and begin Fdisk (besides Fdisk )

You don't need to do a DOS-based format/fdisk.  The MS fdisk program
doesn't even understand non-dos partitions (read: Linux) and barfs at
the first one it finds... It won't show the rest, and you can't create
or delete them.  Advice: Stay away from DOS fdisk.  All the distros
these days include the Linux FDISK (and usually some graphical tool as
well), and will format all linux partitions when you create them.

Read below: you may need a bootable floppy disk depending on your CDROM
and BIOS... can you boot the system using the CD drive?

 
&gt; I have a full install of DEFINITE LINUX 7.0 on a cd from a LINUX
&gt; format magazine..

Hmm Definite Linux? Not heard of that one? Another Redhat clone (from
the version number) or is it a new distro?

My advice to you is start simple.  I'd create two partitions on the disk
when asked.  One will be "Linux" or "EXT2" type and will be about 950M
(1000M - 50M).  This is where everything will be installed. One will be
"Linux Swap" and is used as a swap disk.  Make it about 50M, you
shouldn't need much more than this as a newbie, although you'll find
that you increase the swap size as you become more confident with Linux
and start to run a lot of apps at once.

I suggest this scheme because as a new user you'll find that as you gain
knowledge you'll start working out what is the working set of tools that
you use and how much extra software you'll install as you find it on the
net.  On a 1G drive it is hard to set up a system that is good now and
will allow your requirements to grow later without severely limiting
yourself in one place or another.  You'll probably find yourself
repartitioning and reinstalling (and probably trying a couple of
distros) as your confidence increases.

You didn't mention what sort of system you have (CPU, memory, CDROM
type, etc).  It is a little hard to judge what is good with so little
info.  You may find that you need a bootable DOS disk with CD drivers
for your CDROM on it (if it's not an IDE-based one), or you may need to
create a Linux boot disk off the CD if your system doesn't support
booting the CD.

Best of luck in your Linux venture.  The install isn't overly hard once
you get the install program up.

Cheers,
Adam
