Hi Alan,

&gt; I'm not so sure about the illegality that some people
&gt; are proposing for this.

I am, so is the Government - go READ the legislation, don't
be "so sure" about anything, it's dangerous :)

&gt; I think the rules have relaxed a bit.

Yes, but not in the way you appear to think :)

&gt; For instance, someone told me that a few years ago, universities
&gt; in Melbourne were renting properties spaced by a bit less than
&gt; 500 metres because there was some law saying that private people
&gt; could lay their own fiber up to 500 metres without going through
&gt; Telstra.

Indeed, and now you can run private line links for any distance you
like, as long as you don't engage in supply to the public - see my
previous post regarding the legislation for reference information.

The universities can now all own and operate their links, but with
very strict limitations, (for example a remote campus linked back 
to the main city campus cannot allow an unrelated third party to
use their lecture hall for a seminar that requires the use of an
OHP with internet access - why? because that's supply to the public.

&gt; There's also such a thing as a 150 MHz band which you can
&gt; do what you like with as long as the range is less than
&gt; a kilometre or something like that.
&gt; The amateur radio people would know all about this.
&gt; (There's also a free band around about 2.5 GHZ maybe.
&gt; or you can use a wireless lan up to a few tens of metres.)

There is plenty of equipment that falls under the class licence
legislation, none of it allows you to break section 42 of the act.

Section 42 is NOT about spectrum licence or use of frequencies,
it is about doing what only a carrier is allowed to do.

&gt; The best people to contact are the hams.

Who are covered by a class licence which groups them into the
same circle of influence, because they are all individually
granted a licence to transmit..

Stop confusing the various bits of information you have "heard"
or "seen" on mailing lists with what the LAW says - READ IT!

It took me less than 10 minutes to find and read the relevant
information I quoted in my previous message.

&gt; "Steve Fraser" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sfraser@sierra.apana.org.au">sfraser@sierra.apana.org.au</A>&gt;
&gt; used to know all about this sort of thing.

He probably still does know :-) (Hi Steve!)

Cheers

Leigh
