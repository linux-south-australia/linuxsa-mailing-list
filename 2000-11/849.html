&gt; &gt; Without naming names, there *are* alternatives to Telstra for ADSL.

&gt; Internode are one. Senet are reportedly getting close, but can anyone from
&gt; Senet confirm or deny this report/rumour?
&gt; 
&gt; Any other companies?

Optus have a limited rolllout: Waymouth, Prospect and
Flinders exchanges so far.  Their plan is to cover the
small business market before residential.

They support Linux, after pressure from one of their
largest customers :-)  Installation experiences have been
positive.

They also offer the ability to terminate the "ISP" end
of the PPP link at a business, rather on an Internet
router.  This allows ADSL to be used to connect a branch
office back to a main office (possibly in another state),
something that is mainly done with 128Kbps ISDN at the
moment.

[Disclaimer: AARNet developed the service in the paragraph
 above for Optus, to meet our requirements for attaching
 off-campus offices.]


Personally, its pretty plain that ADSL is a stopgap
technology.  It's never going to be able to cover
the majority of the population at a reasonable data
rate.  What is really needed is a re-build of the
customer access network with fiber, something that
TransACT is doing in Canberra.

Although this costs a lot in ISP terms, in council terms
it is less than the cost of upgrading a infrequently-used
sporting stadium.  It's time we started letting the state
government know this.
