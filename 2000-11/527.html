Dale et al:

If said project were to appear we could write, or improve a preexisting
"Virus Spec XML - DTD", and we could host on as many mirrors as possible
Virus Specs in pure XML. I see this as very useful in that:

* viruses appear to be better combatted if their format is known
* XML + XSL (and its ilk) could provide "self-documenting" for various
viruses without having to document the viruses separately (eg a
&lt;virusdescription&gt; tag)
* users can very quickly update their virus database even if some other
virus has managed to hack them off the internet
 - they could ring a friend up and say "can you give me the XML for
virus XYZ" and the friend wouldn't have to parrot off a heap of binary
rubbish to them over the phone

As you might have noticed, I think XML has a lot of uses for a lot of
things, although I don't think SGML/DSSSL are about to die either. Most
XML/XSL tutorials/books seem to say that DSSSL is a much more powerful
but much more difficult transformation stylesheet language to use. I've
been looking at an online DSSSL tutorial and it doesn't seem that hard,
but maybe that's because I'm a linguist and I like the way Lisp/Scheme
express themselves...so elegant whereas XSL is just as powerful but, in
my opinion, lacks elegance.

Anyway, back on topic.

I see no particular reason why a virus scanner couldn't be open
source...who out there is willing to work with us [hopefully this isn't
a royal we :-) ] to start some type of project up...
