The following article might interest a few of the more technically-
minded people on this mailing list.  One of the five global command
stations for the P3-D satelite is in South Australia.

AARNet has a long association with amateur radio and AMSAT, so I
could arrange someone suitable to give a presentation if that
interested people.

SATELLITE LAUNCH A GIANT STEP FOR AMATEUR RADIO
Peter Ellis

    Peter Ellis tells the story of a space curiosity that
    will be orbiting over Canberra next week.


WHAT AM I? I have brains, eyes, ears, mouth and arms; I am full of
ammonia but do not smell; I am a great listener but can also talk like
a parrot; I have wings that fly on the sun's wind; I have wheels that
take me nowhere; I speak many languages but understand none.

I fly free but I am kept captured by a great force; I am a curiosity
that few people know about and very few will ever see. I am small and
simple, yet I am the biggest and most complex. I have a name that is
out of this world Phase 3D.

I am a communications satellite, but I was built by amateurs amateur
radio operators. And I will finally be launched in the next week.

When Phase 3D hitches a ride into space on Wednesday at 12.07pm
Canberra time on one of the very early commercial launches for the new
Ariane 5 rocket, it will be setting new standards for the conquest of
space by ordinary folk.

P3D is the largest and most complex Orbital Satellite Carrying Amateur
Radio of about 40 successfully developed, built, launched, controlled
and used by amateur radio satellite operators (AMSAT) around the world
over the last 40 years.

Add the 18 Russian amateur radio satellites and the total is almost
60, with more being built each year often as part of university
research programs. Commercial satellite builders think the amateur
radio satellites are toys.

P3D is the largest and most expensive amateur satellite and cost about
$US5 million (over $A9 million), raised from subscriptions and
donations from amateurs world-wide. The builders donated their time
and talents. A commercial version would have cost well over $US200
million (about $A400 million).

The opportunity to piggyback on government and commercial launches
happens because satellites come in various sizes. The difference
between a rocket's potential and actual "pay"-loads is dead-weight
ballast, or is offered for free rides by amateur radio satellites and
others designed and built by universities and institutions. AMSAT
helped design and build a launcher adaptor ring for P3D. The launcher
operator will be able to use the design for other secondary payloads.

Amateur radio satellites have regularly risked the trial launches of
new rockets, before paying customers will take the chance. For
example, Fuji-OSCAR 12 was launched in 1986 by the first test flight
of the Japanese H-1 launcher. Phase 3C/OSCAR 13 was launched in 1988
by the first test flight of the Ariane 4 launcher from Kourou, French
Guiana.

P3D weighs 646kg and will launch on the sixth flight of the Ariane 5
rocket. The 4.75-tonne PANAMSAT PAS-1R communications satellite is the
paying customer, and the 100kg STRV-1C and 1D satellites are also
taking a ride.

Ariane 5 is the flagship for Arianespace, owned by a consortium of
European space organisations. Its launch site is at Kourou in French
Guiana on the north-east coast of South America, down the coast from
the Caribbean islands. At only four degrees from the equator, this
site is ideal for a European commercial launch company to send rockets
over the expanse of the Atlantic where strap-on booster rockets can
fall, be recovered and reused.

As currently built, Arianespace's Ariane 5 rocket can lift about 6.5
tonnes to Geostationary Transfer Orbit, with growth planned to almost
double that within several years. GTO is the orbit where
communications satellites can be manoeuvred into their stationary
orbits over the equator and, coincidentally, P3D's final orbit will
approximate this.

Australia's amateur radio operators will be tracking P3D during the
first critical days and weeks, gathering data it transmits to prove it
is operating normally. Several Canberrans are ready to feed data back
to the command stations.

P3D's German design was built by amateurs for amateurs. It has become
reality because people cooperated from countries such as Germany,
Hungary, United States, Slovenia, Japan, Great Britain, South Africa,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Canada, Finland and France.

Three main computers keep P3D's systems alive. They interpret the
digital data flowing between its systems and through receivers to its
transmitters.

Its Japanese-built cameras will be able to send simple images of Earth
and space, and help the ground stations to point it at Earth.  The sun
and Earth-edge visual sensors tell P3-D which direction to point.

Receivers cover across some 130 octaves from short wave to microwave,
and an experiment will investigate the other short-wave frequencies in
the Earth's far atmosphere. Its transmitters cover up to the high
microwave.

It has two arms or wings carrying its solar cells, charging its
batteries to carry it through Earth's shadow. The total power budget
at launch is about 500 watts; much less than a normal house's lights
at night.

P3D's directional stability and rocket system was designed and built
in Germany. It carries a small ammonia-powered experimental "arcjet"
engine that will boost it into a highly elliptical orbit over many
months. It also carries a large rocket engine burning hydrazine and
nitrogen tetroxide that will be used to finally kick it into its
looping orbit.

P3D's magnetic-reaction coils will push against the Earth's magnetic
lines of force, and three-axis momentum wheels will also help
stabilise it so the antennas are pointed at Earth.

It has two GPS receivers which will calculate details about its orbit.
It will research the solar cosmic radiation with instruments built in
England.

So few people know of P3D that it is a curiosity even among amateur
radio operators. Not many more than those who assembled it at Orlando,
Florida, will have even seen it before launch.

Yet, as it flies high and slowly over the northern hemisphere, and
more through the southern skies, it will be transmitting data on its
infrared laser and so be visible through a "nightscope".

Amateur radio satellites have always been at the forefront of
adventure and experiment in space.

The first Orbital Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio, the first of the
Phase 1 satellites, was launched on December 12, 1961, by a Thor Agena
B rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

The 4.5kg OSCAR 1 was launched piggyback with Discovery 36, described
recently as a United States Air Force spy satellite. OSCAR 1 was
box-shaped with a single antenna and went into a low orbit.  Its
low-power transmitter discharged its batteries after three weeks.

Five hundred and seventy amateurs in 28 countries reported receiving
its simple "HI-HI" morse code signals until January 1, 1962.  The
speed of the HI-HI message was controlled by a temperature sensor
inside the spacecraft. OSCAR 1 re-entered the atmosphere on January
31, 1962, after 312 revolutions.

In 1965 OSCAR 3 featured solar cells for the first time.

University of Melbourne students heard their Australis-OSCAR 5 in
January 1970, the first remotely controlled amateur satellite. It was
battery-powered and over seven weeks it provided contacts between
hundreds of stations in 27 countries.

AMSAT OSCAR 6 in 1972 was the first Phase 2 satellite, featuring a
control system using discrete logic and satellite-to-satellite relay
communication via AO-7. It demonstrated doppler-location of ground
stations for search and rescue (which is now common) and low-cost
medical-data relay from remote locations.

OSCAR 7 in 1974 was built by a multi-national team from Germany,
Canada, United States and Australia and featured a store-and-forward
message relay system.

The first Russian Radio Sputnik satellites were launched on October
26, 1978. They have been followed by six launched together on a common
launch vehicle on December 17, 1981.

Two Russian satellites were launched from the Salyut 7 space station
in 1982. RS-17, a scale model built by high-school students to
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the launching of Sputnik 1, was
launched by hand on November 4, 1997 from the Mir space station by
Russian cosmonauts.

Then, most recently, Sputnik 41/RS18 was launched by hand one year
later.

AMSAT Phase 3A was launched on May 23, 1980. The launch failed and the
P3A did not reach orbit. The new series of OSCARS featured rocket
motors as well as external control.

UO-9, launched October 6, 1981, was the first experimental satellite
from the University of Surrey in Britain. It was a scientific and
educational low-orbit satellite containing many experiments and
beacons, and featured an on-board computer. It was still in operation
nine years later when it re-entered the atmosphere. Phase 3B/OSCAR 10,
launched on June 16, 1983, is still operating.

By the late 1980s many other groups were trying for space. In one
launch on January 22, 1990, the Brazilian O-17, the US Webber
University's O-18, and Argentina's O-19 were launched. Another
Japanese satellite was launched 16 days later.

In the next three years, groups in England, the US, France, Korea,
Italy and Portugal had satellites. This was also the beginning of the
fully digital satellites allowing computer networking around the
world.  In 1995, Mexico and Israel joined the club, Thailand in 1998,
and South Africa and Malaysia this year.

Space has manned amateur radio stations, too.

The first such mission was on the space shuttle in the early 1980s,
and they are repeated regularly when payload and power allow.

The Russian Mir space station had several sets of equipment sent to
it, including a camera transmitter and a repeater. The idea is that
astronauts and cosmonauts speak over amateur radio in their planned
spare time to school amateur radio stations and ordinary amateurs.

Like Mir, the International Space Station - newly named "Alpha" -
already carries amateur radio equipment. Two members of its first
three-man crew, two cosmonauts and an astronaut, launched last week,
have amateur radio licences and will soon be setting up the equipment
to talk to stations on Earth.

Amateur radio operators are dedicated to self-education in their
technical hobby. They build their station equipment and antennas to
talk to friends across the world, or with some satellites use the
electronic mailboxes to send messages on a type of radio Internet.

AMSAT satellites are used for educational purposes in schools and
youth science competitions to introduce young people to space
technology and exploration, with amateur radio operators supervising
students' use of radios to communicate via the satellites.

Amateurs have modified their high-gain receivers to listen directly to
manned landings on the moon and more recently hear the Mars
orbiters. It is the adventure that drives them to spend time building
radios or modifying cast-off commercial equipment to show what is
possible with some knowledge and ingenuity.

P3D has been 12 years in planning and six years in construction.

Spare a thought for the AMSAT Germany project leader, Professor Dr
Karl Meinzer, and the mission director, launch campaign, Peter
Guelzow, and their team, who have watched their child grow from
conception to maturity.

Who else but the adventurous amateur radio community would pay for
their mates to build their bright ideas, then strap it to a pile of
explosive propellant and light the fuse?

This week, applaud the spirit of volunteerism that has seen people
around the world give freely of their intellect and talents for a
satellite that has the potential to be so much space-junk or, through
the experiments by amateur radio operators, change how mankind
communicates in space.

Amateur radio in the ACT is heavily involved in community activities,
as safety radio operators at several car rallies, the Two Day Walk,
Coach Riding Championships at Bungendore, etc.
