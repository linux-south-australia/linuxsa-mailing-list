&gt; XF86 used to have an inbuilt font server, but one bad thing about this
&gt; was speed. To display a font it hadn;t displayed before, the X server
&gt; had to find information for it (searching a list of directories) then
&gt; render it. This all took time, and it was time that the used was shaking
&gt; the mouse saying "whats wrong? why has my X session frozen".

I must admit I still prefer the built in X server as I find most the fonts
I use are loaded when X starts anyway. X 4 also provides a much nicer
built in font render which doesn't hang X whilst it's rendering the font.
(Although the user is still left thinking why didn't that font change till
it's rendered). However, with modern machines it's pretty quick anyway.
 
&gt; Funky things that you can do is add TrueType (windows) fonts, which I
&gt; have been trying to get going but have had little luck - but that's
&gt; another thread.

Thread change :)

The builtin render also supports truetype fonts natively A simple

        Load  "freetype"

in the Modules section of XF86Config then something like

     FontPath    "/mnt/dos/windows/fonts"

In the Files section of XF86Config then running:

ttmkfdir &gt; fonts.scale
mkfontdir  

in the directory with true type fonts and bingo, you have ttf support. Of
course you'll need to restart X or run something like xset +fp path;xset
fp rehash if you don't feel like restarting.

Now If only I could get netscape not to core dump when viewing various web
pages...but that's another thread :)

Cheers,
