Setup the share on the Samba server, give it guest access, & make it
writeable.
Then in your NT logon script run the net use command to map a drive to your
share.
Or alternatively if you cant get to the NT logon script, run the following
from a command prompt.

net use z: \\&lt;SambaNetbiosName&gt;\&lt;Sharename&gt;

		Subject:	Samba Sharing

		Hi Everyone,

		This should be a quick question.

		I am running an NT Domain here and we develop in ASP (eeek,
I hear you all
		say!) but we are trying to convert to PHP and doing so on a
rapid scale.
		At the moment programmers are used to logging into the NT
Domain and
		having the shares available so they can editthe files on the
share and
		save them and view them. I have recently added a Linux box
to the network,
		on UIP address 192.168.0.122. At the moment people see their
files via
		<A HREF="http://192.168.0.122/~username/test.php">http://192.168.0.122/~username/test.php</A> etc etc. I would
like this to work
		so that they login and they are allocated a share that they
would see (eg
		I login and I am automatically mapped to the linux box on
drive (say z:)
		and I am able to add and edit the files that I veiew on
		<A HREF="http://192.168.0.122/~nigel/">http://192.168.0.122/~nigel/</A> There is no users on the linux
box apart from
		the ones that I create manually. (Eg me, sysadmin, 1 test
user etc etc. )
		Is there an easy way that I can create this system. I have
tried a simple
		system at the moment of having one share
(<A HREF="http://192.168.0.122">http://192.168.0.122</A>) is a share
		(/home/httpd) and everyone has access to this (even though I
have stuffed
		it up and no-one can write to the files but they can read
them. 

		I have read the documentation back to front, but I hate
documentation and
		can't seem to make heads or tails of it. Everything I try
seems to be
		ambiguios and I feel I have done it the right way. 

		What I need is someone or something (a manual) that has what
I am tryu\ing
		to do step by step, including file permissions (as I am
lackign in
		education here), directories, etc etc.

		Please excuse my spelling in this E-Mail as I am using a
very slow telnet
		session and can't be bothered back-spacing which takes about
2 minutes
		each time I press it,.

		Thanking everyone in advance...

		Regards,

		Nige
