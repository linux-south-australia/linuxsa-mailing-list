Hey Tim,

First off, you don't need to masquerade the Linux box (192.168.1.1), so you
can get rid of that. Also, it is normally better to masquerade an entire
network rather than set it up for each machine.

For a basic NAT setup, try the following commands (As you said, this has
absolutely ZERO security...):

/sbin/ipchains -F
/sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -i eth0 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -s 0.0.0.0/0 -j MASQ

First line flushes all the rules out. Second line sets the default policy
for the forward chain to DENY and the third allows the internal hosts in the
network 192.168.1.0 to be masqueraded, as long as the data comes in from
eth0.

Use DENY instead of REJECT, because if someone tries to portscan you or
whatever, REJECT lets them know you are there and what they can and cannot
access, DENY just makes you appear like a black hole, so to speak. By the
way, the last rule in your forward chain is letting everyone in, despite
your default policy, so you might want to take it out :)

The routing tables and ifconfig output looks ok. And you said that samba and
the like is working, so your network is working ok.

Not bashing Windows or anything, but I believe the problem is on your
Windows box :)  Have you set the default gateway on the windows machine to
point to your gateway? I haven't used ME, so I can't tell you exactly where
to find the settings, but under 9x you go to Control Panel, Network, TCP/IP
(for your lan card) and add in the default gateway pointing to 192.168.1.1.

If that is set correctly, have you got DNS working? Are you pinging hosts by
name or by IP?? If you are pinging by name, then try IP only. Try running:

/usr/sbin/traceroute -n 203.15.24.22

and let me know what the output is.

Hope this helps a little.

DR
