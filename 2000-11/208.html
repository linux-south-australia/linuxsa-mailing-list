Hello, Penguinites.

Just a quick rundown of my recent "dialogue" with Canon, with regards to
Linux drivers for my BJC-5000.

Of course, it wasn't until AFTER I became a Linux newbie less than a year
ago that I realised that this printer falls into the category of a
WinPrinter.  &lt;spit&gt;

I commenced the long search on-line for any piece of code that would
breathe life into my printer under RH 6.2 - even Turoprint couldn't get it
running:  www.turboprint.de

It finally dawned on me with some posts on this list some months back that
these "GDI" printers basically didn't have much of a chance of budging
under Linux.  (Though I managed to get the light to flicker once!)
&lt;applause_optional&gt;

"Why don't I ask the nice people at Canon for a driver?", I thought.

My polite letter to Canon Australia in Sydney led to a stony silence for a
number of months.

When I followed it up by phone, the response was equally unproductive:
"..we don't support Linux, check on-line as someone might have written a
driver for it under Linux..."

OK, maybe Canon HQ may be interested to hear of my plight, after all any
decent company would at least provide some sort of response to a letter
from a concerned user of their product(s).

Here's a step-by-step rundown of what I put into my letter:

- Bought BJC-5000, which worked well under WinDoze
- Discovered Linux, but unable to find drivers for Linux on-line
- Informed them that Linux is expanding in user uptake
- Mentioned a possible niche for Canon to be seen to support Linux
- Suggested that products could be bundled with Linux drivers and badged as
"Linux Friendly" (the marketing!)

It would be foolish for me to have expected to have a CD with the right
Linux drivers in the mail the following week, though, I was interested to
read what the view was from the top.

Naturally, I had addressed my letter "Attention" to the President & CEO
(which I found out via Canon's web-site was a Mr. Fujio Mitarai).

And so, yesterday arrived a letter from Canon Inc. - with Mr Mitarai
(surprise, surprise!) passing the letter on to one of his other managers. 

In the three paragraph letter from Hideli Tomita (Manager, BJ Products) was
the follwing reply:

- my letter was acknowledged and there was regret for my "...unpleasant
experience..."
- my region is handled by Canon Australia, who will get in touch with me
- thanking me for bringing it to their attention

Needless to say, I won't be holding my breath for any useful reply from
Canon Australia - which I'm guessing will be along the lines:  "...the
printer was developed by Canon HQ, maybe you should ask them for a driver."

In the meantime, I'll be considering my next printer purchase much more
carefully.

Kind Regards,

Peter
