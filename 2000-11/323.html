As an update to my recent posting (re: dialogue with Canon Inc. for Linux 
drivers for my BJC-5000 WinPrinter &lt;spit&gt;), I have, indeed, received a 
response from Canon Australia.

In summary, Canon Australia advise me:

- they received a copy of my letter to Canon Inc.
- apologise for not responding to my original letter (it apparently wasn't 
received)
- thank me for my patronage, and gave me an InfoLine number and their 
web-site address for more info.

plus, this paragraph:

"Presently Canon do not offer drivers for the Linux operating system but we 
are advised that Canon Inc. (the parent company) are currently reviewing 
this situation and evaluating the possible development of Linux drivers for 
probable release late next year. We are also informed that they will be 
looking at opportunities to advance on this schedule and that, once 
released, we expect these will be made available for downloading from the 
Canon Australia Website."

The InfoLine number provided was: (02) 9805-2864.

If you call Canon's Adelaide office, phone (08) 8201-9100, and ask for 
technical support for your printer, they should be able to put your call 
through to the InfoLine without the need to dial an interstate number. (I 
would guess that anybody could call their respective State Canon office for 
the same diversion).

Since the Linux situation is supposedly under consideration at the moment, 
perhaps some more enquiries by other Linux users to Canon asking for Linux 
drivers can influence the result of their "review".  And, of course, we 
want Linux drivers that are officially endorsed by Canon and/or written by 
the manufacturers, who best understand the way our device operates - after 
all, we don't want to feed our sophisticated equipment just any old code to 
keep it going! :)

Real hope for Linux users ? (or a lame attempt to keep a disgruntled user 
quiet for a while?)

If anyone has an EPSON or HP (or, perhaps any other brand, for that 
matter), they could get onto the phone, too, and ask them for a Linux 
driver.  When advised that Linux isn't supported, they could let them know 
that they've heard that Canon are reviewing their situation on Linux - and 
a quick whisper into their ear that they'd might want to look into Linux 
themselves (after all, they wouldn't want to get left behind, would they?)

Cheers,

Peter
