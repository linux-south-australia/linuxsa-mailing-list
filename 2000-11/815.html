Hi,

&gt; Hi Leigh,
&gt; 
&gt; Been there, done that!
&gt; The only answer that came back from Telstra was:
&gt; 
&gt; "We don't support Linux!"
&gt;
&gt; The cables are all over the place, I've checked the address you sent
&gt; long time ago.
&gt; Now there are some questions: - Is it possible to connect to the ADSL
&gt; services and how? Using an Ethernet card? 
&gt; My interest is as a Linux user. I could use my daughter's computer, but
&gt; that one has windowz on it. No way, if I can't use the ADSL with my
&gt; Linux box, forget it!

Most ADSL services currently offered make use of the PPP over Ethernet
protocol.  An ADSL "modem" is used which generally has an Ethernet port
and a port for your phone line.  Typically only one computer can talk
directly to the ADSL modem at once, but theres nothing stopping you from
running NAT on your linux box etc.  So even though Telstra dont offically
support it, I cant see any reason why it wouldnt work.

I did a search for pppoe on www.freshmeat.net, and found a few matches for
suitable linux client software.  I chose to use pppoe-0.3.  I cant say
I've tried it with a Big Pond ADSL service, but I just helped a fellow
co-worker get her Internode ADSL connection going under linux.  It was
basically as easy as a normal ppp dialup connection once the
phone/ethernet cabling was sorted out.

Now I just have to wait for my local exchange to be ADSL enabled.

Daryl
