Hi Paul,

&gt; My Boss is getting ADSL from Telstra..

boo hiss :) :) :) (just kidding, I've got a Bigpond ADSL at home too).

&gt; and I would like to get it working under Linux, rather then NT.

Sure - easy game :)

&gt; Apparently Telstra supply an ADSL card.. has anyone else done this
&gt; and can tell me the type of card supplied/chipset?  Where there any
&gt; hiccups?  (I'd like to atleast do a little bit of reading..)

My suggestion is don't take the card - while drivers might be
available for it (it is an Alcatel chipset btw) - you are much
better off getting the ADSL modem and simply plugging in the
free ethernet card which Bigpond supply into your BSD^H^H^HLinux
box and running the Linux PPPoE daemon to connect to Bigpond using
PPP over Ethernet.

ie:

 Line                    Ethernet               Ethernet
          +------------+  PPPoE   +-----------+               
----------| ADSL Modem |----------| Linux Box |----------&lt;LAN&gt;
          +------------+          +-----------+               

Note that Bigpond have (at last reading) an acceptable use policy
that prohibits the connection of a network or multiple PC's to the
ADSL service unless you pay for additional users, ie: $11/month
extra _each_, to a maximum of 8 users/PCs.

This includes the use of a single PC (eg: above) with a LAN
behind it, using NAT/proxy services - they count each person
or computer on the LAN behind the PC (eg: above) as a user.

They also don't currently support fixed IP addresses, so each
time your PPPoE client logs in, you will have a new random IP
address assigned to you.  Bigpond suggest this (fixed IP) will
be changed later in the year (if not early next year) - which
is cool.

I won't enter into a discussion about how they can tell if
you are doing this, or how much it matters if they do find
out, or what they can do if they do, but it should be obvious :)

Other ISPs doing ADSL don't necessarilly have these restrictions.

YMMV, this is based on my own personal experience and knowledge
as a Bigpond ADSL user at home.

Cheers

Leigh
