&gt; When does the system not boot.
&gt; 1. When it's been off overnight and you start it first thing?
&gt; 2. While it's been running for a while and you reboot? (how long)
&gt; 
&gt; Have you tried disconnecting all bits like disk etc sound cards and
&gt; rebooting to see if the problem occurs with no pci cards (except your
&gt; video) installed?

&gt; Sometimes fan not working on cpu may lock it up depending on how
&gt; intelligent your motherboard is.

&gt;First of all have you tried putting your clock speed back to normal?

Yes,  She's back to 400Mhz now :)

Evan,

Harddrive - Tried replacing...No success

Fan - Working fine

Ram - Replacing it. No success

CPU - cant replace it. I have a pentium 233 here but I don't think my Epox MB
supports it :(

Sound card - (SB 16 ISA) Haven't tried

Network Card - Tried

Video Card - (AGP Intel I740) Haven't tried

3DFX - (Diamond Monster 8meg) Haven't tried.

Should I even bother trying these?

Also when I get home from work around 5 I start it and it doesn't work then. 
Then when I reboot it usually doesn't work either. ..but it's working now ????? 

Funny though I haven't had that much trouble today (Monday) compared to the 'HOT' w/e we just
had.

Any more suggestions? 

I can't understand why it is working now and not other occasions when I don't
touch a thing and the temp. doesn't change.  Is this just my lack of knowlage of PC componants?

cheers
