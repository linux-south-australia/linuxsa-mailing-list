Since this has already been marked as OT, I'll reply, briefly.

I was under the impression that at the last federal election the
coalition actually lost the 2 party preferred vote, ie more pople put
the ALP as their first major party than the LP or NP. But the coalition
won more marginal seats, so we had a situation much like the US
presidential elections at the moment (although much fairer, since
electorates are more fine grained and preferential voting was used
here). So (assuming my memory is correct) the majority of Australians
did *not* vote Prime Minister Howard in. A majority of people in a
majority of electorates did, however. :)

&gt; Never the less, he is the best Prime Minister that Australia has, and he may
&gt; well be the best Prime Minister in the world.

Since he is the *only* Prime Minister that we have, he must be the best.
Or did you mean the best ever? Or possibly the best choice at the
moment?

Hmm. How many countries actually have Prime Ministers? Mainly current or
former British colonies I guess.

Cheers

Tom
