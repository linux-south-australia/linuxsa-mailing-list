Hola otra vez David.  Es bueno oír de usted otra vez.
Ciao ancora David.  Buono da sentirsi ancora da voi.

(Please be nice, my Italian is not very good.  My Spanish only
slightly better, but I'm trying to practice whenever I can.)

&gt; &gt; I meant subjective as in everybody has their own definition of
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; "the best" means.
&gt; 
&gt; No. You're confused. Everyone agrees what "the best" means in a
&gt; strict,
&gt; dictionary sense - it is the superlative of good - but what they
&gt; define
&gt; as the best may turn up differently. 


What most people would agree a word means in the dictionary sense and
how they would use it everyday conversation are two different things
(strict definition/effective definition).  This is English, not a
strict continental language (like Spanish or Italian, although they
have their own peculiarlarities [is that a word?  Maybe I should use
quirks?]).  Most people would read the question "Which is best" to
"Which is your favourite".  This is especially true in Australia. 
For example, ask many Australians which is "best", Ford or Holden and
you'll just get their favourite (same with political parties).

If the answerer actually takes the meaning to be the "superlative of
good", this still is a subjective question.  

Ask three people 
"Which is the best operating system?" 

and you could potentially get the three correct answers: 

"OpenBSD is the best, it is the most secure."
"BeOS is the best, it's built from the ground up for multimedia
support, and is POSIX compliant."
"MS Windows is the best, it is compatible with 85% of other PC
desktops (and all my friends)." 
[Note: these are not necessarily my opinions, but merely examples].  

All three answers are correct for the individual answerers, yet all
are different.  ("Yes, we're all different.”; “I’m not.")

Quot homines, tot sententia.

&gt; it differ. I assure you that "the best" has a strict syntactical,
&gt; English definition and most if not every English speaker on this
&gt; list
&gt; understands it. 

I'm sure we all understand the strict definition, but do we all
really use it in everyday conversation?  What's the best soft drink? 
What's the best brand of sneaker?  English is notorious for having
double meanings for what is said.

&gt; It is not a term that transcends the strict
&gt; definitions of modern English - its definition is solid. 

LOL.

&gt; In an Object Oriented paradigm it would be like an
&gt; abstract class...

I'm intrigued.  An explanation please.


&gt; &gt;(which I'm sure we all know is flimsy
&gt; &gt; at best when it comes to upholding strict definitions):
&gt; 
&gt; We all conform to the "Australian Government Printing Services"
&gt; handbook don't we?

Absolutely!  Just like all the drivers on the road follow the traffic
code to the letter!

&gt; &gt; "No Marge, when kids say bad, they mean good.  And to shake your
&gt; &gt; booty, means to wiggle ones behind.  Permit me to demonstrate."
&gt; 
&gt; Well, a demonstration at Tuesday night's meeting could make for
&gt; some
&gt; fun.

Not a Simpsons fan I suppose, a bit contemporary for you? ;&gt;

&gt; &gt; After all, we don't want this to devolve into petty pedantry, now
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; we?:)
&gt; 
&gt; Pedantry is not, by my definition, petty. 
&gt; 

Hmmm, but from the dictionary (Merriam-Websters Collegiate): 

Pedant: 2 b : one who is unimaginative or who unduly emphasizes
minutiae in the presentation or use of knowledge

Pedantic: 2 : narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously learned
              ^^^^^^^^
Petty: 3 : marked by or reflective of narrow interests and
sympathies.
                                      ^^^^^^
That sounds pretty petty to me! 

&gt; &gt; Had the asker specifically wished a single authorative answer,
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; they not have asked a single authorative source.
&gt; 
&gt; Such as Bill Gates?
&gt; 

You think that Bill Gates is an authorative source on Linux
distributions (or anything but bully tactics in corporate business)? 
Do you even USE Linux????  (Joke ;)


&gt; &gt; As such, the
&gt; &gt; existance of multiple answers (albeit from multiple sources)
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; be taken as an absolute certainty.
&gt; 
&gt; No, you've missed my original point. The original person - I
&gt; suspect -
&gt; meant BOTH redhat AND mandrake are in my opinion as good as each
&gt; other
&gt; and they are so good that they, collectively are the best. But the
&gt; person said RedHat OR Mandrake :-)

The person was I, and I meant (and said) *Debian* *or* Mandrake. 
Depending on the sort of person and task it would be put to, one or
the other could come out as superior.  Without qualification there
can be no answer as to the best (strict dictionary definition) Linux
distribution, but only an answer as to the best (for set purpose, ie
with qualification) or the best (my favourite) Distribution.


&gt; &gt; As such the question could not
&gt; &gt; possibly have begged a singular answer.  The term "best"
certainly
&gt; &gt; does imply singular, but the whole question in context, does not.
&gt; 
&gt; The "best" does have an answer. There are no questions we cannot
&gt; not answer.

You lost me there (and I don't mean the can not not).  How does the
"best" have an answer?  And by saying "There are no questions we
cannot not answer" means that we don't have to answer any questions.

I can not answer - no answer

I cannot not answer - I must answer

No question I cannot not answer - there are no questions I must
answer.


&gt; &gt; Es sido conversación agradable con usted por el correo
&gt; electrónico.
&gt; &gt; Miro adelante a hablar otra vez.
&gt; 
&gt; Cosa dica? Non Lei capisco!
Umm.  {What is written? I don't understand!}  (dica - dictated or
says?? capisco - similar to capiscono - understand - It is Italian,
is it not?)

[Translated from the original] "It has been pleasant to converse with
you by electronic mail.  I look forward to speaking again."

Tenga un día agradable.  Aguardo su contestación.
[Or]
Avere un giorno piacevole.  Attendo la vostra risposta.

Damien
