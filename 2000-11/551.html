I nominate David Lloyd (GURU) for Leader/Designer/Coder/Tester of the new
AntiVirus Project.

:)




&gt;
&gt;Dale et al:
&gt;
&gt;If said project were to appear we could write, or improve a preexisting
&gt;"Virus Spec XML - DTD", and we could host on as many mirrors as possible
&gt;Virus Specs in pure XML. I see this as very useful in that:
&gt;
&gt;* viruses appear to be better combatted if their format is known
&gt;* XML + XSL (and its ilk) could provide "self-documenting" for various
&gt;viruses without having to document the viruses separately (eg a
&gt;&lt;virusdescription&gt; tag)
&gt;* users can very quickly update their virus database even if some other
&gt;virus has managed to hack them off the internet
&gt; - they could ring a friend up and say "can you give me the XML for
&gt;virus XYZ" and the friend wouldn't have to parrot off a heap of binary
&gt;rubbish to them over the phone
&gt;
&gt;As you might have noticed, I think XML has a lot of uses for a lot of
&gt;things, although I don't think SGML/DSSSL are about to die either. Most
&gt;XML/XSL tutorials/books seem to say that DSSSL is a much more powerful
&gt;but much more difficult transformation stylesheet language to use. I've
&gt;been looking at an online DSSSL tutorial and it doesn't seem that hard,
&gt;but maybe that's because I'm a linguist and I like the way Lisp/Scheme
&gt;express themselves...so elegant whereas XSL is just as powerful but, in
&gt;my opinion, lacks elegance.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, back on topic.
&gt;
&gt;I see no particular reason why a virus scanner couldn't be open
&gt;source...who out there is willing to work with us [hopefully this isn't
&gt;a royal we :-) ] to start some type of project up...
&gt;
&gt;DL
&gt;-- 
&gt;Do you believe in life after love?
&gt; I can feel something inside me, say
&gt; I really don't think you're strong enough....
