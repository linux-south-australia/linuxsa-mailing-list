Look.

Enough.

I said:

--self quote--
There seems to be a plethora of HTML mail. Could those who use HTML
enabled browsers (eg, Netscape Messenger, Outlook Express and others)
please check to make sure that they use text? There are some people who
have a philosophical grievance with HTML e-mail, and others who just
junk it without reading it.
--end self quote--

Now, if you can somehow convince me that what I wrote in that instance
was rude or flame worthy, or lacks a reason [1] why I said it then
please, continue this thread. At the end of the day I - and a lot of
others - can read HTML mail; I, like others, don't like reading HTML
mail and I politely expressed that opinion.

That is the end of the story, period and full stop.

DL

[1]
Please note that you may not agree with "there are some people who have
a philosophical grievance etc etc", but in my opinion it is a truthful
statement. It's been mentioned on this list before (search our archives)
and it's been mentioned on the redhat list as well (search its archives
at <A HREF="http://www.moongroup.com/">http://www.moongroup.com/</A>)...my point here is that I didn't just bolt
out of the blue and tell someone to do something with no apparent reason
[2].

[2]
I rarely ever do...and then only when I'm in a particularly bad mood.
And I was feeling quite happy when I wrote the original message.

PS:
I'm not certain a "DL" bot would be suitable. If it were trained in
logic and argued logically you might actually find that the "DL" bot is
right most of the time and you can't create side-arguments with it to
attempt to win your debate. For example, you couldn't possibly argue
that the mail I sent was "impolite" or "untrue". In fact, the "DL" bot
might have pointed out that one of the specific recipients - and he
doesn't share my first name - might not have seen the original, polite
posting but instead may have seen a reaction to a not so polite
reply...but who knows? Who am I to tell the bot named after me what to
do?
