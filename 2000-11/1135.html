South Australia has 72633km of cables according to Etsa, 9.1% of which
is underground, which has taken 30 years so far. During 98/99 they spent
something like 3.5 million on such activities. As a result, we have
greater percentage of underground cable than all other states of
Australia. 

I would rather see SA get broadband down every street than tuck away a
few more power cables, and the former is a lot more feasible. It's not
likely that the cables will be hidden in my Street during the next 20
years, and I don't want to wait that long for fibre. Once we all have
fast net connections, we'll all be able to do more work from home and
better appreciate our environment, which will then lead to putting
cables underground.
