If you just want to play DVD's and MPEG/AVI files from your Linux box to a TV 
I would look at the Creative DXR3/Hollywood Plus card. It exists only to play 
MPEG1/2 output to a TV, and is well supported under Linux. It works under 
Mplayer (I use it all the time) and Xine (never tried).

With a fast enough CPU Mplayer will transcode other formats to MPEG-1 in real 
time, so you can watch Divx's etc from your PC.

Some good points:

1 .. All decoding is done in hardware, so CPU usage is minimal and output 
quality excellent.

2 .. It is completely independant from your display output, so no dealing 
with funky modelines etc.

3 .. As above, can play videos at the same time as you are using your Linux 
GUI desktop for other things.

4 .. Made for TV output, so no soldering iron, converter cables etc needed.

5 .. Mplayer can be controlled completely from command line, no GUI needed to 
play videos etc.

To be fair, some bad points.

1 .. Mplayer support is immature, can be some sound syncing issues (I have 
solved mine, but YMMV)

2 .. Divx support can produce output that is *slightly* jerky. Not bad, can 
only be noticed on really slow, smooth pans. Does not stop me watching them.

If you add a TV decoder card and some scripts, time you would have a 
rudimentry DVR device.

As way of pricing/availability here is a link to the device from the EYO web 
site (no affiliation, guide only)

No warranty etc, but I am happy with mine. If you are interested I would buy 
one soon, as this sort of device will probably fade away as CPU's get faster 
and TV-Out on video cards becomes the norm.
