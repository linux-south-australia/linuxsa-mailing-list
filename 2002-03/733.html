So what?

Don't you think that the fact that so many people are completely unaware
that they are being transparent proxyed (until the slashdot article) is
relevant? It's called 'transparent' for good reason. Most people will
never even be aware it's there, and the gains for the ISP, which are
directly manifested as a lower price for the the customer, far outweigh
any other issues.

&gt; If I replace 1.1.1.1 with www.slashdot.org, Microsofts web page is still
&gt; output - clearly this behaviour is different from what one might
&gt; intuitively expect.  It is also different from the results if no
&gt; transparent proxy exists.

An interesting exercise in identifying the existance of a transparent
proxy, but it certainly doesn't show anything else.

&gt; This is a reasonable argument, but again the underlying premise that the
&gt; only available type of proxy caching is transparent proxy caching is
&gt; wrong.  Sorry to be so blunt, but I don't know how else to say this.

If you mean "why isn't the use of a web proxy a user configurable option"
then you've missed the whole point. Transparent proxying has a whole heap
of issues around it that are a lot harder to setup and maintain than just
installing a squid box and mailing the users a setting for their web
browser. ISP's don't go to all that extra trouble for fun.

&gt; configuration and support calls is through transparent proxying.  I
&gt; imagine that this results in an overall inbound traffic cost reduction
&gt; for the ISP in question in any case.

This is likely the overriding component for a lot of ISP's.

&gt; But these issues are not technical issues, they are business issues, and
&gt; although some benefits might accrue to the customers (through cost
&gt; savings passed on) there are really no technical benefits that I can see
&gt; that can not be achieved more flexibly in other ways.

Lovely, please pass them on. All ISP's need a solution that:

o can cache data for cost savings (a 30-40% hit rate would be a good start)
o involves no customer configuration, or special software
o customers always get the benefit of the proxy cache
o doesn't do any 'pesky' TCP tricks to attain the above

&gt; OK, I'll bite.  My usability problem is that each and every site that I
&gt; use nmap against from behind a transparent proxy shows up as having port
&gt; 80 open.  In some cases, I know for a fact that this is not true.  How
&gt; can I fix this?  (Tongue somewhat in cheek here)

Ahhh, the real reason, finally.

As Mark said, if you have problems with a transparent proxy, talk to your
ISP. In your case, if you can justify a legitimate reason for needing the
ability to determine the real status of port 80 on a remote machine, the
ISP may add you to the proxy bypass list.

I am hard pressed to think of a reason for many people to need this
ability however.
