&gt;I also find it difficult to believe that a carrier selling a $1000/month
&gt;spread-spectrum link will simply 'give up' if they encounter
&gt;interference. I used an Agile link once, and would not have been a happy
&gt;customer if that were the case.

Under the Radio Communications Act they are not granted any extra powers
with regard to being a licenced data carrier, as Simon has already stated.
The adjudication of interference issues is dependant on your licence you
hold in that particular spectrum.   Class licencees are not protected from
Primary or Secondary Allocated users, this is the worst case situation you
can get yourself into holding a class licence, you have no come back.
Between two class licencees on the other hand the ACA will try to reach a
suitable agreement if technically possible, ie change from omni to
directional antennae etc.   If nothing can be achieved then someone will
have to walk away, no one can force you to do so !   The same system exists
between Primary and Secondary licencees aswell.

&gt;I didn't mean to imply that Airnet and Agile were nasty, simply that
&gt;they *could* make things difficult if they chose to do business that
&gt;way.

No, for once the use of class based equipment is a level playing field, the
actions of the ACA on the otherhand do vary slightly depending on clients &
past history but that is another story ~8)
