I think mandrake is very good. Future for linux, or future for mandrake?
I suspect a lot of people will join the mandrake club and save them, but
even if they dont, that doesnt kill linux and all the work they did is
still under the GPL, ready for the next company to improve. 

That has happened allready more than a few times - look at eazel and
nautilus for one! So, mandrakes future? I hope so, and I'd give them a
pretty good chance. Future of linux - definatly. There is no way to stop
it! (except perhaps set off such a huge EMP bomb that it destroys all
the computers in the world. But even then cds wouldnt be hurt and
everything would be rebuilt eventually. Not to mentions that'd require a
f***ing huge emp bomb :) Hmmm maybe I should go home now.....

&gt; Any future for Linux?  Is this just another example of a failed Linux 
&gt; enterprise?
