You might wanna get the 10.1.3 update file.. Which had some fixes for
recording devices.. not sure if the DVD-R was one of them tho.  After i
installed this, there was a slight speed bump. Ive got the G4 800Mhz model
(Got it last friday) and it seemed a bit quicker. No way in hell i could
afford the next two models :(

And more ram :) Gotta get more ram..

Cheers

&gt; I've just got my hands on a nice, shiny New iMac[1] (the one with an LCD
&gt; screen on a swivel handle). It's the top-of-the-line version with the
&gt; DVD-R drive, and I thought I'd give it a spin.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the machine seems to be handling cutting a DVD and playing MP3s off
&gt; of my iPod (through iTunes) at the same time, but the amount of desktop
&gt; lag is phenomenal.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone comment on the amount of lag (or lack thereof) that they
&gt; experience when they cut a DVD?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for putting an inquiring mind at rest.
