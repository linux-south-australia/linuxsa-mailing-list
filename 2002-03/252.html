Hi Luke, a couple of years back I started off some talks with Ross 
Chiswell of Integrity Data about a broadcast network for our community 
project.

Things went well and we even had the US suppliers considering to donate 
equipment to set up a sample network. For some reason it never came to 
anything even though it looked feasible.

Still very interested in the concept.

Ian

&gt; I am extremely interested. I have grabbed three Galaxy antennae, 
&gt; and am
&gt; in the process of modding them for 2.4Gb. Also have a couple on cards
&gt; and have just loaded FreeBSD (sorry folks :)) to use as an AP and
&gt; router. Next is an Omni and I'm up. I have listed my node here -
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://wansa.dhs.org/main.php">http://wansa.dhs.org/main.php</A>
&gt; 
&gt; but it doesn't look very active (been down for two weeks).
&gt; 
&gt; I went to the last AUUG meeting and talked to a guy who knew of some
&gt; people who were interested, but failed to get any contacts :( (mea
&gt; culpa).
&gt; 
&gt; I feel like the guy with the first phone, who ya gonna call!
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure there are others in Adelaide with a similar interest.
&gt; 
&gt; Look forward to hearing from you (and others).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Any interest in getting a community based wireless LAN link
