Subject: White page and Internode


&gt;
&gt;               Telstra White Pages Online
&gt;               temporarily became the gateway to
&gt;               one of cyberspace's red light
&gt;               districts this morning.
&gt;
&gt;               It appears that pranksters conspired to
&gt;               redirect the site's traffic to a
&gt;               pornography portal.
&gt;
&gt;               Users who attempted to access the
&gt;               online telephone directory around 10.30
&gt;               am E.S.T. found themselves in a sticky
&gt;               situation, viewing an explicit image of
&gt;               senior citizens engaged in an act of
&gt;               sexual congress.
&gt;
&gt;               At this stage, it appears that the problem
&gt;               only affected customers of South
&gt;               Australia-based Internet Service
&gt;               Provider, Internode.
&gt;
&gt;               John Harris of South Australia-based
&gt;               Impress Media, who found himself
&gt;               unexpectedly redirected to the online porn venue, said
&gt; that the situation required immediate and thorough
&gt;               investigation, despite the nature of the material it would
&gt; expose him to.
&gt;
&gt;               He said his exhaustive investigation unearthed some "asian
&gt; lovelies" but, alas, no answer to the mysterious
&gt;               re-direct.
&gt;
&gt;               "It's a legitimate excuse to check out a porn site," he
&gt; said.
&gt;
&gt;               A disappointed Harris said his investigation was brought
&gt; to an end after the site requested his credit card details.
&gt;
&gt;               South Australian Government employee Damon Wynne also
&gt; seemed more amused rather than annoyed when he
&gt;               found himself in similar circumstances to Harris this
&gt; morning. He believes that a socially engineered infiltration
&gt;               rather than a conventional network attack lies behind the
&gt; malady.
&gt;
&gt;               According to Wynne, the perpetrator probably contacted
&gt; Internode under the guise of an authorised White Pages
&gt;               Online employee and simply asked for the site's DNS
&gt; records to be changed.
&gt;
&gt;               According to sources close to Internode executives, the
&gt; ISP has recently experienced security breaches similar
&gt;               to those affecting White Pages Online today. The source
&gt; said that at least one executive would be "raising hell"
&gt;               about this should Internode be found to be responsible.
&gt;
&gt;               Telstra, White Pages Online's service provider, said that
&gt; enquiries it placed with the site's administrator, Pacific
&gt;               Access, revealed nothing.
&gt;
&gt;               Earlier today, a spokesperson for Pacific Access told
&gt; ZDNet Australia that they were investigating the problem
&gt;               but later declined to comment on the incident.
&gt;
&gt;               Harris and Wynne both said that the redirection was
&gt; corrected soon after they discovered it.
&gt;
&gt;               For comparison, Wynne pointed to examples of other
&gt; companies that have been targeted for similar, but politically
&gt;               motivated attacks in the past. In June 2000 'hack-tivists'
&gt; redirected Nike.com to Australia-based activist site
&gt;               s11.org.
&gt;
&gt;               Thus far, there appears to be no motive for the recent
&gt; attack on the White Pages site apart from schoolboy-ish
&gt;               fun.
&gt;
&gt;               Internode was contacted for comment on this report.
