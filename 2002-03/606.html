&gt; Desktop configuration is a PITA & getting everything configured so it

Indeed. That's why I try to clean my hands of it these days :-)

&gt; Probably to the point where most people on this listserv don't care, &
&gt; let their users just "figure-it-out themselves".

Yup :-) It's someone else's job here.

&gt; The reality is that the 1st interface for a user *is* the desktop, so
&gt; it needs to be simple, integrated & reliable.

Yes.

&gt; So the challenge is to maintain the desktop & the integrated workflow
&gt; from one application to another, using portable Standards.

I'm not quite sure I understand your statement (there's no context to
the message to which you replied). D'you mean that you want the
interfaces to be similar in look and feel between OS's? Can you
clarify what you mean by this?

&gt; It takes a long-time to test & configure a desktop, so you'd like to
&gt; leverage that time by being able to deploy it quickly to many nodes.

Sure. Thin client is one way of doing it, but there are other methods
that you could use. For example, when the machine reboots, syncronise
the configuration with a server-side copy.

&gt; Yes, whilst I'm interested in specific technologies, it is not meant to
&gt; be oh, you mean XWindows...

You're interested in specific technologies, but it's "not meant to be
oh, you mean XWindows"? Sorry, I don't understand the
statement.
