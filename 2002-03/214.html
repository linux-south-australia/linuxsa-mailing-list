&gt; It seems as though xinit is causing the problem. When I run it, it
&gt; continually asks me for a password, in the same fashion as the login
&gt; prompt. However, it prompts, then prompts again, one on each line, over
&gt; and over and over until you C-c it.

Some pretty broad ideas and questions that might help:
- log in on a virtual console while you're seeing "login:" and see
   what process is running on the console where you invoked xinit
- xinit often tries to start an xterm in login mode; is there anything
   odd in your shell's login script (.login or .bashrc or similar) that
   could be invoking this?
- you could put some echo lines in commonly used init files (.xinitrc,
   .login and so on) to see how far things get before the login prompt
   appears
- see what happens when you just run "X"
- are you trying to run xinit on your local host with all the correct
   permissions? (are you allowed to execute xinit, X, etc.?)
- you might try using a tool such as xhost, xauth, or SSH to ensure that
   X is allowing you in.  I'm not very knowledgable about how this works,
   but I've recently discovered that SSH handles this automatically.
- many systems have a "startx" script that configure a few things before
   running "xinit".  have you tried this?
- do you remember how you ran it previously on this host?
- is the "X" link (symbolic or hard) all as it should be?
- is xinit trying to create an X log file, but you don't have permission
   to write to it?

The lazy system administrator response might be to rerun XF86Setup or an 
equivalent tool.

I've seen some similar problems to this when I'm not in the correct 
group to perform a particular task, and I was prompted "Group password:" 
but this doesn't sound the same.

I've also had other problems with X on FBSD, including it not being able 
to run when you're using high system security (I forget exactly how this 
works -- I think it's a tunable parameter, but I don't have a box in 
front of me to check).

X really is a pain to get working nicely.

Wish I could help more.  Please don't tell me how dumb these ideas are, 
just give anything that sounds helpful a go and ignore the rest.

Yours
