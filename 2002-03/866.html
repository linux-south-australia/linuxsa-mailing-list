The point is Matt that the exchange is Telstra equipment not Primus. I was 
advising Telstra of a fault with their equipment. The fact that I am a 
Primus customer does not remove the fault from the Telstra exchange. 
Telstra needed to fix the fault not just for my benefit but also for their 
own customers. Primus could not fix the fault. So my reporting it to Primus 
only delayed Telstra being notified and delayed the correction of the fault.

If we extend this to its logical conclusion then if we have a black-out I 
should ring AGL because they sell us the electricity rather than ring ETSA 
utilities who manage the distribution network,.

&gt;Bill, I'm not really sure where you're going with this.
&gt;
&gt;In your instance, Telstra's customer is Primus, not you, they have a
&gt;responsibility to respond to Primus in regard to issues with the
&gt;provision of network services.
&gt;
&gt;When Primus sign an agreement with Telstra for the wholesale provision
&gt;of services they agree to provide service to manage their customer base,
&gt;i.e billing, customer enquiries and fault reporting.
&gt;
&gt;If Primus are your provider then you need to report it to Primus who
&gt;then follow it up with their provider (Telstra) Just as you wouldn't
&gt;ring Telstra about a billing issue with your provider Primus.
&gt;
&gt;If you are having difficulties with your provider (Primus) and their
&gt;inability to manage fault escalations then perhaps you should choose a
&gt;full service provider.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately it appears we expect customer service from business's even
&gt;when we aren't their customers.

&gt;
&gt;Isn't this the truth. I use Primus as my local, long distance and ISP.
&gt;When
&gt;the local exchange went down taking the  whole district out, I rang
&gt;Telstra
&gt;and they looked up my number and said I had to lodge a request through
&gt;Primus. I rang a neighbour, at work, who used Telstra and got them to
&gt;report it instead.
&gt;
&gt;Even though the fault was with their exchange and they could confirm it
&gt;they would not respond to the fault being reported by some-one who used
&gt;a
&gt;different carrier.
&gt;
&gt;Service is dead and buried in this age of corporate greed.

&gt; &gt;Use a competitor if it makes you feel better, but don't delude yourself
&gt;
&gt; &gt;that you're getting rid of Telstra entirely. Chances are that they're
&gt; &gt;still pulling the strings, and you can't complain to them directly when
&gt;
&gt; &gt;something goes wrong..
