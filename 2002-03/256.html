Hi, I am doing a project for year 12 Information Technology on
databases. We have to research a business and describe how (if at all)
use of database technology has been used. I thought it would be
interesting to do a business that uses OpenSource software rather than
taking the same route as every one else in my class and researching
Windows/Access (it will also give my teacher a change, as far as I know
he is in love with Windows..). I was wondering if anybody would be able
to supply me with some information on this? A reply off-board would
probably be best.

I understand that many of you won't want to help me due to time or
whatever reasons, but if you can offer me any information of the
business (of course I don't want or need private information that should
be kept inside your business) then I would really appreciate it.

The type of information I would need to know is the name and general
nature of the business, number and range of employees, and the computing
resources that it uses. I will want to comment on the objectives the
business has of the information system, and how the current computerised
system has increased the ability of the business to achieve it's main
objectives.

I would like to know the type of hardware in use such as processor, ram,
storage medium, etc. I would also like to know the operating system in
use, and especially the database software being used. If any backup
procedure is used this would be handy to know, the programs and their
use, backup medium etc, and the effectiveness of this system. Also how
the system is used, like how the data is entered, processed, and how the
end result is displayed. 

One other thing we have to write about is some issues that affect the
business because of the computerised information system, such as
viruses, privacy of information, copyright of software, staff training,
and any other contraints of the system.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you can offer any
helpful information I would be very grateful to you. Thanks again,
-Daniel
