Hi All,
    I hate to say this, but you probably have fried your
Processor. A few weeks ago, slashdot had a link to a
hardware test on processors (I cannot find the actual link
after a brief search, but it could have been Tom's Hardware
page or some such) done by an independent tester. The tests
were up against a PIII, a P4 and 2 AMD Processors, all were
high end, ie + 1Ghz clock speeds, and basically were to run
some software that gave the processor a real workout (like
quake etc.), and then remove the processor fan and see what
happens. The results were a bit sobering.

    Now I don't want to start a Pentium vs. AMD war, but it
seems that AMD has very little thermal overload protection.
The graphics and streaming video were pretty conclusive; all
processors shut down within a few seconds, but the AMD
processors died spectacularly, one even melted through the
motherboard. Both these processors were definitely DEAD. The
Pentium processors however, when refanned and rebooted came
up as if nothing happened. The final conclusion of the
tester was that AMD might perform better, but Pentiums were
more reliable with cooling accidents.

    I wish I could remember the link as the site was
definitely worth a visit. I know that this message hasn't
helped your problem, but it has hopefully made you aware of
how fragile AMD processors are.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: [ot] amd cpu?


&gt; Hi,
&gt; It appears in my endeavour to cool my Athlon 1ghz better I
have actually
&gt; fried it!  (trying to put Artic Silver III on a Chrome Orb
and it didn't
&gt; seem to work real well!  Yes, I actually RTFM'ed first to
make sure I was
&gt; doing it right)  I also broke one of the hooks on the
socket A so I'm buying
&gt; a 3clip either side cooler to get around that - hope I
haven't toasted the
&gt; MB!
&gt;
&gt; Anyway ...
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have an AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1Ghz to 1.2Ghz
they'd be willing
&gt; to part with?  Otherwise I have to goto a Duron 950Mhz
which is as high as
&gt; my MB will go .. (too earlier rev of the ASUS A7V133!)  I
can't seem to find
&gt; anyone who still sells such an old cpu (!).
&gt;
&gt; Let me know offlist ... (if anyone has tips on applying
this stuff and
&gt; making it work let me know too!  If you can help with the
installation so I
&gt; don't screw it up again I'm willing to offer a nice bottle
of sparkling
&gt; red or something else ..)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Muchly,
&gt; MMC
