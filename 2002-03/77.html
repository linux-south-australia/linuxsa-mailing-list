It really is rediculous that the laws would prevent user groups using
licence free bandwidth for anything they choose.  Let's face it, there's
more than enough government protection of Tel$tra as it is.  What harm would
sharing someone's link to the net do?  After all, in Australia someone still
has to pay for the bandwidth and more often than not this eventually gets
paid to Tel$tra as the major backbone provider.

One thing we might be able to achieve if the laws allowed would be some sort
of co-op whereby we could maybe get a volume discount.  I guess that's one
of the things they want to discourage, and the seemingly 100% grip they've
got on the last mile.

I for one would do just about anything to avoid paying Tel$stra, so I do
have a wireless link in to work for access.  I'm guessing that's legal
because I'm not giving access to the public.

Sigh... I wish someone could explain why an uncapped ADSL link in the US
costs &lt;US$200/month and the same thing here is unheard of....  And it's not
quatities of scale, because bandwidth in New Zealand is one 8th the cost of
Austalia...
