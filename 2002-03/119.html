Hi All,
	With all the discussion regarding wireless networks, it's inevitable
that there will be some community groups who will bite the bullet and
setup mini wireless lans across a limited area. 

The main complaints seem to be scalability and licensing.
From the discussion on this list it seams that licensing is only an
issue if these community groups provide a 'service', a somewhat vague
term. Also they must not interfere with either of the primary or
secondary class users of the frequency range.

So provided small communities are able to connect together in a
localised area (say 5km square) then scalability problems are reduced.
If a newer much higher bandwidth technology was to come along.
Interconnects could be put in place to bridge these communities. However
would these interconnects fall under the 'service' term? Whilst 802.11b
is not scalable, perhaps 802.11a will provide interconnect capabilities
( Although I know this is already in commercial RF range ).

To those in the RF area can someone point out some sources of
legislation to back claims you have made.

Wireless is taking hold in Adelaide, with talks on the various lists
increasing at a huge rate. It's only a matter of time before individuals
do something about it. For those that are interested, willing to try and
overcome the odds and create mini networks, what are the predominant
factors holding your back?

Cheers,
	Benjamin
