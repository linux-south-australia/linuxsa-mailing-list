&gt; If I had problems like this (and still wanted to have Windows), I'd try 
&gt; checking the BIOS/CMOS settings to ensure the correct disk geometry 
&gt; method was being used (NORMAL/LARGE/LBA).  I'd also be sure to create 
&gt; the partitions using DOS fdisk, as it doesn't always play nice with 
&gt; partitions created using Linux fdisk.

I've got it set to normal at the moment.

I don't think that it's this type of problem because I've had Windows 
installed on this drive under normal except it was Windows 1st Edition 
(which was a whole other host of hoops -- you had to reboot the machine 
20 times to actually install it because the blasted chipsets that run 
the PCI Bus Master, AGP etc wipe out all CDROM drives and you have to 
reinstall the CDROM drivers for each one which requires an extra reboot).

&gt; Is it possible to get this person to remove one of the hard disks, and 
&gt; try just using one?
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; This machine has run all versions of RedHat Linux from 6.0,
&gt;  &gt; FreeBSD 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4rc and Windows 98 First edition. In
&gt;  &gt; addition it's had uptimes under RedHat 7.1 of weeks on end.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; But Windows 98 SE won't install.
&gt; 
&gt; Wasn't FAT32 introduced around Windows 98 SE?  (It's been a while since 
&gt; I've used Windows, and such memories are now deeply buried...)  If so, 
&gt; perhaps try creating FAT16 partitions (the usual way to do this is to 
&gt; not enable large disk support when running fdisk to repartition).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, doesn't setup take several flags? (Try setup /?)  It may have some 
&gt; options to use different partition types, to format or not format, to 
&gt; skip a disk check, and so on.  Where exactly does the installation fail?

None that are useful except the one that gets rid of the marketing crap ;-)
