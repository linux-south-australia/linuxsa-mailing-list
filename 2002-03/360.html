&gt; &gt; I think ultimately it's worse in Adelaide.  The news reporting in the

&gt; 
&gt; Good thing for the internet!  I read the SMH and Australian IT by web
&gt; and buy the local hills paper (The Courier - better than the Advertiser
&gt; it actually has some real (local) news in it not just court reporting, police
&gt; rounds and beatups about the crime rate and weight loss remedies etc).

IMHO, Slashdot used to be good and fairly intelligent, or at least a
good portal to other relevent sources of information.

I now find it to be more sensationalised and less focused on being
'correct' and 'insightful'. There are still gems to be found there now and
then, and it is still interesting to see other peoples' perspectives and
understandings.

I guess this is what happens when you get 'financed'.

It seems it is a fine line between Open Source 'freedom' and and being
controlled by those who fund a project. I don't mind sponsorship or
advertising, but why does the content have to be so condecending and
clueless? 

I object to the 'make a quick buck' mentality of most moderm businesses,
which seems to be the trend in this day and age. This includes the media
and communications.
