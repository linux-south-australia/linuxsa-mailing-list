&gt; I think someone mentioned that their local newsagency? had the RH 7.2 standard

&gt; NB. I live in the North Eastern suburbs but anywhere will do! 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; On the redhat Australia site it mentions that you can get the 5 disk box for
&gt; $29.95.  It doesn't exactly tell you where and the store is obviously not
&gt; implemented yet www.redhat.com.au/store. 
&gt; I am interested in this particular product for the documentation (printed) and
&gt; support.
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.redhat.com.au/products/linux/standard.php3

Try larger newsagencies (several in the CBD) and also lsl.com.au have
it.

Of course you can go the "unofficial" way and buy Netcraft CDROMs of
RH7.2 which are more up to date than the "official" shrinkwrap version
(but no support).

Alternately you can buy the professional version from Netcraft and get
lots of extras and lots of support but out of date for a couple hundred
bucks.

Regarding documentation - you only get the installation guide in printed
form) with the $29.95 version.  It's not very useful to people who have
installed RH Linux before. What's more useful is the Customisation Guide
and the Reference Guide - all 3 are on the CD or can be downloaded free
of charge.

HTH,

Michael...
