I understand that a carrier licence and a frequency licence are two
different things, but elsewhere in Australia, interference (and/or
competition) has been dealt with by 'dobbing in' those who have
questionable legal grounds for using a wireless link.

Someone who can't use the legal high-ground of a carrier licence is much
less likely to engage in this method of RF-engineering. The lack of
precedent that has spawned a thousand mailing list threads in recent
times means that it's still an unknown and a hobby operator could find
themselves caught out on some technicality or interpretation.

I also find it difficult to believe that a carrier selling a $1000/month
spread-spectrum link will simply 'give up' if they encounter
interference. I used an Agile link once, and would not have been a happy
customer if that were the case.

I didn't mean to imply that Airnet and Agile were nasty, simply that
they *could* make things difficult if they chose to do business that
way.
