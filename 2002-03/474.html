I had a similar problem recently

The HD was being detected by the bios but with the incorrect settings
With the info listed on the HD ,cylinders heads etc, i used the auto detect
in the bios the bring up the other options and selected the correct one from
there,
Fixed the problem and could install np,
Computer was a pentium 150 with a 1.2G HD

&gt; &gt; There's one glitch:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * installing Windows is an utter pain in the arse
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The current problem is that on reboot it just corrupts
&gt; &gt; the confounded FAT file system and you get a basically
&gt; &gt; unusable registry. For those of you who don't know
&gt; &gt; if you lose the registry forget using Windows.
&gt;
&gt; If I had problems like this (and still wanted to have Windows), I'd try
&gt; checking the BIOS/CMOS settings to ensure the correct disk geometry
&gt; method was being used (NORMAL/LARGE/LBA).  I'd also be sure to create
&gt; the partitions using DOS fdisk, as it doesn't always play nice with
&gt; partitions created using Linux fdisk.
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to get this person to remove one of the hard disks, and
&gt; try just using one?
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; This machine has run all versions of RedHat Linux from 6.0,
&gt;  &gt; FreeBSD 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4rc and Windows 98 First edition. In
&gt;  &gt; addition it's had uptimes under RedHat 7.1 of weeks on end.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; But Windows 98 SE won't install.
&gt;
&gt; Wasn't FAT32 introduced around Windows 98 SE?  (It's been a while since
&gt; I've used Windows, and such memories are now deeply buried...)  If so,
&gt; perhaps try creating FAT16 partitions (the usual way to do this is to
&gt; not enable large disk support when running fdisk to repartition).
&gt;
&gt; Also, doesn't setup take several flags? (Try setup /?)  It may have some
&gt; options to use different partition types, to format or not format, to
&gt; skip a disk check, and so on.  Where exactly does the installation fail?
&gt;
&gt; One time I created a C: and D:, and after rebooting, the drive letters
&gt; were reversed, and the table was oddly corrupted, giving me the
&gt; impression that they were still the same as before booting.
&gt;
&gt; Needless to say, formatting D: didn't result in the desired effect. :-/
