&gt;  &gt; &gt; Personally, if I had a Mac, I'd run MacOS/X on it.  It's a bit of a

&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; I've actually seen Aqua (the Window Manager/Desktop Environment); I
&gt;  &gt; think it's very good, however I'm not sure whether I'd use all of its
&gt;  &gt; functionality if I had a command line interface underneath it...
&gt;  
&gt; Well, that's just the thing:  it /does/ come with a command line interface
&gt; underneath it.  You can bring up a window running your favourite shell 
&gt; (default: tcsh, which is my favourite shell) whenever you want.
&gt;
&gt; It also comes with perl, gcc, emacs, and lots of other stuff which
&gt; we unix geeks would find useful.  An X server can be installed as 
&gt; an option too, giving you the best of just about every world I can
&gt; think of.

The default install on new macs don't have most of these.. I found out you 
need the dev tools for them :) I missed the make command.. Apparently 
these are updated every now and then with new stuff.

And fink is a nice program, it can download tons of listed programs and
installs them for you. It has a port of Apt-get and uses its own versions
of programs located on the hdd. Has the BSD package installer / dslector
thingy too. Nifty

Cheers
