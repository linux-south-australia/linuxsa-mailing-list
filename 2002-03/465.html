&gt;&gt;Now I'm being accused of not knowing what I'm doing :-(
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I doubt it. Once in a while, everyone encounters a machine that just won't
&gt; do as it is meant to. 

I know what I'm doing and I was taking steps to fix it. The steps I were 
taking were simply to install and see which drivers were causing me 
problems.

However, the *most ungrateful* person to whom I gave this contraption 
decided that I was taking too long, and that I don't know what I'm doing.

&gt; Welcome to the consumer age in IT.

The consumers can go to hell.

&gt; VIA chipsets and the a variety of MSI boards seems to give people
&gt; problems, and not just with Linux or xBSD, but with Windows as well.

:-(

When one can finally get this stupid computer up, with a WDC 18Gb 5400 
RPM drive, Windows benchmarks consistently indicate that for business 
applications the CPU itself outperforms the equivalent PIII speed for 
speed, and that you require a PIII-733 at least (and more memory) to get 
the same grunt per clock cycle.
