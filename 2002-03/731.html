 &gt; What do people think about this? Personally, it irritates me (my ISP
 &gt; does transparent proxying). Personally, I dislike it because I never
 &gt; quite know where my packets are going, if I'm doing something special or
 &gt; different on that port (eg I'm manually trying to diagnose something --
 &gt; how can I be sure that it's me and not the proxy?)

1.  You never know where your packets are going anyway -- You've never
    known that at any time in the Internet's history.  Get over it.
    The only difference between a proxy and a multicast-supporting router
    is that the router works at layer two and the proxy works at layer 3.
    Other that that they're doing basically the same job.

2.  If you suspect a problem with an ISP's proxy, ring up and ask.
    It's easy enough to find out (it's simple to an ACL entry matching
    the web site you're trying to reach which prevents redirection to
    the cache to see if your problem goes away).

3.  Without transparent proxying, Broadband in Australia sucks.  Work
    out how long it takes to do a TCP 3-way handshake with a web site
    with a 300 mSec latency, then think about doing it again for each
    and every image on the web site you're viewing:  It doesn't take 
    long for that latency to add up to serious performance degradation
    due to speed-of-light limitations and long distance.  Transparent
    proxies reduce that 3-way handshake delay to mere milliseconds.
    This is a problem we have here which they don't have in the US, 
    btw, so anything you read about transparent proxies from US sources
    is necessarily skewed by missing-out on a big part of the picture
    that affects us.

A properly administered transparent proxy makes a world of difference
to performance with no impact at all on usability.  If you find a
usability impact, the only way anyone will know is if you complain
about it;  coincidentally, complaining about it is sufficient to make
the problem go away in each and every case, because once the proxy
administrators know about it they can fix it very quickly.

Cheers,
