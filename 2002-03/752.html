David :)

&gt; &gt; No honestly... windows is good as a general desktop every day use o/s
but
&gt; &gt; linux totally kicks ass as a server backend.
&gt;
&gt; Call me strange but I use RedHat 7.1 SGI-XFS 1.0.2 as my desktop for work:

Thats not strange, you just probably started with Linux first or are totally
against Microsoft.

&gt; * use Mozilla to browse
&gt; * use Mozilla for mail
&gt; * write documents in LaTeX or TeX
&gt; * occasionally use AbiWord but only to view Microsoft Documents
&gt;
&gt; Now, I could use StarOffice or OpenOffice as an Office Suite.

and your point is.....

&gt; There's nothing much my desktop lacks that an average Windows user at
&gt; work needs apart from Microsoft Office itself...

Unfortunately yes there is, 1. common user interface 2. overall
compatibility with shitloads of hardware and software.

For example David, my machine is connected to a campus network, now to be
able to connect to this god forsaken Novell thing which is run by the
dillpots at EDS I need the Novell client and the Client Trust thingy,
otherwise it don't like talking to the proxy. the login scripts run the
biggest crap program in the world called Network Application Launcher this
only works with windows... I need to be able to submit my assignments in
microsoft word / excel format, I need to be able to use microsoft project,
and I also need to be able to use Groupwise.

Now to get this running on windows all I really have to do is install the
novell client and Im on my merry way. Unfortunately on linux i would need
something like wine to run teh ms programs, then theres no guarantee theyre
gonna run properly, I need to install and configure in some unsightly way
some client thingy that might work with nds, then what about the proxy
server authentication thingy. And what about NAL, nup too complicated and I
haven't got the time, Install the novell client on windows 2000 and forget
about it.

But like I said, as a server platform, I definately have the patience to sit
and learn and configure, because that kinda stuff, like apache is actually
reasonalby straight forward, logical and it works easily, and I don't have
any requirements or compatiblity issues with straight html. ASP is a
different story. Besides we are diverging off topic...

In summary like I said, windows makes a good everyday o/s but linux is good
for running as a server. Give linux a couple of more years, and the tides
may change, I accept that, I am not against linux I am all for it, but for
the time being, linux can purr away under my desk protecting my windows box
and at several places where I run servers, and I'll just put up with the
ease of use and very few BSODs I actually do get for a bit longer.
