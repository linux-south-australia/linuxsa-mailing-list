Hmmm...

&gt; Well the NAB has some nasty fees too, although not quite that bad.

I agree with the sentiment all banks are bastards. I bank with the
National because:

1) it is national
2) I've banked with them for ages
3) their fees and charges are no less or more than any other institution
INCLUDING the credit unions
4) I have a friendly working interaction with all the staff I've ever
talked to
5) I am on talking terms with the bank manager and loan manager of my
home branch
   (very useful -- I generally don't have to pay to have cheques cleared
immediately)
6) Despite all the branch closures there's always a branch convenient to
where I am between 9-5
7) I'm familiar with their quirks
8) I can use their telephone banking system without even looking at the
telephone keypad
In other words, personal choice.

It's getting to the stage where fees and charges don't differentiate
between the banks. Let's face it -- if all employers put your money into
a bank/electronic funds transfer to some institution then the banks will
have at least one account whether you like it or not. Now, that sounds
like a monopoly -- if but a distributed one [i.e. the banks WILL get
your money but there are MANY banks] --- if ever I heard one...

My point is, for a transaction account, choose a bank that is convenient
to you. What you lose on the swings you'll gain on the roundabouts. I
could bank with ACCU and save about $20 per year -- but I'd spend that
much in petrol going to the closest branch.
