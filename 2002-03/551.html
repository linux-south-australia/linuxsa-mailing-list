&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know a good place to look for to get a security audit and
&gt; &gt; lockdown done. I have recently setup a web serving running mail, dns,
&gt; &gt; web etc, and have locked it down as much as i can (with limited time and
&gt; &gt; knowledge), but am looking to get this looked over with a fine tooth
&gt; &gt; comb by a pro. I have heard that Geoffrey Bennett may do this sort of
&gt; &gt; stuff with netcraft...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any help would be much appreciated. :)

Many companies are able to do this. In this situation you seem to have
two competing interests:

1) Business Requirements

Can you sue the scanners if something gets by?

2) Technical Requiremens

Is their scan really effective?


Ideally, you would want to answer yes to both, however that could be
quite expensive so you may need to compromise between the two factors...
