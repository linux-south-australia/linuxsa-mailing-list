&gt;&gt;I think ultimately it's worse in Adelaide.  The news reporting in the 
&gt;&gt;Advertiser and the TV stations is tabloid at best.  If you read widely (ie. 
&gt;&gt;many news services) then you can see the bias and inaccuracy.

I agree.

Have you seen SBS's news at 18:30?  It's probably the best of the 
television news bulletins in my opinion.  It's also interesting to hear 
how much newsworthy stuff is happening overseas that other stations 
don't even bother to report.

Sadly, they all went crazy for the Prince Harry on drugs story a while 
back, and continue to devote substantial amount of time to such nonsense.

One of the benefits of living in Victoria is comparably good media -- I 
now read The Age -- however, the Australian isn't too bad.  Sadly, all 
of them have had pretty poor IT news coverage recently.

&gt; precisely, the Advertiser, especially, is a total joke (and I laugh
&gt; and wince at channel 9's news ads that say "more Australians get their
&gt; news from channel 9 than anywhere else", is that why we as a country are
&gt; such an ignorant uninformed parochial bunch of yoiks?)

I noticed they only started saying that after the inception of NineMSN. 
  It was also about this time that Microsoft started distributing a 
version of Internet Explorer that made everyone's home page ninemsn.com.au.

I doubt whether this is a coincidence.

(Do you remember the spat channel 9 had when the new ratings system was 
introduced?)

Is it still those two old guys doing the "National Nine News" (I think 
their names were Rob and Kevin)?

&gt; Good thing for the internet!  I read the SMH and Australian IT by web
&gt; and buy the local hills paper (The Courier - better than the Advertiser
&gt; it actually has some real (local) news in it not just court reporting, police
&gt; rounds and beatups about the crime rate and weight loss remedies etc).

These are the sites I find useful for <A HREF="news:">news:</A>

Most of these have probably been mentioned here before.

&gt; And to make this post not completely OT, the Australian website works fine
&gt; in mozilla on linux, I could never get it to work properly in netscape but
&gt; now mozilla is good enough such that I don't need netscape anymore.

I look forward to Mozilla/Netscape 6 gaining some market share so 
companies take notice when their web sites aren't standards compliant or 
don't work in Mozilla (often the same thing).
