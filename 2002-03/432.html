Hi Andrew, timing, story of my life &lt;G&gt;

I was only aware of Yellow Dog and yes, it needs a PPC. I had better 
get google looking around for any other distros.

Sorry that I missed your chuckout, if you hear of anything similar from 
any of your mates please keep us in mind.

I was looking at a modem cable but at $50 it just becomes too hard to 
go down that path.

Cheers,  Ian

&gt; &gt; I am led to believe that only that Performer 6200 and later

&gt; Linux 
&gt; &gt; on any of the others?  Any FreeBSD distros that may do the job?
&gt; 
&gt; Ahem. FreeBSD doesn't have "distributions". It's all done in the one
&gt; place, with all the development efforts going back into the same pot.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd suggest that you use the Internet (!) and see if the hardware that
&gt; you have is supported by your distribution of choice. I seem to recall
&gt; Yellow Dog being a PPC-only distribution, which will definitely 
&gt; discountthe LC3. I *think* the 6200 is a PPC, but I'm not sure.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And while folks are listening, anybody out there with any spare 
&gt; Mac 
&gt; &gt; bits, cords, connectors etc? We have enough mice and keyboards 
&gt; but 
&gt; &gt; connecting the devices to printers, networks and modems etc 
&gt; looks like 
&gt; &gt; it could be an expensive business IF we could buy all the cables 
&gt; needed.
&gt; Whoops. I just threw out a whole bunch of stuff! What unfortunate
&gt; timing.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh, any books/manuals on these would also be appreciated. Up 
&gt; until now 
&gt; &gt; we have been a PC only place but we are learning fast how to 
&gt; like Macs 
&gt; &gt; &lt;G&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm. Apple rock.
