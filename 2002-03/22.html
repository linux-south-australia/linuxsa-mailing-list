&gt; I have never run Open Office or Star Office on my Linux systems,

&gt; very interested, probably others would as well.

Applixware is great if all you want to do is write documents and print 
them, or even give them to other ApplixWare users. From my experience 
with it, it is really hard to give documents to MSOffice users, as its 
exporting to Word format has never been very great. OpenOffice is 
better at this, though for the moment it is HUGE.

I use ApplixWare when I just want to write something that I am going to 
print, as it is smaller, faster and more reliable. Although if I have 
to give the document to another person I use OpenOffice for its Word 
conversion abilities.

It is all up to personal preference really.

Applixware:
	Fast, Small, Relliable
OpenOffice:
	Feature Rich (read bloat), Portable formats, good MSOffice integration
	A bit flakey sometimes.

Regards,
Lawrence
