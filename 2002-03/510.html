&gt; Modeline "1280x1024" 108 1280 1296 1464 1688 1024 1030 1033 1066 -hsync -vsync
&gt; - 64.0KHz horizontal, 60.0Hz vertical.

Woohoo!

I have managed to get X running, and yes I did get the frequencies around
the wrong way. I think that's what I did the first time I had a go at
calculating the damn things.

&gt; I have no idea how close "precisely" must be for your monitor (or for
&gt; any fixed-frequency monitor in fact :-).  The numbers you had before
&gt; are within 1-2%.  The new 1280x1024 numbers are within 0.1% I think.

This card -- I don't think it's the monitor -- won't tolerate the numers I
had. I suspect it's about a 0.5% tolerance.

&gt; &gt; And if you're swexy enough I might throw
&gt; &gt; myself in with the deal ;-P
&gt;
&gt; I'm just hoping that I _don't_ manage to find the correct answer :).

Oh, but you did...however in order to extricate ourselves from this little
situation (1) I don't *knowingly* do married men, especially if I've met
their wives.

However, why don't you let me buy your share of Pizza this meeting?

DSL

(1) And also not indicate whether I think you're "swexy" enough ;-P
