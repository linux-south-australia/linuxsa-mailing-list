              Telstra White Pages Online
              temporarily became the gateway to
              one of cyberspace's red light
              districts this morning. 

              It appears that pranksters conspired to
              redirect the site's traffic to a
              pornography portal. 

              Users who attempted to access the
              online telephone directory around 10.30
              am E.S.T. found themselves in a sticky
              situation, viewing an explicit image of
              senior citizens engaged in an act of
              sexual congress. 

              At this stage, it appears that the problem
              only affected customers of South
              Australia-based Internet Service
              Provider, Internode. 

              John Harris of South Australia-based
              Impress Media, who found himself
              unexpectedly redirected to the online porn venue, said
that the situation required immediate and thorough
              investigation, despite the nature of the material it would
expose him to. 

              He said his exhaustive investigation unearthed some "asian
lovelies" but, alas, no answer to the mysterious
              re-direct. 

              "It's a legitimate excuse to check out a porn site," he
said. 

              A disappointed Harris said his investigation was brought
to an end after the site requested his credit card details.

              South Australian Government employee Damon Wynne also
seemed more amused rather than annoyed when he
              found himself in similar circumstances to Harris this
morning. He believes that a socially engineered infiltration
              rather than a conventional network attack lies behind the
malady. 

              According to Wynne, the perpetrator probably contacted
Internode under the guise of an authorised White Pages
              Online employee and simply asked for the site's DNS
records to be changed. 

              According to sources close to Internode executives, the
ISP has recently experienced security breaches similar
              to those affecting White Pages Online today. The source
said that at least one executive would be “raising hell”
              about this should Internode be found to be responsible. 

              Telstra, White Pages Online’s service provider, said that
enquiries it placed with the site's administrator, Pacific
              Access, revealed nothing. 

              Earlier today, a spokesperson for Pacific Access told
ZDNet Australia that they were investigating the problem
              but later declined to comment on the incident. 

              Harris and Wynne both said that the redirection was
corrected soon after they discovered it. 

              For comparison, Wynne pointed to examples of other
companies that have been targeted for similar, but politically
              motivated attacks in the past. In June 2000 'hack-tivists'
redirected Nike.com to Australia-based activist site
              s11.org. 

              Thus far, there appears to be no motive for the recent
attack on the White Pages site apart from schoolboy-ish
              fun. 

              Internode was contacted for comment on this report.
