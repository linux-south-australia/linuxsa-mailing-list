&gt; If you've got your DNS managed by Internode, they won't change DNS

&gt; form of something such as an e-mail, fax or whatever.

My Nameserver says that whitepages.com.au is managed by:

whitepages.com.au.      1H IN NS        ns1.telstra.net.
whitepages.com.au.      1H IN NS        ns0.pacificaccess.com.au.
whitepages.com.au.      1H IN NS        ns1.pacificaccess.com.au.
whitepages.com.au.      1H IN NS        ns2.pacificaccess.com.au.

Calling, emailing, faxing or telegramming Internode shouldn't make a
difference to how their DNS reports this, unless they're doing work for
pacific access.

It's possible to spoof a DNS response .. if someone were to send fake
responses with the whitepages DNS source IP, then it could trick an ISP
DNS into redirecting to the porno site. I think someone did this to the
ANZ last year so that Telstra customers were redirected to a fake site
to collect passwords.

&gt; If that *has* happened (it may not have in this case, but I don't know
&gt; that), and the e-mail or fax was not noticeably fraudulent, I wonder
&gt; what else Internode could have done. It's unfair to blame them entirely
&gt; for this, and to call it a "security breach" is more than a bit
&gt; misleading.

It's more than likely a caching issue. Every now and then an SA
government department finds a web site that consistently returns a
completely different site to the one they were asking for, this time it
happened to be a more popular site. I'm sure Simon has the whole story.

With hashing functions used in some modern high-performance caches, it
could be possible that there is a 1 in 2^32 chance that you'll get the
wrong object.. An average isp cache can have nearly this many objects in
it, so it's not outside the realms of possibility given that most ISP's
have more than one cache.

Squid used to have some weird memory bugs that could make it return any
old thing under some conditions when it swapped to disk .. given that a
component of residential isp traffic is porn, this caused some concern!
