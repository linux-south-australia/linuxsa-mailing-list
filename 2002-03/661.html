&gt;Is the TV out for for some video cards better than others? I 
&gt;would assume
&gt;that this quality would all be hardware related. Is that correct, given
&gt;that I want to do this under Linux. What are the better models 
&gt;and makes of video cards for TV out?

I've got an Asus V6800 (32mb GF2 GTS) in my machine.  Pretty much all recent

Nvidia chipsets are ok for TV out AFAIK, at least most have the capability

I'm running it with the latest nvidia drivers, there's a bit in the driver 
docs about setting up your XF86Config to support TV out, only about 3 lines
to
change/add.
  
Sounds like the MX chips with twinview capabilities would work well, simply 
because you can have both screens running at once.  With the GTS its one or 
the other. Not sure what the GF4 chips are like, haven't seen one in action
yet.
(this is the same as under Windows as well, so there's no trade offs
happening here)

As far as setting it up, I have 2 copies of XF86Config, one for monitor
display,
and one for TV display.  When I want to switch displays I have to copy the
relevant
config file over the top of XF86config & restart X.  This doesn't bother me,
but it
would be nice to be able to switch dynamically without copying files (this
may well
be possible, but I haven't stumbled across it yet, not with the GTS)

As far as performance/quality, equal to Windows, better in my opinion
because of 
Xine's all in one capability with video files (inc Windoze plugins) and its
interface
rocks IMHO.
