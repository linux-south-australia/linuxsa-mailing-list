Well I -did- use multicast as an example in an earlier post :-)

 &gt; &gt; The underlying premise is that any other kind of proxy caching is too
 &gt; &gt; difficult for a large-size non-technical userbase to understand, and
 &gt; &gt; that the caches on the market which do non-tranparent proxying are, to
 &gt; &gt; put it bluntly, crap.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Really? Most transparent proxy products have an option to explicit
 &gt; proxying. If you need load-balancing for such an application, Alteon
 &gt; switches can behave like a proxy server on 8080 while distributing
 &gt; requests to proxies behind it.

Like I said, transparent proxies are provably equivalent to non-
transparent proxies -- As far as I know, all the vendors of transparent
proxies provide that option.

But if you use it you just end up buying back in to the reason you 
started using a transparent proxy in the first place, namely the fact
that you're unlikely to provide your customers with superior Internet
access if they aren't using a proxy while everyone else is, but that
they don't understand the issues enough to know that that's why their
internet access is slow (and even if they did understand those issues,
they don't know how to set up proxies anyway - the ISP's setup kit
automatic configuration is only useful until the next time they upgrade
their browser).

... and you have to worry about what happens when your non-transparent
proxy crashes:  If every single one of my customers says that
wwwproxy.on.net is *the* place to go for HTTP, and wwwproxy.on.net 
hangs, is it ok that *none* of my customers will be able to use the
web until I fix it?  Or I need to spend an extra $50k on a layer 4 switch
and multiple squids to achieve the same reliability benefits I get
out-of-the-box if I use transparent proxies (i.e., every single one of
my transparent proxies can crash at the same time, and all my customers
will still be able to surf).

[ I know you know this, John - just pointing it out for everyone else :-) ]

 &gt; &gt; link without it.  I'm happy to be proved wrong, but the fact that I can't
 &gt; &gt; think of a single large-scale ISP which uses squid really should be
 &gt; &gt; speaking volumes to you.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I don't know if they use squid anymore, but does connect.com count?

They did when Stuckey started working for them.  I'm not entirely sure
that they did by the time he finished working for them.

 &gt; &gt; There's a serious undercurrent here, which I'll bring up in closing:
 &gt; &gt; It seems to me that there is a subset of Internet users who have
 &gt; &gt; convinced themselves that there is some reason why transparent proxying
 &gt; &gt; is worse than "opaque" proxying.  I'm interested to know why that is.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Before transparent proxying, there was forced proxying, where Australian
 &gt; ISP's and educational institutions blocked port 80 altogether. Perhaps
 &gt; this activity has created a misinformed culture of resentment in having
 &gt; to use a proxy at all, regardless of the benefits.

I think you've hit the nail on the head.
