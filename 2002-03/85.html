Forgive me for my ignorance, but what is being said about the slowness of
this wireless LAN seems to be what is said about all networks, eg the more
devices on a network run, be it LAN, WAN or any old band, will slow down the
response rate as each device is added unless there is some method installed
for load balancing.

Once good example of this, was the small village.  As more and more people
flooded in, it became a city and then split into smaller sections to make
suburbs and then split into inner and outer metropolitan areas and then and
then and then...  It seems to me you are just trying to start a small
village.

	You're wrong, unfortunately. The law doesn't say anything about 
	whether you profit from the traffic or whether it has anything to do

	with the Internet.

	The definitions of what constitutes activity requiring a carrier 
	license is defined in terms of whether you are carrying traffic for 
	third parties. Not whether its Internet traffic. Not whether you 
	charge for it or you don't.

	That doesn't mean you'll ever get prosecuted for it, however. There 
	doesn't seem to be any drive in this country to actually -enforce- 
	the law in this specific area. Which is why people -are- doing it in

	other spots around the country already.  I think a lot of this will 
	happen.

	In practical terms, I personally doubt that anyone will ever want to

	try to sue someone for doing this, but that is only my personal 
	opinion and not a prediction.

	Upsides: Other than the legal question, playing with 802.11b spread 
	spectrum radios is: Fun, Reasonably cheap, Mostly harmless. It is 
	also: potentially unreliable; hard if not impossible to secure 
	against eavesdropping; scales really, really badly; winds up with
the 
	people in the 'middle' getting shafted by having 100% of their 
	throughput used up to move third party traffic from one side of town

	to the other, via them, almost useless for 'private' networks
because 
	its all one big fat happy virtual ethernet, etc etc.

	Those who ignore 'The Tragedy of the Commons' are doomed to repeat 
	it. This is the eventual death of this form of network. Look it up
in 
	Google.

	[but I'm not trying to stop people having fun with it until it turns

	into a useless soup of low performance frames, I'm really not - just

	don't expect it to last forever - or even a long time - before it 
	does turn into that.

	I like the way Glen Turner put this in a mailing list I was on, the 
	other say (slightly paraphrased): 'People might be ready for this 
	technology, but theistechnology isn't ready for those people'. It 
	-does- push spread spectrum beyond its capabilities.

	We have about three years of commercial deployment experience with 
	spread spectrum radios. I am not speaking from guesswork, I'm 
	speaking from operational experience. You just can't put very many 
	active nodes on a given segment of the wireless 'real estate' for 
	these radios before they become unuseably slow for everyone.

	It'll be great for the first 12-20 people. Once you get to 50
people, 
	you'll be wondering why you bothered, and why your modem is more 
	reliable.

	Cheers,
