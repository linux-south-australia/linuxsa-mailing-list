&gt; A while back, Sawfish either wasn't around, wasn't fully-functional, or 
&gt; wasn't liked, so GNOME was shipped with Enlightenment as a window

&gt; separate project, and it could provide its own programs and panel-like 
&gt; things to some extent.

thanks for the "chat", I guess I hadn't really considered how gnome
fitted with things, I was more thinking of the "you have a window
manager which does it all" type of thing. 

I discovered something called "gnome-session" which I don't have installed
so downloaded that and will have more of a play with it tonight.

(and yes I had KDE before and while it worked fine, it just looks a bit
too M$ for my liking)
