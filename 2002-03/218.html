&gt; So I'm guessing I just need to set up some config for it??
&gt; eg. I'd like the gnome desktop "button bar/panel" thing at
&gt; the bottom of the screen, but how?
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of that "bar", is it independent of the window manager?
&gt; cos at work I've got RH 6.2 with that gnome bar but running
&gt; enlightenment as the wm.  Yet on selecting enlightenment at
&gt; home I get a very weird and wacky desktop in which I can't find
&gt; anything (and without the "bar").

The programs you've mentioned all do slightly different things: some are 
classified as window managers, some are classified as desktop environments.

GNOME is a desktop environment, which provides things like:
- a common set of core libraries and widgets (maybe even an API)
- a desktop you can do stuff with (like click on it)
- a wallpaper
- a panel a bit like the Microsoft Windows toolbar

Sawfish is a window manager, which handles things like:
- window borders
- window control (minimizing, restoring, shading, etc.)
- virtual desktops

To get a fully-functional desktop (as you surely know), you'll need to 
run GNOME with a window manager such as Sawfish.

A while back, Sawfish either wasn't around, wasn't fully-functional, or 
wasn't liked, so GNOME was shipped with Enlightenment as a window 
manager.  The thing is: Enlightenment was (IIRC) actually pretty much a 
separate project, and it could provide its own programs and panel-like 
things to some extent.

In short, when you run Enlightenment with GNOME it lets GNOME draw its 
panel and desktop, and Enlightenment just draws the window borders and 
such; when you run Enlightenment on its own, it uses its own menus and 
panel (so you won't get the GNOME panel unless run explicitly run it).

FYI: KDE provides its own window manager, so KDE usually only uses that.

If you need further clarification of what does what, I'm sure there are 
sites out there that explain the difference between each component, or 
(more specifically), there might be a GNOME tutorial that explains these 
things.

Hope it helped and wasn't too patronizing. :-)
