Because you can have a maintainance procedure for software upgrade that
doesn't require a circa-2002 Linux PC and someone comfortable with UNIX to
drive it.

In an embedded device you want to keep maintenance options pretty wide
open.  You're never sure where they are going to end up or for how long
they are doing to be deployed.  They also tend to get built inside other
devices, making something simple like "open the box" a tad tricky.

At the other extreme you'll find yourself talking a admin assistant
through the upgrade.  It helps a lot if it is something they can get their
head around (delete all the files on this card, copy this folder from the
CD to the card).

You are also likely to have someone that needs to upgrade but has nowhere
near the gear you expect.  In those cases you want options like "use the
MP3 ripper to copy the files from the CD to the PDA they gave you for
inventory control, then download those files to the digital camera and get
the camera to write them to the flash card".  Without a flash card that
other devices understand you kill any creative solutions.

Going the other way, if your program fails, then you want some easy
mechanism to get that core dump back and to send new software versions.
