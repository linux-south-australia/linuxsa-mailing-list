&gt; Apologies, there was in fact meant to be a question mark next to BankSA
&gt; in the last list.  Thanks for pointing this out.
&gt;
&gt; Do you mean that you tried it and it doesn't work, or merely that they
&gt; don't want you calling them asking questions?
&gt;
&gt; I thought it was meant to be a Java application that worked on all
&gt; platforms with a JavaVM, but it's quite possible it doesn't work.

No! - It does not work and is not supported.
I use BankSA Internet Banking (no alternative at present for some things) 
as well as Savings & Loans Credit Union (great - used them for about 40 
years).
I can only access BankSA via Windows or Win4Lin (which I use).
If you access BankSA's web site and use their 'browser test', they clearly 
state that Linux is not currently supported. (It is not just a Jave thingy)
