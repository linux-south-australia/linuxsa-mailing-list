&gt; You just lease roof space on the other building so that it becomes

&gt; legal transport for Internet traffic, or so I'm told.

Sorry to disappoint you, but *everyone* using the service will need to
have their leases owned by a single corporate body.  Otherwise you are
supplying to the public.  I'm not giving you my house just to receive
a cheaper Internet service :-)

I can't tell you the amount of pain that this has caused me.  It's a rare
university where the entire site is owned by one corporate body.

&gt; &gt; Otherwise:
&gt; &gt; File sharing, chat, GAMES !, IP Telephone to other 'nerds', video
&gt; &gt; conferencing, remote access points to your home network (fast and 
cheap),
&gt; &gt; repeater for private networks to gain line of sight to each remote site,
&gt; &gt; where otherwise not possible.
&gt; 
&gt; But, it's not *really* cool unless there are a lot of people to play
&gt; games with, telephone video conference or whatever. Internet
&gt; connectivity is required.

Once again, the legislation controls "supply to the public".  So a network
dedicated to peer-to-peer gaming is still caught up by the legislation as
soon as a property boundary is crossed.


But are these are legal issues, and can be fixed with time and lobbying.

The real problem is that 802.11b simply won't do what you want it to do.
There are real RF and media access control issues that prevent 802.11b
from scaling from local area network to metro area network.

That takes time and money to fix -- starting with joining the IEEE and
kicking off a "wireless metropolitan network ad-hoc group".  You're
looking at about 3-5 years from then to a finished standard.

Not that I want to discourage you from doing that.  One of the really
obvious things with 802.11b is that the IEEE missed a major user
requirement and as a result we're about to have an explosion in the
mis-use of 802.11b for metro applications that may undermine the
usefulness of 802.11b for the original local area network applications.
