Quoting Michael Kratz &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mkratz@internode.on.net">mkratz@internode.on.net</A>&gt;:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No honestly... windows is good as a general desktop every day use o/s
&gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; linux totally kicks ass as a server backend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Call me strange but I use RedHat 7.1 SGI-XFS 1.0.2 as my desktop for
&gt; work:
&gt; 
&gt; Thats not strange, you just probably started with Linux first or are
&gt; totally
&gt; against Microsoft.

Or used to use Microsoft and got fed up with the OS[1].

[snip]

&gt; &gt; There's nothing much my desktop lacks that an average Windows user at
&gt; &gt; work needs apart from Microsoft Office itself...
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately yes there is, 1. common user interface 2. overall
&gt; compatibility with shitloads of hardware and software.

1. User interface _is_ getting there with both GNOME and KDE.  Slowly, but 
surely.

2. Most hardware works eventually.  It may take a few months, but usually 
someone makes it work under Linux.

As for software, well, you are right there.  But again there's plenty of 
replacement software that interopts fairly well.  Not perfect, not fool proof, 
but at least there's no BSOD or DLL hell or registry nightmares or viruses.
 
[snip]

&gt; In summary like I said, windows makes a good everyday o/s but linux is good
&gt; for running as a server. Give linux a couple of more years, and the tides
&gt; may change, I accept that, I am not against linux I am all for it, but for
&gt; the time being, linux can purr away under my desk protecting my windows box
&gt; and at several places where I run servers, and I'll just put up with the
&gt; ease of use and very few BSODs I actually do get for a bit longer.

I understand, I'm still limited at my employer with using Windows, but I use 
Linux exclusively at home and have for at least a couple of years.  There are 
hurdles to overcome with using Linux on the desktop, but it's the better of two 
evils for me at least.

Michael...

[1] Can't complain about Excel or recent versions of Word.  But the OS?!?  But 
IE ?!?  But IIS?!?  Give me software that works or I die!
