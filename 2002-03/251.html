&gt; This complete IT outsourcing thing is pretty dumb though. What's the bet

There's also a business strategy aspect to outsourcing IT to one vendor.

Let's say you've signed to Outsourcers Are Us for 10 years for $10m pa.  
Let's say the contract early-termination clause means that OAU get a
lump-sum of 30% of the remaining contract value.

Now Hostile Takeovers Inc faces an additional $30m in cash that it needs
to find to acquire the company.  This is a 'poison-pill' strategy which 
current accounting practice deals with rather poorly.

I'm not saying that this is BoQ's motivation.  Just that there are non-IT
'benefits' to IT outsourcing.  The motivation for outsouring may not
evident outside of the company's boardroom.

PS: Of course IT outsourcing tenders also make friendly mergers harder.  
Australian Central is currently merging with an NT credit union and the
single largest cost is paying IBM for early termination of their IT
outsourcing tender with the NT credit union.
