Hi all...

I help admin www.overclockers.com.au which had around 6million page hits
last month at about 300Gb of data served.

Yesterday the server broke down (due to overload by mirroring a file) and
hard locked, which required a reset.
When it came back it had MBR corruptions which where fixed.
We found that the bulk of the mysql database files had been corrupted, but
all other files on the two hdd's in the system appeared ok.

The databases where recreated using sql dump backups and the mysql db
permissions remade (where not backed up).

Once this had been done, the server was put back up, but the loadavg shot
up to &gt;100 with mysql using all the cpu time. This was with only a slight
web serving load.

After this, i removed the install of mysql (thinking it was damaged) and
installed the latest binary install from the mysql web site.
This didnt change anything... mysql still continiued to use masses of cpu
time.
Mysql was using the same configs as it was before the crash... this
setup has worked fine for over 4 months.

Now i cant understand why this would be happening.

Is there anything else that i should look at which may be causing mysql to
use excessive amounts of cpu time?

As far as hardware goes, this shouldnt be a problem as it hasnt been in
the past.
Its a dual PIII 1Ghz with 1.5Gb ram, 10k SCSI.

Thanks a lot for any sugestions.

MWP.
