&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I received a letter from the commonwealth bank the other day, saying they
&gt; were putting a $60/year fee on standard accounts.
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is actually pretty steep, especcially considering that the CBA
&gt; don't actually offer any interest on the accounts (well, 0.000001%); they
&gt; seem to have closed most of the branches in Adelaide; their ATMs hardly ever
&gt; work, when you can find one.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the only good thing about the CBA is that i can use their netbank
&gt; service from linux happily. It works fine from the browser, no special
&gt; applications to run or firewall rules to fiddle with.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I'm going to change my accounts to somewhere else that's a little more
&gt; reasonable.
&gt; I was wondering if anyone can reccommend other banks they might be with, who
&gt; have a similar service that works from Linux?

Well although not strictly a bank, Savings & Loans gets top marks here
for me.  I've found ZERO problems with their Internet banking under
Netscape/Linux - there are a few wierd points (can't use menus so can
only check balances basically) when using Opera (my primary browser)
however.  Other than setting proxy settings, I've had to do nothing to
get it working from any platform I've tried (Linux, IRIX, Win32
various).  Quick as anything too...

The speed and usability under Linux was one of the major reasons for
switching from BankSA - a disaster zone on the Internet side.

&gt; (Also, any general reccommendations about which banks are the lesser of
&gt; evils among banks?)

I've found service and fees wise S&L to be pretty good too...

Feel free to ask me off list if you have any further questions.

Cheers,

Simon
