&gt; I think this is actually pretty steep, especcially considering that the CBA
&gt; don't actually offer any interest on the accounts (well, 0.000001%); they
&gt; seem to have closed most of the branches in Adelaide; their ATMs hardly ever
&gt; work, when you can find one.

You have that problem too!?  On my "free" account, I was paying more 
than 5 dollars a month because I always ended up using the ANZ or 
Westpac ATM just down the street from CommBank, because theirs was never 
working.  I'm not alone! :-)

&gt; Now, the only good thing about the CBA is that i can use their netbank
&gt; service from linux happily. It works fine from the browser, no special
&gt; applications to run or firewall rules to fiddle with.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I'm going to change my accounts to somewhere else that's a little more
&gt; reasonable.  I was wondering if anyone can reccommend other banks they might
 &gt; be with, who have a similar service that works from Linux?

ANZ's Internet Banking works fine in Mozilla, and has equivalent (if not 
slightly better) functionality.  I'd guess it works in Netscape 
Navigator, as well, but don't subject yourself to that.

I've also had no problems using BankSA's Internet Banking.

I don't think the National's worked, as it required a Windows-based 
software download, however I believe it's been recently rewritten in 
Java, so it could work now.

I've not been able to properly access any bank's internet banking using 
KDE's Konqueror, as it has limited support for JavaScript and other 
languages used by internet banking services.

If you have any reservations, some banks also have a live 
trial/demonstration version.  Just make sure it's using the real thing 
and not just giving you a pretty Flash presentation.

&gt; (Also, any general reccommendations about which banks are the lesser of
&gt; evils among banks?)

I used to love smaller banks like BankSA and Bendigo Bank, as they had 
some of the best accounts and fees for normal (not so rich) people. 
Unfortunately, I move around a bit, and none of the smaller banks have 
satisfactory access Australia-wide, so I ended up with one of the big 
four.  If you don't travel much, I'd recommend BankSA/St. George Bank 
and Bendigo Bank, but I don't think any bank is perfect.

Depending on what sort of account you're looking for, the ANZ Access 
Basic account (only recently introduced) is a fairly good account IMHO. 
  It has 15 transactions per month and no monthly fee.  Indeed, I'm 
moving to that account this week from my Commonwealth Bank Steamline 
Express account.

Unless you're a rich bastard, I'd stay clear of Westpac and National. 
On the other hand, they've been known to be very friendly to them if you 
take out a large loan with them.

Naturally this is all based on my experience and opinions, and your 
experiences may vary.
