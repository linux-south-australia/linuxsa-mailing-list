Bill, I'm not really sure where you're going with this.

In your instance, Telstra's customer is Primus, not you, they have a
responsibility to respond to Primus in regard to issues with the
provision of network services.

When Primus sign an agreement with Telstra for the wholesale provision
of services they agree to provide service to manage their customer base,
i.e billing, customer enquiries and fault reporting. 

If Primus are your provider then you need to report it to Primus who
then follow it up with their provider (Telstra) Just as you wouldn't
ring Telstra about a billing issue with your provider Primus.

If you are having difficulties with your provider (Primus) and their
inability to manage fault escalations then perhaps you should choose a
full service provider.

Unfortunately it appears we expect customer service from business's even
when we aren't their customers.

Matt

Isn't this the truth. I use Primus as my local, long distance and ISP.
When 
the local exchange went down taking the  whole district out, I rang
Telstra 
and they looked up my number and said I had to lodge a request through 
Primus. I rang a neighbour, at work, who used Telstra and got them to 
report it instead.

Even though the fault was with their exchange and they could confirm it 
they would not respond to the fault being reported by some-one who used
a 
different carrier.

Service is dead and buried in this age of corporate greed.
