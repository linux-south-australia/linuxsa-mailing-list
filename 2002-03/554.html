&gt; I'm (almost) successfully running Debian Sid on my Toshiba Portege 3110CT

Well done. I just got rid of my 3110CT (which ran FreeBSD quite
nicely) a few weeks a go. It's a very nice laptop, except the
resolution is a bit low for my liking. It's nice as a traveling
laptop, though.

&gt; It works beautifully, except for one seemingly minor thing which is actually
&gt; quite major.  In my XFree86-4 config I'm using the "trident" driver, which
&gt; works great - its fast, and it displays fine.   However, if I switch out to
&gt; console, then back into X windows (or suspend the laptop, and then bring it
&gt; back up) all X shows up, is a black screen with lighter black bands around
&gt; the edge.  If I leave this going for about 5 seconds, the LCD crystals start
&gt; doing some really wierd shit and going whiter and whiter, spreading out.
&gt; I'm scared to death I'm killing the LCD doing this, so I kill X
&gt; (ctrl-alt-backspace).  So far no damage seems to have been done, but that's
&gt; because I haven't let any happen (supposedly).

Hmm. X does this just switching between X and console? I had that
problem when I suspended, but never when switching between X and
console.

&gt; I've tried using the "vesa" driver, but this displays terribly, and is
&gt; actually quite slow.  I'm sure the trident driver should work, and I've
&gt; tried various options taken from other X configs, but none seem to solve
&gt; this problem.

I don't believe that it's an XF86Config problem. Something to do with
xvidtune or something... The freebsd-mobile list archives may have
some information on this.

&gt; (Also, while I'm posting: whats your guys opinion of a nice
&gt; sexy/fast(important!)/X based mail client?  I've been using pine for quite
&gt; sometime, but I want to use something outlook style in X.  I've tried using
&gt; the Mozilla/Netscape mail clients, but they're horribly slow.)

Evolution is quite nice. I just changed back to Mutt/Emacs + IMAP in
the last week.
