I wrote this diatribe a while back, and wasn't going to send it, but
it's topical now...

Why I still use Windows on the Desktop...

People occasionally send me emails asking why I'm using Windows (and
Outlook, of all things) to post to a Linux list...

It's because it requires no thinking. I know the seven or eight ways
that it will screw up on me, and I know what to do about each one.
Occasionally reboot, occasionally restart an application or two.
Annoying, but simple. Bearable for a desktop that gets shut down each
day anyway (uptime is for servers!). Reliable in its unreliability.

Unix (I use a variety, including Debian, RedHat, FreeBSD and Solaris),
on the other hand, is generally very very good, but always fails in a
different way. This means that whenever it fails, I have to think. In
fact, sometimes when it doesn't fail, I have to think! Sometimes
thinking is good, but sometimes, I just don't want to be forced into
thinking. Admittedly, Windows forces me not to think, but, if I want to
think, I've always got a Unix to turn to.

Hence, for me, when I'm desktopping (ie not doing REAL computer work --
just using the computer as a tool to write/read emails, documents, and
communicate in other ways), I use Windows. I feel guilty in a political
sense, but figure that as much of my work depends on making Linux
servers play with Windows desktops, I have a need to have some
familiarity with this OS anyway, and while it's here, I'm not causing
any harm by using it. I also feel that I'm potentially lacking in terms
of some of the cool desktop software I could be using if I was on Linux
100%, but life's a tradeoff... I need to be able to not think about my
OS sometimes, and Windows gives me that opportunity (and anyone who
makes a bad pun from that will be &lt;slapped&gt; :)
