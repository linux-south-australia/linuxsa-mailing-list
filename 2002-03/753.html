Michael!

&gt;&gt;Call me strange but I use RedHat 7.1 SGI-XFS 1.0.2 as my desktop for work:
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Thats not strange, you just probably started with Linux first or are totally
&gt; against Microsoft.

I taught myself DOS when IBM's DOS really existed and IBM 8088's had 
BASIC interpretrs embedded into the system.

&gt;&gt;Now, I could use StarOffice or OpenOffice as an Office Suite.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; and your point is.....

For my purposes it's fine.

&gt; Unfortunately yes there is, 1. common user interface 2. overall
&gt; compatibility with shitloads of hardware and software.

Common user interface? A significant number of Windows users don't like 
the Windows user interface. I'm sure they'd like to be able to change 
it, experiment with different ones.

&gt; For example David, my machine is connected to a campus network, now to be
&gt; able to connect to this god forsaken Novell thing which is run by the
&gt; dillpots at EDS I need the Novell client and the Client Trust thingy,
&gt; otherwise it don't like talking to the proxy. the login scripts run the
&gt; biggest crap program in the world called Network Application Launcher this
&gt; only works with windows... I need to be able to submit my assignments in
&gt; microsoft word / excel format, I need to be able to use microsoft project,
&gt; and I also need to be able to use Groupwise.

Well, obviously for you it's not a viable solution.

&gt; In summary like I said, windows makes a good everyday o/s but linux is good
&gt; for running as a server. Give linux a couple of more years, and the tides
&gt; may change, I accept that, I am not against linux I am all for it, but for
&gt; the time being, linux can purr away under my desk protecting my windows box
&gt; and at several places where I run servers, and I'll just put up with the
&gt; ease of use and very few BSODs I actually do get for a bit longer.

Linux can make a good desktop O/S. You have stated what you said in 
broadbrush terms...

If all you ever do is use a web-browser to browse the Internet, then I'd 
argue that Linux is a better dektop OS...
