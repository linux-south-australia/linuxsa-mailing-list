<PRE>
&gt; I came across this web page recently (via Freshmeat), which 
&gt; gives some general tips and tricks regarding bash:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml">http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml</A>
&gt; 
&gt; However the standout feature is programmable completion. It 
&gt; extends bash to do "contextual" completion. If I type "ssh 
&gt; *tab* *tab*", it will give me a list of hosts I have recently 
&gt; ssh'd to as possible completion matches.

That is very cool. I've been wishing for a feature like that for a
*long* time... (I used to kinda emulate it by having empty files like
"<A HREF="mailto:richard@othermachine.com">richard@othermachine.com</A>" in my home directory, so ssh &lt;tab&gt; would give
me a list of these also...

However, to get this *right*, so it works predictably and consistently,
is hard. I haven't tried the above tool yet, but suspect that it may
turn out to be more of an intellitype feature than a useful tool -- by
trying to be too smart, it acts inconsistently. Presently, tab always
lists possible commands or files, depending on context... It's simple,
and easy to understand, work with, and explain. I could imagine this
tool working with "ssh &lt;tab&gt;", but not "~richard/bin/ssh &lt;tab&gt;", or
finding that "make &lt;tab&gt;" works, but "gmake &lt;tab&gt;" doesn't.
Additionally, how does it know that the "ssh" in your path is the ssh it
expects, not a shell script you wrote to make some thing quiet (or
whatever)...

&lt;digress&gt;
I just noticed on that web page, that bash already does hostname
completion if you hit tab after a @ character... very cool... i never
noticed that before.
&lt;/digress&gt;

Looking at the code, it's just a bash script itself, that sets a whole
lot of options... Each program has some sort of configuration line that
defines how to get the appropriate set of completions from what has been
typed on the command line. eg:

----
complete -f -X '!*.@(Z|gz|tgz|Gz)' gunzip zcmp zdiff zcat zegrep zfgrep
zgrep zless zmore
----

This actually works by matching the last part of the command part of the
command line with the strings on the right (so /bin/gunzip works as well
as gunzip), and completes with the stuff on the right... Make and
friends must do something a little more complex...

Anyway, IMHO, the "proper" place for this kind of thing is in the
command itself. It is the most likely to "know" what the possible
options are... It's a perfect eg of where OO-style programming comes in
handy. If each command implemented an interface that defined a function
completions(), or something, then bash could simply use that interface
to interact with each tool... (of course, this can work with plain old
C, but it's a little harder to enforce compliance)...

The problem with doing it that way is that it means that you depend on
the tool writer to comply with your interface, rather than just making
it work yourself (although, one could easily work around this...)

Anyway, enough idle thought... bye.
