&gt; never gets (and never will get) the POSIX-compliant stamp itself... Is
&gt; it just because it's not quite POSIX-compliant, is it because it would

&gt; something in the GPL or the kernel development process that makes it
&gt; impossible to certify? (or something else)...

To get POSIX compliance you wouldn't just certify a snapshot of the
kernel, but a distribution as a whole. The LSB specification includes
some of the POSIX specifications, and there are distributions working
towards becoming LSB compliant. I don't believe there is anything in
the GPL or the development process that would make it impossible to
get POSIX compliance.

There are some variations from the POSIX specification in the LSB -
sometimes because Linux developers think it works better that way,
other times because the implementation hasn't matured yet. There are
some areas where Linux is definitely not compliant - eg aio or
threads, and others where they pass the test suites very well.

The LSB has a set of test suites, some of which are POSIX test suites
(or parts of test suites which have been open sourced). You can get
more information about test suites here:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/test">http://www.linuxbase.org/test</A>

and there is a database of test suite results against a few different
distributions here:

<A HREF="http://www.freestandards.org/lsb/test/results">http://www.freestandards.org/lsb/test/results</A>

Note that you shouldn't use the above results as measure of comparing
compliance between distributions as the test suites are still in
development (meaning some failures are due to the test suites) and
various updates available for the distributions will change the
results.
