&gt;Definitely, but I'd recommend it to other users as well.

As would I.  We have a trainee here who has just taken Mandrake 8.2 home,
to install it alongside Windows.  Only bad part about that is that he will 
have it installed before me.............. :(

Apparently the retail versions of Mandrake 8.2 have Staroffice 6 included,
my copy is on pre-order & I'm taking the download edition home tonight to
install.  This will help in the Office (in)compatibility area for those 
who are worried about it (99% of Office users............sigh.......)


&gt;I was actually really, really amazed to see winex able to run 
&gt;Half Life and Counter-Strike on my Athlon XP 1600+.  Seems to 
&gt;run better than Windows (Asus A7V266-E/AA, 256MB DDR PC2100, 
&gt;TNT2).  I've finally been able to ditch my Windows partition!

Chalk up 2 successful instances of HL & CS, works great on mine too.
(still have Windoze to run a couple rally games with a Logitech FF wheel
tho)

About the only other thing I have trouble with on Linux as opposed to
Windoze:

--Excel 2000 pricelists from wholesalers who insist on using crappy VBA
scripts to run
combo boxes etc, they release their lists in PDF, but its not so easy to
export......
(Am hoping the release version of Staroffice will fix this, it crashes the
beta)

--DVD encoding/ripping etc (ie: equivalents for Flaskmpeg, Virtual Dub,
Smart Ripper), 
I still use Windoze for that, there are equivalents gradually showing up for
Linux, 
so its only a matter of time, DVD playback/TV-out etc work fine
(If anyone knows of software, post away, someone mentioned mplayer in the
TV-Out thread
last week, yet to look at it)

--can't think of anything else to put here, this time last year I could have
added at
least a dozen or more things to this list, and I wasn't using DVDs much
then........ :))
