&gt; &gt; I have read the threads in the discussion group suggesting 
&gt; &gt; that Seagate 
&gt; &gt; are good and Maxtor is bad - does this still hold true?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just about, you can add Quantum to the "crud" column too, our
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't had too many problems with Quantum.  We've got a lot of machines
&gt; running IBM drives (which are rebadged Maxtors), and we've had a few
&gt; failures with those.  I've never had a problem with Western Digital drives
&gt; or Seagate, so they'd get my recommendations.  

Unfortunately, reliability depends much more on the model than the
manufacturer.  Take IBM as an example, they make the most reliable drives
on the market with one horrible exception -- the current DeskStar. I
could give similar examples for models from all manufacturers.

This makes picking a drive a bit hit-and-miss with only the systems
builders having a good idea of how many warranty returns they have for
specific drives.

Beyond doing your business with a good systems builder the one thing that
you can do as a purchaser is to keep the heat within the chassis low.  
For example, by using a tower chassis instead of a desktop chassis or by
air conditioning your server room.
