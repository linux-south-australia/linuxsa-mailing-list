&gt;individuals.

As Glen as already intimated, correctly, you are jumping to 
conclusions here about our attitude, our intent, and our rights, all 
of which are incorrect.

I do strongly reject any implication that we'd ever be 'nasty' toward 
the operators of a hobby wireless network. My involvement in this 
discussion, as for Glen, is in an aim to avoid people inadvertently 
breaking the law. If you then choose to break it deliberately, that 
is entirely your own choice, not mine.

Should a hobby radio network appear out of the mists, I'd be the 
first to offer its users some Internet access options to go with it 
:) [hint: not free access!]

All class license radio spectrum users have the same level of rights 
(zero), regardless of whether they are a licensed carrier, if 
interference knocks them off of the air, *except* in cases where the 
interferer is operating outside of the bounds of the class license.

I have been reading a Productivity Commission report on radio 
spectrum use in this country just this morning, and this reiterates 
that the use of radio spectrum in Australia without a license is 
illegal except in emergency. A class license is still a LICENSE, and 
it has RULES associated with it.

There are a number of class licenses in Australia:

<A HREF="http://www.aca.gov.au/licence/class/index.htm">http://www.aca.gov.au/licence/class/index.htm</A>

and in particular the one we're talking about here is this one:

<A HREF="http://www.aca.gov.au/publications/info/spreadsp.htm">http://www.aca.gov.au/publications/info/spreadsp.htm</A>

 From the latter, I'll quote the following:

&gt;Breaches of Licence Conditions
&gt;
&gt;It is important that spread spectrum device users comply with the 
&gt;conditions in the class licence. Subsection 132(3) of the 
&gt;Radiocommunications Act 1992 (the Act) provides that:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;'Operation of a radiocommunications device is not authorised by a 
&gt;class licence if it is not in accordance with the conditions of the 
&gt;licence.'
&gt;
&gt;If any condition of licence is breached (for example, using higher 
&gt;power than that authorised in the class licence), that operation is 
&gt;no longer authorised under the class licence. In such instances, the 
&gt;operator would be subject to the offence provisions of the Act.
&gt;


But users of the spectrum who are operating inside of the class 
license are, by definition, licensed users and their only other issue 
is the mutual interference caused by lots of them being in the same 
place at the same time.

Being a licensed carrier carries NO extra powers in this realm. It 
carries very few extra powers in the 'deregulated' regime, in truth. 
It mostly ensures that a number of the activities we undertake to 
service our customers are unconditionally legal, rather than being 
debatably legal.

&gt;You'd do the same too if you were paying megabucks for a licence and
&gt;annual tithe.

We do pay megabucks for the annual tithe, but those payments are not 
related to access to spectrum, they are driven by the conditions of 
the Telecommunications Act (quite distinct to the Radiocommunications 
Act - they're at 90 degrees to each other in intent and issues)

The major challenge in this area is armchair experts.

If anyone really wants to 'do this', your first step should be to 
call the ACA and ask them for a written determination of whether your 
proposed activity is legal under the Telecommuniations Act, and any 
conditions that would need to be respected in order to become or 
remain legal under it.

Don't guess, ask the people who exist to serve you in this realm. 
They're generally quite happy to chat. There is also a LOT of helpful 
and detailed information on the ACA web site about the operation and 
interpretation of both acts, including a good section explaining in 
pretty clear English what activities require a Telecommunications 
Carrier License to undertake:
