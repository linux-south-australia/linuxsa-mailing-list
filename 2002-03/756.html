Andrew...

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Praise belongs to God, the Lord of all Being,
&gt;&gt; the All Merciful, the All Compassionate
&gt;&gt;   the Master of the Day of Doom.
&gt;&gt;   (The Opening to the Qu'ran)
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst the English translations of the Qu'ran are many and varied in
&gt; accuracy, the Arabic of Al-Fátíha (The Opening) certainly does not
&gt; translate to "...the Master of the Day of Doom".
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst my Arabic leaves a lot to be desired, the accuracy of the
&gt; entire aforequoted translation is, to say the least, dubious.

"The Master of the Day of Doom"...the "Day of Doom" is what Christians 
normally called Judgment Day. I have quoted a translation by one 
Professor Arberry who has rendered an interpreation of the Qu'ran as 
opposed to a literal translation.

Dawood (whose translation features in the Penguin Classics) indeed 
translates as "Master of the Day of Judgment".

I would argue that "Master of the Day of Doom" is quite a reasonable 
interpretation of this line in the Exhordium.

The Judaic/Islamic/Christian God (1) is All Compassionate, All Merciful 
to those who turn to Him or to whome He turns, the day when He does pass 
judgment will, indeed, spell doom for those who have turned away from Him.

(1) The Islamic, Christian and Judaic God are conceptually the same 
historically, although each has a different emphasis. Starting from the 
setart, the Judaic God made his Convenant. The Christians claim that 
Jesus rewrote the Convenant whilst, the Islamic people don't seem to 
have annulled the Old Covenanent but seem to say turn to Him directly.

(2) Historically, it's possible -- some scholars argue obvious -- that 
the God of the Old Testament is a semitic God of War, who then suffered 
a massive defeat (in the New Testament).

Nonetheless His Priests were quite adept politically and managed to turn 
this defeat into eternal Salvation [to conquor death you only have to 
die is nectar to the heart to people who are being persecuted and murdered].

(3) I apologise if (2) offends some of the people who believe in the God 
whom the Jews call YHWH, whose Son is purported to be Jesus and who 
passed the message, through Gabriel to Mohammed.

(4) As for my own beliefs, well, I'm quite prepared to argue religion 
and spirtuality but not on this particular list; be prepared for someone 
who's spent his life researching the topic as a hobby horse ;-)
