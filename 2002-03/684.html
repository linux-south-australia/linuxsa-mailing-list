&gt; &gt; You should be able to make a 5xbnc --&gt; vga pretty easily
with only basic
&gt; &gt; soldering skills.
&gt;
&gt; If you _ever_ see me with a soldering iron in my hands,
run for your
&gt; life :-(
&gt;

Hi All,
    You don't actually _need_ any soldering skills if you
don't want to. Many moons ago when I was making custom
computer cables for a living, I think it was a company
called AMP (no not the life insurer, but the cable connector
people), came out with a solderless D-Style connector plug.
It was supposed to be for those ultra clean environments and
they worked by crimping on the pins and then mounting the
pins into the connector. From memory these things were
expensive and complete crap, but enough people bought them
to continue manufacturing them (I am sure god knows why, but
he won't tell me). BNC Plugs have been crimp on for years
and so there is no problem there. So if you don't _want_ to
solder this project, it _is_ possible, but.....

    My advice to you is contact WIMP (I mean MIMP) Computer
Cables in Keswick (If they still exist, or one of their
competitors) and have them just make the cable for you. It
should only cost about $25-30, and it comes with a
warrantee. Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
