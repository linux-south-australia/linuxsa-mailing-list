&gt; I haven't had too many problems with Quantum.  We've got a lot of machines

&gt; or Seagate, so they'd get my recommendations.

Anyone who was building computers in the days when 286 was king and hard
drives (MFM, not IDE) were usually less than 40mb might remember that
Seagate once had a shocking reputation.

They worked hard to overcome the bad rep, and the products are usually
pretty good now as a result. In my experience Seagate drives have a more
gentle mode of failure, tending to crash recoverably or develop bad
blocks rather than die completely.
