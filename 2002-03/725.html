Hi All,

&gt;    A few weeks after that was
&gt; released another site mirrored a video allegedly from AMD
showing a
&gt; similar experiment between an Athlon XP system vs a
Pentium 4 system.
&gt;
&gt; Tom's video apparently was done with an Athlon motherboard
that didn't
&gt; have thermal protection. AMD's video did. and it was shown
to behave
&gt; similarly to the Pentium 4 system. In that video both
systems shutdown
&gt; immediately upon the motherboard detecting an overheat.
&gt;

    I am always wary of suppliers and manufacturers doing
such tests on their own and comparison equipment. Maybe
Tom's was done for kicks, but would AMD really do a demo
that showed their Processors were inferior to the opposition
in some way? I think not. It is all very well to spend extra
money on a motherboard with thermal protection, but many
punters would be buying on maximum bang for their bucks and
either not know about, or care about spending extra money on
such a thing when the cost of a big heatsink and fan is so
much less.

    I must admit however that prior to the Tom's demo, I
personally had not thought to investigate such a problem,
and I am fairly technically minded. I mentioned it to some
of the guys where I work who are "bang for buck" types, and
they hadn't even heard of it. I think that Tom's probably
selected the hardware they used not for effect, but more
likely because it was the most popular on the market at the
time. Whatever the reason, it still looked pretty good.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
