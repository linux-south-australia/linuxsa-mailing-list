&gt; &gt; How about: "It doesn't have a C drive???" (hehe)
&gt; 
&gt; According to my BIOS it does, and it works perfectly.

Erm this was in response to "There's nothing much my desktop lacks that
an average Windows user at work needs apart from Microsoft Office
itself..."

It was a reference to your "average Windows user" not understanding a
unix file system.  It was also, partially, a joke.
 
&gt; &gt; How about decent copy/paste?
&gt; 
&gt; What's wrong with:
&gt; 
&gt; "highlight something"
&gt; third button click somewhere else 

It doesn't always work, that's what's wrong with it.  Not only that,
sometimes if I need to click somewhere to get to where I want to paste,
the clipboard is emptied!

I'm not saying that it's completely broken, just that it doesn't fit in
with what your "average Windows user" (and I) will put up with.

&gt; &gt; - browser address bars should automatically select the address when
you
&gt; &gt; single left click or right click on them (for copying to clipboard
or
&gt; &gt; overwriting).
&gt; 
&gt; Mozilla's address bar is open source.

Shall I get the "average Windows user" to reprogram the address bar,
then? :-)

&gt; &gt; OK, they're only little things - but it's hard to change when you're
&gt; &gt; born and bred DOS/Windows.  If only my high school had slackware
when I
&gt; &gt; used to go there - maybe I might have learned something.
&gt; 
&gt; So you're going to give up learning now?
&gt; 
&gt; *shakes the head*

Not at all.  But at the rate Microsoft is introducing Operating Systems
and fresh bugs (which is primarily what I need to support so that I can
work and thus eat) it's hard to find the time to become proficient in
all of the Linux eccentricities too.

My point was simply that if I had STARTED on Linux (and not become
addicted to the Windows CLI/GUI), maybe that's where I'd be right now.

Microsoft do not donate software to schools out of the kindness.  It's
akin to handing out cigarettes to minors - once they're hooked you've
got them for life (mostly.)
