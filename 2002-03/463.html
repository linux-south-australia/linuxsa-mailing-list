&gt;The current problem is that on reboot it just corrupts
&gt;the confounded FAT file system and you get a basically
&gt;unusable registry. For those of you who don't know
&gt;if you lose the registry forget using Windows.

I concur. I am concurrently setting up Linux Mandrake 8.1 and windows
98, plus apps, on a laptop for my son to use for homework. The linux
side, though challenging as far as setting up X is concerned, is
logical - you can see and measure progress. The winblows side is such
a constant pain. There is very little that can be described as
understandable and logical in my experience. The tables have really
turned from the days when I first started to play with Linux. Windows
3.1 was understandable, slackware 96 was a really big reach. I now
have a kludged windows 98/office XP setup with workarounds, and a
stable Linux mandrake 8.1/applixware 5 setup that is a dream to use
and administer.
