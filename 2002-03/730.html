&gt;What do people think about this? Personally, it irritates me (my ISP
&gt;does transparent proxying). Personally, I dislike it because I never
&gt;quite know where my packets are going, if I'm doing something special or
&gt;different on that port (eg I'm manually trying to diagnose something --
&gt;how can I be sure that it's me and not the proxy?)

Transparent proxying is only going to get more and more popular with the
rise of broadband, and it's not just about the ISP saving money.

As long as you're using TCP-based protocols, you're stuck with download
mechanisms that were designed a decade ago. As your latency increases
between you and your download target, your maximum possible download speed
becomes limited by the round trip time of SYN and ACK packets. So even
though you have a 100mbit link to the rest of the Internet, a big download
might not come down any faster than 100kbytes/s from an uncongested
international location.

Transparent proxying and caching puts this data right next to you, at the
best possible latency. A good ISP cache will put at least 50% of what you're
looking for within 20ms of your broadband connection, allowing you to get
maximum speed from http. Even if the data you want isn't cached, it's been
shown that a proxy, caching or not, will benefit you with a small increase
in download speed, generally because your ISP probably has more bandwidth
than you do. A proxy will also mask any unpleasantness associated with
dropped packets during your download if your link is going flat out. It gets
to resend them to you locally instead of from across the world.

Where this gets really interesting is with proxies on either side of the
world working together. By transparently proxying port 80 requests on A to a
proxy server in the US on B, you can use some non-standard (RFC1323)
extensions to TCP between A and B to get much greater speed. By increasing
the window size between A and B you can get a much greater download speed,
even though the end user and the web site they are visiting do not support
the large window size.

To answer Richards specific problem (I'm sure he likes the additional speed
of transparent caching) you can usually get around a transparent proxy for
caching with POST or CONNECT requests.

ie:

&gt; telnet www.google.com 80
&gt; CONNECT 203.1.2.3 HTTP/1.0
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.0
&lt; HTTP/1.0 200 OK
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain
&lt; Connection: close
&lt;
&lt; Welcome to the web page on 203.1.2.3 !!!

I agree, not as easy as just hacking your own /etc/hosts, but a workaround
nonetheless. Maybe if you ask nicely your ISP can make an exception for you
on port 80. They could already be doing it for customers with Satellite
Internet connections that might not work at all with transproxy
(transparently intercepting connections is bad news for asynchronous
routes!).
