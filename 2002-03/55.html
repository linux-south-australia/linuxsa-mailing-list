Just found this link from the melbourne wireless site. 

<A HREF="http://satin.sensation.net.au/aca-carrier-qnaire.jpg">http://satin.sensation.net.au/aca-carrier-qnaire.jpg</A>

I guess that shows that it is legal to run a 2.4ghz non-commercial
network. (see question 3).

&gt; &gt; (... who has -no- problem with the concept of a hobby spread spectrum

&gt; &gt; and its up to them what they do about it. If you mean it, call the 
&gt; &gt; ACA and -ask them- if its legal. That is what they are there for).
&gt; 
&gt; That's what I asked them once. They basically said, "So long as you
&gt; don't connect it to a public network (i.e., the Internet), you can go
&gt; for your life, within the restrictions of the 2.4GHz band".
&gt; 
&gt; So, I'd have thought from that comment that an inter-house or
&gt; inter-organization WAN would be acceptable, but then again, it might
&gt; not.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't got any spare moments today, but would someone that has time
&gt; (and there are *plenty* of people out there) ring them? The ACA's
&gt; (shocking and disgusting) website says that their number is 1300 850 115
&gt; for people outside Melbourne (i.e., us).
