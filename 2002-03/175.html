Just having had a quick look, BankSA seem to have an account called
"eAccount", which is mainly geared towards the NetBanking user, which offers
unlimited Internet transactions free of charge.

It has a monthly fee of $4, but it is waived if the balance is kept about
$750 for the month.  It also comes with 12 free withdrawals.

They also seem to have a facility called a MultiAccess card, which appears
to be some kind of VISA cash card - you can make purchases anywhere VISA is
accepted, with no fees associated (as a normal VISA works), except you link
it to your savings account, and therefore have no annual fee or credit
charges.  This partially solves national access to funds as well, although
I've got NFI how they'd handle an ATM withdrawal from this "credit" account,
ala a cash advance on a normal VISA.

I've no idea what their netbanking support is like for linux browsers yet,
cos I only just looked all this stuff up :)

Looks like I'll be shifting from the Conyourwealth soon...  &lt;oldfartvoice&gt; I
remember opening that account when I was 12 years old... of course back then
we couldn't afford air - we had to breathe dirt... &lt;/oldfartvoice&gt;
