I had the same issue on my 3110ct when installing Suse7.2.
From what I can remember, I think I copied most of the linux install files
(SuSE comes on a dvd or 7 cds so hopefully debian isn't as big) onto the c:
of my win2k by mapping the cd on an external box via the network.
I then booted via floppy, selected the install media as being from hard
drive and installed.

The bottom line is that you are going to need network access to a shared
cdrom AND A LOCAL FLOPPY (assuming debian has install floppies and can
specify to install from a hdd).
I think the floppy drive is the same for the Toshiba 7020 and a few other
models and you see them locally on ebay and sold quite often.

I'd lend you mine but you probably don't live in Alice Springs.

Gidday...

I'm wanting to configure my Toshiba Portege 3110CT to dual boot
debian/win2k.  At the moment its running XP (very, very bloddy slowly), and
I have two partitions - a 4.5gig fat32 (c:), and a 1.2gig fat32 (d:).
Basically, I want to install win2k to the 4.5gig, and erase the existing
1.2gig fat32 and turn this into linux native/swap partitions.

Under normal circumstances, this would be damn easy.  However, the portege's
do not have internal cdrom or floppy drives.  I have no floppy drive, and no
way to access one, and the cdrom drive is external (pcmcia), and even though
I know linux does support it, the toshiba bios does not allow me to boot
from this.  This is the latest flashed firmware.

The main issue is actually getting linux onto the machine.  Somehow I need
to invoke the debian install program.  I can't drop to DOS, as I can't think
of any way to do this, so loadlin isn't an option either.

I can't boot from cd, I can't run loadlin, and I can't boot from floppy
disk.

Any ideas on how I'd go around this?  I'm completely lost.

Even going FreeBSD would be an option - I'm just keen to get some kind of
BSD/Linux on it.  I don't think this helps the situation though.

Thanks.
