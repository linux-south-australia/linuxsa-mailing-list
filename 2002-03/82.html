I see having a shared 'hub' , say you payed x for a antenna (pointing back
to your place), and a card or access point, shared rental (shared equip,
roof space), etc. then connected to everyone else (from this high point) -
similar to a public UHF repeater, but with your own private line in to it,
and more that one person 'talking' at once. think of it like the GSM
network, omni directional then with a directional to the next 'hop' or back
to 'base'

As for remote laptop access , unless you can get LOS to the main 'tower' ,
then hopefully someone in the area can do an extension of this network (with
a hi gain omni directional), and let you gain access to it. (just like a GSM
tower)

Internet ... well spose the main setup had some sat links and a DSL and
users well... paid for their usage (through a proxy) (send and recieve) ... 

this would take some effort to get setup (by all involved), but would be
nice.

go on.. what are your thoughts ...

has anyone played with EME (earth - moon - earth) comms ? 1.2Ghz is used for
this i believe, what about data ?

&gt; So, I'd have thought from that comment that an inter-house or 
&gt; inter-organization WAN would be acceptable, but then again, 
&gt; it might not.

Isn't the internet just a very large inter-house and inter-organisation
WAN?

I'm still interested to know (as Matthew Moyle-Croft asked) what it
really gets us. I would only be interested if I could get to the
internet through it, and it was wireless in the sense of mobile...
Ideally, I'd love to be able to take my laptop somewhere within a
theoretical wireless WAN covering the Adelaide Metro Area (and
Virginia), sit down with Aerial on head (highest easily accessible
place), and use ssh to get back to my work machine, and out over the
internet through there... I wouldn't need general internet access
(although that would be dandy), only that facility...

Is this the right idea to do what I want, or is it purely fixed point to
fixed point? I suspect it is, and truly wonder of the utility...
