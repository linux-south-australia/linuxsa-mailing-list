&gt; The main complaints seem to be scalability and licensing.
&gt; &gt;From the discussion on this list it seams that licensing is only an
&gt; issue if these community groups provide a 'service', a somewhat vague
&gt; term. Also they must not interfere with either of the primary or
&gt; secondary class users of the frequency range.

I thought the wording was "commercial".

Its an attachment of a "carrier licencing questionaire" from the aca.
Its not legal, but it was provided by them to simplify the situation and
allow people like us to work out where the hell we stand.

By the time you get to question 3 its:

"Is/are the networks used for the sole purpose of supplying carriage
services on a non-commercial basis?"

then it says:

If you answered no to this question please read below (where it says you
need a carrier licence). If you answered yes to this question no further
action is required.
 
&gt; So provided small communities are able to connect together in a
&gt; localised area (say 5km square) then scalability problems are reduced.
&gt; If a newer much higher bandwidth technology was to come along.

Theres a catch here ive noticed while looking in to this stuff. 54mbit
isnt 54mbit. Theres 802.11a which is 54mbit on 2.4ghz which is backward
compatable, and 802.11g which on 5.8ghz and isnt backwards compatable.
Be carefull when buying 54mbit stuff people! 

&gt; Interconnects could be put in place to bridge these communities. However
&gt; would these interconnects fall under the 'service' term? Whilst 802.11b
&gt; is not scalable, perhaps 802.11a will provide interconnect capabilities
&gt; ( Although I know this is already in commercial RF range ).

I'd like to be one of these. Im at panorama on a foothill so I've got
good line of site. I'd be interested in running an omni directional area
around that area as well as a focused link to elsewhere as a bridge.
You'd have to not be directly behind the city though.
 
&gt; Wireless is taking hold in Adelaide, with talks on the various lists
&gt; increasing at a huge rate. It's only a matter of time before individuals
&gt; do something about it. For those that are interested, willing to try and
&gt; overcome the odds and create mini networks, what are the predominant
&gt; factors holding your back?

Both money, and the fact nobody within my area has said "yes, i'll get
one up for sure". If someone did, then I'd probably find the money :)
Whos within a few Ks of panorama? ;)
