&gt; How about: "It doesn't have a C drive???" (hehe)

According to my BIOS it does, and it works perfectly.

&gt; How about decent copy/paste?

What's wrong with:

"highlight something"
third button click somewhere else

OR

vi file.1 file.2
5Y
:n
P

&gt; - browser address bars should automatically select the address when you
&gt; single left click or right click on them (for copying to clipboard or
&gt; overwriting).

Mozilla's address bar is open source.

&gt; If I want to paste an address in I have highlight the
&gt; current address, delete it, and hope that the address I want is still in
&gt; the clipboard because (heaven forbid) I clicked the left mouse button.

Enter this into Mozilla's bugzilla...I created a veritable flame war by 
suggesting that putting the words "about:blank" when you had a blank 
page was a total pain and seemed to be inserted by dolts who want 
Mozilla to act like IE.

&gt; - X window managers (or apps?) should implement some decent right-click
&gt; context menus (like copy, paste for example?!)

You should get something like SawFish or Enlightenment, make a custom 
theme and release it to the world. If you get really lucky the Sawfish 
people will think it's so good they'll adopt it as a default.


&gt; OK, they're only little things - but it's hard to change when you're
&gt; born and bred DOS/Windows.  If only my high school had slackware when I
&gt; used to go there - maybe I might have learned something.

So you're going to give up learning now?

*shakes the head*
