Note that the thermal protection does exist in the AMD cpus, but is slow to
react.
The tests showing the AMD chips dieing spectacularly where when the fan and
heatsink was totally removed.

If its just a case of the fan dying and stopping, the processors should be
able to save themselves. (I think Tom's hardware said something to that
effect)

So, unless you suspect your entire heatsink assembly might snap off one day,
its not too much of a worry. But, for some people that is a worry.. If
you've got an ultra-mega-ludicrously-huge heatsink and fan combination that
wieghs a couple of kilograms (so you can overclock your CPU an extra 66
mhz), then perhaps you should. So i wouldn't reccommend running the engine
computer for your aircraft engine off an AMD either in case it drops off the
next time you do a loop-de-loop ;)

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I hate to say this, but you probably have fried your
&gt; Processor. A few weeks ago, slashdot had a link to a
&gt; hardware test on processors (I cannot find the actual link
&gt; after a brief search, but it could have been Tom's Hardware
&gt; page or some such) done by an independent tester. The tests
&gt; were up against a PIII, a P4 and 2 AMD Processors, all were
&gt; high end, ie + 1Ghz clock speeds, and basically were to run
&gt; some software that gave the processor a real workout (like
&gt; quake etc.), and then remove the processor fan and see what
&gt; happens. The results were a bit sobering.
&gt;
&gt;     Now I don't want to start a Pentium vs. AMD war, but it
&gt; seems that AMD has very little thermal overload protection.
&gt; The graphics and streaming video were pretty conclusive; all
&gt; processors shut down within a few seconds, but the AMD
&gt; processors died spectacularly, one even melted through the
&gt; motherboard. Both these processors were definitely DEAD. The
&gt; Pentium processors however, when refanned and rebooted came
&gt; up as if nothing happened. The final conclusion of the
&gt; tester was that AMD might perform better, but Pentiums were
&gt; more reliable with cooling accidents.
&gt;
&gt;     I wish I could remember the link as the site was
&gt; definitely worth a visit. I know that this message hasn't
&gt; helped your problem, but it has hopefully made you aware of
&gt; how fragile AMD processors are.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; It appears in my endeavour to cool my Athlon 1ghz better I
&gt; have actually
&gt; &gt; fried it!  (trying to put Artic Silver III on a Chrome Orb
&gt; and it didn't
&gt; &gt; seem to work real well!  Yes, I actually RTFM'ed first to
&gt; make sure I was
&gt; &gt; doing it right)  I also broke one of the hooks on the
&gt; socket A so I'm buying
&gt; &gt; a 3clip either side cooler to get around that - hope I
&gt; haven't toasted the
&gt; &gt; MB!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have an AMD Athlon Thunderbird 1Ghz to 1.2Ghz
&gt; they'd be willing
&gt; &gt; to part with?  Otherwise I have to goto a Duron 950Mhz
&gt; which is as high as
&gt; &gt; my MB will go .. (too earlier rev of the ASUS A7V133!)  I
&gt; can't seem to find
&gt; &gt; anyone who still sells such an old cpu (!).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me know offlist ... (if anyone has tips on applying
&gt; this stuff and
&gt; &gt; making it work let me know too!  If you can help with the
&gt; installation so I
&gt; &gt; don't screw it up again I'm willing to offer a nice bottle
&gt; of sparkling
&gt; &gt; red or something else ..)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks Muchly,
&gt; &gt; MMC
