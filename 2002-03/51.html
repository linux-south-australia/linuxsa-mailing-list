That's what I asked them once. They basically said, "So long as you
don't connect it to a public network (i.e., the Internet), you can go
for your life, within the restrictions of the 2.4GHz band".

So, I'd have thought from that comment that an inter-house or
inter-organization WAN would be acceptable, but then again, it might
not.

I haven't got any spare moments today, but would someone that has time
(and there are *plenty* of people out there) ring them? The ACA's
(shocking and disgusting) website says that their number is 1300 850 115
for people outside Melbourne (i.e., us).
