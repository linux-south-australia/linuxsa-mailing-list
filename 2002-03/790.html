&gt; I want to set up a wireless X term on a laptop - what's a comfortable
&gt; configuration for this?  If possible - I want it to just be an X term -
&gt; if that means no OS or whatever - I don't know how X terms work or
&gt; exactly what they do.

Does your laptop support X (or does X support your laptop's display adaptor,
more correctly).  You'll need a small OS to get an Xterm on a laptop.  Yes,
Linux or BSD are good for the job.  Windows (3.11 springs to mind) will do
the job as well; there are Windows-based X servers.  There was a small
single-disk distro that had X in it... what was it? anyone recall?  You
could use something like that and hack the X configs to get it to XDCMP or
something to your server.

If you're game, Linux from Scratch (<A HREF="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org</A>) could
be massaged onto a floppy with X.

If it's wireless you should think about tunelling X (as well as every other
service) through SSH (it's supported somewhere - read the docs for SSH) to
prevent people:

a. reading your keypresses as they're sent to the host
b. reading your display as it's updated over the network

&gt; Can I remove the hard disk from the laptop?

If you set up a bootp/tftp server and set your laptop to boot from the net
card. OR alternately boot a small floppy with NFS-root in the kernel and run
a NFS server with your root partition for the laptop exported somewhere from
your server.  The NFS solution is good for the Linux route; it lets you
bypass the size limitations of floppy-disk installations.  The bootp/tftp
should also boot dos/win/*bsd/etc, but I think it has size limitations as
well. Anyone know?

&gt; So would a laptop make a good 'thin client'?

Um depends!  It's not the cheapest way of going about things...  If it's
reasonably modern I'd do a full Linux install on it, or install Windows and
X-win32 (what I run on my desktop here and at work, good combination if you
can put up with Windows crashing occasionally).

Cheers,
Adam
