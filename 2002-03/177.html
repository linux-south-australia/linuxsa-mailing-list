westpac works fine from all OS' and browsers I've tried.

&gt; evils among banks?)

However they're still a bank, so still suck (just with slightly less suction
than the other banks).  I don't pay any fees to them as our home loan etc is 
with them, YMMV.

One I can recommend is the AMP Credit Union.  Again their internet banking 
has worked with everything I've tried.  www.ampcu.com.au.
And best of they charge no fees at all, not even govt taxes, and not even
chequebook fees (like BAD etc) it's all absorbed.  Only thing is I'm not 
sure they have a branch in Adelaide, still I do everything by internet or 
phone or mail with them, the only time I've been in to a branch was to 
sign a loan agreement and pick up a bank cheque for the dosh.
