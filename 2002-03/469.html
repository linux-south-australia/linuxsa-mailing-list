&gt; There's one glitch:
&gt; 
&gt; * installing Windows is an utter pain in the arse
&gt; 
&gt; The current problem is that on reboot it just corrupts
&gt; the confounded FAT file system and you get a basically
&gt; unusable registry. For those of you who don't know
&gt; if you lose the registry forget using Windows.

If I had problems like this (and still wanted to have Windows), I'd try 
checking the BIOS/CMOS settings to ensure the correct disk geometry 
method was being used (NORMAL/LARGE/LBA).  I'd also be sure to create 
the partitions using DOS fdisk, as it doesn't always play nice with 
partitions created using Linux fdisk.

Is it possible to get this person to remove one of the hard disks, and 
try just using one?

 &gt; This machine has run all versions of RedHat Linux from 6.0,
 &gt; FreeBSD 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4rc and Windows 98 First edition. In
 &gt; addition it's had uptimes under RedHat 7.1 of weeks on end.
 &gt;
 &gt; But Windows 98 SE won't install.

Wasn't FAT32 introduced around Windows 98 SE?  (It's been a while since 
I've used Windows, and such memories are now deeply buried...)  If so, 
perhaps try creating FAT16 partitions (the usual way to do this is to 
not enable large disk support when running fdisk to repartition).

Also, doesn't setup take several flags? (Try setup /?)  It may have some 
options to use different partition types, to format or not format, to 
skip a disk check, and so on.  Where exactly does the installation fail?

One time I created a C: and D:, and after rebooting, the drive letters 
were reversed, and the table was oddly corrupted, giving me the 
impression that they were still the same as before booting.

Needless to say, formatting D: didn't result in the desired effect. :-/
