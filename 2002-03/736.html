&gt; Interesting - Which machine are you talking to when you send packets to
&gt; 224.0.0.6 ?  

Trick question - it's probably an OSPF router, not the usual server/PC
refered to as a 'machine' :)

&gt; And what path would you expect packets to take if you
&gt; wanted to ping 63.18.243.12 ?  What about if you pinged 63.18.243.12
&gt; tomorrow instead of today - should the packets take the same path, or
&gt; is it ok for them to take a completely different unknown path?

Is 63.18.243.12 the same physical machine? Many of the mechansims used
with transparent proxying are used by high-traffic web sites to improve
their performance for end users.

If your ISP uses transparent proxying, it's taking the same
high-performance techniques and applying them to *every* site on the
Internet, not just a select few that can afford to maximize throughput.
 
&gt; The underlying premise is that any other kind of proxy caching is too
&gt; difficult for a large-size non-technical userbase to understand, and
&gt; that the caches on the market which do non-tranparent proxying are, to
&gt; put it bluntly, crap.

Really? Most transparent proxy products have an option to explicit
proxying. If you need load-balancing for such an application, Alteon
switches can behave like a proxy server on 8080 while distributing
requests to proxies behind it.

&gt; link without it.  I'm happy to be proved wrong, but the fact that I can't
&gt; think of a single large-scale ISP which uses squid really should be
&gt; speaking volumes to you.

I don't know if they use squid anymore, but does connect.com count?

The results of last year's cacheoff were particularly poor for squid.
Open-source has definately fallen behind in web caching performance.
It's interesting to see former squid developers pop up in companies with
faster products.

&gt; There's a serious undercurrent here, which I'll bring up in closing:
&gt; It seems to me that there is a subset of Internet users who have
&gt; convinced themselves that there is some reason why transparent proxying
&gt; is worse than "opaque" proxying.  I'm interested to know why that is.

Before transparent proxying, there was forced proxying, where Australian
ISP's and educational institutions blocked port 80 altogether. Perhaps
this activity has created a misinformed culture of resentment in having
to use a proxy at all, regardless of the benefits.
