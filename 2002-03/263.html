&gt; Thank to the people that may be looking for answers to my questions I
&gt; worked it all out, the AcerPower 433 is going alright and have got the
&gt; display card going.  All the problem was I was giving it to much info
&gt; about the display card.

Yes, sometimes it's just best to let the computer guess...

&gt; Does any body know were I can get some apps like StarOffice etc for my
&gt; linux boxs,  as the programms that I had burnt to disk a couple years a
&gt; go, well Windows fawked up the names of the files with tildas and now my
&gt; linux box does not know what to do with GZ file.  It says to me that it
&gt; is not a valid directory or file, does any have any ideas to get around
&gt; this.

What area do you live in?
