Hi Richard,
I also use Windows on my desktop pc, though I found myself wanting to
argue some of the points you presented about Linux not yet being ready
for the desktop. I think this argument belongs a few years ago when this
was true, but now as far as I see it Linux is just as good as Windows.

I will be using Linux just as soon as I get apt-proxy working on my
server machine... for now I actually write all of my school assignments
in vim and do my email in mutt. I use windows only really to listen to
music and watch movies, everything else I ssh into Linux for.

&gt; I wrote this diatribe a while back, and wasn't going to send it, but
&gt; it's topical now...
&gt; 
&gt; Why I still use Windows on the Desktop...
&gt; 
&gt; People occasionally send me emails asking why I'm using Windows (and
&gt; Outlook, of all things) to post to a Linux list...
&gt; 

You use outlook because it requires no thinking? A program such as an
email reader you use presumably every day, at least I do. I use it so
regularly that I know exactly what I need to do, without thinking, and
usually it is a single keypress- my time spent reading mail is actually
spent reading mail, rather than fiddeling around with outlook's
interface.

&gt; It's because it requires no thinking. I know the seven or eight ways
&gt; that it will screw up on me, and I know what to do about each one.
&gt; Occasionally reboot, occasionally restart an application or two.
&gt; Annoying, but simple. Bearable for a desktop that gets shut down each
&gt; day anyway (uptime is for servers!). Reliable in its unreliability.
&gt; 

But, what about when you don't know what do do about a particular
screwup? Windows can be the most annoying OS at such time, and often
rather than there being a logical solution (and the only real problem is
keeping at it until you find the answer) you experience total
frusteration, and end up giving up. The next step is usually reformat.

My linux server also gets shut down once a day, because it is in my room
and keeps me awake. The point is that it gets shut down -only- once a
day, and -only- when I want it to. It is most annoying to be in the
middle of a game or watching a movie when windows suddely gives up for
no reason whatsoever but to cause annoyance to me.

&gt; Unix (I use a variety, including Debian, RedHat, FreeBSD and Solaris),
&gt; on the other hand, is generally very very good, but always fails in a
&gt; different way. This means that whenever it fails, I have to think. In
&gt; fact, sometimes when it doesn't fail, I have to think! Sometimes
&gt; thinking is good, but sometimes, I just don't want to be forced into
&gt; thinking. Admittedly, Windows forces me not to think, but, if I want to
&gt; think, I've always got a Unix to turn to.
&gt; 

Linux makes you think because it makes you find a solution to your
problem, rather than simply rebooting and hoping the problem has now
gone away. I know which I'd prefer.

&gt; Hence, for me, when I'm desktopping (ie not doing REAL computer work --
&gt; just using the computer as a tool to write/read emails, documents, and
&gt; communicate in other ways), I use Windows. I feel guilty in a political
&gt; sense, but figure that as much of my work depends on making Linux
&gt; servers play with Windows desktops, I have a need to have some
&gt; familiarity with this OS anyway, and while it's here, I'm not causing
&gt; any harm by using it. I also feel that I'm potentially lacking in terms
&gt; of some of the cool desktop software I could be using if I was on Linux
&gt; 100%, but life's a tradeoff... I need to be able to not think about my
&gt; OS sometimes, and Windows gives me that opportunity (and anyone who
&gt; makes a bad pun from that will be &lt;slapped&gt; :)
&gt; 

Pun... hmm, nope, mental blank. Sorry.
I tried.
