Hi All,
    In my relatively recent experience in installing Linux
on a Toshiba Laptop (a Satellite Pro 4280DVD), I found that
both RH 7.2 and Manduck 8.0 (I think, was a while ago), were
quite difficult to set up and very little auto detected and
it was a pain to configure. However, when I tried Suse 7.2
(and 7.1), I found that I had no problems at all. I
literally did a standard install and let it do it's thing
and had a fully usable system in about an hour plus a little
config and tweaking time.

    I found one of the best sources of info was the Linux on
Laptops Web pages, that had an extensive walkthrough for my
particular Laptop, and many other specific Brands and Units.
They recommend using the Linmodem Web pages to set up you
Modem, and I found this to be quite helpful also.

    My personal recommendation would be to try Suse. It is
advertised as the most up to date distribution of Linux,
basically meaning that they update their packages from the
development sites a little more often than some other
distributions do, and it certainly makes some difference.
Under the hood it is still about 99% the same as all the
other distributions, and it also comes with Star Office,
which is a snap to set up, but still a little memory and
resource hungry (I am waiting for SO 6 to be released, and
would probably even pay for it). I hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Linux on Laptop


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; It has been a while since I toyed with Linux on a laptop
so I thought I had
&gt; better do it again for the stress ;-) I mean fun.
&gt;
&gt; Laptop is a toshi sattelite 2250 CDT 600 Mhz celery, 64 Mb
RAM, 5.5 HDD, 12.1
&gt; inch TFT screen.
&gt;
&gt; I am trying manduck 8.1. Report so far... started 8:00pm,
in windoze do a
&gt; scan disk and defrag. Completed 11:00pm. Install Manduck,
including standard
&gt; config, finish 12:00 midnight. Re-start config (manual),
set host name, set X
&gt; params (600x800 24bpp, 1024x768 virtual). Setting up X
with version
&gt; 4.something wasted about an hour. Each time I configged
and tested, screen
&gt; went melty and unreadable. Eventually reverted to X
3.something. Loaded
&gt; applixware, added users, created data area and soft links.
all done in about
&gt; another hour after losing an hour to X. Now downloaded
lucent ltmodem driver
&gt; rpms for this version of manduck. will report later on how
that goes. Then
&gt; TA-DA finished.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments/advice gratefully received, except the usual
sermon about
&gt; winmodems. Not into that discussion unless you are an
expert on the subject.
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
