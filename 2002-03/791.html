&gt; &gt; There's nothing much my desktop lacks that an average Windows user
&gt; &gt; at work needs apart from Microsoft Office itself...
&gt; 
&gt; How about: "It doesn't have a C drive???" (hehe)
&gt; 
&gt; How about decent copy/paste?

bah, copy/paste in X kicks arse.  Select to copy, middle-click to paste.

I've found at times using the Edit/Copy and Edit/Paste menu options to
copy and paste *doesn't* work between qt and gtk apps, but mouse
selecting does - try the Old Way.

&gt; some more gripes:
&gt; 
&gt; - browser address bars should automatically select the address when
&gt; you single left click or right click on them (for copying to clipboard
&gt; or overwriting).  If I want to paste an address in I have highlight
&gt; the current address, delete it, and hope that the address I want is
&gt; still in the clipboard because (heaven forbid) I clicked the left
&gt; mouse button.

Did you know that in konqueror and mozilla you can middle-click-paste a
url into the rendered-page area under the address bar and it will zap to
that address?

That feature rocks.

&gt; From what I gather, KDE and Gnome have different copy/paste systems
&gt; and copying/pasting between application types is a nightmare.
&gt; 
&gt; If my memory serves me, <A HREF="http://theregister.co.uk">http://theregister.co.uk</A> reported that a
&gt; government department in England decided against using linux and
&gt; OpenOffice (or StarOffice?) largely because of the copy/paste debacle.
&gt; 
&gt; - X window managers (or apps?) should implement some decent
&gt; right-click context menus (like copy, paste for example?!)

Select and middle click!  Sheesh!
	
&gt; [rant mode off]
&gt; 
&gt; OK, they're only little things - but it's hard to change when you're
&gt; born and bred DOS/Windows.  If only my high school had slackware when
&gt; I used to go there - maybe I might have learned something.

hmmm.. I believe I went to the same high-school as you, and I use
FreeBSD and WindowMaker exclusively now :-)

&gt; I'm sure things will get better over time... The Ximian projects are
&gt; coming along nicely.

If you're in to that kind of thing ;-)
