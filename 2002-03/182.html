&gt; They also seem to have a facility called a MultiAccess card, which appears
&gt; to be some kind of VISA cash card - you can make purchases anywhere VISA is
&gt; accepted, with no fees associated (as a normal VISA works), except you link
&gt; it to your savings account, and therefore have no annual fee or credit
&gt; charges.  This partially solves national access to funds as well, although
&gt; I've got NFI how they'd handle an ATM withdrawal from this "credit" account,
&gt; ala a cash advance on a normal VISA.

If you press the credit (CR) button, it is treated as a Visa credit 
transaction.  If you press the savings (SAV) button, it is treated as an 
EFTPOS transaction.

Note that there are plans to pass the cost of the credit transaction 
onto the customer, so MultiAccess transactions may not be gratis for 
much longer.

About the national/international access: there are some options 
available, but for me they weren't adequate.  For instance, if you're 
interstate and your bank doesn't have an ATM network there, you may be 
charged a fee for using another bank's ATM.  This is probably getting 
rather off-topic, so I won't bother talking about this point any further.

&gt; Looks like I'll be shifting from the Conyourwealth soon...  &lt;oldfartvoice&gt; I
&gt; remember opening that account when I was 12 years old... of course back then
&gt; we couldn't afford air - we had to breathe dirt... &lt;/oldfartvoice&gt;

It's a shame that banks do so little to encourage customer loyalty...
