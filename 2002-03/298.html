Yes, it is good, and how they should act. Im concernd by the lack of an
openSSH update for the recent off-by-one bug under RH6.2! I thought 6.2
was still supported. There is an updated packege for 7.2. If 6.2 isnt
supported then thats bad as well, since I bet we arnt the only people
still running patched, updated and maintained 6.2 servers. I also
noticed they didnt fix squid over the weekend when the bug was reported
to bugtraq on a friday for squid. From their page:

Synopsis
New squid packages available
Advisory ID
RHSA-2002:029-09
Issue Date
2002-02-19
Updated On
2002-02-26

EG 1 week to bring out a patch. It takes the squid guys hours to make a
patch, surely it isnt too hard to open the src rpm, update it, install
it on a test box and relese?

Anyway.. just my whinge for the day...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Seems a bit wierd, redhat being one of the first
&gt; 
&gt; If you read the advisory you will discover that the bug was originally detected 
&gt; by the GNOME community, and verified by a Red Hat engineer who is part of that 
&gt; community.
&gt; 
&gt; So it is certainly not weird, "Red Hat being one of the first", since they 
&gt; verified the bug after discovery, contacted CERT, and now all distributions are 
&gt; releasing fixes just about simultaneously.
&gt; 
&gt; This is exactly how most people would like Red Hat to behave.  They are pretty 
&gt; good at security - a lot of other distros don't get security fixes out very 
&gt; quickly at all.  If you don't believe me, go and look at lwn.net and see which 
&gt; distros/OSes post fixes to problems quickly.  And if you don't think your 
&gt; distro/OS doesn't have problems go and visit 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/index.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/index.html</A> or any other of the 
&gt; multitude of sites that look at security.
