Sigh.

John, you are confusing the two license types.  There is a
radiocommunications license under the Radiocommunications Act and a
carrier license under the Telecommunications Act.  802.11b has a class
license under the Radiocommunications Act, as long as you are using
unmodified commercial equipment (always a problem with my particular user
base).

If Airnet and Internode are using 802.11b to deliver content to customers
then they are using class-licensed bandwidth and cannot make an
interference complaint under the Radiocommunications Act against other
class-licensed users.

Usually the interference problem is simply solved by using high-gain, 
narrow focus Yagi antennas.  The narrow focus implies high rejection of 
signals not directly between the two antennas, so these installations
have little potential for interference with wireless LANs.

There are some rollouts I am aware of which use omnidirectional antennas,
but I'll make my point again that in theory these rollouts have no more or
less protection under the Radiocommunications Act than any other 802.11b
user.

In practice, these links would have less protection.  The main purpose of
the class-licensed bandwidth is to provide a wireless LAN function, not to
provide a cheap alternative to point-to-point microwave.  Thus the radio
inspector would be likely to resolve interference disputes by requiring
the replacement of the 802.11b point-to-point circuit with a
point-to-point circuit in another band or the acquisition of the underused
LMDS capacity.


The legal obstacle to a freenet system is the Telecommunications Act,
which requires organisations to hold a carrier license if they provide a
communications service to the public.

This requirement is for good public policy reasons.  Public communications
systems must be reliable if used for emergency communications, must have
interception facilities and so on.  It is simply unacceptable for an
emergency call to be interrupted because someone turns their computer off.
It doesn't matter if the network owner is not-for-profit or otherwise; 
that's no satisfaction when the ambulance fails to arrive.

There are some unnecessary obstacles to community groups acquiring a
carrier license.  For example, you must be a company, any other sort of
legal entity won't do.  This leads community groups into trouble with the
Corporations Law, which requires companies to seek to maximise financial
returns to shareholders.  You would be much better off lobbying DoCA to
have these obstacles removed, and there are opportunities in the current
competition commission review to do so.  It strikes me that organic
member-owned networks actually solve some policy issues which the
department faces, so you should not assume that they would be unwilling to
hear from you.


Finally, I'd ask that you stay on the right side of the defamation laws.  
I know the principals one of the firms you mentioned and find your claims
at odds with my assessment of them.  That assessment also means that you
are unlikely to recieve a legal notice from them.  However, if you still
feel that your assessment of the firms is the correct one then you should
be keeping an eye on the letterbox :-)
