You're wrong, unfortunately. The law doesn't say anything about 
whether you profit from the traffic or whether it has anything to do 
with the Internet.

The definitions of what constitutes activity requiring a carrier 
license is defined in terms of whether you are carrying traffic for 
third parties. Not whether its Internet traffic. Not whether you 
charge for it or you don't.

That doesn't mean you'll ever get prosecuted for it, however. There 
doesn't seem to be any drive in this country to actually -enforce- 
the law in this specific area. Which is why people -are- doing it in 
other spots around the country already.  I think a lot of this will 
happen.

In practical terms, I personally doubt that anyone will ever want to 
try to sue someone for doing this, but that is only my personal 
opinion and not a prediction.

Upsides: Other than the legal question, playing with 802.11b spread 
spectrum radios is: Fun, Reasonably cheap, Mostly harmless. It is 
also: potentially unreliable; hard if not impossible to secure 
against eavesdropping; scales really, really badly; winds up with the 
people in the 'middle' getting shafted by having 100% of their 
throughput used up to move third party traffic from one side of town 
to the other, via them, almost useless for 'private' networks because 
its all one big fat happy virtual ethernet, etc etc.

Those who ignore 'The Tragedy of the Commons' are doomed to repeat 
it. This is the eventual death of this form of network. Look it up in 
Google.

[but I'm not trying to stop people having fun with it until it turns 
into a useless soup of low performance frames, I'm really not - just 
don't expect it to last forever - or even a long time - before it 
does turn into that.

I like the way Glen Turner put this in a mailing list I was on, the 
other say (slightly paraphrased): 'People might be ready for this 
technology, but theistechnology isn't ready for those people'. It 
-does- push spread spectrum beyond its capabilities.

We have about three years of commercial deployment experience with 
spread spectrum radios. I am not speaking from guesswork, I'm 
speaking from operational experience. You just can't put very many 
active nodes on a given segment of the wireless 'real estate' for 
these radios before they become unuseably slow for everyone.

It'll be great for the first 12-20 people. Once you get to 50 people, 
you'll be wondering why you bothered, and why your modem is more 
reliable.

Cheers,
Simon
