&gt;There's been a fair amount of traffic on that list relating to setting
&gt;up networks in Adelaide.  The current situation is:
&gt;
&gt;1.  There is nothing yet.

      There are some very good technical reasons for this, see comments
following;

&gt;2.  There's a fair amount of interest.
&gt;3.  There are some somewhat unclear legal regulations.  Some point to
&gt;    legislation requiring you to be a carrier in order to run a
&gt;    wide-area network, others point to exemptions for the 2.4 GHz
&gt;    band.  I'm not going to try to interpret the laws myself, but the
&gt;    fact that nets exist in other Australian cities means that it
&gt;    seems to be possible.

I agree with Simons comments, a "class" licence on 2.4Gb does not preclude
the Australian Telecommunications Act, beware the jabberwocky.

I also suggest before people invest large sums of money in Broadband
Wireless 2.4GHz equipment that they do some research into the *exact*
frequencies these cards use and who else inhabits the same band.

I can think of a large group of people who are *secondary* users of the
same band (higher in the RF pecking order) who would prevent a distributed
broadband wireless network from working around the northern and southern
areas of Adelaide.  As for other states, co-sharing of bands is a regional
issue, some states do not have the active users that Adelaide has on
2.4GHz.

This does not mean that it wont work in all cases, it will just be very hit
and miss and you may not get what you expect.

Goodluck

Matthew
