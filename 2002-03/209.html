&gt;&gt;Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I received a letter from the commonwealth bank the other day, saying they
&gt;&gt;were putting a $60/year fee on standard accounts.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think this is actually pretty steep, especcially considering that the CBA
&gt;&gt;don't actually offer any interest on the accounts (well, 0.000001%); they
&gt;&gt;seem to have closed most of the branches in Adelaide; their ATMs hardly ever
&gt;&gt;work, when you can find one.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now, the only good thing about the CBA is that i can use their netbank
&gt;&gt;service from linux happily. It works fine from the browser, no special
&gt;&gt;applications to run or firewall rules to fiddle with.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, I'm going to change my accounts to somewhere else that's a little more
&gt;&gt;reasonable.
&gt;&gt;I was wondering if anyone can reccommend other banks they might be with, who
&gt;&gt;have a similar service that works from Linux?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well although not strictly a bank, Savings & Loans gets top marks here
&gt;
I Agree, with this assesment. Moreever if you use their BPay facillity 
the fee's are amongst the lowest available.
note ,  however do not use the BPay from your account pages as this 
costs more per transaction. Transfers between accounts and between your 
accounts and those of other institutions are also pretty prompt.

&gt;
&gt;for me.  I've found ZERO problems with their Internet banking under
&gt;Netscape/Linux - there are a few wierd points (can't use menus so can
&gt;only check balances basically) when using Opera (my primary browser)
&gt;
I Second this,  when using Netscape, Galeon or Mozilla, with the Java 
Plugins installed, all the menu's etc. work fine.

&gt;
&gt;however.  Other than setting proxy settings, I've had to do nothing to
&gt;get it working from any platform I've tried (Linux, IRIX, Win32
&gt;various).  Quick as anything too...
&gt;
&gt;The speed and usability under Linux was one of the major reasons for
&gt;switching from BankSA - a disaster zone on the Internet side.
&gt;
Swapped to this, from the Adelaide bank system and found the service and 
facillities far superior, simpler layout helps too, since changing I 
have never had to query a transaction yet. On Adelaide bank I developed 
a habit of always saving the transaction pages for reference later.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;(Also, any general reccommendations about which banks are the lesser of
&gt;&gt;evils among banks?)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I've found service and fees wise S&L to be pretty good too...
&gt;
&gt;Feel free to ask me off list if you have any further questions.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Simon
