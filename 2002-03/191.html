Hi

I agree with Simon and Damien, I do everything through Savings & Loans. I
have been with them for ten years and haven't had a problem with anything.
You name it, I have it with them, savings accounts, visa accounts and a loan
with them, and I am very please with all aspects of their service, including
using their site.

Wayne

Subject: net banking


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I received a letter from the commonwealth bank the other day, saying they
&gt; were putting a $60/year fee on standard accounts.
&gt;
&gt; I think this is actually pretty steep, especcially considering that the
CBA
&gt; don't actually offer any interest on the accounts (well, 0.000001%); they
&gt; seem to have closed most of the branches in Adelaide; their ATMs hardly
ever
&gt; work, when you can find one.
&gt;
&gt; Now, the only good thing about the CBA is that i can use their netbank
&gt; service from linux happily. It works fine from the browser, no special
&gt; applications to run or firewall rules to fiddle with.
&gt;
&gt; So, I'm going to change my accounts to somewhere else that's a little more
&gt; reasonable.
&gt; I was wondering if anyone can reccommend other banks they might be with,
who
&gt; have a similar service that works from Linux?
&gt;
&gt; (Also, any general reccommendations about which banks are the lesser of
&gt; evils among banks?)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Toby
