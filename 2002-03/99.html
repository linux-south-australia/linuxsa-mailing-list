Firstly a quote from our RF forefather:  "RF is Magic" - G.Marconi

My previous post seems to have been glossed over, it was probably a little
obtuse but I will attempt to spell out some *fundamentals* for RF
networking specifically those using Class based equipment that have seemed
to overlooked ~8)

Licensing of RF communications in Australia is performed by ACA.   They
have three distinct Licensing Categories; Primary Users, Secondary Users
and Class Licensees.   Primary Users have exclusive access to that radio
spectrum and pay large amounts of money for the privilege ie Telcos (except
Armed Forces), secondary users co-share with primary users but *must* not
interfere with primary user operations and are protected from class licence
interference.   Class licences are the lowest order of the food chain and
are offered no protection from either secondary or primary users and must
not interfere with the operation of either Primary or Secondary users.
All clearly defined under the relevant Telecommunication Acts.   You will
find that the specifications that class licence equipment must meet will
generally prevent interference to primary/secondary users but strange
things are known to happen with RF comms.

Primary allocation of the 2400-2500MHz spectrum is Armed Forces, Secondary
allocation is to a number of individuals most noticeably Amateur Radio
operators, there is also a class licence allocation of 2400-2450MHz for the
low power spread spectrum WAN equipment.   I will also point out that
microwave ovens operate in the vicinity of 2475MHz with typically 500-1000W
output, have a carrier about 30MHz wide and leak more than you would like
to know about depending on age (5-8W).

 You will find all class allocations are in spectrum that is typically
unusable for commercial purposes (ie telecommunications).   If they were
useable be assured that the ACA would have licensed this to someone that
would *pay*, they do not like issuing *free* spectrum to anyone, especially
community/ self education groups.   The intent for class licence equipment
is short range garage door, on/off, laptop to PC, handheld to remote device
applications, where the likelihood of loss of service from  high powered
remote interference sources is unlikely.   Take these low power devices and
try stretch them into the *big boy* telecommunications league which is not
their intended application and you are going to be extremely disappointed
with the results.   The same can be said for Bluetooth et al.

Getting back to my initial reference to research who your RF neighbours
are, there are two high power Secondary Users of the 2.4GHz spectrum here
in Adelaide.    These services are located in Elizabeth and O'Halloran
Hill, both output approximately 200-500W (EIRP) are located at prominent
positions with carriers that are 20MHz wide and transmit more often that
not 24/7.   These users pay the ACA for the privilege, have obtained the
relevant qualifications to operate their equipment and are offered
protection from class licensees.   As I have already stated, the reverse is
not true.   The implications of this, is it is going to screw the
likelihood of this RF WAN equipment working in Adelaide based on the end
users location, if you live too close to either of these Secondary
allocated services too bad, there is no one to blame/recover costs.   There
has already been one case of this between a Secondary user in Elizabeth
interfering with a class licence user at Belair, the ACA was called in to
adjudicate and ruled in favour of the Secondary user, that system has been
switched off.

By design 802.11b cannot reject nor tolerate significant reductions of its
useable spectrum (approx 50MHz) especially in 20MHz chunks.   This is not
an issue over a short range 10-100m with high gain directional antenna's
but when you are talking about 1-10kms curvature of the earth, knife edge
diffraction, freznel zones, ground / obstruction reflections, multipathing,
path loss, effective output power, antenna gain, feed losses, mast
construction, antenna alignment become significant issues.   RF
engineers/designers earn significant $$$ for the magic they perform, the
short list previous is an indication of the typical problems they face,
there are many more let me assure you !

With reference to "renting" roof top space in the Adelaide CBD, that is
prime real estate, the costs are hideous and/or crippling.   Commercial
rates are in the 10's of thousands per year to get a single antenna on a
pole leaning over the edge of a building, community based groups with RF
interest have been trying to obtain roof space for many years and only a
very few have ever succeeded.   Using the city for any RF based
communications is going to require significant investment per year from all
users, there is also the other problem of the major telcos have already
obtained the lion share and choice spots and are not going to share these
with anyone.  ie dont even contemplate the State Bank building or Black
Stump.

I am not trying to rain on someone's parade.   The issues that I have
raised above are significant and costly to overcome.   Legalities aside,
the ideals expressed in previous posts of what people would like to achieve
from a "Community Based Wireless LAN in Adelaide" is fraught with such
large technical challenges that anyone tackling this head on is going to
loose significant amounts of hair and wear a significant proportion of egg
on ones face when things begins to fall in a heap, unless these technical
challanged are addressed and overcome.

By all means experiment with simplex point to point links between your
homes, it is great deals of fun (!), but please DO NOT try to sell the
praises and simplicity of RF WAN using class based equipment; to the wider
masses; without first researching your business case and asking investors
to contribute time/money and effort into building such a system.

P.S:   EME on 2.4GHz was achieved from Adelaide on Jan 16th 1998 using  a
115W amp into a 6M steerable dish (~47dB gain) in Edwardstown (approx
5.76MW EIRP).  Confirmed two way contact was made with a station in the USA
using morse code, total transaction time 10 minutes.   Special warnings for
Aircraft in the vicinity and exclusion zones were issued by the CAA.
Typical frequencies used for EME are 50/144/432/1250/2405 MHz with
increasing difficulty and cost, I am sure others in the US will attempt or
have attempted high frequency use.
