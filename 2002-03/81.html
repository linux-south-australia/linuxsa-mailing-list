&gt;It really is rediculous that the laws would prevent user groups using
&gt;licence free bandwidth for anything they choose.  Let's face it, there's
&gt;more than enough government protection of Tel$tra as it is.  What harm would
&gt;sharing someone's link to the net do?  After all, in Australia someone still
&gt;has to pay for the bandwidth and more often than not this eventually gets
&gt;paid to Tel$tra as the major backbone provider.

It isn't 'license free' bandwidth, it is 'class licensed' bandwidth.

They are actually different.

'license free' implies (wrongly) a lack of rules that apply to the 
spectrum usage and to the use its put to. Unfortunately the laws 
don't work that way.

This isn't about protecting Telstra.

&gt;One thing we might be able to achieve if the laws allowed would be some sort
&gt;of co-op whereby we could maybe get a volume discount.  I guess that's one
&gt;of the things they want to discourage, and the seemingly 100% grip they've
&gt;got on the last mile.
&gt;
&gt;I for one would do just about anything to avoid paying Tel$stra, so I do
&gt;have a wireless link in to work for access.  I'm guessing that's legal
&gt;because I'm not giving access to the public.

No, the definition of 'legal' is not based on whether you charge for it.

&gt;Sigh... I wish someone could explain why an uncapped ADSL link in the US
&gt;costs &lt;US$200/month and the same thing here is unheard of....  And it's not
&gt;quatities of scale, because bandwidth in New Zealand is one 8th the cost of
&gt;Austalia...

Its not unheard of here. If you want to pay me A$400 per month, I 
will happily sell you a link that's around 100 kilobits per second 
rate-limited (that's about what A$400 per month buys in this country 
right now if you want to buy flat rate no-excess Internet supply). 
Long story short, around A$500 per committed 64k segment is the going 
rate in the retail market right now.

So 'unheard of' must only refer to 'you haven't heard of it, because 
you haven't actually asked'.

The reason why Internet supply is more expensive in this country that 
in the USA has been done to death in this list and other lists. Try 
looking at the archives [super-brief answer: non-US ISP's pay 100% of 
the international transit costs to get traffic to and from the USA, 
effectively subsidising the US market]

Do you have any objective evidence for the comment about New Zealand?
