Hiya,

Well call me the idealistic type, but since 7.2 I've donated them $40
per release. I'm a MandrakeClub member, and I'll pay for the PowerPack
Edition for Mandrake 8.2. And that's after I've got the free download CD
set off someone.

Cheers,

&gt; I think mandrake is very good. Future for linux, or future for mandrake?
&gt; I suspect a lot of people will join the mandrake club and save them, but
&gt; even if they dont, that doesnt kill linux and all the work they did is
&gt; still under the GPL, ready for the next company to improve. 
&gt; 
&gt; That has happened allready more than a few times - look at eazel and
&gt; nautilus for one! So, mandrakes future? I hope so, and I'd give them a
&gt; pretty good chance. Future of linux - definatly. There is no way to stop
&gt; it! (except perhaps set off such a huge EMP bomb that it destroys all
&gt; the computers in the world. But even then cds wouldnt be hurt and
&gt; everything would be rebuilt eventually. Not to mentions that'd require a
&gt; f***ing huge emp bomb :) Hmmm maybe I should go home now.....

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any future for Linux?  Is this just another example of a failed Linux 
&gt; &gt; enterprise?
