&gt; Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question but I am using
&gt; Redhat 6.2 Linux and Samba 2.2.1a. 

<A HREF="mailto:samba-technical@samba.org">samba-technical@samba.org</A> might be a better place.

&gt;        We have Windows NT Workstations and 2000
&gt; servers with which we need to talk to.  (Note:  Can't upgrade to Redhat 7.2
&gt; or Samba 2.2.2 due to company requirements at least for a few more months.)

OK, Win2K and WinNT. So, the Samba server is a PDC? BTW, 2.2.3a or so is 
the latest, and maybe it will be 2.2.4 next week.

&gt; I have a problem with a user who is trying to write to a folder called
&gt; "qcp_docs" whilst logged in as a user "cmsdocs" to the Redhat 6.2 Linux box
&gt; called SERVER1.

OK.

&gt; The linux directory permissions are 775 for both the cmsdocs and qcp_docs
&gt; directories.

This is a good start.

&gt; The cmsdocs user is a member of the qcp_docs group (and visa versa but only
&gt; temporary - I am hoping to remove this requirement (the major user logons
&gt; have a group of the same name as their user logon).  All folders have the
&gt; user logon owning the directory and files but the group of the files and
&gt; folder belongs to a user called webmaster - this cannot be changed due to
&gt; software requirements on the server.

Hmmm, this should allow what you want.

&gt; The cms_docs user still cannot write to the qcp_docs user's folder, so since
&gt; the qcp_docs user's account is not being used by the intended user yet, we
&gt; decided to set up a couple of .bat files to allow the user to swap from
&gt; qcp_docs to cmsdocs accounts from their PC to copy their html (converted
&gt; from word) documents.
&gt; 
&gt; The swap from qcp_docs using the following commands works fine:
&gt; 
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\IPC$ &lt;\\SERVER1\IPC$&gt;  /delete
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\CMSDOCS &lt;\\SERVER1\CMSDOCS&gt;  /delete
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\IPC$ &lt;\\SERVER1\IPC$&gt;  /delete
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\QCP_DOCS &lt;\\SERVER1\QCP_DOCS&gt;  "passwdgoeshere"
&gt; /user:qcp_docs

Hmmm, I don't believe you can actually delete IPC$. It is not a share that 
shows up normally, and in anycase, WinNT and Win2K machines keep a 
connection open for MSRPC, which leads to:

&gt; Unfortunately, the moment the second .bat file is run to set the user logon
&gt; back to cms_docs using the following commands:
&gt; 
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\IPC$ &lt;\\SERVER1\IPC$&gt;  /delete
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\QCP_DOCS &lt;\\SERVER1\QCP_DOCS&gt;  /delete
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\IPC$ &lt;\\SERVER1\IPC$&gt;  /delete
&gt; net use \\SERVER1\CMSDOCS &lt;\\SERVER1\CMSDOCS&gt;  "passwdgoeshere"
&gt; /user:cmsdocs
&gt; 
&gt; The user gets the error:
&gt; System error 1219 has occurred.
&gt; The credentials supplied conflict with an existing set of credentials.

Well, or course they do, since the request goes over the same connection 
that the client has open ...

&gt; Has anyone else had this kind of problem?

Why don't you add 'debug level = 10' and make sure that your log file is 
something like /var/log/samba/log.%m in the global section above and then 
try accessing the directory as user cmsdocs or whatever and see what goes 
in the log files.
