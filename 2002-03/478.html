WinXP hasn't really improved..
I installed it on a new machine (all with fairly standard and
qualified-to-work-with-XP), and after a couple of reboots, hooked it up to a
network and ran MS Update to suck down the various patches.

Required a reboot.. Did so... Machine boots back up to a blank screen with a
polite dialog box saying it couldn't find msvcrt.dll.

Fixing the machine involved finding a linux boot disk that grokked the ms
filesystem, and searching for msvcrt.dll. 3 copies were found under the
windows subdirectory, although a wierd error came up trying to less one of
them. So, copied another one over the top. Rebooted back to windows, and it
was fine again.

NFI what happened there, but there are more stories about windows doing
wierd things than there are stories about UFO sightings.
It's probably the reason why you and I are subscribed to this list, instead
of gunning for our MSVP certificates on the iLoveW~1 mailling list ;)

&gt; Well, I give away (yes, give away):
&gt;
&gt; 1 Dick Smith 17" colour monitor
&gt; 1 Riva TNT2 Ultra-32Mb
&gt; 1 Original Athlon 650Mhz
&gt; 1 MSI6167 Motherboard
&gt; 1 Sound Card of some description
&gt; 1 RealTek 8029 AS NIC
&gt; 128Mb PC100 memory
&gt; 1 Samsung 4.3Gb drive
&gt; 1 Seagate 1.2Gb drive
&gt; Keyboards and mice
&gt;
&gt; It replaced a Pentium 100 with 48Mb of RAM. Needless to say, it's
&gt; blindingly fast in comparison.
&gt;
&gt; There's one glitch:
&gt;
&gt; * installing Windows is an utter pain in the arse
&gt;
&gt; The current problem is that on reboot it just corrupts
&gt; the confounded FAT file system and you get a basically
&gt; unusable registry. For those of you who don't know
&gt; if you lose the registry forget using Windows.
&gt;
&gt; This machine has run all versions of RedHat Linux from 6.0,
&gt; FreeBSD 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4rc and Windows 98 First edition. In
&gt; addition it's had uptimes under RedHat 7.1 of weeks on end.
&gt;
&gt; But Windows 98 SE won't install.
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm being accused of not knowing what I'm doing :-(
&gt;
&gt; And I gave the stupid thing away...talk about starying a
&gt; gift horse in the mouht.
&gt;
&gt; *stick with Linux or FreeBSD or a proprietary Unix*
&gt;
&gt; GRRRR
