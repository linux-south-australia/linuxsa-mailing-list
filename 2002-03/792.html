&gt; &gt; &gt; How about: "It doesn't have a C drive???" (hehe)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; According to my BIOS it does, and it works perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; Erm this was in response to "There's nothing much my desktop lacks that
&gt; an average Windows user at work needs apart from Microsoft Office
&gt; itself..."
&gt; 
&gt; It was a reference to your "average Windows user" not understanding a
&gt; unix file system.  It was also, partially, a joke.

To a 1user, the unix file system's MUCH easier - all they see is their
own home directory, and they can do what they like in there :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; How about decent copy/paste?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What's wrong with:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "highlight something"
&gt; &gt; third button click somewhere else 
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't always work, that's what's wrong with it.  Not only that,
&gt; sometimes if I need to click somewhere to get to where I want to paste,
&gt; the clipboard is emptied!

Well, if it makes you happier, kde comes with a "klip"-board manager
now, which works like the Office 2000 or XP multi-clipboard thing.  If
you delve into its configuration options, I'm sure you'll find a
x-selection or gtk compatibility option - or it will just work.

[snip]

&gt; Not at all.  But at the rate Microsoft is introducing Operating
&gt; Systems and fresh bugs (which is primarily what I need to support so
&gt; that I can work and thus eat) it's hard to find the time to become
&gt; proficient in all of the Linux eccentricities too.
&gt; 
&gt; My point was simply that if I had STARTED on Linux (and not become
&gt; addicted to the Windows CLI/GUI), maybe that's where I'd be right now.

I don't think that STARTING on DOS had any negative effect on my
learning of Unix!

&gt; Microsoft do not donate software to schools out of the kindness.  It's
&gt; akin to handing out cigarettes to minors - once they're hooked you've
&gt; got them for life (mostly.)

*yawn* I'm so bored of that argument.  The more I smoked
microsoftrettes, the more I disliked them :-)
