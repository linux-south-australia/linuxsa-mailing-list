&gt; All I have at present is an old Macintosh LCII (Motorola 68030 CPU),
&gt; but before I choose an upgrade I thought I would ask if anyone in this
&gt; group knows if linux has been ported to this machine?

I think there is a port to the 680x0 happening, but nothing is really
ready for prime time at the moment. At least there is no distribution
available for the 680x0 so you would have to install it piece by piece
manually. The is difficult at best, and not good for a production system.

For more information on the ports go the "<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/</A>". 
It contains links to most of the ports happening at the moment. 

&gt; How much memory and disk space is recommended for a full installation.

It depends on the distribution you use and what you install from it. 
Distributions like RedHat and Debian contain huge amount of software and
some of it will be useless for your situation. You could fit a very
complete distribution in 500meg. I have a 1.5gig partition for linux that
is reasonably full. It does contain serveral large archives tho'.

8MB ram is ok if you don't have X. 16MB ram is comfortable with X. If you
want to run lots of software, or some large applications you may want even
more ram. Enough RAM is just as important as a fast CPU.

&gt; As I'm contemplating an upgrade or new machine, what would you
&gt;  recommended (x86? Pentium? MMX? PowerPC??? (Apple)).

I think the PowerPC port is a bit more complete than the 680x0 port
mentioned above. For the moment you have to install it piece by piece.
AFIAK there are people working on distributions for PowerPC, so this may
change "real soon now".

All Intel CPUs from the 386 and above work with Linux. The clone CPUs like
Cyrix and AMD should also work. There are a few traps with the clone CPUs
tho'. I have a Cyrix, with the L1 cache bug :(. Clone CPUs aren't
recognised by the v2.0 kernels, but it doesn't stop them working. You can
get a patch so intel clones are recognised as well. This should change in
the v2.1 kernels. 

IMHO MMX is over hyped, the few instructions that it adds only speed
things up in limited situations. The changes to the cache sizes make a
bigger difference to performance. The latest binutils does contain support
for MMX instructions tho'.

&gt; Does one need to have extensive unix system management expertise to set
&gt; up and maintain such a system?

A bit of unix experience is a good thing, but not needed. Distributions
generally come with documentation and software to help with the managing
of your Linux system. There is also a lot of documentation available in
the form of HOWTOs and books to ease the transition to linux.

&gt; What other software/compilers are recommended/needed to complete the
&gt; system. (I'm interested in developing some Tcl/Tk/Tix applications which
&gt; may require C or C++ compiler).

Most distributions have a good collection of development software
including a C/C++ compiler and Tcl/Tk/Tix. To find out more about what is
contained in some distributions have a look at <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org.">http://www.debian.org.</A>
