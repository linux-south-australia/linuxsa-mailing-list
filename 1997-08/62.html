&gt;Unfortunately I have been put in a position where I am virtually forced to
&gt;install win95 on my machine so I can test some portable software. I have
&gt;heard that there were/are problems getting win95 to work with Linux
&gt;because win95 does whatever it feels like with the partition table. In
&gt;particular, is there anything to watch out for with lilo and win95?
&gt;Ideally I would like to have lilo on the MBR and let it boot both Linux
&gt;and win95. Will win95 boot from lilo-0.19 or 0.20?

I have had Win95 (the original VFAT version) and a smattering of
different Linux distributions/versions on my machine.  The version of
Lilo I have now is 0.19.   I haven't had any trouble at all apart from
some CMOS strangeness since installing Linux on my second IDE. 

Haven't worked that one out yet but it only happens when I use Lilo.
Tried wiping my Lilo entry in the MBR for awhile and booting with
Loadlin from DOS and the problem never occurred.  I will track it down
one day. 

Win95 or Linux have never damaged either of my partitions although I
installed Linux afer Win95.  I believe that Win95's install will
assimilate your MBR (read destroy).  If you haven't made a boot disk
with 'make zdisk', now might be a good time.  Also worth noting that I
have repeatedly written to and copied from my win95 partitions using
linux and my file system hasn't complained at all.  I have no
knowledge of the later FAT32 versions of Win95 though.


NOTE: I am by no means an authority of any kind on Linux. I am purely
a dabbler.
