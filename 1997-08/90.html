&gt; Can anyone suggest a cheap way of getting an dial-up access server
&gt; going?  I'm after some box like the Livingston or Cisco servers, but
&gt; I'm on a tight budget.  Something with about 8 lines would be fine,
&gt; and it would be OK if it only handled connection speeds of up to
&gt; 33.6K (although support for 56K would be better).

Strange place to post it but ....

For support of 56k you will need a PRI based solution, unfortuneatly most
vendors go for lots of modems in the one box as opposed to just eight !
More importantly if you want to support 56k or PCM modems you will have to
get a Macrolink from Telstra, this come in a minimum bundle of 20 lines.
I think that OnRamp macro may be different but please don't quote me.

The choices you have are :

o    Cisco 5200 - 60 modems, 1 ethernet and lots of problems !
o    Livingston PM3 - 60 modems, 1 ethernet - no experience to say
     otherwise
o    Bay 5000 - big sucker - very dense solution but does lack the shiney
     features of the Cisco or Livingston.

Cisco does have a 3600 series router that is coming out with 12 and 20
port digital modem cards - not here yet but that is going to be a handy
router.

The cost :

LOTS : at least $30k inc for PM3, $37 inc for 5200 and the 3640 isn't
cheap either !

&gt; 
&gt; What are my best options?  Is there a second-hand market for these
&gt; things?

The access servers have just come out really (ish). The only other thing
you could use is a 2511 from Cisco, they support 16 async lines. Second
hand cost about $3000 but you still need modems and will not support 56k.

If you are really tight for a budget we have heaps of Cyclades multiport
serial cards that work great with Linux (proven!). We have 8,16 and 32
port cards going real cheap - just email me.

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
