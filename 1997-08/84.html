David,

&gt; 
&gt; Dear experienced Linux installers
&gt; I need some help please.
&gt; 
&gt; I am about to install (Red-Hat) Linux for the first time on a data-free
disk drive (840Mb) and am a little confused about what I need to do to
partition it appropriately.
&gt; &gt;From the installation instructions, I gather that I need to create 3
partitions (one for DOS, one for Linux files, one for Linux swap-file).
&gt; &gt;From DOS FDISK I only have the option of creating DOS partitions, so I
am presuming that I need to initially create 3 DOS partitions and then,
somehow, make 2 of these Linux native partitions later.
&gt; 
&gt; Am I on the right track so far?
Not quite David.   Just create a DOS partition if you wish to have DOS at
all.
The Red Hat install will give you an option to use the Linux fdisk to
create Linux partitions.
You can use this to create any and all Linux partitions you wish to use.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If I am, I was intending to create a 400MB partition for Linux and 40Mb
partition for swap (there's 20Mb RAM on board).
&gt; I gather from talking to Matt at JoJo's last week that the 400Mb is
around the mark.
&gt; 
&gt; Is 40Mb about right for the swap partition?
It's a little large, and with 20MB RAM I'd suggest something between 16MB
and 32MB for a Swap partition.
The Install manual suggests the same size swap partition as the physical
RAM installed, and this would seem to be a good choice in your situation, a
20MB swap is what I'd settle on.   Obviously, if you had 128MB physical RAM
you'd hardly need a swap at all (but it is a good idea to always have one
anyway).
 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for listening. Hope you can help.
Hope this is of some help to you.

 regards
Don.
