<H1>modular kernel - is this a hack</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
Things were just too easy with the monolithic kernel so I decided to
try the modular approach.

After doing all the "make"s and making sure the old
/lib/modules/2.0.30  directory was renamed and the final "make
modules_install" was done, I copied/renamed the new zImage to my /boot
dir.

I couldn't find a way of getting rid of the boot up message "modprobe
can't find net-pf-5"

After much "grep"ing and "rgrep"ing I found out that net-pf-5 was the
appletalk module which I didn't include in the new kernel.

  I couldn't find out how to prevent the bootup process from looking
for this module but I finally found something that let me get rid of
the boot message by adding
"alias net-pf-5 off"   to my previously empty /etc/conf.modules file.

This sounds like a bit of a hack to me, so where could I have altered
things so that the modprobe never looked for it in the first place?
