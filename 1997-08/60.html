Hello,
I have a problem with a Linux box that's low on memory (4MB ram) and so the
solution is pretty obvious - buy more ram. Apart from an obvious difficulty
in soldering to a very old motherboard that's a valid solution :-)

However, I'm interested in finding out what's really happening. The machine
runs 2.0.30 kernel, stripped down and moduled to keep it as small as possible.
(It also has the amateur radio module-14 patches). It runs an application
that's about 2.7MB - hence the lack of memory. It starts ok and runs well
for a while. Then all sorts of things fail - inetd can fail, ls-l commmands
on the console give a seg violation (but not ls alone), or a telnet in
connects but fails and disconnects before the login prompt appears.
Sometimes the 2.7Mb application itself gives a seg violation. A console
"shutdown -fr now" command always gives
a seg violation (but init 6 doesnt, fortunately!) 

The free command shows no significant difference between operating perfectly
and the faulty times.

I suspect that a library or resident module might be being corrupted. Can
anyone help with diagnostic commands I can use to see what's happening, or
any other ideas?

Thanks in advance
Steve
