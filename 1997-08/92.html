       Hi ppls,

Not such a strange place to put up this question. From how I read the question, 
Phil is looking for a cheap alternative to a $3k + terminal server from 
Livingston/Cisco/Xylogics
The way we did this at the last ISP I worked at was to use a Linux box with and 
intelligent multi-port serial card. This will give you the flexibility of using 
a lower power host to run Linux and more serial ports. If your looking for only 
upto 8 serial ports, then for about $100 you used to be able to get a four port 
16550 serial card from Dick Smith, with each serial port able to have interupts 
of 2,5,7,10,11,12,15 (2 and 9 being the same) so with the two serial ports on 
most later mainboards, you can hunt around for a cheap 2 port serial card to 
give you COM3/4 on the usual I/O addresses.
I don't know if Dick Smith still sell these cards.

Going for a multiport intelligent cards is more costly but still cheaper than a 
terminal server from one of the majors. It's not exactly a turnkey solution but 
it give you far more flexibility. Check out a Linux Journal for multiport serial
solutions such as Stallion, Paradox (Moxa), Gtek, or RocketPort.

Hope this helps you out.

&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone suggest a cheap way of getting an dial-up access server
&gt; going?  I'm after some box like the Livingston or Cisco servers, but 
&gt; I'm on a tight budget.  Something with about 8 lines would be fine, 
 &gt; and it would be OK if it only handled connection speeds of up to
&gt; 33.6K (although support for 56K would be better).
     
Strange place to post it but ....

The access servers have just come out really (ish). The only other thing 
you could use is a 2511 from Cisco, they support 16 async lines. Second 
hand cost about $3000 but you still need modems and will not support 56k.
     
If you are really tight for a budget we have heaps of Cyclades multiport serial 
cards that work great with Linux (proven!). We have 8,16 and 32 port cards going
real cheap - just email me.
