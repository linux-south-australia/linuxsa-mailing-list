&gt; I understand there are some stability concerns with the latest stable
&gt; kernel, 2.0.30. I've heard a few people say that for them 2.0.27 or
&gt; similar was more stable. Since I've never had any compatibility probs with
&gt; my 486, I foolishly assumed that I wouldn't have any. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I've had two crashes since I upgraded. Does anyone know where the
&gt; problems lie? ie, what part of the kernel has problems?

I have been running 2.0.30 since it came out and haven't had any problems. 
General consensus is 2.0.29 is 'quite stable' so if you want to downgrade
you should probably go to that. Both the buffer and then networking code
are reported to have problems. Some people have also experienced memory
leaks with 2.0.30 and have had to shutdown and reboot after uptimes of
several weeks. The transparent proxy support is broken in 2.0.30 as well.
I think most of the major problems have been fixed with pre-2.0.31-3.
2.0.31 should be released "real soon now(tm)". Linus is taking extra care
so this kernel should be the last v2.0.

&gt; I can't beleive I foolishly deleted all my 2.0.18 stuff &lt;sigh&gt;

I always keep several different kernels on my system then I can pick which
one to boot from lilo if I am having trouble with the 'main' kernel.

Mark
