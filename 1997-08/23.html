Actually, I've seen it in several newsagents in the city and at least one 
in the suburbs.

I have been regularly buying mine (about 6 issues worth now) from the 
Fleetstreet news agency in the city near the back of the Commonwealth Bank 
and the "Black" tower (King William St and Grenfell St).  They still had 
about 3 copies left last time I looked.

Also, the newsagency in the arcade between Rundle Mall and Grenfell Street 
sells it as does the newsagent in the bottom of the Myers building.

For those near the Westfield Marion shopping monolith try the Campbells(?) 
newsagency on the upper level - have a good look because sometimes they 
don't seem to know what area it belongs in.

The only other bit of info I can add is the "latest" issue usually turns up 
about the last week of every month.

It is a pleasant change from several months ago when the magazine was 
available in the eastern states but not here.  It is good to see the 
magazine is _now_ so wide spread as it exposes more people to the potential 
of Linux.

&lt;&lt;&lt;Climbs down from soap box&gt;&gt;&gt;

Cheers,

Tony Riling

For those who are interested, I just noticed the other day that Linux
Journal is available in Blackwood at the newsagency near Foodland.
