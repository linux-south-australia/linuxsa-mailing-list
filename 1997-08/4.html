&gt; Hi,

Hi Rob!

&gt; I'm new to this group, and new to linux also. As a Solaris user (at
&gt; work) I really miss not having Unix at home for those complex
&gt; repetitive analysis type tasks (too complex for menu driven only
&gt; applications).
&gt; 
&gt; All I have at present is an old Macintosh LCII (Motorola 68030 CPU),
&gt; but before I choose an upgrade I thought I would ask if anyone in this
&gt; group knows if linux has been ported to this machine?

I could very well be wrong here, but I don't think there is a Mac
680x0 port due to lack of docs on the hardware.

&gt; How much memory and disk space is recommended for a full installation.

8MB is the minimum memory needed generally, but the more you have the
faster it runs.  500MB or so of disk is probably needed for a full
install, but I don't know of anyone who needs a full install.  Of
course add on space for other applications, space for data, etc, and
you can easily use 1 or 2 GB.

&gt; As I'm contemplating an upgrade or new machine, what would you
&gt;  recommended (x86? Pentium? MMX? PowerPC??? (Apple)).

One of those big fast Digital Alpha's would be nice, but what to get
really depends on your applications, your need for speed, and your
money supply.

&gt; Does one need to have extensive unix system management expertise to set
&gt; up and maintain such a system?

No.  You just learn what you need as you go along, and if you have
troubles, we're here :).

&gt; What other software/compilers are recommended/needed to complete the
&gt; system. (I'm interested in developing some Tcl/Tk/Tix applications which
&gt; may require C or C++ compiler).

Tcl, Tk, Tix, C, and C++ should all come with any decent Linux
distribution.

Regards,
