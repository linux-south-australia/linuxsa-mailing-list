I have put forward an Iolan Plus at $1400 second hand!  The features of
this can be found at <A HREF="http://www.chaser.co.uk/iolanpl.htm">http://www.chaser.co.uk/iolanpl.htm</A>

This is a 16 port terminal/communications server with lots of
features......  The desktop type not the rack mount.  All ports are
capable of 115K and handle PPP, CSLIP, SLIP and multiple terminal
sessions.  Take a look at the speal on the www page to see what it can do.

If these gentlemen don't want it then I gess I will just put it back in
the draw.

	Regards Steven Ellison

PS You would be lucky to get a 16 port multi-serial card for that!

&gt;        Hi ppls,
&gt; 
&gt; Not such a strange place to put up this question. From how I read the question, 
&gt; Phil is looking for a cheap alternative to a $3k + terminal server from 
&gt; Livingston/Cisco/Xylogics
&gt; The way we did this at the last ISP I worked at was to use a Linux box with and 
&gt; intelligent multi-port serial card. This will give you the flexibility of using 
&gt; a lower power host to run Linux and more serial ports. If your looking for only 
&gt; upto 8 serial ports, then for about $100 you used to be able to get a four port 
&gt; 16550 serial card from Dick Smith, with each serial port able to have interupts 
&gt; of 2,5,7,10,11,12,15 (2 and 9 being the same) so with the two serial ports on 
&gt; most later mainboards, you can hunt around for a cheap 2 port serial card to 
&gt; give you COM3/4 on the usual I/O addresses.
&gt; I don't know if Dick Smith still sell these cards.
&gt; 
&gt; Going for a multiport intelligent cards is more costly but still cheaper than a 
&gt; terminal server from one of the majors. It's not exactly a turnkey solution but 
&gt; it give you far more flexibility. Check out a Linux Journal for multiport serial
&gt; solutions such as Stallion, Paradox (Moxa), Gtek, or RocketPort.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps you out.

&gt; &gt; Can anyone suggest a cheap way of getting an dial-up access server
&gt; &gt; going?  I'm after some box like the Livingston or Cisco servers, but 
&gt; &gt; I'm on a tight budget.  Something with about 8 lines would be fine, 
&gt;  &gt; and it would be OK if it only handled connection speeds of up to
&gt; &gt; 33.6K (although support for 56K would be better).
&gt;      
&gt; Strange place to post it but ....
&gt;      
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt;      
&gt; The access servers have just come out really (ish). The only other thing 
&gt; you could use is a 2511 from Cisco, they support 16 async lines. Second 
&gt; hand cost about $3000 but you still need modems and will not support 56k.
&gt;      
&gt; If you are really tight for a budget we have heaps of Cyclades multiport serial 
&gt; cards that work great with Linux (proven!). We have 8,16 and 32 port cards going
&gt; real cheap - just email me.
