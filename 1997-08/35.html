&gt; &gt;&gt; A colleague of mine has lost a file in his hard drive ( under

&gt; &gt;&gt; system works.... Is this true?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In the past there has been no 'undelete' for *nix systems because they are
&gt; &gt;multiuser/multitasking.
&gt; This is not really a good reason for it.
&gt; Novell servers are multiuser/multitasking and not only do they have
&gt; undelete
&gt; but its multi-version undelete.

To have a multi-version undelete I think you would need to have a
journeling filesystem, which ext2 isn't. For the moment if you need
something like 'undelete' there is a replacement for 'rm' that will just
move the file to a 'trash' directory. Like delete sentry(?) on dos.

&gt; &gt; Normally the space that is freed by deleting a
&gt; &gt;file is assigned to some other file pretty quickly. However if you have a
&gt; &gt;good knowledge of the filesystem structure you can recover some or even
&gt; &gt;all of the data, provided it hasn't been reused. 
&gt; It would have to be some really expensive data to justify someone
&gt; sitting
&gt; there splicing all the loose sectors together.

True, but if it was some really important data then there should be
backups :). I have read that Linus Torvalds had to reconstruct his
filesystem containing the latest work on the kernel 'cause it got trashed,
but that was a fair while ago.

Mark
