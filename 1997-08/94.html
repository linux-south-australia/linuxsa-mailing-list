G'day. Just for a laugh I decided to load Linux, Win95 and OS/2 onto my 
system and see how, or if, it would work. The plan was as follows:

Hard Disk 1
OS/2 boot manager
Win95
Linux
Linux Swap

Hard Disk 2
OS/2

I used OS/2 to set up all the partitions on both drives, installed OS/2 on 
the second drive and rebooted. It worked. Next step, install Linux. At the 
fdisk stage of Linux I jumped straight in and changed the partition types of 
partition 3 and 4 to Linux native and Linux swap, after all I new what I was 
doing, right? Well, after I rebooted, no operating systems were found!! Back 
to square one. I then repeated the previous step but this time I displayed 
the partition information using Linkups fdisk, and guess what, the 
partitions where backwards!! In OS/2 they showed as above, in Linux they 
showed as follows:

Hard Disk 1
Linux swap
Linux native
Win95
OS/2 boot manager

So I thought, well, Linux knows what its doing, and I changed the types of 
partitions 1 and 2, rebooted and away it went. The rest of the Linux install 
went fine as usual. The win95 install went smooth. Naturally it made itself 
the bootable OS. After fdisking and making OS/2 boot manager active I was 
back in business. When lilo-ing Linux I used the option to install lilo on 
the root sector for Linux and the OS/2 boot manager picked it up all right. 
Three operating systems all off the one boot manager. Hopefully my 
experience is of help to some others who try this out - make sure you allow 
plenty of time!!

Regards, Alan
