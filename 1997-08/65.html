&gt; &gt; Anyway, I've had two crashes since I upgraded. Does anyone know where the

&gt; I have been running 2.0.30 since it came out and haven't had any problems. 
&gt; General consensus is 2.0.29 is 'quite stable' so if you want to downgrade
&gt; you should probably go to that. Both the buffer and then networking code
&gt; are reported to have problems. Some people have also experienced memory
&gt; leaks with 2.0.30 and have had to shutdown and reboot after uptimes of
&gt; several weeks. The transparent proxy support is broken in 2.0.30 as well.
&gt; I think most of the major problems have been fixed with pre-2.0.31-3.
&gt; 2.0.31 should be released "real soon now(tm)". Linus is taking extra care
&gt; so this kernel should be the last v2.0.

Musta been that damn SCSI drive:

 10:11pm  up 6 days,  5:24,  8 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.14, 0.10     

My SO wants to use MS Word tomorrow - there goes the uptime :(
