Dear Colleagues,

I guess that I started this... so perhaps I should add my comments...

I was raised in the school that says.. "If you do not back up your 
work regularly then you should be resigned to the fact that you 
*will* ( with probability of one! ) lose some valuable work one 
day!! "        :-(

This is, of course, what I told my friend.

Yours &c..

A^2

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A colleague of mine has lost a file in his hard drive ( under 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Slackware 2.0 ) ... I fear the worst.... In my experience there is no 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; "Norton's Unerase" for LINUX... because of the way in which the file 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; system works.... Is this true?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;In the past there has been no 'undelete' for *nix systems because they are
&gt; &gt; &gt;multiuser/multitasking.
&gt; &gt; This is not really a good reason for it.
&gt; &gt; Novell servers are multiuser/multitasking and not only do they have
&gt; &gt; undelete
&gt; &gt; but its multi-version undelete.
&gt; 
&gt; To have a multi-version undelete I think you would need to have a
&gt; journeling filesystem, which ext2 isn't. For the moment if you need
&gt; something like 'undelete' there is a replacement for 'rm' that will just
&gt; move the file to a 'trash' directory. Like delete sentry(?) on dos.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Normally the space that is freed by deleting a
&gt; &gt; &gt;file is assigned to some other file pretty quickly. However if you have a
&gt; &gt; &gt;good knowledge of the filesystem structure you can recover some or even
&gt; &gt; &gt;all of the data, provided it hasn't been reused. 
&gt; &gt; It would have to be some really expensive data to justify someone
&gt; &gt; sitting
&gt; &gt; there splicing all the loose sectors together.
&gt; 
&gt; True, but if it was some really important data then there should be
&gt; backups :). I have read that Linus Torvalds had to reconstruct his
&gt; filesystem containing the latest work on the kernel 'cause it got trashed,
&gt; but that was a fair while ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Mark
