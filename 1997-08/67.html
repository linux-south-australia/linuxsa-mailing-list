&gt; While trying to compile in sound into my kernel
&gt; I used rpm to install a package kernel-2.0.27.src.rpm which
&gt; looked like it reinstalled a kernel over an already beautifully configured
&gt; one.

OK, you have installed the kernel SOURCE rpm and got a few things a 
little confused :)  First up, this is the source and hence you 
(should) have not altered your actual kernel binary, e.g. usually 
/vmlinuz on Redhat systems.  Hence, it is safe to turn the machine 
off.. 8^)

 
&gt; In the mean time I have deleted my '/usr/src/linux-2.0.27.

Looks like you have basically deleted the package by hand as it 
basically (correct me people if I'm wrong) installs the kernel source 
in this directory.

&gt; I would like to know...
&gt; 1.  From my Redhat4.1
&gt;      Why when I install 'kernel-source' it still doesn't
&gt;      install the sound properly, and hence refuse to
&gt;      even 'make xconfig'

Once again, you installed the kernel-SOURCE then deleted it again, 
can't compile what ain't there! :)  Perhaps reinstall the kernel-2.0.27.src.rpm
and the have another go at configuring/compiling etc.  Because you 
deleted the contents by hand you may need to install the rpm with 
--force if it refuses.

&gt; 2.  What do I have to do to install sound (same question?)

Compile an installed kernel source :)

&gt;    
&gt; Yours (somewhat eagerly)

Hehehe

Best of luck,

Chris
