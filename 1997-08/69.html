&gt;Jobs, Satan announce deal
&gt;
&gt;"The era of competition between good and evil is over," Steve Jobs told
&gt;a keynote audience at MacWorld Expo today.  "We have to let go of the
&gt;notion that for good to triumph, evil must perish."
&gt;
&gt;In a presentation that had been anxiously awaited by the Mac community,
&gt;Jobs announced a historic deal between Apple Computer and Beelzebub,
&gt;Lord of Darkness and Supreme Ruler of the Empire of Evil.
&gt;
&gt;During his short speech to a stunned crowd, Jobs said that Satan will be
&gt;purchasing $150M worth of Apple staff's souls, at the current market
&gt;price.  "I have Lucifer's word that he will not use his control over
&gt;these souls to influence the direction we take in any way."  Furthermore,
&gt;said Jobs, the Devil will not be able to cash in any of the immortal
&gt;souls for three whole years.
&gt;
&gt;The Antichrist then addressed the room via a live link from the Pits
&gt;of Hell, and said that the Empire of Evil is committed to developing
&gt;major pestilences for the Mac platform -- including Office 98 -- for at
&gt;least the next five years.  A collaboration on destroying the Sun is
&gt;also part of the deal with the Lord of Darkness.
&gt;
&gt;Jobs said that Mac users should be grateful for the happiness that
&gt;an honest, widely-respected and much-loved organization like The Eternal
&gt;Pit of Torment will bring to the Mac community.
&gt;
&gt;In the wake of the announcement, Apple's stock lept 30 pieces of silver
&gt;over the previous day's high.
