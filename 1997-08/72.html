&gt; &gt;Unfortunately I have been put in a position where I am virtually forced to
&gt; &gt;install win95 on my machine so I can test some portable software. I have
&gt; &gt;heard that there were/are problems getting win95 to work with Linux
&gt; &gt;because win95 does whatever it feels like with the partition table. In
&gt; &gt;particular, is there anything to watch out for with lilo and win95?
&gt; &gt;Ideally I would like to have lilo on the MBR and let it boot both Linux
&gt; &gt;and win95. Will win95 boot from lilo-0.19 or 0.20?
&gt; 
&gt; I have had Win95 (the original VFAT version) and a smattering of
&gt; different Linux distributions/versions on my machine.  The version of
&gt; Lilo I have now is 0.19.   I haven't had any trouble at all apart from
&gt; some CMOS strangeness since installing Linux on my second IDE. 

&gt; Win95 or Linux have never damaged either of my partitions although I
&gt; installed Linux afer Win95.  I believe that Win95's install will
&gt; assimilate your MBR (read destroy).  If you haven't made a boot disk
&gt; with 'make zdisk', now might be a good time.  Also worth noting that I
&gt; have repeatedly written to and copied from my win95 partitions using
&gt; linux and my file system hasn't complained at all.  I have no
&gt; knowledge of the later FAT32 versions of Win95 though.

I have installed win95 now after much pain. You would think that with all
the millions that ms poured into it, the install would be something less
than infuriating. Anyway, it seems my only concern is no longer true. Lilo
and win95 get along quite nicely. I have also installed the fat32/joilet
patches and they seem to work pretty well, at least I have had no problems
yet. 

Regards,
Mark
