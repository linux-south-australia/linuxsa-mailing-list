&gt; I'm getting very tired of rebooting to run my word processor and the
&gt; occasional windows application.  The Star Office suite whilst very nice
&gt; just isn't quite what I'd like to use all the time.  Does anyone have
&gt; any experience with the above mentioned windows emulator.  

I don't personally, but there is a review of it in the June 1997 Linux
Journal.  BTW, have you had a look at Applixware?

&gt;  - Will it run Word 6 and Excel 5 OK or even any generic windows
&gt; program?

Word 6 and Excel 5 will run.  There are about 30 other apps that have
been certified to run under WABI.  Most other 16-bit applications will
run, but they are not supported.

&gt;  -What about 8 bit color, will I have to give up After Step?

WABI only runs under 8 bit colour.  The other thing that put me off
WABI (apart from the cost) is that its windows are always on the
screen; the virtual desktop function of your favourite window manager
won't work for WABI.

&gt;  -And is there a local Caldera reseller? 

Have you checked the Caldera web site?

Also, has anyone tried out Twin from Willows ("Software Tools and
Services Enabling your Windows Applications to Run on UNIX, Macintosh
and Other Systems")?
