&gt; I have just installed RH 7.2 and I was disappointed. The install
&gt; interface was just not up to the standard of the Mandrake 8.1.

I havn't installed RH7.2, but I have tried 7.1 (as well as MDK8.1), and I
agree.

I have my computer with Win2k on NTFS on hda1. hda5 and hda6 are general
purpose VFAT partitions. hdb1 is WinME and hdc1 is linux, hdc5 is linux
swap.

I installed RedHat 7.1 and when it got upto LILO config, it put "linux" on
hdc1 (correct) and "dos" on hda5 (wrong) and didn't give me Win2k. I was
doing a network install, so I don't know if the graphical install somehow
has a better LILO config generator (i doubt it).

Mandrake 8.1's LILO default config gave me "NT" on hda1 (correct), linux on
hdc1 (correct) and I think (can't really remember) it put "dos" on hdb1
(correct, although I don't think it did the map-drives).

Little things like this really make the Mandrake installer that much better.
I'm happy with my computer at the moment as well, so I won't be trying to
install RH7.2 to see if it's fixed these problems.

Network installs are the strange thing too (i only do network installs. i
can't remember the last time I installed from a CD). RedHat is aimed at
servers as well as desktops and the network install does not use X (which is
fair enough). Mandrake's network install still does X, so the second stage
install is about 100 meg i think, so it takes a while to even start the
network install (luckily I had the ISO on a local network machine). Mandrake
seems to be targeting desktops though, so i don't see this as a big problem.
