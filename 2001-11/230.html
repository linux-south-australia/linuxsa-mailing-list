Wayne, 

We have been using Planet (www.planet.com.tw) Wireless Equipment here in Laos.
They also sell pci and pcmcia cards.

The WAP-1900 or WAP-1950 would fit your bill... Unfortunately, I don't not
have the retail prices. They are external units that plug into your
hub/switch.

We have been using two WAP-1000 (now superceded) for more than 15 months
without a problem. We had an external  power supply die but that is due to the
poorly regulated electricity grid. 

The only thing that I don't know is if they can be used in Australia. The
frequency range at 2.4Hz allows them to be used in just about every other
country see below.

N. America/FCC: 2412~2.462 GHz (11 channels )
Europe CE/ETSI: 2.412~2.472 GHz (13 channels)
Japan: 2.412~2.484 GHz (14 channels)
France: 2.457~2.472 GHz (4 channels)
Spain: 2.457~2.462 GHz (2 channels)

Please feel free to contact me off the list for further questions.

Note: we are not affiliated with the above company but we are a distrubutor
for their entire range.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I am intending to add a wireless access point to my home network, but I am
&gt; having trouble finding
&gt; a range of products and comparisons.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want the cheapest and nastiest, but at the same time, being for
&gt; home use, I don't want to spend
&gt; big dollars. It must be 802.11 compliant, have drivers for Windows 98,2000
&gt; and also linux. The range would
&gt; need to be a minimum of 30 meters, which is through the house from one end
&gt; to the other.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be after at least one PCI card for my desktop machine, and also one
&gt; for my laptop being a pcmcia slot.
&gt; I don't really like the idea of using the USB devices for the desktops.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone recommend a product that they use and are satisfied with ?
&gt; 
&gt; If there are any retailers who would like to send me details of products
&gt; and prices of the list, please do so.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention, that I will be plugging this device
&gt; into my hub, and don't need connectors
&gt; for modem's etc on the back of the Access Point.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Wayne
