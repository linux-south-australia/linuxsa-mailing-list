should i have asked that before the cavity search or after ? ;) ;)

&gt; If you're an ISP, you're a Carriage Service Provider according to
&gt; the Telecommunications Act.  That means you have privacy obligations
&gt; to your customers which even the police can't breach without the
&gt; appropriate paperwork signed by a high-ranking member of the force.
&gt; (otherwise known as a section 282 declaration).

yes, we got a warrant a few months ago (prompted by one of our users
posting something on usenet). we weren't able to find out who it was. we
were told to put something in place- hence the program.

actually mark, to tell you the truth... i couldn't give a shit about the
politics ;). i'm out classed here. i was just told to do it.. so i did.
 .. i'm much more interested in the coding side. it was fun to write !
;).

anyway, if anybody wants it, it's there ;). enjoy.
