yep, that's right.
don't bother about the red and orange stuff,
in the network config page just choose the first option of green.

&gt; I'm not sure why you are having so much trouble. THe default installation is
&gt; a breeze as long as you get communication happening from the SMoothwall NIC
&gt; to your other PCs NIC. If youve been manually trying to reconfigure various
&gt; stuff I would seriously think about starting the Smoothwall install again.
&gt; The whole process only takes 15 minutes from start to finish.

well it took me longer than that, but I added some port forwarding
and changed squid to use port 8080 rather than their default of 800
(which was a slight bastard as it kept restoring the previous config
on me).

Does smoothwall have the option to add other bits?  like I would like
to run an MTA on the box as well to receive and forward email onto
another box as that's better than just port forwarding smtp.
And how about more fine grained control over the modem redialing?
(I had a script before this that not only limited number of redials
but also the max number within a certain period and the like).

Dave.
