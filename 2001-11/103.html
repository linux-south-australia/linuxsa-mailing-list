 &gt; Hi all, with the arrival of "Junior" in the family I'm looking at capturing 
 &gt; those 'treasured moments' forever on video, and was wondering if others are 
 &gt; doing so with open-source.  So:
 &gt; 1) Anyone out there doing Digital Video editting with open-source?

There's broadcast2000, which was published under the GPL.  Its 
publisher withdrew it for reasons I didn't quite understand a few
months ago, but because it was GPL'ed I have a fairly strong belief
in the idea that it's still legal to distribute pre-withdrawn versions.

And, as luck would have it, I have a copy of the source here :-)

There's also a commercial product from a German company which is very
good, MainActor at www.mainactor.com.  A full-featured downloadable 
demo is available (does everything the full version does, but watermarks
all output by splatting "MainActor" over the top of it).  A license
costs US$99.

 &gt; 2) Anyone with digital camera recommendations?

I have a Sony DCRTVR17.  MiniDV format, USB and firewire (IEEE-1394)
connections, S/Video and Composite inputs and outputs, Carl Zeiss lens
(which does make a small but perceptible difference, IMHO), and memory
stick socket (comes with a 4 Mbyte memory stick).  

You don't need to buy a separate memory stick reader;  you can access
the memory stick port by plugging the camera into a USB interface and 
mounting it as a DOS filesystem.

The camera knows how to dump up to 45 seconds of MPEG-II audio/video
to the memory stick in two resolutions (320 x 240 gives you 15 seconds,
160 x 120 gives you 45 seconds).  I think the time limitations are due
to the camera attempting to buffer the entire MPEG in RAM before writing
it to the memory stick, so you don't get longer-duration video grabs
by putting bigger memory sticks in.  See the "What I do on my weekends"
links near the bottom of <A HREF="http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/">http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/</A> to see the results
of using the memory stick (and excuse the dodgy photography - I'd only 
had the camera for a week when I did that stuff!).

The camera also does digital stills (to the memory stick of course).  You
can also do Chromakey and Chromaluma effects on videotape by using images
on the memory stick as a base, and you can also copy memorystick media 
files to videotape (useful for sending your digital photos to grandma, 
who doesn't own a computer but is au-fait with videocassettes).

Note that you can get full-resolution 24 fps MPEG-II out of the firewire
port as well.  I haven't used that one myself yet (due to inertia more
than anything else - There are FreeBSD beta IEEE-1394 drivers, and the
Linux ones have been in production for quite a while), but someone else
I know with the same camera tells me it gives you very high quality MPEG
at the rate of about 400 Mbytes per minute :-)

... and MainActor understands the Linux IEEE-1394 drivers too, so you 
don't need any extra software to suck video out of the camera into your
non-linear editing software.

If you're buying one, go for a walk up and down Rundle Street.  There
are three dealers within 2 minutes walk of each other, and I found that
they will happily beat (not just match) each others' prices.  I went 
through about three iterations of that before I found the price I wanted
(and, I suppose, before they got sick of me and stopped playing the 
game :-)

 &gt; 3) Anyone accessing Sony's memory stick with open-source?

Works fine with the umass driver under FreeBSD :-)
