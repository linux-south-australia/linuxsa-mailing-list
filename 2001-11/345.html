DO IT!!!!!!!!

I suggest you forward it through sa-auug - this has already been 
discussed in that group.

Bandwidth supply should also be an issue - what if the government can 
provide some incentive / reason for Hellstra to loosen their iron grip 
on our national bandwidth supply so we can have more than their &lt;quote - 
ha ha&gt;  'whopping 400Mb' allowance on their broadband connection!  I 
could not believe this when I saw the ad - I still suspect it was a joke 
- especially as they were suggesting that the 'whopping' 400Mb could be 
used to download movies in a flash, etc.

The problem with Unix / Linux however - is there is NO unified voice - 
just a bunch of disparate (although highly intelligent and creative) 
people who can't even agree on correct email format or the best text 
editor let alone a unified approach to lobbying government.

Richard - your idea speaks volumes of your foresight and leadership 
qualities.

I suggest we work out a multi-pronged approach - target the minister, 
media and anything else we can find - with a unified consistent and well 
researched message.

I am happy to speak publically and be interviewed unless someone is more 
  keen than I am or disagrees with my thoughts.  I would never speak on 
behalf of the Linux 'community' without prior consent.

&gt; 
&gt; Actually, the article tips Abbott... Whoever it turns out to be, it
&gt; wouldn't hurt to write some sort of letter from LinuxSA, signed by as
&gt; many as can sign it, informing the minister of concerns about
&gt; government policy that closes out open source solutions for govt
&gt; contracts, as well as open source clients with govt services...
&gt; 
&gt; I could write such a letter (short, 1/2 a page or so) if anyone thinks
&gt; it's worthwhile... and I would suggest that I send it to the list, and
&gt; anyone who wants to can reply offlist to me, and I'll add your names
&gt; to the list of names on it... yah?
