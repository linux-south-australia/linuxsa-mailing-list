&lt;WARNING&gt; Political Content. &lt;/WARNING&gt;

Hi.

Ok, Aristotle, so have the Democrats promised to not sell out their
electorate again, and do you believe them?

Being scoffed at because of your interest in linux at work, tells us more
about the attitudes at your workplace than the future of linux. I have to
say that at the present time, I rarely meet anyone who hasn't at least
heard of it. Some people react with 'You running linux? - cool'

The pollies will adopt the linux bandwagon when there is enough votes in
it. That hasn't happened yet.

&gt; 
&gt; It is this exact kind of attitude that is moving Linux and Unix closer 
&gt; to irrelevancy each day.  At work - I am scoffed at the mention of 
&gt; anything not Windows - and this is a major corporation I am talking about.
&gt; 
&gt; Get real - think about it.  If people want Linux to remain (like 
&gt; Macintosh) relegated to a small group of zealous fans or specialised 
&gt; applications, then so be it.  If we want Linux to be anything more than 
&gt; an interesting toy for us geeks, then we need to look at the real world.
&gt; 
&gt; Anything that is important to the future of Linux, is very relevant 
&gt; indeed - get over it.

That _WOULD_ have been a good idea, Mark, but it was too late by the time
you sent it.
