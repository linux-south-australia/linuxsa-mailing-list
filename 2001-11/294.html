Toby,

So far I have had no problem with my XP/RH71. dual boot system. I have not
used GRUB, but you should have no problem. The XP bootloader looks as though
it is the normal trashy NT/2000 bootloader, so there should be no problem. 

I can still map my SAMBA shares and get my DHCP stuff from my Linux Server.
I haven't tried to mount XP partitions from Linux, so I can't help you there
and my PC's are at home so I can't test it now.

Perhaps the only thing that you have to think about is whether to put NTFS
or FAT32 as your XP file system.

Subject: WinXP Pro && Linux 2.4


Hi,

I currently dualboot my desktop system at home between 98lite for games and
Mandrake 8.1 for serious stuff. (Although Uplink (www.introversion.co.uk)
runs on Linux :)

However, I'm considering upgrading windoze to XP pro, for a variety of
reasons.. the main one being that the current 98lite install has reached
that stage where its slow and icky and needs a delete/re-install process.
(i say upgrade, but mean delete-windows-first, not upgrade-over-the-top,
which is just asking for trouble)

Has anyone here tried installing winXP onto their dual boot machine, and had
any issues I should know about, to-do with Linux?

I suspect it'll trash my grub bootloader, but I know how to reinstall that
and have a bootCD handy.
I presume it won't be too hard to make grub boot the XP partition? I hope?

Anything else? Will it still login to samba shares on my server ok? Will my
*nix boxes still be able to mount winxp shares?

tia,

Toby
