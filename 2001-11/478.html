Hi all,

I have a KMail issue with a client of mine. It's version 1.0.29, which
I suspect is rather dated (they have no net connectivity, and I'm not
there much, so updating isn't trivial...)

The problem is that it seems to be "remembering" incorrect RCPT
strings. A couple of days ago, the user entered "jfj" instead of "jj"
in the To: field of an email. When she tried to send, it (correctly)
came back with an SMTP error, saying that the recipient was unknown (I
think it was a 510 error). However, after this, every time she tried
to send mail, no matter what was in the To: field, it complained that
jfj was unknown. She could reply to email that she already had
though... Just not send new emails.

At some stage, and I'm not sure how this happened (it could have been
after a reboot), the error changed to 500, complaining that there was
no RCPT specified, again, ignoring what was in the To: field. And
later, it changed to 503, with some other error.

None of this made any sense to me, as KMail was working OK previously,
and as far as I knew, nothing had changed. Other people's KMail
clients, which I presume are the same version, still work... So I'm
kinda confused...

Does anyone have any idea where to start with this? I'm not familiar
with KMail at all (nor KDE), and I don't know where to start looking.
If it helps, the network setup (DNS, mail server, etc) is kinda
unusual there, but again, I don't think this changed...
