Hi.

My understanding is that the authors of broadcast2000 realised that the
software was being used in some big name video editing houses and got
scared that there was a potential liability that they could not afford to
fight if something was found horribly lacking with the software.

It's a David and Goliath story where Goliath wins. A big studio with a
fighting fund could make a mess of them. I guess you can't blame the
authors, but it is a pity for the rest of us. You have to wonder what sort
of moronic lawyers would go after the authors of GPL code where there is
no representation of fit-for-purpose, and no consideration in the
contract.

If you have a look, the source is on the PCWorld linux minibook cd's.

&gt;  &gt; Hi all, with the arrival of "Junior" in the family I'm looking at capturing 
&gt;  &gt; those 'treasured moments' forever on video, and was wondering if others are 
&gt;  &gt; doing so with open-source.  So:
&gt;  &gt; 1) Anyone out there doing Digital Video editting with open-source?
&gt; 
&gt; There's broadcast2000, which was published under the GPL.  Its 
&gt; publisher withdrew it for reasons I didn't quite understand a few
&gt; months ago, but because it was GPL'ed I have a fairly strong belief
&gt; in the idea that it's still legal to distribute pre-withdrawn versions.
&gt; 
&gt; And, as luck would have it, I have a copy of the source here :-)
