Subject: [OT] dodo.com - any comments?


&gt; Like many others we got an insert in our paper talking about a
newcomer
&gt; to the ISP scene -dodo.com - and their offer of a $9.90 dial-up
account.

I was talking to a friend who owns a computer store yesterday, and he
had just signed up with Dodo.  The plan he's on is an "unlimited" plan
for about 70 .. 80 $ per quarter.  He's only been with them two days, so
it's a little premature to make any conclusions, but he says they've
been very good so far.

My favorite dial-up ISP is currently Dingo Blue.  They were quite mean
and lowered their dial-up capacity in many rural areas and in some
cities (Adelaide included, I am told), so I had almost constant busy
signals for over two weeks, but the situation has improved since.

Where will your community project be based?  If it is in a country area,
very few ISPs offer local call access, however I think BigPond and Dodo
both offer local call access to most (or all) of Australia.

Another very important consideration is whether the plan/contract is
appropraite.  Note than many "unlimited' plans have a maximum hour use
or maximum download limit (or are bound by terms and conditions or an
acceptable use policy).  You should determine what your likely needs
are.

ISPs are always a contentious issue.

I wish I had ADSL!  (Well, sort of.)
