&gt; Did you enquire about whether it was legal for them to ask you to do
&gt; something like that?

But CSPs are required to have an interception capability plan
that will be used after recieving a S282 notice.  innuendod
could be part of that plan.

Divulging information collected by innuendod without a S282
notice breaches S276 (max 2 year years imprisonment, no fine
option).

You must also make reasonable attempts to protect the
privacy of communications from hackers.  So running
innuendod into a log file without a S282 notice is not
wise.

Best tactic would be to modify innuedod to run all the
time but log nothing.  Have it listen to a UNIX socket.
When it recieves a regexp upon that socket, log all
traffic addressed from that regexp into
/var/innuendod/hashed-regexp.log.  You need to hash
the regexp to hide the name of the subject from other
employees.

This allows only the subject of the S282 notice to be
logged, whilst meeting the requirements that the
subject cannot notice the logging due to altered
response time, etc.

The entire log can then be passed to the agency, which
simplifies the chain of evidence for the agency.  Otherwise
you'd have to trim out all material not the subject of the
notice, which messes with the chain of evidence terribly.

Writing software to meet the requiements of an interception
capability plan is a lot harder than it at first appears.

Best wishes,
Glen

PS: Both Mark and I work for telcos, which explains our
    knowledge of the requirements.
