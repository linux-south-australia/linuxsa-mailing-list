&gt;&gt; The only thing that I don't know is if they can be used in Australia. The

&gt;
&gt; 2.4 GHz is also the legal range for .au
&gt;
&gt; One thing to keep in mind, though, is that 802.11b isn't the only
&gt; user of the 2.4 GHz band.  More specifically, there are some brands
&gt; of digital cordless phones which use the same frequency range.
&gt;
&gt; Ideally spread-spectrum applications are supposed to hop around
&gt; each other so that multiple devices can share the same spectrum, but
&gt; in practice this doesn't always work correctly.  I've spoken to a
&gt; couple of people with cordless phones who find that their WaveLAN
&gt; home networks stop working whenever they make a telephone call (!)

I saw a very effective demonstration of this problem at USENIX in
Boston in June.  802.11b doesn't hop, it spreads (i.e. not FHSS but
DSSS).  I think this is basically a problem you can't get around.  I
don't know if FHSS cards do better here, but I have a couple to lend
if anybody wants to try it out.

Note that the AUUG did a member purchase of Orinoco 802.11b cards a
few weeks back.  We'll probably do another one in a few months.  Card
prices look like being well below $200 each.
