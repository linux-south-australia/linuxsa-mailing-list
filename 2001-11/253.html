Hi,

While I managed to learn two things from the article at:
<A HREF="http://www.unixreview.com/documents/s">http://www.unixreview.com/documents/s</A>=1780/urm0111c/0111c.htm, I have
some criticisms of the questions posted in the article.

See what you think.

|Question 1
|You want to allow users to access the CD-RW device on your machine from
|any other host on the network via NFS. Further, you only want them to
|have read-only access to the device. Which line should you add to the
|/etc/exports file to allow this?
|
|a.              /mnt /cdrom *(ro)
|
|b.             /mnt /cdrom *(r)
|
|c.             /mnt /cdrom *
|
|d.             /mnt /cdrom

There is very clearly a space between /mnt and /cdrom. Also, unless the
checks I just did on my RedHat 7.0 system are fundamentally flawed, a,
c, and d all achieve what you want, so the question is ambiguous.

|Question 2
|Which of the following files defines how FTP connection requests are
|processed by the TCP Wrapper?
|
|a.             ftpusers
|
|b.             inetd.conf
|
|c.             ftpaccess
|
|d.             xferlog

I do not think that any of the above files defines *how* FTP connection
requests are handled by tcp wrappers. /etc/inetd.conf on some (many)
Linux systems specifies that tcpd is invoked for incoming FTP requests,
and a couple of other files define *how* they are handled.

|Question 16
|By default, which of the following files would constitute the Apache
|document root?
|
|a.             smb.conf
|
|b.             httpd.conf
|
|c.             apache.conf
|
|d.             index.html

I think that this question is badly worded, because the 'document root'
is the place where HTML documents are placed and is defined in
httpd.conf. Also, I don't think that the supplied answer is correct, either:

|16. B. The default document root under Apache is the
|/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file.

The DocumentRoot definition in my httpd.conf file is:

DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

This question and its answer is just too confusing!

|Question 18
|Which field of the /etc/passwd file holds the passwords for users?
|
|a.             first
|
|b.             second
|
|c.             third
|
|d.             fourth

Passwords are not kept in the /etc/passwd file. At best, password hashes
are kept there. In addition, if /etc/shadow is in use, then password
hashes are not kept in /etc/passwd.
