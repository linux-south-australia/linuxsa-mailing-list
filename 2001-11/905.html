Hi Michael,

I used to be with dingoblue. They are having lots of connection 
problems but hopefully that will be resolved shortly. What annoyed me 
was that their finance accounting system seemed to have a problem with 
the numbers between 0 and 9, they stuffed up so many times that I 
eventually dropped them rather than keep up the frustration of trying 
to get them to listen and correct their errors.

The project, based in Salisbury North (20k north of Adelaide), is 
presently using dingo blue as their ISP. They have 6 accounts and pay 
$25 a month per account. We are looking for a better deal but it would 
need to be quite a bit better than dingo before we would change.

Another thing we are looking for is somebody to host us so we can lock 
in our email addresses even if we change suppliers.

I am seriously looking at ADSL or similar for some of our busier 
connections. There would need to be a good offer made before we commit 
to something like that.

We have researched APANA but still waiting for a detailed offer from 
them.

Thanks for the comments, Ian
