howdy all,

i managed to get ny ntfs-read-supporting-2.4.9-7 kernel to compile and
install properly on redhat 7.2 - my first ever successful kernel
compile! very exciting. anyway. the issue now is, the ntfs support
sucks. i can mount any of my ntfs partitions, but trying to do anything
on them (such as 'ls') will often freeze the computer totally - no
keyboard input accepted at all (or mouse). a hard reset is the only fix
:( it's a tiny bit weird too - 'mount /mnt/c' is fine, 'ls /mnt/c' is
fine, but 'ls /mnt/c/WINNT' crashes the box (reliably). is this just
because ntfs support isn't the best? or is there some other issue
perhaps?

and the second issue of the moment: has anyone got non-redhat kernels
working with ext3? i have little idea about this stuff, but i downloaded
the latest 2.4.14 from kernel.org and unzipped it. doing 'make
menuconfig' revealed no ext3 support under the filesystems menu - so i
stopped. richard sharpe, i remember you saying "after a marathon session
last night, I now have EXT3 and ACLs under 2.4.13 and it all works
well." - what did you have to do to achieve this? i was thinking, maybe
a more recent kernel will have better ntfs support, that might not crash
the box at any attempt to read it.

or, i guess i could try and see if i can convert any non-system drives
to vfat under win2k. fun.

 - Ben
