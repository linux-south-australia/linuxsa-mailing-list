I don't think Outlook2000 (or 98 or 97 or XP or whatever) uses LDAP when i
talkes to the folders it's uses it's propriety talker.

Outlook Express is what i'm using to get LDAP from our exchange server.
This works.
Outlook Express also gets stuff from ldap.bigfoot.com
Outlook Express gets IMAP stuff fine.

Evolution gets nothing from exchange server no matter what i do.
Evolution get stuff from ldap.bigfoot.com (faster than outlook express i
might add)
Evolution gets IMAP from exchange server fine, *BUT* all the folders that i
subscribe to appear as mail folders and i can't figure out how to change the
view.  If i could change the view, yes i would say it's almost useable apart
from no directory.  But obviously if you knew that everyone in your
organization had a standard email address, eg firstinitial
<A HREF="mailto:lastname@dofus.com">lastname@dofus.com</A> you could just mail to them no probs...

Now,  I had a look at freshmeat and searched for LDAP but there are heaps
there.  anyone suggest the best one to use?

Matthew

OK, that seems to indicate that Evolution was linked against the LDAP
libraries.

&gt; changed back to our server and like Andrew said, doesn't seem to try to do
&gt; anything useful.  i think it's a case of Microsoft makes their products
work
&gt; with just their products but when i try anything else, it doesn't work...
&gt; it says linux, just return a pile of &lt;deleted&gt;  that's why their products
&gt; are so bloated it's all the extra garble code to block everyone elses
&gt; products....  useless dorks...

Hrm. Perhaps you should try with a standalone LDAP client. I found a
nice Java one a few months ago, but I can't remember where I put
it. Have a look on <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/">http://freshmeat.net/</A> for some leads on LDAP
clients.

D'you know if Outlook uses LDAP for accessing the contacts database
etc, or its own special protocol?

If Outlook does use LDAP when talking to a local Exchange server, then
we can assumwe that the prototol itself is working, at least to
Microsoft's standards.

IF Outlook doesn't use LDAP when talking to a local Exchange server,
and after multiple failures using different standalone LDAP clients,
perhaps we have to look at Exchange configuration.

&gt; this from Andrew means nothing to me so would you care to explain what it
&gt; does?

'ldd' lists dynamic object dependencies. For examle, Evolution
requires the libgtk, libpng, libgnome and a whole list of others
(about 54 in total).

&gt; i did a man ldd and it shows libraries..  nice.  i'm not sure what i'm
&gt; supposed to be looking for...

I wanted to know wheather or not Evolution had been linked against the
OpenLDAP libraries, in the hope of ascertaining wheather or not
Evolution was compiled with LDAP support.

&gt; I might also add that i didn't try configure evolution, i just installed
the
&gt; ye old .RPM file from ftp.ximian.com or wherever...

Ah, OK. I think the standard Ximian package comes with LDAP support of
some kind.
