I like it - especiall the use of 'while we recognise that ... we also 
need to understand ...' arguments - I think this gets more people on side.

My only concern is the use of technical terms and informal language - 
such as 'virus .. in one hit'.  I suggest we use more formal and more 
non - technical / generic language - such as 'security technologies' or 
Internet 'access technologies' - if we are to 'know our enemy' we must 
recognise that our audience will likely not be technically inclined or 
interested.

I think then if we can de-tech this letter and formalise it more - then 
we can use it as a template for the government, opposition, media, etc - 
and then we can promote a uniform voice on behalf of the 'open source' 
community.

BTW - I have an EXCELLENT article in Foreign Policy on the Internet and 
how it can be likened to 'the commons' in political theory - but that 
corporations and governments are now walling it off.  A good read on the 
Internet and open source from a political / social point of view if 
anyone would like a copy.  It's interesting how often I have seen open 
source and even Linux in particular appear in political and 
philosophical magazines of all pursausions - I don't think we realise 
just how much history we could be making if we get our act together and 
speak with one voice - and how much danger we are in of sinking in to 
irrelevance - or becoming relevant only to us die-hard fans - a bit like 
Macintosh really.  Good product - sweet FA marketing or lobying.

&gt; -----------
&gt; Dear &lt;Minister for IT and/or Telecommunications&gt; [this may need to be
&gt; two separate letters addressing the two separate issues that we are
&gt; concerned about, depending on the "significantly different ministry"
&gt; John Howard's been touting],
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, congratulations on your winning of Government and subsequent
&gt; appointment as Minister for IT and/or Telecommunications.
&gt; 
&gt; We are IT employees, employers, students, hobbyists, academics,
&gt; programmers, systems administrators and users who share a common
&gt; interest in Open Source and Free Software. We choose to use this
&gt; software in preference to commercial offerings for many reasons,
&gt; including cost, quality and (most importantly) freedom. It frees us
&gt; from the confines of restrictive (and expensive) software licencing
&gt; agreements, and allows us to modify and improve the software we use as
&gt; we see fit, thereby benefiting thousands of other users, while we
&gt; benefit from their modifications.
&gt; 
&gt; However, we are concerned about the some of the directions that the
&gt; Government's IT policies have taken in recent years. Three major areas
&gt; of concern are:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) That access to Government online services is restricted to users of
&gt; commercial software such as Microsoft Windows with Internet Explorer.
&gt; We often find that Government sites block users of other operating
&gt; systems or browsers, or that the sites are customised to use special
&gt; features of specific browsers, and are unusable unless that browser is
&gt; used.
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of blocked sites:
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of sites that don't work correctly on all (most?) browsers:
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all online services
&gt; are accessible to users no matter what their choice of operating
&gt; system or browser. This allows more people to use Government services,
&gt; and it encourages competition in the software marketplace.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) That major Government IT contracts are often exclusive, to the
&gt; detriment of competition. This includes moves such as standardising on
&gt; Microsoft Office software throughout Government departments, with no
&gt; possibility for variance, even where a better solution for a specific
&gt; problem exists.
&gt; 
&gt; Examples:
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all contracts are
&gt; designed to foster competition, and encourage the best solution for
&gt; the problem at hand to be used, as opposed to requiring a single
&gt; solution for all classes of problems. Diversity should be encouraged
&gt; in Government IT, for the dual purposes of fostering competition and
&gt; developing a more resiliant infrastructure -- it is an accepted fact
&gt; that while uniformity can bring some cost advantages, it accentuates
&gt; any weaknesses to the point where a single weakness can allow one
&gt; virus to cause so much damage in one hit.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) That Government software projects themselves are usually closed
&gt; source. We believe that by encouraging the release of source code for
&gt; Government-sponsored projects, not only will the community benefit
&gt; from the use of this code, but the Government will benefit from the
&gt; community's use of this code. This applies specifically in cases where
&gt; the code being developed can have some wider application, but even in
&gt; cases where it won't, there is no disadvantage in releasing the code.
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all new (and
&gt; preferably old) software projects undertaken by the Government have
&gt; their code released to the community under an open licence (GPL or
&gt; BSD). This is a situation where the collaboration between Government,
&gt; community, and even other Governments would result in a win-win-win
&gt; situation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou,
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely....
&gt; 
&gt; ----------
&gt; 
&gt; hmmm... that was longer than I meant, and may not be easily read by
&gt; politician types... also, I didn't touch on telecommunications issues
&gt; -- I think that should be separate anyway, as we could easily get far
&gt; broader support for that one...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, IMHO, the above are the three main Open Source related IT
&gt; issues facing government... anyone care to comment?
