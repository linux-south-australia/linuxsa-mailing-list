Ive seen kernel panic with ghost 6 and ext 2 with later redhats. The
problem was ghost 6.03 didnt support the disklabeling, which redhat use
to locate the root partition. Workaround was boot with a rescue cd and
use e2label to label the partitions. You may be hitting this problem.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If I understand it correctly, ext3 is just ext2 with an added file
&gt; &gt;&gt; containing journaling information.  If this assumption is 
&gt; &gt;correct, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; filesystem is identical to ext2, and should be supported by 
&gt; &gt;any program
&gt; &gt;&gt; that supports ext2.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I would do a little research on ext3 to confirm this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm not sure if this is correct but it's not required.  You can
&gt; &gt;convert between EXT2 and EXT3 with a simple tune2fs command which
&gt; &gt;takes only a short time to run.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So if it only supports EXT2 then you can simply:
&gt; &gt;1) boot onto a boot cd with tune2fs (RH7.2 has this) and convert the
&gt; &gt;   partitions in question to EXT2
&gt; &gt;3) run your Ghost program in EXT2 mode
&gt; &gt;4) boot onto the boot cd again and run tune2fs to convert back to EXT3 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, seems like ext3 has some sort of overhead that programs like Ghost
&gt; don't recognise as yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I successfully imaged a RH7.2 machine running ext3 on all filesystems, 
&gt; however Ghost (6.5 ent) recognised it as ext2.  When it came to booting
&gt; the imaged PC, our good friend the kernel panicked a little when he 
&gt; couldn't find the ext3 filesystem that it was looking for :o)
&gt; 
&gt; So on the face of it, imaging ext3 with Ghost isn't a plug & play scenario
&gt; yet.  I'd imagine as Michael suggested above, that you could convert to
&gt; ext2 before imaging, obviously you'd need to modify your boot disk and/or 
&gt; startup files to recognize your root partition as ext2.
&gt; 
&gt; Symantec's KB lists ext2 as the only Unix-based filesystem that it supports
&gt; at this stage, this includes v7 of Ghost.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe some of the OSS options might be the go, such as Partimage or similar,
&gt; I'm yet to try these out.
