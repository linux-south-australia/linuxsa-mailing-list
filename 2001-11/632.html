I've seen more detailed descriptions of this upon other lists..

XP definately "phones home" to certain microsoft-owned IPs; I intend to
block these IPs on my gateway box before installing XP. If i install XP,
anyway.

Have a quick web search, u can probably find the info, or else i'll have to
re-find where i put it sometime anyway

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; I loaded XP a couple of days and first impressions where quite good. It
&gt; seemed a lot more stable that 95 98 and NT 4. It is definetly a lot quicker
&gt; at loading programs, and genral browsing of the web, the pages load a lot
&gt; faster. All in all I would consider myself to be a lot happier running XP
&gt; than I have been with 98 or NT 4.
&gt;
&gt; Until ..........
&gt;
&gt; I noticed a couple of hours ago that my machine, with XP, seems to be
&gt; communicating with the web continuously, well regularly I should say. I
&gt; have a linux box with an external modem as my gateway, and this workstation
&gt; connected to it via a small hub. Down the botton right hand corner near the
&gt; clock is the network connection icon which lights up when data is being
&gt; transmitted. As I watch now, it is lighting up for about ten seconds
&gt; sending about 5 - 10 packets per second. I can also hear the hard drive
&gt; heads moving. Looking across the room at the modem, the transmit light is
&gt; almost continuosly on, with the receive flashing on the rare occasion. The
&gt; strange thing is that I haven't used the web browser for about an hour, and
&gt; the e-mail program doesn't automatically check for mail, I don't run icq
&gt; and msn messenger is turned off. So without my consent XP is transmitting
&gt; something, oh yeah, unless it's in the terms and conditions, smart one
&gt; Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt; I disable the Network interface in XP and it stops, of course, when I turn
&gt; it back on again the transmissions start again.
&gt;
&gt; Call me paraniod, but this workstation is sending out something, somewhere
&gt; on the web.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know what's going on with XP other than the usual rumours ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; At the time of writing this, I was made aware that I may have been infected
&gt; with the Nimba virus, I have only used this machine on the web for about 4
&gt; hours. My current virus scanner is Norton 2001, which I have been told
&gt; won't work with XP, apparently I need Norton 2002. For this reason I don't
&gt; have a virus scanner loaded. So much for XP's firewall doing the job.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know the registry keys to look at to verify if it is in fact
&gt; the Nimba virus ?
&gt;
&gt;
