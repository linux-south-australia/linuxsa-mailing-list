&gt; &gt; This "Peak" and "Off-peak" stuff seems like crap. Since when does it
&gt; &gt; cost more to use the Internet at a particular time of the day? I know
&gt; &gt; I don't.
&gt; 
&gt; ISP's buying data by the pipe tend to have enormous unused capacity
&gt; between 12 midnight and 7am, which coincides with the Netspace offpeak
&gt; period. They're being generous enough to make this unused capacity
&gt; available to their ADSL users. I don't see what's crap about that.

Ah, OK. I understand now. I didn't realise that upstreams are willing
to offer "all you can eat" pipes. I was under the impression that
nearly everyone pays by the MB.

&gt; &gt; Netspace also have this nasty little clause at the bottom of their
&gt; &gt; Home ADSL Pricing page[1]. It reads "Minimum contract is for 12 months
&gt; &gt; from activation date".
&gt; 
&gt; What's so nasty about that? The people at Netspace are pretty nice guys,
&gt; they're not out to rip anyone off. Netspace are one of the few remaining
&gt; ISP's that don't have to answer to shareholders, and can let their
&gt; conscience rather than their bank balance make decisions.

It means that you're locked into using their (potentially
dissatisfying) service. Internode don't have that. I like that. If I
change my mind after 3 months, there's no hassle. I just don't get my
ADSL any more.

&gt; &gt; &gt; that is 10gig/month is it??????? for 100$, only downside is no static ip
&gt; &gt; &gt; but oh well?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's $0.01 / MB. I just spoke to Netspace, and according to the guy
&gt; &gt; on the other end of the phone, you're limited to 3GB during their
&gt; &gt; "peak" time and 7GB during "off-peak". That means that you could
&gt; 
&gt; They're not selling data for 1c/mb, they're selling the peak stuff for
&gt; 3c/mb (still pretty cheap..), then letting users have the run of the
&gt; off-peak data along with a limit on that to stop a handful of users
&gt; spoiling it for everyone.

Hrm... I agree, but data is data to the person buying it. It works out 
to be $0.01 / MB looking at it that way.

However, I see what you're saying.
