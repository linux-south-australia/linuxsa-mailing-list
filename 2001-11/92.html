&gt;&gt; If I understand it correctly, ext3 is just ext2 with an added file
&gt;&gt; containing journaling information.  If this assumption is 
&gt;correct, the
&gt;&gt; filesystem is identical to ext2, and should be supported by 
&gt;any program
&gt;&gt; that supports ext2.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I would do a little research on ext3 to confirm this.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure if this is correct but it's not required.  You can
&gt;convert between EXT2 and EXT3 with a simple tune2fs command which
&gt;takes only a short time to run.
&gt;
&gt;So if it only supports EXT2 then you can simply:
&gt;1) boot onto a boot cd with tune2fs (RH7.2 has this) and convert the
&gt;   partitions in question to EXT2
&gt;3) run your Ghost program in EXT2 mode
&gt;4) boot onto the boot cd again and run tune2fs to convert back to EXT3 


Hmmm, seems like ext3 has some sort of overhead that programs like Ghost
don't recognise as yet.

I successfully imaged a RH7.2 machine running ext3 on all filesystems, 
however Ghost (6.5 ent) recognised it as ext2.  When it came to booting
the imaged PC, our good friend the kernel panicked a little when he 
couldn't find the ext3 filesystem that it was looking for :o)

So on the face of it, imaging ext3 with Ghost isn't a plug & play scenario
yet.  I'd imagine as Michael suggested above, that you could convert to
ext2 before imaging, obviously you'd need to modify your boot disk and/or 
startup files to recognize your root partition as ext2.

Symantec's KB lists ext2 as the only Unix-based filesystem that it supports
at this stage, this includes v7 of Ghost.

Maybe some of the OSS options might be the go, such as Partimage or similar,
I'm yet to try these out.
