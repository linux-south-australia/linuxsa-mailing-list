Hi,

XP has a nasty habit of "phoning home" whenever it sees a network connection
active.

If you are using a "less that legitimate" copy of XP, I highly suggest that
you format your drive with a sledge hammer. The only way that I have found
stops this activity is to block the data being sent out on you linux box
using iptables.

You will still get internal traffic happening however you are less likely to
have a Microsoft BlackOps team drop in on you in the middle of the night .

Regards,

Damien

Subject: [OT] Suspect XP transmissions


&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; I loaded XP a couple of days and first impressions where quite good. It
&gt; seemed a lot more stable that 95 98 and NT 4. It is definetly a lot
quicker
&gt; at loading programs, and genral browsing of the web, the pages load a lot
&gt; faster. All in all I would consider myself to be a lot happier running XP
&gt; than I have been with 98 or NT 4.
&gt;
&gt; Until ..........
&gt;
&gt; I noticed a couple of hours ago that my machine, with XP, seems to be
&gt; communicating with the web continuously, well regularly I should say. I
&gt; have a linux box with an external modem as my gateway, and this
workstation
&gt; connected to it via a small hub. Down the botton right hand corner near
the
&gt; clock is the network connection icon which lights up when data is being
&gt; transmitted. As I watch now, it is lighting up for about ten seconds
&gt; sending about 5 - 10 packets per second. I can also hear the hard drive
&gt; heads moving. Looking across the room at the modem, the transmit light is
&gt; almost continuosly on, with the receive flashing on the rare occasion. The
&gt; strange thing is that I haven't used the web browser for about an hour,
and
&gt; the e-mail program doesn't automatically check for mail, I don't run icq
&gt; and msn messenger is turned off. So without my consent XP is transmitting
&gt; something, oh yeah, unless it's in the terms and conditions, smart one
&gt; Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt; I disable the Network interface in XP and it stops, of course, when I turn
&gt; it back on again the transmissions start again.
&gt;
&gt; Call me paraniod, but this workstation is sending out something, somewhere
&gt; on the web.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know what's going on with XP other than the usual rumours ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; At the time of writing this, I was made aware that I may have been
infected
&gt; with the Nimba virus, I have only used this machine on the web for about 4
&gt; hours. My current virus scanner is Norton 2001, which I have been told
&gt; won't work with XP, apparently I need Norton 2002. For this reason I don't
&gt; have a virus scanner loaded. So much for XP's firewall doing the job.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know the registry keys to look at to verify if it is in fact
&gt; the Nimba virus ?
&gt;
&gt;
