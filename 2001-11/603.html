&gt; what did people think of these?

I love mine.

&gt; i went to have a look, they looked nice but too big and tank like.. (Esp
&gt; as i am quite small)

Well, no, not really. I find that it's just the right size to carry my 
laptop, a bunch of cables, a CD player, a bunch of CDs, a floppy drive 
and other miscelanious peripherals, and a pair of shoes. It has nice
squishy padding on the back which makes long walks quite comfortable.

&gt; does anyone have any other options for slim line backpacks with padding?

I've seen some Targus ones, but they were fairly crappy. They were a
bit light on the padding side, and they weren't nearly as sturdy as
the STM bags.

&gt; i am using a mambo one still, with no zip (!) which is slightly worrying
&gt; however the tanks that STM had were not suitable for my slim line! :)

Slim line laptop? I've got a Toshiba Portege which is less than an
inch thick and I've no problems at all with it bouncing
around. There's a velcro strap over the top, a drawstring as well as
straps on the outside of the bag that holds it all together.

&gt; And i wasn't keen on a satchel --&gt; too uncomfortable for long walking?

The Toshiba bag that I had previously was horrible for long walks. A
mate of mine just bought a Powerbook G4 and a $250 laptop-satchel
thing, and that's *really* comfortable.

All things considered, the STM bags are *really* good. They're
comfortable and protect the laptop well. I don't have to worry about
being gentle with it (as much as the Toshiba bag).

Whatsmore, they're only $85. That's pretty damn good for a quality
laptop bag.
