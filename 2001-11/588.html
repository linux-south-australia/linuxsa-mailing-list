what did people think of these?
i went to have a look, they looked nice but too big and tank like.. (Esp
as i am quite small)

does anyone have any other options for slim line backpacks with padding?

i am using a mambo one still, with no zip (!) which is slightly worrying
however the tanks that STM had were not suitable for my slim line! :)

And i wasn't keen on a satchel --&gt; too uncomfortable for long walking?

&gt; 
&gt; I saw an article in the "Computers" section of the Sunday Mail (or was
&gt; it the Saturday Advertiser? I don't remember) talking about these STM
&gt; bags. According to the article, they're pretty ergonomic as well as not
&gt; looking like a laptop bag.
&gt; 
&gt; I went down to NextByte on Glen Osmond Road. I liked them so much, I
&gt; bought one.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to hold everything nicely. It looks like your average backpack,
&gt; except with a heap of really cumfy padding everywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; The one I purchased looks like

&gt; 
&gt; The website for the (Australian) company that makes these bags is

&gt; 
&gt; At $85-00, they're not too bad (when compared to other laptop bags).
