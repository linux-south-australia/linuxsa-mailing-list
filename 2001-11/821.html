&gt; It's been my experience that Telstra cannot install home highway to

&gt; ORHH either.

I got it, we were on a "pair gain" line (which I'm not sure how it
relates to RIMs?) but they didn't know until the tech installed it all
and went to the exchange and found we weren't using the pair marked
as for our place.  He ended up swapping us to a different pair and
it works, I got the impression though they would have said it wasn't
available if they knew we were on a pair gain line at the start
(initially they said the exchange couldn't do ISDN but I persisted
as I suspected they were wrong). 

In the process he found and fixed several open circuits in the lines
back to the exchange (only about 2.5km) and from chatting to neighbours 
their modems seems to not drop out as much since I got ORHH!  

It took 2 techs a day and a bit to get the ORHH all working, then it 
died last wednesday afternoon and it took another day of work again 
(done by friday afternoon) at the exchange to fix it ("repaired/
replaced a conductor at exchange" was the info I got).

This exchange can't do ADSL (apparently) but can do ISDN, but it's not 
really metro area either.

Dave.
