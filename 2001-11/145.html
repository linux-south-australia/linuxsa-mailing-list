&gt; I would like to know how under RH 7.1 how-to share the 'NET'
&gt; connection for the machines at home easily, I have had lots of people
&gt; say it is only 3 lines of code, I ask where and people say read the
&gt; how-to's, I know it is the only way to learn but reading the how-to's
&gt; and listening to people sometimes makes matters worse. I have bought
&gt; books on linux adminstration and now I am totally confused.

Basically you need to use either ipchains or iptables to set up
masquerading.

What this does is let all of the computers on the internal network (which
I'm assuming use addesses starting with 192.168.x.x or something like that)
use the linux box as a gateway.

For example I use the command

/sbin/ipchains -A forward -j MASQ -s 192.168.200.0/24 -d ! 192.168.200.0/24

in this example I've used the network 192.168.200.0 with a netmask of
255.255.255.0 ( the /24 is just a convienient shorthand). What this example
does is make all packets with a source ( -s ) address from the internal
network, and a destination ( -d ) address not in the internal network get
masqueraded.

You may need to turn on ip forwarding to make this work. Look in
/etc/sysctl.conf and change ip_forwarding to 1.

Hope that helps. I've only covered the very basics here btw - you might want
to add some extra firewalling rules to keep all the nasties out.

&gt; I am wondering how many people on telstras cable are using linux, also
&gt; is anybody having problems with there cable, for me the last two weeks
&gt; maybe 4 days of use and on the second modem.

Well I'm also on my second modem (mine lasted 2 days!) and until about a
week ago I've been having a lot of trouble with the service being offline
right when I needed it the most! At the moment however it is all working
really nicely - I guess they'll be wanting it to be working nicely so that
everyone downloads heaps just in time for them to start charging for
anything over 3GB :-(

&gt; About 10 days ago telstra did some thing to the network like change
&gt; out of 10 ip's 9 changed, yes the service is dhcp but when the dhcp
&gt; server gets a new number and the gateway only starters, three weeks
&gt; ago I got the new modem, and now I am very unsatisfied with the
&gt; service and they know it..

I'm not exactly sure what you mean here, but when they changed stuff it
screwed up my service for a half a day or so too. It's happy now though :-)

Cheers,

Sam Silvester.
