&gt; &gt; Hrm, well, I suppose that's something that you've got to decide when you
&gt; &gt; write the e-mail. Postfix+BSD-mbox+UW-POP3d isn't such a bad combination
&gt; &gt; for a small setup. It's dead easy to setup, making it (arguably) the
&gt; &gt; best way to get a quick solution to the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; But no, you see, what you say simply isn't the case. 
&gt; 
&gt; In the above you could replace Postfix, BSD-mbox and UW-POP3d respectively
&gt; with [qmail/Exim], Maildir and Courier-POP/IMAPd and just as arguably have
&gt; a setup which was even easier, depending on the background of the
&gt; installer.

Indeed. Changing Postfix from BSD-mbox delivery to Maildir is simply a 
matter of changing one line of text.

UW-POP3D really couldn't be much easier. Copy the executable somewhere 
and edit/uncomment the line in /etc/inetd.conf (assuming you're using
inetd).

I suppose it comes down to a matter of personal preference. I find it
easier too do what I explained in the previous e-mail. Postfix is well 
documented, and any idiot can run UW-POP3d. 

&gt; For example, I'm no qmail fan, but it is true that qmail needs just one
&gt; line in one file as a minimum configuration, which is less than Postfix.
&gt; The minimum Exim config is a tiny number of lines. And plenty of people
&gt; would argue that Maildir is easier in many respects than the BSD format.

I'm not sure that I'd agree with you about Qmail. You've painted a
picture which seems to make Qmail look like an easy MTA to setup. It
took me a fair amount of time to understand how the whole beast works, 
let alone the installation procedure.

&gt; Similar arguments about POP daemons, although I'm sufficiently happy with
&gt; Courier to not be current with any alternatives.

You see, I think of it this way. I have no need to bother with
anything other than UW-POP3d, because it does the job. You and I both
know that it's not exactly hard to setup the configuration I detailed
in the original message.

&gt; &gt; Yeah, but seriously Dan, who could be bothered when you're talking about
&gt; &gt; something that's small.
&gt; 
&gt; Many people, including me. I wouldn't think of what you proposed as the
&gt; first obvious option at all, not that I think your proposal is bad.

It seems we have different definitions of "easy" :-)

&gt; Background of the installer (and the desires/needs of the user) is
&gt; everything.

Yup, I agree (!). I still stand by my original assertion that Postfix
and UW-IMAP (BSD-mbox) is easier than much else out there, though.
