Hi there.

A simple solution for xmms is to go into the preferences and edit the config 
of the output plugin (OSS Driver) and set the sound device to /dev/sound/dsp

I assume you should be able to do the same for RealPlayer.

Otherwise to add the link on boot, I believe that you have to edit the 
/etc/devfsd.conf file.  From the devfsd man page, it says the line to add a 
symlink is:
REGISTER     mydir/mydev  CFUNCTION GLOBAL symlink $devname mydev

The devfsd.conf man page gives this example:
REGISTER ^tts/0$ CFUNCTION GLOBAL symlink $devname modem

And my devfsd.conf file has these lines (I use MDK 8.1 as well):
REGISTER        ^cdroms/cdrom0$ CFUNCTION GLOBAL symlink cdroms/cdrom0 cdrom
REGISTER        ^v4l/video0$    CFUNCTION GLOBAL symlink v4l/video0 video

Therefore I assume that the line to add the /dev/dsp -&gt; /dev/sound/dsp line 
would be:
REGISTER        ^sound/dsp$    CFUNCTION GLOBAL symlink sound/dsp dsp

Read the two man pages and check around the web (google is your friend as 
they all say).  If anyone else knows more about devfs, does this all look 
right?  (I haven't actually done this yet, I'll try tomorrow night.)

Cheers and Good Luck
Damien Byrne.
