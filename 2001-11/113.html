Hi Joseph,

I am offering the following as suggestions from a newcomer of only a 
year or so experience. I am not writing this expecting to be the 
recipient of flames so any readers desperate to respond in that manner 
please don't bother.


I have just installed RH 7.2 and I was disappointed. The install 
interface was just not up to the standard of the Mandrake 8.1. 
Selecting items brought up no messages about any dependencies that 
might be affected by the choice. In some cases blocks of items had been 
selected but when I selected clear it also affected other topics not on 
screen. It took me literally hours to select a minimal install and then 
it installed some items I had clearly said to not install. 

If Red Hat is to appeal to the new Linux person then they need to look 
at what Mandrake is doing with their interface and try to do better.

Another question to either of them with the future in mind.  Although 
they now provide selections according to the usage of the system, 
Workstation, Server etc, why not provide an alternative setup option 
with the aplication in mind such as Education, Graphic Arts or even 
SOHO?

cheers, Ian
