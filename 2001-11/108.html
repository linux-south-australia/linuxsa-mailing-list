The tax thing was in europe, which is pal, and thus we copped it since a
lot of the models were the same units.

from 

<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q">http://www.google.com/search?q</A>=cache:d4MO-UfkS9g:www.terran.com/support/compatibility.html+australia+%2B%22dv+in%22+%2Btax


Special note for European PAL camcorders:
European Union taxation laws specify that a DV camcorder that has a DV
record-back function carries the same tax as a VHS recorder, which is 
higher than a camera tax. In the past, most of the major DV camcorder 
manufacturers have chosen to sell DV camcorders in Europe with DV-out 
only enabled. We are pleased to report now that a number of companies 
have changed this stance and new models are appearing with both DV input
and DV output enabled. DV input enables edited DV projects to be saved 
back to the MiniDV tape on the camcorder, or connected VHS deck using 
the Digital Origin "Print to Video" feature. In addition, users 
can interface a PAL monitor to the S-Video out port on the camcorder to
see "LiveDV".

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Hmm.. Not sure.. just make sure you get something that supports dv-in and
&gt; &gt;  &gt; dv-out (not all support dv-in, surprisingly.. something to do with tax
&gt; &gt;  &gt; reasons i believe???)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; No.  Copyright.  You're allowed to extract a full-quality digital video
&gt; &gt; stream, you just aren't allowed to write it to anything else afterwards.
&gt; 
&gt; Copyright is the excuse.  The "fair dealing" clauses in the
&gt; Copyright Act deal with reasons for reproducing a particular
&gt; media's content, not the reproduction technology itself.
&gt; For example, you can reproduce a document by taking a video
&gt; of it, the Copyright Act doesn't require you to set up
&gt; a phototypesetter.  So there's currently no Copyright Act
&gt; reason why DV Out can't be connected to DV In for fair
&gt; dealing purposes.  [1]
&gt; 
&gt; It's suspected that the real reason for a lack of DV In
&gt; is profit maximisation, especially for companies that
&gt; manufacture hardware, distribute content and have deals
&gt; with creators of content. 
&gt; 
&gt; Glen
&gt; 
&gt;  [1] Currently meaning "today".  There's a case in the works
&gt;      at the moment at the crux of fair dealing an circumvention
&gt;      devices.  The result should give some idea of technology
&gt;      limits that manufacturers build into their equipment that
&gt;      prevents fair dealing reproductions.
