&gt; What do you suggest as a minimum for a new or refurbished house to be

&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of specifiying CAT 5 instead of nomal phone cabling.
&gt; Maybe specifying satellite-capable cabling for the TV connection so
&gt; they can handle broadband. What else should I be suggesting to the City?

Cat5 might be adequate for the forseeable future, but for the
unforseeable install PVC pipe in the walls back to a common point for
greater potential and flexibility. 

Or don't cable via the walls at all, install a false floor. This is what
many of the newer highrise buildings are doing. The main problem is that
compatable floor coverings (carpet et al) aren't very attractive.

Don't just think about the interior either, the major hurdle to
broadband is the last mile, so make it easier by putting another PVC
conduit from the curb into your house. If the council are talking about
a series of houses or new development, it would be seriously worthwhile
making sure that there is some sort of common ducting at the curb for
broadband to be rolled into later.
