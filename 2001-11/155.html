&gt; :&gt; seconded

I think you guys misinterpreted Mark. While I can't speak for him, and
it's possible that I'm misinterpreting him, I think he's simply musing
over the fact that normally we have a lot of political crap, and
no-one really complains, but when it's relevant (ie now, during an
election campaign), people are up in arms against it. I don't think
he's advocating that we "absolutely can't have" political crap at
present...

&gt; :&gt; &gt;Heh.  The mailing list is full to the brim of political crap usually;
&gt; :&gt; &gt;the one time when we absolutely can't have any of that nonsense is
&gt; :&gt; &gt;during an election campaign.

Mark -- if I've misinterpreted you, please correct me... :)

PS personally, I think it _is_ appropriate to discuss elements of
politics that directly affect us as Linux and Open Source software
users, workers and advocates. This most certainly includes discussion
of the parties' policies regarding IT expenditure, but blatant party
advocacy and propaganda (sp?) is probably likely to rub people up the
wrong way for no benefit...
