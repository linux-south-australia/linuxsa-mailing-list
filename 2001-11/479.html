I had a similar problem a week or three ago... check the archives for
a mail entitled "blood, sweat and partitions" or something similar...

In brief, I recomment gpart and parted, and the LinuxCare bootable
business card... :)

&gt; Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; PROBLEM---
&gt; 
&gt; I accidentally deleted the partition information from an 80Gb hard
&gt; drive.  The drive contained a single NTFS partition.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; CAUSE---
&gt; 
&gt; I should have been concentrating a little more, but my system has a
&gt; 20Gb, a 30Gb, and an 80Gb hard drive in it.  **Windows 98's** FDISK
&gt; program listed my 80Gb hard drive as a 10Gig drive, and I, without
&gt; thinking, deleted it thinking it was one of the 10Gb partitions I have
&gt; on the 20Gb drive.  
&gt; 
&gt; Oops.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ACTION TAKEN---
&gt; 
&gt; I'd realized my mistake once I'd done it, so I left the hard drive as
&gt; is.  It's current status is that it has *had* an 80Gb NTFS partition,
&gt; and that has since been erased.  No partitions have been recreated since
&gt; the removal of the original.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; WHERE I NEED HELP---WHERE I NEED HELP---WHERE I NEED HELP---
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any good Linux/FreeBSD tools around that can help me revive
&gt; this partition without overwriting the data?  I assume it shouldn't be
&gt; that hard considering there weren't any additional partitions on the
&gt; drive, so the partition information starts at the beginning and ends at
&gt; the end.  I wouldn't have to work out which sector a second partition
&gt; started at, or anything like that.
&gt; 
&gt; I do *not* trust any MS-based tools to do the job, and I considered
&gt; Partition Magic to do the job, but I only had version 5, and I needed
&gt; version 7, and I couldn't get onto any "GPL open warez" servers to get
&gt; it at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; I will not cry if I lose this data, because only a helluva lot of
&gt; movies, media, mp3s, software, and the 12 months of non-backed up (heh,
&gt; oops) data will be lost.
&gt; 
&gt; So in effect if I lose this partition I will have to begin again from
&gt; scratch.  Bah.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;SUCK&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure a bunch of resourceful people such as yourselves would be able
&gt; to come up to a viable solution to my problem, where all my data remains
&gt; intact :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;/SUCK&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanking you all!!!
