I am looking for a way of accessing an advanced Linux filesystem natively
from FreeBSD.

One of my machines is configured as dualboot FreeBSD/Linux, with several
other OSs running under Linux in one way or another. However I will
probably remove FreeBSD from the dualboot partition for one reason: it
won't let me use any kind of a reasonable filesystem on my 15Gb data
partition. By "reasonable" I mean something like ReiserFS, XFS or ext3.
These filesystems are maturing and have features I want. I have now done
enough with ReiserFS to say I think it is very mature. I have done enough
with ext3 to say I think it works.

So I will either have to stick with running FreeBSD under VMware under
Linux, or not use any of the advanced filesystem types under Linux. (FFS
under Linux is not stable for write, yet, and even if it was it doesn't
seem a good move when compared with ReiserFS, softupdates
notwithstanding.)

Question: FreeBSD works well with ext2fs, but I am nervous to try it with
ext3 on a relatively important partition. Does anyone have a history of
FreeBSD with ext3 who can reassure me it at least works sometimes? :)

Unfortunately FreeBSD seems unlikely to ever have ReiserFS or XFS (usual
non-technical reasons &lt;sigh&gt;.) The performance can matter quite a lot when
doing crypto loopback. Which is another thing I can't do from FreeBSD;
there is a port called security/cfs which doesn't seem to be compatible
with anything else nor a high-performance solution. I haven't investigated
this much though.
