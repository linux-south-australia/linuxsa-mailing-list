&gt; This "Peak" and "Off-peak" stuff seems like crap. Since when does it

ISP's buying data by the pipe tend to have enormous unused capacity
between 12 midnight and 7am, which coincides with the Netspace offpeak
period. They're being generous enough to make this unused capacity
available to their ADSL users. I don't see what's crap about that.

&gt; Netspace also have this nasty little clause at the bottom of their
&gt; Home ADSL Pricing page[1]. It reads "Minimum contract is for 12 months
&gt; from activation date".

What's so nasty about that? The people at Netspace are pretty nice guys,
they're not out to rip anyone off. Netspace are one of the few remaining
ISP's that don't have to answer to shareholders, and can let their
conscience rather than their bank balance make decisions.

&gt; &gt; that is 10gig/month is it??????? for 100$, only downside is no static ip
&gt; &gt; but oh well?
&gt; 
&gt; That's $0.01 / MB. I just spoke to Netspace, and according to the guy
&gt; on the other end of the phone, you're limited to 3GB during their
&gt; "peak" time and 7GB during "off-peak". That means that you could

They're not selling data for 1c/mb, they're selling the peak stuff for
3c/mb (still pretty cheap..), then letting users have the run of the
off-peak data along with a limit on that to stop a handful of users
spoiling it for everyone.
