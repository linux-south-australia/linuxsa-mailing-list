Ian,

Thanks for your input, I certainly prefer Mandrake's advance install
routine. To put it simply: it's VERY friendly, and powerful. Just on
aesthetics, Red Hat looks dry and corporate, whereas Mandrake is friendly
and lively. This is rather subjective, but unlike computers, we human beings
are impressionable.

One particular case that I've noticed, the disk partitioning tool with
Mandrake 8.1 makes resizing and other disk operations a breeze. In Red Hat's
install, I found that the Disk Bruid utility could not do resizes. This
comes in handy if you have to tweak a Linux partition.

I didn't have the motivation to look into the text-based (fips?) disk
utility, perhaps that would have done the job.

Cheers,

Joseph Tan

Hi Joseph,

I am offering the following as suggestions from a newcomer of only a
year or so experience. I am not writing this expecting to be the
recipient of flames so any readers desperate to respond in that manner
please don't bother.


I have just installed RH 7.2 and I was disappointed. The install
interface was just not up to the standard of the Mandrake 8.1.
Selecting items brought up no messages about any dependencies that
might be affected by the choice. In some cases blocks of items had been
selected but when I selected clear it also affected other topics not on
screen. It took me literally hours to select a minimal install and then
it installed some items I had clearly said to not install.

If Red Hat is to appeal to the new Linux person then they need to look
at what Mandrake is doing with their interface and try to do better.

Another question to either of them with the future in mind.  Although
they now provide selections according to the usage of the system,
Workstation, Server etc, why not provide an alternative setup option
with the aplication in mind such as Education, Graphic Arts or even
SOHO?

cheers, Ian
