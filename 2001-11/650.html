 &gt; &gt; This isn't a legal requirement, it's just plain ol' control-freakery.

 &gt; all i know is that we were told by the police to put in place something

Did you enquire about whether it was legal for them to ask you to do 
something like that?  

If you're an ISP, you're a Carriage Service Provider according to 
the Telecommunications Act.  That means you have privacy obligations
to your customers which even the police can't breach without the 
appropriate paperwork signed by a high-ranking member of the force.
(otherwise known as a section 282 declaration).

The Broadcasting Service Act also fell short of requiring ISPs to 
install any additional monitoring or logging.

So I'd have to wonder about what legal authority the local police
thought they had to insist on that, and what standards they'll be
following if they ever want to obtain information from it (remembering
that any evidence they gather from you without a section 282 declaration
will likely be tainted, and therefore inadmissible in court).

Talk to your lawyer and/or your local ISP industry body.  What you've
just described sounds... wierd.  And possibly illegal.
