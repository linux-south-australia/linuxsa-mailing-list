This would be a great idea.  But as any good general know, to win a battle 
and a war (oooh, big talk) one must know ones enemy (not that I'm trying to 
make an enemy of a major political party and federal government, I've just 
been reading Tsun Tzu's Ancient Art of War. :).

So I think that part of any lobbying effort should be a study of the current 
view points of the Liberal party in regards to IT.

A page connecting to pdfs of liberal party policy is here:
<A HREF="http://www.liberal.org.au/policy/policyachieve.HTM">http://www.liberal.org.au/policy/policyachieve.HTM</A> (hmm, three letter 
extensions)

Of particular interest is:

2.11.01  Information Industries for the 21st Century
2.11.01  Building an Information Economy for the 21st Century
1.11.01  Backing Australia's Industry for the Future
1.11.01  Backing Australian Science and Innovation

These make quite interesting reading (as well as the environmental ones) and 
the points within should be addressed with regard to Open Source/Standards 
Software.  There should be many avenues in the sections on R&D and about 
developing Australia's place as a world leader in the high tech industry.

(And there is a section in "Building an Information Economy for the 21st 
Century" about the push for internet access Australia wide and pushing for 
broadband take-up)

I think it is up to us to remind the liberal party of it's commitments in 
this regard and to express our opinions in how their party policies are 
enacted as a government.

And now back to my exam revision *sigh*.

Damien.

&gt; We need a marketing approach.

&gt; Could we start a discussion group - either 'cc' email based or otherwise
&gt; to take this further?
&gt;
&gt; I am quite excited about this and would really like to see it develop.

&gt; &gt; the multi prong approach would require several key players on the
&gt; &gt; political field to be lobbied by the groups chosen representative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you consider lobbying the minister, the opposition and some of the
&gt; &gt; other key members (remember that MrSlop will do the same) for a better
&gt; &gt; deal and point out that the "better deal" would benefit all stakeholders,
&gt; &gt; not just the ones in the Linux Community.
