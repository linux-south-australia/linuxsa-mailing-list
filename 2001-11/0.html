Jonathan,

I would agree that regardless of its price tag, MS Office has a very large
lead in functionality and user friendness over any office suite on this
planet at this current time. I'm hoping that Sun's Star Office 6 will
deliver a good quality package that will show up as a serious competitor to
Microsoft's suite. I've heard of Applixware's suite, but I haven't checked
it out since it's not freely downloadable.

In terms of web browsing, I've been using Mozilla 0.15 and Konqueror 2.2.1.
Compared to IE, these browser do a very very good job in terms of HTML
rendering. Java and Flash capabilities in Mozilla work extremely well after
you've installed the plugins. Sites that are *very* IE centric (which
fortunately very few) may have problems. None of my regular sites come under
that category though.

Give Mozilla a shot, the interface and functionality is so familiar that you
could drop it in as a IE replacement and few would notice much of a
difference. Version 1 will be a significant launch milestone for very high
quality, open-source, multiplatform web browser. I'm hoping I can get it to
compile on a Playstation 2 Linux kit when that comes out.

Cheers,

Joseph Tan

&gt; It's the same, but I don't agree that people /would/ use the non-MS
&gt; version.  I think they'd flock to the MS version, just so they could
&gt; use Office and IE.  You might not, but you're one of the 10% of the
computer
&gt; using population who understands just how mediocre Microsoft really is.

&lt;flamebait&gt;
Cmon, Office and IE DOMINATE. They are truly good programs.
No Office program or text editor comes _close_ to Office running on win
No other browser comes _close_ to IE running on win (forget the mac
version)
[for whatever reason they are far superior, doesn't matter if it is all
built
into the os, these are the 2 programs that most ppl use]
If you believe otherwise you're telling yourself lies!
&lt;/flamebait&gt;
