Hi Wayne,

While analysing the new features and settings of Windows XP RTM 
(build 2600) almost 2 months ago, it became apparent that logging into 
a Hotmail account with IE 6 resulted in remote execution of local 
tasks, and the modification of registry values.

Windows Messenger comes installed as default with Windows XP and the 
only way to stop it from being run on login is to remove the relevant 
value in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.

Upon logging into a Hotmail account while using IE 6, I discovered 
that directly after the page has finished loading, Windows Messenger 
is automatically restarted and that the process is attributed to the 
user who is logged in locally. Not only does this happen, but the 
registry string used to start Windows Messenger on login is also
restored.

This extremely unsavory behavior only occurs when using Internet
Explorer 
so it rules out the use of special cookies. I have never yet performed 
packet analysis but doing so may reveal some interesting results. 

This obscene invasion of user privacy also results in endless 
possibilities, some of which follow.

1. Could this be used to cause the remote execution of any program 
installed to a known default location?

2. Execution on login of trojaned software (infecting the system 
by another means) to perform key logging and obtain passwords or 
other user data.

3. Assuming that the reading of registry values is also permitted, 
this would allow the retrieval of software product keys and registered 
user names.

4. How long till the method is cracked and used by other websites. 
If modification or removal of existing keys is permitted, then by 
just visiting a website a computer may be rendered unbootable.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I loaded XP a couple of days and first impressions where quite good. It
&gt; seemed a lot more stable that 95 98 and NT 4. It is definetly a lot quicker
&gt; at loading programs, and genral browsing of the web, the pages load a lot
&gt; faster. All in all I would consider myself to be a lot happier running XP
&gt; than I have been with 98 or NT 4.
&gt; 
&gt; Until ..........
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed a couple of hours ago that my machine, with XP, seems to be
&gt; communicating with the web continuously, well regularly I should say. I
&gt; have a linux box with an external modem as my gateway, and this workstation
&gt; connected to it via a small hub. Down the botton right hand corner near the
&gt; clock is the network connection icon which lights up when data is being
&gt; transmitted. As I watch now, it is lighting up for about ten seconds
&gt; sending about 5 - 10 packets per second. I can also hear the hard drive
&gt; heads moving. Looking across the room at the modem, the transmit light is
&gt; almost continuosly on, with the receive flashing on the rare occasion. The
&gt; strange thing is that I haven't used the web browser for about an hour, and
&gt; the e-mail program doesn't automatically check for mail, I don't run icq
&gt; and msn messenger is turned off. So without my consent XP is transmitting
&gt; something, oh yeah, unless it's in the terms and conditions, smart one
&gt; Microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt; I disable the Network interface in XP and it stops, of course, when I turn
&gt; it back on again the transmissions start again.
&gt; 
&gt; Call me paraniod, but this workstation is sending out something, somewhere
&gt; on the web.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what's going on with XP other than the usual rumours ?
&gt; 
&gt; At the time of writing this, I was made aware that I may have been infected
&gt; with the Nimba virus, I have only used this machine on the web for about 4
&gt; hours. My current virus scanner is Norton 2001, which I have been told
&gt; won't work with XP, apparently I need Norton 2002. For this reason I don't
&gt; have a virus scanner loaded. So much for XP's firewall doing the job.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know the registry keys to look at to verify if it is in fact
&gt; the Nimba virus ?
