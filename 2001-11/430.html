&gt; &gt;&gt; interest in Open Source and Free Software. We choose to use this
&gt; 
&gt; I would say that free is not relevant here. It is open source software.

I meant Free as in free speech... trying not to offend the RMS's among
us...

&lt;snip&gt;
 
&gt; I think it is wrong to focus on Microsoft and its products. Instead, we 
&gt; should be promoting the benefits to Government and Australians of open 
&gt; standards and open source software.

I don't think I did, did I? I used it as an example... I'll try to
remove it in the second draft...
&gt; 
&gt; I think there is nothing wrong with a Microsoft that has to compete in a 
&gt; world where open standards are king. They would not be in the monopoly 
&gt; position they are in if governments and other organizations had insisted 
&gt; on open standards long ago. The Internet is a stirling example of the 
&gt; power of open standards.

it was... :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all new (and
&gt; &gt;&gt; preferably old) software projects undertaken by the Government have
&gt; &gt;&gt; their code released to the community under an open licence (GPL or
&gt; &gt;&gt; BSD). This is a situation where the collaboration between Government,
&gt; &gt;&gt; community, and even other Governments would result in a win-win-win
&gt; &gt;&gt; situation.
&gt; 
&gt; This is something that is worth fighting for. After all, we own it, but 
&gt; locking these things away in individual departments does no one any good.

Indeed -- While a lot of it is useless to anyone except the Govt,
there is nothing to be lost and a lot to be gained from releasing
it...
