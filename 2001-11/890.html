Sounds too cheap... Cheap ISPs always scare me. I signed up with jeack when
I lived in Melbourne. Charges were $100 per year flat rate ( 2 hour
sessions/ 8 hours per day usage / No cap ). This was many years ago when
Ozemail were charging $5-7 per hour and monthly plans were $40-$50.

The problem was you could never get on during normal A/H ( 4pm-10pm ) and
when you did you got transfer rates of 1k-2k if you were lucky. They were
way oversubscribed and as I found out later only had a 128k link.

It might be worth asking dodo what Modem/User ratio there is and available
bandwidth. Bear in mind also that 70 Meg per month is not much. It is capped
at $14 per month and I'd imagine most casual users would go over 70 Meg for
a month. If I was going to be suggesting this plan to someone I would be
advising them it would probably cost them $14 per month - maybe less.

&gt; Subject: [OT] dodo.com - any comments?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Like many others we got an insert in our paper talking about
&gt; a newcomer
&gt; to the ISP scene -dodo.com - and their offer of a $9.90
&gt; dial-up account.
&gt;
&gt; Not wanting to take up space on the list but would be
&gt; interested in any
&gt; comments on who they are and whether this might be an appropriate ISP
&gt; for our community project.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, Ian
