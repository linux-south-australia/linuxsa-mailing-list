How come: 
 
a) I only get debug info when I claim to be using MSIE? 
b) The debug information says everything works fine? 
 
www.netcraft.com/whats says The site www.harveynorman.com.au is running
Microsoft-IIS/4.0 on NT4/Windows 98.  
 
Looks to me like a false failure when the word "linux" is detected as your
OS description, and then the debug info that shows it all really works is
hidden from non MSIE users...
