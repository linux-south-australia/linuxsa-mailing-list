&gt; 2) That major Government IT contracts are often exclusive, to the
&gt; detriment of competition.

This isn't going to fly.  Government departments need to made
exclusive contracts for efficiency (eg: at the help desk, in
sysadmin, etc).

It would be better to simply make the Minister aware of
the potential of open source software to save significant
licensing fees.

&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all contracts are
&gt; designed to foster competition, and encourage the best solution for
&gt; the problem at hand to be used, as opposed to requiring a single
&gt; solution for all classes of problems. Diversity should be encouraged
&gt; in Government IT, for the dual purposes of fostering competition and
&gt; developing a more resiliant infrastructure -- it is an accepted fact
&gt; that while uniformity can bring some cost advantages, it accentuates
&gt; any weaknesses to the point where a single weakness can allow one
&gt; virus to cause so much damage in one hit.

Far too wordy and far too much jargon.  It's a new minister remmeber.

&gt; 3) That Government software projects themselves are usually closed
&gt; source. We believe that by encouraging the release of source code for
&gt; Government-sponsored projects, not only will the community benefit
&gt; from the use of this code, but the Government will benefit from the
&gt; community's use of this code. This applies specifically in cases where
&gt; the code being developed can have some wider application, but even in
&gt; cases where it won't, there is no disadvantage in releasing the code.
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all new (and
&gt; preferably old) software projects undertaken by the Government have
&gt; their code released to the community under an open licence (GPL or
&gt; BSD). This is a situation where the collaboration between Government,
&gt; community, and even other Governments would result in a win-win-win
&gt; situation.

This really isn't a major issue.  A lot of government-written
software has no potential for reuse.  Open sourcing a customs
application doesn't really help anyone.

The major issues are more to do with intellectual property law:
 - reverse engineering
 - software patents
 - circumvention devices
so you will also need to write to the new Attorney-General.

Can I suggest that we workshop the letter at the next
LinuxSA meeting?
