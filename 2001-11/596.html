Quoting Matthew Western &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mwestern@affairs.net.au">mwestern@affairs.net.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hi People,
&gt; I've finally finished mucking around with Evolution .99 connecting to
&gt; exchange server using IMAP and LDAP.  bascially it all works apart from
one
&gt; thing.  When subscribing IMAP folders to things like calendar/contacts
&gt; folders in exchange you can't view it as a calendar/contacts view like you
&gt; can when creating local folders.  this is very sad as basically it cant't
&gt; be
&gt; used as a full outlook 2k replacement over IMAP.  if they'd just do this
&gt; one
&gt; thing, it might work.  Jeffrey the IMAP devman says it will never happen,
&gt; so
&gt; i'm getting off the evolution list and binning it.....

You gotta remember a couple of things - evolution is in feature freeze right
now (ie release candidate 2 is out) awaiting the fabled 1.0 release.  Right
now
the developers are probably very tired of late nights and sick of chasing
down
the hard to find bugs.  It's probably not the right time to say their hard
work
sucks because it doesn't work seamlessly with exchange.

As the evolution hacker mentions, you or anyone else is free to reverse
engineer
the undocumented exchange protocol.  Once that's done it's relatively
simple[1]
to implement it.

This is an opportunity for fame and glory.  Want to be the next 'Tridge'?
Then reverse engineer the calendar protocol in exchange and publish a
reference
implementation.

Of course Ximian/Red Hat/Someone else could pay someone to do it, but only
if
they can see a profitable business case to do it, since it'd be quite a bit
of
work.

Have fun ethereal-ising :)

Michael...

[1] Simple?  Just like implementing SMB in SAMBA is simple.  Which it isn't.
