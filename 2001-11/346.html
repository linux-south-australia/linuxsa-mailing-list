Greetings all,

the multi prong approach would require several key players on the political
field to be lobbied by the groups chosen representative.

If you consider lobbying the minister, the opposition and some of the other
key members (remember that MrSlop will do the same) for a better deal and
point out that the "better deal" would benefit all stakeholders, not just the
ones in the Linux Community.

cheers

Greg

&gt; I suggest you forward it through sa-auug - this has already been
&gt; discussed in that group.
&gt;
&gt; Bandwidth supply should also be an issue - what if the government can
&gt; provide some incentive / reason for Hellstra to loosen their iron grip
&gt; on our national bandwidth supply so we can have more than their &lt;quote -
&gt; ha ha&gt;  'whopping 400Mb' allowance on their broadband connection!  I
&gt; could not believe this when I saw the ad - I still suspect it was a joke
&gt; - especially as they were suggesting that the 'whopping' 400Mb could be
&gt; used to download movies in a flash, etc.
&gt;
&gt; The problem with Unix / Linux however - is there is NO unified voice -
&gt; just a bunch of disparate (although highly intelligent and creative)
&gt; people who can't even agree on correct email format or the best text
&gt; editor let alone a unified approach to lobbying government.
&gt;
&gt; Richard - your idea speaks volumes of your foresight and leadership
&gt; qualities.
&gt;
&gt; I suggest we work out a multi-pronged approach - target the minister,
&gt; media and anything else we can find - with a unified consistent and well
&gt; researched message.
&gt;
&gt; I am happy to speak publically and be interviewed unless someone is more
&gt;   keen than I am or disagrees with my thoughts.  I would never speak on
&gt; behalf of the Linux 'community' without prior consent.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually, the article tips Abbott... Whoever it turns out to be, it
&gt; &gt; wouldn't hurt to write some sort of letter from LinuxSA, signed by as
&gt; &gt; many as can sign it, informing the minister of concerns about
&gt; &gt; government policy that closes out open source solutions for govt
&gt; &gt; contracts, as well as open source clients with govt services...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I could write such a letter (short, 1/2 a page or so) if anyone thinks
&gt; &gt; it's worthwhile... and I would suggest that I send it to the list, and
&gt; &gt; anyone who wants to can reply offlist to me, and I'll add your names
&gt; &gt; to the list of names on it... yah?
&gt; &gt;
