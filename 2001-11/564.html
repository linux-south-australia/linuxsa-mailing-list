<H1>[OT] Community IT Survey help</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
As part of the community IT project that I support I have been asked to 
develop a simple survey. We would like to be able to ask our community 
what their awareness of IT is and how best we might be able to assist 
them to provide access and skills.

I have never done anything like this before but I have completed loads 
of surveys, mostly poorly done and confusing to complete.

I would like to have your help to build this survey. Here is a starter 
set of questions;

------------------------------
Do you use the Internet
1)  Yes, regularly
2)  Yes, sometimes
3)  Hardly ever
4)  Don't ever use it

Do you have a computer connected to the internet where you usually live 
(Yes or No)

If you don't have the Internet at home, is there somewhere you can go 
where you can use it for free (Yes or No)

Would you be interested in using a 'free access internet computer' if 
available in your Neighbourhood?

------------------------------------

How should I word the survey?

What questions should I be asking?

Should they be completing the survey themselves or should volunteers be 
asking the questions?

Any software around that might help us collate the responses 
meaningfully?

Any help is appreciated. Please respond offline.
