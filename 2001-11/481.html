I think it wuold be best to look at gpard and parted. There was a thread on
this not too long ago so have a look at the archives!

Good luck! :-)

Subject: Hard Drive Partitioning



Guys,

PROBLEM---

I accidentally deleted the partition information from an 80Gb hard
drive.  The drive contained a single NTFS partition.


CAUSE---

I should have been concentrating a little more, but my system has a
20Gb, a 30Gb, and an 80Gb hard drive in it.  **Windows 98's** FDISK
program listed my 80Gb hard drive as a 10Gig drive, and I, without
thinking, deleted it thinking it was one of the 10Gb partitions I have
on the 20Gb drive.

Oops.


ACTION TAKEN---

I'd realized my mistake once I'd done it, so I left the hard drive as
is.  It's current status is that it has *had* an 80Gb NTFS partition,
and that has since been erased.  No partitions have been recreated since
the removal of the original.


WHERE I NEED HELP---WHERE I NEED HELP---WHERE I NEED HELP---

Are there any good Linux/FreeBSD tools around that can help me revive
this partition without overwriting the data?  I assume it shouldn't be
that hard considering there weren't any additional partitions on the
drive, so the partition information starts at the beginning and ends at
the end.  I wouldn't have to work out which sector a second partition
started at, or anything like that.

I do *not* trust any MS-based tools to do the job, and I considered
Partition Magic to do the job, but I only had version 5, and I needed
version 7, and I couldn't get onto any "GPL open warez" servers to get
it at the time.

I will not cry if I lose this data, because only a helluva lot of
movies, media, mp3s, software, and the 12 months of non-backed up (heh,
oops) data will be lost.

So in effect if I lose this partition I will have to begin again from
scratch.  Bah.

&lt;SUCK&gt;

I'm sure a bunch of resourceful people such as yourselves would be able
to come up to a viable solution to my problem, where all my data remains
intact :-)

&lt;/SUCK&gt;


Thanking you all!!!
