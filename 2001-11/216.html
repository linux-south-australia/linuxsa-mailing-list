I would suggest that the little old Ladies stick to Windows 95/98. There are
accessibility options that can make fonts and the like REALLY big.

Windows 98 is a lot less complicated than most Linux distributions.

As for Hardware requirements there is not really that much difference with
the current versions of Linux or Windows. Both require large hard disks ( at
least 2 gigs ), 128 Meg of RAM and a fastish Pentium II or better processor.

The only exception to that is if you don't want any graphical interface, but
I think little old ladies will need a graphical interface !!.

Windows 98 is not complicated... It is quite different from Windows 3.11 but
there is a lot of help available both online and from the community
including libraries etc.

&gt; Subject: I need help using linux
&gt;
&gt; I currently teach getting ont the internet to old ladies, my current
&gt; students are 82 and 85.
&gt; My own computer is a 486Dx and I have very reluctantly
&gt; upgraded recently
&gt; from mswindows3.11 to windows 95.
&gt;
&gt; However, all my old dears usually have new computers, loaded
&gt; in the shop
&gt; with the latest microsoft stuff.
&gt;
&gt; Their learning aim is to write e-mails and look at things on line.
&gt;
&gt; Poor vision is their most common problem.
&gt;
&gt; Windows 98+ is so complicated I've decided to learn Linux, practice on
&gt; my machine and end up installing it on theirs.
&gt;
&gt; So my questions are:
&gt; Everything I have read says that I need a pentium myself to run Linux,
&gt; and the latest thing I've read says I need at least 1.3 GIG of my
&gt; hardrive to load it?
&gt; Is this true?
&gt; what can I do on a 486? with 32meg of RAM?
&gt;
&gt; Does the Linux display allow for mega large high contract display for
&gt; the visually handicapped?
&gt;
&gt; Denise
