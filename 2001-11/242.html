I havnt been able to get any wireless stuff yet, so I cant give you any
first hand experience, but I can tell you most cards are based on the
prism 2 chipset, which most poeple seem to think is pretty good. I have
no idea about access points. These guys do though:

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I am intending to add a wireless access point to my home network, but I am 
&gt; having trouble finding
&gt; a range of products and comparisons.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want the cheapest and nastiest, but at the same time, being for 
&gt; home use, I don't want to spend
&gt; big dollars. It must be 802.11 compliant, have drivers for Windows 98,2000 
&gt; and also linux. The range would
&gt; need to be a minimum of 30 meters, which is through the house from one end 
&gt; to the other.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be after at least one PCI card for my desktop machine, and also one 
&gt; for my laptop being a pcmcia slot.
&gt; I don't really like the idea of using the USB devices for the desktops.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone recommend a product that they use and are satisfied with ?
&gt; 
&gt; If there are any retailers who would like to send me details of products 
&gt; and prices of the list, please do so.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention, that I will be plugging this device 
&gt; into my hub, and don't need connectors
&gt; for modem's etc on the back of the Access Point.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Wayne
