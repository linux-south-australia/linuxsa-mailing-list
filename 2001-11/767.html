I just did a few checks on some governments sites..

I was using opera.

sa.gov.au told me my browser didnt support some of the features of the
site, and then redirected me to <A HREF="http://text.sacentral.sa.gov.au/">http://text.sacentral.sa.gov.au/</A> which
worked fine.. so thats OK.

<A HREF="http://www.fed.gov.au/">http://www.fed.gov.au/</A> gave me a 404:

Not Found (404)
Original request: /%22/KSP/
Not found request: /%22/KSP/

but worked fine with netscape.

According to www.netcraft.com/whats they www.fed.gov.au are running:

Solaris
Netscape-Enterprise/3.6 SP3

Also:

The site www.sa.gov.au is running Apache/1.3.19 (Unix)  (Red-Hat/Linux)
mod_jk mod_ssl/2.8.1 OpenSSL/0.9.5a on Linux

So I guess we cant pick on their sites...

&gt; ----
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Senator Alston (Minister for Information Technology and
&gt; Telecommunications),
&gt; 
&gt; [can someone advise on the correct way of addressing? "Dear" sounds
&gt; too cosy to me, but maybe it's correct]
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, congratulations on your winning of Government and subsequent
&gt; re-appointment as Minister for IT and Telecommunications. We, as IT
&gt; employees, employers, students, hobbyists, academics, programmers,
&gt; systems administrators and users take great interest in what happens
&gt; in this portfolio, as it affects us directly.
&gt; 
&gt; The thing that unifies us, apart from our links with the IT and
&gt; Telecommunications industries, is our common interest in Open Source
&gt; and Free Software. This includes the operating systems Linux and BSD,
&gt; the world's most popular web server, Apache, the Netscape/Mozilla
&gt; browser, and many other packages. These packages are used all over
&gt; the world, in business, government and academia, as well as in a
&gt; growing number of homes.
&gt; 
&gt; We choose to use this software in preference to commercial offerings
&gt; for many reasons, including cost, quality and (most importantly)
&gt; freedom. The licences on these packages free us from the confines of
&gt; restrictive (and expensive) software licencing agreements, and allows
&gt; us to modify and improve the software we use as we see fit, thereby
&gt; benefiting thousands of other users, while we also benefit from their
&gt; modifications. [1]
&gt; 
&gt; However, we are concerned about the some of the directions that the
&gt; Government's IT policies have taken in recent years. Three major areas
&gt; of concern are:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1) That access to Government online services is restricted to users of
&gt; specific commercial software (often Microsoft Windows with Internet
&gt; Explorer or Word).  We find that some Government sites block users of
&gt; alternate operating systems or browsers, or that the sites are
&gt; customised to use special features of specific browsers, and are
&gt; unusable unless that browser is used. This effectively makes the use
&gt; of those services subject to the users having purchased the specific
&gt; software required, when there is no inherent advantage in doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of blocked sites:
&gt; &lt;could some people provide three or four Fed govt egs?&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of sites that don't work correctly on all (most?) browsers:
&gt; &lt;ditto?&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of services with other restrictions (eg MS Word etc only):
&gt; &lt;ditto?&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all online services
&gt; are accessible to users no matter what their choice of operating
&gt; system or browser. This allows more people to use Government services,
&gt; and it encourages competition in the software marketplace. Acheiving
&gt; this would require no more than building these sites according to
&gt; established standards. In some cases, it would require only the
&gt; removal of the code that restricts access.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2) That Government IT contracts are often exclusive, to the detriment
&gt; of competition. This includes moves such as standardising on specific
&gt; desktop or server operating systems and applications. In many
&gt; situations, this means that innappropriate tools are being used simply
&gt; because they are standard, and it certainly reduces competition in the
&gt; industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Examples:
&gt; &lt;again, could people who know please provide relevant egs?&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all contracts are
&gt; designed to foster competition, and encourage the best solution for
&gt; the problem at hand to be used, as opposed to requiring a single
&gt; solution for all classes of problems. Diversity should be encouraged
&gt; in Government IT, for the dual purposes of fostering competition and
&gt; developing a more resiliant infrastructure -- it is an accepted fact
&gt; that while uniformity can bring some cost advantages, it accentuates
&gt; any weaknesses to the point where a single weakness can leave an
&gt; entire organisation vulnerable to the one threat, as has happenned a
&gt; number of times this year (viruses and worms such as NIMDA, Melissa,
&gt; CodeRed and others).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 3) That Government software projects themselves are usually closed
&gt; source. We believe that by encouraging the release of source code for
&gt; Government-sponsored projects under an open licence, not only will the
&gt; community benefit from the use of this code, but the Government will
&gt; benefit from the community's use of this code. This applies
&gt; specifically in cases where the code being developed can have some
&gt; wider application, but even in cases where it won't, there is no
&gt; disadvantage in releasing the code.
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all new (and
&gt; preferably old) software projects undertaken by the Government have
&gt; their code released to the community under an open licence (eg GPL or
&gt; BSD). This is a situation where the collaboration between Government,
&gt; community, and even other Governments would result in a win-win-win
&gt; situation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou,
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [1] A brief introduction to Open Source and Free Software:
&gt; 
&gt; Open Source and Free Software have existed in various forms for about
&gt; as long as software has existed. Much of the original internet was
&gt; developed with Open Source software, and much of the present internet
&gt; runs on it now.
&gt; 
&gt; The differentiating factor between Open and Closed software is the
&gt; license. Closed software is usually released as a "shrinkwrapped"
&gt; product, and the licensee is heavily restricted in how they can use
&gt; it. For example, if the user finds a problem with the software, or
&gt; finds that it requires some modifications to fit their purposes, they
&gt; are prohibited from changing even their own copy of the software. In
&gt; contrast, Open software allows the user free reign on how they use the
&gt; software. In most cases, it comes with no fees, and with the explicit
&gt; condition that if the user is to change the software in any way, they
&gt; must contribute that change back to the community. In this way,
&gt; software benefits from many many people's input, and any problems are
&gt; usually found quickly, and the fixes made available almost
&gt; immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------
&gt; more of my own comments...
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if I actually fixed this up at all, or just modified it.
&gt; People with comments, please feel free to make edits, and I can see if
&gt; they make sense to me :)
&gt; 
&gt; It's still too long (IMHO), and too verbose, possibly too
&gt; jargon-filled...
&gt; 
&gt; I left telstra etc out, as I think that's a topic for a separate
&gt; letter.
&gt; 
&gt; Ditto for education.
&gt; 
&gt; Main thing missing is the EGs...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for criticism last time -- I ignored some of it... 
&gt; 
&gt; Any more comments? Anyone want to re-write this in 1/2 a page?
