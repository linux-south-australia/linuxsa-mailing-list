Bah, I'm dylexic tonight. :-)

Revised post below.  I was always a shocker at proof reading (proof reading?
whats that?)

| I believe there are rpm-get style projects out there, not supported by
Redhat
| though.  (Although you could mirror from ftp.redhat.com every 30 mins and
| get half-kinda-sorta unofficial support :).
|
| Search freshmeat for them - I haven't actually used any though.  With apt
| under debian there also is an option where you can pull down source - and
| compile it, much like ports :)  Of course you haven't got anything
organised
| like BSD does, bless /usr/local... or any of the other plus'ses of ports.
|
| I guess source RPM's are kind of like ports too... err.. kind
| of-sorta-kinda. heh :)
|
| apt rhawks.  I still wish there was an automated way to update a BSD
| system - I've looked at cvsup but haven't found an apt-get dist-upgrade
| style usage for ports/packages.  I know ethically that doing automatic
updates _is_ a bad idea
| (i.e. someone leaks a bad file into the apt servers, f*king over
everybody's
| Debian box), but I currently use apt on a debian-derived commercial distro
I
| sell as gateway boxes.  Its brilliant - we want to update a package, all
we need to do is throw
| it on our servers, and do an apt-get dist-upgrade/install from a big
| fat button on the web interface.  It'll also download the latest packages
| from the debian apt servers... wha'la, upgraded box.
|
| Any ideas anybody?
|
| Maybe if cvsup does this, someone can tell me "cvs for dummies"
| style.  I've only used it very minimally :)
|
| Thanks.
| Ryan
