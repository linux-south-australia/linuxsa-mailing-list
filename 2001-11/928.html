there is nothign technically wrong with the switch statement as everyone pointed out, but as Glen
pointed out, it is bad style.


The "problem" as I see it is that C mixes the philosophy of compiled and intereperated.  For me, I
was fooled by it, untill I looked at it again.  Thing is, it does look ahead to the tightest
match, but it will also fall through to the next case.  If it was a truely interperated thing, it
would match all the mathces in order of apearance (like sh and perl).  A true lookup thing would
only match the tightest match.

I mean I say "should be" only because it cost some time to find the bug.  consider triply nested
switch statements, and some jerk put a default case at the top of one of the inner switches.

Just thought it was interesting.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; waddaya reckon the output would be?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think the thing of interest here is supposed to be the inclusion of
&gt; &gt; the "default" case at the first case, whereas it is traditionally listed
&gt; &gt; last.  C seems to do the logical thing here and do case 1, but other
&gt; &gt; languages (such as Ada) may have different results for equivalent code.
&gt; 
&gt; It's the logical thing if you are used to compiled languages.
&gt; People used to interpreted languages would expect the "default"
&gt; option to be executed.
&gt; 
&gt; The Principle of Least Surprise implies that "default" is
&gt; listed last, as is the case in every coding standard I
&gt; know of.
&gt; 
&gt; The sematics of the "default" label in a "switch" statement are
&gt; 
&gt;    [#5] The integer promotions are performed on the controlling
&gt;    expression.  The constant expression in each case  label  is
&gt;    converted   to   the   promoted   type  of  the  controlling
&gt;    expression.  If  a  converted  value  matches  that  of  the
&gt;    promoted   controlling  expression,  control  jumps  to  the
&gt;    statement following the matched case label.   Otherwise,  if
&gt;    there  is  a  default  label,  control  jumps to the labeled
&gt;    statement.  If no converted case constant expression matches
&gt;    and there is no default label, no part of the switch body is
&gt;    executed.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that the treatment of the "case" as a "goto" label
&gt; is unusual.  Most other languages use the Pascal-style
&gt; CASE where there is no fallthrough.
&gt; 
&gt; The code is particularly dangerous because of the unmarked
&gt; fallthrough on the default option -- a value other than
&gt; 1 or 2 would output
&gt;   default
&gt;   2
&gt; Most lint C code style checkers would pick this up.
