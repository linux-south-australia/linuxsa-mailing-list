Spot on.

We need a marketing approach.

Could we start a discussion group - either 'cc' email based or otherwise 
to take this further?

I am quite excited about this and would really like to see it develop.

&gt; Greetings all,
&gt; 
&gt; the multi prong approach would require several key players on the political
&gt; field to be lobbied by the groups chosen representative.
&gt; 
&gt; If you consider lobbying the minister, the opposition and some of the other
&gt; key members (remember that MrSlop will do the same) for a better deal and
&gt; point out that the "better deal" would benefit all stakeholders, not just the
&gt; ones in the Linux Community.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers

&gt;&gt;I suggest you forward it through sa-auug - this has already been
&gt;&gt;discussed in that group.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bandwidth supply should also be an issue - what if the government can
&gt;&gt;provide some incentive / reason for Hellstra to loosen their iron grip
&gt;&gt;on our national bandwidth supply so we can have more than their &lt;quote -
&gt;&gt;ha ha&gt;  'whopping 400Mb' allowance on their broadband connection!  I
&gt;&gt;could not believe this when I saw the ad - I still suspect it was a joke
&gt;&gt;- especially as they were suggesting that the 'whopping' 400Mb could be
&gt;&gt;used to download movies in a flash, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The problem with Unix / Linux however - is there is NO unified voice -
&gt;&gt;just a bunch of disparate (although highly intelligent and creative)
&gt;&gt;people who can't even agree on correct email format or the best text
&gt;&gt;editor let alone a unified approach to lobbying government.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Richard - your idea speaks volumes of your foresight and leadership
&gt;&gt;qualities.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I suggest we work out a multi-pronged approach - target the minister,
&gt;&gt;media and anything else we can find - with a unified consistent and well
&gt;&gt;researched message.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am happy to speak publically and be interviewed unless someone is more
&gt;&gt;  keen than I am or disagrees with my thoughts.  I would never speak on
&gt;&gt;behalf of the Linux 'community' without prior consent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Couldn't be much worse!  Who would you tip (remembering that the

&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually, the article tips Abbott... Whoever it turns out to be, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;wouldn't hurt to write some sort of letter from LinuxSA, signed by as
&gt;&gt;&gt;many as can sign it, informing the minister of concerns about
&gt;&gt;&gt;government policy that closes out open source solutions for govt
&gt;&gt;&gt;contracts, as well as open source clients with govt services...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I could write such a letter (short, 1/2 a page or so) if anyone thinks
&gt;&gt;&gt;it's worthwhile... and I would suggest that I send it to the list, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone who wants to can reply offlist to me, and I'll add your names
&gt;&gt;&gt;to the list of names on it... yah?
