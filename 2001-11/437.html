&gt; well John's example here was GMH so not the SA govt EDS contract
&gt; but presumably another EDS contract, anyway why do they have to know
&gt; about it?

ah -- wrote that sentence in two bites... don't worry about it :)

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; (corporate bureaucracy and crap like that happens everywhere,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it just needs someone to say "that's bullshit" and do their own
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing regardless)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It happens, but it's always a political issue. There's always
&gt; &gt; repercussions somewhere...
&gt; 
&gt; well I guess it depends on your management, but in that case
&gt; I'd guess that if EDS found out the person who introduced this
&gt; "foreign" piece of equipment might have got their knuckles
&gt; rapped, but when (not if) the disk crashed and they pulled out
&gt; their backup and all was hunky dorey somehow I don't think 
&gt; there would have been much knuckle rapping then.
&gt; 
&gt; I realise you're talking about the letter of the law/contract
&gt; and I'm talking about just doing what's best and bugger stupid
&gt; rules, I guess it's just a matter of different attitudes.

I've always been they type to just do it, but there's always someone
higher up who has their kingdom resting on you co-operating...
