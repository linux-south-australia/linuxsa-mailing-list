&gt; Thought I'd just drop this in for now, but if I get a chance over the
&gt; weekend I'll post some of the highlights of the AUUG Security Symposium
&gt; (it good general *nix stuff)
&gt;
&gt; One of the presenters from ESEC delivered a great talk and stats. on
&gt; wireless networks 40/128 encryp. with some startling results.  Although
&gt; he has no intention of making public his talk or his findings, one thing
&gt; was quite evident. Wireless is in need of some serious attention re
&gt; security. Even 128 is easily overcome with a little research on the net
&gt; and and some tools.  One particularly interesting slide mapped the USA
&gt; with flags of open wireless networks based on GPS locations.  There was
&gt; a long line of flags from East to West coast, almost, and when asked
&gt; about the snake-like flag layout, he pointed out that Highway 80 nicely
&gt; made its way along the flag line.  Seems like drive by shootings are not
&gt; the only type of drive byes going on.
&gt;
&gt; Wireless, sure, but take a good hard look before you use if for serious
&gt; business applications.
&gt;
&gt; The ease of how to crack the things was.. well "kids-play"
&gt;

Steve,

Exactly the point of my article
(<A HREF="http://www.acnsnet.com/~slydder/stories/op/storiesView/sid/47/">http://www.acnsnet.com/~slydder/stories/op/storiesView/sid/47/</A>).  I have
even added some more information since the last time I posted about it here.
Including the possible use of CIPE, which I will be testing as soon as I can
get the wifi cards back from a friend, which uses encrypted UDP instead of
encrypted TCP as in IPsec.

The point of using SSH across an already working IPsec/VPN connection was
due to the possibility of the encryption being busted in the first place (
as far as I have been informed ).  Although I have yet to experiment with
this type of connection I hope to do so in the near future.

If anyone has any actual cases of IPsec being busted and/or the benefits of
using SSH or some other method to further secure a connection I would be
very pleased to hear of it.
