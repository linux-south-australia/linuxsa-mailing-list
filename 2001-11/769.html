Richard,

Just a few notes...

&gt; 
&gt; Dear Senator Alston (Minister for Information Technology and
&gt; Telecommunications),
&gt; 
&gt; [can someone advise on the correct way of addressing? "Dear" sounds
&gt; too cosy to me, but maybe it's correct]

I was going to sugesst the use the words "Mr Luddite" but I will refrain.  :)
&gt; 

George snips a large chuck of text from here...

&gt; 3) That Government software projects themselves are usually closed
&gt; source. We believe that by encouraging the release of source code for
&gt; Government-sponsored projects under an open licence, not only will the
&gt; community benefit from the use of this code, but the Government will
&gt; benefit from the community's use of this code. This applies
&gt; specifically in cases where the code being developed can have some
&gt; wider application, but even in cases where it won't, there is no
&gt; disadvantage in releasing the code.
&gt; 
&gt; We request that the Government adopt a policy that all new (and
&gt; preferably old) software projects undertaken by the Government have
&gt; their code released to the community under an open licence (eg GPL or
&gt; BSD). This is a situation where the collaboration between Government,
&gt; community, and even other Governments would result in a win-win-win
&gt; situation.

Perhaps say you should say Australian Federal and State Governments.. 

Otherwise you could be referring to some other governments (foriegn
perhaps??). 
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou,
&gt; 
&gt; Sincerely....
&gt; 
&gt; [1] A brief introduction to Open Source and Free Software:
&gt; 
&gt; Open Source and Free Software have existed in various forms for about
&gt; as long as software has existed. Much of the original internet was
&gt; developed with Open Source software, and much of the present internet
&gt; runs on it now.
&gt; 
&gt; The differentiating factor between Open and Closed software is the
&gt; license. Closed software is usually released as a "shrinkwrapped"
&gt; product, and the licensee is heavily restricted in how they can use
&gt; it. For example, if the user finds a problem with the software, or
&gt; finds that it requires some modifications to fit their purposes, they
&gt; are prohibited from changing even their own copy of the software. In
&gt; contrast, Open software allows the user free reign on how they use the
&gt; software. In most cases, it comes with no fees, and with the explicit
&gt; condition that if the user is to change the software in any way, they
&gt; must contribute that change back to the community. In this way,
&gt; software benefits from many many people's input, and any problems are
&gt; usually found quickly, and the fixes made available almost
&gt; immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------
&gt; more of my own comments...
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if I actually fixed this up at all, or just modified it.
&gt; People with comments, please feel free to make edits, and I can see if
&gt; they make sense to me :)
&gt; 
&gt; It's still too long (IMHO), and too verbose, possibly too
&gt; jargon-filled...
&gt; 
&gt; I left telstra etc out, as I think that's a topic for a separate
&gt; letter.
&gt; 
&gt; Ditto for education.
&gt; 
&gt; Main thing missing is the EGs...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for criticism last time -- I ignored some of it...
&gt; 
&gt; Any more comments? Anyone want to re-write this in 1/2 a page?
