I just saw this article in ZDnet
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0</A>%2C4586%2C5098989%2C00.html

I had to share the wisdom of microsoft with you .. hah .. wisdom ...

But there are hidden costs to Linux, Microsoft argues. "I think a lot of
customers are lured by the apparent low price of Linux," said Doug Miller,
director of competitive strategy for Microsoft's Windows division. "They
don't have a real issue with Linux, but it ends up costing them in the long
run."

With Linux, customers "end up being in the operating systems business,"
managing software updates and security patches while making sure the
multitude of software packages don't conflict with each other," Miller said.
"That's the job of a software vendor like Microsoft."

Hmm .. ok .. so he is obviously talking about a different Microsoft to who
we think of when we hear "Micro$soft" , oh Mr Gate's, another security issue
you say, nasty people can take over your server and chew up your bandwidth
you say. Thats not going to cost you more than Lnux and Apache who have had
a long lasting reputation of Security and reliability ..... Oh hang on Mr
Gates .. i have to reboot my windows machine, gee i've done well, its been
on for 30 mins and hasn't crashed or slowed down ... BSOD


He he he
