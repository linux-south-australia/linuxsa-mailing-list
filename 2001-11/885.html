Ian,
From personal experience (having finished extensive renovations) I
basically wired new and existing with Cat5 for phones and net access. It's
a star shaped topology with a switched hub in 'The games room' and rj45
sockets pretty much in every room (I did forget one for the Fridge tho).
DSL modem via linux router router lives in the games room going into the
hub and the house is wired for net access.

I left coax stuff as per standard TV with only 2 outlets where the Tv's are.

My needs were specific as I plan on staying in the house a long time so I
knew where things would go but whilst it may sound like an overkill placing
an RJ45 outlet along side a power point would allow satisfy most peoples
needs I guess.

Regards

Evan

&gt;
&gt;What do you suggest as a minimum for a new or refurbished house to be 
&gt;wired for the net?
&gt;
&gt;I was thinking of specifiying CAT 5 instead of nomal phone cabling. 
&gt;Maybe specifying satellite-capable cabling for the TV connection so 
&gt;they can handle broadband. What else should I be suggesting to the City?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, Ian
