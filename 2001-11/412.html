&gt; Hey - lay off EDS unless you have your facts straight.

my experience with EDS and the State Govt contract has been mostly
negative. No, I don't think EDS are evil, I think the contract is a
dud. Any contract where you have no choice but to pay external staff
$600-$800 to apply patches to Solaris machines, per machine, is a dud
contract. There are many other places where the contract falls down,
but it's just not worth going in to... (yes, there are departments who
find EDS to be a plus, but there are also departments for which the
statewide contract doesn't work...)

Also, remember that everything that is said about EDS is political,
not factual. Govt will defend it to the hilt, because it was their
idea. If the Libs remain in, it will get re-signed with little change,
despite its shortcomings simply because major changes would be an
admission that something was wrong in the first place.

And don't think for a minute that DAIS are neutral :)

However, this thread is not about EDS (or even the state govt), it's
about the opportunity for lobbying that a new ministership will
present...
