Didn't EDS give GM US$500m in 1996 to go its own way?
Click, clack, database seach, ..., here we are:

&gt; FOR RELEASE:  Immediately, Friday, June 7, 1996 
&gt; CONTACT:      Todd Carstensen, General Motors
&gt; Phone:        (212) 418-6385
&gt; CONTACT:      Tony Good, EDS
&gt; Phone:        (214) 605-6777
&gt; 
&gt; EDS SPLIT-OFF FROM GM COMPLETED TODAY
&gt; 
&gt; NEW YORK -- General Motors Corporation and EDS (Electronic Data
&gt; Systems) announced that the split-off of EDS from General Motors
&gt; was completed today after receiving the requisite vote from GM
&gt; stockholders. Stockholders also voted to approve the "Amended
&gt; Incentive Plan" for EDS. 
&gt; 
&gt; EDS common stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange
&gt; on Monday, June 10, 1996, under the symbol "EDS." The stock will also
&gt; trade on the London Stock Exchange beginning on June 11, 1996. GM
&gt; Class E common stock will cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange
&gt; at the close of business today. Each share of GM Class E common stock
&gt; will be exchanged for one share of EDS common stock.
&gt; 
&gt; In August 1995, GM announced it was pursuing a split-off of EDS to
&gt; holders of GM?s Class E common stock in a tax-free transaction. In
&gt; December, GM announced that it had received a ruling from the U.S.
&gt; Internal Revenue Service stating that the contemplated split-off
&gt; would be tax free to GM and its common stockholders for U.S. federal
&gt; income tax purposes. In April 1996, GM announced that its Board of
&gt; Directors had approved a proposal for the EDS split-off subject to
&gt; obtaining consent of GM stockholders.
