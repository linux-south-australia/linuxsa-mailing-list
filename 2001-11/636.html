Hi.

use one every day. It's not very big, you must be quite small! Mine fits
under the seat in a 737-700 even when it's loaded with laptop and enough
clobber for an interstate 4-5 day trip. (I do pack light tho..) I can't
see how it could be much smaller.

Have you tried emailing STM and asking them?

Michael

&gt; what did people think of these?
&gt; i went to have a look, they looked nice but too big and tank like.. (Esp
&gt; as i am quite small)
&gt; 
&gt; does anyone have any other options for slim line backpacks with padding?
&gt; 
&gt; i am using a mambo one still, with no zip (!) which is slightly worrying
&gt; however the tanks that STM had were not suitable for my slim line! :)
&gt; 
&gt; And i wasn't keen on a satchel --&gt; too uncomfortable for long walking?

&gt; &gt; Just a quick note that might interest those of us who lug laptops to and
&gt; &gt; from work each day.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I saw an article in the "Computers" section of the Sunday Mail (or was
&gt; &gt; it the Saturday Advertiser? I don't remember) talking about these STM
&gt; &gt; bags. According to the article, they're pretty ergonomic as well as not
&gt; &gt; looking like a laptop bag.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I went down to NextByte on Glen Osmond Road. I liked them so much, I
&gt; &gt; bought one.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to hold everything nicely. It looks like your average backpack,
&gt; &gt; except with a heap of really cumfy padding everywhere.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The one I purchased looks like

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At $85-00, they're not too bad (when compared to other laptop bags).
