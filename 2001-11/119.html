Hi Andy,

Perhaps I should have added the 'fun' I had with it, and in a hurry as 
I was due to be giving a demo of what was supposed to be a working 
system.

The night before was bad enough because of the already reported fault 
of not being able to address the CD drive (who didn't check that before 
signing off on the release?) which cost me ages of frustration till 
remembering an answer appearing here just the other day. The solution 
was simple, the cause was just stupid!

As I mentioned I tried a minimum install, I only had a 1.2 G drive. I 
wanted to be light so I ignored KDE and GNOME and used fvwm, AWFUL!

So I tried to put KDE into the system. Son told me to select Update so 
I did. Next thing it is coming up with the partitions. Funny, only 2? I 
had put in an 40 M '/boot', a 120 M Swap and the rest was '/'. It 
showed nothing about a swap and wanted to use 248 M from the remaining 
system to make up a new Swap?? No way Hose A.

Out with the drive and in with a Mandrake 8.1 (that I had prepared 
earlier) and on to the demo which went well.

How do I feel about RH 7.2? When it is fixed come back and talk to me. 

Cheers, Ian
