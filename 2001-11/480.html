&gt;Well like I have been saying to everyone - target the agency account 
&gt;managers - they call the shots.
&gt;
&gt;The order the pizzas and EDS delivers.  They just blame the pizza 
&gt;delivery boys when they order the wrong pizza.

Agency a/c managers call the shots in a very indirect way, witness our
attempts to have Linux approved for use in specific areas in our 
environment.  Fortunately we have only 1 site out of 11 that are under
the EDS contract, so in 10 sites we are able to do what we like (and do).
(theyre Wave4 sites for those who know the lingo)

The unfortunate part from the agency a/c managers point of view is that
they have their hands and feet tied up by DAIS, so even if they want to
call the shots and have a watertight case for doing so, they still can't
get anywhere because of the policies that DAIS have in place.

To give EDS a deserved rap, most of the people we have dealt with have been
ok,
particularly at the tech level, they have some highly skilled people on
the ground, however they're as much tied up by government policy as the
Agency a/c managers are, so in many ways the perceived issues with EDS
aren't their fault directly.

Also, the experiences I have had with EDS have been from a regional site, 
so YMMV in metro situations, because of the distances involved we don't 
tend to see many EDS reps about the place :o)  

&lt;rant&gt;
What sucks badly is that we do not have forward-thinking people making 
the decisions where it matters most.  We're stuck with policies that 
suit the technology that was available 5 years ago, and decision-makers
are too gutless to admit that its time to rethink their policies, just 
in case they look like idiots for screwing up in the first place
&lt;/rant&gt;

(of course these are my opinions only and not the opinions of my employers)
;o)
