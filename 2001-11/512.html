Hi Grey

I have access to the equipment which would allow you to do this, the but the
costs a in my option a little high. The major problems is hardening of the
box for the weather and provision the power.

I have access to some single board computer and you could use the compact
flash port and a compact flash 802.11 like
<A HREF="http://www.dlink.com/products/DigitalHome/Mobile/dcf650w/">http://www.dlink.com/products/DigitalHome/Mobile/dcf650w/</A>

The advantage of a SBC is that they are low power normal require no fan and
can be easily mounted in a small weathered sealed box. Another advantage of
a SBC is that most have I/O wires which you could use to trigger the gate.

I'd think with a battery and a solar panel of the right size you could run
this thing with no external power wiring.

Mike

p.s. could you please send me your updated sm200d code ?

Subject: Off topic? Wireless gate control


&gt; I'm about to replace the gate to my driveway with an electrically
&gt; controlled one.  For those of you who don't know the place, the gate
&gt; is about 130 metres from the house, which means that I need to think
&gt; about communication between the gate and the house (somebody arrives,
&gt; presses a bell, I open from inside).
&gt;
&gt; I have a number of quotes from companies specializing in this sort of
&gt; thing.  It's clear they're pretty low-tech: they want to connect via
&gt; cable, which is both expensive and restrictive, since it would just
&gt; end in one or more units somewhere inside the house.  I asked about
&gt; wireless connections, but the best they can offer has a range of about
&gt; 60 metres.
&gt;
&gt; I think a better solution would be a wireless network connection.
&gt; I've checked: yes, my 802.11b network is still reachable at that
&gt; distance, even without an antenna.  My idea would be to put some kind
&gt; of box down there which controls the gate and also provides a voice
&gt; link, possibly video.  I'd be interested in any thoughts you may have
&gt; about this concept.
