&gt;OPEN-SOURCE ORIGINALS
&gt;
&gt;Posted November 21, 2001 01:01 PM  Pacific Time
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;WHEN I BEGAN writing this column in October, I promised
&gt;myself I would try not to waste time bashing
&gt;Microsoft. There are two reasons for this. First, it's
&gt;like shooting fish in a barrel. With a bazooka. It is
&gt;just too easy. Microsoft does enough things badly that
&gt;there is no challenge in poking at them. Just say
&gt;"Code Red" or "I Love You" and IT managers tremble at
&gt;the memories.
&gt;
&gt;Second, I did not begin using Linux in 1995 because I
&gt;hated Microsoft. I began using Linux because it
&gt;provided me with better functionality on my PC
&gt;desktop. Open source is not merely an ABM (Anything
&gt;But Microsoft) solution. Open source provides some
&gt;excellent solutions that can be evaluated on their own
&gt;merits.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, something happened recently that demands
&gt;I address the relationship between Microsoft and the
&gt;open-source community. It seems that Bill Gates sees
&gt;Microsoft as the chief benefactor of open source. A
&gt;recent Seattle Times article quotes Mr. Gates as
&gt;saying, "Really, the reason you see open source there
&gt;at all is because we came in and said there should be
&gt;a platform that's identical with millions and millions
&gt;of machines."
&gt;
&gt;Really? Many of us older folks in this industry
&gt;remember seeing Bill Gates' name for the first time in
&gt;the now infamous document, "An Open Letter to
&gt;Hobbyists," by William Henry Gates III dated February
&gt;3, 1976. In it, Gates tells the users of Micro-Soft's
&gt;(that is the spelling in the letter) Altair BASIC to
&gt;stop distributing the software without paying for it.
&gt;Mr. Gates accuses the user community of believing
&gt;that, "Hardware must be paid for, but software is
&gt;something to share."
&gt;
&gt;How interesting. Before the birth of the PC, the roots
&gt;of the open-source community were already established.
&gt;In fact, the notion of paying for software was a
&gt;largely new concept to the home computer user
&gt;community.
&gt;
&gt;In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the beginning of
&gt;the GNU Project, his effort to create a free
&gt;Unix-compatible operating system. GNU became the
&gt;foundation of the free software movement, which later
&gt;became the foundation of the open-source movement.
&gt;Stallman's initial efforts had nothing to do with the
&gt;PC at all.
&gt;
&gt;The PC doesn't make a significant appearance in the
&gt;open-source time line until 1991, when Linus Torvalds
&gt;announced a new project to create a Unix-like
&gt;operating system to run on the Intel 80386 platform.
&gt;But the project quickly began to grow past the PC
&gt;architecture, and in 1994 the ports to the DEC Alpha
&gt;platform began. Today, Linux is available on an
&gt;amazing number of platforms. Microsoft, on the other
&gt;hand, has had trouble going much beyond the PC architecture.
&gt;
&gt;Was open source born of the PC? No. Did the spread of
&gt;open source benefit from the creation of a low-cost,
&gt;open architecture PC? Sure. And for that, credit
&gt;should be given where it is due.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks, IBM.
