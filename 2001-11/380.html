What do you mean? How'd you want it to display?

&gt; The LDAP doeswn't work very well.  I've played for about and hour trying to
&gt; get it to go.  a port scan showed that i have a ldapssl on port 636 and a
&gt; ldap on 389.  389 returns no error but no results either when i say use
&gt; anonymouse or authenticate.  636 returns an error Application "Wombat"
&gt; (process 15265) has crashed due to a segment fault even before i get a
&gt; chance to type in a search string...

On my system, it seems that Evolution hasn't been linked against the
OpenLDAP libraries. I think they're still using OpenLDAP, but I'm not
certain. I remember there being some sort of licensing issue
surrounding Evolution and OpenLDAP.

Executing ldd `which evolution-addressbook` | grep -i ldap on my
FreeBSD system yields no results. What do you get?

The Evolution 0.15 configure script has two ldap options --
'--with-openldap' or '--with-static-ldap'. Perhaps they're statically
linking Evolution's LDAP stuff.

&gt; For comparision, i've got outlook express on XP using IMAP sucessfully as
&gt; well, and also LDAP works fine, returning both name/email searches and also
&gt; substring searches....

It also does a great job of spreading viruses and other nasty things.

&gt; Any comments or things to try out ppl?

See Above. I have my doubts as to wheather or not Evolution is even
trying to connect to the LDAP directory. It should have some of the
fere directories listed (BigFoot etc). Try using one of those to test
the LDAP support itself.

Note that you may have to be a little patient for the results to come
through from the free servers. I've noticed considerable delays when
I've used them before.
