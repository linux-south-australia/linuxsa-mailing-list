Although, real mozilla works fine, so perhaps they only serve to "known"
browsers, and dont have opera listed or something? I guess its not as
sinister as I first thought, just dodgy. 

Further checks, opera reporting mozilla 4.76 or 5. no debug, but error.
opera reporting mozilla 3.0 - debug info (that says it works). I guess
opera must be somehow lacking, and so is thier debug code :(

&gt;    The following is debug information. Quote this information in any
&gt; correspondance, to help us to help you: 
&gt;    Client Browser is: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Linux 2.4.13
&gt; i686) Opera 5.0  [en]. This browser is Cookies Capable.

&gt;  
&gt; How come: 
&gt;  
&gt; a) I only get debug info when I claim to be using MSIE? 
&gt; b) The debug information says everything works fine? 
&gt;  
&gt; www.netcraft.com/whats says The site www.harveynorman.com.au is running
&gt; Microsoft-IIS/4.0 on NT4/Windows 98.  
&gt;  
&gt; Looks to me like a false failure when the word "linux" is detected as your
&gt; OS description, and then the debug info that shows it all really works is
&gt; hidden from non MSIE users...
