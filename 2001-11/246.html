Quoting Anthony Symons &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ant@sa.pracom.com.au">ant@sa.pracom.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Evolution RC1? 
&gt;  
&gt; I have been running 0.15 which has been fine (and indeed had to
&gt; reinstall it to send this mail). 
&gt;  
&gt; It seems the mail component doesnt load on RC1. Here is the output from
&gt; the term where I ran it. Any ideas about he OAFIID stuff? Or where to
&gt; look for more info? I think it is what is stopping the mail component
&gt; from running, or perhaps it is cause by the mail component failing. Ieft
&gt; all the other libs installed when I went back a version and 0.15 works,
&gt; so its a problem with evolution rather than the helper libs. 

While I don't have RC1 in front of me right now, my guess is that you've got 
some conflicts with your existing GNOME setup (assuming you have installed the 
right versions of supporting packages), maybe in gconf or oaf.

Try starting evolution with a clean GNOME setup (ie either foreach i (*.gnom*, 
*.gconf*, .evo*, Evo*); mv $i $i.old or another clean account or similar) and 
see where that gets you.

I know it's frustrating, but so far evolution has been only in beta so far, and 
so some APIs may have changed in icky ways.  I had a similar problem with xst at 
one point.
