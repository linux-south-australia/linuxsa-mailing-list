Quoting Wayne Simes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:wlsimes@tell.net.au">wlsimes@tell.net.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I loaded XP a couple of days and first impressions where quite good. 
[snip]
&gt; Until ..........
[snip] 
&gt; I noticed a couple of hours ago that my machine, with XP, seems to be
&gt; communicating with the web continuously, well regularly I should say.
[snip]
&gt; Does anyone know what's going on with XP other than the usual rumours ?
[snip]
&gt; Does anyone know the registry keys to look at to verify if it is in fact
&gt; the Nimba virus ?
[snip]

Still waiting...  Where is the open source-related question?  Is there such a 
dearth of windows users groups in Adelaide that _LinuxSA_ is the only group you 
can turn to for advice?

My [Linux] advice to you is install Redhat 7.2 with evolution 0.99.2 on top and 
trash Windows XP.  If that won't suffice, my [windows] advice to you is to block 
ports 25, 80, 109, 110, 137, 139, 143 and 220 (any others anyone?) from your 
Windows box's IP at your linux firewall so next week's exploit won't affect the 
latest from Redmond.  As per usual with a non-open source OS, you can't fix the 
problems, and you can't pay the vendor to fix them either.  You just need to 
live with it, or move to something better.

May the source be with you!

Michael...
