1) Yes, works fairly well

dvgrab is great for capturing via firewire from a minidv camcorder.
things like mainactor and broadcast n stuff works for editting your
videotape.. i haven't figured out broadcast, so i'd reccommend mainactor for
the moment.

2)

Hmm.. Not sure.. just make sure you get something that supports dv-in and
dv-out (not all support dv-in, surprisingly.. something to do with tax
reasons i believe???)
I have a Sony TRV6, which i'm happy with. However, I think the Canon cameras
have a progressive scan option, which would be good for PC-based stuff.
(otherwise you get interlacing, and have to de-interlace it for the PC)

3)

SOrry, haven't tried that at all. No memory stick on my camera.

&gt; Hi all, with the arrival of "Junior" in the family I'm looking at capturing
&gt; those 'treasured moments' forever on video, and was wondering if others are
&gt; doing so with open-source.  So:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Anyone out there doing Digital Video editting with open-source?
&gt; 2) Anyone with digital camera recommendations?
&gt; 3) Anyone accessing Sony's memory stick with open-source?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
