Actually, apt and rpm are two different types of things I believe.

rpm is a package format, roughly equivilent to deb format where as apt-get is 
a management tool that uses dpkg (or something) to actually install the 
package.

Mandrake has a utility called urpmi which tries to be an apt-get for rpm, 
although it is a year or two younger, but it is maturing quite well so far.  
Mandrake also has the connectiva apt-get port in their unsupported lists (I 
think it's unsupported) so you can try that out too.

Here is a short info page on it:

Cheers.

&gt; What's your (Redhat's/Mandrake's) plans for future package management
&gt; system upgrades? Will RPM be made as usable as apt (or even BSD's
&gt; ports?) ?

&gt; &gt; Hiya Everyone,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On Tech-Junkie I'm currently doing a RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.1
&gt; &gt; comparative review. The review will be centred around both distro's
&gt; &gt; usability - I'm going to do this article different in that I'll be
&gt; &gt; looking at how good both are as desktop OSes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For some interest, I've got Marty Wesley (Red Hat's OS Product Manager)
&gt; &gt; and Mathilde Kraskovetz (Mandrake's Communication & PR person) to answer
&gt; &gt; any and all questions regarding their most recent products. I'm not sure
&gt; &gt; yet whether to include their responses with the comparative review since
&gt; &gt; it may unduly bias the article - I could always launch it separately.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, since many of you seem like you live and breath Linux, are there
&gt; &gt; any questions YOU'd like to ask to both of them?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;
