Hey - lay off EDS unless you have your facts straight.

An article in The Australian was VEHEMENTLY reputed by DAIS - the one 
that claimed EDS was overcharging - that was called MARKET PRICE 
ADJUSTMENT on mainframe services as costs in that area have dropped so 
fast in the previous years.  EDS is bound by it's contract to promote 
local businesses - something that people conveniently forget sometimes 
when they trash EDS.  EDS has no choice but to use local businesses as 
hardware suppliers for the SAG contract which leave prices slightly more 
expensive than if purchased through the manufacturer directly.  The 
other thing is that EDS must remain ISO-9001 certified or they lose 
their contract - bang gone.  How many other SA businesses are audited 
EVERY YEAR for ISO certification?  Does anyone here even know what ISO 
certification entails?  It certainly does not leave much room for 
stuffing around - let's put it that way.

EDS is not the problem - it is this insane partnership with Microsoft 
and the brainwashing that they have conducted so effectively.

We should know our enemy - sure - but let's also remain sure of who our 
enemy is.

For your information - EDS has experimented with open source solutions - 
but the government was not remotely interested.  Why don't you blame 
them instead?  EDS only supplies what the customer asks for.

&gt;&gt;hmmm... that was longer than I meant, and may not be easily read by
&gt;&gt;politician types... also, I didn't touch on telecommunications issues
&gt;&gt;-- I think that should be separate anyway, as we could easily get far
&gt;&gt;broader support for that one...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyway, IMHO, the above are the three main Open Source related IT
&gt;&gt;issues facing government... anyone care to comment?

&gt; 
&gt; Can I suggest a brief introduction to the concept of open source. Just
&gt; because you are writing to an IT minister, doesn't necessarily mean that
&gt; your reader understands anything about IT. If your reader doesn't have an
&gt; appreciation for the concept, your letter will get binned pretty quickly.
&gt; I'm sure that a significant portion of the problem is that decision makers
&gt; aren't being advised that there are alternatives, either through lack of
&gt; knowledge on the part of the advisors, or through job protection
&gt; strategies (or EDS protection strategies ;).
