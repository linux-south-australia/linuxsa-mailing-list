<H1>Off topic?  Wireless gate control</H1>

I'm about to replace the gate to my driveway with an electrically
controlled one.  For those of you who don't know the place, the gate
is about 130 metres from the house, which means that I need to think
about communication between the gate and the house (somebody arrives,
presses a bell, I open from inside).

I have a number of quotes from companies specializing in this sort of
thing.  It's clear they're pretty low-tech: they want to connect via
cable, which is both expensive and restrictive, since it would just
end in one or more units somewhere inside the house.  I asked about
wireless connections, but the best they can offer has a range of about
60 metres.

I think a better solution would be a wireless network connection.
I've checked: yes, my 802.11b network is still reachable at that
distance, even without an antenna.  My idea would be to put some kind
of box down there which controls the gate and also provides a voice
link, possibly video.  I'd be interested in any thoughts you may have
about this concept.
