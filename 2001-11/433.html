&gt; &gt; so why didn't someone (the person looking after these computers?)

&gt; 
&gt; There's penalty clauses in contracts this long. Why do you think it's
&gt; so secretive?

well John's example here was GMH so not the SA govt EDS contract
but presumably another EDS contract, anyway why do they have to know
about it?
 
&gt; &gt; (corporate bureaucracy and crap like that happens everywhere,
&gt; &gt; it just needs someone to say "that's bullshit" and do their own
&gt; &gt; thing regardless)
&gt; 
&gt; It happens, but it's always a political issue. There's always
&gt; repercussions somewhere...

well I guess it depends on your management, but in that case
I'd guess that if EDS found out the person who introduced this
"foreign" piece of equipment might have got their knuckles
rapped, but when (not if) the disk crashed and they pulled out
their backup and all was hunky dorey somehow I don't think 
there would have been much knuckle rapping then.

I realise you're talking about the letter of the law/contract
and I'm talking about just doing what's best and bugger stupid
rules, I guess it's just a matter of different attitudes.
