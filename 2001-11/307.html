Jarrod.

You may have already had a look at it, and I must admit, that I have not yet 
had a chance to look at it working with exchange, but the Insight client from 
Bynari looks quite promising.

<A HREF="http://www.bynari.net/">http://www.bynari.net/</A>

(P.S. I'm an External student at UniSA ML.  Would you by any chance know if 
there is there any plans to allow access for native clients of any sort, even 
Outlook, from outside the Uni network (ie in the wild of the internet) to the 
exchange email system.  I'm rather sick and tired of being forced to use the 
web frontend from home, and being an external student, I'm always connecting 
from home.  The web front is ok for the occasional connection, but I don't 
find it anywhere near 100% reliable unless you're using IE.  And being on 
Mandrake, I don't often use IE :)  )

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah - but coudl Evolution talk to an Exchange server.  That would rock
&gt; &gt; &gt; if it could as I could do without the viri and other crap that go with
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows and still work from home.  Maybe one day I could bring a Linux
&gt; &gt; &gt; laptop in to work and use that!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Given that, as Michael said, Exchange can talk IMAP (among other
&gt; &gt; protocols) and Evolution can talk IMAP, I think the answer would be
&gt; &gt; yes... as andrew said in the mail you originally responded to... :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; rr
&gt;
&gt; That depends on the functionality that your using inside Exchange.  We use
&gt; the Meeting Organiser stuff a fair bit, for example, to organise meetings
&gt; around staff based on 5 campuses (one is a quick plane flight away).
&gt; Most mail clients are starting to support IMAP for mail reading and LDAP
&gt; for address book lookups (Pine 4.40 does).
&gt;
&gt; The day a good UNIX mail reader supports native Exchange talk, Outlook is
&gt; history!
