Thought I'd just drop this in for now, but if I get a chance over the 
weekend I'll post some of the highlights of the AUUG Security Symposium 
(it good general *nix stuff)

One of the presenters from ESEC delivered a great talk and stats. on 
wireless networks 40/128 encryp. with some startling results.  Although 
he has no intention of making public his talk or his findings, one thing 
was quite evident. Wireless is in need of some serious attention re 
security. Even 128 is easily overcome with a little research on the net 
and and some tools.  One particularly interesting slide mapped the USA 
with flags of open wireless networks based on GPS locations.  There was 
a long line of flags from East to West coast, almost, and when asked 
about the snake-like flag layout, he pointed out that Highway 80 nicely 
made its way along the flag line.  Seems like drive by shootings are not 
the only type of drive byes going on.

Wireless, sure, but take a good hard look before you use if for serious 
business applications.

The ease of how to crack the things was.. well "kids-play"
