I just don't like EDS being trashed without factual evidence.

Those charges you mention are a T&M based charge.  $600 - $800 would 
normally refer to a whole day's work - and patches are covered (under 
the best of my knowledge) as part of normal service unless the agency 
has decided to forego EDS support or go for purchasing their own servers 
or something.  I am not sure that EDS makes a killing from the SAG 
contract - all indications are that they don't.

&gt;&gt;Hey - lay off EDS unless you have your facts straight.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; my experience with EDS and the State Govt contract has been mostly
&gt; negative. No, I don't think EDS are evil, I think the contract is a
&gt; dud. Any contract where you have no choice but to pay external staff
&gt; $600-$800 to apply patches to Solaris machines, per machine, is a dud
&gt; contract. There are many other places where the contract falls down,
&gt; but it's just not worth going in to... (yes, there are departments who
&gt; find EDS to be a plus, but there are also departments for which the
&gt; statewide contract doesn't work...)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, remember that everything that is said about EDS is political,
&gt; not factual. Govt will defend it to the hilt, because it was their
&gt; idea. If the Libs remain in, it will get re-signed with little change,
&gt; despite its shortcomings simply because major changes would be an
&gt; admission that something was wrong in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; And don't think for a minute that DAIS are neutral :)
&gt; 
&gt; However, this thread is not about EDS (or even the state govt), it's
&gt; about the opportunity for lobbying that a new ministership will
&gt; present...
