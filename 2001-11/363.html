Can I suggest a brief introduction to the concept of open source. Just
because you are writing to an IT minister, doesn't necessarily mean that
your reader understands anything about IT. If your reader doesn't have an
appreciation for the concept, your letter will get binned pretty quickly.
I'm sure that a significant portion of the problem is that decision makers
aren't being advised that there are alternatives, either through lack of
knowledge on the part of the advisors, or through job protection
strategies (or EDS protection strategies ;).
