Hi

I loaded XP a couple of days and first impressions where quite good. It
seemed a lot more stable that 95 98 and NT 4. It is definetly a lot quicker
at loading programs, and genral browsing of the web, the pages load a lot
faster. All in all I would consider myself to be a lot happier running XP
than I have been with 98 or NT 4.

Until ..........

I noticed a couple of hours ago that my machine, with XP, seems to be
communicating with the web continuously, well regularly I should say. I
have a linux box with an external modem as my gateway, and this workstation
connected to it via a small hub. Down the botton right hand corner near the
clock is the network connection icon which lights up when data is being
transmitted. As I watch now, it is lighting up for about ten seconds
sending about 5 - 10 packets per second. I can also hear the hard drive
heads moving. Looking across the room at the modem, the transmit light is
almost continuosly on, with the receive flashing on the rare occasion. The
strange thing is that I haven't used the web browser for about an hour, and
the e-mail program doesn't automatically check for mail, I don't run icq
and msn messenger is turned off. So without my consent XP is transmitting
something, oh yeah, unless it's in the terms and conditions, smart one
Microsoft.

I disable the Network interface in XP and it stops, of course, when I turn
it back on again the transmissions start again.

Call me paraniod, but this workstation is sending out something, somewhere
on the web.


Does anyone know what's going on with XP other than the usual rumours ?


At the time of writing this, I was made aware that I may have been infected
with the Nimba virus, I have only used this machine on the web for about 4
hours. My current virus scanner is Norton 2001, which I have been told
won't work with XP, apparently I need Norton 2002. For this reason I don't
have a virus scanner loaded. So much for XP's firewall doing the job.

Does anyone know the registry keys to look at to verify if it is in fact
the Nimba virus ?
