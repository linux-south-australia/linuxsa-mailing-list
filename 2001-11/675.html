Dale,

&gt; Michael, do you still donate the cost of the CD's you burn to Debian
&gt; as you did in the past? I would like to see the money go to the
&gt; Debian project.

Yeah sure.. why not..

Actually the story goes like this... when we (Richard Russell and I)
were burning the original CDs I wanted to do them at cost (I didn't
want to make a profit) but Richard wanted to allow for some overheads
incase we made too many coasters.  So we decided to charge twice cost
(which is still really cheap) and donated any money we made to Debian.
I'd do the same again.

I wasn't planning on burning any more CDs until 3.0 was out (I think
Debian is going to 3.0 this time??) but if you're really keen I'll
just burn you what I've got and you can pick them up.  

Regards,
Michael
