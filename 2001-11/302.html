I would never bother with an ISP that has to charge for downloads 
considering my usage is quite nominal compared to the employees of those 
said ISPs that have free-range access - and I download everything now 
anyhow when I check my mail.

Some good points however - but it would be nice.

&gt;&gt;How come ISPs use POP and not IMAP?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Who says they don't? :)
&gt; 
&gt; POP is easier to support, as it has no folders, a more consistent interface
&gt; between different software, and windows mail clients compatable with it have
&gt; been available a lot longer.
&gt; 
&gt; IMAP breaks depending on certain client/server combinations owing to
&gt; different interpretations of the standard, and requires end-users to be
&gt; aware of things like 'expunge'. There are also privacy and liability
&gt; concerns where an ISP can end up storing received AND sent mail.
&gt; 
&gt; POP3 generally requires less disk space to support, as it tends to default
&gt; to 'delete mail from server after download'. IMAP encourages users to leave
&gt; mail on the server. Throw in XX,000 email accounts and see how long it is
&gt; before you run out of disk.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also going to be simpler to manage with one big folder to store mail,
&gt; not little customized ones that make it more difficult to automate things
&gt; like old-mail culling and quota checking.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Isn't IMAP better as no polling is
&gt;&gt;required?  Ie - the message just appears in the inbox and one can delete
&gt;&gt;messages without having to download them if they want to.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Convenient, yes, but also a hassle for an ISP that paid for the bandwidth to
&gt; have that mail delivered to your Inbox, when you might never download it. At
&gt; least POP3 gives a better chance that you will be paying for the megs they
&gt; already downloaded for you.
