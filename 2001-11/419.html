&gt; And how much did the government spend on IT before the contract and now? 
&gt;    No one has yet told me how much the government spent on IT before the 
&gt; contract to justify EDS being more expensive.


The problem is that no one will tell us what EDS costs us today. The 
original contract was claimed to cost $570M over 9 years, if memory 
serves correct, and it was claimed that it would save us $100M over that 
time period. That was a best guess on the part of those responsible.

I know that for one agency the numbers have gone up considerably.

However, the cost has not just been on the dollar side. The other costs 
have been:

1. Reduction in IT employment opportunities in SA.
2. Reduction in flexibility on the part of agencies.
3. Increase in frustration on the part of agencies.
4. Reduction in the ability of agencies to run and manage their IT 
equipment.
5. A concentraton on MS-based solutions to the exclusion of open source 
packages like Samba (ask some of the people in agencies how successful 
they have been in getting support for Samba, for example), as well as to 
the exclusion of UNIX, FreeBSD and Linux solutions.
6. And so on.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hey - lay off EDS unless you have your facts straight.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would love to have the 'straight facts', but you see, the Government 
&gt;&gt; and EDS hide the facts from us claiming commercial confidentiality.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If I had the 'straight facts', there is no doubt that we would see 
&gt;&gt; that the outsourcing deal has been a disaster for SA and the single 
&gt;&gt; biggest mistake the government has made.
