I believe there are rpm-get style projects out there, no supported by Redhat
though.  (Although you could mirror from ftp.redhat.com every 30 mins and
get half-kinda-sorta support :).

Search freshmeat for them - I haven't actually used any though.  With apt
under debian there also is an option where you can pull down source - and
compile it, much like ports :)

I guess source RPM's are kind of like ports too... err.. kind
of-sorta-kinda-kinda.. heh :)

apt rhawks.  I still wish there was an automated way to update a BSD
system - I've looked at cvsup but haven't found an apt-get dist-upgrade
style option.  I know ethically that doing automatic updates _is_ a bad idea
(i.e. someone leaks a bad file into the apt servers, f*king over everybody's
Debian box), but I currently use apt on a debian-derived commercial distro I
sell as gateway boxes.  Its brilliant - we want to update a package, throw
it on our servers, and do an apt-get dist-upgrade, or a install from a big
fat button on the web interface.  It'll also download the latest packages
from the debian boxes, wha'la, upgraded box.

Any ideas anybody?

Maybe if cvsup does this, someone can give me tell me "cvs for dummies"
style.  I've only used it very minimally :)

Thanks.
Ryan

| yeah...

| &gt; Hiya Everyone,

| &gt; On Tech-Junkie I'm currently doing a RedHat 7.2 and Mandrake 8.1
comparative

| &gt; going to do this article different in that I'll be looking at how good
both
| &gt; are as desktop OSes.
| &gt;
| &gt; For some interest, I've got Marty Wesley (Red Hat's OS Product Manager)
and
| &gt; Mathilde Kraskovetz (Mandrake's Communication & PR person) to answer any
and
| &gt; all questions regarding their most recent products. I'm not sure yet
whether
| &gt; to include their responses with the comparative review since it may
unduly
| &gt; bias the article - I could always launch it separately.
| &gt;
| &gt; Anyway, since many of you seem like you live and breath Linux, are there
any
| &gt; questions YOU'd like to ask to both of them?
| &gt;
