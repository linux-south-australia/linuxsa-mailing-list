&gt; &gt; We're running Exchange server in a single site.  We want to put in Linux
&gt; &gt; box.  What's the best mail server to use that does POP3/SMTP?  doesn't need
&gt; &gt; any Address List or Groups but from an administration point of view it would
&gt; &gt; be easier to have this so can send mail to <A HREF="mailto:everyone@blah.com.">everyone@blah.com.</A>  Basically for
&gt; &gt; a small ISP.
&gt; 
&gt; Install Postfix (<A HREF="http://www.postfix.org/">http://www.postfix.org/</A>). It's fast, easy to configure
&gt; and secure. Worship it.
&gt; 
&gt; Next, install a POP-3 daemon. I generally use University of Washington,
&gt; but keep in mind the fact that it's had some security problems. Are you
&gt; only going to be serving POP to your LAN, or should it extend to the
&gt; rest of the world?

This is one possible way, of many.

There are some assumptions here about how you want to operate, not so much
with Postfix (which is extremely flexible, like each of the other big
MTAs) but the notion that you will be using plain BSD format files for
storing your mail (which is all UW can do, unless you count the other
little-known formats it supports) and that you will be using POP (which
can be functionally completely replaced with IMAP, with many benefits and
no disadvantages that I know of, unless your mail clients are extremely
ancient.)

I prefer to advise that you work out what your needs and constraints are,
then what protocols and finally what software you want and need.

&gt; Finally, assuming you want to be able to have all staff instantly
&gt; contactable through one address, you have two options available.
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, there's the incredibly simple method of adding an entry to your
    :
&gt; Which brings you to the second option, install a mailing list manager. I

And options three through to fifty-seven which cover doing this with
database-backed systems (including LDAP) at both the server and client
end.
