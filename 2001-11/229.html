I gave it a go with Konqueror from KDE 2.2.1, with the user agent ID string 
set to:

Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/2.2.1; Linux 2.4.8-26mdk; X11; i686; 
en_US, en)

And I received this:

Hmmmm.  I'd say their "detection" of my browsers age is a little off.  
Although they were magnanimous enough to allow me to continue anyway, some 
sites don't even let you do that!

&gt; Although, real mozilla works fine, so perhaps they only serve to "known"
&gt; browsers, and dont have opera listed or something? I guess its not as
&gt; sinister as I first thought, just dodgy.
&gt;
&gt; Further checks, opera reporting mozilla 4.76 or 5. no debug, but error.
&gt; opera reporting mozilla 3.0 - debug info (that says it works). I guess
&gt; opera must be somehow lacking, and so is thier debug code :(

&gt; &gt;    The following is debug information. Quote this information in any
&gt; &gt; correspondance, to help us to help you:
&gt; &gt;    Client Browser is: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Linux 2.4.13

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How come:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; a) I only get debug info when I claim to be using MSIE?
&gt; &gt; b) The debug information says everything works fine?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; www.netcraft.com/whats says The site www.harveynorman.com.au is running
&gt; &gt; Microsoft-IIS/4.0 on NT4/Windows 98.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looks to me like a false failure when the word "linux" is detected as
&gt; &gt; your OS description, and then the debug info that shows it all really
&gt; &gt; works is hidden from non MSIE users...
