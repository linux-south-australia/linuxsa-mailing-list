&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; You could try Star Office from Sun, its able to read and write MS formats
&gt; and has the look and feel of M$ without the price tag (free, if i remember
&gt; rightly)
&gt;

Thanks Greg, but I wasn't asking for a replacement for Applix, I was letting 
the original inquirer know that I was using Applix and was (and am) totally 
happy with it. This came direct to my personal email, not the list. Did you 
cc this on to the guy who was looking for help?

I haven't tried SO now for some time. I have replaced the OS out from under 
Applix now several times (RH, Slackware, TurboLinux and various versions of 
manduck) and despite the original gtk+ libs it was first built around now 
being a bit oldish, I haven't crashed with incompatibilities. I am very 
impressed. It has a pretty good level of 'compatibility' with M$ files, but I 
tend to try to use a generic transport medium between office platforms if I 
get the choice, e.g. RTF for word-processing. I know one day I will have to 
replace my trusty Applixware set, but I wait and hope Koffice will be up to 
my requirements specs by then.

Thanks for the suggestion, When the day comes, I will also check out SO.

Bruce
