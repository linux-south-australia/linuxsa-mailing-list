Hi Wayne,

I've been playing around with wireless networking for the past couple of
years, and would like to offer you some of my experiences.

There are many things which affect the range you can expect.  As testament
to that, I am typing this message over a 22.6km los (line of sight) wireless
link.  That's using stock standard pcmcia 802.11b "wi-fi" cards in linux
notebooks.

The main factors to consider are (not in order):-
- output strength of the radio (I've seen cards ranging from 10mW output to
100mW)
- arial (I've got 24dB gain directional dishes on my link.  Many ISA/PCI
cards have an external wip antenna offering differing gains.  Notebooks
which come with inbuilt wireless tend to have arials improving signal too.)
- Noise (the signal to noise ratio is actually the critical factor in
determining signal quality)

Environmental obstacles do come in to play.  As noted by Ed, walls and other
physical barriers can be a problem, but don't forget about the noise
factor - microwave ovens can really screw up your link, or any one of the
many other devices that operate in the 2.4GHz bandwidth.

It will be interesting to play with the new 54mbit gear which operates up at
5GHz...

Hi Ed,

Thanks for the warning.

My computer room is at the front of my old house,
being made of old stone. I would like to sit either
out the back which is about 20 meters through
the house to the back verandah, or about another
10 meters further down the back yard in the shed.



Regards

Wayne

&gt;
&gt;I been using the SMC card and base. My home is made mostly of wood and
&gt;I can tell you that there is no way I can get 30M  inside the
&gt;building. I can certainly do 30M if it is line-of-site distance with
&gt;no physical obstacles. I imagine that name brands may be better.
