EDS aren't all they great.

When they got the govt. contract, their duty at one place I used to work for 
was to take ober all the backup responsibilities of the servers.  This place 
was a newly formed agency at the time and were still in the process of 
setting up their servers and stuff...so at the time there was no backup 
responsibilities at this agency...something which EDS were all to glad to 
charge a lot of money per month to do.

When the agency finally got their servers all set up, EDS's response was, 
"Sure, we can look after them for you, at an additional cost."

&gt; Hey - lay off EDS unless you have your facts straight.
&gt;
&gt; An article in The Australian was VEHEMENTLY reputed by DAIS - the one
&gt; that claimed EDS was overcharging - that was called MARKET PRICE
&gt; ADJUSTMENT on mainframe services as costs in that area have dropped so
&gt; fast in the previous years.  EDS is bound by it's contract to promote
&gt; local businesses - something that people conveniently forget sometimes
&gt; when they trash EDS.  EDS has no choice but to use local businesses as
&gt; hardware suppliers for the SAG contract which leave prices slightly more
&gt; expensive than if purchased through the manufacturer directly.  The
&gt; other thing is that EDS must remain ISO-9001 certified or they lose
&gt; their contract - bang gone.  How many other SA businesses are audited
&gt; EVERY YEAR for ISO certification?  Does anyone here even know what ISO
&gt; certification entails?  It certainly does not leave much room for
&gt; stuffing around - let's put it that way.
&gt;
&gt; EDS is not the problem - it is this insane partnership with Microsoft
&gt; and the brainwashing that they have conducted so effectively.
&gt;
&gt; We should know our enemy - sure - but let's also remain sure of who our
&gt; enemy is.
&gt;
&gt; For your information - EDS has experimented with open source solutions -
&gt; but the government was not remotely interested.  Why don't you blame
&gt; them instead?  EDS only supplies what the customer asks for.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, IMHO, the above are the three main Open Source related IT
&gt; &gt;&gt;issues facing government... anyone care to comment?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can I suggest a brief introduction to the concept of open source. Just
&gt; &gt; because you are writing to an IT minister, doesn't necessarily mean that
&gt; &gt; your reader understands anything about IT. If your reader doesn't have an
&gt; &gt; appreciation for the concept, your letter will get binned pretty quickly.
&gt; &gt; I'm sure that a significant portion of the problem is that decision
&gt; &gt; makers aren't being advised that there are alternatives, either through
&gt; &gt; lack of knowledge on the part of the advisors, or through job protection
&gt; &gt; strategies (or EDS protection strategies ;).
