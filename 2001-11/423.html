&gt; I just don't like EDS being trashed without factual evidence.

Want some facts? here's an anecdote:

Small but important department at GMH buys computers to store prototype
quality control data.
Contracted from a foreign company who are the only guys in the world
with such precise measuring equipment and procedures.

Want to install a backup tape drive, all of about $200, to keep a backup
of important data just in case.

Guys in suits and ties from EDS get wind of it, tell them they're not
allowed to have backup systems unless they get an EDS contract for one.
EDS contract for backup alone makes up their entire IT budget. They opt
not to use EDS. EDS make sure that no tape drive is installed.

Hard drive crashes. 6 months of work lost. VT commodore is released and
motoring journalists and police complain about quality in areas that
these guys were working on. Perhaps coincidence, and EDS were only doing
their jobs under the conditions of the contract, but it doesn't inspire
confidence in them.
