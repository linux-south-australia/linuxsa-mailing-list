Hard to say without knowing what your network looks like... I'll
assume it's as follows:

Internet (via ISP)
	|
	|
	|
  Wilbs' Server
    a.b.c.d
	|
	|
hub/switch/crossover cable
	|
	|
Wilbs' Workstation
    a.b.c.e


So from a.b.c.e (e for short) you can ping a.b.c.d (d for short), and
you can ping e from d as well... from d you can get to the internet...
e's default route is via d (show us your routing table (netstat -rn)
with IP masked, if you like (for both d and e)). Does e actually
forward packets from the network to the internet and back (this is
usually done by ipchains, so if you removed your firewall, you may
have broken that). Is your ISP actually routing packets destined for
your entire subnet back to you? You can tell this by asking them, or
tracerouting back in from the outside...

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; My system at home has decided to do some very strage things recently...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From my workstation I can no longer ping or connect to any machine outside
&gt; of my network however from my server, I do not have a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not a firewall issue as I have dropped the firewall and this does not
&gt; make any difference.
&gt; 
&gt; All the machines on my network have real IP's so I am at a bit of a loss as
&gt; to what is going on.
&gt; 
&gt; There is definately connectivity between my workstation and my server as I
&gt; can SSH into it, receive and send email and browse the web through the proxy
&gt; and it receives it's DHCP information without any hassles.
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot browse the web without using my proxy though.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts from all the smart people out there?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
&gt; Damien Wilson
