&gt; i want to use awk (since i am quite enjoying learning it) to do a
&gt; statement which is something like:
&gt; if filename (from file1) = filename (from file2) AND station name
&gt; (file1) = station name (file2)
&gt; then
&gt; add $3 (file1) to file2 ($11 would do)

There are two solutions, depending if you want to hold
the files in main memory or not (which in turn depends
upon the size of the files).  They are sketched below.

1) Classic "tape merge"

Sort the two files on $3 using the system sort command.
Merge the two sorted files with $3 as the key, see Knuth
v3 Algorithm M "two-way merge".

2) Build associative array, write array at end

Use $3 as the key to an associative array.

example.awk contains
&gt; BEGIN {
&gt;   while (getline &lt;file1.txt &gt; 0) {
&gt;     remember[$3] = $10
&gt;   }
&gt; 
&gt; {
&gt;   if ($3 in remember) {
&gt;     print $0, remember[$3]
&gt;   }
&gt; }
invoked with
awk -f example.awk file2.txt

&gt; Just went to the computer science department here at uni
&gt; and talked to random people to see if they could help me
&gt; out (including their IT support)....no go. (no offensive
&gt; if the IT support for the CS department are on this list).

The IT support people are system adminstration experts,
not computer programming experts.  As far as I know
Comp Sci don't run a formal "consulting" programme
for uni staff where people can get access to a staff
member for 30 minutes, although I've always found them
happy to help.

Best wishes,
Glen
