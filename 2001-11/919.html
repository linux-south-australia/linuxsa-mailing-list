&gt; And I finally get around to a second draft...

Brian Astill kindly offered to sum up that letter with an abstract,
which I hope he will offer to the list (along with his criticism,
which was worthwhile)...

He mentioned that the way it's written, at least, there's nothing in
it for "them"... This is true... He also pointed me at a similar NZ
effort at <A HREF="http://www.openz.org/">http://www.openz.org/</A> for comparison. (see
<A HREF="http://www.openz.org/e-govt.php">http://www.openz.org/e-govt.php</A> as well)

Personally, I like it. I like it a lot. I searched around a bit, and
that effort got a reasonable amount of coverage in IT press... I
really like the effort there, and think it could do with duplication
here...

I'd be pretty happy to host a site and a mailing list if needed.
Somethign like www.openaustralia.org woudl be ok... As long as ther
are people out there willing to help with adapting the content (I've
never been a HTML guru), then I'll go ahead with this... (though if
someone with more bandwidth (I'm on 256/64 ADSL) wanted to host it,
feel free)

IMHO, this wouldn't be too hard, and could get some publicity if we do
it right... 

Comments?

(If you are just going to say something along the lines of "yes",
please send it off-line to me, so I can gauge response without
flooding the list)

Thanks
