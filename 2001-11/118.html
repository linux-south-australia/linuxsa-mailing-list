Hi there all,
I have a couple of questions regarding Telstras big-ponds cable,
I would like to know how under RH 7.1 how-to share the 'NET' 
connection for the machines at home easily, I have had lots of people 
say it is only 3 lines of code, I ask where and people say read the 
how-to's, I know it is the only way to learn but reading the how-to's 
and listening to people sometimes makes matters worse. I have bought 
books on linux adminstration and now I am totally confused. 
Back to the orginal problem sharing the dhcp assigned ip on one card 
(eth0) and local (eth1), I have no problems multi-honing the machine. 
Getting the machine to do the masquarding?

Well it can be done on a Winzose machine 2000 or nt4 but very unsafe 
due to network problems (normal for this), and linux is the best and 
safest way to resolve the problem. 

Is there anybody out there that could help me, or point me in the 
correct direction.

I am wondering how many people on telstras cable are using linux, also 
is anybody having problems with there cable, for me the last two weeks 
maybe 4 days of use and on the second modem.

About 10 days ago telstra did some thing to the network like change 
out of 10 ip's 9 changed, yes the service is dhcp but when the dhcp 
server gets a new number and the gateway only starters, three weeks 
ago I got the new modem, and now I am very unsatisfied with the 
service and they know it..

Cheers for now.
Paul
