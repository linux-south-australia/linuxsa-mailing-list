&gt; &gt; I know this has been kicked about a few times but I'm after folks
&gt; &gt; opinion specifically in regards to education institutions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let say we have the name from Hell:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mr John Anadoplopidious - no slight on Greek folks intended here just
&gt; &gt; looking for long name :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now should here user/email name be:

You are talking about two different things here. There is not
necessarily any correlation between email addresses and usernames. In
fact, if they are seperate it can make your life a lot easier.

&gt; &gt; 1.
&gt; &gt; Plane last name, first initial / first initial last name combos
&gt; &gt; i.e. <A HREF="mailto:anadoplopidiousj@domain.com.au">anadoplopidiousj@domain.com.au</A> or <A HREF="mailto:janadoplopidious@domain.com.au">janadoplopidious@domain.com.au</A>
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. 
&gt; &gt; First five/six characters of last name rules
&gt; &gt; i.e. <A HREF="mailto:anadopj@domain.com.au">anadopj@domain.com.au</A> or <A HREF="mailto:anadopj@domain.com.au">anadopj@domain.com.au</A>

Some research seems to indicate:

o Don't expect to generate addresses just from names, as that
  namespace is very non-unique 

o If you must use names, either ensure your system can cope with 
  a change of address, or prepare for lawsuits when Ms. Smith becomes
  Mrs. Citizen and wants to change her email address to suit.

o Don't use a username/address that divulges private information 
  (employee/student id etc)

One approach I have seen used several times is very simple - user
chooses. A gentle prodding can get them to choose something which
gives you some conformity. However them choosing ensures you don't get
clashes (they can't have what isn't available).

This approach is taken by cisco. 

It also lessens surprise. For example, if I knew that
<A HREF="mailto:jbloggs@company.com">jbloggs@company.com</A> was Joe Bloggs and <A HREF="mailto:jsmith@company.com">jsmith@company.com</A> was John
Smith, then I might be tempted to mail Jane Doe at
<A HREF="mailto:jdoe@cisco.com.">jdoe@cisco.com.</A> Consequences when Jack Doe receives my mail could
range from embarassment to financial ruin.

This may not be as applicable to an educational institution. If I was
assinging address to several thousand students at once I would use a
random string of characters, possibly with a check character, and make
sure my directory services were up to snuff. 'Important' people would
get aliases to more human readable addresses, subject to the same
rules as above.

&gt; Also, some companies are going with firstname.lastname or similar.  Is
&gt; there anything wrong with using periods/dots in usernames?  How does
&gt; BIND handle it if the administrator is my.name.server.com?

Subject: Q3.4 -- Why are you so hostile to using full names for email
        addresses?

    Because full names are not unique.  For example, the computer
community has two Andy Tannenbaums and two Peter Deutsches.  At one
time, Bell Labs had two Stephen R. Bournes with offices a few doors
apart.  You can create alternative addresses (e.g.,
Stephen_R_Bourne_2), but that's even worse -- which one of them has to
have their name desecrated in this way?  And you can bet that one of
them will get most of the other person's email.

    So called "full names" are just an attempt to create longer
versions of unique names.  Rather that lulling people into a sense of
security, I'd rather that it be clear that these handles are
arbitrary.  People should use good user agents that have alias
mappings so that they can attach arbitrary names for their personal
use to those with whom they correspond (such as the MH alias file).

    Even worse is fuzzy matching in email -- this can make good
addresses turn bad.  For example, Eric Allman is currently (to the
best of our knowledge) the only ``Allman'' at Berkeley, so mail sent
to <A HREF="mailto:Allman@Berkeley.EDU">Allman@Berkeley.EDU</A> should get to him.  But if another Allman
ever appears, this address could suddenly become ambiguous.  He's been
the only Allman at Berkeley for over fifteen years -- to suddenly have
this "good address" bounce mail because it is ambiguous would be a
heinous wrong.

    Directory services should be as fuzzy as possible (within reason,
of course).  Mail services should be unique.
