Denise,

Which web site did you try to find a FAQ at? RedHat.com? Their site is
generally very corporate and appear to use liberal amounts of DHTML so it
may not appear correctly on older browsers. Try www.mandrake.com and
www.suse.com.

On a 486DX (33Mhz?) machine with 32Mb of RAM, the latest distros for full
blown GUI desktop use would probably feel like time has stopped. I think
around the Red Hat 5 era would be fine though.

Generally the most recent really viable desktop Linux distributions like
Mandrake, Suse, and Red Hat would go well on machines with 128 MB RAM and a
300Mhz Pentium, if desktop use is what you're after.

For moderate emailing and a great web browsing experience, Mozilla and
Mozilla's own email client would do the job rather well.

Windows 98 with IE 4 and Outlook Express would suit them well too,
especially considering its good accessibility support. I've seen a nearly
blind guy at the state library navigate Windows (rather slowly) with a mouse
cursor about 1/4 the size of my notebook's 1024x768 desktop. Accessibility
is one of Windows' strong points, I would have to admit.

Cheers,

Joseph Tan

Subject: I need help using linux


Deaar Linuxsa list,

I'm sorry to ask these really basic questions which I was hoping to find
in a faq at the web page, but I can't fathom out how anything on the
wweb page works.

I currently teach getting ont the internet to old ladies, my current
students are 82 and 85.
My own computer is a 486Dx and I have very reluctantly upgraded recently
from mswindows3.11 to windows 95.

However, all my old dears usually have new computers, loaded in the shop
with the latest microsoft stuff.

Their learning aim is to write e-mails and look at things on line.

Poor vision is their most common problem.

Windows 98+ is so complicated I've decided to learn Linux, practice on
my machine and end up installing it on theirs.

So my questions are:
Everything I have read says that I need a pentium myself to run Linux,
and the latest thing I've read says I need at least 1.3 GIG of my
hardrive to load it?
Is this true?
what can I do on a 486? with 32meg of RAM?

Does the Linux display allow for mega large high contract display for
the visually handicapped?

Denise
