&gt;Thanks. Actually it is pretty easy for all software only tasks. With
&gt;VHDL/Verilog compilers and PCB layout we still have Windoze
&gt;programs under vmware but we are looking to migrate to linux solutions
&gt;as soon as is practical. Again any exeriences here? Our goal is total
&gt;linux domination as soon as is practical.  

The key is going for "total linux domination" and not shooting oneself
in the foot by losing functionality, just to prove a point against MS.
Coming from me thats a bit unusual as I'm as keen as anyone to drop-kick
MS crud off people's desktops, but on the practical side, its a gradual
process
which can only proceed at the rate of development, which is pretty fast
at the worst of times :o)

Vmware is good, particularly if you have the PC grunt to run it.  I use
Win4lin at home to run Quicken (and IE6 for any poxy websites which I 
can't run in Konqueror or Mozilla), which is super fast in comparison to 
Vmware, but doesn't support NT-based Windows, so you're limited to Win95/98
with all their bugs unfortunately.

&gt;&lt;soapbox&gt; 
&gt;I think that the issue of office app stability should be the primary 
&gt;one. We complain about microsoft's tactic of releasing bugging but 
&gt;feature full versions so it is important that we don't adopt the same 
&gt;practice in the race to get acceptance for linux office apps. There is
&gt;only so much of the microsoft way that we should be emulating! 
&gt;&lt;/soapbox&gt;

Agree 100% here.  
At least the typical OSS approach is "here's the alpha, beta & RC versions,
and any test version in between, if you want to try them, go ahead, or wait 
for the stable version, whatever you would like to do, it's your choice"
Dang, I like that word..............Choice :o)

The other classic OSS quote from Linus of course "It'll be released when its
ready" (paraphrased slightly, can't remember the exact quote, but he was 
referring to kernel 2.4 at the time
