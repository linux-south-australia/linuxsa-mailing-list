&gt; 
&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, Aristotle, so have the Democrats promised to not sell out their
&gt; electorate again, and do you believe them?
&gt;
I'd be disappointed if the actual pollies cared what they used.  I'd be 
happier if they were interested in making sure that their content was 
accessible by everyone.  Does that mean they have to use Open Source 
Software?  Hmmmmm, not really, but it would help...
 
&gt; Being scoffed at because of your interest in linux at work, tells us more
&gt; about the attitudes at your workplace than the future of linux. I have to
&gt; say that at the present time, I rarely meet anyone who hasn't at least
&gt; heard of it. Some people react with 'You running linux? - cool'
&gt; 
And, being in my environment at work where virtually everyone has exposure 
to Linux, I have an entirely different perspective.  However, the issue is 
still support in my environment.  There's a database app that they have 
installed.  We have MySQL running several databases quite nicely, but this 
app isn't supported on MySQL so we're using Micro$oft SQL instead (the 
other option was Access *sigh*).  Now, at that point, we have a management 
that want to _consolidate_ the data in the several databases and because 
this one app is only supported on Access and SQL Server, all of a sudden, 
management want everything on SQL Server *sigh*.  Yes, this is politics 
and it's extremely difficult to fight when you're busy trying to do your 
normal job as well.

So, why is it that a company that has ovwer 100 Linux workstations, a few 
FreeBSD workstations, a swag of Solaris Servers and even some OpenBSD 
servers (for the _other_ side of the firewall) want to consolidate their 
databases on to SQL Server? *shrug* - because of one database application.  
Then again, I'm still working on it so this may not be the last word

&gt; The pollies will adopt the linux bandwagon when there is enough votes in
&gt; it. That hasn't happened yet.
&gt; 
No they won't - the pollies shouldn't even be considering such micro 
issues.  It's unfortunate when they do because they make really strange 
decisions (much the same as they have at my workplace).

There is a real issue with support though.  Once upon a time, I worked as 
a Desktop Support Operator in a Windows NT environment.  In this 
environment, there were these stupid automatic gate thingies that were 
running DOS.  I could never get PC Anywhere for DOS working properly so 
whenever there was a problem, I had to jump into my car and go and have a 
look.  Now, my suggestion was to port the C program that was running on 
these gates to Linux.  They considered this especially when coupled with 
the fact that Tuxedo wasn't supported on DOS anymore and it was supported 
on Linux.  However, the biggest issue was still support.  I managed to 
convince them that it wasn't a big an issue as they thought.  Afterall, 
out of the DSOs that we had, half of them preferred Linux (or Solaris) 
anyhow.  Well, it all fell in a big hole when I left and all the other 
DSOs that preferred Linux left as well *sigh*.  This is the problem with 
Open Source Software.  Management don't know where to get the support 
unless it's sitting under their noses.  They don't (generally) make the 
sensible decisions that their IT Departments want... they make decisions 
based on their own experiences!  They use Windoze or they have one app 
that can't be replaced easily that uses a closed source application so 
that's the way they go *sigh*.  Is it political?  Yes.  Does it have a 
place on this list?  Absolutely.  Do we approach this problem by talking 
to political parties? Nah... that's just senseless - if the IT Department 
can't support it, it would be suicide.

Explaining that if we find a bug in Open Source Software, we don't have to 
pay nearly $300 to be told that it's not going to be fixed until the next 
release?  Well, managers understand that...

What a bunch of dribble I have written here *sigh*... oh well, I guess I 
just needed to add it to the melting point...

&gt; &gt; Anyone who believes they can live in isolation of the world around them 
&gt; &gt; is sadly deluded.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is this exact kind of attitude that is moving Linux and Unix closer 
&gt; &gt; to irrelevancy each day.  At work - I am scoffed at the mention of 
&gt; &gt; anything not Windows - and this is a major corporation I am talking about.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Get real - think about it.  If people want Linux to remain (like 
&gt; &gt; Macintosh) relegated to a small group of zealous fans or specialised 
&gt; &gt; applications, then so be it.  If we want Linux to be anything more than 
&gt; &gt; an interesting toy for us geeks, then we need to look at the real world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anything that is important to the future of Linux, is very relevant 
&gt; &gt; indeed - get over it.
