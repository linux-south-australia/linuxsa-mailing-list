Of course DAIS would VEHMENTLY repute such an article - they have to
justify their existance also. (Did I hear someone say Motorola?)

EDS's presence, whilst providing employment for a number of people, makes
it very hard for local SA companies to get into SA goverment contracts in
their own right.

The company I work for has installed a large number of FreeBSD servers,
performing various functions in a number of local government organisations
in South Australia. We have used our FreeBSD based network monitoring
service in local and state government departments. These organisations do
not reject open source solutions, if it is offered as a viable
alternative.

&gt; Hey - lay off EDS unless you have your facts straight.
&gt; 
&gt; An article in The Australian was VEHEMENTLY reputed by DAIS - the one 
&gt; that claimed EDS was overcharging - that was called MARKET PRICE 
&gt; ADJUSTMENT on mainframe services as costs in that area have dropped so 
&gt; fast in the previous years.  EDS is bound by it's contract to promote 
&gt; local businesses - something that people conveniently forget sometimes 
&gt; when they trash EDS.  EDS has no choice but to use local businesses as 
&gt; hardware suppliers for the SAG contract which leave prices slightly more 
&gt; expensive than if purchased through the manufacturer directly.  The 
&gt; other thing is that EDS must remain ISO-9001 certified or they lose 
&gt; their contract - bang gone.  How many other SA businesses are audited 
&gt; EVERY YEAR for ISO certification?  Does anyone here even know what ISO 
&gt; certification entails?  It certainly does not leave much room for 
&gt; stuffing around - let's put it that way.
&gt; 
&gt; EDS is not the problem - it is this insane partnership with Microsoft 
&gt; and the brainwashing that they have conducted so effectively.
&gt; 
&gt; We should know our enemy - sure - but let's also remain sure of who our 
&gt; enemy is.
&gt; 
&gt; For your information - EDS has experimented with open source solutions - 
&gt; but the government was not remotely interested.  Why don't you blame 
&gt; them instead?  EDS only supplies what the customer asks for.
