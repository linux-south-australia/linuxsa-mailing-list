Im actually working on an improved backup system right now. Personally I
wouldnt use less than DDS4 tapes. We have various tape drives, but the
main one is DDS4 and that is becomming a bit small.

I have had a look at amanda but decided it was overly complicated, and I
havent been able to find anything good, so Im playing around with a
script that just uses rsync with tar or dump. If any one has any ideas
about good ways to do backups let me know :) 

I personally wouldnt go smaller than dds4. How may tapes do you want to
swap, and where are you going to go when your system gets out grown?

AFAIK tape drives will just show up as a block device and you'll be able
to dump more blocks of data on a larger tape. If you do go for 200gb
tapes of some description let us know how you go, because I might need
to look in to this in the coming months...

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at backup technologies for a client, and I'm just
&gt; wondering if anyone here has had experience with some of the less
&gt; common, larger format technologies. I'm pretty confident that I can
&gt; get DDS4 on linux, but what about DLT, LTO or HP Ultrium?
&gt; 
&gt; What do people think about robots as compared to a larger single tape
&gt; (eg an 8 tape DDS3 robot would take ~200Gb, whereas you can get 200Gb
&gt; on a single Ultrium...)?
&gt; 
&gt; I've found www.linuxtapecert.org, but it doesn't seem to be about
&gt; giving advice, and I've been looking at the AMANDA site, but it also
&gt; doesn't give much in the way of advice...
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; 
&gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; PS: I'm planning to use AMANDA to run the backups...
