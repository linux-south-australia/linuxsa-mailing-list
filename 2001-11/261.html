Of course, Dan.

&gt; There are some assumptions here about how you want to operate, not so much
&gt; with Postfix (which is extremely flexible, like each of the other big
&gt; MTAs) but the notion that you will be using plain BSD format files for
&gt; storing your mail (which is all UW can do, unless you count the other
&gt; little-known formats it supports) and that you will be using POP (which
&gt; can be functionally completely replaced with IMAP, with many benefits and
&gt; no disadvantages that I know of, unless your mail clients are extremely
&gt; ancient.)

OK, I've assumed that BSD-format mbox files will be acceptable seeing as
the original poster seemed to indicate that this would only be for a
small setup. BSD-format mbox files are acceptable for several thousand
messages, so it's probably going to be quite adequate for a small setup.

Now, I referenced to POP because the original question asked for a
"...mail server to use that does POP3/SMTP...". I didn't see a reference
to IMAP, though I take your point.

&gt; I prefer to advise that you work out what your needs and constraints are,
&gt; then what protocols and finally what software you want and need.

Hrm, well, I suppose that's something that you've got to decide when you
write the e-mail. Postfix+BSD-mbox+UW-POP3d isn't such a bad combination
for a small setup. It's dead easy to setup, making it (arguably) the
best way to get a quick solution to the problem.

&gt; &gt; Finally, assuming you want to be able to have all staff instantly
&gt; &gt; contactable through one address, you have two options available.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Firstly, there's the incredibly simple method of adding an entry to your
&gt;     :
&gt; &gt; Which brings you to the second option, install a mailing list manager. I
&gt; 
&gt; And options three through to fifty-seven which cover doing this with
&gt; database-backed systems (including LDAP) at both the server and client
&gt; end.

Yeah, but seriously Dan, who could be bothered when you're talking about
something that's small.

Perhaps if Matthew had said,

    "I've got 6000 clients who each require e-mail access. I want to
    provide this through a Linux-based server solution. I want to be
    able to send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:everyone@domain.com">everyone@domain.com</A> and have all 6000
    users receive the message. I'd also like to be able spread the load
    amongst multiple servers as well as having the ability to provide a
    company directory listing all the clients and their e-mail
    addresses."
    
... or whatever, I'd have put a few more options down on the table. But
frankly, I couldn't be bothered for something that's small. I daresay
that Matthew wouldn't be either. Then again, who am I to say what
Matthew's thinking :-)
