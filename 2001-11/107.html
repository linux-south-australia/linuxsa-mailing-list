&gt;  &gt; Hmm.. Not sure.. just make sure you get something that supports dv-in and
&gt;  &gt; dv-out (not all support dv-in, surprisingly.. something to do with tax

&gt; 
&gt; No.  Copyright.  You're allowed to extract a full-quality digital video
&gt; stream, you just aren't allowed to write it to anything else afterwards.

Copyright is the excuse.  The "fair dealing" clauses in the
Copyright Act deal with reasons for reproducing a particular
media's content, not the reproduction technology itself.
For example, you can reproduce a document by taking a video
of it, the Copyright Act doesn't require you to set up
a phototypesetter.  So there's currently no Copyright Act
reason why DV Out can't be connected to DV In for fair
dealing purposes.  [1]

It's suspected that the real reason for a lack of DV In
is profit maximisation, especially for companies that
manufacture hardware, distribute content and have deals
with creators of content.

 [1] Currently meaning "today".  There's a case in the works
     at the moment at the crux of fair dealing an circumvention
     devices.  The result should give some idea of technology
     limits that manufacturers build into their equipment that
     prevents fair dealing reproductions.
