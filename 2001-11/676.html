&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     This is not as straight forward as you might think to
&gt; do, it will depend on what you want to know as to how you go
&gt; about gathering the information. Knowing what you want to
&gt; know isn't that straight forward either, there are many
&gt; surveys out there that mean absolutely nothing, sure they
&gt; collect some data, but if the data isn't useful. I am not an
&gt; expert at this, but first year Uni Psychology and Statistics
&gt; indicate that surveys are very useful, but need careful
&gt; thought to implement. Here are some tips that might help.

Agreed.  Its like writing.  Nearly everyone can do it, but doing it 
WELL is quite another matter.

Your advice was pretty sound, and I hope Ian follows it.  One or two 
things needed amendment IMHO, and I've commented accordingly.

&gt;     What is your target audience?
&gt;         It is pointless to ask a low income population if
&gt; they own expensive high
&gt;         tech gear (most of them will not).
&gt;
&gt;     What do you want to do with the results?
&gt;         Do you want to open a Community Centre and provide
&gt; computers based
&gt;         on what the Survey says?
&gt;
&gt;     Are Computer illiterate people going to be interested in
&gt; getting involved?
&gt;         If not, why are you doing this?
&gt;
&gt;     How many people will you survey?
&gt;         7 out of 10 Six year olds surveyed at a birthday
&gt; party like vegemite on toast
&gt;         doesn't prove that 70% of the World's population
&gt; does. 

&gt; The more people
&gt; you survey from more widespread population samples
&gt; gives more accurate
&gt;         results.

Common fallacy.  It can actually produce false results due to 
widespread duplications.  You can think you have 6,000,000 cases when 
in effect you are only dealing with 55 different ones.

There is also the problem of clustering.  VERY easy to aggregate your 
survey data and produce meaningless information.  In this case, a 'mean 
average' which included visually impaired people, people with 
uncontrolled movements, paraplegics, quadraplegics, etc., etc., .... 
would produce a recommendation for something that suited NONE of your 
target group.

&gt;     You must also structure your survey to include General
&gt; information, ie Age, sex, Post code, education level etc.
&gt; This gives some sort of baseline to compare your sample.

Not 'must'.  You should collect data only if they are useful.  What in 
this context would be the use of sociodemographic data?
If it really would be useful, then OK - otherwise don't collect it.

&gt;     You must group your questions, ie Dou you own a
&gt; Computer? if yes, then have 5 questions about computers, if
&gt; no, then skip them.Question Groups can cross check some data
&gt; for you and make your survey more accurate.

In this case, this is probably reasonable.  In a psych test it is the 
LAST thing you would do.

&gt;     Ask your questions in an unambiguous way. If you want a
&gt; yes/no answer, then ask a clear, concise yes/no question. If
&gt; you leave any doubt in the person's mind, then they will
&gt; usually tell you what you want to hear after questioning the
&gt; survey taker. Question groups come in handy here, 5 short
&gt; concise questions are better than 1 ambiguous question. A
&gt; survey taker should NEVER influence a survey by explaining a
&gt; question.

&gt;     Pick questions that give a measure, ie How many people
&gt; in your family that live in your house? a.less than 3,
&gt; b.3-5, c.6 or more. Group them with questions like - Does
&gt; the family own a computer? a.No, b.Yes - One, c.Yes - two,
&gt; Yes - 3 or More. This kind of data can give a result that
&gt; families with more members own more computers because they
&gt; have more people to use them, or that families with more
&gt; people are less likely to have a computer because they
&gt; cannot afford one. You must also pick questions that give
&gt; unambiguous results.
&gt;
&gt;     Finally, you must pick enough questions to get what you
&gt; want, but not enough so that the person being surveyed gets
&gt; bored and answers anything just to get away.
&gt;
&gt;     This list isn't exhaustive by any means, but it does
&gt; show that surveys are a lot of work. After you collect the
&gt; data, you must then do a statistical analysis on it, and
&gt; this also takes time and effort. In a nutshell, what you
&gt; need is this:
&gt;
&gt;     1. Decide EXACTLY what you want to know.
&gt;     2. Decide your Target audience.
&gt;     3. Ask questions that target  1 and 2.
&gt;     4. Ask questions that are unambiguous.
&gt;     5.Ask questions that are measurable.
&gt;     6. Group questions to support each other.

More-or-less OK

&gt;     7. Select a large enough sample to be meaningful.

Nonsense.  What you are seeking is a representative sample, not just 
numbers.

&gt;     8. Balance the survey length.
&gt;     9. Ask for common basic information to group answers.
&gt;     10. Complete a thorough Statistical Analysis when Survey
&gt; is complete.

These requirements don't mean much.
