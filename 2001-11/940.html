I never used to get a busy signal ever then a few months ago started
getting them.  Billing is pretty woeful (not as bad as some though)
and customer service is useless (it's like they sort of try but all
the CS drones just don't know anything).
 
&gt; if anyone wants dingoblue, tell me, and i'll refer you, then we both
&gt; get $40 credit free thru their referal plan!!! its SIC

I stopped doing that cos I don't really feel I can recommend them
any more.  They have gone enormously downhill lately.

I'd love to find somewhere else but for the price they're still ok
(if you don't mind all the problems - rather like telstra ADSL now
I think about it, although that's expensive and crap).
