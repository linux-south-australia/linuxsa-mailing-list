&gt; Hrm, well, I suppose that's something that you've got to decide when you
&gt; write the e-mail. Postfix+BSD-mbox+UW-POP3d isn't such a bad combination

&gt; best way to get a quick solution to the problem.

But no, you see, what you say simply isn't the case. 

In the above you could replace Postfix, BSD-mbox and UW-POP3d respectively
with [qmail/Exim], Maildir and Courier-POP/IMAPd and just as arguably have
a setup which was even easier, depending on the background of the
installer.

For example, I'm no qmail fan, but it is true that qmail needs just one
line in one file as a minimum configuration, which is less than Postfix.
The minimum Exim config is a tiny number of lines. And plenty of people
would argue that Maildir is easier in many respects than the BSD format.
Similar arguments about POP daemons, although I'm sufficiently happy with
Courier to not be current with any alternatives.

&gt; Yeah, but seriously Dan, who could be bothered when you're talking about
&gt; something that's small.

Many people, including me. I wouldn't think of what you proposed as the
first obvious option at all, not that I think your proposal is bad.

Background of the installer (and the desires/needs of the user) is
everything.
