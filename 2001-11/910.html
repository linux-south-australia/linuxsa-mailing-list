&gt; Hi Michael,
&gt;
&gt; I used to be with dingoblue. They are having lots of connection
&gt; problems but hopefully that will be resolved shortly. What annoyed me
&gt; was that their finance accounting system seemed to have a problem with
&gt; the numbers between 0 and 9, they stuffed up so many times that I
&gt; eventually dropped them rather than keep up the frustration of trying
&gt; to get them to listen and correct their errors.

I have had several bad experiences with customer support, the last of
which was when:
a) the mail account I wanted had somehow expired
b) they wouldn't let me renew it "for legal reasons"
c) i spent quite some time stuffing around trying to
   get michael.wardle.  nobody there twigged that
   periods might not have been valid in a mail account,
   and the web-based system silently rejected it
   (leaving the impression that it had sort of worked).

About the connection problems:
Dingo Blue's service levels went rapidly downhill towards the end of
September this year.  It took over a month to get a response out of them
other than their cut-and-paste response which denied that they did
anything to dial-in capacity.  Interestingly the fact (or at least the
allegation backed up by 100s of angry customers) they they had done was
carried on ZDNet and Whirlpool.  After three complaints, finally a
representative asked if I would like to register a formal complaint.  I
did so, and the service was improved within a week.  (I also lodged a
complaint with their parent company, AGL.)

I can only suggest that you make a formal complaint, and encourage
others in your area to do similarly.

Certainly Dingo Blue still represents excellent value, but I'd rather
spend another 10 $ per month to get decent customer service.

&gt; The project, based in Salisbury North (20k north of Adelaide)...

I lived in Brompton once.  :-)

&gt; Another thing we are looking for is somebody to host us so we can lock
&gt; in our email addresses even if we change suppliers.

Some (cheap) options that I have considered:
* OzEmail sells mail accounts
* Yahoo Personal Address
* Bigfoot (or a similar "address for life")
* building a small server and hosting my own mail

I went with a Yahoo personal address, but it's far from ideal.

&gt; I am seriously looking at ADSL or similar for some of our busier
&gt; connections.

I wish I had ADSL in Wodonga...  &gt;:-(
(*poof*...  "you have two wishes left")

Best regards.
