Adam,

RTFP...

Think you're being a bit unfair here...

On the free player page there are two links.
One Obviously states "trial" - hmm trial means .....
Second (to the right) states "download the free realone player only"

I also am not impressed in how real try to make you download the pay
player - but it's not that hard to navigate.  All they wanted was my
name, email address and a challenge question/answer.

Paul

Subject: [OT] REAL.COM (Was: [OT] Bill Gates talks to Sara in UK)


&gt; Sarah, 15, from Lincolnshire went to meet the richest man in 
&gt; the world, 
&gt; Microsoft boss Bill Gates. 

I would like to take this opportunity to just express something I am
*REALLY* annoyed about and seeing more and more of in the Internet
community these days.

Let's start with this post.  I went to the website and wanted to watch
the clip, and I appeared to need Real Player (now known as 'Real One').
I thought to myself "what the hell" and proceeded to REAL.COM to
download it and play it on this very same Windows box.

I get to REAL.COM and all I see are commercializations for the US$9.95
Real Player version, and after clicking around for a bit I finally found
a page which appeared to be the free version.  Afterall, I don't care
for the software, I just want to play the .RM file!

The page was:
<A HREF="http://www.real.com/realone/index.html?src">http://www.real.com/realone/index.html?src</A>=011204realhome_1

Anyway, all I could see on that page was a big link for "Download Real
One now", but it said it was $9.95, so it couldn't have been the version
I wanted.  After reading through all the crap, I ended up finding a
not-so-easy to see link to "Free Player", which is on this horrid grey
bar in the middle.

Once you click on that, you are taken to a form in which you are
required to give Real Networks your personal information, including
First name, Last name, E-Mail address, etc etc.  I ended up using the
bogus email address <A HREF="mailto:asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf@asdf.com">asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf@asdf.com</A>, because there
were already so many other people adding "asdf's" to their bogus email
addresses.

Then I was asked to provide Billing Information and CREDIT CARD DETAILS.
What do they need these for when I haven't agreed to pay them anything?

"Payment Information: 
You will need a valid credit card to participate in the RealOne Trial.
Please enter your credit card information below to make sure we have the
correct billing information on file should you incur any additional
charges beyond your trial period. "

I read back a bit and it turns out I was starting to enter a contract
for 14 days in which I could trial the program and then they would
charge my credit card unless I said otherwise.

But so often I find I'm being asked to provide details about myself and
I have never worked out *why* these companies require it.  They seem
obsessed with collecting irrelevant details about people and using them
for what purpose?



I think the reason I'm shitty about it is because I'm sick of putting in
falsified information all over the place just to download software.
Studies that have been done by online magazines and the like show that
by providing real details you are an extremely high target for SPAM, and
that I don't want to be -- I get enough of it through our main work
email address.

I guess I'm over my little annoyance now, but I'll be continuing to use
"<A HREF="mailto:blah@hotmail.com">blah@hotmail.com</A>" and various other fake email addresses to download
software.. Oh, and I'm getting a little over looking up US zip codes for
those forms that match zip codes against the state you enter.  Bah!

Anyway.

In the end, I didn't get to watch the video.  Typical.
