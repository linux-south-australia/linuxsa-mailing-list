&gt; I recently bought an AGP video card (nvidia 32MB TNT2 M64).I replaced
&gt; the old PCI card and hooked everything back up but on booting the
&gt; computer - absolutely nothing. No signal is being sent to the monitor at
&gt; all. The card is OK since it works in another machine.
&gt; I replaced the PCI card (leaving the AGP card in its slot) and booted
&gt; into linux and found that the AGP slot and card is recognised.

Hi.

It's a sad few who are replying to messages on this wee hour of giftmas
day.

Anywho,  you'll probably find that there's a setting in your computer's
BIOS about which video card to initialise first.  I have it.  I can set
it to AGP or PCI.  If I set PCI and don't have a card in, nothing
happens and i'm (for lack of a better word) rooted, and have to put the
PCI video card in.

Check that first.  You'll at least be able to get to a console if you
set the thing to AGP card first.

Then you'll probably have to reconfigure X to use the new video card.
Depending on what distro there's lots of ways to do it.  Editing
/etc/X11/... (can't remember the name off hand) will do the trick.
Alternately there'll be a setup program that came with your distribution
to configure X for video cards.  RedHat (and AFIK, Mandrake) should
detect it at boot and run the right utility.

You don't say what video card you just replaced so I can't offer any
advice as to whether it will actually work straight up with the TNT card
instead.

Well, it's the wee hours of giftmas and I just got home from drinks with
friends, so it's off to bed for me.  Hope this advice was of some help.

Cheers,
Adam
