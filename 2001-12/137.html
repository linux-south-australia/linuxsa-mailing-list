&gt; have a no-name motherboard with a VIA 82C598/596/586 chipset on it with a
&gt; Western Digital 40Gb ATA100 HDD attached.   The unified driver is detecting

I have a WD18.2G HDD and a VIA (can't remember what one) chipset for a
K6-III/400.  It detects the via chipset under kernel 2.4 and enables
UDMA on it automagically.  If I remember correctly (which I don't 'cos
2.2 was a long time ago) there was an option in 2.2 kernels somewhere
early on in the settings (if you're using 'make config') that you could
change for your chipset.

There were a few things in the help about VIA chipsets and UDMA and that
option was apparantly designed to fix the problems you describe.  I
never used it, however.

There's now a patch for WD drives in the unified driver isn't there? I'm
sure I've seen it somewhere.

Anywho, I use that combination and it seems to work OK. I haven't lost
any data yet, but I use kernel 2.4.  I'd suggest upgrading to 2.4 if
it's at all possible for you to do - there are some performance gains.

Cheers,
Adam
