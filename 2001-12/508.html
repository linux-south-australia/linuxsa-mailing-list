Hi All,

This message is perhaps a little off topic, but most of you will be 
off enjoying your Christmas break and the rest of you probably won't
mind a little diversion.

I am trying to sort out in my head different ways of thinking about
programming.  This email is probably to clarify my own thoughts
as much as anything, but I am also hoping to receive enlightening
feedback from others.

Programming is fundamentally about modelling, on a computer, some
external reality (be that reality fairly concrete like an aeroplane
simulator, or be it more abstract like a Mandelbrot set).  This
activity has its origins centuries ago: Mathematicians have been
modelling reality for years, using methodologies not unsimilar to 
programming.  What is new with computers, however, is the ability to 
perform computations at a much faster speed than a mathematician 
could ever hope to achieve.

The question then with programming (and with mathematics) is...

       ...how best to model?

A programmer's answer to this question generally comes in two parts.  The 
first comes with the choosing of a computer language to code in.  The
second, with the choice of structures within that language.  So the critical
sub-question is...

       ...what differences in modelling do different languages 
          provide and what advantages and disadvantages do these
          differences present?

Read any Functional Programming website and you are likely to hear
proponents argue that Imperative languages (like assembler, C, pascal,
C++, Java, etc) are stuck in the past, limiting themselves to the
the machine-language-like structure of the machine they are implemented
on.  Far better, they would argue, to model reality using languages
closer to mathematics than to the machine.  Such languages include
Functional languages like LISP, Scheme, Haskell and Clean, and Logic 
languages like Prolog and Mercury.  I am interested in such languages
and hope to learn more about them so I may be in a better position
to evaluate these claims.  However on the face of it, I am not
persuaded that their claims to supremacy are as strong as they often
make out.  Yes these paradigms provide a number of powerful constructs
that imperative languages generally do not, but in some aspects these
paradigms seem limited.  I am happy to be proven wrong.

The emphasis in Functional/Logic based languages seems to be relationship:
"how are certain parts related to other parts".  Imperative languages
seem to be based on state: "how does the state of various interacting
objects change over a time-line".  Both ways of viewing things seem
to have advantages and disadvantages.

The Functional/Logic approach seems best when we wish to model a collection
of interacting relationships and be able to "look over the shoulder" of
this collection as the implications of these interactions unfold.  The
F/L approach does not like being disturbed by the outside world.  It has
a world of its own, a world which is very powerful in isolation, but has
difficulty responding to external stimulus.  If all you, the observer,
ask, is to watch this world unfold before you without disturbance,
then the F/L approach is ideal.  On the otherhand, if you wish to prod
this world and have it respond to you as an entity, it seems rather
ill equiped.  Perhaps I am wrong about this --- F/L language designers have
attempted to find solutions to this dilemma --- but alternatively, perhaps 
the F/L paradigm is simply ill-suited to this form of use?

The Imperative approach seems best when the problem to be modelled may
easily be thought of as a collection of objects with states, interacting
together over a timeline.  The modelling of ocean currents is one such
example.  The differential equations used to model various aspects of
ocean-current behaviour may be used to set up a spacial grid of points,
each with a state that varies over time according to interactions with
neighbouring states.  Such interactions could be modelled using the
F/L approach, but I suspect nowhere near as well.


              The best of both worlds?

What if a time-line were added to a Functional/Logic paradigm?  Or
Functional/Logic constructs were added to an imperative language...
The F/L constructs within such a language could be time-invariant,
ie constant; or could be invariant within the scope of their
existence: created, evaluated via a run-time interpreter, and then
killed.  Is this what Imperative-Functional hybrid languages like
Ocaml and Python try to do?  Is such an approach the way forward,
or are hybrids a bad solution?

Am I viewing the issues clearly?  My knowledge of the languages
discussed above is relatively limited.  I am attempting to learn more
about them so I may understand more clearly the answers to my
questions.  I hope that some readers of this email, with more 
experience of different programming languages than I, will be
able to provide feedback to help with this quest.

Happy holiday thinking,

Mark.
