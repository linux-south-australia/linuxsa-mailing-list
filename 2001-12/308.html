Quoting Richard Russell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; ---- quote from patent in a /. Comment ---
&gt; A fundamental building block for client-side content security is a
&gt; secure operating system. If a computer can be booted only into an
&gt; operating system that itself honors content rights, and allows only
&gt; compliant applications to access rights-restricted data, then data
&gt; integrity within the machine can be assured. This stepping-stone to a
&gt; secure operating system is sometimes called "Secure Boot." If secure
&gt; boot cannot be assured, then whatever rights management system the
&gt; secure OS provides, the computer can always be booted into an insecure
&gt; operating system as a step to compromise it. 
&gt; 
&gt; [and the commenter's comment...]
&gt; Let me paraphrase: Microsoft has a patent on an OS that prevents a
&gt; computer from booting anything but the "digital rights OS" Seems to me
&gt; this would do away with dual boot PCs rather nicely. 
&gt; ---- end ----
&gt; 
&gt; And yes, while it's true that anything perceivable by humans must also
&gt; be duplicatable, this will get harder and harder -- you will have to use
&gt; analog methods...

I have two points to make:

1) This can only go sa far - you can put DRM into computers, DVD players etc, 
but you are going to have free reign at the speakers/screen/final output 
device.  There'll always be a mechanism to grab the content, but as you 
mention, it is an issue of convenience due to volume.

2) The IP (intellectual property) net is closing and is a major concern for 
open source software.  As has been mentioned previously here, Netscape would 
not have been decimated if they had an IP portfolio to barter M$ with.  I was 
reading Linus' book and he discusses the IP issue quite well.  The only winners 
are big corporations with armies of lawyers, and the small inventor / company / 
open source project just cannot compete.  *sigh* Why do I raise IP?  Because 
these ideas get patented, groups like the W3C/hardware manufactors are 
faltering and letting standards *depend* upon patents, which effectively locks 
out anyone Microsoft / US Music Industry / Hollywood doesn't want to deal 
with.  

&lt;rant&gt;
There are a couple of options - do everything outside the US, and lobby against 
such monopolistic practices.  Damn, I don't think I ever would say this, but in 
this instance I wish the democrats had stayed in power in the US.  At least 
then it would have been someone else's money filling politician's pockets 
rather than M$'s.
&lt;/rant&gt;
