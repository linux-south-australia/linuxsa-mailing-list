&gt; hiyas,

"hiya"

&gt; i want to point a link in my site to a company i have an 
&gt; afilliate relationship with. how do i keep myname.com/thinggy 
&gt; as the address instead of them.com/thing/thing/444/blahblah??

It's not necessarily possible or (IMHO) ethical...

If their site is set to re-write the URL, then you will have a hard time
trying to change that... I'd be guessing that your best bet would be to
somehow do some sort of proxying over it... Alternatively, you can frame
it -- put something in a frame like a header, like some commercial sites
do, so it looks as if it's your site framing their site... (Ie
myname.com/thinggy [sic] is a frameset, where the top frame is
yourname.com/thinggy/header.html, and the bottom is
them.com/thing/thing/444/blahblah ...)

However, even if you can do that, IMHO, you generally shouldn't, unless
you have an agreement with the company (and if you are an affiliate, you
may...) ... I know this could be a contentious issue, but IMHO, sites
that take content (particularly deep links) from other sites, linking
them into their own sites to make them look like their own content, are
plain rude. I don't really care for the legal nature, but it's rude.
It's also not clever, as the real site could change their URL
structure... Additionally, I personally dislike framed sites, as it
means that if I really wanted to go to the real site, I have to work at
it to get the real URL. IMHO, either provide a normal link, or open a
new window (which itself is a tad rude).

Of course, if the site is designed to be linked in as if it's part of
your site, then that's a different kettle of herring.

PS It's late, I'm tired -- this email isn't meant to be aggressive or
rude, it's just MHO :)
