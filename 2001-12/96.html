&gt; &gt; Linuxsa isn't _that_ organised, and they have a .org.au :)
&gt;
&gt; LinuxSA has a structure, there is a convenor of the meetings
&gt; and attendees at the meetings.  The meetings are regular.
&gt; The attendees know the organisation as "LinuxSA".
&gt; That's all Robert really needs.

yeah, true...

&gt; The proposed opensource.org.au is not describing an organisation,
&gt; but is an generic phrase being used for advocacy purposes.
&gt; As such it's unlikely to get approved without providing
&gt; some information to support the claim that Open Source
&gt; Advocacy Australia is not a front.  Even then Robert would
&gt; probably prefer the name opensourceadvocacy.org.au as
&gt; that wouldn't gazump a common phrase.
&gt;
&gt; This might seem a bit nit-picking, but consider if
&gt; Microsoft created a organisation named Open Source
&gt; and Innovation Australia.  You wouldn't want it getting
&gt; opensource.org.au, and Robert's rules go some way to
&gt; preventing that.

Nah, it makes sense, and I'm not bitter, but it would just be so much easier
if he'd just let me have at it...  :)

I think that in order to reduce the effort required, I'll try a .org name...
