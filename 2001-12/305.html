And it gets worse:


---- quote from patent in a /. Comment ---
A fundamental building block for client-side content security is a
secure operating system. If a computer can be booted only into an
operating system that itself honors content rights, and allows only
compliant applications to access rights-restricted data, then data
integrity within the machine can be assured. This stepping-stone to a
secure operating system is sometimes called "Secure Boot." If secure
boot cannot be assured, then whatever rights management system the
secure OS provides, the computer can always be booted into an insecure
operating system as a step to compromise it. 

[and the commenter's comment...]
Let me paraphrase: Microsoft has a patent on an OS that prevents a
computer from booting anything but the "digital rights OS" Seems to me
this would do away with dual boot PCs rather nicely. 
---- end ----

And yes, while it's true that anything perceivable by humans must also
be duplicatable, this will get harder and harder -- you will have to use
analog methods...

&gt; 
&gt; That is brilliant. I hate it.
&gt; 
&gt; What MS has here, if they can pull it off, is a surefire 
&gt; means to defend against competitors... They will have 
&gt; something that open source simply cannot get -- control over 
&gt; their users.
&gt; 
&gt; If I understand it correctly, it will restrict the use of 
&gt; digital media content in such a way that only approved 
&gt; players can read that data. Ie
&gt; -- if everyone uses MS Windows DRM on their PCs, media 
&gt; companies, in cohorts with MS, will be able to stop 
&gt; "unauthorised" use of media. Hence, promotion of Windows DRM 
&gt; becomes in the best interests of the media companies... So we 
&gt; have media companies trying to force users onto windows DRM, 
&gt; and perhaps to other similar technologies from commercial 
&gt; vendors, but completely away from open source stuff, where it 
&gt; would be possible to circumvent the restrictions.
&gt; 
&gt; EG: if media companies could encrypt their media files in 
&gt; such a way that only those with approved OSes could decrypt 
&gt; them, then where do we go?
&gt; 
&gt; If you think this is easily stopped, or cracked, I wouldn't be so sure
&gt; -- think this through...
&gt; 
&gt; Windows DRM has a private key...
&gt; MS causes all users to register to activate their product, 
&gt; and gives them their own private key (via .NET passport). 
&gt; Every application vendor puts a private key into their 
&gt; media-playing product. Media companies encrypt a decoding key 
&gt; with the above three keys -- you need to have all three to 
&gt; get the key out. With this key, you can then play the 
&gt; movie/music/etc... It's encrypted data otherwise... (of 
&gt; course, the companies register with MS DRM, and get the 
&gt; users' public key from passport, when the user pays for their 
&gt; media licence)
&gt; 
&gt; So what, we just crack the media's key, and hand that around...
&gt; 
&gt; However, to get that, you need Windows' Key, a users' key, 
&gt; and an app vendor's key... These would all be protected under 
&gt; the DRM system... To get them, you'd be struggling, at the 
&gt; hardware (or at least, raw drive) level -- don't expect the 
&gt; keys to be stored on VFAT as c:/MS.key and so on...
&gt; 
&gt; So... What it would mean is that to see media on a 
&gt; non-approved OS (which would have to be closed source), you 
&gt; would be doing illegal things, as well as very hard, very 
&gt; techinical things... So only large-demand media would be "cracked"...
&gt; 
&gt; This is a major major issue... New media is always being 
&gt; produced, and MS will lock that to their OS's in order to 
&gt; keep a competitive advantage... 
&gt; 
&gt; I find this quite frightening...
