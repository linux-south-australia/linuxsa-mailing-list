Hi all,

My wife and I have just moved to Marden in the last week and since then I have been unable to
connect to Dingo Blue at a speed greater than 28.8Kbps.  This is most definately a fault with the line
and not with my system or modem as I have never before had this problem and it occurs in Linux and Losedows.
I am just wondering if there is anything that can be done about it.

As far as I know Telstra only guarentees 28.8Kbps on the lines anyway so I'm not sure as whether I should
complain to them. I have spoken to tech support at Dingo Blue and other friends using the same dialup pop
and both say that there is no problem at the ISP.

Does anyone else on the list live in the marden area? What are your line connections like?
Does anyone know how old the cableing is in this area?

I am currently renting so re-cableing the premesis with cat 5e or alike is out of the question
if the most likely problem is the connections inside the house :-(

I know this isn't exactly list material but any ideas or pointers would be REALLY appreciated.

Thanks everybody.

Nathan Millhouse
