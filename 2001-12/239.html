It depends on what that "other interesting stuff" is, really..
A port scan on its own isn't really anything to get all excited by; if you
go around jumping up and down and crying wolf every time you get port
scanned, then people are going to rapidly start redirecting your mail to
/dev/null.

If they start doing it often, or regularly, or both, then consider taking
action. It's not gauranteed to achieve much though.


Now, the "other interesting stuff".. if some of it appears to be someone
trying out common exploits upon you, then I'd say that's enuf to consider
taking action. (Keeping in mind that some exploits are able to be sent in
such a way that the genuine source IP is replaced with a false one..
possibly in an attempt to frame an innocent party)
What I would do would depend on how bored i was at the time -- given the
time and motivation, i'd probably follow up on the source, see if i could
work out some info about them, etc.
On the other hand, if it wasn't anything likely to eat up much bandwidth,
i'd probably have something better to do with my time and would ignore it.


Anything that's a denial of service tends to get a quick response, because
that has a noticeable impact on you and anyone using your service.

&gt; When reviewing security logs and you find port scans from IP WXYZ and

&gt;
&gt; I do a lookup etc. but the often shows nothing. However sometimes you
&gt; find a "real" computer on the other end. You can ping it, finger it,
&gt; type the IP into a browser and get a webpage.
&gt;
&gt; Now at this point what do you do???
&gt;
&gt; E-mail them (or contact them in some way) and say "hay buddy what's the
&gt; big interest in my system!!!!!"
&gt;
&gt; Or do you say "hmmm sir, it looks like some nasty hacker (or one of your
&gt; staff) may be using your computer to try and hack others, could I sell
&gt; you a firewall?"
&gt;
&gt; Or do you just report them, to whom?
&gt;
&gt; Launch an attack of you own????
&gt;
&gt; Curious,
