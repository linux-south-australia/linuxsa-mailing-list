Hello all,

Having a spot of bother with linux & wondered if anyone could offer some
insight as to the cause.  I have Mandrake 8.1 installed and have had K-mail,
netscape & gFTP working in the way you'd expect them to work.  However I've
recently reinstalled 8.1 and found that afterwards, none of the programs
would make contact with the outside world (via the net).  They don't even
seem to look for an outside world.  This is despite my modem dialing out
correctly and establishing a 'connection', despite me having copied what was
my latest commonhttpd.conf into /etc/httpd/conf & despite the internal
server (<A HREF="http://localhost.localdomain/">http://localhost.localdomain/</A>) working correctly.

A re-reinstallation, and a re-re-reinstalation has not solved the problem
and the messages I get when I try to establish a connection via gFTP or if I
try to find a web site via Netscape are as follows:

gFTP
- looking up domain name
- cannot look up host name
- waiting 30 seconds until trying to connect again

Netscape
-<A HREF="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</A>
Netscape is unable to locate the server www.google.com.  please check the
server name & try again.

I have also tried a "ping test".  After obtaining the connection 'details'
from KPPP, I opened a shell and typed "ping 144.130.44.229" then 'return'.
What I got was: "PING 144.130.44.229 (144.130.44.229) from 144.138.113.78:
56(84) bytes of data".  I got none of the continuous feed of millisecond
ping times that are to be expected from this test..

All of the above problems occur wether or not I am logged in as a 'user' or
as 'root'.

I don't know what to look at from here on in, though I suspect the answer
might be simple ???  I'd be grateful if anybody could please suggest a
soloution to the problem so that linux can again see and interact happily
with the outside world.

Another (unrelated ?) problem seems to exist with the file "ssl_engine_log"
(var/log/httpd/ssl_engine_log).  It records the message "-[warn] init:
(localhost.localdomain:443) RSA server certificate (CN) Œlocalhost¹ does NOT
match server name!?"

Another (again unrelated ?) problem is with setting proxies in Netscape
(4.7) I don't think it is a problem with proxies in Netscape because I have
had Netscape working preveiously without entering proxies.  Nevertheless,
Nescape won¹t even allow me to enter any proxies; when I attempt to enter
ftp or http proxies (Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Proxies &gt; Œmanual proxy
configuration¹ &gt; View), I get the messages:
- FTP proxy host ³<A HREF="ftp://ftp.proxy.bigpond.com">ftp://ftp.proxy.bigpond.com</A>² is unknown
- HTTP proxy host ³<A HREF="http://proxy.bigpond.com">http://proxy.bigpond.com</A>² is unknown

Any clues anybody ?
