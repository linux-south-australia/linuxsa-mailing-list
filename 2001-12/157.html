Hi,

Does anyone have experience with NAS vs a Linux RAID server?

I need to install a storage solution that will scale to ~400Gb in
three years, serving SMB and NFS, as well as NIS, SMTP, POP, IMAP,
HTTP, etc etc etc... The two solutions that have been bandied about
are:

Linux one-size-fits-all RAID server. Lots of Disk, SCSI H/W RAID,
single CPU, lots of RAM, all the services, redundant PSU etc...

NAS box for SMB and NFS, everything else on a separate Linux box, as
above but without all the disks...

The advantage of the NAS box would be that a non-techie is more likely
to be able to administer it, or at least replace things if they go
wrong, and it's an off-the-shelf solution, so when things do go wrong,
you call the manufacturer and make them fix it. The disadvantage would
be it makes two single points of failure, and IMHO would end up being
more complex, not less.

The advantage of the Linux box is that it's easily upgraded when the
time comes, it's non-proprietry (I can get at the OS to fix it) etc.
Disadvantage is that it's not as supported by a H/W manufacturer, and
that it's harder for non-techies to use...

Does anyone have any experience with these? Opinions? Are there any
implications for backup (do NAS devices allow you tp plug in tape
drives and back themselfs (and other servers) up easily?

My feeling is that the single Linux box would be preferable (it will
certainly handle the load here), but I can't put my finger on why...
