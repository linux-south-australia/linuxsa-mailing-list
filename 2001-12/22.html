Some things which I abide by and seem to help are:

1. Default Deny ALL, and only allow what you need.
2. Don't run what you don't use/need, only run what you need on a server.

Subject: Checking Logs Regularly (was samba)


&gt; &gt; crashing has been resolved. Another lesson learned "log files r
&gt; &gt; handy"   :).
&gt;
&gt; A lesson I should have learned a long time ago... if I'd checked my log
&gt; files more regularly (As opposed to when something was awry) I'd have
&gt; found the prick that opened up a huge hole in my computer and installed
&gt; a rootkit + password logger that was sending a password list back to him
&gt; about every 10 minutes while I was online.
&gt;
&gt; Didn't hide it too well, but it was in the logs that they'd opened up
&gt; rpc.statd (go RH7.1 for installing it even when I told it I don't need
&gt; portmapper) with a buffer overflow.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know how much is interesting to people but I can tell the story
&gt; (or what I know of it from trying to work out what was going on) if
&gt; anyone's interested.
&gt;
&gt; Lesson to be learned by all newbies that have any sort of box on the
&gt; net... check your logs regularly (and more regularly than monthly or
&gt; weekly).  I installed a RH7.1 box one day, put it online the next and 11
&gt; hours after it went on it was cracked.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
