&gt;&gt;Why do you dislike it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Bad experience on the mailing lists...
&gt; The head developer has a really bad attitude towards people on the mailing 
&gt; list, and it was as if the person asking the question was an enemy... His 
&gt; attitude really soured an otherwise promising product..


I think the guy(s) behind it are working on it full time, and trying to 
get some funding.  It sounds like they're not getting the sort of 
financial support they're looking for, so are a bit worried about the 
future of the project (and their own status, as they want to get paid).

It doesn't excuse bad behavior, but it might help explain it.

Speaking of bad behavior, there's a LinuxWorld article about MPlayer:
&lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1214.mplayer.html&gt">http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1214.mplayer.html&gt</A>;

I've installed MPlayer, and found it to be fairly self-documenting.  I 
think the writer is a little too harsh.  (Altho the project does bag Red 
Hat's gcc-2.96 somewhat excessively -- I guess they've got a lot of bug 
reports that only occur on gcc-2.96.)

On the other hand, I've had contact with people from all over open 
source (including Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, KDE, and FreeBSD), and they've 
usually been quite helpful and friendly.  It's this sort of positive 
attitude that I feel makes open source projects more enjoyable, and more 
likely to gain further helpers.  I dislike when any project is overly rude.

(I'm also glad that I've seen fewer RTFM responses on LinuxSA of late!)

Yours
