Hello Nathan,

Apart from dodgy cabling...  You may find your line is connected to a RIM
(sorry - forget what it stands for), which is in turn connected to your
exchange.  Telstra uses RIMs to avoid excess copper cabling, so they run
fibre out to a RIM, and run copper from the RIM.  The RIM restricts your
dialin speeds to 28.8k.  I have the same problem in QLD, as have many others
on the list.

It seems the only way to get a faster than 28.8k connection, is to get
Telstra's Onramp Home Highway, and put an analogue modem on one of the
analogue connectors on it.  Results in an untimed 50k connection.  (BTW -
Telstra refuse to install ADSL over a RIM :( )

Hopefully the information about the RIM is correct, otherwise I'm sure
someone here will correct me :)

~Rhett

Subject: OT: Dialup modem speed


Hi all,

My wife and I have just moved to Marden in the last week and since then I
have been unable to
connect to Dingo Blue at a speed greater than 28.8Kbps.  This is most
definately a fault with the line
and not with my system or modem as I have never before had this problem and
it occurs in Linux and Losedows.
I am just wondering if there is anything that can be done about it.

As far as I know Telstra only guarentees 28.8Kbps on the lines anyway so I'm
not sure as whether I should
complain to them. I have spoken to tech support at Dingo Blue and other
friends using the same dialup pop
and both say that there is no problem at the ISP.

Does anyone else on the list live in the marden area? What are your line
connections like?
Does anyone know how old the cableing is in this area?

I am currently renting so re-cableing the premesis with cat 5e or alike is
out of the question
if the most likely problem is the connections inside the house :-(

I know this isn't exactly list material but any ideas or pointers would be
REALLY appreciated.

Thanks everybody.

Nathan Millhouse
