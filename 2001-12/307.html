There are a number of serious players (no pun intended) in the DRM market,
and Microsoft is arguably not the leading contender.  The winner is going
to be decided by the content owners, hence it is telling that Microsoft
are partners with Sony and Vivendi/Unversal.  RealNetworks have their
DRM software which, not surprisingly works with their RealPlayer but not
with MS's MediaPlayer.  They partner with AOL Time Warner, EMI MUsic, BMG
Music, CBS, and others.  Yet another, InterTrust, who make DRM software
that plugs into the players of RealNetworks, MusicMatch and Sonique, but
do not make no player of their own, partner with AOL, BMG, Universal, Sony
and others.  Without content a DRM enabled player is useless, and as Marc
Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre said, "Microsoft
has not established itself as the Fort Knox of Internet privacy."

Without a doubt DRM is going to make life less rosy for those who want to
steal content, or even just make fair use of it, but even with Microsoft's
best efforts, I do not believe that Windows will be the only platform
that can play DRM protected media.  RealNetworks already support free
unix, and probably will continue to do so.

"Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it."  Eventually
the entertainment industry will discover the success enjoyed by software
producers and their long battle with pirates.  They will discover that
copy protection schemes are expensive to produce, and entertaining for
thieves, and that ultimately the thieves win.  DRM will be no different.
Robust watermarks aren't.  Encrypted media isn't.  Copy protection
doesn't.  Line out connects to line in.  Game over.  They lose.
