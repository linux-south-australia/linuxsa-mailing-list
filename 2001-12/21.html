&gt; crashing has been resolved. Another lesson learned "log files r
&gt; handy"   :).

A lesson I should have learned a long time ago... if I'd checked my log
files more regularly (As opposed to when something was awry) I'd have
found the prick that opened up a huge hole in my computer and installed
a rootkit + password logger that was sending a password list back to him
about every 10 minutes while I was online.

Didn't hide it too well, but it was in the logs that they'd opened up
rpc.statd (go RH7.1 for installing it even when I told it I don't need
portmapper) with a buffer overflow.

I don't know how much is interesting to people but I can tell the story
(or what I know of it from trying to work out what was going on) if
anyone's interested.

Lesson to be learned by all newbies that have any sort of box on the
net... check your logs regularly (and more regularly than monthly or
weekly).  I installed a RH7.1 box one day, put it online the next and 11
hours after it went on it was cracked.

Cheers,
Adam
