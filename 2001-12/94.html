&gt; Because I just got so excited about this whole letter to the IT
&gt; minister/openz.org thing, I decided to request opensource.org.au for
&gt; "Open Source Software Advocacy Australia"... A long name, but

snuh...

Seems .org.au don't like us -- "not enough of an organisation"...

text of rejection email included below... (long)

Not quite sure what should be done now -- we could do what openz did, and go
a .org (it's not expensive, so I could donate that), or we could try to come
up with enough of an "organisation" so that .org.au can identify us...
strange... Linuxsa isn't _that_ organised, and they have a .org.au :)



----
Your request for registration of the domain opensource.org.au has NOT been
undertaken.

This is because the domain administrator has indicated that the domain
name request has not been accepted. If you wish to include further
information in relation to this request you may choose to do so by
resubmitting the original domain name request with the additional
information included as comment in the request form.

The domain administrator, <A HREF="mailto:hostmaster@munnari.oz.au">hostmaster@munnari.oz.au</A>, provided the following
comments:


Information on the structure, status, etc, of the organisation is required
(which can sometimes include information on the aims or purposes of the
organisation, that is sometimes useful, but alone is not sufficient).

There may be an organisation here which could register an org.au domain
name,
but if there is it must be properly described, so that it is possible to
determine exactly what the organisation is, and when a decision claimed to
have been made by the organisation has been properly made.

Incorporation isn't required - some kind of structure is.

The preceding comments are from a selection of standard form responses.
Some may not apply directly to your application, their point is to give
a general idea of the type of problem that occurred with this request.
This paragraph, and the rest of this message, is standard boilerplate
that is included with all ORG.AU domain name rejection messages.

Note that to request a review of this, the best (only) way to achieve this,
is to resubmit the request, and include explanatory information in the
comments.   Sending other messages cannot achieve a new registration,
at best it might result in a message indicating that the form should be
resubmitted with additional comments.

However, please do note that the DNS is a tool to allow use of the
internet, it allows reasonable human rational names to be mapped to
the low level addresses that the protocol require.  It is not a tool
for advertising, product promotion, or the like, and requests that
appear to be requiring domain names for those purposes, where some
other name already exists, or could be created as a sub-domain, are
very unlikely to ever be created.

Organisations should note that only one ORG.AU domain name will be
allocated to any organisation, and only when no other domain name exists
for the organisation.   "Organisation" for this purpose is treated quite
broadly, projects, branches, clubs, (etc) of an organisation are all (for
ORG.AU purposes) considered to be a part of the one organisation.  Any
domain name (shorter than about 250 characters total length) can have
sub-domains (that is, an additional label, preceding the domain name,
separated by a dot).    Use one ORG.AU domain name for the organisation,
then create sub-domains (as many as needed) for its projects, branches,
business units, activities, or anything else for which a domain name is
needed.   Note that there is no practical difference in what domain a
name is registered -- a domain created in Q.ORG.AU (giving X.Q.ORG.AU or
similar) is just as much a domain name as a domain created in ORG.AU
(like Q.ORG.AU) and has all the same properties.   Sub-domains are
created by the management of the domain concerned, there are no AUNIC
forms to complete to register a sub-domain of a domain.

One of the most common reasons that ORG.AU requests fail is for failing
to supply enough information about the structure of the organisation.
Most requests describe (often in far too much detail) all the good work
the organisation does - which is almost irrelevant to an ORG.AU request,
evil organisations get domains just as easily as wonderful ones - but
often nothing at all actually supplies the information necessary to
determine just what the organisation is.   That is, if two different
people claim that they represent the organisation and that something
should be changed about the way the ORG.AU domain is listed, there needs
to be a way to determine, from externally, which of them, if either,
actually represents the wishes of the organisation as an entity.
This cannot depend upon any person named at the time of the application,
as they may no longer be associated in any way.   There needs to be
enough reference to the structure of the organisation so that the way
it makes decisions, who is able to represent it, etc, can be determined.

If the organisation is incorporated (which is not a requirement for an
ORG.AU name - but if it is) then just give its incorporation number
and the organisation that issued it - an ACN issued by ASC, or associations
incorporation number issued by state XXX.   If there is no number,
indicate what body incorporated the organisation, and how (incorporated
by statute in NSW or similar).   Then no more is needed, as the information
can always be obtained from he documents lodged in order to obtain
incorporation.

If the organisation is not incorporated, it is likely to need a structure
very similar to that which would need to exist to incorporate it, but
without the other obligations and costs of incorporation (nor the
benefits of course).   If that doesn't exist, then there is most probably
not enough of an organised "organisation" to obtain an ORG.AU domain.

Please use the WWW form found by following links from
<A HREF="http://www.aunic.net">http://www.aunic.net</A>
for domain registration requests - e-mail requests tend to
fail to supply all necessary information (and are ignored anyway).
Delegation requests should be done using a different form found from
the same base URL.

now _that's_ verbose! :)
