&gt; So take your business off of the cable and on to ADSL... wouldn't
&gt; that be the logical thing to do?

We were originally going to get ADSL, but at the time were told that it was
unavailable to us, even though Hellstra had previously told us it was OK.
Then decided to go for cable, signed up for a 12 month contract, and about a
week later they stuck a 3 gb cap on it.

Was not feeling very happy with Telstra at that point in time.

Although its possible telstra (or internode?) have installed an extra dslam
in prospect by now, the startup costs are a pain.. its like we've already
paid a bunch to get the cable modem installed (not that i can work out how
come its so expensive for a techy to come around, plug a cable modem into
the existing foxtel socket, and plug his ethernet cable into the back of the
modem and into a PC and go away again..), and so doing the same for ADSL
feels a bit much.

I'm sure i could get out of the cable contact without paying the
break-of-contract fee, since i've complained to telstra regularly about the
cable/adsl problem and there's no sign of them fixing it anytime soon.
Amusingly, entering our username into the online bigpond thing causes an
error message instead of logging us on, and that hasn't been fixed in about
6 months either.

Eh, telstra cable - it works more reliably than telstra adsl -- but that
isn't saying much.

&gt; Re: the original question, of course other non-Telstra ADSL providers
&gt; already route out via SA direct - Telstra is not the only choice. For
&gt; various reasons, I do expect Telstra to progressively route out via
&gt; each state capital city for their own retail product 'soon', even if
&gt; they haven't finished doing it yet.
