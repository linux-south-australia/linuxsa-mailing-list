Hey all,

I have SUSE 7.1 installed on a laptop here and X/KDE2 works fine as long as
I don't let it sit long enough to go into suspend mode.  Going into and
being in suspend mode works as well.  It's the return from suspend mode that
kills the graphics.  The screen is about 1/2 the size and it overlays itself
left to right.  I have tried messing with the apmd settings in
/etc/rc.config.d/apm.rc.config with no success (including leave X during
suspend and such).  If anyone has any ideas what it could be I would
appreciate it.

Chuck's Top 10 Things to Remember and Think about!
=======================================================
10. Please return stewardess to original upright position.
9. Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity.
8. Never date someone because you're too lazy to commit suicide.
7. It is not the fall that kills you.  it's the sudden stop at the end.
6. You can't have everything.  Where would you put it all?
5. " Real Windows Performance", on the next "In Search Of".
4. 2 rules to success in life. 1. Don't tell people everything you know.
3. 24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case.  Coincidence?
2. 9 out of 10 men who try Camels prefer women.
1. Always borrow money from a pesimist.  They never expect it back anyway.

That's it!  NO MORE! JEEZ! GET BACK TO WORK!
