continuing from the first part of this response (KMail doesn't seem to like 
long responses) . . . 

After making these changes and rebooting the system, and dialing up, the 
computer can again see the outside world.  Somehow I seem to have got it 
right.  If not right, then workable.  I'm not sure if all of these changes 
were necessary though, particularly as after rebooting and checking them I 
found that all settings within Adaptor 1 (both those I had changed and those 
I had not changed) had altogether disappeared) and all that remained within 
Adaptor 1 was the "enabled" button checked.

I'd be curious to know whether all the changes I made were necessary or not 
and whether there are other changes that are indicated by the information 
provided above.

Cheers,

Andrew L
