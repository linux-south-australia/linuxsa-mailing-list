but... then they might not be able to use their current excuses to charge
customers $0.34 / Mb of traffic (upstream OR downstream)...
and we can't have that.. it might impinge upon their profit margins, lower
their share price, and annoy all those people who bought shares, who will
blame the government, and might not vote those liberal $%#%s back in for a
3rd time.


sorry, got carried away there.
Telstra's pricing model is basically "as much as the customer can take",
which is a fair call for a capitalist economy. It just sucks when you're on
the receiving end of it.

Still, i guess telstra cable is doing better than @Home cable in the states
;)
