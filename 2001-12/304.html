That is brilliant. I hate it.

What MS has here, if they can pull it off, is a surefire means to defend
against competitors... They will have something that open source simply
cannot get -- control over their users.

If I understand it correctly, it will restrict the use of digital media
content in such a way that only approved players can read that data. Ie
-- if everyone uses MS Windows DRM on their PCs, media companies, in
cohorts with MS, will be able to stop "unauthorised" use of media.
Hence, promotion of Windows DRM becomes in the best interests of the
media companies... So we have media companies trying to force users onto
windows DRM, and perhaps to other similar technologies from commercial
vendors, but completely away from open source stuff, where it would be
possible to circumvent the restrictions.

EG: if media companies could encrypt their media files in such a way
that only those with approved OSes could decrypt them, then where do we
go?

If you think this is easily stopped, or cracked, I wouldn't be so sure
-- think this through...

Windows DRM has a private key...
MS causes all users to register to activate their product, and gives
them their own private key (via .NET passport).
Every application vendor puts a private key into their media-playing
product.
Media companies encrypt a decoding key with the above three keys -- you
need to have all three to get the key out. With this key, you can then
play the movie/music/etc... It's encrypted data otherwise... (of course,
the companies register with MS DRM, and get the users' public key from
passport, when the user pays for their media licence)

So what, we just crack the media's key, and hand that around...

However, to get that, you need Windows' Key, a users' key, and an app
vendor's key... These would all be protected under the DRM system... To
get them, you'd be struggling, at the hardware (or at least, raw drive)
level -- don't expect the keys to be stored on VFAT as c:/MS.key and so
on...

So... What it would mean is that to see media on a non-approved OS
(which would have to be closed source), you would be doing illegal
things, as well as very hard, very techinical things... So only
large-demand media would be "cracked"...

This is a major major issue... New media is always being produced, and
MS will lock that to their OS's in order to keep a competitive
advantage... 

I find this quite frightening...
