Hi all,

I have got two separate machines that are both getting random FS
corruption with relatively similar symptoms.  My definition here is
randomly having characters within files changed (commonly headers). They
have no common hardware, except they are both Pentium II boxen and the
drives are IDE.

What kind of things could cause these errors?  I am thinking hardware
failure/incompatibility.

Some info on the machines:

One box: FreeBSD 4.3-RELEASE.  Some Compaq box with Compaq hardware.

With this one, the problems only occured after installing a 10GB drive
into the box.  It also has a SCSI drive and after taking the 10GB out,
it works fine again.[1] I tried two fresh installs of FreeBSD and had
these problems. 

Trying to build the kernel from source reports an error like: 'parse
error before character \0347' [from memory], which is the character that
had changed.  Replacing the character and writing the file fixes the
problem until the next changed file.

The other box is running Linux 2.2.19.  This one has a SIS mobo.  In
this case it has similar parse errors.  It also has segmentation faults
when compiling programs but I am unsure if the swap partition is getting
corrupted also =&gt; these problems.

Any tips/suggestions on where to look to diagnose the problems?



[1] Reinstalling the system onto the SCSI fixed the problem, I am
currently running the drive in another box to see if it will build and
have the same problems.


Thanks in advance,
