Quoting Michael Wardle &lt;<A HREF="mailto:michael.wardle@adacel.com">michael.wardle@adacel.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; In general, it is best to have the swap partition as the last partition.
&gt; Doing so means that the data lies on the outermost part of the disk
&gt; where the transfer rates are greatest.  Remember that swap is usually
&gt; trying to emulate physical memory which has a 1000 times greater
&gt; transfer rate, so every little bit of performance is worth trying for.

I think we've discussed this before on list - where your data ends up may not be 
where you think it is - so just because you use the last cylinders/sectors as 
reported by fdisk does not mean you are using the outside edge of the disk.  
Virtual addressing means it could go anywhere, but I accept that if you are 
trying to optimise this you might as well put it at the end and see what 
happens.

If you're swapping due to programs (not buffer/cache) using all RAM you are 
indeed stuffed performance wise and you need to shell out for more RAM as you 
mention.
 
&gt; Alternatively, buy lots of RAM so that you never have to swap.  :-P

I have 1/2 a gig and use all of it most of the time due to buffers and cache, of 
course the amount that gets buffered reduces as my real need increases.  It 
appears you will always swap, no matter how much RAM you have, at least under 
early 2.4 kernels.  This isn't a bad thing like I mention if it's all in 
buffer/cache, afterall, if you have the RAM why not use it? :)
 
&gt; Do you ever get the feeling you should've just bought two hard disks?
&gt; (I do.)

That's another solution, but only if on seperate controllers, and preferably if 
they're ultra wide SCSI or something else that screams.

Michael...
