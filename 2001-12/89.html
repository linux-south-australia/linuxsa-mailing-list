First of all, I am sorry for sending this to the list.  I do believe it
will reach an appropriate audience and that it is related, strongly, to
Linux.

Hi everyone,
   I am looking for someone with as many of the following skills as
possible;

	- Sound TCPIP knowledge
	- Sendmail
	- Squid
	- Apache
	- SNMP
	- DNS/BIND
	- SAMBA
	- Watchguard Firbox fire-walls
	- RADIUS
	- PPP RAS
	- Cisco IOS
	- Frame Relay
	- ISDN
	- RAS
	- Lotus Notes
	- Win 9x/ME/NT/2000
	- MS SQL server
	- MS IIS server
	- etc,etc,etc....

OK, so it is a long list and most of it I would expect to find here.

The primary purpose for the position would be to provide user and
 network support in a small friendly team.

I am looking for CV's from people with the above skills to support my
request to management to get someone onto a contract for about three
months in the new year.  If the position is created I would like to
contact anyone that replies, possibly to arrange for an interview.

It is also possible that the same position could become permanent some
time after the proposed initial 3 months.

The company is based South of Adelaide with a WAN consisting of around
14 frame-relay links, 8 ISDN tails, 2 overseas VPN's, 11 Lotus Notes
server, 1 ADSL Internet connection, 1 ISDN Internet connection 7 or so
Linux servers and a multitude of other servers.

The essential requirement are a Sound TCPIP knowledge AND experienced with
Linux(Redhat 3/4/5/6/7) Administration with a reasonable exposure to
Windows.


NOTE: We do not currently have a position available!

	Merry Christmas,
		Steven Ellison
