Hi,
I use Xine 0.9.6 with libdvdcss1.0.0 libdvdread0.9.2 and xine-dvdnav0.9.5,
it works for all of my 11 encrypted dvd's ok, some better than others
though(usually time to decrypt the keys, and then dvdnav not doing what it
should with the menu's) the second disc of texas chainsaw massacre fails to
play(well it does but i aint waiting 20-30mins for it to get all the keys or
whatever! and maybe not even work....) 
all up though im well pleased with Xine as it (mostly) runs nicely on my
ibook.

Subject: encrypted DVD's


Hi 

I've been playing arround with DVD video players under MDK 8.1 and
having good success with unencrypted DVD's but not with encrypted ones,
I've installed Xine with the xine-lib-d4d plugin which is supposed to
allow decryption. if anyone has success storys with encypted play back
the I'd be interested in hearing them and knowing what was used etc

regards Darrin
