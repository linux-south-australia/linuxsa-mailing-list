opensource.org.au]


&gt; &gt; From the people that brought you "whereisbob.com.au"... :-/
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure you're aware, but the .com.au and the .org.au domains are run
by
&gt; different people...

Yep.  :-)

Nonetheless, it's very disappointing to be denied a .net.au or .com.au
on the grounds that they're "only for registered companies", and the
(sub)domain must coincide with the company name, then to see large
companies such as McDonald's get whatever domains they want.  &gt;:-(

&gt; &gt; (Australian domain registration seems a little bit of a mixed bag.)
&gt;
&gt; yes... a lot stricter than it could be... I _still_ don't know if
that's a
&gt; good thing or not -- there's pros and cons...

I disagree with the openness of international domains (.com, and so on),
as most laypersons now seem to think that everything is .com.  This must
surely have been part of the drive for .biz, which as far as I can tell,
pretty much serves the purpose .com did.  IMHO .com should be an
international domain, but I guess this opinion ignores the (American)
roots of the internet.

On the other hand, I am disappointed that .au domains are overly
restrictive, and seem to be restricted to large groups and companies.
For me, it was far easier to get a .net or .com than a .net.au or
.com.au, yet I'm an Australian.

There needs to be a balance somewhere, where only companies can have
.com.*, only educational institutions can have .edu.*, yet it is
possible for small companies and individuals to have their own (perhaps
more obscure) domain.  This may be allowed in the USA by the
introduction (and use) or .us.  I wonder what we can do here...

That's at least two cents' worth there.

Regards.
