Ahh, ok..
I know that your code needs to be written to suit, but i assumed you'd
already have something like that written if you thought you would get more
performance out of extra CPUs.. i also got the impression your codebase was
still in development or something.

But, given what you've said, yeah, i can see it isn't going to help you too
much to get a cluster. Pity, because doing so would result in by far the
most economical solution.

Are you sure you can't determine a simple place to split the existing code
into run-lengths? (eg. it'd be nice if there was a loop in a high-level
function (main? hehe) that went from beginning to end in single unit
steps..)

&gt; &gt; cheapest solution, and possibly the best solution too, might be to Beowulf

&gt; &gt; u can probably get a bunch at under $2k each, so $10k should get you
&gt; five..
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, "Beowulf" isn't as simple as just connecting a bunch of
&gt; machines together. It usually involves some sort of code re-writing:
&gt;
&gt; (from the Beowulf FAQ -- <A HREF="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/beowulf-faq.txt">http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/beowulf-faq.txt</A>)
&gt; ----
&gt; 3. Can I take my software and run it on a Beowulf and have it go faster?
&gt; [1999-05-13]
&gt;
&gt; Maybe, if you put some work into it.  You need to split it into
&gt; parallel tasks that communicate using MPI or PVM or network sockets or
&gt; SysV IPC.  Then you need to recompile it.
&gt; ...
&gt; ----
&gt;
&gt; The software that I want to run here is not written as a parallel job, nor
&gt; is it easily parallelisable (it may be, but I'm not about to trawl through
&gt; hundreds of thousands of lines of up-to-20-year-old heavily mathematical
&gt; code to find out)... each "run" tends to go for an hour or more, and appears
&gt; as a single process on a process listing. It's not even threaded. The
&gt; advantage I wish to get is to be able to have a number of people using this
&gt; machine interactively, and then when one or more of them compile or compute,
&gt; not have the rest of them suffer while the box is hosed for an hour. Using a
&gt; MOSIX-like cluster was one idea that I thought may give me that, with some
&gt; extra reliability thrown in, without the cost of a 4-way SMP machine.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you go for the real budget PCs, $10k would get you about 20 headless
&gt; &gt; machines!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Even if each processor is only quarter the speed of a quad-way 2GHz p4,
&gt; &gt; you've still got many more times the grunt overall
&gt;
&gt; ... for particular problem types (or at least, for problems expressed in
&gt; their most parallel fashion)... sometimes, a process is limited by the speed
&gt; of a single CPU...
