Hi
Ive been looking for this book you recommended (Rute users .... by Paul
Sheer) on Dymocks and  Angus and Robertsons Site and the closest I can get
is the following title

 Linux Certification Handbook:  Preparing for the RHCE and LPI Exams  -
$77.95
This is the only book either search engine comes up with for this Author and
ISBN number.
Searching for Rute gave no results.

Is this the same book you were recommending?

Thanks
David Delyn

Couldn't get through to The Bookshelf or the UNI shop will try again later.

&gt; Hi There,
&gt;     I would suggest 2 books that are probably required
&gt; purchasing or obtaining about Linux. The first is "A
&gt; Practical Guide to Linux" by Mark G. Sobell ISBN
&gt; 0-201-89549-8 (Addison Wesley). It is a very good book with
&gt; heaps of examples and suggestions to admin a Linux system.
&gt; It covers everything from how to write scripts to
&gt; downloading and compiling software off the net. Excellent
&gt; starter and Netcraft sell heaps of them in Adelaide.
&gt;
&gt;     The second book I now believe to be REQUIRED reading by
&gt; new Linux Admins (I didn't believe all the hype on the net
&gt; about this book, but believe me it is true) The book is
&gt; "Linux - Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition" by Paul Scheer
&gt; ISBN0-13-033351-4 (Prentice Hall). This book expands on the
&gt; first book well beyond, and gives excellent PRACTICAL
&gt; knowledge, and also knowledge not covered by the first book
&gt; (like how libraries actually work - you learn by creating
&gt; Static and Dynamic Linked Libraries and then using them). It
&gt; also teaches things like how to set up scripts to create
&gt; multiple users files from a user list (the sort of thing
&gt; that some companies do often). The book covers C programming
&gt; TCP/IP, DNS, Apache, mail, Samba - just about you name it.
&gt;
&gt;     The other claims this book makes, (and I believe it), is
&gt; that it is truly Distribution Neutral (ie pick a distro and
&gt; you will still be able to use this book), and that it will
&gt; teach you not only enough to pass any Linux Certification
&gt; (RHCE, etc.), but also to have real practical knowledge to
&gt; use on a system that some certifications apparently lack.
&gt; You know, the Uni graduate can write a program, but the TAFE
&gt; graduate can actually program (or what I really want is a
&gt; Programmer, not a Software Engineer). Well this book gives
&gt; you the knowledge to be both Certified AND Practical, and do
&gt; them well.
&gt;
&gt;     The hype on the Internet is this book is quite simply
&gt; the best, and after I bought a copy, I whole heartedly
&gt; agree. Hope this has helped.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am a real newbie at Linux and guess what... I have to
&gt; maintain a server
&gt; &gt; that has been set up by someone else.  I can code in C++,
&gt; Java  and
&gt; &gt; understand protocols and network stuff etc but I have had
&gt; little to do with
&gt; &gt; unix or linux.
&gt; &gt; What I would like is any suggestions for book/courses.  I
&gt; always find that
&gt; &gt; when I am learning a new system, that I end up getting a
&gt; book that looks
&gt; &gt; in-depth to me in the shop, but when I get down to it, it
&gt; never goes far
&gt; &gt; enough.  A book that describes, step by step, the process
&gt; for building a
&gt; &gt; server along with some deeper knowledge for doing tricky
&gt; stuff.  I also need
&gt; &gt; it to be concise and get me up to speed very quickly - I
&gt; don't really have
&gt; &gt; time to sit down and become emersed in it (one day - after
&gt; uni, after I
&gt; &gt; finish my house etc etc)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically (after all that) Can anyone recommend any good
&gt; linux server books
&gt; &gt; ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Pete
