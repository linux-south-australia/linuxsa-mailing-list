TechRepublic, a good source for info and tech oriented books have just 
brought out a new one they call the Administrator's Guide to Linux in 
the Enterprise.
  The book seems to be aimed at helping Admin's and other managers 
evaluate Linux in terms of the Enterprise. What worries me a little is 
the suggestion that maybe there is a considerable loss involved in 
shifting over to Linux. At least that is what I got from their blurb 
they sent me;

"Linux has arrived and is being incorporated into the IT structure of 
organizations around the world. But is Linux right for you? An open-
source system like Linux offers a lot, but what are you giving up in 
return? Discover the pros and cons, ins and outs of utilizing Linux as 
your IT solution with TechRepublic's Administrator's Guide to Linux in 
the Enterprise book and CD-ROM. We've filtered through the marketing 
hype to bring you the information you need to make informed decisions 
that everyone can live with! "

What is your take on this book and especially how important do you 
think this comment is  "... but what are you giving up in return? " to 
giving an accurate picture of the pros and cons of converting to a 
Linux shop?

The info for the site is at

which also takes you to a free preview section of the book.

Come on pro's on the list, is this a book people should read or are 
there better sources of info that would be more helpful?  More accurate?
 
Cheers, Ian
