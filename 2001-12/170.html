Try looking at `ifconfig -a`, `netstat -rn` and so on -- see what your
ppp connection is connecting to (Point to Point Protocol -- it connectes
you (say 1.2.3.4) to the server (say 1.2.3.5))... See if you can ping
the other end of your ppp connection... See if your routing tables are
correct... 

What you describe (with ping) sounds as if your system has an incorrect
route set up.

&gt; Subject: Help? linux can't see out all of a sudden
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Having a spot of bother with linux & wondered if anyone could 
&gt; offer some insight as to the cause.  I have Mandrake 8.1 
&gt; installed and have had K-mail, netscape & gFTP working in the 
&gt; way you'd expect them to work.  However I've recently 
&gt; reinstalled 8.1 and found that afterwards, none of the 
&gt; programs would make contact with the outside world (via the 
&gt; net).  They don't even seem to look for an outside world.  
&gt; This is despite my modem dialing out correctly and 
&gt; establishing a 'connection', despite me having copied what 
&gt; was my latest commonhttpd.conf into /etc/httpd/conf & despite 
&gt; the internal server (<A HREF="http://localhost.localdomain/">http://localhost.localdomain/</A>) working correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; A re-reinstallation, and a re-re-reinstalation has not solved 
&gt; the problem and the messages I get when I try to establish a 
&gt; connection via gFTP or if I try to find a web site via 
&gt; Netscape are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; gFTP
&gt; - looking up domain name
&gt; - cannot look up host name
&gt; - waiting 30 seconds until trying to connect again
&gt; 
&gt; Netscape
&gt; -<A HREF="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</A>
&gt; Netscape is unable to locate the server www.google.com.  
&gt; please check the server name & try again.
&gt; 
&gt; I have also tried a "ping test".  After obtaining the 
&gt; connection 'details' from KPPP, I opened a shell and typed 
&gt; "ping 144.130.44.229" then 'return'. What I got was: "PING 
&gt; 144.130.44.229 (144.130.44.229) from 144.138.113.78:
&gt; 56(84) bytes of data".  I got none of the continuous feed of 
&gt; millisecond ping times that are to be expected from this test..
&gt; 
&gt; All of the above problems occur wether or not I am logged in 
&gt; as a 'user' or as 'root'.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what to look at from here on in, though I 
&gt; suspect the answer might be simple ???  I'd be grateful if 
&gt; anybody could please suggest a soloution to the problem so 
&gt; that linux can again see and interact happily with the outside world.
&gt; 
&gt; Another (unrelated ?) problem seems to exist with the file 
&gt; "ssl_engine_log" (var/log/httpd/ssl_engine_log).  It records 
&gt; the message "-[warn] init:
&gt; (localhost.localdomain:443) RSA server certificate (CN) 
&gt; Œlocalhost¹ does NOT match server name!?"
&gt; 
&gt; Another (again unrelated ?) problem is with setting proxies 
&gt; in Netscape
&gt; (4.7) I don't think it is a problem with proxies in Netscape 
&gt; because I have had Netscape working preveiously without 
&gt; entering proxies.  Nevertheless, Nescape won¹t even allow me 
&gt; to enter any proxies; when I attempt to enter ftp or http 
&gt; proxies (Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Proxies &gt; Œmanual 
&gt; proxy configuration¹ &gt; View), I get the messages:
&gt; - FTP proxy host ³<A HREF="ftp://ftp.proxy.bigpond.com">ftp://ftp.proxy.bigpond.com</A>² is unknown
&gt; - HTTP proxy host ³<A HREF="http://proxy.bigpond.com">http://proxy.bigpond.com</A>² is unknown
&gt; 
&gt; Any clues anybody ?
