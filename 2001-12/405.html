Smoothwall is a good product and is VERY easy to set up, even with no Linux
experience. I'd recommend it in a flash to home users that wanted a stable
secure firewall product.

I agree that Richard Morell ( Lead developer ) is a very abrasive person,
but given the time he must spend on the product I can see why he might be.
He was personally going through all the posts on the mailing list ( Don't
know how he found the time ) and jumped down on anybody that hadn't RTFM.

If you are a corporate there is now a Support option that can be purchased
for Smoothwall.

I use a Smoothwall box at home for my ADSL connection and highly recommend
it. Use it at work too on remote site for dial in and modem sharing.....my
10c worth

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Bleh... I hate smoothwall.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Why do you dislike it?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bad experience on the mailing lists...
&gt; &gt; The head developer has a really bad attitude towards people
&gt; on the mailing
&gt; &gt; list, and it was as if the person asking the question was
&gt; an enemy... His
&gt; &gt; attitude really soured an otherwise promising product..
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think the guy(s) behind it are working on it full time, and
&gt; trying to
&gt; get some funding.  It sounds like they're not getting the sort of
&gt; financial support they're looking for, so are a bit worried about the
&gt; future of the project (and their own status, as they want to
&gt; get paid).
&gt;
&gt; It doesn't excuse bad behavior, but it might help explain it.
&gt;
&gt; Speaking of bad behavior, there's a LinuxWorld article about MPlayer:
&gt; &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1214.mplayer.html&gt">http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1214.mplayer.html&gt</A>;
&gt;
&gt; I've installed MPlayer, and found it to be fairly
&gt; self-documenting.  I
&gt; think the writer is a little too harsh.  (Altho the project
&gt; does bag Red
&gt; Hat's gcc-2.96 somewhat excessively -- I guess they've got a
&gt; lot of bug
&gt; reports that only occur on gcc-2.96.)
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, I've had contact with people from all over open
&gt; source (including Red Hat, SuSE, Debian, KDE, and FreeBSD),
&gt; and they've
&gt; usually been quite helpful and friendly.  It's this sort of positive
&gt; attitude that I feel makes open source projects more
&gt; enjoyable, and more
&gt; likely to gain further helpers.  I dislike when any project
&gt; is overly rude.
&gt;
&gt; (I'm also glad that I've seen fewer RTFM responses on LinuxSA
&gt; of late!)
&gt;
&gt; Yours
