Hi all.

Just a followup to the X and Rodent problems I was having.  After some
more detailed reading (actually, I was just reading the supported
hardware list of Xfree 4) I found what looked like the solution to my
probs.

When you install, Intellimouse Explorer (and those that emulate it) are
detected as Intellimouse (standard).  The mouse was assigned the line
"IMPS/2".  I changed that to "ExplorerPS/2" and rebooted (I had to
reboot for some reason - killing with ctrl-alt-bksp didn't seem to make
it reinit the mouse).

I've been using it for about an hour and a half now and I haven't seen
any problems with the mouse going crappy yet.  It usually died within
half an hour of logging in.  Hopefully it's fixed.

I don't know why the Explorer mouse would be any different from the
standard Intellimouse in terms of its protocol, but it appears that the
different setting has solved the problem.  So, for those few who replied
and are experiencing similar (or worse) problems with their M$ rodents,
try changing the mouse type in the X config.  Turning off GPM is also
recommended if you don't use the console much.

Cheers,
Adam
