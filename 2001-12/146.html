Hi There,
    I would suggest 2 books that are probably required
purchasing or obtaining about Linux. The first is "A
Practical Guide to Linux" by Mark G. Sobell ISBN
0-201-89549-8 (Addison Wesley). It is a very good book with
heaps of examples and suggestions to admin a Linux system.
It covers everything from how to write scripts to
downloading and compiling software off the net. Excellent
starter and Netcraft sell heaps of them in Adelaide.

    The second book I now believe to be REQUIRED reading by
new Linux Admins (I didn't believe all the hype on the net
about this book, but believe me it is true) The book is
"Linux - Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition" by Paul Scheer
ISBN0-13-033351-4 (Prentice Hall). This book expands on the
first book well beyond, and gives excellent PRACTICAL
knowledge, and also knowledge not covered by the first book
(like how libraries actually work - you learn by creating
Static and Dynamic Linked Libraries and then using them). It
also teaches things like how to set up scripts to create
multiple users files from a user list (the sort of thing
that some companies do often). The book covers C programming
TCP/IP, DNS, Apache, mail, Samba - just about you name it.

    The other claims this book makes, (and I believe it), is
that it is truly Distribution Neutral (ie pick a distro and
you will still be able to use this book), and that it will
teach you not only enough to pass any Linux Certification
(RHCE, etc.), but also to have real practical knowledge to
use on a system that some certifications apparently lack.
You know, the Uni graduate can write a program, but the TAFE
graduate can actually program (or what I really want is a
Programmer, not a Software Engineer). Well this book gives
you the knowledge to be both Certified AND Practical, and do
them well.

    The hype on the Internet is this book is quite simply
the best, and after I bought a copy, I whole heartedly
agree. Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Reference books suggestions


&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt; I am a real newbie at Linux and guess what... I have to
maintain a server
&gt; that has been set up by someone else.  I can code in C++,
Java  and
&gt; understand protocols and network stuff etc but I have had
little to do with
&gt; unix or linux.
&gt; What I would like is any suggestions for book/courses.  I
always find that
&gt; when I am learning a new system, that I end up getting a
book that looks
&gt; in-depth to me in the shop, but when I get down to it, it
never goes far
&gt; enough.  A book that describes, step by step, the process
for building a
&gt; server along with some deeper knowledge for doing tricky
stuff.  I also need
&gt; it to be concise and get me up to speed very quickly - I
don't really have
&gt; time to sit down and become emersed in it (one day - after
uni, after I
&gt; finish my house etc etc)
&gt;
&gt; Basically (after all that) Can anyone recommend any good
linux server books
&gt; ;)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Pete
