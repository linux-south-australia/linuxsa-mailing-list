&gt; &gt; I'd be very supprised if this was the case, but I just had a search of
&gt; &gt; the main site and the MSDN site anyway, and couldnt find it. If you can
&gt; &gt; provide a link i'm sure many open source developers would love to see
&gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe if they made MS open up the file formats and fields
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not convinced.  I understand that Microsoft already do publish the
&gt; &gt; &gt; file formats.  Search www.microsoft.com and I think you'll find all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; information is there.
&gt;
&gt; Most M$ file formats are definately NOT published, hence why the open
&gt; sourcing of star office was so important.  If for nothing else, it gave the
&gt; community some stable and robust M$ file format loaders.
&gt;
&gt; In the past decade file formats were a key part of Microsoft locking in
&gt; companies to their products.  This has been recognised and exposed, and now
&gt; they are trying something different - using XML as a file format, but with
&gt; proprietry, undocumented DTDs.  They can now claim they are using an "open"
&gt; file format, but without the DTD it still makes it difficult for other
&gt; software products to extract the information from the data.

Well they are published, but I would wager not completely.  The format specs 
are contained in the Office Resource Kit in the file Formats.doc, it's 
described here:

<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2000/appndx/95t2_4.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/office/ork/2000/appndx/95t2_4.htm</A>

you can see a htmlised version of the Office 97 word format here:

<A HREF="http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~bob/Tech/wword8.html">http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~bob/Tech/wword8.html</A>

I would say that the specs are probably good enough to get a mostly working 
filter going.  As I understood it though the biggest problem with MS Office 
formats was the embedding of com objects into files.

Anyway, Cheers.
