&gt; a subtle hint that if you're running Exchange you should ditch it
&gt; and get a real mail server??

... in a perfect world.

&gt; Personally I think its great that theyre charging for the Exch. connector,
&gt; people using Exchange are used to paying for software anyway, its like
&gt; Sendmail for NT, u have to pay for it, but use it on Linux, and hey presto,
&gt; its free.

You miss the point. Outlook comes bundled with every edition of
Office, for no apparent charge.[1] If you put Evolution on your
clients and Exchange on your server, you've got to pay twice. Once for 
each connection license, and again for a Ximian Connector license.

&gt; Evolution is free, Linux is free, lotsa free mail servers out there
&gt; for Linux, dang! I see a pattern forming here............

I'm certain that Ximian didn't engineer an Exchange connector in an
attempt to make people use Linux on their servers.

"Hey, Boss! We can change to Evolution which is free, but we'll have
to pay for the Exchange connector. I think it's time we changed the
mail server to something that doesn't require us to purchase the
connector".

"Sure, that sounds like a great idea. I'm prepared to outlay money to
give me a Linux-based replica of my current e-mail client. I don't
mind paying for something that I've currently got for free[1]. Here's
my credit card."

Sure, that's going to happen.

with viruses and such.
