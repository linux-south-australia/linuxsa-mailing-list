Hi all,

Yesterday I purchased two brand-less network cards (they have RealTek 8139 
chips in them).  I put them in my two machines, then configured the 
Slackware 8.0 OS on each machine to be networked.  It was all very 
straightforward, and after the configuration, `route` and `ifconfig` were 
returning the right messages.  When I tried to ping machine A from machine 
B, however, it would fail.  The light's of machine A's NIC would flash, 
but B's wouldn't.

Upon further inspection, some nasty-looking IRQ errors in dmesg turned up, 
and they are included below:

PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:0b.0
IRQ routing conflict in pirq table for device 00:0b.0
es1371: found chip, vendor id 0x1274 device id 0x1371 revision 0x08

IRQ routing conflict in pirq table for device 00:0a.0

12
eth0:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139C'
eth0: Setting 100mbps full-duplex based on auto-negotiated partner ability 
41e1.

There seem to be two different IRQ conflicts, one occuring before the 
soudn card module is loaded (es1371), and the other before the network 
card module is loaded (8139too).

/proc/interrupts contains this:

           CPU0       
  0:     470100          XT-PIC  timer
  1:      20934          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:     201061          XT-PIC  serial
  4:      92696          XT-PIC  serial
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:          0          XT-PIC  es1371
 12:         60          XT-PIC  eth0
 14:       4504          XT-PIC  ide0
NMI:          0 
ERR:          0

It was suggested that I go into the BIOS and reserve the IRQ of the NIC 
for use by ISA devices, thus causing it to use another IRQ, hence avoiding 
possible conflicts, but this made no difference.

I am using the 2.4.5 kernel distributed with Slackware 8.0.  There seems 
to be no problem (well, nothing that I can see) with the hardware itself 
(new NICs and a new crossover cable) or the software configuration, so 
this IRQ problem seems to be the perpetrator.  Is this correct?  Would 
anyone have any ideas of how to get around this?

Thanks for your help,

Tim Riley
