Quoting Anthony Symons &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ant@sa.pracom.com.au">ant@sa.pracom.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I'd be very supprised if this was the case, but I just had a search of
&gt; the main site and the MSDN site anyway, and couldnt find it. If you can
&gt; provide a link i'm sure many open source developers would love to see
&gt; it.

&gt; &gt; I'm not convinced.  I understand that Microsoft already do publish the
&gt; &gt; file formats.  Search www.microsoft.com and I think you'll find all the
&gt; &gt; information is there.

Most M$ file formats are definately NOT published, hence why the open sourcing 
of star office was so important.  If for nothing else, it gave the community 
some stable and robust M$ file format loaders.

In the past decade file formats were a key part of Microsoft locking in 
companies to their products.  This has been recognised and exposed, and now they 
are trying something different - using XML as a file format, but with 
proprietry, undocumented DTDs.  They can now claim they are using an "open" file 
format, but without the DTD it still makes it difficult for other software 
products to extract the information from the data.
