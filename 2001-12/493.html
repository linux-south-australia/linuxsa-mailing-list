THE INTRODUCTION

First paragraph
  "GNU/Linux (referred to as just Linux) has historically made it's"
Should be "its". "it's" is a contraction for "it is". Besides, you'll probably
lose marks for bringing up the whole ugly GNU/Linux thing in the first place.

Second/third/fourth line:
  "For effective and low-cost web, email, AND Windows file/printer sharing
  (SMB), AND other myriad server use, Linux's has a claim for productive uses
  the world over."
should be:
  "For effective and low cost web, email, Windows file/printer sharing and
  other myriad server use Linux has a claim for productive use the world over."
However, the sentence is still flawed. Find a better term for the second
"use". Maybe "installations" or something.

Second paragraph:
  "While the operating system has its uses for server applications, its real
  challenge is to"
should be " THE real challenge is to"

Eh, sod it. I'm only going to nitpick on technical or confusion-related
problems from here on in. I'll let you work out the grammer problems. An
old trick my English teacher taught me was to read a work out loud to find
errors: it makes sure that the brain is reading at a reasonable pace
instead of skimming and finds run on sentences or phrases that don't make
sense. Watch those apostrophes.

Second line:
  "With the literal billons that Microsoft and Apple"
literal billions of what?

Third paragraph:
Haven't I seen this somewhere before?

Fifth paragraph:
"Gaming performance (game, game) versus Windows XP"
should probably be "Gaming performance of Mandrake (r8.1), Redhat (r7.2) and
Windows XP (using game, game)"

THE DISTRIBUTIONS
No obvious problems. I'm a Debian/FreeBSD monkey, what do I know? :)

REDHAT'S INSTALLATION
'luddite' means somebody who doesn't like technology, not somebody who doesn't
know how to _use_ technology. Of course, the two tend to go hand in hand,
but wouldn't "new user" be a better term?

  "and will enhance any RedHat machine to quickly recover from abnormal"
should be
  "and will ALLOW any Redhat machine to quickly recover from abnormal"

"journal filesystem" should be "journaling filesystem". Journaling is
something a filesystem does rather than something a filesystem is, AFAIK.

"For this article, ext3 was used for the duration of this article"
Huh? Try "The ext3 type filesystem was used for tests in this article"

"Not a huge choice, KDE was the manager of choice for this article"
Huh? Try "Not many options were available, so the KDE window manager was
chosen."

"firewalling settings" should be "firewall settings".

Eh, that's enough nitpicking for one night. If you want me to and if I can
find the time I'll go through the rest.
