Hi,

I am having a battle with my Linux box at the moment. It is a stand alone 
personal use PC running only Linux, only becomes networked to any extent when 
connected PPP to internet.

I have always called this box sneezy. This has never been a problem before, 
through many versions of many distros, but now it has apparently decided this 
is not a good idea. On boot, init.d is run (of course) including now a 
section to setup loopback device config for CUPS. One of the checks is the 
contents of the /etc/hosts file for boxes not connected to a real network, 
and to 'correct' /etc/hosts to always and only contain something like 
127.0.0.1 \t\tlocalhost.localdomain \tlocalhost
i.e. the generic localhost definition.

Is there a reason this must be so? It seems a bit fascist to me that all 
standalone PCs must be generically named from now on!! Sneezy and I have had 
some great times together.

This has only been a problem since 'upgrading' from Manduck 8.0 to 8.1, and 
for the life of me I can't see why it should be so. I intend to comment out 
the offensive lines in init.d. Is anyone on list aware of tragic or fatal 
consequences? I can't see why the loopback device would necessarily not 
function if hostname is set, regardless of the connected state of the box, 
but maybe I am missing something. Feel free to wield the clue stick if I am 
making dumb assumptions here. I will reboot and check that cupsd comes up as 
expected. I will be surprised if there is a problem.

Bruce (and sneezy)
