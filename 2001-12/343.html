The way that I understand it is this.

Both OpenOffice and Mozilla are technically meant to be developer 
projects/platforms and are intended for people either developing the main 
projects themselves or modified/personalized versions or to develop add ons 
for the platform as a whole.

Netscape 6.x & StarOffice 6 are branded distributions of the afore mentioned 
developer projects, i.e. a consumer implamentation of the platform.

I think that StarOffice 6 Beta is OpenOffice 638 (maybe c) with the spell 
checking and basic level help added (which have now been rolled into 641), 
and Netscape 6.2 is Mozilla 9.4.1.

The Developer platforms/projects are not really intended for deployment in 
businesses and enterprises, but are there for developers and hobbyist, it 
will be where all the new, unfinished, cutting edge stuff will go..  Where as 
Netscape and StarOffice will (supposedly) go through a more thourough Q&A 
process and will be supported by a commercial entity, much more appropriate 
and reassuring for a business.  The branded versions will roll the new stuff 
in once it's proven and stable.

Anyway, that's the way I see the relationship between these projects 
(onafforee thing I am interested in is the connection between OpenOffice and 
NetBeans, apparently there will be some sort of intergration there :)

Cheers.
Damien.

&gt; I'm trying to draw come analogies to Mozilla and Netscape.
&gt;
&gt; How similar is this build to StarOffice beta 6 ?
&gt;
&gt; Even after StarOffice 6 is released, will the updated builds from
&gt; OpenOffice be better? After all Netscape 6.xx is just bloat compared to
&gt; plain vanilla Mozilla.

&gt; Hi Anthony,
&gt;
&gt; I have not seen the newest version yet, still waiting for my downloader
&gt; to get to it &lt;G&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to hear that it is still slow, I thought that might get fixed in
&gt; this version.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, Ian
