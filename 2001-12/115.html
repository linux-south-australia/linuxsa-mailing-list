&gt; cheapest solution, and possibly the best solution too, might be to Beowulf
&gt; half a dozen cheap pizzabox-style units.. eg. one or two CPUs per box.
&gt; u can probably get a bunch at under $2k each, so $10k should get you
five..

Unfortunately, "Beowulf" isn't as simple as just connecting a bunch of
machines together. It usually involves some sort of code re-writing:

(from the Beowulf FAQ -- <A HREF="http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/beowulf-faq.txt">http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/beowulf-faq.txt</A>)

3. Can I take my software and run it on a Beowulf and have it go faster?
[1999-05-13]

Maybe, if you put some work into it.  You need to split it into
parallel tasks that communicate using MPI or PVM or network sockets or
SysV IPC.  Then you need to recompile it.
...
----

The software that I want to run here is not written as a parallel job, nor
is it easily parallelisable (it may be, but I'm not about to trawl through
hundreds of thousands of lines of up-to-20-year-old heavily mathematical
code to find out)... each "run" tends to go for an hour or more, and appears
as a single process on a process listing. It's not even threaded. The
advantage I wish to get is to be able to have a number of people using this
machine interactively, and then when one or more of them compile or compute,
not have the rest of them suffer while the box is hosed for an hour. Using a
MOSIX-like cluster was one idea that I thought may give me that, with some
extra reliability thrown in, without the cost of a 4-way SMP machine.

&gt; If you go for the real budget PCs, $10k would get you about 20 headless
&gt; machines!
&gt;
&gt; Even if each processor is only quarter the speed of a quad-way 2GHz p4,
&gt; you've still got many more times the grunt overall

... for particular problem types (or at least, for problems expressed in
their most parallel fashion)... sometimes, a process is limited by the speed
of a single CPU...
