&gt; 1. Default Deny ALL, and only allow what you need.

Hadn't got around to setting up the firewall-proper yet so it was very
rudimentary.

&gt; 2. Don't run what you don't use/need, only run what you need on a server.

I didn't install portmapper but it was still running.  Go figure.  I did
learn another valuable lesson too - don't rely on your damn distro to do
what you tell it at install time.  Check the installed services after
you install to make sure there's nothing that you don't want/need.

I guess the world is going the M$ way... Install everything even if the
user doesn't want it, because they may want it later on.  RedHat seems
to install so much garbage even if you turn it off in the install.

Tried to install Mandrake 8.1 (the latest, anyway, not 100% sure of the
number).  It gets up and it's all good until it wants to actually
install files then complains that the packages database is missing and
tells you a filename.  I went to a console and had a look where it said
and the file was there.  Has anyone had this with Mandrake before and
how do you fix it?  I've been told the install CD (borrowed) is good and
has been used to install the system before.

Cheers,
Adam
