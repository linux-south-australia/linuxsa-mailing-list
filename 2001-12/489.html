Hi all.  

Some of you may remember my previous post about mouse probs under RH7.1
with a M$ (not-so)Intellimouse.

What happens basically is I can't move it all the way left on the screen
after a while of using it.  IF it just keep using it, it eventually
comes good for a bit until it dies again.

Anyway, I changed over to Mandrake 8.1 (not bad to install once you get
past the stupid way it expects you to partition) and I get the exact
same behaviour.

Anywho, after a lot of reading in the X documentation I found something
about X and GPM not being overly compatible.  I followed the
instructions (actually I just turned of GPM 'cos I can't switch to a
console without buggering X, but that's whole nother story) and worked
around it.  Problem is, it still does the same thing, even after a
reboot (GPM isn't running anymore).

I'm at an end now because the only thing I can think of doing is
upgrading X, and I'd prefer not to do that unless I really have to
because it's not trivial (at least it wasn't when I tried last).

Anywho, has anyone seen this and solved it, because I cannot solve it
and it's really annoying.

Cheers,
Adam
