Michael,

Oh, I don't mind nitpicking. Every one picked is one less from another
person :)

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; &gt; Mention any mistakes, and suggestions. I might code up a better page
&gt; &gt; navigation list.

&gt; 
&gt; THE INTRODUCTION
&gt; 
&gt; First paragraph
&gt;   "GNU/Linux (referred to as just Linux) has historically made it's"
&gt; Should be "its". "it's" is a contraction for "it is". Besides, you'll probably
&gt; lose marks for bringing up the whole ugly GNU/Linux thing in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; Second/third/fourth line:
&gt;   "For effective and low-cost web, email, AND Windows file/printer sharing
&gt;   (SMB), AND other myriad server use, Linux's has a claim for productive uses
&gt;   the world over."
&gt; should be:
&gt;   "For effective and low cost web, email, Windows file/printer sharing and
&gt;   other myriad server use Linux has a claim for productive use the world over."
&gt; However, the sentence is still flawed. Find a better term for the second
&gt; "use". Maybe "installations" or something.
&gt; 
&gt; Second paragraph:
&gt;   "While the operating system has its uses for server applications, its real
&gt;   challenge is to"
&gt; should be " THE real challenge is to"
&gt; 
&gt; Eh, sod it. I'm only going to nitpick on technical or confusion-related
&gt; problems from here on in. I'll let you work out the grammer problems. An
&gt; old trick my English teacher taught me was to read a work out loud to find
&gt; errors: it makes sure that the brain is reading at a reasonable pace
&gt; instead of skimming and finds run on sentences or phrases that don't make
&gt; sense. Watch those apostrophes.
&gt; 
&gt; Second line:
&gt;   "With the literal billons that Microsoft and Apple"
&gt; literal billions of what?
&gt; 
&gt; Third paragraph:
&gt; Haven't I seen this somewhere before?
&gt; 
&gt; Fifth paragraph:
&gt; "Gaming performance (game, game) versus Windows XP"
&gt; should probably be "Gaming performance of Mandrake (r8.1), Redhat (r7.2) and
&gt; Windows XP (using game, game)"
&gt; 
&gt; THE DISTRIBUTIONS
&gt; No obvious problems. I'm a Debian/FreeBSD monkey, what do I know? :)
&gt; 
&gt; REDHAT'S INSTALLATION
&gt; 'luddite' means somebody who doesn't like technology, not somebody who doesn't
&gt; know how to _use_ technology. Of course, the two tend to go hand in hand,
&gt; but wouldn't "new user" be a better term?
&gt; 
&gt;   "and will enhance any RedHat machine to quickly recover from abnormal"
&gt; should be
&gt;   "and will ALLOW any Redhat machine to quickly recover from abnormal"
&gt; 
&gt; "journal filesystem" should be "journaling filesystem". Journaling is
&gt; something a filesystem does rather than something a filesystem is, AFAIK.
&gt; 
&gt; "For this article, ext3 was used for the duration of this article"
&gt; Huh? Try "The ext3 type filesystem was used for tests in this article"
&gt; 
&gt; "Not a huge choice, KDE was the manager of choice for this article"
&gt; Huh? Try "Not many options were available, so the KDE window manager was
&gt; chosen."
&gt; 
&gt; "firewalling settings" should be "firewall settings".
&gt; 
&gt; Eh, that's enough nitpicking for one night. If you want me to and if I can
&gt; find the time I'll go through the rest.
