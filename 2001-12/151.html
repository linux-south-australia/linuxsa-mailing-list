&gt; 
&gt; Hi
&gt; Ive been looking for this book you recommended (Rute users 
&gt; .... by Paul
&gt; Sheer) on Dymocks and  Angus and Robertsons Site and the 
&gt; closest I can get
&gt; is the following title
&gt; 
&gt;  Linux Certification Handbook:  Preparing for the RHCE and 
&gt; LPI Exams  -
&gt; $77.95
&gt; This is the only book either search engine comes up with for 
&gt; this Author and
&gt; ISBN number.
&gt; Searching for Rute gave no results.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this the same book you were recommending?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; David Delyn
&gt; 
&gt; Couldn't get through to The Bookshelf or the UNI shop will 
&gt; try again later.

&gt; &gt; Hi There,
&gt; &gt;     I would suggest 2 books that are probably required
&gt; &gt; purchasing or obtaining about Linux. The first is "A
&gt; &gt; Practical Guide to Linux" by Mark G. Sobell ISBN
&gt; &gt; 0-201-89549-8 (Addison Wesley). It is a very good book with
&gt; &gt; heaps of examples and suggestions to admin a Linux system.
&gt; &gt; It covers everything from how to write scripts to
&gt; &gt; downloading and compiling software off the net. Excellent
&gt; &gt; starter and Netcraft sell heaps of them in Adelaide.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     The second book I now believe to be REQUIRED reading by
&gt; &gt; new Linux Admins (I didn't believe all the hype on the net
&gt; &gt; about this book, but believe me it is true) The book is
&gt; &gt; "Linux - Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition" by Paul Scheer
&gt; &gt; ISBN0-13-033351-4 (Prentice Hall). This book expands on the
&gt; &gt; first book well beyond, and gives excellent PRACTICAL
&gt; &gt; knowledge, and also knowledge not covered by the first book
&gt; &gt; (like how libraries actually work - you learn by creating
&gt; &gt; Static and Dynamic Linked Libraries and then using them). It
&gt; &gt; also teaches things like how to set up scripts to create
&gt; &gt; multiple users files from a user list (the sort of thing
&gt; &gt; that some companies do often). The book covers C programming
&gt; &gt; TCP/IP, DNS, Apache, mail, Samba - just about you name it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     The other claims this book makes, (and I believe it), is
&gt; &gt; that it is truly Distribution Neutral (ie pick a distro and
&gt; &gt; you will still be able to use this book), and that it will
&gt; &gt; teach you not only enough to pass any Linux Certification
&gt; &gt; (RHCE, etc.), but also to have real practical knowledge to
&gt; &gt; use on a system that some certifications apparently lack.
&gt; &gt; You know, the Uni graduate can write a program, but the TAFE
&gt; &gt; graduate can actually program (or what I really want is a
&gt; &gt; Programmer, not a Software Engineer). Well this book gives
&gt; &gt; you the knowledge to be both Certified AND Practical, and do
&gt; &gt; them well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     The hype on the Internet is this book is quite simply
&gt; &gt; the best, and after I bought a copy, I whole heartedly
&gt; &gt; agree. Hope this has helped.
&gt; &gt;     Cheers!
&gt; &gt;         Andrew.
&gt; &gt;
