&gt;&gt; Actually, it's pretty easy, unless you're running Exchange.
&gt;&gt; X-Mailing-List: would probably be a reasonable way of detecting
&gt;&gt; email from LinuxSA.
&gt; true, but is that a "standard" or common accross mailing list
&gt; software and platforms?
&gt;It's "a" standard, and other mailing lists use similar techniques
&gt;("Precedence: bulk" or "Precedence: list" comes to mind, of which
&gt;LinuxSA appears to use the latter).  However, as SMTP and RFC822
&gt;are open standards, guess how much chance you have of Exchange
&gt;natively supporting such a feature?  It's a snap with tools like
&gt;procmail.

Detecting email from x or y has more to do with filtering or with routing at the server level.

Assuming that individual's schedule and needs varies from person to person, the autoreply thing shouldn't happend at the site(server) level, but at user's mail client.

In fact, things are quite simple with Exchange...for those who bother...
at the Exchange server, just disable out of office and automatic replies to the internet(to prevent flooding the world with rubish), and do the following registry tweak to allow those "important users" to benefit from the large range of settings for auto-forwarded messages available through outlook rules wizard:

Locate the following key in the registry: 
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters 

On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value: 
      Value Name: AlwaysAllowForwarding
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      Value:   1 

That's because the Internet Mail Service cannot detect the difference between a message that is an auto reply and a message that is an auto forward. (the difference is that the auto forwarded message has the MAPI property PR_AUTO_FORWARDED set)
