Well, you've already got a filter running to seperate your mailing lists out
into a seperate folder.. right?
So, there's your rule!

I believe procmail has some example recipes of how to do autoreply to
personal email only, too.

&gt; Richard is out of his office right now, but does agree with you. However, it's generally pretty hard for
&gt; autoreply software to tell if a message is from a mailing list or not... unless there's some standard way of
&gt; doing it -- probably however MS Exchange hosted mailing lists (if there is such a thing) are distinguished
&gt; would be an effective way of going about it... :)

&gt; &gt; Is it just me, or are people's autoreply messages getting annoying to

&gt; &gt; Every time I post, I can be guaranteed an autoreply from someone who is
&gt; &gt; away, or stepped out of the office for five minutes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally, I don't give two rat's sh**s whether or not people are in
&gt; &gt; their office and they're subscribed to the same list as me, and to get a
&gt; &gt; message or 2 or 3 or 4... every time I post a reply to someone's query
&gt; &gt; on the list is very annoying.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone else share the same opinion?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
