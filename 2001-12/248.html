Gwyn,

vi is a very lightweight editor, but the programs memory or cpu usage is not
related to the disk access in this case.

I suspect the cause of the matter is vi's .swp file.
The file exists to provide a form of crash protection. If you're ever
editing a file, and crash out somehow (ie. X crashes, the machine crashes,
power goes out, etc) then you can usually recover all or most of your edits
thanks to this.

However, because its being written to disk, that's keeping your disk
spinning up.
Try running vi with the -n option, from the vim man page:
       -n          No swap file will be used.  Recovery  after  a
                   crash  will  be impossible.  Handy if you want
                   to edit a file on a  very  slow  medium  (e.g.
                   floppy).   Can  also be done with ":set uc=0".
                   Can be undone with ":set uc=200".

See ya, and congrats on choosing vim, the best editor around! :)

&gt; Hi -

&gt; &gt; It's definitely vi that's causing the problem? (ie, it doesn't occur
&gt; &gt; when you're not running vi?)
&gt; It's not necessarily vi, although I'll try sitting at a bash prompt and waiting and see if the disk still spins. Vi is just the most lightweight editor I could think of at the time.
