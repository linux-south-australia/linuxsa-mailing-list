Their security patches have a similar disclaimer, given that its
such a risk to install them in the first place :-\.

I thought their tact about "certified drivers" was particularly odd,
especially given that whenever there is a problem with those drivers,
they will immediately point the finger at the vendor and say "They
wrote the drivers; not our fault" (so what does the certification
process give?  Probably just more money flowing to Microsoft's
direction).  The particular instance that sticks in my mind was when
it was found that a lot of third party NT device drivers (eg, SCSI)
that you could read the raw disk by opening the NT-equivalent /dev
entries, which had no ACL protection on those objects at all
(basically read/write everone).  When Microsoft said "Third party
vendor problem, not ours", the vendors (rightly, I thought), said
"Where in the DDK is this documented?".

&gt; grrr...

grrr indeed.
