Geeze, man. That's clever :-)

&gt; go scsi, it's only slightly more and is much better.
&gt; I bought a plextor scsi (PX-412) one a couple of years ago, got 
&gt; because I wanted a Sun-bootable scsi cd drive as well as a burner 
&gt; and I can only recall ever creating one coaster with it.
&gt; They're not cheap though, value for money, get a ricoh, sony,
&gt; panasonic etc "bare drive" (scsi of course).
&gt; Check the howto (cd-writing I think) for supported models just to
&gt; be on the safe side.

I've got an LG IDE burner in my development machine. I usually burn
under FreeBSD, and I've never created a coaster. The thing also works
well under Linux, I'm told, but you'll have to use the ide-scsi module 
for cdrecord (and subsequent applications like XCDRoast)to work
properly.

There price is really quite trivial ($162.80 GST Inc. is what Leader
have them for ATM). For a couple of hundred bucks, you get a fairly
decent burner.

The only thing that pisses me off about IDE CD-R drives is that the
machine seems to slow considerably during the cut. It doesn't appear
to matter what sort of machine you do it on either. Keetoo (my
development box with the LG) is a Duron 850, and the machine feels no
different to a Pentium Pro 200 cutting with the same burner.

I don't think I've noticed that so much with SCSI equipment.

However, it's not that much of a hassle normally.
