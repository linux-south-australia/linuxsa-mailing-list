Hi David,

&gt; I would hope that they could recoup the cost from sales in that 
&gt; market,but there is no guarantee of that.  Without wishing to seem 
&gt; inflammatory,Linux users often show a mean disinclination to pay 
&gt; for software,

I think it is a suggestion that doesn't have much chance of becoming 
fact. To set everything up in Linux would be a big job and I just don't 
see the market for it. 

Maybe if they made MS open up the file formats and fields so that Linux 
developers like StarOffice and Applixware could hook into the files 
with a pretty good chance of matching. That would not cost MS much 
other than pride and it would make the Linux office suites competitive 
to MS Office on Windows OS. 

In the long run that may end up hurting MS just as much as forcing them 
to write for Linux.

Cheers, Ian
