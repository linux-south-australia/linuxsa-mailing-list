&gt;You miss the point. Outlook comes bundled with every edition of
&gt;Office, for no apparent charge.[1] If you put Evolution on your
&gt;clients and Exchange on your server, you've got to pay twice. Once for 
&gt;each connection license, and again for a Ximian Connector license.

the illusion being no "apparent" charge, in reality, and this is referring
to
our environment, the whole Office package is purchased just for Word
& Outlook.  Of course this brings up the whole MS Office & Linux debate.
With the progress of Staroffice & software such as the Ximian connector,
Linux as a plugin desktop option for a lot of corporate users may not be
too far away. (in a perfect world ;o)

(i did miss the point slightly tho, i forgot about the CALs, DOH!, friggin
MS)


&gt;&gt; Evolution is free, Linux is free, lotsa free mail servers out there
&gt;&gt; for Linux, dang! I see a pattern forming here............
&gt;
&gt;I'm certain that Ximian didn't engineer an Exchange connector in an
&gt;attempt to make people use Linux on their servers.

true, and theyre likely to make a bit of money out of it too, good luck to
them,
hopefully ppl will buy their entire desktop package as well (tho I'm a KDE
person myself)


&gt;"Hey, Boss! We can change to Evolution which is free, but we'll have
&gt;to pay for the Exchange connector. I think it's time we changed the
&gt;mail server to something that doesn't require us to purchase the
&gt;connector".

reverse psychology, you wouldn't believe how many managers would fall for it
too ;o)
