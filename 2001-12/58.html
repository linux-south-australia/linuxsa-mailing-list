&gt; Quoting Michael Wardle &lt;<A HREF="mailto:michael.wardle@adacel.com">michael.wardle@adacel.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; In general, it is best to have the swap partition as the last
partition.
&gt; &gt; Doing so means that the data lies on the outermost part of the disk
&gt; &gt; where the transfer rates are greatest.  Remember that swap is
usually
&gt; &gt; trying to emulate physical memory which has a 1000 times greater
&gt; &gt; transfer rate, so every little bit of performance is worth trying
for.
&gt;
&gt; I think we've discussed this before on list - where your data ends up
may not be
&gt; where you think it is - so just because you use the last
cylinders/sectors as
&gt; reported by fdisk does not mean you are using the outside edge of the
disk.
&gt; Virtual addressing means it could go anywhere, but I accept that if
you are
&gt; trying to optimise this you might as well put it at the end and see
what
&gt; happens.

As Richard also mentioned, there are other considerations, such as
proximity to the other partitions that will be accessed on the same
disk.

Partitioning is even less fun when using something like DiskDruid, where
*it* decides the layout.

&gt; &gt; If you're swapping due to programs (not buffer/cache) using all RAM
you are
&gt; indeed stuffed performance wise and you need to shell out for more RAM
as you
&gt; mention.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Alternatively, buy lots of RAM so that you never have to swap.  :-P
&gt;
&gt; I have 1/2 a gig and use all of it most of the time due to buffers and
cache, of
&gt; course the amount that gets buffered reduces as my real need
increases.  It
&gt; appears you will always swap, no matter how much RAM you have, at
least under
&gt; early 2.4 kernels.  This isn't a bad thing like I mention if it's all
in
&gt; buffer/cache, afterall, if you have the RAM why not use it? :)

This comment was made in jest, but certainly the amount of swaping is
reduced by having more physical memory.

&gt; &gt; Do you ever get the feeling you should've just bought two hard
disks?
&gt; &gt; (I do.)
&gt;
&gt; That's another solution, but only if on seperate controllers, and
preferably if
&gt; they're ultra wide SCSI or something else that screams.

Having two disks can provide significant performance increases, but my
point was that it also makes partitioning easier.  :-)

I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone write SCSI as $C$I.  It's sure out
of my reach as a home user.

Regards.
