Hello,

I have to ask, are you trying to create the 'con' directory in Linux as 
in '/con' or '/root/con' or are you trying to create in under windows.

If you are trying to create it under windows, in DOS con refers to the 
console. Copying a file to con prints it to the screen, etc. Therefore 
one can't actually make a file called con. There are a couple of other 
words that work in a similar way under DOS though I can't remeber their 
names just now.

If you are trying to do this under Linux, then I have no idea.

Sorry, I got a tad confused by your email. :-)

Hope it helps.

&gt;
&gt; here is the catch... is Win#ow$98 a dirty word here? because i was
&gt; trying to create a directory called 'con' in root and it will not let
&gt; me. nor can i see it with attrib, type, cd, edit, del, dir .
&gt;
&gt; A secret microsoft file ? If they don't want us to see it, I want to
&gt; see it.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know the key to this mystery ?
&gt;
&gt; I still prefer linux !!
