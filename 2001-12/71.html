&gt; I have 1/2 a gig and use all of it most of the time due to buffers and cache, of
&gt; course the amount that gets buffered reduces as my real need increases.  It
&gt; appears you will always swap, no matter how much RAM you have, at least under
&gt; early 2.4 kernels.  This isn't a bad thing like I mention if it's all in
&gt; buffer/cache, afterall, if you have the RAM why not use it? :)

I have 384M and it's always 100% used after buffers and cache.  I
haven't seen my 2.4 kernel (whatever was with RH7.1) swap to disk under
"normal" use yet.  I have a few services running, slowzilla, emacs, a
build of my research software, vmware (with 64M for the virtual
machine), licq, some terminals, etc.  The swap usage is NEARLY always
zero or not too far from it (more than 512k).

The buffers and cache are all for the disk, are they not? I didn't think
the swap file was buffered - that would be kind of pointless.

Swapping is good though, as it swaps out things that are not running or
running least frequently.  You'll find (if you check) that things like
daemons are swapped out a long time before user processes because most
of the time they just sit there and wait for input.

Of course it's possible to make it swap but I have to run something that
allocates a butt-load of RAM (my research software), or run a lot more
software than most people would normally have open.

Cheers,
Adam
