&gt; The only thing that pisses me off about IDE CD-R drives is that the
&gt; machine seems to slow considerably during the cut. It doesn't appear
&gt; to matter what sort of machine you do it on either. Keetoo (my
&gt; development box with the LG) is a Duron 850, and the machine feels no
&gt; different to a Pentium Pro 200 cutting with the same burner.

I've been using an IDE Acer 32x8x4 burner for 18 months and it works
just fine in my Mdk8.1 system (Duron 700 + 512Mb RAM). I never notice
any performance problems, so maybe you have a problem?? This morning
I started a burn, *then* I fired up the X server + KDE. Didn't affect
the burn at all, and no coaster was produced ;-)

SCSI would be great if you can afford it, but IDE burners work just
fine. Caveat: put the burner on your second IDE port as the master
though, so that your IDE hard disk isn't competing for resources 
with the CD. I think that's the trick to eliminating performance 
problems.

I AM having problems with CD-RW media at the moment. For some reason,
cdrecord can't blank them - it always fails. Has only been happening
since I upgraded from Mdk8.0 to Mdk8.1, so I guess something got 
broke :-(

Dean
