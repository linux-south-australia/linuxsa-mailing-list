cheapest solution, and possibly the best solution too, might be to Beowulf
half a dozen cheap pizzabox-style units.. eg. one or two CPUs per box.
u can probably get a bunch at under $2k each, so $10k should get you five..

If you go for the real budget PCs, $10k would get you about 20 headless
machines!

Even if each processor is only quarter the speed of a quad-way 2GHz p4,
you've still got many more times the grunt overall

&gt; Hi...
&gt;
&gt; I have a requirement for some particularly intensive number-crunching
&gt; work...
&gt;
&gt; There are multiple people, wishing to do three main types of work:
&gt; interactive (anything will do), compiling (I/O main bottleneck, I think, but
&gt; this isn't really the issue), and number-crunching (very RAM hungry, large
&gt; processes that go for hours -- can't be shared between cpus). What I would
&gt; like to do is have something like a quad-processor (or more) ~2GHz P4 or (if
&gt; possible, which I don't think it is yet) Athlon system, with pantloads (2GB)
&gt; of RAM, and not a whole lot of disk. It doesn't need to be server-class (no
&gt; SCSI needed etc), but it needs to be reasonably reliable (effectively, it
&gt; would be a headless workstation)... and it needs to be cheap. $10K would be
&gt; a stretch. Looking at dell and ibm, I found the prices to be rather high --
&gt; quad cpu units appeared to be around $11K, but that was with only 1 cpu, and
&gt; each extra cpu seemed to double the price... Is there an affordable way to
&gt; get 4 way SMP, or am I chasing a lost dog? (so to speak)
&gt;
&gt; Unfortuantely, I have another restriction -- it needs to run under Solaris
&gt; x86... (hence the [OT])
