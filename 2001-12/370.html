Why would Telstra even bother to do this?

There's some argument for efficiencies of volume, but they're Telstra,
they don't have to be efficient with Interstate links.

If they do route directly in Adelaide, the only benefit to ADSL users is
reduced latency and increased reachability to Adelaide sites connected
to Telstra, and other Adelaide ADSL users. That sounds good, but it
probably only makes up less than 1% of traffic, to benefit a userbase
that might be lucky to make up 10% of their total ADSL customer list.

Curiously, if they connected their ADSL network to SAIX, they could
expect to see at least 5% of traffic go that way based on present-day
usage. They'd probably be able to raise that value if they actually did
it. Too bad they've never shown any interest in peering in this country,
even between their own networks as you've noticed.
