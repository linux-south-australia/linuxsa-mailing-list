&gt; At Trinity College, anything internetty (new word there) is Unix based

&gt; are using an E450 as the SUNRAY server.  We also have an Ultra 80 as an 
&gt; application server running Netscape, IE, Star Office and The Gimp.  This 
&gt; week, while most people are away, we will also trial running applications 
&gt; off Linux servers and displaying them on the SUNRAYs.   Very very sexy stuff.

Indeed. We had a similar problem. We were offered 100 SunRays and an
E450 (x4 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 36GB Hard Disk) for ~100K. That's quite a decent
price.

The problem with implementing it was that the staff were not prepared to
take 'the risk'. Definately there is a risk involved, but they weren't
prepared to take it.

I could and still can see the benefits in running UNIX, with the
SunRay's being particularly attractive. Try telling that to the
management people though...
