&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nope, but I could give a talk on Vinum :-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; And maybe tell us all that you're porting Vinum to Linux ;-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, no, I was going to ask somebody else to do it :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; On a more serious note, how do the two Volume Managers compare? Is
&gt;&gt;&gt; one better than the other? What are the advantages/disadvantages of
&gt;&gt;&gt; each?  What is the maturatity and stability levels of each like?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm the wrong person to ask, of course.  Firstly, as the author of
&gt;&gt; Vinum I'm biased, and secondly I just plain don't know the Linux
&gt;&gt; offerings.  Linux people I respect, however, are not very happy with
&gt;&gt; the Linux LVM.  Here's what they say:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1.  LVM is only part of the solution.  You also need the MD code, and
&gt;&gt;     they don't work together too well.
&gt;&gt; 2.  The code is badly written.
&gt;&gt; 3.  The performance is not good.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Certainly (1) and (3) don't apply to Vinum.  You judge (2).  Vinum
&gt;&gt; includes both the functionality of LVM and the functionality of MD.
&gt;&gt; For Vinum results, look at
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.shub-internet.org/brad/FreeBSD/vinum.html">http://www.shub-internet.org/brad/FreeBSD/vinum.html</A> .  You'll note a
&gt;&gt; comment there about RAID-5 reliability.  Since that was written, we
&gt;&gt; have found a couple of race conditions which probably caused the
&gt;&gt; problems to which the author refers.
&gt;
&gt; ... you negleted to mention, LVM is damn impossible to get working ;-(

No I didn't.  I said I don't know it.

Apart from that, LVM is complicated material.  Lots of people have
trouble getting Vinum to work as well, mainly because they don't RTFM.
