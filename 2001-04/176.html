&gt; I've had trouble locating the source tarballs of the Ximian-modified GNOME
&gt; packages.  The download page on their website points to
&gt; ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian.  There is a 'sources' directory there, but it
&gt; only contains tarballs of the helix-install program.  All the other
&gt; directories lead to binary packages for various distributions.

Yes, they are rather obscure. They do very much exist though, and in the
place that Ximian say there in, sort of.

They're on the FTP Server, just burried deep in a the Debian directory.
They come in the form of the original tar file (ie
gnome-core.orig.tar.gz or similar) and then the patch(es) that Ximian
apply to them to make them look nice.

You can get the from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian/distributions/Debian/dists/woody/main/source/">ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian/distributions/Debian/dists/woody/main/source/</A>

&gt; So, as far as I can see, generic source tarballs of the core GNOME
&gt; packages (a la Ximian) are non-existant.  Sure, there are SRPMS available,
&gt; but the format is rather awkward to work with if one is not on an
&gt; RPM-based system.  Note that I am not whinging at Ximian, I am quite sure
&gt; they are doing a splendid job in producing a polished product for the
&gt; number of systems they already do support.

Note that the SRPMS have the original tar file and the patch(es)
included in the one file, so downloading and locating them may be
easier. You could use something like rpm2tar to create tar files from
the RPMS which you can then extract and compile. You'll still need RPM-3
installed to do this, which may defeat the purpose of the exercise.

&gt; But I'm sure source tarballs would be much appreciated by many.

By so many they have, in fact released said tarballs. Just got to know
where to look :-)

Remember that you can always email Ximian, there quite a decent bunch of
people. They're generally snappy with there responses also.
