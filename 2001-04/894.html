The business school at my university (University of Vermont, USA) is
extremely Microsoft-centric.  They push campus-wide licensing for all MS
products, and every BSAD (business administration) class seems to involve
a Microsoft product.  If a student is to write a simple paper, it seems
that it ends up being a powerpoint presentation.  So the end result is a
class of 140 students sending in 8 meg ppt files, which promptly crashes
the excnage server.  If I was a paying customer (techinically I guess I
am) I would demand a refund.  The mail er exchange server is down at least
twice a month, with downtime ranging from a day to almost a week.  Not to
impressive.  Lately, they have been unable to restore the backups either.
heh.

I took a MIS class - our web pages needed to be done using frontpage.
Every web page had the same horrible design using the built in templates.
I wrote up a quick page using SSI (still haven't gotten around to learning
PHP) and got an A.

My database course (or as my instructor refers to it, Data Base) is
heavily reliant on MS Access and SQL Server 7.0.  Although we covered
system design, normalization, etc, we spent a large portion of the time
dealing with access.  Given the school's philosophy of preparing people
for the real world, Access seems to be a poor choice.

One interesting thing is MS' licensing program.  They offer licensing
deals for students, but what that gets you is an install, and no cd's.
This would normally be semi-acceptable, but with MS Office for example,
you need to install EVERYTHING or else its basically useless.  And guess
what they don't install :/

ahh had to vent
