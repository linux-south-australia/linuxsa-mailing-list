&gt; I am trying to setup freesco on a 486 with limited resources (8mb ram 120

Depending on your serial card you may have trouble using any modem faster than
9600bps (quick warning).  486 machines (pre DX2-x) generally have either a 16450
or 8250 UART chip on board, this severely limits what you can do as far as modem
speed.

The easiest way to test this is to type 'dmesg | more' in a shell and see what
shows up.  Under Linux (mandrake 7.2) this is the sort of thing you are looking
for:
  ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
  ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
I'm not sure what FreeSCO uses as it's basis, but it should be similar to this.

&gt; I have it connected to my other machine atm
&gt; I configured freesco to boot from floppy it dialled out etc but I casn't
&gt; tell if my network card is working.

this is where having a shell is convenient, log in as whichever user is most
useful (not necessarily root) and type 'ifconfig'
this should show which network interfaces are currently configured and running.

&gt; I tried a simple test setup of
&gt; 486 (192.168.0.1)---- crossover UTP ------ p2 (102.168.0.2)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there more than one way to skin a cat, err,
configure a crossover cable?  could be you have a strange one, but I'm guessing
that you've used it before so I'm probably making an idiot of myself saying
this.

&gt; I have no DHCP services as I have setup the ip's manually.
&gt; The problem is I cant ping to one from the other in either direction so I
&gt; suspect it's the NIC I confirmed the IRQ and base address using a DOS based
&gt; program for the card and set it up accordingly on freesco.

Depending on which ne2000 compatible card it is (isa or pci) you may need to
tinker a little with the settings.
You should also be able to use the same 'dmesg | more' trick to see what's
happening with the network card in case you missed it on bootup.

&gt; I believe the cnet card is an ne2000 compatible card.

can't say I'm familiar with cnet cards, is this a no-name type card with a
common chipset, or something else?


Cheers

Tim
