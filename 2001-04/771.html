Ian!

&gt; So what are we going to do about it?

Discussing it here is a start.

&gt; What is AUUG doing about marketing?  What is LinuxSA
&gt; considering?

AUUG is the Unix User's Group. Note that it is a "User's" group, not
necessarily a lobbying body. Similarly, LinuxSA is a Linux User's Group.
Within AUUG and LinuxSA there are people willing to help lobby and
market Unix type solutions to people only exposed to Microsoft based
solutions.

&gt; &gt;Although when you show them linux, they may sway their opinion. All
&gt; &gt;microsoft is doing is showing them their product - show the public our
&gt; &gt;product.

It's for sale in virtually every Newsagent I have visited. There's the
APC PocketBook, the PC Mag Pocketbook and I just noticed a "Next" Guide
Book. I think Richard Russell (hit me if I'm wrong) posted something
about a LUG-Fest...why don't we see whether we could organise such a
thing and approaching AUUG to help out when AUUG is holding one of its
regular conferences in Adelaide?
