&gt;&gt;&gt; Good to see that they plan to support FreeBSD - at least for now.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How much difference do you think it'd make if they didn't?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; [ Or, to put it another way, isn't one of the major benefits of Open
&gt;&gt;   Source associated with the fact that it isn't tied to any one vendor,
&gt;&gt;   and that the project can continue if that vendor goes out of business
&gt;&gt;   or loses interest? ]
&gt;
&gt; Agreed.  But if Key Players (Jordan Hubbard for example) disappeared
&gt; as his new employer decided to pay him to work on something else, it
&gt; could have an effect, at least temporarily.

This won't happen.  I don't want to breach a confidence, but you can
be sure that Jordan is with Wind River not because he was taken over
with the merger, but because they specifically requested him to run
the FreeBSD operation.  He was already due to start a different,
highly interesting job back in February, and had to go through some
soul-searching in order to go with WinDriver (what a name).  If they
put him on to something else, he'd be gone in a flash.

&gt; Of course that gives the opportunity for someone else to step up and
&gt; contribute.  Not that I think that'll happen anytime soon, but these
&gt; sorts of things have happened ie. with TCL when whatever company was
&gt; bought out and it took at little rearranging of key people for
&gt; things to continue.

Note that the FreeBSD project isn't jkh.  We have a core team of 9
people (3 of them Australian :-) and over 250 developers with direct
access to the source tree.  If jkh were to leave, we'd miss him, but
the project would go on.
