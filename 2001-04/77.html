Hi Peter,
I've had experience with iPrimus ADSL & Telstra cable & both offer fair
performance.

Both technologies have had some black reliability issues.
I know 3 friends on Telstra cable & I use iPrimus ADSL.

The main problems are systemic Telstra or iPrimus administration issues,
but with persistence I've got them resolved.

Without exception, ISP technical support is useless, you're on your own,
you'll get more support from this ListServ than anywhere else.

Read-up on your particular technology & have a reference Windoze box
available to plug-in. No broadband ISP supports anything but Wintel. If
they can reproduce the problem on 'Doze, they'll escalate the problem. (
I run OS/2 on my gateway).

I had a noisy PSTN line that was finally fixed after 3 separate visits
from different Telstra technicians.
I suspect this fault contributed to my ADSL reliability problems.
However there was also problems with the iPrimus intranet which they
were successfully able to reproduce on their Wintel box, so they
escalated the problem.

I don't use the PSTN line for telephony as I have an Orange One
telephone, (CDMA phone). I have set-up a fax server on it now, & later
will setup a ppp dial-in server.

For ADSL you'll need a PPPoE client, & for cable you'll need bpalogin.

Looking at the entry-level options, cable offers superior bandwidth,
albeit being a shared network technology, the actual bandwidth could
vary widely, (Quality of Service, QoS).

I have a 256/64 ADSL link & its just fine:- I'm not terribly interested
in streaming etc, having the permanent connection opens up all sorts of
possibilities & is of more interest to me than bandwidth.
However ADSL does offer a QoS unlike cable.

Both services provide a DHCP supplied "fixed" IP:- whilst not
guaranteed, in reality, it is.

Don't go for anything longer than a 12 month plan:- communications
charges without exception are getting cheaper & cheaper.

Look at what else you can do with the cable:- do you want pay TV for
example?
You'll probably want to use your existing PSTN line for telephony.
Look at the total cost of ownership:- installation, monthly access,
download charges etc.

&gt; Earlier today, I wailed my lack of on ADSL-ready phone exchange and
&gt; contemplated cable internet access, thus:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As a resident of the "World's Best Suburb" (GG development) my local
&gt; &gt;exchange is not ADSL-ready.  Based on what has already been discussed on
&gt; &gt;this list in the past (October, 2000) the wiring method that was used in
&gt; &gt;the area meant that ADSL connectivity was not likely to occur in a hurry -
&gt; &gt;if at all!  My street does, however, have cable running through it - and
&gt; &gt;if I wish, I could be connected up right away.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to the response received!
&gt; 
&gt; With 2 exchanges covering the GG development, it now appears that one of
&gt; the exchanges (the "Golden Grove" exchange) has recently become ADSL-ready!
&gt; 
&gt; The other exchange ("Greenwith") (which I'm connected to) is, however, not
&gt; ADSL-ready.
&gt; 
&gt; hmmm, I've waited this long, I may as well hang in there just that little
&gt; bit longer!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Peter
