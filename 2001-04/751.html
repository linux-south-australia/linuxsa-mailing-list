Hmmmm...

&gt; But if you don't know where a particular organisation stands on such a
&gt; topic, whether you are a member or not (which incidentally, I am) isn't
&gt; it better to ask than to assume or ignore?

Yes, I agree. However I'd take Jason's invitation at face value; after
all, we all use one of the operating systems that is Unix-like.

&gt; As an organisation AUUG (or
&gt; any other organisation) may or may not be doing something about what
&gt; this thread used to be about.

I'm not aware of any national thoughts on this matter at this point of
time. However, the local chapter may be an appropriate place to begin
discussing some type of action.

&gt; Is it not better to pool resources? Too do
&gt; so, surely you need to know where people stand.

It is better to pool resources. Speaking for myself only, though,
because this issue strays from the purely technical formulating a
consistent opinion on it will take time and debate. However, in my
opinion, it's worth the time to work through this issue and see where
what we can achieve.
