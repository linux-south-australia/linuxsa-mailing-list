Hi All,
    I am in the process of setting up a dialin for a
friend's server. I have not done this before by myself and
have run into a few problems. I have read the Serial HOWTO
and the Modem HOWTO, and I discovered a good document on the
net called the "Pocket ISP for Redhat HOWTO" which walks
through a setup for exactly the setup I have. So I have done
some deep research. Here is the problem:

    After configuring the machine based on the above
documents, I have managed to get the remote machine (in this
case a Toshiba Laptop) to successfully dialin, connect and
authenticate properly. It sits there quite happily and
maintains the connection as it is supposed to do. When I
hang up from the Laptop, the server detects the dropped
carrier and resets the modem for the next call and a
successful new dialin  can be made as above. The server log
(/var/log/messages) indicates a successful login too. The
problem is that while connected, the Laptop cannot do
anything.  I thought at first it was a simple DNS problem
and checked and changed the appropriate configs, but it
still refused to work. I then tried the obvious ping the
server and anywhere outside, and it was at this point I
discovered I couldn't ping the server at all (request timed
out). I have used the Laptop for other dialins before and
the config appears identical to other configs and so I think
that it is the server. I have pinged the laptop network card
successfully when it is connected to the network and it
works so ping is not broken. I have looked in the server
logs, but I cannot find any references to ping while I was
connected.

    I believe that this is just a simple config problem on
the server, but I don't have enough experience to track it
down. Where do I look to get some info on troubleshooting
(i.e. docs and logs, the docs I have don't shed any light
they say it should work fine)? I know I should be close
because the server and Laptop maintains the connection, but
which log should contain ping info etc. What logs and config
files do people need to help me troubleshoot? Can anyone
help?

    I am using RH7.0 for the server, and I have set up
mgetty on ttyS2 (I have 4 com ports, 1 for internet
connection and eventually 3 for dialins). What I need is 3
dialins working and the machine to be a 10 user ISP for a
small business. The other problem I have is time. I need to
get this fixed ASAP as I leave for interstate in 7 days and
it MUST be working before then. Thanks all in advance for
any help you can offer
