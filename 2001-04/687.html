&gt; 1. It creates a perception among future technologists that there is only
&gt;    one solution, one way of doing things: The Microsoft way.

Although when you show them linux, they may sway their opinion. All
microsoft is doing is showing them their product - show the public our
product.

&gt; 2. It creates a nation of technology users, not technology producers.
&gt;    It seems to me that these people are then totaly dependent on
&gt;    someone else's technology, and are far less likely to create their
&gt;    own technology for our future benefit.

Not really - those who want to produce will produce, you cant expect ALL PC
users to be PC producers.

Microsoft doesnt pose a big threat, if Linux is as good as everyone here
beleives it is, you shouldnt have to worry about microsoft. I would worry
more about showing people that it is better than dwelling over the fact that
microsoft are marketing their products well.

&gt;
&gt; Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps Microsoft is the best thing since
&gt; sliced bread,
&gt; and I have a perverse and wicked desire to find something bad in
&gt; Microsoft's generosity in having shared their wonderful technology with us
&gt; all, and if so, can someone please tell me so?

The best for some people - some applications at this present moment. Linux
is much better for other applications at this present moment!
