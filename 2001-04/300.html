Hi All, I have been using linux for about a year now on a ppc and have been
asked by a friend to put together a 486 linux box as a firewall. My problem is
that I variably can't get fdisk or the RH (6.0) installer to create
partitions/recognise the hard drive.
When I finish with fdisk and write the partition table it reports that it's
calling ioctl but then hangs unless I start the fdisk session with the `o'
create new DOS partition table to start with (I'm guessin that this may not be
surprising, but fdisk says when it starts that it has already created a new
partition table).
OK, so if I do get fdisk to finish by the above method, I can progress further
through the isntallation but before I get a chance to choose packages etc, the
installer says that it can't recognise the hard drive and asks me to
reinitialize it, it doesn't get past this problem and keeps cycling on this
(sorry if this is a bit vague but I describing this from memory of a couple of
days ago).
Does anyone have any ideas what may be going on or what I could try? I've looked
in several DOS/Linux books about partitioning, but the descriptions I see all
suggest that it should be as easy and working as I remember it being on my ppc
box.

thanks
Dan
