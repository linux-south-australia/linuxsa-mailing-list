&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. It costs them money to make it, and while I dont agree in
&gt; companys like microsoft ripping megabucks out of people I think they
&gt; (mandrake) deserve enough cash to pay thier wages and make a fair
&gt; profit. They are doing a lot to bring linux to the masses by generally
&gt; making a nicer and easier disto without limiting the power of people who
&gt; want to edit the conf files themselves and get thier hands dirty. I
&gt; thought mandrake 7.2 (while not perfect) had a much more sensible
&gt; interface and defaults than redhats efforts of late.

I agree with the sentiment that we should support distros by sending them money.

But "reward a job well done" or "It costs them money to make it"???  Most of the
software they provide is GPLd or BSDd.  They didn't write it, not did they fund
someone else to write it.  They may have written a slick installer, pulled
various packages together, and performed some basic quality control, but what
Mandrake, like RH/SuSE/whoever are really doing is making things convenient by
providing free(dom) software at a cheap cost.  If any particular distro
disappears open-source software will continue to be developed and enhanced - it
may be harder to obtain, but that's all.  Distros are important, but not that
important.

Just IHMO,

Michael...
