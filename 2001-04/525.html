&gt; 
&gt; The WHATSNEW.txt file follows.

&gt;         The Samba Team.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;               WHATS NEW IN Samba 2.2.0
&gt;               ========================
&gt; 
&gt; This is the official Samba 2.2.0 release. This version of Samba provides
&gt; the following new features and enhancements.
&gt; 
&gt; Integration between Windows oplocks and NFS file opens (IRIX and Linux
&gt; 2.4 kernel only). This gives complete data and locking integrity between
&gt; Windows and UNIX file access to the same data files.
&gt; 
&gt; Ability to act as an authentication source for Windows 2000 clients as
&gt; well as for NT4.x clients.
&gt; 
&gt; Integration with the winbind daemon that provides a single
&gt; sign on facility for UNIX servers in Windows 2000/NT4 networks
&gt; driven by a Windows 2000/NT4 PDC. winbind is not included in
&gt; this release, it currently must be obtained separately. We are
&gt; committed to including winbind in a future Samba 2.2.x release.
&gt; 
&gt; Support for native Windows 2000/NT4 printing RPCs. This includes
&gt; support for automatic printer driver download.
&gt; 
&gt; Support for server supported Access Control Lists (ACLs).
&gt; This release contains support for the following filesystems:
&gt; 
&gt;     Solaris 2.6+
&gt;     SGI Irix
&gt;     Linux Kernel with ACL patch from <A HREF="http://acl.bestbits.at">http://acl.bestbits.at</A>
&gt;         Linux Kernel with XFS ACL support.
&gt;         Caldera/SCO UnixWare
&gt;         IBM AIX
&gt;         FreeBSD (with external patch)
&gt; 
&gt; Other platforms will be supported as resources are
&gt; available to test and implement the encessary modules. If
&gt; you are interested in writing the support for a particular
&gt; ACL filesystem, please join the samba-technical mailing
&gt; list and coordinate your efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; On PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) based systems - better debugging
&gt; messages and encrypted password users now have access control verified via
&gt; PAM - Note: Authentication still uses the encrypted password database.
&gt; 
&gt; Rewritten internal locking semantics for more robustness.
&gt; This release supports full 64 bit locking semantics on all
&gt; (even 32 bit) platforms. SMB locks are mapped onto POSIX
&gt; locks (32 bit or 64 bit) as the underlying system allows.
&gt; 
&gt; Conversion of various internal flat data structures to use
&gt; database records for increased performance and
&gt; flexibility.
&gt; 
&gt; Support for acting as a MS-DFS (Distributed File System) server.
&gt; 
&gt; Support for manipulating Samba shares using Windows client tools
&gt; (server manager). Per share security can be set using these tools
&gt; and Samba will obey the access restrictions applied.
&gt; 
&gt; Samba profiling support (see below).
&gt; 
&gt; Compile time option for enabling a (Virtual file system) VFS layer
&gt; to allow non-disk resources to be exported as Windows filesystems
&gt; (such as databases etc.).
&gt; 
&gt; The documentation in this release has been updated and converted
&gt; from Yodl to DocBook 4.1. There are many new parameters since 2.0.7
&gt; and some defaults have changed.
&gt; 
&gt; Profiling support.
&gt; ------------------
&gt; Support for collection of profile information. A shared
&gt; memory area has been created which contains counters for
&gt; the number of calls to and the amount of time spent in
&gt; various system calls and smb transactions. See the file
&gt; profile.h for a complete listing of the information
&gt; collected. Sample code for a samba pmda (collection agent
&gt; for Performance Co-Pilot) has been included in the pcp
&gt; directory.
&gt; 
&gt; To enable the profile data collection code in samba, you
&gt; must compile samba with profile support (run configure with
&gt; the --with-profile option). On startup, collection of data
&gt; is disabled. To begin collecting data use the smbcontrol
&gt; program to turn on profiling (see the smbcontrol man page).
&gt; Profile information collection can be enabled for all smbd
&gt; processes or one or more selected processes. The profiling
&gt; data collected is the aggragate for all processes that have
&gt; profiling enabled.
&gt; 
&gt; With samba compiled for profile data collection, you may see
&gt; a very slight degradation in performance even with profiling
&gt; collection turned off. On initial tests with NetBench on an
&gt; SGI Origin 200 server, this degradation was not measureable
&gt; with profile collection off compared to no profile collection
&gt; compiled into samba.
&gt; 
&gt; With count profile collection enabled on all clients, the
&gt; degradation was less than 2%. With full profile collection
&gt; enabled on all clients, the degradation was about 8.5%.
&gt;
