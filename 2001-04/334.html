Actually whilst on the subject of ISP's / Static IP I might ask a question or
ten...

I'm currently on a "unlimited" plan with asiaonline -- that is, unlimited
downloads, but reconnections every 6 hours.

For a while they I could be pernamently connected (no static IP tho, still
dynamic.. same as it is now, just no 6 hour hard disconnect), it was a nice deal
:)  I actually found that my leeching was minimised, strangely enough.. and I'm
sure I'm not the only person who did this.  Having a pernament connection there
I idled a lot.  With a 6 hour reconnection, it seems I want to leech to my max.
bandwidth to justify the redial costs..

Anyways, I think I'm over the whole "leech as much as I want" phase and I'd
prefer a pernament IP / static IP deal.

I live in the Victor Harbor area; tis my only problem.  I'd also need a half
decent download limit (Ideally I want perm connect / unlim downloads, but I've
come to the conclusion this isnt a reality in .au unfortunately...) but I reckon
I could live with a 1gig download limit.. preferably more, but yeah.  I dont
want to restrict myself to the point of stupidity :P  (yes, &lt;1gig is stupidity
to me, I've had periods of 8+gig download/month with asiaonline).

I'd also be interested to know of any ISP's in Adelaide that do the same, but
primarily, in Victor.

I only know of 5 isp's down here..

- Asia Online (no perm. connect afaik.. im with them now..  apart from the 6
hour disconnect, I can only praise them.)
- Granite (they dont offer one afaik)
- Camtech/Ozemail (ditto..)
- Internode (dont think they do...)
- Intertech (Only heard bad things about them).

I think there's another, fairson, but I believe they're just got a box
telehosted with internode.. looks like a redhat b0x3n too, and not a very secure
one at that :~(

Anyways, any suggestions would be appreciated :)

Thanks.

Ryan Verner.
