Hi.

Actually, I have been meaning to ask if anyone has managed to get named to
log to a file instead of syslog? The named.conf man page is a bit too
arcane for me, I don't seem to be able to create a working named.conf that
logs to /var/log/named, and the standard syslog logging (in RedHat) spews
named rubbish into the /var/log/messages.

Anyone have a suggestion or fix?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; I didn't think of it this way initially. That is, as you say, quite
&gt; &gt; disappointing. It's almost a MS way of doing things -- "Upgrade all your
&gt; &gt; other programs and it'll work with our 'new' OS". Is this a diliberate
&gt; &gt; effort on the ISC's part?
&gt; 
&gt; But, where do you try to stop being 'backward compatible' and introduce a
&gt; new set of functions?
&gt; 
&gt; Who would argue that the way MSDOS 6 treats memory (640K limit, etc) is a
&gt; majorly stupid way of doing things?? Now, who can remember why they did like
&gt; that? backward compatibility with MSDOS v0.0.0.0.0.1 or something stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes you just need to start from scratch with a new system and forget
&gt; about the old one.
