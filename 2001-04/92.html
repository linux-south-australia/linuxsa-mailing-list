&gt; Good morning,
&gt; 
&gt; I am using AMaViS with Sendmail.  It works well but requires separate
&gt; scanning software and there don't seem to be many good FREE options
&gt; there.  I tried using inocucmd (InoculateIT for Unix from Computer
&gt; Associates), but they don't update it quickly enough to make it
&gt; effective against new viruses.  Sophos Sweep seems to be well 
&gt; supported,
&gt; and I think you can get a trial version.
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.sophos.com.au">http://www.sophos.com.au</A>

I've used Sophos - for Windows - and it was pretty cool.  It did
clever things and picked up viruses and stuff.  It's written for
many platforms and licensing is reasonably priced.  If I was going
to try a virus scanner for linux/sendmail/defanger/etc I'd try 
Sophos fer sure.

&lt;/plug&gt;

There are probably other good ones too though :)


Cheers,

Nick!
