&gt; I would like to point out to the rest of the readers that this is a bad

&gt; Here is an idea.  Get your scripts working properly, test them, and then 
&gt; put them on your firewall.  There is no real need to dick about with your 
&gt; firewall all the time.  That's what the testing phase is all about.

&gt; &gt;Now I start my scripts by making all chains accept-everything,
&gt; &gt;and I only block-everything at the end of the script.

I'd just like to point out to the innocent bystanders that Mark
has not inquired as to the circumstances and context of my statement.
Think for yourselves. I do.
There are no simple rules for right nad wrong in developing firewall scripts.
Every statment that mark has made is wrong, because he didn't check the
context and circumstances.

So just develop your firewall scripts as you see fit in view of
your own circumstances.
Whatever you want to do is good.
Don't let anyone make you feel guilty about the way you develop
and test your firewall scripts.
As Larry Wall said: "There's more than one way to do it."
That applies to all areas of computing, not just Perl scripts.
Test on a live system if it pleases you.
Test on an off-line system (as I did) if you feel like it.
But more important than anything else - think for yourselves.
You/we are all individuals.
The ethicists call this "situation ethics" as opposed to "rule ethics".
Rule ethics are designed for people who do not have courage to
think for themselves.

Guilt is bad. Experimentation is good.
It's linux. It's your life. Live it to the full. Get funky.

Cheers, and goodnight,
Alan Kennington.

PS. As the game rules on bubblegum packs always say:
The judge's decision is final, and flames will not be entered into.
