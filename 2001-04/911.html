&gt;Yes I know but at a higher monthly fee. I think 15,gb entry would be better

Yes, well -it costs more to deliver more- :)

I considered a higher included volume allowance on the entry level 
plan but I also decided that eventually (not this year, but 
eventually) breaking even on ADSL was a better tactic that going 
broke. Strange, that :)


&gt;  &gt; &gt; 2. The setup costs are fine
&gt;  &gt; &gt; 3. The monthly access should be no more than 80 it's more than BP now (I
&gt;  &gt; &gt; understand the wholesale price issue)
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Don't compare apples with oranges:  you get a better package than BP
&gt;  &gt;delivers too.
&gt;YEs and no, BP offer an AUP no additional charges as such on their freedom
&gt;plan which is ok but the AUP is a dodgy piece of work IMHO.

So it isn't ok really. And you don't get a static IP. And you get to 
fiddle with PPPoE client software.

Its your decision. Go ahead and order the Telstra one if you want :)

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;Well perhaps but I feel a reasonable limit would ensure most people stay
&gt;within it, for my needs 1.5gb a month would be sufficient it may not be for
&gt;others.

No problem, we -have- a 1.5gb service offering, you just don't find 
the price to be acceptable for your needs. That's ok, it's a free 
country. We are very comfortable with both the price and the long 
term sustainability of our 1.5 gb plans.

&gt;Sadly you cant run a business by customising plans like that.

Right. In particular, we already -have- the plan you need, but I have 
to say that the ADSL pricing models have nowhere downward to go in 
them right now - because they're just so expensive to us internally 
from Telstra for the bits we have to obtain from them. We have more 
room to move in other things, but not ADSL.
