&gt; I have a question about Data Over Voice ISDN.

Hi Jason,

(NetJet-ISDN-Redhat-7.1-HOWTO follows to keep it relevant to linux)

The first thing to keep in mind is that using a modem is already a way
of doing DOV. Using an ISDN device to do DOV is simply removing the
inefficiencies of converting digital-&gt;analogue-&gt;digital again for
transmission.
 
&gt; Is it techinically possible for Telstra to prevent DOV ISDN?

Most DOV setups don't work over STD calls already, when the "speech"
call bearer-capability is used (0x8090a3). Cisco and all Windows DOV
drivers I've encountered use this, presumably because it should be a
cheaper tarif than ordinary voice. If you use a 3.1Khz Audio bearer-cap
(0x9090a3), a digital 64K channel is required for transmission. The
Traverse NetJet drivers use this method.

Telstra have cleverly worded the contract and marketing for ORHH to make
sure that it's not legally a 'standard telephone service' which is
required to have untimed local voice AND data calls by the ACA.

AAPT and it's reseller (Synergy/ntgroup.com.au) are offering untimed
local voice and data calls on ISDN for business. I don't imagine that
will last long if everyone starts using them to replace Xpress
connections.

&gt; (obviously it is posible for tesltra to make it economically unnatractive
&gt; eg charge all calls at data rates regardless of whether they are data or
&gt; voice)

Never mind how good ISDN looks, Telstra seem determined to make it look
unattractive compared to ADSL..
 
&gt; I dont know anythign about isdn signalling, so my terminology will be
&gt; incorrect, but my understanding is taht DOV works because a flag is set
&gt; when teh call is beign set up saying that this acall willeb data or voice,
&gt; and that with DVO you always set teh call up to be data.

That's pretty much how it works.
 
&gt; Is there any means apart from this flag for the carrier to detect that
&gt; the a call is actually data, not voice traffic?

If they snoop on the contents of the call, it's rather obvious that it's
a data call. Fortunately privacy legislation would make it difficult for
them to use that against you. The ACA say that voice calls on ISDN must
comply with international standards, and those standards specifically
make DOV possible. For Telstra to mess with them would mean breaking the
standard.
 
&gt; for the carrier to detect the call's type(ie voice or data)?

Exchanges can already spot fax and modem traffic.
 
&gt; Inshort i think I am askign if there si any means apart form cahging the
&gt; price structure of Home Highhway(or withdrawing it) that telstra can use
&gt; to stop people using DOV?

They can compress your calls down to 8K if you're using Cisco/Windows
style DOV.

Still reading? Here's how I've been able to get NetJet cards doing DOV
with Redhat 7.1

1) Grab the 2.4.3 kernel. The netjet cards should work with 2.4.2, but I
couldn't get it to compile with the Redhat supplied kernel source.

2) Grab the 2.2 Kernel drivers from Traverse, don't read any of the
instructions, they'll confuse things.

3) from the isdn directory in the traverse tar, copy
drivers/isdn/isdn_net.c to /usr/src/linux/drivers/isdn/

4) make menuconfig (choose Hisax with DSS1/Euro and Netjet Passive
ISDN);make dep; make clean; make modules; make modules_install; make
kernel_image_to_taste. Don't forget to choose modules for the other
stuff you'll need, like a network card.

5) use it like any other ISDN device with a V in front of the phone
number. Keep in mind that the Redhat isdn-config doesn't accept alpha
characters in it's GUI, so edit the config manually.
