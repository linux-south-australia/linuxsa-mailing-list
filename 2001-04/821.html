&gt; &gt; Good things aren't necessarily cheap things, as I've gone to great
&gt; &gt; lengths to point out in various other debates on this list.
&gt;
&gt; Generally I think the pricing is reasonable, but $20/month for four
&gt; (additional) IP addresses?  $5/month *each*?

I don't know what it costs to provide them, but I suspect that Internode pay
a monthly/yearly fee to _someone_ for their large chunk of IP addresses, so
I imagine this reflects that somewhat...

However, remember that it's about business, and in business, you don't
decide your charges solely by looking at the cost of the supply side of the
product, you look at what the demand side is willing to pay. If 5 IPs would
be nice, but you would really only want to pay $1/year per IP, then I guess
you miss out. In Internode's veiw of the market, there are enough customers
out there willing to pay $5/IP/year to make that a sensible price-point.
Also, remember that every time they do this, they are effectively
sacrificing enough IP addresses to sell another ADSL connection (4), for
$20/month... That's all part of the cost... Finally, note that there is a
lot of competition in the ISP world at the moment, and you can be sure that
if it can be done cheaper profitably, someone will do it... (in fact, even
if it can't, someone will probably do it)... If Internode find that they are
losing customers due to this price, I'm sure they will find ways to reduce
it...

Note that I'm no Internode apologist, but I beleive that every business has
the right to conduct their business in whatever way they want, in order to
maximise their profit, and the market forces decide in the end who gets the
profit. (remember Economics 101 (paraphrased) -- if some business activity
is highly profitable, more suppliers will copy it until the price is driven
down by competition... witness the wine industry...)
