<H1>Cable Internet Access in Adelaide!</H1>

Just got off the phone with Telstra who advise me that Cable Internet 
access using the Foxtel cable network is now available in Adelaide!

(Has this already been mentioned on here?)

During previous contact with Telstra many months back, they told me that 
cable access would not be available in areas that were not already 
connected - which meant that Adelaide would miss out altogether!?

As a resident of the "World's Best Suburb" (GG development) my local 
exchange is not ADSL-ready.  Based on what has already been discussed on 
this list in the past (October, 2000) the wiring method that was used in 
the area meant that ADSL connectivity was not likely to occur in a hurry - 
if at all!  My street does, however, have cable running through it - and if 
I wish, I could be connected up right away.

A couple of questions:

- If I was to wait: Is ADSL bound to arrive in my area (just like cable 
access was "never" going to arrive into Adelaide)?

and,

- If I was to sell my soul, err sign up:  How easy/difficult would it be 
for a non-guru to get cable access up and running in a Linux box? (I have 
RH6.2)

Cheers,

Peter

P.S.  Foxtel subscribers get the following discounts to their installation fee:

- 3 month contract - no discount ($399)
- 12 month contract - normally $259, get a $50 discount
- 18 month contract - normally $189, get $50 discount and first month's 
access free.

P.P.S.  I'm not sure what the situation is with Foxtel Satellite subscribers.
