&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, how about if we came up with a Zero Administration Linux (MS was
&gt; &gt; &gt; using the "Zero Administration" buzzword a while back to sell it's stuff
&gt; &gt; &gt; to schools). It would be possible to have a distribution that asked very
&gt; &gt; &gt; few questions and locked itself down real tight. Then nobody would need
&gt; &gt; &gt; to spend much money. I mean it would be *Another* Linux distribution,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but if it served a purpose....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IMHO, the problem here is twofold:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) ongoing maintenance (new bugs, vulnarabilities, exploits, bitrot, etc)
&gt; &gt; 2) ongoing changes (new projects, new requirements, etc)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You need a skilled person to track the state of Linux and the changing
&gt; &gt; requirements, and then decide what to do, and implement the changes. It is
&gt; &gt; simply not enough to set up a system, no matter how well, and leave it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; At last a sentiment I can agree with 100%.

I think everyone would agree with this, but if you look at the example
of the Linux distro, you would send out patches and updates. Whoever was
maintaining this would have their own machine set up the same as
everyone elses and would test the update process. Obviously this is the
sort of thing that would be done by a company, not a group of
enthusiasts.

Just an example anyway. :-)
