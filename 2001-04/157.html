&gt; Or use Ximian's red-carpet updater.  It's still beta, but it's the nicest

&gt; enhanced 1.4 packages yet - I'm waiting for them rather than the normal GNOME
&gt; rpms, as they add some sparkle to icons etc :-)

Unfortunately, Ximian do not support distributions that do not use RPM or
dpkg package management systems.  This means that users of Slackware are
unable to use Ximian in a natively packaged format - sure, one could use
rpm2tgz on the Red Hat 6.2 packages, or mv rpm to rpm.bin and then create
a script called rpm that runs rpm.bin with --force --nodeps, which would
even allow one to use the Ximian updater, but this is not a real solution,
and there is always a chance anomolies between RH6.2 and
Slackware.  Slackware-current is wholly glibc-2.2 based, so when that is
released as a stable version, there will be no similar supported system by
Ximian whose packages could be used.

The problem, they say, is with dependancy checking - the Slackware package
system does not support it, so Ximian have no immidiate plans to support
Slackware.  This is not a problem, as one can just download the GNOME
tarballs (hence my need to find an Australian GNOME mirror site), or wait
for it to be packaged in Slackware.  I've read some posts in the
Slackware.com forums, one particularly by Pat V (the lead developer) that
states that there should not be a problem for Ximian in implementing
a Slackware distribution.  I'm not sure what this would require for
Ximian, so I am really in any position to state on this.  However, with
the advent of Red Carpet, things should become easier - as far as I am
aware (having not tried it yet) it deals with dependancies itself, so all
that would be required is some sort of (XML?) file or simple database that
tells the dependancies of the slackware Ximian GNOME packages, and Red
Carpet would look at this.  Probably far more is required, especially
concerning the updating of system packages.

It would be nice if Ximian released source tarballs of their modified
GNOME packages, so those on unsupported platforms would be able to
experience their improvements.

That's all for now :)
