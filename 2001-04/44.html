That's a tad paranoid.  Looking at it from the NSA's point
of view in trying to build a secure computer architecture
for storing classified materials:  the Rainbow series was a
failure, ITSEC was a failure, engaging Microsoft was a failure.

Now they are building it themselves, and Linux is the obvious
platform to do this on.  And getting the code into the kernel
would make ubiquitous deployment across the services a snack.

&gt; I know its all still open source, but who is going
&gt; to read the source of an entire distro looking for
&gt; one back door?

The opposition agencies.  Some have better computer
intrusion skills than the NSA (eg: France) and would
wish to retain this advantage.  Others would wish
to deploy the platform and would require some assurance
before doing so.

They won't only be looking for backdoors, but an insight
into NSA's computer architecture priorities.  For example,
the treatment of Mandatory Access Control is revealing
as it implies a desire to make a future change in
classification criteria.

This in turn changes the personnel that a competing
agency would seek to subvert.

&gt; Can anyine say "clipper chip" or "v-chip" ?

Or DES.  No backdoor found to date, only hints that NSA
crypto was some years in advance of academic crypto and
when faced with a decision the NSA made choices that would
improve DES's security.

Glen
