Well said!

Short story is Internode have a product, it costs x!

If you want it buy it otherwise don't.

But rest assured, they are not going to give it to you.

Cheers

&gt;I am beginning to wonder about the intelligence of some people here....
&gt;
&gt;Most of this has been covered a-plenty earlier.
&gt;
&gt;Caching - already done, factored in to the costs of most ISPs.
&gt;complaints about caps/limits/allowances - TANSTAAFL, get used to it.
There's
&gt;lots of competition in the small-medium ISP market, so you can be assured
&gt;that margins are pretty low as they are.
&gt;Costs of IP addresses - Competition will ensure that they are
&gt;"competitive"...
&gt;setup costs - as above.
&gt;
&gt;Remember that all businesses are there to make a profit. The only way you
&gt;can change what a business does is through legislation (as a last resort),
&gt;or with money. If the price you are willing to pay for the products and
&gt;services that you desire is sufficient to be profitable, you can bet that
&gt;there will be a business somewhere that will take it up (bear in mind that
&gt;"profitable" can be harder to acheive than you think when the market is
&gt;small). However, when someone already in business says "no, we don't want
to
&gt;do that, as we don't think it will be profitable" (whether or not they
&gt;justify why they don't think it will be profitable) then that's fine. They
&gt;could be wrong, but hey -- it's _their_ business... If you want a business
&gt;to do that, set one up, put your money where your mouth is, and see if you
&gt;can make money from it.
&gt;
&gt;People in general will make themselves look a lot less dumb if they refrain
&gt;from harping on about things that they don't understand... it's good to ask
&gt;a question, but when the question is answered, over and over again, and you
&gt;ask it again, you become known as an imbecile, and rightly so.
&gt;
&gt;rr
&gt;
&gt;PS none of this is personal, but I may well point out that it's the same
&gt;people asking the same questions, making the same points, and continuing to
&gt;look stupid.
