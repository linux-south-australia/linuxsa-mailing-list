&gt;  &gt; Good to see that they plan to support FreeBSD - at least for now.
&gt; 
&gt; How much difference do you think it'd make if they didn't?
&gt; 
&gt; [ Or, to put it another way, isn't one of the major benefits of Open
&gt;   Source associated with the fact that it isn't tied to any one vendor,
&gt;   and that the project can continue if that vendor goes out of business
&gt;   or loses interest? ]

Agreed.  But if Key Players (Jordan Hubbard for example) disappeared as his new
employer decided to pay him to work on something else, it could have an effect,
at least temporarily.

Of course that gives the opportunity for someone else to step up and
contribute.  Not that I think that'll happen anytime soon, but these sorts of
things have happened ie. with TCL when whatever company was bought out and it
took at little rearranging of key people for things to continue.
