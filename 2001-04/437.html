Hello David,

I didn't think that I had changed anything, but I shifted cards around in
the m/c to no avail. After a while it dawned on me that one of the hard
drives was sharing the same IRQ as the ide controller. Removed the small
hard drive and what do you know, Mandrake is a happy little chappy and is
currently installing it's little heart out.

Once again, thanks for the advice.

Anthony Tuck

Why have I got Linux on the spare machine? I don't know,,,,will have to
change that!!!

&gt; Hi There!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I've turned off the HTML thing in OE, I should have known that it would
reek
&gt; &gt; havoc in other mail clients. It's really weird with this Mandrake
problem, I
&gt; &gt; have already installed this OS using graphical installer on this PC
prior to
&gt; &gt; now and it went without hitch, all the other distro's were the same,
only
&gt; &gt; now, when I went to install Mandrake this time it misbehaved. I will
give
&gt; &gt; htese ideas a try.
&gt;
&gt; You have probably changed something. Memory perhaps?
