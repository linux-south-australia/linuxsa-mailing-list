&gt; &gt; And the mistakes can be very catastrophic.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't really know what you're doing, you shouldn't be accessing a
&gt; terminal as root.

Or if you odnt know what you are doing you should nto be accessing the
windows nt box as "administrator".
Same argument.

Which was my pioint. You can screw up no matter what OS you ahve, and no
matter what your skils, are, if you are prudent the risk is about the smae
either way.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Without clmaing to be an experiecned unix sys admin, my worst was killing
&gt; &gt; job %1, but oops I forgot the percent. Night night init. doh!.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would very much argure that adminstrator privilidge on any system is
&gt; &gt; dangerous regardless, in inexperienced hands.
&gt; 
&gt; Dangerous is the wrong word. Potential to be catastrophic is more
&gt; fitting. There's also potential that I'll accidently put a Windows boot
&gt; disk with format c: in the autoexec.bat.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I migt also argue that with gui systems _soemtimes_ there is a more wordy
&gt; &gt; explanationof what you are about to do, assuign you read it, which is nto
&gt; &gt; there for clis.
&gt; 
&gt; I think the line under sometimes needs to be darker. GUI tools are
&gt; generally very inflexible. They're designed to do one or two things
&gt; only. If you try to extend them too far, nasty things start to happen
&gt; behind your back.
&gt; 

Sure but infelxibility can be good to, it lessens the scope for damage.
