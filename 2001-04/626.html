Richard,

I agree this is not very linux-specific, except that linux and BSD users
are more likely than mac and ms users to stick their home machine on
the end of a permanent link and set up a web server.

I went through the same thing a couple of years ago wehn I wanted
to register my first web domain.
Now I've got 17 domains, and I get pestered continually by all those
search engines probing, probing, probing.....

When you create a new domain (if that's what you've done), you'll
generally get a few offers from commercial concerns offering to
register your site with 50,000 search engines.

But in fact, you'll find that shortly after you create a new domain,
the search engines come and index it.

The other day, I made a configuration error in my new Apache config file,
and as I left it overnight with an unintended virtual host in place,
I got a complete indexing by two search engines before I woke up
the next day.

Anyway, here's my answer to the question.
Go to this page:

<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/websearch.html">http://www.topology.org/websearch.html</A>

And click on the items marked "Add URL".
Some of these links may still be valid after the last 12 
months of not checking them.

Nowadays some search engines want you to pay to be indexed.
But if you just register with a handful of free-indexing engines,
the rest will come and find you anyway, including the search
engines in France, China, Japan etc. etc.
And some of them just download everything at your full link rate.
(Not good if you have 60 MB of material!)

And then you'll need to get a bandwidth throttler to stop them
all wasting your bandwidth.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Here's an example ad:
Domain name obliterated for anonymity.
Note the way they use a female name and the word "love" to
con the vulnerable guys out there!
