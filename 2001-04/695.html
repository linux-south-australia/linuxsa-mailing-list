hey all, 

i read this thread with particular interest since i work for tafe, nothing
fancy i'm afriad, just the computer support guy. here are some of my own
thoughts based on what i have seen. 

our decisions on what software we install are based primarily on the
following ..

- industry demands

tafe aims to train people to meet the needs of industry. right now we're
facing a computer industry where microsoft is dominant (feel free to
correct me on this assumption) :) , so it follows that a training
institution such as tafe should be training people with microsoft software
in order to be successful. 

- ease of support 

we have very limited resources, approximately one support person per 300
machines, where i work. 
computing rooms must be shared by different areas and still be capable of
meeting the needs of both. a lot of specialised applications are written
for microsoft windows (e.g. software from the real estate institute).

- curriculum requirements

for most of the subjects offered by tafe, we need to meet the requirements
laid out in a national curriculum. maybe the people who set this are the
ones that need to be educated about the benefits linux can offer. :)


having said all that, linux is currently taught at adelaide, panorama and
port adelaide tafes. it's is probably taught at others too, but these are
the ones i am aware of. apple macs make up 50% of croydon tafe's computers
for the graphic arts programme.  it was only a couple of weeks ago i
attended the demonstration of mac OS X (we have been playing with a beta
version for a while now too). 

i can't speak for primary/secondary schools since i have no involvment with
them, but i have never seen any evidence of a microsoft-only policy within
tafe. we use whatever suits the situation within the constraints of our
resources. 

anyway, enough rambling. if tafe and the school system really aren't
holding up their end when it comes to presenting alternatives to microsoft
then let's look at ways of assisting them. we have a very powerful resource
at our disposal in the people that make up this list. so how can linuxsa
assist/lobby the education sector in promoting linux as an alternative to
microsoft ? 

thoughts ?

comments ?

flames ? &lt;ducks&gt; 



jason.
