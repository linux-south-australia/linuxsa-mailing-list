&gt; Hello Again Group.For the last say 48 hours I have been reading (something I
&gt; never do) a linux 6.0 administration guide. I have been reading security and
&gt; firewalling issue's I might accure. Some how I still cant determine how I
&gt; can affectivley lock my system down so no nasty little bitches get in.

Try the HOWTOs (<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A>). There are a few that deal
with firewalls and ipchains (either the firewall or ipchains - cant
remember which - HOWTO should be more than ample).

&gt; 
&gt; I am currently trying to use this command to log all inbound traffic on
&gt; wierd ports
&gt; 
&gt; /sbin/ipchains -A input -p tcp -y -l -d 192.168.1.1

This is a private IP address, traffic from the outside should never
touch this interface (well, without NAT at least). Instead of using -d
192.168.1.1, try something like (this will be in the man page somewhere)
-i ppp0.

&gt; but this only works on the internal network. I cant use the line -i ppp0 for
&gt; some reason It wont log the device. Any suggestions?

Perhaps there is noone making a connection from outside to the ppp0
interface on your machine.

&gt; Also I have recently seen ./hack.sh in the folder /dev/.lib/
&gt; Is this an exploit ? because it has happened on a few rh6 boxes of mine.

Quite probably. What's in /dev/.lib? I saw something like that once that
was a bunch of trojan binaries. You should really do a proper security
audit on your machines. Here's a quick list of things to try:

1	Turn off all unnecessary services in /etc/inetd.conf and restart
inetd. You could even turn off inetd (not a bad idea, unless you
specifically need it).
2	Turn off all unnecessary services in /etc/rc.d/rcX.d/. Where X is the
current runlevel. You can use the ntsysv tool for this on RH-based
systems.
3	Use a deny-by-default style firewall (this is in the HOWTO). I think I
e-mailed this before, but:

	#DENY by default
	ipchains -P input DENY
	#Allow our traffic
	ipchains -A input -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
	ipchains -A input -i lo -j ACCEPT
	#Allow access to a few services from the outside
	ipchains -A input -i ppp0 -p tcp -y --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
#We're a web server
	ipchains -A input -i ppp0 -p tcp -y --destination-port 25 -j ACCEPT
#and an SMTP server
	#also Allow us to respond to connections
	ipchains -A input -i ppp0 -p tcp ! -y -j ACCEPT

	It's not the best firewall in the world, but it's better than leaving
yourself unguarded.

4	Perhaps use something like tripwire next time you freshly install your
machine. Tripwire can help you to determine which files are changed and
even send you notification. This is documented elsewhere.

Hope it helps,
Matt
