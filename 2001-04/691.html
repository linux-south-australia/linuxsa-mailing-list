Hi.

As linux users, we don't _have_ to use MS, but think what OS you were
using 5 years ago, and why you changed.

It's interesting that Richard raised this topic immediately after his
DocBook vs Word question. It brings to mind the real reasons we should
choose software: Because it fills a need, and it is the best fit to the
job at hand. I don't like it one bit, but sometimes the answer falls on
the Microsoft side of the fence. If I have to make that decision, I make
it, but I keep a weather eye on the alternatives, because they are rising
rapidly and the next time I have to make the decision it could easily fall
the other way.

MS has a pervasive marketing style, but their software is it's biggest
enemy. No-one enjoys having to perform a virtual lobotomy so they can get
their mind around 'the Microsoft way', and get the bloody thing working.

I don't subscribe to the FUD theories where we all need to live in fear of
MS domination. It's just not required, they are already dominant. They
have/are/will kick and scream and attempt to out-manouver any competition
they perceive as a threat - that is their style, and is the reason only an
open and free system like Linux can succeed in their presence. They cannot
buy it, and they will have great difficulty closing it down. Likewise, I'm
not expecting Linux to close MS down any time soon. With a bit of luck, MS
products will genuinely improve with the comparisons to the capabilities
of free software. Win2k doesn't require rebooting anywhere near as much as
previous incarnations, I wonder why?

&gt; &gt; beleives it is, you shouldnt have to worry about microsoft. I would worry
&gt; &gt; more about showing people that it is better than dwelling over the fact that
&gt; &gt; microsoft are marketing their products well.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to shatter that false sense of security of yours, but the truth of
&gt; the matter is that it does.
&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft has an extremely talented Marketing and Sales team. They could
&gt; sell government employee's almost anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Linux, on the other hand doesn't really have one single body that spends
&gt; millions of dollars promoting Linux on all four corners of the earth.
&gt; 
&gt; Be affraid. Be very affraid.
