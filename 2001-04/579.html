Well, I'm not sure about how transparent it is, but we use Omniserves. 

The way we have it set up is this:


  machine a ---+
               |    /----- disk bank 1
            omniserv
               |    \----- disk bank 2
  machine b ---+


the omniserv has redundant power supplies, redundant scsi controllers,
and you connect a vt terminal to controll them.

We run sybase on machine a & b and sybase accesses the disk raw. so all
the mirroring is (i think) transparent. I think to sybase, there only
appears volumes, and I dont think that it worries about raid.

This way too, the machines a & b are redundant are sharing the disks.
This runs a real-time SCADA system (well, part of it - all the real-time
stuff is in shared memory, and the historical stuff is in sybase).

We had a disk fail, and popped it out, plonked in a new disk, and
rebuilt the mirror (all from the VT). At this time, there was no need to
tell sybase anything, and it continued to do what it needed to do.

They also come in a very cool black box, and look like they cost a bit.
