&gt; As linux users, we don't _have_ to use MS, but think what OS you were
&gt; using 5 years ago, and why you changed.

5 years ago, I was sitting on a worn out Compucon 386 writing 'programs'
in QBasic. I continued to use Windows boxes for the next 3 years until I
found out about Linux, and now spend most of my time in that
environment. I changed because 1) QBasic is crap :-(  2) Windows is even
more crap.

I had the choice. We all have the choice. Well spotted. The point that I
attempted to make in my previous message was that the majority of
computer users in this world aren't Linux people. Generally, the
GNU/Linux people have a different mindset and outlook on the issue of
monopolising corporate giants and software, and how it all relates to
life.

&gt; It's interesting that Richard raised this topic immediately after his
&gt; DocBook vs Word question. It brings to mind the real reasons we should
&gt; choose software: Because it fills a need, and it is the best fit to the
&gt; job at hand. I don't like it one bit, but sometimes the answer falls on
&gt; the Microsoft side of the fence. If I have to make that decision, I make
&gt; it, but I keep a weather eye on the alternatives, because they are rising
&gt; rapidly and the next time I have to make the decision it could easily fall
&gt; the other way.

I agree. However, I think that you'll always find a way to do things
without using Microsoft products. It's true that the Office suite is a
classy set of applications, but I can get along with out it. I'll use
StarOffice if I really have to.

&gt; MS has a pervasive marketing style, but their software is it's biggest
&gt; enemy. No-one enjoys having to perform a virtual lobotomy so they can get
&gt; their mind around 'the Microsoft way', and get the bloody thing working.

Too true. The majority of corporate IT Administration Staff can't be
bothered. They're probably MS Certified and as a result, go with what
they know and think to themselves "...I'm not going to get fired for
using Microsoft..". That always used to be the rule. It's changing, ever
so slowly.

&gt; I don't subscribe to the FUD theories where we all need to live in fear of
&gt; MS domination. It's just not required, they are already dominant. They
&gt; have/are/will kick and scream and attempt to out-manouver any competition
&gt; they perceive as a threat - that is their style, and is the reason only an
&gt; open and free system like Linux can succeed in their presence. They cannot
&gt; buy it, and they will have great difficulty closing it down. Likewise, I'm
&gt; not expecting Linux to close MS down any time soon. With a bit of luck, MS
&gt; products will genuinely improve with the comparisons to the capabilities
&gt; of free software. Win2k doesn't require rebooting anywhere near as much as
&gt; previous incarnations, I wonder why?

I wasn't suggesting that we live in fear of MS domination. I couldn't
give a damn about Microsoft's attempts to get there products into my
home/life. They'll have to drug me with some kind of Rhinoceros sedative
before I willingly use their software. That's my decision.

Ultimately, my point is that not everyone is as well informed as the
majority of people here. I think that we all agree that Microsoft's
products are not that flash. What you need to understand is that a lot
of people out there don't know this. They think that Microsoft is, in
the words of Richard Sharpe, "...the best thing since sliced bread."
