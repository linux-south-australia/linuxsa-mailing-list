&gt; Hi Greg,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Theoretically you could do it with 2, but then it would just be a slow
&gt;&gt; alternative to RAID-1.
&gt;
&gt; This setup would have no fault tolerance and therefore would no longer
&gt; fall under the definition of RAID 5...it would be RAID 0...stripe set
&gt; without parity.

No, a two disk RAID-5 would have one data block and one parity block
per band.  They would alternate on each band.

&gt;&gt; RAID-5 is an interesting alternative when you have large quantities of
&gt;&gt; data which is mainly read, such as web or ftp servers.  You'd really
&gt;&gt; want at least 5 drives in a volume, which would give you an overhead
&gt;&gt; of only 25% above the data stored, as compared with the 100% you
&gt;&gt; always have with RAID-1.
&gt;
&gt; The percentage of storage required for fault tolerance in RAID 5 is
&gt; 1/N (where N is the total number of HDD's)...in the above example
&gt; the overhead is 20%...

It's 1/(N - 1).  You'd have (conceptually) four data drives and one
parity drive.  In this example, if each drive held 10 GB, you'd have
40 GB of data, but you'd have 50 GB of storage.  That's 25% in my
book.
