Completely fair enough. We cannot expect you to give us a service and make a
loss on it. I'm sure there will be many applications where we will use
Internode's ADSL service either in our own sites or client sites as by the
looks of it, it seems to be a fantastic product ... but of course, before
they cut us off (or add a d/l limit) ... we'll continue to leach off telstra
for as long as we can ... only because we can ... (also as a constellation,
the numererous thousands of dollars I have dished out to telstra for
multiple phone bills, I feel like I'm finally getting my moneys worth with
them ;-) )

I think this topic has now been done to death, so it's time to move on  ...

Interesting.

Pity that this is economically un-sustainable, but I appreciate the thought
:)

The carrying capacity of a 1.5 mb/s link in one month is 474,000
megabytes. So that works out (ignoring fixed costs of the ADSL
service, which is probably ok for a first approximation) to be $0.002
per megabyte.

Sorry, but I can't do that. Stay with Telstra, rip them off, not me.

You _did_ say no caps - the above is what no caps means!

Of course, you didn't really - mean- 'no caps', just that you wanted
our cap to magically be large enough for your needs. Unfortunately
with the size of these firehoses, that's a huge, huge economic risk
for us.

Worse, as we've found in the past with other services, if we said
'unlimited' and tried to disconnect or excess charge those who we
felt were ripping us off, we'd wind up with people trying to take
legal action to stay connected and to keep leaching from us. The same
people who can't find a few hundred bucks per month to pay what it
really costs. Go figure.

The simple truth is that what you're describing relies on other light
users cross-subsidising your heavy access. That is a risk/benefit
issue. Nobody else in the ADSL market in Australia other than Telstra
is doing it. That's because nobody else has Telstra's almost zero
true internal cost to run the links (since they receive the income
from the analog line rental for voice and mandate that they receive
it in order to supply ADSL).

Primus had a crack at it. Primus, who are much much larger than we
are. They no longer do - even they couldn't stand the bleed rate. We
certainly can't.

&gt;... currently our $79 per month 512k telstra un-capped service using
Dyn-dns
&gt;to have a staic hostname is doing us for now ...
&gt;
&gt;We haven't even had it a month, and we have already exceeded the standard
&gt;Internode data limit 4 times over for a YEAR's access !

I can't help you with that. Keep ripping off Telstra. You might as
well run down some of their cash reserves, they're larger than ours.

Sincerely sorry I can't help you.

What we -can- help you with is 64k or 128k links with unlimited
downloads. We'll officially release the price points shortly, but
they're still going to be much higher than you will want to pay based
on your postings so far.

This is one of the problems with 'unlimited' everything - people
develop unreasonable expectations of what is fair to ask for as an
infinite benefit for a finite price. See the archives to see this
topic thrashed to death.

I would love to help you, but there is just no point in you running
us ragged, it doesn't help you or me.

Regards,
   Simon

&gt;
&gt;Hi List,
&gt;
&gt;I guess everyone has their own specific needs/wants regarding provision of
&gt;broadband services. And yes, I have my own too.
&gt;
&gt;I think Internode fall short in a couple of areas. (Sorry Simon)
&gt;
&gt;1. the allowance/cap is still too low it should be minimum of 1gb/month
&gt;2. The setup costs are fine
&gt;3. The monthly access should be no more than 80 it's more than BP now (I
&gt;understand the wholesale price issue)
&gt;
&gt;Consolation:
&gt;Telstra's data caps are stupid people will get pumped by more than 250 in a
&gt;month and their setup is ridiculous.
&gt;Primus are just as bad
&gt;
&gt;Oze are saying yeah yeah stay tuned
&gt;
&gt;So we wait for other alternatives.
&gt;
&gt;I guess in the end if I could get ADSL 256/64 for 200 install, 75/month,
&gt;without the cap or with a 1gb ALLOWANCE per month then it would not be an
&gt;issue I would sign up tomorrow. I know of people who are prepared to pay
&gt;200-300 a month for 1.5/1.5 MB with no caps.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry for the length of the post, but I think I am reasonable as the data
&gt;content is getting fatter and the allowances/caps are a REAL pain and
&gt;providers setup costs OUCH!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Evan
