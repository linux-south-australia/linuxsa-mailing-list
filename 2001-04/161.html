&gt; Unfortunately, Ximian do not support distributions that do not use RPM or
&gt; dpkg package management systems.  This means that users of Slackware are
&gt; unable to use Ximian in a natively packaged format - sure, one could use
&gt; rpm2tgz on the Red Hat 6.2 packages, or mv rpm to rpm.bin and then create
&gt; a script called rpm that runs rpm.bin with --force --nodeps, which would
&gt; even allow one to use the Ximian updater, but this is not a real solution,
&gt; and there is always a chance anomolies between RH6.2 and
&gt; Slackware.  Slackware-current is wholly glibc-2.2 based, so when that is
&gt; released as a stable version, there will be no similar supported system by
&gt; Ximian whose packages could be used.

That may be the case, but if you ask me they're doing a damn good job of
making GNOME available to the masses. You can't expect them to be able
to make everyone happy. It's just not possible. There's always going to
be someone running their own obscure UNIX setup that doesn't conform to
the 'standards'.
 
&gt; The problem, they say, is with dependancy checking - the Slackware package
&gt; system does not support it, so Ximian have no immidiate plans to support
&gt; Slackware.  This is not a problem, as one can just download the GNOME
&gt; tarballs (hence my need to find an Australian GNOME mirror site), or wait
&gt; for it to be packaged in Slackware.  I've read some posts in the
&gt; Slackware.com forums, one particularly by Pat V (the lead developer) that
&gt; states that there should not be a problem for Ximian in implementing
&gt; a Slackware distribution.  I'm not sure what this would require for
&gt; Ximian, so I am really in any position to state on this.  However, with
&gt; the advent of Red Carpet, things should become easier - as far as I am
&gt; aware (having not tried it yet) it deals with dependancies itself, so all
&gt; that would be required is some sort of (XML?) file or simple database that
&gt; tells the dependancies of the slackware Ximian GNOME packages, and Red
&gt; Carpet would look at this.  Probably far more is required, especially
&gt; concerning the updating of system packages.

I installed Ximian GNOME on a Sun E250 that had SunRays on it (Sun's
thin client solution). The installer downloaded and installed RPM
compiled for Solaris and put it in /opt/gnome. Basically it provided
package managemet for the GNOME gear. Maybe this will be an option for
them in the future for other distributions that don't natively use RPM.

&gt; It would be nice if Ximian released source tarballs of their modified
&gt; GNOME packages, so those on unsupported platforms would be able to
&gt; experience their improvements.

They do. It's called 'OpenSource'. There would be legal ramifications if
they chose not to. Admitadly the location of this code can be harder to
find when glancing over there website, but I assure you it does exist.
That's one of the main pillars of the OpenSource Development Ethic. You
share your ideas, improvements etc. with the rest of the community so
everyone can benefit.
