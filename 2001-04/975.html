I am beginning to wonder about the intelligence of some people here....

Most of this has been covered a-plenty earlier.

Caching - already done, factored in to the costs of most ISPs.
complaints about caps/limits/allowances - TANSTAAFL, get used to it. There's
lots of competition in the small-medium ISP market, so you can be assured
that margins are pretty low as they are.
Costs of IP addresses - Competition will ensure that they are
"competitive"...
setup costs - as above.

Remember that all businesses are there to make a profit. The only way you
can change what a business does is through legislation (as a last resort),
or with money. If the price you are willing to pay for the products and
services that you desire is sufficient to be profitable, you can bet that
there will be a business somewhere that will take it up (bear in mind that
"profitable" can be harder to acheive than you think when the market is
small). However, when someone already in business says "no, we don't want to
do that, as we don't think it will be profitable" (whether or not they
justify why they don't think it will be profitable) then that's fine. They
could be wrong, but hey -- it's _their_ business... If you want a business
to do that, set one up, put your money where your mouth is, and see if you
can make money from it.

People in general will make themselves look a lot less dumb if they refrain
from harping on about things that they don't understand... it's good to ask
a question, but when the question is answered, over and over again, and you
ask it again, you become known as an imbecile, and rightly so.

PS none of this is personal, but I may well point out that it's the same
people asking the same questions, making the same points, and continuing to
look stupid.
