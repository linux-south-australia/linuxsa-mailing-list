Hi Syahrul,
The Adelaide POPs are configured different that the rest of the country,
(go figure).
For problem determination, dial into the Sydney POP & see if your dialup
works.
If it does, action the changes recommended by iPrimus technical support.
Let me know how you go.

&gt; Dear Daryl,
&gt; 
&gt; You might want to use \n3 instead of \n2. v42 bis would be a better error
&gt; protocol to use if the modem is capable. The other thing to try is to turn
&gt; off the error protocol. When using s7=xx command it would be better to
&gt; extend the time period to 90sec. This command refers to the option in the
&gt; connection tab "cancel the call if not connected in xx seconds". I will also
&gt; look into the issue more to determine weather or not there is a error
&gt; protocol issue between the two locations.
&gt; 
&gt; suggested string.
&gt; at&fs37=15\n3
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this can be of some help.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; iPrimus Technical support.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; I'm currently in Adelaide & none of the following POPs work with my
&gt; Xircom CEM33 PC Card 33k6 modem:
&gt; 08-8423-0800
&gt; 08-8423-0807
&gt; 08-8423-0802
&gt; 
&gt; The Sydney POP works fine:
&gt; 02-9423-0800
&gt; 
&gt; All tests were done on the same telephone line.
&gt; 
&gt; However Sydney's POP is configured, should be duplicated in Adelaide.
&gt; The problem is the *modem* fails to negotiate, it never even gets to the
&gt; PAP stage. I suspect Adelaide's POPs are not configured for MNP reliable
&gt; mode, please advise.
&gt; 
&gt; TECHNICAL APPENDIX:
&gt; Xircom CEM33 PC Card 33k6 modem
&gt; Modem init string:
&gt; 1) at&f
&gt; 2) ats7=60l3m1x3w1\n2
&gt;  s7= Wait time for carrier
&gt;  l3= High Speaker Volume
&gt;  m1= Speaker On until Carrier
&gt;  x3= Basic Result Codes, Connect Speeds, Dialtone & Busy Detection
&gt;  w1= Progress Msgs use DTE speed
&gt; \n2= MNP reliable mode
&gt; 
&gt; Port speed:
&gt; 57600

&gt; hi
&gt; sorry for being to general. I'm trying to connect to iprimus modem dialup
&gt; connection..and it's unlimited Infinity account.
&gt; The problem is not to connect to iprimus, but to maintain the connection.
&gt; And secondly, the settings is quite different for windows and other o/s. E.g
&gt; for windows, you don't have to enter the dns detail, just leave it blank.
&gt; However, for Mac O/s or others, you have to enter the dns details. That's
&gt; not a problem for me. As I said before, the prob is more on maintaining the
&gt; connection (even a wizard can't help me with this). Once I get connected, if
&gt; I immediately check my hotmail or surfing whatever site, it will go
&gt; smoothly. BUT...after a while ( few minutes), it seems like your connection
&gt; just died. No activity, modem not blinking, pinging won't work, that's it.
&gt; This hasn't be a problem for windows. I'm reluctant to rely on windows for
&gt; the internet connection, but for the time being as it is more reliable that
&gt; way, i'll stick to it until I can solve the problem. I have used other isp
&gt; b4 primus, and it goes smoothly with linux, but not this time.
