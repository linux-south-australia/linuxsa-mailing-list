Oh dear!

&gt; Whoa back there Andrew. I think the guy was just saying that the Aussie
&gt; attitude towards the government (i.e., sometimes they really suck) is
&gt; refreshing.

I'd be inclined to say Andrew is correct. If I may quote Lord Ferrox
Tutinean, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&gt;RESPECTFULLY:
:)...I LOVE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE,...JUST look at you .
We Americans have a fascination with the ' down under wonder' and it
stems 
from the easy way you all have with ,...well...' telling it like it is ' 
even when it ' isn't '.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why do we need to shout respectfully? In addition, 'telling it like it
is' even when it ' isn't' is not true and it essentially brands all
Australian posters of (possibly) telling lies...

&gt; The deep and meaningful message is that history has shown that bad
&gt; descisions happen, and happen alot, and sometimes there is a lot
&gt; momentum behind them. Both financially and socially.

That was part of the message. It's possible he meant that "Australians
have a habit of getting sucked in by marketing" - which I would agree
with - but the way he wrote what he said doesn't say that clearly
enough.
