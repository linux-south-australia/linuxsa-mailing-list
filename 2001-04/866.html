* I have setup several POP3 email servers recently using RH7.0 and I am
* experiencing some strange behaviour with Outlook express.
* 
* On some w/s's the send/receive goes really quickly, on others 
* it will have a delay of about 3 sec and no errors and on my test 
* box here I found that when I rebooted the server the send/receive 
* was slow but after a few goes (read 3 or 4 ) it suddenly speed 
* up to the point I couldn't read the messages on the
* screen, which is about what I would expect across a LAN
* 
* I also have removed all the firewall rules so that has 
* nothing to do with it. There doesn't seem to be anything 
* consistent to point me in the right direction.
* Does anyone have any ideas.

Sounds like your hosts file needs to be updated. Try populating it with the
IP aaddresses and a name of the computers that are popping your server.
You'll find that the server does a lookup of each IP that it responds to,
and this may well be where the timeout is coming from.

/etc/hosts
