&gt;  &gt; 1) I think I've finally cracked a viable way to get into production
&gt;  &gt; for ADSL under the Internode banner. I hope to have something
&gt;  &gt; formally announced mid this week for deployment as of circa next
&gt;  &gt; week. Honest. Really. Sure. Yep :)
&gt;
&gt;sign me up! (err... but tell me the cost first... :)

Working on that :) Should look in the same ballpark as the 
alternatives, but with more features included. Real Soon Now :)

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; I would welcome comments on the above approach - would this work for
&gt;  &gt; people? I think it's fairer (lets you buy a cheaper DSL card for your
&gt;  &gt; linux box instead of a standalone box, or else lets you choose a
&gt;  &gt; niftier standalone box if _that_ is what you want... etc etc).
&gt;
&gt;would work for me, and probably most people on this list, but I get the
&gt;feeling that there's probably going to be a few less literate users out
&gt;there wanting fast connections, and they would benefit from having a
&gt;complete solution, rather than having to choose their connection equipment.
&gt;I'd suggest that you offer these people a complete solution -- either
&gt;directly or by referring them to consultants who onsell your service with
&gt;setup... But, as I say, it won't bother me or most on this list, only the
&gt;less educated users, which may not be part of your target market...

Its a good point - I didn't mean we'd disown configuration 
assistance, quite the opposite. Aim is to sell and support a specific 
set of hardware ourselves, buy it from us and we'll help you get it 
going. Don't buy it from us and we'll still do our best (but with no 
guarantees). So the answer to 'complete solution please' is 'yes'.

I'll also note that the way I'm planning to configure our services at 
this point (RFC 1483 bridging for those who find geek details 
interesting) means that practically 100% of DSL devices will work 
find 'out of the box', with no client software needed to be added 
(i.e. no PPPoE needed)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;exactly what I want...
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; More than 1 host can be accommodated by sharing that IP address -
&gt;  &gt; either by plugging it into a linux box running NAT (or proxy
&gt;  &gt; servers), or by buying a 'residential gateway' (that does the same
&gt;  &gt; thing), or (if you really want to) by getting &gt;1 static address from
&gt;  &gt; us, but at extra cost (cos these suckers are getting harder to get...)
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps when you set your prices for ADSL, you could include the per-IP
&gt;prices as a footnote...

Planning to - to charge an additional fee per month for &gt;1 fixed IP's 
included (probably the option of a total of 5, as an alternative to 
the included total of 1.

Those who are familiar with how to construct an IP subnet will 
appreciate why the next multiple after 1 customer IP is 5 customer 
IP's. Hint: reserved, broadcast, default router IP means 3 are taken 
up out of the subnet before customer IP's are allocated)

&gt;  &gt; PPPoE has two interesting problems:
&gt;  &gt; 	- needs support in your client system (sometimes costs $$$,
&gt;  &gt; always costs head-scratching)
&gt;  &gt; 	- has some issues with MTU (maximum transmission unit)
&gt;  &gt; problems which can be a hassle
&gt;  &gt; 	causing access problems on large data transfers until fixed.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The approach I'm chewing over now would avoid the above two issues
&gt;  &gt; and mean compatibility with anything that speaks TCP/IP over ethernet
&gt;  &gt; - anything at all.
&gt;
&gt;excellent -- what is the catch? Is it more expensive? Does it require more
&gt;expensive client premises equipment? More expensive ISP equipment? etc? I'd
&gt;prefer not to pay too much more for the above advantages (maybe 10% more,
&gt;but...)

Yep. The aim is for it to be as close to 'catch-less' as possible.

More expensive client equipment? Actually, no, quite the reverse - 
cheaper if anything.

What it does do is chew up real globablly routable IP addresses in a 
manner I don't like very much, but its looking like the most 
acceptable price to pay in the meantime. I have another way to do 
this in the future which chews a lot less external IP ranges to get 
you your single fixed IP, but that approach is still not viable yet 
(blocked on some Telstra stupidities that I've decided I can't wait 
any longer to have fixed - hence the new approach)

&gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; - Buy your own choice of DSL hardware (just like buying your own
&gt;  &gt; choice of modem today)
&gt;
&gt;suits me, but some may desire a complete solution.

s'ok, we do them :)

&gt;  &gt; - One, static, IP address is assigned to your service
&gt;
&gt;good (although some may not have any need for it...)

But here's the cool thing - a fixed IP never hurts :)

&gt;  &gt; - Generous included download limits (I'll straighten out a few
&gt;  &gt; options in the next day or so but the most likely base level is 1500
&gt;  &gt; Megabytes per month included)
&gt;
&gt;Hmm... Personally, I'm interested in ADSL for the always-on, static IP, and
&gt;high bandwidth when I need it. I would _rarely_ download 1.5G in a month...
&gt;hence, I'd prefer not to pay for unused Mb... Comparing with Telstra's
&gt;options, I think 1500Mb is huge... Could you perhaps offer 500Mb base as
&gt;well (perhaps with slightly more expensive per-Mb excess charges, like
&gt;mobile phone companies do?) Assuming the difference between the 500Mb and
&gt;1500Mb per month accounts is ~$0.15 * 1000, that's of the order of $150 per
&gt;month difference that would mean that I personally, couldn't afford to take
&gt;on ADSL... Unless you could afford to do this at the price you mentioned
&gt;previously (&lt;$100/month), which I doubt... :)

Here's the irony - some people feel that 1500 is huge, but others 
think the 250-500 included by Telstra in their plans is way too small.

I'm in favour of structuring things with a 1500 Mb cap but with out a 
huge financial penalty involved. The aim here is to let you have a 
'busy' month once in a while without an excess bill, not to have you 
download 1499 MB's per month. So its a trade - I don't charge you 
much different to Telstra but include a lot more MB's, and you are 
nice to me and don't deliberately rip me off, and we both win.

That's the theory, anyway.

&gt;  &gt; - No PPPoE software required
&gt;
&gt;simpler -&gt; better... suits me...

Yep!

&gt;
&gt;again, suits me -- however, I'd suggest that you ensure that you are able to
&gt;offer your customers a complete solution for whatever they need... Perhaps
&gt;just put a residential gateway on your options list...

Agreed. I think I might have found a good one, and it even seems to 
be made in Oz. I'm going to evaluate it later this week.

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; [*] This is the one I'm most interested in feedback on - it's the
&gt;  &gt; normal way that ISP's deliver ADSL (and its why there are so many
&gt;  &gt; 'residential gateway' products out there to address this for
&gt;  &gt; households with more than one ethernet host).
&gt;
&gt;IMHO, you just need to make it simple to move from one box to multiple boxes
&gt;with NAT to multiple boxes with Static IPs...

There'll be a fee for doing this because it involves reprovisioning 
stuff at the exchange, but it'll be perfectly do-able.
