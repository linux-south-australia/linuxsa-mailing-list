<H1>[OT] ADSL Modem hacking and network topology</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
&gt; ...and your modem is subsequently hacked...
&gt;
&gt; I'm sure everyone has seen this, but here it is anyway
&gt; <A HREF="http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/alcatel-bugs.html">http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/alcatel-bugs.html</A>

OK, having read that, I'm still not sure if I understand the danger fully.
From what I can see, an external attacker could:

* render the modem inoperational.
* capture/view/whatever ethernet traffic.

As long as there is a fix to the inoperational modem problem, and you have a
firewall between the modem and the rest of your machines, you're ok, right?

Also, one thing here confuses me -- does the ADSL modem have an IP Address?
To be honest, I expected it not to -- I thought that it would/could be
IP-invisible... ie: from the ethernet plugged in to my end of it, I see the
ISP's network, and from their end, they see my machine... I guess not, as
it's a router. So now my mental impression of it is as follows (at least in
my planned configuration):


(note that "int" always means on my side, and "ext" is on the internet's
side)

 My LAN (192.168.1.x)
         |
     hub/switch
         |
 My Gateway (int: 192.168.1.1)
         |  (ext: [1])
         |
   ADSL Modem/router (int: [2])
         |           (ext: [3])
         |
--------------------------------
      Phone network etc
--------------------------------
         |
    ISP Router (int: [4])
         |
     THE INTERNET



OK, I expected [1] to be my assigned IP address (whether dynamic or static),
[2] and [3] to be nothing, and [4] to be the ISP's router address, as per a
normal dialup connection.

However, now, I think [1] is my assigned IP address, [2] and [3] are the
same, being my router/gateway address, and 4 is the ISP's router address, as
per a normal dialup connection...

Hmm... I also think I'm a little confused... As Simon said earlier,
Internode, to give out one static IP, will use 4 real addresses... I guess
these are [1], [2,3], broadcast and reserved. yah? What about with a dynamic
scheme? how would one do that? I'd be expecting that there would be no
difference... Can you do this with only using 1 IP address?

What does this have to do with Linux? Nothing. hence the [OT]...
