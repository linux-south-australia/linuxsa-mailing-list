My turn to disagree :-)
I completed my windows2000 pro and server edition training as part of TAFE
skills updating. The instructor was fine and reasonably knowledgeable on MS
systems.  (although getting distributed file systems to work was a nightmare no
matter how many mouse clicks RSI on the finger claim coming ;-))

The first question asked prior to the class was, yup you guessed it 'who here
uses Linux?' Linux was mentioned at least 3-4 times during every session.
Comparisons were made and in most cases Linux could do it much quicker and more
reliably CL made it much quicker. Imagine his shock when he learned we had 148
machines with Mandrake running on them 6 redhat servers for student use and a
Linux cluster in development, and offered 'choice of OS in the drop in centre
for practical work. MS is certainly IMO not in as strong as a bargaining
position as it once was.

We are dropping MS Official Curriculum (MOC) and are seriously reviewing our
need to be an Official MS Training Partner.

And not to labour a point, the driving force is vision, sure MS is still
dominant but we not give up on that side of training, we will just make sure we
cater to all sides.  Asia is a particular interest for us, as an institute we
see opportunities for training middle level techies in management / systems /
networking and e-commerce strategies.
There is more but you get the drift I'm sure

This is not confidential (although we might get a visit if MS peeps read this)

Also I spend time overseas every year and if you think Linux is making headway
albeit slowly here Linux in Europe is simply mind boggling.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Although when you show them linux, they may sway their opinion. All
&gt; &gt; microsoft is doing is showing them their product - show the public our
&gt; &gt; product.
&gt;
&gt; I have to disagree... Microsoft is getting in at the top, forging agreements
&gt; that restrict choice, and generally using their financial clout to persuade
&gt; the decision-makers to choose Microsoft. Your MS rep is not just dropping by
&gt; to show you Windows ME/2000, Word and a few other things to see if you would
&gt; like to purchase them, they are agressively competing to win 100% of the
&gt; business available. They do this by making people think that there is no
&gt; alternative (well, that's one way they do this).
&gt;
&gt; Sure, showing them Linux will help, but many people are prejudiced against
&gt; Linux, or rather, towards Microsoft. Reasonably recently, I met my first
&gt; true MSoid. I thought real advocacy was only for OS's like Linux, MacOS,
&gt; OS/2, VMS and AmigaDOS. The also-rans and underdogs. The alternatives. But
&gt; apparently not, and I've been discovering that this is not just the MCSEs
&gt; that are like this, but the masses as well... It struck me as strange at the
&gt; time, but I guess that that's what to expect from such a marketing
&gt; machine...
