Andrew!

&gt;     I believe that this is just a simple config problem on
&gt; the server, but I don't have enough experience to track it
&gt; down. Where do I look to get some info on troubleshooting
&gt; (i.e. docs and logs, the docs I have don't shed any light
&gt; they say it should work fine)? I know I should be close
&gt; because the server and Laptop maintains the connection, but
&gt; which log should contain ping info etc. What logs and config
&gt; files do people need to help me troubleshoot? Can anyone
&gt; help?

Have you tried running:

* route -n (for a Linux system); or
* route print (for a Windows system)

On the laptop?

You could also see what tcpdump -n turns up (man tcpdump) during a
dial-in session.

&gt;     I am using RH7.0 for the server, and I have set up
&gt; mgetty on ttyS2 (I have 4 com ports, 1 for internet
&gt; connection and eventually 3 for dialins).

Hmmm....RedHat 7.0 is one of RedHat's maverick releases. I consider it a
beta for fisher (RedHat 7.1) myself although it is quite useable.

&gt; small business. The other problem I have is time. I need to
&gt; get this fixed ASAP as I leave for interstate in 7 days and
&gt; it MUST be working before then. Thanks all in advance for
&gt; any help you can offer

I don't think LinuxSA can help you with time. Maybe if you set your
clock with date -s (man date) you could pretend that time went backward
:-)
