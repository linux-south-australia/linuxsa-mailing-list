&gt;hi
&gt;sorry for being to general. I'm trying to connect to iprimus modem dialup 
&gt;connection..and it's unlimited Infinity account.
&gt;The problem is not to connect to iprimus, but to maintain the connection. 
&gt;And secondly, the settings is quite different for windows and other o/s. 
&gt;E.g for windows, you don't have to enter the dns detail, just leave it 
&gt;blank. However, for Mac O/s or others, you have to enter the dns details. 
&gt;That's not a problem for me. As I said before, the prob is more on 
&gt;maintaining the connection (even a wizard can't help me with this). Once I 
&gt;get connected, if I immediately check my hotmail or surfing whatever site, 
&gt;it will go smoothly. BUT...after a while ( few minutes), it seems like 
&gt;your connection just died. No activity, modem not blinking, pinging won't 
&gt;work, that's it. This hasn't be a problem for windows. I'm reluctant to 
&gt;rely on windows for the internet connection, but for the time being as it 
&gt;is more reliable that way, i'll stick to it until I can solve the problem. 
&gt;I have used other isp b4 primus, and it goes smoothly with linux, but not 
&gt;this time.


I had a very similar problem that was kindly resolved by someone on this 
list.  In my case, the modem commenced the handshake, but wouldn't stay 
connected after the handshake for more than some seconds (definately not 
minutes, as in your case).

As for the solution, in my case: once I had all the settings set, I had to 
also make sure that the gateway settings was set to:   0.0.0.0

That's all I needed to do, and it worked for me from there!

Cheers,

Peter
