&gt; Is it true that there is no driver for Australian-approved PCI DSL cards?
&gt;
&gt; If I understand Simon Hackett's recent flurry of posts about ADSL
&gt; correctly, Internode is seriously thinking of offering an IP over DSL
&gt; service to which any DSL equipment can be connected. There are many
&gt; options Simon mentioned, including some cheap embedded devices that do the
&gt; IP over DSL &lt;-&gt; IP over ethernet bit.
&gt;
&gt; Someone suggested that there aren't drivers. I don't know what to look
&gt; for, because I have never seen such a product.

ditto -- in fact, I don't really understand exactly what it is that I will
need...

My understanding is as follows:

          |
          | Outside phoneline (ADSL enabled)
          |
          ^ Passive frequency splitter
         / \
        /   \
       /     \
    normal    \
   phone(s)   ADSL "modem"
     etc


Two things confuse me:

 -- do I need to split the signal _before_ pluggin a phone in, and run one
line to my phone and one to my ADSL modem, or is the splitter part of the
modem itself (and if so, do I then need to plug my phone into my modem?)

 -- This "modem" could be effectively a PCI card that you plug your phone
line into, or a standalone box that takes ADSL signals on a phoneline and
puts out
TCP/IP on a piece of Cat5, or an integrated router/switch, where you can
plug many pieces of Cat5 in and do funky things with the ACLs as you would
with a normal router (or not, in the case of a switch (or hub) ) Is this
correct?


Hence, the only time I'd need linux drivers is if I have an internal PCI (or
ISA) ADSL modem card, right? If I use something more like a bridge, hub,
switch or router, then linux just thinks it's talking to a LAN, right?
Hence, I could have one linux machine being my externally visible server,
doing NAT and IP filtering for a small network, plugged onto the ADSL modem
and a hub/switch, yeah?

hmmm
