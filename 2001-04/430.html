Hi There!

That was a kernel panic. It means that the kernel that Mandrake was
loading to run the boot process found something it couldn't handle and
decided to crash. The 00's (et al) that appeared are a hexadecimal dump
of various registers and states that the kernel was in. If you don't
understand that last sentence, don't worry too much.

1) Does this computer behave oddly at all?

2) Try forcing the install into a text install and try to be more
specific about what kernel you're installing
 - last time I installed a Mandrake 7.2 you had to fiddle with alt keys
to throw out the graphical install and then work out how to get a text
one

3) Try installing from a floppy install disk
 - it's possible (but highly unlikely) that the kernel image on your CD
is very slightly stuffed
 - you could try downloading this image from the Internet

4) Look up "AMD K6-2 Mandrake panic" at <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A>

5) Make sure you don't have any shared IRQ's

On the panic note, my system (a RedHat 6.2 system) says it's going to
check partitions just after your system crashes. Your system's swapper
process seems to cark it; that might give a clue to someone else...

DSL

p.s.

I understand you probably don't have a sane working Linux/Open Source
O/S running at the moment, but Microsoft Outlook Express 5.50.4133.2400
formatted your message in such a way that my mail reader (Netscape 4.75
for Linux) was wholly unable to render it and I had to scroll three
screens to the right to actually work out what you were saying was wrong
:-(
