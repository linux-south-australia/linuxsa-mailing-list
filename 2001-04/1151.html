&gt; Warning Will Robinson!!!
&gt; HTML at 9 o'clock ... run!
&gt; It landed in a M$ outlook express manifestation, as usual.

Really nice job of responding to his email their Don, makes me remember why
I'm on this list: For the really good help that is provided by people who
have more knowledge than myself.

If you aren't going to reply to his mail, just ignore the damn thing. All
you're message did was use up more bandwidth without providing anything
useful at all! Besides which, you aren't David Lloyd: It's his job on the
list to respond to HTML email. At least he has the decency to actually
respond to their email as best as he can with his knowledge.

On the other hand, Wayne, could you please turn off your HTML email, as
there are members on the list who don't like it and you will get a much
better reaction without the HTML crap getting in the way. You're using
Outlook Express 5, so go to the 'Tools' menu and then down to to 'Options',
click on the 'Send' tab. About 2/3 of the way down, you will see 'Mail
Sending Format', please choose 'Plain Text'. Ta.

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a proxy server which is also running dns. This box serves two
&gt; &gt; class C's, being 203.87.18  and also 203.38.167  . At random
&gt; &gt; intervals, sometimes hours and other times days or weeks later, I get
&gt; &gt; the following messages in /var/log/messages. As you would expect from
&gt; &gt; reading the following messages, bind stops responding but sits as a
&gt; &gt; process, and other times kills itself off. Other than the messages
&gt; &gt; below I don't get anything else to indicate a problem.

Bind will give the those error messages when you have more than one copy of
it running. The first copy of bind that is running will probably be ok, the
second (and subsequent) copies will not be able to get sole access to the
DNS port, because the first copy of bind has it, so it stops listening on
that interface.

The output you can see below is the copy of bind running as process 71302
telling you that it can't connect to the port numbers on those IP addresses,
so it is stopping listing.

&gt; &gt; Could someone please shed some light on how to fix this problem, or
&gt; &gt; what I need to look into ?

First off, you need to find out if there is indeed another copy of bind
running, try:

ps aux | grep bind

See how many copies you get. If there are indeed more than one running, you
need to try and shut them all down, and then start one up, as you only need
one running. If there is not more than one running, get back to me and I'll
try to help you out a bit more.

Now, as to why you have more than one running, there could be a number of
reasons, did you manually start bind without checking to see if it was
already running? Do you have a cron job that is starting it up? Do you have
a script or cron job that is meant to restart it, but for whatever reason it
doesn't kill it off properly? Hopefully those couple of ideas will get you
thinking about it a bit.

I really recommend the book "DNS and Bind" published by O'Rielly. (Actually,
I recommend any book that is published by O'Rielly, all of the ones that I
have seen/own are brilliant). I have the second edition and I don't think I
would dare touch my nameservers without it on hand.
