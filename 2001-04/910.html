&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One thing I want to do "one day" is precisely this, but with approprately
&gt; &gt; easy to use front end on it.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you started work on it? I would be interested to see what ideas you
&gt; had.

No its in the one day box.

I guess it would end up somethign like e-smith is eventaully supposed to
end up as.
Eg database driven, web interface, hopefully extensible.

I wanted to do this before I heard of e-smith.

I havent had a chance to investigate e-smith or do it myself as yet.

Like I say one day.

&gt; 
&gt; But you could make it less of a lie. I strongly believe that you could
&gt; set up a linux network (servers and workstations) that would require far
&gt; less administration than their Windows counterpart.
&gt; 

Probably.
I also happen to beleve that if you invested tiem you could probably make
a reasonably robust windows system.

What I find ahrd to understand inthis thread is why people are willing to
overlook the vast effort most school staff have arleady put into learning
winodows to some extent(for whatvevre reasons)and alrgely at their own
expense in their own time (and in many cases because they felt they were
forced to), and then think it would be reasonable to expect them to make
the same effort with what  is arguably a more complex sytstem, when they
would largely see  little or no practical (as oppsoed to idealogical)
benefit,and in some areas, notably applications would probably lose
benefit.

It really seems to me taht peopel are ignoring practical issues and
reality as it is as aoppose to how we might like it to be.
