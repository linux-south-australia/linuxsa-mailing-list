&gt; I think, perhaps incorrectly, that the question you are asking is: "in a
&gt; closed environment requiring no editable document exchange with people or
&gt; computers external to the project, is Word a reliable development
&gt; platform?"
&gt; 
&gt; I think the answer is "yes". I also think that such environments are
&gt; relatively rare, and I doubt that you have one :-)

Actually, I think the answer is no. The environment I worked in was a
single user, me, collating documents written by others and me.

All the documents had been written using Word's auto-formatting
features. I feel that word managed to screw itself over mostly by
itself. Honestly. Apart from the origional source from other Word
documents, I was the only editor.

I simply tried to copy everything from one document onto the end of the
other. Each document represented a seperate chapter. It should have been
as easy as that. All the numbering should have auto-magically adjusted.

It worked once, then screwed up, and could not be fixed. The numbering
was screwed.

I had to go through and cut and paste each individual section of text by
hand seperately.

Now, this was probably a case of Word from different computers of
something, which matches your "computers external to the project"
criterion. However, all the computers ran the same version of Word, and
this in-compatibility is just not on.
