Hi folks,

After reading a lot of hype how Linux would never be part of the general
communities preferred OS and that it was for nerds and geeks etc etc and
that windoze was so easy to install and use blah blah blah...I thought my
recent experience with a complete hard drive crash may be of interest to
some of the other linux newbies, and not so newbies, out there.  

The story so far...After years of putting up with the M$hite, our intrepid
adventurer decides to travel to the land of the penguin to see what all the
fuss is about.  After many harrowing episodes, too gruesome to recall, our
weary traveller finally climbs his way to the top of Steep Learning Curve.
Yes folks, that dreaded mountain so feared by the M$laves who lament that
tackling this climb is foolhardy and unnecessary as the great god Gate$ has
provided ease of use and Plug&Play for all his loyal drones.

There, at the foot of Tux, our battered traveller takes a deep breath and
rests.  Confident in the thought that Gate$ and M$hite are safely locked
away in dual boot land our convert decides to explore this new land
inhabited by the great magician Mandrake.  Ahh, but the Black Prince of the
Dark Partition, he who sports the feared Blue Screen of Death as his emblem,
hasn't given up easily, no not by a mega byte.  Lurking in the shadows, near
the mystical region known as the MBR, where the Keeper of The Gate known
generally as LiLo or, more amusingly, The Grub, resides the Black Prince,
aided by his cunning right hand man General Command Failure, wait for their
opportunity to strike.

Without warning, during the ceremonial ritual that is the reinstall of a new
OS, disaster strikes.  Somehow the Black Prince and his god Gate$ smash
through the MBR spewing their evil bytes and corrupting all that stand in
their way.  The Keeper of The Gate, despite his most valiant efforts cannot
sustain the fight and his land is over run by their most insidious weapon
that is the Reformat Monster  (eeekkk and shrieek).

Within minutes, all that was good lay in tatters before our bemused
traveller.  LiLo, or the Grub, has been defeated, the MBR has mysteriously
vanished and all was lost.   As news of the visit of the Reformat Monster
spread, how our poor traveller was castigated and  bludgeoned by his once
loyal family.  "You lost how much of my work?" and "All my precious windoze
work is gone, oh how could you".  Suddenly, the spectre of the Great Divorce
descended upon our ever valiant explorer.   Nothing for it he muses, and
looking down at his feet he sees that his shoes have come undone, time for a
complete and proper new boot strapping.

And so it was to be.  Well folks all that to tell you that after a complete
disk failure and the need to reinstall absolutely everything, I found that
the M$hite wasn't as smooth sailing as it is made out to be.  Without going
into all the specifics the windoze reinstall was a real pain in the
proverbial.  I had to search the net for a new set of drivers for my video
card (while working in a max of 16 colors and 640X480 mode).  Plug&Play
failed to properly recognise my Sony Monitor and configuring my modem was
also a pain as I couldn't find the original driver disk.  My printer also
could not be loaded and another search of the net for appropriate drivers.
Some programs that had been backed up did not go over properly and I had to
beg some software to replace some stuff that was lost and could not be
recognised by M$hite.  The full restore etc and getting some stuff back
(bugga all really) took the better part of a week!!! This was totally
unbelievable. 

A reinstall of MDK 7.2 took about 40 minutes, with a further 2 hours
downloading some programs (via a 56K modem) I was up and running in one
evening. No drivers to find or replace everything was recognised perfectly
and my video card magically set at 1028X740.  Only my stoopid printer, which
is a dinosaur Lexmark doesn't work (but then again it never has).  Now try
and tell me that M$hite is for the masses and I'll tell you that is all a
total load of M$hite.  So hang in there newbie types I think it is well
worth the effort and the stuff I learnt along the way is truly eye opening.

Cheers
your weary traveller.
