&gt;&gt; The next AUUG-SA meeting is planned for tomorrow, 11 April 2001.  As
&gt;&gt; stated, we were planning to elect a committee then.  Unfortunately, we
&gt;&gt; don't have enough nominations for the committee.  We're left with the
&gt;&gt; choice between getting more nominations by tomorrow, having the
&gt;&gt; meeting without the election, or postponing the meeting.  I'd welcome
&gt;&gt; feedback on which we should do.
&gt;
&gt; Invite nominations on the night, including self-nomination (aka
&gt; volunteering).

Yes, we'll do that too.  But there seems little point in having an
election if we can't guarantee enough candidates.

&gt;&gt; Regarding the venue, as stated we would meet for dinner at a
&gt;&gt; restaurant.  We have identified a number of restaurants with a
&gt;&gt; separate room potentially suitable for such meetings.  We plan that,
&gt;&gt; once we have identified such a restaurant, that we would meet there
&gt;&gt; every month.  I'd like some feedback on your opinion of the following
&gt;&gt; restaurants.  Other nominations are also welcome.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;      House of Chow (Chinese)
&gt;&gt;      Iridori, Rundle St. (Japanese)
&gt;&gt;      Ming's Palace (Chinese, not sure about the facilities)
&gt;&gt;      Marcellina in Hindley St. (Italian)
&gt;
&gt; I'd vote for Marcellina.   Location is central, food is not highly
&gt; expensive, and Italian food seems to offer more variety than many other
&gt; types (pizza, different pastas, different fillings, different costs,
&gt; etc. )

OK.  That's the best description we've had so far.

&gt; Our meeting tonight is 7:00 @ Tellurian, Hackney?

No.  If we have it, it'll be at the restaurant.
