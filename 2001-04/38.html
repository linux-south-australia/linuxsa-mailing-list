&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone out there had to overcome this little problem before: We
&gt; have just aquired a bundle of IBM DCHS-34550-04F (4.5GB 50-pin SEF
&gt; SCSI ) drives in an old HP disk array, and I am trying to make use
&gt; of them individually for a bunch of SPARC Classic's (Running RH6.2)
&gt; that we use as low-end webservers for small clients.
&gt;
&gt; They are detected as drives perfectly (in Linux bootup and even if I
&gt; "Stop+A" to the ROM and do a "probe-scsi-all") The problem is that
&gt; they refuse to talk to the system on the grounds that have 520 Byte
&gt; sectors (during bootup it reports this just before refusing to
&gt; reference it to /dev/sdX )
&gt;
&gt; I have been scouring various pages/archives online (IBM being the
&gt; least helpful so far), but so far all I can find is a handful of
&gt; other people with the exact same drive/problem EXCEPT that they are
&gt; all running Solaris and the only suggestions they got were to
&gt; low-level format them with "sformat" (Which is AFAIK just for
&gt; Solaris....well there is lots of stuff at the homepage about how you
&gt; might port it yourself but it is not within my range of talents I'm
&gt; afraid).
&gt;
&gt; The irony of having these SUN boxes running RH but needing a Solaris
&gt; program is not much comfort :-\ And even if I did, and ran sformat,
&gt; is this the solution or just the only known kludge for it???
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, any help/advice/experience with this would be greatly
&gt; appreciated!!

I've had this problem before.  On FreeBSD, there are some incantations
to do this.  To quote an earlier message,

&gt; Yup, there's some other way to change it.  Set the current values,
&gt; then immediately issue a format command:
&gt; 
&gt;   # camcontrol cmd da1 -v -c "15 10 0 0 v:i1 0" 12 -o 12 "0 0 0 8  0 0:i3 0 v:i3" 512
&gt;   # camcontrol cmd -n da -u 1 -v -t 7200 -c "4 0 0 0 0 0"
&gt;   # camcontrol modepage da1 -m 3
&gt;   Tracks per Zone:  19
&gt;   Alternate Sectors per Zone:  12
&gt;   Alternate Tracks per Zone:  0
&gt;   Alternate Tracks per Logical Unit:  38
&gt;   Sectors per Track:  84
&gt;   Data Bytes per Physical Sector:  512
&gt;   Interleave:  1
&gt;   Track Skew Factor:  13
&gt;   Cylinder Skew Factor:  22
&gt;   SSEC:  0
&gt;   HSEC:  1
&gt;   RMB:  0
&gt;   SURF:  0

'camcontrol cmd' issues direct SCSI commands to the drive (here
/dev/da1, the second SCSI drive).  I don't know whether or what
program under Linux would do the same thing.  I can give you the
camcontrol man pages to aid with the translation if you like.
