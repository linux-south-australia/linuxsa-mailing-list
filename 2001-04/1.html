&gt; &gt; I have just become the proud owner of a nice shiny 1Ghz Tbird on an
&gt; &gt; ASUS
&gt; &gt; A7V.
&gt; 
&gt; discussed issues aside, how have you found this combination? I am contemplating
&gt; purchasing these soon.
&gt; 
&gt; was the board easy to set up? has the chip being running very hot?
&gt; 
&gt; cheers

At first I did have problems with the chip running too hot (CPU 78C just
viewing bios screen!!!)
but that was because the tech in the shop not only put the wrong
heatsink and fan on it but also 
had the voltages on the MB set incorrectly!!! (AND the HDD light was
plugged in to the wrong spot AND,
the SDRAM was running at 100Mhz instead of 133Mhz AND LBA mode was not
set up properly SHEESH!!!!!!!!!!)

Since I complained everything is working fine. :-) ( It took 4 trips to
the shop and 2 weeks though)

The CPU now stays around 56C all the time even when being thrashed.
The A7V is VERY easy to set up. I just didn't have the time myself on
account of all my work and getting married next weekend. Have a look at
the manual for it, ASUS has it on their site as a 100 page PDF document. 
I downloaded it and got it bound before I got the PC so I could see the
full specs

SiSoft SANDRA 2001 is showing more MIPS under Win2k than a P4 1.5Ghz
machine !!!!!

Just to make sure it stays cool I have a full tower case with 10 fans in
it in the following places

1 on CPU (Global Win 6700 RPM)
1 on VIA motherboard chipset
1 on graphics card
1 in power supply (like I could take it out ;-)
3 in rack removable HDD
3 in 5 1/4in bay cooler


Of course this makes it all a bit noisy but it's well worth it. 
Mandrake absolutely flys!!

After my experience I would thoroughly recommend a Athlon and ASUS A7V
combo
Make sure you check the techs work and fan speeds in the BIOS when you
get it home though 
if not building it yourself :-(
