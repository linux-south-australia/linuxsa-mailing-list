&gt; &gt;&gt; Note also that RAID-1 is a lot more expensive than RAID-5: you can
&gt; &gt;&gt; need up to nearly twice the disk space.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't you need at least 3 disks to do raid-5? 
&gt; 
&gt; Theoretically you could do it with 2, but then it would just be a slow
&gt; alternative to RAID-1.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If reliability is more important than disk space, raid-1 is going to
&gt; &gt; be cheaper, or at least easier to install into a standard PC
&gt; &gt; case.
&gt; 
&gt; Recall that RAID-5 will tolerate a disk failure.  You seldom have two
&gt; at once.

Hmm. Yes, but that is no advantage over raid1. It still survives the
failure of a single drive. Both raid1 and 5 are stuffed when the second
drive catches fire. (believe me I know...)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; More drives also equate to more heat, greater complexity, and more
&gt; &gt; power consumption.
&gt; 
&gt; And more storage space :-)

Sure, but I thought we started this looking at a 2x 12gb mirrored array.
If we want more space, we could throw in a 5x 30gb raid5 and pick up
100+gb, but that might be overkill...

&gt; 
&gt; RAID-5 is an interesting alternative when you have large quantities of
&gt; data which is mainly read, such as web or ftp servers.  You'd really
&gt; want at least 5 drives in a volume, which would give you an overhead
&gt; of only 25% above the data stored, as compared with the 100% you
&gt; always have with RAID-1.

Is raid5 good at rw? I've seen it and raid5e on a couple of database
servers recently..
