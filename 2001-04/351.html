Hey All,

I'd nearly finished writing this email a second ago until my CVS version
of Evolution decided to crash and kill my unsaved message. &lt;Bashes head
against wall&gt; It's been one of those days :-(

Anyway, maybe I can summarize my original email to make it clearer and
more clean-cut.

I'm currently working on a project that requires me to produce a 'Quick
Restore' CD, similar to the CDs provided with some Compaq servers. I'm
currently looking at RedHat's KickStart as a way of doing this.

One issue that came up is regarding ethernet interfaces on the box in
question. It has 5 3Com 10/100 PCI cards, each attached to different
networks/VLANS/jellybeans. Each have their own IP addresses, one with 70
aliases.

Can I be assured that, if I leave the cards in the same physical slots
that they are in now, the addresses and kernel device assigned to each
card will be the same?

Diagram follows to explain my question in more detail.

Currently...

+------+------+------+------+------+
| Card | Card | Card | Card | Card |
|  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |
|      |      |      |      |      |
| eth0 | eth1 | eth2 | eth3 | eth4 |
|      |      |      |      |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
+------+------+------+------+------+
  |      |      |      |      |
  |      |      |      |      +------------ LAN 4 (172.16.1.1)
  |      |      |      +------------------- LAN 3 (192.168.1.1)
  |      |      +-------------------------- LAN 2 (192.168.0.1)
  |      +--------------------------------- LAN 1 (10.0.0.1)
  +---------------------------------------- LAN 0 (203.1.1.1)


If I reinstall using KickStart, can I be assured that I won't get
something like this happening:

+------+------+------+------+------+
| Card | Card | Card | Card | Card |
|  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |
|      |      |      |      |      |
| eth4 | eth3 | eth2 | eth1 | eth0 |
|      |      |      |      |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
|      |      |      |      |      |
+------+------+------+------+------+
  |      |      |      |      |
  |      |      |      |      +------------ LAN 4 (172.16.1.1)
  |      |      |      +------------------- LAN 3 (192.168.1.1)
  |      |      +-------------------------- LAN 2 (192.168.0.1)
  |      +--------------------------------- LAN 1 (10.0.0.1)
  +---------------------------------------- LAN 0 (203.1.1.1)

   (A reshuffle of the kernel device names for each card)

If a reshuffle happened, connectivity would almost certainly be lost. I
don't really want that to happen.

Will Linux call the devices the same name each time it see's them? Is
this to do with the order they are placed on the board? Will Linux do
something annoying causing me to do more of this: &lt;bangs head against
wall&gt;? I dearly hope that it doesn't.

Any comments are welcomed.

   -Andrew
