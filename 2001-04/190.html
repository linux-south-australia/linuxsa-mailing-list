<H1>Modem on ttyS3 problem.</H1>

Hi All,
    I finally managed, with a little help from my (Linux)
friends, to get my number 1 dialin working after discovering
the Linux side of things was perfect, but Bill Gates end
hadn't actually changed to the correct configuration, even
though the cross check said it had. The "Wizard" must have
been more like Sauron than Gandalf me thinks. How that
company makes any money at all is beyond me sometimes.
Anyhow to the next problem.

    At present I have a RH 7.0 Box happily serving the net
for a small Windoze network. The Internet connection is
through ppp0 on ttyS1. The number 1 dialin is set up and
working on ppp1 on ttyS2. What I am trying to do now is set
up the number 2 dialin as ppp2 on ttyS3. The problem is that
even though setserial advises that the ttyS* ports are there
and configured correctly, and the Linux side of things are
set up (ie mgetty etc. it was almost identical setup to the
dialin 1 config), I cannot 'find' the third modem when I use
any terminal programs like minicom or wvdial. Also the modem
doesn't pick up the incoming call and pass it on to mgetty.

    I think that the not seeing the 3rd modem is the problem
here, but I don't know what to do to fix it. The modem
detects the incoming call (the Ring Indicator light comes
on). I think that because the system cannot see the modem
connected to the port it also isn't picking up the Ring
signal from the modem and so isn't firing up mgetty and
subsequently pppd.

    The usual method of checking for a modem is to send an
init string to the port and if it receives an OK signal
back, then there is a modem connected to that line. Is there
anything people can suggest to help here? Are there any
other methods of checking serial ports for modems? Are there
any other ways to initialise (or send any data) to a modem?
Thanks in advance.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
