&gt; Hi James,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am trying to setup freesco on a 486 with limited resources (8mb ram
&gt; &gt;&gt; 120
&gt; &gt;&gt; mb hdd 1.44 and 1 cnet650 ISA card) and ABC 56k modem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;i found FreeSCO too limited, why not cut down a debian or redhat install?
&gt; YMMV.
&gt; Limited in what way?
&gt; And how do I cut down RH say to run on this miserly piece of hardware?
&gt; And how what do I configure? (points would be great)
&gt; I need NAT, firewall and on demand dialup with obvious telnet session in
&gt; case. to run in 8mb and 120 mb of disk.

120MB of disk is cutting things a bit too fine I think. RedHat 7.1
without *any* extra packages selected is still over 150MB (surprisingly
less than some earlier versions). Depending on how long you've been
playing with Linux and how much spare time you have, you might be
interested in building your own Linux From Scratch (can't remember the
URL). You could also modify a tiny linux distribution (there's craploads
of them about). I quite like LEM (found at
<A HREF="http://www.linux-embedded.com/">http://www.linux-embedded.com/</A>).

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Am I doing something obviously wrong?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;yes, not trying another network card. usually this is the first thing to try.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; All ISA cards (MOBO has no PCI slots) I have are cnet bar 1 which is 3com
&gt; etherlink3 I could give that a go. But he'd get pissed no
&gt; digimon/dragonballz online for him till I sort this out. :)

Using another CNET card wouldn't be a bad idea. If it works, you know
you're configuration was good, but the card was bad. If it doesn't work,
you're non the wiser. I haven't looked at FreeSCO, but if you do have
problems, it might be worth looking at the Linux Router Project
(<A HREF="http://www.linux-router.org/">http://www.linux-router.org/</A>). It's very easy to configure.

Matt
