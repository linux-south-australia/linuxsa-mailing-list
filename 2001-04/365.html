hi
sorry for being to general. I'm trying to connect to iprimus modem dialup 
connection..and it's unlimited Infinity account.
The problem is not to connect to iprimus, but to maintain the connection. 
And secondly, the settings is quite different for windows and other o/s. E.g 
for windows, you don't have to enter the dns detail, just leave it blank. 
However, for Mac O/s or others, you have to enter the dns details. That's 
not a problem for me. As I said before, the prob is more on maintaining the 
connection (even a wizard can't help me with this). Once I get connected, if 
I immediately check my hotmail or surfing whatever site, it will go 
smoothly. BUT...after a while ( few minutes), it seems like your connection 
just died. No activity, modem not blinking, pinging won't work, that's it. 
This hasn't be a problem for windows. I'm reluctant to rely on windows for 
the internet connection, but for the time being as it is more reliable that 
way, i'll stick to it until I can solve the problem. I have used other isp 
b4 primus, and it goes smoothly with linux, but not this time.
