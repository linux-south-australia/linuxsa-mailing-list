&gt;&gt;&gt; Neither. Believe what you like regarding M$. Install a good Hardware
&gt;&gt;&gt; Raid card and M$ will never know about it. The OS only sees the
&gt;&gt;&gt; logical volume created in hardware. The MSCE guide must be talking
&gt;&gt;&gt; about software raid?
&gt;
&gt; "MS will never know about it"? I wish it was possible to get such a thing
&gt; such that no OS knew about it, ie transparent RAID that appears to be like
&gt; a single SCSI drive of a very common type with a well-debugged driver.
&gt; I've seen such things many years ago and there's a Macintosh here
&gt; somewhere with an Adaptec card that does just this. It seems strange that
&gt; someone hasn't done this for ATA drives because there is pretty much just
&gt; one driver set for all ATA drives, thus meaning the market is potentially
&gt; quite large.
&gt;
&gt; But I've had no success finding a modern version of this, everything wants
&gt; its own special drivers, and they always seem to sneak in some
&gt; RAID-controlling features to the driver which is exactly what I don't
&gt; want.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone had better success at finding transparent hardware RAID than
&gt; me?

There are SCSI-based RAID cards.  They connect to the SCSI bus, not
the PCI bus, and they have the advantages that you're looking for.
They also have the disadvantage of the SCSI bus bottleneck, which is
why you normally don't see them.
