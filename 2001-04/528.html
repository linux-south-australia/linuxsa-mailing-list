&gt; Hi Greg,
&gt;
&gt; I made the following comments today regarding RAID 5...
&gt;
&gt; [1] RAID 5 requires a minimum of 3 HDD's
&gt;
&gt; This is certainly the case with M$ products, and I assumed (possibly
&gt; wrongly) that Linux would be the same.

Agreed.  What I said was that the algorithms still work if you only
have two drives.  I don't know what Linux does.  Here's the Vinum code
which enforces the 3 subdisk minimum:

  /*
   * Check that our subdisks make sense.  For
   * striped plexes, we need at least two
   * subdisks, and for RAID-4 and RAID-5 plexes we
   * need at least three subdisks.  In each case
   * they must all be the same size.
   */
  if (plex-&gt;organization == plex_striped)
    {
    data_sds = plex-&gt;subdisks;
    required_sds = 2;
    }
  else if (isparity (plex))				    /* RAID 4 or 5 */
    {
    data_sds = plex-&gt;subdisks - 1;
    required_sds = 3;
    }
  else
    required_sds = 0;
  if (required_sds &gt; 0)					    /* striped, RAID-4 or RAID-5 */
    {
    if (plex-&gt;subdisks &lt; required_sds)
      {
      log (LOG_ERR,
	   "vinum: plex %s does not have at least %d subdisks\n",
	   plex-&gt;name,
	   required_sds );
      state = plex_faulty;
      }

&gt; You then mention that "Vinum" also has the 3 HDD restriction and
&gt; that I am confusing what makes sense with what is possible. That's
&gt; fine...as I previously mentioned ...I will concede that you are
&gt; right because of your greater Linux knowledge...but can you tell me
&gt; what command or utility I can use in Linux to create a RAID 5 setup
&gt; with 2 HDD's (if I can't use Vinum).

No, sorry, I don't know the Linux tools.

&gt; [3] RAID 5 has better read performance than RAID 1
&gt;
&gt; You have sent me several emails debating this comment...yet when
&gt; asked simply if RAID 1 is faster than RAID 5 when reading, writing,
&gt; or both ...you answer writing...I never said this wasn't the
&gt; case. It should be obvious to you why now I am a little
&gt; confused. Please set me straight...

Well, I did give you a number of URLs and a man page quotation.  A lot
depends on how you use the volume: performance characteristics for
swap will probably be different than for a file system.  For a file
system which isn't completely empty, you'll spread the accesses
relatively uniformly across the entire address space, modulo some
potential conflicts between stripe size and cylinder group size.  This
means that you end up with the read bandwidth of 2 * N drives, where N
is the number of drives corresponding to the volume size.  With
RAID-5, you also have the read bandwidth of all drives, but in this
case it's N + 1, not 2 * N, so performance is not as good.
