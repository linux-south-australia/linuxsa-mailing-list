&gt; &gt;Telstra do have an unlimited account (subject to AUP). Thats what i'll
&gt; &gt;probably get getting. I told them I download a lot of... err.. linux
&gt; &gt;distribution isos, and that with ozemail I can get 150hours @ 56k with
&gt; &gt;gives a theoretical limit of 3.9gb per month for $35, and they said that
&gt; &gt;would be fine under the AUP. They also said you get a warning first, so
&gt; &gt;you can go mental and see what happens :)
&gt; 
&gt; Can you direct me to where it says unlimited?
&gt; AUP has knocked off more people I know of (MP3 heads not s/w pirates)
&gt; because they did 1.5 gb in a day.

freedom standard & deluxe plans.

&gt; &gt;I'd go the 3 month contract ($400 inital fee, the only reason I dont
&gt; &gt;have it yet), then $89 per month after that for 512k down 128k up.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you consider 400 reasonable setup?

Not at all! We have a 1.5mbit adsl connection with linux here at work,
and all the installer did was plug the box in. Then as soon as he left I
removed the win2000 machine (which he told me "click next, next, next,
finish") and re-did it myself again with linux. $400 for pluging in a
box (and filters if you have voice on the line) is not fair at all. But
where are the other options (with unlimited throughput?) Im not in
support of them at all. But what choice do I have? :(

&gt; I think the power is/should be in the consumer buy your own modem or not
&gt; subscribe for reasonable term or not at a fair price. That way if their
&gt; service sucks you can kiss them goodbye and move to another provider. (btw:
&gt; Internode's setup cost is ok)

thats why I want the $400 install. Its a 3 month contract (most
expensive install) but when the contract is over the price per month
drops by $10 per month. I have been really happy with ozemails
reliability and speed for about 3 years, so I'm _hoping_ they have an
unlimited plan on adsl, which i'll swap to straight away when it comes
out.
 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My point to telstra exactly. Problem is the people you can talk to agree
&gt; &gt;with you, and those that make these stupid rules are stashed in an
&gt; &gt;office somewhere where you cant get em :(
&gt; &gt;
&gt; True and I am sure the 'senior ppl' have got unlimtied ADSL as part of
&gt; their perks.

Yep. grrr...
