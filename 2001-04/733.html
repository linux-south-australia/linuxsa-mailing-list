Stephen and Richard!

&gt; Using doc_book is not easy as you would have discovered by now especially with
&gt; the CVS controls, its probably a bit of a handful.

Actuallly, writing DocBook isn't too difficult. It's no more difficult
than writing HTML, however because it doesn't come "pre-packaged" with a
page formatter it can be difficult to render.

As far as CVS controls are concerned, CVS is difficult to use if you
don't know how to use CVS. I can't see what's so difficult with:

* I have now produced "Document A"
* I will now commit and tag this as "A-FIRST-DOCUMENT"

And then three months later saying:

* I want to get "Document A"
* I will now upload from CVS with "A-FIRST-DOCUMENT" tag

Maybe it's because I've used CVS when writing DocBook documentation that
I find it natural and easy.

&gt; Using word (supplied and
&gt; sponsored by Satan :-)) will IMHO be easier to use but still not easy.  

Actually, I've written some documentation in Microsoft Word. It was an
instruction manual for a piece of software. As you've noticed, it is
easier to use but it has disadvantages as well. Let's list some:

1) It requires a licenced version

If you want the "school leaver" to write your document in word, and you
are a business, it would be safest to have them do it under a licenced
version. Whilst Microsoft is unlikely to notice that you've created some
documentation using a pirated version, if they do you're in trouble.

2) Proprietary format

Microsoft have been known to change formats mid-stream (to force people
to upgrade products). Whilst you could always use an older version of MS
Word to do your work in, it looks like Richard wants the latest
features. Furthermore, the same document sourced under SGML or XML
hasn't got half as much bloat in it.

&gt; If you
&gt; take Lyx as an example of a document processor rather than a word processor you
&gt; can start to gauge just how much time and effort go into maintaining a 'word'
&gt; based document, eg style layout, section footers and so on.  Word does not make
&gt; it easy or pretty, its time and energy spent formatting that could be better
&gt; spent on content.

That is an excellent point. To change the look of a Microsoft Word
document you can attempt to autoformat it (1) or do other weird things
with the document. To change the look of an SGML/XML based document you
specify a different stylesheet, render it and out it goes.

&gt; Personally I think Lyx is by far the best tool to use for large documents bar
&gt; none.

If you are writing from scratch, LyX can be quite reasonable, however
the versions I've seen don't support DocBook. In addition, if the
document already pre-exists I'm not sure how well LyX handles an import.
Given that it's a graphical environment, it would - in my opinion - be
slower to point and click the various DocBook tags than to just type
them in.

The main problems with DocBook are:

* getting the structure correct
 - it's very difficult to get the tags matching and no errors regardless
of what tool you use

* adding the markup
 - there is a lot of markup
 - some of this can be automated but the automation tools don't exist so
one ends up writing them one's self

* school leavers and maybe even University/Tafe students don't know
about it
 - they may know how to use DreamWeaver/FrontPage or PageMill but what's
markup?

Benefits include:

* based on a W3C/Oasis-Open open standard
 - SGML appears to be maintained by Oasis-Open in a collaborative
fashion
 - XML is a W3C Recommendation (I think - it's definitely getting there)

* interchangable stylesheets
 - whilst it takes some knowledge to adjust the stylesheets, this
feature is very useful
 - stylesheets for DocBook already exist (Norm Walsh's modular sheets,
the Linux Documentation Project have created some and so forth)

* obvious tree-like model
 - you can fiddle with SGML/XML programatically, moreso XML
 - that is to say, if you wanted to create a quiz or whatever, you could
actually splice questions into the XML and have it rendered (or not
rendered at all) depending on various settings and so forth

I could go on...
