Indeed there are. Lucent just happen to be one card that I've used and
been fairly impressed with. Don't get me wrong, I know the Lucent gear
has a lot of problems, particularly as you buy their more 'advanced'
(read: over priced, under powered) equipment.

I've had no end of trouble with the Lucent gear that we use. If I was to
setup the link again, I'd build a custom Linux Wireless Router (LWR's a
nice acronym :-) rather than use the AMD 486-based equipment that Lucent
put in their ROR and COR.

&gt; &gt; Maybe you've been lucky or something. I'd stay away from them
&gt; &gt; personally. Get the Lucent gear from Integrity Data.
&gt; 
&gt; *chuckle* I've often heard "Integrity Data" referred to as
&gt; "Lack Of".

&lt;grin&gt;. I agree. I merely mentioned them as a point of contact that I
know sells said equipment. Whether they actually know what they're doing
is another matter entirely :-)
