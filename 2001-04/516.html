&gt;  &gt; Is it true that there is no driver for Australian-approved PCI DSL cards?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; If I understand Simon Hackett's recent flurry of posts about ADSL
&gt;  &gt; correctly, Internode is seriously thinking of offering an IP over DSL
&gt;  &gt; service to which any DSL equipment can be connected. There are many
&gt;  &gt; options Simon mentioned, including some cheap embedded devices that do the
&gt;  &gt; IP over DSL &lt;-&gt; IP over ethernet bit.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Someone suggested that there aren't drivers. I don't know what to look
&gt;  &gt; for, because I have never seen such a product.

Any DSL equipment approved by Tel$tra to plug into their copper lines 
and DSLAM's in the exchanges.

There is a list, it's at

<A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl/equipmnt.htm">http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl/equipmnt.htm</A>

Telstra themselves rent you the Alcatel SpeedTouch Home (which is 
perfectly fine, but I felt that giving our customers more freedom of 
choice would be preferably - hence, you can buy anything on that 
list, and on its future additions, and plug it in to talk to our ADSL 
service)

So the only caveat with these alledged cheap devices is getting them 
approved - see the compliance information at the bottom of the page 
noted above.

&gt;ditto -- in fact, I don't really understand exactly what it is that I will
&gt;need...
&gt;
&gt;My understanding is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;           |
&gt;           | Outside phoneline (ADSL enabled)
&gt;           |
&gt;           ^ Passive frequency splitter
&gt;          / \
&gt;         /   \
&gt;        /     \
&gt;     normal    \
&gt;    phone(s)   ADSL "modem"
&gt;      etc
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Two things confuse me:
&gt;
&gt;  -- do I need to split the signal _before_ pluggin a phone in, and run one
&gt;line to my phone and one to my ADSL modem, or is the splitter part of the
&gt;modem itself (and if so, do I then need to plug my phone into my modem?)

The ADSL device plugs direct into the ADSL enabled phone line with no 
filter in the path (it's a filter, not a splitter).

All other devices in your house on the same line need to have a 
filter 'in-line' between the incoming line and those devices. That 
means one filter behind each phone/fax/answering machine, *or* one 
filter behind a bunch of them on a set of double adaptors - either is 
fine, just as long as the path between the non-ADSL devices and the 
exchange has a filter in it.

The filters are just bandpass audio filters as far as I can tell. 
They aren't very expensive (circa $20).

You can also get them installed 'into' your house at the entry point 
in used by Telstra, filtering all of the other sockets in your house, 
providing you (again) plug the ADSL device in 'ahead' of that filter 
(i.e it needs a new socket 'drawn out' for it in this situation).

All I've done in my house for my ADSL service is plonked a filter in 
just underneath each phone - they are about the size of a matchbox 
and simply are rj11 in, rj11 out.

So the corrected form of your diagram is:

&gt;           |
&gt;           | Outside phoneline (ADSL enabled)
&gt;           |
&gt;           |
&gt;          / \
&gt;         /   \
&gt;        *     \
&gt;     normal    \
&gt;    phone(s)   ADSL "modem"
&gt;      etc

Where '*" means 'inline filter inserted in the phone cable between 
the phone and the wall'


&gt;  -- This "modem" could be effectively a PCI card that you plug your phone
&gt;line into, or a standalone box that takes ADSL signals on a phoneline and
&gt;puts out
&gt;TCP/IP on a piece of Cat5, or an integrated router/switch, where you can
&gt;plug many pieces of Cat5 in and do funky things with the ACLs as you would
&gt;with a normal router (or not, in the case of a switch (or hub) ) Is this
&gt;correct?

Yes, this is correct.


What we're releasing on Monday is an ADSL service which speaks 
RFC1483 IP bridging, so any ADSL device that supports it (hint: they 
all do) is fine.  This is the service that underlies the PPPoE 
complexities that Telstra drop on your head. We decided to remove a 
layer.

The standalone ethernet device is literally an ADSL to ethernet 
bridge. The Alcatel SpeedTouch Home is a common example of such a 
device in Australia at this time, but there are others (see the list 
noted above).

We have people plugged into our service (configured for its intended 
release mode) using the SpeedTouch Home and using an Alcatel PCI ADSL 
card in a windows PC, amongst other configurations.

[To those on the list who are running our beta service - yes I know 
that uses PPPoE, we're going to go back and simplify your setups too 
:)]

&gt;
&gt;Hence, the only time I'd need linux drivers is if I have an internal PCI (or
&gt;ISA) ADSL modem card, right? If I use something more like a bridge, hub,
&gt;switch or router, then linux just thinks it's talking to a LAN, right?
&gt;Hence, I could have one linux machine being my externally visible server,
&gt;doing NAT and IP filtering for a small network, plugged onto the ADSL modem
&gt;and a hub/switch, yeah?

Yes, again, entirely correct.

The ethernet bridge is a great option because as you suggest, it just 
plugs into -anything- that speaks standard TCP/IP over ethernet. At 
my place, that means two macintoshes. It absolutely includes linux 
machines (and, of course, we'll explicitly support Linux and FreeBSD 
users via Ethernet ADSL bridges on our service :) )

So the only (ahem) 'driver' for using a PCI card is saving a few 
dollarrs (they are indeed cheaper), but the offset is needing to find 
a card that has a working linux driver (we haven't found an approved 
one yet, but we're continuing to look - and I expect that a Linux 
driver for the Alcatel PCI ADSL card will pop up sometime).

Yes, the configuration where you have one 'outside' ethernet card 
talking to the ADSL ethernet bridge, and then an 'inside' ethernet 
card talking to your other machines, so your linux box is a combined 
firewall/proxy/NAT device for the rest of your network is a 
supported, normal, and expected configuration.

For those (not on _this_ list!) who don't want to configure a linux 
box as their gateway, we'll be selling a 'residential gateway' that 
does those same functions in a little modem-sized chunk of hardware, 
for about A$495. Free choice, we don't mind a bit how do you do it.

The third option is having us allocate multiple fixed, externally 
visible IP's - which can also be arranged. But in security terms, 
putting your linux box 'in the way' (or a residential gateway box) is 
often preferable.


&gt;hmmm
