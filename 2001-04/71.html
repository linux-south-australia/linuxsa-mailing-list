Here's a minor saga in getting some basic things working
on SuSE 7.1. I'm just trying to get this thing to do
some firewalling and some web serving.
(They _are_ compatible, and in fact, it's difficult to do
otherwise if you use the iptables REDIRECT thing to
do your virtual hosting, which is my wont.)

1.	I install SuSE 7.1 on a vanilla AMD K-2/500 box.
2.	I port my old ipfwadm script to iptables.
3.	I think I'd like to use my old favourite
	text editor to speed things up (ludwig),
	which needs p2c (to convert pascal to C) to
	compile. So....
4.	I install p2c off the distribution disks, and
	add a couple of other things off the disks
	while I'm at it, including maybe some Apache modules.
5.	The firewall script (492 lines including comments)
	is ready to go and be tested with the Apache server.
	But....
6.	The server isn't running any more.
	So I try 
	    cd /etc/rc.d
	    ./apache start
	and get:

Starting httpd [ SuSEHelp SSL PHP3 mod_perl contrib backhand ]
see /var/log/httpd/rcapache.log for details

	and the file /var/log/httpd/rcapache.log contains:

Syntax error on line 199 of /etc/httpd/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so into server: shared object not open

	and the file /etc/httpd/httpd.conf near line 199 contains:

     198 &lt;IfDefine PHP&gt;
     199 LoadModule php3_module /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so
     200 &lt;/IfDefine&gt;
     201 &lt;IfDefine PHP4&gt;
     202 LoadModule php4_module /usr/lib/apache/libphp4.so
     203 &lt;/IfDefine&gt;         

	and so forth. And the file /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so
	seems to exist:

-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      1556196 Jan 26 04:12 /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so

------------------------------------------------------------
Problems:
-	No way is that line

LoadModule php3_module /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so
	
	a syntax error. I've spent a few hours looking at this
	line, and I cannot believe it is a syntax error.
	It is not a syntax error in any of the other 
	Apache configuration files I use, nor was it a syntax
	error 24 hours ago.

-	Secondly, I have no idea what the second error line means:

Cannot load /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so into server: shared object not open

	Despite deep meditation and optimal breathing, and despite a 
	reasonable night's sleep on it, I just can't understand it.
	Nor can I find documentation of it in the standard
	documents.

------------------------------------------------------------
Question:

Does anyone know what that error line really means?

Cannot load /usr/lib/apache/libphp3.so into server: shared object not open

The "ld" manual doesn't seem to clarify it.
The file is clearly readable.

And I can't see how any change I made could have upset Apache.

If I can't figure this out by rational analysis, I'm going to have to just
install all of Apache, PHP, PostgreSQL etc. etc. from source, and hope
that it works after that. But I'd prefer a rational-analytical approach.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. The Apache version is:

Server version: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)  (SuSE/Linux)
Server built:   Jan 19 2001 14:00:47
