Hi.

It is true that there is very little available for Linux in the lower
primary education area. There is a wealth of stuff available for the
incumbent OS's. It would probably be a reasonably large school that would
be looking at 100 anything PC's ?

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Most schools on average have more than 100 pcs, especially secondary
&gt; &gt; schools. Normally I see schools spending more than $1000 on pcs, or if they
&gt; &gt; are, well then it warrants the need to have a full time admin to be fixing
&gt; &gt; it all the time.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Schools that I've worked at in the past have had up to $130,000 IT budget
&gt; &gt; ... that in some cases has been for the price including a full time
&gt; &gt; administrator ... but of course if an INTELLIGENT network/workstation
&gt; 
&gt; Well I suspect they were unusual.
&gt; I dont think you will find that is the case with most state primary
&gt; schools, particularly in areas where good IT is needed most, ie in areas
&gt; where kids dont have PCs at home and their parents cant afford computer
&gt; levies etc that some schools use to gain extra funds.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; solution was implemented the need for a full time admin would not be there
&gt; &gt; in most schools.
&gt; 
&gt; No not a full time admin but a full time IT person, whose duties would
&gt; not be solely limted to admining the systems/network.
