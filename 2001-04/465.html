Hmm.  That's not what I read from the (FreeBSD) Aviator man page:

     -i iface -p port type
                 Set the port type for a specified interface.  The legal val-
                 ues for port type are 0 (ad-hoc mode) and 1 (infrastructure)
                 mode.  In ad-hoc mode, the station can communicate directly
                 with any other stations within direct radio range (provided
                 that they are also operating in ad-hoc mode). In inrastruc-
                 ture mode, hosts must associate with a service set controlled
                 by an access point, that relays traffic between end stations.
                 The default setting is 0 (ad-hoc mode).

                 When in ad-hoc mode the station will create a BSS with the
                 network name specified by the -n option if it cannot find an
                 existing network of that name on the currently configured
                 hopset (see the -f option.)

...

     -i iface -f hopset
                 Set the radio hopset of a given interface.  The hopset should
                 be specified as a country code as shown in the table below.
                 The hopset varies both the number of RF channels and their
                 frequencies and is dependent on radio regulations specified
                 by regional authorities.


                       Hopset ID     Country
                       1             USA
                       2             Europe
                       3             Japan
                       4             Korea
                       5             Spain
                       6             France
                       7             Israel
                       8             Australia
                       9             Japan Test

                 Whilst the card can be programmed to work with any hopset it
                 makes sense to use the hopset for your own region to avoid
                 interference from and interfering with other users of the RF
                 spectrum (in places like France this is the military.)

                 Note that all stations must be set to the same hopset in or-
                 der to communicate.

It's not clear that the hop set is the same thing as the hop pattern,
but it seems to indicate that the network name is based only on the
hop set.  I also suspect that this is one of the reasons that our
interoperability tests between Linux and FreeBSD in January were
unsuccessful.
