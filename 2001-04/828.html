 &gt; Generally I think the pricing is reasonable, but $20/month for four
 &gt; (additional) IP addresses?  $5/month *each*?

Firstly:  Don't fall into the trap of thinking that IP addresses are
a cheap and plentiful resource.  They aren't.

Secondly:  Most of the residential gateways on the market include NAT
functionality.  The option of additional addresses is for the (hopefully
rare) circumstances where NAT isn't suitable.

Also note that we're already burning a whole pile of addresses to get
to you:  Due to total and complete synapse failure on the part of the
designers of Telstra's wholesale ADSL offering, each single-IP address
customer requires us to allocate a /30 subnet (i.e., four addresses).
Part of the delay in launching this product was associated with trying
to work out how to deliver a simple non-PPPoE way of delivering a fixed
IP adress without needing to do that, but in the end we've concluded
that the design of the Telstra wholesale service is so farqued that
it's impossible to do something that simple.  It must have been difficult
for them to design a service with a hard-coded limitation like that, but
somehow they've achieved it.  Amazing.

Sigh.

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
