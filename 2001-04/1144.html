Simon,
I forgot to add to my previous post. I think it unlikely any SA gamers
would seriously consider any long termish dialup solutions they are madly
saving for ADSL and anything short of that I doubt they would be interested
in.

A USER friendly/centric service I guess would be good but isnt it too
idealistic and probably not worth the effort.

&gt;Ok, so here's a question for y'all on this topic (which has morphed 
&gt;back into into how to access local ISP resources equitably for you 
&gt;and your ISP, without, hopefully, too many arguments about the bill 
&gt;or how it was calculated)
&gt;
&gt;I'm chewing over creating a new sort of dialup account here @ 
&gt;Internode, which was actually oriented towards supporting online 
&gt;gaming, but would also address the issue of accessing lots of 
&gt;Internet news as well.
&gt;
&gt;The account would be approximately like this:
&gt;
&gt;- $24.95 per month
&gt;- unlimited time
&gt;- unlimited downloads (yes, really), from LIMITED SOURCES (read on):
&gt;
&gt;- full internet/web/etc access to any 'local' web servers (in our 
&gt;customer base, or attached to SAIX member ISP's customer bases)
&gt;
&gt;- access filters applied so that downloads are only permitted from 
&gt;local-to-Internode and SAIX-connected sources
&gt;
&gt;- full access to email (but only via the Internode mail server)
&gt;
&gt;- full access to our news server (which has a completely loony amount 
&gt;of content on it, fed from multiple happy satellite sources)
&gt;
&gt;- full access to our games servers
&gt;
&gt;- blocked access to any content other than the above.  Try to surf 
&gt;outside of those boundaries, and it won't work. Try to use any other 
&gt;IP ports outside of those boundaries and it won't work.
&gt;
&gt;- dynamic IP address (only, no static option)
&gt;
&gt;- idle timer (probably fairly low - maybe 30 mins)
&gt;- session hard limit (probably something like 6 hours)
&gt;
&gt;- special indial number to use this account, available Adelaide area 
&gt;and  Willunga/Fleurieu only (so far) - i.e. places where we have 
&gt;broadband private links back to Adelaide, as we install them - next 
&gt;likely area would be Barossa Valley
&gt;
&gt;- option for full Internet access by dialling our *standard* numbers, 
&gt;but with *all* access (over a nominal/token included 50 Mb per month) 
&gt;charged at $0.18/Mb. So if you really need that external thing in a 
&gt;pinch, either pay-as-you-go downloads, or use some other ISP account 
&gt;you might have lurking for that need anyway
&gt;
&gt;- Acceptable Use Policy covering deliberate attempts to rip us off 
&gt;(such as port bouncing to other Internet links and ftp-by-mail 
&gt;software to do huge external downloads through our long suffering 
&gt;mail server)
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;My target here was game players (playing on either our game servers 
&gt;or any other servers attached to SAIX), but it also works equally 
&gt;well for news server downloading.
&gt;
&gt;Would anyone go for the above? Is it a useful thing to offer?
&gt;
&gt;What it *does* offer you is the opportunity to create 'self service' 
&gt;local download optimisation.
&gt;
&gt;What it boils down to is this:
&gt;
&gt;	- dial one number, get local only for $0 per Mb
&gt;	- dial another number, get everything for $0.18/Mb.
&gt;
&gt;So this is yet another opportunity for you to influence our product 
&gt;development :)
&gt;
&gt;The above popped into my head a few weeks ago as one way to offer a 
&gt;reward for local access that was not subject to argument - i.e. on 
&gt;the special indial number, if you can get it at all, we definitely 
&gt;won't charge you for it - so there is no need to be worried, just try 
&gt;it - if it works, it's $0 per Mb. If it doesn't, then it isn't (and 
&gt;you can dial our main numbers to pay $0.18 /Mb to get it)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;   Simon

&gt;&gt;Actually - news downloads can often blow my usage sky
&gt;&gt;high.  I would be mor than happy with a local
&gt;&gt;'un-metered' news service.  Just downloading 1,000 new
&gt;&gt;headers and then message bodies (if I want to run a
&gt;&gt;search) can be huge.  And then there are the binary
&gt;&gt;groups for me to use should I need them.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; The list goes on.  I don't think it is a hundred
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; individuals going sick that is the problem - it is
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; often 100 individuals downloading similar material
&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; at some point which could have been stored locally.
&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt;Sadly, Linux users who need to download ISO's are very much in the
&gt;&gt;  &gt;minority of ISP users.
&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt;Also, caching big files doesn't scale very well, unless you've got a
&gt;&gt;  &gt;sort of file sharing and mirroring service. Since the majority of big
&gt;&gt;  &gt;downloaders are after 3 things (porn, mp3s, and warez), no ISP in this
&gt;&gt;  &gt;country can safely offer a content distribution service for such items.
&gt;&gt;  &gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt;Maybe someone can negotiate you an all-you-can-eat rate for usenet news,
&gt;&gt;  &gt;which would let you continue downloading indefinately without adding a
&gt;&gt;  &gt;lot of cost to the ISP side of things if they already have a full
&gt;&gt;  &gt;newsfeed. Maybe you don't want news, but content only becomes valuable
&gt;&gt;  &gt;when someone wants it :)
