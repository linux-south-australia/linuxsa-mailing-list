&gt; Given that this will be used in your absence, and there is a _risk_ that

&gt; something to 'discover' what is attached to each network card before they

&gt; first card with it's expected addressing, and then checks that it is so -
&gt; (ping or whatever to another box on the network) If that fails, drop the
&gt; config and try the next config until all cards are mapped.

The people that this is for a far from idiots, they're just not UNIX
people. Point taken, however :-)

&gt; It might help idiot proof the machine too, if it was part of the boot
&gt; process rather than the build process. What happens if someone switches a
&gt; couple of the net cables on the box?

If someone swaps the network cables on this box they deserve to have
problems, as far as I'm concerned. This is our Firewall/Proxy server.
Without it, my world comes crashing down around me (sad, isn't it?). I
have no pitty whatsoever for anyone that cannot even be bothered
checking _labled_ cables which are mapped to _labeled_ NICs.

I'll consider that as an option, but it's not too much of a concern in
this particular case. Thanks for your suggestions, though. They are much
appreciated.
