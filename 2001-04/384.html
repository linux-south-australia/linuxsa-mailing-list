&gt; &gt; now machine1 is to run www,ns,mail, etc... machine2 is to act as a 
&gt;firewall
&gt; &gt; and is to dial the isp.
&gt;Should machine 1 be accessable by someone from the outside world via
&gt;machine 2?

YES

&gt;Am I to understand that you want machine2 to act soley as a router and
&gt;have all the services running on machine1?

YES, but machine1 needs to route traffice from the LAN to machine2

ie. LAN&lt;-&gt;machine1&lt;-&gt;machine2&lt;-&gt;INTERNET
&gt;
&gt; &gt; what I have working so far is that a machine in the LAN is 203.4.5.5,
&gt; &gt; eth0 on machine1 is 203.4.5.1, eth1 on machine1 is 203.4.5.2, eth0 on
&gt; &gt; machine2 is 203.4.5.3 and ppp0 is a totally different subnet from the
&gt; &gt; service provider. now the problem that I am having seems to be with the
&gt; &gt; routing, after fiddling around the only way that I could work out to 
&gt;make
&gt; &gt; machine1 route properly was to do this
&gt;Are you attempting to get the LAN to access the Internet through ppp0 on
&gt;machine 2?

YES

&gt;If so, you should be using NAT (or masquerading) to do this.
&gt;You should be protecting your LAN from direct access to the Internet
&gt;(having their own live IPs is bad practise generally) and only have the
&gt;one IP (which will be assigned to ppp0 on machine 2).

I have reasons for doing it this way...


&gt;Adjust the addresses/ports for your setup.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.1 eth0
&gt; &gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.2 eth1
&gt; &gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.3 eth1
&gt; &gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.4 eth0
&gt; &gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.5 eth0
&gt; &gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.6 eth0
&gt; &gt; and so on because the rest of the machines on the lan are using the rest 
&gt;of
&gt; &gt; this subnet, ie. the only two addresses which are associated with eth1 
&gt;are
&gt; &gt; 203.4.5.2 and .3 because .3 is machine2. Now is there an easier way to 
&gt;do
&gt; &gt; this with route???

?
?
&gt; &gt; the other problem that I am having is that in this present configuration 
&gt;I
&gt; &gt; can get all machines to see each other properly however machine1 and the 
&gt;lan
&gt; &gt; cannot get through to the internet, they know that the GW is 203.4.5.3 
&gt;but
&gt; &gt; they can only get that far, it is as if 203.4.5.3 does not have a route 
&gt;back
&gt; &gt; to 203.4.5.2 so how do I do this???? machine2(203.4.5.3) can see the net 
&gt;and
&gt; &gt; works fine.
&gt;This is probably related to the machine 2 (the firewall) not being
&gt;configured to forward packets. Use the above IPChains command to
&gt;masquerade the traffic. You may also need to do this first to turn on IP
&gt;forwarding:
&gt;
&gt;echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

I am pretty sure that I have done this already...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; on a separate note I am having trouble with ssh connecting from server 
&gt;to
&gt; &gt; server across the net. When I try to connect I get a message like 'bad
&gt; &gt; packet length 795178083' and on the server that I am trying to connect 
&gt;to I
&gt; &gt; get /etc/ssh/primes does not exist. This only happens when I try to 
&gt;connect
&gt; &gt; from linux to linux if I use putty and connect from windows-linux the
&gt; &gt; connection works fine.
&gt;Have you tried SSHing with debugging?
&gt;
&gt;ssh <A HREF="mailto:user@x.x.x.x">user@x.x.x.x</A> -v

YES, it does not reveal anything extra it still gives the same result.

Thanx

Regards,

Michael
