&gt; Why are we looking at American DSL companies?  I feel
&gt; sad now that we can not have that sort of service
&gt; here.  The 500mb limit is still not reasonable for me.

Telstra do have an unlimited account (subject to AUP). Thats what i'll
probably get getting. I told them I download a lot of... err.. linux
distribution isos, and that with ozemail I can get 150hours @ 56k with
gives a theoretical limit of 3.9gb per month for $35, and they said that
would be fine under the AUP. They also said you get a warning first, so
you can go mental and see what happens :) 

I'd go the 3 month contract ($400 inital fee, the only reason I dont
have it yet), then $89 per month after that for 512k down 128k up.
 
&gt; I know this is owing to factors not within Internodes
&gt; control - but the fact is the DSL is still not
&gt; usefull for many people.  I can exceed that limit
&gt; easily with just a dial-up connection.

My point to telstra exactly. Problem is the people you can talk to agree
with you, and those that make these stupid rules are stashed in an
office somewhere where you cant get em :(
