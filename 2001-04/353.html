Hi.

Are you using kickstart and installing from a vanilla RH install source?
If so, I would have to ask why.

My impression of kickstart is that it will give you identical installs,
but there will still be some configuration per install to complete the
job?

Would it not be better to archive the currently working system to bootable
cdr? I'm sure I have seen packages on freshmeat to do this.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'd nearly finished writing this email a second ago until my CVS version
&gt; of Evolution decided to crash and kill my unsaved message. &lt;Bashes head
&gt; against wall&gt; It's been one of those days :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, maybe I can summarize my original email to make it clearer and
&gt; more clean-cut.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently working on a project that requires me to produce a 'Quick
&gt; Restore' CD, similar to the CDs provided with some Compaq servers. I'm
&gt; currently looking at RedHat's KickStart as a way of doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; One issue that came up is regarding ethernet interfaces on the box in
&gt; question. It has 5 3Com 10/100 PCI cards, each attached to different
&gt; networks/VLANS/jellybeans. Each have their own IP addresses, one with 70
&gt; aliases.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I be assured that, if I leave the cards in the same physical slots
&gt; that they are in now, the addresses and kernel device assigned to each
&gt; card will be the same?
&gt; 
&gt; Diagram follows to explain my question in more detail.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently...
&gt; 
&gt; +------+------+------+------+------+
&gt; | Card | Card | Card | Card | Card |
&gt; |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; | eth0 | eth1 | eth2 | eth3 | eth4 |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; +------+------+------+------+------+
&gt;   |      |      |      |      |
&gt;   |      |      |      |      +------------ LAN 4 (172.16.1.1)
&gt;   |      |      |      +------------------- LAN 3 (192.168.1.1)
&gt;   |      |      +-------------------------- LAN 2 (192.168.0.1)
&gt;   |      +--------------------------------- LAN 1 (10.0.0.1)
&gt;   +---------------------------------------- LAN 0 (203.1.1.1)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If I reinstall using KickStart, can I be assured that I won't get
&gt; something like this happening:
&gt; 
&gt; +------+------+------+------+------+
&gt; | Card | Card | Card | Card | Card |
&gt; |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; | eth4 | eth3 | eth2 | eth1 | eth0 |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; |      |      |      |      |      |
&gt; +------+------+------+------+------+
&gt;   |      |      |      |      |
&gt;   |      |      |      |      +------------ LAN 4 (172.16.1.1)
&gt;   |      |      |      +------------------- LAN 3 (192.168.1.1)
&gt;   |      |      +-------------------------- LAN 2 (192.168.0.1)
&gt;   |      +--------------------------------- LAN 1 (10.0.0.1)
&gt;   +---------------------------------------- LAN 0 (203.1.1.1)
&gt; 
&gt;    (A reshuffle of the kernel device names for each card)
&gt; 
&gt; If a reshuffle happened, connectivity would almost certainly be lost. I
&gt; don't really want that to happen.
&gt; 
&gt; Will Linux call the devices the same name each time it see's them? Is
&gt; this to do with the order they are placed on the board? Will Linux do
&gt; something annoying causing me to do more of this: &lt;bangs head against
&gt; wall&gt;? I dearly hope that it doesn't.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments are welcomed.
&gt;
