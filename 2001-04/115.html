You might have better luck (or at least less flames) posting this to a
Windows list ;)

I would not put any executables in a share that is world read/writable.
You should try and avoid putting executables in directories that are
writable (by anyone but administrators) as well.

Make sure that you are anal about updating your virus definitions on ALL
of your machines, and especially your servers.

&gt; Is there a way to stop completely or even minimise the spread of a worm via
&gt; a share which is read and writable to everyone? even the worms that may be
&gt; infected on a  connecting computer?
&gt; Recently i had a extra computer connect to my network and even tho it had a
&gt; million programs it did not detect the worm that was running and attaching
&gt; to exes and scr files. So it then afected all the exes and what not on my
&gt; shared drive. Causing more mess then i would like. Does anyone know
&gt; something that can stop this from happening or spreading?
&gt;
&gt; In a perfect world all workstations 100% virus free would be great, but in
&gt; my case that is not always possible.
&gt; Any help/suggestions greatly appriciated.
