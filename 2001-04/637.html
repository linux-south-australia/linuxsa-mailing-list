What about mylex raid cards? Personally I wouldnt use anything else.
They are well supported under linux becuase mylex provide free hardware
for the guy who writes the linux drivers, and give him the specs. It has
a decent text mode interface in the firmware which works well for me and
is quite configurable. Under linux it has quite a decent stats screen
(see below) and has a device you can pipe commands in to for rebuilding
etc. I have a small cron job that checks its status and emails me if its
not OK with all the info about the array.

I once jumped a scsi drive incorrectly and hot swapped it in (wanted to
try the hot swapability that its meant to have) but 'cos the id was
wrong one of the other drives dropped out. Server kept going, all was
well. I removed the new drive, issued the command to rebuild the drive
that was then out of sync and it did it all in the background
transperent to users.

When I tryed software raid (granted this was old versions, and I belive
its much more stable now) the install worked fine, and it ran well, but
when I pulled a drive out with the machine running (simulates a failed
drive) it died (cant remember if it was a panic or what, was a few
months ago) and I was unable to rebuild the drive. 

I have 2 servers with these raid card, and would highly recommend them
to those people who are spending someone elses money (they are probably
a bit costly for home users).

Heres an example of the interface for those who havnt had a chance to
use one:

&gt; &gt;&gt; What I offerred was not a summary at all. It was an opinion. I'm happy to
&gt; &gt;&gt; change it, what evidence do you have that software raid is superior to
&gt; &gt;&gt; hardware raid? Are you talking about systems that are real world loaded,
&gt; &gt;&gt; with cpu being used for things other than managing the disk?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My experience with hardware and software raid suggests that there are lots
&gt; &gt; of circumstances where software RAID is superior.
&gt; 
&gt; One point you didn't make is that the management interface for
&gt; hardware RAID is often much worse than the interface for software
&gt; RAID.  This doesn't have to be that way, but most boxes come with
&gt; Microsoft-based management tools which don't interface well with UNIX.
