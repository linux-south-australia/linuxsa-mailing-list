Frankly, it's a very sensible suggestion, too.

It's just that in the case of ADSL, the majority of the hard costs 
are imposed on us by Telstra and aren't related to the bandwidth 
downloads at all.  There's just nearly no margin in there, and 
'nearly no margin' doesn't feed my excellent technical staff and 
allow us to innovate.

I can say that we'll try hard to lower the entry barriers on ADSL when we can.

Meanwhile I'm also pleased to say that we are taking a steady stream 
of orders from people who are prepared to pay us an extra $10-$15 per 
month to see someone actually provide something as an alternative to 
Telstra. I won't get the violins out and thrash this point, but I'm 
encouraged by it.

We are investing very heavily in content servers as it happens. See 
the archives for an explanation of why that investment doesn't make 
the 'local' bandwidth free. We're doing some internal research on 
getting differentiated traffic flow measuring working (see those 
linxuxsa debates had some effect :) ).

When we get to the point of getting some useful flow measurements we 
might be able to come up with a new spin the ADSL stuff (on services 
in general) that somehow rewards local content access, but (again) 
see the archives for some of the pitfalls of trying this, and as a 
result for an explanation of why it's (currently) an uncommon 
charging model for ISP's in this country to adopt.

Believe me, I do see the point of the exercise and I'm thinking about 
what can be done to rationally address this.

Cheers,
Simon

&gt;As before - I suggest local content.  There are those
&gt;
&gt;of us who will need to download the occasional CD
&gt;
&gt;image (or even two in the case of Red Hat or Mandrake).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The list goes on.  I don't think it is a hundred
&gt;
&gt;individuals going sick that is the problem - it is
&gt;
&gt;often 100 individuals downloading similar material
&gt;
&gt;at some point which could have been stored locally.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I know that this topic has been bashed to death - so
&gt;
&gt;I am not going to debate it - I am just suggesting
&gt;
&gt;that Internode look more at content provision or
&gt;
&gt;caching, etc.
