The Education department already provides a sample set of Login scripts for NT, in order to automate Virus patching etc. It's not much, but it shows they are trying to standardize somewhat.

Also the M$ "black packs" only cover client machines (Win9x, office, NT workstation etc). It does not provide for NT server or NT licenses. Schools still pay for them, so there is room for Linux.

mdk.

&gt; &gt; If the Department put their mind to it, they could create a
&gt; &gt; Kickstart/Automated install CD of any operating system (FreeBSD, Linux
&gt; &gt; Distribution X, Windows 2000) which would ask appropriate questions at
&gt; &gt; startup...
&gt; 
&gt; Co-incidentally, this is about the third time in as many days that someone
&gt; has said something like this in my hearing.
&gt; 
&gt; At least one company makes a living by selling this service,
&gt; www.linbox.com. I've been to their place and tried it out and it really
&gt; does work.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Or, how about if we came up with a Zero Administration Linux (MS was
&gt; &gt; &gt; using the "Zero Administration" buzzword a while back to sell it's stuff
&gt; &gt; &gt; to schools). It would be possible to have a distribution that asked very
&gt; &gt; &gt; few questions and locked itself down real tight. Then nobody would need
&gt; &gt; &gt; to spend much money. I mean it would be *Another* Linux distribution,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but if it served a purpose....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But it doesn't need to be ANOTHER Linux distribution. It can be an
&gt; &gt; auto-install RedHat/Debian/Caldera/yada yada distribution.
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, that's what Linbox do.
