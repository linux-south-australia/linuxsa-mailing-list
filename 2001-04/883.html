&gt; 
&gt; Most schools on average have more than 100 pcs, especially secondary
&gt; schools. Normally I see schools spending more than $1000 on pcs, or if they
&gt; are, well then it warrants the need to have a full time admin to be fixing
&gt; it all the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Schools that I've worked at in the past have had up to $130,000 IT budget
&gt; ... that in some cases has been for the price including a full time
&gt; administrator ... but of course if an INTELLIGENT network/workstation

Well I suspect they were unusual.
I dont think you will find that is the case with most state primary
schools, particularly in areas where good IT is needed most, ie in areas
where kids dont have PCs at home and their parents cant afford computer
levies etc that some schools use to gain extra funds.


&gt; solution was implemented the need for a full time admin would not be there
&gt; in most schools.

No not a full time admin but a full time IT person, whose duties would
not be solely limted to admining the systems/network.
