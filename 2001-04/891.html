Did you just say 15GB? I mean, as in Fifteen Gigabytes? That's
absolutely obsurd. If you are downloading that at home every month,
something's wrong. It's generally not normal practise to download ISOs
because you can. 15GB? &lt;shake of head in disbelief&gt;. Please correct me
on this one.

&gt; Not at all but I dont like surprises on my use, if I exceed it once a blue
&gt; moon I think it's reasonable. As 90% of the time I never will, but I guess
&gt; they are there to make money or at least not lose it.

The easiest and most effective way of not getting surprises when you get
your bill is by being sensible with what you download. When we get our
Bill each month, I know that we will have downloaded ~10-11GB and from
that can work out how much I'll have to pay. 

&gt; Well perhaps but I feel a reasonable limit would ensure most people stay
&gt; within it, for my needs 1.5gb a month would be sufficient it may not be for
&gt; others.

TNSTAAFL. Get used to it. It's particularly true in the Internet
Industry.

&gt; Sadly you cant run a business by customising plans like that.

Nope, you can't. This topic, as Mark has already pointed out, has been
stabbed, hacked and hashed to death. Let's accept facts, or if you feel
compelled, read the archives.
