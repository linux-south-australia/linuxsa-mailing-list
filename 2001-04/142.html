Hi.

Well, I doubt it has been done, but how about developing a worm-eating
worm? If it propogates itself in the same fashion as the parasite, and
then seeks it out and destroys it, your problems are over.

that's my contribution to the day.

Execution of this suggestion is left as an exercise to the reader, because
the author has no idea on how to implement such a beast.

Regards,

Michael :)

&gt; Is there a way to stop completely or even minimise the spread of a worm via
&gt; a share which is read and writable to everyone? even the worms that may be
&gt; infected on a  connecting computer?
&gt; Recently i had a extra computer connect to my network and even tho it had a
&gt; million programs it did not detect the worm that was running and attaching
&gt; to exes and scr files. So it then afected all the exes and what not on my
&gt; shared drive. Causing more mess then i would like. Does anyone know
&gt; something that can stop this from happening or spreading?
&gt; 
&gt; In a perfect world all workstations 100% virus free would be great, but in
&gt; my case that is not always possible.
&gt; Any help/suggestions greatly appriciated.
