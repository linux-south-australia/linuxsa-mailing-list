&gt; Hmmm. Sounds about right. Did he contact you, or did you contact him? I
&gt; think if we have some kind of idea about the way to get things done and
&gt; take it to his successot(s), we'd have more chance. It would help if it
&gt; wasn't going to cost much as well. :-).
&gt;
&gt; To Sarah, Greg and other AUUG people, where does AUUG fit into this?

Nowhere yet.

&gt; Does AUUG have an opinion or ideas on the matter, or do AUUG prefer to
&gt; keep out of such things?

No.  No.

&gt;&gt; Join AUUG and find out. Or Join AUUG and make AUUG fit into this where you

&gt;
&gt; For those of you who weren't at the last LinuxSA meeting, everyone's
&gt; invited to the next AUUG-SA meeting (9 May, 7 PM, Marcellina's
&gt; Restaurant). I don't think there would be a problem of mentioning this
&gt; as an `agenda' item....

Agreed.  Judging by the number of messages on the subject (which I'm
still reading), it's obviously a popular topic.

So what's AUUG's opinion?  As I said, we currently don't have one.
Certainly the SA chapter's opinion or level of involvement is allowed
to be different from that of the national organization.  I think that
we should do something, but I don't have a really clear idea what.
This is obviously something to discuss at the next meeting.

In that connection, however, note that the AUUG has applied for
membership of the IT council of SA, so we should be in a position to
exert some influence.

BTW, if you want me to reply to any message, please copy me explicitly
on the message: I get between 1000 and 2000 messages a day, and though
I try to get through them all, I can miss some.  mutt flags messages
copied to me, so I read them first (if at all :-)
