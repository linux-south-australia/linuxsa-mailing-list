&gt;&gt; This is one of the big problems with XML, there aren't any good

&gt;&gt; help people just trying to get words on a page.
&gt;
&gt;XEmacs edits SGML just fine if you put the DocBook DTD in the
&gt;DTD-path.  I also set Enter to insert a &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; about
&gt;the cursor and auto-indent it.

Hmmm, OK, this looks good. I wonder if that extends to plain old emacs.

&gt;This isn't WYSIWYG, it's more like Word Perfect with the
&gt;Show Codes option on.
&gt;
&gt;My real problem with XML is that the rendering tools
&gt;aren't mature enough to do a decent job.  You seem
&gt;to end up under the hood fiddling with TeX anyway,
&gt;so there doesn't seem much benefit in not starting
&gt;from there.  Especially as LyX isn't half-bad.

Hmmm, well the stuff I have been playing with only required one instance of
hacking the TeX, and as soon as I can get OpenJade 1.4 to build, I will fix
that as well. 

However, I have had to hack the JadeTex stuff, and hope to fix that soon as
well.

&gt;Apache's Cocoon project will probably change my mind
&gt;about this, but that code base isn't ready for production
&gt;use yet.

OK, gotta go look ...

&gt;OpenOffice might end up producing a nice WYSIWYG DocBook
&gt;processor.  OpenOffice documents have their own XML DTD.
&gt;But all XML documents can be transformed (that's one of the
&gt;advantages of a regular syntax), so you should be able
&gt;to write your DocBook source in {Star|Open}Office using a
&gt;stylesheet containing the DocBook styles and the send
&gt;that through an XSLT processor to get DocBook source.
&gt;
&gt;The downside of this approach is the OpenOffice won't
&gt;enforce the syntax rules of DocBook (eg: You can't
&gt;have &lt;section&gt; &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt; &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; &lt;/section&gt;)
&gt;{X}Emacs does enforce the rules.
