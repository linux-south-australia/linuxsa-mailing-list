&gt; I've seen such things many years ago and there's a Macintosh here
&gt; somewhere with an Adaptec card that does just this. It seems strange that
&gt; someone hasn't done this for ATA drives because there is pretty much just
&gt; one driver set for all ATA drives, thus meaning the market is potentially
&gt; quite large.

Do you mean something done in hardware?
There are several kits on the market, some that look like a two stack
removable hard disk caddy, that are in fact a RAID1 device, with a SCSI
bus on one end and a connector for two IDE drives on the other. This
then slots into two 5.25" bays. Is this what you mean?
