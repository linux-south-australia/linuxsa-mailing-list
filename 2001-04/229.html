David,

It just happens that SuSE 7.1 does contain BIND 9.1.
But if you ask the installation software to install everything,
it will still only install 8.2.3 - a vulnerable version of 8.2.3!
[And of course this means that anyone who installs SuSE 7.1
must immediately download the fixed BIND 8.2.3 before they put
their machine on the net with named running!]

It is necessary to go back and specificially select the BIND 9.1
from the individual packages if you want it installed.

Now I did this yesterday, and it turns out that it does not
give you a set of 9.1-compatible config files, such as
/etc/named.conf. You have to read the manuals (which you have to
get from the doc directory of the source) and fix up the named.conf
file line by line.

Well, I've done that now.

The 9.1 binaries clobbered the 8.2.3 binaries, and everything works
fine with my upgraded zone files (just by adding $TTL or something)
and up-kludged named.conf file.

And lynx works fine - to slashdot.org anyway.
And the SuSE-configured mozilla works the same post-BIND-9.1
as pre-BIND-9.1.

So I can't see any problems immediately with the resolver libraries.

I think the water's warm.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
