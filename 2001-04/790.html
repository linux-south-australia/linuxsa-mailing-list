&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; The key problem is with the teaching staff rather than the IT support 
&gt; staff.  In general, they have little or no experience with non-Windows 
&gt; products.  Until you can show them an alternative, you won't get anywhere 
&gt; in schools.

The problem is not that there is a problem with support staff it is that
there is no support staff in the majority of (state) schools which I
suspect means the majority of schools.

The probelm with teaching staff is that they are not trained for IT.
Most of them left college without any exposure to CPs or computers and
all the skills they have now they have had to get in their own tiem and
own costs. Those that did have some exposure to IT ahd laughable exposure
and probalby no exposure to ssys admining any kind of box, let alone on a
compeltely foreign OS (ie unix).

There are IT coordinators - I know someone who just became one - which
means this year she will get paid(a laughable amount) for the work she has
been doing unpaid for the last 5 years. In other words she does IT
co-ordination for love not money. She has over the last say 5 years
probably spent an average of 3 hours evey week night "playing with" her
computer, for the first few years her mac, the last few years her PC.
All in her own time on her own equipment, using her own books and
software, just to come up to a reasonable level of competance as
a win/mac user.

Now the dept occaisonally runs course for IT coordinators, she recently
atended one for webmastering. They taught her how to "make web pages'
using dreamweaver, at the "school of the future" and that is about what
she can expect as training for her role. 

She wont get a short discourse on the linux security model, or even the NT
one. Or how to create a goup in linux or in NT. She wont get a quick
rundown on TCP/IP networking and http. She didnt even get a short
discourse on html when she did her web mastering course.
And even if she did, she actualy has a library to run, and other duites
not related to teaching likecurriculum development and school council.
In other words she does not have time to run a 100 host netowrk and admin
a few servers.

What possible motivation has she got to learn a new and complex OS?
And who is going to teach her?
And (more importantly) who is going to back her up when it all goes wrong?
Right now the answer is no one.

So it is much safer and less stressful/frustrating to stick with what she
knows, which is a bit about windows and abit about the mac, which she
prefers.

If there was professional IT staff to help her, that would be different.
If when half way through a class she needed help she could get it in 5 or
10 minutes, that would change things. The problem is she cant, she is the
one that has to give help and she is not properly equiped to do so on the
platform she is familar with, let alone a completely new and far more
complex(from the perspective of far more configruable).
 
She can call on external consultants but they cost between $30-$100+
per hour, so the school can only do that in the direst emergency or for
work that has been budgeted for in advance. 
10 consultant calls and they could have another PC.

Even training in universities for IT for teachers is laughable(and
mainly MS based) I did one of the courses at Flinders for easy units a
few years ago. Excel and word on win4workgroups.
Usiong excel as a databse. Doing bullet points and stylesheets in word.
That is tertiary level training in IT for teachers at the moment.

The basic fact which seem ot be gettign ignored over and over gain is that
most schools dont ahve a single person with the skillsto adminsiter a
linux box and wont have one unless schhools specifically have funds to
employ IT staff.
