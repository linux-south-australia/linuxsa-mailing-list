I would tend to think that the reason your cards wouldn't apprear in the
network would be network-protocol related ... eg the wonders of windows
browsing !. I do agree that the 8139 NIC's are shit (that's being nice of
course), but in a windows box they are of reasonable performance, providing
the box is correctly configured, but saying that I wouldn't rule out all $20
cards, we use the Davicom DM9102 in many pc's including our own and we have
found them to be quite reliable and of reasonable perforamnce. The Linux
driver for these cards (DMFE) has proven to us to be a fairly good
performance driver and we normally get fairly good transfer speeds here at
work over it. For those who regularly are faced with the terrors of 8139's
in a Linux box, normally under 2.2 kernels we have found them to perform at
about 2Mbps, however since upgrading to 2.4 kernels we have found significat
performance increase, obviously not fantastic increase, but worthwhile,
especially if you've only got a 10Mbps hub.

These cards are woeful.

Our win98 peer to peer network never worked properly from the time my
tight-assed boss installed them into both his and my workstations.
Most times, these $20 wonders wouldn't even publish themselves on the
network!
I changed the cards to 3com to solve the problem and prove the point.
You get what you pay for...

"if you have $20 network cards expect only a $20 network!!!"
