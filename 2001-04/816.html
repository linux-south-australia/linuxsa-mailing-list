It is with pleasure and some relief that I would like to note to the 
residents of the linuxsa list that Internode finally has its ADSL 
product 'out the door'.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many people who 
have both debated my thoughts on the topic here over time, and who 
have provided many reasonable suggestions about what is good, what is 
bad, and what is indifferent about an ADSL offering that makes sense 
for Linux users.

Your collective input has had a very significant effect on the final 
shape of the service we've built, and we hope that some of you are 
able to take advantage of the results now.

We believe that our service provides far more useful a structure than 
the Telstra offering, including features such as a static IP address 
(or five of them), no need to run PPPoE software (native TCP/IP over 
Ethernet), making configuration a trivial exercise, and other aspects 
which also help to make things simpler and more reasonable.

Good things aren't necessarily cheap things, as I've gone to great 
lengths to point out in various other debates on this list. And the 
Internode ADSL service is -not- the lowest price service you can find 
in this realm. We do, however, think it's the most useful, and the 
most likely to make you happy in the long term.

So there you have it, other than to note that if you're interested in 
pursuing this further, you can find a full package of information and 
pricing on the offering at

	<A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>

and I'll leave it to those who are interested to take a look at that 
site and see what I mean for themselves.

Thanks again,

     Simon Hackett
