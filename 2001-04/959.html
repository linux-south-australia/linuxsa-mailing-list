Hi.

Hmm. Did you try a double blind test using 3 &lt;18 boys?

Michael :)

&gt; G'day from the Coat-Hanger City,
&gt; 
&gt; I've got 3 &lt;18 girls staying at my place at the moment & when they sat
&gt; down at my OS/2 boxes to check their email, they thought they were Macs.
&gt; (Perhaps they saw similarities with the superb, Object-Orientated GUI on
&gt; OS/2 with the Mac...)
&gt; 
&gt; One of one of PCs even had the IBM Logo clearly visible on the CPU case!
&gt; 
&gt; One of them said, "Oh, if its not Windows, it must be a Mac" (!)
&gt; 
&gt; With young people leaving school with this mentality, we should be
&gt; scared, very scared.
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly enough, with &lt;2 minutes instruction, the girls were
&gt; running ICQ on the OS/2 boxes & chatting to their friends, they didn't
&gt; really care it wasn't Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; People think they need Windows, but you push them, they'll concede that
&gt; they need functionality.
&gt; 
&gt; When I made my 1st Redhat Linux box it was easier than Win95:- all I did
&gt; was make sure the hardware I was using was supported on the install CD.
&gt; 
&gt; Demonstrating this & the excellent ListServ & Newsgroup support
&gt; available will make superior OSes much more attractive. Gee, it might
&gt; mean, young people might also unwittingly become literate!

&gt; &gt; Ok, I'll make some suggestions and flames can catch from there ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We can establish a working-party to promote Linux where we see it has a role. (I
&gt; &gt; would be happy to contrbute)
&gt; &gt; We can provide a framework of activities that will expose Linux to those who
&gt; &gt; would benefit from using it.
&gt; &gt; eg free talks to schools, community groups, IT support staff & managers, and
&gt; &gt; (flame jacket on)  we really really REALLY should use the LinuxSA web site in a
&gt; &gt; more proactive manner (read-support-portal) :-)
&gt; &gt; These types of activities may well be the best step in starting a LinuxSA support
&gt; &gt; network, who knows all contibs welcome.
