&gt; you
&gt; can start to gauge just how much time and effort go into maintaining a 'word'
&gt; based document, eg style layout, section footers and so on.  Word does not make
&gt; it easy or pretty, its time and energy spent formatting that could be better
&gt; spent on content.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Personally I think Lyx is by far the best tool to use for large documents bar
&gt; none.

&gt; &gt; I have been engaged in a large documentation project, producing some 350
&gt; &gt; pages of technical documentation over the last few weeks, and will be going
&gt; &gt; on to produce several hundred more over the next few weeks.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; Also, with word, I can use someone straight out of high school to
&gt; &gt; maintain the documentation. Thus, there is less of a maintenance issue.


Word can be a terrible for large documents.

As part of a project, I put together the final document. ~700 pages, ~20
jpeg images ~100 tables, footnotes, headers, footers.

I had sections, chapters, appendixes the works.

Word screwed up on me so many times, I ended up having to split it into
many documents. I just couldn't handle it.

The most common problem was the auto numbering screwing up. It is
supposed to be clever enough that if you use autonumbering for you
chapters (say) then the figures and tables within the chapters will take
that major number:

1. Chapter 1

   text text text text
 
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   table 1.1

2. Chapter 2

   text text text text
 
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   table 2.1


Well this autonumbering would screw up, causing me to go back to touch
every one to make it update again. Then that stopped working and I
started to loose my temper. I then split it up into seperate documents,
and vowed never to use Word again.

In the process of doing this, it started to say "Cannot save document
[ok]". I flew into a rage at this point. Then it started saying "Unable
to save document, no spce left on drive C [ok]". I had about 1 gig free,
so this is when I started bleeding out of my eyes from the stress.

I guarantee that you will at some point start spending more time on
massaging word than working on the content, and you will be healthier.
Trust me.
