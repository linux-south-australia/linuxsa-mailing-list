&gt; Hi,

&gt; I wanted to share a concern I have at what I view as both an insidious and
&gt; particularly effective business strategy on the part of Microsoft to ensure
&gt; their total dominance in the computer industry for years to come ...

OK. If we assume that it is as gloomy as Richard appears to, does anyone
have any real ideas as to how things can be changed? We have
representatives from most areas of the real world and I know of a couple
of people on this list who spend a great deal of time and effort for the
good of the Open Source world. Do any of these people have any opinions
about what can be done? It has already been established that schools are
a key influence on the rest of the corporate world, so what can I do to
help *my* school move forward? Obviously, it would be in the interests
of other groups (such as the SA BSD group) to have input into this.

ideas anyone?

Matt

P.S. Dan Shearer: Whatever happened to that guy from the state
government who was claiming to be pushing for this stuff?
