The ongoing cost on the static IP is to our forward costs to APNIC; 
The real issue for us is that the Telstra 'wholesale' model is so 
puntative that we can't make it any cheaper without loosing money. 
That's the constraint we face. So instead, I decided to try really 
hard to deliver higher value for that price point (which, I might 
add, is certainly circa $10 per month more than the nearest 
equivalent telstra plan point, though the excess rates are
lower - and are the place in which we have some room to negotiate).

It's a hard issue. Telstra really are trying hard to screw over the 
wholesale market. This is the best that we can currently do, and we 
need to build up a customer base in order to have any leverage to try 
to argue our internal costs down (and hence be able to move the 
external ones down).

I'm obviously, however, highly interested in feedback like this, and 
if we don't hit a high enough sales rate at the current price point, 
I will have to do the sums on the impact on us of winding it down a 
tad - but because the economics are so bad for us internally, that 
would probably push financial break even (in theory) out from 18 
months to 3-5 years. It's that sensitive a cost model unfortunately.

So I'm asking for support of a local company doing it 'right', and 
yes, I'm actually asking for more money than the nearest telstra plan 
- but for a higher delivered value.

In the end, you need to make a judgement call on whether the higher 
delivered value is worth an extra 43 cents per day.

Again, comments sincerely appreciated and I'm listening.

Simon

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I have looked at the Internode plan, and at first I was perturbed by the
&gt;cost of the 1.5GB/month service, until I calced the cost of 1.5GB at
&gt;18c/MB. It is around $290 ...
&gt;
&gt;So, it seems Internode is passing on a goodly proportion of their volume
&gt;discounts to us at that rate.
&gt;
&gt;However, I am still a little perturbed at the $145/m price tag for 500MB/mo
&gt;and static IP given that we are asked to pay for the ADSL modem. Can it
&gt;really cost all that much to maintain the static IP?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards
