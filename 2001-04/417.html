&gt; Working on that :) Should look in the same ballpark as the
&gt; alternatives, but with more features included. Real Soon Now :)

access mechanism included?

bearing in mind what you said in another email:

-----
Probably not - that's the upside of getting you to buy your own DSL
device - which seems to be the reason why the Tel$stra plans have
lock in periods - you're paying off your DSL hardware, just like
'free' mobile phone plans.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;I also looked up prices on the Net and prices start at $400 upto
&gt;$1400 for the Cisco. You could offer the device on an 'Interest
&gt;Free' type deal, outsourced to someone like AGC so you dont carry
&gt;the risk..

Just offering outright purchase is the most appealing thing right now
- and we will offer quite good prices - e.g. $995 for the Cisco, not
the $1400 retail - because they're a good device and easy for us to
support, but the $400 realm (Alcatel SpeedTouch Home) will work fine
for most situations as well.
-----

This means that the real cost of the ADSL plan is ~$400 + Internode Setup +
Internode monthly fee...

Sure, the ~$400 gives you a device, which you could sell later, but if you
are comparing to Telstra, you'd want to call that ~$400 about $16/month to
make a fair comparison over two years...


&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Here's the irony - some people feel that 1500 is huge, but others
&gt; think the 250-500 included by Telstra in their plans is way too small.

mmm... I know...

&gt; I'm in favour of structuring things with a 1500 Mb cap but with out a
&gt; huge financial penalty involved. The aim here is to let you have a
&gt; 'busy' month once in a while without an excess bill, not to have you
&gt; download 1499 MB's per month. So its a trade - I don't charge you
&gt; much different to Telstra but include a lot more MB's, and you are
&gt; nice to me and don't deliberately rip me off, and we both win.
&gt;
&gt; That's the theory, anyway.

well, good luck on it -- sounds almost like the "unlimited account"
philosophy to me... I know that if I have a cap of 1500Mb, and there is no
penalty for using it all, I'll be very relaxed about my bandwidth usage
(without being a true leech and wgeting porn and mp3s...) It's your
business, so it's your decision, and I don't think your clients would mind
such generosity, but if it were me, I'd be modelling my plans on optus, with
rollover, falling per-Mb rates for included Mb, and so on (of course, this
is completely disregarding the cost of writing such complex billing
software... but whatever :)

I'm happy with whatever solution, really, as long as it's fair to me, and
doesn't cost me a huge amount...

Cool -- now to set up my linux gateway, and see about getting some wireless
cards...
