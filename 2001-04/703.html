&gt; It seems that Microsoft has been very effective at getting parts of their

I can vouch for the around the world bit. Where I am education is free.
No HECS no fees, nothing. (However, alot of people still can't "afford"
it. That is, they can't afford their kids to go to school and not work)

Being MS certified (whatever good that really is) is a big deal here. A
very big deal. People get hired just because of that - because usually
they will be supporting third party application running on NT. So all
they can really know is NT.
