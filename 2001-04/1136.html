&gt;- full internet/web/etc access to any 'local' web servers (in our
&gt;customer base, or attached to SAIX member ISP's customer bases)

Sounds good, in this case it would be a good idea to make it known which 
ISP's are connected to SAIX.

&gt;- access filters applied so that downloads are only permitted from
&gt;local-to-Internode and SAIX-connected sources

What about AusBONE or is that charged per mb?

&gt;- full access to email (but only via the Internode mail server)
&gt;- full access to our news server (which has a completely loony amount of 
&gt;content on it, fed from multiple happy satellite sources)
&gt;- full access to our games servers
&gt;- blocked access to any content other than the above.  Try to surf
&gt;outside of those boundaries, and it won't work. Try to use any other
&gt;IP ports outside of those boundaries and it won't work.
&gt;- dynamic IP address (only, no static option)
&gt;- idle timer (probably fairly low - maybe 30 mins)
&gt;- session hard limit (probably something like 6 hours)

This all sounds pretty good...
I don't know whether a lot of people would 'latch' on to it though because 
its kinda complicated for people that aren't really internet savvy, it would 
have to be explained in a pretty plain way for those that aren't savvy.

&gt;- special indial number to use this account, available Adelaide area
&gt;and  Willunga/Fleurieu only (so far) - i.e. places where we have
&gt;broadband private links back to Adelaide, as we install them - next
&gt;likely area would be Barossa Valley

Don't know what you mean here, I seen your article in the paper today, very 
good idea!!! bet telstra aint too happy with you!!

&gt;- option for full Internet access by dialling our *standard* numbers,
&gt;but with *all* access (over a nominal/token included 50 Mb per month)
&gt;charged at $0.18/Mb. So if you really need that external thing in a
&gt;pinch, either pay-as-you-go downloads, or use some other ISP account
&gt;you might have lurking for that need anyway

Reading the above, I was going to say something like this, but you already 
accounted for it!!!

&gt;- Acceptable Use Policy covering deliberate attempts to rip us off
&gt;(such as port bouncing to other Internet links and ftp-by-mail
&gt;software to do huge external downloads through our long suffering
&gt;mail server)

Hmm, gonna be interesting to see if anyones gonna try!!! why don't you use a 
separate mail server. Also maybe restrict the size of mail messages to 1 
megabyte, and if it is over that then a surcharge of say 20cents is 
charged....I don't know how you could implement this but its an idea.

&gt;My target here was game players (playing on either our game servers
&gt;or any other servers attached to SAIX), but it also works equally
&gt;well for news server downloading.

&gt;Would anyone go for the above? Is it a useful thing to offer?
&gt;
&gt;What it *does* offer you is the opportunity to create 'self service'
&gt;local download optimisation.
&gt;
&gt;What it boils down to is this:
&gt;
&gt;	- dial one number, get local only for $0 per Mb
&gt;	- dial another number, get everything for $0.18/Mb.
&gt;
&gt;So this is yet another opportunity for you to influence our product
&gt;development :)
&gt;
&gt;The above popped into my head a few weeks ago as one way to offer a
&gt;reward for local access that was not subject to argument - i.e. on
&gt;the special indial number, if you can get it at all, we definitely
&gt;won't charge you for it - so there is no need to be worried, just try
&gt;it - if it works, it's $0 per Mb. If it doesn't, then it isn't (and
&gt;you can dial our main numbers to pay $0.18 /Mb to get it)


Don't know whether you accounted for this but restricting both ways traffic 
from this type of dial up. ie. say I have an illegal mp3 trading program and 
I want my mates to get some mp3s from my machine, I dial up to the LOCAL 
access number and ring my mate and tell him my IP address then he downloads 
for 6 hours, mp3's or other files from my machine. But knowing you and what 
you have covered before you would have already accounted for this...

Other than that, it sounds good.
Top stuff Simon, keep up the good work...


Regards,

Michael
