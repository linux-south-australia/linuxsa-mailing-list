&gt; You seem to have done it without troubles, and I know that I'd probably
&gt; be alright doing it via RPM, but I still refuse to. Surely you wouldn't
&gt; do this on a server? Now that's truely insane. Mad even :-)

ahh... so it's a religious thing then. And yes, I would and do do it on
servers. I'm more cautious when using redhat, as RH doesn't seem to get it
quite right, but debian is really really good. I have more trust in a
well-developed and thoroughly tested and debugged script than I do in my own
ability to set options and compile and install -- my philosophy of computers
is that they are much better than us at doing repetitive things, and hence,
unless something weird happens, the script will be better than me (if
something weird happens, which it generally doesn't, unless it's RH, then I
have to intervene)...

&gt; Besides, it's almost a spiritual journey configuring and compiling your
&gt; kernel, especially if its for a server or any other box that is worth
&gt; anything at all.

mmm... it's all personal -- I kind of think that spiritual journeys are best
kept away from servers or things that are worth anything at all... I'd
rather have the predictability and repeatability of a script. Maybe that's
partly because my nature is not particularly predictable or repeatable :)
