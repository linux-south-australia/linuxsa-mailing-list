&gt;&gt; Hmmm...

&gt;&gt;&gt; I have fond memories of writing 'Doctor' (Can't remember its real name) in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Simula 67 at Uni.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are you talking about "Eliza"?
&gt;
&gt; Yup, ... That's it. I think it was also suggested we do it in Lisp
&gt; as well ...

The original was in LISP.  Stallman did a rather weak clone in Emacs
LISP:

+ I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
+ you are finished talking, type RET twice.
+ 
+ I can't stand people who don't like Algol
+ 
+ Why do you say that?
+ 
+ They're talking about Algol on Linuxsa as if it were some kind of
+ disease.
+ 
+ Maybe you should consult a doctor of medicine, I am a psychiatrist.
+ 
+ Nope, I think Algol is fine.  It would run rings round C.
+ 
+ What makes you believe it would run rings round c?
+ 
+ I wrote some really nice programs in Algol while Dennis Ritchie was 
+ still in nappies.
+ 
+ What happened when dennis ritchie was still in nappies?
+ 
+ Idiot, I just told you.  I wrote some really nice programs in Algol.
+ 
+ Perhaps your plans have something to do with this.
+ 
+ Are you listening to what I'm saying?
+ 
+ Is it because of your life that you say are me listening to what you
+ are saying?
