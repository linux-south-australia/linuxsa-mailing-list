&gt; Perhaps someone would also be able to shed some light on how often AARNET
&gt; update their GNOME mirror.

This is not necessary AFAIK.  download.gnome.org automagically selects a mirror
close by.  I haven't checked out the magic, but it's supposedly there.
 
&gt; It's a shame that the GNOME team could not work out the Medusa problems in
&gt; time, but I guess we will just have to wait until 1.4.1 for that to
&gt; re-enter.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to trying out the latest release -
&gt; now if only they could comply with the new WM-SPEC, because then it will
&gt; become possible to use blackbox as a window manager with the environment
&gt; (bb already fully supports the spec), but we will have to wait until 2.0
&gt; for that.

Agreed.  GNOME 1.4 introduces some nice technology - bonobo-proper, gdk-pixbuf,
nautlius, better i8n etc. but GNOME 2.0 will be even better! KDE and GNOME will
play together well and have better interopperability by then, as well as things
like WM-SPEC and Linux FHS compliancy.  There has been plenty of discussion on
gnome-hackers about stuff that was left out of GNOME 1.4 so it would get out the
door sooner (and get some nice improvements into the hands of users now).   

GNOME 2.0 will have some really nice stuff (list still being finalised) but will
also have a fairly strict release timeline, again so users get their hands on
some of the cool stuff that's been in the "unstable" CVS branches for a while
now.
