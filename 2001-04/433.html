Thanks for the reply David,

I've turned off the HTML thing in OE, I should have known that it would reek
havoc in other mail clients. It's really weird with this Mandrake problem, I
have already installed this OS using graphical installer on this PC prior to
now and it went without hitch, all the other distro's were the same, only
now, when I went to install Mandrake this time it misbehaved. I will give
htese ideas a try.

&gt;
&gt; Hi There!
&gt;
&gt; That was a kernel panic. It means that the kernel that Mandrake was
&gt; loading to run the boot process found something it couldn't handle and
&gt; decided to crash. The 00's (et al) that appeared are a hexadecimal dump
&gt; of various registers and states that the kernel was in. If you don't
&gt; understand that last sentence, don't worry too much.
&gt;
&gt; 1) Does this computer behave oddly at all?
&gt;
&gt; 2) Try forcing the install into a text install and try to be more
&gt; specific about what kernel you're installing
&gt;  - last time I installed a Mandrake 7.2 you had to fiddle with alt keys
&gt; to throw out the graphical install and then work out how to get a text
&gt; one
&gt;
&gt; 3) Try installing from a floppy install disk
&gt;  - it's possible (but highly unlikely) that the kernel image on your CD
&gt; is very slightly stuffed
&gt;  - you could try downloading this image from the Internet
&gt;
&gt; 4) Look up "AMD K6-2 Mandrake panic" at <A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A>
&gt;
&gt; 5) Make sure you don't have any shared IRQ's
&gt;
&gt; On the panic note, my system (a RedHat 6.2 system) says it's going to
&gt; check partitions just after your system crashes. Your system's swapper
&gt; process seems to cark it; that might give a clue to someone else...
&gt;
&gt; DSL
&gt;
&gt; p.s.
&gt;
&gt; I understand you probably don't have a sane working Linux/Open Source
&gt; O/S running at the moment, but Microsoft Outlook Express 5.50.4133.2400
&gt; formatted your message in such a way that my mail reader (Netscape 4.75
&gt; for Linux) was wholly unable to render it and I had to scroll three
&gt; screens to the right to actually work out what you were saying was wrong
&gt; :-(
