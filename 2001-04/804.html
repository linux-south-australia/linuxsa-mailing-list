These sound like good suggestions.

I'll try and get off my hobby horse now.

&gt; Ok, I'll make some suggestions and flames can catch from there ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; We can establish a working-party to promote Linux where we see it has a role. (I
&gt; would be happy to contrbute)
&gt; We can provide a framework of activities that will expose Linux to those who
&gt; would benefit from using it.
&gt; eg free talks to schools, community groups, IT support staff & managers, and
&gt; (flame jacket on)  we really really REALLY should use the LinuxSA web site in a
&gt; more proactive manner (read-support-portal) :-)
&gt; These types of activities may well be the best step in starting a LinuxSA support
&gt; network, who knows all contibs welcome.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to share a concern I have at what I view as both an insidious and
&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly effective business strategy on the part of Microsoft to ensure
&gt; &gt; &gt; their total dominance in the computer industry for years to come ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK. If we assume that it is as gloomy as Richard appears to, does anyone
&gt; &gt; have any real ideas as to how things can be changed? We have
&gt; &gt; representatives from most areas of the real world and I know of a couple
&gt; &gt; of people on this list who spend a great deal of time and effort for the
&gt; &gt; good of the Open Source world. Do any of these people have any opinions
&gt; &gt; about what can be done? It has already been established that schools are
&gt; &gt; a key influence on the rest of the corporate world, so what can I do to
&gt; &gt; help *my* school move forward? Obviously, it would be in the interests
&gt; &gt; of other groups (such as the SA BSD group) to have input into this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ideas anyone?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; P.S. Dan Shearer: Whatever happened to that guy from the state
&gt; &gt; government who was claiming to be pushing for this stuff?
