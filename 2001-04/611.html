Hi.

Thanks for that.

I am under the impression that the hardware raid cards have their own
processors?, and that that would be a benefit to the whole equation.

What I offerred was not a summary at all. It was an opinion. I'm happy to
change it, what evidence do you have that software raid is superior to
hardware raid? Are you talking about systems that are real world loaded,
with cpu being used for things other than managing the disk?

I would have thought that there is an *inherent* benefit in offloading
raid management from system CPU. That is not true?

Regards,

Michael

&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Neither. Believe what you like regarding M$. Install a good Hardware Raid
&gt;  &gt; card and M$ will never know about it. The OS only sees the logical volume
&gt;  &gt; created in hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you've been reading too much promotional literature from 
&gt; hardware RAID card manufacturers.  Your summary above glosses over 
&gt; far too many issues to be even remotely useful.
&gt; 
&gt; Fact:  There is no *inherent* reason why hardware RAID should perform
&gt; better than software RAID.  A hardware RAID card has a PCI interface
&gt; on one "side", one or more SCSI busses on the other "side", and an
&gt; embedded processor running real-live *software* (yes, it's usually called
&gt; "firmware", but "firmware" is just software with delusions of grandeur).
&gt; 
&gt; The SCSI busses coming out the back of the RAID card are the same as the
&gt; SCSI busses you get from a non-RAID SCSI controller;  The PCI interface
&gt; on the RAID card is the same as a non-RAID PCI interface.  And the CPU 
&gt; on the RAID card is almost always slower than the CPU on your motherboard
&gt; (at least, it is these days).
&gt; 
&gt; Unless you get into a state where the bottleneck is PCI bus bandwidth,
&gt; it's simply not true to assume that hardware RAID will perform any better
&gt; than a good software RAID implementation.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The MSCE guide must be talking about software raid?
&gt; 
&gt; Or something else totally different :-)
