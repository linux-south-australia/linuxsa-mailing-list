&gt;&gt;- full internet/web/etc access to any 'local' web servers (in our

&gt;
&gt;Sounds good, in this case it would be a good idea to make it known 
&gt;which ISP's are connected to SAIX.

That can be done.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;- access filters applied so that downloads are only permitted from
&gt;&gt;local-to-Internode and SAIX-connected sources
&gt;
&gt;What about AusBONE or is that charged per mb?

AusBone isn't peering into SAIX at this time. Ausbone are having 
problems of their own. And, yes, AusBone bytes cost users of same at 
a $ per MB rate - one which used to be low compared to high volume 
wholesale pricing, but which is no longer looking anything like as 
'keen' - reducing the incentive to save a little bit in order to 
reduce your customers' performance (because Ausbone don't have enough 
bandwidth either).

Its hard to be a national peering fabric in a country where domestic 
transit is more expensive than international transit (separate topic 
altogether).

&gt;&gt;- full access to email (but only via the Internode mail server)
&gt;&gt;- full access to our news server (which has a completely loony 
&gt;&gt;amount of content on it, fed from multiple happy satellite sources)
&gt;&gt;- full access to our games servers
&gt;&gt;- blocked access to any content other than the above.  Try to surf
&gt;&gt;outside of those boundaries, and it won't work. Try to use any other
&gt;&gt;IP ports outside of those boundaries and it won't work.
&gt;&gt;- dynamic IP address (only, no static option)
&gt;&gt;- idle timer (probably fairly low - maybe 30 mins)
&gt;&gt;- session hard limit (probably something like 6 hours)
&gt;
&gt;This all sounds pretty good...
&gt;I don't know whether a lot of people would 'latch' on to it though 
&gt;because its kinda complicated for people that aren't really internet 
&gt;savvy, it would have to be explained in a pretty plain way for those 
&gt;that aren't savvy.

Yeah, I appreciate that. Its the major thing pushing back against 
bothering to be honest. But the request was made by some of our own 
game playing customers, what i'm trying to do is work out whether its 
worth doing the technical hacking needed to make it possible.

&gt;&gt;- special indial number to use this account, available Adelaide area
&gt;&gt;and  Willunga/Fleurieu only (so far) - i.e. places where we have
&gt;&gt;broadband private links back to Adelaide, as we install them - next
&gt;&gt;likely area would be Barossa Valley
&gt;
&gt;Don't know what you mean here, I seen your article in the paper 
&gt;today, very good idea!!! bet telstra aint too happy with you!!

The agile network build into the Murray Bridge and Coorong districts 
is quite distinct to the Internode dial network in Adelaide at this 
point, though some confusion is natural.

For those who don't know what we're talking about here, I will refer you to

	<A HREF="http://www.agile.com.au/cnAbout.shtml">http://www.agile.com.au/cnAbout.shtml</A>

Or you can read yesterday (Friday)'s Advertiser on page six, or 
(hopefully) next Tuesday's Australian :) :)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;- option for full Internet access by dialling our *standard* numbers,
&gt;&gt;but with *all* access (over a nominal/token included 50 Mb per month)
&gt;&gt;charged at $0.18/Mb. So if you really need that external thing in a
&gt;&gt;pinch, either pay-as-you-go downloads, or use some other ISP account
&gt;&gt;you might have lurking for that need anyway
&gt;
&gt;Reading the above, I was going to say something like this, but you 
&gt;already accounted for it!!!

Yeah, it's an issue; It's also obviously an avenue to cause great 
confusion for the 'unclear'. Probably the other thing that pushes 
back against doing it (versus trying to find some other way to 
approach the issue of simple approaches for rewarding local access, 
which is really what this is all about, I guess).

&gt;&gt;- Acceptable Use Policy covering deliberate attempts to rip us off
&gt;&gt;(such as port bouncing to other Internet links and ftp-by-mail
&gt;&gt;software to do huge external downloads through our long suffering
&gt;&gt;mail server)
&gt;
&gt;Hmm, gonna be interesting to see if anyones gonna try!!! why don't 
&gt;you use a separate mail server. Also maybe restrict the size of mail 
&gt;messages to 1 megabyte, and if it is over that then a surcharge of 
&gt;say 20cents is charged....I don't know how you could implement this 
&gt;but its an idea.

I was considering asking for peoples' honesty in the first instance. 
Yeah, I know its radical, but...

[...]
&gt;
&gt;Don't know whether you accounted for this but restricting both ways 
&gt;traffic from this type of dial up. ie. say I have an illegal mp3 
&gt;trading program and I want my mates to get some mp3s from my 
&gt;machine, I dial up to the LOCAL access number and ring my mate and 
&gt;tell him my IP address then he downloads for 6 hours, mp3's or other 
&gt;files from my machine. But knowing you and what you have covered 
&gt;before you would have already accounted for this...

Hah, no, I hadn't really thought about that one. But to be honest, 
I'm not sure that one scares me at all. It would result in two paying 
customers who used our service because it was more convenient than 
direct-dialling each other, or (shock) exercising the merits of a 
social life by putting the offending files on a zip drive and meeting 
face to face (I know how dirty and un-tech that sounds but, well, 
some people still do it .... eeeuuuuwww!)
