&gt; &gt; Another point:  I know that there is a lot of Linux in SA schools already.
&gt; &gt; ISPs (some of whom no longer exist!) have been going around installing
&gt; &gt; Linux servers for dialup and other services. The school often has no idea
&gt; &gt; this has happened, and it often works for years without any problem.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a good example of the 'set and forget' system that schools are
&gt; after. They don't want to be spending time/money nurturing servers.
&gt; Schools are instutions of education and should be writing up budgets
&gt; with that in mind, rather than 'how much is it going to cost this year
&gt; on Consultants' or whatever.

And some schools have been burnt by this.
I have fixed two of them.
One where I was paid and one because I know the "IT coordinator".

The problem is no local skills inteh os and as Danpointed out businesses
that go our of business, or lose track of what was installed, lose the
staff member who was the linux head adn dont have anyone else who has the
skills themsleves or for whatever reason are unresponsive.

Same problem happens with volunteer parents. They move, get jobs, or get
a new hobby.
