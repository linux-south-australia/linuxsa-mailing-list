&gt;Actually whilst on the subject of ISP's / Static IP I might ask a question or
&gt;ten...

[snip]

&gt;I live in the Victor Harbor area; tis my only problem.  I'd also need a half
&gt;decent download limit (Ideally I want perm connect / unlim downloads, but I've
&gt;come to the conclusion this isnt a reality in .au unfortunately...) 
&gt;but I reckon
&gt;I could live with a 1gig download limit.. preferably more, but yeah.  I dont
&gt;want to restrict myself to the point of stupidity :P  (yes, &lt;1gig is stupidity
&gt;to me, I've had periods of 8+gig download/month with asiaonline).
&gt;
&gt;I'd also be interested to know of any ISP's in Adelaide that do the same, but
&gt;primarily, in Victor.
&gt;
&gt;I only know of 5 isp's down here..
&gt;
&gt;- Asia Online (no perm. connect afaik.. im with them now..  apart from the 6
&gt;hour disconnect, I can only praise them.)
&gt;- Granite (they dont offer one afaik)
&gt;- Camtech/Ozemail (ditto..)
&gt;- Internode (dont think they do...)
&gt;- Intertech (Only heard bad things about them).

Ok, well we don't have that account in our list this week, but as it 
happens, I've drafted just such an account up for release in a couple 
of weeks (along with a complete redesign of our dialup plans in 
general :) ).

For a 1 gig download limit, think in terms of $50 per month (single 
modem, no ISDN)

Or $95 per month for 2 gigs per month and permission to run dual 
modem or dial ISDN into us if you want to.

No, don't try to sign up for the above yet, our sales staff will 
wonder what you've been smoking. But I expect to have those plans 
ratified inside of about 10-14 days. Along with several other rather 
interesting dialup and ISDN options :)

We have a very, very fast PoP servicing the fleurieu, including Victor Harbor.

&gt;I think there's another, fairson, but I believe they're just got a box
&gt;telehosted with internode.. looks like a redhat b0x3n too, and not a 
&gt;very secure
&gt;one at that :~(

They'd probably appreciate a note about their box, if it has probems 
that you are aware of and they are not. Do them a favour :)

Not my place to disclose how Fairson choose to run their business, 
but, well, they have a very, very fast PoP servicing the Victor 
Harbour area too. If you like their plans better, use them.

&gt;
&gt;Anyways, any suggestions would be appreciated :)

See above.

Simon

p.s. apologies for those who think I'm just advertising our services 
here - but this fine person *did* ask :)
