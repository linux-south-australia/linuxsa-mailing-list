&gt;Hi List,
&gt;
&gt;I guess everyone has their own specific needs/wants regarding provision of
&gt;broadband services. And yes, I have my own too.
&gt;
&gt;I think Internode fall short in a couple of areas. (Sorry Simon)

On the contrary, the more pitfalls I learn about, the more I can try 
to address them.

&gt;
&gt;1. the allowance/cap is still too low it should be minimum of 1gb/month

It is - select the higher usage plan to get 1500 mb's per month included.

&gt;2. The setup costs are fine

Cool.

&gt;3. The monthly access should be no more than 80 it's more than BP now (I
&gt;understand the wholesale price issue)

Not feasible unfortunately, since (with the bandwidth fees included), 
the total cost to us to source the service from Telstra is 
substantially greater than $80 per month. Welcome to the 'free 
market', and yes, we are talking with the ACCC about this issue, as 
is every ADSL provider, but action on this topic may not happen fast.

So I can't fix that one, hence my choice was to design our service to 
be more feature-rich for a comparable price (static IP addresses, no 
need to use PPPoE, etc etc) - as the most rational approach to take 
in the circumstances - i.e. if we can't lower the price, well, we can 
raise the value provided.

You need to step back and consider that prior to ADSL, the only 
options for 1.5 megabits per second to the home cost in excess of 
$20k per annum plus your download fees. Taken in that light, any 
notion that $95 or $135 or even $500 per month for that sort of speed 
is unacceptably expensive is rather, well, inaccurate :)

That's different to whether the price point is low enough for you, in 
particular, to afford. I completely appreciate that it might not be. 
Every drop in price will allow one more tier of people to take up a 
service. Meantime Telstra and Internode are both seeing very strong 
demand at the existing price points, i.e. the price is already so far 
under $20k per annum that it's admitted in a whole heap of people who 
-can- decide that they can afford sub $500 per month for access 
previous impossible for less than four digits per month per line.

[...]

&gt;I guess in the end if I could get ADSL 256/64 for 200 install, 75/month,
&gt;without the cap or with a 1gb ALLOWANCE per month then it would not be an
&gt;issue I would sign up tomorrow. I know of people who are prepared to pay
&gt;200-300 a month for 1.5/1.5 MB with no caps.

Unfortunately, the people who want to pay 200-300 per month want to 
download 20-30 Gig per month of data. I've talked to some of them. 
Nope, still an order of magnitude away from economically rational in 
this country, keep ripping off the Telstra 'unlimited' plan until 
they catch you, if you really want to live like that. Enjoy the 
opportunity while it lasts.

&gt;Sorry for the length of the post, but I think I am reasonable as the data
&gt;content is getting fatter and the allowances/caps are a REAL pain and
&gt;providers setup costs OUCH!
&gt;

Your other option is ISDN data-over-voice. Convert your existing home 
phone line to ISDN "OnRamp Home Highway", it gives you two high 
quality analog ports into a digital box in your wall, a serial cable, 
and an ISDN S/T port.

You plug a Traverse NetJet PCI card (Linux drivers available) into 
the ISDN S/T port, program it to signal the ISDN call as 'voice', and 
call a DoV compatible ISP (guess who...). The OnRamp HH costs circa 
$38 per month including your first $5 worth of local calls (when 
signalled as voice, they are $0.18 plus GST each).

Bingo, on-demand 64k or 128k into your ISP, at $38 per month plus 
whatever your chosen ISP plan costs you.

Total monthly cost easily lower (depending on your ISP's plans). And 
available everywhere, unlike ADSL.

The options are out there.

Simon
