&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to share a concern I have at what I view as both an insidious and
&gt; particularly effective business strategy on the part of Microsoft to ensure
&gt; their total dominance in the computer industry for years to come ...

Perhaps. There are many people dedicated to seeing that this doesn't
happen.

&gt; It seems that Microsoft has been very effective at getting parts of their
&gt; MSCE and MSxx taught at schools and TAFEs (and perhaps institutions of
&gt; higher learning) around Australia, and perhaps the whole world.

Yes. There are High Schools (I believe Le Fevre High is one of them) in
Adelaide whose students end up with an MCP in around yr 10. We are doing
the same, but it's Certificates II, III and possibly IV in IT (and other
subjects, but I wouldn't want to get off topic).

&gt; While this is a legitimate business strategy, it has profound implications
&gt; for the future of the Australian computer industry and our children, in my
&gt; view.

Yep.

&gt; Perhaps the biggest effects are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. It creates a perception among future technologists that there is only
&gt;    one solution, one way of doing things: The Microsoft way.

I doubt that this will happen, there are too many people against it
(some even for the right reasons).

As a side note, It always made me sick to know the Microsoft's address
was 1 Microsoft way.

&gt; 2. It creates a nation of technology users, not technology producers.
&gt;    It seems to me that these people are then totaly dependent on
&gt;    someone else's technology, and are far less likely to create their
&gt;    own technology for our future benefit.


&gt; Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps Microsoft is the best thing since sliced bread,
&gt; and I have a perverse and wicked desire to find something bad in
&gt; Microsoft's generosity in having shared their wonderful technology with us
&gt; all, and if so, can someone please tell me so?

There isn't really anything wrong with being perverse. :-)

If Microsoft's products were the best thing since sliced bread, why are
people still using Unix?

Richard, this is the third e-mail like this I have read from you in as
many minutes. Is everything alright over there? :-)

Matt
