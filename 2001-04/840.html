G'day from the Coat-Hanger City,

I've got 3 &lt;18 girls staying at my place at the moment & when they sat
down at my OS/2 boxes to check their email, they thought they were Macs.
(Perhaps they saw similarities with the superb, Object-Orientated GUI on
OS/2 with the Mac...)

One of one of PCs even had the IBM Logo clearly visible on the CPU case!

One of them said, "Oh, if its not Windows, it must be a Mac" (!)

With young people leaving school with this mentality, we should be
scared, very scared.

Interestingly enough, with &lt;2 minutes instruction, the girls were
running ICQ on the OS/2 boxes & chatting to their friends, they didn't
really care it wasn't Windows.

People think they need Windows, but you push them, they'll concede that
they need functionality.

When I made my 1st Redhat Linux box it was easier than Win95:- all I did
was make sure the hardware I was using was supported on the install CD.

Demonstrating this & the excellent ListServ & Newsgroup support
available will make superior OSes much more attractive. Gee, it might
mean, young people might also unwittingly become literate!

&gt; Ok, I'll make some suggestions and flames can catch from there ;-)
&gt;
&gt; We can establish a working-party to promote Linux where we see it has a role. (I
&gt; would be happy to contrbute)
&gt; We can provide a framework of activities that will expose Linux to those who
&gt; would benefit from using it.
&gt; eg free talks to schools, community groups, IT support staff & managers, and
&gt; (flame jacket on)  we really really REALLY should use the LinuxSA web site in a
&gt; more proactive manner (read-support-portal) :-)
&gt; These types of activities may well be the best step in starting a LinuxSA support
&gt; network, who knows all contibs welcome.
