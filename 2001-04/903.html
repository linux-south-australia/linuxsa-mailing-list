&gt;  &gt; AUP has knocked off more people I know of (MP3 heads not s/w pirates)
&gt;  &gt; because they did 1.5 gb in a day.

Yes, but the AUP means that if you drive it hard enough, you wind up 
being disconnected for abusing the service.

You can either live that way (on the edge) or pay as you go with 
other ADSL providers. It's your choice.

The AUP is *very very* restrictive. Go and read it. It prohibits, for 
instance, attaching &gt; 1 machine to the service (i.e. that second 
ethernet card in your linux machine is a no-no). And allowing anyone 
other than your immediate family from using the service except under 
your direct personal supervision, and, and and and... they're trying 
to define the social environment in which you won't rip them off. 
Yeah, that'll work.

We don't choose to take the huge economic risk that Telstra is 
choosing with that product offering, it just isn't sensible for us to 
do.

&gt;  &gt; &gt;I'd go the 3 month contract ($400 inital fee, the only reason I dont
&gt;  &gt; &gt;have it yet), then $89 per month after that for 512k down 128k up.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Do you consider 400 reasonable setup?
&gt;
&gt;Not at all! We have a 1.5mbit adsl connection with linux here at work,
&gt;and all the installer did was plug the box in. Then as soon as he left I
&gt;removed the win2000 machine (which he told me "click next, next, next,
&gt;finish") and re-did it myself again with linux. $400 for pluging in a
&gt;box (and filters if you have voice on the line) is not fair at all. But
&gt;where are the other options (with unlimited throughput?) Im not in
support of them at all. But what choice do I have? :(

Oh, using us, and self-installing the ADSL hardware of your coice. 
You have that option (now).

By the way, the $400 didn't just include the site visit, it 
presumably included the network setup costs (remember, there is a 
whole network somewhere on the other side of that copper line). The 
same thing we charge circa $129-$149 for. That reflects real oncosts 
to us from Telstra, in the main.

&gt;  &gt; I think the power is/should be in the consumer buy your own modem or not
&gt;  &gt; subscribe for reasonable term or not at a fair price. That way if their
&gt;  &gt; service sucks you can kiss them goodbye and move to another provider. (btw:
&gt;  &gt; Internode's setup cost is ok)
&gt;
&gt;thats why I want the $400 install. Its a 3 month contract (most
&gt;expensive install) but when the contract is over the price per month
&gt;drops by $10 per month. I have been really happy with ozemails
&gt;reliability and speed for about 3 years, so I'm _hoping_ they have an
&gt;unlimited plan on adsl, which i'll swap to straight away when it comes
&gt;out.
&gt;

I predict they won't have, and that ultimately Telstra won't have 
either. At least not for a couple of years - at which point the 
incremental cost of bandwidth will be low enough that it might be 
viable to do an 'unlimited' offering (i.e. limited, but limited based 
on peak download capacity).

Most people don't want 'unlimited', they just don't want to see an 
excess bill - which is not the same thing. Enough people interpret 
'unlimited' as meaning 'hello, please abuse your ISP to death' - 
which is the (social) problem that makes 'unlimited' unsafe in 
general (for ISP's).

&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;My point to telstra exactly. Problem is the people you can talk to agree
&gt;  &gt; &gt;with you, and those that make these stupid rules are stashed in an
&gt;  &gt; &gt;office somewhere where you cant get em :(
&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; True and I am sure the 'senior ppl' have got unlimtied ADSL as part of
&gt;  &gt; their perks.

I doubt many of them have. They're too focussed on accumulating cash.
