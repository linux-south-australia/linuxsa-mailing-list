Hi Richard,
Whilst I've had horrendous setup problems with iPrimus ADSL, I am happy
to say that my service is now stable & reliable. Telstra, who run the
ADSL infrastructure, are now resetting the ADSL access concentrators
like an atomic clock at 9:02 each morning. The end result is your link
will drop at this time, but if you configure it for auto-reconnect it
will hook in instantly & stay connected until 9:02 the next morning.
It is DHCP, but my IP address has never changed.

I can help you with setup, *but* if it is a iPrimus issue, patience is
required.
When you call iPrimus support, expect to be on hold for over an hour.
It will then probably take another hour to demonstrate a network fault
using Windows, & get the support guy to be able to reproduce the problem
& then escalate your problem to the network Gurus.
However, it will get fixed within a day or 2.

I also had a dodgy PSTN line that took 3 different visits to fix, (hat
trick?).
Primus contract Telstra linesman to do all the installs/repairs.
Each visit was from a different Telstra linesman, each locating a
different fault & fixing it.

I use the PSTN line for our fax server & use Orange One CDMA phones for
telephony.
Unfortunately, the Orange One Service is only available in Melbourne &
Sydney.

Check:
<A HREF="http://www.primustel.com.au/jetstream/adsl/pricing.html">http://www.primustel.com.au/jetstream/adsl/pricing.html</A>

I'd go for the HomeJET 256/64 $84/month, 1000MB threshold, $324.50
install, its just dandy if you don't want a huge fat pipe.
(Remember what they say a about fat data pipes & the male appendage...)

I'm on an obsolete *unlimited data* 256/64 HomeJet 256/64, which costs
me $74/month plus $17.50 PSTN rental, making it $91.50/month, including
GST.

Remember to get the best rate iPrimus will have to be preselected for
you local & long distance calls.

Telstra have a much lower installation fee, so it would be worthwhile
punching in all the figures into a spreadsheet including your estimated
usage & the lower Telstra PSTN rental. You can then calculate your TCO.

Remember, if you choose to combine the ADSL bill with your PSTN bill &
choose the paperless Internet bill & payment option, you will save even
more money.

&gt; Basically, what I want is a permanent always-on connection, static IP,
&gt; faster than my modem, with no restrictions on what I can use it for, and
&gt; reasonable charges...
