&gt; Dear Brian
&gt; 
&gt; I have followed this tortuous thread with some interest, and at times marvelled at
&gt; the 'catfight' it seems to have engendered. Contributor 'Mark' is our network
&gt; manager and a Linux / Solaris devotee - and a fine one at that!

He's getting there :-).

&gt; After many years in the field, starting with the BBC Micro (and what a machine that
&gt; was, looking back), I had welcomed the development of IT from a mystical science,
&gt; full of posturing wizards who zealously guarded their secrets, into a relatively
&gt; friendly and open environment where the average enthusiast in schools had a good
&gt; chance of setting up a PC network using (for example) Lantastic, Novell or NT. Like
&gt; it or not, MS provided the impetus for the PC framework onto which most educational
&gt; software has attached itself, and there are many fine products - almost an infinite
&gt; supply at increasingly competitive prices.
&gt; 
&gt; The move to Linux etc. appears to have moved us some steps backwards, despite the
&gt; supposed 'low cost'. We now have to employ full-time network managers, and the
&gt; ability for the teacher to have a key role in running (or intergering with) systems
&gt; becomes increasingly remote.

Many would argue that you need to employ full-time network managers for
NT solutions.

&gt; Morover, the network manager may have a very different
&gt; perspective of the network and technical priorities compared to the teacher in the
&gt; classroom. We sometimes seem to be moving into 'computing for computing's sake'
&gt; rather than focussing on the needs of the end-user.

This is obviously something that needs to be spelt out at the time you
hire the network manager. It happened when I started here. The principal
just wanted to make sure that my priorities would fit into what the
school needed.

&gt; Linux is not easy to use.

I would disagree with that. I believe Sarah Balderoff has done some
fantastic things with Kids learning about Linux.

&gt; The mnemonic jargon which fills this list is evidence of
&gt; that.

NT lists are full of their jargon also. It doesn't make it any harder to
use. Most people would never need to touch the command line. A lot of
the stuff on this list is not exactly Linux specific, but refers to
standards which are used (and abused) by most operating systems.

&gt; OK, so network managers will look after all the background tasks, but, at the
&gt; end of the day, where is the software support?

The same place we get our Windows support. Books. Trial and Error.
Asking someone who knows.

&gt; The Gimp, Star Office, Logo (and a
&gt; multitude of banner-choked net sites) may be fine, but DTP, conventional (non-java)
&gt; programming, CD-ROM resources, CAD, and general K-12 curriculum support seem to be
&gt; poorly served.

There are still a few problems with Linux and Application support. They
are being overcome. If Linux was perfect, it would already be used
everywhere.

&gt; Could someone please 'put me right' and point me to some resources. Once the server
&gt; is up, and protected by its firewall, chatting to its clients and showering them
&gt; with easy email and net access, what are students in schools going to be doing
&gt; other than sending each other silly messages and cruising the net?

Theoretically, learning. If you lock down the network enough, you don't
even get them doing what you've just listed :-).

Matt
