<H1>Routing and Mgetty problem</H1>

Hi All,
    I am still struggling with my dialins and have narrowed
it down to a routing problem (I think). The story so far:
    I have a network that wants a dialin set up running
RH7.0. The network is connected to Telstra via a modem
running as ppp0 on ttyS1. The dialin is being set up as ppp1
on ttyS2. mgetty is doing the work of connecting etc. pap is
doing the authenticating. What happens is that mgetty
detects the incoming call and tells the modem to pickup. The
user then logs on and starts a ppp session. This is all
confirmed by the logs as happening. There is a nice stable
login and ppp connection happening. Here is where the
problem occurs.

    When I do a winipcfg on the dialin machine, it says that
both the local IP address and the Gateway address is the
same IP address as the assigned address from the server. I
cannot ping the server or anything else from the dialin
machine. Meanwhile on the other end of the connection the
server says that ppp1 is running with the correctly assigned
IP address. I can ping it and everything.

    Now obviously the problem has something to do with the
dialin machine having an IP address and Gateway address that
is the same, but I am not sure where I am running into
trouble here. The files I have modified are as follows:

/etc/inittab
added to <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
S2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mgetty ttyS2 -s 115200 -n 0

this should start mgetty listening to ttyS2, set the port
speed at 115200 and answer on 0 rings.

/etc/ppp/options
auth -chap +pap login modem crtscts debug proxyarp lock
ms-dns 139.130.4.4

this basically tells the ppp session to authenticate with
pap and a few other things and set the DNS to 139.130.4.4
(telstra DNS server)

/etc/ppp/options.ttyS2
xxx.xxx.218.118:xxx.xxx.218.121

Here is where I suspect there may be part of the problem.
This is supposed to set the local machine IP address:
assigned IP address

/etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config
/AutoPPP/ -     -       /usr/sbin/pppd auth -chap +pap login
debug

This actually starts the ppp session with the Windoze box

/etc/ppp/pap-secrets
#client     server     secret     remote IP addresses
username * passwd xxx.xxx.218.121

This is supposed to set the password and IP address for the
user.

The IP address and gateway that winipcfg sees is this last
address that is set in pap-secrets. If I leave out this
address then the user gets thrown off the system. I have
tried to set pap-secrets, and options.ttyS2 with the address
I want to assign, the server IP address and another address
in the IP range, but still I get the same problems - no
forwarding or routing of packets.

    If I tcpdump -n -i ppp1 host xxx.xxx.218.121 I get
traffic to the interface. If I tcpdump -n -i eth0 host
xxx.xxx.218.121, I get ZERO traffic.

    O.K. I hope this is enough info for somebody to help
out. I hope that it is something bleatingly obvious I have
missed as I am under a little time pressure here. Thanks in
advance for your help.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
