Hi Danny,

First off you need a partition for Win98 and then install it, make the 
partition yourself or Win98 will use the whole drive and make an extended 
partition using the rest of the drive. Linux will reside on smaller 
partitions inside the extended partition.

Win98 first, Linux second allows Linux to write to the boot record and set up 
its dual boot stuff.

When you start your Linux install it will ask you about partitions, you need 
a '/boot' partition, a '/' partition, and maybe a '/home' and '/usr'. The 
reason for so many partition is if (heaven forbid) you have a crash you'll 
hopefully be able to resurrect some of your stuff. I didn't have separate 
partitions and a huge crash took out everything.

Make a boot disk on installation as you may need to boot from it and change 
the line in lilo.conf from 'linear' to 'lba32', if your system doesn't 
recognise the larger drive size.

XFree 4.x supports the usb mouse but you may need kernel 2.4 for the ATA100. 
Let me know if you need any help with 'X'.

Robyn

&gt; I have a new 40gig WD 7200rpm ATA/100 which I need to install a WIN98

&gt; I have Mandrake 7.2, will this support the ATA/100 standard ?
&gt; Does Mandrake 7.2 have support for a USB MS intelli/optical mouse?
&gt;
&gt; I Use this setup for games as well, which is why I need a dual boot
&gt; drive... What partion sizes would be good for LINUX, I have had the MD7.2
&gt; running on a 1.2gig drive before ?
&gt; I have read before that it would be better to install WIN98 first,
&gt; True/False ?
&gt; Is there another format/partion that would be better than FDISK ?
&gt;
&gt; Extra Details:
&gt; Abit KT7
