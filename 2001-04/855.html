There's been a lot said on this topic lately -- it's the most active
thread I've seen in a while...

I think that from my point of view, Mark Collis and maybe Matthew
Geddes', UNIX in the school could significantly benfit the IT
Infrastructure.

A well setup, thought out Linux-based server end is more likely to have
less problems than the equivelant NT network. The TCO of a Linux based
server-backend is a lot less than NT or even Novell (I know that we've
downloaded nearly 2.5GB in Novell Service Packs over the last few
years).

Said Linux-based server backend does not have to be hard to administer,
either. Have you looked at e-Smith? It's probably not ideal for
everyone, but I've rolled it out to a few clients and have never had
problems with it. This machine was actually deployed remotely (I
installed the software on it and couriered it to their office. It worked
first time.)

Nice, clear web based interfaces _do_ exist. They are a bit obscure, I
admit. A lot could be done for the schools if they were to use Linux.
Not that much work would be required on the part of the 'Consultant'
(person that set it up) to make it self sufficient.

I don't think that anyone here is suggesting that giving the 'Computer
Teacher' a PocketBook and RedHat CD is the answer to our problems, but
the principle of using Linux is of great benefit to the schools.

Would people be interested if I setup a mailing list for 'the promotion
of Linux in Education'? I want Linux/UNIX to work in Education. I know
it can, I just don't think that this is clear enough... Yet.

This is one of the most important issues that the IT Community at large
is going to have to deal with. Education is what our future(s) stem
from. Let's not mess it up with the help of monopolising corporate
evils.
