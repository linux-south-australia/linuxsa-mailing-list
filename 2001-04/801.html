&gt; &gt; David!(what is with the exclamation mark??)
&gt; 
&gt; When placed on a line by itself, I mark the vocative with an exclamation
&gt; mark. For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, one uses the
&gt; vocative case when addressing someone. A particularly old-fashioned way
&gt; of using this case is to say "O Jason!"...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But the school would have to have no new IT equipment for three years to
&gt; &gt; get those machines, wheras as they can by 20pcs a year if they go for
&gt; &gt; wintel and use them straight away witht eh aplciations software they have
&gt; &gt; already paid for on a per head basis, which is kind of useful.
&gt; 
&gt; I actually agree with you, but my point is that it's not impossible.
&gt; Just not easily possible now.

Hey in the future anythgin is possible but we are talking baout now arnet
we?

&gt; &gt; And they still wont have anyone to admin it, which makes it kind of
&gt; &gt; useless.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, they don't at the moment so what's the difference?

The difference is that typcially they can get usage out of the win PC
right now with the knowledge they have.

Throw new systems at them and it migth take abother 10 years to get any
worthwhile usage out of them.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In any case the point was that teh amounts of money that were being talked
&gt; &gt; baout are compeltelty unrealisticand unrepresenttive for most state
&gt; &gt; schools even if they did represent comparitevly good value for money for
&gt; &gt; the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Unrealistic, yes. Dissappointing too though.
&gt; 

Yeah but we live in this world, so we need to live with disapointment.
