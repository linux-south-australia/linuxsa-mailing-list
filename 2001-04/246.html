Thank you for the entertaining read.

As a fellow newbie, I also find the newer releases of Linux (currently
running Mandrake 7.2) to be better than any offering Master Gates and his
cronies have thus far released.

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;
&gt; After reading a lot of hype how Linux would never be part of the general
&gt; communities preferred OS and that it was for nerds and geeks etc etc and
&gt; that windoze was so easy to install and use blah blah blah...I thought my
&gt; recent experience with a complete hard drive crash may be of interest to
&gt; some of the other linux newbies, and not so newbies, out there.
&gt;
&gt; The story so far...After years of putting up with the M$hite, our intrepid
&gt; adventurer decides to travel to the land of the penguin to see what all
the
&gt; fuss is about.  After many harrowing episodes, too gruesome to recall, our
&gt; weary traveller finally climbs his way to the top of Steep Learning Curve.
&gt; Yes folks, that dreaded mountain so feared by the M$laves who lament that
&gt; tackling this climb is foolhardy and unnecessary as the great god Gate$
has
&gt; provided ease of use and Plug&Play for all his loyal drones.
&gt;
&gt; There, at the foot of Tux, our battered traveller takes a deep breath and
&gt; rests.  Confident in the thought that Gate$ and M$hite are safely locked
&gt; away in dual boot land our convert decides to explore this new land
&gt; inhabited by the great magician Mandrake.  Ahh, but the Black Prince of
the
&gt; Dark Partition, he who sports the feared Blue Screen of Death as his
emblem,
&gt; hasn't given up easily, no not by a mega byte.  Lurking in the shadows,
near
&gt; the mystical region known as the MBR, where the Keeper of The Gate known
&gt; generally as LiLo or, more amusingly, The Grub, resides the Black Prince,
&gt; aided by his cunning right hand man General Command Failure, wait for
their
&gt; opportunity to strike.
&gt;
&gt; Without warning, during the ceremonial ritual that is the reinstall of a
new
&gt; OS, disaster strikes.  Somehow the Black Prince and his god Gate$ smash
&gt; through the MBR spewing their evil bytes and corrupting all that stand in
&gt; their way.  The Keeper of The Gate, despite his most valiant efforts
cannot
&gt; sustain the fight and his land is over run by their most insidious weapon
&gt; that is the Reformat Monster  (eeekkk and shrieek).
&gt;
&gt; Within minutes, all that was good lay in tatters before our bemused
&gt; traveller.  LiLo, or the Grub, has been defeated, the MBR has mysteriously
&gt; vanished and all was lost.   As news of the visit of the Reformat Monster
&gt; spread, how our poor traveller was castigated and  bludgeoned by his once
&gt; loyal family.  "You lost how much of my work?" and "All my precious
windoze
&gt; work is gone, oh how could you".  Suddenly, the spectre of the Great
Divorce
&gt; descended upon our ever valiant explorer.   Nothing for it he muses, and
&gt; looking down at his feet he sees that his shoes have come undone, time for
a
&gt; complete and proper new boot strapping.
&gt;
&gt; And so it was to be.  Well folks all that to tell you that after a
complete
&gt; disk failure and the need to reinstall absolutely everything, I found that
&gt; the M$hite wasn't as smooth sailing as it is made out to be.  Without
going
&gt; into all the specifics the windoze reinstall was a real pain in the
&gt; proverbial.  I had to search the net for a new set of drivers for my video
&gt; card (while working in a max of 16 colors and 640X480 mode).  Plug&Play
&gt; failed to properly recognise my Sony Monitor and configuring my modem was
&gt; also a pain as I couldn't find the original driver disk.  My printer also
&gt; could not be loaded and another search of the net for appropriate drivers.
&gt; Some programs that had been backed up did not go over properly and I had
to
&gt; beg some software to replace some stuff that was lost and could not be
&gt; recognised by M$hite.  The full restore etc and getting some stuff back
&gt; (bugga all really) took the better part of a week!!! This was totally
&gt; unbelievable.
&gt;
&gt; A reinstall of MDK 7.2 took about 40 minutes, with a further 2 hours
&gt; downloading some programs (via a 56K modem) I was up and running in one
&gt; evening. No drivers to find or replace everything was recognised perfectly
&gt; and my video card magically set at 1028X740.  Only my stoopid printer,
which
&gt; is a dinosaur Lexmark doesn't work (but then again it never has).  Now try
&gt; and tell me that M$hite is for the masses and I'll tell you that is all a
&gt; total load of M$hite.  So hang in there newbie types I think it is well
&gt; worth the effort and the stuff I learnt along the way is truly eye
opening.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt; your weary traveller.
