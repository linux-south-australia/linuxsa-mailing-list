The aim is gentle encouragement to consider running a NAT gateway 
sharing that single static IP (available from us for $400 for quite a 
nice one), or running a Linux box as a gateway (surely the first 
choice of everyone on -this- list!) or else paying $240 per annum if 
you really can't live inside one IP and you want us to provide you 
with more statics.

Alternatively, if you have your own IP ranges and/or feel like 
joining APNIC to get your own (only several thousand US$ per annum), 
we can route your own address ranges for you - but we need you to use 
a real ADSL CPE unit in this case (cisco 827) rather than an ethernet 
bridge.

This is explained in a bit more detail in the faq/information section 
of the <A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A> site.

There are stupid background IP overheads caused by Telstra (as I see 
that Mark has explained in other email already) which mean we really 
do want to try to encourage people to live in one IP if feasible.

We're trying to encourage IP address preservation here, but if you 
-really- want 5 IP's, we're able to supply them to you, and that has 
an additional service fee. That's all.

Its a free country. You can pay even less to Telstra and get zero 
static IP's on your ADSL service if you want to :)

I'd be interested to hear whether people really would prefer to have 
5 static IP's versus one static one and whether that $240 per annum 
is a barrier to takeup or not.

Yes, the $20 per month is a commercial decision to encourage IP 
address efficiency, but nothing's immutable - I'm open to comments 
and I'm listening to them. However I'd like to point out that in the 
real world, $20 per month for such an additional feature is not 
unusual at all (indeed cheaper than the equivalent offerings from the 
few other ISP's that offer static allocation options on ADSL).

&gt;Generally I think the pricing is reasonable, but $20/month for four
&gt;(additional) IP addresses?  $5/month *each*?
