&gt; :)...I LOVE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE,...JUST look at you .

I think we're alright, what's to look at?

&gt; We Americans have a fascination with the ' down under wonder' and it stems 
&gt; from the easy way you all have with ,...well...' telling it like it is ' 
&gt; even when it ' isn't '.

Sorry, what's your point? We are telling it like it is. There's not any
doubt in the minds of those who -actually work in Australian education-
that the Microsoft Way is not the only and most beneficial way.

Please be sure to make comments that are based on fact next time, Mr
Tutinean.

&gt; But, check this out.....I have read all your posts on this matter of the MS 
&gt; curriculum,...quite intense that  Mr. Reid. But has anyone noticed how often 
&gt; in human history,..people have always come up with the money and resources 
&gt; to do something WRONG very well and do it wrong for a very long time!!

People do that all the time. There are also those among us that try
there very best to do things right. Not just for themselves, either. I
do this not for myself, but in the hope that my sucessors enjoy the best
that Technology has to offer, rather than the feeble limitted subset
that Microsoft offers.

&gt; And,...the people behind it all- how they frequently are the LAST people you 
&gt; would want to be stuck on a desert island with BUT they almost ALWAYS get 
&gt; the big break!!!.........just sayin' hello.Ya'll come visit...

While your comments on human tendancies over time and desert islands are
all very interesting, they're not relevant to the topic.

Call me superficial, but I've not been able to work out the deep and
meaningful message that you've hidden ever-so-well in this message.

Some times I just shake my head and wonder...
