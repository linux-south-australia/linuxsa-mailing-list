&gt; Sorry, could you explain how DNS would be the problem when you cant login to
&gt; a computer via its terminal?

I did explain why a misconfigured resolver could affect the telnet.
Your friend asked for any suggestions; I gave one.  If you don't like it
then ignore it, but don't debate the point with me without first trying
what I suggested.

I will add this: You are quite right that my guess doesn't explain
why a local login would fail.  Two reasons: first, I can't think of
a convincing reason why a local login would "hang" before asking for
the password; and two, I don't know how your friend has configured
his machine.  For all I know he's trying to mount /etc/passwd via NFS
(in which case I go back to DNS.)  Anyway, an educated guess for half
the problem seems a better place to start than making no guess.  Take
it or leave it.
