Hi Richard, my 0.2c worth.
Using doc_book is not easy as you would have discovered by now especially with
the CVS controls, its probably a bit of a handful.  Using word (supplied and
sponsored by Satan :-)) will IMHO be easier to use but still not easy.  If you
take Lyx as an example of a document processor rather than a word processor you
can start to gauge just how much time and effort go into maintaining a 'word'
based document, eg style layout, section footers and so on.  Word does not make
it easy or pretty, its time and energy spent formatting that could be better
spent on content.

Now add to that the overall picture of a MS dominated future and we may add it
up and come down on the side of not using MS but accepting a more unusual way to
achieve the same result.  It's your call and you will lose and benefit in
different document process, either way good luck and let us know how it turned
out.  ( a page or two of the project and problems would be nice)

Personally I think Lyx is by far the best tool to use for large documents bar
none.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I have been engaged in a large documentation project, producing some 350
&gt; pages of technical documentation over the last few weeks, and will be going
&gt; on to produce several hundred more over the next few weeks.
&gt;
&gt; I opted to use DocBook because I can put the source in CVS (and thus do
&gt; version control and have multiple people working on the documentation), it
&gt; is SGML, which is almost XML, and I have lots of control over the final
&gt; output, because I can change the stylesheets rather than changing the
&gt; document, if I want to change the look and feel.
&gt;
&gt; However, it requires a fair degree of sophistication to maintain the
&gt; documentation.
&gt;
&gt; Then someone suggested to me that the latest version of Word does version
&gt; control, can include documents, etc, and can generally do everything I
&gt; want. Also, with word, I can use someone straight out of high school to
&gt; maintain the documentation. Thus, there is less of a maintenance issue.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone else have any views on this?
&gt;
&gt; Regards
