&gt;RESPECTFULLY:
:)...I LOVE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE,...JUST look at you .
We Americans have a fascination with the ' down under wonder' and it stems 
from the easy way you all have with ,...well...' telling it like it is ' 
even when it ' isn't '.
But, check this out.....I have read all your posts on this matter of the MS 
curriculum,...quite intense that  Mr. Reid. But has anyone noticed how often 
in human history,..people have always come up with the money and resources 
to do something WRONG very well and do it wrong for a very long time!! 
And,...the people behind it all- how they frequently are the LAST people you 
would want to be stuck on a desert island with BUT they almost ALWAYS get 
the big break!!!.........just sayin' hello.Ya'll come visit...

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hmmm. Sounds about right. Did he contact you, or did you contact him? I
&gt; &gt; think if we have some kind of idea about the way to get things done and
&gt; &gt; take it to his successot(s), we'd have more chance. It would help if it
&gt; &gt; wasn't going to cost much as well. :-).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To Sarah, Greg and other AUUG people, where does AUUG fit into this?
&gt;
&gt;Nowhere yet.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Does AUUG have an opinion or ideas on the matter, or do AUUG prefer to
&gt; &gt; keep out of such things?
&gt;
&gt;No.  No.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Join AUUG and find out. Or Join AUUG and make AUUG fit into this where 
&gt;you
&gt; &gt;&gt; think appropriate.
&gt; &gt;&gt; :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For those of you who weren't at the last LinuxSA meeting, everyone's
&gt; &gt; invited to the next AUUG-SA meeting (9 May, 7 PM, Marcellina's
&gt; &gt; Restaurant). I don't think there would be a problem of mentioning this
&gt; &gt; as an `agenda' item....
&gt;
&gt;Agreed.  Judging by the number of messages on the subject (which I'm
&gt;still reading), it's obviously a popular topic.
&gt;
&gt;So what's AUUG's opinion?  As I said, we currently don't have one.
&gt;Certainly the SA chapter's opinion or level of involvement is allowed
&gt;to be different from that of the national organization.  I think that
&gt;we should do something, but I don't have a really clear idea what.
&gt;This is obviously something to discuss at the next meeting.
&gt;
&gt;In that connection, however, note that the AUUG has applied for
&gt;membership of the IT council of SA, so we should be in a position to
&gt;exert some influence.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, if you want me to reply to any message, please copy me explicitly
&gt;on the message: I get between 1000 and 2000 messages a day, and though
&gt;I try to get through them all, I can miss some.  mutt flags messages
&gt;copied to me, so I read them first (if at all :-)
