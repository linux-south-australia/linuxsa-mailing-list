&gt; LaTeX has gone through some really nasty changes in the last 15 years

&gt; from versionitis like word-processors.

There is something to this. It is a fact that TeX has had close to zero
bugs in twenty years and LaTeX has had lots of bugs, like any normal
software package. However it isn't quite as clear-cut as that:

  - Does anyone know of any broad-ranging LaTeX version incompatibilities?
    All I know of is individual templates. But then I'm not a LaTeX
    expert. An individual template breaking isn't like the Word
    incompatibility problem. Annoying, yes. But fixable with a few mods.
    And I don't get the impression that any of the LaTeX2 releases
    have had these problems anyway.

  - Such problems can always be fixed. Ie if it is worth thousands to a
    company then the problem can be fixed. At least some of the Word/
    WordPerfect/etc versioning problems can't be fixed no matter how many
    millions you have.

  - LaTeX can always be reduced to TeX (even if consecutive versions of
    LaTeX have incompatibilities as they did some time ago, the fabled TeX 
    compatabilty means that you haven't lost the ability to process the
    document with the tools of the future or the tools of the past.)

&gt; Some people still do use plain TeX.

True, I overgeneralised. But not by much :-)
