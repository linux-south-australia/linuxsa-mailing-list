&gt; &gt; Or use Ximian's red-carpet updater.  It's still beta, but it's the nicest
&gt; &gt; package management tool I've seen on Linux.  Ximian haven't released their
&gt; &gt; enhanced 1.4 packages yet - I'm waiting for them rather than the normal GNOME
&gt; &gt; rpms, as they add some sparkle to icons etc :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, Ximian do not support distributions that do not use RPM or
&gt; dpkg package management systems.  This means that users of Slackware are
&gt; unable to use Ximian in a natively packaged format - sure, one could use
&gt; rpm2tgz on the Red Hat 6.2 packages, or mv rpm to rpm.bin and then create
&gt; a script called rpm that runs rpm.bin with --force --nodeps, which would
&gt; even allow one to use the Ximian updater, but this is not a real solution,
&gt; and there is always a chance anomolies between RH6.2 and
&gt; Slackware.  Slackware-current is wholly glibc-2.2 based, so when that is
&gt; released as a stable version, there will be no similar supported system by
&gt; Ximian whose packages could be used.

Ximian has commisioned a survey to find out a few things about Linux
users - one of them being what distros you would like them to support. 
They also provided "free form" text feedback, so I'm sure your concerns
about Slackware could be raised in that forum.

&gt; The problem, they say, is with dependancy checking - the Slackware package
&gt; system does not support it, so Ximian have no immidiate plans to support
&gt; Slackware.  This is not a problem, as one can just download the GNOME
&gt; tarballs (hence my need to find an Australian GNOME mirror site), or wait
&gt; for it to be packaged in Slackware.  I've read some posts in the
&gt; Slackware.com forums, one particularly by Pat V (the lead developer) that
&gt; states that there should not be a problem for Ximian in implementing
&gt; a Slackware distribution.  I'm not sure what this would require for
&gt; Ximian, so I am really in any position to state on this.  However, with
&gt; the advent of Red Carpet, things should become easier - as far as I am
&gt; aware (having not tried it yet) it deals with dependancies itself, so all
&gt; that would be required is some sort of (XML?) file or simple database that
&gt; tells the dependancies of the slackware Ximian GNOME packages, and Red
&gt; Carpet would look at this.  Probably far more is required, especially
&gt; concerning the updating of system packages.

I guess Ximian's aim is to provide a useable desktop that is easy for
"dummies" to use and update, hence things like red-carpet.  You are
right in saying they could do their own dependency checking tool inside
red-carpet, but since it's currently still in beta you can understand
why they've chosen to use rpm and that dependency checking system (at
least to start with, afterall why re-invent the wheel)

Their work in sysadmin maintenance - providing a common interface for
admin across many different distros, and even oses (ie Solaris) is a
good step in the direction of cross-platform support.  I'm sure they're
not against slackware, but if "most Linux users" use an RPM-derived
dsitro you can forgive them for aiming at that market first.

&gt; It would be nice if Ximian released source tarballs of their modified
&gt; GNOME packages, so those on unsupported platforms would be able to
&gt; experience their improvements.

There are source rpms available.  I'm sure that you could use
alien/rpm2tar or whatever to get your tgz's.

I am dumb - most of the time I'm playing smart.
