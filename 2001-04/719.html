&gt; &gt; P.S. Dan Shearer: Whatever happened to that guy from the state
&gt; &gt; government who was claiming to be pushing for this stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; No idea. But I posted his official contact details I believe. I also
&gt; pointed him to URLs in the LinuxSA mail archive directly bearing on his
&gt; claimed interests, strongly advising him to respond. I never heard any
&gt; more.

I e-mailed him a couple of times, as I was interested to see what it was
that he thought could/should be done (I'm happy to work towards
something like this, but I don't think I'm very creative when it comes
to marketing :-)).

&gt; However I'd also say that in any time period greater than 6 months there
&gt; is probably a new department, task force or mission charged with doing
&gt; somethingorother to the software industry in this state, so it is probably
&gt; worth starting again.

Hmmm. Sounds about right. Did he contact you, or did you contact him? I
think if we have some kind of idea about the way to get things done and
take it to his successot(s), we'd have more chance. It would help if it
wasn't going to cost much as well. :-).

To Sarah, Greg and other AUUG people, where does AUUG fit into this?
Does AUUG have an opinion or ideas on the matter, or do AUUG prefer to
keep out of such things?

Sorry about the vast number of postings, but I feel quite strongly about
some of this stuff.

Thx,
Matt
