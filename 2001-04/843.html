I admit this is how I originally discovered Linux -
with a pocket book.  However, I always thought MS was
crap - so I was not turned off by unfriendly IT
people.

The only reason I did not get in to Unix and Linux
earlier was the superior attitude of many IT people
I met in university when I was studying something
completely unrelated (politics).  They often rolled 
their eyes and almost laughed when I asked a silly
question.

This, frankly, is what turns a lot of potential
converts off Unix and Linux.  It has a bad image
associated with it - still to this day - that Linux
is for people who are either geeks or like to think
they are superior.

MS - whatever we like to say - actually listen to the
consumer.  Yes, the charge the Earth for that privelage
but they still listen.  Even the average man on the
street can us MS and not feel like an idiot if they
have to ask a question.

&gt;It's for sale in virtually every Newsagent I have visited. There's the
&gt;APC PocketBook, the PC Mag Pocketbook and I just noticed a "Next" Guide
&gt;Book.
