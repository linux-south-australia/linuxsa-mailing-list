&gt; As long as there is a fix to the inoperational modem problem, and you have a
&gt; firewall between the modem and the rest of your machines, you're ok, right?

Depending on your situation, I dont think you even need to fix the
modem.
 
&gt; Also, one thing here confuses me -- does the ADSL modem have an IP Address?

Yes, usually 10.0.0.138. But you can only get to if from your ethernet
side.

&gt; To be honest, I expected it not to -- I thought that it would/could be
&gt; IP-invisible... ie: from the ethernet plugged in to my end of it, I see the
&gt; ISP's network, and from their end, they see my machine... I guess not, as
&gt; it's a router. So now my mental impression of it is as follows (at least in
&gt; my planned configuration):
&gt; 
&gt; (note that "int" always means on my side, and "ext" is on the internet's
&gt; side)
&gt; 
&gt;  My LAN (192.168.1.x)
&gt;          |
&gt;      hub/switch
&gt;          |
&gt;  My Gateway (int: 192.168.1.1)
&gt;          |  (ext: [1])
&gt;          |
&gt;    ADSL Modem/router (int: [2])
&gt;          |           (ext: [3])
&gt;          |
&gt; --------------------------------
&gt;       Phone network etc
&gt; --------------------------------
&gt;          |
&gt;     ISP Router (int: [4])
&gt;          |
&gt;      THE INTERNET
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I expected [1] to be my assigned IP address (whether dynamic or static),
&gt; [2] and [3] to be nothing, and [4] to be the ISP's router address, as per a
&gt; normal dialup connection.
&gt; 
&gt; However, now, I think [1] is my assigned IP address, [2] and [3] are the
&gt; same, being my router/gateway address, and 4 is the ISP's router address, as
&gt; per a normal dialup connection...

Nope. The modem doesnt have ips that are actually used in normal
operation. Only 10.0.0.138 for configuration. Normally you wouldnt touch
it.
 
&gt; Hmm... I also think I'm a little confused... As Simon said earlier,
&gt; Internode, to give out one static IP, will use 4 real addresses... I guess
&gt; these are [1], [2,3], broadcast and reserved. yah? What about with a dynamic
&gt; scheme? how would one do that? I'd be expecting that there would be no
&gt; difference... Can you do this with only using 1 IP address?

NFI
 
My understanding of the security is this:

To access the modem from the outside world you need to use an echo port
of a machine on the inside. If you have a linux box or firewall on the
inside blocking access to the rest of your lan and that has no echo port
then I dont think you can tamper with it externally. If you _do_ have an
open echo port then an attacker can send a udp packet to the echo port
from 255.255.255.255 and it it'll bounce of a machine on your inside
network and that packet can rewrite the modems config. If you have a
linux firewall then echo probably isnt open anyway and if it is you can
disable it from inetd.conf easily enough.

It is hackable from the adsl line, but only if you have adsl equipment
and sneak around in the streets at night and aligator clip some your
hacking hardware to the line. Apparently if you had enough electronics
experience and a spare adsl modem you could get the required chips from
it and build such a device, but unless you expect industial espionage
from people with secret labs and lots of money to devote to it, I think
you'd be ok in this regard.
