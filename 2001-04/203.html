&gt; &gt; Sometimes you just need to start from scratch with a new system and
forget
&gt; &gt; about the old one.
&gt;
&gt; I disagree.  Sometimes you need to start again from the standard
definition
&gt; and forget about the old implementation.

OK, replace my work 'system' in the above sentence with 'implementation',
which is actually what I meant, and we are saying the some thing. I didn't
mention anything about having the same 'external interface' or perhaps a
better term might be 'API', which I probably should have.

What I think David meant was that the bind 9 library functions (which
programs would be compiled against) are not compatible for programs compiled
against bind 8. Hopefully, if you migrated from bind 8 to bind 9, you would
only have to recompile the offending program, so that it is linked against
the new library. David was saying you wouldn't be able to remove the bind 8
libraries until you have done that, right?
