Co-incidentally, this is about the third time in as many days that someone
has said something like this in my hearing.

At least one company makes a living by selling this service,
www.linbox.com. I've been to their place and tried it out and it really
does work.

&gt; &gt; Or, how about if we came up with a Zero Administration Linux (MS was
&gt; &gt; using the "Zero Administration" buzzword a while back to sell it's stuff
&gt; &gt; to schools). It would be possible to have a distribution that asked very
&gt; &gt; few questions and locked itself down real tight. Then nobody would need
&gt; &gt; to spend much money. I mean it would be *Another* Linux distribution,
&gt; &gt; but if it served a purpose....
&gt; 
&gt; But it doesn't need to be ANOTHER Linux distribution. It can be an
&gt; auto-install RedHat/Debian/Caldera/yada yada distribution.

Yep, that's what Linbox do.
