&gt; I have already put my request in for the boxed official
&gt; version from www.everythinglinux.com - if anyone would
&gt; like a copy - let me know..
&gt; 
&gt; What is the situation with copying official versions
&gt; anyhow?  I figure that it is okay - as I am still
&gt; supporting the industry and what I am recieving for my
&gt; funds is support rather than software (and a warm
&gt; fuzzy feeling).

Yep, the official version should really be called the boxed version as
the cds will be the same as if you download the isos from the net. I
started a couple of wgets on different pcs this morning to get this
release, but funnily enough, most the places that mirror it are down or
maxed out in connections. I think there would be a hell of a lot of
people world wide trying to download this release right now (I heard,
unconfirmed, that mandrake has been outselling redhat for a while now?)

&gt; I strongly urge those who can afford to do so to
&gt; purchase Linux though - I believe in supporting this
&gt; worthwhile cause as much as others are against
&gt; not commercialising Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not reward a job well done?

Exactly. It costs them money to make it, and while I dont agree in
companys like microsoft ripping megabucks out of people I think they
(mandrake) deserve enough cash to pay thier wages and make a fair
profit. They are doing a lot to bring linux to the masses by generally
making a nicer and easier disto without limiting the power of people who
want to edit the conf files themselves and get thier hands dirty. I
thought mandrake 7.2 (while not perfect) had a much more sensible
interface and defaults than redhats efforts of late.
