Sorry to say that I did choose to use the word 'cap' in the pricing 
for the ADSL product, Mark :)

Yes, to make this clear (though I thought that the sentence 
equivalent to 'downloads in excess of the monthy cap are charged at 
$0.18 per Mb did make it clear) - you can download as much as you 
want, we just ask that you pay for what you use beyond the included 
amount.

Doesn't seem unfair to me. I appreciate that Internet charging space 
is not the same as the real world of economics, however (and rather 
than opening that can of worms, I refer y'all to the 
thrashed-to-death 'unlimited' topic in the list archives :) )

Maybe I ought to change the word we use on our ADSL pricing - even 
though I did explain what it mean in plain english in several places. 
The word might indeed have some strange connotations.

How about 'included downloads'?

&gt;  &gt; I guess everyone has their own specific needs/wants regarding provision of
&gt;  &gt; broadband services. And yes, I have my own too.
&gt;  &gt; I think Internode fall short in a couple of areas. (Sorry Simon)
&gt;  &gt; 1. the allowance/cap is still too low it should be minimum of 1gb/month
&gt;
&gt;There's a 1.5 Gbyte/month option.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; 2. The setup costs are fine
&gt;  &gt; 3. The monthly access should be no more than 80 it's more than BP now (I
&gt;  &gt; understand the wholesale price issue)
&gt;
&gt;Don't compare apples with oranges:  you get a better package than BP
&gt;delivers too.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; I guess in the end if I could get ADSL 256/64 for 200 install, 75/month,
&gt;  &gt; without the cap or with a 1gb ALLOWANCE per month then it would not be an
&gt;  &gt; issue I would sign up tomorrow. I know of people who are prepared to pay
&gt;  &gt; 200-300 a month for 1.5/1.5 MB with no caps.
&gt;
&gt;Hang on -- Do you think there's actually a cap in the sense that it
&gt;stops working after that many megabytes?
&gt;
&gt;Oh, wow - there might be a perception issue here:  "cap" isn't a word
&gt;Internode uses in the materials published for this service, it's a word
&gt;which someone else on this list has introduced.  To clarify:  You can
&gt;download as much as you want with no restrictions whatsoever, with the
&gt;proviso that megabytes downloaded in excess of the amount included in
&gt;your price plan will be charged at $0.18 each (which, I might add, is
&gt;cheaper than Telstra's retail megabyte rates).
&gt;
&gt;If you think you'll use 2 Gbytes/month, then you can get onto the
&gt;1.5 Gbyte/month plan and pay an extra $90 per month (500 Mbytes * 
&gt;0.18c/Mbyte).
&gt;
&gt;Note that other Internode permanent link price plans are available on
&gt;these services too:  If you think you'll regularly do very high data
&gt;volumes, the sales staff can put you on a non-standard price plan.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Sorry for the length of the post, but I think I am reasonable as the data
&gt;  &gt; content is getting fatter and the allowances/caps are a REAL pain and
&gt;  &gt; providers setup costs OUCH!
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps we're thinking of different things when we hear the word "cap".
