It's really not that difficult to understand.  MS are market leaders, have
products that are used by business, is installed on most new computers, so its
not hard to understand why its part of the curriculum or why staff feel
comfortable teaching and using it. People use what they are comfortable with and
MS fits the bill.
Next, I know many of the IT managers in the education dept. all the ones I know
are MS trained and (read above) are happy to use MS stuff.  Why on earth would
they want to use anything else if it works?

Now, on the other hand there are numerous IT support staff who use Linux and BSD
for minor activities and who would be quite happy to support linux if and when
required.  There just has to be the need.  I could go on but this topic has been
beaten to death on other websites, look there for a more in depth discussion.

Rapid fire comments:

There has to be a need (one is forming and quickly)
Businesses have to use it (education is driven by business, YES!!! it is) (sad
but welcome to corporate-life)
If considered in context it must replace MS capability (think back, IBM or clone
PC both do the same only the name is different)
Cost must be considered (if Linux cost the same as MS it would most likely have
died at birth)
Demand for Linux needs to be proven (desktop, as that's where the bulk of users
will end up)

On another note, TAFE is most decidedly moving Linux into its training
curriculum, in fact I wrote two  module Learning Activity Guides (LAGS) 4N5 and
4N2 for state based training that use Linux only for network security,
intranet's and networking.
The educational basis? open standards and sound statistical evidence (Apache
usage, Sendmail Linux/BSD BIND and market share)  Remember, managers don't want
and probably can't make decisions based on hearsay and gut feeling, to cover
their butts they need evidence and if more people in the Linux game used that
approach instead of religious fervor we may just accelerate the change.

And it's much safer (not completely) for the educational staff to make changes
to what is booted up on a machine (not physically, educational content based)
than administrators, after all we can come up with reasons based on sound
educational practice (sometimes)



Best wishes

&gt; Aaaaaah yes, ack, I've experienced the joys of this...  Being the
&gt; Administrator of my school last year & start of this year, I *almost* got a
&gt; Linux Debian server, and *almost* got all the machines to be dualboot
&gt; w95/corel linux.  The idea was for students to learn as many OS's as
&gt; possible, thereby putting them at an advantage in IT.  Corel Linux aint that
&gt; hard to learn, first user functionality is just like Windows, really.  And
&gt; the added feature being that my school uses a lot of Corel products anyway,
&gt; and there are versions (or up-coming versions) available of their graphics
&gt; software for Linux.
&gt;
&gt; However things at the school blew up, *long* story, in the end I left the
&gt; school...  so yeah, all win98 / Win2K Server now. :(  It seems Microsoft are
&gt; very dominatiant in the education arena, which would have an influence of
&gt; some kind on people going through these institutions.
&gt;
&gt; And seeing as most people use and accept M$ products, and most people really
&gt; couldnt be bothered learning everything over again with another OS ("This
&gt; works, why change?").. they wont.  They'll think the fact their computer
&gt; continually freezes/crashes is just part of using a computer. Sad really.
&gt;
&gt; I have also been continually told by schools that "We use Windows because
&gt; thats whats best to use.  If you want to use something else, wait until
&gt; Uni.".
&gt;
&gt; Shocking attitude imo, but lets just hope Linux prevails on the desktop and
&gt; becomes maybe a good an alternative and a competitor as OS/2 was once.
&gt; (Still beats me why Windows won really.. OS/2 rocked).
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, thats my 2 cents :)
