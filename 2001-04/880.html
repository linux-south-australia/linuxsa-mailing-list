Hi all.

During boot-up, my RH 6.2 box displays errors when it tries to load the 
following two modules (which are present in their correct directories):

- when trying to load the 53c7,8xx.o module (for my scanner's SCSI card) I 
get a "Device or resource busy" error;

and

- loading the module for the ethernet card brings up the following 
message:  "Bringing up interface eth0 insmod: 
/lib/modules/2.2.14-12/net/rtl8139.o : insmod eth0 failed"


Some background info:

With the ethernet card, when I log in as root and do "insmod rtl8139" the 
module loads and works OK - so, why doesn't the module load during boot-up?

As for the SCSI card's module, once logged in as root "insmod 53c7,8xx" 
brings the same "Device or resouce busy error" as before.  During boot-up 
there is also a message about attempting to load the module, but the next 
line says something like: "scsi: 0 hosts"!?

I created a new isapnp file (the original file only contains my sound card 
details) and (after some editing of the file) re-named it isapnp.conf (I 
think that was its name).  On re-booting, I found that my mouse was no 
longer detected!  On re-instating the previous .conf file, my system 
returned to its previous state.

With the SCSI card, I suspect that there is something in the .conf file 
that I have to be very careful with when I get to the uncommenting stage, 
but I'm not sure what is happening with the ethernet card.

Any pointers/suggestions are most appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Peter
