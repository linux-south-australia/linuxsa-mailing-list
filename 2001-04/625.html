&gt;OK, I expected [1] to be my assigned IP address (whether dynamic or static),
&gt;[2] and [3] to be nothing, and [4] to be the ISP's router address, as per a
&gt;normal dialup connection.
&gt;
&gt;However, now, I think [1] is my assigned IP address, [2] and [3] are the
&gt;same, being my router/gateway address, and 4 is the ISP's router address, as
&gt;per a normal dialup connection...
&gt;
&gt;Hmm... I also think I'm a little confused... As Simon said earlier,
&gt;Internode, to give out one static IP, will use 4 real addresses... I guess
&gt;these are [1], [2,3], broadcast and reserved. yah? What about with a dynamic
&gt;scheme? how would one do that? I'd be expecting that there would be no
&gt;difference... Can you do this with only using 1 IP address?
&gt;

Our allocation is as per your latter suggestion, i.e. reserved, 
default route, your ip, and broadcast, all under a 4 host netmask 
(255.255.255.252).

We are also supporting customers who want to have 5 customer hosts 
out of 8 (reserved, default route, customer ip's 1 to 5, broadcast), 
under a netmask of 255.255.255.248, for any situations for which a 
single IP is insufficient and NAT is not desired.

There is a logical and common degenerate case, a /32 netmask (i.e. 
255.255.255.255), i.e. a host route.

In this case, yes, you have one IP and there is no wastage - your 
modem knows that 'default' is just 'up the link' (which is 
effectively un-numbered) to the world.

For static IP assignments, Telstra don't let us allocate a single 
address - minimum burn of the global routing tables is 4 addresses - 
they'll only let us have a single address to the customer if Telstra 
dynamically allocate the IP. Which, for business customers or people 
of any sort who want to run a server at home, is about as much use a 
tits on a bull.  So we could technically be more efficient except 
that Telstra choose to prohibit us from doing so.

	"...Making life easier".

Cheers,
Simon
