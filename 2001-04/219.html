&gt;&gt; a new Lynx?  These things wouldn't happen, and I suspect (hope) that
&gt;&gt; David was mistaken when he said that the new Bind requires a new resolver.
&gt;
&gt;I don't think I was mistaken. The page on BIND 9 clearly states that the
&gt;resolver libraries packaged with BIND 9 are not compatible with the
&gt;resolver libraries packaged with BIND 8. Hence anything linked with a
&gt;BIND 8 library may not work with the BIND 9 resolver libraries. The page
&gt;states that the res_[blah blah] functions are not compatible with BIND
&gt;9's resolver libraries.
&gt;
&gt;That says to me that anything that has been linked against res_init (for
&gt;example) won't work.

Hmmm, I think there are several concerns that are not being articulated
clearly here.

What I interpret this to mean is the following.

Consider two systems:

     +----------+                       +-----------------+
     |     A    |                       +      B          |
     | bind 8   +-----------------------+ bind 9 and      |
     | resolver |                       | bind 9 resolver |
     +----------+                       +-----------------+

I would expect the above to work. Since the format of requests is a
standard, a Bind 8 resolver library should be able to query Bind 9 without
any problems.

However, if you are on system B, and you have an application that has been
linked against the Bind8 resolver library, and you have removed it from B,
then your application won't work.

Fortunately, since I would expect both bind 8 and bind 9 resolver libraries
to co-exist on the one system (but I have not checked the shared library
names that are created), this should not be a big problem, and, as I stated
above, I would expect a bind 8 resolver library to still be able to query a
bind 9 implementation.
