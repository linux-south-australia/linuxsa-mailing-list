&gt; Hi all,

Hi Wilbs... :)

&gt; Seeing as there seem to be quite a few good legal minds on this list (or
&gt; people with connections to good legal minds), I am after a little bit of
&gt; advice...

IDTTAOUAL (I don't think that any or us are lawyers), so you really ought to
check things like IPAustralia and so on...

&gt; Recently (back in December last year), I registered a dot com for a friend
&gt; that I was creating a Q&D website for and due to his ISP being
&gt; reluctant to
&gt; provide hosting for him until certain network upgrades were
&gt; performed on the
&gt; ISP's end, the website has only just gone online over Easter with a
&gt; different ISP.
&gt;
&gt; I received an email this morning from the person who owns the Australian
&gt; trademark "Aussiewood". This dot com that was registered is
&gt; aussiewood.com.
&gt; The owner of the trademark has asked us to cease using the name
&gt; in Australia
&gt; as they own that name.

I _doubt_ they have a case. They may have a case if it were .com.au, but...

&gt; Now, my question is does this type of thing apply to dot coms? A
&gt; quick look
&gt; at the information supplied in the trademark database (search for
&gt; no. 817994
&gt; at
&gt; <A HREF="http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/falcon.application_start">http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/atmoss/falcon.application_start</A>) and a
&gt; look at the website (<A HREF="http://www.aussiewood.com">http://www.aussiewood.com</A>) shows that they have
nothing
&gt; in common bar the name. Can the owner of this trademark force me to hand
&gt; over the domain to them? From what I have gathered, this would only apply
if
&gt; the trademark was registered world-wide.

I suppose there is potential for them to get it, but I seriously doubt it.
I'm pretty sure that IPAustralia have a lot of documentation on where
trademarks apply... By the way, I would have assumed that this kind of thing
would really be up to your client... It's their domain, is it not? You're
just administering etc it... :)

&gt; Can any of you shed some light on this rather murky subject?
