&gt;&gt; I think that from my point of view, Mark Collis and maybe Matthew
&gt;&gt; Geddes', UNIX in the school could significantly benfit the IT

&gt;
&gt; Another point:  I know that there is a lot of Linux in SA schools already.
&gt; ISPs (some of whom no longer exist!) have been going around installing
&gt; Linux servers for dialup and other services. The school often has no idea
&gt; this has happened, and it often works for years without any problem.

I suppose you'll be interested to read this message, which came in
only a couple of days ago.  The article he's referring to is at
<A HREF="http://www.daemonnews.org/200102/dadvocate.html,">http://www.daemonnews.org/200102/dadvocate.html,</A> specifically the last
paragraph ("Nay-sayers department").

&gt; You will be pleased to know (if you aren't already aware) that the freebsd
&gt; network you referred to at the end of your article at Strathalbyn
&gt; school/community library is part of a larger network that spans the state
&gt; from Ceduna to Mt. Gambier, and most places in between. I was part of the
&gt; project that installed freebsd servers and public access clients to around
&gt; 80 regional libraries throughout the state.  The servers have a 20MB flash
&gt; drive in them, from which the server can rebuilt itself should it detect a
&gt; problem with the hard drive that may have been caused by a dodgy power
&gt; outage (flakey rural power supply being one of the biggest problems that
&gt; had to be overcome).  The public access clients are also running a minimal
&gt; freebsd setup, loading netscape from the server when they reboot. If the
&gt; setup on the clients get messed up, either accidentally, or deliberately
&gt; by the public, the librarians only need to reset the client and it will
&gt; refresh itself.
&gt;
&gt; At ADC (the company I work for), we use freebsd almost exclusively.  Time
&gt; and time again, we are demonstrating how you can make freebsd jump through
&gt; hoops to acheive solutions that are simply impossible to do with the
&gt; surprisingly more popular alternatives.
&gt;
&gt; FreeBSD is alive and well in the state of South Australia.  Nay-sayers be
&gt; damned!
