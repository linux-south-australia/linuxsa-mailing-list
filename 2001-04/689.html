Hey All,

I've got an interesting problem with the way our DMZ works. It's not
been an issue until recently, so I'm keen to get it solved as soon as
possible.

We have approximately 60 (live) IP Addresses which we use for various
hosting applications.

One of those IP Addresses is assigned to the router/firewall (the main
address for the internet-facing ethernet card) and all the others are
aliased on this card.

Our servers which sit behind the firewall in a private server network
(DMZ) have private addresses (for the sake of the question, we'll say
192.168.10.0)

Lets take the mail server (192.168.10.3). It runs the MTA and POP/IMAP
servers. The firewall runs rinetd which forwards the IP that reverse
maps to mail.mydomain.com.

Maybe this makes it a little clearer:

Internet                                            DMZ
                                      \
           +------------------+       /   +---------------------+
           |     Firewall     |       \   |     Mail Server     |
           | 203.x.x.1:25  -----------------&gt; 192.168.10.3:25   |
           | 203.x.x.1:110 -----------------&gt; 192.168.10.3:110  |
           | 203.x.x.1:143 -----------------&gt; 192.168.10.3:143  |
           | 203.x.x.1:22  -----------------&gt; 192.168.10.3:22   |
&lt;----------- 203.x.x.2        |       /   |                     |
           |                  |       \   |                     |
           +------------------+       /   +---------------------+

Now, connections to the Mail server va 203.x.x.1:(25|110|143|22) work in
the mannar in which I want them  to. Connections out, however don't work
the same way.

When someone connects to 203.x.x.1:110 and do a reverse lookup of it, it
returns mail.mydomain.com. When the Mail server connects out to the
Internet to deliver mail, it connects with the IP of 203.x.x.2 which
resolves to firewall.mydomain.com.

Can you see my problem? Connections to the outside world _always_ seem
to be comming from the Firewall. I want the connections to appear to
come from the Mail Server (203.x.x.1) or my Web Server (203.x.x.3) or my
Development Server (203.x.x.4) etc.

My subject line of 'Weird Magic with Masquerading' was chosen because
one of my colleuges said that "...it's extremely hard to make outgoing
connections appear to come from anything other than the default address
and requires some wierd voodoo magic..."

I thought about this for a while and decided that he was right -- It
_is_ going to be a pain in the neck to get it to work. But, nevertheless
I am keen to see how I can do it anyway.

During this period of thinking, I though about IPChains and how I could
apply it to this problem.

If we say that 203.x.x.1 (the Mail Server's External IP) has the kernel
device of eth0:2, could I use IPChains to do something like this:

ipchains -A output -p tcp -s 192.168.10.3 25 -d 0.0.0.0/0 &lt;send out via
interface eth0:2&gt;

Would that have the desired effect of the connection appearing to come
from 203.x.x.1 rather than 203.x.x.2?

If anyone has any experience or suggestions in this field, I'd be glad
to hear what you have to say.

TIA!

   - Andrew
