&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; While I don't use Debian, I think to say that Progeny goes against the
&gt; &gt; original ideals of Debian is a little wrong. While it has been
&gt; &gt; developed
&gt; &gt; by people with a passion for free, Open Source software, it _is_
&gt; &gt; licensed under a license which permits the modification and
&gt; &gt; redistribution of the software, so long as the modified source code is
&gt; &gt; made freely available.
&gt;
&gt; True, i guess that I am used to the commercial = crap (read M$) I
&gt; use debian,
&gt; debian rox, and I would hate to see it change!

The commercialisation of debian with progeny is not a change to debian, it's
simply someone utilising debian to make money. They happen to be Ian
Murdock, and they happen to be contributing back to debian, and seem to have
other goals (fixing some of debians problems), but progeny will not
neccessarily change debian per se at all (of course, it's highly likely that
progeny will influence debian by contributing their own .debs to the debian
archive, but anyway...)

&gt; &gt; Why would someone like Progeny want to change Debian and make it
&gt; &gt; commercial? Well the answer is, they probably don't. Again, I'll use
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; Ximian / GNOME relationship as an example. Ximian, IMHO, have pollished
&gt; &gt; GNOME to make it more 'commercially viable' and ready  for the masses.
&gt; &gt; Installing and upgrading GNOME has never been easier.
&gt;
&gt; After playing with SuSe, RedHat and Turbolinux IMHO debian is the best
&gt; installer I have seen. However, a newbie or someone from a M$
&gt; background may
&gt; not see it that way, then that is where Progeny may come in, as
&gt; have redhat in
&gt; the past.

yeah -- I've always despised the debian installer, and I'm not such a
newbie... they do many things right, but the installer is not one of them --
way too many questions, etc...

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Without knowing the Corporate strategy that Progeny has adopted, I
&gt; &gt; can't
&gt; &gt; be sure, but I'd hazard a guess and say that they're trying to do a
&gt; &gt; similar thing. Ximian have got over $US15 Million in investment, plus
&gt; &gt; deals with big companies such as Sun, HP, Compaq, IBM. If they play
&gt; &gt; their cards right they _may_ succeed in pushing Linux to the corporate
&gt; &gt; headlines (more often).
&gt;
&gt; Progeny sure is a cool sounding name though...

indeed, and really, that's what it's all about (says he who has just spent a
week or more deciding on a cool sounding name for his own debian-based
business venture :)
