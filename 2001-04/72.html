Woops, I forgot to mention the further bad news about SuSE 7.1.

I did actually download the latest Apache (1.3.19, not the
new alpha version), and it didn't compile. I got:

/usr/include/bits/local_lim.h:36: linux/limits.h: No such file or directory

Well, it turns out that this linux/limits.h file is only in the
linux source itself, usually in /usr/src/linux/include or something.
But I've pointed my /usr/src/linux link to the current
version of the kernel running, which is:

Linux dog2 2.4.0-4GB #1 Wed Jan 24 15:55:09 GMT 2001 i586 unknown

So the directory is:

/usr/src/linux-2.4.0-4GB

linked to as:

linux -&gt; linux-2.4.0-4GB

This is the kernel you get on SuSE 7.1 if you use their 2.4.0 kernel.
Problem: when you load up the full source of the kernel from
the dist. disks, they give you the source for a similar kernel:

/usr/src/linux-2.4.0.SuSE

So it seems like they don't want you to have the source for
their 4GB kernel, which I believe they wrote.
Maybe it's not quite open source!?

Anyway, that's an obstacle even to the approach of
reinstalling
-	Apache
-	PHP
-	PostgreSQL
-	etc.

which I was going to do if I couldn't diagnose the
Apache conf file problem.

I guess the alternative approach is reading the Apache
source to see how the conf. file error occurred.

It surprises me that such basic things just don't work.
How is the average user supposed to cope with this kind
of thing?


Cheers again,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I proof-read this e-mail and the previous post.
Does this mean that I'm becoming a right-wing
authoritarian wowser in my old age?
Am I finally losing my individuality?
If you know the answer, please don't tell me.
