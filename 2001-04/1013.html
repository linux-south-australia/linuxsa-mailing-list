Hi,

Just another viewpoint on ADSL:

Telstra's network is not an infinite resource.  Sure there is plenty of
fibre bandwith available in some places, but then again there are also
capacity problems.  Factor into this equation the available bandwith
connecting Australia to the rest of the world.

If ISP's were able to provide ADSL at the price most people would be
prepared to pay, and I'm thinking about the masses here, then you could
paint a picture of all internet users getting 1.5Mbit ADSL services.  Now
imagine what your throughput would be like in this situation, umm perhaps
the same as you get now with a 28.8K modem ?

How about a local example, imagine if 20% of the Tasmanian population were
able to afford 1.5Mbit ADSL ?  What do you think their response and
throughput would really be like.  AND I can really imagine Telstra laying
more and
more cable across to Tasmania :)

Bandwith is a limited resource and that is why we have to pay so much for
it.  Good old laws of supply and demand factor in here.  Next time I see
Ziggy, I'll make sure that he agrees to Telstra spending billions of $AUD to
expand our network and the interconnects so that we can all enjoy high speed
internet access.......

I would suggest that we stay tuned to developments in the digital
broadcasting arena, because with the current economical constraints we have
a better chance of getting access to digital content through this medium
than with the internet.  However, we'll have to put up with content that the
likes of Packer and Murdoch want to give us - but then again that should
satisfy a large proportion of the Neighbours and Home Away watching
population.....

Regards,

Richard
