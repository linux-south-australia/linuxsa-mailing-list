&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To Sarah, Greg and other AUUG people, where does AUUG fit into this?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does AUUG have an opinion or ideas on the matter, or do AUUG prefer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keep out of such things?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Join AUUG and find out. Or Join AUUG and make AUUG fit into this where you
&gt; &gt; &gt; think appropriate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This sounds like one of those licensing agreements that says that by
&gt; &gt; opening the packaging you agree to and accept the terms of the license,
&gt; &gt; but you have to open the packaging in order to read the license. :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I was more hoping it would sound like one of those invitations for an
&gt; interested party to do somethihg about a problem they percive using a body
&gt; which they apprantely think ahs an interest in the area as avehicel to do
&gt; that something.
&gt; 
&gt; Ie if you think some organisation is apropriate for making change and
&gt; should be making change, then you should probably join that organiasation.

But if you don't know where a particular organisation stands on such a
topic, whether you are a member or not (which incidentally, I am) isn't
it better to ask than to assume or ignore? As an organisation AUUG (or
any other organisation) may or may not be doing something about what
this thread used to be about. Is it not better to pool resources? Too do
so, surely you need to know where people stand.
