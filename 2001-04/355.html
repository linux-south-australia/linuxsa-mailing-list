&gt; Are you using kickstart and installing from a vanilla RH install source?
&gt; If so, I would have to ask why.

KickStart allows you to choose what packages you install. We've got our
own modified versions of stuff like SQUID plus our own software etc that
I'll be installing. It will be far from a 'vanilla' RedHat install.
Things like IPChains rules, DNS, rinetd, webmin, etc. Will all be
installed and configured for this particular box.

&gt; My impression of kickstart is that it will give you identical installs,
&gt; but there will still be some configuration per install to complete the
&gt; job?

It may seem stupid, but this is only for the one box. It's probably our
most important server, so I want to make sure that when I'm gone, the
people there can have something to fall back on in the event of major
disaster. This opens up a whole new can of worms... What if the physical
hardware dies (like a drive etc). What if this, what if that. I've
thought about this. The other people who I work with are aware of the
requirements and restraints of this software.

&gt; Would it not be better to archive the currently working system to bootable
&gt; cdr? I'm sure I have seen packages on freshmeat to do this.

I thought about that. KickStart will do all the partitioning, FS
formatting etc by itself. If a drive were to die, it can be replaced and
KickStarted with little or no loss of configuration.

This is designed to be a 'Quick Restore' CD for one system, not a
roomfull. Have you ever worked with Compaq servers? If you've survived
to tell the tale, you might rememmber seeing some quick restore CDs in
the folder that comes with the server.
HP Laptops even have a 'Quick Restore' CD. It's only batch file that
runs GHOST with a few switches, but the point is that it makes restoring
the box to a reasonably usable state easy.
