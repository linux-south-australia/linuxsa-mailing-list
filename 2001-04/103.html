Hi All

Its like this.

AUUG has said that they will provide the Insurance for any of the Linux/BSD
users groups, any users group that has another way of arranging this can do
so.

AUUG has ask use to place "The Australian National Installfest by AUUG" on
any paper. This will allow use to have an official name to arrange sponsor
ship with, I does not mean that the name of out installfest is the above
name.

The Users group can use what ever name they like as long as they suffix it
will "by AUUG" if they want to be covered by the Insurance.

I SAY AGAIN the USERS groups may arrange there own cover if they want to,
and not have to have anything to do with AUUG.

Under the AUUG banner we will be try to get some very major sponser which we
hope all the users group will be able to get somthing out of.

Sarah please correct me if anything above is incorrect, but I'm sure that
the above is correct.

Cheers
    Mike O'Connor

Subject: Installfest names and AUUG


&gt;
&gt; On the topic of the name of the event, I'm a little confused.  The
&gt; conglomeration(sp) of events nationwide is called "The Australian National
&gt; Installfest", right?
&gt;
&gt; a) Are local events, like the LinuxSA one, allowed to have their own name?
&gt; like, "&lt;font size=+1&gt;2001 an installfest odyssey&lt;/font&gt;part of the
Australian
&gt; National Installfest&lt;font size=-1&gt;(by AUUG)&lt;/font&gt;", or
&gt;
&gt; b) are we suggesting that that every event needs to be "The Australian
National
&gt; Installfest (by AUUG) held in Adelaide, South Australia" or similar, or
&gt;
&gt; c) no offence intended, but "The Australian National Installfest" sounds
like
&gt; title-by-committee, or something I'd expect the Federal government to come
up
&gt; with.  Can't we have something cooler?
&gt;
&gt; d) Is AUUG the national major naming rights sponsor who's put up bundles
of cash
&gt; for the priveledge?  Or are they just the LinuxSA-event major sponsor?  If
the
&gt; national one, what are they contributing?  I've seen little discussion
beyond
&gt; AUUG providing insurance for the LinuxSA event.  How will that benefit be
&gt; delivered to other installfest events nationwide?
&gt;
&gt; With a) and b) I'm confused.  And with c) and d) I'm going to get flamed.
&gt;
