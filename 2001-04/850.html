&gt; The first question asked prior to the class was, yup you guessed
&gt; it 'who here
&gt; uses Linux?' Linux was mentioned at least 3-4 times during every session.
&gt; Comparisons were made and in most cases Linux could do it much
&gt; quicker and more
&gt; reliably CL made it much quicker. Imagine his shock when he
&gt; learned we had 148
&gt; machines with Mandrake running on them 6 redhat servers for
&gt; student use and a
&gt; Linux cluster in development, and offered 'choice of OS in the
&gt; drop in centre
&gt; for practical work. MS is certainly IMO not in as strong as a bargaining
&gt; position as it once was.

&lt;snip&gt;

Yeah, it's different everywhere, but we still have the state government
contract, and MS are still aggressive (as any business should be) and so on.
Anyway, what I was originally saying is that MS are not "showing [customers]
their product", they are agressively marketing it...
