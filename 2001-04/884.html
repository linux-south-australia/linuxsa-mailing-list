&gt; &gt; I guess everyone has their own specific needs/wants regarding provision of
&gt; &gt; broadband services. And yes, I have my own too.
&gt; &gt; I think Internode fall short in a couple of areas. (Sorry Simon)
&gt; &gt; 1. the allowance/cap is still too low it should be minimum of 1gb/month
&gt;
&gt;There's a 1.5 Gbyte/month option.

Yes I know but at a higher monthly fee. I think 15,gb entry would be better
for me.

&gt; &gt; 2. The setup costs are fine
&gt; &gt; 3. The monthly access should be no more than 80 it's more than BP now (I
&gt; &gt; understand the wholesale price issue) 
&gt;
&gt;Don't compare apples with oranges:  you get a better package than BP 
&gt;delivers too.
YEs and no, BP offer an AUP no additional charges as such on their freedom
plan which is ok but the AUP is a dodgy piece of work IMHO. 

&gt; &gt; I guess in the end if I could get ADSL 256/64 for 200 install, 75/month,
&gt; &gt; without the cap or with a 1gb ALLOWANCE per month then it would not be an
&gt; &gt; issue I would sign up tomorrow. I know of people who are prepared to pay
&gt; &gt; 200-300 a month for 1.5/1.5 MB with no caps.
&gt; 
&gt;Hang on -- Do you think there's actually a cap in the sense that it 
&gt;stops working after that many megabytes?

Not at all but I dont like surprises on my use, if I exceed it once a blue
moon I think it's reasonable. As 90% of the time I never will, but I guess
they are there to make money or at least not lose it.

&gt;Oh, wow - there might be a perception issue here:  "cap" isn't a word 
&gt;Internode uses in the materials published for this service, it's a word
&gt;which someone else on this list has introduced.  To clarify:  You can 
&gt;download as much as you want with no restrictions whatsoever, with the
&gt;proviso that megabytes downloaded in excess of the amount included in
&gt;your price plan will be charged at $0.18 each (which, I might add, is 
&gt;cheaper than Telstra's retail megabyte rates).


&gt;If you think you'll use 2 Gbytes/month, then you can get onto the
&gt;1.5 Gbyte/month plan and pay an extra $90 per month (500 Mbytes *
0.18c/Mbyte).
&gt;
&gt;Note that other Internode permanent link price plans are available on
&gt;these services too:  If you think you'll regularly do very high data
&gt;volumes, the sales staff can put you on a non-standard price plan.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Sorry for the length of the post, but I think I am reasonable as the data
&gt; &gt; content is getting fatter and the allowances/caps are a REAL pain and
&gt; &gt; providers setup costs OUCH!
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps we're thinking of different things when we hear the word "cap".
&gt;
Well perhaps but I feel a reasonable limit would ensure most people stay
within it, for my needs 1.5gb a month would be sufficient it may not be for
others.

Sadly you cant run a business by customising plans like that.
