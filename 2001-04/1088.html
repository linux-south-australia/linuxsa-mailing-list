&gt; This is one of the big problems with XML, there aren't any good

&gt; help people just trying to get words on a page.

XEmacs edits SGML just fine if you put the DocBook DTD in the
DTD-path.  I also set Enter to insert a &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; about
the cursor and auto-indent it.

This isn't WYSIWYG, it's more like Word Perfect with the
Show Codes option on.

My real problem with XML is that the rendering tools
aren't mature enough to do a decent job.  You seem
to end up under the hood fiddling with TeX anyway,
so there doesn't seem much benefit in not starting
from there.  Especially as LyX isn't half-bad.

Apache's Cocoon project will probably change my mind
about this, but that code base isn't ready for production
use yet.

OpenOffice might end up producing a nice WYSIWYG DocBook
processor.  OpenOffice documents have their own XML DTD.
But all XML documents can be transformed (that's one of the
advantages of a regular syntax), so you should be able
to write your DocBook source in {Star|Open}Office using a
stylesheet containing the DocBook styles and the send
that through an XSLT processor to get DocBook source.

The downside of this approach is the OpenOffice won't
enforce the syntax rules of DocBook (eg: You can't
have &lt;section&gt; &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt; &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt; &lt;/section&gt;)
{X}Emacs does enforce the rules.
