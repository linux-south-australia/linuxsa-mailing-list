&gt;&gt; Nope, but I could give a talk on Vinum :-)
&gt;
&gt; And maybe tell us all that you're porting Vinum to Linux ;-)

Well, no, I was going to ask somebody else to do it :-)

&gt; On a more serious note, how do the two Volume Managers compare? Is
&gt; one better than the other? What are the advantages/disadvantages of
&gt; each?  What is the maturatity and stability levels of each like?

I'm the wrong person to ask, of course.  Firstly, as the author of
Vinum I'm biased, and secondly I just plain don't know the Linux
offerings.  Linux people I respect, however, are not very happy with
the Linux LVM.  Here's what they say:

1.  LVM is only part of the solution.  You also need the MD code, and
    they don't work together too well.
2.  The code is badly written.
3.  The performance is not good.

Certainly (1) and (3) don't apply to Vinum.  You judge (2).  Vinum
includes both the functionality of LVM and the functionality of MD.
For Vinum results, look at
<A HREF="http://www.shub-internet.org/brad/FreeBSD/vinum.html">http://www.shub-internet.org/brad/FreeBSD/vinum.html</A> .  You'll note a
comment there about RAID-5 reliability.  Since that was written, we
have found a couple of race conditions which probably caused the
problems to which the author refers.
