there was no sarcasm,

There was however, me asking for someone to explain how DNS effected the
login
And there was also a Joke at the end of my message.

&lt;sarcasm&gt;
Next time, I will include little Tags so that you know this.
&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

I cant see how it would do a lookup on logon,
You set a hostname for the machine, the machine accepts this
as it needs to know what to call itself, no matter if it resolves or not..

I might be wrong, but hey if I am, please do let me know.

For the record anyway, Geoff has decided to reinstall linux on the machine,
so I guess the problem has no need to be looked at anymore.

Regards,
Adam

Hi Adam

When I login my prompt changes to <A HREF="mailto:robyn@kanga">robyn@kanga</A>, I think it did a DNS lookup
to
get that info.

And I don't really think the sarcasm in your message is necessary (-;

&gt; I can see how a network login would be effected, but when loging on
&gt; normaly, not via a network...
&gt; How does DNS effect this?
&gt;
&gt; I dont think I've ever see a linux box try to "nslookup
&gt; tty1.local.keyboard.monitor.mouse"
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
