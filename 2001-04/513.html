Hi Greg,

I made the following comments today regarding RAID 5...

[1] RAID 5 requires a minimum of 3 HDD's

This is certainly the case with M$ products, and I assumed (possibly
wrongly) that Linux would be the same. You then mention that "Vinum"
also has the 3 HDD restriction and that I am confusing what makes
sense with what is possible. That's fine...as I previously mentioned
...I will concede that you are right because of your greater Linux
knowledge...but can you tell me what command or utility I can use in
Linux to create a RAID 5 setup with 2 HDD's (if I can't use Vinum).

[2] Given the number and capacity of HDD's in a RAID 5 setup the parity
space used can be determined by using the formula 1/N (where N is the
total number of HDD used).

I have shown in the reply to Mark Newton's email that this is correct
...however 1/(N-1) is also correct...depending on the question that is
being asked.

[3] RAID 5 has better read performance than RAID 1

You have sent me several emails debating this comment...yet when asked
simply if RAID 1 is faster than RAID 5 when reading, writing, or both
...you answer writing...I never said this wasn't the case. It should be
obvious to you why now I am a little confused. Please set me straight...

Regards,
Richard Watkins
