Hi there :)

As a comment regarding the below (well, two comments). Ok, three 
comments and some questions :)

1) I think I've finally cracked a viable way to get into production 
for ADSL under the Internode banner. I hope to have something 
formally announced mid this week for deployment as of circa next 
week. Honest. Really. Sure. Yep :)

2) As part of the above, what I had decided was the most equitable 
approach (and this is different to the Telstra one as it happens) is 
for our service to be sold -as a service-, with the customer 
outright-buying their choice of ADSL termination equipment rather 
than renting-to-buy as in the Telstra model.

That means you can choose what works for you - a 'cheap' ethernet to 
DSL box, a PCI card, a USB adaptor, or a more whippy Cisco 827 DSL 
router thingy - and keep it, and configure it to your hearts' 
content. What we'll do is make sure the service at the other end 
works, and works well.

I would welcome comments on the above approach - would this work for 
people? I think it's fairer (lets you buy a cheaper DSL card for your 
linux box instead of a standalone box, or else lets you choose a 
niftier standalone box if _that_ is what you want... etc etc).

3) Interface - PPPoE vs 'straight' standard TCP/IP over ethernet.

The other thing I'm contemplating is a service which does -not- 
require PPPoE support on your computer system (many, but not all, DSL 
services around the world use PPPoE; The Telstra service uses it)

Instead, I'm considering delivering straight TCP/IP over ethernet, 
and you'll get one real live genuine static IP address to use to your 
hearts' content. No dynamic addresses. Server friendly, etc etc. 
Unlike Telstra.

More than 1 host can be accommodated by sharing that IP address - 
either by plugging it into a linux box running NAT (or proxy 
servers), or by buying a 'residential gateway' (that does the same 
thing), or (if you really want to) by getting &gt;1 static address from 
us, but at extra cost (cos these suckers are getting harder to get...)

PPPoE has two interesting problems:
	- needs support in your client system (sometimes costs $$$, 
always costs head-scratching)
	- has some issues with MTU (maximum transmission unit) 
problems which can be a hassle
	causing access problems on large data transfers until fixed.

The approach I'm chewing over now would avoid the above two issues 
and mean compatibility with anything that speaks TCP/IP over ethernet 
- anything at all.

This is your chance to help to influence product development, folks. 
Comments sincerely invited, especially in terms of whether the above 
propositions would be ok/good/bad/indifferent. In summary, that 
proposition set is:

- Buy your own choice of DSL hardware (just like buying your own 
choice of modem today)
- One, static, IP address is assigned to your service
- Generous included download limits (I'll straighten out a few 
options in the next day or so but the most likely base level is 1500 
Megabytes per month included)
- No PPPoE software required
- Residential gateway or NAT device or suitability NAT configured 
linux box needed for &gt; 1 ethernet host to talk to the Internet at 
once [*]

[*] This is the one I'm most interested in feedback on - it's the 
normal way that ISP's deliver ADSL (and its why there are so many 
'residential gateway' products out there to address this for 
households with more than one ethernet host).

I think it's ok, but I want to make sure its ok enough before I set 
it in stone in procedural terms at Internode - we could deploy an 
option allowing 5 direct connected hosts at a small extra cost, and 
perhaps I ought to just do that, and see who wants it... as I write 
this, sitting on one wireless host in my house, beside another one on 
the ethernet, with a third lurking around the corner, I start to 
wonder... :) )

Cheers,
   Simon

&gt;  &gt; what hardware is involved in an ADSL connection? what prices and

&gt;  &gt; it. do any companies (telstra for eg) offer hardware?
&gt;
&gt;For a client-end situation, essentially a router or ADSL 'modem' that
&gt;sends and receives the data, a spiltter box for the telephone/ADSL to
&gt;work in harmony and an ethernet connection, I beleive.
&gt;
&gt;My understanding is that Telstra supplies this when you sign up with
&gt;them and is included in there subscription price. I dare say Internode
&gt;will have a similar offer, so don't go jumping on the Telstra boat too
&gt;early :-)
&gt;
&gt;As far as prices, I think Telstra builds the price of the router into
&gt;the cost of your setup and monthly fee. Again I'm not exactly sure as I
&gt;don't use/like ADSL.
&gt;
&gt;For the Service Provider, things are a little more complex.
