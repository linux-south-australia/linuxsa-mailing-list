&gt; I think that from my point of view, Mark Collis and maybe Matthew
&gt; Geddes', UNIX in the school could significantly benfit the IT
&gt; Infrastructure.
&gt; 
&gt; A well setup, thought out Linux-based server end is more likely to have
&gt; less problems than the equivelant NT network. The TCO of a Linux based
&gt; server-backend is a lot less than NT or even Novell (I know that we've
&gt; downloaded nearly 2.5GB in Novell Service Packs over the last few
&gt; years).
&gt; 
&gt; Said Linux-based server backend does not have to be hard to administer,
&gt; either. Have you looked at e-Smith? It's probably not ideal for
&gt; everyone, but I've rolled it out to a few clients and have never had
&gt; problems with it. This machine was actually deployed remotely (I
&gt; installed the software on it and couriered it to their office. It worked
&gt; first time.)
&gt; 
&gt; Nice, clear web based interfaces _do_ exist. They are a bit obscure, I
&gt; admit. A lot could be done for the schools if they were to use Linux.
A nice clear bit obscure interface is a bit of an oxymoron to me.

the inteface is also only useful if you know what the words mean.

"To add a packet filtering rule to deny all traffic to all ports click
here"

For excample is not useful unless you know what all traffic to all ports
means and packet filtering is.

For this you need fundamtnal knowledge of the system so you can know what
the words mean or at least a plain language explanantion avialable.
CLIs typically dont have this, and most linux gui amdin tools I have seen
dont have this.
  
&gt; Not that much work would be required on the part of the 'Consultant'
&gt; (person that set it up) to make it self sufficient.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that anyone here is suggesting that giving the 'Computer
&gt; Teacher' a PocketBook and RedHat CD is the answer to our problems, but
&gt; the principle of using Linux is of great benefit to the schools..

No but they are not suggesting anything past that point either.

And as I keep repeating I dont see the problems with inital isntall I see
the problems afterwards.

There are a lot of proeffesional sys admins for unix systems on this list
I believe.

I bet not one of them is willing to telltheir boss they could be replaced
by the receptionist once the install is done.

&gt; This is one of the most important issues that the IT Community at large
&gt; is going to have to deal with. Education is what our future(s) stem
&gt; from. Let's not mess it up with the help of monopolising corporate
&gt; evils.

It certainly is a very important area.
I happento personally believe that this discussionis ignoring fundamental
falws in current policy however.

I really dont MS products in schools are the problem(there are not always
the solution either).
I do belvie that ihnadequate traning and support mechanisms are the
problem and could be reaosnbly easily9but not cheaply) corrected.
But then again spending money on PCs taht willnever be used properly or to
their fullest is I think false economy.
Like any tools you need properly qualified people to sue them to tehir
fullest. These peopel are lacking, through no fault of the classroom level
educator.
