Maybe you could consider it in a similar way to Ximian with GNOME.
Ximian don't close up their code and do the commercial giant jig,
they're supporting Open Source Software and its development with money.
Sad as it is, it does make the world go round.

While I don't use Debian, I think to say that Progeny goes against the
original ideals of Debian is a little wrong. While it has been developed
by people with a passion for free, Open Source software, it _is_
licensed under a license which permits the modification and
redistribution of the software, so long as the modified source code is
made freely available.

Why would someone like Progeny want to change Debian and make it
commercial? Well the answer is, they probably don't. Again, I'll use the
Ximian / GNOME relationship as an example. Ximian, IMHO, have pollished
GNOME to make it more 'commercially viable' and ready  for the masses.
Installing and upgrading GNOME has never been easier.

Without knowing the Corporate strategy that Progeny has adopted, I can't
be sure, but I'd hazard a guess and say that they're trying to do a
similar thing. Ximian have got over $US15 Million in investment, plus
deals with big companies such as Sun, HP, Compaq, IBM. If they play
their cards right they _may_ succeed in pushing Linux to the corporate
headlines (more often).

I don't see them as a bad thing at all. If they want to put money into
developing Open Source Software, good on them.
