And don't forget Mandrake and Redhat and Suse + others pay people to code directly
or sponsor code development.  The tendrils that spread out from these companies are
far and wide. It would be a minor disaster if they were all to fail due to cash flow
problems.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not reward a job well done?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Exactly. It costs them money to make it, and while I dont agree in
&gt; &gt; companys like microsoft ripping megabucks out of people I think they
&gt; &gt; (mandrake) deserve enough cash to pay thier wages and make a fair
&gt; &gt; profit. They are doing a lot to bring linux to the masses by generally
&gt; &gt; making a nicer and easier disto without limiting the power of people who
&gt; &gt; want to edit the conf files themselves and get thier hands dirty. I
&gt; &gt; thought mandrake 7.2 (while not perfect) had a much more sensible
&gt; &gt; interface and defaults than redhats efforts of late.
&gt;
&gt; I agree with the sentiment that we should support distros by sending them money.
&gt;
&gt; But "reward a job well done" or "It costs them money to make it"???  Most of the
&gt; software they provide is GPLd or BSDd.  They didn't write it, not did they fund
&gt; someone else to write it.  They may have written a slick installer, pulled
&gt; various packages together, and performed some basic quality control, but what
&gt; Mandrake, like RH/SuSE/whoever are really doing is making things convenient by
&gt; providing free(dom) software at a cheap cost.  If any particular distro
&gt; disappears open-source software will continue to be developed and enhanced - it
&gt; may be harder to obtain, but that's all.  Distros are important, but not that
&gt; important.
&gt;
&gt; Just IHMO,
