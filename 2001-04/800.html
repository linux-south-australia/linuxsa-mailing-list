&gt; Hi Jason,
&gt; 
&gt; Do you understand what TOC means?  You have to include purchase price, 
&gt; software, components, repair time as well as a whole swag of other things.

I belive so. Total owebnrship cost. The cost of the PC, plus software
plus admin/maintencae costs, the cost of runing it,. providing it with
airconditioning etc etc.

And since no one gets paid to adminsiter the systems in amost
schools it costs nothing to adminsiter them, but you get what you pay for.


What I am suggesting is that the problem in school IT is not
teachers, or windows, or office it is a lack of suitably qualified staff
to run the infrastructure

Fix that and you will reduce the resitance to IT change because it willno
longer be the problem of the teachers, who did not want to be sys admins
to start with.
It becomes the sys admins problem who did want to be a sys admin.

As they say if it aint brolke dont "fix" it.

The current situation is analogous to buying every school a 747 and
saying the physics techer ought to be able to fly it, "flight - its all
just a matter of physics".

In a few lucky schools it will work out that the rest will either crach
and burn or slowly work it out themselves, after wastign a few years
coming up to speed(which is eactly what most teachers are still doing -
with little or no help from the education dept).
