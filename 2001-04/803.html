$100k for 100 pcs  ... when I last figured that out ... well that equates to
$1000 per workstation is that not right ?

Most schools on average have more than 100 pcs, especially secondary
schools. Normally I see schools spending more than $1000 on pcs, or if they
are, well then it warrants the need to have a full time admin to be fixing
it all the time.

Schools that I've worked at in the past have had up to $130,000 IT budget
... that in some cases has been for the price including a full time
administrator ... but of course if an INTELLIGENT network/workstation
solution was implemented the need for a full time admin would not be there
in most schools.

Our company looks after networks in a few schools, we normally setup Linux
servers, windoze boxes with the ability to be automatically reloaded off an
image within 10 minutes to aviod calling one of us out to fix it all the
time.

&gt; &gt; At Trinity College, anything internetty (new word there) is Unix based

&gt; &gt; application server running Netscape, IE, Star Office and The Gimp.  This

applications

&gt; Indeed. We had a similar problem. We were offered 100 SunRays and an
&gt; E450 (x4 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 36GB Hard Disk) for ~100K. That's quite a decent
&gt; price.

$100k.
Reality check.

Unfortunatley, thats like 3 or 4 years budget at a state school in an
area with lots of young families in the south of the metro area.

They are lucky to get 20-30 bottom end PCs a year and think it is a big
thing when they do.

And those PC will probably see service for 6 or 7 years, or at least that
has been typcial to date.
