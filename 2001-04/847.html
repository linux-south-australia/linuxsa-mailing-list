&gt; Yes which somewhat illustrates my point, that schools cant afford them.

Agreed.

&gt; &gt; setup machine would only have to be rebooted and be fixed up in seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like a windows fix.
&gt; And yes they are cheap consultants with all teh implications, they cant
&gt; afford good ones.

But you don't necessarily get better as the price increases either.

&gt; No but there si a certainlevel of hard won knowledge of windows with
&gt; teachers. There is virtaully none with unix.

But as you run them through a brief training session (as we all do when
we install new software), you could easily draw parallels with what the
user does know. Like a staff member we had start here, who had never
used Windows, but had bought himself a Mac a couple of months ago. I
just pointed out the similarities between various parts of the two
interfaces and off he went.

&gt; Setting up is not the issue.
&gt; It is ongoing admin.

Which doesn't need to be an issue.

&gt; If I thiughtit would help I would set up a machien for a school and say
&gt; look here is an old 486, that you can now use as a fiel server.
&gt; But that is not the problem it is adminsterign it.
&gt; It is settign up shared directories for this project or that project.
&gt; Which relaly is nto thateasy unless you understand the unix security
&gt; model.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I want to do "one day" is precisely this, but with approprately
&gt; easy to use front end on it.

Have you started work on it? I would be interested to see what ideas you
had.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A system that is flexible and multipurpaose cant be zero admin. It is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; lie for windows and would be a lie for linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's completely not true, for UNIX. A system that's multipurpose can
&gt; &gt; still fit into the category of 'Zero Admin'. SunRay's pull it off quite
&gt; &gt; easily. Note that Zero Admin doesn't mean that you never touch it. It's
&gt; &gt; a fact of life that you have to do the odd spring cleaning job with your
&gt; &gt; boxes, whether they be Linux or Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is whty zero adminis a lie. Because you always have to touch it.

But you could make it less of a lie. I strongly believe that you could
set up a linux network (servers and workstations) that would require far
less administration than their Windows counterpart.
