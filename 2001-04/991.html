I'd just like to point out to innocent bystanders that Alan used to
believe that firewalling machines that faced onto the 'net was an
unnecessary waste of time until his gateway was rooted.

&gt; Think for yourselves. I do.

There is no harm in thinking for yourself.  However, when others
more experienced keep saying "Deny by default" and "Enable your
firewalling before your interfaces come up", and you say otherwise
without indicating the risks, then things are going to go pear-shaped.

&gt; There are no simple rules for right nad wrong in developing firewall
&gt; scripts.

Actually, there are.  And I think I listed two of the majors above.

Another minor one is "don't run applications on your firewall", which
I believe you also break (I do too, but then I do that consciously
and am aware of the risks).

&gt; As Larry Wall said: "There's more than one way to do it."
&gt; That applies to all areas of computing, not just Perl scripts.

Actually, it doesn't (or the collary:  there may be more than
one way to do it, but most of them are bad or suck).

BTW, the solution I use to get around problems with locking
yourself out of a box remotely due to firewall mishap is to
have run an atjob prior to the changes that reverses the
changes or disables the script; if you lock youself out, you
wait until the atjob runs.  If it succeeds, you delete the
atjob.
