&gt;&gt; Hi all
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; this has been discussed before, I know...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, IIRC, it hasn't come up in a while... I want to network 3 PCs in my
&gt;&gt; home, and I don't really want to run cables... so I want a wireless
&gt;&gt; solution... Where do I get cheap stuff from? Faster is better, but ~2Mbps is
&gt;&gt; acceptable. Needs to run under Linux and Windows 95/98/ME/NT4/2000. I also
&gt;&gt; wonder about security for these things -- I'd rather the neighbours couldn't
&gt;&gt; leech from my ADSL account... I'm supposing if you run some monitoring
&gt;&gt; equipment over it, you would be able to know when someone's doing somethign
&gt;&gt; dodgy? Hmmm...
&gt;
&gt; I use the WebGear stuff from MIMP. You can get a 2 PCMCIA card kit with one
&gt; ISA adapter for a little over $200. However, a PCI card will cost a bit as
&gt; well.

I don't think you'll have much joy with PCI adapter cards.  Most
laptops connect the PCMCIA interrupt to the ISA bus, not the PCI bus,
and that's the way FreeBSD and Linux expect to find them.  The PCI
adapters generate PCI interrupts, and the drivers I know can't handle
them.  Do you have any evidence to the contrary?

Note also that WebGear seem to have gone broke.

&gt; They work very reliably in Linux :-), they work in Win98, but hang
&gt; every now and then, and were a bitch to get going under Windows NT,
&gt; but seem to work. I have no experience getting them going under
&gt; Win2K.

I have four of these cards, and I had a real bitch of a job to get
them working on my Dell Inspiron 7500: they require a total of 52 kB
of I/O memory space, and the Inspiron only has 48 kB.  On machines
with enough I/O space they work fine.

&gt; I don't like the gear that MIMP sell. Haven't been very impressed with
&gt; it. I'd be more inclined to purchase Lucent gear.

&gt;
&gt; Maybe you've been lucky or something. I'd stay away from them
&gt; personally. Get the Lucent gear from Integrity Data.

Note that the Lucent gear is more than double the price.

One issue that Richard R. raised: yes, theoretically you could have
problems with security.  I'd be somewhat surprised if anybody else in
the neighbourhood were to have compatible hardware and software.  The
Microsoft driver insists on a network in the 192.168.x.x range, so if
you have anything else it won't be able to talk to you.  But the other
option is to accept only specific IP addresses on your main machine.
Or to encrypt everything in software (the Aviators don't have any
hardware encryption).
