Nothing is compolsory with Linux - you know that! :-)

I can say two things - a) I haven't used Nautilus for a few months, and b) the
1.0 release reportedly removed lots of debugging crud.  It still uses Moz0.8 for
rendering which is probably still a source of performance/memory leak problems,
but the only way Moz will get to be useable is if people use it and report
problems IMHO.
 
&gt; Does anyone know if the features/stability etc of GNOME have improved 
&gt; enough in 1.4 for it to become a 'worthwhile' download. For example, I'm 
&gt; quite happy with my current Ximian GNOME install (a stable, non 1.4 release) 
&gt; and I am loathed to update it unless it provides added functionality etc.

I understand your position - I'm the same way.  But even ignoring Nautilus, I
think the download is worth it.  I'll be waiting for Ximian's branded GNOME 1.4
rpms (as my experience has been that their release is stable and quick), but
once they're released I'm moving straight away.  There's too much nice stuff now
coming in from "unstable" not to move.  Likewise the "5th Toe" extra software is
supposedly really nice.
