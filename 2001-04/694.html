Hah!

Aaaaaah yes, ack, I've experienced the joys of this...  Being the
Administrator of my school last year & start of this year, I *almost* got a
Linux Debian server, and *almost* got all the machines to be dualboot
w95/corel linux.  The idea was for students to learn as many OS's as
possible, thereby putting them at an advantage in IT.  Corel Linux aint that
hard to learn, first user functionality is just like Windows, really.  And
the added feature being that my school uses a lot of Corel products anyway,
and there are versions (or up-coming versions) available of their graphics
software for Linux.

However things at the school blew up, *long* story, in the end I left the
school...  so yeah, all win98 / Win2K Server now. :(  It seems Microsoft are
very dominatiant in the education arena, which would have an influence of
some kind on people going through these institutions.

And seeing as most people use and accept M$ products, and most people really
couldnt be bothered learning everything over again with another OS ("This
works, why change?").. they wont.  They'll think the fact their computer
continually freezes/crashes is just part of using a computer. Sad really.

I have also been continually told by schools that "We use Windows because
thats whats best to use.  If you want to use something else, wait until
Uni.".

Shocking attitude imo, but lets just hope Linux prevails on the desktop and
becomes maybe a good an alternative and a competitor as OS/2 was once.
(Still beats me why Windows won really.. OS/2 rocked).

Anyway, thats my 2 cents :)

- Ryan
