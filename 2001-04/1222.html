&gt; Hello, list:

&gt; I am interested in expanding my interests in unix, and trying to have some
&gt; fun with FreeBSD 4.3. It looks pretty similar to linux (mandrake and redhat,
&gt; for instance), but there are some differences. In looking through the web
&gt; there doesn't seem to be the same wealth of information available as for
&gt; linux users. There's no ldp-compatible site, for instance.

This is a cultural difference.  Information for Linux is available all
over the web; information for FreeBSD is on the FreeBSD web site.  We
prefer it that way; it makes looking for docco easier :-)

&gt; As linux users, have any of you out there ventured into bsd, and are
&gt; there any resources that you would recommend to me? I have heard
&gt; great things about "The Complete FreeBSD" second edition. 

The second edition is out of date.  In fact, the third edition is out
of date, but it's still the current version.

&gt; Since that's not available as free hypertext, I'm hoping to find
&gt; some more accessible resources before committing to this OS.

There's the handbook at <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/index.html.">http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/index.html.</A>  I
personally don't think it's as good, but then I might be biased.

&gt; As an example, I have a Xircom RBEM-56G PCMCIA lan/modem card. What do I do
&gt; to configure this? It is so easy in linux... ;]

In principle, you plug it in and it works.  YMMV.  I've checked the
CIS data we have, and I can't find any reference to RBEM.  What are
the CIS strings?  I note that Alfred Perlstein, one of the FreeBSD
developers, is using this card, so it's obviously possible; if things
go wrong you could contact him.

&gt;
&gt; It's closer to slackware. Some of the more cosmetic differences include
&gt; things like SysV-style init scripts (as found in most linux
&gt; distributions) and different naming conventions for /dev/* (as is the
&gt; case with most unixes). BSD people also don't appear to put PAM down as
&gt; a big priority (which is their choice, I guess).

What problems do you have with PAM in FreeBSD?

&gt;&gt; In looking through the web there doesn't seem to be the same wealth
&gt;&gt; of information available as for linux users. There's no
&gt;&gt; ldp-compatible site, for instance.
&gt;
&gt; At freebsd.org, theres a bit of documentation. I also think Greg Lehey
&gt; wrote a book which is shipped with the boxed version of FreeBSD.

Yes, he referred to it.

&gt;
&gt; Greg also runs a BSD mailing list. 

Send mail to <A HREF="mailto:majordomo@lemis.com">majordomo@lemis.com</A> with 'subscribe buga' in the body.

If send me a reply paid envelope, I'll send you back some FreeBSD
4.2-RELEASE CD-ROMs.  Not the latest version (barely).
