David!(what is with the exclamation mark??)

But the school would have to have no new IT equipment for three years to
get those machines, wheras as they can by 20pcs a year if they go for
wintel and use them straight away witht eh aplciations software they have 
already paid for on a per head basis, which is kind of useful.

And by the way the money that a lot of schools have got to spend on PCs
this year and last year were signing bonuses for whatever program it is
where schools adminsiter their own budgets. It is not nexccesarily
representative of what they get every year.

And they still wont have anyone to admin it, which makes it kind of
useless.

In any case the point was that teh amounts of money that were being talked
baout are compeltelty unrealisticand unrepresenttive for most state
schools even if they did represent comparitevly good value for money for
the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed. We had a similar problem. We were offered 100 SunRays and an
&gt; &gt; &gt; E450 (x4 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 36GB Hard Disk) for ~100K. That's quite a decent
&gt; &gt; &gt; price.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but 100 000 / 100 is $1000 per item...strikes me as same price as a
&gt; rock bottom PC...
