Darryl et al (I've cc'd this to the list as the questions look to be 
of general interest to me),

&gt;One thing I havent seen mentioned.. will there be a minimum contract 
&gt;time for your ADSL service ?
&gt;

Probably not - that's the upside of getting you to buy your own DSL 
device - which seems to be the reason why the Tel$stra plans have 
lock in periods - you're paying off your DSL hardware, just like 
'free' mobile phone plans.

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; - Buy your own choice of DSL hardware (just like buying your own 
&gt;choice of modem today)
&gt;
&gt;I think this is a good approach, you could offer some 
&gt;advice/table/FAQ on the pro's and con's of each of the devices 
&gt;available and maybe a recommendation from each type of device.
&gt;
&gt;If a better device comes along next month, there would be no 
&gt;problems switching..

Concur. We'll recommend an initial set of devices and we'll support 
connections made on those devices.


&gt;There needs to be some guidelines on what equipment is suitable for 
&gt;your service and the configuration..
&gt;ie can an ADSL modem used in Europe/USA be used here?

Yes, I have a list of supported devices and we'll update it over time.

&gt;
&gt;I did a quick search on Google and found Windows drivers for ADSL 
&gt;PCI cards, but no Linux driver yet, so a PCI ADSL card in Linux is 
&gt;not an option, whereas it would be in Windows environment.

I bet someone'll get one to work soon :)

&gt;I also looked up prices on the Net and prices start at $400 upto 
&gt;$1400 for the Cisco. You could offer the device on an 'Interest 
&gt;Free' type deal, outsourced to someone like AGC so you dont carry 
&gt;the risk..

Just offering outright purchase is the most appealing thing right now 
- and we will offer quite good prices - e.g. $995 for the Cisco, not 
the $1400 retail - because they're a good device and easy for us to 
support, but the $400 realm (Alcatel SpeedTouch Home) will work fine 
for most situations as well.

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; - One, static, IP address is assigned to your service
&gt;
&gt;Yes, gives the opprotunity for the customer to run their own small WWW server.

Yep! Also I live in the world where the 'don't run a server at home' 
thing just doesn't make sense - so we aren't going to limit that.

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; - Generous included download limits (I'll straighten out a few
&gt;  &gt; options in the next day or so but the most likely base level is 1500
&gt;  &gt; Megabytes per month included)
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; - No PPPoE software required
&gt;
&gt;Simpler the better..  It looks like your PC has a LAN connection to 
&gt;the Internet.

Exactly.

&gt;  &gt; - Residential gateway or NAT device or suitability NAT configured
&gt;  &gt; linux box needed for &gt; 1 ethernet host to talk to the Internet at
&gt;  &gt; once [*]
&gt;
&gt;I think this is a better option, once the security benefits of NAT 
&gt;are explained, I'm sure most people who dont require more than 1 IP 
&gt;address will accept that option.
&gt;
&gt;The concept of NAT may be hard for lay people to grasp at first, but 
&gt;its 'normal' way of connecting to your ISP when using Dial-Up and it 
&gt;would be familiar to those moving from a dial-up to ADSL connection.
&gt;
&gt;I have 5 PC's here.. and I'd rather that they stay hidden behind NAT 
&gt;or firewall or _something_ and not be exposed to all and sundry.
&gt;
&gt;I'd say make NAT + 1 IP address the default, with the option to 
&gt;request additional IP addresses and/or subnet routing.
&gt;

Concur.

Simon
