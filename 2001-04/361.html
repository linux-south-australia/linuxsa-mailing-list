Hi.

Oh, Ok, I see where you are coming from.

Given that this will be used in your absence, and there is a _risk_ that
the network connections will change, I think you may need to write
something to 'discover' what is attached to each network card before they
are configured on the rebuilt system. Maybe something that brings up the
first card with it's expected addressing, and then checks that it is so -
(ping or whatever to another box on the network) If that fails, drop the
config and try the next config until all cards are mapped.

It might help idiot proof the machine too, if it was part of the boot
process rather than the build process. What happens if someone switches a
couple of the net cables on the box?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; Are you using kickstart and installing from a vanilla RH install source?
&gt; &gt; If so, I would have to ask why.
&gt; 
&gt; KickStart allows you to choose what packages you install. We've got our
&gt; own modified versions of stuff like SQUID plus our own software etc that
&gt; I'll be installing. It will be far from a 'vanilla' RedHat install.
&gt; Things like IPChains rules, DNS, rinetd, webmin, etc. Will all be
&gt; installed and configured for this particular box.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My impression of kickstart is that it will give you identical installs,
&gt; &gt; but there will still be some configuration per install to complete the
&gt; &gt; job?
&gt; 
&gt; It may seem stupid, but this is only for the one box. It's probably our
&gt; most important server, so I want to make sure that when I'm gone, the
&gt; people there can have something to fall back on in the event of major
&gt; disaster. This opens up a whole new can of worms... What if the physical
&gt; hardware dies (like a drive etc). What if this, what if that. I've
&gt; thought about this. The other people who I work with are aware of the
&gt; requirements and restraints of this software.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Would it not be better to archive the currently working system to bootable
&gt; &gt; cdr? I'm sure I have seen packages on freshmeat to do this.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought about that. KickStart will do all the partitioning, FS
&gt; formatting etc by itself. If a drive were to die, it can be replaced and
&gt; KickStarted with little or no loss of configuration.
&gt; 
&gt; This is designed to be a 'Quick Restore' CD for one system, not a
&gt; roomfull. Have you ever worked with Compaq servers? If you've survived
&gt; to tell the tale, you might rememmber seeing some quick restore CDs in
&gt; the folder that comes with the server.
&gt; HP Laptops even have a 'Quick Restore' CD. It's only batch file that
&gt; runs GHOST with a few switches, but the point is that it makes restoring
&gt; the box to a reasonably usable state easy.
