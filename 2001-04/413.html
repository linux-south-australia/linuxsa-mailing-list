&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; 1) I think I've finally cracked a viable way to get into production
&gt; for ADSL under the Internode banner. I hope to have something
&gt; formally announced mid this week for deployment as of circa next
&gt; week. Honest. Really. Sure. Yep :)

sign me up! (err... but tell me the cost first... :)

&gt; 2) As part of the above, what I had decided was the most equitable
&gt; approach (and this is different to the Telstra one as it happens) is
&gt; for our service to be sold -as a service-, with the customer
&gt; outright-buying their choice of ADSL termination equipment rather
&gt; than renting-to-buy as in the Telstra model.
&gt;
&gt; That means you can choose what works for you - a 'cheap' ethernet to
&gt; DSL box, a PCI card, a USB adaptor, or a more whippy Cisco 827 DSL
&gt; router thingy - and keep it, and configure it to your hearts'
&gt; content. What we'll do is make sure the service at the other end
&gt; works, and works well.
&gt;
&gt; I would welcome comments on the above approach - would this work for
&gt; people? I think it's fairer (lets you buy a cheaper DSL card for your
&gt; linux box instead of a standalone box, or else lets you choose a
&gt; niftier standalone box if _that_ is what you want... etc etc).

would work for me, and probably most people on this list, but I get the
feeling that there's probably going to be a few less literate users out
there wanting fast connections, and they would benefit from having a
complete solution, rather than having to choose their connection equipment.
I'd suggest that you offer these people a complete solution -- either
directly or by referring them to consultants who onsell your service with
setup... But, as I say, it won't bother me or most on this list, only the
less educated users, which may not be part of your target market...

&gt; 3) Interface - PPPoE vs 'straight' standard TCP/IP over ethernet.
&gt;
&gt; The other thing I'm contemplating is a service which does -not-
&gt; require PPPoE support on your computer system (many, but not all, DSL
&gt; services around the world use PPPoE; The Telstra service uses it)
&gt;
&gt; Instead, I'm considering delivering straight TCP/IP over ethernet,
&gt; and you'll get one real live genuine static IP address to use to your
&gt; hearts' content. No dynamic addresses. Server friendly, etc etc.
&gt; Unlike Telstra.

exactly what I want...

&gt; More than 1 host can be accommodated by sharing that IP address -
&gt; either by plugging it into a linux box running NAT (or proxy
&gt; servers), or by buying a 'residential gateway' (that does the same
&gt; thing), or (if you really want to) by getting &gt;1 static address from
&gt; us, but at extra cost (cos these suckers are getting harder to get...)

Perhaps when you set your prices for ADSL, you could include the per-IP
prices as a footnote...

&gt; PPPoE has two interesting problems:
&gt; 	- needs support in your client system (sometimes costs $$$,
&gt; always costs head-scratching)
&gt; 	- has some issues with MTU (maximum transmission unit)
&gt; problems which can be a hassle
&gt; 	causing access problems on large data transfers until fixed.
&gt;
&gt; The approach I'm chewing over now would avoid the above two issues
&gt; and mean compatibility with anything that speaks TCP/IP over ethernet
&gt; - anything at all.

excellent -- what is the catch? Is it more expensive? Does it require more
expensive client premises equipment? More expensive ISP equipment? etc? I'd
prefer not to pay too much more for the above advantages (maybe 10% more,
but...)

&gt; This is your chance to help to influence product development, folks.
&gt; Comments sincerely invited, especially in terms of whether the above
&gt; propositions would be ok/good/bad/indifferent. In summary, that
&gt; proposition set is:
&gt;
&gt; - Buy your own choice of DSL hardware (just like buying your own
&gt; choice of modem today)

suits me, but some may desire a complete solution.

&gt; - One, static, IP address is assigned to your service

good (although some may not have any need for it...)

&gt; - Generous included download limits (I'll straighten out a few
&gt; options in the next day or so but the most likely base level is 1500
&gt; Megabytes per month included)

Hmm... Personally, I'm interested in ADSL for the always-on, static IP, and
high bandwidth when I need it. I would _rarely_ download 1.5G in a month...
hence, I'd prefer not to pay for unused Mb... Comparing with Telstra's
options, I think 1500Mb is huge... Could you perhaps offer 500Mb base as
well (perhaps with slightly more expensive per-Mb excess charges, like
mobile phone companies do?) Assuming the difference between the 500Mb and
1500Mb per month accounts is ~$0.15 * 1000, that's of the order of $150 per
month difference that would mean that I personally, couldn't afford to take
on ADSL... Unless you could afford to do this at the price you mentioned
previously (&lt;$100/month), which I doubt... :)

&gt; - No PPPoE software required

simpler -&gt; better... suits me...

&gt; - Residential gateway or NAT device or suitability NAT configured
&gt; linux box needed for &gt; 1 ethernet host to talk to the Internet at
&gt; once [*]

again, suits me -- however, I'd suggest that you ensure that you are able to
offer your customers a complete solution for whatever they need... Perhaps
just put a residential gateway on your options list...

&gt;
&gt; [*] This is the one I'm most interested in feedback on - it's the
&gt; normal way that ISP's deliver ADSL (and its why there are so many
&gt; 'residential gateway' products out there to address this for
&gt; households with more than one ethernet host).

IMHO, you just need to make it simple to move from one box to multiple boxes
with NAT to multiple boxes with Static IPs...

&gt;
&gt; I think it's ok, but I want to make sure its ok enough before I set
&gt; it in stone in procedural terms at Internode - we could deploy an
&gt; option allowing 5 direct connected hosts at a small extra cost, and
&gt; perhaps I ought to just do that, and see who wants it... as I write
&gt; this, sitting on one wireless host in my house, beside another one on
&gt; the ethernet, with a third lurking around the corner, I start to
&gt; wonder... :) )

That sounds like a small business connectivity plan to me :)
