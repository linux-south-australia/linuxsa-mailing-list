Hi.

The version used was '97. We were able to open it on a win2k box with
word2000 and plenty of memory. Changing it was another matter, but while
it was open it got printed to ps and run through ps2pdf. To produce
hardcopy, the consultants brought in a NT box for the same reasons. Word
and large documents have outbloated the capabilities of w9x.

If you have to use it for large documents, split it into smaller sections.
Doing it in one hit is courting disaster IMO. I'm tempted to take a look
at Lyx...

What'd a SVG ?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I concur. We had a bunch of consultants prepare a large document (14mb),
&gt; &gt;in word, and by the time they had finished none of them could open it on
&gt; &gt;their thinkpads! What a riot! I had to open it up on one of our boxes and
&gt; &gt;produce a pdf of a meg or so, so our people could read it. Page numbering
&gt; &gt;was generally screwed up.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I have heard of those sort of things with earlier versions of Word, and
&gt; can believe that they would get that big if people insist in inserting
&gt; graphics rather than SVGs (like EPS).
&gt; 
&gt; However, what of the recent versions of Word? Word 2000?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Word can be a terrible for large documents.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; As part of a project, I put together the final document. ~700 pages, ~20
&gt; &gt;&gt; jpeg images ~100 tables, footnotes, headers, footers.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; I had sections, chapters, appendixes the works.
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Word screwed up on me so many times, I ended up having to split it into
&gt; &gt;&gt; many documents. I just couldn't handle it.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
