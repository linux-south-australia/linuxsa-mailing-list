&gt; &gt;I understand the advantages of a centrally administered system, but what

&gt; 
&gt; Don't assume that schools with less money have less IT support. There are
&gt; some private schools out there with woeful IT managers (not teacher

I dont make that assumption I worked at one of these schools where the IT
management awas ppor, depsite having a huge network, fat link and laptops
wth every student.

Those kids knew nothign about computeres, they did know how to word
process though.
The IT manager knew not much either.
I suspect it was more marketing than true vision.

&gt; part-time efforts) and public schools with excellent support. Nowdays every
&gt; school has a few Parents with IT skills, and it shows in some smaller
&gt; schools that get input from mums and dads.

Yes but that is a problem as well.
teh fact they arenot professional means that when they get bored of it,
they leave, and then the school cn be really stucvk.

Because they are volunterers it is difficult to get them to write anything
down(ie document their work), which just makes it harder if they leave or 
are sick or whatyever.
If they get paid work, understandably they take it.

Also they are simply not always around when needed.

While useful and psiotive contributoers they dont always have the skills
required either.

In theory any network can be reomtely admisnieterd and shoudl require
virtually no admi intervention if properly designed, but reality  seems to
be different to theory.
It seems people assume school networks are different to commercial ones
in their need for sutiably trained staff?


&gt; I don't suppose anyone's written a get-linux-into-your-kids-school HOWTO for
&gt; free-time starved parents? :)

Getting it installed and in the kids hands is no problem., I am sure we
could arrange for Linuxsa volunteers to get linux running in any number of
schools for free.

However making it useful as a learning tool and keeping to going would be
a different story.
