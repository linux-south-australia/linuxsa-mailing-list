What was the error message exactly?
You really must be specific.
When querying about problems, _always_ give adequate details.
(This is something where Larry Wall's dictum is wrong.
Problem reports must be full and frank. There is only
one way to do it.)

Was it a "header file not located"?
Was it a "function not defined" or some other syntactic/semantic error?
Was it a link-time error?

People chastise me (in vain) for excessive verbosity, prolixity, garrulity and
loquacity. But it's better to err on the side of verbosity [etc.] than
to be so terse/brief/pithy that the facts have to be eeked out of you.

Yes, pcap does a great job.
Here's my little sample program (in C++):
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/src/bd/bd.c">http://www.topology.org/src/bd/bd.c</A>

You must include pcap.h and link to /usr/local/lib/libpcap.a
(or wherever your libpcap.a file is).

I think that the ethereal software uses pcap, and I'm certain
that tcpdump uses it.
In fact, I think it has bindings in most popular script languages.
Perl certainly has a binding.
It's quite popular with the black hats, I imagine.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
