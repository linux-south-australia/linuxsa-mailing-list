Hi Darryl and others,

Deeply sorry to all about the html in the e-mail.

You where right about running two copies of bind. I noticed earlier today
that it had stopped responding again, so I done a named.restart, and it did
not close the initial process off, but starting a second process thus giving
the permission denied errors in the log file. This still leaves me with the
inital problem of why it's either closing or crashing etc.

I cannot find any errors in the log file as to why, but I will have a look
in the Google site like you have suggested.

Thanks for your help Darryl


Wayne



&gt; Bind will give the those error messages when you have more than one copy
of
&gt; it running. The first copy of bind that is running will probably be ok,
the
&gt; second (and subsequent) copies will not be able to get sole access to the
&gt; DNS port, because the first copy of bind has it, so it stops listening on
&gt; that interface.
&gt;
&gt; The output you can see below is the copy of bind running as process 71302
&gt; telling you that it can't connect to the port numbers on those IP
addresses,
&gt; so it is stopping listing.

&gt; First off, you need to find out if there is indeed another copy of bind
&gt; running, try:
&gt;
&gt; ps aux | grep bind
&gt;
&gt; See how many copies you get. If there are indeed more than one running,
you
&gt; need to try and shut them all down, and then start one up, as you only
need
&gt; one running. If there is not more than one running, get back to me and
I'll
&gt; try to help you out a bit more.
&gt;
&gt; Now, as to why you have more than one running, there could be a number of
&gt; reasons, did you manually start bind without checking to see if it was
&gt; already running? Do you have a cron job that is starting it up? Do you
have
&gt; a script or cron job that is meant to restart it, but for whatever reason
it
&gt; doesn't kill it off properly? Hopefully those couple of ideas will get you
&gt; thinking about it a bit.
&gt;
&gt; I really recommend the book "DNS and Bind" published by O'Rielly.
(Actually,
&gt; I recommend any book that is published by O'Rielly, all of the ones that I
&gt; have seen/own are brilliant). I have the second edition and I don't think
I
&gt; would dare touch my nameservers without it on hand.
