&gt; You're a little harsh. :oP
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The key is in what Greg actually said: "RAID-1 is usually faster than
&gt;&gt; RAID-5, and never slower."
&gt;
&gt;&gt; You see, when you write a block to a RAID-5 setup, you have to read the
&gt;&gt; whole stripe in, insert the block, and recompute the parity. This can be a
&gt;&gt; whole lot slower than RAID-1 and RAID-1 can initiate reads on all drives
&gt;&gt; and take the closest block. It can also initiate independent reads on each
&gt;&gt; drive as well. And since writes do not need to re-compute the parity, they
&gt;&gt; will be at least as fast as RAID-5 writes, if not faster in most cases.
&gt;
&gt; Unless I didn't read your comment correctly...in which case I apologise...
&gt; you seem to suggest that RAID 1 writes quicker then RAID 5...this is true
&gt; ...I said RAID 5 "allows for greater access speed" than RAID 1...maybe I
&gt; should have been clearer...I was talking about READING only.

Hmm.  That wasn't clear either.

In fact, the access time is *not* faster for multi-disk transfers.
Remember that disk access latency is an average.  Rotational latency
is relatively easy to calculate: it's somewhere between 0 and one
revolution.  On a 7200 rpm drive, that's somewhere between 0 and 8.4
ms.  On average, it'll be 4.2 ms, but if you have two drives, you're
going to have one slower than the other, and on average one will take
more than 4.2 ms.  I wish I had the mathematical background to prove
this, but I'm sure that the more disks you add, the closer your
slowest positioning comes to the full 8.4 ms.  Since you need to wait
for all disks before transferring, this actually slows down the
access.

But what about the transfer time?  For a typical "big" block (8 kB)
from a typical modern IDE drive (16 MB/s), it amounts to 0.5 ms.
Divide that over 4 drives and it's 0.125 ms.  So you save 0.375 ms and
lose 4.2 ms.
