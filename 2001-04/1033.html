I think you might be right as I just setup another one the other day and all
the clients where behind a Masq firewall which has a live IP No. and was in
the DNS zone table. This setup worked just fine ie. the response was
instant.

Subject: RE: POPs mail problem with Outlook express


&gt; * I have setup several POP3 email servers recently using RH7.0 and I am
&gt; * experiencing some strange behaviour with Outlook express.
&gt; *
&gt; * On some w/s's the send/receive goes really quickly, on others
&gt; * it will have a delay of about 3 sec and no errors and on my test
&gt; * box here I found that when I rebooted the server the send/receive
&gt; * was slow but after a few goes (read 3 or 4 ) it suddenly speed
&gt; * up to the point I couldn't read the messages on the
&gt; * screen, which is about what I would expect across a LAN
&gt; *
&gt; * I also have removed all the firewall rules so that has
&gt; * nothing to do with it. There doesn't seem to be anything
&gt; * consistent to point me in the right direction.
&gt; * Does anyone have any ideas.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like your hosts file needs to be updated. Try populating it with
the
&gt; IP aaddresses and a name of the computers that are popping your server.
&gt; You'll find that the server does a lookup of each IP that it responds to,
&gt; and this may well be where the timeout is coming from.
