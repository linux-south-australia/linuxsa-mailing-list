andrew,


&gt; Maybe you could consider it in a similar way to Ximian with GNOME.
&gt; Ximian don't close up their code and do the commercial giant jig,
&gt; they're supporting Open Source Software and its development with money.
&gt; Sad as it is, it does make the world go round.

Likewise, without the finances of VA Linux, then freshmeat, source forge, 
slashdot, news forge, think geek and many other online sites would not be where 
they are today...

&gt; 
&gt; While I don't use Debian, I think to say that Progeny goes against the
&gt; original ideals of Debian is a little wrong. While it has been
&gt; developed
&gt; by people with a passion for free, Open Source software, it _is_
&gt; licensed under a license which permits the modification and
&gt; redistribution of the software, so long as the modified source code is
&gt; made freely available.

True, i guess that I am used to the commercial = crap (read M$) I use debian, 
debian rox, and I would hate to see it change!

&gt; 
&gt; Why would someone like Progeny want to change Debian and make it
&gt; commercial? Well the answer is, they probably don't. Again, I'll use
&gt; the
&gt; Ximian / GNOME relationship as an example. Ximian, IMHO, have pollished
&gt; GNOME to make it more 'commercially viable' and ready  for the masses.
&gt; Installing and upgrading GNOME has never been easier.

After playing with SuSe, RedHat and Turbolinux IMHO debian is the best 
installer I have seen. However, a newbie or someone from a M$ background may 
not see it that way, then that is where Progeny may come in, as have redhat in 
the past.

&gt; 
&gt; Without knowing the Corporate strategy that Progeny has adopted, I
&gt; can't
&gt; be sure, but I'd hazard a guess and say that they're trying to do a
&gt; similar thing. Ximian have got over $US15 Million in investment, plus
&gt; deals with big companies such as Sun, HP, Compaq, IBM. If they play
&gt; their cards right they _may_ succeed in pushing Linux to the corporate
&gt; headlines (more often).

Progeny sure is a cool sounding name though...

&gt; 
&gt; I don't see them as a bad thing at all. If they want to put money into
&gt; developing Open Source Software, good on them.




cheers
