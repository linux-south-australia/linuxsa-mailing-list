Having heard both Mark's and Simon's explanation, I am pretty happy.

I am just waiting for a bill for the modem I have and instructions on how
to switch over to the static IP ... 


&gt;The ongoing cost on the static IP is to our forward costs to APNIC; 
&gt;The real issue for us is that the Telstra 'wholesale' model is so 
&gt;puntative that we can't make it any cheaper without loosing money. 
&gt;That's the constraint we face. So instead, I decided to try really 
&gt;hard to deliver higher value for that price point (which, I might 
&gt;add, is certainly circa $10 per month more than the nearest 
&gt;equivalent telstra plan point, though the excess rates are
&gt;lower - and are the place in which we have some room to negotiate).
&gt;
&gt;It's a hard issue. Telstra really are trying hard to screw over the 
&gt;wholesale market. This is the best that we can currently do, and we 
&gt;need to build up a customer base in order to have any leverage to try 
&gt;to argue our internal costs down (and hence be able to move the 
&gt;external ones down).
&gt;
&gt;I'm obviously, however, highly interested in feedback like this, and 
&gt;if we don't hit a high enough sales rate at the current price point, 
&gt;I will have to do the sums on the impact on us of winding it down a 
&gt;tad - but because the economics are so bad for us internally, that 
&gt;would probably push financial break even (in theory) out from 18 
&gt;months to 3-5 years. It's that sensitive a cost model unfortunately.
&gt;
&gt;So I'm asking for support of a local company doing it 'right', and 
&gt;yes, I'm actually asking for more money than the nearest telstra plan 
&gt;- but for a higher delivered value.
&gt;
&gt;In the end, you need to make a judgement call on whether the higher 
&gt;delivered value is worth an extra 43 cents per day.
&gt;
&gt;Again, comments sincerely appreciated and I'm listening.

&gt;&gt;Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have looked at the Internode plan, and at first I was perturbed by the
&gt;&gt;cost of the 1.5GB/month service, until I calced the cost of 1.5GB at
&gt;&gt;18c/MB. It is around $290 ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So, it seems Internode is passing on a goodly proportion of their volume
&gt;&gt;discounts to us at that rate.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;However, I am still a little perturbed at the $145/m price tag for 500MB/mo
&gt;&gt;and static IP given that we are asked to pay for the ADSL modem. Can it
&gt;&gt;really cost all that much to maintain the static IP?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
