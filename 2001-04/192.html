&gt; The problem is that
&gt; even though setserial advises that the ttyS* ports are there
&gt; and configured correctly, and the Linux side of things are
&gt; set up (ie mgetty etc. it was almost identical setup to the
&gt; dialin 1 config), I cannot 'find' the third modem when I use
&gt; any terminal programs like minicom or wvdial.

Minicom generally uses /dev/modem as the modem to try and talk to. If
/dev/modem doesn't exist or links to the wrong device, you may have a
problem talking to it.

&gt; Also the modem doesn't pick up the incoming call and pass
&gt; it on to mgetty.

Well, the sequence is somewhat different to that. If you've got an
external modem, you'll notice that when you call the phone number that
modem is connected to, a little light flashes. Mgetty waits for one of
these flashes, or signals as mgetty reads them, and does something like
answer the call with them.

&gt;     I think that the not seeing the 3rd modem is the problem
&gt; here, but I don't know what to do to fix it. The modem
&gt; detects the incoming call (the Ring Indicator light comes
&gt; on). I think that because the system cannot see the modem
&gt; connected to the port it also isn't picking up the Ring
&gt; signal from the modem and so isn't firing up mgetty and
&gt; subsequently pppd.

Is there anything in inittab for mgetty on /dev/ttyS3? There should be
if you want it to answer the call. Just a clarification -- mgetty is
_always_ running in these circumstances. In inittab, the respawn option
is generally specified. This means that as soon as one instance of the
process (mgetty) dies, another starts.

&gt;     The usual method of checking for a modem is to send an
&gt; init string to the port and if it receives an OK signal
&gt; back, then there is a modem connected to that line. Is there
&gt; anything people can suggest to help here? Are there any
&gt; other methods of checking serial ports for modems? Are there
&gt; any other ways to initialise (or send any data) to a modem?

Can you use other devices on this port? For example, a serial mouse or
something similar. One thing I'd ask is, how many physical serial ports
does this beast have? /dev/ttyS0-3 means 4 ports. Do you have any bizare
hardware inside this machine to give you the phyical plugs?
