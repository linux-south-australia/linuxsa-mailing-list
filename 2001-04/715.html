&gt; &gt; It seems that Microsoft has been very effective at getting 
&gt; parts of their
&gt; &gt; MSCE and MSxx taught at schools and TAFEs (and perhaps 
&gt; institutions of
&gt; &gt; higher learning) around Australia, and perhaps the whole world.
&gt; 
&gt; I can vouch for the around the world bit. Where I am 
&gt; education is free.
&gt; No HECS no fees, nothing. (However, alot of people still 
&gt; can't "afford"
&gt; it. That is, they can't afford their kids to go to school and 
&gt; not work)
&gt; 
&gt; Being MS certified (whatever good that really is) is a big 
&gt; deal here. A
&gt; very big deal. People get hired just because of that - because usually
&gt; they will be supporting third party application running on NT. So all
&gt; they can really know is NT.
&gt; 
&gt; From what I have seen of these people, is that they only know 
&gt; technology
&gt; from MS point of view. Ie.:
&gt; o  TCP/IP is a MS protocol (because it says so in the hardware wizard)
&gt; o  DHCP always looks like it does on the NT config screens
&gt; o  What's postscript?
&gt; o  IE and IIS are how the internet works (this is a bit dramatic, but
&gt; for the most part, people may know that there are other web
&gt; servers/proxies but dont care. They accept that MS is the 
&gt; best and dont
&gt; bother to compare. There textbooks probably didn't)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; While this is a legitimate business strategy, it has 
&gt; profound implications
&gt; &gt; for the future of the Australian computer industry and our 
&gt; children, in my
&gt; &gt; view.
&gt; 
&gt; As a friend pointed out, MS are like IBM, and in the bad old days when
&gt; IBM was the monopoly, people would never get fired for buying 
&gt; IBM. These
&gt; days, people will never get fired for buying MS.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. It creates a perception among future technologists that 
&gt; there is only
&gt; &gt;    one solution, one way of doing things: The Microsoft way.
&gt; 
&gt; Absolutely. My comment above about not comparing things is a result of
&gt; people not being taught to doubt and review and make there own
&gt; judgements. But they cant because they have not been exposed 
&gt; to anything
&gt; else.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; 2. It creates a nation of technology users, not technology 
&gt; producers.
&gt; &gt;    It seems to me that these people are then totaly dependent on
&gt; &gt;    someone else's technology, and are far less likely to 
&gt; create their
&gt; &gt;    own technology for our future benefit.
&gt; 
&gt; Spot on again.
