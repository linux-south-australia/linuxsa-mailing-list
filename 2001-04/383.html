&gt; now machine1 is to run www,ns,mail, etc... machine2 is to act as a firewall

Should machine 1 be accessable by someone from the outside world via
machine 2?

Am I to understand that you want machine2 to act soley as a router and
have all the services running on machine1?

&gt; what I have working so far is that a machine in the LAN is 203.4.5.5,
&gt; eth0 on machine1 is 203.4.5.1, eth1 on machine1 is 203.4.5.2, eth0 on 
&gt; machine2 is 203.4.5.3 and ppp0 is a totally different subnet from the 
&gt; service provider. now the problem that I am having seems to be with the 
&gt; routing, after fiddling around the only way that I could work out to make 
&gt; machine1 route properly was to do this
Are you attempting to get the LAN to access the Internet through ppp0 on
machine 2? If so, you should be using NAT (or masquerading) to do this.
You should be protecting your LAN from direct access to the Internet
(having their own live IPs is bad practise generally) and only have the
one IP (which will be assigned to ppp0 on machine 2).

You can do that with IPChains:

ipchains -A forward -p tcp -s 10.1.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -j MASQ

If you're running SQUID, you could do HTTP transperant proxy with

ipchains -A input -p tcp -s 10.1.0.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 80 -j REDIRECT 8080

Adjust the addresses/ports for your setup.

&gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.1 eth0
&gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.2 eth1
&gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.3 eth1
&gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.4 eth0
&gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.5 eth0
&gt; /sbin/route add -host 203.4.5.6 eth0
&gt; and so on because the rest of the machines on the lan are using the rest of 
&gt; this subnet, ie. the only two addresses which are associated with eth1 are 
&gt; 203.4.5.2 and .3 because .3 is machine2. Now is there an easier way to do 
&gt; this with route???
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; the other problem that I am having is that in this present configuration I 
&gt; can get all machines to see each other properly however machine1 and the lan 
&gt; cannot get through to the internet, they know that the GW is 203.4.5.3 but 
&gt; they can only get that far, it is as if 203.4.5.3 does not have a route back 
&gt; to 203.4.5.2 so how do I do this???? machine2(203.4.5.3) can see the net and 
&gt; works fine.
This is probably related to the machine 2 (the firewall) not being
configured to forward packets. Use the above IPChains command to
masquerade the traffic. You may also need to do this first to turn on IP
forwarding:

echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

&gt; on a separate note I am having trouble with ssh connecting from server to 
&gt; server across the net. When I try to connect I get a message like 'bad 
&gt; packet length 795178083' and on the server that I am trying to connect to I 
&gt; get /etc/ssh/primes does not exist. This only happens when I try to connect 
&gt; from linux to linux if I use putty and connect from windows-linux the 
&gt; connection works fine.
Have you tried SSHing with debugging?
