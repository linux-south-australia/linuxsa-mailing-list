DSL (with rare exceptions) already -is- ATM based under the hood.

It's only Telstra's stupid wholesale 'service', which is screwed in 
ways that I won't even begin to do justice to in a short rant here, 
that stops us having end to end access to the ATM PVC between the 
customer premises equipment and 'our end'.

We are working on deploying our own hardware (initially in the 
Adelaide square mile CBD area) which will let us offer far more 
interesting services than those which Telstra limits us to with their 
wholesale service.

But in the meantime, that's what we have, and that's what I've been 
planning a service over - as any ADSL is better than no ADSL - its 
-very- nice indeed, and such a step beyond a modem that it's 
mind-boggling.

So other than John's view that we ought to ignore Telstra and change 
the world ourselves (we're working on it :) ) - has anyone else got 
any other thoughts about the service I proposed in my message? Would 
you use it?

&gt;Whatever happened to ATM over DSL? It always seemed to me that this was the
&gt;most practical way towards making money out of plain copper instead of the
&gt;razor-thin margins of high-speed net access to end users. Why not plan to
&gt;give end users the whole 1.5/2/6 Mbits/s available, but only give them their
&gt;Internet access on a virtual circuit with a CIR? Much easier than to
&gt;maintain than traffic-shaping access lists etc.
&gt;
&gt;Then with the leftover bandwidth, sell them voice services, gaming services,
&gt;unlimited saix access, pay-per-mb faster downloads, security system
&gt;monitoring and even profit-sharing with the local video shop for streaming
&gt;media, all as cheap incremental upgrades.
&gt;
&gt;  Granted, consumer-priced ATM gear might be hard to source right now, and
&gt;there's probably end-user education issues to contend with, but sooner or
&gt;later there will be an virtual-circuit-capable ADSL box with PSTN &lt;-&gt; VoIP
&gt;phone plugs (oh wait, there's already a low-end cisco with that..) and
&gt;RCA/S-Video jacks to plug into the home entertainment system. It's already
&gt;established that people will happily pay $40/month for foxtel.. why not plan
&gt;for the bigger slice of disposable income?
