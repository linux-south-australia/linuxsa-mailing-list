I've also got a concern. It seems that this alleigence to Microsoft
stems from the powers that be (DETE/SA Government).

DETE has done the noble deed of arranging with Microsoft a 'black pack'
for all of the schools. This 'black pack' is essentially a collection of
Microsoft Software that the school has unlimitted licensing for.

While this does cater for the larger part of the software requirements
for schools, it does not cater for the software required for the more
'advanced' courses that are way out of Microsoft's depth.

For instance, Macromedia products are hugely expensive when on the scale
of 200+ licenses. Yes, there are Site Licenses available, but at a cost.
Schools just don't have the kind of cash required to purchase this
software.

For schools who don't know better, they'll install Windows 98/ME/2000 on
any machine they can get their hands on. They'll forget about Macs
because it's easier to use Microsoft.

Eventually, schools are going to be left with a completely Microsoft IT
infrastructure. This is exceedingly harmful. A school is a place for
learning, not corporate back scratching. What ever happened to getting
more Macs in the school[1]? While you're at it, get some Sun Rays or X
Workstations. Let the students learn about as many environments as
possible.

But, no. It seems that our friends at DETE/SA Government have other
ideas. The initiatives between DETE and Microsoft continue to roll in,
while the alternatives seem to be swept under the mat in attempt to get
rid of them.

Now DETE will argue that Linux isn't a viable Environment in Schools,
heck -- they'll argue that Macs aren't viable in schools[2]. The bottom
line is that Microsoft are monopolising the Education market. Students
are growing up learning Microsoft Technologies. That's not a bad thing,
but to learn Microsoft and Microsoft only is.

The problem with this is more than just an issue of corporate dominance.
It's about the staff too. The teaching staff become familiar and
comfortable in the products that they use most often. I know plenty of
teaching staff that won't hear of 'that Apple crap' or 'UNIX on the
Desktop' because they don't feel comfortable with it. They'll argue till
they're blue in the face if they have to. If they don't have anything
factual to base their comments on (regarding Macintosh or UNIX, for
example) they generally just say 'It's no good. What's the next idea?'

In fairness, not all teaching staff are like this. The unfortunate
reality is that the majority are.

&gt; It seems that Microsoft has been very effective at getting parts of their
&gt; MSCE and MSxx taught at schools and TAFEs (and perhaps institutions of
&gt; higher learning) around Australia, and perhaps the whole world.

How disturbing. I think that this is an issue that the Education System
has do deal with as well. Students are there to get Educated, not
brainwashed.

&gt; While this is a legitimate business strategy, it has profound implications
&gt; for the future of the Australian computer industry and our children, in my
&gt; view.

It's ethically wrong. While it is Microsoft's 'problem', I don't think
that the majority of the 'blame' should be put on them. The
Administrators of the Education System are just as much to blame, if not
more than Microsoft. If they are not competent enough to make these sort
of decisions, they shouldn't be in power. This is an issue that boils
down to DETE's employment 'strategy', but that's another matter.

&gt; Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps Microsoft is the best thing since sliced bread,
&gt; and I have a perverse and wicked desire to find something bad in
&gt; Microsoft's generosity in having shared their wonderful technology with us
&gt; all, and if so, can someone please tell me so?

You are completely right, Richard. Microsoft is 'corrupting' the minds
of students. Perhaps that word is a little strong, but I think it
expresses my point quite clearly.

&lt;shakes head in disbelief&gt;

It's all quite sad, when I think about it.
