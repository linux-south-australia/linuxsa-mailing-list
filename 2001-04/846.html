&gt; &gt; Well I cant see how that would be economical for most shchools who cant
&gt; &gt; afford  $1200 Pcs, let alone $20k servers and $1k thin clients.
&gt; 
&gt; What type of thin clients? I think you'll find that the SunRay's are
&gt; quite cheap. Well under $1K. And the servers? Well, they're a lot more
&gt; than $20K. That is, if we're talking Sun.

Sun are trying to do really good deals with schools at the moment. The
figures Mark Collis mentioned are accurate.

&gt; &gt; Ciriix migth be more affordable at least ahrdware wise, I am not sure what
&gt; &gt; the lsincesing cost for that would be.
&gt; 
&gt; Citrix, while with its uses is old and clunky. Citrix in a school must
&gt; be like death by torture :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Citrx is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. Not cheap enough
&gt; for a school, anyway.

I think he was talking about Cyrix :-)

&gt; $50/hour?! Damn cheap consultant for UNIX related stuff. A properly
&gt; setup machine would only have to be rebooted and be fixed up in seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; A properly setup IT Infrastructure would have 1 or two 'ready made' PCs
&gt; on a shelf. If a PC in the labs dies, pull it off the shelf and stick it
&gt; in the lab. Fix the broken one and stick it on the shelf. It's really
&gt; not that hard.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A linux system is easy for you to adminsiter, but not so easy for an
&gt; &gt; average person or an average teacher, even an "IT coordinator".
&gt; 
&gt; NT isn't exactly a joy to work with either, you know. People struggle
&gt; for days on end with NT configuration. I know that I could have got it
&gt; done under Linux in about 1 hour.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a lot easier than you think. A person armed with Mandrake and an
&gt; APC Linux PocketBook is well equipped for setting up Linux. Even for the
&gt; first time.


And could be made even easier. I agree with the NT stuff you mentioned,
there are schools paying $100 an hour for NT/2K "Consultants" and
"Engineers" to drink coffee.
