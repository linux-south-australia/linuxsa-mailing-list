Thanks all those who offered help.  I apologise for not being completely
Linux-specific, and also for asking for help without doing a bit of my
own research first.  It won't happen again!

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to register a web site with search engines.  Having never
&gt; &gt; &gt; attemtped this before, I'd be grateful if someone could give me some
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointers on how to go about it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Although this is something that you should probably be searching Google
&gt; &gt; for, I'll give a few pointers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While the registration process for each Search Engine is fundamentally
&gt; &gt; the same, they all tend to vary slightly.
&gt; 
&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; I agree this is not very linux-specific, except that linux and BSD users
&gt; are more likely than mac and ms users to stick their home machine on
&gt; the end of a permanent link and set up a web server.
&gt; 
&gt; I went through the same thing a couple of years ago wehn I wanted
&gt; to register my first web domain.
&gt; Now I've got 17 domains, and I get pestered continually by all those
&gt; search engines probing, probing, probing.....
&gt; 
&gt; When you create a new domain (if that's what you've done), you'll
&gt; generally get a few offers from commercial concerns offering to
&gt; register your site with 50,000 search engines.
&gt; 
&gt; But in fact, you'll find that shortly after you create a new domain,
&gt; the search engines come and index it.
&gt; 
&gt; The other day, I made a configuration error in my new Apache config file,
&gt; and as I left it overnight with an unintended virtual host in place,
&gt; I got a complete indexing by two search engines before I woke up
&gt; the next day.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, here's my answer to the question.
&gt; Go to this page:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/websearch.html">http://www.topology.org/websearch.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; And click on the items marked "Add URL".
&gt; Some of these links may still be valid after the last 12
&gt; months of not checking them.
&gt; 
&gt; Nowadays some search engines want you to pay to be indexed.
&gt; But if you just register with a handful of free-indexing engines,
&gt; the rest will come and find you anyway, including the search
&gt; engines in France, China, Japan etc. etc.
&gt; And some of them just download everything at your full link rate.
&gt; (Not good if you have 60 MB of material!)
&gt; 
&gt; And then you'll need to get a bandwidth throttler to stop them
&gt; all wasting your bandwidth.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.

&gt; PS. Here's an example ad:

&gt; Note the way they use a female name and the word "love" to

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I visited xxxxxxxx.com and I noticed that you are not listed on some search
&gt; +engines. I am sure you can increase the number of people who visit
&gt; +xxxxxxxx.com . Do you know TrafficMagnet? TrafficMagnet is a unique
&gt; +technology that automatically submits your web site to over 300,000+ search
&gt; +engines and directories every month. This is a very low-cost and effective way
&gt; +of advertising your site.
&gt; 
&gt; To check our prices and submit xxxxxxxx.com to 300,000+ search engines, go
&gt; +to TrafficMagnet.net
&gt; 
&gt; I would love to hear from you.
&gt;
