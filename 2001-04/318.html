 &gt; original code, would I then have to provide the complete code (or
 &gt; modified library if done this way) for this new product. Or am I

You can do anything you want with your own creation -- The license is
there to describe what people are allowed (or aren't allowed) to do
if:

 1.  they don't own the code, 

*AND*

 2.  they have agreed with the terms of the license.

Usually use of the code signifies agreement with the license terms,
but you might be limiting your options somewhat if you produce a license
which begins with, "By opening this package...", because then the license
won't bind those people who don't open the package (e.g., if they get
the software from a friend).

You are free to relicense your code as often as you like;  You can 
dictate different license terms for each and every recipient if you 
wish.  One thing you can't do, though, is replace someone's license
after they've already agreed to be bound by it, unless the original
license permits such a change (so if you release something under the
GPL, you can't later turn around and say that exactly the same code
is now totally restricted and all users need to pay royalties to you:
Existing users will get to choose whether they want to be bound by the
old license or the new, and your new license will only affect people
who get the new code FROM YOU).
