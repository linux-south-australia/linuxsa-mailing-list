&gt; &gt; I think, perhaps incorrectly, that the question you are asking is: "in a

&gt; &gt; platform?"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think the answer is "yes". I also think that such environments are
&gt; &gt; relatively rare, and I doubt that you have one :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I think the answer is no. The environment I worked in was a
&gt; single user, me, collating documents written by others and me.

"By others" indicates you didn't have a closed environment. And it doesn't
sound like you tuned it either.

My point is if you spend long enough you can tune the environment such
that you don't get such problems. Writing macros, avoiding certain
features, tweaking DLL versions, adding optional extras etc etc. Of course
it is not worthwhile for a one-man show, but some companies do this when
they have substantial closed projects. They know that Word is an
unreliable solution but that it can be made to be reliable if tuned and
used in a closed environment. For whatever reason, they tune it.

Windows 3.11 and 9x are a similar proposition - inherently unreliable if
you control all parameters of the environment and spend enough time and
money you can make sure it just about never crashes for the one or two
applications you have tuned it for. One large bank I know has retained a
large team of programmers to do nothing but this.

I have been involved in these sorts of dead-end exercises before, so I
know this sort of thing is both possible and frustrating.
