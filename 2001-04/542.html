&gt; &gt; Neither. Believe what you like regarding M$. Install a good Hardware

&gt; &gt; about software raid?

"MS will never know about it"? I wish it was possible to get such a thing
such that no OS knew about it, ie transparent RAID that appears to be like
a single SCSI drive of a very common type with a well-debugged driver.
I've seen such things many years ago and there's a Macintosh here
somewhere with an Adaptec card that does just this. It seems strange that
someone hasn't done this for ATA drives because there is pretty much just
one driver set for all ATA drives, thus meaning the market is potentially
quite large.

But I've had no success finding a modern version of this, everything wants
its own special drivers, and they always seem to sneak in some
RAID-controlling features to the driver which is exactly what I don't
want.

Anyone had better success at finding transparent hardware RAID than me?
