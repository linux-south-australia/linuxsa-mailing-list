The primary role of a system admin is to keep the users happy.  I suggest 
that anyone who tried to be the BOFH will soon be looking for a new job.

&gt; &gt; Furthermore, since when do system

&gt; &gt; the system from helping to run the system.
&gt;
&gt;since they discovered that letting users "help" to run the system is more
&gt;trouble than it's worth. Most sysadmins I know would not let users near a
&gt;root account. Note that having input into how the system is run is quite
&gt;different to running it... Every good sysadmin should be responsive to the
&gt;needs of his or her users, and part of this involves being sure that they
&gt;know exactly what is happenning on the network, and not allowing other
&gt;people to make "unauthorised" changes... Given what you say later, I think
&gt;you agree, but that sentence doesn't sit well with me...
&gt;I think Stephen was saying "we" as in his specific situation... I could be
&gt;wrong though...

You bloody better be.  I work with Stephen.
