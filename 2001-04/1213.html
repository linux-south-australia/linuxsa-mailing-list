<H1>bsd for linux users?</H1>

Hello, list:

I am interested in expanding my interests in unix, and trying to have some
fun with FreeBSD 4.3. It looks pretty similar to linux (mandrake and redhat,
for instance), but there are some differences. In looking through the web
there doesn't seem to be the same wealth of information available as for
linux users. There's no ldp-compatible site, for instance.

As linux users, have any of you out there ventured into bsd, and are there
any resources that you would recommend to me? I have heard great things
about "The Complete FreeBSD" second edition. Since that's not available as
free hypertext, I'm hoping to find some more accessible resources before
committing to this OS.

As an example, I have a Xircom RBEM-56G PCMCIA lan/modem card. What do I do
to configure this? It is so easy in linux... ;]

Thanks,

Ian Hogben
