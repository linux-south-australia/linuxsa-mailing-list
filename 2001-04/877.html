 &gt; I guess everyone has their own specific needs/wants regarding provision of

 &gt; I think Internode fall short in a couple of areas. (Sorry Simon)
 &gt; 1. the allowance/cap is still too low it should be minimum of 1gb/month

There's a 1.5 Gbyte/month option.

 &gt; 2. The setup costs are fine
 &gt; 3. The monthly access should be no more than 80 it's more than BP now (I
 &gt; understand the wholesale price issue) 

Don't compare apples with oranges:  you get a better package than BP 
delivers too.

 &gt; I guess in the end if I could get ADSL 256/64 for 200 install, 75/month,
 &gt; without the cap or with a 1gb ALLOWANCE per month then it would not be an
 &gt; issue I would sign up tomorrow. I know of people who are prepared to pay
 &gt; 200-300 a month for 1.5/1.5 MB with no caps.
 
Hang on -- Do you think there's actually a cap in the sense that it 
stops working after that many megabytes?

Oh, wow - there might be a perception issue here:  "cap" isn't a word 
Internode uses in the materials published for this service, it's a word
which someone else on this list has introduced.  To clarify:  You can 
download as much as you want with no restrictions whatsoever, with the
proviso that megabytes downloaded in excess of the amount included in
your price plan will be charged at $0.18 each (which, I might add, is 
cheaper than Telstra's retail megabyte rates).

If you think you'll use 2 Gbytes/month, then you can get onto the
1.5 Gbyte/month plan and pay an extra $90 per month (500 Mbytes * 0.18c/Mbyte).

Note that other Internode permanent link price plans are available on
these services too:  If you think you'll regularly do very high data
volumes, the sales staff can put you on a non-standard price plan.

 &gt; Sorry for the length of the post, but I think I am reasonable as the data
 &gt; content is getting fatter and the allowances/caps are a REAL pain and
 &gt; providers setup costs OUCH!

Perhaps we're thinking of different things when we hear the word "cap".
