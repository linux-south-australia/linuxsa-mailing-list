&gt; Yes but that is a problem as well.
&gt; teh fact they arenot professional means that when they get bored of it,
&gt; they leave, and then the school cn be really stucvk.
&gt; 
&gt; Because they are volunterers it is difficult to get them to write anything
&gt; down(ie document their work), which just makes it harder if they leave or
&gt; are sick or whatyever.
&gt; If they get paid work, understandably they take it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also they are simply not always around when needed.

So, you make form a system which is relatively bullet-proof with
whatever form of administration that takes your family (browser-based
ones seem to be quite popular and reasonably effective). Your library
staff or IT teachers could be responsible for the user account
management (which they would be anyway in smaller schools) someone is
responsible for changing backup tapes each night and file and print
shares would be managed in the same way user accounts were. All of the
workstations would be locked down to their fullest, but still stay
functional and because they're running Unix, you could properly restrict
the use of applications and who can make changes to which things. This
would dramatically reduce the maintenance of the machines (just a magic
disk to grab an image off a server in any one of a number of ways) and
the only time someone would be paid a heap is for setting it up (which
could easily still cost less than the equivalent Microsoft Solution).
tada!
