I agree, you can't go on forever like this. BUT, remmember that BIND 8
is one of the most used name server programs on the Internet. It's not
one of those things that you can just say 'It's not going to effect that
many people, we'll start again'.
 
&gt; Who would argue that the way MSDOS 6 treats memory (640K limit, etc) is a
&gt; majorly stupid way of doing things?? Now, who can remember why they did like
&gt; that? backward compatibility with MSDOS v0.0.0.0.0.1 or something stupid.

MSDOS treats a lot of things in a majorly stupid way. That's what MSDOS
does. That analogy is not one that I think can be applied to BIND 8.
BIND 8 doesn't do many things stupidly. Apart from the security holes
that have popped up over time, BIND 8 is great.

I and many others are quite comfortable with the config and zone file
syntax. I don't have a problem with change, I just wonder why it's
necessary.

&gt; Sometimes you just need to start from scratch with a new system and forget
&gt; about the old one.

Yeah, I agree. Think of it in the 2.4 kernel networking rewrite. It was
done in a mannar that doesn't force the SysAdmin's out there to
completely reconfigure there networking subsystem. IPTables is an
example. While it has a bunch of cool features not found in IPChains,
the use of IPChains is still supported. An approach like this to BIND
would have been nice.

Anyway, no use whinging about the way BIND developers do there thing, it
doesn't really change anything.
