&gt; &gt; There are a lot of proeffesional sys admins for unix systems on this list
&gt; &gt; I believe.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I bet not one of them is willing to telltheir boss they could be replaced
&gt; &gt; by the receptionist once the install is done.
&gt; 
&gt; No, but that is not the same. Most of the Sys Admins on this list are
&gt; working work companies that require more than schools. Schools don't
&gt; need much, but it has to be there and cheap. If you were to create an
&gt; interface that was simple (and it *is* possible) and stick it on a Linux
&gt; box, they *could* run it themselves. It would take minimal training and
&gt; be quite effective. There would be no ongoing admin that couldn't be
&gt; done by a user (how often do you think schools would need to modify
&gt; their packet filtering rules?).


So schools are less important than for profit organisations?
They need the exact smae things.
Systems that work reliably and with a minmimum of fuss and achieve the
intended end result.
They tycpially have medium size netowrks, eg a hundred or more hosts, with
permanent or smei permanant internet access.
they probably have a ptnetally more malicuous users, with probably
typcially less training.

The only real differnece is they cnat afford to pay for it generally.
Particarlarly at consultant rates.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is one of the most important issues that the IT Community at large
&gt; &gt; &gt; is going to have to deal with. Education is what our future(s) stem
&gt; &gt; &gt; from. Let's not mess it up with the help of monopolising corporate
&gt; &gt; &gt; evils.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It certainly is a very important area.
&gt; &gt; I happento personally believe that this discussionis ignoring fundamental
&gt; &gt; falws in current policy however.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence people discussing it. So that we can work out the flaws and find a
&gt; way to move around them. Standing back saying 'no' all of the time is
&gt; not helping to iron out the problems you are pointing out.

No but neither is simply saying we should replace this with that.
Change for the sake of change is not helpful either, In fact it is
disruptive.

Anaylyse the reason for cahnge and the likely outcomes. Is that change
needed?
What willit bring?
What will we lose with it?
How will it be accepted by the users? What effedt will that level of
acceptanve have onthe end reult?
Is there an altrnative?
Is it less dispruptive?


You say find out the flaws,. Well that is what I ahve been trying to do.
Unless you ocnmsider all of the cons as well as the pros you will nto come
up wewith an optimium solution.
The advantages we know about. And in this case I am not convicned the
pros outweigh the cons.

To my mind that is not being negative that is taking a look at the info
you have available.

Now I ahve nto said there are no solution to this problem.
But I also dont necessarily agree that there is a problem in many cases in
this problem domain.

Think critcially.

Dont become a linux drone. That is just as bad as an MS drone.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I really dont MS products in schools are the problem(there are not always
&gt; &gt; the solution either).
&gt; 
&gt; There is no *the* problem, but they are a problem (well they are for the
&gt; schools I have discussed this with).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I do belvie that ihnadequate traning and support mechanisms are the
&gt; &gt; problem and could be reaosnbly easily9but not cheaply) corrected.
&gt; 
&gt; Another problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But then again spending money on PCs taht willnever be used properly or to
&gt; &gt; their fullest is I think false economy.
&gt; 
&gt; Another problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Like any tools you need properly qualified people to sue them to tehir
&gt; &gt; fullest. These peopel are lacking, through no fault of the classroom level
&gt; &gt; educator.

If we both agree there are lots of problems then i think the next logical
thinkg to do is decie which we migth be able to fix and which are th emost
important.

I feel that exisitng iporperly used equipment is worse.
i beleive that a to of the problems wpeople ahve with MS tuff they will
ahve with open source,because the problem is nto the product itself, it is
the lack of knowledge of hwo to emply that product properly.
