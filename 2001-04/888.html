This point is very debatable even eperienced unix administratorts make
mistakes as root.

And the mistakes can be very catastrophic.

Without clmaing to be an experiecned unix sys admin, my worst was killing
job %1, but oops I forgot the percent. Night night init. doh!.

I would very much argure that adminstrator privilidge on any system is
dangerous regardless, in inexperienced hands.

I migt also argue that with gui systems _soemtimes_ there is a more wordy
explanationof what you are about to do, assuign you read it, which is nto
there for clis.

&gt; with a *nix box even the monkey with a root password is less likely to screw

&gt; one administer can look after more than one school ... or business for that
&gt; matter. With simply tools like webmin a monkey (teacher [hehe]) can be setup
&gt; with the appropriate access to start and internet connection, stop and
&gt; internet connection, view the mail/samba logs etc, and add and remove users
&gt; from the system. Also with tools like ghost or drive image they can also
&gt; re-build any workstation within 5 minutes !

&gt; &gt; &gt; And they still wont have anyone to admin it, which makes it kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; useless.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, they don't at the moment so what's the difference?
&gt; 
&gt; Any monkey (read Teacher -- no offence to any teachers) can admin an NT
&gt; network (at least, according to the MS literature -- it's all just point and
&gt; click... I can do that!), but you need special skills to admin a *nix
&gt; network (a commando line?)
&gt; 
&gt; Note: this is the perception... the reality is that you need as much skill
&gt; to admin either _properly_, you just use different tools to do it, and any
&gt; monkey can't even look like they're adminning a *nix network...
