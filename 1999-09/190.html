&gt; Well, Mr. Dread, this might be a bad time to tell you, but formatting
&gt; the harddrive was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. If you'd read the
&gt; messages earlier today, you would have seen they were about how to
&gt; regain access and reset the passwords in just these sort of cases.
&gt;
&gt; However, it's obviously too late now.
&gt;
&gt; If you're starting from scratch you would be well off to get a recent
&gt; version of Red Hat, instead of 5.0. Not only will it be easier to
&gt; install and use, but also more secure.
&gt;
&gt; Now, you've admitted you don't really know anything about linux, but
&gt; that you've been pressured into this by your school. I would seriously
&gt; reccommend that your school goes out and hires a professional. Linux
&gt; isn't something you can master overnight. While I'm sure LinuxSA people
&gt; could coach you thru installing and setting up Squid, without knowledge
&gt; of security aspects of Linux, your server would only end up getting
&gt; hacked again.
&gt;
&gt; Linux is stable, powerful, and secure, when set up correctly. It is more
&gt; user-friendly than other Unix variants. However, it is still a far cry
&gt; from Windoze, where you just insert a CD, follow some defaults, and
&gt; reboot.
&gt;
&gt; It's encouraging to see another person attempting to learn how to use
&gt; it, but many people, especcially on this list, assume that as soon as
&gt; you know how to change directories and edit a file, that they're an
&gt; expert in the field.
&gt;
&gt; If you can't use punctuation or correct spelling in your email, and
&gt; blithely ignore the non-HTML-emails request for this mailling list, then
&gt; I don't like your chances at editting system files that will require
&gt; exact case and spelling, and probably a good reading of instructions.
&gt;
&gt; Yours,
&gt; Toby
