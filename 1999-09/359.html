Hi all... have found a few "funnies" in SuSE_6.2 & wondered whether
anyone else had seen them as well (& if so, whether they found a
fix/indentified the problem)

1. kppp is glitchy - would not work at all initially, so I renamed
/etc/ppp/options & just did a 'touch options' to get a blank file & I
was then able to get a working ppp connection abt every 3rd time.  Even
allowing for removing all the conf stuff out of /etc/ppp/options kppp
was still unreliable so I settled on wvdial & just added some stuff to
use my permanent ip etc etc, in the wvdial.conf

2. I added firewall & masquerading in YAST & rebooted.... couldnt get
"out" on any other box on my LAN, tried manually (at the console)
entering ipfwadm params
eg/ ipfwadm -F -p deny    and    ipfwadm -m -F -a accept -S192.168.1.3
-D0.0.0.0 (and various other variations when that didnt work!) and kept
getting this error
ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: No such file or directory. I cannot find
what it is that doesnt exist :)!

3. In desperation I ran up KFirewall ....  that worked , although I see
lots of "ipchains died" errors  ... but it does work, with 1 downside...
I have to boot kfirewall and set it all up again IF I shutdown that box,
(which wont happen often as its a permanent dialup BUTi it;s still
annoying!) I have rtfm'd but cannot find a .conf file for kfirewall and
cannot figure out why ipfwadm wont accept parameters that USED to work!!

So, anybody else seen any of this/figured out whats wrong/missing etc???

TIA, Phil
