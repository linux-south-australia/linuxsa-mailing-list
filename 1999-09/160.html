Firstly, the off-topic bit (skip this paragraph for the linux related
stuff): This is the only mailing list i'm subscribed to, and I don't haev
access to newsgroups, so this is the only place I know to ask, sorry.
Anyway, I may be getting a CD burner soon(ish), and have heard different
things about SCSI and IDE. Firstly, from this list I beleive I read that
SCSI is faster and more reliable than IDE, and IDE burners should be
avoided. I recently asked a huy at a computer shop, and he said that the IDE
burner's technology has improved, and is now better than the SCSI burners.
Can someone tell me (or tell me where to read) about the difference between
SCSI and IDE, and which type of burner I should get? I know of the price
difference, but to me speed and reliability (of the drive and the media
produced) is more important than initial cost.

Now, I sometimes read that redhat distro's have stability problems, speed
issues, etc. I would assume this is because of the way the packages are
compiled (all options avalible, least hardware specific details, etc). Does
this mean if I get the redhat source CD, extract all the packages I use,
edit the makefiles to reflect what I need and recompile everything, these
issues will go away? (I like rpms, since it makes packages easy to upgrade
and uninstall, so I'd like to continue to use rpms, if possible).

thanks,
Andy
