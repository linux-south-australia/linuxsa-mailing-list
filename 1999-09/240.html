&gt; Doh! Stupid html. Thanks for the info. I guess Jini would have problems
wrapping around existing legacy software. Is the

you did it again :)  -- html, I mean...

The problem in wrapping Jini/Java around legacy software is generally due to
the difficulty in doing anything with legacy software. Java/Jini are quite
capable of doing pretty much anything you want, but working with legacy
stuff sucks.

&gt; security in Java a mixture of serialization and encryption across the
network. I once wrote a chat system in Java that used
&gt; Sun's serialization and encryption methods to send message objects. I felt
that somehow this could be easily compromised

I don't see how -- depending on what encryption was used... IMHO, Java
security is at least as good as any other security, but it doesn't do it all
for you -- you need to design a secure system, and implement it in Java (or
whatever language -- the designing of the secure system is harder than the
implementing of it, unless you implement in COBOL or something... :)

&gt; (just give it to Sydney Uni). I am starting to get the impression that
IIOP is a lot more dynamic in nature than HTTP. It seems
&gt; that I could get much more immediate functionality out of IIOP objects
than HTTP block type communication. I was

Yes, you could get more functionality out of IIOP than HTTP, but it really
depends what you want to do. A PC is more functional than a pocket
calculator, but if you only want to calculate simple expressions, a pocket
calculator is more appropriate -- and if you need to calculate larger
expressions, a HP calculator is probably best. Point is, the right tool for
the job depends on the job, and getting the most flexible tool often means
that you have a lot more complexity to deal with.

&gt; wondering if anyone was aware of any training courses that dealt
specifically with CORBA?

probably -- try Camtech, or one of the other training-type places... I doubt
there is much Linux-specific training available. Another (really really
good, and relatively cheap) option is to buy a good book or six on the
subject. There are large numbers of books on CORBA, IIOP, Java, RMI, Linux,
Distibuted Programming, CGI, HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, RPC, and so on, as well
as books on most combinations of the above. There's also plenty of stuff on
the Internet, once you install a marketing dross filter... :)

&gt;
&gt;May the force be with you

With me the force is.
