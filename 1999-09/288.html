Agree Phil - I may be a Linux novice but the idea of security is a high
priority to me. If the information to bypass the root password is public
knowledge then Linux becomes a little useless in a sensitive
environment.

My 2 cents.

&gt; Hi all.... following my last message on Thursday (havent been home since
&gt; then!) I received quite a number of messages regarding my comments abt
&gt; the "correct/neat/clean" way to bypass the login prompt at the console &
&gt; then change the root password  The responses were somewhat "flamey" !
&gt; One thing I think is worth commenting on is that none of the "flames"
&gt; were addressed to the list, just to me.. I feel that is far more
&gt; appropriate & shows good sense!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Only oneperson agreed with my stance on not giving out the info, the
&gt; rest made reference to  my "elitist" "I'm not going to tell you cos I am
&gt; a guru" attitude and stated that I should share my knowledge with
&gt; everyone else! (for a variety of reasons). BTW, to whoever said to use
&gt; "SINGLE", that doesnt work, it merely gives you an "enter root password"
&gt; prompt!!
&gt; 
&gt; I am very curious how everybody feels abt this.... I assumed, wrongly it
&gt; appears, that the method I use was common-ish knowledge, but perhaps it
&gt; isn't!!  I am still somewhat loathe to publish this method, primarily
&gt; because IF what I know is not common knowledge, then once I make it
&gt; publicevery linux server which is not in a locked room will be subject
&gt; to "tampering" by people with a "certain" kind of mentality :) I
&gt; personally dont think it looks good if some kid after being caught
&gt; trashing his school's linux server says that he got the info of this
&gt; list... but that's just my opinion!
&gt; 
&gt; 3 people mentioned in their emails that you could stop ppl from
&gt; "hacking" the login via the keyboard by using the BIOS password!
&gt; EEEEK... I think that at last count there were abt 50 little 2Kb apps
&gt; that bypass/remove/give or change the BIOS password... I use them all
&gt; the time when WINDOZE users get enthused & add a BIOS passwd and then
&gt; forget it, or the kids add a passwd :).
&gt; 
&gt; IF a linux box is unattended,  even if there are no open consoles, THEN
&gt; anyone who knows the method I use, can get in & change ANY/ALL passwords
&gt; in the time it takes to reboot and then type 4 short commands!!  IMHO,
&gt; there is NO security on an unattended linux box which is open to "public
&gt; access"!  IF the linux box is mission-critical etc, then leaving it
&gt; "insecure/unattended" is very DUMB!
&gt; 
&gt; So, what does every one think.... should I publish this method, or
&gt; should I stick with my original stance & only give it out if someone
&gt; convinces me of their honesty/integrity :))???
&gt; 
&gt; Comments Please.
