&gt; SHEESH!!!   Let's tell every schoolkid who wants to take out his schools
&gt; linux server, how to bypass the LINUX Login & then Change the root (or
&gt; any other) Password!! :(    Admittedly, Barry is probably not a
&gt; schoolkid BUT the possibility exists!!
...
&gt; Anyway, there is a CLEAN/NEAT/CORRECT - but not documented (for pretty
&gt; obvious reasons!) method of bypassing the login prompt & changing
&gt; passwords.

I would prefer that knowledge on bypassing the login prompt were well
known, rather than undocumented.  Security through obscurity does not
work, it just slows the security race and means that administrators may
not know how they were compromised or how to protect their machines.

I assume the account recovery method you would use involves either;
booting to single user mode, or booting from a single floppy Linux
distribution (or rescue disk).

If you use another method, I'm sure we would all like to hear about it so
that we can defend our machines.

If these methods were well known, administrators might apply some basic
precautions to machines with accessible consoles, preventing these methods
from working.  These precautions are:

Set BIOS boot order to C,A and set a BIOS password.  This will prevent a
boot disk attack unless your BIOS has one of the "undocumented" bypass
passwords (which exist, and are well known in some cracker communities).
If the box is opened and the password reset, all is lost anyway.  If the
machine only runs Linux, DOS BIOS password crackers are not a problem.

[ Alternative:  Boot off the network card, that way the BIOS boot order is
                ignored, and the hard disks can be checked for integrity/
                recreated before the machine can be used. ]

Use the LILO "password" and "restricted" options to prevent kernel
parameters being passed on the command line (except by administrators with
the LILO password).  man 5 lilo.conf for more details.  To bypass this
password, you must bypass the BIOS boot order to boot from a rescue disk.

Turn off the Sys-Req magic key in the kernel.  This was left on by default
in some RH distributions.  It allows a limited set of debugging commands
to be performed from the console.  This does not allow a direct
compromise, unless you leave your session logged in with a screen locking
program protecting it.

-

If the hard disks can be removed from the machine and put into another
machine, or the BIOS boot order can be reset, crypto file systems are your
only protection. The downside is that the machine requires a password to
boot.  If your machine is that open, it will probably be stolen anyway, so
physical security is the problem.
