As you would remember I previously decided to ask how well Linux runs
with Apple computers. Unfortunately I have had a major system disaster
since then and lost all my archived emails. Most of the time, system
disasters don't touch my /home partition. This one managed to get the
whole lot.

In summary I found the following points:

1) Linux runs very well on Apple computers. A number of people commented
that for the price one could get a lot more power from an Apple than
from an IBM.

2) It's possible to dual-boot Mac OS and Linux. 

3) *MOST* linux programs ran on Apples

4) Graphics in X was slow because XFree86 doesn't fully support the
accelerator functions on the Apple video cards

5) Having a one buttoned mouse can be a disadvantage

A number of models were mentioned and they all seemed to work well.
There should be no problems with Apple's and Linux. In fact, a similarly
powered Apple computer might outrun a similarly powered IBM compatible
if they both ran linux, but not as far as X is concerned.
