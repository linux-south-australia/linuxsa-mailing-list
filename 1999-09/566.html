Hello.

The list has been a little quiet lately, so I thought I'd mention a few
thoughts I've been having over the last few days.

Windows, and Microsoft in general, are actually pretty cool.  I don't know
why all you people are always being derogatory toward them.  They've got
just the right attitude toward software development, developer tools,
standard setting, marketing policies and a whole gamut of other things too.

Software development, for example - I don't know why everyone here's been
going about how crap GUI system configuration tools are.  They enable -any-
idiot to configure -any- sort of server.  Without having to have any sort of
system knowledge whatsoever.  Now -that- is good business sense.  Microsoft
have made their certificate, the MCSE, so very easy to obtain that anyone
with half - or even a third - of a brain, can obtain one with minimum
effort.  I believe Microsoft's aim here is quantity, not quality, and -that-
is the key to their success.

Observe and learn, penguin people.  The Linux Operating System is taking a
similar turn.  There are god-knows-how-many programmers out there, all
developing their own little parts of the OS, not communicating with each
other to any great degree, and ignoring and rehashing and recreating
standards faster than anyone can keep up.  A bit like Microsoft's
programmers.  Good, eh?

BSD, on the other hand, has a ridiculous red-tape-ified system, where only a
few privileged humans can modify the source-code, and things have to be
checked, and approved, and rah rah rah.  What a load of complete bollocks.
And you can't run Linux software on BSD anyway, so don't bother with it.  I
don't think you can even make it connect to the internet.  It's a huge waste
of time.

Now.  Modems.  All this talk about external modems and how wonderful they
are is making me -sick-.  Who the hell wants to see little red lights
flashing at them the whole bloody time?  And they're much slower than
internal modems, because you plug them into the serial port, whereas
internal modems plug -directly- into the motherboard, giving the CPU, with
its huge bandwidth, direct access to the telephone line.  Why is there a
question?  I'm puzzled and amused by the naivety of some of you people.

One other point I'd like to make before signing off - security.  Windows NT
security is eons ahead of Linux's security, for lots and lots and lots of
reasons.

Here's one.

I want Administrator access, but I don't have the password.  What do I do?
God knows.  It's too hard.  There's no "crack the password" button and no
file called "c:\windows\Administrator Password.pwd" so argh!

Linux?  hah.  I just reset the server, enter single-user mode, and I have
complete control over my system with Administrator (or root or whatever you
twats want to call the Administrator user) privileges.  I can even change
the Administrator password by typing a few simple commands.

Bah.

I think I've made all the points I need to for tonight.
