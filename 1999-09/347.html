&gt; The days of the inadequacy of 256-bit keys for long-term protection
&gt; of data are fast approaching.  If NIST is pushing 256-bit keys, you
&gt; can bet your bottom dollar that that means the NSA is capable of
&gt; cracking 256-bit crypto in a reasonably short amount of time. :-)

	Bollocks. 128-bit encryption (block encryption, mind you, we're 
	not talking public/private key encryption here) will take longer to 
	crack than the sun will take to finish super-nova'ing, even given
	significant advances in hardwaremanufacturing.
	56-bit ciphers such as DES have been shown to be ineffectual since the 
	80s (the EFF's massively parallel DES-cracker was postulated a couple 
	of years ago, but was never actually built).

&gt; The strength of crypto that should be used is a function of the 
&gt; value of the data you're protecting and the length of time you need
&gt; to protect it for.  If you need to keep a contract worth $100,000
&gt; secret for a 14-day cooling-off period, don't use an algorithm that
&gt; can be cracked in 13 days by a machine that costs $99,999.  As the

	...And always factor in a dose of healthy paranoia. It has been 
	guestimated that the NSA is 10-15 years ahead of 'industry'  crypto
	research (they new about differential cryptanalysis when they 'helped' 
	design DES, and they claimed to have invented publickey crypto 10 years
	before Diffie and Hellman did. (This does not invalidate the paragraph 
	above: 256-bit (block) ciphers border on ridiculousness).

&gt; critical length of time increases, the cost of a machine which will
&gt; break the key within that time decreases, and vice-versa.  For
&gt; reference purposes, the DES cracker built by EFF, "Deep Crack," can
&gt; be built for under US$100,000, and can crack a 56 bit DES key in a few
&gt; hours.

	...And 128-bits will "only" therefore take 4700000000000000000000
	 hours (give or take) :)
