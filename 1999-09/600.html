&gt; Windows, and Microsoft in general, are actually pretty cool.  I don't know
&gt; why all you people are always being derogatory toward them. 

It depends on what you want to use your PC for, for most people it is teh most
compatible, easiest to use etc and so fits their needs perfectly.  For other
tasks and uses other tools fit best.

&gt; They've got just the right attitude toward software development, developer
&gt; tools, standard setting, marketing policies and a whole gamut of other
&gt; things too. 

They have just the right attitude for making money - like any company does.
And they've got it pretty right.  You must admit one of Sun's main reasons for
Java and the way it is set up (in terms of certification) etc is all geared to
them gaining market share to ensure their economic viability.
 
&gt; Software development, for example - I don't know why everyone here's been
&gt; going about how crap GUI system configuration tools are.  They enable -any-
&gt; idiot to configure -any- sort of server.  Without having to have any sort of
&gt; system knowledge whatsoever.  Now -that- is good business sense.

Obviously they're targetting their products at a broarder market, rather than
just those people who feel right at home with a command line.

&gt; I believe Microsoft's aim here is quantity, not quality, and -that-
&gt; is the key to their success. 

I suppose quantity is what makes them money

&gt; Observe and learn, penguin people.  The Linux Operating System is taking a
&gt; similar turn.  There are god-knows-how-many programmers out there, all
&gt; developing their own little parts of the OS, not communicating with each
&gt; other to any great degree, and ignoring and rehashing and recreating
&gt; standards faster than anyone can keep up.
 
I suppose what makes Linux so good can also cause problems in other ways.

To make Linux a product that will rival Windows in the general consumer market
it needs to be like Win9x is now - easy for just about any idiot to install
and then use once its up and running. People generally don't want to have to
concern themselves with a lot of the setting up that is required with many
linux distributions.  I think  that is why some of the distributions have gone
towards more of an automated set up system.

Maybe  you like to tinker with config files for your system, but others don't.
Basically you each have different needs and so different OS's are what you
need.  Basically it all comes down to 'Horses for courses'.
