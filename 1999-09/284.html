&lt;major snip&gt;

Phil,

I think that most information should be public, but I stress the word
"most". There is no use hiding a key and then telling everyone where it is.

Personally I would love to know just so that I know, in case I get hit with
the MS dumbstick and forget my root password (hasn't happened yet, but that
means nothing!)

This is not for 100% for Phil, more like 10% as he already mentioned
Physical Security.

One thing I would like to mention. Physical security is the first and best
defense. If they can't get to the computer they can't damage it. Any
SysAdmin worth their salt, would push management to pay the extra bucks for
the best physical security, please no flames, I know how next to impossible
this is, raising the dead IS easier...

So therefore anyone knowing the info would be defeated, especially if, as
you say, you need to be at the console (do you?), and basically have to be
able to get to it in the first place.

Maybe you could disseminate the info on a web site and those who want it can
get it. Those who need it can get it.

Plus, I don't think you should try to judge what someone is going to do with
this information based on what they tell you. I could lie my butt off to
you, how will you know?

Security can only be improved by everyone knowing the holes, and trying to
fix them, remember most holes where fixed by SysAdmins who found them and
worked out how to plug the leak.

Okay somebody may hack a system or 10, I am sure they did when the source
for the password encryption was release amongst other code.

I will not accuse you of being elitist, hell no, you gave no indication of
this, just concern, big difference.

Just don't be big brother, you dangle this big of carrot in front of us, and
pull it away just as we try to bite it.

Oops, when did I get on my soap box ? &lt;steps down rather quickly&gt;

Is this a ramble, maybe, maybe not, the point is it would be nice to
know......

Rob.
