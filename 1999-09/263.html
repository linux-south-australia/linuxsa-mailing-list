What are people smoking? The original poster, who is obviously a pre-newbie,
asks what he'd need to set up a linux-based network, in an obvious attempt
to decide whether to go ahead and try, and he gets 2 responses - one with
good info, followed by an insult, and the other basically an insult. Both
appear to be mis-interpreting the post as "can you do everything for me"
when in reality, it reads more like "can Linux do this, and if so, do I need
to get extra stuff to make it happen?".

All this post requireed was "you need a PC, a network, and you need to know
about IP masquerading and blah blah blah". In reality, john, if you were
really thinking of setting up a fission reactor at home, your post is
probably not such a bad start -- if you posted it to the FissionSA list, and
if what you were trying to do was reasonable.

Basically, I am embarrassed when I see new people getting flamed for asking
questions. Give some sort of reasonable answer, pointers to some doco (maybe
just to the LDP or something) and possibly some instruction on Netiquette
(which is particularly strict here, by the way). Of course, there is no need
to give a complete ten page set of instructions on how to set up a network,
but (despite the original poster's use of the word "exactly") I don't think
that was what was being requested. Take the "innocent until proven guilty"
approach when interpreting posts from new people.

Anyway, that's my hobby horse for the day.

&gt; &gt; I soon plan to set up a small network at home, to share printers and the
&gt; &gt; internet. I was just planning on using win95 and wingate but i've heard
&gt; &gt; linux can so just as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can any1 tell me exactly what i'd need to do just this? I need to be
able to
&gt; &gt; share the internet with the protocols necessary for ICQ and online games
&gt; &gt; such as quake.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;sarcasm&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I soon plan to set up a small nuclear fission reactor at home, to generate
&gt; electricty and small warheads. I was just planning on using U235 and
Cadmium
&gt; but i've heard plutonium can so just as well.
&gt;
&gt; Can any1 tell me exactly what i'd need to do just this? I need to be able
to
&gt; generate electricity with the fuels necessary for controlled fission and
&gt; nuclear armaments such as MX-5 ICBMs.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As a learning experience, setting up your own network at home is a good
way
&gt; to get your head into things like TCP/IP, samba etc etc. However, you
really
&gt; can't expect people to just give you a step by step run-down: you really
&gt; wouldn't pick much up that way, and we'd probably be inundated with mail
from
&gt; you everytime something broke.
&gt;
&gt; If you plan to do it yourself, then DIY. Otherwise, you might want to
start
&gt; offering some $$$$$$ as what you're asking for is someone to set up a LAN
&gt; for you. This is not necessarily an elementary task.
