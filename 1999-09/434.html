&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; I use leafnode and tin.  Your post does seem at odds with the way
&gt; that I receive news.  As far as I can tell, once leafnode starts
&gt; collecting a news group, it collects everything that is posted to
&gt; it.  I have no need to request articles, they will be up to
&gt; date as of the last time your machine was connected to the ISP.
&gt; When I read news, my tin newsreader connects to leafnode news server
&gt; on my machine and presents news to me.
G'day Branko, thanks for the reply. It seems that I didn't explain my
leafnode setup very well. I have it so that it collects headers one pass
and the articles the next (delaybody=1)

## If you want to use leafnode like an offline newsreader (e.g. Forte
## Agent) you can download headers and bodies separately if you set
## delaybody to 1. In this case, fetch will only download the headers
## and only when you select an article, it will download the body.
## This can save a huge amount of bandwith if only few articles are really
## read from groups with lots of postings.

The problem I have is that when I mark the article to be downloaded by
pressing enter over the header it prints up in the article window
as 'been marked for download' BUT also marks it as deleted. If I want to
view the article the next day after it has been downloaded, then I have to
mark the group as unread to display all articles - but I still have
no indication of what article I have marked to be received. If I
haphazardly wander around pressing the headers, then I'll end up
requesting other articles that I may not have originally wanted. I still
haven't come up with a neat solution ??
Cheers.
