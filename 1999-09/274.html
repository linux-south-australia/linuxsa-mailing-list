I am trying to connect via big pond cable. I
have read and followed every FAQ
and HOWTO pity many are either irrelevant, out
of date or aimed at RH users. The
machine works fine when I boot under windows 95
( as much as I would hate to
admit it ).

As a point of reference the IO and IRQs on the
network card remain the same when
I boot in Win95 and Linux. There there is
nothing to suggest  a problem with the
network card but how can I test it other than
checking dmesg?

Recently the computer has lock up completely
not even accepting movement from
the mouse. This has occurred at random
occasions but it may have something to do
with DHCP.

Where do I specify my IP address? I am
considering bypassing DHCP for the time
and using the ip address I have been assigned.
Under my windows 95 partition.

Or even where do I spesify an ipaddress for the DHCP server?

These are some logs that where produced in the
"messages" <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

&gt; &gt; &gt; A while back I was trying to get DHCP
running under Debian... I had no

to change to SuSE 6.2.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;       By "DHCP", do you mean a DHCP
_server_, or do you mean
&gt; &gt;       setting up your machine as a DHCP
_client_?
&gt;
&gt; Going by the IP his box has assigned, I'm
guessing a client.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is their something significant about the
IP address 192.168.1.254? Where
&gt; &gt; &gt; is this coming from?  My IP address
should be something like:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 24.192.10.XX
&gt;
&gt; My guess is that your Linux box has tried to
find a DHCP server somewhere
&gt; on your LAN, and not been successful, so its
set, what it thinks, is a
&gt; "safe" IP address that isn't likely to be
used.
&gt;
&gt; Are you running the DHCP server? Can you
check to make sure it is actually
&gt; running and has a proper network connection?
Are you sure _your_ network
&gt; connection is ok?
&gt;
&gt; Taking a wild guess, but are you able to see
any of the other machines on
&gt; the network?  (you shouldn't be able to
unless your default route is set).
&gt;
&gt; Can you check your network connection and get
back to us?
