&gt; Subject: 	Which box
&gt; 
&gt; I should start this with NEWBIE alert as I have been watching the list for
&gt; some time but I think preparedness of list membership to assist newbies is a
&gt; strength of the Linux community. Newbie questions reinforce our
&gt; understanding of the topic being discussed and invariably create discussion
&gt; about other matters as well as making those newbies feel like someone wants
&gt; to help them without holding the hand out for a fistful of bucks.
&gt; 
&gt; Having said all that my question is which box.
&gt; 
&gt; Would you recommend that I partition my PIII 500 with 128M of RAM and a 10G
&gt; hard drive with a Linux partition running alongside Windoze 98 or should I
&gt; toss it on my DX266 with 20M of Ram and a 1.2G hard drive as a pure Linux
&gt; machine.
