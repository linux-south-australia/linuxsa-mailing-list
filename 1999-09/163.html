The single most important component of the writer would be the buffer size.
Bigger the better. :^)

&gt; &gt; Firstly, from this list I beleive I read that
&gt; &gt; SCSI is faster and more reliable than IDE, and IDE burners should be
&gt; &gt; avoided. I recently asked a huy at a computer shop, and he said that the IDE
&gt; &gt; burner's technology has improved, and is now better than the SCSI burners.
&gt; &gt; Can someone tell me (or tell me where to read) about the difference between
&gt; &gt; SCSI and IDE, and which type of burner I should get? I know of the price
&gt; &gt; difference, but to me speed and reliability (of the drive and the media
&gt; &gt; produced) is more important than initial cost.
&gt; 
&gt; Most hardware people say SCSI is better. Period. Often you can't actually get
&gt; more than that out of them. &lt;grin&gt; It's more expensive, but it's generally
&gt; faster and places less load on the system (with a good SCSI card),
&gt; and you don't run into slowdowns with having more than one disk on each
&gt; channel like you do with IDE, as far as I understand it. IDE's only
&gt; advantantages are that it's cheap and doesn't need an extra controller
&gt; nowadays that it's on the motherboard.
&gt; 
&gt; As a hard drive related aside, I've seen claims that the newer UDMA based IDE
&gt; drives are getting close to equaling SCSI for raw speed, but having just
&gt; installed a new LVD drive and Adaptec controller on a server at work, I'm very
&gt; very very impressed at its speed. It feels a hell of a lot faster than the
&gt; older SCSI drives we have, although I haven't done any tests. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is that if your system is unloaded and reasonably fast, it
&gt; shouldn't make a difference which you pick. If, on the other hand, you do load
&gt; it down a bit while you want to do burns, I'd say it's safer to go SCSI; it'll
&gt; be more likely to survive.
