Hi.... I assume you are using LINUX at both ends??????????
Sorry, at this point I have more questions than answers

Who is running what O/S???

Are you dialing into an ISP and if so, what is he running (Operating
System??)???

Are you running SuSE_6.2 & KDE with kppp by any chance... if so, try mv
/etc/ppp/options to /etc/ppp/options.old & then "touch
/etc/ppp/options"  and then try again. The OPTIONS in SuSE_6.2
/etc/ppp/options file caused ppp connects to die all the time til I mv
the file & created a blank /etc/ppp/options

If you are running LINUX (kppp for example) can you dump a log of the
connect?

Do you actually get authenticated before PPP dies??? (ie/ when EXACTLY
does it die/what EXACTLY happens??????)

Have you considered 2 tin cans & a long piece of string???

Is either end running compression???

Do you own carrier pigeons????

Do you get an error like this "pppd died unexpectedly"????

Have you tried setting your modem speed in whatever config file, to the
speed of the modem instead of 115200 or whatever??

Without further detail its hard to guess, BUT from what you told us it
sounds like PPP might be the problem & not the modem!!??!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!
ie/ you are not getting authenticated... I have seen dialins stay up
after ppp failed on windoze boxes...

&gt; David (or anyone for that matter), what would you say to this problem:
&gt; 
&gt; A PPP connection keeps dying - not dropping out, but dying.
&gt; Persistently. New modem (both ends) (twice). They line "sounds" fine.
&gt; Telstra say its fine. Symptoms are:
&gt;         - CD stays UP
&gt;         - transmissions are one-way only (upshot: no comms possible)
&gt;         - it will stay like this forever unless the modem is power cycled.
&gt; 
&gt; Possible suggestions (rumors) were:
&gt;         - telstra sending (test?) pulses. Bad Telstra!
&gt;         - modems retraining to stupidly slow baud rates due to line noise
&gt;         - the modem gods are pissed at us
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions would be great. This is supposed to be a (semi)permanent
&gt; connection (!!)
&gt; 
&gt; regards
&gt; Jake
