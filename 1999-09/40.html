Hi,

I am in a hotel in Fiji at the moment, and accessing the Internet is very
difficult.

I have to bother the hotel staff and use their facilities (their line
works, but their machine is not configured correctly, so they can't access
the Internet, but I can).  The best connection I can get is 19,200 as well.

Anyway, I am trying to figure out what type of PABX they have here based on
the phone.

In the past, when I have plugged a PCMCIA modem into a Digital PABX line, I
have blown the modem up.  The one I now have seems to be more robust that
the previous ones I had, and it has survived being plugged into an Ericsson
digital  PABX, but the hotel has an NEC, and I don't want to take the chance.

So, does anyone know what type of phone the following is:

  NEC ETE-1-2(A)

It was manufactured in Taiwan in 1992, and only has two wires coming into
it.  They look like tip and ring.

Is it an analog or a digital phone?  Will I be able to dial out through the
PABX? The PABX is probably a NEAX of some sort.

Regards
