&gt; as far as all the programs are concerned, the link is still "up" but
&gt; according to the modems its not.

"According to the modem [the link is not up," yet "a ping from the other
end causes ... our RX light to flash."  Slow down and think about this.
This is NOT a case of line noise.  Line noise causes modems to hang up.
Less severe line noise causes modems to retrain frequently, and to slow
link speed.

I'm thinking along the same lines as Phil.  How do you know it's not
routing?  Have you actually dumped the routing table at both ends when
this problem occurs?  Have you actually displayed the interface config
at both ends when this problem occurs?

You never answered my question about routing daemons.  Are you running
one?
