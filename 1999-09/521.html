Hi again... re geeks & nerds.... here's a "net" definition....

"Geeks are their own society: a literate, hyperinformed underground. The
community accepts people from all walks of life, assuming they have
access
to the net and the skill to use it. You can't tell if someone is a geek
just by looking at them, there is no dress code. Some dress casual, some
prefer silk
- but few pay attention to current fashion. You are more likey to see a
geek in a renaissance bodice than a dress from glamour magazine; or a
tiedye
instead of suit and tie. 

The unwritten geek credo states that originality and strangeness are
good, and that blind conformity and stupidity are unforgivable. 

Take care not to confuse the terms geek and nerd. A nerd is a person
with no social skills, usually obsessed with science or technology (geek
is more
computer specific). Nerds are known for their pocket protectors, taped
glasses, and plaid shirts. Many nerds are also geeks, using the net as a
safe
screen to hide behind while practicing their social skills. However they
rarely come out to be seen in person at live geek events, so there is
little reason to be concerned. "
