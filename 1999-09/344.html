Hi!!!

Along this thread - sorta - and not wanting to continue along the silly
lines we've been taking..

There's a filesystem type you can add to your collection that actually
encrypts the entire filesystem on the drive.  ie - if you stole someone's
encrypted disk and put it in your own machine, you'd need that $99,999
machine to crack it open in a hurry.  They'd see garble.

When the disk is mounted, you are prompted for a password.  The password is
then used by the filesystem "driver" (or whatever its technical name may be)
to decrypt data *as it's read from the disk*, so the only decrypted data
you'll have is in RAM, or in swap.  And I'm sure there's a way to make sure
it doesn't ever go to swap.  Is there?  *shrug*  It's an interesting concept
and will probably be fun to play with :)

You can, for example, take a normal floppy disk, create a new encrypted
filesystem upon it, mount the drive using your encryption password, and read
from/write to it as normal.  When you unmount the disk, you need the
password again to re-read it.

Assuming nobody's snooping about in your disk cache.

Or watching as you type.  *looks over shoulder*

It's a rather groovy idea and when ..  when ..  whenIrememberwhatit'scalled
*ducks* I'll be playing with it some.

Not because I need anything encrypted, but because it'd be fun.  I'm a power
freak, you see.  That's why I like linux.  *wink*

Anyway - it's late, I'm full of food and wine, and I'm tired.

So if anyone remembers what the filesystem driver/module thing is called..
let me/us know :)

Thankyou all.

Nite.

&gt;  &gt; Note that the level of encryption needed to keep people out
&gt;  &gt; is increasing all the time, as decryption machines become
&gt;  &gt; cheaper and people discover new attacks.  NIST is working
&gt;  &gt; through a process of selecting a new crypto scheme at the
&gt;  &gt; moment, called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).  Many of
&gt;  &gt; these encryption schemes have 256-bit keys.
&gt;
&gt; The days of the inadequacy of 256-bit keys for long-term protection
&gt; of data are fast approaching.  If NIST is pushing 256-bit keys, you
&gt; can bet your bottom dollar that that means the NSA is capable of
&gt; cracking 256-bit crypto in a reasonably short amount of time. :-)
&gt;
&gt; The strength of crypto that should be used is a function of the
&gt; value of the data you're protecting and the length of time you need
&gt; to protect it for.  If you need to keep a contract worth $100,000
&gt; secret for a 14-day cooling-off period, don't use an algorithm that
&gt; can be cracked in 13 days by a machine that costs $99,999.  As the
&gt; critical length of time increases, the cost of a machine which will
&gt; break the key within that time decreases, and vice-versa.  For
&gt; reference purposes, the DES cracker built by EFF, "Deep Crack," can
&gt; be built for under US$100,000, and can crack a 56 bit DES key in a few
&gt; hours.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any rich bastards reading this list? :-)
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; The days of 56-bit DES are long gone, if you're serious about
&gt;  &gt; keeping data hidden.
&gt;
&gt; Absolutely -- passwords included.
