There have been many enjoinders for enquirers to RTFM (ie Read The (Fine)
Manual).

The Linux manual as provided (LMAP) has the following properties:
It has no Index.
It has several Tables of Contents, each placed in a different part of the
LMAP and not all written in the same language.
There is a strange electronic retrieval system, whereby the arrangement of
the LMAP is presented in a form dependent on the enquiry system used. 
Parts of the LMAP are written by people clearly ignorant of the structure
of the desktop PCs upon which LMAP users work.  (eg PS2 = bus mouse).
Thus, keywords, where available, are not always helpful, and can be
downright misleading.

Frankly, if I was presented with a reference book with such qualities I
would reject it out of hand.  Wouldn't anybody? 

Nevertheless, there are those within the Linux community who have little or
no need of the LMAP, who persist with the call to RTFM on receipt of any
enquiry.
I wish they would desist.

Maybe the Linux Documentation Project will bring much-needed order into the
chaos.  At which time RTFM might be a reasonable suggestion.  Until then,
it isn't.

I can't speak for every enquirer, but I would imagine that most do as I do,
namely diligently seek to find the answer themselves first, calling upon
this list only as a last resort.
