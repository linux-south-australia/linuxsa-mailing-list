Sigh.  This is getting silly.

Before going any further on this thread, can we perhaps reach some kind
of consensus that there is no security without physical security?

This is a given, a fact, not worthy of debate, 100% correct, a done
deal, settled.  Anyone who is prepared to disagree with this point
will only be exposing their own ignorance about security to the mirth
of the many denizens of this list who know what they're doing.

So while we're talking about means of increasing security, can we 
stop with the silly and unfounded claims that it's even remotely 
possible to stop someone from breaking-in to a computer that they're
sitting directly in front of?

I'm not singling you out, Tim.  Lots of people participating in this
thread have entertained the absurd idea that you can prevent someone
from breaking in to your systems with root access if they have
physical acces to them.  It's about time those people adjusted their
thinking, otherwise someone who is even less well informed than them
might actually believe them.

 &gt; Just a quick question, how do you if the only operating system on

An attacker doesn't need to care.

 &gt; and have A: drive not boot able hack the BIOS with a computer program?

Why do you need to hack the BIOS?  You have physical access to the
machine, so BIOS security is useless.  To whit:

1.  Open the machine;
2.  Rejumper the boot disk to a different SCSI ID (for SCSI) or into
    its "slave" configuration (for IDE);
3.  Plug-in your own pre-prepared bootable hard disk, running the 
    operating system of your choice, pre-loaded with all the tools you
    need to break in to any system at all;
4.  Boot;
5.  Mount the disk you're attacking;
6.  Edit /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and anything else you want to your
    heart's content.  Do whatever the hell you want, after all, you have
    physical access to the box;
7.  Shut-down;
8.  Remove your bootable hard disk;
9.  Rejumper the cracked boot disk to its previous configuration;
10. Reboot.

Total elapsed time:  less than 10 minutes.  You can speed up step
6 by having a pre-prepared tar archive on your boot disk containing
the files you want to replace on the victim system, which you can
simply extract over the top of the victim's root partition.

How to actually do it without being caught is an exercise for the
reader.  Section 44 of the Summary Offences Act in South Australia
doesn't even require a victim to demonstrate that you've caused damage
or loss by your unauthorized presence on a system in order to render
you criminally liable.  You *will* be caught.

The lesson to be learned from this: Important machines sit in locked
server rooms under 24-hour-per-day monitoring (e.g.: I get pager
messages within a minute or two if any of the machines at work stop
working).  Workstations and other machines which are publically
accessible should not be "trusted", meaning you shouldn't use .rhosts
files letting them in to your servers without passwords, you should be
careful with your NFS exports, you should avoid running executables
from those systems in privileged modes of execution, you should audit
your trust relationships, you should use router access lists and
tcp_wrappers to enforce your security policies, you should assume that
every computer out there is hostile to your protected resources and
configure your network appropriately.

Above all, next time someone comes up to you and tells you that you
can set a BIOS option or cut a wire to make your machine secure in
the face of a physical attack, laugh at them, and send a report of
their claims to a humor mailing list to share the fun. :-)

 &gt; I know that some flash upgrade BIOS let you upload a new BIOS (without
 &gt; a password) to them, but disregarding this is there any way to do this?

You don't need to.  BIOS security is utterly, completely, totally,
inevitably, indelibly, uncompromisingly useless in the face of someone
who knows what they're doing and has fifteen minutes alone with your
computer.  It's a red-herring which only serves to lull you into a
false sense of security.

If you forgot your BIOS password in your own computer, would you throw
it away?  Or would you break in to it?  If you can break in to it,
anyone else with physical access can break in to it too.

 &gt; BTW, you can stop people resetting the BIOS easily by removing the pins
 &gt; which must be closed to reset it.

Easily fixed with a pair of alligator clips and a piece of wire,
odds-and-ends that any self-respecting techie has in his toolbox.

Remember, setting BIOS options to prevent booting from removable media
is crap, because I'm sitting in front of your machine with a pair of
pliers and a screwdriver, and *ALL* media is bloody-well removable.

Another point well worth keeping in mind is that over two thirds of
successful computer breakins are inside jobs: Don't think for one
moment that keeping details about your cut wires hidden from outsiders
is going to save you from the majority.  Insiders tend to be
single-minded about it too, and know the precautions in place and the
weaknesses they can exploit, whereas outsiders will make token
"script-kiddy" style attempts and go away if they can't get in
trivially.  An insider can be expected to do the hard-disk-swap style
of attack, which might be a bit extravagant for a casual outsider.

In conclusion: By all means, let's keep talking about the things that
can be done to improve the status quo, but in order to be useful that
discussion simply *must* proceed from the understanding that nothing
you do will prevent a determined attacker with physical access from
getting in -- The only way to get real security is to put a well
controlled network between the resource you're trying to protect and
the unwashed masses, or to keep important systems under so much
supervision that furphies like BIOS passwords aren't necessary.
