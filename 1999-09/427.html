&gt; Having problems finding my internal modem.  Any suggestions?  Have used =
&gt; kppp, but does not find. :^)
&gt; 

Firstly I will assume you have made sure that it isn't a winmodem.  And that
if it a jumperless modem you have the software to go with it.  Finally lets
hope that it isn't a PNP only modem that looks for it's own resources (you
have to wait til 2.4 hopefully for that).

Then remove the modem. (I was going to say and then buy an external (they are
sooo much easier to work with) but I won't :) ). 

Next, find out your onboard or on card serial ports.  After boot, try
to run dmesg and look for messages about tty???.  

	dmesg | grep tty

Should give responses like

	ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
	ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A

or something similar for a 2.2 based system.  Write these down.

You should then re-insert the modem, and reboot.  If all goes well
you will have three lines, the third being the modem.  From there
link /dev/modem to /dev/ttySxx as appropriate and things should work.
You can check this with a program like minicom.

If things don't change, have a go at disabling serial ports on your 
system (hopefully they are onboard).  Reboot and you should have one line
which is your modem.  If there is a conflict, change the port settings for
the modem or conflicting port to somewhere else.

Done :).

Hope this helps.

Matt
