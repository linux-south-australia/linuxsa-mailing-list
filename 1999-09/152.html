Bugger....

X is just about the only thing I havnt tried compiling with PGCC.

Even though I have RH6 and rpms would be easier, I normally download the
source for utils/proggies and compile them with PGCC.
Not once have I had yet a problem with PGCC making bad apps.

The among the things I have compiled have been samba, kernel, beroftpd,
wine, vim, squid and havnt had the slightest problem with any of them.

&gt; MWP:
&gt;
&gt; ==============================================================
&gt; If you want to optimise your kernel, try compiling it with PGCC.
&gt; This will compile it for your particular processor (like in my case a PII)
&gt; by using that CPUs enhanced instruction sets and cache usage
optimisations.
&gt; Using PGCC will optimise your kernel more than changing GCC's optimisation
&gt; level and will be a LOT safer.
&gt; ==============================================================
&gt;
&gt; As it happens, mandrake 6.0 comes with PGCC as the only choice of
&gt; compiler (as far as I could determine). No gcc 2.7.2 and no plain egcs.
&gt; And it turns out that if you compile the XFree3.3.4 source
&gt; with PGCC, it doesn't work -- you get SEGV when you try to
&gt; run the X server. And this is also well documented in
&gt; the XFree86 documentation.
&gt;
&gt; It's all a bit confusing about which of these compilers is
&gt; suitable for what software.
&gt; SuSE 6.2 has egcs-2.91.66.
&gt; But I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
&gt;
&gt; But all things considered, it looks to me like using this
&gt; Pentium GCC version of EGCS should be high risk.
&gt; I'll just have to wait for the O'Reilly book on
&gt; the GCC family of compilers to disentangle it.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; PS.  My brief researches (and some 2-3 years of
&gt; speaking German in Germany) tell me that SuSE is most
&gt; probably pronounced zooza. All native German words
&gt; starting with su are pronounced zoo- in my dictionary.
&gt; But another possibility, due to the fact that both
&gt; Susi and Suse are diminutives of Susan, is that it should be
&gt; "sooza". My intuition tells me that Susi must start with soo-,
&gt; maybe because it is a non-German name.
&gt; It also happens that there is a tool "susephone", which is
&gt; a pun on "Susaphone" or something.
&gt; My conclusion is that "sooza" is the most likely
&gt; pronunciation, but "zooza" is also possible.
&gt; Please don't post replies to this message to
&gt; the whole list.
