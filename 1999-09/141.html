Just forestalling the rush of e-mails...

There is no backdoor.


&lt;Paraphrase of MS statement&gt;

There is a "backup key" which is a second public key that can be used
check the signatures on plug-in crypto modules.  This is used if the
main key is lost.

This was a requirement to achieve NSA certification.  The reason
being that the NSA didn't believe that a new public key could be
securely installed on all Windows desktops without a trojan
key being installed in the OS of at least some users.

&lt;/paraphrase&gt;


I agree with this assessment.  Having developed products that
achieved DSD certification (the AU equivalent NSA) I know that the
claim that it was an NSA requirement isn't unlikely.  Imagine if MS
started e-mailing people saying "install this" then the d00dz would
start sending similar-looking e-mails with a trojan key within an
hour.

Microsoft claim that the NSA requirement lead to the backup
key being called the "NSA key".  This variable name was noticed
by the a person who claimed it to be a backdoor.  This
seems reasonable -- I've seen stupider variable names.


Microsoft's explanation is at:

  <A HREF="http://microsoft.com/security/bulletins/backdoor.asp">http://microsoft.com/security/bulletins/backdoor.asp</A>

and seems much more reasonable than the silliness posted
on Slashdot (which is getting worse: ref the enforcement of
RedHat's trademark, reaction to Bill Joy's quite excellent
O'Reilly talk, etc).

Cheers,

PS: If you want to "open source" your signing key-pair, I'd
    be more than happy to accept a copy :-)
