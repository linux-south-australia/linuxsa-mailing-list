ok john thats not very nice and not gonna make me happy :(
i only joined this list about an hour ago and if i am gonna keep getting
people talking to me like you have and this other guy then stuff you all. I
joined this list in hoping to get some knowledge of linux. I AM A TRAINEE
and yes i am incharge of the network and tyes i did format the drive as a
last resort!!!! we found out someone was relaying spams through our proxy
server from the isp it runs on which happens to be the edu domain.
well formating a drive really isn't that hard to do u know anyone can do it
with basic knowledge. hmm looks like i have joined a list of people more
interested in showing how good they are and what they can do more then
helping out people who want to learn but have no one to teach :(. I have
been asked to try to get this to work and if not they will send it off what
is the use of been a trainee if i cant use stuff to learn. i know more about
NT and 95/98 as thats what i have always used so don't go getting all shirty
at me just cause i am learning something new

&gt; &gt; oh no its not stupid it is serious our linux proxy serevr was hacked and
&gt; &gt; someone changed all the passwords and started using it as a relay to =
&gt; &gt; spam
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ( i was unable to aceess the linux o/s so i have formated the drive and
&gt; &gt; installed linux redhat vr 5 i don't know anything about linux but my =
&gt; &gt; school
&gt;
&gt; You were 'unable' to access the OS?
&gt; Okay, I have a few questions:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Are you in charge of the computers at your school?
&gt; If so, please enlighten me as to which idiot hired you?
&gt; If not, what in God's name were you doing  formatting the
&gt; harddrive?
&gt;
&gt; 2) How did you know that they were spamming if you were 'unable to get
&gt; access to the linux o/s'?
&gt;
&gt; 3) Did you format your harddrive as a last resort?
&gt; If so, was it after reading any of the messages posted today?
&gt;
&gt; 4) How did you manage  to format the harddrive?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; is pressureing me to get it fixed and fast as they have no internet =
&gt; &gt; access
&gt; &gt; now i am at home and need to know what i have to do in x windows to set
&gt; &gt; stuff up i have most of the settings i need but i don't know anything =
&gt; &gt; about
&gt;
&gt; X-windows won't save yer ass now boy. You need a commandline,
&gt; and a clue.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; it i have till moday to have it working
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Fortunately, there is a wealth of knowledge on this list.
&gt; Prices are reasonable.
&gt; Personal advice is free of charge.
&gt;
&gt; J.
