Ooooops.... thought I posted this to ALL when I did it earlier...
CRAFTS!

Hi again.... :) Antony & Tim have both made valid points but
unfortunately linux boxes usually have floppy drives which immediately
renders the
use of a LILO Password irrelevant!  I suppose I should have mentioned
this in my previous post.

&gt; &gt; Step 1:
&gt; &gt; Reboot PC
&gt;
&gt; Firstly there is very little you can do to stop this, BUT disabling
the reset switch (when
&gt; was the last time you really used it on a production box?) and
requiring a logged in user
&gt; for Cntl-Alt-Del (see man shutdown) to work MAY be a start.

Unfortunately this is easily bypassed by physically turning the power
off (admittedly this is crude & will cause errors!!)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Step3:
&gt; &gt; type this
&gt; &gt; linux init=/bin/sh
&gt;
&gt; If you look at man lilo you will see a very simple way to defeat this.
Parameter passwords,
&gt;  you can require a password when ever a kernel parameter is entered.
This stops the init
&gt;  trick you described.

ONLY IF the PC has NO floppy drive otherwise it is still at risk!
Change Step2 to Step2(a)
Add Step2(b)
If you find that LILO is password protected then obtain any Linux Boot
floppy which uses LILO
Insert said floppy into drive and REBOOT (or TURN OFF) the PC again.
At the floppy boot prompt (usually BOOT but sometimes says something
else... hit shift/tab etc to see list lof boot options...select one -
LINUX
in this example) and type this

linux root=/dev/hda1 init=/bin/sh

&gt;
&gt; At this point you have secured the OS to the point that someone has to
remove the Hard drive
&gt;  to get access to your system and we get back to physical security.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this dispels a least part of the myth that console access (which
isn't always the same thing as physical access) is inherently insecure.

Again....ONLY IF the linux box  is a)LILO password protected AND b) has
the floppy drive removed (which IMHO is a wise move!)

&gt; -- No Sig today

Seriously, if you need to protect a LINUX box against someone using the
keyboard to "break-in" then do the following:

1.Add LILO passwd protection
2. Remove All floppy drives
3. Ensure all console sessions are closed
4. Lock the bloody door!
