SHEESH!!!   Let's tell every schoolkid who wants to take out his schools
linux server, how to bypass the LINUX Login & then Change the root (or
any other) Password!! :(    Admittedly, Barry is probably not a
schoolkid BUT the possibility exists!!

The only consolation is that the methods suggested so far are more
likely to trash everything if a "non-linux-user" attempts to use them..
Seriously guys, VI is abt as user-unfriendly as you can get - especially
if you have never used LINUX :))

Anyway, there is a CLEAN/NEAT/CORRECT - but not documented (for pretty
obvious reasons!) method of bypassing the login prompt & changing
passwords.

I cannot control anyone else on this list BUT I would suggest that it is
not in anyone's interests to PUBLISH this sort of info in this forum!!

Barry (<A HREF="mailto:help-f1@wherever">help-f1@wherever</A>), I will provide you with the information IF you
contact me  and IF you can convince me you are "legitimate". I would
want the name of your company, your supervisors name & phone number etc
etc etc and I WILL check it out thoroughly before giving you the info
needed!

You can email me (<A HREF="mailto:vk5ham@seol.net.au">vk5ham@seol.net.au</A>) with your phone number and we will
start from there! I would need to know a little bit abt the PC that
LINUX is running on (type of CPU, hard drive configuration etc etc) You
will not need a linux boot floppy unless the hard drive no longer boots
up.
