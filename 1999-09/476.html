Mark!

I'm in the mood for biting tongiht, so here goes.

&gt; &gt; I am no expert at linux but I am on virtually every mailing list in
&gt; &gt; Australia. I receive about 400 emails per day.
&gt; 
&gt; Soo??? It doent mean you read them all which you prolly dont.
&gt; And even if you do, it doesnt mean you know all.

I don't READ them all but most people label their mails with sensible
subjects. Besides, the majority of problems with modems ARE with
internal ones. Most people learn very soon from the linux community that
the linux community is extraordinarily rude at times and you don't dare
ask it anything unless you're really stuck. The number of people who
have simply had total !@#$-ups with internal (non Win) modems is
astounding. Tough luck.....I believe my original statement stands and
that you haven't proved a thing.

Like the sky is blue, the most modem problems distributed on the lists
I'm on happen to be about internal modems. Call me a liar if you
will....

&gt; &gt; 2) If an internal modem isn't working it's normally the internal modem
&gt; &gt; at fault.
&gt; 
&gt; Why???

&gt; An internal ISA modem even though they are cheaper SHOULD be easier to get
&gt; working... because there is one less link in the chain you have to worry
&gt; about (the motherboards com port). If there is no physical problem with the
&gt; internal modem (which 98% of the time there isnt) its obviously a software
&gt; problem or a problem with the the set up of resources (ports and irqs).

I'm not going to even ARGUE with you on this point. What you're saying
is true. I just wish that the people who keep on having problems with
internal modems  would shut up so that they could prove your THEORY
true.

&gt; &gt; The advice? DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING AN INTERNAL MODEM AND EXPECT TO BE
&gt; ABLE TO PUT IT IN A LINUX BOX AND MAKE IT WORK. The bandwidth that I've seen



&gt; An internal ISA modem (non winmodem) uses up no more CPU data and address
&gt; time than an external modem. All an internal modem does is sit on the bus
&gt; and listen for requests on a hardware port (exactly the same as the
&gt; motherboard com port does). If you knew about hardware ports and the ISA bus
&gt; you would know this.

I meant the bandwidth on mailing lists not on the local internal bus. 
 
 
&gt; Dont give poeple the wrong idea... internal ISA modems are as good as any
&gt; external modem.

I wouldn't advise people to buy internal modems and I will stick with
that advice. Most of the emails which complain about "the modem she no
worka" are about internal modems. End of story. I don'r care for theory
- I work in the real world. I'm glad you got your internal modems
working as many other people have. 

This is all I can say. Statistically internal modems appear to create
the biggest dramas and that's all I wanted to say.

DL.
