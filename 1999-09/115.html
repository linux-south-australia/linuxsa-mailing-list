certainly not - the ~20% voter turnout says voter apathy is alive and
flourishing back there. In the US, for the most part, people with a
perceived vested interest (usually financial) in the outcome will vote.

That's not to say that everyone doesn't have a vested interest in the
outcome...
 
&gt; I think it's more likely that voter apathy comes from the sense that
&gt; voters can't actually control the outcomes because nobody they're
&gt; voting for represents their interests.  Whether you're in Australia,
&gt; the US, the UK, or anywhere else, you're going to see cynicism and
&gt; apathy whenever the only candidates are "unrepresentative swill".

So it seems compulsory voting allows politicians the luxury of saying
"Hey, you had your vote and you got what you asked for".  

I haven't had the pleasure of voting here yet, so I've a question:  Is
there a 'none of the above' option when voting?

&gt;  &gt; The only reason the Americans haven't had this sort of thing happen is
&gt;  &gt; because the interested opposition lobbies have money.  Ask 100 Americans
&gt;  &gt; what they think about censorship, and they'll rant and rave about its
&gt;  &gt; evils.  Then when it comes time to vote, maybe 20 will bother to vote.  
&gt; 
&gt; Bing!
