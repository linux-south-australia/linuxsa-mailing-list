Hi all.... following my last message on Thursday (havent been home since
then!) I received quite a number of messages regarding my comments abt
the "correct/neat/clean" way to bypass the login prompt at the console &
then change the root password  The responses were somewhat "flamey" !
One thing I think is worth commenting on is that none of the "flames"
were addressed to the list, just to me.. I feel that is far more
appropriate & shows good sense!! :)

Only oneperson agreed with my stance on not giving out the info, the
rest made reference to  my "elitist" "I'm not going to tell you cos I am
a guru" attitude and stated that I should share my knowledge with
everyone else! (for a variety of reasons). BTW, to whoever said to use
"SINGLE", that doesnt work, it merely gives you an "enter root password"
prompt!!

I am very curious how everybody feels abt this.... I assumed, wrongly it
appears, that the method I use was common-ish knowledge, but perhaps it
isn't!!  I am still somewhat loathe to publish this method, primarily
because IF what I know is not common knowledge, then once I make it
publicevery linux server which is not in a locked room will be subject
to "tampering" by people with a "certain" kind of mentality :) I
personally dont think it looks good if some kid after being caught
trashing his school's linux server says that he got the info of this
list... but that's just my opinion!

3 people mentioned in their emails that you could stop ppl from
"hacking" the login via the keyboard by using the BIOS password!
EEEEK... I think that at last count there were abt 50 little 2Kb apps
that bypass/remove/give or change the BIOS password... I use them all
the time when WINDOZE users get enthused & add a BIOS passwd and then
forget it, or the kids add a passwd :).

IF a linux box is unattended,  even if there are no open consoles, THEN
anyone who knows the method I use, can get in & change ANY/ALL passwords
in the time it takes to reboot and then type 4 short commands!!  IMHO,
there is NO security on an unattended linux box which is open to "public
access"!  IF the linux box is mission-critical etc, then leaving it
"insecure/unattended" is very DUMB!

So, what does every one think.... should I publish this method, or
should I stick with my original stance & only give it out if someone
convinces me of their honesty/integrity :))???

Comments Please.
