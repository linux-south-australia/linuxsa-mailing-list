I have a Sony 24xR/4xW/2xRW IDE with 1MB buffer. I use it exclusively under
Win98, as I haven't had time (or the need) to set it up under Linux. It
works fine. I only have trouble if I try doing anything else while it's
burning. This is partly an OS issue, but partly an IDE issue. IDE uses the
CPU a lot. SCSI doesn't. When you are only using one device at a time, and
not doing much else while a burn is being done, then this is not much of an
issue. However, if you have multiple devices (CD reader, CD writer, 2 HDs
etc) and you are likely to be doing a few things at once, then this is where
SCSI excels. You can maintain the high transfer rates on multiple devices,
without putting much load on your CPU. IDE can get very high burst transfer
rates, but they can't sustain this, and suffer when mulitple devices are in
use.

Having said all that, the most important thing when it comes to CD-Rs is the
buffer size. A large buffer can compensate for an inconsistent transfer
rate. Make sure you get at least 1MB, and remember that the effective size
of the buffer is inversely proportional to the recording speed. ie a 1MB
buffer will last for ~7 seconds at 1x, ~3 seconds at 2x, and &lt;2seconds at
4x.

Subject: scsi vs ide (off-topic) and recompiling/redhat's problems


&gt; Firstly, the off-topic bit (skip this paragraph for the linux related
&gt; stuff): This is the only mailing list i'm subscribed to, and I don't haev
&gt; access to newsgroups, so this is the only place I know to ask, sorry.
&gt; Anyway, I may be getting a CD burner soon(ish), and have heard different
&gt; things about SCSI and IDE. Firstly, from this list I beleive I read that
&gt; SCSI is faster and more reliable than IDE, and IDE burners should be
&gt; avoided. I recently asked a huy at a computer shop, and he said that the
IDE
&gt; burner's technology has improved, and is now better than the SCSI burners.
&gt; Can someone tell me (or tell me where to read) about the difference
between
&gt; SCSI and IDE, and which type of burner I should get? I know of the price
&gt; difference, but to me speed and reliability (of the drive and the media
&gt; produced) is more important than initial cost.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I sometimes read that redhat distro's have stability problems, speed
&gt; issues, etc. I would assume this is because of the way the packages are
&gt; compiled (all options avalible, least hardware specific details, etc).
Does
&gt; this mean if I get the redhat source CD, extract all the packages I use,
&gt; edit the makefiles to reflect what I need and recompile everything, these
&gt; issues will go away? (I like rpms, since it makes packages easy to upgrade
&gt; and uninstall, so I'd like to continue to use rpms, if possible).
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Andy
