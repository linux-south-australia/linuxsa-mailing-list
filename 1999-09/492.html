&gt; &gt; This demonstrates the problem is nothing to do with PPP, nor with network
&gt; &gt; settings.  Off hand I can think of only two likely causes: Either they are
&gt; &gt; disconnecting you (e.g. because you've used up your time allocation, and
&gt; &gt; I'm sure you'd know if that was the case), or it's a modem link problem.
&gt; &gt; There are three likely points of failure for modem link problems:  Your
&gt; &gt; telephone line; their telephone line; and compatibility between your modem
&gt; &gt; and theirs.  I am convinced that the vast majority of times these problems
&gt; &gt; are caused by either your telephone line or theirs.  And, of course, if
&gt; &gt; it's their telephone line they hear about it from most of their customers,
&gt; &gt; which means they are almost guaranteed to find out about it (and
presumably
&gt; &gt; have it fixed) very, very quickly.

Howdy,

There have been some excellent replies to this problem, hopefully at
least one of them right. On the off chance that it still is not solved,
my limited experience with connections dying as you describe is with
incompatible modems. This sounds very unlikely in your case given the
details, but maybe it's worth a look. My problem was (still is) with
dialling in to work with my old 28.8 vfast modem to a much more modern
modem at work's end. Any connect speed set at greater than 9600 results
in the symptoms you describe, presumably because of the lack of support
for vfast format at work's end. My only solution is to upgrade to a
better modem at my end, which I am saving pennies towards doing.

Probably not the same problem in your case, but just in case, I thought
you might appreciate the experience.

Cheers,

Bruce
