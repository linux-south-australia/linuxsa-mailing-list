Just a thought - but if it had "no security set on the relay" then while
it could be used to relay emails, that is still a far cry from hacking
the machine.
How would you know the machine was being used for spamming, if you
couldn't access it at all, as dredd claims?
Pulling the network plug on the machine would have solved the problem of
spamming until you could call a professional to come and fix the
machine. I suppose some people wouldn't think of that though - not
everyone knows which plug IS the network (or modem) plug anyway. But
even failling that, why not just hit the power switch?

As a side note, someone might want to make a "Hacked-HOWTO" that
explains the first steps to do when you believe your machine has been
hacked into..

&gt; Gee, dread. If you know that much, how come you didn't think to do as Brad
&gt; suggests?:
&gt; &gt;Brad
&gt; &gt;p.s one another thought why not just pull the network plug til lthe problem
&gt; &gt;could be fixed, no network plug not spamming.
&gt; This procedure would have preserved all your configuration files (probably)
&gt; and made fixing the problem so very much easier and less costly in time or
&gt; resources.
&gt; 
&gt; As Alan said, some of the things you have said, don't add up - and they don't.
&gt; Which causes confusion to all, and irritation to some.
&gt; 
&gt; NOW ...  I have RedHat 5.2 which cost me $10, so pay me that much and the 3
&gt; CDs are yours - permanently.  I'm in the NW of Adelaide, so perhaps my
&gt; offer won't help you much, but at least it's an offer.
&gt; You do need to publish your location in this list, and ask for someone to
&gt; call in to reinstall Linux and the network setup, and fix the problem. (As
&gt; a trainee you might be posted elsewhere as part of your training quite
&gt; soon, so you might not need to be shown what to do to maintain the system.)
&gt; 
&gt; There is no shame involved in being ignorant, but clearly if your knowledge
&gt; is minimal it will be next to impossible for you to be given adequate help
&gt; on your complex problem, via email.
