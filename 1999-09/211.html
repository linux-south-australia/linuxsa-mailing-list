Dread - would suggest that you do what I have been doing for the last couple of
weeks - read. If you are using Redhat - go to their site <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</A>
and at least view if not download the appropriate getting started guide and
manuals. Also some great "HowTo's" there. Also if you are a complete novice
like me - the "Linux for Dummies" book is a good start.

As already mentioned - there is no substitute for learning how to fix it for
(god forbid!) next time something goes wrong.

If you require your box fixed urgently - then I would suggest you contact a
support company - see the LinuxSA pages for contacts.
