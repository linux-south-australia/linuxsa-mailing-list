Can anyone out there help a simple wintel platform user? I'm NOT a =
member of your group but found your details while searching for help on =
the web.

Lost Login/Password

Problem is that a server running Red Hat Linux was installed onto a =
network with 5 PC workstations in an office where no-one knows the first =
thing about Linux/Unix. The installer has disappeared, there is no-one =
available who knows enough to support it, the server went down in a =
power failure and none of the office staff have any idea of the password =
or login name. (They just used the PC's and let the server run without =
even really being aware of it - it doesn't even have a monitor).

First - is there a default password and login for Red Hat Linux? Else - =
is there anything we can use to crack it, or, as a last resort, is it =
possible to reinstall the O/S, allocating passwords and logins that =
people are then made aware of, without destroying the data etc.=20

Can I use  a floppy boot disk to get in and alter anything?

I'd be grateful of ANY assistance at all. Thanks in advance

Barry Connell
