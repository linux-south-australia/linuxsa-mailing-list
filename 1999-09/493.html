Well in my earlier email, I must have had a faulty MBR, or I was on drugs.

I re-installed NT from scratch, including re-formatting the 1GB partition
that it was going onto on the 8.4GB HD, and it worked fine.

I then experimented and found that the MBR did not care what attributes
were set on NTLDR, it loaded correctly.

I then did a disk-to-disk copy from an NT disk to the FAT partition I am
going to load NT onto and all worked OK using a boot floppy and XCOPY.

I then did a disk-to-disk under Linux (cp -avf) to the FAT partiton and NT
still booted.

I then did a tar cf - &lt;source partiton&gt; | (cd target; tar xf -) and NT
still booted.

I then set up LILO to dual boot, after making a backup copy of my MBR, and
NT still booted.

I then copied the original MBR back to the disk (dd if=mbr of=/dev/hda
bs=446 count=1) and NT still booted.

So, I tkink I can now create a bootable CD plus boot floppy that will allow
me to install a particular dual-boot environment straight from a rescue CD
and set up LILO so it will dual boot them.

Remember, if you want to try to do this, you must have licences for NT for
the target machines.  Linux is, or course, more pocket friendly.
