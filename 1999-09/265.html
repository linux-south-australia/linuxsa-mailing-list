Greetings All (go PC),

that Alan Kennington chap wrote:

"Corba seems to be pretty important in industry, although what
I've seen of it seems like it makes life much more complex than
need be. Not that I've actually done anything with it."

It seems that distributed computing has many complexities. Language
transparency mixed with architecture portability could not be easy to
achieve. I was wondering how (outside of using a high-level abstraction like
Jini) could you achieve the distributed mechanism with less effort than
CORBA? Assuming that you are only interested in distributing objects
statically, it seems that all you really have to do is learn CORBA's IDL to
produce the the necessary client stubs and server skeletons. The compiler
should provide the network hooks needed for internet communication (IIOP =
Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (standard with OMG's CORBA)). The programmer (is
it programer in America?) should theoretically just insert a normal method
call and not even know that it is not local. This makes me wonder about the
availability and range of IDL to &lt;system programming language&gt; compilers. I
know that Sun has a java-to-idl compiler that can be freely downloaded. I
was hoping that Linux would have some type of c/c++-to-idl compliler (i
should be so lucky :)).

I am also interested in finding out if there are object wrapper programs
available on Linux. Most net sites say that in order to make a c program
distributable all you need to do is wrap lines of code into an object. This
sounds very non-trivial to my simplistic self.

How do I contact Koffiice? Can any lousy bum participate?

Old Ben
