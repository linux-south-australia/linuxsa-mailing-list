Walter!

Please feel free to subscribe to the Linux C Mailing Lists as detailed
in my signature. I am the coordinator of the lists.

&gt; particularly now that the X interface is so well developed. But
&gt; I'm mainly interested in writing my own C programs (I am an
&gt; Analyst/Programmer by trade).
 
&gt; I have a question about booting up the box: During startup, at the tail
&gt; end, I see a message about a service (Woops! NT talk!) that's [FAILED] to
&gt; start. It's name is APM. I haven't the faintest clue what this means to me,
&gt; my machine or the universe.

Advanced Power Management. It interfaces with the BIOS to work out what
to turn off and how to save power. I don't use it....ETSA haven't been
sold yet so we should have a guaranteed power supply for at least a few
months.

&gt; While you're at it, can anyone point me in the right direction for some
&gt; *relevant* reading/tutorial material on C programming for Linux? I've seen
&gt; a lot of stuff on the net, but it's mostly incomplete, inaccurate or not
&gt; relevant to Linux. (Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places ...)

See above. It's more of a question / answer forum. There's SO many
different aspects of C programming that it's best to simply work out
what you *want* to do then find the tutorials. Asking "how does one
program linux in C" is an extraordinarily broad question.
