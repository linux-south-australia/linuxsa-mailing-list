&gt; I soon plan to set up a small network at home, to share printers and the
&gt; internet. I was just planning on using win95 and wingate but i've heard
&gt; linux can so just as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Can any1 tell me exactly what i'd need to do just this? I need to be able to
&gt; share the internet with the protocols necessary for ICQ and online games
&gt; such as quake.
&gt;

I soon plan to set up a small nuclear fission reactor at home, to generate 
electricty and small warheads. I was just planning on using U235 and Cadmium 
but i've heard plutonium can so just as well.

Can any1 tell me exactly what i'd need to do just this? I need to be able to
generate electricity with the fuels necessary for controlled fission and 
nuclear armaments such as MX-5 ICBMs.

&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

As a learning experience, setting up your own network at home is a good way
to get your head into things like TCP/IP, samba etc etc. However, you really
can't expect people to just give you a step by step run-down: you really
wouldn't pick much up that way, and we'd probably be inundated with mail from
you everytime something broke.

If you plan to do it yourself, then DIY. Otherwise, you might want to start
offering some $$$$$$ as what you're asking for is someone to set up a LAN
for you. This is not necessarily an elementary task.
