Hi guys...

Thanks for all the input, but unfortunatly it all went to waste :(

Yeh, I did end up fixing the MBR. First i did do a fdisk /mbr which seemed
to work but i also found later that when win2k starts you can press F8 for a
"safe mode" type menu, one of the options is "command mode". In there
suprisingly there was a command called "fixmbr" :P

But when the MBR was fixed and win2k was booting i got the dreded blue
screen of death whihc said "invalid boot device" :(
After a couple of shots at trying to fix that, i found my NTFS parition had
dissapeared. I tried everything i could think of to revive it (using Disk
Edit, disk repair utils, etc), but nothing worked :(
I lost all my docs, my brothers yr12 docs, and my dads auto cad files. My
fault i guess for not keeping a backup and trusting win2k to keep data safe
:P

Soo... here i am writing this email in a new install of win2k rc1.

Anyway... i found some cool new stuff in win2k i think you hard-core linux
server admins should worry about.
I now have my win2k running on a software RAID0 type setup (striped) using a
2Gb and 4Gb IDE HDD's. HDD access is now very very fast (well double what it
was anyway).
Ive used setup and used NT4 as a server for a largish network, and win2k is
soooo much quicker and easier to set up. ALL win2k server settings and
related is all found under one easy to manage tree type view.

Fine... win2k still doesnt have the power of unix... but it is getting
close.

&gt; &gt; OOOPS!!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That'll teach me for reading too quickly.  Sorry guys... didn't
&gt; &gt; see the NT4 bit.
&gt; &gt; Maybe you could add another drive, install Linux on it and if you
&gt; &gt; still want to
&gt; &gt; remove it THEN try /sbin/lilo -u.  hehehehehe
&gt;
&gt; I don't think that will work anyway - lilo -u just replaces the current
&gt; lilo-ridden boot sector with the -backup- boot sector that it took upon
&gt; original install.  And that won't have the NT5 boot-loader in it ;)
&gt;
&gt; The only way you're going to be able to fix this is to get NT5 to rewrite
&gt; the bootloader..
&gt;
&gt; My suggestion?  Run fdisk /mbr on the NT5 disk..   force the PC to boot
from
&gt; that hard disk with the BIOS..  then ask NT5 to rewrite the bootloader.
&gt;
&gt; *laughing*  if there's a way to get NT5 to do that :D
&gt;
&gt; Unless, of course, the bootloader is needed to boot..   then it all
depends
&gt; on where the bootloader is stored, I guess, and that's where my knowledge
&gt; runs out of steam.  Like when you erase lilo's ext2 partition and the
&gt; remaining lilo code - the bit in the boot sector - just says "LI".  Is the
&gt; entire NT5 bootloader in the boot sector??  If it's not - fdisk /mbr
should
&gt; be ok.
&gt;
&gt; But I don't like NT[1-5] so I don't care ;p
&gt;
&gt; Good luck..  *grin*

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi guys...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a bit of a problem with LILO.
&gt; &gt; &gt; A ehile ago i moved the hdd containing linux out of the machine
&gt; &gt; (and removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; linux from it).
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunatly i forgot to unsinstall LILO on the computer, and
&gt; &gt; now when i boot
&gt; &gt; &gt; i just get "LI".
&gt; &gt; &gt; At the moment the comp is only running win2k which is how its
&gt; &gt; going to stay.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; How do i remove LILO from the MBR?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know i can do a "fdisk /mbr" in msdos but im not too sure if
&gt; &gt; that will work
&gt; &gt; &gt; too well with win2k which uses the NT4 boot loader.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone got any ideas???
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Mark Williams
