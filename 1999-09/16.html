I gotta admit, there are benefits to both, i like to have linux on a
seperate machine because i can play around with networking etc, my linux box
is also my dial in machine, runs the cdburner and will soon be running
samba, so i can share pronters with the mac here.....if linux is on a
seperate machine you can play to your heart content in the knowledge if you
really mess things up, you still have a working machine that you can get on
the net with and fix it!!

Be radial, do both, network cards are cheap and easy to set up :)

Cheers,

Michael.

Subject: Which box


&gt; I should start this with NEWBIE alert as I have been watching the list for
&gt; some time but I think preparedness of list membership to assist newbies is
a
&gt; strength of the Linux community. Newbie questions reinforce our
&gt; understanding of the topic being discussed and invariably create
discussion
&gt; about other matters as well as making those newbies feel like someone
wants
&gt; to help them without holding the hand out for a fistful of bucks.
&gt;
&gt; Having said all that my question is which box.
&gt;
&gt; Would you recommend that I partition my PIII 500 with 128M of RAM and a
10G
&gt; hard drive with a Linux partition running alongside Windoze 98 or should I
&gt; toss it on my DX266 with 20M of Ram and a 1.2G hard drive as a pure Linux
&gt; machine.
