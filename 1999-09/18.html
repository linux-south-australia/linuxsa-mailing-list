I can't believe how much comment my aside has caused. 

Yes, the tsu-se is probably as close as you will get with english phonetics.

Suse happens to be a german equivalent to Susan, so its pronunciation is
fairly straightforward, especially as German is very phonetic.

I believe I did mention "english" pronunciation as the sweet similarity will
only come out with english phonetics.

Sweet in German-&gt;Ascii is suess (or s (u umlaut) (szet) although who knows
with the current spelling reform going on in Germany it may be s (u umlaut)
ss  - I believe triple m's , t's etc are back as in Schwimmmeister [ps the
latest MS office 2000 German language pack can come in useful here as they
are pretty recent with the German Language Standard ( am waiting for Sun to
send me my Staroffice ) and YES you heard right, the German language is
defined by standard. It is called the DUDEN and it represents what is called
Hochdeutsch or high german)

Subject: SuSE pronunciation



&gt;SuSe (could Suse be a play on words in German - as the english
&gt;pronunciation = sweet in German??)

If you're interested, I would pronounce SuSE
"tsu-se" (with the u like oo in South Australian "pool")
Sweet in German is suess (in standard ASCII characters)
which is pronounced
"soos" (with oo like ue in "blue").


Yours
