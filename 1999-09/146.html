Grrr.... HTML....

Linux has no problems using multiple networking interfaces such as modems,
NIC's, etc.
The problem lies in your routing tables.
The way normal PPP dial-up connections work is this:
During normal operation (not dialed up), your NIC is set at the Default
Route so any connctions to IP addresses "outside" of your linux box are
routed out through the NIC.
When you dial-up and a PPP interface is created, the routing table gets
changed so that the PPP connection becomes the Default Route.
When the PPP connection is ended, the Deafult Route is set back to the NIC.

I found after a couple of my installs of RH5.2/6 that when a PPP connection
is set up, the default route doesnt get set to the IP addr of the PPP
connection. On my current install, linux does change the default route. It
seems to be a random deal with each complete install of RH (as werid as it
sounds).

With a simple setup (like mine), I have found that a default route is
normaly not needed to use the lan. So if the problem occours of linux not
replacing the default route with the PPP IP, i simply delete the default
route every time i boot. I have found that this then allows linux to set up
the default route to the PPP interface when it is activated.

If you find this is the problem, then try removing the default route before
dial-up or on every boot (by inserting the command in rc.local).
To remove the default route it is simply:
route del default

Thanks for everyone's help...

Yes, disabling the network card has fixed the problem and now the browser
can "talk" to the modem...

And I can get my email...
How do I set up this box so I can do both? i.e. have the ethernet card
enabled
so that I can  use eth0 to talk to another machine, and vice versa, AND
connect
to the internet via a modem, from iether machine?
I tried editing my /etc/host file by adding the primary and secondary DNS 's
from my ISP but no luck
( as you all laugh!!!)
The Howto's and the man pages just dont seem to tell me what I want to
know...
I'm assuming that I have to add DNS's to a file to set this up...
 help!
Cheers...
