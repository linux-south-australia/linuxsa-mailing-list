Hi, 

I really like these little "disclaimers" that appear on the end of
emails originating from government depts & corporations etc... so I have
adapted the BankSA one for my own use:)

 *****   IMPORTANT INFORMATION    *****
This document should be read only by those persons to whom
it is addressed. If you have received this message it was 
obviously addressed to you and therefore you can read it, 
even it we didnt mean to send it to you. However, if the 
contents of this email make no sense whatsoever then you 
probably were not the intended recipient, or, you are a 
mindless cretin; either way, you should immediately delete
yourself & destroy your computer! Once you have taken this 
action please contact us.. no you idiot, you cant use your 
computer, you just destroyed it, and by the way, you are 
also deleted, but we digress......

The Originator of this email is not liable for the transmission 
of the information contained in this communication, unless they 
are the originator in which case they probably are liable and 
rightly so considering the content of the aforementioned 
communication.

In the event that the originator did not send this email to you, 
then please return it to us and attach a scanned-in picture of 
your  mothers brothers wife wearing nothing but cami-knickers, 
and we will  immediately refund you exactly half of what you paid 
for the can of Pal Meaty-Bites you bought when you went to Woolies
yesterday.

The comments & opinions expressed herein are my own and NOT those
of my employer, who, if he knew I was sending emails and surfing porno
sites,would cut my gonads off & feed them to me for afternoon tea.

-----------------WALOS!!--------------------------------------------

Now, that has to make someone somewhere smile! ;)

Cya, Phil

PS: It took me 15 minutes to do this masterpiece, so dont &^!@$%$ flame
me :))!!
