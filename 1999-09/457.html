ok, more info.


ppp stays alive.

routing is still active.

linux RH6 is the end that *answers*

not kppp, just pure pppd - whic *doesn't* die.

a ping from the other end causes their TX light to flash - and our RX
light to flash, but a ping from our end produces nothing. 

at this point, obviously, we have made a connection, been auth'ed
properlly and have even down some comms (for roughly 5 minutes) before
its stops working.

turning off compression helps. It dies after 6-7 minutes.

strike on both the cans/string and pegions

i still think Telstra hates me :)

&gt; Oh, another easy one.  If the line stays up it's obviously isn't a
&gt; line/modem problem, so it must be a ppp problem.  BTW I believe you can
&gt; shut down a ppp daemon and restart it successfully.  I've never done that,
&gt; in fact I was horrified to hear it was possible.  If the PPP keeps shutting
&gt; down, does restarting it help?  Also, is it really pppd that shuts down, or
&gt; is it something crazy like routes disappearing? If you are running a
&gt; routing daemon (e.g. routed or gated), *DON'T*.  If you've only got one
&gt; external link your routing table only needs a single static, default route.
