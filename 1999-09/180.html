&gt;&gt; Hi everybody
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I want my /usr and /home to be separate partitions mounted instead of
&gt;&gt; directories. Is there any standart or problem doing that? ie I copy all
&gt;&gt; stuff from /usr onto another partition and then mount it on /usr. Are
&gt;&gt; there any files in /usr that are needed before fstab is processed?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I could just go on and try it but I only have one computer and I needed it
&gt;&gt; for my studies so right now I can't afford time to fiddle with it too
&gt;&gt; much if I screw up.
&gt;
&gt;Yep there is no reason why you can't do this. There should be no programs
&gt;on usr that are needed before fstab. Just make sure you copy across the
&gt;permissions and the ownership.

It is worth pointing out that this can also be done during an installation
of at least RH, TurboLinux and Linux Mandrake.  I will find out about SuSE
and Caldera soon.

During the stage where you partition your disk, you can select what gets
mounted where.  Simply decide what structure you want, and go for it.

However, it is worth thinking about what you are trying to do. Having had
many years of experience with partitioning on other versions of UNIX, and
recently having been bitten[1], I can think of a few situations where you
might want to separate some parts of the file system out to separate
partitions, but in general do not think it is worth it.

[1] Recently was working on a system which had separate /, /usr, /tmp,
/var, /home, on an 8GB disk. The disk was also storing backups from other
systems. There was plenty of space on the disk, but it was scattered over
all those damn partitions, and our backups failed.  The machine now has two
8.4GB disks, with only swap, /boot and / on the first, and the second is
all one partition.

As a bonus point, why did I use /boot?
