Donn your helmet and flak jacket, and take cover, Nick. I suspect your wish
to have more traffic on this channel is about to be granted, based on the
old wounds you just reopened...

&gt; 
&gt; Hello.
&gt; 
&gt; The list has been a little quiet lately, so I thought I'd mention a few
&gt; thoughts I've been having over the last few days.
&gt; 
&gt; Windows, and Microsoft in general, are actually pretty cool.  I don't know
&gt; why all you people are always being derogatory toward them.  They've got
&gt; just the right attitude toward software development, developer tools,
&gt; standard setting, marketing policies and a whole gamut of other things
&gt; too.
&gt; 
&gt; Software development, for example - I don't know why everyone here's been
&gt; going about how crap GUI system configuration tools are.  They enable
&gt; -any-
&gt; idiot to configure -any- sort of server.  Without having to have any sort
&gt; of
&gt; system knowledge whatsoever.  Now -that- is good business sense.
&gt; Microsoft
&gt; have made their certificate, the MCSE, so very easy to obtain that anyone
&gt; with half - or even a third - of a brain, can obtain one with minimum
&gt; effort.  I believe Microsoft's aim here is quantity, not quality, and
&gt; -that-
&gt; is the key to their success.
&gt; 
&gt; Observe and learn, penguin people.  The Linux Operating System is taking a
&gt; similar turn.  There are god-knows-how-many programmers out there, all
&gt; developing their own little parts of the OS, not communicating with each
&gt; other to any great degree, and ignoring and rehashing and recreating
&gt; standards faster than anyone can keep up.  A bit like Microsoft's
&gt; programmers.  Good, eh?
&gt; 
&gt; BSD, on the other hand, has a ridiculous red-tape-ified system, where only
&gt; a
&gt; few privileged humans can modify the source-code, and things have to be
&gt; checked, and approved, and rah rah rah.  What a load of complete bollocks.
&gt; And you can't run Linux software on BSD anyway, so don't bother with it.
&gt; I
&gt; don't think you can even make it connect to the internet.  It's a huge
&gt; waste
&gt; of time.
&gt; 
&gt; Now.  Modems.  All this talk about external modems and how wonderful they
&gt; are is making me -sick-.  Who the hell wants to see little red lights
&gt; flashing at them the whole bloody time?  And they're much slower than
&gt; internal modems, because you plug them into the serial port, whereas
&gt; internal modems plug -directly- into the motherboard, giving the CPU, with
&gt; its huge bandwidth, direct access to the telephone line.  Why is there a
&gt; question?  I'm puzzled and amused by the naivety of some of you people.
&gt; 
&gt; One other point I'd like to make before signing off - security.  Windows
&gt; NT
&gt; security is eons ahead of Linux's security, for lots and lots and lots of
&gt; reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's one.
&gt; 
&gt; I want Administrator access, but I don't have the password.  What do I do?
&gt; God knows.  It's too hard.  There's no "crack the password" button and no
&gt; file called "c:\windows\Administrator Password.pwd" so argh!
&gt; 
&gt; Linux?  hah.  I just reset the server, enter single-user mode, and I have
&gt; complete control over my system with Administrator (or root or whatever
&gt; you
&gt; twats want to call the Administrator user) privileges.  I can even change
&gt; the Administrator password by typing a few simple commands.
&gt; 
&gt; Bah.
&gt; 
&gt; I think I've made all the points I need to for tonight.
