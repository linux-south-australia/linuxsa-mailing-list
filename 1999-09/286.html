&gt; Hi all.... following my last message on Thursday (havent been home since
&gt; then!) I received quite a number of messages regarding my comments abt
&gt; the "correct/neat/clean" way to bypass the login prompt at the console &
&gt; then change the root password

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Only oneperson agreed with my stance on not giving out the info, the
&gt; rest made reference to  my "elitist" "I'm not going to tell you cos I am
&gt; a guru" attitude and stated that I should share my knowledge with
&gt; everyone else! (for a variety of reasons).

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; IF a linux box is unattended,  even if there are no open consoles, THEN
&gt; anyone who knows the method I use, can get in & change ANY/ALL passwords
&gt; in the time it takes to reboot and then type 4 short commands!!  IMHO,
&gt; there is NO security on an unattended linux box which is open to "public
&gt; access"!  IF the linux box is mission-critical etc, then leaving it
&gt; "insecure/unattended" is very DUMB!
&gt;
&gt; So, what does every one think.... should I publish this method, or
&gt; should I stick with my original stance & only give it out if someone
&gt; convinces me of their honesty/integrity :))???
&gt;

I reckon that you should give the method out, as anyone who is really
interested in security would already be taking measures to prevent access to
the actual server. I can't remember who said it, but I remember hearing
something along the lines of "If someone can gain physical access to the
computer, then they will be able to get all the access they want."This is
fairly true (even with Linux it would seem!)
Giving the method out will probably serve to better illustrate how important
things like physical security are, as I think that many people just don't
realise how important it is to the overall security of a computer.
Thanks,
Sam Silvester.
