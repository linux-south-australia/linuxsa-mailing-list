Subject: Re: NEED HELP


&gt; Come on Guys - Dread is asking for help here. Being nasty aint helping
anyone.
&gt; Just a note to suggest that Dread need the services of a professional
would have
&gt; been sufficient.
&gt;
&gt; I am a novice myself (having trouble installing a copy of Redhat 6.0) and
have had
&gt; some great encouragement from people on the list. If this is the kind of
response
&gt; that is received by people in need of some help - then I think you will
find that
&gt; this will end up being an elitist type of mailing list and not anywhere
near the
&gt; philosophy being expounded by the free to all makers of Linux.

Maybe you recieved a encouraging reponse because you tried, and just needed
a hang fixing or installin, etc

Dread's is HELP please save my ass, (he hasnt asked which bit or what things
hes tried to setup or install (except myabe the base O/S or what he needs
setup in his email).

My suggestion is for him to find somone help and teach him, not just tell
him how do things, if you dont  learn you wont be able to maintain the
machine after it is setup, which is equally as important as the setup (to
keep it secure, running well, patched and upto date) there are normally lots
of people around who will help you for  supply of food and beverages.

My question to dread is , so what is the problem, what programs, services,
configuration problems that you need help with ?

still learning

Brad
p.s one another thought why not just pull the network plug til lthe problem
could be fixed, no network plug not spamming.
