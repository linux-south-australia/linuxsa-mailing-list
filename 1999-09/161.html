Hi!

&gt; Firstly, from this list I beleive I read that
&gt; SCSI is faster and more reliable than IDE, and IDE burners should be

&gt; burner's technology has improved, and is now better than the SCSI burners.
&gt; Can someone tell me (or tell me where to read) about the difference between
&gt; SCSI and IDE, and which type of burner I should get? I know of the price
&gt; difference, but to me speed and reliability (of the drive and the media
&gt; produced) is more important than initial cost.

Most hardware people say SCSI is better. Period. Often you can't actually get
more than that out of them. &lt;grin&gt; It's more expensive, but it's generally
faster and places less load on the system (with a good SCSI card),
and you don't run into slowdowns with having more than one disk on each
channel like you do with IDE, as far as I understand it. IDE's only
advantantages are that it's cheap and doesn't need an extra controller
nowadays that it's on the motherboard.

As a hard drive related aside, I've seen claims that the newer UDMA based IDE
drives are getting close to equaling SCSI for raw speed, but having just
installed a new LVD drive and Adaptec controller on a server at work, I'm very
very very impressed at its speed. It feels a hell of a lot faster than the
older SCSI drives we have, although I haven't done any tests. 

Bottom line is that if your system is unloaded and reasonably fast, it
shouldn't make a difference which you pick. If, on the other hand, you do load
it down a bit while you want to do burns, I'd say it's safer to go SCSI; it'll
be more likely to survive.
