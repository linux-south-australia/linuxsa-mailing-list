<PRE>
Unfortunately I am still having problems getting dhcp client working
under SuSE 6.2 and connecting via Telstra Big Pond Cable (I am starting
to get desperate).

DHCP (client) acts af if everything is fine when my computer starts up.
Unfortunately I am not being assigned an IP address.

This is the output of ifconfig:
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:AA:00:5B:9E:88
          inet addr:192.168.1.254  Bcast:192.168.1.255
Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:6 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:26 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100
          Interrupt:9 Base address:0x200

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:3924  Metric:1
          RX packets:14 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:14 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0

Dhcp seems to be assigning me a default IP address. I should expect
something like: 24.192.10.46 (which is the IP I am assigned when I boot
under windows)

I believe that I have not configured something properly. I have read all
the FAQs HOW-TOs etc. but I have found nothing that helps.

I have included some config files and any log files that may be of
assistance. I would be extremely appreciative of any one that can help
me fix this problem.

The thing that gets me is that everything worked fine under SuSE 6.1
(even under the default install) and everything works fine under win95
(I hate it when that happens).

If anyone has the config files to suse 6.1 I would appreciate a look.
Maybe there is some other fundamental difference between 6.1 and 6.2.
Has any one had any troubles with DHCP (client) and 6.2?

Thank you to every one who has already given me some suggestions.

## Formating the boot script messages:
##   The boot scripts should use the variables rc_done and rc_fail to
##   symbolize their success.  See /sbin/init.d/skeleton for an example
##   how to use these variables.
##   rc_done_up and rc_failed_up do the same as rc_done and rc_failed
##   but one line above (usefull for starting daemons who talk to user).
##   The variable rc_reset is used by the master resource control script
##   /sbin/init.d/rc to turn off all attributes and switch on the standard
##   character set.
