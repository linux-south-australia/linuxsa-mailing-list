Thanks for the smack in the head. I needed someone to get me back on track.
I am picking up on a few concepts as I go along. The "X" exists on the linux
box and works OK. I changed /etc/inittab to not load prefdm, but rather to
load xdm instead. After a reboot, The xlogon widget comes up (although much
uglier than the gnome). After logging in, I get an Xterm on the desktop.

Although I am confident I'll find the solution to the following mysteries, I
won't turn away any futher advice. Thanks again. Here are my new horrors:

- Instead of Xterm, I would like the complete desktop as shown on the server
in default configuration (for Redhat6, that's GNOME, I think). So I have to
change that. Possibly by adding "-session session_program" to the end of xdm
in /etc/inittab. I may have to script it if it can't be done in one command.

- Paths are a problem in the new display. Even though Xterm is in
/usr/X11R6/bin, I still have to launch by typing /usr/X11R6/bin/xclock, for
example. This may be adjustable by a script, or Xsession, or something. I'll
keep experimenting.

&gt; Subject: 	Re: Confiuring XDMCP Broadcast
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; Hi group: I have installed XWin32 for Windows 95, and am
&gt;     Adam&gt; trying to connect to a Redhat 6 box. I would like to be able
&gt;     Adam&gt; to:
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; 1. Have the box show up on the XDMCP Selector list
&gt;     Adam&gt; 2. Run a full desktop session on XWin32 (RSH, single window)
&gt; 
&gt; These seem to be different things.  If you are using XDMCP, you do not
&gt; need to use rsh to login.
&gt; 
&gt; You will need to start xdm (or on redhat 6, /etc/X11/prefdm).
&gt; 
&gt; You can then use the XDMCP option with X-Win32 to connect to the Linux
&gt; box.
&gt; 
&gt; There are normally three ways that you can connect to an xdm server
&gt; using an X server:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Specify the IP address of the xdm server you wish to connect to (aka
&gt; "query" mode).  If all is well, a login window will be displayed on the
&gt; X server, and you will be logged into the xdm server.  You need to
&gt; specify the IP of the xdm server to log in to.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Use broadcast mode, where the X server sends out broadcast requests
&gt; to connect to an xdm server.  The first xdm server that responds is the
&gt; one you get a login window for. You do not need to specify IP addresses.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Use "indirect" mode, where the X server requests that xdm server to
&gt; run a "chooser" which displays a list of hosts that you can log in to
&gt; with xdm.  You then choose one, and are logged in.  You will need to
&gt; specify the IP address of the xdm server which will display the chooser.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are using RH6 and gnome, then you are probably using gdm.  I have 
&gt; not been able to get gdm to display a chooser for indirect mode, but I
&gt; have been able to get xdm to work fine.  If you wish to try with xdm,
&gt; you can "cd /etc/X11" and then "ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm prefdm".
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that XWin32 supports all of these options under the session
&gt; setup (?).
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; Here are my observations so far (thanks to the archive for
&gt;     Adam&gt; reference):
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; 1. I can get applications up by manually initiating a remote
&gt;     Adam&gt; login: - Double-Click XWin32 - telnet to the Redhat box (in
&gt;     Adam&gt; my case 1.2.3.1) - log in as root - issue "export
&gt;     Adam&gt; DISPLAY=1.2.3.2:0.0" where 1.2.3.2 is the 95 box - issue
&gt;     Adam&gt; "xcalc" (or xterm, netscape, or other x app)
&gt; 
&gt; Good - pretty much all the components are working.
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; 2. I modified the /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers file as follows:
&gt;     Adam&gt; changed: :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X to: :0 local
&gt;     Adam&gt; /usr/X11R6/bin/X -broadcast and restarted the box hoping
&gt;     Adam&gt; that would cause the broadcast.
&gt; 
&gt; This is probably not what you want.  Xdm will start local server(s) and
&gt; show login windows on them if you wish.  If you do not need a local
&gt; server, then comment this line out. In any case, you do not need the
&gt; -broadcast.  -broadcast asks the local X server to connect to an xdm
&gt; server, which happens automagically for servers started by xdm anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; If you do not want to have X started automatically on the linux box, you 
&gt; can comment this line out altogether.
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; The Redhat box is configured with defaults, and works with
&gt;     Adam&gt; manual login, so I suspect that I have to alter the server
&gt;     Adam&gt; parms to allow XDMCP broadcasts.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but probably on the X server, not the xdm server.  Have a look in
&gt; the XWin32 setup options for XDMCP stuff. This is what you want.  Also
&gt; read above about gdm vs xdm.
&gt; 
&gt; A word of caution: the /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess file specifies who will be
&gt; able to get a login window and/or a chooser from your xdm server.  As
&gt; shipped, RH6 allows *anyone* to get a login and/or chooser.  Some people
&gt; may consider this a security flaw.
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; I am having trouble finding documentation to RTFM. Perhaps
&gt;     Adam&gt; if someone could point me in the right direction. This would
&gt;     Adam&gt; make an excellent HOWTO.
&gt; 
&gt; /usr/doc/HOWTO/mini/Remote-X-Apps is a good place to start.
&gt; 
&gt;     Adam&gt; Any hints would be appreciated by this newbie.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Martin
