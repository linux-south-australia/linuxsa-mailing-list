Hi

Do you remember how the first Microsoft Windows was, quite a few years =
ago?
It was pathetic, any Desqview or Concurrent  DOS was  more usable.

We are in 1999 now and I can not help myself not to become a Microsoft
hater. Reason? Stability. It is a joke. Maybe for kids to play their =
games,
providing that they do not have too many installed, otherwise they will =
have
to deal with a 'blue death screen'.

As far as their application software is concerned it is debatable. Some
things are OK, but there is always provision to make more money. =
Example,
Microsoft Word can not read Microsoft Works document unless you buy an
optional converter (I am not sure if this is still the case). Microsoft =
Java
is good but not portable- something to do with money?....

Their support usually ends up with: reinstall windows. It is also very
expensive.

We have had motherboard with USB for at least two years now and guess =
what:
Microsoft NT still does not support it!

Bottom line: I do not like it!

Regards
Frank

&gt; Hello.

&gt;
&gt; Windows, and Microsoft in general, are actually pretty cool.  I don't =
know
&gt; why all you people are always being derogatory toward them.  They've =
got
&gt; just the right attitude toward software development, developer tools,
&gt; standard setting, marketing policies and a whole gamut of other things
too.
