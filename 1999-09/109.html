I just find it appalling that they are asking me to purchase software (even
at  greatly reduced price) that will never have all the options on (hey I
live by myself, no kids, no wife, no no-one, just me TV?) and will slow down
access to the internet, reduce legit site I can connect to and never really
offer me protection that I want.

I disagree with, Pay us to access the internet, and then pay us to reduce
that access ? Look at that for some interesting and wierd precedents.
"We have decided that all sites featuring South Park will no longer be
active, please pay us $5 to stop if for you, or basically we will stop
everything coming to you...".

Guarantee that I will be using the filters, as I say, I have no-one where I
live that the law is supposed to protect, ie Children. As for me, I am
probably as morally corrupt as I am going to get.

Just one thing, can anyone see a pattern emerging here?

Ban X-Rated videos from video stores, except in Canberra, only reason I can
think off is for the govt.
Ban X-Rated content from the internet except Govt's have constitutional
rights (this is mentioned by someone else just recently, don't blame me if
this is incorrect), at least they can "bypass" the filtering.

Pollies 2, Civies 0 (well actually more like Pollies 20000000000,
Civies -1).

Rob.

&gt; Australian Censorship-client side filters

&gt; mikecheng writes "The Internet Industry Association in Australia has
decided
&gt; how it will implement the new censorship laws in this country - mandatory
&gt; cliet-side filtering. Read here how you must use net-filtering software
&gt; (NetNanny and the like) and you must supply to your ISP a "a guarantee
[you]
&gt; are using client-side filtering". Of course you have to be using one of
the
&gt; "approved" filtering programs, or else the ISP charges you $5 and filters
for
&gt; you. (Now all I need is an approved open source filter!) "
