&gt; Phil,

&gt; I completely missed the thread on lost password.  I gather you said there
&gt; was a way of removing the password (assuming physical access to the
&gt; machine) which you wouldn't tell owing to a philosophy of not publishing
&gt; anti-security related hints.  My position on this is that it's a trivial
&gt; problem and there's no point telling people who can't work it out for
&gt; themselves for fear of giving them a ``loaded gun'' which they thus
&gt; demonstrate themselves incapable of safely using.

I would have to disagree strongly to this. After all, those who have worked
it out probably worked it out from information that was available to anyone,
and as such it would be not to difficult for anyone to find out how to do it,
but would be a huge waste of time. Why bother re-inventing the wheel?

&gt; There's nothing wrong with with-holding data on the basis that:
&gt; a. it's trivial for anyone else to find out for themself (and you
&gt;    mustn't encourage laziness); or
&gt; b. it's dangerous and when you're capable of using the data safely
&gt;    it becomes category a data (see above).
&gt;

Who gets to decide whether it is dangerous or not? For example, I am a
student and at my school I do most of the tech support / system
administration. Many people would wrongly assume that as a student I
shouldn't be knowing about things like changing the root password. I would
then have to spend an hour or two working it out for myself, an hour or two
that I could instead spend working out another problem that hasn't been
solved before (or that someone else won't tell me...)Cheers,
Sam Silvester.
