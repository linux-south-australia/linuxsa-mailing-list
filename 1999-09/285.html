The point that you seem to have missed is that login security is
pointless if people have completely free access to the machine. If
someone can do whatever they like (eg:
open case to wipe BIOS so as to bypass boot password so as to boot off a
floppy disk so as to mount the root partition and edit the /etc/passwd
file)
then there's nothing you can do to stop them, short of encrypting your
entire filesystem and decrypting it to RAM every time you boot up after
requiring a manually typed in 1024 byte password.
Security is made on the assumption that while the machine is maybe not
locked into a safe, it is at least vaguely watched to stop people
tampering with it physically. 

No matter how good your software security, it's still not going to stop
someone picking the machine up and walking off with it down the street!
Security through obscurity is not a valid method of securing something,
because while the users might not know about stuff, I'll bet the hackers
find out first. I'd rather know what I have to look out for, rather than
blindly living in ignorance.

&gt; Hi all.... following my last message on Thursday (havent been home since
&gt; then!) I received quite a number of messages regarding my comments abt
&gt; the "correct/neat/clean" way to bypass the login prompt at the console &
&gt; then change the root password  The responses were somewhat "flamey" !
&gt; One thing I think is worth commenting on is that none of the "flames"
&gt; were addressed to the list, just to me.. I feel that is far more
&gt; appropriate & shows good sense!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Only oneperson agreed with my stance on not giving out the info, the
&gt; rest made reference to  my "elitist" "I'm not going to tell you cos I am
&gt; a guru" attitude and stated that I should share my knowledge with
&gt; everyone else! (for a variety of reasons). BTW, to whoever said to use
&gt; "SINGLE", that doesnt work, it merely gives you an "enter root password"
&gt; prompt!!
&gt; 
&gt; I am very curious how everybody feels abt this.... I assumed, wrongly it
&gt; appears, that the method I use was common-ish knowledge, but perhaps it
&gt; isn't!!  I am still somewhat loathe to publish this method, primarily
&gt; because IF what I know is not common knowledge, then once I make it
&gt; publicevery linux server which is not in a locked room will be subject
&gt; to "tampering" by people with a "certain" kind of mentality :) I
&gt; personally dont think it looks good if some kid after being caught
&gt; trashing his school's linux server says that he got the info of this
&gt; list... but that's just my opinion!
&gt; 
&gt; 3 people mentioned in their emails that you could stop ppl from
&gt; "hacking" the login via the keyboard by using the BIOS password!
&gt; EEEEK... I think that at last count there were abt 50 little 2Kb apps
&gt; that bypass/remove/give or change the BIOS password... I use them all
&gt; the time when WINDOZE users get enthused & add a BIOS passwd and then
&gt; forget it, or the kids add a passwd :).
&gt; 
&gt; IF a linux box is unattended,  even if there are no open consoles, THEN
&gt; anyone who knows the method I use, can get in & change ANY/ALL passwords
&gt; in the time it takes to reboot and then type 4 short commands!!  IMHO,
&gt; there is NO security on an unattended linux box which is open to "public
&gt; access"!  IF the linux box is mission-critical etc, then leaving it
&gt; "insecure/unattended" is very DUMB!
&gt; 
&gt; So, what does every one think.... should I publish this method, or
&gt; should I stick with my original stance & only give it out if someone
&gt; convinces me of their honesty/integrity :))???
&gt; 
&gt; Comments Please.
