Darryl,

Burning a copy of SuSE might not be a popular option with
whoever has to do that.
You're basically looking at copying between 4 and 6 CDs,
compare with a cost of $57 to get the whole set
with manuals locally (netcraft), or $63 from a couple
of interstate mail-order places.
The full set is 6 CDs, but I think disk #6 is source only,
and disk #5 is just one application.
If your time is worth as much as mine, then the time
spent copying 4-6 CDs is worth much more than $57.

By the way, now that I'm writing an item anyway, since I've
installed SuSE, the experience has been nothing but pure pleasure.
The KDE window set-up is sooooo sophisticated and pleasurable.
My only complaint is that the old standard "rdate" is
not on SuSE, as far as I can see.
And even netscape seems to just run and run without
crashing on this new 2.2.10 kernel. But it's the same
4.61 netscape that needed to be killed and unlocked a few times
a day when I was using rh5.2.

The nice things on the SuSE 6.2 are just so numerous,
I won't even try to mention them. Maybe they're all on other
distributions in some form or other. But they do all
work fine as set-up from scratch on SuSE.

Anyway, I'll get out of your way now.
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
