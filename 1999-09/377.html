&gt; Hi all... have found a few "funnies" in SuSE_6.2 & wondered whether
&gt; anyone else had seen them as well (& if so, whether they found a
&gt; fix/indentified the problem)
&gt; 
&gt; 1. kppp is glitchy - would not work at all initially, so I renamed
&gt; /etc/ppp/options & just did a 'touch options' to get a blank file & I
&gt; was then able to get a working ppp connection abt every 3rd time.  Even
&gt; allowing for removing all the conf stuff out of /etc/ppp/options kppp
&gt; was still unreliable so I settled on wvdial & just added some stuff to
&gt; use my permanent ip etc etc, in the wvdial.conf

Mine worked straight out of the box. I just had to set the accuonts up and
it worked.

&gt; 2. I added firewall & masquerading in YAST & rebooted.... couldnt get
&gt; "out" on any other box on my LAN, tried manually (at the console)
&gt; entering ipfwadm params
&gt; eg/ ipfwadm -F -p deny    and    ipfwadm -m -F -a accept -S192.168.1.3
&gt; -D0.0.0.0 (and various other variations when that didnt work!) and kept
&gt; getting this error
&gt; ipfwadm: setsockopt failed: No such file or directory. I cannot find
&gt; what it is that doesnt exist :)!

Don't use ipfwadm with 2.2 kernels, use ipchains. I tried the Yast option
for ip masquerading, and I couldn't get it to work, so i disabled it
again and added the following to my /etc/rc.d/boot.local <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

ipchains -A forward -j MASQ -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d any/0

and that sets it up at boot time.

&gt; 3. In desperation I ran up KFirewall ....  that worked , although I see
&gt; lots of "ipchains died" errors  ... but it does work, with 1 downside...
&gt; I have to boot kfirewall and set it all up again IF I shutdown that box,
&gt; (which wont happen often as its a permanent dialup BUTi it;s still
&gt; annoying!) I have rtfm'd but cannot find a .conf file for kfirewall and
&gt; cannot figure out why ipfwadm wont accept parameters that USED to work!!

Because ipfwadm isn't really supported in v2.2 kernels. Try what I said
above.
