Hi,

I wasnt angry or anything, its just that i wasn't trying to be funny and I
just wondered why you found it humerous because you didnt have any detail in
your email as you say.  I was just curious!  Thats all!!

I wasnt infering anything at all and I apologise if you thought that.

:)

Cheers,

Michael.

&gt; Because I thought it was. That is why ? Jeez louise!
&gt;
&gt; I was not joking about using Linux to connect to the internet, I was
saying
&gt; Windows is a joke, just get rid of it, this, I thought, was worth a
chuckle.
&gt;
&gt; You seem to infer that I am against networks, I am NOT! I have one too,
&gt; though I doubt anyone cares about that! You also infer that I don't think
&gt; it's a good way to learn, bollocks, it's excellent, practice beats theory
&gt; any day (okay theory makes practice easier to start with sometimes).
&gt;
&gt; So you are allowed to laugh at your own Microsoft joke, why aren't I? Is
it
&gt; because I didn't explain it in detail like you did ?
&gt;
&gt; Rob.
