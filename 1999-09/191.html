&gt; oh no its not stupid it is serious our linux proxy serevr was hacked and
&gt; someone changed all the passwords and started using it as a relay to =
&gt; spam
	
&gt; ( i was unable to aceess the linux o/s so i have formated the drive and
&gt; installed linux redhat vr 5 i don't know anything about linux but my =
&gt; school

	You were 'unable' to access the OS?
	Okay, I have a few questions:

	1) Are you in charge of the computers at your school?
	If so, please enlighten me as to which idiot hired you?
	If not, what in God's name were you doing  formatting the
	harddrive?

	2) How did you know that they were spamming if you were 'unable to get
	access to the linux o/s'?

	3) Did you format your harddrive as a last resort?
	If so, was it after reading any of the messages posted today?

	4) How did you manage  to format the harddrive?

&gt; is pressureing me to get it fixed and fast as they have no internet =
&gt; access
&gt; now i am at home and need to know what i have to do in x windows to set
&gt; stuff up i have most of the settings i need but i don't know anything =
&gt; about

	X-windows won't save yer ass now boy. You need a commandline, 
	and a clue. 

&gt; it i have till moday to have it working
&gt; 

	Fortunately, there is a wealth of knowledge on this list.
	Prices are reasonable.
	Personal advice is free of charge.

J.
