I've just installed RH6 after having run RH5.2 for the last few months and
I've found it very nice to use. My only problem is that I cant seem to log
onto the internet properly, I managed to get ppp up and running and can get
it to dial my ISP and it seems to connect properly, but I cant ping my ISP
or sent or receive any information, it's very frustrating to have to sent
this from windohs, any hints out there?

thanks in advance,
David Creed
