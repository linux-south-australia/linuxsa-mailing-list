Sorry that this isn't Linux-specific, but I'm sure this is a good place to
be asking:

I'm often having problems with collecting my e-mail (Win95/OE5). The
majority of the time it's fine, but it seems to be happening more often that
I'm having trouble. The problem is that I frequently get timeouts while
collecting e-mail (POP3 at SENet in Adelaide and at my ISP here in Brisbane
whose mail server would appear to be in Sydney). These occur both during the
LIST phase and the Retrieve(?) phase. My timeout is currently set to 60s,
and when I'm experiencing difficulty the timeouts happen pretty frequently
(i.e. once I get a timeout, or perhaps more usually a second timeout,
chances are they'll just keep happening, only on a rare occasion will the
process "resume" without further interruption).

1) Is 60s too short? If I were to set a timeout of, say, 300s, would it be
more likely to succeed without my intervention (of clicking the [continue
to] "Wait" button). My experience of attempting 10 times in a row without
success suggests "no" to me. Further to this, what exactly is happening
here? That is, why exactly does it sometimes work (to keep waiting), and
sometimes not? Does not POP3 use reliable packet delivery mechanism (TCP?),
and if so, why does it fail (and if not, why is it able to resume
successfully, sometimes?). And is there any built-in recovery mechanism that
will ensure that the delivery will occur, given sufficient time?

2) Where is the failure happening here? Is it just network congestion
resulting in lost packets? Are there any tools I can use to try to isolate
where this is happening? I have often used traceroute to see if anything
might be revealed. Only on a few occasions have I seen evidence of problems
which I presume have explained my mail collection problem. This seems to
have been on Telstra's Melb/Adel link (not getting past Melbourne). I once
saw packets getting routed via Hobart in an effort to make their way to lil'
ol' Adelaide! But traceroute obviously just doesn't cut it for this - as I
write, I'm hung on receiving message #6, all traceroute can show me is that
I've got no worse than about a 200ms ping over the 16 hops to
pluto.senet.com.au. Worse (IMO) is that I'm having the same problem with my
own ISP, for which traceroute tells me I'm looking at about 200ms over only
5 hops! Of these only the first 3 are the same node. Is my ignorance leading
me to a mistaken conclusion to think that the problem probably lies
somewhere amongst those 3 nodes (not including my own machine, that is).

2a) Am I merely naive to shun my ISP's suggestion that I should simply
remove all my modem setups (in Win95) and reinstall my modem to resolve this
(and any other that I happen to be experiencing at the time) problem? What
are the chances that I actually -am- having modem/driver problems
(considering that most of the time, things go pretty smoothly, and that
given enough time, the problems described above do clear themselves up
without requiring any intervention - i.e. not hanging up and dialling back
in, etc.). How would I identify that such problems did in fact exist?

3) Should I just abandon this ISP (or is this as good as the Internet gets
in Australia for us lowly dial-uppers)? Or, if indeed, I believe they are
providing a poor quality of service, should I bother trying to get them to
understand that (let alone -do- anything about it!).

Your comments and suggestions are extremely welcome.
