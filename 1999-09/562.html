&gt;Why is it that University's devalue asking one's fellow questions so

This subject is surely off-topic, so let's not continue it ad infinitum.
However, you are mistaken in every respect.

Educators at EVERY level try to instil in their learners ways of finding
out for themselves.  This list is incorrect in saying RTFM only because the
Fine Manual is NOT Fine. Otherwise the attitude is entirely reasonable.
What NO educator wants is lazy or dependent learners who would sooner ask
someone else than use their own methods of enquiry.  Would you REALLY have
respect for a colleague who continually sought answers from other members
of the team, when those answers were easily available without the need to
interrupt or leach upon others?

So far as the current example is concerned.
1.  On what grounds is Tim interrupting this LINUX list with his enquiry?
Is his questioning in here, good or bad manners?
2.  The range of answers shows just how unreliable 'asking someone else'
can be.

PLEASE can we get back to talking about LINUX?
Thanks,
Brian
