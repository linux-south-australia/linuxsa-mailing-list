This demonstrates the problem is nothing to do with PPP, nor with network
settings.  Off hand I can think of only two likely causes: Either they are
disconnecting you (e.g. because you've used up your time allocation, and
I'm sure you'd know if that was the case), or it's a modem link problem.
There are three likely points of failure for modem link problems:  Your
telephone line; their telephone line; and compatibility between your modem
and theirs.  I am convinced that the vast majority of times these problems
are caused by either your telephone line or theirs.  And, of course, if
it's their telephone line they hear about it from most of their customers,
which means they are almost guaranteed to find out about it (and presumably
have it fixed) very, very quickly.

You can do a fairly simple check of your telephone line by using Telstra's
excellent FOLDS (Fax Online Diagnostic Service) test.  You send them a one
page fax and, assuming your fax software is setup correctly (pay careful
attention to your fax station number (fax telephone number)) they will send
your fax back to you along with a one page diagnostic.  It's easy enough to
understand the diagnostic.  Call Telstra for the FOLDS number (I've
forgotten it.)

You can also ask Telstra to do a line check.  You should explain that you
get unacceptably high rate of modem dropouts.  It helps if you know you
have a bad line, e.g. because of hum, or cross-talk, or static, when you
make a voice call.

I don't know how to tell if it's a modem compatibility problem.
