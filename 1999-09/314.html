This could get tedious :)
IF there is a floppy drive in the pC then, IMHO, the PC & O/S are at
risk regardless of whether the floppy is bootable or not because:
1) it takes a VERY short time to hack any BIOS Password & make the
floppy bootable!
2) refer to 1)
;)

PS
And so far, Antony,  you havent said anything that offends me... you are
entitled to disagree with me ;)

PPS:
Other than super-glueing/welding the pc lid shut I think this thread is
exhausted :)
Back to installing SuSE-6.2

&gt; No Only if the floppy drive is enabled for boot, if not then a floppy
&gt; drive being present in the machine is as useful to an attacker as you
&gt; having a mouse attached.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; At this point you have secured the OS to the point that someone has to
&gt; &gt; remove the Hard drive
&gt; &gt; &gt;  to get access to your system and we get back to physical security.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again....ONLY IF the linux box  is a)LILO password protected AND b) has
&gt; &gt; the floppy drive removed (which IMHO is a wise move!)
&gt; 
&gt; I would disagree, Floppy drives can be quite useful BUT you must manage the
&gt; security risk they entail. I would strongly recommend that unless you have
&gt; a good reason to make your floppy drive bootable (or any other media for
&gt; that matter) that you disable it in the bios.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you do that you are at physical security. Useful steps include
&gt; pad locking your case (many cases allow for such measures) and securing
&gt; it to you desk. There are very few people who are willing to carry a desk &
&gt; computer around until they can find a hacksaw :)
&gt; 
&gt; But as always you have to decide is this is needed, if you have
&gt; public access system is makes no sense to lock it in a computer room. If
&gt; you have a system running the HR database then you probably take more measures to
&gt; protect it as there WILL be sensitive data on it's Hard Drives.
&gt; 
&gt; I have no idea why this gets me so fired up - if I start offending people
&gt; forgive me :)
