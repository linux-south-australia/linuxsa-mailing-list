 &gt; Hello All
 &gt;
 &gt; I soon plan to set up a small network at home, to share printers and
the
 &gt; internet. I was just planning on using win95 and wingate but i've
heard
 &gt; linux can so just as well.
 &gt;
 
 better in my opinion
 
 &gt; Can any1 tell me exactly what i'd need to do just this? I need to be
able to
 &gt; share the internet with the protocols necessary for ICQ and online
games
 &gt; such as quake.
 &gt;
 &gt; Thankyou,

 well that depends on how serious you are and how much money you want to
 spend.
 but  yes it is possible.
 I've a network at home, with 5 boxes. I share a laser printer and two
 colour  printers using Samba . I  have  one box connected to the
 interent using a external  modem and with ip masquaradeing I can surf
 the net from all boxes.
 I can  mail between then, share files over the network.  sorry but I
 can't
 confirm icq and quake-  I don't  use them :). but I'm sure they do
work.
 
 I used a hub but you could have done this with just coax.  I have a w95
 box,
 a w98 box, a redhat 5.2 and a redhat6.0 box. the modem box run 5.2.
 if this is anything like what you want then yes linux can do it.  but
 It requires a bit of  work on your side, a lot of reading  and  a bit
of
 stress. It doesn't cost much, the os will work on a 486, and the os and
 most s/w  is free.
