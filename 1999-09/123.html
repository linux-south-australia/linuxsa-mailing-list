  &gt;&gt; "rdate" isn't really standard, it's more of a Sun-ism.  For clock
  &gt;&gt; synchronization, use xntpd.

  BA&gt; How on EARTH is a person supposed to find 'xntpd' when they are
  BA&gt; looking for 'date'?  

I'm glad you asked.  Two main methods are commonly used; see below.

  BA&gt; Similarly, thogh slightly less obscure, I suppose 'apsfilter'
  BA&gt; derives from 'A Post Script filter' - but how would you find it
  BA&gt; if you are looking for 'printer'?

  BA&gt; Its this *nix defiant elitist obscurity that provides a real
  BA&gt; barrier to new entrants to Linux.

How do you know which documentation to read?  Two methods:

(1) Carefully sift through _all_ your on-line documentation using your
    ample free time and your great powers of concentration (perhaps
    supplemented by a couple invaluable tools).  This option is
    commonly (and somewhat casually) referred to as "RTFM" (read the
    fine manual) by those elitist types.  This option suffers two main
    drawbacks:

    (A) What if the manual/info/html-doc/rfc/text-file/etc is not
        installed?  You're out of luck.  Go straight to method (2).

    (B) You need to know how to effectively _search_ your documentation!

	Others on this list have suggested various permutations based
	around using "[e]grep".  I think there is a better way.

	To use the xntpd example given above, wouldn't it be great if
	one could just get a list of _all_ documents that contained
	_all_ of these "words" in them:

            time  date  network  synchronize  clock  hardware

        Of course you can; this is Unix.  This is how I do it (from
	first principles of course; there are other approaches and
	various tools that can be used, but I learn more by doing it
	myself):

        (i) Use glimpseindex to set up an indexing and query system
	    that allows you to search through a large set of files
	    very quickly.  Index your man pages, HOWTOs, info pages,
	    RFCs and whatever else you might care to search, using
	    either distributed index files, or unify them all into one
	    index.  Establishing the index files need only be done
	    once (or whenever the information changes, e.g. after an
	    O/S upgrade).  Or make it a cron job.

	(ii) Use glimpse to search through the indices.  This can be
            scripted to make searching easier, if necessary.

        I ran glimpse with a `-c' option to just print the number of
	matching records, then went immediately to the files with the
	maximum number of "hits".  This gave me (with number of hits):
          - Most likely man page:  /usr/man/man8/hwclock.8.gz: 173
          - Most likely html page: /usr/doc/ntp-doc/html/notes.htm: 242
          - Most likely RFC: /usr/doc/doc-rfc/all-included-rfcs/rfc1305.txt.gz: 1392
                             (Network Time Protocol (Version 3))

	So it is easy to see how someone might find (x)ntpd if they
	want to synchronise their clock!

	(For the sake of "brevity", I've not included all the matches;
	there were 2 man pages, 3 distinct html docs, and about 3
	dozen RFCs that contained all six search words.)

	As for the apsfilter query, the following command looks for
        complete documents (-W) containing the two words "postscript"
        and "printer" (ignoring case (-i)), which lead me straight to
        /usr/doc/a2ps/a2ps.html (a2ps formats files for printing on a
        PostScript printer):

          glimpse -z -H /var/lib/glimpseindex/html -W -i -c \
            'postscript;printer' | sort -n -k2 | tail

        (Pages with less hits included
        /usr/share/doc/HOWTO/Printing-HOWTO.html, where apsfilter is
        mentioned).  Similar commands on my RFC and man-page indices
        lead to RFC1759 (Printer Management Information Base) and
        various useful man pages.

(2) Join a friendly mailing list and ask.

    If you're really unlucky you'll get a group that can't tell PS2
    from PS2, and then you're really in strife, but I'm sure that
    couldn't happen with linuxSA...

&lt;snip&gt;

  BA&gt; I feel better now.  :-)

Excellent.  I hope you have more luck finding what you need in the future.
