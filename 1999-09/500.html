Have a look at ABI word and the gnome office project...

www.abisource.com It has comercial backing and is coming along nicly. (It
supports text import of word documents)
I forget the gnome office project but it's at the gnome homepage.

&gt; Topic:  Reliance on Star Office could be dangerous.
&gt;
&gt; At the linuxSA meeting (Tuesday 21 Sep 1999),
&gt; someone (Paul Russell esq.?) mentioned that
&gt; Star Office could be withdrawn by Sun Microsystems
&gt; very quickly. Here's some support for that view:
&gt;
&gt;     <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/10276.html">http://linuxtoday.com/stories/10276.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; This is quite credible.
&gt; Sun could just set up a Star Office portal to
&gt; deliver SO as a set of java applets which you have to
&gt; be on the net to use, and which you don't get
&gt; source etc. for.
&gt; It is clear that there are few dollars for Sun Micro
&gt; (or should I say "Sun MS") in supporting linux.
&gt; Providing a free benefit for linux users is nowhere
&gt; near as important to Sun MS as weaning wind95/98/00/nt
&gt; users away from MS office.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore......
&gt; It's entirely likely that Star Office will become unavailable
&gt; some time in the next 12 months or so.
&gt; It is a big ueber-Klumpen-Software lump anyway, and has
&gt; no real future in the linux sleek-and-fast style of
&gt; software unless it can be completely cut to pieces
&gt; and rebuilt.
&gt;
&gt; This means that it is important to find better alternatives
&gt; quickly, and not rely on Star Office as the
&gt; conduit for MS-generated document formats.
&gt;
&gt; The alternative MS-format conduits seem to be
&gt;
&gt; Applixware
&gt; Koffice
&gt; ....
&gt;
&gt; ....not much else.
&gt; There's a real vulnerability here. Since there's a big momentum
&gt; tied up in MS-format files and human skills, it's really
&gt; important to find out how to survive the withdrawal
&gt; of SO from the free market.
&gt;
&gt; The matter of linux office software is very well discussed at
&gt;
&gt;     <A HREF="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/wp.html">http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/wp.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; Kword has got to version 0.0.1 !!!
&gt;
&gt;     <A HREF="http://koffice.kde.org/kword/">http://koffice.kde.org/kword/</A>
&gt;
&gt; It should be stunning when it's ready some time in the next decade.
&gt;
&gt; Just some thoughts in passing.
&gt; I just wanted to make the point that in the medium term,
&gt; the Sun MS acquisition of SO might be a very bad thing.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
