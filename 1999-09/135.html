Hi.

Yes, you are absolutely correct. Unfortunately the newbie filters of some
of us are less than ideally discriminating in regards to the level of
self-help already engaged in before posting. Some of us are also too ready
to pull out the flame-throwers at any opportunity.

This is maybe a reflection of the human condition?

The other common saying that is sometimes amusing, sometimes downright
frustrating, and often seems to be used as some kind of superiority
statement is : 

"the use of &lt;insert baffling utility or configuration file here&gt; is left
as an exercise for the reader" 

Perhaps an amount of newbie-toughening and expert-softening is needed.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Nevertheless, there are those within the Linux community who have little or

&gt; enquiry.
&gt; I wish they would desist.
&gt; 

&gt; I can't speak for every enquirer, but I would imagine that most do as I do,
&gt; namely diligently seek to find the answer themselves first, calling upon
&gt; this list only as a last resort.
