Hi All...

I currently run SuSE-5.3 & Caldera-2.2. I found Alan's dissertation
quite interesting & easy to read/comprehend.

A few comments.... Of all the LINUX's I have ever installed, I find SuSE
to be the cleanest/neatest/most functional (ie/ least amount of
install-type glitches!) Once you come to terms with some minor
shortcomings, a SuSE install is simple & relatively pain-free! Alan, the
install app (yast) is a breeze ONCE you get used to it & it is a simple
matter to add/remove apps whenever the mood strikes you - it only
appears dictatorial cos you let it tell you what to do..you can override
it!

One thing I did find annoying in the description of the SUSE-6.2 distro
was the apparent CARDBOARD CD Holders - SuSE-5.3 came in a "REAL"
CD-6-Pack!! :(  I shall have to go to my local $2 shop & buy some cd
cases !

Re the length of time for the install, in general SuSE is no
longer/shorter than any other (except maybe Caldera which seems to have
a very lengthy post-install).... I would imagine that mke2fs -c [a 13Gig
partition] is going to take a long time no matter what the distro!!

Anyway, I enjoyed Alan's description of his "installation-experience"
(the coffee sounded good!).

For what its worth, I was considering getting SuSE-6 but now that 6.2 is
out I will be contacting the appropriate ppl asap to get my copy and my
2 Caldera-2.2 boxes will be getting zapped!  

One question, I also intend upgrading all my SuSE-5.3 boxes to 6.2
(SuSE-5.3 had an option to upgrade from older versions so I assume 6.2
will have too) .... has anyone done this yet.... is THAT process pain
free???

Cheers, Phil
