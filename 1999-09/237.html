&gt; Hi All,=20
&gt;             I have been reading up on middleware technology, =
particularly CORBA stuff. I have read that this technology uses IIOP as =
the protocol
&gt; that runs on top of TCP/IP. I was wondering what Linux is up to in =
regards to supporting this protocol. I am also interested in people =
thoughts
&gt; on the benefits of IIOP over HTTP or vice versa. It might interest =
some of you to know that unisa is converting to teaching Java as a first =
year
&gt; language and that old favourites like C are out. If object-oriented is =
becoming so huge will people benefit from IIOP? Does IIOP overcome
&gt; some of the problems with CGI? I would be interested to hear from =
anyone that has any experience.

Please send only ASCII messages to LinuxSA, not HTML.

Anyway, now for the useful part of my reply...

I know bits and pieces about CORBA, IIOP, Linux, Java and CGI. Most of =
this knowledge is a little rusty, but I think I can help you out on some =
parts... with the disclaimer that everything is IIRC. (some acronyms are =
defined below)

Firstly, CORBA does use IIOP on TCP/IP. IIOP is a TCP/IP based =
implementation of GIOP. IIOP is not a competitor to HTTP. They do =
different things (from a programmer's point of view, at least). IIOP =
allows CORBA-based ORBs to communicate over TCP/IP. HTTP allows HTML =
text (among other things) to be transferred over TCP/IP (is HTTP =
TCP/IP-bound?). I believe it is actually possible to implement IIOP on =
HTTP. (Java's RMI can definitely be implemented over HTTP).

Plainly put:=20

CORBA allows distributed programmatic objects to communicate with each =
other almost as if they were local. It is language-independant, and uses =
IDL to define the interfaces between objects. The objects can be located =
on different machines, or on the same machine, but programmatically =
speaking, they don't need to explicitly know which machine they are on. =
All they do is request a particular type of object from the ORB, and =
they are connected with that object on some machine somewhere. BTW: when =
objects communicate, this is the same as saying that they call each =
other's methods.  (for all you procedural people, a method call is an OO =
equivalent to a function call, and CORBA is an OO equivalent to RPC)

Java/RMI does almost the same thing, but you need to know a little more =
about where the object you are communicating with is located. You are =
also restricted to communicating with Java objects (although there are =
relatively painless ways to integrate RMI and CORBA, and Java/RMI and =
other languages). However, you get the signifigant advantage that you =
can actually pass objects between remote computers, and hence can add =
new behaviour to a running program from a remote machine (is a lot more =
secure than it sounds...) Java also has technology called Jini (pron: =
"genie") which allows you to communicate with remote objects without =
knowing anything about where they are located. This combination =
(Java/RMI/Jini) is more powerful than CORBA, but suffers from being =
restricted to objects written (or at least "wrapped") in Java, which =
doesn't suit everyone.

HTTP/HTML/CGI allows fairly basic interactions between a browser and the =
HTTP server. You send simple HTTP requests, and the server returns HTML =
pages. CGI can be written pretty much any language, (C, C++, Perl, Java, =
csh, bash, etc -- or any combination), but is restricted in that it's =
primary interaction is text (HTML) based. You can embed Java applets and =
JavaScript and do some pretty tricky things, but CGI is not particularly =
interactive -- it's very much a client-server, you ask, I give, whereas =
CORBA and RMI allow almost the same functionality in a distributed =
environment as you get in a non-distributed environment. Java servelets =
are a separate technology that do pretty much the same thing...

Anyway, enough of the quasi-technical mumbo-jumbo... In the Real World =
(tm), there are situations where HTML and CORBA (and CGI and RMI/Java) =
can be used to acheive the same goal. The goal is that you need to =
develope a distributed applicaiton. Some will be more suited to a simple =
CGI/HTML style interface (eg many e-commerce sites, with lots of forms =
and so on). Some will need a lot more, and will want to escape the =
browser paradigm. For these, you really need something more flexible, =
like CORBA, RMI or Jini -- or some combination.

Damn, that was a lot more than I intended to write.... I'll skip a bit, =
and mention Linux....

Linux has some CORBA stuff on it. GNOME is CORBA-based. If the GNOME =
team take advantage of all that CORBA can do, there could be some =
exciting possibilities in terms of distributed applications. It could =
also open up the door for more interoperability with commercial =
products... However, I don't know what the real status is at the moment. =
If you are wanting to do some distributed programming (as opposed to =
just serving dynamically generated web pages), Java/RMI is definitely =
the best option at the moment, particularly as it is so easy to learn, =
and abstracts away enough of the messy, tedious bits to allow the =
programmer to focus on the real problem of distribution, and not the =
mechanics of it... Unfortunately, Linux is not the best place for Java =
at the moment. The choice is Solaris or Windows -- Windows runs Java =
best, but I like developing on a Unix, so I use Solaris for =
deveopment... If you want to do CORBA stuff, be prepared for an =
exceptionally steep learning curve, as you need to know a fair bit... =
Start with learning Object Orientation (a hard task in itself), then C++ =
and Linux developement tools, and then learn about CORBA and IDL, and =
then try doing something with the bits and pieces that GNOME provides -- =
although be careful of non-standard or incomplete implementations, as =
GNOME is still under development. If you just want to do procedureal =
distributed stuff, try RPC (I know almost nothing of RPC, except that it =
is quite hard), and if you want to do what Linux is best at, try CGI =
with Perl (or C).

I wrote way too much, and need to do some work :)
