Gee, dread. If you know that much, how come you didn't think to do as Brad
suggests?:
&gt;Brad
&gt;p.s one another thought why not just pull the network plug til lthe problem
&gt;could be fixed, no network plug not spamming.
This procedure would have preserved all your configuration files (probably)
and made fixing the problem so very much easier and less costly in time or
resources.

As Alan said, some of the things you have said, don't add up - and they don't.
Which causes confusion to all, and irritation to some.

NOW ...  I have RedHat 5.2 which cost me $10, so pay me that much and the 3
CDs are yours - permanently.  I'm in the NW of Adelaide, so perhaps my
offer won't help you much, but at least it's an offer.
You do need to publish your location in this list, and ask for someone to
call in to reinstall Linux and the network setup, and fix the problem. (As
a trainee you might be posted elsewhere as part of your training quite
soon, so you might not need to be shown what to do to maintain the system.)

There is no shame involved in being ignorant, but clearly if your knowledge
is minimal it will be next to impossible for you to be given adequate help
on your complex problem, via email.
