&gt; &gt;I want to get into linux programming a bit more seriously than I am at the
&gt; &gt;moment. For my first little project, I was thinking of writing a program
&gt; &gt;to let me log in remotely to a linux machine and execute a program,
&gt; &gt;without needing to use telnet.

Well it has actually been done.  It is called IPMasqDialer (IIRC).  Have
a dig around freshmeat for more info.

Add to this the ease at which you can control the dialup connection with
a web server and a script.

But then again, you said it was a bit of a pet project.  Have fun.  There are
a few good reference books around, and under Linux you have tons of free
reference implementations to work with.

Keep in mind also that you can use inetd to make life a whole lot easier by
creating a server that doesn't need to know about TCP/UDP.  It just accepts
things from stdin.

Regards,

Matt
