That's probably not true.  It depends exactly where in
the Australian Internet you are as to which path incoming
overseas-sourced news takes.  If you were an AARNet user
then most exploitative images would appear to come from Optus,
as they pull in the international newsfeed for the AARNet network.


&gt; alt.binaries.erotica.wombats

Personally I find alt.sex.pictures.mr-squiggle more compelling.
Perhaps it's the nose :-)


&gt; Or perhaps I need to seek legal advice on them serving porn.

Telstra is protected against the nature of carried traffic by
the Telcommunications Act (search www.austlii.edu.au if you
need the section).

Oddly, non-telco ISPs have no legislative protection (read
that carefully: they made have judical protection, but there
is a lack of precedent, so you wouldn't want to stake too
much on it).
