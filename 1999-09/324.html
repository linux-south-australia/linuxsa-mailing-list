Hi Darryl,

&gt;Hey All,
&gt;
&gt;I want to get into linux programming a bit more seriously than I am at the
&gt;moment. For my first little project, I was thinking of writing a program
&gt;to let me log in remotely to a linux machine and execute a program,
&gt;without needing to use telnet.
&gt;
&gt;(For my parents server. I want to be able to set it so mum can click a
&gt;button on her Windows machine and it will log in to the Net. She's got no
&gt;hope of learning how to log in using telnet and run the appropiate
&gt;commands.)
&gt;
&gt;My question is where can I find out information about how to do this? I
&gt;could probably get the actual program to do what I need it to do (run
&gt;external system commands, etc), but I have no idea about sockets
&gt;programming. Is there any good references around that might help me?

It seems to me that you are asking about Windows Sockets, which are an
entirely different kettle of fish from Unix sockets.  Well, in many ways
they are different.

You will want to write a winsock program to connect to the Linux machine,
and log in if need be.  However, you might consider rsh or something
equivalent.

Now, thinking laterally, why don't you create a special share on the Linux
machine using Samba.

The Icon you click on on Windoze runs a batch script that does a net use
etc to access the special share.

Then, in the special share, run a root preexec script which brings up the
network ...

What could be simpler :-)

&gt;TIA
&gt;Dazz
