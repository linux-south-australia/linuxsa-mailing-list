MWP:

==============================================================
If you want to optimise your kernel, try compiling it with PGCC.
This will compile it for your particular processor (like in my case a PII)
by using that CPUs enhanced instruction sets and cache usage optimisations.
Using PGCC will optimise your kernel more than changing GCC's optimisation
level and will be a LOT safer.       
==============================================================

As it happens, mandrake 6.0 comes with PGCC as the only choice of
compiler (as far as I could determine). No gcc 2.7.2 and no plain egcs.
And it turns out that if you compile the XFree3.3.4 source
with PGCC, it doesn't work -- you get SEGV when you try to
run the X server. And this is also well documented in
the XFree86 documentation.

It's all a bit confusing about which of these compilers is
suitable for what software. 
SuSE 6.2 has egcs-2.91.66.
But I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

But all things considered, it looks to me like using this
Pentium GCC version of EGCS should be high risk.
I'll just have to wait for the O'Reilly book on
the GCC family of compilers to disentangle it.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
PS.  My brief researches (and some 2-3 years of
speaking German in Germany) tell me that SuSE is most
probably pronounced zooza. All native German words
starting with su are pronounced zoo- in my dictionary.
But another possibility, due to the fact that both
Susi and Suse are diminutives of Susan, is that it should be
"sooza". My intuition tells me that Susi must start with soo-,
maybe because it is a non-German name.
It also happens that there is a tool "susephone", which is
a pun on "Susaphone" or something.
My conclusion is that "sooza" is the most likely
pronunciation, but "zooza" is also possible.
Please don't post replies to this message to
the whole list.
