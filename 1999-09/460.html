Hi again... at the risk of sounding a tad critical.... I assume you have
set the default route(s)?? do you get any "no route to host" type
msgs... does ifconfig ppp0 show appropriate details/does route -n show
default route to the P-t-P ip at the other end????

I hate these sort of probs....easier to dela with if you're "on the
spot" but a bit hard to diagnose if you are 500kms+ away :)

&gt; ok, more info.
&gt; 
&gt; ppp stays alive.
&gt; 
&gt; routing is still active.
&gt; 
&gt; linux RH6 is the end that *answers*
&gt; 
&gt; not kppp, just pure pppd - whic *doesn't* die.
&gt; 
&gt; a ping from the other end causes their TX light to flash - and our RX
&gt; light to flash, but a ping from our end produces nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; at this point, obviously, we have made a connection, been auth'ed
&gt; properlly and have even down some comms (for roughly 5 minutes) before
&gt; its stops working.
&gt; 
&gt; turning off compression helps. It dies after 6-7 minutes.
&gt; 
&gt; strike on both the cans/string and pegions
&gt; 
&gt; i still think Telstra hates me :)

&gt; &gt; Oh, another easy one.  If the line stays up it's obviously isn't a
&gt; &gt; line/modem problem, so it must be a ppp problem.  BTW I believe you can
&gt; &gt; shut down a ppp daemon and restart it successfully.  I've never done that,
&gt; &gt; in fact I was horrified to hear it was possible.  If the PPP keeps shutting
&gt; &gt; down, does restarting it help?  Also, is it really pppd that shuts down, or
&gt; &gt; is it something crazy like routes disappearing? If you are running a
&gt; &gt; routing daemon (e.g. routed or gated), *DON'T*.  If you've only got one
&gt; &gt; external link your routing table only needs a single static, default route.
