APC NEW UPGRADES


1. PowerChute(R) plus for Novell NetWare v4.3.3


This latest version of APC's uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
monitoring 
software provides manageability of APC UPSs through NDS, reduces
network 
traffic, improves security and increases ease-of use.

APC's unique power management integration with NDS provides the
following 
benefits:

Simplifies UPS asset management.  Every UPS is represented by an APC
UPS 
icon (or object) in the NWAdmin utility.  UPS objects can be expanded
in 
order to access to information such as UPS model, UPS serial number,
power 
status, firmware revision, battery replacement status, battery health,
and 
communications port.

Improves security validation.  PowerChute(R) plus leverages the native
NDS 
security.  As a result, administrators can manage power through the 
PowerChute GUI using a single, secure login.  It is not necessary to
enter 
additional passwords.

Enhances network performance.  PowerChute plus automatically updates
its 
information via the NDS tree rather than sending repeated message 
broadcasts via bindery emulation.

PowerChute plus for NetWare ships with all APC Smart-UPS(R),
Matrix-UPS(R), 
and Symmetra(R) Power Array UPS models.

2. PowerChute(R) plus for SCO UnixWare v4.2.4


PowerChute(R) plus for SCO UnixWare v4.2.4 provides graceful,
unattended 
shut downs of UnixWare servers during extended power outages.  In
addition 
it receives power alerts immediately (including proactive battery 
replacement notification), quickly diagnoses problems using power
event and 
data logs and monitors power through a standard web browser (using the
APC 
WebAgent option).

PowerChute plus for SCO UnixWare ships with all APC Smart-UPS(R), 
Matrix-UPS(R), and Symmetra(R) Power Array UPS models.

3. PowerChute(R) Integration with Compaq Insight Manager


This latest release of PowerXtend(TM) for Compaq Insight Manager (CIM) 
makes APC the only third-party uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
vendor to 
integrate power management with CIM's Web management console.  The 
enhancement gives Compaq server users the ability to manage their
entire 
server system from one central console, anywhere they have a Web
browser.

PowerXtend for CIM offers network managers several differentiating 
functions enabling users to:

Schedule unattended UPS and battery self-tests

Manage power in a mixed operating systems environment - PowerXtend
manages 
both NetWare and Windows NT servers from the CIM Web console toolbar

Troubleshoot power problems with a diagnostic log complete with
detailed 
historical data; and

Remotely configure UPS parameters, including UPS sensitivity,
acceptable 
input voltage, and minimum battery charge return delay.

PowerChute Integration for Compaq Insight Manager ships with all APC 
Smart-UPS(R), Matrix-UPS(R),and  Symmetra(R) Power Array UPS models.

7. Updated Chart Available on the Web


&gt;From an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) standpoint, "Year 2000  
compliancy" requires that critical dates are calculated and displayed  
accurately and scheduled events such as shutdowns, self-tests, and
run-time 
calibrations, are unaffected by the millennium and century  change.
