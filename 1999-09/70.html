&gt;I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about support for the &gt;G400 
&gt;video card under X?

I had a look at the Matrox website, which suggested that one would have to 
purchase a commercial X server, which I thought was simply ridiculous.  I 
then checked out the XFree86 website, which said that the G400 is supported 
since version 3.3.4.  This means that the method which I described in my 
last post (Banshee, TNT, i740, etc.) will also work for your card.  Note 
that version 3.3.5 is also now available.

This is the information from the XFree86 website for those interested:

What's new in 3.3.4?
   Several security fixes.
   Intel i740 support.
   SiS 530 and SiS 620 support.
   3Dfx Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo3 support.
   Trident Blade3D, CyberBlade and Cyber9525 support.
   S3 Trio3D support.
   Matrox G400 support.
   NVIDIA Riva TNT2 support and better acceleration for all Riva
   chipsets.
   Rewritten Cyrix MediaGX support. Warning: (see website)
   Acceleration for XF68_FBDev on PPC.
   VMWare's DGA-1.1 extension.
   Change xterm to use the tty default value for the backspace key.
   Japanese documentation and manpage updates.
   Updates and new hardware support (Acecad flair, Calcomp
   DrawingBoard) for xinput extension.
   Bug fixed for cards with S3 Aurora64V+ (M65) chip, VGA output
   should now work.

What's new in 3.3.5?

   Support for S3 Savage4 and Savage3D.
   Support for S3 Trio3D/2X.
   Support for DGux.
   Support for QNX.
   Fix bug in Mach64 server on Rage LT and Rage LT Pro.
   Fix SiS driver for 530 and 620.
   Fix the spurious underline problem on NVidia Riva TNT cards.
   Fix the PS/2 mouse problem with later Linux kernels.
   Misc updates and bugfixes in Rendition driver.
   Updates from SuSE and Red Hat, including more keyboards, PAM
   support, ARM and AXP fixes, security fixes.

If anyone wants to know whether his (correct grammar, folks, don't flame me) 
card is supported by X, the XFree86 website is always a good place to look.  
Perhaps you could treat this as a psuedo FAQ, and check here first before 
you mail here (though we are always willing to help).  The website is
