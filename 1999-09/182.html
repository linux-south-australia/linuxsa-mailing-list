Lost Password
_____________

The theory is that you get into the system (somehow) and get into level
one. Level one is a special maintenance level and it won't support the
network, however you should be able to change the password forcibly by
issuing a passwd command. Level one logs you in with forcibly as root.

The way to get into level one can be tricky. If the system were already
running, one would simply telinit into it. But alas! You don't tell me
the version of RedHat...RedHat 5.2 and 6.x series behave significantly
differently, however here's one way of doing it with RedHat 5.2: There's
no default way to get into root (icck - what a security issue if there
were?).

I will give you three options to try in order - please wait a while
before using the last one though:

If you still get a lilo prompt attempt to type "linux single" and see
what happens. If that doesn't work, type the [tab] key and then type in
whatever it comes up with followed by single. Proceed from step 3 below

***
If that doesn't work then you could try this (it works n RedHat 5.2 but
not 6.0):

1) Insert the install disk in the CD (or the Boot CD)
2) Type in linux single root=/dev/[whatever root was - you might need to
guess] ro initrd=
3) Wait to see what happens and take a good look at the messages
scrolling by
4) Type passwd (and man passwd if you don't know anything about that
command) and off you go...
5) It wouldn't hurt to run lilo again just in case the MBR got
rearranged as well

Now, if you CAN'T do that, have lost the install disks, don't have a
bootable CD ROM or whatever you'll have to find someone kind enough to
lend you a very basic rescue disk.

****
If all else fails here's another solution:

1) Reinstall but DO NOT format ANYTHING except the swap space
2) Reenter a new password

Use this as the final solution if nothing else works. It won't wipe any
user's data but you'll have to set up routing tables, networking, user
groups, users and everything else. It would be a pain but it would
enable you to recover the system. I'd advise you to wait a while before
doing this because someone else may come up with a better solution

****
If THAT doesn't work, then pretend you're using NT and go for a total
reinstall (:-P).
