&gt; &gt; So you are just plain wrong on both counts.

&gt; Am I missing something here?  Isn't 243571K about 200MB?  I know
&gt; Applixware is commercial; isn't Phil plain correct on both counts?

No, that's just my stupidity in action -- 200MB is the full
install, complete with example clip art.  You need about
130MB for a more reasonable install.

For contrast, other alternatives are:

  - WordPerfect 8 (which doesn't have spreadsheet
    or presentations) uses about 57MB.

  - XEmacs + teTex uses about 70MB + 110MB = 180MB.
    I've got full installs of both -- you could
    probably go a lot lighter. 

  - StarOffice 5.01 uses 65MB (this might be wrong?)

In terms of performance, Applix is not great on a 486, but
it is useable.  It takes a while to start, but is fine once
it is going.  That's true of 486s in general -- performance
feels to be about the same as a Sun SLC (menus are not snappy
and you can *see* which bits of the program aren't coded too
well).  Go and get a coffee if you reboot.

I wouldn't even try to start StarOffice on a 486 &lt;shudder&gt;.
SO's poor performance seems mainly due to the Wind/U toolkit
and the browser-like user interface model.  You get the feeling
that dropping Windows source compatibility and using GTK+ or Qt
in place of Wind/U would boost performance a lot.

Disclaimer: I use XEmacs + teTeX for word processing.  I mainly
 use Applix for reading Word files and writing presentations.
 I don't use StarOffice for presentations as it's simply too
 flaky (it doesn't look good when you say "let's use Linux for
 XYZ because it is cheaper and more reliable", and then your
 presentation dies on the next slide :-).  There are no good
 open source presentation programs (and I include MagicPoint and
 TclPresents in this).
