I should start this with NEWBIE alert as I have been watching the list for
some time but I think preparedness of list membership to assist newbies is a
strength of the Linux community. Newbie questions reinforce our
understanding of the topic being discussed and invariably create discussion
about other matters as well as making those newbies feel like someone wants
to help them without holding the hand out for a fistful of bucks.

Having said all that my question is which box.

Would you recommend that I partition my PIII 500 with 128M of RAM and a 10G
hard drive with a Linux partition running alongside Windoze 98 or should I
toss it on my DX266 with 20M of Ram and a 1.2G hard drive as a pure Linux
machine.
