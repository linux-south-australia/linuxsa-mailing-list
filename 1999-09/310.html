No Only if the floppy drive is enabled for boot, if not then a floppy
drive being present in the machine is as useful to an attacker as you
having a mouse attached.

&gt; &gt; At this point you have secured the OS to the point that someone has to
&gt; remove the Hard drive
&gt; &gt;  to get access to your system and we get back to physical security.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Again....ONLY IF the linux box  is a)LILO password protected AND b) has
&gt; the floppy drive removed (which IMHO is a wise move!)

I would disagree, Floppy drives can be quite useful BUT you must manage the 
security risk they entail. I would strongly recommend that unless you have
a good reason to make your floppy drive bootable (or any other media for 
that matter) that you disable it in the bios.

Once you do that you are at physical security. Useful steps include
pad locking your case (many cases allow for such measures) and securing
it to you desk. There are very few people who are willing to carry a desk &
computer around until they can find a hacksaw :)

But as always you have to decide is this is needed, if you have
public access system is makes no sense to lock it in a computer room. If
you have a system running the HR database then you probably take more measures to 
protect it as there WILL be sensitive data on it's Hard Drives.

I have no idea why this gets me so fired up - if I start offending people 
forgive me :)
