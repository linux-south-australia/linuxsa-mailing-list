&gt; &gt; A while back I was trying to get DHCP running under Debian... I had no

&gt; 
&gt; 	By "DHCP", do you mean a DHCP _server_, or do you mean
&gt; 	setting up your machine as a DHCP _client_? 

Going by the IP his box has assigned, I'm guessing a client.

&gt; &gt; Is their something significant about the IP address 192.168.1.254? Where
&gt; &gt; is this coming from?  My IP address should be something like:
&gt; &gt; 24.192.10.XX

My guess is that your Linux box has tried to find a DHCP server somewhere
on your LAN, and not been successful, so its set, what it thinks, is a
"safe" IP address that isn't likely to be used.

Are you running the DHCP server? Can you check to make sure it is actually
running and has a proper network connection? Are you sure _your_ network
connection is ok?

Taking a wild guess, but are you able to see any of the other machines on
the network?  (you shouldn't be able to unless your default route is set).

Can you check your network connection and get back to us?
