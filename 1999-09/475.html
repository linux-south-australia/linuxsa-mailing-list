&gt; UNASKED FOR ADVICE
&gt; ------------------
&gt;
&gt; I am no expert at linux but I am on virtually every mailing list in
&gt; Australia. I receive about 400 emails per day.

Soo??? It doent mean you read them all which you prolly dont.
And even if you do, it doesnt mean you know all.

&gt; Here is my observation:
&gt; 1) If an external modem isn't working either the hardware is literally
&gt; faulty or something else is

Well obviously :P

&gt; 2) If an internal modem isn't working it's normally the internal modem
&gt; at fault.

Why???
An internal ISA modem even though they are cheaper SHOULD be easier to get
working... because there is one less link in the chain you have to worry
about (the motherboards com port). If there is no physical problem with the
internal modem (which 98% of the time there isnt) its obviously a software
problem or a problem with the the set up of resources (ports and irqs).

&gt; The advice? DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING AN INTERNAL MODEM AND EXPECT TO BE
ABLE TO PUT IT IN A LINUX BOX AND MAKE IT WORK. The bandwidth that I've seen
taken up by this subject is quite amazing. This doesn't mean
&gt; that they don't work or they're not good, it simply means that they may
&gt; need a little more work to get them working.

What a load of bollocks.
An internal ISA modem (non winmodem) uses up no more CPU data and address
time than an external modem. All an internal modem does is sit on the bus
and listen for requests on a hardware port (exactly the same as the
motherboard com port does). If you knew about hardware ports and the ISA bus
you would know this.

I have an old crappy no-name brand internal 56K ISA modem (non winmodem)...
it works perfectly. I had noo problems at all setting it up to be on a weird
port and IRQ 7 and getting linux to work with it. I actually had a 3COM
external 56K voice modem (one of the best on the market) to play with for a
while, and the internal was much better (ease of setup in linux and transfer
speeds).

Dont give poeple the wrong idea... internal ISA modems are as good as any
external modem.
