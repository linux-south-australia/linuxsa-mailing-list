&gt; &gt; &gt; a similarly powered Apple computer might outrun a similarly powered

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfair!  Talk about not comparing Apples with apples.  Snigger.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I know it's unfair. But it is my honest recollection of what the other
&gt; people said to me. I have toned it down to a "might", however, this is
&gt; definitely a trend in what was being written to me.
Have you ever noticed how, say, Christians always think their religion
is best, and yet other religions also say that their particular one is
'right'?
Everyone is crying "there is only one true god" but if you ask different
people which one is the one, you get different answers depending who you
ask.
If you suggest one is actually better than the other, you tend to get
these nasty jihads. So it's generally not a good idea to start comparing
macs and PCs in such general terms.

I can't stand the old Mac O/S, and it really is pretty hopeless. (Makes
windows look good sometimes! heh now that's saying something). However,
I don't have anything against the hardware itself. But I'd prefer a K8
to a G4.
