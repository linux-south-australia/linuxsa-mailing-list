well it is fix it if you can job my main job as trainee is to look after the
network i said i would give it a go and if not then the ywill send it off to
get done but as part of my traineeship i have to attemp new platforms so i
said i will try i installed it np but setting up the other stuff will take
me time and i don't think i can learn all that in just 1 weekend. i have
informed my boss on what i think i can and can't do and she is going form
there. i am at the howto's pages but there is so much stuff to look through.
I am a fast learner but this stuff is gonna take time. I have already told
my boss that i don't know if i can do it but she is willing to let me give
it a go untill she can get it sent off.

&gt;
&gt; Well, if you'd stated this, then you may have got a friendlier response.
&gt;
&gt; People who DO know what they're doing generally don't like it if people
&gt; who are getting PAID to know what they're doing DONT.
&gt;
&gt; Now, if you're a trainee, and its beeen given to you as a "if you can fix
&gt; it cool, but if not, we'll get it done anyway" as opposed to "you're being
&gt; paid to fix this or else", then thats cool too.
&gt;
&gt; Get on the Internet, and goto all the linux sites, and learn what to do.
&gt;
&gt; Decide/determine what you need on the machine, then read the howto's,
&gt; thats the best place to start.
