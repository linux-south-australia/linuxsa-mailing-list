Well, Mr. Dread, this might be a bad time to tell you, but formatting
the harddrive was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. If you'd read the
messages earlier today, you would have seen they were about how to
regain access and reset the passwords in just these sort of cases.

However, it's obviously too late now. 

If you're starting from scratch you would be well off to get a recent
version of Red Hat, instead of 5.0. Not only will it be easier to
install and use, but also more secure.

Now, you've admitted you don't really know anything about linux, but
that you've been pressured into this by your school. I would seriously
reccommend that your school goes out and hires a professional. Linux
isn't something you can master overnight. While I'm sure LinuxSA people
could coach you thru installing and setting up Squid, without knowledge
of security aspects of Linux, your server would only end up getting
hacked again.

Linux is stable, powerful, and secure, when set up correctly. It is more
user-friendly than other Unix variants. However, it is still a far cry
from Windoze, where you just insert a CD, follow some defaults, and
reboot.

It's encouraging to see another person attempting to learn how to use
it, but many people, especcially on this list, assume that as soon as
you know how to change directories and edit a file, that they're an
expert in the field.

If you can't use punctuation or correct spelling in your email, and
blithely ignore the non-HTML-emails request for this mailling list, then
I don't like your chances at editting system files that will require
exact case and spelling, and probably a good reading of instructions.

Yours,
Toby
