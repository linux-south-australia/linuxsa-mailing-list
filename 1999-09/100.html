&gt;"rdate" isn't really standard, it's more of a Sun-ism.  For clock

How on EARTH is a person supposed to find 'xntpd' when they are looking for
'date'?  Similarly, thogh slightly less obscure, I suppose 'apsfilter'
derives from 'A Post Script filter' - but how would you find it if you are
looking for 'printer'?

Its this *nix defiant elitist obscurity that provides a real barrier to new
entrants to Linux.

As another example of this obscurity, a little while ago I asked for help
on getting my PS2 mouse to work in Linux.  I obtained much advice (thanks),
none of which worked :-( because PS2 in GPM means 'busmouse', not PS2
serial port.  Go figure.
I was advised that the kernel had NOTHING to do with mouse support.  WRONG!
I found out by accident (I went to the wrong page on the SuSE web site)
that PS2 support must be compiled into the kernel, or (maybe) char-major-4
must be compiled as a loadable module.
ie even the experts on this list can be confused by the aforementioned
defiant elitist obscurity.

I feel better now.  :-)
