Come on Guys - Dread is asking for help here. Being nasty aint helping anyone.
Just a note to suggest that Dread need the services of a professional would have
been sufficient.

I am a novice myself (having trouble installing a copy of Redhat 6.0) and have had
some great encouragement from people on the list. If this is the kind of response
that is received by people in need of some help - then I think you will find that
this will end up being an elitist type of mailing list and not anywhere near the
philosophy being expounded by the free to all makers of Linux.

My 20 cents worth

&gt; &gt; oh no its not stupid it is serious our linux proxy serevr was hacked and
&gt; &gt; someone changed all the passwords and started using it as a relay to =
&gt; &gt; spam
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ( i was unable to aceess the linux o/s so i have formated the drive and
&gt; &gt; installed linux redhat vr 5 i don't know anything about linux but my =
&gt; &gt; school
&gt;
&gt;         You were 'unable' to access the OS?
&gt;         Okay, I have a few questions:
&gt;
&gt;         1) Are you in charge of the computers at your school?
&gt;         If so, please enlighten me as to which idiot hired you?
&gt;         If not, what in God's name were you doing  formatting the
&gt;         harddrive?
&gt;
&gt;         2) How did you know that they were spamming if you were 'unable to get
&gt;         access to the linux o/s'?
&gt;
&gt;         3) Did you format your harddrive as a last resort?
&gt;         If so, was it after reading any of the messages posted today?
&gt;
&gt;         4) How did you manage  to format the harddrive?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; is pressureing me to get it fixed and fast as they have no internet =
&gt; &gt; access
&gt; &gt; now i am at home and need to know what i have to do in x windows to set
&gt; &gt; stuff up i have most of the settings i need but i don't know anything =
&gt; &gt; about
&gt;
&gt;         X-windows won't save yer ass now boy. You need a commandline,
&gt;         and a clue.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; it i have till moday to have it working
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;         Fortunately, there is a wealth of knowledge on this list.
&gt;         Prices are reasonable.
&gt;         Personal advice is free of charge.
&gt;
