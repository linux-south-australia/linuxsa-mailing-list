Phil and others,

There is a lot of publicly available information on how to get root access to a box already, (eg. Linux Pocketbook even has a section) all that one has to do is to look for it. The amount of times I have booted linux, from boot disks, to do something with some piece of hardware that can't be done with some other operating systems....like the slackware boot disks no password required but full access to the machine.  The point being that information for getting into and changing the root password is definately publicly available and as already metioned a few times, a box may be only as secure as its physical security.  A point that all sys admins should consider.

Good healthy discussion on an issue that we all should be a very interested in.  :^)

My 2 &lt;substitute denomination here&gt; worth.

&gt; Subject: 	Re: Linux Console Security
&gt; 
&gt; OK..... I have contemplated the various comments made & one comment in
&gt; particular has swayed me. (That comment being along the lines that IF
&gt; SysAdmin's are aware that an insecure linux box can easily be hacked by
&gt; someone at the keyboard  , then perhaps they will view the "physical
&gt; security" of their linux boxes as being VERY important.
&gt; 
&gt; NB: Matthew Tippett is the only person to come up with the correct
&gt; method in!! :) A gold star for Matthew !!
&gt; 
&gt; Step 1:
&gt; Reboot PC
&gt; 
&gt; Step 2:
&gt; At the LILO:  prompt hit TAb to get a list of the various boot
&gt; options.... select any linux boot (ie/ LINUX    MOUNT     BACKUP  etc)
&gt; For the purposes of the exercise we will assume that there is a lilo
&gt; boot  called LINUX   :)
&gt; 
&gt; Step3:
&gt; type this
&gt; 
&gt; linux init=/bin/sh
&gt; 
&gt; Step4:
&gt; Within seconds (ish) you will see the linux prompt (# or whatever). You
&gt; can use most (if not all)  Linux commands although you may need to use
&gt; the full path for some.
&gt; type this
&gt; 
&gt; mount -n -o remount,rw /
&gt; 
&gt; (NB: even if you did a 'mount' command  after getting the  prompt & it
&gt; said that / was mounted rw , still do the above command.... 99% chance
&gt; that you are not really mounted rw!!!)
&gt; 
&gt; Step 5:
&gt; type this
&gt; passwd
&gt; 
&gt; now enter the new root passwd!!
&gt; OR
&gt; 
&gt; passwd (username)
&gt; 
&gt; to change any other users password!!
&gt; 
&gt; Step 6:
&gt; type this
&gt; 
&gt; remount -n -o remount,ro /
&gt; 
&gt; Step 7:
&gt; type this:
&gt; 
&gt; /sbin/reboot
&gt; OR
&gt; /sbin/shutdown -r now
&gt; 
&gt; Step8:
&gt; IF the box doesnt reboot, wait til you cant hear any hard drive activty
&gt; & then press reset
&gt; 
&gt; That's it.... THIS obviously only works at the keyboard BUT it renders
&gt; any insecure linux box in an office/school/ISP's etc extremely
&gt; vulnerable!!
