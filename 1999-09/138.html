I use SuSE.  Maybe there is an equivalent in the v6.2 to which I have
recently upgraded?  Dunno.

&gt;Even if there are some problems with the level and quality of the
documentation
&gt;available for Linux and other Open Source applications as a user group we
&gt;can still effectively do indexing for people.

Phil's response was a fine and most helpful example of this.
So is your post, as an encouragement to others.

&gt;As an aside, how do people fare find niggly bits of information for 
&gt;Windows.  Whenever I have had a look at the documentation it tends to be
&gt;very light in detail.  And usually I end up trawling the net for a solution
&gt;to the really hard problems.

Heavens! This isn't an 'isn't WinDoze better' (??!) plea.
The one thing that M$ stuff does is configure for you, so provided your
needs are (M$ approved) standard, your plug and pray is answered, and your
peripherals and programs work 'straight out of the box'.  Of course if you
have non-standard needs you will be treated (Micro)softly.  Yuk!

I'm trying to standardise on Linux to get away from that, and the 'we have
that fixed in the next release' answer to every ***** question.
Patronising  ***** and ******  *******  money hungry ****** s  ... !!

The GPL-GNU-Linux philosophy suits me just fine, and such performance as I
have been able to configure looks pretty good, too.  I just wish it was
less obscure and more certain of first-time success to do that configuring.
