Just a quickie, do you have compression turned on ?, if so turn it off. This
can cause the problems you are having, I have had similar and it was cause
the damn modem setup installed with this setting.

Subject: Mail collection problems


&gt; Sorry that this isn't Linux-specific, but I'm sure this is a good place to
&gt; be asking:
&gt;
&gt; I'm often having problems with collecting my e-mail (Win95/OE5). The
&gt; majority of the time it's fine, but it seems to be happening more often
that
&gt; I'm having trouble. The problem is that I frequently get timeouts while
&gt; collecting e-mail (POP3 at SENet in Adelaide and at my ISP here in
Brisbane
&gt; whose mail server would appear to be in Sydney). These occur both during
the
&gt; LIST phase and the Retrieve(?) phase. My timeout is currently set to 60s,
&gt; and when I'm experiencing difficulty the timeouts happen pretty frequently
&gt; (i.e. once I get a timeout, or perhaps more usually a second timeout,
&gt; chances are they'll just keep happening, only on a rare occasion will the
&gt; process "resume" without further interruption).
&gt;
&gt; 1) Is 60s too short? If I were to set a timeout of, say, 300s, would it be
&gt; more likely to succeed without my intervention (of clicking the [continue
&gt; to] "Wait" button). My experience of attempting 10 times in a row without
&gt; success suggests "no" to me. Further to this, what exactly is happening
&gt; here? That is, why exactly does it sometimes work (to keep waiting), and
&gt; sometimes not? Does not POP3 use reliable packet delivery mechanism
(TCP?),
&gt; and if so, why does it fail (and if not, why is it able to resume
&gt; successfully, sometimes?). And is there any built-in recovery mechanism
that
&gt; will ensure that the delivery will occur, given sufficient time?
&gt;
&gt; 2) Where is the failure happening here? Is it just network congestion
&gt; resulting in lost packets? Are there any tools I can use to try to isolate
&gt; where this is happening? I have often used traceroute to see if anything
&gt; might be revealed. Only on a few occasions have I seen evidence of
problems
&gt; which I presume have explained my mail collection problem. This seems to
&gt; have been on Telstra's Melb/Adel link (not getting past Melbourne). I once
&gt; saw packets getting routed via Hobart in an effort to make their way to
lil'
&gt; ol' Adelaide! But traceroute obviously just doesn't cut it for this - as I
&gt; write, I'm hung on receiving message #6, all traceroute can show me is
that
&gt; I've got no worse than about a 200ms ping over the 16 hops to
&gt; pluto.senet.com.au. Worse (IMO) is that I'm having the same problem with
my
&gt; own ISP, for which traceroute tells me I'm looking at about 200ms over
only
&gt; 5 hops! Of these only the first 3 are the same node. Is my ignorance
leading
&gt; me to a mistaken conclusion to think that the problem probably lies
&gt; somewhere amongst those 3 nodes (not including my own machine, that is).
&gt;
&gt; 2a) Am I merely naive to shun my ISP's suggestion that I should simply
&gt; remove all my modem setups (in Win95) and reinstall my modem to resolve
this
&gt; (and any other that I happen to be experiencing at the time) problem? What
&gt; are the chances that I actually -am- having modem/driver problems
&gt; (considering that most of the time, things go pretty smoothly, and that
&gt; given enough time, the problems described above do clear themselves up
&gt; without requiring any intervention - i.e. not hanging up and dialling back
&gt; in, etc.). How would I identify that such problems did in fact exist?
&gt;
&gt; 3) Should I just abandon this ISP (or is this as good as the Internet gets
&gt; in Australia for us lowly dial-uppers)? Or, if indeed, I believe they are
&gt; providing a poor quality of service, should I bother trying to get them to
&gt; understand that (let alone -do- anything about it!).
&gt;
&gt; Your comments and suggestions are extremely welcome.
&gt;
&gt;
