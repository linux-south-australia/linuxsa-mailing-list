You need to *remove* the GATEWAY address in the /etc/sysconfig/networks
file. Unless you have a really large LAN that has more than 1 class C
network and you need to talk to people in a different subnet on that LAN,
you do not need the default route.

The problem you are having is due to the Linux Kernel _not_ removing the
default route when you try to add a new one. To see if it is going to
work. Before you log on to the net, try:

localhost:~ # route del default

If this works, and the problem is not there, change the
/etc/sysconfig/networks file to read (on these two lines):

GATEWAY=
GATEWAYDEV=

And then bring down your eth0 device:

localhost:~ # ifconfig eth0 down

and bring it up again:

localhost:~ # ifconfig eth0 up

and check your routing table with:

localhost:~ # route -n

You should only have an entry for the loopback device (127.0.0.1) and your
eth0 device (can't remember what IP you had for that, was it 10.0.0.1?)

If all that doesn't work, then e-mailme privately off-list to
<A HREF="mailto:darryl@bachblue.com.au">darryl@bachblue.com.au</A> and I'll organise a time to catch up with you and
see what I can do to solve the problem.

Cheers
