Quoting Luke Vanderfluit &lt;<A HREF="mailto:luke@chipcity.com.au">luke@chipcity.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I've tried to get debian 3, suse 8 now there's mandrake 9 and RH8
&gt; 
&gt; I've had no luck getting any of those (debian and suse) through this group.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me we need a (or at least one) central point of distribution, 
&gt; where subscribers to this group can get their copies. 
&gt; 
&gt; I can buy  debian 3 (7 cds), mandrake 9 (3 cds) and RH 8 (6 cds) at 
&gt; lankum.com for $90 (the lot). I think I might do that.
&gt; 
&gt; If I did go ahead and buy those would anyone be interested in getting copies
&gt; of these sets? (say $10 excluding postage)

Why not buy your Linux from the distributors themselves?  That way they get 
money.  That way more software gets written.  All of Red Hat, Mandrake and SuSE 
employ free software hackers, so buying software from them is good.  Debian 
takes donations as well I believe (but I'm not sure).

Support the people who write the software - it's a touch economic climate I 
know, but if we want &lt;insert your favourite distro here&gt; to survive, you should 
send money their way.  Free software is not just about free beer, but about 
freedom as well.

And I'm not taking a swipe at you in particular Luke, but using this as a 
chance to get up on my soapbox :)
