hmmm...

I was one or two steps removed from the relationship with airnet. I
contracted to my client, who was contracted to their client, who used
airnet, but had no technical knowhow. I only heard about the problems,
not the explanations or solutions...

ahh well...

&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; I thought most folks had heard about the horrible time subscribers were 
&gt; having trying to get connected. Sometimes I had to ring in 20 times to 
&gt; get through to the network, and it would come back saying invalid or 
&gt; something like that, but actually never even getting into the AirNet 
&gt; equipment, just kicked off by the Telstra gear (a Network Terminal Unit 
&gt; I think it is called). Other times we would be bounced off for no 
&gt; apparent reason, 1 minute, 10 minute, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, wham 
&gt; bamm, you're off this line!
&gt; 
&gt; It all added money to Telstra so they didn't seem to be too perturbed 
&gt; by the problem, or so it seemed to those affected by it.
&gt; 
&gt; I spoke to Colvin a couple of times and he said had a torrid time 
&gt; trying to get the PTB to firstly listen to him and then to accept that 
&gt; it was Telstra's problem not AirNet. He told me that their boardroom 
&gt; looked more like a war room than a business place &lt;G&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; As soon as I get the chance to work through months of bills for the 6 
&gt; accounts I intend to be asking Telstra for some relief from the charges 
&gt; for these useless calls. Apparently AirNet and other subscribers are 
&gt; going to try to get some recompense off them too.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
&gt;
