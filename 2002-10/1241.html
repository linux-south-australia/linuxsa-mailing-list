Quoting Dan Shearer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dan@tellurian.com.au">dan@tellurian.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; Does anyone have a reasonably credible number for how many Unix
&gt; applications exist? Some notion of what an application is would be useful
&gt; too. 
&gt; 
&gt; Freshmeat is one starting point, and has 25k projects of all sorts (which
&gt; includes GPL Windows programs and all sorts of non-Unix stuff.) CPAN has a
&gt; huge number of modules (anyone ever counted? And when is a module an
&gt; application?) There's several overlapping collections of Linux
&gt; applications, which by and large are also Unix applications. Some of these
&gt; have stats pages, some don't. There are some Sun application databases.
&gt; Etc etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So, anyone tried doing this before, or seen a URL where someone else
&gt; already has?

As a rough order of magnitude, the combination of sf.net, savannah.gnu.org and 
freshmeat.net is probably a very good start.  Sure there's some (significant?) 
overlap, but there's plenty also not covered by these 3 sites - probably evens 
itself out in the end.

You could also throw in KDE, GNOME, tigris.org, etc etc etc but really these 
are down in the noise.  Including CPAN and the "Valuts of Parnassus" is 
probably making life difficult for your definition of an "application".  How 
about generic C programs that will compile anywhere?  Does "CLIPS" count as a 
unix application?  What about "Film GIMP"?  Is that a separate application 
to "GIMP"?  How about the billion TCL/ksh/sh/awk/sed scripts out there?  Good 
luck with your definition of "application"! :P

What about licensing?  Are you are talking about just oss/fs/pd unix-ish 
applications and not proprietry licensed ones?  Shareware?  Is M$ Windows a 
unix application because I can get the source code (shared source licence etc) 
and compile it up under unix?

Unforunately I don't know of a centralised repository or directory that is 
broader in scope than freshmeat.net

I haven't helped with this email, right?
