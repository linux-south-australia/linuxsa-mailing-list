Hi.

Actually, if I read your message correctly:

1. You want to build and run a linux box headless and communicate with it
using telnet from your OS9 Mac via cross over cable.

2. You want to develop DB and PHP based webpages on the linux box for
testing before uploading to the net.

It will work well if you have your head around the networking issues and
the clients on the Mac. You could even edit the html and php on your mac
and submit them to your linux box over the crossover cable with little
effort. I'd suggest Transmit (for ftp) and niftytelnet for ssh/telnet.

I'd definitely be looking for some extra memory for the PC, but otherwise
it will run fine. I have a P150 doing exactly what you are thinking of and
more and it is sweet. 

In fact with a bit more memory, you could give the dialup role to the
linux box and get firewalling and ip-masquerade and even perhaps a mail
server as a bonus.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; 
&gt; that's the webmail service I'm using, for some reason the 
&gt; text-wrapping is really weird.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Most computers. It can fit on your hard drive but I don't think you'd 
&gt; &gt; easily be able to get XFree86 + Gnome or XFree86 + KDE to 
&gt; &gt; behave itself too well on that system.
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment I'm not looking to get a Window Manager for it, just 
&gt; be able to run the three aforementioned apps so I can test my PHP 
&gt; pages before uploading them (At present I have to upload them 
&gt; and then check for errors as I only have Mac OS 9.x installed and 
&gt; can't get PHP for it.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, that does remind me, does anyone know the limitations of 
&gt; using those programs through telnet? I'll be borrowing a monitor 
&gt; for the installation, but if I can get away with not buying one for it in 
&gt; the short-term, I'll be happier (My computer budget extends to 
&gt; buying new ink cartridges and paper for my printer).
