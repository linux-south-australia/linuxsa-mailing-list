DCD,

[ Do you happen to have a name other than DCD? I know we've talked in
person but I don't want to embarass myself by calling you the "wrong"
name ;-P ]

&gt;     If the site is still available to us it's on a server that uses
&gt; mysql. But I can't confirm this until early next week. but certainly in
&gt; time for your proposed BBQ.

Good.

&gt;     There seems to be a fairly good response to this concept, and a side
&gt; issue, but still quite important of supporting the distro's financially,
&gt; For my $0.02 I could see those involved charging an extra fee, say $1
&gt; per cd or transfer, and putting this into a fund for the appropriate
&gt; distro eg. fee's raised from burning mandrake cd's used to maintain at
&gt; least a mandrake club membership, so that linuxsa was seen to be
&gt; contributing to the opensource community internationally.

Good idea, I'll make sure we have an opportunity to raise it at the BBQ
next week.

&gt; This would also mean that on a regular basis Service members would
&gt; report in how many they had distributed that month and deposit funds
&gt; appropriately. On an Honor basis of course. It would also give us an
&gt; idea of the numbers and popularity of distro's across adelaide.

We could even automate this with a sort of ordering system.

Take a look at:

* <A HREF="http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/osdn/">http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/osdn/</A>

...it's a preliminary site and you could probably do a better design
than me. I've just put that together so that we have something to "look
at" and "work on". The name links are all "false" e-mail addresses at
the moment because I may have dobbed someone in. In time I'll develop
something that will make the "Current Distributors" dynamic and add more
features. We need, though, to start somewhere.
