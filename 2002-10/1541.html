&gt; Why is UDP less secure and how does UDP differ from TCP?

"Less secure" is probably not the exact phrase for it, but it
is much easier to forge UDP traffic than it is for TCP.  TCP
require the completion of a "3 way handshake" before delivering
data to the application, and in that three way handshake "secrets"
are exchanged in order to complete that exchange (on some systems
guessing the secret is trivial - nmap has a report stating "trivial
joke", which usually comes back when scanning network devices like
printer servers).  UDP, being a simple, stateless transport protocol,
delivers the data immediately to the application to process without
requiring that set up phase (the data itself may contain
authentication information, however).

Being trivial to forge, you could easily set the following events
in motion.  Let's say Mike's just set up NTP on his mail host.
Let's ignore the fact that he's just published his ntp.conf, but
we know he's running ntp.  It's easy enough to determine the IP
address of his mail host, and there's only a small number of NTP
servers in Australia that he can query anonymously off the net.
He can't firewall effectively, because he *must* be able to
communicate with the 'net accessible server.  If we inject packets
into the network[1] with the destination set to his NTP client
(/server), the source set to the publicly accessable NTP server,
and some mischief data that when read by Mike's NTP client causes
it to explode, then it's game over.

Note that it would probably more difficult to fool with Mike's
clock, as I believe that there's some bidirectional exchange of
info (although I could be wrong - been a while since I've looked
at NTP traffic).  The thing is, while it's easy to inject data
with forged addresses, getting the data back to your machine is
a lot more difficult.

&gt; Universal Datagram Protocol (?) is very different? 

User Datagram Protocol.

&gt; Forgive my ignorance here if I am right off - but I would
&gt; like to know how UDP is less secure and why UDP is used over other protocols
&gt; at times..

It's a different class of protocol.  TCP has a higer overhead in
setup and teardown costs, UDP's stateless nature makes it more
ideal for stuff like DNS and NFS.  Different horses for different
courses.


[1]  Presuming that we can - some networks drop such martian packets.
