You're dead right.... I had a play with ettercap

&lt;<A HREF="http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/&gt">http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/&gt</A>;

On the lan here, which has about 30 machines, through 3x24 port
switches, turned on the arp poisoning option, and it worked perfectly.
Before long I had more passwords than I could poke a stick at, of
multiple protocols, and was even watching in on peoples SSH connections
[1] etc etc...

Unfortunatly I slowed the whole lan down as my pc had trouble shuffling,
proceesing and decrypting that many packets, and when I turned it off I
discovered that unixware was too dumb to work out what had happened and
I had to go and manually flush the arp tables. But It was quite
supprising just how easy it was to collect so many passwords even on a
switched lan! Ettercap also has the feature of looking for other arp
poisoners, so that if you suspect a user is doing this you can find 'em.

Ant

[1] Im the sys admin, Im allowed to do this :) It was a security
assesment. Also this was SSH 1, SSH 2 is secure, I belive, at the
moment.
