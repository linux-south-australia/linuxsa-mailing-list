I have a pile of old ones as well.  Mandrake 8.2 and 8.1 if anybody wants
old ones (why i can't imagine).  i've got more but David Lloyd covered most
of mine.

I"m in LONSDALE.

I wouldn't mind an ice coffees (FUIC* of course) for the favour plus
replacement blanks.

*Farmers Union Ice Coffee.  The ONLY ice coffee.  Any size over 600Ml is
legal tender.  :)

O.K.
    I hadn't thought of old distro's
I'd be willing to be a Northern distributor, only I don't yet have
Bandwidth. But, I could pick up a copy from one of those with bandwidth.
I do, I'll have to confirm this, have access to a subdomain for the page
and I have the time and ability to  do the page if we get this far. On
an Aussie server, free.
I do have a collection of cd's, I'm a bit of a hoarder, going back I
think to RedHat 4.3 and whatever debian and slackware were at the time.
Mainly focussed on Redhat and Mandrake.

Like DSL I would be interested in enough to cover the disks, I would
need to set up transfer facillities ie I don't have a network yet. I do
now have an old box I'm about to set up.

&gt;I have decided that we should setup a number of "access points" for "big
&gt;downloads" all over Adelaide. These access points would be real people
&gt;who just happen to want to donate a little bit of time helping others. I
&gt;am going to see if anyone will sponsor a web-page for me so that it's
&gt;easy to:
&gt;
&gt;a) advertise what you have if you are an access point
&gt;b) put down prices and rules and such
&gt;
&gt;This is sort of like "Napster" but we're shunting data by ethernet or by
&gt;CD's.
