&gt;&gt; It looks like we've dropped the ball for this month's AUUGN.  We were
&gt;&gt; supposed to include CD 1 of Debian Woody, but something went wrong,
&gt;&gt; and now we're looking to make CD-Rs instead.  The problem is that we
&gt;&gt; don't have an original.  Can somebody in Adelaide lend us one?
&gt;
&gt; There's an ISO at <A HREF="ftp://mirror.sa.internode.on.net/pub/debian-cd/">ftp://mirror.sa.internode.on.net/pub/debian-cd/</A>
&gt; and I can leech it down if necessary.  Takes about 5 hours on my
&gt; connection, and I could start it now.  Internode don't charge me for
&gt; downloads from this mirror (which also carried the BSD 7.0 release
&gt; within hours of its being available, btw).


Thanks, I've located one.  In fact, I've located at least three.
Duncan Sayers was the lucky winner, first because he was the first to
answer, and then because he's also the closest to me.  I'm really
impressed with the fast feedback from everybody.  Thanks.

Greg
