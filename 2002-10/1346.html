&gt; No, Linux is not inherently secure,
&gt; just as Windows is not inherently insecure.  Both depend on how well they

&gt; advantage that you can reasonably expect to be able to view the source
&gt; of all programs running on it, whereas with Windows that expectation is
&gt; generally not available.  So with Linux you could satisfy yourself that
&gt; it was secure, but with Windows you just have to hope.

Now we are getting closer.

I believe that Windows in all its versions is not a hacker proof OS, in 
fact I believe that the holes that have been identified make the Windows OS 
an easy hacker target.

The other contributors were saying that the only reason Linux was seen to 
be secure was that hackers could not be bothered to try hacking it. 

&lt;&lt; So you haven't read Cuckoo's Egg then ;-)
Its only "secure" because its not worth anyone's time hacking it &gt;&gt;

I don't hold to that opinion but I was hoping the experienced users on this 
list could either support or disprove my belief. I think there are two 
parts to reply to that statement.

1) Linux is so much more secure than Windows that it is going to take a 
much more concerted effort to break past the protections (so long as the 
user is not logged in as root).

2) Linux is used in a great many systems in corporates, education and 
government. In many cases it would be worth the attention of a hacker if 
they wanted to. The statement above presupposes that Linux is not used on 
any "worthwhile" systems. I reject that generalisation.

Cheers,  Ian
