&gt; &gt; Which descendent builds on ARM? Wince isn't a descendent of NT or even
&gt; &gt; close, but it is somewhat portable.

&gt; I believe the latest PocketPC has some heritage from desktop OSs.  But
&gt; that's only from some web site somewhere.  Could be wrong.

I have been looking at the PocketPC Platform for work and my reading says that 
PocketPC (aka WinCE errr 3??) was a system that was built from the ground up 
and had win32 compatibility added to it (quite early on though), and thus 
actually operates quite differently from regular windows.  

They do have a product you might be thinking of called WinXP embedded edition, 
the one mentioned in the DOJ court case.  It is a modularised and stripped 
down WinXP and is designed for ATM's (bank ones),POS terminals, pokie 
machines and set top boxes.  It would be counted as a full windows and I 
believe can be deployed on ARM platforms (but that is getting out of my 
knowledge domain).
