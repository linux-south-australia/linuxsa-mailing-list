&gt;&gt;Although the point I was trying to make was that there's a lot of (CLI) 
&gt;&gt;software out that could be classified as a unix-ish application or not.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If it builds and runs on Unix I was thinking of saying it is a Unix app.
&gt; Even it is dreadful code that once came from VMS/NT/USCD
&gt; p-system/whatever.

I have Intergraph's 4 CD set, and that is just their core stuff, if you
include all their other stuff then I think it runs to over thirty CD's.
But it was all made for their proprietry RISC hardware so does this
count? They have ported a _lot_ of it to NT etc and are currently
having a big bun fight with Intel re parallel processing. It seems
like a big ask, I wish you luck.


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;[Aside: Who knows if the Win2K kernel is cross platform?  Remember that a 
&gt;&gt;predecessor built on alpha and mips, and that a descendant builds on ARM :) ]
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Which descendent builds on ARM? Wince isn't a descendent of NT or even
&gt; close, but it is somewhat portable.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't dispute that the 2K kernel is cross platform (hardware), but I do
&gt; dispute that this means it can necessarily be compiled on other than an M$
&gt; software platform. Maybe it is and they are keeping it secret, but the
&gt; first does not imply the second.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Things like Google are vertical niche applications that aren't for sale - I 
&gt;&gt;don't believe there are lists of such things.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Google are only too pleased to sell their application for large company
&gt; intranets. They even sell hardware to go with it painted a pretty gold
&gt; colour. Same thing for FAST ASA's FreeBSD search engine.
