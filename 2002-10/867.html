It has nothing if very little to do with ISPs - there is something very
wrong up stream somewhere and a few of us would like to know where..  The
lovable Alston has said nothing despite several letters over the years.
There is a lot of ISP bashing and counter bashing - but little critical
analysis of where the problem actually is.

Is Australia being rorted by the USA like Hollywood rorted Foxtel and cinema
houses?

Another case in point!!!  We all complain about the cost of films - hence
why many cinema houses are bankrupt if not close too - how they get money
through over priced half full jaffa packets - but it has little to do with
them.  The problem is 'upstream' - where the 'packets' originate - which is
Hollywood itself.  Or film distributors are not helping - I don't know..

&gt; Quoting <A HREF="mailto:davidn@rebel.net.au">davidn@rebel.net.au</A>:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their 
&gt; advertisement
&gt; &gt; &gt; when they mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I 
&gt; said before,
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's unfortunate that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term
&gt; &gt; &gt; for this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ah but there *is* a widely accepted shorthand term.  
&gt; "Download" is widely
&gt; &gt; understood to mean "data from the ISP to the customer."
&gt; 
&gt; To those who know what download means, yes. To the user who 
&gt; clicks "download" 
&gt; in IE, no.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's 
&gt; something wrong.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Look, it's really quite simple.  People are NOT stupid and 
&gt; neither are
&gt; &gt; they guileless.  Some consumers will try anything to avoid 
&gt; paying for what
&gt; &gt; they bought.  They know that when they sign up to an ISP 
&gt; the product is
&gt; &gt; stuff delivered from the Internet.  To try to claim a 
&gt; mistunderstanding,
&gt; &gt; that they genuinely thought web pages, or email, or ICQ, or 
&gt; such, was for
&gt; &gt; free is just plain guile.  Darn, already used guile, must 
&gt; buy a thesaurus.
&gt; &gt; It's duplicit, artful, dishonest, deceitful, tricky, 
&gt; chicanery.  It's
&gt; &gt; almost fraudulent.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, this is true, but it doesn't discount genuine cases of ignorance.
&gt; 
&gt; Users trying to suck money out of ISPs because they can't 
&gt; read T&C's is bad. 
&gt; ISPs making it clear (which they already might) about what 
&gt; the user is doing in 
&gt; their primary advertisements is good.
&gt; 
&gt; My beef was with the attitude that a user shouldn't have to 
&gt; contact their geek 
&gt; friend in order to buy an internet connection, not that 
&gt; getting compensation 
&gt; out of the ISP is a good idea.
