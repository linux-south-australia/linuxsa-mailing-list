Mike's original message was:

&gt;&gt;&gt; And remember, the gaming industry industry had a huge role on in pushing 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the envelope for desktop hardware. Game requirments drive hardware 
&gt;&gt;&gt; developers to create faster, more powerful everythings (CPU's, memory, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; GFX cards, networking equipment, etc, etc).

I wrote:

&gt;&gt; Horse hockey.  Games may have had *some* influence (e.g. in graphics, but
&gt;&gt; what about the influence of photo editing on printers?), but what game
&gt;&gt; requires gigabit ethernet?  Technology is following the curve of Moore's
&gt;&gt; Law long before games were an influencing factor.

Mike wrote:

&gt; But seriously, you're saying that I can buy an Athlon XP 2400, 1/2 Gig
&gt; of 333Mhz DDR ram and a 40G HDD for just over $1000 because some GD's
&gt; like Photoshop running nice and fast.

No, I'm saying the technology curve has followed Moore's Law (with some
revision of ML).  Nothing was mentioned in your original email about the
economics of PC hardware, unless that's what you meant by "pushing the
envelope."

&gt; Gamers are the mass of people responsible for the fantatsic yield that
&gt; PC harware manufacturers get for high-end components.

Or yields.  I was commenting on your original statement; you seem to have
broadened its scope somewhat.
