Anti-spammer wins court case
Caitlin Fitzsimmons
OCTOBER 14, 2002 THE Australian court system upheld the right of internet
activists to campaign against junk email in a landmark decision today.

The District Court of Western Australia dismissed the lawsuit by Perth-based
direct marketing firm T3 Direct against anti-spam activist Joey McNicol,
describing it as "speculative and based on propositions (the plaintiff) knew
to be incorrect".

The Which Company, trading as T3 Direct, had sued Mr McNicol for allegedly
getting the company black-listed on anti-spam website SPEWS.org
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.spews.org&gt">http://www.spews.org&gt</A>;

SPEWS - or the Spam Prevention Early Warning System - publishes a list of
internet protocol (IP) addresses believed to be used for unsolicited bulk
email or spam. Network administrators and internet service providers (ISPs)
can refer to the SPEWS list to block traffic from the black-listed IP
addresses on their networks.

T3 claimed the action cost at least $82,000 in lost income and the cost of
repairing its computer systems. Mr McNicol denied contacting SPEWS and
argued that nothing he did or was accused of doing was illegal and today the
court granted Mr McNicol's application for summary judgment. 

The court found that T3 offered neither proof that Mr McNicol had contacted
SPEWS nor that doing so was illegal.

The court rejected T3's claim that such a complaint to SPEWS was
"unfounded", noting that T3 had elsewhere admitted to sending unsolicited
advertising emails.
