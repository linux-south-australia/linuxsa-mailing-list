Hi.

Mine is using Redat 6.2. It didn't start as my headless server, it used to
be my desktop but when I built a new one I couldn't bring myself to kill
it, so it went down to the basement...

Which Distribution is a good question, and can spark off some heated
discussion on linuxsa. I think that if you can hunt down some more memory,
it doesn't matter much - you will be only loading core components, and any
of the big three (RedHat, Mandrake, Debian) will fit the bill. 

Without the extra memory, things might get interesting - I don't know for
sure, but I doubt that the current RedHat and Mandrake will install with
8mb ram. What you need is the distribution with the leanest memory and
disk footprint of install and operation, but I don't _know_ which that is.

I _suspect_ the answer may be Debian. Debian certainly has a lean install.
Others on this list may be more specific, and some time on the web will
help inform your decision.

Network issues for a Mac user?

Mac users don't usually have to spend much time futzing with the network -
it just works. Having a local TCP/IP network will challenge that status.

* Setting and using up a TCP/IP network.

* Lack of multihoming in OS9. - There is only one 'active' TCP/IP
configuration available. You can get around this by using a local
linux box as your internet gateway.

Someone else already suggested versiontracker for niftytelnet.

If you do decide to use the linuxbox as your gateway, you should switch
your linuxbox access from telnet to ssh for security reasons. (I'd do that
anyway)

Regards,

Michael

&gt; 
&gt; What distro are you using? I am reletively new to linux (I've used 
&gt; RedHat on Virtual PC 3.0) and probably need all the help I can get 
&gt; in setting it up. 
&gt; 
&gt; a) what are the network issues you mentioned?
&gt; 
&gt; b) I use Transmit and Interarchy for FTP but where can I get 
&gt; niftytelnet?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Actually, if I read your message correctly:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. You want to build and run a linux box headless and 
&gt; communicate 
&gt; &gt; with it
&gt; &gt; using telnet from your OS9 Mac via cross over cable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. You want to develop DB and PHP based webpages on the 
&gt; linux box for
&gt; &gt; testing before uploading to the net.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It will work well if you have your head around the networking 
&gt; &gt; issues and
&gt; &gt; the clients on the Mac. You could even edit the html and php on 
&gt; &gt; your mac
&gt; &gt; and submit them to your linux box over the crossover cable with 
&gt; little
&gt; &gt; effort. I'd suggest Transmit (for ftp) and niftytelnet for ssh/telnet.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd definitely be looking for some extra memory for the PC, but 
&gt; &gt; otherwiseit will run fine. I have a P150 doing exactly what you are 
&gt; &gt; thinking of and
&gt; &gt; more and it is sweet. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In fact with a bit more memory, you could give the dialup role to 
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; linux box and get firewalling and ip-masquerade and even 
&gt; perhaps a 
&gt; &gt; mailserver as a bonus.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's gramatically correct, but the formatting is really weird.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's the webmail service I'm using, for some reason the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; text-wrapping is really weird.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most computers. It can fit on your hard drive but I don't think 
&gt; &gt; you'd 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easily be able to get XFree86 + Gnome or XFree86 + KDE to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behave itself too well on that system.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; At the moment I'm not looking to get a Window Manager for it, 
&gt; &gt; just 
&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to run the three aforementioned apps so I can test my 
&gt; PHP 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pages before uploading them (At present I have to upload 
&gt; them 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then check for errors as I only have Mac OS 9.x installed 
&gt; and 
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't get PHP for it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, that does remind me, does anyone know the limitations 
&gt; of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; using those programs through telnet? I'll be borrowing a 
&gt; monitor 
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the installation, but if I can get away with not buying one 
&gt; &gt; for it in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the short-term, I'll be happier (My computer budget extends to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; buying new ink cartridges and paper for my printer).
