I want you to be able to work it out.  That's the point of it.  As
to cut and paste, it was a closed computer exam! :-)

&gt; I'd think twice about applying for a place that wanted me to sit some
&gt; little "exam" for a job!

I'd have felt the same way at one stage, but I've since seen too many
people in the industry, who give great interview and come with impressive
resumes, yet are hopeless at their job.  We've got so many charlatans
waving MCSE's (and soon, no doubt, RHCE's) that you just can't take their
word for it.  When I employ I need somebody great, and I only know of one
reliable way to tell if they are that person.  I figure, when I employ
someone it's going to be a long-term relationship.  If their "scared off"
by an exam then that's great.  Why should we waste each other's time?

Again, thanks for your thoughts.
