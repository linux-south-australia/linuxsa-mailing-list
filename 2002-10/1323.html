Helpful reply.

I take you point that availability of Java2 JVMs/JITs is improving. It is
reasonable to expect that if I do the same thing 12 months from now I
won't have as severe problems.

Right now, though, people doing either big business things on Linux (s390,
PPC64, Alpha) or small business things (ARM, MIPS, SH and plenty more)
haven't got good options. There are a lot of companies in both areas. I
don't know if PDAs and phones are esoteric architectures, maybe they are
because they aren't i386. But there's an awful lot of them.

&gt; I agree it sucks that there is no 100% useful free Java2 implementation, 
&gt; but I think the lack of good JVMs for some of the more esoteric Linux 
&gt; arch's is not because of Suns (terrible) licensing, but because of the 
&gt; sheer complexity and size of actually writing it. 

Aren't these related? Getting critical mass seems to be hard, and that may
well be because so many people have problems with the licensing.

&gt; The JVM is complex, the API is huge, and getting good performance
&gt; requires a good JIT like HotSpot which makes the JVM look like a walk
&gt; in the park.

I don't know very much about what it takes to port a JVM. It seems to
involve a considerable amount of low-level hardware architecture-specific
system work, more than I would have expected for a userspace application
that does user interface stuff, disc and network I/O, and simulation. Is
it just performance that requires assembler, or what?
