He said that he needed to buy a machine that he would feel safe giving 
to his mom.

He is the kind of guy that drives below the speed limit, wears a 
motorcycle helmet and has a roll cage around his car.

:-D


JK,  I actually don't know the real answer, that's just what he had. 
Maybe the Dell shipped with it.

&gt;Why use ECC RAM?  I quote it up by standard for clients - and it is
&gt;*significantly* more expensive (or maybe that is also because it is
&gt;"registered" and somehow supported).  I can see why it is important for
&gt;mission critical applications - obviously - but are desktop users at a loss
&gt;because RAM is not ECC?  I am not sure if errors occur at random and this
&gt;can lead to data corruption over time?  I've never had a problem that I can
&gt;detect with errors in RAM - it's always seemed quite reliable to me (unless
&gt;some problems I have had are due to RAM errors but it did not appear that
&gt;way).

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a coworker that owns a pentium iv Dell at home with a dual rim. 
&gt;&gt;&gt;It came with 128 MB RDRAM x2 and AFAWK it should work in pairs. He 
&gt;&gt;&gt;recently ordered some  256 MB RD RAM to add to the two additional open 
&gt;&gt;&gt;slots, the only difference being the 128 v 256 MB and the fact that one 
&gt;&gt;&gt;set of chips  are ECC while the others are not. He did buy Dell RAM
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;chips.
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;It didn't seem to work after the chips were installed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;does it work with only the 2 new 256Mb ones?
&gt;&gt;you should be able to have 2x128 and 2x256
&gt;&gt;I don't think you can mix ECC and non-ECC though
&gt;&gt;(ECC is error correcting BTW, generally good to have
&gt;&gt;but costs a fair bit more than non-ECC).
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yep, also:
&gt;
&gt;Try putting the 128's where the 256's are, and vice versa.
&gt;or
&gt;Boot with 2x128's into the BIOS and try turning off any options that
&gt;relate to ECC.
&gt;
&gt;Long shot, but you never know.
