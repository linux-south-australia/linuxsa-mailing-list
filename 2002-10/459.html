Hi All,
    I have done some more investigation into this problem by
setting logs to debug and seeing what comes out. This has
solved part of the problem. I can now "see" the correct
pages if I do a lookup by IP address (ie
<A HREF="http://203.myIP.193">http://203.myIP.193</A>), but I still have the problem of domain
names not working (ie <A HREF="http://www.mysite">http://www.mysite</A> returns an error -
"(98) Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to
port 80"). This occurs for my server and the virtual host.
As far as I know, DNS is working fine as nothing else seems
to be broken on my server (ie mail works ok). This was also
working fine before I tried to set up Apache. I think this
is an Apache thing, but I cannot see where in the http.conf
file it is to fix it. Any suggestions?
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; could it be to do with the ServerName and ServerPath
directives?
&gt;
&gt; I have virtual hosting setup and it works with it laid out
like;
&gt;      &lt;VirtualHost 150.101.236.172&gt;
&gt;      ServerName nick.sond.com.au
&gt;      ServerPath /nick
&gt;      DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs/nick
&gt;      ErrorLog logs/nick.sond.error.log
&gt;      CustomLog logs/nick.sond.access.log combined
&gt;      &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&gt;
&gt;      &lt;VirtualHost 150.101.236.172&gt;
&gt;      ServerName sond.com.au
&gt;      ServerPath /sond
&gt;      DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs/sond
&gt;      ErrorLog logs/sond.error.log
&gt;      CustomLog logs/sond.access.log combined
&gt;      &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&gt;
&gt; but evidently, it isnt using an IP alias

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;     I am having a problem getting a website working on a
&gt; &gt; server. I have RTFMed, and this has shed no light on the
&gt; &gt; problem and since this is the first time I have tried to
set
&gt; &gt; up Apache, I need a little help. Basically the problem
goes
&gt; &gt; like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I have set up an IP alias on my system and given it
the
&gt; &gt; IP address I want to use for this web site (ie. my
server is
&gt; &gt; 203.myIP.193 on eth0:0, and the alias is 203.myIP.250 on
&gt; &gt; eth0:1). These are correct, visible and pingable etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I have set up DNS with my name servers for this IP
&gt; &gt; address and delegated the new domain and it is visible
on
&gt; &gt; the net (ie www.mydomain and www.mynewdomain are visible
&gt; &gt; using DNS diagnostic tools Telstra provide with their
DNS
&gt; &gt; services).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a series of web pages set up and they are live on
the
&gt; &gt; net (ie I can get people outside my network to see
them).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     This is where the problem starts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I type in www.mydomain I get:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bad Gateway
&gt; &gt; The following error occurred:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A DNS lookup error occurred. The host was not found.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note: This was working before I started this project.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I type in www.mynewdomain I get:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bad Gateway
&gt; &gt; The following error occurred:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A DNS lookup error occurred. The host was not found.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note: This is what I want to get working.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.193">http://203.myIP.193</A> I get the index page
for my
&gt; &gt; site www.mydomain
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250">http://203.myIP.250</A> I get the index page
for my
&gt; &gt; site www.mydomain
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But here is another weird part -
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The new web site hangs off the default html directory
(which
&gt; &gt; is /var/www/html/) in a sub-directory that is visible by
&gt; &gt; typing in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.193/subdir/index.html">http://203.myIP.193/subdir/index.html</A> (as you
&gt; &gt; would expect).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250/index.html">http://203.myIP.250/index.html</A> I get the
index
&gt; &gt; page for my site www.mynewdomain , which is in
&gt; &gt; /var/www/html/subdir/index.html.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here are the two things that are puzzling me:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.Why does Apache think DNS isn't working when I can get
it
&gt; &gt; to work manually using the normal tools (ping, nslookup,
&gt; &gt; whois)? BTW my mail and everything else on the server
isn't
&gt; &gt; broken.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. Why does <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250">http://203.myIP.250</A> get the index page of
the
&gt; &gt; default html directory just like <A HREF="http://203.myIP.193">http://203.myIP.193</A> (my
&gt; &gt; server and this is the behaviour I would expect) but if
I
&gt; &gt; type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250/index.html">http://203.myIP.250/index.html</A> gets the index
page
&gt; &gt; to the new website, which is hanging off the default
html
&gt; &gt; directory in a sub-directory? Logically these two pages
are
&gt; &gt; the same since the default html file is
&gt; &gt; /var/www/html/index.html.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; O.K. here are a few diagnostic tidbits.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The server runs RH7.0 and Apache 1.3.13
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The logs are a bit hard to interpret, but seem fine
&gt; &gt; (access_log and error_log and newaccess_log
newerror_log)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; httpd.conf
&gt; &gt; Has HostNameLookups On, but this doesn't seem to make
any
&gt; &gt; difference if it is Off
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has two Virtual hosts set up
&gt; &gt; NameVirtualHost 203.myIP.193
&gt; &gt; NameVirtualHost 203.myIP.250
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &lt;VirtualHost 203.myIP.193&gt;
&gt; &gt;   ServerName www.mydomain
&gt; &gt;   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
&gt; &gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;VirtualHost 203.myIP.250&gt;
&gt; &gt;   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/subdir/
&gt; &gt;   ServerName www.mynewdomain
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   ErrorLog logs/newerror_log
&gt; &gt;   CustomLog logs/newaccess_log common
&gt; &gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     What I want in the end to be able to do is type in
&gt; &gt; www.mydomain and get the index page for mydomain and
type in
&gt; &gt; www.mynewdomain and get the index page for mynewdomain.
This
&gt; &gt; has been annoying me for over a week now, and I am sure
that
&gt; &gt; it is a simple problem to fix, but my limited experience
&gt; &gt; with Apache is probably blinding me to the answer. If
anyone
&gt; &gt; could assist that would be most appreciated as I needed
to
&gt; &gt; get this site working a couple of weeks ago and it still
&gt; &gt; isn't. Thanks in advance.
&gt; &gt;     Cheers!
&gt; &gt;         Andrew.
