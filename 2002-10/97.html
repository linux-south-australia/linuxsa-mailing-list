Quoting Anthony Symons &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ant@sa.pracom.com.au">ant@sa.pracom.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; * the gnome 2 the panel defaulted to the top of the screen. This just
&gt; irked me for some reason, and I still havn't figured how to shift it to
&gt; the bottom. All the help says "you can move panels like this... except
&gt; the main one" or words to that effect. I also couldn't find a setting in
&gt; ~/.gnome* anywhere for it. By the end of the night I was getting used to
&gt; it though, and Im sure with a bit of research it'll be possible.

I haven't seem M9, so I'm not sure what local customisations they've done to 
Gnome 2, but typical installs have a "Menu Panel" by default, which can only be 
at the top of the screen (This is the one with 'Applications' and 'Actions' on 
it)  Another distinguishing factor is Mac-like rounded corners.

You can't move this one, but you don't have to keep it either.  You can delete 
it (right click on panel, select 'Delete this panel...'), but before doing that 
you may like to first create an 'Edge panel' (or corner, or sliding, or 
floating) which can be moved to other edges (you can do this by right clicking 
on a panel, selecting 'Create Panel' and then choosing the panel you want).

HTH,
