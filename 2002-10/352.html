Hi Colvin,
    Thankyou for being so forthright about the situation. I hope you 
succeed, as I imagine many do, in your legal endevours with Telstra.
    Unfortunately it seems every week we hear of one business or another 
that has been disadvantaged by Telstra policies or practices. I went 
down with a friend to sign him up with one of our local ISP's and we 
ended up with a long, actually far to long, a list of the problems this 
ISP had experienced over the last few years. All of which were and I 
quote "Helstra" related.

Interestingly enough the reason we went down in the first place is that 
my friend rang Telstra to get an internet connection and asked them 
about setting it up in linux. He actually meant what settings were 
required etc. not only was he told that it wasn't supported, apparently 
they now have an automated but winblows only system that does the set 
up, but the person laughed at him and told him his low end pentium 
wasn't capable of browsing the net.

No he doesn't, there's nothing artificial about MS stupidity.

&gt;&gt;Might I gently suggest that your e-mail to open source lists be in text? 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Yeah, sorry about that. Good old 'artificial intelligence' in MS products.
