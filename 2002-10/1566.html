I was thinking of something even more simple - a old monochrome monitor
rigged up to a diskless machine running in text mode - that would be the
'controller' and 'player' for the Ogg Vorbis library that would reside on a
large hard disk on a machine somewhere else - that could use IceCast (?) to
'stream' the music across the LAN.

And if that's too complicated still - the diskless client would not play the
music - just control the play list - and the sound would go over a normal
RCA cable through the house from the music 'server'.

Not really, no, but that *does* sounds like a cool idea.

I want to do is to listen to my CD's as OGGs instead of having to use 
the physical media, so I was thinking of using some small form-factor 
hardware (PC-104 maybe?) plugged into my stereo. I want to be able to 
control it using the web (and maybe also using SNMP, BEEP, SMTP and a 
few others) so I can be lazy and change the music using my notebook, 
from my hammock on the balcony, when drinking cocktails.

Now, the problem with that is that when I finish my cocktail, I have to 
leave the hammock and go to the kitchen and mix another one, and I 
probably wouldn't bring my notebook. So to change the music from there, 
I'd need to wake my games machine up, log in, bring up a web browser and 
hit the music server, then change the playlist. This is a pain, 
especially after a few cocktails or if I'm in the middle of playing a 
game, and not very easy for visitors.

So, a solution would be to use an iMac (running a useful OS) as the 
music server. It would fit perfectly sitting it on top of my big-arse 
old, discrete-component stereo and could have a web browser permanently 
running on it as well. It would always be available to be used as a UI 
to change the playlist, and fairly easy to use by the uninitiated. And 
it'd have to be an SE iMac, because the rest of the pre-desk-lamp-era 
iMacs look too silly.
