&gt; &gt; While I think that the concept of testing candidates is good, I am not 
&gt; &gt; sure that a written test like that would be of much use.
&gt; 
&gt; It was, I grant you, a difficult exam, however it did test for the
&gt; skills I most wanted.  It was also an open book exam, and I provided
&gt; a full set of Unix and SQL manuals.  (I discovered afterwards that the
&gt; manuals included all of the answer to the TCP sections!)

:-) Well, then, it does test an important skill.
 
&gt; &gt; In addition, I would criticize a question that asks what the following 
&gt; &gt; does:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     false && true && echo 1 || true && false && \
&gt; &gt;         echo 2 || false || true || echo 3 && echo 4 && echo 5
&gt; 
&gt; It's only one question, that gives an opportunity for the real geeks to
&gt; show their depth of knowledge!  It's one of those "you either know it
&gt; or you don't" type questions, and I think, particularly in view of the
&gt; example that you gave, that it's an idiom that is commonly used.  But,
&gt; remember, it is only one questions.

That one requires carefull thought to figure out what is going on.

It seems to hinge on the exact grouping that is occurring, and things like 

  false && true && echo 1

are easy to figure out because of short circuit evaluation, as is the next 
group, but it gets hard from there, and you have to know how the shell 
handles it from there.
