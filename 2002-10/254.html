&gt;&gt;Hi There,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It appears that there is enough interest to create an "Open Source
&gt;&gt;Distribution Service" and I would like to invite the people who wanted
&gt;&gt;to become part of the distribution network to my place for a `pot luck'
&gt;&gt;BBQ at my place.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&lt;snipped&gt;

Cheers to this!

Also....the latest Mandrake Newsletter asks for financial contributions...

FLASH: Mandrake Linux 9.0 - How you can give back.

 As has been widely reported, Mandrake Linux 9.0 is now available as
a free download from many Internet locations. MandrakeSoft is proud to
continue the Open Source tradition of releasing the distribution
immediately upon completion of development -- approximately one month in
advance of retail pack availability, and in easy to use ISO images. But
as you know, producing a Linux distribution represents a huge investment
in research & development which carries a high price tag.

This is where you come in. If you understand the huge effort involved
in producing a Linux distribution, and if you value the efforts of your
favorite Linux software company, make a valuable contribution today



Possible Linux Support for Acct application...

Also I talked to an employee from a company whose software we use for 
accounting. I don't want to put the guy on the spot, so I will just keep 
them anonymous for now.

However, I wrote him a few times telling him that the program he taught 
classed for ran in Linux, using Codeweavers Cross Over Office 1.2.

He said that the comany's engineers are looking into it and that he was 
having some problems with Windows XP. He seemed very interested in the idea.


Very exciting :-) .!

A few Wine apps.

I was also able to install & use Macromedia Dreamweaver & Flash...a few 
of the Lindows Insiders wanted to use those programs.

Not much to it, needs crossover office 1.2, download the trial, then 
register.  However, he said that he was able to install in Lindows no 
problem.

Ok, back to work...
