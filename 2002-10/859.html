&gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement when they 
&gt; mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before, it's unfortunate 
&gt; that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term for this.

DOWNLOAD is the shorthand!

&gt; 
&gt; True, but an ISP shouldn't exploit the fact that nobody reads the small print.

They don't exploit it (well they probably do) but people are stupid to
sign something that they A: haven't read fully or B: don't understand
fully.  There are an abundance of knowledgeable people out there that do
understand and can explain.  If they don't understand something, ASK! 
The ISP is probably more than happy to explain it in simple terms; their
helpdesk would do that all day anyway.  If the ISP can't explain in
simple terms (or isn't willing to) then the customer should go
elsewhere.  Simple.

&gt; If I need a lawyer to purchase Internet access there's something terribly 
&gt; wrong. Hell, if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n 
&gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something wrong.

If you don't have any technical knowledge then you shouldn't be using
it!  That would make things considerably better for everyone.  It's like
cars.  Everybody who drives a car has at least a small understanding of
how the car is built.  They might not be able to service the car, but
they still know roughly what makes the car tick.  When they get a flat
tyre or run out of fuel they can quickly work out what's going on and
remedy the problem.  

The same is not true with computers.  When they break most people lump
them to the service department with the complaint "the hard disk won't
load" or something equally stupid.  I am speaking from experience from
when I worked in a computer store.

Oh well, &lt;/rant&gt;

Cheers,
Adam
