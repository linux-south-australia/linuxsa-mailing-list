Ian,

&gt; Then why @ 20/c / MB?  Why not 1 or 2c?  I don't believe this has
&gt; anything to do with the ISP at all - it's happening upstream somewhere.

I just explained why not 1 or 2c/MB.  It might be that Uunet price their
pipes as high as they can get away with while still competing with the
per MB providers, or it might be that they price their pipes based on how
much it costs them to provide them.  I suspect the latter.  Certainly,
if it's the former, then a lot of telcos will see the opportunity to
make a fortune by selling at the real cost.

A 512Kbps pipe can deliver about 130GB each month if running flat out.
At 1c per megabyte you'd get, at best, $1,300 income per month, but
probably a lot less because you're not going to really be able to run
at 100% utilisation.  Let's assume 70% and $900.  You just can't buy a
512K pipe to USA for that little amount.  It's not available.

I think the problem is, and I realise this is getting a little personal
for which I do apologise, that you have an unrealistic idea of what it
costs to run a telco.  You are forming expectations for pricing based
on that flawed idea.  If you would find out what the costs really are
I think you might be generally satisfied with prices.

Regards,

David
