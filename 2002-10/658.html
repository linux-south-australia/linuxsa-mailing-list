Now that I have a copy of Lycoris beta 52 (thanks so much to the 
anonymous donor) I intend to build up the system over this weekend. 
Taking time off for the DSL BBQ of course &lt;G&gt;

My next trick is to get the setup so that I boot into Windows unless I 
boot Lycoris off a floppy. 

Perhaps I should explain. I have previously talked about the community 
project I am part of. I am continuously advocating Linux as a possible 
solution to licensing costs and a more moral ground for community 
groups to take if they believe in people being able to gain IT at a low 
cost. If I mention Linux they respond with questions of how close to 
Windows is it, how can people who learn on it switch to Windows if they 
later get a job.

Lycoris seems to be the closest distro to Windows I have seen. I 
believe that with Lycoris and OpenOffice I will be able to offer a 
non-Microsoft solution that can be accepted and at a cost which is 
attractive. Zero software cost is still a cost when you count in 
duplicating training and support

I should add that I accept Linux purists are adamant that this is the 
wrong way to go, were it a perfect world I would be manning the 
barricades with them. When you have a situation of either having a 
windows-look-alike or being told it must be Windows then evaluating 
Lycoris is my only option towards bringing others to the Linux world. 
Right or wrong they are the constraints I have to work under.

Any help to get Lycoris running, especially off a floppy therefore not 
scaring off Windows users until they are ready to look at Lycoris for 
themselves, will be very helpful towards our project's eventual 
adoption of an alternative to Microsoft.

How does that sound?

 Ian
