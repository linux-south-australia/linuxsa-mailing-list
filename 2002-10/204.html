Sending money to doubtless very worthy causes is one way of doing things.
Nearly all the causes I have seen mentioned are overseas ones. And yet
Australia has an extraordinarily rich collection of core developers and
fringe adder-oners, people the distribution makers cannot do without.
Perhaps the same ends could be served by moving the cash around locally? I
suspect it would have very much greater impact.

There are dozens and dozens of people churning out code around the
country, even a good few in Adelaide. Don't underestimate the
encouragement value of chunk of cash sufficient to buy a new microwave
oven or bicyle or something. I've known this sort of a donation to keep
interest up in open source projects which have made a big difference. (No
details avail.)

Allocating donations is very hard when it gets more formalised because of
the amorphous nature of open source. I learnt that many years ago when (as
an external consultant) I wrote the documentation surrounding the Linux
International Development Grant Fund and watched it in action for a while.
There were some guidelines, but it all got pretty torturous and although
they did some good things LI ended up winding down the scheme because of
the difficulties it faced in its then-form.
