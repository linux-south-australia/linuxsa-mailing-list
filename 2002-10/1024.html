The larger ones certainly offer that facility in one form or another.  However 
there are problems, eg
1. It is the ISP's meter, not the users
2. Some special action has to be taken by the user to see what the ISP says 
they have downloaded to date.
3. SFAIK you can't see your download credit decreasing in real time as you 
surf/download/pick up mail/load news/whatever.
4a. The ISP doesn't mind the user exceeding their allocation - its all extra 
income to them and
4b. Most users would want to be able to exceed their limit when they chose - 
they would not want to be cut off in the middle of a download.
5. add your egs to taste 

The issue seems to revolve around the fact that ISPs are charged for 
bandwidth, and want to have fees which reflect that, whereas users would 
probably prefer all-you-can-eat timed access.
IMHO if an ISP offered a programme where you paid for time, paying more/hr for 
a fast link than for a slow one, many issues would be gone.  The current 
$1/hr (give us $50 and you have 3 months to use the time) that some ISPs 
offer is excellent, but only applies to slow dial-up accounts.
