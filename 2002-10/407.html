Andrew,

&gt; ** I could be very wrong with this, so please correct me for everyones sake.
&gt; Ta. **

Ok.

&gt; X is the server and it waits for window managers (such as gnome,kde and so
&gt; on) to connect to it. They can connect from any network location as long as
&gt; they have access to do so. Normally this occures on the local computer.

The X Server renders the pixels on a display device. A window manager is
an application that organises windows on the X Server. It, for example,
decides what to do with the mouse clicks and movements and keyboard
events. For example, it may notice that the mouse pointer has moved off
one window into another window and therefore give the other window the
focus. It's responsible for drawing the window decorations. Desktop
Environments aren't really window managers...they are environments that
supply common functions and frameworks to applications.

The applications are the X Clients. They direct X Servers to make
windows for them and to draw text and other graphics on those windows.
An X Server is a Server because it is directed by clients, hence it
serves the clients. The service it provides is the graphicas and the
windows...

An X Client can use the X protocol (X is a protocol as well one of the
approved names for the X Window System) to connect to an X Server. In
fact an X Client always uses the X Protocol to connect to an X Server. X
uses a number of authentication systems to determine who can connect to
it. Lookup xauth and xhost for two of them...
