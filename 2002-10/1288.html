<H1>Java-based RDP client</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
There's a little project in the pipeline which will probably mean that
I'm going to have to start looking at something to give our users
access to their desktops remotely, most probably via the web.

Now, Citrix have a Java ICA client (but I'd rather not use Citrix as
it's expensive and a bit cumbersome), but I'm dealing with Microsoft
Terminal Server people.

Microsoft, too, have a web-based client for RDP, something they like
to call Terminal Services Advanced Client (TSAC). It's an ActiveX
control, so it's simply a case of "too bad" for anyone that either
runs a browser other than IE.

We're not a totally evil place; not everyone has Windows on their
desktop, with IE sitting snugily between the "Recycle Bin" and "My
Briefcase". Because this is so, I've got to consider people like me,
who run UNIX on everything, and people that use the other operating
systems floating around out there.

From what I can see, HOBLink JWT[1] seems to be the only Java-based
RDP client out there. It costs money, which is not by any means out of
the question, but, if there's a free option available, I'm willing to
take it.

I understand that it may be somewhat a "pipe dream", given that some
of the trickier bits of HOBLink / TSAC / Java ICA would require a fair
bit of thinking on the programmers part.

I know that there's RDesktop, but in reality, I need it to run from a
web browser of some description.

If there's anyone that can suggest an Open Source product that'll meet
my needs, or even a piece of commercial software that'll do what HOB
does better, I'd love to hear from you.

TIA,

   - andrew
