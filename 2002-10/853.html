Ian,

&gt; No - I just wish everyone would be unanimous in agreeing that this sucks and
&gt; look at what can be done.  It does suck - we clearly all agree with that.

You posted an article about a group of people complaining that they'd been 
duped by the Telcos when it's quite likely that with a bit of education and 
understanding they wouldn't be in front of the ombudsman.

&gt; I am not saying I am superior - I just loath the newbie trashing that is so
&gt; prevalent in the *nix community - it really has to stop.

I wasn't newbie trashing; trust me. If you said to me that you fully understood 
the contract and all the terms and then told me you were going to complain 
about how much it costs then I'd call you something that wouldn't be repeatable 
on this list or in front of respectable people.

&gt; For us it is easy
&gt; to see what is involved - for someone else - it is perfectly reasonable that
&gt; they don't read through 10 pages of fine print (even though I always do I
&gt; don't expect everyone to do this) - they just want it to work as it is
&gt; advertised on the television to do - and this is not happening.

Maybe not. You have a point, but I also haven't seen an ISP contract more than 
two pages long.

&gt; There is a
&gt; clear gulf between marketing hype and reality that is clearly *not* targeted
&gt; at groups of users such as ourselves that know better.

And there always has been. I think we need to get over it...
 
&gt; Can LinuxSA submit a paper to the broadband inquiry?  We obviously have the
&gt; analytical and technical ability to do so.

No.

LinuxSA doesn't exist as a separate entity from the members of LinuxSA. And 
even then, the membership of LinuxSA is diverse and it's not altogether easy to 
determine who is a member of LinuxSA is not

But don't look at me--it's not me who doesn't want LinuxSA to become 
incorporated?
