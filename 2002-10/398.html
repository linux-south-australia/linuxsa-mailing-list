Way to go!

I will be happy to be involved.  The advantage of such a service for people
is speedy, well produced CDs at a decent price.  The 'profits' can go back
to the authors..

An automated ordering system could email orders automatically to the nearest
'distributor'.

&gt; DCD,
&gt; 
&gt; [ Do you happen to have a name other than DCD? I know we've talked in
&gt; person but I don't want to embarass myself by calling you the "wrong"
&gt; name ;-P ]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;     If the site is still available to us it's on a server that uses
&gt; &gt; mysql. But I can't confirm this until early next week. but 
&gt; certainly in
&gt; &gt; time for your proposed BBQ.
&gt; 
&gt; Good.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;     There seems to be a fairly good response to this 
&gt; concept, and a side
&gt; &gt; issue, but still quite important of supporting the distro's 
&gt; financially,
&gt; &gt; For my $0.02 I could see those involved charging an extra 
&gt; fee, say $1
&gt; &gt; per cd or transfer, and putting this into a fund for the appropriate
&gt; &gt; distro eg. fee's raised from burning mandrake cd's used to 
&gt; maintain at
&gt; &gt; least a mandrake club membership, so that linuxsa was seen to be
&gt; &gt; contributing to the opensource community internationally.
&gt; 
&gt; Good idea, I'll make sure we have an opportunity to raise it 
&gt; at the BBQ
&gt; next week.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This would also mean that on a regular basis Service members would
&gt; &gt; report in how many they had distributed that month and deposit funds
&gt; &gt; appropriately. On an Honor basis of course. It would also give us an
&gt; &gt; idea of the numbers and popularity of distro's across adelaide.
&gt; 
&gt; We could even automate this with a sort of ordering system.
&gt; 
&gt; Take a look at:
&gt; 
&gt; * <A HREF="http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/osdn/">http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/osdn/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; ...it's a preliminary site and you could probably do a better design
&gt; than me. I've just put that together so that we have 
&gt; something to "look
&gt; at" and "work on". The name links are all "false" e-mail addresses at
&gt; the moment because I may have dobbed someone in. In time I'll develop
&gt; something that will make the "Current Distributors" dynamic 
&gt; and add more
&gt; features. We need, though, to start somewhere.
