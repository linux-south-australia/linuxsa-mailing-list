&gt; Hi All,
&gt; As the title states, i've just tried everything in the book to ghost a
&gt; redhat 7.3 across to an identical drive.  It boots up until it tries to
&gt; mount one of the ext3 partitions.  Then it all goes pearshaped and does a
&gt; kernel panic:
&gt; 
&gt; Loading ext3 module
&gt; Mounting /proc filesystem
&gt; Creating root device
&gt; Mounting root filesystem
&gt; EXT3 - fs : journal inode is deleted
&gt; mount:  error 22 mounting ext3
&gt; pivotroot: pivot_root(/sysroot, /sysroot/initd) failed: 2
&gt; Freeing unused kernel memory: 280k freed
&gt; Kernel panic: No init found: try passing init = option to kernel
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas, gurus?  How do i clone a this disc?  I've tried going to an image
&gt; and back again. I've tried the switch in ghost that says do a 'bit-wise'
&gt; copy but it compains and says that the destination drive is too small, when
&gt; i reality it's the same drive (model, brand, size, even the same day bought
&gt; :)).  I tried the option that says clone unused space as well and this still
&gt; didn't boot.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; Matthew
&gt; 
&gt; PS:  perhaps ghost is not the thing to use here, is there alternatives?
&gt; 

Matthew,
	Partimage is an open source ghost like application. I have tried out 
archiving partitions but haven't tried restoring yet, but I have heard 
good things about it. It consists of 2 floppy images, that have a linux 
kernel and a selection of ethernet drivers etc. on it, so that you can 
store on a network. You might need to re-package it or have a driver on 
a separate disk if it doesn't support your card though.

I think another (open source) approach is Mindi/Mondo? but  I am not 
sure of the details of how it works.

HTH,
Barney.
