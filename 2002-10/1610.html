&gt;I am by no means a Unix buff. But I have a customer that needs.

Sounds like the latest redhat 8.0 will meet all their requirements, but 
probably any other distro will too.

&gt;1. A file and printer server. Nothing hard here everyone has access to files
&gt;and printer
&gt;
Samba is shipped with most distributions and pretty easy to setup. Most 
even have gui's for it.

&gt;2. Mail server with virus scanner on inbound and outbound. Only problem I
&gt;see here is that they don't have a permanent IP address
&gt;  
&gt;
I use a free dyndns hoster for my mail server, like www.no-ip.org which 
redirects all my email to awol.no-ip.org and it costs nothing to use.  :)

&gt;3. Permanent connection to the net, Well as permanent as they can currently
&gt;get ( 5hr session times)
&gt;  
&gt;
Most dialer apps like kppp have a redial if disconnected option or just 
include persist option to pppd in /etc/ppp/options file. The redhat 
network device gui also has a redial option in it.

&gt;4. Not needed right now, but to be set-up later, a fax server. Need to has a
&gt;printer driver on the windows machines
&gt;
Hylafax isn't too hard to setup and use either.

&gt;
&gt;Anyway, As I am mainly into fixing windoze machine.
&gt;I was hoping that someone that lives south of Adelaide might be able to help
&gt;me build this server.
&gt;They will obviously get redeemed for any help provided..
&gt;
&gt;Regards Troy
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
Anyway it all sounds pretty easy to me. I dont live south, I'm at 
Magill, but let me know if I can be of more help.
