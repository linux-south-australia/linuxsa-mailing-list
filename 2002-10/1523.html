T3 appeals spam decision
Caitlin Fitzsimmons
OCTOBER 30, 2002 	
	
THE direct marketing firm that lost a legal stoush with an anti-spam
campaigner earlier this month has filed an appeal.

The Which Company, trading as T3 Direct, filed a lawsuit against Perth man
Joey McNicol in May for allegedly getting the company black-listed on
anti-spam website SPEWS.org &lt;<A HREF="http://www.spews.org&gt">http://www.spews.org&gt</A>;. 

SPEWS (spam prevention early-warning system) runs a list of IP addresses
believed to be used for unsolicited bulk email, commonly known as spam.
Internet service providers (ISPs) or systems administrators can refer to
SPEWS and choose to block traffic to and from the blacklisted IP addresses. 

T3 claimed that Mr McNicol had made "unfounded complaints" to SPEWS,
resulting in a black-listing that cost $80,000 in lost revenue and damaged
equipment. 

Two weeks ago, the court dismissed T3's case as "speculative" and based on
claims the company "knew to be incorrect". 

T3 has now filed an appeal, which Mr McNicol's lawyer, Jeremy Malcolm, says
"challenges everything in the original decision". 

In the appeal &lt;<A HREF="http://t3-v-mcnicol.ilaw.com.au/appeal.pdf&gt">http://t3-v-mcnicol.ilaw.com.au/appeal.pdf&gt</A>;, T3 argues the
court should have allowed the case to go to trial. 

The appeal says Mr McNicol's alleged complaint to SPEWS was unfounded and
could be defamatory. 

While T3 admits to sending unsolicited emails, it says that it also sends
opt-in emails on behalf of clients and the SPEWS listing blocked IP
addresses used for this legitimate business and not for spam. 

Mr McNicol published material about T3's spamming activity on his website
but has always denied contacting SPEWS and says he believes it impossible to
do so. 

T3's appeal argues that the question of whether or not Mr McNicol contacted
SPEWS should be tested in court. 

The court found that, even if Mr McNicol had contacted SPEWS, this would not
be illegal in any case. 

T3's appeal says there is a reasonable possibility that Mr McNicol's alleged
act could be unlawful and it should therefore go to court. 

Mr Malcolm said he expected to receive the full appeal from T3 within three
weeks.
