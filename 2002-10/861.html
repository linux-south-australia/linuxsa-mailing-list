Quoting <A HREF="mailto:davidn@rebel.net.au">davidn@rebel.net.au</A>:

&gt; &gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement
&gt; &gt; when they mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before,
&gt; &gt; it's unfortunate that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term
&gt; &gt; for this.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah but there *is* a widely accepted shorthand term.  "Download" is widely
&gt; understood to mean "data from the ISP to the customer."

To those who know what download means, yes. To the user who clicks "download" 
in IE, no.

&gt; &gt; if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n 
&gt; &gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, it's really quite simple.  People are NOT stupid and neither are
&gt; they guileless.  Some consumers will try anything to avoid paying for what
&gt; they bought.  They know that when they sign up to an ISP the product is
&gt; stuff delivered from the Internet.  To try to claim a mistunderstanding,
&gt; that they genuinely thought web pages, or email, or ICQ, or such, was for
&gt; free is just plain guile.  Darn, already used guile, must buy a thesaurus.
&gt; It's duplicit, artful, dishonest, deceitful, tricky, chicanery.  It's
&gt; almost fraudulent.

Yes, this is true, but it doesn't discount genuine cases of ignorance.

Users trying to suck money out of ISPs because they can't read T&C's is bad. 
ISPs making it clear (which they already might) about what the user is doing in 
their primary advertisements is good.

My beef was with the attitude that a user shouldn't have to contact their geek 
friend in order to buy an internet connection, not that getting compensation 
out of the ISP is a good idea.
