&gt;&gt; Being trivial to forge, you could easily set the following events

Sorry, serves me right for posting tired.  This was very much *for
example* only.

&gt;&gt; [1]  Presuming that we can - some networks drop such martian packets.

Additional note: this sort of filtering ("egress") can really only
be done at the peripheral edges of the cloud, where you have some
idea what the sourcepackets should be (like an ISP's dialin pool).
If your routing on the backbone, unless the source IP address is
in the private class C range, it's much more difficult (and more
likely, impossible) to tell if the packet is forged or not.

&gt; I assume you're not talking about your typical anti-spoofing rules
&gt; here.

No, not once that packet is en route.

&gt; How do you detect that someone has injected bogus packets somewhere
&gt; betweeen point A and point B, bound for yuor network?

For UDP, it would be almost impossible once it's hit your network.
Most of the upstream routers aren't going to be able to detect it
either.

&gt; Especally when the source of said bogosity is at the
&gt; otherwise unrelated point C, somewhere in between A and B, so A's and
&gt; B's anti-spoofing rules offer no protection?

Correct.
