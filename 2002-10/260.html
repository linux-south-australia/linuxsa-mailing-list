Daryl,

&gt; Bear in mind that there's more to programming than just programming.
&gt; Most programmers that I know of (and to be brutally honest, I'd have to
&gt; lump me into this group [1]) suck at documenting

Most programmers are dreadful documentaters. Good programmers know how
to comment code, but documentation? Who needs that? 

&gt; , but any process without
&gt; documentation makes it hard for non-programmers to get up and running.

And new programmers to join into the effort.

&gt; There there are people who are wizards at breaking code, and designing
&gt; test cases for that (yes, even Testers)

Often these type of people make good documenters too. Documenting
something and fiddling with it actually can make you discover heaps of
bugs.

&gt; people skills at managing and
&gt; communicating with other people (is it SmoothWall that has that charismatic
&gt; developer on the mailing list?)

Richard Morrel (1)? He makes me look like St Theresa ;-)

&gt; people with expertise outside of the
&gt; computing domain but overlapping with the problem you're trying to solve
&gt; (don't come looking my way for accounting skills, there's a good reason
&gt; why I pay others to do that for me).

Actually, Darryl, people should come looking to you for your accounting
skills. Even you would have probably been able to see the problems with
Enron, HIH and One.Tel. I mean, if you tell me that you don't understand
that not being paid by your customers will make you go broke will sort
of kill your business One.Tel style then you're in like Flynn.

&gt; So don't sell yourself short, James.  You're certainly capable of
&gt; stringing together a sentence that can get past the DSL radar.  ;-)

James has sent me a box of goodies, and it is going to arrive today.
WOOHOO!

&gt; [1]  But I am getting better [2], provided you don't make me use Word.

Use Star Office then :-)

&gt; [2]  Actually, I do OK, but it's one of my "focussed" tasks, which means
&gt;      I need to sit in a quiet room, with no distractions or interruptions
&gt;      (phone and pager off) and then be in "the zone".  As Tom DeMarco said,
&gt;      the typical office environment is a killer to all of those requirements.

I should dig up my reference to "The Dilbert Cubicle" :-)


DSL

(1) Spelling. Bad. And it's deliberate. I hope he's listening so he can
start a flamewar on LinuxSA. He'd be so good at continuing the flamewar
that I could just sit back and stay silent and he'd have everyone in a
tizz. In fact, was the infamous "Chuck" Richard in disguise?
