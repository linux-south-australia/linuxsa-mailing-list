&gt; I am willing to put down say $10 at the next meeting - I suggest we all do

I'll often order a CD online from places that claim to put part of the
proceeds back into the community. It's cheaper than downloading ISOs from the
'net.

Money isn't necessarily the best thing to give back to the Open Source
community, though. Ideally, we'd all be able to put back plenty of useful
code into our favourite projects, but that's rarely possible. Luckily for us,
coding isn't the only useful part of most Open Source projects that can do
with volunteers. Testing and Documentation are a fantastic way to put back
into the community.

Past employers (and indeed, my current one) have always gained a great deal
from Open Source software (in license fee savings, features, stabilty,
security, control and much more), so they quite often don't mind me spending
a little time here and there touching up a man page or submitting a patch to
fix a minor problem or testing the latest CVS copy of a particular
application. If each of us picked our favourite project and spent a few hours
of our own or our employers' time (with permission from the employer,
obviously) fixing parts of applications that have less polish than is
necessary. Documentation. Testing. Hell, even creating a bunch of pretty
little icons to be used with something like dia....

Donations of old hardware or licenses for unused operating systems to
particular software projects can help too (particularly some of the less
common stuff). Projects like samba (<A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A>) tend to thoroughly
test their code on all sorts of strange platforms. It would be nice if others
did/could. Wasn't the Linux/Alpha port first done on a donated Alpha?

OK, so most of us don't have any old Alphas lying around that we can (or want
to) just give away, but you can see my point.

&gt; This could be a halfway point for those of us that still want to contribute
&gt; something.

Why only do half the job? :-). Get rid of all of your guilt at once. I think
contributions are more valuable than cash donations in a lot of cases.

&gt; LinuxSA has no membership fee - we get free use of Compaq facilities, etc -
&gt; I am happy to start giving a little back - as small as that contribution may
&gt; be in the great scheme of things..

Good example. Compaq have made use of Open Source software in the past and
are showing their appreciation (at least in part) by allowing a local Linux
User Group to make use of their premises and even provide tea, coffee and a
bouncer :-)

If you'd like more ideas for how you can help a particular Open Source
project, ask the maintainer. The less time they spend documenting and testing
stuff, the more time they're coding.

Hope this helps,
Matt
