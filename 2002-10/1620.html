Ian,

Just an observation that I learnt the hard way. 

While ECC RAM is a luxury for most desktop machines, if you are running
dual CPU Athlon MP system based on the AMD 760MP/MPX (that is really the
only SMP Athlon chipset that I know of), then you are REQUIRED to
populate the banks with Registered DDR RAM. Since all of the registered
DDR modules that I've seen include ECC, this means getting registered
ECC DDR RAM.

Some motherboards like the Asus A7M266 say they don't require Registered
modules on a limited number of slots, but I've experienced many lock ups
and related problems before I replaced them with the Registered ECC
stuff.

Since Dual Athlon machines are popular (I use them at work and at home)
thought some people might take this onboard.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; mission critical applications - obviously - but are desktop users at a loss
&gt; because RAM is not ECC?  I am not sure if errors occur at random and this
&gt; can lead to data corruption over time?  I've never had a problem that I can

&gt; some problems I have had are due to RAM errors but it did not appear that
&gt; way).

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a coworker that owns a pentium iv Dell at home with a dual rim. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It came with 128 MB RDRAM x2 and AFAWK it should work in pairs. He 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently ordered some  256 MB RD RAM to add to the two additional open 
&gt; &gt; &gt; slots, the only difference being the 128 v 256 MB and the fact that one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; set of chips  are ECC while the others are not. He did buy Dell RAM
&gt; chips.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It didn't seem to work after the chips were installed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; does it work with only the 2 new 256Mb ones?
&gt; &gt; you should be able to have 2x128 and 2x256
&gt; &gt; I don't think you can mix ECC and non-ECC though
&gt; &gt; (ECC is error correcting BTW, generally good to have
&gt; &gt; but costs a fair bit more than non-ECC).
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, also:
&gt; 
&gt; Try putting the 128's where the 256's are, and vice versa.
&gt; or
&gt; Boot with 2x128's into the BIOS and try turning off any options that
&gt; relate to ECC.
&gt; 
&gt; Long shot, but you never know.
