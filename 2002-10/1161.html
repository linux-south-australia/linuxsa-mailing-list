Ah that's interesting.  so most of the time when i talk about NAT it's
actually PAT cos there is no outside address pool setup.  in any case most
people don't know the difference and they're confused enough as it is
(non-tech ppl, that is).

&gt; you are right. come to think of it.  NAT is complete address
&gt; translation making it look like it came from the outside of the
&gt; whatever.  PAT is pretty much the same except perhaps i could change
&gt; the ports on outgoing packets if it needed to?  i guess NAT would as
&gt; well if it needed to.  :)
&gt;
&gt; I wonder what microsoft calls it  :)  lol

Port address translation is used where you only have one usable internet
address to translate with - each connection originating from inside the
network is allocated a different port by the router.

Eg,

192.168.0.1:1030 -&gt; www.on.net:80

 .. the router makes the connection from its outside address - say,
64.32.16.8, using a source port of, say, 10000.

192.168.0.2 tries to connect to www.google.com:80 - the router makes the
connection using the same outside address, but with a source port of
10001.

And so on.

"NAT", as opposed to "PAT", is when the router has a pool of "outside"
addresses, and does one-to-one mapping to each "inside"-originating
connection, without doing any port mapping.

You'll often see a router configured to use NAT until it's used all but
one of its outside pool, then switch to PAT for any new translations.
Cisco PIX's use the term "PAT" a lot :-)


Cheers,

Nick
