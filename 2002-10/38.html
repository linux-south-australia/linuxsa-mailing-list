I can't believe we as a global community, following thousands of years of
successful evolution (no flames please) - need to expend as much resources
on network spam as we don security.

What's the latest on legislation around the world on this rubbish?  I know
some spammer tried to sue a anti-spam crusader in Perth, failed, went in to
spamming again, tried to sue the anti-spam crusader again and is still
trying to spam people.  These people clearly are not human - so legislation
seems to be the only answer.

Unless there was a global database of known spammers that the global
community could inundate with physical and electronic spam in return?

One get rich quick scam from 5 million people should, theoretically, get the
message across - unless their servers explode first.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any success / failure stories to share 
&gt; about Spam Assassin?
&gt; &gt; It looks like a *great* idea if it works..
&gt; 
&gt; Over the weekend I tested an installation of SpamAssassin at message
&gt; accept time. This means that SA is run against each line of 
&gt; the message as
&gt; it is accepted from the remote system, and the connection is 
&gt; immediately
&gt; closed with an error.
&gt; 
&gt; Advantages:
&gt; 
&gt;    - saves paying for an entire message to be downloaded and processed
&gt;      later
&gt;    - helps get people off spammers lists because it will be marked as 
&gt;      a failed delivery
&gt;    - uses less system resources
&gt; 
&gt; I did this with Exim 4 with integration work from Marc 
&gt; Merlin. Seems happy
&gt; so far.
