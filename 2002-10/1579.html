Hi All,
    This hasn't got much to add as to why ECC RAM, but
errors in RAM reminds me of a story of an engineer who won
some very important world wide prize (not the Nobel, but
something up there in prestige). The prize was presented for
the engineers work on cosmic rays interacting with computer
memory and changing bits and the effects of this in critical
applications and systems. The cosmic rays interact with the
electrons that make a bit 1 or 0. After he won the prize,
someone pointed out to him that even though it was ground
breaking work, it wasn't really new. The reason - Isaac
Asimov had written about how to destroy a positronic network
in his famous Robot stories 20 or more years before.
Positrons are the antimatter "opposite" of electrons and so
the cosmic ray method the engineer described was similar
(but opposite) to the method Asimov used to describe how to
kill a robot. The engineer ended up writing to Asimov and
telling him the story and Isaac was apparently very amused
about it all. Anyway, just thought you might be interested.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; because RAM is not ECC?  I am not sure if errors occur at
random and this
&gt; can lead to data corruption over time?  I've never had a
problem that I can
&gt; detect with errors in RAM - it's always seemed quite
reliable to me (unless
&gt; some problems I have had are due to RAM errors but it did
not appear that
&gt; way).
