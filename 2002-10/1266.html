Ian,

A weird idea:

Why not just put a series of tapes, but not with the turn type of handle but
with the flick type (like the ones surgeons use which can be flicked on an
off with an elbow, etc.), on the water pipe instead of valves.  Drill a hole
in each handle, connect each handle to wires, connect the wires to a switch,
connect the switch to your PC and when you need to water, tell the switch to
move the appropriate handle so many degrees to get so much water to go out.
Use simple cheep garden sprinkler hoses which have holes in them at set
points down the hose, you can close off which holes you don't want to use
with plumbers water proof tape.

Regards,
Dez

Subject: Linux powered water irrigation systems?

This is semi-off topic - so please refrain from the use of high powered
flame throwers just yet (WIELDs asbestos suit just in case).

I want to put in an automated irrigation system in the garden and rig that
up to a Linux box.  I've looked at controllers, valves, etc and they all
seem awfully expensive - any ideas?

More *on topic* - what about software and interfaces?  I want it to be
'networkable' so the standard parallel or serial connection just won't cut
it - ideally each valve will be addressable and the signal would go down the
water pipe somehow.  This is to allow the system to be scalable and flexible
so that moisture and other sensors can be rigged up and report down the
water pipe.

Each controller may be a 'subnet' and address up to 255 (or 254?) individual
valve and sensors or other equipment.  This would in turn allow up to 254
(?) layers on top of this.  For now - only up to maybe 15 to 30 valves and
sensors may be needed for a small pilot project.

The idea is to have some open source software that will collect information
from the environment and respond according to the parameters given to it -
say sensor Y reports moisture below a certain level then switch on drip feed
valve X for 1 hour, pause 20 minutes and sample again until it returns to
'programmed' levels.

Reporting software would collect information on water use and the
environment and any other required information (alert for leaking valve,
etc).

Something like this could save *a lot* of water - but I have no idea where
to start!  I do have a big garden some friends with small farms that are
very interested - especially if the design can be kept very simple, scalable
and cheap.  This is why Linux may seem like an overkill at first - but with
the scalability and flexibility of addressable devices and the reporting it
can bring - it seems quite reasonable to pull out an old Pentium 133 and put
it to use.

Any pointers or do I just think too much?
