Ian, 
On another tangent: 
You might want to visit the Conservatory at the Botanical Gardens.  All the
water regulating equipment which controls the sensors and water spray jets
is controlled from one PC to make sure the humidity, etc. is right for the
tropical plants.
Maybe you can find out who set the thing up and pick their brains???

that's a point!  Perhaps if the valves were to have some sort of conductor 
in them - a wire going from one side of the valve to the other?

&gt; Would the reporting/controlling get thru the network if there 
&gt; is a closed 
&gt; closed valve?

&gt; Subject:      Linux powered water irrigation systems? 
&gt; 
&gt; This is semi-off topic - so please refrain from the use of 
&gt; high powered 
&gt; flame throwers just yet (WIELDs asbestos suit just in case). 
&gt; 
&gt; I want to put in an automated irrigation system in the garden 
&gt; and rig that 
&gt; up to a Linux box.  I've looked at controllers, valves, etc 
&gt; and they all 
&gt; seem awfully expensive - any ideas? 
&gt; 
&gt; More *on topic* - what about software and interfaces?  I want it to be 
&gt; 'networkable' so the standard parallel or serial connection 
&gt; just won't cut 
&gt; it - ideally each valve will be addressable and the signal 
&gt; would go down the 
&gt; water pipe somehow.  This is to allow the system to be 
&gt; scalable and flexible 
&gt; so that moisture and other sensors can be rigged up and 
&gt; report down the 
&gt; water pipe. 
&gt; 
&gt; Each controller may be a 'subnet' and address up to 255 (or 
&gt; 254?) individual 
&gt; valve and sensors or other equipment.  This would in turn 
&gt; allow up to 254 
&gt; (?) layers on top of this.  For now - only up to maybe 15 to 
&gt; 30 valves and 
&gt; sensors may be needed for a small pilot project. 
&gt; 
&gt; The idea is to have some open source software that will 
&gt; collect information 
&gt; from the environment and respond according to the parameters 
&gt; given to it - 
&gt; say sensor Y reports moisture below a certain level then 
&gt; switch on drip feed 
&gt; valve X for 1 hour, pause 20 minutes and sample again until 
&gt; it returns to 
&gt; 'programmed' levels. 
&gt; 
&gt; Reporting software would collect information on water use and the 
&gt; environment and any other required information (alert for 
&gt; leaking valve, 
&gt; etc). 
&gt; 
&gt; Something like this could save *a lot* of water - but I have 
&gt; no idea where 
&gt; to start!  I do have a big garden some friends with small 
&gt; farms that are 
&gt; very interested - especially if the design can be kept very 
&gt; simple, scalable 
&gt; and cheap.  This is why Linux may seem like an overkill at 
&gt; first - but with 
&gt; the scalability and flexibility of addressable devices and 
&gt; the reporting it 
&gt; can bring - it seems quite reasonable to pull out an old 
&gt; Pentium 133 and put 
&gt; it to use. 
&gt; 
&gt; Any pointers or do I just think too much?
