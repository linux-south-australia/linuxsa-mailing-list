Glen,

&gt; You've missed the point.  An "inherently secure" system
&gt; allows for failure, but requires failure to take the
&gt; system to the "secure" state.

I certainly missed the point just now! :-)  Isn't a secure system
*always* in the secure state, failure or no?


&gt; The challenge for the computer language is to *always* be
&gt; able to detect when failure has occurred.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a question of the run-time environment, not of
&gt; the user syntax (although the syntax obviously has to
&gt; be able to give the run-time environment enough
&gt; information, something C doesn't do and Pascal almost
&gt; does).

I don't agree that Pascal gives the run-time environment more than C can.
I think we're coming from different angles.  You are probably assuming,
"programmed in the natural way for that language," whereas I am assuming,
"programmed in a reasonable way to ensure reliability."

It's the difference between "*(a+i) = v" and "assign(address(a,i),v)"
with appropriate exception or error handling.  Just because you *can*
pass a strict pointer doesn't mean you have to.

In some ways C++ can make reliable coding feel more natural.  It's just
a pity you have to pick up a hole lot of nasty baggage with it!  Anyway,
at risk of repeating myself, real programs can write Fortran in any
language.


&gt;&gt; In fact, posit a general purpose computing language, which can be
&gt;&gt; implemented on a range of current, popular microprocessors.  If a system,
&gt;&gt; Ss, written in that language, is inherently secure, then it follows that
&gt;&gt; there is a system, Sm, written in the machine laguage, which is also
&gt;&gt; inherently secure.  From this it also follows that both Ss and Sm are
&gt;&gt; members of an infinte set of systems, almost certainly including an Sc
&gt;&gt; (the system written in C), all of which are equivalent translations of
&gt;&gt; each other.
&gt;
&gt; You argue that any Sm can be represented as an Sc.

Not quite.  I argue that any Sm = Tsm(Ss) can be equivalently expressed
in many other high-level languages.  C's closeness to the hardware makes
it almost certain to be one of them.

The point of Sm wasn't so much that you have to translate Ss to machine
language, although you do have to do that, rather it was to underscore
the fact that language S must be translatable into *some* other language.
I don't know what features you would want in S, but I'm reckoning that
they can all be reasonably expressed in C.  For this not to be the case
would require S to have a feature which can map to machine instructions
on a range of current, popular microprocessors, and for C to be unable
to express those instructions.  Realising that the claim was that Linux
is inherently insecure because it is written in C, should S have, for
example, an explicit "write to I/O port" statement, it's fair to make
use of a library or inline assembler equivalent.

&gt; Now to be able to argue that all Sm can be generated by
&gt; any Sc, you need to show the inverse: that Sc can generate
&gt; all Sm opcodes.

"Can be represented as" is not the same as "can be generated by."
We're looking for the same expression, not the same program.  Given
Sm = Tsm(Ss) and Sm' = Tcm(Sc), if Sm and Sm' are eqivalent, then so
are Ss and Sc.  It gets back to what machine features might S use
that C cannot also use.  I think there are none.


&gt; But there's contradictory evidence: C
&gt; doesn't have enough semantic information to generate the
&gt; array bounds check instruction for all array accesses
&gt; (worst case: malloc an array, access it via an alias).

You don't need to bounds check for all array accesses.  Only for
bounds-checked arrays, which are expressed by a (base, size) tuple,
not by base alone.  If, in language S, all array accesses are bounds
checked then you would bounds check all array accesses in C.


&gt;&gt; Ian is, I think, referring to an uncrackable system.  That's much easier
&gt;&gt; to achieve.  (I'm not convinced that B level security, as in Orange book,
&gt;&gt; can be achieved.)
&gt;
&gt; They amount to the same thing.  People that think otherwise
&gt; should consider the success of timing attacks against SSL
&gt; implementations.

This is interesting.  I don't know about timing attacks against SSL.
Is this to say that only a system with non-deterministic response can
be uncrackable?

I'm sure there must be any number of ways of communicating between
two machines using private keys, such that nobody in between (with
conventional computers) can monitor or modify the transmissions.
Maybe SSL is defficient, but surely Orange book security is not required
for a network appliance to be uncrackable?

Regards,

David
