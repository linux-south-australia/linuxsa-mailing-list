What does 'registered' RAM mean?  That it is supported by the vendor?

Subject: Re: Why ECC RAM?


Completely agree, ECC for absolute mission critical stuff (I don't know
how true this is, but I've been told that once you start getting too far
over 1GB of memory, one needs to use ECC or thing become unstable...) 
ECC *is* over-the-top for your average desktop machine.

Some Intel boards (mostly their really expensive server varieties) will
not accept memory unless it is ECC and registered.  Obviously, this
isn't the case here - exchange the memory for normal RDRAM if possible,
but chances are it was ordered in specifically and is not returnable.

&gt; mission critical applications - obviously - but are desktop users at a
loss
&gt; because RAM is not ECC?  I am not sure if errors occur at random and this
&gt; can lead to data corruption over time?  I've never had a problem that I
can

(unless
&gt; some problems I have had are due to RAM errors but it did not appear that
&gt; way).

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a coworker that owns a pentium iv Dell at home with a dual rim.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It came with 128 MB RDRAM x2 and AFAWK it should work in pairs. He 
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently ordered some  256 MB RD RAM to add to the two additional open

&gt; &gt; &gt; slots, the only difference being the 128 v 256 MB and the fact that
one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; set of chips  are ECC while the others are not. He did buy Dell RAM
&gt; chips.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; It didn't seem to work after the chips were installed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; does it work with only the 2 new 256Mb ones?
&gt; &gt; you should be able to have 2x128 and 2x256
&gt; &gt; I don't think you can mix ECC and non-ECC though
&gt; &gt; (ECC is error correcting BTW, generally good to have
&gt; &gt; but costs a fair bit more than non-ECC).
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, also:
&gt; 
&gt; Try putting the 128's where the 256's are, and vice versa.
&gt; or
&gt; Boot with 2x128's into the BIOS and try turning off any options that
&gt; relate to ECC.
&gt; 
&gt; Long shot, but you never know.
