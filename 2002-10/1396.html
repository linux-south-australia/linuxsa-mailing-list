Sounds great - save on battery weight, cost, motherboard components, etc -
the price for a laptop could drop dramatically - it sounds like an excellent
idea.  Will we see more of Crusoe?  Transmeta don't appear to be highly
successful (just yet).

&gt; "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt; asks:
&gt; &gt; What is Transmeta like for sheer grunt?  Or will Transmeta 
&gt; be primarily
&gt; &gt; for mobile applications?  If it appears on the desktop - 
&gt; will this spur
&gt; &gt; a little competition?
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard of desktop machines with a Crusoe, but the main benefit
&gt; is low power, and hence the chip is positioned for the mobile market.
&gt; Binary translation makes them slower than a GenuineIntel 
&gt; running at the
&gt; same clock speed, and in keeping with the low power design, they don't
&gt; come at the stupidly high clock speeds of the competition.  I wouldn't
&gt; buy one for grunt.
&gt; 
&gt; I trialled a Black-n-Gold Crusoe-based notebook, and found desktop
&gt; applications and screen updates to be acceptably responsive.  
&gt; Since MPEG
&gt; decoding is CPU intensive I also watched a DVD movie on it and saw no
&gt; fault, which I took as a good sign.  I didn't think to ask if 
&gt; the machine
&gt; had a hardware MPEG decoder, so the DVD test might not have 
&gt; the importance
&gt; that I hoped.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite the quirky physical size of the screen (maybe 10" diagonal and
&gt; about the same aspect ratio as a wide-screen TV), it had 
&gt; 1024x768 pixels.
&gt; (Sony's Vio PCGC1MT has a wierd but bountiful 1280x600 pixels!)
&gt; 
&gt; Crusoe notebooks are rated for very long battery life, some as long as
&gt; five hours as compared to two hours for a traditional 
&gt; notebook.  They are
&gt; also quite light, usually weighing in at less than 1KG, and 
&gt; have a small
&gt; form factor.
&gt; 
&gt; I think they have a lot going for them, including price.  
&gt; Small and light
&gt; yet full featured; fast enough but don't expect to wow anyone
