David,

&gt;&gt; Personally I think it's a good idea, although I just wish more email
&gt;&gt; clients would support it.
&gt;
&gt; Why? It's a public mailing list...why would you want to prove who you
&gt; are and to whom? Admittedly a person has attempted to impersonate me
&gt; once but it was quite obvious it wasn't me.

What, they were nice? :P

&gt; Adding signature clap-trap, unless you have a very good reason to do so
&gt; (1), is a waste of bandwidth.

And responding to every single message on this list back to the list is
not a waste of bandwidth? (Such as your message saying to someone today
glad that they got their problem worked out. Not saying it's a bad thing
to do that, but wouldn't it be better in a personal directed email?)

Darryl
