It is a local call rate call.

It is, unfortunately, not uncommon for hotel billing tables not to 
have been updated to include this prefix, its only been around for, 
oh, two or three years now I guess (sigh).

So the stupid billing system tends to confuse it with an old analog 
prefix (019) and charge you on that basis.

You could start by asking them how they think you called an 019 
analog mobile phone, when they -no longer exist- ... :)

There are avenues here if the hotel won't play ball. Talking to the 
TIO and the ACA (via their primary contact numbers) may well be 
helpful. I read of one company which hit this issue so often they got 
Telstra to write them a letter confirming the call rate that applies 
for 0198 prefix numbers and photocopied it for their staff to 
brandish at checkout operators at hotels who still hadn't got with 
the program yet.

This is, also, a reason why our 'real' local Internode PoP's in 
places like Sydney aren't going to go away - and why our 'best number 
to call' locator software (the web and phone ivr based versions) both 
provide those 'physical' numbers where available, in preference to 
the 0198 number.

In the end, its the hotel botching things, but its often hard to 
fight it out with the checkout person, who often can't even spell 
'telephone', let alone rationally understand what the problem is.

Like most problems, 'this too shall pass' in time.

&gt;&gt;  hi Richard,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Have put quite a few of these billing systems in for EBPC and I seem to
&gt;&gt;  recall that they don't understand 0198 and some other old numbers due to
&gt;&gt;  problems in things like time of day, what Telstra are actually charging
&gt;&gt;  for that particular call ie. not all are toll free etc.. It's quite
&gt;&gt;  common for the total bill from the software to not match the Phone bill
&gt;&gt;  for a billing period. I would be having a go at the hotel.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, I am in the process of doing that. Since they charged me 75c for a
&gt;one-hour call to the local number of Internode, and it really does not
&gt;matter whether I am calling an ISP or I am having a long yack with my
&gt;relatives, they should be charging me a local call charge for those calls.
&gt;
&gt;I guess I can always complain load and clear on my web site about being
&gt;ripped off by the hotel in question.
&gt;
&gt;However, this also points out that people who travel need to be aware of
&gt;these issues, and perhaps should ask what the local call rate is, and what
&gt;that rate applies to.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
