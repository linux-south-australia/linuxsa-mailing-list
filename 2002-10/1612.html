Happy Halloween!!!

This is pretty neat. Apparently the owners of this house had been 
seeing images and hearing voices for quite a while. They did some 
research and found that a lady once lived in the house who lost her 
husband during the civil war. Legend says that she used to sit at the 
table and look across the fields in anticipation of her loved one 
returning home. He never came. So, they say she still waits. They 
caught this photo of what they claim to be her.

This one was wild and a little spooky once you find the ghost in the 
picture. It took me a few seconds to find it, but when you do, it just 
stands out. Like one of those optical illusions.

To save you some time, concentrate around the table. Best not to focus 
too much on one spot. Look around the table and toward the window. Keep 
looking, you'll eventually see it.

Click on the link below for the picture. Best to enlarge. For an added 
touch turn up the volume, it's faint, but the low murmur you hear was 
what got the photographer's attention first.

(Note: you must have Multimedia Flash installed...to see this. It's 
free...check out Google for the URL.)

Cheers,  Ian
