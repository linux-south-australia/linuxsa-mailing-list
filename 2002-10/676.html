at this time. After this time, visitors will need to pay for their 
passes at the door. $10

PLEASE NOTE: 
•You will need to bring ID to Expo to receive company pass (ie. 
business card)

Cheers,  Ian

Wiredup 2002 is Adelaide's most significant computer technology and 
business solutions expo, targeting the corporate, education and 
government sectors.
The Exhibition commenced in 1998 at the Adelaide Convention Centre, 
with two interim years at the Royal Adelaide Showground. An estimated 
9,500 visitors attended the last Wiredup Expo.
The event returns to the newly renovated and enlarged Adelaide 
Convention Centre - one of the finest convention facilities in the 
world.

The event will be held over two days, November 1 & 2, condensed in 
size, with a business focus.

Industry Focus in 2002
 Greater links will be forged with a number of professional industry 
associations to invite exhibition pre-registration in 2002 and further 
promotion of the event.
These bodies are expected to include legal, accounting, management, 
education and business associations through membership.

Training and Recruitment
 Due to the growth in the number of participating exhibitors in the 
training and recruitment areas a special pavilion has been designed 
within the main Hall H, as a walkthrough section to highlight this 
sector.
