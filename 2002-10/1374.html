Hey all,

I'm a bit stumped with what "blue and green screen" this user is
talking about.  Has anyone encountered one with Redhat 8.0, possibly
because Redhat had problems detecting settings for X?

This user has had Redhat 7.2 running on pretty much the exact same
hardware (only has replaced hard drive since, with a 2nd hand one), so
everything should be supported....

The actual hardware is fairly old (I'm thinking it's a Pentium or similar).

Any ideas?


Thanks,

~Rhett

Good evening Rhett,
I have run the installation again from the CDs and have the Grub
bootloader on my C: drive and it works OK in so far as it will boot into
either system but it still won't go past the blue and green screen I
described to you on the phone Saturday.
If I hit enter a few times it will come up with the text login screen.
After going through root; password; <A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> root: startx enter it
goes away and has a think and comes back with;
Fatal server error:
No screens found
XIO Fatal IO error 104, connection reset by peer
0X X server ":0.0" after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events
remaining
[ <A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> root ]#

During setting up, the default for the monitor came up as "unprobed"
"unable to probe" and at the end when I had to select a monitor I went
for the generic High Colour 16 bit 800x600 which is the monitor recorded
in my system info in windows.
Does any of this make any sense? Can you help?
The advert boxes that come up during loading are really exciting and it
is very frustrating being so close but yet so far.
Regards Gordon.
