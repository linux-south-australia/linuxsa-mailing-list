&gt; &gt; It's just possible that the front desk was right.  I've gone through
&gt; &gt; my aussie-isp archives.  Back in August there was a lot of
&gt; &gt; discussion on the price charged for calls to 01983 numbers.  The
&gt; &gt; gist of it was that Telstra charges for calls to 019833 (Telstra) at
&gt; &gt; 30c/h but a significantly higher price (possibly $1.20/h) for calls
&gt; &gt; to other 01983 numbers (e.g. Comindico.)
&gt; 
&gt; but I believe there was a recent ACCC ruling that telstra can't
&gt; do that anymore.  Anyway I don't think it's really relevent to
&gt; Richard, basically the hotel can charge what it likes regardless
&gt; of what they're actually paying their carrier.

Just to clarify, the prices above are for Telstra's ISDN Home service. 
Telstra's website says all data calls to 01983 are to be priced at
$0.30/hour, while other data calls are priced at $1.10/hr, with a
call-connection fee (I'm not sure, but I don't believe a call-connection
fee applies for data calls to 01983 numbers).

Calls to 0198 numbers on normal phone lines, or voice calls on ISDN
home, are charged at a local call rate.

&gt; So I am being charged 30c / hr to call Internode???  I certainly hope not..
Not if you're calling an 0198 number on a normal phone line =)
