No - I would always prefer untimed connections but metered bandwidth - if
only I could get up to 20GB / month!!!  That would allow up to 2 - 3 hours
of BBC news on my ADSL connected TV each night.

Speaking of which - I have always marvelled at the blatant inefficiency of
the Internet to handle streaming media - it is host to many many many
points.  Isn't IPv6 meant to handle media streaming more efficiently
somehow?  Such as broadcasting to many points rather than an individual
stream to each individual point even if they are in the same area.

My honest believe is that when streaming media becomes mainstream over ADSL
- then demand will most certainly exceed supply.

I'm just rapt that I can listen to talk back radio in Johannesburg or
Eastern Europe over ADSL - much more reliable that my short wave radio and
20 metres of tuned wire.

I wonder if Internode will eventually be able to 'cache' streaming media?

&gt; &gt; But don't all ISPs have a usage meter for your account 
&gt; and/or some sort
&gt; &gt; of arrangement to tell you when you're getting near your 
&gt; limit for the
&gt; &gt; month?
&gt; 
&gt; The larger ones certainly offer that facility in one form or 
&gt; another.  However 
&gt; there are problems, eg
&gt; 1. It is the ISP's meter, not the users
&gt; 2. Some special action has to be taken by the user to see 
&gt; what the ISP says 
&gt; they have downloaded to date.
&gt; 3. SFAIK you can't see your download credit decreasing in 
&gt; real time as you 
&gt; surf/download/pick up mail/load news/whatever.
&gt; 4a. The ISP doesn't mind the user exceeding their allocation 
&gt; - its all extra 
&gt; income to them and
&gt; 4b. Most users would want to be able to exceed their limit 
&gt; when they chose - 
&gt; they would not want to be cut off in the middle of a download.
&gt; 5. add your egs to taste 
&gt; 
&gt; The issue seems to revolve around the fact that ISPs are charged for 
&gt; bandwidth, and want to have fees which reflect that, whereas 
&gt; users would 
&gt; probably prefer all-you-can-eat timed access.
&gt; IMHO if an ISP offered a programme where you paid for time, 
&gt; paying more/hr for 
&gt; a fast link than for a slow one, many issues would be gone.  
&gt; The current 
&gt; $1/hr (give us $50 and you have 3 months to use the time) 
&gt; that some ISPs 
&gt; offer is excellent, but only applies to slow dial-up accounts.
