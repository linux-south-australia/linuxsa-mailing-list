Ian, when you posted on this topic the other day I asked a friend with 
legal experience to provide some guidance. Use with caution but perhaps 
it clarifies the situation.

Cheers,  Ian

Subject: RE: MS EULA and VNC Access?

This is a personal view and perspective based on my experience and 
knowledge of both Open Source, Limited License and Proprietary  
computer software licensing laws and mandates. I am in no way 
suggesting that the information provided below is "legally binding" or 
based on any legal precedents.

!! USE WITH CAUTION !!

 "Except as otherwise permitted by the NetMeeting,
 Remote Assistance, and Remote Desktop features
 described below, you may not use the Product to permit
 any Device to use, access, display or run other
 executable software residing on the Workstation
 Computer, nor may you permit any Device to use,
 access, display, or run the Product or Product's user
 interface, unless the Device has a separate license
 for the Product."
 (from: Microsoft Windows XP Pro EULA)
"

This statement, I believe is made from the view that they are currently 
talking to YOU as the licensed END USER and explaining that whilst YOU 
are currently using the allocated licenses and seats, that you may not 
allow "additional" Users/Devices etc to concurrently access the O/S or 
application without the correct external licensing.

In real terms, from the Windows XP User Licensing perspective this is a 
simple answer, No it does not mean the use of Virtual Desktops is 
illegal in their own right. This falls under systems management or 
administration and how you manage and control your systems is up to 
you. If the use of VNC or similar remote desktop solutions to access 
the O/S for the purpose of administration you are still only utilising 
a single user access license of seat.

IL:
 Does this mean that one can't set up their own thin
 clients for Windows systems or use open source remote
 desktop solutions?
