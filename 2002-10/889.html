&gt; Quoting Adam Hawes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ahawes@ihug.com.au">ahawes@ihug.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement
when
&gt; &gt; they
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before, it's
&gt; &gt; unfortunate
&gt; &gt; &gt; that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term for this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; DOWNLOAD is the shorthand!
&gt;
&gt; I've already made this point, I think. It's acceptable shorthand to us,
not
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; True, but an ISP shouldn't exploit the fact that nobody reads the
small
&gt; &gt; print.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They don't exploit it (well they probably do) but people are stupid to
&gt; &gt; sign something that they A: haven't read fully or B: don't understand
&gt; &gt; fully.  There are an abundance of knowledgeable people out there that do
&gt; &gt; understand and can explain.  If they don't understand something, ASK!
&gt; &gt; The ISP is probably more than happy to explain it in simple terms; their
&gt; &gt; helpdesk would do that all day anyway.  If the ISP can't explain in
&gt; &gt; simple terms (or isn't willing to) then the customer should go
&gt; &gt; elsewhere.  Simple.
&gt;
&gt; Fostering mistrust between the consumer and the ISP is the wrong way to
punish
&gt; stupidity.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I need a lawyer to purchase Internet access there's something
terribly
&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong. Hell, if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to
purchase
&gt; &gt; n
&gt; &gt; &gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something
wrong.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you don't have any technical knowledge then you shouldn't be using
&gt; &gt; it!  That would make things considerably better for everyone.  It's like
&gt; &gt; cars.  Everybody who drives a car has at least a small understanding of
&gt; &gt; how the car is built.  They might not be able to service the car, but
&gt; &gt; they still know roughly what makes the car tick.  When they get a flat
&gt; &gt; tyre or run out of fuel they can quickly work out what's going on and
&gt; &gt; remedy the problem.
&gt;
&gt; I didn't say "any". How much technical knowledge should a user have?
Enough so
&gt; that they don't shoot themselves in the foot. Most users don't have that
much,
&gt; but their first learning experience shouldn't be painful.
&gt;
&gt; Who's going to teach them? It's not like a car, where you're taught by
your
&gt; parents (or an instructor). Many users weren't taught this sort of thing
in
&gt; school - I know I wasn't, and I'm fairly young as far as things go.
&gt;
&gt; The same thing happens with cars, anyway. Just look at the mistrust that
&gt; drivers have of mechanics or used car salesmen!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The same is not true with computers.  When they break most people lump
&gt; &gt; them to the service department with the complaint "the hard disk won't
&gt; &gt; load" or something equally stupid.  I am speaking from experience from
&gt; &gt; when I worked in a computer store.
&gt;
&gt; Because they don't know any better, and because if the IT technician tells
them
&gt; to report problems with more detail he'll possibly alienate the customer.
&gt;
&gt; As somebody who's been on the technician side of the desk before, I can
report
&gt; problems in detail, because I know that it's necessary. All the user knows
is
&gt; that it's not working, it used to work, and it's one of those bloody
computer
&gt; things so it's not their fault.
