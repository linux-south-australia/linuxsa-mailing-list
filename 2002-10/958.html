How does IP accounting work?  I will look in to this - it could work just
perfectly for what I need - kill the link @ 7.5GB or something - until I
re-enable it manually as I need it for that month.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to 
&gt; define what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; download  is  reasonably well and not in small print.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but nobody reads the small print. Also, it might 
&gt; make perfect sense
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to you, but that's no guarantee that Joe Blow will 
&gt; understand it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And a guru will understand but not be able to monitor or to 
&gt; some extent even 
&gt; &gt; control their usage.
&gt; &gt; How could one monitor the download value of an hour's 
&gt; websurfing?  I guess you 
&gt; &gt; could empty your browser's cache before commencing to 
&gt; browse and see what you 
&gt; &gt; had collected after you had finished?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if one was really a guru, one might make some ip accounting
&gt; rules to account for all traffice sent and received over the link,
&gt; inluding DNS and other overhead... far more accurate than the browser
&gt; cache...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Similarly, if you are sent html mail which auto-loads from 
&gt; a website (Redhat 
&gt; &gt; used to send me stuff like that) you have no control 
&gt; whatsoever SFAICT.
&gt; &gt; There was a 'fiddle' which might persist, Tel$tra used to 
&gt; charge for the 
&gt; &gt; "backchannel" as well as the download - try monitoring and 
&gt; controlling THAT!
&gt; 
&gt; turn images off, or change mail clients. Yeah, suboptimal solutions,
&gt; but you _do_ have some control. If you want, simply block (using your
&gt; proxy or firewall) all access to the redhat website... :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't think any rational person rejects download limits 
&gt; out of hand.  
&gt; &gt; However, the user must IMHO be able to monitor and control 
&gt; their usage so as 
&gt; &gt; to stay within the cap.
&gt; 
&gt; I recall some ISP once giving a Windows start bar widget which would
&gt; do just that -- in fact, windows these days will tell you how much
&gt; data has been sent and received over each network connection, if you
&gt; click on properties or status or something. Linux will give you way
&gt; more info, but we know that :)
