Registered Memory
Registers delay memory information for one clock cycle to ensure all
communication from the chipset is collected by the clock edge, providing
a controlled delay on heavily loaded memories.

&gt; What does 'registered' RAM mean?  That it is supported by the vendor?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Completely agree, ECC for absolute mission critical stuff (I don't know
&gt; how true this is, but I've been told that once you start getting too far
&gt; over 1GB of memory, one needs to use ECC or thing become unstable...) 
&gt; ECC *is* over-the-top for your average desktop machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Some Intel boards (mostly their really expensive server varieties) will
&gt; not accept memory unless it is ECC and registered.  Obviously, this
&gt; isn't the case here - exchange the memory for normal RDRAM if possible,
&gt; but chances are it was ordered in specifically and is not returnable.

&gt; &gt; Why use ECC RAM?  I quote it up by standard for clients - and it is
&gt; &gt; *significantly* more expensive (or maybe that is also because it is
&gt; &gt; "registered" and somehow supported).  I can see why it is important for
&gt; &gt; mission critical applications - obviously - but are desktop users at a
&gt; loss
&gt; &gt; because RAM is not ECC?  I am not sure if errors occur at random and this
&gt; &gt; can lead to data corruption over time?  I've never had a problem that I
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; detect with errors in RAM - it's always seemed quite reliable to me
&gt; (unless
&gt; &gt; some problems I have had are due to RAM errors but it did not appear that
&gt; &gt; way).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a coworker that owns a pentium iv Dell at home with a dual rim.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It came with 128 MB RDRAM x2 and AFAWK it should work in pairs. He 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently ordered some  256 MB RD RAM to add to the two additional open
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slots, the only difference being the 128 v 256 MB and the fact that
&gt; one 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set of chips  are ECC while the others are not. He did buy Dell RAM
&gt; &gt; chips.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It didn't seem to work after the chips were installed.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; does it work with only the 2 new 256Mb ones?
&gt; &gt; &gt; you should be able to have 2x128 and 2x256
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think you can mix ECC and non-ECC though
&gt; &gt; &gt; (ECC is error correcting BTW, generally good to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; but costs a fair bit more than non-ECC).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yep, also:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Try putting the 128's where the 256's are, and vice versa.
&gt; &gt; or
&gt; &gt; Boot with 2x128's into the BIOS and try turning off any options that
&gt; &gt; relate to ECC.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Long shot, but you never know.
