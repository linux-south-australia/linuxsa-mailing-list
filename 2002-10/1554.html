Hi,

I am not sure if this is related to the issue you are having, but in a 
long and windy way I will try to come up with a possible solution here.

Some time back I noticed that my cdrom drive setup as was 
/dev/cdrecorder symlinked to hdc, mounted at /media/cdrecorder. 
Furthermore, my cdrom burner was /dev/cdrecorder symlinked to sr0 
mounted at /media/cdrom.

First thing I did was delete the existing symlinks and create new 
symlinks that were the reverse of the previous setup.  As a result, 
/dev/cdrecorder was simlinked to sr0 mounted at /media/cdrecorder and 
/dev/cdrom was simlinked to hdc mounted at /media/cdrom.

Being curious, I checked to see if my cdroms would work at this point.   
My cdrom worked under the new settings, but my cdrom burner would not 
read at all.

I then went back into /dev, deleted the existing symlinks and create new 
symlinks with the following settings:   /dev/cdrecorder was simlinked to 
sr1 mounted at /media/cdrecorder and /dev/cdrom was simlinked to sr0 
mounted at /media/cdrom.

I tested both the cdrom and cdrom burner with two read tests and 1 burn 
test, and they worked.


To make the symlink, I used this command, as root:   ln -s /dev/cdrom sr0
                                                                       
                             in -s /dev/cdrecorder sr1



Hopefully this will point you in the right direction, but if not, I hope 
this will help someone else.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm running Debian Testing with a custom 2.4.19 kernel.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I run unstable, 2.4.18 and 2.5.44 and they both work. All I have is
&gt;&gt;hdd=ide-scsi appended.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For some reason, my ide-scsi doesn't work under my 2.5.44 kernel.  I
&gt;haven't had the time yet to delve into exactly why.  I do have the
&gt;ide-scsi module compiled, and hdx=ide-scsi in my lilo append, but
&gt;there's some other issue.  Could somebody here post their .config?
&gt;There's a LOT of things that don't compile and I'm looking forward to
&gt;the cleanup that inevitably occurs once feature freeze hits.
