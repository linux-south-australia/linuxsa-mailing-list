&gt; Ah, bugger! Daryl: 2, Google: 1. Me: 0. D'oh!

Wow.  The other quote from the movie that I was going to use - "Jack
Butler's gonna love you &lt;Queue fierce guitar solo&gt;" (sans fierce guitar
solo) - got half a dozen hits yesterday, but only one today.  Weird.
Maybe Google did a refresh.

&gt; Deakin and other v4 servers might, but there's a lot of extra
&gt; work involved in setting up v4 public-key authentication, and so I doubt
&gt; they would unless one was of sufficient importantance.

I was thinking that there would be too much maintenance effort on their
part to set up a public/private key pair with everyone that wanted to
synchronise with them ("won't someone think of the CPU cycles?").

&gt;&gt; Gazes at the machine set aside for his next firewall, with a year's
&gt;&gt; worth of dust sitting on it.

&gt; Heh, yes..
&gt; 
&gt; /me gazes at the empty space where my Linux-based OGG player will one
&gt; day proudly sit, once I've worked out if it actually is feasable, found
&gt; a spare SE iMac to do the job, and found the time to set it up..

I did set up my to-be-firewall box as a FreeBSD music jukebox with 80
Gig of IDE disk (partly mirrored, and one large 70G volume, bless you Vinum),
with a 5 stacker SCSI CDROM.  Worked a treat on a lowly 166 MMX.  After
having my entire CD collection thieved earlier a few months ago, I'm now
pretty keen to keen to backup[1] the replacements onto a server sitting
in the cellar and serving the house with music (even if I have to load
the wife's stuff on there as well - if it came to a battle between King
Crimson and Mariah Carey, I know who my money's on[2]).
