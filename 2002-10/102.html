&gt;Batch mode rsync?

Interesting, but rsync is probably not appropriate for this task.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you know of an open source filesystem that can perform similar 
&gt;&gt;log-file replication of Maildir-style messages across a network on two 
&gt;&gt;servers at once, I'd like to hear about it! (Software RAID over 
&gt;&gt;Network-Block-Devices doesn't count).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Can you draw a picture of this challenge? I aren't sure what you mean by
&gt;"two servers at once". I suspect batch mode rsync might do it, but I may
&gt;have misunderstood.
&gt;
Here's the outline:

A large maildir-based mail server carries approximately 1 million files 
(email messages).
When mail is delivered, a file is created.
When mail is read, a file is either moved (same partition), or moved and 
then deleted.
The contents of the file never change for the sake of this exercise.
The filename may change as a result of IMAP tampering (read, replied, etc)
The file may be read/moved by different applications using the maildir 
standard

Here's the challenge:

When a file is created, create the same file on another server
When a file is renamed, moved, or deleted, perform the same operation on 
another server
When the other server is unavailable, queue the operation to be 
performed later.

Intended result: a near-realtime mirror of a production mail server, for 
redundancy and load-balancing purposes.

What I don't want to do is run any tool (like rsync, tar, dump, find) 
that needs to go and stat 1 million inodes every time it runs (except 
potentially as a check in the middle of the night). It should be enough 
that the creation/modification of a file can trigger a replication for 
that file alone. It can also be assumed that the data in the file never 
changes, so it's always a create/rename/destroy operation, and 
calculating CRC for comparison etc is a waste of time.

Because the data in each file doesn't change, there's an opportunity for 
near-realtime backup that would be difficult with an mbox-style system.

I envisage that something like this could be hacked into the mail server 
and POP3/IMAP daemons (in fact, I've done it already as a limited test) 
but it occurs to me that someone may have already done a better job of 
this, and it's more flexible at the filesystem level (ie: I can manually 
'rm' a big email, for example).

The raid-over-network-block-device satisfies the criteria above, but 
isn't very flexible when it comes to a server failure, or deliberate 
downtime. Any system that involves a comparison method on a filesystem 
of this size is going to be tricky to synchronise without suspending 
mail delivery as well.
