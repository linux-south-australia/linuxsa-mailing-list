Watchdog eyes broadband limits
Kate Mackenzie
OCTOBER 15, 2002 	
	
BROADBAND download limits are coming under scrutiny as the
Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman questions the capping policies of
major telcos.

With many broadband customers facing larger than expected bills, deputy
ombudsman Vic Marles has confirmed 26 cases relating to data downloads are
under investigation. 

"We have had a number of complaints about bills for excess usage, which
appear to arise as a result of misunderstandings about what is included in
usage and what isn't," she said. 

"For example, many consumers think usage only includes files or programs
that they download over the internet. They don't realise that just opening a
web page will contribute to their usage." 

The TIO advised new broadband users to check their usage continually.

Analyst Shara Evans from Telesyte said usage limits were one of the key
factors holding back broadband take-up in Australia. 

"From everyone I've talked to, particularly on the residential side, it does
seem to be a concern. Mum and dad don't know what a megabyte is. They know
it's information, but they don't know what it means," she said. 

The Federal Government's Broadband Advisory Group, created in February to
report back to Communications Senator Richard Alston in December, has raised
bandwidth costs as one of the factors affecting broadband take-up. 

Both Telstra and Optus originally went to market with unlimited downloads on
their broadband services, but first Telstra and then Optus moved to
introduce capped plans, with Optus throttling speeds after the limit was
reached, rather than charging for excess downloads. 

Plans allowing downloads of as little as 300Mb per month are now widespread,
as ISPs try to push down entry-level prices to stimulate take-up. 

And several smaller ADSL ISPs have recently modified offers of unlimited
off-peak downloads. 

WA-based iiNet introduced unlimited plans that offered unlimited off-peak
downloads three months ago, but last week it reorganised its plans as
throughput began to suffer. 

Similarly, Pacific Internet moved to reduce its unlimited off-peak options
to 512k and 256k accounts only, saying the faster 1.5Mb connections used too
much of the available bandwidth, causing traffic problems for other
subscribers. 

Telstra and Optus have long insisted the vast majority of users do not
require large amounts of data, but debate has raged as to whether download
limits will impede Australia's ability to make the most of new applications.


"The industry still has to settle on business models that look after
high-data applications," Service Providers Industry Association chair Phil
Singleton said. 

"My theory is that the business model will have evolved, and it may be that
you pay differently for different types of content."
