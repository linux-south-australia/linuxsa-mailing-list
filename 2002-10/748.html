This is normal recommended practice -- dedicate a machine to
routing/filtering, and use it to protect the rest of your network
services. Often, you'd have at least two network services machines --
one which is a "bastian" host, which is somewhat visible to the
outside world, and does incoming mail, web serving, external DNS, and
anything else that's needed on the outside, and then you have your
internal server, which does internal mail (so the external one just
transfers mail direct to the internal mail server), and squid,
intranet, file storage, internal DNS, and so on. This way, your
firewall box has no services, and hence is pretty secure, your box
with services visible is protected by the firewall, and is in turn,
firewalled off from the internal network (you use three networks on
your firewall -- internal, external, and DMZ, or De-Militarized Zone),
and your internal network is completely protected from the outside.

&gt; 
&gt; Another machine could then do the logging, analysis, etc..

Some people also have an administrative network, or at least, a
specific machine that has special access to the key machines, which
does the logging, runs analysis, and is the only one allowed to do
certain admin tasks.

            |
           LAN

The Firewall box is effectively a router with packet filtering -- you
can use Linux or whatever. It's connected directly to the Internet,
through some sort of modem or access device. From the internet, only
certain ports on the Bastian are visible. It doesn't really matter if
your proxy is dual homed as drawn above or not -- but it's generally
important to be sure that it and the LAN aren't visible from outside.

The general principle here is to ensure that there are no single
points of failure -- an attacker needs to break at least two things to
get in to the LAN...

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible to have an old Pentium 133 with no hard 
&gt; &gt; drive boot off
&gt; &gt; &gt; another machine to be used a firewall?  Then a small 
&gt; &gt; partition could be set
&gt; &gt; &gt; aside - say a GB or two for smoothwall (or whatever) on the 
&gt; &gt; host machine.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unless someone has some old hard drives lying around.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why not just have it boot off a floppy or cdrom?  It'll dump 
&gt; &gt; everything into 
&gt; &gt; ram and then not access anything anymore.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Diskless fw's are bad news -&gt; if your other machine is 
&gt; &gt; compromised then you 
&gt; &gt; lose it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; But this would save space and noise if it is diskless - I 
&gt; &gt; could probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; cram it in somewhere unobtrusive..
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible to 'flatten' a motherboard so cards are not 
&gt; &gt; at right angles
&gt; &gt; &gt; so one can fit it in a small box?  I don't know if PCI cables exist?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; YOu can get little risers to put them at right angles but 
&gt; &gt; they can get 
&gt; &gt; cranky.
