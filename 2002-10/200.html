Just to add my $0.02 worth on this thread, another way to contribute is
just to get involved in Opensource events. I have taken this approach by
getting involved with this years Installfest. So all you gurus at
installations register your support on the day at
<A HREF="http://installfest.spyderweb.com.au/">http://installfest.spyderweb.com.au/</A> as a helper and help out on the day.

&gt; Funny you should mention that. Along these lines the other
&gt; night I partly
&gt; finished a HOWTO document aimed at helping people produce
&gt; better feedback,
&gt; including debugging and trivial fixes to stuff. Someone who
&gt; has doodled
&gt; with hundreds of packages at the ./configure level and traced through
&gt; complicated log files and crash records can handle C if they stop and
&gt; think about it. But a lot of really competent Unix users
&gt; never quite get
&gt; to the point of using the code they have available. I'm thinking of
&gt; calling it HOWTO Use the Source.
&gt;
&gt; I know there is a big difference between a monster package
&gt; like Mozilla
&gt; and some little commandline utility, but still there are
&gt; quite a few ways
&gt; of using the source to good effect.
