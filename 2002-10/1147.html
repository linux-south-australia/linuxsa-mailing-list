&gt;&gt; Here we have super flash bang sales people teling me to buy the latest
&gt;&gt; greatest phone with "absolutely fabulous" games that will make my life
&gt;&gt; "so much better".
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Which is clearly marketeer's drivel, but...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  When in fact the current crop of phone games are no
&gt;&gt; better than games that are 20 years old.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ... the games *do* run on a device which fits on the palm of your hand,
&gt;  which also lets you communicate in near-realtime with someone almost
&gt; anywhere on the planet, and lasts for at least a week between needing
&gt; to  be connected to a wall outlet. I think that is pretty cool.. :)

Yes, but how 'powerful' is that device in the palm of your hand compared
to say a Commodore 64? It's like comparing the lunar module to a
calculator.

&gt; And remember, the gaming industry industry had a huge role on in
&gt; pushing  the envelope for desktop hardware. Game requirments drive
&gt; hardware  developers to create faster, more powerful everythings
&gt; (CPU's, memory,  GFX cards, networking equipment, etc, etc).
&gt;
&gt; One can only hope that the gaming industry on phones will have the same
&gt;  effect. Maybe games will be responsible for driving the demand up for
&gt; GPRS and G3-like services enough that high-speed Internet access from
&gt; your phone might one day become affordable. That would be great!

Great, just what I need, Quake III on my Nokia!
