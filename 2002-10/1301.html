I wonder what percentage of UNIX applications are available
via the Internet.

There's been a slow move of business applications from
mainframes to UNIX.  To some extent this has also been
related to a fall in the number of applications (bespoke HR
software sets being replaced by SAP, PSoft, etc).

But there's still a lot of bespoke software out there, and a
lot of it is of significant size (groups of 300 programmers
can be found in the larger gov't departments).  A lot of
this software runs on MVS today, but the next rewrite of
that software will probably see it run on Linux [1].

A lot of bespoke software also runs on VMS, and those
OS users must be wondering why they've yet to be shafted,
or if that is what "no function enhancement after 2002"
means.  Waiting for the axe to fall isn't the best of
strategic positions.

Whether this counts or not depends why you what to know the
number of UNIX applications.

Cheers,
Glen

  [1] Because these systems take a long time time to
      write and are in service for decades.  You can
      guaruntee that Linux will be around in 15 years
      (because that might at most cost 30 of those 300
      programmers to persoanlly ensure).  And IBM have
      made the choice of the next target operating system
      really easy for MVS shops; unlike moving to Solaris
      you don't have integrate your software, hardware and
      networking developments, but can evolve them independently.
      This significantly reduces programme risk.
