&gt; I am currently using mbox (Mailbox) already, and as I understand, this
&gt; is what the majority of MUA's support. My concern is to what I would
&gt; need to change to run Maildir. (or is this what you meant?)

MUAs really have nothing to do with how mail is stored on the server,
unless you're using something like Mutt or Pine that interacts with it
directly.

&gt; But going back to what you said, I guess you mean use courier IMAP or
&gt; similar, but is this instead of qmail or on top of qmail?
&gt; and how would that work?

Qmail/Postfix/Sendmail are mail transfer agents. They listen on the
network for SMTP connections and then save the email that is received to
disk, in whatever format it is set up to save. Qmail typically saves to
Maildir, Sendmail typically saves to mbox and Postfix can easily be set to
either.

IMAP/POP are mail retrieval protocols. They read the mail files on the
disk and hand them to the mail user agent. As long as the POP or IMAP
server you are using supports the format the messages are saved in
(Maildir/mbox) then it does not matter one little bit what actual MTA
software you are running.

As far as I know, Courier IMAP is the only IMAP server (which also comes
with a POP server btw) that supports Maildir. UW-IMAP is a common one for
accessing mbox stores.

&gt; &gt; We run maildir and
&gt; &gt; our webmail uses IMAP. All works fine.
&gt;
&gt; IMAP is all a bit unclear in my head, and I dont want to enter into
&gt; trial and error methods, since we already have clients using the box
&gt; and dont want to loose mail or have a long downtime trying new things.

You can think of IMAP as an enhanced type of POP retrieval. With POP you
generally download your mail to your MUA and then delete it from the
server. With IMAP the mail stays on the server and any folders you create
on the mail account are actually created on the server. IMAP is ***WAY***
better for webmail type setups. POP has no concept at all of server side
folders, so it would really only be good for where you occasionally need
to read your email when you're not in the office and your regular mail
client.

Hope that helps

Darryl
