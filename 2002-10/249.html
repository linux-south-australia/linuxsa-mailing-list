Hi Richard,

I thought most folks had heard about the horrible time subscribers were 
having trying to get connected. Sometimes I had to ring in 20 times to 
get through to the network, and it would come back saying invalid or 
something like that, but actually never even getting into the AirNet 
equipment, just kicked off by the Telstra gear (a Network Terminal Unit 
I think it is called). Other times we would be bounced off for no 
apparent reason, 1 minute, 10 minute, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, wham 
bamm, you're off this line!

It all added money to Telstra so they didn't seem to be too perturbed 
by the problem, or so it seemed to those affected by it.

I spoke to Colvin a couple of times and he said had a torrid time 
trying to get the PTB to firstly listen to him and then to accept that 
it was Telstra's problem not AirNet. He told me that their boardroom 
looked more like a war room than a business place &lt;G&gt;

As soon as I get the chance to work through months of bills for the 6 
accounts I intend to be asking Telstra for some relief from the charges 
for these useless calls. Apparently AirNet and other subscribers are 
going to try to get some recompense off them too.

Cheers,  Ian
