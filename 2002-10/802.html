&gt; &gt; Yeah, I remember recommending to a friend back when the pentium came out
&gt; &gt; to get a 6x86 instead. I said "the floating point is slow, but that
&gt; &gt; doesn't matter because all the games use integer maths". Then what
&gt; &gt; happened? Everything started using floating point since it ran fine on
&gt; &gt; the pentium 1s :(
&gt; 
&gt; Everything, that is, except the things that didn't -- compiling,
&gt; networking, file serving, mail, http serving, etc... (unless I'm
&gt; mistaken...) AFAIK, you only use the FPU when you're doing certain
&gt; things, like simulating the real world (eg many games), using random
&gt; numbers, and so on.

Ok sorry, my bad wording. This was back before I had heard of linux or
unix, and was mainly just a big game head and used my pc primarily for
games (althogh I did do a bit of coding etc). I should have said most of
what my mate wanted to use his machine for (games, and 3d studio
rendering) was floating point. Actually Im not sure about 3ds, but i
assume it would be floating point.
