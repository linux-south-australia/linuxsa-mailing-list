&gt; When non-Internet people think of downloading, they think of clicking 
&gt; the "Download" link and pulling down a file. They /don't/ think of how much 
&gt; browsing is costing them, or what the gazillion spyware programs on their PC 
&gt; are doing, or of how much porn their husband is watching. Is real-time 
&gt; streaming downloading? How about online shopping?

But don't all ISPs have a usage meter for your account and/or some sort
of arrangement to tell you when you're getting near your limit for the
month?

&gt; This sort of think isn't immediately obvious to people who don't understand the 
&gt; underlying protocols.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the ISP isn't being deliberately misleading, but the user isn't "stupid" 
&gt; either.
&gt; 
&gt; "3000 megabytes of inbound data a month!" doesn't mean very much to most users, 
&gt; which makes an ISP's job significantly more difficult when preparing 
&gt; advertising.

Maybe the average schmuck should do some research before they sign the
contract!  Computers/Internet are not for the uneducated.  If you don't
understand (at least a little) how it actually works you shouldn't be
using it.

If they get stung for excess usage then its their own fault for not
looking into what usage is.  We all know what 3G/mo downloads is, and as
someone already said, that could mean what happens when you select
"download" in Internet Exploiter (if you don't know jack!).  If you're
using the net and haven't bothered to find out at least the very basics
of its functionality then you deserve to be burned with an excess usage
fee.

As DSL (???) said earlier, why should people be protected from their own
stupidity.  Stupidity is probably too harsh a word (but applies in most
cases) when a lot of people are simply naive/ignorant.

Oh well, that's my grunt about it. I always get annoyed when the
stupid/naive/ignorant (choose your own adjective out of those) want to
be compensated for their stupidity in some way!  I wish they'd just make
some effort to learn something about the things they're trying to do!

Cheers,
Adam
