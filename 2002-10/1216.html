Hi All,
    It depends on what you mean by "inherently insecure" I
suppose. Most of the most famous "hacks" (cracks) and
insecurities I know of were more exploits of already known
problems that were not plugged because there were not that
many techno vandals out there and the mentality of most
sysadmins at the time (read 70s-80s) was that it isn't a
problem so we won't do anything about it. The Internet Worm
of the 80s (I think, may have been early 90s) was one such
exploit of a known problem. This mentality has markedly
changed as more people gained access to the net. Now, as
problems are found they are usually addressed fairly
quickly.

    In reference to "The Cuckoos Egg", in many cases the
easy targets for crackers (ie those slack sysadmins who
don't patch their machines regularly etc) often are not
worth breaking into except to use as a jump off point to
break into another machine. This doesn't mean that the *nix
system is "inherently" insecure, it means that sysadmin has
failed to make it secure as problems are discovered.

    Often the techniques used to break into systems are
brute force methods based on exploiting programmers honest
assumptions like sending 4 times as much data to a port than
the worst case the protocol says can ever be sent under
normal circumstances. Of course it might break, but if you
hit anything with a big enough hammer it will break. Is this
"inherently" insecure. You can design almost any system to
be failsafe, as long as someone isn't deliberately trying to
fail it. Programmers are more wary now of safeguarding such
buffer overflow attacks, but until people started trying to
break into the system, it was never a problem.

    Much of the information in "The Cuckoos Egg" is about
people deliberately trying to break into these systems, and
trying everything until they find something that works. Give
a vandal enough time and the right tools and they will get
in anywhere, especially if the payoff is big enough.

    Another thing to take into account is the fact that
technology has changed so rapidly that what was once secure
now isn't. Take encryption for example. Remember when 64bit
encryption was illegal to have outside the U.S.? Now anyone
can have it and it is still technically illegal in Australia
to have better than 64 bit encryption. What makes this a bit
of a joke is that now that cluster technology is widespread,
64 bit encryption can be broken in a few hours to a few
minutes. Is this "inherently" insecure - no, technology has
overtaken more rapidly than thought possible previously.

    Just on the encryption bit, in 1998, a Flinders Uni
student was visited by the Federal Police and asked to
remove his research project from the public domain because
it broke the (Australian) Federal Law of using greater than
64 bit encryption. He had as part of his Thesis demonstrated
256 bit encryption techniques. This was illegal even though
he had independently researched the techniques and other 256
bit techniques were then available in the public domain in
Europe. Would this be a case of "inherent" insecurity?
Making it illegal to secure your system might be seen as
such.

    Finally, ask the "gent" if he has ever heard of Suse
Linux, that is definitely controlled in Europe. Linux
invented by a Finlander, as opposed to Windoze (USA) or
MacOS (USA) or MacOS X (BSD based but Berkley is in
California).

    I would agree that Red Hat Linux is arguably the most
popular distribution of Linux outside of Europe, but since
each distribution is about 98% the same, does this mean that
a whopping 2% that is genuinely American has poisoned Linux
forever everywhere else in the world? People like Linus and
Richard Sharpe may live and work in America, but I think
that might be because that is where the money is, not that
they are controlled by George W.

    I think the best suggestion to this "gent" is to use
Minix by Andrew Tannenbaum. It is European. It is as secure
as any other product available, and you can get it
relatively easily.

    Anyhow, I hope this has helped stimulate discussion on
this topic and given you a few ideas to take elsewhere. It
is by no means all the arguments you could use, but it
raises a few points.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Is *nix and Linux inherently secure?


&gt; In a recent discussion in other forums we have been
talking about why
&gt; Linux and other *nix derivatives have been such a poor
harvest for
&gt; hackers. I was under the impression that it is because of
the inherent
&gt; security protocols built into the OS.
&gt;
&gt; Other disagreed with me as in the following response I
got;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; So you haven't read Cuckoo's Egg then ;-)
&gt; Its only "secure" because its not worth anyone's time
hacking it &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; or this BS response when one gent asked for an OS that was
European in
&gt; nature and secure as anything; I said to him,
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt; We have it already, it is called Linux
&gt;
&gt; His response;
&gt; &lt;&lt; Full of holes, and controlled from the USA... might as
well call it
&gt; Lindows...&lt;G&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So, without starting a flame war here, got any sensible
responses to
&gt; share with these folks?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
