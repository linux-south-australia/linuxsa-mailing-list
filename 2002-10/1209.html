&gt; OK heres a scenareo:
&gt; 
&gt; You have a critical server that has 350 days uptime on it. It has a
&gt; small ups. The ups starts screaming, and you figure this is because the
&gt; battery is probably stuffed, and it could use a replacement. Before
&gt; ordering the replacement, you kick it, and it starts working fine again.
&gt; What do you do? :)

It's a critcal system, so the machine has two power supplies :-)
Move one to the unfiltered mains.
Now call the UPS vendor to arrange maintenance.

More usefully:

Screaming noises were probably a coil oscillating. Kicking it
upset the self-reinforcing oscillation.  Obvious position of
a coil in a UPS is the transformer.

Bad news is that the coil is usualy moved out-of-spec by the
strength of the oscillation, as the material the coil is
wrapped around is usually shattered.  As that material also
often provides insulation, I wouldn't be leaving the UPS
in service.

If it were me I'd be claiming a "dangerous" condition and
dropping the server during the next idle time (like 3AM)
and moving temporarily to the unfiltered mains.  It's a risk
assessment issue, and I'm really adverse to UPSs that might
overheat (with resulting smoke and acid issues that might
effect other machines in the computing facility).

You need to make your own assessment of the risks and then
act.  Expensive UPSs keeps internal statistics that can help
with this assessment (like the input and output voltages at
the transformer).  I'm not sure if these have propogated
down to smaller UPSs.

And get two power supplies on you next machine.

Best wishes,
Glen
