I wouldn't say that. I can, and actually do spend most of my days, 
writing web apps using Servlets and/or JSP, bundle them up as a WAR 
(Web-application ARchive) and install it on Linux (i386, ppc, a few 
others that you mentioned), FreeBSD, Solaris, MacOSX, Windows and more. 
I'd say that is moderately portable.

The problem you seem to have is that you really do need a decent (read: 
Java2 compatible) runtime to achieve this, which you don't seem to be 
able to get on Linux/Alpha. IIRC, only v2.3 Servlet spec says that Java2 
is required. Earlier versions of the spec should be able to run on v1.1 
runtimes, so you still may be able to find a servlet engine or an 
extensible Java web server that runs on a 1.1 JVM. You only then need to 
find a framework which also supports this config and you're fine, but 
again, most moder ones will require at least Java2.

I agree it sucks that there is no 100% useful free Java2 implementation, 
but I think the lack of good JVMs for some of the more esoteric Linux 
arch's is not because of Suns (terrible) licensing, but because of the 
sheer complexity and size of actually writing it. The JVM is complex, 
the API is huge, and getting good performance requires a good JIT like 
HotSpot which makes the JVM look like a walk in the park.

It is coming toghether, however. GCJ (a JVM implementation, compiler, 
and more) and Classpath (an implementation of the API) are coming along 
quite nicely and JITs like ShuJIT, OpenJIT and the like show a lot of 
promise.

But, I'd suggest that if you want to use a nice, existing framework to 
do server-side webapps, then you're going to need Java2. If you can't 
get that for Linux/Alpha and you can't use another arch, then you are 
probably going to want to keep on using PHP. Of course there's nothing 
stopping you from writing your own 1.1 or GJC+Classpath compatible 
webapp framework from scratch, but that probably wasn't what you're 
looking to do.

HTH,

PS: For those who went to the AUUG meeting to hear Glen Turner talk 
about IPv6 earlier this month, IPv6 support *is* available in Sun's v1.4 
JDK/JRE. Yay!
