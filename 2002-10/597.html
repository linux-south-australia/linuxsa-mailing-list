Hi.

With all due respect, and not wanting to start another ide vs scsi war :)

in the last 2 years I have had more scsi drives die than ide (We had a bad
batch from the IBM plant in Hungary), but even ignoring this distortion, I
have to say that I have not had an ide drive die at anything like around a
year after install. Years (2-5), yes. But not all ide drives by any means.
There's a couple in a RedHat 4.2 box I can think of that must be years
old!

I have ide drives in mailservers (shock!) and quite a few general purpose
servers around the organisation. They work fine, and whilst there _may_ be
speed issues with more heavily laden servers than these, as a general rule
the benefits of cost and simplicity outweigh the counter benefits in the
scsi camp of speed and robustness.

Where we have a heavy-hitting database with many users, we use multi
processors and a many-spindle scsi disk array, but the benefits on a more
simple requirement, with a lower load are just not enough to justify the
significant extra expense.

So if you're building a server that isn't going to be thrashed to an inch
of it's life, I'd use ide and use the savings on the memory, processor and
network. Even if your load increases to the point where an upgrade to scsi
is required, the old ide drives can be used elsewhere, and you're not
throwing much away if you don't!

My 2c,

Michael

&gt; &gt;&gt;When it comes to building a server I would not even consider ATA.
&gt; &gt;&gt;The fact that most SCSI drives come with 5yr warrenty vs 6months
&gt; &gt;&gt;/1 year for OEM IDE drives.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I beg to differ!  You certainly can get a 1 year warranty on hard
&gt; &gt;drives but 3 years is what we get on all our drives (unless we opt
&gt; &gt;for 1 year - which we don't).  Most of our drives are well and
&gt; &gt;truly cycled by three years.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahh warrenty is irrelevant when comparing between SCSI and IDE drives, the
&gt; figure you both should be concentrating on is Mean Time Between Failture
&gt; (MTBF).   Undoubtly the IDE drives are fast approaching the speed of the
&gt; SCSI disks, but leave a IDE drive running 24/7 on average for more than 2-3
&gt; years and they will die why ?
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at the 10k Seagate SCSI drives they have a *spec'd*  MTBF of
&gt; 1.2x10^6 hours or 50,000 days continous operation (136 years by my
&gt; calculator), but this is not taking into account poor (note crap) air
&gt; circulation around the drives in many pre-rolled servers.   This is many
&gt; times the length of the SCSI warrenty period, like over 27 times.
&gt; 
&gt; You will *not* find this information on the Seagate site [1] for their
&gt; ATA100 drives, so one would have to assume 8760 hrs (1 year) which is many
&gt; times less than the SCSI (~136x).   If you were to use your PC for 4 hours
&gt; every day then with a MTBF for IDE drives of 8760 hrs the drive would last
&gt; approximately 6 years which seems about right in my personal experience.
&gt; 
&gt; You will get IDE drives that exceed the MTBF, these are the exception or
&gt; what is commonly called "Wednesday Afternoon" drives where the quality of
&gt; the drives produced seems to miraculously increase for some reason.   So
&gt; IDE drives may last *7 years continous* but you cannot be guarenteed of
&gt; this.
&gt; 
&gt; So if you consider rolling out IDE RAID servers for *real* production use
&gt; aim at replacing the entire array every 12months, this will give you the
&gt; added advantage of boosting the array size as drive capacities keep
&gt; increasing.   Otherwise roll out a SCSI array which you will have to
&gt; replace in around 5-7 years, mainly due to lack of available storage.
&gt; 
&gt; For a home server you have the option of replacing drives or turning the
&gt; machine off, the choice is up to you.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
