&gt; A long post, but I found this to work very well. It came from "Ant" alias 
&gt; Anthony Symons. You have to adapt it to your situation.

&gt; 
&gt; 1. quick, simple, wastefull way
&gt; 
&gt; assuming drive is hda.
&gt; install new drive as hdc or other drive.
&gt; 
&gt; dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc
&gt; 
&gt; wait.
&gt; 
&gt; You'll get a partition of the same size as what you had. It should be
&gt; bootable.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Better more complex way.
&gt; 
&gt; Get a rescue cd.
&gt; 
&gt; Install new drive as (say) hdc
&gt; 
&gt; boot system
&gt; 
&gt; as root: fdisk /dev/hdc
&gt; make partitions as you want them. (usually a /boot a / and a swap. you
&gt; need to change the type of the swap partition to type linux swap. Keep
&gt; them in the same order as the original drive, else be prepared to have
&gt; to modify /etc/fstab.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll assume hda1 is boot hda2 is swap and hda3 is root. This may not be
&gt; the case in your system. Try not to get partitions confused when your
&gt; data is at stake!
&gt; 
&gt; Make file systems:
&gt; 
&gt; mke2fs /dev/hda1
&gt; mke2fs /dev/hda3
&gt; mkswap /dev/hda2

They all should be the destination drive - hdc!

Ant
 
&gt; If your using different file systems, use the appropriate tool for them.
&gt; 
&gt; make a temp dir to mount your new drive on, and do so. Same with your
&gt; boot partition:
&gt; 
&gt; mkdir /mnt/hdc
&gt; mount /dev/hdc3 /mnt/hdc
&gt; mkdir /mnt/hdc/boot
&gt; mount /dev/hdc1 /mnt/hdc/boot
&gt; 
&gt; Use tar to preserve ownership and permissions to transfer partitions.
&gt; Use 1 filesystem flag to stop it recursivly copying itself.
&gt; 
&gt; cd /mnt/hdc
&gt; tar -cplf - -C / . | tar -xpvf -
&gt; 
&gt; The first tar will (c) create a tarball, with (p) permission info (which
&gt; is usually the default, but dont count on it) (l) on one file system
&gt; (that a lowercase L, not a 1) (f -) to a file which is stdout. (-C /)
&gt; change to the root directory first. Then . means current directory,
&gt; which due to the -C / will be the root dir.
&gt; 
&gt; The second tar will then (x) extract the tarball, with (p) permissions,
&gt; and a (v) verbose file listing so you can see it is working, and (f -)
&gt; from the file stdin. Your allready in the the directory/partition where
&gt; you want it to go, so it'll copy all the data over with permissions.
&gt; 
&gt; Then you'll need to do the same for the boot partition.
&gt; 
&gt; cd /mnt/hdc/boot
&gt; tar -cplf - -C /boot . | tar -xpvf -
&gt; 
&gt; You should have this sussed now.
&gt; 
&gt; Now umount /mnt/hdc/boot and /mnt/hdc, and shut down your system.
&gt; 
&gt; Set up the new drive as hda, and store the old drive 'till your sure it
&gt; worked. Boot off the rescue cd. Make a space to mount the new file
&gt; systems (you need to configure the bootloader). Something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; cd /mnt
&gt; mkdir hda
&gt; mount /dev/hda3 hda
&gt; cd hda
&gt; mount /dev/hda1 boot
&gt; 
&gt; Now, presuming lilo, do
&gt; 
&gt; lilo -r .
&gt; 
&gt; You are in the root of your new drive and the -r . tells lilo to use the
&gt; current directory as the root of the system. This puts it all in to
&gt; perspective for lilo since things are mounted abnormally at this stage.
&gt; 
&gt; Lilo should list the kernels, and return your prompt. cd back off this
&gt; drive, umount it all and reboot. That should be it.
&gt; 
&gt; If your using grub, then it can be a bit more confusing. I'll leave it
&gt; here becase this has turned in to a bit of an epic allready!
&gt; 
&gt; Needless to say, all these commands have a man page, and I suggest you
&gt; read them and make sure you understand what your doing before you begin.
&gt; You dont want to get half way and get stuck, although provided you havnt
&gt; accidentally trashed any of your original drive you should be able to
&gt; just go back to where you were.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. dead easy/non linux way
&gt; 
&gt; Get the personal version of norton ghost. Make a boot disk. Run it. Use
&gt; the menu options to clone disk, and select to make the partitions large.
&gt; 
&gt; Ant
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; As the title states, i've just tried everything in the book to ghost a
&gt; &gt; redhat 7.3 across to an identical drive.  It boots up until it tries to
&gt; &gt; mount one of the ext3 partitions.  Then it all goes pearshaped and does a
&gt; &gt; kernel panic:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Loading ext3 module
&gt; &gt; Mounting /proc filesystem
&gt; &gt; Creating root device
&gt; &gt; Mounting root filesystem
&gt; &gt; EXT3 - fs : journal inode is deleted
&gt; &gt; mount:  error 22 mounting ext3
&gt; &gt; pivotroot: pivot_root(/sysroot, /sysroot/initd) failed: 2
&gt; &gt; Freeing unused kernel memory: 280k freed
&gt; &gt; Kernel panic: No init found: try passing init = option to kernel
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any ideas, gurus?  How do i clone a this disc?  I've tried going to an
&gt; &gt; image and back again. I've tried the switch in ghost that says do a
&gt; &gt; 'bit-wise' copy but it compains and says that the destination drive is too
&gt; &gt; small, when i reality it's the same drive (model, brand, size, even the
&gt; &gt; same day bought
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; :)).  I tried the option that says clone unused space as well and this
&gt; &gt; : still
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; didn't boot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt; &gt; Matthew
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS:  perhaps ghost is not the thing to use here, is there alternatives?
