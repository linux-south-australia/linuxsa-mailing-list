&gt; &gt; Nearly all the causes I have seen mentioned are overseas ones. And yet

&gt; Interesting.

&gt; Maybe this could be done in quite a direct and relevant fashion...
&gt; perhaps donations could be used to buy equipment and/or books for
&gt; hackers. I can't think how it would work, but it's an idea.

One of the most important things for open source projects is fresh blood.

We need new, young, faces being involved in various projects. In the Samba 
team we now have a 19yo in Canberra, a 17/18yo in BC/Alberta and an 18yo 
from Holland (who was not legally allowed to drink when he was at CIFS2002 
in San Jose, but someone got him a beer anyway).

Now, most of the hackers who have been at this for a while are reasonably 
well set up, but I am sure there are lots of younger people out there who 
would get involved if they got some encouragement.

So, why don't you raise funds to establish an open source hacking 
competition, where:

  The competition involves hacking a new open source program, or
  making some improvement of an existing package

  The reward is a computer, or some significant piece of equipment or
  something like that. Of course, there is also the recognition.
