&gt; &gt;I had a look at that when it was first released a year (or two, or
&gt; &gt;three..) ago. Looks pretty good, and, I would imagine, would work well
&gt; &gt;in a portal situation. I'm not really sure, though -- is there a
&gt; &gt;client for Tarantella other than the Java-based web client?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I'd also be interested in knowing how well it would (or wouldn't) cope
&gt; &gt;with appliances like the Compaq T20. Tarantella has its own protocol,
&gt; &gt;right? So, I'll assume that I won't be able to use the in-built
&gt; &gt;clients[1] that are already on the T20 (other than IE)?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There is no client for Windows CE [T20's OS] However I use it fine through
&gt; "internet exploder 4.0".

OK. The T20 runs IE anyhow, so that wouldn't be a problem.

&gt; Netscape can't cope. see <A HREF="http://www.tarantella.com/download/clients/">http://www.tarantella.com/download/clients/</A> for a
&gt; List of clients.

Hmm. I'm not quite sure what to make of this; on one hand, it's not at
all surprising, when you consider the fact that Netscape 4.x is a
loathable piece of skit. On the other hand, it defeats the purpose of
having a Java-based web client. If it still only runs in IE...

&gt; If you using a Windows CE machine can you not just use the standard RDP
&gt; client from these machines?

What, to connect to Tarantella? I didn't think that it was compatible
with RDP.

If, on the other hand, you mean on the local LAN, then yes, you
could. It's not those that I'm worried about so much. They can all get
on to the server pretty much regardless of what it runs. I'm more
worried about the travelling executive or even the travelling
minion. Either way, they still need access to their desktops.

The more I investigate this, the more it seems that I'll need to
mandate IE as the browser when connecting to the Terminal Server. It
really doesn't look like there are other viable options, except,
perhaps, HOB.
