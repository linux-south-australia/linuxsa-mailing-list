Well, yes and no. 

I (just a user and not an expert) took it as a way of expressing the 
very real difference between Linux and Apache. Linux is basically an 
operating system as compared to Apache which is an application that 
runs on an operating system, a number of them in fact. To the average 
Joe out there the difference will be understood from the info provided.

Sure Linux is a program as are all operating systems, but that is for 
the geeks amongst us to preach.  Lets leave the general public with 
just enough information so they think they understand the concepts. &lt;G&gt;

If the author had said "application" instead of "program" then we would 
have found nothing wrong with his statement but lots of users would not 
have grasped what an application was. It has taken us this long for 
them to understand what a program is! &lt;VBG&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
