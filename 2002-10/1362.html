Who can say for sure that hackers could not be bothered to try hacking
it? Perhaps they have tried, but found it too secure. Perhaps they did
hack it, and someone has now fixed the hole.

&gt; &lt;&lt; So you haven't read Cuckoo's Egg then ;-)
&gt; Its only "secure" because its not worth anyone's time hacking it &gt;&gt;

Maybe not worth their time hacking it because they know the hole they
exploit will likely be fixed soon anyway.

&gt; I don't hold to that opinion but I was hoping the experienced users on this 
&gt; list could either support or disprove my belief. I think there are two 
&gt; parts to reply to that statement.

My opinion is that it would be more worth of one's time to hack Windows,
as they know that the hole either won't be fixed, or it will be fixed
but most users won't know apply the patch anyway. Linux would be a
better target to hack, but as a rule, most Linux users keep on top of
updates.

&gt; 1) Linux is so much more secure than Windows that it is going to take a 
&gt; much more concerted effort to break past the protections (so long as the 
&gt; user is not logged in as root).
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Linux is used in a great many systems in corporates, education and 
&gt; government. In many cases it would be worth the attention of a hacker if 
&gt; they wanted to. The statement above presupposes that Linux is not used on 
&gt; any "worthwhile" systems. I reject that generalisation.
