&gt; What about licensing?  Are you are talking about just oss/fs/pd unix-ish

No, I'm talking about Unix applications. Some of the main reasons for very
big Unix installations are proprietary programs (eg GWS, the Google Web
Server, which is about as big as they get.) But a breakdown would be nice,
I definitely would like to know how many open source Unix programs there
might be.

&gt; Is M$ Windows a unix application because I can get the source code
&gt; (shared source licence etc)  and compile it up under unix?

Oh? I find that a bit hard to believe. Making brand A unix kernel compile
under brand B unix is often very hard, even when A and B are using similar
toolchains (try it, there's several projects on the net doing just that.)
I suspect the M$ toolchain might be fairly closely tied to an M$ host.

&gt; I haven't helped with this email, right?

There were some helpful comments -- but I can't get any sense out of the
M$ recompilation comment which I think is pretty bogus :-)
