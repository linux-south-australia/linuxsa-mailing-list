No - I just wish everyone would be unanimous in agreeing that this sucks and
look at what can be done.  It does suck - we clearly all agree with that.

Internode put a submission in for the broadband inquiry which is excellent -
I suggest people read it.

I am not saying I am superior - I just loath the newbie trashing that is so
prevalent in the *nix community - it really has to stop.  For us it is easy
to see what is involved - for someone else - it is perfectly reasonable that
they don't read through 10 pages of fine print (even though I always do I
don't expect everyone to do this) - they just want it to work as it is
advertised on the television to do - and this is not happening.  There is a
clear gulf between marketing hype and reality that is clearly *not* targeted
at groups of users such as ourselves that know better.

Can LinuxSA submit a paper to the broadband inquiry?  We obviously have the
analytical and technical ability to do so.

&gt; 
&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; great - and we all love to trash members of lesser species 
&gt; - but if we think
&gt; &gt; about it for a moment - I don't recall *one* person from 
&gt; David's BBQ that
&gt; &gt; was happy with the status quo.
&gt; 
&gt; Just which status quo were you talking about?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Funny how on the list we are all superior to
&gt; &gt; all other consumers - but in person we are just like everyone else.
&gt; 
&gt; Did I say that anyone is superior? I said that I don't sign 
&gt; contracts that I 
&gt; don't understand and that people who do are, in my opinion, a 
&gt; tad stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was the only person there who is actually getting ADSL
&gt; 
&gt; And this justifies you how?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am the only
&gt; &gt; person that thinks the status quo sucks here
&gt; 
&gt; I beg your pardon? Since when did I say I agreed with the 
&gt; status quo? Do I need 
&gt; to repeat - in my opinion people who sign contracts they 
&gt; don't understand are 
&gt; at best ill advised if not stupid?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; but not one person justifying
&gt; &gt; the status quo (who is subject to it - not the ones getting 
&gt; deals through
&gt; &gt; their employer or otherwise) is planning on getting ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; The justification for the rate limiting on ADSL was a 
&gt; discussion held long 
&gt; back. I'd suggest you search the archives about it. It 
&gt; happened around the time 
&gt; when Telstra imposed, out of the blue, a 3Gb cap. Internode, 
&gt; at least, and 
&gt; others, made some good points on both sides of the argument.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why 
&gt; don't you all have
&gt; &gt; ADSL?
&gt; 
&gt; That is a rather obtuse comment is it not? What if:
&gt; 
&gt; * your line is pair gained
&gt; * you don't have the money
&gt; * you don't WANT an Internet Connection
&gt; * you already have Satellite
&gt; * you've got cable
&gt; 
&gt; ...in other words, rather than ask a question that you 
&gt; obviously want to answer 
&gt; yourself, why don't you answer it? Reading between the lines 
&gt; you are saying 
&gt; that YOU are SUPERIOR to US because NOT ALL OF US have ADSL...
&gt; 
&gt; OR that WE DON'T LIKE DOWNLOAD CAPS so WE ARE BOYCOTTING ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; *both of these conclusing are rather preposterous if you ask me*
