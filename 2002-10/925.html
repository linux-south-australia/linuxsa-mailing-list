&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to define what
&gt; &gt; &gt; download  is  reasonably well and not in small print.

&gt; &gt; Yes, but nobody reads the small print. Also, it might make perfect sense
&gt; &gt; to you, but that's no guarantee that Joe Blow will understand it.

And a guru will understand but not be able to monitor or to some extent even 
control their usage.
How could one monitor the download value of an hour's websurfing?  I guess you 
could empty your browser's cache before commencing to browse and see what you 
had collected after you had finished?
Similarly, if you are sent html mail which auto-loads from a website (Redhat 
used to send me stuff like that) you have no control whatsoever SFAICT.
There was a 'fiddle' which might persist, Tel$tra used to charge for the 
"backchannel" as well as the download - try monitoring and controlling THAT!

I don't think any rational person rejects download limits out of hand.  
However, the user must IMHO be able to monitor and control their usage so as 
to stay within the cap.
