&gt; Some languages give you a higher sense of confidence that a solution
&gt; is correct.  I would be more confident of a program written in Pascal,
&gt; for example, with it's strict type and array bound checking, than an
&gt; equivalent program written in C.

You've missed the point.  An "inherently secure" system
allows for failure, but requires failure to take the
system to the "secure" state.

The challenge for the computer language is to *always* be
able to detect when failure has occurred.

This is a question of the run-time environment, not of
the user syntax (although the syntax obviously has to
be able to give the run-time environment enough
information, something C doesn't do and Pascal almost
does).

&gt; In fact, posit a general purpose computing language, which can be
&gt; implemented on a range of current, popular microprocessors.  If a system,
&gt; Ss, written in that language, is inherently secure, then it follows that
&gt; there is a system, Sm, written in the machine laguage, which is also
&gt; inherently secure.  From this it also follows that both Ss and Sm are
&gt; members of an infinte set of systems, almost certainly including an Sc
&gt; (the system written in C), all of which are equivalent translations of
&gt; each other.

You argue that any Sm can be represented as an Sc.

That's true but not useful.  To be a useful argument you need
to exclude an Sc that emulates an Sm that runs an Ss (eg: a
Java virtual machine written in C).

Now to be able to argue that all Sm can be generated by
any Sc, you need to show the inverse: that Sc can generate
all Sm opcodes.  But there's contradictory evidence: C
doesn't have enough semantic information to generate the
array bounds check instruction for all array accesses
(worst case: malloc an array, access it via an alias).

&gt; I think you are talking about a different kind of security than Ian.
&gt; You seem to be talking about Orange book security, in which classified
&gt; data (e.g. Top Secret) cannot be declassified.  (Rate limiting is in
&gt; reference to an ingenious attack in which data could be declassified by
&gt; a high-security transmitter using CPU modulation to send the data to a
&gt; low-security receiver.  Most amusing.  Sadly I no longer have references.)

The technical term is "covert channel".

&gt; Ian is, I think, referring to an uncrackable system.  That's much easier
&gt; to achieve.  (I'm not convinced that B level security, as in Orange book,
&gt; can be achieved.)

They amount to the same thing.  People that think otherwise
should consider the success of timing attacks against SSL
implementations.
