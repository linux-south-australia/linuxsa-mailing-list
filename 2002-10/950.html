&gt; &gt; Does this make sense to people?  I thought the best security it to just DROP

If you are running any other services that can be connected to, it
really doesn't matter either way.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If you drop the packets the IRC server will sit at the other end until
&gt; it's TCP connection times out.  With TCP it expects a reply if it can't
&gt; connect to an IP/port.  if you reject with tcp-reset the server gets its
&gt; reply immediately and carries on.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as you're concerned DROP and REJECT are the same thing; packets
&gt; never make it past (or even into) your firewall.  The exception is that
&gt; port 113 looks like it exists, rather than your machine just not
&gt; replying (looking like it is not there).
&gt; 
&gt; One thing I was going to ask the list:  is it possible to set iptables
&gt; to only reject a packet if there is an OUTGOING connection from my
&gt; machine to the machine the packet originates from?  Otherwise I want to
&gt; drop the packet.  It's a little more stateful and to random scanners it
&gt; looks like ident isn't there.  To things like IRC (and some web) servers
&gt; it just appears closed so that they don't take forever to respond.

Interesting idea, I'll have to try it sometime.

 From the iptables manpage:
--state state
Where  state  is  a comma separated list of the connection states to
match. Possible states are

 ...
 
RELATED  meaning that  the  packet  is  starting a new connection, but is
associated with an existing connection, such as an FTP data transfer, or
an ICMP error.

I guess this is how it would be done.
