Hi All,
    I have a query about doing an RPM upgrade. I have done
this before with other packages, but not with glibc
libraries. I usually work by the rule of "if it ain't broke,
don't fix it", but unfortunately "it broke".

    Basically with all the problems I have been having with
Apache lately, more than one person has recommended to
upgrade it (and there are a few nasty security holes in
previous versions also) and so I have decided to do it. I
have downloaded all the recommended RPMs, but they require
dependencies (some of which are libraries).

    I have had a bad experience with upgrading libraries
before in my younger linux days, and so not wishing to
repeat the experience, can anybody recommend the best way to
do this without getting burnt. My server is live on the net,
and I don't have time to fix it or reinstall it if I bugger
this up. I can reboot it no problems, but I don't want to
have to completely reconfigure it.

    I suppose I could use the --nodeps option in the
install, but I am worried that this may break the system.
Normally I would either download the dependency RPMs or not
bother because it is too hard. I feel I need to do the
Apache upgrade and fix the security holes because I am live
on the net, and I know I am being probed by some wankers in
England since Apache went live on my server from the logs.

    So I suppose I can leave it up to you guys/gals. Any
advice on the best way to go about this? Any opinions
about --nodeps? Any other useful or handy hints? Thanks in
advance.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
