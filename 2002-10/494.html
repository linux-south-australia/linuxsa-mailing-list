If the Australian government (aka the endearing Alston) were as serious
about changing our fifth world economy as they say they are - I imagine
online 'content' would be more encouraged and supported.  Mirrors like this
seem to fill that need.

I have suggested to Simon Hackett that the ABC broadband site be mirrored
(excellent news coverage - I used it while I was in the USA where people can
actually afford to have broadband) along with the Parliamentary network,
etc.

I imagine some charities and many other groups would sign up for ADSL just
to get access to Parliamentary proceedings live on the Net,  Other countries
that we used to laugh at for being so backward are way ahead on this.

I recently received a mass produced propaganda response from the lovable
Alston's office (ref RA2002070919 if anyone wants to add to my letter
regarding concerns on bandwidth affordability and quota free on-line content
in Australia).  Obviously they couldn't even be bothered altering the letter
at all - I believe they stuck all likeminded letters &gt; /dev/null after |
mass.propaganda.letter.pl.  It states to the effect (while saying nothing of
course) that the government has a Broadband Advisory Group (that I suggest
we all look in to - these groups *do* have an effect on government policy)
while we are way up in OECD statistics, pricing models are conversant with
technological 'immaturity' blah blah blah.

Obviously they are being inundated with letters like mine - but perhaps if
we lobby hard enough we and others can convince the government to at least
help ISPs like Internode to provide more quota-free online content by making
mirror servers and the bandwidth required to serve them tax free or
something.

Any ideas?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not at this point.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You do get the nifty high speed access to those servers, 
&gt; but it -is- 
&gt; &gt; metered -unless- you are on ADSL or SDSL at this time.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is some significant re-engineering needed to do the traffic 
&gt; &gt; 'subtraction' needed, on non-ADSL connections...
&gt; 
&gt; Could this 're-engineering' also make it possible for business ADSL
&gt; customers sitting on Internet routable IP address ranges to access the
&gt; mirrors 'sans metering'?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
