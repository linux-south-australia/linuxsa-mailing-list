Hey - I called Optus to complain about their pathetic sales tactics

No direct number to Customer Relations (no wonder)

Fax 08 8464 9202

PO Box 306
Salisbury South
South Australia
5106

Can anyone advise how I can put Optus on notice that should I not be put on
a black list of no-sales-people allowed I will start charging them on a T&M
basis @ $20 / hr if they ever rock up again.

I could even wave a contract at the poorly dressed totally unprofessional
sales person advising that I can't talk to them until they sign the contract
acknowledging my fees.

I have also seriously considered electrifying my fence and door knob - it's
very very tempting.

Can Linux do facial recognition of sales people?

&gt; &gt; I had our receptionist grab me on my way past this morning and said
&gt; &gt; "Adam, a man came in and left this for you."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It was an Optus business card.  I said "Didn't he want to 
&gt; speak to me?"
&gt; &gt; "No, he just came in and said I'd like to leave this for 
&gt; the person in
&gt; &gt; charge of telephones, and asked what the name of that 
&gt; person was.  But
&gt; &gt; I'm sure he'll be back."

&gt; Slack salesman. There's a term in the medical sales industry 
&gt; called 'Brass
&gt; Plating', where the salesman copies details from the brass 
&gt; plate near the
&gt; surgery door, but never goes in and makes an appointment or effective
&gt; call.
&gt; 
&gt; They all get caught in the end, because the figures don't lie 
&gt; for long.
&gt; Some of the companies have talked about using gps tracking on 
&gt; their reps
&gt; to verify their reported activities, but I haven't heard of anyone
&gt; actually doing it yet.
