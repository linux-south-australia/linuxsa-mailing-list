Quoting Adam Hawes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ahawes@ihug.com.au">ahawes@ihug.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; &gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement when
&gt; they 
&gt; &gt; mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before, it's
&gt; unfortunate 
&gt; &gt; that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term for this.
&gt; 
&gt; DOWNLOAD is the shorthand!

I've already made this point, I think. It's acceptable shorthand to us, not 
them.

&gt; &gt; True, but an ISP shouldn't exploit the fact that nobody reads the small
&gt; print.
&gt; 
&gt; They don't exploit it (well they probably do) but people are stupid to
&gt; sign something that they A: haven't read fully or B: don't understand
&gt; fully.  There are an abundance of knowledgeable people out there that do
&gt; understand and can explain.  If they don't understand something, ASK! 
&gt; The ISP is probably more than happy to explain it in simple terms; their
&gt; helpdesk would do that all day anyway.  If the ISP can't explain in
&gt; simple terms (or isn't willing to) then the customer should go
&gt; elsewhere.  Simple.

Fostering mistrust between the consumer and the ISP is the wrong way to punish 
stupidity.
 
&gt; &gt; If I need a lawyer to purchase Internet access there's something terribly 
&gt; &gt; wrong. Hell, if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase
&gt; n 
&gt; &gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't have any technical knowledge then you shouldn't be using
&gt; it!  That would make things considerably better for everyone.  It's like
&gt; cars.  Everybody who drives a car has at least a small understanding of
&gt; how the car is built.  They might not be able to service the car, but
&gt; they still know roughly what makes the car tick.  When they get a flat
&gt; tyre or run out of fuel they can quickly work out what's going on and
&gt; remedy the problem.  

I didn't say "any". How much technical knowledge should a user have? Enough so 
that they don't shoot themselves in the foot. Most users don't have that much, 
but their first learning experience shouldn't be painful.

Who's going to teach them? It's not like a car, where you're taught by your 
parents (or an instructor). Many users weren't taught this sort of thing in 
school - I know I wasn't, and I'm fairly young as far as things go.

The same thing happens with cars, anyway. Just look at the mistrust that 
drivers have of mechanics or used car salesmen!

&gt; The same is not true with computers.  When they break most people lump
&gt; them to the service department with the complaint "the hard disk won't
&gt; load" or something equally stupid.  I am speaking from experience from
&gt; when I worked in a computer store.

Because they don't know any better, and because if the IT technician tells them 
to report problems with more detail he'll possibly alienate the customer. 

As somebody who's been on the technician side of the desk before, I can report 
problems in detail, because I know that it's necessary. All the user knows is 
that it's not working, it used to work, and it's one of those bloody computer 
things so it's not their fault.
