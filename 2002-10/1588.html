&gt;Have downloaded epson drivers from above, but will not install,
&gt;I get:
&gt;&lt;ome/squareyes/documents/cups-drivers-epson-0.3.6-6cl.i386.rpm;echo RESULT=$?
&gt;error; failed dependencies:
&gt;cups-drivers=epson-0.3.6-6cl is needed by cups-drivers-epson-0.3.6-6cl
&gt;RESULT=1
&gt;Seems strange,  the drivers have a dependency on themselves, (Like me :-) )
&gt;
&gt;Now have enough paper on the floor to keep me warm all next winter.
&gt;Thanks anyway, its an experience .
&gt;
&gt;Take care

You know what, I forgot to mention that their are other installation 
files (they call them RPM's) on that website.  I should have mentioned 
that there are different ones for Mandrake. Take a look.

Otherwise you might try lprng in Mandrake.


Keep warm!

Hi again,
have downloaded RPM , thats it mentioned above,
and to check, have been trying to get a Lexmark 1020 to work, with the same 
results, both with CUPS and other system, tried all the drivers in the list, 
none work. I have made up a text page with various sized fonts spread out 
well as a test page. Takes pages one after the other, as I  started it 
printing and went out to shift the water, came back and 14 pages on the 
floor.
May be a good idea to use Windows as my printer, don't feel like taking the 
risk on another printer.
The installation CD's were off APC magazine (only 2 of them) may be corrupted, 
although it installed no problems. I have had messages to put International 
CD 3 in the drive, which I don't have (when I did urpmi Omni )

Thanks again, pity its warming up, could get rid of some of this paper :-)
getting to where I could start my own recycling center.

Take care.

Winton
Would it be likely that I have corrupt files installed?
