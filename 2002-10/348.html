I don't get it. Is it supposed to be funny? (comments within)

&gt; Mr. George Soros,
&gt; 
&gt; I believe your involvement in Transmeta is utterly in conflict with your
&gt; ideals of openness in a way that I don't believe you are aware of. The

George Soros has "ideals of openness"??? Huh? I thought he was a money
market dealer, with ideals of profits, potentially at the risk of
destroying entire economies (it is rumoured that it was the Soros
hedge fund that triggered the Asian financial crisis of the late 90s).

&gt; reasons I believe this are highly technical, and somewhat subtle, and
&gt; yet
&gt; quite striking subjectively. Microsoft, as represented by Paul Allen in
&gt; Transmeta, would surely spend a fortune to keep Linus Torvalds on a
&gt; leash.

At this point, Mr Soros (or his staff, if they even bothered to look
at it) discards the email as completely and utterly irrelevant.

&gt; For technical reasons, I believe this is why Transmeta was created, and
&gt; the real potential of an open source software revolution has so far been
&gt; thereby prevented. Linux's success is mostly inevitable as PC hardware
&gt; became capable of running unix. Now it is being prevented from
&gt; succeeding
&gt; further. I believe similar motives are at work at Red Hat Software,
&gt; which
&gt; has many prominent members of the Linux clique on the dole. This would
&gt; help explain RHAT's historically bizarre IPO circus, and helps to
&gt; explain
&gt; why RHAT doesn't really comprehend unix and thinks they are Microsoft.
&gt; They are Microsoft, who don't comprehend unix.

Nice random unsubstatiated rumours and allegations...

&gt; 
&gt; Linus Torvalds consistantly favors modifications to Linux that pursue a
&gt; server orientation. This invariably leads to tremendous added
&gt; complexity.
&gt; This also does not directly threaten what Microsoft calls "the client",
&gt; i.e. the end-user's PC, i.e. Windows. A servers-only orientation is also
&gt; a
&gt; tiny subset of the potential of a free unix. By far the greatest
&gt; possible
&gt; benefit of a free unix (which is what Linux is) to individuals and
&gt; markets
&gt; is in direct competition with Windows. One might legitimately argue
&gt; otherwise, but direct competition with Windows has almost completely
&gt; been
&gt; avoided, which is very strange. This is what I attempted to do, and was
&gt; completely ostracized.

OK, so he's done something that he thinks is snazzy, it got rejected,
and so he's blaming MS in some bizzare fashion.

&gt; 
&gt; Whether Torvalds' love of unix's traditional server role is 100% genuine
&gt; or not, it is a terrible disservice, and is not what George Soros
&gt; preaches. The open source unix world, including GNU, prevents real

Does George Soros preach anything apart from profit?

&gt; effective openness with bogus complexity. In most cases, the so-called
&gt; open source movement is as hostile to real innovation as Microsoft is.

So he's got a bone with the direction of the whole movement, and is
still blaming MS???

&gt; 
&gt; Admittedly, I am exactly the disgruntled, bitter malcontent that would
&gt; raise such accusations. By the same token, such are the people that see
&gt; such things. I submit my technical works, and thier utter lack of
&gt; proliferation, for the interested reader to guage the validity of my
&gt; accusations, and whether my bitterness is sui generis or justified.

Throw in some typos to impress Mr Soros.

&gt; 
&gt;         I have devised a preliminary compensation scheme for authors of
&gt;         open source software based on the songwriter royalties model.
&gt; 
&gt;         I am the first person ever to insert a Forth-like interpreter
&gt; into
&gt;         a Linux (or any unix) kernel. This is historic, and was met with
&gt; a
&gt;         few grunts in the Linux kernel mailing list. There have since
&gt; been
&gt;         one or two other in-kernel Forths.

... and that really makes sense when compared to the earlier claim:
"Linus Torvalds consistantly favors modifications to Linux that pursue
a server orientation. This invariably leads to tremendous added
complexity."

But adding a Forth-like interpreter to the kernel doesn't lead to
added complexity?

&gt; 
&gt;         I did the first syscalls-only linking library in Linux,
&gt; libsys.a,
&gt;         which I suspect may have sparked the embedded-Linux efforts.

Mr Soros is rejoicing!

&gt; 
&gt;         I have devised the simplest means by far for a unix user to
&gt;         customize thier directory structure, a very basic convenience.
&gt; 
&gt;         I have written two better systems languages than C; osimplay and
&gt;         H3sm.

Which are obviously well-used...

&gt; 
&gt;         Many other works in Linux, Forth-like languages, and
&gt;         documentation.
&gt; 
&gt; At this point, what Linux might have been will not spring from Linus
&gt; Torvalds. It will therefor probably not spring from unix at all. The
&gt; parasites have overtaken Linux, just as they did with the Commodore
&gt; Amiga;
&gt; they bought it and killed it. Microsoft and Intel absolutely had to kill
&gt; the Amiga due to it's tremendous superiority to the PC. They packed the
&gt; board, who then scuttled Commodore. This destructive parasitic process
&gt; does not have to continue indefinitely, however.

That first bit just doesn't make sense, and now we're admitting to
being an Amigaphile -- definitely got his knickers in a knot, and
should be disregarded by all and sundry.

&gt; 
&gt; As an ancillary matter, but also pertinent to your investment in
&gt; Transmeta, note that the Crusoe chip's crucial low-power characteristics
&gt; are a pitiful joke compared to stack machines. I tried meekly to convey
&gt; this to Torvalds before Crusoe came out.

Stack machines. They've been a success, haven't they?

May as well argue that Warren Buffett should sell his Coke investments
as McDonalds is using Coke to keep down Pepsi and through them, KFC
and Pizza Hut, and fast food chains should be more open because I ran
a pizza shop once.

He obviously understands the mind of an investor well.
