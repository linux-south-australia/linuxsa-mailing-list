AAARRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

I just had American Express call me up to ask how they can get even more
money out of me!!!! And their card was *&#$!@* useless overseas - no one
accepts it any more! (too expensive for the merchant AND customer) - and
they want MORE money???

I could not believe the gall of this person to call me at work while I am in
the middle of something and not give a flying rat if that is convenient or
not.

RIGHT - how can we get a GPL'd document put together by some lawyer person -
put it up on SourceForge as a GPL project - on how to outsource listening
functions to a third party?

As a joke - I will see if I can get a nice legal document drawn up and offer
to fax it through to the next person who calls me or give it to the next
person who knocks on my door - and then I CAN SELL SOMETHING TO THEM!!!

"This contract is REALLY GOOD - all you have to is pay this discounted
amount and you will be listened to for AS LONG AS YOU LIKE!"

I could even have a range of listening plans to suit all sales people!

HA!  Sell services to the sales person - that should stuff 'em..

&gt; 
&gt; Hey,
&gt; Maybe you could say you've outsourced this function.
&gt; 
&gt; So, you charge them $150ph and then get someone to listen to 
&gt; them for $50ph 
&gt; and make heaps of money on the way through ...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can anyone advise how I can put Optus on notice that 
&gt; should I not be
&gt; &gt; &gt; put on a black list of no-sales-people allowed I will 
&gt; start charging
&gt; &gt; &gt; them on a T&M basis @ $20 / hr if they ever rock up again.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not enough.  to put myself through that kind of discomfort 
&gt; I'd need at
&gt; &gt; least $150/hr
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I could even wave a contract at the poorly dressed totally
&gt; &gt; &gt; unprofessional sales person advising that I can't talk to 
&gt; them until
&gt; &gt; &gt; they sign the contract acknowledging my fees.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sounds like a good idea to me, but I'd throw in a couple of 
&gt; small-print
&gt; &gt; clauses alloing your dog to gnaw on their ankles and so forth.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have also seriously considered electrifying my fence 
&gt; and door knob -
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's very very tempting.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Extremely tempting
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Can Linux do facial recognition of sales people?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Probably, but I'd just make it sound activated on the dog barking at
&gt; &gt; them ;)
