Matthew,

&gt; Had a quick read and at least David's questions kept on topic and were all
&gt; relevant to Linux :)

True.

&gt; I have applied for a couple of jobs that required a badly disguised IQ test
&gt; before I made it to round three.   Just for a laugh I did one for the
&gt; "experience".   I was actually tested for grammar and spelling in the first
&gt; section, problem solving and  mathematical skills in the second section
&gt; followed by pattern matching and eye for detail in the third and final
&gt; section.

Did you say grammar and spelling? They, apparently, are not important
although this is not my opinion. Surely to work as a system
administrator you'd need problem solving skills and to a certain extent
mathematical skills. And looking for that extra space in a configuration
line...

&gt; Just to add a bit more fuel to the debate....   I have seen very clever
&gt; people fall to pieces with the pressure of an exam.   They know their stuff
&gt; but for some reason under the pressure of an exam they loose the plot and
&gt; wham C.R.A.F.T.   If you cater to those individuals with either verbal
&gt; exams or "bring in" practical examples or their work, then testing ones
&gt; "abilities" in a job interview in this manner is IMHO ok.

But you have to decide it somehow.

&gt; (note: MP3 players have been done to death !) and demonstrated the
&gt; necessary practical skills with simple PCB/CAD problems given in the
&gt; interview.

How about a super fast DVD copier?
