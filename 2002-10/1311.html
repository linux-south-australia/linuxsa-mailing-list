Hi Andrew,

I have faced almost the exact same problem, with the exception that all the
remote clients were non-Windows enviroments.

Commerical Options:

HOBLink ( US$140 per seat + Term Serv licences) worked extremely well.
Citrix worked slightly better ($300-400 per seat + Term Serv licences)

SCO Tarantella was what we eventually went with. ($190 Per connection [Linux
Intel version only] + Term Serv licences).
<A HREF="http://www.tarantella.com/">http://www.tarantella.com/</A> You can download a free 30 day trial version, It
seems to do every thing that you need [and more].


Free options:

A Free option we looked into but never tested was having a linux VNC server
with "n" many VNC sessions on it. each VNC session on startup would run
rdesktop in full screen and connect to the Windows Terminal Server. thus the
VNCserver would act almost as a proxy for the RDP protocol.

Client ----[vnc]------&gt; VNC server -----[rdp]-----&gt; Terminal server 


Another option which we could not get working was the RDP 2 VNC proxy. 

extract from
<A HREF="http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2000-November/018429.html">http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2000-November/018429.html</A>

&gt;
&gt; rdp2vnc is basically a translating proxy between VNC
&gt; and RDP protocols. it's not 100% complete but plenty
&gt; usable.
&gt;
&gt; some caveats:
&gt;
&gt;  - NT4 only, no support for win2k
&gt;  - Raw, RRE, CopyRect only
&gt;  - no built in httpd
&gt;  - no authentication (authenticate by TS login)
&gt;  - no VNC session persistence (it persists in TS)
&gt;  - no shared session support
&gt;  - is linux (unix) hosted


I havent been able to quickly find a download, I may have a copy somewere if
you need it.

Regards Dale Butterworth.

Subject: Java-based RDP client


There's a little project in the pipeline which will probably mean that
I'm going to have to start looking at something to give our users
access to their desktops remotely, most probably via the web.

Now, Citrix have a Java ICA client (but I'd rather not use Citrix as
it's expensive and a bit cumbersome), but I'm dealing with Microsoft
Terminal Server people.

Microsoft, too, have a web-based client for RDP, something they like
to call Terminal Services Advanced Client (TSAC). It's an ActiveX
control, so it's simply a case of "too bad" for anyone that either
runs a browser other than IE.

We're not a totally evil place; not everyone has Windows on their
desktop, with IE sitting snugily between the "Recycle Bin" and "My
Briefcase". Because this is so, I've got to consider people like me,
who run UNIX on everything, and people that use the other operating
systems floating around out there.
