&gt; Prolly he got sick of sticking CDs in his burner.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; I personally think that the distro's themselves should get their marketing
&gt; act together and at least have a contact in australia that distributes CDs
&gt; and the profits go back to the programmers for more of the good stuff.
&gt; places like everythinglinux.com.au etc are quick which is good, but at the
&gt; end of the day it doesn't really help redhat/mandrake financially.

What about a priority server? Say, somewhere where you can enter your CC
number on a web page and a script on the back end gives you an account
for a week or something. It seems when a distro comes out, all servers
that have it world wide are thrashed for 2 days, then its easy to get a
copy after the preak subsides and people start burning from mates like
what happens on this list. There is no way you could get a boxed set
from, say, France for mandrake to Australia in that time, and thats what
they need to compete with. A cheap, simple CC based priority ftp, say
$10au or something would be great! Boxed sets are just always too far
behind the pulse. It may be prohibitively expensive to host it here, but
i'm sure there are places where connectivity is cheap enough that they
could probably turn a profit with such a system.
