Well, I don't know about you, but I loved printing out full-sized copes 
of my cities in SimCity on a 3x3(?) A4 grid and it would never print out 
clear enough. [0]

But seriously, you're saying that I can buy an Athlon XP 2400, 1/2 Gig 
of 333Mhz DDR ram and a 40G HDD for just over $1000 because some GD's 
like Photoshop running nice and fast. No way. Gamers are the mass of 
people responsible for the fantatsic yield that PC harware manufacturers 
get for high-end components. Gamers are the poor sods that spend their 
money making stupid purchases over and over, just so their machine is a 
always few Mhz faster than their buddies. [2] That is what makes this 
kind insane technology is affordable, and is one of the main drivers for 
further hardware development. Now that PCs have such high performance 
and cheap hardware, the x86 has made inroads into other markets 
(high-end graphics, workstations, etc) and there is a lot of demand from 
other applications which are further accellerating the pace, but these 
sorts of applications generally came after the first hardware-intensive 
games.

I'm not saying it is or was the only factor, but I don't think gaming 
had a trivial effect. Bear in mind that the gaming industry is bigger 
than the movie industry, about US$20 billion worldwide according to the 
Victorian Government [4]. That's a hell of a lot of demand for high-end 
PC hardware.
