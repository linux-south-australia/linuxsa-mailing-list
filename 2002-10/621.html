Do HD's consume much power?  I've heard that it is not very eco-friendly to
leave them running - not sure about this though.

I think monitors are the beasts that put out more CO2 in to the atmosphere?

&gt; 
&gt; Depends which bit breaks. Generally spinning them up is what stresses
&gt; them. Personally I diable power saving on my machines, to ensure the
&gt; disks dont stop spinning. I also have had a very good run with hard
&gt; disks. Every pre 500mb HD I have had has crashed, but none 
&gt; since &lt;touch
&gt; wood&gt;.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is this true?  So maybe leaving my Linux box always running 
&gt; is a good idea?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Someone once told me that parts have a certain lifespan and 
&gt; leaving them
&gt; &gt; running brings d-day closer each day it is left running.  I 
&gt; question the
&gt; &gt; validity of this rumour.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All this talk of dying hard drives worries me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; From alt.sysadmin.recovery:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Today, we are mourning the loss of /dev/ad43c.  He was a 
&gt; kind, gentle
&gt; &gt; &gt; disk, early in his years, with much free space ahead of him.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; He passed
&gt; &gt; &gt; away today, Friday, January 27th at 9:05am Pacific time.  
&gt; It was a an
&gt; &gt; &gt; unexpected death, with no signs of illness or a history 
&gt; of complaints;
&gt; &gt; &gt; he simply went into spams, and started to slip away.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Despite our best efforts to save /dev/ad43c, despite two 
&gt; hours spent
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying desperately to bring him back from the brink, he 
&gt; simply lost
&gt; &gt; &gt; the battle, and passed on into oblivion.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will miss /dev/ad43c.  He served us well, and was dedicated 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to living
&gt; &gt; &gt; the best life that he could.  He will live on in our 
&gt; hopes and in our
&gt; &gt; &gt; dreams, and in our hearts.  Though he can never truly be 
&gt; replaced, his
&gt; &gt; &gt; essence-- his soul-- shall be with us, always.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Good-bye, /dev/ad43c, and farewell.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; *sniff*
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have some old drives still
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in use at home - and I wonder if hard drives just suddenly 
&gt; &gt; &gt; die after a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years which seems strange or if that is really only for 
&gt; servers in
&gt; &gt; &gt; constant
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Typically, drives don't die suddenly.  If you have any 
&gt; &gt; &gt; automated monitoring
&gt; &gt; &gt; of your syslog files, you'll quite often see a build up of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; errors before you
&gt; &gt; &gt; lose a drive completely (note to pedants that I said 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "typically": I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; also
&gt; &gt; &gt; seen cases of drives failing completely without warning).  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that vendors
&gt; &gt; &gt; like HP have finally gotten around to automating this 
&gt; &gt; &gt; process, so quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; often you're warned of failure before it happens.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I often don't turn my desktop machine off - although I 
&gt; wonder if my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Linux box spins down the HD?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Typically", spinning up and down the hard drive increases 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the failure rate.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doesn't the Linux kernel do a sync every few minutes which 
&gt; &gt; &gt; makes it hard
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spin down hard drives?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Every thirty seconds, and only if there is data to be 
&gt; flushed to disk.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know of people who have hard drives in their home 
&gt; &gt; &gt; machines running for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years with no problem - so I wonder how concerned we should 
&gt; &gt; &gt; be over data
&gt; &gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; old(er) drives.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a 2 gig IBM SCSI drive in my firewall that would be 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pushing 7 years
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous use now.  Put that in your MTBF pipe and smoke it!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
