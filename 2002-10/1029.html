Ian,
Wouldn't it be perhaps easier to get Foxtel which has BBC World?

(am considering this actually, because it now has rally)

&gt; No - I would always prefer untimed connections but metered bandwidth - if
&gt; only I could get up to 20GB / month!!!  That would allow up to 2 - 3 hours
&gt; of BBC news on my ADSL connected TV each night.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of which - I have always marvelled at the blatant inefficiency of
&gt; the Internet to handle streaming media - it is host to many many many
&gt; points.  Isn't IPv6 meant to handle media streaming more efficiently
&gt; somehow?  Such as broadcasting to many points rather than an individual
&gt; stream to each individual point even if they are in the same area.
&gt; 
&gt; My honest believe is that when streaming media becomes mainstream over ADSL
&gt; - then demand will most certainly exceed supply.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just rapt that I can listen to talk back radio in Johannesburg or
&gt; Eastern Europe over ADSL - much more reliable that my short wave radio and
&gt; 20 metres of tuned wire.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if Internode will eventually be able to 'cache' streaming media?

&gt; &gt; &gt; But don't all ISPs have a usage meter for your account 
&gt; &gt; and/or some sort
&gt; &gt; &gt; of arrangement to tell you when you're getting near your 
&gt; &gt; limit for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; month?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The larger ones certainly offer that facility in one form or 
&gt; &gt; another.  However 
&gt; &gt; there are problems, eg
&gt; &gt; 1. It is the ISP's meter, not the users
&gt; &gt; 2. Some special action has to be taken by the user to see 
&gt; &gt; what the ISP says 
&gt; &gt; they have downloaded to date.
&gt; &gt; 3. SFAIK you can't see your download credit decreasing in 
&gt; &gt; real time as you 
&gt; &gt; surf/download/pick up mail/load news/whatever.
&gt; &gt; 4a. The ISP doesn't mind the user exceeding their allocation 
&gt; &gt; - its all extra 
&gt; &gt; income to them and
&gt; &gt; 4b. Most users would want to be able to exceed their limit 
&gt; &gt; when they chose - 
&gt; &gt; they would not want to be cut off in the middle of a download.
&gt; &gt; 5. add your egs to taste 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The issue seems to revolve around the fact that ISPs are charged for 
&gt; &gt; bandwidth, and want to have fees which reflect that, whereas 
&gt; &gt; users would 
&gt; &gt; probably prefer all-you-can-eat timed access.
&gt; &gt; IMHO if an ISP offered a programme where you paid for time, 
&gt; &gt; paying more/hr for 
&gt; &gt; a fast link than for a slow one, many issues would be gone.  
&gt; &gt; The current 
&gt; &gt; $1/hr (give us $50 and you have 3 months to use the time) 
&gt; &gt; that some ISPs 
&gt; &gt; offer is excellent, but only applies to slow dial-up accounts.
