&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to define what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; download  is  reasonably well and not in small print.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but nobody reads the small print. Also, it might make perfect sense
&gt; &gt; &gt; to you, but that's no guarantee that Joe Blow will understand it.
&gt; 
&gt; And a guru will understand but not be able to monitor or to some extent even 
&gt; control their usage.
&gt; How could one monitor the download value of an hour's websurfing?  I guess you 
&gt; could empty your browser's cache before commencing to browse and see what you 
&gt; had collected after you had finished?

Well, if one was really a guru, one might make some ip accounting
rules to account for all traffice sent and received over the link,
inluding DNS and other overhead... far more accurate than the browser
cache...

&gt; Similarly, if you are sent html mail which auto-loads from a website (Redhat 
&gt; used to send me stuff like that) you have no control whatsoever SFAICT.
&gt; There was a 'fiddle' which might persist, Tel$tra used to charge for the 
&gt; "backchannel" as well as the download - try monitoring and controlling THAT!

turn images off, or change mail clients. Yeah, suboptimal solutions,
but you _do_ have some control. If you want, simply block (using your
proxy or firewall) all access to the redhat website... :)

&gt; 
&gt; I don't think any rational person rejects download limits out of hand.  
&gt; However, the user must IMHO be able to monitor and control their usage so as 
&gt; to stay within the cap.

I recall some ISP once giving a Windows start bar widget which would
do just that -- in fact, windows these days will tell you how much
data has been sent and received over each network connection, if you
click on properties or status or something. Linux will give you way
more info, but we know that :)
