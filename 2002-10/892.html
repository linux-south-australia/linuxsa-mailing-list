&gt; &gt; Ian,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the best option like you said is to run identd on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; gateway if it makes no difference and set 'allow' to port 113 -
&gt; &gt; &gt; which should 'allow' that port in to the gateway?

Some people may be wary to do this in case identd is exploitable.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have no idea why you need to run an ident server to get to:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * irc.openprojects.net
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't and I'm on there all the time. Something else is wrong
&gt; &gt; methinks :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Some bigger networks such as Dalnet, Austnet, etc require ident
&gt; authentication...  Or, it makes connecting to an IRC server awefully
&gt; slow while ident requests timeout.

For this reason, my firewall script includes:

modprobe ipt_REJECT
# Reject ident requests (as opposed to drop, speeds up connection to
# irc)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 113 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 113 -m state --state RELATED -j ACCEPT

You still do need an ident server for DALnet, though I do wonder why
they bother anymore--most DALnet users (that I encountered, anyway) use
mIRC, with it's faked ident server that only purpose is to allow you to
connect to the network. Ident was originally designed for multi-user
machines where it would be needed to determine who was using it at a
particular time and is therefore accountable for it's actions (for
example if the machine was used to do something illegal). At least
that's my understanding.

I think maybe it would be a good idea for ident to be handled by the
isp, or just killed off completely (not many people seem to use it these
days (that I know of) except to be able to connect to DALnet anyway).

Daniel
