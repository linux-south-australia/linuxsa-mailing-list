&gt; Greg et al,
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, i was aware there was another installfest coming up soonish.
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's really what I was thinking - a press release picked up by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; SMH has gotta be pretty good publicity. Are you installfest
&gt;&gt;&gt; organisers looking at the possibility of a press release?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've already asked for information to be forwarded to Gordon Hubbard,
&gt;&gt; the AUUG press secretary, who will arrange a similar press release
&gt;&gt; almost as soon as he gets it.
&gt;
&gt; The official announcement for the InstallFest will come very soon now.

Please let Gordon make the official announcement to the press.
There's nothing that upsets the press more than having to deal with a
different person every time.

OK, of course there are things that upset the press more.  But
seriously, we've done a lot of work to ensure that we have a good
channel to the press, and we don't want to risk it by having more than
one person talk to them.

&gt; We are taking this week to make absolutely certain we have
&gt; everything in order and make sure we don't accidentally miss out any
&gt; sponsors or find ourselves left high in the water.

As I've said before, making an announcement doesn't mean that we can't
continue looking for sponsors :-)  So missing them out in an
announcement isn't the end of the world, though obviously it would be
nice to get it right first time.

Greg
