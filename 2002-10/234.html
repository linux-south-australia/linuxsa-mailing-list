&gt; One of the most important things for open source projects is fresh blood.

&gt; We need new, young, faces being involved in various projects. In the Samba 
&gt; team we now have a 19yo in Canberra, a 17/18yo in BC/Alberta and an 18yo 
&gt; from Holland (who was not legally allowed to drink when he was at CIFS2002 
&gt; in San Jose, but someone got him a beer anyway).
&gt; 

On this note, I think a resource where projects can advertise the need 
for contibutors, sort of like a job website, but for os projects, would 
be useful. I have been considering how to give back to the community, 
but in a more technical manner than donations, but it is hard to know 
where to start. Maybe my contribution could be to set up such a site... 
(unless it already exists, but I haven't seen anything like it myself.)

Comments?

Barney.
