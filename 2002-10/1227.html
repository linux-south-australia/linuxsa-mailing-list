&gt; No, I'm saying the technology curve has followed Moore's Law (with some
&gt; revision of ML).  Nothing was mentioned in your original email about the
&gt; economics of PC hardware, unless that's what you meant by "pushing the
&gt; envelope."

Remember, Moore's Law is actually an observation, and it isn't even an 
observation of a naturally occuring phenomonon. It is mostly true 
because we as consumers are stupid enough to keep on buying those upgrades.

Still, I was trying to show that I can buy stupidly over-powered 
hardware for low, low prices, because of the demand for said hardware 
from gamers. This is the most visible effect of the gaming industry 
pushing the envelope.

Perhaps I should have been a little clearer, and said something like: 
"The games industry was a major factor contributing to the inital and 
further development of high-end PC hardware" instead of "pushing the 
envelope" in my original mail.

&gt; Or yields.

Clearly, high yield for a component equates to both percieved demand for 
that component and additional funds for the manufacturer, which then can 
be used for additinal R&D for the next versions of that component, which 
no doubt will be bigger, better and faster then the current version. 
I.e. it pushes the envelope.

&gt;   I was commenting on your original statement; you seem to have
&gt; broadened its scope somewhat.

True, true. I was just attempting to justifiy my original statement.
