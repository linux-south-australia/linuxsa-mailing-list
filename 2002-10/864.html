&gt; ISPs are being screwed like the rest of us

I never felt I was being screwed, at least not on the basis of having to
buy by the byte.  I'm obviously going to have to buy by some measurable
quantity, and if not by the byte, then by what?  By the bandwidth reserved
for me?  Could be.  There certainly are carriers who sell that way, and
they put a convincing argument if you can scale up that far.  I had some
very nice people from Uunet in my office, and that was exactly what they
wanted to sell me: a fix price pipe, charged by how big it is.  I imagine
they buy even bigger pipes and split them into smaller quantities, adding
their profit.  Well done Uunet, owned by MCI, a division of WorldCom, now
gone bust.

The problem with buying a pipe is that I don't know how big I want it.
Well, I do: I want it as big as possible, but I can't afford that.  Well,
no, I *can* afford it if I only have to pay for it when I use it.  That's
what I want: I want to pay by the pipe-size only when I use it.  I think
that's almost like paying per byte.

By the way, I did eventually decide I couldn't quite justify the cost of
that Uunet pipe.  If I could have spread my usage out over larger parts of
the day, so that I needed a smaller pipe during peak time, it might have
been different, but I was running a small ISP so that wasn't an option.
The numbers were pretty marginal, anyway.  I think it was something like,
50% average utilisation of a 512K pipe cost the same as buying that data
per megabyte, so the potential was there to save money, but buying per
megabyte meant I could bring it in on a 2Mbps link, so for my volume
it worked out cheaper and faster.

I *like* paying per byte.  It gives me the best service that I can afford.
