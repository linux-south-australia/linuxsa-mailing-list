&gt;&gt; I know of people who have hard drives in their home machines running for

If your drives are IDE and over 1 year old, backup to CDROM.  If your
drives are IDE and over 3 years, buy a new drive for critical data.

&gt;I have a 2 gig IBM SCSI drive in my firewall that would be pushing 7 years

Ah good to see an ol' SCSI still hanging in there....   I have the two of
the first Micropolis 1GB SCSI drives (5 1/4" full size) in Adelaide that
are pushing 11 years of continuous service, I was dissapointed that my
first Seagate 1Gb SCSI disk died last week after 9 years :(

The intent of my previous posting was not to start a SCSI vs IDE debate or
who has the longest running IDE/SCSI disk.   It was to simply point out
that MTBF is a better method of determining HDD reliability than empiracle
evidence.

Statements like "I have used IDE drives in all my machines and they are all
over  6 years old" or "I have had more SCSI disks die on me than IDE so IDE
are better" are a false economy.   IDE and SCSI both have their place in
RAID systems, here are two examples;

I have built two IDE RAID array's in the past year, the first with 16 x
120Gb WDD 8Mb Drives (320Gb array)  and another with 16 x 320Gb Maxtors
(853Gb array) both RAID5 systems (3 drive + hot swap).   Both utilise
Accusys IDE/SCSI RAID controllers.   Both machines were costed to have
their array's replaced every 12 months, over the life of the machine (~5
years).   The beauty of an IDE RAID system is the size of the array will
grow each year as the large IDE drives continue to climb.   The SCSI
systems while seemingly more expensive at the outset were in fact 40%
cheaper in the longer term, but the cost penalty of replacing the drives
was insignificant when considering the growth of the array during its life.

In this past year I have also sold a 4TB (yes Terrabyte) SCSI array which
had to meet a reliability of 99.99996%.   So if the machine reboots once in
the next three year (takes 6 mins for reboot cycle) or if were unfortunate
to suffer a simultaneous two drive failure we could never meet this
reliability figure.   IDE just wasn't an option.   Needless to say this
machine is running a *BSD OS.   Personally I would have prefered to have
bought a house in Nth Adelaide then purchase this unit, but the SCSI HDD's
provided the reliability that was required.

I suppose the morel of my two stories is that both IDE and SCSI RAID
systems found their place in two different niche's of the computer
industry.   Each offered something to the customer.   I have found through
personal experience that you must first understand the limitiations and
advantages of any system before you can make valid comparisons between it
and another system.
