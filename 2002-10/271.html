Hi,

&gt; anyone in Australia developing Linux on E10Ks?

I've been told that Linux runs fine on a domain (group of boards that
looks just like a single computer) once the domain has been configured.

The first feature that I would want to see in Linux on the E10K would be
Dynamic Reconfiguration (The ability to add/remove boards from domain
while OS running).  At the last meeting Dan said that adding processors
is already supported on some architectures, so I guess that if it isn't
already included it probably isn't too far off for Sun hardware.  Adding
boards to a domain also adds memory.  Can Linux restrict the kernel and
its stack to the first 4G of physical memory?  If not, I expect that you
will not be able to remove the first board from the domain (Solaris has
a kernel cage switch for this).

You would still have to run Solaris on the System Service Processors
(2xNetra T1s or equiv) to configure the backplane and control the
power/fans/diagnostics, until you reverse engineer and port that
functionality.

| includes: 
|  8x System boards 
|  32GB RAM 
|  25x 333MHz UltraSPARC-II Processors 
|  29x Dual-Channel Differential Fast/Wide SCSI SBus Host Adapters 
|  1x Gigabyte Ethernet Adaptor (Fibre) 

He must not be counting CPUs with caching problems, given that each
system board has 4 processors.  It looks like this system had a lot of
storage attached.  If you buy it, you'll have buy some storage elsewhere
(or have it chucked into the deal?).  What I would like to know is, can
you throw a couple of framebuffers into the two spare S-Bus slots?  Hook
them up to projectors and you would almost have a Gibson.
