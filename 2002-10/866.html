&gt; so you are saying Mrs Jones from 72 who wants to see her grandchildren in
&gt; England and chat with them - send photos, etc just like on the telly is an
&gt; idiot?

She can work her television can't she?  She probably had to do some
research into how that worked (reading the manual or whatever) so that
she could change the channels and work the volume and turn it off when
she finished with it. I bet she even understands that if you leave the
TV on all day and night it'll run up your power bill, even if you're not
watching it!

She's not an idiot, but she should at least understand what's going on
before she uses her new 3G "downloads" every month.  It is all in the
contract, and if she didn't understand the contract she signed, why did
she sign it??? If she signed something that was unclear to her or that
she didn't read fully then she is an idiot.  Anyone who does that is an
idiot!

&gt; Respect your elders young man..

It's not a matter of disrespect at all!

Cheers,
Adam
