Why do they half support it? As I said, the image worked the first time, 
but failed the second time. Is their code really that bad? Or do they do 
it on purpose? Part of the "strategy tax"...

What harm does it do to Microsoft to support this format (properly) 
anyway? They don't make any rival image formats. Perhaps Unisys has 
something to do with it, as PNG competes with GIF (of course PNG is way 
better) - although ppt doesn't support GIF with transparency in it. Does 
PNG legitimise open source? is that the problem?

And in any case, I've seen people's Equation Editor Objects view 
correctly in non-full-screen mode but fail in full-screen mode, even 
though they obviously would've tested it prior to doing their 
presentation. I've seen M$ office software selling for like $700 at EB, 
I fail to see how it's worth that much.

P.S.: I wonder if Winduz media player will ever support ogg? :^) hahaha, 
yeah i was joking..

&gt;If you can actually do it, then Microsoft has not benefit in supporint
&gt;PNG's at the moment--at all.
