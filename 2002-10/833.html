&gt; You're right - the mailbox (of 0 bytes) is actually being created with
&gt; the adduser command.  If the user.user mailbox file is deleted and then
&gt; user is sent mail, procmail creates the mailbox file with user.mail
&gt; ownership.  Yay!  I can't see any options in adduser to change this
&gt; behaviour
&gt; 
&gt; So procmail is creating the mailbox owned by user.mail, which is great,
&gt; but the mailbox still has 600 permissions.  I need 660 so that group
&gt; mail can read/write the mailbox, and thus Neomail can work.
&gt; 
&gt; man procmailrc mentions this:
&gt; 
&gt;        UMASK       The name says it all (if it doesn't, then for­
&gt;                    get about this one :-).  Anything assigned  to
&gt;                    UMASK  is  taken  as  an octal number.  If not
&gt;                    specified, the umask defaults to 077.  If  the
&gt;                    umask  permits o+x, all the mailboxes procmail
&gt;                    delivers to directly will receive an o+x  mode
&gt;                    change.  This can be used to check if new mail
&gt;                    arrived.
&gt; 
&gt; We've been playing around with this, but we still can't seem to make it
&gt; do what we want.  I'm still not sure if this is the option we need.
&gt; 
&gt; Jordan.
&gt; 
&gt; ps:  thanks muchly for your help thus far

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Shouldn't do - depending on the mail delivery agent, it normally takes
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; care of that.  What's Mlocal set to in your sendmail.cf?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mlocal,         P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qSPfhn9,
&gt; &gt; &gt; S=EnvFromL/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
&gt; &gt; &gt;                 T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
&gt; &gt; &gt;                 A=procmail -t -Y -a $h -d $u
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, the -d flag on procmail tells it to run with the uid of the recipient,
&gt; &gt; but procmail's man doesn't explain what the group should be.  The F=S flag
&gt; &gt; tells sendmail to leave itself running as root (so that the delivery program
&gt; &gt; can setuid to the recipient), and the default user:group for sendmail is
&gt; &gt; typically mail:mail, so it's probably running as group mail when sendmail
&gt; &gt; invokes local for final delivery.  My guess is that the mail files aren't
&gt; &gt; being created by procmail, which is why the group id is getting fouled up.
&gt; &gt; Just as a note, the permissions on my /var/spool/mail are 775, and owned
&gt; &gt; by root:mail.
