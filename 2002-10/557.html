Jordan,

&gt; &gt; Funnily enough, now that I actually have bothered to look at my
&gt; &gt; /var/spool/mail directory all my mail spool directories are owned by
&gt; &gt; user.mail. You have an opportunity to prove me wrong...
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure that's safe?  I don't want the Universe to implode :-)

It's not at all safe. You need the Power of the One Ring against we folk
of old, and you are not this list's Witch King; the Wise would fear the
Nine all together, but I am of the Eldar kind.

&gt; &gt; have you tried
&gt; &gt; changing the ownerships manually? Creating a test user and then sending
&gt; &gt; mail to that user?
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't.  That would probably work, but it's not very elegant and
&gt; doesn't solve the problem of new users not being able to use webmail.

What happens if you create a test user and then send mail to that user?
Have you checked whether the /var/mail group has a sticky bit set? I
think it's supposed to be permission 1777 but don't quote me. I think
you need to make /var/spool/mail 's group mail and then set the group
sticky bit, but I've forgotten.

*damn*

But I have heard fetchmail complain that it should be mode 1777 before.
I'm almost, but not entirely certain, that is the right mode.

:-)
