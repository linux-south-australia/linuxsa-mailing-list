&gt;&gt;&gt; My misnomer about Linux and Free Unix (xBSD) is quite obviously
&gt;&gt;&gt; that many of its users can write well with good grammar and
&gt;&gt;&gt; impeccable spelling. I know -- I should get over it -- but then
&gt;&gt;&gt; again I do actually care about the open source community and it
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be nice if we portrayed ourselves using standard spelling
&gt;&gt;&gt; and standard grammar.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; And note the two letter As in grammar ;-P
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I thunk ya missed yerrr S in 'letter' laddy!
&gt;
&gt; Steve,
&gt;
&gt; Line 3, second sentence.

Steve only wrote one sentence.

&gt; Please revise your use of hyphens.  A full stop or comma would have
&gt; been sufficient.

Are you talking of the second sentence at the (unattributed) third
level of indentation (which I think was David Lloyd)?  Those aren't
hyphens, they're dashes, also called em rules or (in American) em
dashes.  In print they're a continuous horizontal line the width of
the letter m (thus the name).  In ASCII they're represented by two
0x2d (-) characters.  They're used to indicate an abrupt change in the
structure of a sentence.  It's not clear whether that is the case
here: it looks more like the dashes are superfluous.  It is clear that
they are surrounded by white space, which is incorrect.

See the Commonwealth Department of Finance and Administration
Style Manual, 5th edition, sections 6.88 and on, and the Chicago
Manual of Style, 14th edition, sections 5.105 and on.

Aaaah, that feels better.

Greg
