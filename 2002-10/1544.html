"That was very good, Eugene.  Very good, up to a point.  Most people

&gt; NTP v3 and later do provide support for crypto-based authentication,
&gt; which FBSD's and Debian's ntp both seem to support. This should at least
&gt; make the client-access side of things a bit more secure.

I'm not sure if any stratum 2 servers are running above v2 (oops,
just checked the canonical list, time.deakin.edu.au is running v4).
I wonder if that server is offering public key access to anonymous
clients?  (I'm out on a limb here, as I've never tried to set up
secure NTP).

&gt; Given it has only taken me 5 years to get around to setting up SSL for
&gt; getting to my mail, it shouldn't take too many more to set up public-key
&gt; auth for ntp. :(

Gazes at the machine set aside for his next firewall, with a year's worth
of dust sitting on it.
