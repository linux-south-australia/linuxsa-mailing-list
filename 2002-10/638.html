&gt;&gt;&gt;The trick here is to pay the extra tariff for eco-friendly power, and 
&gt;&gt;&gt;then relax (If you can afford it of course) :)

&gt;&gt;Screens? You only need one screen, and a network connection :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;engines out of phase, and that's when the Video Card fan is behaving. Is 
&gt;&gt;&gt;it just me or are ASUS vidcard fans completely crap? - my dad's is the same)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yep. I have an asus v3800 TNT2 ultra where the fan started sounding
&gt;&gt;stuffed 2 years ago. Then was intermittent, then just plain stopped
&gt;&gt;about 1.5 years ago. I left it on 24/7 anyway figureing I'd replace it
&gt;&gt;when it died, and it worked fine untill about 3 months ago when black
&gt;&gt;bars started appearing accross the picture. I replaced it last night
&gt;&gt;with a GF4 :) The fan (Or what was left of it) basically fell to bits
&gt;&gt;when I touched it! Even when it was connected it could wobble about 30
&gt;&gt;degrees each way! No wonder it couldnt spin. I payed close to $500 for
&gt;&gt;it when it came out too! What a rip off... :(
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have the exact same card.  I cleaned the dust from the heatsink/fan
&gt; every year or so and the card (and fan) still functions perfectly (after
&gt; more than 3 years)  I think I may have had to lube the fan once.
&gt; 
&gt; It's no surprise it fell to bits if you left the thing powered for 18
&gt; months while it couldn't move :-)
&gt; 

Well mine is a GeForce 2 deluxe and it makes buzzing noises on occasion 
- has done since it was about 6 months old. On inspection it appears 
loose / plastic / low quality, but dust content is low. For a card that 
initially retailed ~$700, I think a better quality fan could have been 
included... My Dad's OTOH is _really_ bad - GeForce 2 MX 400, started 
with the buzzing less than a month after he got it.

I have to look into replacing it with a silver orb or something :)
