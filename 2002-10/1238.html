Hi,

1. X modelines problem.

I'm running X 4.1(?- I'm in Win at the moment) in Debian, but I've had 
this problem in various configurations and distros, and I've seen it on 
other computers also:

I have a display, and I can use it, bu lines are being drawn strange. A 
'hot' line is drawn on the screen with a different displacement to a 
'cold' line, so that a screen with an xterm has straight vertical lines 
waving in and out as I look down the screen. I am running in 1152x864 on 
 a PCI TNT2, 75hZ refresh, currently with the Nvidia drivers, but 
they've made no difference. I had this problem with Windows also, but I 
dialled the refresh rate back to 72Hz (monitor reports 72.5Hz), which 
works perfectly.

I haven't written any modelines other than what XFree comes up with. I 
did try copying the standard 1152x864 modeline into XF86Config and then 
slowing the dot clock, but I don't think that I did it right, and it 
didn't work, so I commented the lot out.

Next hint please.

2. Cygwin.

Want to use Cygwin-Xfree86 as an X server for other boxes, and also just 
play around with it. It keeps freezing up. The rest of Cygwin is a dream 
come true, but I don't know where to go with this one.

Processor is not full. I start CygX, and get to do a little bit of 
stuff, and then it freezes, aither for a period on the order of a minute 
or so, or just plain forever.

Runnning 98SE on a venerable P233 128MB EDO, help me mister I'm stuck.


Thanks,
James
