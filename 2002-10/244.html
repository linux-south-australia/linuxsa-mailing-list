DSL,

    If the site is still available to us it's on a server that uses 
mysql. But I can't confirm this until early next week. but certainly in 
time for your proposed BBQ.  

    There seems to be a fairly good response to this concept, and a side 
issue, but still quite important of supporting the distro's financially, 
For my $0.02 I could see those involved charging an extra fee, say $1 
per cd or transfer, and putting this into a fund for the appropriate 
distro eg. fee's raised from burning mandrake cd's used to maintain at 
least a mandrake club membership, so that linuxsa was seen to be 
contributing to the opensource community internationally.

This would also mean that on a regular basis Service members would 
report in how many they had distributed that month and deposit funds 
appropriately. On an Honor basis of course. It would also give us an 
idea of the numbers and popularity of distro's across adelaide.
 
    This would be seperate from the funds raised from meetings, raffles 
etc. for which I agree, it would be more appropriate to look 
specifically to Australian contributors and support them. Presuming of 
course we can find a means of locating them.

&gt;&gt;I'd be willing to be a Northern distributor, only I don't yet have
&gt;&gt;Bandwidth. But, I could pick up a copy from one of those with bandwidth.
&gt;&gt;I do, I'll have to confirm this, have access to a subdomain for the page
&gt;&gt;and I have the time and ability to  do the page if we get this far. On
&gt;&gt;an Aussie server, free.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would need some type of database backend, preferably MySQL but
&gt;Postgres would be fine, so that people could dynamically change their
&gt;details, register and so forth...
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Like DSL I would be interested in enough to cover the disks, I would
&gt;&gt;need to set up transfer facillities ie I don't have a network yet. I do
&gt;&gt;now have an old box I'm about to set up.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Seeing this is my idea, I'll see what I can do about synchronising
&gt;things such that when a new release comes out we all have the latest
&gt;copies. I'm a sociable person, perhaps all the distributors could meet
&gt;over dinner in town or a pub?
