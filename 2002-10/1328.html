Yep.  You'll find IMAP a lot better in the long run, as using
a standard protocol allows you to alter the mail system but
be transparent to the users.

If you do this you should configure all mail clients to use
IMAP, including mutt.  Save yourself pain and only offer
IMAP/SSL to remote IMAP clients (you may as well let localhost
use plain IMAP as this will drop the CPU usage of the web
gateway).

Courier seems to have the best set of compromises for a
small-medium IMAP server.

The best web/IMAP gateway is yet to be written.  IMP is fine
for small rollouts but its session management is poor so it
generates a lot more IMAP commands than a real mail client
would.  This improves with each version.  There's a hack called
ImapProxy which solves the IMAP session issue, and you need
this for medium-sized rollouts.

You also need to tune PHP for medium rollouts (PHP4 has
file-based session management, you need to alter this to
use shared memory to get any sort of performance if you
already have an I/O hit from another application, such as
your IMAP server).

IMP is real-world hardened.  So if you configure it
conservatively and enable some features like SMTP
authentication then it's difficult for students to
misuse the facility.

Maildir is a nice design with one downside -- it renames all
the files in a folder upon a IMAP SELECT.  A rename is an
expensive operation on most filesystems.  Pine, Mutt and
some web IMAP gateways issue a lot of SELECTs, so Maildir
wouldn't be suitable for mass rollouts of those clients.

If you have a big Maildir rollout, I'd think about the
filesystem issues closely.  Good performance with small
files, large directories, non-synchronous file renames.
Pretty much screaming "xfs", with "resierfs" as a second
choice.

Maildir saves each message in a single file.  This means that
you need to configure enough inodes.  In practice this means
that a Maildir-based system needs its own disk, partition or
RAID set.
