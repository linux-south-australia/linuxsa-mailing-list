Has anybody tried redhat 8.0 with a promise IDE RAID lite 100 (and whatever
else it's called) controller?  the latest download only talks about 7.3 but
i want to put on 8.0

tried doing all the bits it told me to but it doesn't see the controller.
i've got it setup as a RAID 1 which is all cool, but it detects as two ide
drives.  no probs, the readme talks about that, but still doesn't help me
much.

Here's the readme in case you gurus can point me in the right direction.  I
have to do the 'With IDE issue' and type all the extra woffle down the
bottom which tells linux not to detect but what it is, i take it.

In case you are wondering it's the gigabyte GA-6VXDR7 mother, tho i would
have thought it'd matter.

also i have looked on promise's site and found:

<A HREF="http://www.promise.com/support/linux2_eng.asp?mode">http://www.promise.com/support/linux2_eng.asp?mode</A>=linux_download&product_id
=15

but they don't have 8.0 listed.  Obviously it's been out for a week or so,
but it'd be nice to get this going rather than have to reload/upgrade it
later one.

Sorry for the long post.  ava good one.

Matt
