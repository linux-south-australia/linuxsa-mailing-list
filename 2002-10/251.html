&gt; Ok, that's a bit tounge and cheek, but its actually worse than that...
&gt; For all practical purposes, I couldn't really write my own program.

Bear in mind that there's more to programming than just programming.
Most programmers that I know of (and to be brutally honest, I'd have to
lump me into this group [1]) suck at documenting, but any process without
documentation makes it hard for non-programmers to get up and running.
There there are people who are wizards at breaking code, and designing
test cases for that (yes, even Testers), people skills at managing and
communicating with other people (is it SmoothWall that has that charismatic
developer on the mailing list?), people with expertise outside of the
computing domain but overlapping with the problem you're trying to solve
(don't come looking my way for accounting skills, there's a good reason
why I pay others to do that for me).

So don't sell yourself short, James.  You're certainly capable of
stringing together a sentence that can get past the DSL radar.  ;-)



[1]  But I am getting better [2], provided you don't make me use Word.
[2]  Actually, I do OK, but it's one of my "focussed" tasks, which means
     I need to sit in a quiet room, with no distractions or interruptions
     (phone and pager off) and then be in "the zone".  As Tom DeMarco said,
     the typical office environment is a killer to all of those requirements.
