Funny how things differ from country to country. I was going to be 
critical of ISP/Telstra but mayhap I shall refrain because the ones 
who have posted here in the past have made their position quite 
clear.

This post reflects the term "leech"... you know the term, the much 
maligned computer denizen of Australia, whose role in destroying the 
IT infrastructure is legendary, and whose unwholesome appetite for 
everything digital was costing the poor telcos untold grief.

Well, funny how things are different here.  The beast of Aus. that 
was heroically cast down and the world of IT saved is, well, emm 
normal..

Yup normal, believe it or not, the leech-beast, is a perfectly normal 
beastie whose place in the IT infrastructure is now acknowledged and 
deemed a normal part of how things work.

The leech-beast is known about, quantified, identified, and 
categorised and has been found to be acceptable in the grand scheme 
of things.

Oh well, looks like our wonderful Telstra can spin more frightening 
stories than common sense can overcome :-)

£30 (90 dollars) Always on, all you can eat, and man! I had no idea 
there was soooo much Paul Oakenfold stuff out there :-)

PS there is good competion here, not the nobbled stuff like in Aus 
with little players scrapping over the thin margins made available by 
Telstra. Until Telstra is sorted out were screwed.

Just my 0.2c worth

Steve D
back in Aus soon :-)
