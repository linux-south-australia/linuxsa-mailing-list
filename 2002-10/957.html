&gt; That's not possible.  Proof by counter-example: You send me an SMS but
&gt; my mobile burns before it arrives, and I don't replace it.

ok, what I meant was a garantee of either delivery or notification of
failure. Email tends to do this, but not real well. SMS is far worse.
Best I've seen was in finger, you are able to tell when the person
last read their mail, or how old the oldest unread message is. I know,
there's issues with this and so on as well... But I still think
something better (for both SMS and email) is possible with some
thought.

&gt; 
&gt; An achievable alternative is some sort of receipt that guarantees the
&gt; user has read it.  We've long had delivery receipts, but that's not
&gt; good enough.  Microsoft mailers can also give read receipts, which I
&gt; think is a darned good idea.  All mail readers should honour that.

Kinda, but I think the protocol should be enhanced to make this part
of it. Also, I'd like to see some sort of non-receipt, for when the
mail server gets it, but it hasn't been read for X period of time.
Maybe a message expiry time, so I can send a "Lunch?" message, which
will dissappear after 1pm.
