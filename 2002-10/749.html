Squid is far too disk intensive to run on a diskless machine.  I know
that Novel (for one) wrote a paper explaining that it's faster to use
a fast fileserver, but I think they were wrong.  You really should run
squid on the same machine that stores the cache.

Logs are another issue.  If the machine is diskless then you have no
alternative but to send logs to another machine.  Fortunately syslogd
can already do that (without needing a network mounted filesystem.)

I can understand why you might want to have a diskless firewall, but
another possibility, which you might not have considered, is using a
solid-state disk.  They are a bit pricy, costing around a dollar per
megabyte, but they have they are small, silent and require no cooling.
You would load your operating system and configuration, and set the
machine up so that nothing was written to the local file store.  Any logs,
or whatever, would be saved on network mounted filesystems.
