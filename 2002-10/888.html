&gt;     I think that everybody here is just missing the point.
&gt; Why do Australian telcos have a download cap at all? Why do
&gt; they have such exorbitant fees at all? Basically because
&gt; they can.

I'd quite appreciate if you could read what I've written on this subject
today, and then come back.  The point is that they have download caps
because they need to, and the fees are not exorbitant.


&gt;    If we lived in Canada, or the US or Ireland or somewhere
&gt; where they do have good service, then we would have no
&gt; download limit, be paying on average AUD$30 per month, and
&gt; have installation and after sales support at a realisic
&gt; level.

Are you sure?  Have a look at <A HREF="http://www.irelandoffline.org,">http://www.irelandoffline.org,</A> where
they are campaigning for affordable, unmetered and broadband internet
access in Ireland.  Converting to AUD, they say:

  In Curitiba, Brazil it costs $113 a month for a 1Mb line.
  In Santiago, Chile it costs $66 a month for a 256k line.
  In Estonia, it costs $66 a month for a 512k/128k line 
  In Ireland, it costs $197 a month for a 512k/128k line 

Internode sell ADSL from $50 per month for a 256k line, $60 for a 512k
line, and $110 for a 1.5M line.

At <A HREF="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021009/175/dbgq7.html">http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021009/175/dbgq7.html</A> you can read that,
"In recent weeks a number of ISPs have drastically undercut the leading
players, including BT and Freeserve, by offering sub-£20 per month deals
for broadband services."  That's AUD57 per month for a 512K service, and
it's a metered service.

As recently as June, Bell Canada introduced new broadband plans, starting
at AUD55 for 1GB/month.  Visit <A HREF="http://www.rbua.org">http://www.rbua.org</A> to see how Canada is
not so cheap, nor so unlimited as you suggest.

And at <A HREF="http://www.connectusa.org">http://www.connectusa.org</A> you can find a report, titled, "Behind
the High Speed Slowdown," that complains about ever increasing broadband
costs.  They say, "DSL service from local phone companies rang in at
$51.36 a month, up 7% from $47.84 a year ago."  That's AUD94 per month.

US West, picked quite at random, have offers from USD21.95 per month for
256K.  And that does NOT include modem rental, nor ISP.  Look again: NOT
INCLUDING ISP.  That's AUD40 per month, plus modem, plus ISP.

Let's be honest here.  US is more expensive.  Canada is more expensive.
UK is more expensive.  Ireland is more expensive.  Chile is more expensive.
Brazil is more expensive.  Estonia is more expensive.  Canada is capped.
UK is capped.  Ireland is capped.  I presume, since the ISP isn't included,
that US is capped, too.

Australia is beginning to look like a real bargain.


&gt;     I get bombarded with broadband advertising from telstra
&gt; constantly. $55 for a "permanent" broadband connection (but
&gt; no permanent IP addresses) and 20 times faster than dialup
&gt; (set by law at the moment to mean 19.2k, not up to 56k many
&gt; people get on a modem)

Might it say, *up to* 20 times faster?  1.5Mbps ADSL in fact 30 times
faster than a 56K modem, but there you are.


&gt;     Now I can hear a few of you out there sniggering about
&gt; Telstra (see that is why we left them and went elsewhere).
&gt; Well I might point out that Cable & Wireless (Optus) is one

C&W don't own Optus anymore.  It's now SingTel Optus.


Now can we stop this flinging of false facts, this constant carping
on costs, this determined demand for discounted DSL?  Surely what the
facts show is that capping is reasonable, and that capped or not, we
have cheap data in Australia.
