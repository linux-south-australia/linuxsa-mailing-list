Suse treats this matter a bit differently. They do allow free downloads of 
their latest release but only after a month or so. The Suse list does not 
think highly of people wanting to download the most recent release. They are 
freeloaders. People are encouraged to buy the package and support Linux 
developement. I guess it is a matter of $ and survival et al Mandrake. However 
it would be good exposure for Suse to be distribute with the others. What do 
you say ?

&gt; from him.  very good service.  just about every distro & version for $75 -
&gt; about 25 discs.
&gt; Prolly he got sick of sticking CDs in his burner.  :)
&gt;
&gt; I personally think that the distro's themselves should get their marketing
&gt; act together and at least have a contact in australia that distributes CDs
&gt; and the profits go back to the programmers for more of the good stuff.
&gt; places like everythinglinux.com.au etc are quick which is good, but at the
&gt; end of the day it doesn't really help redhat/mandrake financially.
&gt;
&gt; anyway, that's my 2 cents worth.

&gt; &gt; So,
&gt; &gt; What are people willing to pay per CD for this kind of service?
&gt;
&gt; (including
&gt;
&gt; &gt; postage?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $5? $10? $20 per set?
&gt;
&gt; $10 a set seems about the mark.  That's what a set of M9 discs cost to
&gt; order (plus postage) at everything-linux.com.au.  Might be a bit of waiting
&gt; for those though . . . . till they get them stamped.  The price would
&gt; equate to about the same as DSL suggested too ($3/disc).
&gt;
&gt; Karun Zambiec was selling discs at a reasonable price too.  Haven't heard
&gt; whether he's still doing it though.  Can't remember his web address so if
&gt; you're interested, it's probably in the Linux-SA archives somewhere.
