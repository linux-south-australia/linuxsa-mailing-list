Hmm, I'm definitely leaning towards the more complex. :)

I'd want to do a few more things, such as running esd on it and so on - 
in fact that may be the first step. I could hit the remote esd instance 
from my notebook instead of the local one when playing music, so the 
music actually gets played through the stereo instead of my notebook's 
tinny speakers. Storage for the oggs themselves will probably be on a 
separate machine in the end, as well.

Still, for me, a requirement would be having a device near the stereo to 
play the music. This would run the decoder with playlist, a 
network-accessable esd instance and a web application server. I want it 
close to the stereo to minimise the length of the RCA run - less 
interference and less cable snaking all over the house. Another req 
would be to have a UI close to the stereo as well. This just needs to be 
a web browser and a pointing device (a touch screen would work well, as 
was pointed out to me off-list), and needs to be close becuase most 
people will head over to to the stereo when they want to listen to some 
music.

So I may as well combine the two devices into the one machine. I'd like 
to netboot it so it can be diskless, but I don't know if that is 
possible with a mac. I'd also like to use it for automatically ripping 
and encoding new CDs. So for me, having an iMac sitting on top of the 
stereo is pretty useful.

Note that due to lack of time and hardware, this won't be happening in 
the near future, but I can dream. ;)
