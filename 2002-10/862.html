like I said - I think our local businesses are doing a fantastic job with
what they've been dumped with.  Internode provide a great service at a great
price - indeed I am amazed they can do what they do - their margins must be
quite small.

If I had an issue with ISPs I would not be paying one for an 8GB account @
512k.  But because I am consumer I think it gives me some right to speak out
on this.  It sucks..  There...

And I am talking on where we need this nation to be - and it certainly is
not a nation lumbered with harsh caps.  In 2 - 3 years Australia will be
seriously handicapped if we don't get this fixed.  We will still be churning
out sheep while half of Asia own half of Australia because they had the
foresight to do something about it.

&gt; Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; great - and we all love to trash members of lesser species 
&gt; - but if we think
&gt; &gt; about it for a moment - I don't recall *one* person from 
&gt; David's BBQ that
&gt; &gt; was happy with the status quo.  Funny how on the list we 
&gt; are all superior to
&gt; &gt; all other consumers - but in person we are just like everyone else.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a very self-destructive attitude (where would we be 
&gt; without users?), but a 
&gt; very difficult one to avoid after you've spent the last few 
&gt; days repairing the 
&gt; damage caused by a user ignoring your "Don't switch this 
&gt; machine off" directive.
&gt; 
&gt; I imagine that all skilled tradespersons have something similar - car 
&gt; mechanics, plumbers, doctors, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was the only person there who is actually getting ADSL - 
&gt; I am the only
&gt; &gt; person that thinks the status quo sucks here - but not one 
&gt; person justifying
&gt; &gt; the status quo (who is subject to it - not the ones getting 
&gt; deals through
&gt; &gt; their employer or otherwise) is planning on getting ADSL.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why 
&gt; don't you all have
&gt; &gt; ADSL?
&gt; 
&gt; I do. 3 gig is more than enough for my housemate and I. 
&gt; Actually, we're 
&gt; thinking of taking it down to 1 gig. Then again, neither of 
&gt; us spend much time 
&gt; at home, and we don't game online.
&gt; 
&gt; We've actually got it fairly good here in Adelaide. $80 per 
&gt; month for a very 
&gt; fast link, decent uptime, and a fairly large bandwidth cap. 
&gt; Sounds like good 
&gt; value to me.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't want to pay nearly that much if I wasn't employed 
&gt; full time, however.
&gt; 
&gt; (No, I don't work for Internode, but I used to work for an ISP)
