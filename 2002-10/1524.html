Open source legal risks
Opinions from AustralianIT.com.au readers
OCTOBER 30, 2002 	
	
MANY readers disagreed with the view that Australian organisations need to
beware legal risks when using open source. Read Your Say!

I don't know what kind of reputation the Australian is hoping to engender
for its IT section, "Australian IT", but it certainly can't be assisted by
the inadequately researched, parroted fear mongering that Jennifer Foreshew
scribbled together at the last minute for this article.

Just paraphrasing the words of a supposed authority figure isn't enough -
where is the research to validate the claims made by Ms Debra Tippett? Where
are the links to the appropriate sites, such as the GNU General Public
Licence (especially the FAQ), or the Apache Licence? 

Claims such as warranties not being enforceable need to be substantiated.
For example, would Ms Foreshew care to provide an example of a piece of
commercial software which the manufacturer warrants is fit for use or even
merchantability? Would Ms Foreshew also care to provide a reference to a
damages claim that was successfully persecuted against a software supplier
by a customer whose data was damaged or lost? 

As for "click through" style licences which are vaguely referenced in the
article: "Open-source free licences are generally over the internet and
assent to enter into the licence generally occurs when somebody modifies or
distributes the actual program or any work based on that," Ms Tippett said. 

Click-through licencing is rampant in all fields - even Microsoft is guilty
of this heinous crime - with DirectX updates (for example) being distributed
from their "Windows Update" website - automatically downloading software for
the user, and presenting a brief dialog which essentially states, "agree to
this licence or the installation can't continue." 

Ms Foreshew's time could probably be better spent (or perhaps some atonement
could be achieved) by quoting and paraphrasing the GNU General Public
Licence FAQ, and contrasting the rights granted, reserved and revoked by the
GPL versus a commercial licence. 

As an example of the "problems" of the GPL, Ms Foreshew could do a lot worse
than examine the case of the WINE project vs Transgaming with their WineX
package. 

This is the quality of "reporting" that I would expect of a Microsoft
agitprop, not a reporter from a respected national newspaper.

Elsewhere on the internet this story would have been followed by a comment:
"Please don't feed the troll." It is good to see that AustralianIT does its
part to prevent this species from becoming extinct.

As well as the comments made by others, I'd also like to point out these
facts: 

Version 2 of the GPL has been around just over 11 years, and has in fact
been tested in court many times despite Ms Tippet's unfounded claims to the
contrary. 

She also appears to not understand the difference between copyright and
licensing. Copyright is about ownership and protection of the work.
Licensing is about permitting people other than the copyright holder to use
that work. No open source license removes copyright from a software program,
hence the developers of that software are, in fact, protected. 

Also, despite Ms Tippet's claims, assent to an open source license begins,
as it should, when one uses that work. If you run a GPL'd program, you have
agreed to the terms and conditions of the GPL. That's the whole idea of
licensing - if you don't agree to the terms, you are not legally entitled to
use the software. Ms Tippet incorrectly states that the license only takes
effect if one redistributes or modifies the work. 

Another sadly amusing statement was that incorporating GPL'd software into
another work and then selling it was violating the GPL. Ms Tippet should
actually read the GPL before making further false claims about it. 

"When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price",
says the preamble, which goes on to say that one can "charge for this
service if you wish". If GPL'd software was not able to be sold, then how do
the many Linux distribution vendors get away with doing that very thing? No,
Ms Tippet is once again either grossly negligent or plain lying. 

Finally, another claim "The lack of a liability regime also meant the
distributor was not liable for defects in the product", which others have
spoken about from another view, everyone go and read the two simple
sentences which make up the entire first clause of the GPL. Particularly the
second one, which lays down the very foundation of a liability regime. 

What should be made of this point however is yes, no software engineer has
ever been held liable for their work, and its about time that - like other
engineering fields - it happens. Microsoft has become very rich not only
through criminal means (which is why I cannot run or support their software
- I would be an accessory to their crimes), but through the practise of
charging the consumer for bug fixes (with the marketing spin that its a
completely new version). They're certainly not the only software company
guilty of this, but they're the largest and hence the easiest target. 

If a civil engineer builds a bridge and a truck drives over it and it
collapses, he/she is liable. Similarly, when a software engineer at
Microsoft build an operating system and it spontaneously collapses (infamous
blue screen of death) they should be liable. 

I suggest Ms Tippet that next time you want to collect your bonus from
Microsoft for publically bashing the GPL, you do some basic homework first,
like actually bothering to read it, so you don't come out looking like such
a clown.

This is complete hogwash: 
"From a copyright point of view, developers are most at risk because they
lose the ability to assert ownership. But from the customer's point of view,
the warranties, indemnities, the IP ownership and all those sorts of things
are important." 

How is this any different from ANY other software license? For example a
proprietary license removes the right of ownership from the user/developer
and most mainstream proprietary licenses also limit warranties and
indemnities. 

The GPL, like EVERY other license is there to protect the IP of the author,
in this case the author has elected to give a developer the right to use
their code in another product provided they also distribute the source code
to their users. The GPL is designed so that authors can protect their IP
from commercial misuse. It's every person's right to want to maintain the
freedom of their IP. 

I find Microsoft's 'Shared Source' FAR more dangerous. In this case a
developer is allowed to see the code BUT not use it in any way. It's common
for a developer to be influenced by code they see and the danger is, after
seeing MS Code, they will be influenced to an extend where they
unconsciously re-write the MS code. They may then be liable for breaching MS
copyright. 

Open Source does not equal the GPL. If you don't want to be worried about
the GPL then don't use GPL licensed software, it's as simple as that.

What a one-sided, narrow-minded view. 

Forget about the fact that GPL protects its contributors' works from being
stolen then sold for profit by the likes of Microsoft. Forget about the
freedom it gives its users. Forget about all the good it facilitates where
people cannot afford expensive buggy software, eg the third world.

Can't you find something original to report? This is simply a repetition of
the lies and misdirections that we've been getting from Microsoft for
several years here in the US, and it is no more true today than it ever was.

I'm not convinced by the legal "expertise" shown here. Most issues are
rather trivial if you actually read a license like the GPL. 

"..distributor was not liable for defects in the product, which may cause
data loss or systems to crash." 
You mean like Microsoft products? 

"From a copyright point of view, developers are most at risk because they
lose the ability to assert ownership." 
No, developers retain all of their copyright. 

"...they could incorporate it into a program for their employer" 
And what if they incorporate proprietary code? GPL-code is no bigger legal
risk than that, is it? 

"...be distributed for a price" 
So? That's allowed, it thought that was quite clear in the GPL.

Matt, Westbourne Park 

I'm no legal expert, but when this article says "The lack of a liability
regime also meant the distributor was not liable for defects in the product,
which may cause data loss or systems to crash," I struggle to find a EULA
for any software that does allow legal action to be taken against the
company. Should this not be the case, I think that there would be a few
thousand Australian sites that would like to have a word to Microsoft about
the security of IIS. 

I'm also unsure as to how your claim on IP suddenly vanishes when making use
of the GPL or other licenses. Besides, developers should evaluate any
license before shipping software under it. Unlike most licenses, the GPL and
BSD licenses are quite readable.

Okay, they say users are concerned with warranties and who is responsible
for software. Well, Microsoft is not responsible for their software either. 

If someone actually reads the end user license agreement for a Microsoft
product they would notice that Microsoft basically releases themselves of
all liability. So how is open source software different?

Jon Eaves, Melbourne 

After reading the article "Legal traps in open source", I would encourage
people thinking of using open source software to perform their own research
rather than rely on this article for any form of decision making. 

To address just a few of the points: 

Not all open source software is GPL. Most importantly one of the products
that you mention (Apache) does not use GPL as a license, and has their own
which can be viewed at: www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt&gt">http://www.apache.org/LICENSE.txt&gt</A>; 

The next is the implication that developers lose their right to assert
ownership, which is in fact exactly the opposite of what the GPL allows. The
ownership of the portion of software belongs to the creator, essentially
forever. 

Next is the lack of liability for products. This would have to be the most
laughable comment in the article. When was the last time that any software
product was held up for merchantable quality ? In fact most commercial EULA
disclaim all responsibility for what a software product may, or may not do.
At least with open source products there is the capacity to get somebody to
fix it. Either in-house if the experience exists, or externally if not. 

Finally, using GPL software is perfectly allowable, as is incorporating GPL
software into commercial products that are then sold. 

This particular issue is addressed well in the GPL license frequently asked
questions. This can be found here: www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html&gt">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html&gt</A>; 

Of course, I'm not a lawyer. I'm a software developer and this is not legal
advice, just my experiences and research from being involved with such
software for many years. I just couldn't stand to see such a one-sided fear
mongering article published without some form of comment. 

Yes, there can be issues, however the same applies with any form of 3rd
party software, closed or open.
