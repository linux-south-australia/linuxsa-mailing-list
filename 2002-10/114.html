I think Luke was misunderstood.

I have had similar sentiments in the past and have hounded and hounded
distributors to get their act together (or the manufacturer, whatever) and
get the boxed set out.  I wanted to get Mandrake 8.1 but I just lost
interest by the time it became available.

I think Luke is more referring to just getting the software quickly rather
than cheaply.  I think I speak for most if not all of in that we are all
happy to contribute financially to the 'community' when the opportunity
arises.

I even tried to subscribe to Mandrake Club - but Mandrake never responded as
to why they don't accept American Express (yes I know Amex are quite nasty
and maybe this is why).

If Mandrake could somehow arrange speedier production and distribution DVD
sets I think we would all be happy to get it (there is no point getting it
just before the next distro is due out - that's just a waste of money).

The problem with the Linux community (no flames please - I really can't be
bothered) is the lack of emphasis on marketing and finances as I have stated
time and time and time again.  I even emailed Mandrake saying that I want to
give them money if they can just help me with that.

In the end I just have not had time to follow it up.

Maybe we should all just pass the hat around at the next meeting and send
that off to the kernel developers or something..

I totally agree that we should all contribute - but the Linux community
needs to put more emphasis on commercialisation for that to happen (not just
the server market - but desktop too).  I think too many run like charities
which is nice but not feasible in the long term.

FYI - I have already (yes - already) started looking around for the boxed
DVD version of Mandrake 9.0.  Any pointers or ETAs welcome..

&gt; Quoting Luke Vanderfluit &lt;<A HREF="mailto:luke@chipcity.com.au">luke@chipcity.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt; I've tried to get debian 3, suse 8 now there's mandrake 9 and RH8
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've had no luck getting any of those (debian and suse) 
&gt; through this group.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me we need a (or at least one) central point of 
&gt; distribution, 
&gt; &gt; where subscribers to this group can get their copies. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can buy  debian 3 (7 cds), mandrake 9 (3 cds) and RH 8 (6 cds) at 
&gt; &gt; lankum.com for $90 (the lot). I think I might do that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I did go ahead and buy those would anyone be interested 
&gt; in getting copies
&gt; &gt; of these sets? (say $10 excluding postage)
&gt; 
&gt; Why not buy your Linux from the distributors themselves?  
&gt; That way they get 
&gt; money.  That way more software gets written.  All of Red Hat, 
&gt; Mandrake and SuSE 
&gt; employ free software hackers, so buying software from them is 
&gt; good.  Debian 
&gt; takes donations as well I believe (but I'm not sure).
&gt; 
&gt; Support the people who write the software - it's a touch 
&gt; economic climate I 
&gt; know, but if we want &lt;insert your favourite distro here&gt; to 
&gt; survive, you should 
&gt; send money their way.  Free software is not just about free 
&gt; beer, but about 
&gt; freedom as well.
&gt; 
&gt; And I'm not taking a swipe at you in particular Luke, but 
&gt; using this as a 
&gt; chance to get up on my soapbox :)
