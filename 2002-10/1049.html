Microsoft fails with licensing
Kelly Mills
OCTOBER 17, 2002 	
	
MICROSOFT has admitted its new corporate software licensing plan, which came
into effect on August 1, was poorly executed and badly managed.

Speaking at the launch of Microsoft's new Pocket PC Phone, O2 xda, chief
executive Steve Ballmer said the software giant had "learned a lot" about
how they managed the transition of their Licensing 6.0 plan. 

Since August, Microsoft's enterprise customers have been able to purchase
new licences with or without Software Assurance, but they are now unable to
upgrade their pre-existing licences, only replace them. 

Therefore, customers that did not switch to the new plan have not been able
to license Select version 5, Upgrade Advantage (UA) and Software Assurance
(SA) on products they already have. They will have to pay the full price of
their next Windows and Office upgrades, rather than receiving discounted
upgrade prices. 

The scheme was loudly met by resistance by enterprises who felt they were
been pushed into a subscription-based system which forces them into regular
updates. 

"There's huge resentment among enterprises that feel trapped," Gartner
research director Greta James said. "That resentment centres on a lack of
choice - the alternatives to Microsoft are not particularly attractive." 

Mr Ballmer admitted Microsoft had "some work to do" with their licensing
plan. 

"If we were to do it again we would have handled it differently," said Mr
Ballmer. 

He said during his visit to Australia he was meeting with key enterprise
clients and that many of them had already signed on to the scheme. 

"About 60 per cent of our large enterprises have taken up longer-term
licensing." 

He said of the remaining 40 per cent, many of the companies were not ready
to make the transition and that Microsoft still had a bit of work to do with
them.
