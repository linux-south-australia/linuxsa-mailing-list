&gt; I may be wrong, but I don't think you can code any
&gt; Linux 3D accel'd apps with "/no change/" to compile
&gt; on Mac OS X.
&gt; 
&gt; As far as I'm aware, MacOSX native apps need to be
&gt; coded in Cocoa or Carbon, and most likely if you're
&gt; trying to compile something that originated from a
&gt; UNIX platform, you'd be looking at Cocoa.  You need
&gt; a bunch of Cocoa headers put in - its minimal
&gt; porting, but it wont happen automatically.

Apple is not the Apple you remember. They are now a
Unix OS company, which means they release
updates/patches (available online) and they are
actively helping developers. Their OS even has a
compiler thrown in! Microsoft is now the only OS
company I can think of that charges people to write
programs for them.
 
&gt; If you're talking something like Mesa, that runs in
&gt; XDarwin - afaik this is /not/ 3d accelerated (yet). 

Mac OS and supported cards have an OpenGL
implementation (I assume codeveloped by hardware
companies & apple) so you have full hardware support.

I have a friend who does 3D animation on his 2+ year
old MacOS X machine. His MacOS is quite new and he has
devel tools and upgrades. He:

1) downloaded the SDL development libraries and
installed them without any help from me.

2) Downloaded a tarball from me (Linux)

3) Started a new SDL project in developer.

4) Dragged the source files from the tarball into
"project builder" the development environment.

5) Click "build"

6) Copy some models and textures from his Modelling
program to the project directory.

7) Click "run"

My 3D program came up which displayed a few hundred
copies of his model on screen at once.

Ok, this ran at around 1/4 of the performance of my
machine, but I think that is actually what I expected
with his ancient 3D card. There are new Mac's way
faster than his.

This didn't happen the first time, this was only after
learning from my porting mistakes. I had PAGES of
compile errors, but that was because gcc was letting
me get away with naughty namespace abuse on Linux.

Carbon & whatever are not required on MacOS X, and
they do not much more than the Nvidia's Linux packages
above, or the KDE or Gnome development libraries.

MacOS X is very nice to co-develop 3D with Linux on.
It's possible. I do it!
