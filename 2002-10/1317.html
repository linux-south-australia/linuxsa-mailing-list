<PRE>
In preparation for the LinuxSA talk on s390 the other month I thought I'd
demonstrate a genuine web application in a simulated environment. Being a
tinkerer, I decided rather than install PHPNuke or something I'd pretend I
was doing a software engineering application and dummy up something in
server-side Java. There are so many tools labelled 'enterprise' and
'corporate' and so forth that of course it would all be possible. I would
then get the experience of hooking these tools together even if I only
wrote 100 lines of code.

So, for the first time I seriously looked at the Jakarta project.

I eventually abandoned the task due to lack of time, astonished to find
that portable server-side Java is still extremely difficult.

The following message written at the time for LinuxSA (and then lost for a
few weeks :) documents why I maintain that a lot of server-side Java is
not portable to many Linux platforms beause there is no satisfactory
execution environment, directly related to Sun's Java licensing problems.  
It also explains why I think Jakarta Turbine+Velocity is the only portable
server-side Java framework that I've found.

I know there are some genuine Java experts here. Do please educate me!

Subject: Terror in Jakarta, Part I [LONG]


Or, preparation for writing a web/database application using Java
servlets. Or, round-about preparation for a LinuxSA talk on a completely
different topic. Dedicated to all those who who go to jakarta.apache.org
and get terribly confused especially if they are looking for portable
software.

This document is a map of my experiences, not a HOWTO.

If you aren't interested in server-side Java on Linux or BSD, stop reading
right now.

There may not be a part II.

Summary Summary
---------------

If you stick to the shallow end where all the other nice i386 people are
then server-side Java will work for you, even Sun's closed-source JVM will
work. And you might have good reason never to use Perl again.

Summary
-------

But.. finding a portable Linux server-side Java engine looks complicated,
this is just an illusion. It is much worse than that. This is mostly
because of the long-standing problems with Java on free platforms. In
addition the documentation in the land of server-side Java worthy of a
true technocrat. You can't understand it unless you know exactly what they
are talking about, at which point you don't need the documentation anyway.
But it is better than nothing, and worth the price :-) And so you might
have good reason to never use anything but Perl again.

Background
----------

About 5 years ago I had to help analyse webpage generation tools for
someone, and concluded that Java Servlets were better suited to
traditional software engineering than Perl/CGI. As part of this I did a
bit of Java Servlet writing. I learned that after a fair bit of mindless
repeating of basic constructs in what seemed to be the Servlet way you can
do some powerful things. Ok, so servlets were a better way forward for
people building a business on pumping out websites. Which I wasn't, so I
promptly forgot all about them. 

From then on, every time I wanted a web application (not very often at
all) I knocked something up in Perl or sometimes PHP. I've done some XML,
but not for the web. I tend to do operating systems and infrastructure or
whole-system technology things rather than apps. So I forgot Java Servlets
even more.

Then in 2002 I wanted to write a demonstration database-driven website.
For once I thought I'd do it neatly and cleanly even if it was just a
simple thing that could just as well be done using any langauge.

I did the same analysis again and concluded that despite all that Perl has
to offer now -- and Perl::Mason works well, with a brilliant persistance
model, I've been modifying RT 2.1 a bit along with some other subscribers
to this list -- if I was pretending my little demo was a software
engineering project intended to produce code that could be reused in many
places, starting with Servlets would be better than Perl. One of the
reasons is that the separation of software layers is better documented,
which is not surprising because Java is a lot more corporate than Perl.

I also concluded that PHP simply wasn't in the running, because with PHP
presentation is inextricably mingled with application logic in ways which
are not good for a large, complex and well-designed project. PHP would
have been more than adequete for the job and much quicker though, in fact
if I had chosen PHP the job would have been finished in less time that it
took to write this document :-) Such is the life of a dabbler.

Thrashing Around
----------------

Like most people I was aware of the Jakarta project over at apache.org,
and that Sun donated some code to Jakarta which is now the reference port
of the Java Servlet specification. So off I went to jakarta.apache.org.
There's six "frameworks and engines" to choose from, and five "server
applications". Not to mention twelve XML packages. Oops! What happened to
the good old days when you just needed Jserve and a JVM (and hours to wait
for each execution?)

The servlet engine is easy, that's Tomcat. But Turbine seems to be an
application framework where a lot of preliminary work has been done with
servelets for the basic things every dynamic website needs. So I thought
right, Turbine it is. Little did I know.

Anyway, I thought I'd install Turbine under Debian 3.0 with other OSs to
follow if that worked. Under Debian that's

   apt-get install turbine

which worked perfectly. The dependencies required a JVM of couse, and I
didn't have one so apt installed gij, which surprised me. Is gij really
ready for use? After some poking around I discovered that gij is regarded
as a minor part of gcj, or at least hardly worthy of any documentation.
See http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1/gcj for the manual describing
gcj. Since servlets don't exercise the biggest missing part of the
classpath reimplementation included with gcj (anything to do with graphics
such as AWT and Swing) it seems Turbine runs perfectly with gij.

That's good, because apart from anything else gij appears to be among the
slimmest jvm available for mainstream OSs, and quite fast. Java/XML
libraries also came with Turbine, which seems a fairly obvious thing to
provide.

Now to try it out. Started reading the docs... whoops. No way. Guess what,
when the Apache project says at
http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/index.html:

   Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
   developers to quickly build secure web applications.

they actually mean something quite different along the lines of "Turbine
is a templating engine that you use if you want JavaServer Pages"
Unfortunately I never noticed that this is what they say about Turbine on
the main Jakarta page.

So, if I'm going to use Turbine then I won't be using the Servlet API.
Which is ok, because under servlets you have to have a printf statement
for every line of HTML. With JSP (built on JavaBeans) you just call Java
Classes from certain special tags built into static HTML page. Raw servlet
code:

	out.println("<HTML>");
	out.println("<HEAD><TITLE>Bom Dia"</TITLE></HEAD>");
	out.println("<BODY>");
	if (whatever complicated logic you like) {
		out.println("Bom Dia");
	}
	out.println("</BODY></HTML>");

The servlet container handles all the CGI-like things for you. If you've
done a little of this years ago, like me, this is what Sun's Jserv lets
you do. It isn't CGI, so some problems with CGI don't exist, but the
concepts are very similar. There's plenty of hard work required, which is
why so many things have been built on top of it in the Jakarta project.

Raw JSP code (modified from Sun's JSP userguide, with a couple of bits
missing):

	<%@ page import="hello.NameHandler" %>
	<jsp:useBean id="mybean" scope="page" class="hello.NameHandler" />
	<jsp:setProperty name="mybean" property="*" />
	<html>
	<head><title>Bom Dia</title></head>
	<%@ include file="myfancyheader.html" %>
	<body>
		<%if ( request.getParameter("username") != null ) {%>
			<P>You are logged in!</P>
		<% } %>
	</body>
	</html>
	
ought to be really familiar to Perl::Mason programmers or ASP programmers.
JSP also involves quite a bit of work, and it is easy to write bad
applications which conflate the user interface and application logic.

Anyway, curious to see what tools are available these days to build on top
of Servlets to save me all those printfs - besides JSP - I tried to
install Tomcat:

	apt-get install tomcat4 tomcat4-webapps

(Note for Debian users: don't try apt-get install tomcat, instead of
diverting to tomcat4 it complains that it can't find anything. That's a
minor package naming problem in Debian, now fixed since _I think_ since
mentioning it to the maintainer.)

But that won't work. Why? Because I'm running Debian on an Alpha
architecture, and the Debian Tomcat package requires a full JVM, and this
doesn't exist for the Alpha/Linux architecture. There are some binaries at
http://www.support.compaq.com/alpha-tools/software.html that are alleged
to work (ok, they do work), but I'm not too keen for reasons as follows.
So much for write-once-run-anywhere <snort> ! This is a direct consequence
of Java being released under a closed source license, see
http://www.dwheeler.com/java-imp.html. The Blackdown project is working on
improving multiplatform support at
http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/ports.html but currently only do i386,
ppc, s390 and ARM. And besides, they can't release open source code since
they have agreed to Sun's licensing conditions. My eventual target
platform is s390 but with no guarantee as to version updates due to
licensing, I can't use any version of Sun's JDK. The current version isn't
even available for s390, and some parts of the Jakarta project require it.

Ok, back to Turbine. Does it or does it not actually have servlets
underneath? Seems unlikely given that it doesn't need a JVM and doesn't
depend on Tomcat, but apache.org's description indicates it does. Looking
at http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/turbine-3/apidocs/overview-tree.html,
and
http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/turbine-3/xref/org/apache/turbine/Turbine.html
which says at the top:

	/* Turbine is the main servlet for the entire system. It is
	<code>final</code> because you should <i>not</i> ever need to
	subclass this servlet. */

it looks like gcj is really all that is required for Servlets after
all. Its about time to start testing.

Hmm, as a side-note, ever heard of the Walt Disney company? The people
that want permission to hack your personal computer without warning at any
time just in case you might be infringing copyright law in some country or
other? They do opensource, a philosophy that many feel is aimed at
stopping them get such access :-) I'm completely overloaded with SSJ
technologies so I won't even look at it but
http://opensource.go.com/TeaServlet/index.html has all the gory details.
Aparently they invented it to handle the big problems they had on Disney's
websites. Its a funny old world.

Enter David Bullock from the LinuxSA list. He does Java websites for a
living. His advice for a newbie wanting a quick start? Use www.pajes.org.
And given the description:

   A large portion of any Web based application development requires a
   great deal of HTML coding. PAJES is a 100% Java, standards based, Open
   Source Servlet Presentation Framework for generating HTML without
   having to embed HTML tags within your Java code, and without having to
   embed any Java or other non-HTML instructions within your HTML
   documents.

it is exactly what I'm looking for! Hang on, no it isn't. Looking at the
architecture docs:

   The only prerequisite is the 2.2 or later servlet API, which is
   supported by almost all application servers, webservers and webserver
   servlet plug-ins.

and
 
   Make sure you have Java 2 installed on the machine that will run the
   demonstration (Java 2 Standard Edition runtime is fine). You can
   download the Java 2 environment free from Sun Micrososystems
   (www.javasoft.com/products). 

which as previously discussed is a very nonportable approach, rather a
shame for a language intended to be extremely portable.

Back to Turbine. The more I browse through the code (not the docs, which
I don't find very helpful) the less it seems designed to interact with the
world. It does seem to save some effort in writing things that do produce
output though not necessarily specific to HTML. But I notice that another
Jakarta project called Velocity is built on Turbine and seems to be a
general approach for content generation with servlets. 

	apt-cache search velocity 

returns no results, so it isn't packaged for Debian. But 

	$ wget http://jakarta.apache.org/.../velocity-1.3.1-rc2.tar.gz
	$ tar zxvf velocity-1.3.1-rc2.tar.gz ; cd velocity-1.3.1-rc2
	$ ls *jar 
        velocity-1.3.1-rc2.jar  velocity-dep-1.3.1-rc2.jar
	   :
           :

Not finished yet :-)
