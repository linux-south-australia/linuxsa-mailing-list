Hi David,

&gt; We've got so many charlatans waving MCSE's
&gt;

I think I have already told the story of the MCP course I was part of a 
couple of years back. I was one of the two students that helped with 
the course, ran Prac sessions etc, tutored others, and thought I had 
actually gained some real practical knowledge from it. Others spent all 
their wake time boning up on the cheats.

Comes the exam, two of the class failed, myself and another. He had 
much greater knowledge than me, had loads of sysadmin and real life 
experience with W2K. He is the kind of guy you should employ because he 
does the job and does it well.

Some of the class earned good scores, others just earned points for 
knowing the questions and then matching the right answer from the 
cheats they had studied. An example, one guy had no system building nor 
admin experience. He only used a WFW 3.11 system at home until we 
started the course. He had no access to any network except when 
attending the training sessions and only once did he get to build a 
network from scratch. He got almost every question right, missed only 1 
or 2! How come?

MS tell us that the MCP course requires at least a year of practical 
sysadmin experience. Bull!

I will take your method of testing any day. You want people you know 
can do the job, not just those who have learnt how to pass tests. A job 
is working every day doing a wide range of tasks in a wide range of 
scenarios, not just a one day test on a limited range of questions.

And a disclaimer. I expect there are many out there with an MS 
certification who really do know their job and are a worthy attribute 
to their firm. I congratulate them for making the certification levels 
and confirming their skills. However there are quite a few others who 
have passed the MS testing and still know Jack!

Cheers,  Ian
