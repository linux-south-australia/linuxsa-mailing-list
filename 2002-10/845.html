Hmmm...

&gt; &gt; Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to define what download
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; reasonably well and not in small print.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but nobody reads the small print. Also, it might make perfect sense to 
&gt; you, but that's no guarantee that Joe Blow will understand it.

I quote:

* not in small print
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I read in contractrual law that having "small print" can be a justification for 
making a whole contract, or part of the contract void.

&gt; &gt; I take your point, but to it still doesn't put them in the best position. 
&gt; &gt; Simply because one is ignorant doesn't justify what one does.
&gt; 
&gt; True, but an ISP shouldn't exploit the fact that nobody reads the small
&gt; print.

And people should read the whole contract. I think the best that will come of 
this is that the ISP's will be told to make it more clear what they're saying, 
but it would be extraordinarily difficult for a customer to squirm out of it.

Think of this conversation:

"Did we give you a copy of the contract?"
 YES

"Did you read it?"
 NO

...and the case gets thrown out of court.

Or:

"Did you understand the contact?"
 NO

"Did you seek clarification?"
 NO

...and the case gets thrown out of court.

"Do you understand what [the explanation for downloaded data] means?"
 YES

"What's your problem then?"
 IT COSTS TOO MUCH

"Did you sign the contract?
 YES

...and the case gets thrown out of court.

&gt; If I need a lawyer to purchase Internet access there's something terribly 
&gt; wrong. Hell, if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n
&gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something wrong.

I agree, but I doubt that anything particularly wrong happens. Broadband is 
relatively new and if people treat it the same as a dialup connection but 
faster and then get a huge bill they'll probably try to blame someone else at 
first.
