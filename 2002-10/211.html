&gt; 
&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; We have been customers of AirNet for some time and our Project has 5 
&gt; accounts with them. I have no other relationship with them and the 
&gt; following information is readily available from reports that AirNet 
&gt; provided.
&gt; 
&gt; From March to around August/September AirNet were shafted by 
&gt; Hellstra's 
&gt; incompetence and belligerent attitude, well they didn't fix 
&gt; the problem 
&gt; that Hellstra caused. The fault was with equipment owned and operated 
&gt; by Hellstra and it kept kicking AirNet's clients offline, or else 
&gt; refusing to allow them to connect. Hellstra kept telling the 
&gt; public to 
&gt; take it up with AirNet as they are the ISP. TIO was just as 
&gt; useless for 
&gt; also insisting that AirNet were the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally ACCC were brought into the picture and the TIO and 
&gt; Hellstra got 
&gt; the message to fix the problem as it wasn't AirNet's equipment and it 
&gt; wasn't under AirNet's control. Thank goodness for some sort of sanity 
&gt; in the telcom industry.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem cost clients hundreds of dollars in connection 
&gt; charges and 
&gt; it cost AirNet hundreds of clients who got so fed up with not being 
&gt; able to connect. It cost AirNet buckets of dough and time trying to 
&gt; resolve a problem that wasn't of their own making.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually AirNet dropped Hellstra and went over to iPrimus 
&gt; and things 
&gt; have been much better since that change.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ISP in a similar situation would probably have gone 
&gt; through similar 
&gt; trouble trying to get such a problem resolved and I hold no grudges 
&gt; against the company, I think Hellstra needs a fair boot in 
&gt; the backside 
&gt; for their attitude and poor problem solving structure. 
&gt; Likewise the TIO 
&gt; deserves a bucketing for insisting that the ISP was at fault when it 
&gt; was clearly nothing of the ISP's doing.
&gt; 
&gt; Your problems may or may not be connected to this fault but there are 
&gt; many out there who were affected by the problem but may not have 
&gt; understood the background.
&gt; 
&gt; As for the community wireless thing. I am looking very 
&gt; seriously at it 
&gt; as one means of bringing Internet access to a disadvantaged community 
&gt; and helping to break down the digital divide. I have been talking to 
&gt; Ross Chiswell and folks in the US over the last couple of years about 
&gt; delivery of Internet by wireless to the community and I still 
&gt; think it 
&gt; is achievable.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
