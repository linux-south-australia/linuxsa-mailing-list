&gt;&gt;This isn't hard to do, just a bit tedious
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1. Send your print job to the printer
&gt;&gt;2. Log in as root
&gt;&gt;3. Go to the shell
&gt;&gt;4. CD to /var/spool/cups if you use cups or
&gt;&gt;  '  '  /var/spool/lpd/lp
&gt;&gt;5. Copy the temporary file that shows up in the directory during the 
&gt;&gt;print job to your home directory.
&gt;&gt;6. Change the file owner from root to you
&gt;&gt;7. Rename tye file postscript.ps
&gt;&gt;8. Log out as root and log in as you
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;if you can "print to a file" in your app or just save as postscript
&gt;then you can skip all that above.
&gt;You could also do it all automatically with the right print filter
&gt;but don't ask me how precisely!
&gt;

* One important thing I forgot about the ps files, there are a series of 
 page numbering lines in a postscript file that tell Ghostview or 
Acrobat Reader how many pages are in the document and what page number 
you are at.

You need to determine how many pages of postscript you have combined, 
and number each page like so:

Page: 1 11

All this means is Page 1 of 11 Pages.


Page  2 11

etc.

You can search for -----&gt;    Page: with emacs.  


I should have mentioned that it is most useful when using Wine 
applications or non printable hard copies that need to be scanned, but 
the GIMP couldn't convert the scan to postscript.

I had to do all of that today because we had to deliver a set of 
documents to a client in PDF, that was originally made up of some 
documents that we could print to postscript, and some had to be scanned.

After I scanned the docs and converted them to ps, I had to manually 
combine  the ps files by using Emacs.  We have Adobe Acrobat 5, and it 
is able to PDF files. Unfortunately, the PDF file lost its formatting.
