My most recent ISP account has blown out and I am looking for alternatives. My 
current contract started a few years ago. It offered 250 hrs and 250MB per 
month for $32/month. All was good for a while. I upgraded to ISDN and was 
able to use the DOV facility that internode offered. So my current setup is 
two 56k channels, along with a permanent ip address which I paid separately 
for. This is local call access. I use one channel mostly, but on a big 
download can use both. These are using DOV (data over voice). 

However times have move on. There are cool things like apt-get available
and big increases in multimedia around. The ABC is using a lot more audio 
files. I just upgraded to KDE 3.0.4 and that was 50MB. So last month I went 
$50 over my limit. This will only get worse as more multimedia things come on 
line.

I would like to join Adam as they offer DOV but cannot get local call access. 
They do not seem to be interested in us. From what I understand, ADSL is not 
availabe here at the Angaston exchange yet. Then there would have to be an 
upgrade from ISDN to ADSL. Has anyone done this ?

Have others experienced similar problems ? In small business costs are 
important. A big phone bill and a big ISP bill is a killer.
