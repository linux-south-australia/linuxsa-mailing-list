Thanks to David for telling me to RTFM and go to freshmeat.net

Anyway - I think this sounds like a great idea.  I could throttle it at 7GB
or automatically get Squid or otherwise to 'censor' out certain MIME types
like realplayer or image files (unless from the cache).

Then if one does happen to go over the limit - they *may* end up with $20 in
excess on a really bad month - so one would theoretically never need to
concern themselves once it is running.

Would be *great* for a family too - with bandwidth hungry kiddies in the
house.

&gt; 
&gt; You could get really fancy and do your accounting with 
&gt; ipac-ng (or ipac) and
&gt; then setup a script that watches your total for the month and 
&gt; if it reaches
&gt; a certain limit (7Gb) it throttles you to a much slower 
&gt; connection.  you can
&gt; email your self daily reports as well and i think it has some 
&gt; graph output
&gt; though i gave up trying to get this to work.  it needed about 
&gt; 19 different
&gt; dependancies of which i couldn't find half.  &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; rant #1.  all software sites should have a collection of the 
&gt; dependancies
&gt; they need, not a link which will probably be broken after 
&gt; three days.  I've
&gt; come across about 2 peices of software that have the stuff i 
&gt; needed.  no
&gt; mucking around searching never.rpmfind.net  :)
&gt; 
&gt; rant #2.  linux rpm from the cl should have a flag or something that
&gt; automatically installs all the dependancies needed from the 
&gt; CDs. the front
&gt; end does, or used to but it was pretty cludgy.  i installed 
&gt; something and
&gt; literly went through about 14 or so thing needsing other 
&gt; things down to
&gt; about 3 or 4 levels deep.  this should be automatic.  or a 
&gt; flag to say just
&gt; do it.  having winged, is there a way you can do this?  :(

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How does IP accounting work?  I will look in to this - it 
&gt; could work just
&gt; perfectly for what I need - kill the link @ 7.5GB or 
&gt; something - until I
&gt; re-enable it manually as I need it for that month.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hmmm...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to
&gt; &gt; define what
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; download  is  reasonably well and not in small print.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but nobody reads the small print. Also, it might
&gt; &gt; make perfect sense
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to you, but that's no guarantee that Joe Blow will
&gt; &gt; understand it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And a guru will understand but not be able to monitor or to
&gt; &gt; some extent even
&gt; &gt; &gt; control their usage.
&gt; &gt; &gt; How could one monitor the download value of an hour's
&gt; &gt; websurfing?  I guess you
&gt; &gt; &gt; could empty your browser's cache before commencing to
&gt; &gt; browse and see what you
&gt; &gt; &gt; had collected after you had finished?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Well, if one was really a guru, one might make some ip accounting
&gt; &gt; rules to account for all traffice sent and received over the link,
&gt; &gt; inluding DNS and other overhead... far more accurate than 
&gt; the browser
&gt; &gt; cache...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, if you are sent html mail which auto-loads from
&gt; &gt; a website (Redhat
&gt; &gt; &gt; used to send me stuff like that) you have no control
&gt; &gt; whatsoever SFAICT.
&gt; &gt; &gt; There was a 'fiddle' which might persist, Tel$tra used to
&gt; &gt; charge for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; "backchannel" as well as the download - try monitoring and
&gt; &gt; controlling THAT!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; turn images off, or change mail clients. Yeah, suboptimal solutions,
&gt; &gt; but you _do_ have some control. If you want, simply block 
&gt; (using your
&gt; &gt; proxy or firewall) all access to the redhat website... :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think any rational person rejects download limits
&gt; &gt; out of hand.
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the user must IMHO be able to monitor and control
&gt; &gt; their usage so as
&gt; &gt; &gt; to stay within the cap.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I recall some ISP once giving a Windows start bar widget which would
&gt; &gt; do just that -- in fact, windows these days will tell you how much
&gt; &gt; data has been sent and received over each network connection, if you
&gt; &gt; click on properties or status or something. Linux will give you way
&gt; &gt; more info, but we know that :)
