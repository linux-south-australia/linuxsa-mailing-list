&gt;The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement when they 
&gt;mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before, it's unfortunate 
&gt;that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term for this.
&gt;
Not every ISP advertises 'downloads', some go out of their way to avoid 
the use of the word to avoid customer confusion. If the customer 
understands that when the lights flicker on their modem it's adding to 
their usage, then they probably won't have a problem.

The underlying problem is the amount of damage you can do to your bank 
account in a short amount of time with a broadband service;

Leave your tap on flat out for an hour, and it might use a megalitre. 
Costs you less than a dollar.

Leave your oven on for an hour, and it might use a kilowatt-hour. Costs 
you less than a dollar.

Call up Canada on a weekday evening and leave it off hook for an hour. 
Costs you less than $30.

Run your 512K ADSL connection flat out for an hour, and you're probably 
up for less than $40 in excess charges, if you had already used your 
plan's quota.

Everyone understands that an International call is going to cost when 
you spend a long time on the phone, but very few people seem to 
appreciate that using the Internet requires international 
infrastructure. In fact, it uses a whole lot more of it. Yet I don't see 
any outcry demanding unlimited phone calls to the USA for $25 per month.
