Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; great - and we all love to trash members of lesser species - but if we think
&gt; about it for a moment - I don't recall *one* person from David's BBQ that
&gt; was happy with the status quo.  Funny how on the list we are all superior to
&gt; all other consumers - but in person we are just like everyone else.

It's a very self-destructive attitude (where would we be without users?), but a 
very difficult one to avoid after you've spent the last few days repairing the 
damage caused by a user ignoring your "Don't switch this machine off" directive.

I imagine that all skilled tradespersons have something similar - car 
mechanics, plumbers, doctors, etc.

&gt; I was the only person there who is actually getting ADSL - I am the only
&gt; person that thinks the status quo sucks here - but not one person justifying
&gt; the status quo (who is subject to it - not the ones getting deals through
&gt; their employer or otherwise) is planning on getting ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why don't you all have
&gt; ADSL?

I do. 3 gig is more than enough for my housemate and I. Actually, we're 
thinking of taking it down to 1 gig. Then again, neither of us spend much time 
at home, and we don't game online.

We've actually got it fairly good here in Adelaide. $80 per month for a very 
fast link, decent uptime, and a fairly large bandwidth cap. Sounds like good 
value to me.

I wouldn't want to pay nearly that much if I wasn't employed full time, however.

(No, I don't work for Internode, but I used to work for an ISP)
