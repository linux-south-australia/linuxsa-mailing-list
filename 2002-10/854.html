ISPs are being screwed like the rest of us - it is not the issue.  I am
amazed Internode can offer any reasonable service at all under the current
regime - and credit to them!  That's why I signed up with them.

I just think - whichever way you look at it - it sucks.

I don't know if it is the Southern Cross Cable, the connecting nodes in the
USA or what - but something really needs to be done or the ISPs won't be too
happy either because few people can afford their services (and to no fault
of theirs I will add).

ISP's in Adelaide are doing a marvellous job on such small margins in my
opinion.  I just maintain that the current regime sucks - and that goes for
all of us - ISP's included.

&gt; &gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why 
&gt; don't you all
&gt; &gt; have ADSL?
&gt; 
&gt; I make no comment about download caps.  I made a comment 
&gt; about consumers
&gt; thinking that web viewing didn't contribute towards their usage.
&gt; 
&gt; As someone who has operated an ISP, and therefore has had to pay by
&gt; the byte, I see nothing wrong with also expecting consumers to pay by
&gt; the byte.  But consumers like the predictability of fixed bills, which
&gt; I can understand because I like that, too, hence it's become normal to
&gt; have fixed-price plans.  How does a sensible business protect themself
&gt; against financial ruin when they have to purchase by the byte 
&gt; but resell
&gt; at a fixed cost?  Obvious: cap the consumers' usage.
&gt; 
&gt; In point of fact, Telstra does not in any way cap consumers 
&gt; usage.  You
&gt; may download as much as you can grab.  What they do is offer 
&gt; bundled data
&gt; with your monthly access fee.  When you've used the bundled 
&gt; data you've
&gt; used it up, and any additional use is charged at the 
&gt; underlying rate for
&gt; the plan.  They offer different plans with different rates, and if you
&gt; think the amount of bundled data you're purchasing is not enough then
&gt; change to a plan that more suits your needs.
&gt; 
&gt; I know it sounds harsh, Ian, so let me put it this way: I'd 
&gt; like to put
&gt; one of my servers into your house, on your ADSL.  You 
&gt; probably pay $40 per
&gt; month for ADSL, so I'll give you $20 per month for all I can 
&gt; eat.  Okay?
