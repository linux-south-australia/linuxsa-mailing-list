&gt; but I seriously question why it is so expensive in Australia.

Again, I'm not convinced it is so expensive in Australia.  I don't
want to compare us with the cheapest country, because no doubt we
are not the cheapest, but I don't think we're expensive, either.
When I travel to Asia, which is often, I spend about the same at
internet cafes as I do when I travel around Australia, which is
also often.  Likewise when I recently lived in Asia I had internet
put on in my apartment and that cost, look I'll be honest and say
I don't remember the amount; it simply wasn't cheap or expensive
enough to be memorable.

I haven't surveyed the world, but I sense that we're towards the
cheaper end.  And yes,

&gt;  The distances involved would surely add to cost -

They certainly do.  More our distance from the rest of the world than
anything else.


&gt; where does the Southern Cross Cable and the nodes in the USA
&gt; that we connect to fit in to this?

My understanding is that Southern Cross has been a large factor in the
recent reduction in data prices in Australia.  There used to be excess
in the 25c to 30c range, now it's in the 10c - 20c range.  Prices have
come down.

USA is a difficult issue.  The internet really is centered on USA, and
the reason, I have recently been informed, is that back in the 80s, they
had already deregulated their telecommunication market, so you could
buy a pipe from there to here, and only the here end cost an arm and
a leg, and that was true no matter whether here was Asia, UK, Europe,
or Australia.  The US end gave you a choice of telcos, so competition
drove the price down at that end, but the local end was only available
through the government owned telco, and so the cost was unreasonable.
To buy a pipe from here to anywhere else cost twice as much as to USA.
So enough history, that's why USA gets to be the center of the internet.

Now, of course, they don't feel obliged to pay for "their" end of
the pipe.  Do you want to connect to the internet?  Sure, they'll sell
you access -- in America; you pay the cost of transporting the data to
where you want it.
