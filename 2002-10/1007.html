Mmm.  I hasten to point out that my endorsement of the *idea* is not an
endorsement of any particular implementation.

&gt; Under Outhouse, merely moving off an email to another in the preview

&gt; off an email that is currently highlighted (over which I have no control,

You're right, of course, it's not a read receipt; it's a display receipt.
Normally one would think that displaying is equivalent to reading, but
that's not necessarily so with automatic preview, even given the default
of five second before Outlook marks the message as read and presumably
then sends the read receipt.  Mind you, five seconds is an awfully long
time to not read the preview pane.

Of course sensibly paranoid users disable auto-previewing because of
the nasty javascript macros and such, that run just because of preview.
Problem solved.


&gt; As User Interface Metaphors go, Read Receipts are one of the crappiest.

On this I quite disagree.  It provides a positive notification that
the email has been displayed by the recipient.  As Richard mooted, we
do need some sort of iron-clad guarantee that a message has been read.
If not read receipts then what?  I'm keenly interested in the user
interface metaphor that you would develop.
