Legend!!!!  That's pretty much cleared it up for me!

&gt; Why is UDP less secure and how does UDP differ from &gt;TCP?
I know TCP is meant to be more reliable or
&gt; something?  Universal Datagram Protocol (?) is
&gt; very different?  Forgive my ignorance here if I am right
off - &gt; but I would like to know how UDP is less secure and
why &gt; UDP is used over other protocols at times..
&gt;
    From "TCP/IP Network Administration" by Craig Hunt
(O'Reilly & Assocs) -

    "The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) gives application
programs direct access to a datagram delivery service, like
the delivery service that IP provides. This allows
applications to exchange messages over the network with a
minimum of protocol overhead.

    UDP is an unreliable, connectionless datagram protocol.
As noted "unreliable" merely means that there are no
techniques in the protocol for verifying that the data
reached the other end of the network correctly."

    I think that answers your question about why UDP is
unreliable. Less secure? Maybe, but it would depend on the
application. As for why it is used instead of other
protocols, from The Book -

    "Why do programmers choose UDP as a data transport
service? There are a number of good reasons. If the amount
of data being transmitted is small, the overhead of creating
connections and ensuring reliable delivery may be greater
than the work of retransmitting the entire data set. In this
case UDP is the most efficient choice for a Transport Layer
protocol. Applications that fit a 'query-response' model are
also excellent candidates for using UDP. The response can be
used as a positive acknowledgement of the query. If the
response isn't received in a certain time period, the
application just sends another query. Still other
applications provide their own techniques for reliable data
delivery and don't require that service from the Transport
Layer protocol. Imposing another layer of acknowledgement on
any of these types of applications is inefficient."

    I am pretty sure that that should answer your questions.
I would highly recommend getting the book. It isn't cheap,
but it is one of the best books on the topic up to and
including some Textbooks on the subject. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
