&gt; Which descendent builds on ARM? Wince isn't a descendent of NT or even
&gt; close, but it is somewhat portable.

I believe the latest PocketPC has some heritage from desktop OSs.  But that's 
only from some web site somewhere.  Could be wrong.
 
&gt; I don't dispute that the 2K kernel is cross platform (hardware), but I do
&gt; dispute that this means it can necessarily be compiled on other than an M$
&gt; software platform. Maybe it is and they are keeping it secret, but the
&gt; first does not imply the second.

M$ toolchain can/could cross compile to mips & alpha?[1]

Why do you believe that it's impossible to compile up Win2K with something 
other than VisualXYZ?  It's all C and C++, right?  Even any M$ C++ extensions 
couldn't be too severe they couldn't be overcome with gcc and a perl script[1].

[1] Not that I have any idea.  I know little of M$ development.
