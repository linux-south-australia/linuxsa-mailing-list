I think you're going a bit over the top, they've investigated it
and offered to refund the money.  With the number of weird phone
numbers around now and the myriad of different prices etc I
wouldn't expect them to update their pabx software all the time

(they're a hotel not telecomms experts, I know large IT companies
where people can't dial CDMA mobiles from their desk phones cos
the twits in charge of the pabx haven't realised 0427, 0428, 0429
etc are mobile numbers and think it's interstate or something)

and another aside, it's often cheaper (if you don't make many calls)
to use a mobile rather than a fixed line phone, if I didn't need 
phone lines for internet access at home I'd probably just use a mobile.
Hotels are especially a rip off, at my last employer when travelling
we always used our mobiles rather than the hotel phones, even with
international roaming excess charges it was still often cheaper
(and I didn't mind cos it made me popular with my mobile phone co!).
