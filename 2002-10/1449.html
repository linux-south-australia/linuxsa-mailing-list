BTW, Speaking of CAD on Unix, anyone know of some decent CAD programs for
Linux?  I have found many but would like to hear from somone who has actually
used them.  

Used any of these?

LinuxCAD <A HREF="http://www.linuxcad.com/">http://www.linuxcad.com/</A> -commercial, claim to compete with AutoCAD
VariCAD -commercial

QCAD 
Varkon
FREEdraft
collabcad calloborative using Java and opencascade library
ARCAD

clayworks3d -looks like has potential

3D Acceleration has been around for as long as CAD and 3D modelling.
Games had nothing to do with development of hardware acceleration.
Think SGI developed OpenGL to play Quake?  Games were written to utilise
existing hardware acceleration technology then the popularity of this
has made 3D acceleration go mainsteam and not just in Unix CAD boxes.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; And remember, the gaming industry industry had a huge role on in 
&gt; &gt; pushing the envelope for desktop hardware. Game requirments drive 
&gt; &gt; hardware developers to create faster, more powerful everythings 
&gt; &gt; (CPU's, memory, GFX cards, networking equipment, etc, etc).

&gt; Games may have had *some* influence (e.g. in graphics, but what about 
&gt; the influence of photo editing on printers?), but what game requires 
&gt; gigabit ethernet?  Technology is following the curve of Moore's Law 
&gt; long before games were an influencing factor.

Games never really had much influence on the actual technology being 
developed.  Faster CPUs, larger capacity for memory and hard drives, 
networking equipment, etc would have been built regardless of the gaming

industry.  

However the home gaming industry did have a significant effect on the
home 
adoption of computers.  Having games was a real selling point for
computers 
in the home.  This created a larger consumer market for computers, and 
allowed more companies to make PC hardware, which in turn helped to
drive 
down the prices of the hardware to a level that could be more
affordable, 
etc.  Moore's law predicted the power of computer processing, but gaming

helped with the economics.

As for what game requires gigabit ethernet?  All of them (to get a real
low 
ping while streaming those MP3s at LAN parties :)  and probably QuakeIV.

Also I might postulate that perhaps on board 3D acceleration was given a
bit 
of a boost by gaming.
