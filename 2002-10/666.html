There's no all in one Linux distro I know of that does this all out the box.  Looks like you're going to learning a lot about Linux :)

Any Linux distro should do, but you're likely going to find more support with something like RedHat.  Its always a good start, and it does the job well.

With your "nat firewall", you'll likely be using a 2.4.xx kernel, so looking up and learning how iptables works would be a good start.

DNS & proxy - bind/named is an excellent DNS server, and there's plenty of stuff around on the net telling you how to configure it.  Squid's a great, widely supported http cache.  There's plenty of filter plugins available for it... squidguard (?) I think is one...  In any case, google's your friend.

Ssh & web server will be openssh and apache, which afaik come out the box with any recent Redhat distro.

For your VPN stuff, linux -&gt; linux is easy enough with frees/wan, but if you're looking at windows -&gt; linux, poptop might be a better option.  You can certainly get windows talking to linux with frees/wan, but there's a bunch of patches, and its not for the faint hearted :)  poptop just works.

Dialin server is done with ppp - you'll find millions of howto's for this on the net.

And finally, your fax stuff - hylafax is an awesome package to do this, and there's plenty of free windows clients to talk to it, to send/recieve faxes.  Not sure about getting it to send a PDF file, but I guess its possible if someone bothered to implement it.

Getting something installed, playing around with a few things yourself, then sending questions to this list might be the best thing to do.  For what you need, its not really the distrib thats important, because there's a fair bit of work.
