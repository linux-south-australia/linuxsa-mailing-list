&gt; &gt; internal IP, using NAT
&gt; &gt; connected to LAN at work, to LAN at home
&gt;
&gt;if you are on your work LAN, i'd say you are well and truly behind a
&gt;firewall.  Firwalling / NAT rules you can do anything, including blocking
&gt;everything except pinging (ICMP protocol) to force you to use a work proxy
&gt;and thus properly log your access.  I'd talk to your system administrators
&gt;and ask for a proxy server, your mail server, dns server you should be using
&gt;(sometimes a private on might be setup)

Michael and Geoffrey set the network card to use dhcp. It works OK. It 
gives me all the settings. I could not ping google if the dns server did 
not give me its address, could I?


&gt;Home?  i've got no idea, have you setup a firewall/nat router thingy or
&gt;what?    two different kettles of fish.  if you have NAT at home, can you
&gt;try it out with another machine? (the one you are sending mail with) to
&gt;understand what is going wrong?  i take it you are slightly conversant with
&gt;TCP-IP basics?

At home I am running firewall / NAT. I can boot the same PC in Windows 2000 
and can browse  the Internet both at home and at work. In Windows if I have 
a networking problem I run the network monitor and can usually figure out 
what is the problem. With linux the problem is I do not know where to 
start, get the info, the commands and so on.


&gt;in any case, talk to your network admin and ask for some help.

I can not talking to my network admin about problems with Linux in a place 
running only Windows.



&gt;err, a thought just occured to me.  could you only ping google from the
&gt;BBQ/meeting and you can't now at home/work?

I can ping google from home/work, now. At the BBQ/meeting I struggled to 
install linux. I have not tried any networking. I had there my own hub 
connected only to my PC.
