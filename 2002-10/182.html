Maybe we don't need a prize except the right to choose the project of their
choice - say pretty visualisations for XMMS - ha ha

Or even a nice bottle of red - that's only $20 at most..

I think a raffle is an excellent idea.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest that I run a raffle at the next LinuxSA meeting.
&gt; 
&gt; Tickets are $2 each or two for $3 with two prizes:
&gt; 
&gt;  - First Prize: 30% of the takings, up to $300
&gt;  - Second Prize: 10% of the takings, up to $199
&gt; 
&gt; I don't *think* we'd raise more than $1500 however if I were to give
&gt; away a prize more than $500 I'd have to register as a lottery.
&gt; 
&gt; Now given that we have about 30 people at each meeting, let's say that
&gt; 70% buy a single ticket and 30% buy two tickets:
&gt; 
&gt; 21 x 2 = 42
&gt;  9 x 3 = 18
&gt;          --
&gt;          60
&gt; 
&gt; Making the first prize worth $18 and the second prize $6. This would
&gt; leave $36 as a donation. Continue this for twelve months and we would
&gt; have raised $432...
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest that we develop a list of appropriate people or 
&gt; organisations
&gt; to donate to and that as part of the winner's takings the 
&gt; winner gets to
&gt; choose which one gets the rest of the pot.
