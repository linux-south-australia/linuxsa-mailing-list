O.K.
    I hadn't thought of old distro's
I'd be willing to be a Northern distributor, only I don't yet have 
Bandwidth. But, I could pick up a copy from one of those with bandwidth.
I do, I'll have to confirm this, have access to a subdomain for the page 
and I have the time and ability to  do the page if we get this far. On 
an Aussie server, free. 
I do have a collection of cd's, I'm a bit of a hoarder, going back I 
think to RedHat 4.3 and whatever debian and slackware were at the time. 
Mainly focussed on Redhat and Mandrake.

Like DSL I would be interested in enough to cover the disks, I would 
need to set up transfer facillities ie I don't have a network yet. I do 
now have an old box I'm about to set up.

&gt;I have decided that we should setup a number of "access points" for "big
&gt;downloads" all over Adelaide. These access points would be real people
&gt;who just happen to want to donate a little bit of time helping others. I
&gt;am going to see if anyone will sponsor a web-page for me so that it's
&gt;easy to:
&gt;
&gt;a) advertise what you have if you are an access point
&gt;b) put down prices and rules and such
&gt;
&gt;This is sort of like "Napster" but we're shunting data by ethernet or by
&gt;CD's.
