&gt;Thanks your thoughts.  Always interesting to hear whether
&gt;my ideas are shocking or not! :-)

Had a quick read and at least David's questions kept on topic and were all
relevant to Linux :)

I have applied for a couple of jobs that required a badly disguised IQ test
before I made it to round three.   Just for a laugh I did one for the
"experience".   I was actually tested for grammar and spelling in the first
section, problem solving and  mathematical skills in the second section
followed by pattern matching and eye for detail in the third and final
section.   Some of this had relevance in a Design Engineer position but was
clearly used to separate those that were "rocket" scientists (commonly
known as parakeets) from those that were "practical" or not gifted with a
dictionary/calculator/imaging software brain.   Needless to say I didn't
take up the offer when it arrived, but that was for an entirely different
reason.

Just to add a bit more fuel to the debate....   I have seen very clever
people fall to pieces with the pressure of an exam.   They know their stuff
but for some reason under the pressure of an exam they loose the plot and
wham C.R.A.F.T.   If you cater to those individuals with either verbal
exams or "bring in" practical examples or their work, then testing ones
"abilities" in a job interview in this manner is IMHO ok.

When interviewing for Technicians or Junior Engineering positions I am
always pleased to see practical projects or examples of their work that
they have done at home.   I usually include something to this effect on the
preliminary interview letter.   Out of the last 4 positions we have filled
the successful candidates all have brought excellent examples of their work
(note: MP3 players have been done to death !) and demonstrated the
necessary practical skills with simple PCB/CAD problems given in the
interview.
