If you drop the packets the IRC server will sit at the other end until
it's TCP connection times out.  With TCP it expects a reply if it can't
connect to an IP/port.  if you reject with tcp-reset the server gets its
reply immediately and carries on.

As far as you're concerned DROP and REJECT are the same thing; packets
never make it past (or even into) your firewall.  The exception is that
port 113 looks like it exists, rather than your machine just not
replying (looking like it is not there).

One thing I was going to ask the list:  is it possible to set iptables
to only reject a packet if there is an OUTGOING connection from my
machine to the machine the packet originates from?  Otherwise I want to
drop the packet.  It's a little more stateful and to random scanners it
looks like ident isn't there.  To things like IRC (and some web) servers
it just appears closed so that they don't take forever to respond.

Cheers,
Adam
