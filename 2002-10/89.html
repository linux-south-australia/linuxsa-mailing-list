<H1>Thoughts on mandrake 9</H1>

<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I installed mandrake 9 over my old mandrake 8.1 system at home last
night, and heres the notes I took as I tweaked it up to get it how I
like it :

* esd seems to have gone, and used OSS for sound by default! yay! (esd
had caused me no end of grief in the past). OSS just seems to work.

* the gnome 2 the panel defaulted to the top of the screen. This just
irked me for some reason, and I still havn't figured how to shift it to
the bottom. All the help says "you can move panels like this... except
the main one" or words to that effect. I also couldn't find a setting in
~/.gnome* anywhere for it. By the end of the night I was getting used to
it though, and Im sure with a bit of research it'll be possible.

* My scanner (acer prisa 310s scsi) did not work out of the box and I
had to manually select it. The OS saw it (Flatbed_scanner_4 unknown)
which is the string the scanner reports proving the connection was OK. I
manually added it in sane, and it looked ok, then didnt show up after I
closed the config window. This scanner has never worked under linux
though anyway. So thats still a forward step.

* My USB dlink webcam did "just work" out of the box, although in black
and white. Im pretty  sure it would do colour with a bit of tweaking.

* My fave XMMS skin "ultrafina" was installed out of the box ;)

* It had Eterm in its default install! 

* Quite fast.

* Nice installer

* Installed iceWM (I think) by default rather than sawfish although I
thought I selected saw fish[1]. With this default config the pager is
annoying as it doesnt support edge flipping! When I get sawfish back on
there and get it to do the paging/edge flipping then this should be OK.
