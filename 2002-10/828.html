Ian,

&gt; "We have had a number of complaints about bills for excess usage, which
&gt; appear to arise as a result of misunderstandings about what is included in
&gt; usage and what isn't," she said. 

I don't think that users who are plain stupid and don't read or understand 
their sign-on contracts should be awarded a thing. If the ombudsman finds that 
an ISP/Telecommunications provider has been wilfully misleading then I would 
support that case.

But I don't particularly want to find myself in a society where my stupidity is 
someone else's responsibility.

&gt; "For example, many consumers think usage only includes files or programs
&gt; that they download over the internet. They don't realise that just opening a
&gt; web page will contribute to their usage." 

To cover all the details I'm sure you'd need a booklet as large as the Bible or 
the Qu'Ran itself; I'd suggest such a booklet would be just as obscure and 
difficult to interpret. Just because consumers don't read contracts which are 
written in plain English and, if they are written in jargon then the consumer 
doesn't consult the ISP for clarification, doesn't excuse them for their 
stupidity.

Having seen a number of these contracts they can be confusing, but why would a 
consumer sign a contract they find confusing? I don't, but I don't consider 
myself stupid either.

&gt; The TIO advised new broadband users to check their usage continually. 
&gt; 
&gt; "My theory is that the business model will have evolved, and it may be that
&gt; you pay differently for different types of content." 

:-)
