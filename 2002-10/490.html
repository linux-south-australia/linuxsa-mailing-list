1) Actually, Business Internode ADSL customers on Internet routable 
IP addresses that we allocated as IP's intrinsic to the service (1 or 
5 fixed IP's) do have un-metered access today.

So to clarify what Alex is referring to here - he is referring to the 
routing of *additional* IP ranges that the customer has requested on 
top of the 'built in' static IP's that we route with the service.

I wanted to point this out in case anyone thought that Alex was 
implying that un-metering didn't work on BADSL at all - when in fact 
it does, with this specific limitation (which is explained in the web 
pages that explain the un-metering facilities offered in Internode 
xDSL).

2) Yes, we'll be offering another access method for BADSL customers 
in the future which will avoid this 'edge condition' entirely, Alex.

Probably a few months away as yet, though, because we're completing 
some other necessary engineering work first, in order to make this 
possible.

Its taken until just a week ago for Telstra to finish offering us 
enough of their promised improvements in their xDSL network to let us 
move in this direction properly at last.

Its a long story. Suffice it so say that this wasn't an intended 
situation, but its currently unavoidable until we do re-engineer the 
BADSL access method, and meantime you can access those resources via 
the 'built in' IP's we routed to you underneath your tunnel if you 
want to - and I'm sure that Netcraft are more than technically 
capable of figuring out a way to do that, at the same time as using 
the additional ranges that you have requested that we route for you.

NB this is a separate, but related, project to the re-engineering I 
was referring to for direct ethernet-attached 'iPoP' customers in 
Agile-fibre-access buildings, in order to offer them the same 
outcomes in the future.

Regards,

   Simon (who is going overseas tomorrow, so this may be the end of my 
involvement in this thread for a while :) )

&gt;&gt;  You do get the nifty high speed access to those servers, but it -is-
&gt;&gt;  metered -unless- you are on ADSL or SDSL at this time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  There is some significant re-engineering needed to do the traffic
&gt;&gt;  'subtraction' needed, on non-ADSL connections...
&gt;
&gt;Could this 're-engineering' also make it possible for business ADSL
&gt;customers sitting on Internet routable IP address ranges to access the
&gt;mirrors 'sans metering'?
&gt;
