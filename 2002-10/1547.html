&gt; Being trivial to forge, you could easily set the following events
&gt; in motion.  Let's say Mike's just set up NTP on his mail host.

For, um, example.

&gt; Let's ignore the fact that he's just published his ntp.conf, but
&gt; we know he's running ntp.

Well, I'd say it was more, err, "representative" of an ntp.conf which I 
may, or may not be using, as the case may (or may not) be.

&gt; It's easy enough to determine the IP
&gt; address of his mail host, and there's only a small number of NTP
&gt; servers in Australia that he can query anonymously off the net.

Good point. I not sure I like the way this conversation is heading, 
however..

&gt; He can't firewall effectively, because he *must* be able to
&gt; communicate with the 'net accessible server.  If we inject packets
&gt; into the network[1] with the destination set to his NTP client
&gt; (/server), the source set to the publicly accessable NTP server,
&gt; and some mischief data that when read by Mike's NTP client causes
&gt; it to explode, then it's game over.

Of course, doing so would be a nasty, malicious act, and I'm sure no-one 
would try it.. heh heh.. err, right? Guys?

:)

&gt; [1]  Presuming that we can - some networks drop such martian packets.

That is an interesting point. I assume you're not talking about your 
typical anti-spoofing rules here. How do you detect that someone has 
injected bogus packets somewhere betweeen point A and point B, bound for 
yuor network? Especally when the source of said bogosity is at the 
otherwise unrelated point C, somewhere in between A and B, so A's and 
B's anti-spoofing rules offer no protection?
