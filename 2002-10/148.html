&gt; Me: So, you're running Windows then? (They just don't get the funny

&gt; 
&gt; Telstra op: [confusion/frustration] Yes, why?

I open my email client on site this morning (Exchange/Outhouse), and
there's a message from a team member.  I click on it.  Blue screens.
"Nuts!"  I think, since it takes me nearly ten minutes to boot and
open all the applications I need to use.  Do the reboot dance, make
coffee, Outlook is finally open again, click on the same message,
*boom*.  Hmmmm.  I'm vaguely aware there's a virus about, but as I'm
playing with Unix boxen all day I don't really pay too much attention
(that is, unti it affects me).  Call the help desk guys, they dispatch
someone around, who then removes a bloody *FONT* from my workstation,
which resolves the problem.  I still can't get over it:  A font blue
screens my machine, that I didn't install (intentionally or otherwise),
that the sender didn't specify in his email when creating it, that has
lain dormant until now.

I have been told that part of the problem with NT was that the
workstation that I use wasn't powerful enough.  "I didn't realise
that the Pentium III wasn't Turing-Complete", which left them
scratching their heads.

This is on top of the upgrade of the Exchange server at Iocane, which
has gone and reformatted all of my existing stored plain text emails
into HTML.

Some days it still isn't worth chewing through the straps ...
