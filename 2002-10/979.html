ah ok.

&gt;Michael and Geoffrey set the network card to use dhcp. It works OK. It
&gt;gives me all the settings. I could not ping google if the dns server did
&gt;not give me its address, could I?

Close but not quite.

DNS = Domain Name Server (or Service)  this, put simply, is a 'lookup'
server looking up names (www.google.com) to numbers (144.142.65.213) and
vice versa.

DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.  A server that reponds to client
requests by dishing numbers out of a database.  can also give you settings
as well.

&gt;At home I am running firewall / NAT. I can boot the same PC in Windows 2000
&gt;and can browse  the Internet both at home and at work. In Windows if I have
&gt;a networking problem I run the network monitor and can usually figure out
&gt;what is the problem. With linux the problem is I do not know where to
&gt;start, get the info, the commands and so on.

Now it's becoming much clearer.  perhaps either ipchains or iptables is
running on linux.  a local firewall if you will.  try doing the following to
turn off both:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipchains stop
/etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables stop

then try surfing etc.  the default depends on how what you chose when you
installed linux as the 'security configuration' or firewall setup or
something.

BUT! with no firewall open to attack should be on the clean internet.  at
home you have a firewall already, at work you could probably assume for a
bit that you are behind some kind of firewall as well as nobody in their
right mind runs a network without one.

chkconfig --list

shows your list of services.

chkconfig --level 3 iptables off

will set iptables to not start.  what is level?  read up on runlevels.  3 is
networked and most often used.

&gt;I can not talking to my network admin about problems with Linux in a place
&gt;running only Windows.

hopefully one day it'll be the reverse.  ring the help desk about winblows
and they say 'what's that?'

HTH

Regards
Matt
