Hi, I was directed here by one of your memebers for help, I was 
wondering if you'd be able to help me with the following problem.

I have a server which I have set up a rewrite rule in httpd for the 
wildcard domain *.domain.com set up in bind, the rewrite rule directs 
users coming in through user1.domain.com to /var/sites/user1, (this 
works for any prefix due to the rewrite rule) the thing I was wondering 
about is cross server distribution, if I ran out of space on server 
one, would I be able to have a second server that would be able to pick 
up a domain not found on the other, i.e.

usr1.domain.com   =&gt; server1 :: /var/sites/usr1
usr2.domain.com   =&gt; server1 :: /var/sites/usr2
usr3.domain.com   =&gt; server2 :: /var/sites/usr3

My friend has suggested using NFS, but through this means, all traffic 
would go through my server and to the other and then back again to 
display, doubleing the amount of traffic used; and on top of this I am 
not sure that NFS would be compatable with the rewrite rules. Is there 
any way which would connect them directly to the other server without 
redirecting the url or using frames. Does anyone have any idea how I 
would be able to set something up (note: no I cannot add a hard drive 
since I am using a Sun Cobalt Raq4i and do not have the space for one) 
to achieve the followin.

James Austin
