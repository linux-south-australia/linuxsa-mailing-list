Have just subscribed,
have just been reading the email archives, and I read

"The other thing I liked with the install was printer setup.  Basically
the same as 8.2, you get an option to browse for network printers,
upon doing so I was presented with a list of all the network printers
on our LAN, right down to the model (apart from one Epson,"


I have just installed mandrake 9, and it looks great, apart from printer 
setup. I am using an old Epson LQ 500, dot matrix, which it won't find either 
as a Windows printer, or stand alone. I have used printtool to set it up, and 
it appears to be OK, until I try and print. First half of the page of a KWord 
document prints OK, then it starts to misplace parts of letters and puts them 
under the next letter, further down the page it starts to print the same line 
twice. The test pages are to be avoided, as I have had dozens of pages 
streaming from the printer (continuous feed) that I have been unable to stop.
Shutting down doesn't help, as soon as the machine has rebooted and the 
printer is put online its off again. Only solution is to remove the printer 
from list, and reboot. Have used the LQ driver as is , the ghostscript 
driver(recommended), even the 24 pin driver. Ghostscript gives the best 
result.
Any ideas as to what I am doing wrong?? Or does mandrake 9 just not like Epson 
dot matrix printers?

One more question, anyone know of any drivers for Pentax optio range of 
digital cameras, pentax doesn't seem to want to answer me :-)

Anyone living North of Adelaide (Hamley Bridge) I have a 2 cd set from 
magazine I can copy for them.

Thanks take care
Winton
