Linux wins hand against Microsoft
Michael Sainsbury
October 31, 2002


LISTED online casino Lasseters is the latest company dumping its Microsoft
systems and replacing them with the so-called open source platform, Linux.

The move is part of a broader technology overhaul that has seen the company
install fresh storage gear from market leader EMC and look towards the
second phase of its disaster recovery plan. 

Lasseters chief information officer Mark Robertson said that the move to
Linux had been driven by the high cost of Microsoft's latest licensing
scheme. 

Linux is an open source computer platform growing in popularity through its
adoption by leading computer hardware makers IBM, HP and Sun Microsystems. 

This means the code is available free to everyone, unlike Microsoft's code,
which it keeps closely guarded, enabling it to charge high prices for its
operating systems.

Mr Robertson has echoed countless other businesses in Australia - and around
the world - in his frustration with Microsoft's latest grab for the
corporate wallet. 

"We're consolidating, getting rid of a lot of Microsoft and putting in more
installations of Linux," Mr Robertson said. 

"We're trying to increase our reliability and flexibility and have been
talking to IBM and Compaq." 

He said that Microsoft's method of charging a separate licence fee for each
computer processing unit had implications on his organisation's ability to
be flexible in the number of computer servers it used for Lasseters online. 

The Alice Springs web-based company is part of the ASX-listed Lasseters
group. 

It was the first regulated online gambling company in the world and has had
to battle for survival following the federal Government's ban on internet
gambling in July 2001. 

Under the deal with the Northern Territory Government, all Lasseters'
gambling transactions and financial transactions must occur in the
territory. 

Still, while companies like Lasseters are anathema to the present federal
Government, online gambling operators are allowed in the Northern Territory,
Tasmania and Queensland. 

Lasseters has not been shy about overhauling its technology. The company has
also swapped out its Sun Microsystems data storage systems for those from
storage market leader EMC. 

But this could only happen after Lasseters educated the Government. Mr
Robertson, who runs IT for the whole group, said: "They didn't understand
you could have more than one company's data on the same box. They didn't
realise what the technology could do." 

Still, in the heat of the Alice Springs desert, Mr Robertson said: "The main
issue is making sure it's all cool enough. Every now and then we have a
flood, but the casino's never been flooded." 

There was a one in a 100-year chance of Lasseters going under water, he
said. 

To prepare for this remote possibility, Lasseters is evaluating the second
part of a disaster recovery plan. This may involve having a redundant data
storage facility in Telstra's Alice Springs exchange.
