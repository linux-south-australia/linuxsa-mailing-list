This is not a trivial problem, a linux operating system running a central
controller would constitute only 20% of the battle.   Your valves,
controllers, comms and plumbing are the most important part, also the
hardest to get running.

Not to put a negative spin on your project here are some of the challanges
that will cause you headaches with your ideal system;

- Water ingress into valve/cable connections (causes comms problems)
- Communications down water pipe unfeasible as majority of pipe is PVC,
water is a poor conductor (1.5k - 1Meg ohms/m)
- Cable must be "underground" rated, ie Gell Filled
- The more conductors the higher the cost of the cable per meter
- Valves require power to operate, you must signal down the same wires that
supply power (Can be done but not cheap !!!)
- Galvanic corrosion of valves/wire caused by DC imbalance (note this is a
big problem)
- Distance vs Voltage Drop vs Comms, the longer the wire the less power
available the harder it is to communicate
- Lightning !  If it hits the ground anywhere near your system put your
head between your knees and kiss your  ...... goodbye !

Here is a couple of links to commercial systems that will show you how some
of the technical challanges have been addressed.

In a previous life I was responsible for the installation of Toro based
Irrigation systems like you described on two Golf Courses here in Adelaide.
Each project was the better part of 6 months from woe to go, cost around
300-400k and were a  real technical PITA (!!!)

Some suggestions for a home irrigation system would be to take a trip down
to the local electronics stores and look for the parallel driven relay
output boards.   I am sure these allow you do daisy chain each board where
each relay output is addressable.   It may have been a silicon chip kit.
They also have inputs from memory.   Buy a hefty 24VAC transformer and use
this to power your valves through the relay switches, Bunnings have a good
series of 24VAC 8VA valves for around $25.   My Parents place still has a
trusty 286-16MHz machine in the shed running their watering system.   I
have been meaning to replace it but the ol' girl just wont kick the bucket
:)
