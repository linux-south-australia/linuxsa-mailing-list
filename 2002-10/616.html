This goes against all logic Spock

"Typically", spinning up and down the hard drive increases the failure rate.

Is this true?  So maybe leaving my Linux box always running is a good idea?

Someone once told me that parts have a certain lifespan and leaving them
running brings d-day closer each day it is left running.  I question the
validity of this rumour.

&gt; &gt; All this talk of dying hard drives worries me.
&gt; 
&gt; From alt.sysadmin.recovery:
&gt; 
&gt; Today, we are mourning the loss of /dev/ad43c.  He was a kind, gentle
&gt; disk, early in his years, with much free space ahead of him.  
&gt; He passed
&gt; away today, Friday, January 27th at 9:05am Pacific time.  It was a an
&gt; unexpected death, with no signs of illness or a history of complaints;
&gt; he simply went into spams, and started to slip away.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite our best efforts to save /dev/ad43c, despite two hours spent
&gt; trying desperately to bring him back from the brink, he simply lost
&gt; the battle, and passed on into oblivion.
&gt; 
&gt; I will miss /dev/ad43c.  He served us well, and was dedicated 
&gt; to living
&gt; the best life that he could.  He will live on in our hopes and in our
&gt; dreams, and in our hearts.  Though he can never truly be replaced, his
&gt; essence-- his soul-- shall be with us, always.
&gt; 
&gt; Good-bye, /dev/ad43c, and farewell.
&gt; 
&gt; *sniff*
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have some old drives still
&gt; &gt; in use at home - and I wonder if hard drives just suddenly 
&gt; die after a few
&gt; &gt; years which seems strange or if that is really only for servers in
&gt; constant
&gt; &gt; use.
&gt; 
&gt; Typically, drives don't die suddenly.  If you have any 
&gt; automated monitoring
&gt; of your syslog files, you'll quite often see a build up of 
&gt; errors before you
&gt; lose a drive completely (note to pedants that I said 
&gt; "typically": I have
&gt; also
&gt; seen cases of drives failing completely without warning).  
&gt; Note that vendors
&gt; like HP have finally gotten around to automating this 
&gt; process, so quite
&gt; often you're warned of failure before it happens.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  I often don't turn my desktop machine off - although I wonder if my
&gt; &gt; Linux box spins down the HD?
&gt; 
&gt; "Typically", spinning up and down the hard drive increases 
&gt; the failure rate.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Doesn't the Linux kernel do a sync every few minutes which 
&gt; makes it hard
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; spin down hard drives?
&gt; 
&gt; Every thirty seconds, and only if there is data to be flushed to disk.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know of people who have hard drives in their home 
&gt; machines running for
&gt; &gt; years with no problem - so I wonder how concerned we should 
&gt; be over data
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; old(er) drives.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 2 gig IBM SCSI drive in my firewall that would be 
&gt; pushing 7 years
&gt; continuous use now.  Put that in your MTBF pipe and smoke it!
&gt;
