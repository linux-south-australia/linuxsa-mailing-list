&gt;&gt; great - and we all love to trash members of lesser species - but if we 
&gt;&gt; think
&gt;&gt; about it for a moment - I don't recall *one* person from David's BBQ that
&gt;&gt; was happy with the status quo.  Funny how on the list we are all 
&gt;&gt; superior to
&gt;&gt; all other consumers - but in person we are just like everyone else.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was the only person there who is actually getting ADSL - I am the only
&gt;&gt; person that thinks the status quo sucks here - but not one person 
&gt;&gt; justifying
&gt;&gt; the status quo (who is subject to it - not the ones getting deals through
&gt;&gt; their employer or otherwise) is planning on getting ADSL.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why don't you all 
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; ADSL?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ian,
&gt;     I don't get the impression that anyone is defending the caps, they 
&gt; are simply saying "caveat emptor". They feel the deal is not good enough 
&gt; - so they don't puchase it, they feel the same as you do about the caps 
&gt; - the difference being that you are still using the service that you are 
&gt; dissatisfied with.
&gt; 
&gt; IMO, anyone who has the necessary information easily available to them 
&gt; is quite welcome to compain about the situation, but they are not 
&gt; welcome to claim they were hoodwinked. If they agree to something they 
&gt; don't understand, then that is their own problem, (provided the 
&gt; information hasn't been disguised / hidden / etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; The only people who have been treated unfairly in this situation are 
&gt; people who bought unlimited access and subsequently had that downgraded. 
&gt; And even in this situation, if they were released from their contract at 
&gt; this point then then ok (I am not sure if this is the case with the 
&gt; telstra deal though)
&gt; 
&gt; Barney
&gt; 
I'm one of those Tel$tra customers that signed up as _soon_ as I could
get ADSL. Yes I was annoyed at the subsequent cap, and I joined the
Whirlpool lobby to voice my opinion. Not that I have ever come close to
the cap (well, once I DL'd all four FreeBsd iso's) but the principal
of signing a binding 18 month contract and then having the conditions
changed got my back up. It passed scrutiny by the TIO and the ACCC by
the fact that Tel$tra would release without penalty those who wanted
out. I thought those two bodies rolled over. I stayed because I got ADSL
for _speed_, cable had not rolled out (despite the hype from the Foxtel
goons) and Internode was not up and running yet.

Now, if you can't work out that browsing, sending and receiving emails,
and in particular, leaving a window open to a site that forces refresh,
adds to your traffic _and_ you don't bother to access your usage meter
then all I can say is that you can't legislate against stupidity.

Luke
