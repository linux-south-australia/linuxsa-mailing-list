&gt; While I think that the concept of testing candidates is good, I am not 
&gt; sure that a written test like that would be of much use.

It was, I grant you, a difficult exam, however it did test for the
skills I most wanted.  It was also an open book exam, and I provided
a full set of Unix and SQL manuals.  (I discovered afterwards that the
manuals included all of the answer to the TCP sections!)

&gt; In addition, I would criticize a question that asks what the following 
&gt; does:
&gt;
&gt;     false && true && echo 1 || true && false && \
&gt;         echo 2 || false || true || echo 3 && echo 4 && echo 5

It's only one question, that gives an opportunity for the real geeks to
show their depth of knowledge!  It's one of those "you either know it
or you don't" type questions, and I think, particularly in view of the
example that you gave, that it's an idiom that is commonly used.  But,
remember, it is only one questions.

Thanks your thoughts.  Always interesting to hear whether my ideas are
shocking or not! :-)
