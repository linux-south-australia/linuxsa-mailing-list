I think the best option like you said is to run identd on the gateway if it
makes no difference and set 'allow' to port 113 - which should 'allow' that
port in to the gateway?

&gt; &gt; I think I need to run another identd service on the client 
&gt; machine behind
&gt; &gt; the gateway and forward port 113 packets?
&gt; 
&gt; Not all irc servers require an ident server. There are a couple of
&gt; options. Simplest is to run an ident server on the firewall. 
&gt; Since your
&gt; masqueraded anyway, as far as the irc server is concerned the reply is
&gt; coming from you. 
&gt; 
&gt; Else you could do as you say and redirect port 113 through your
&gt; firewall. Thats not too nice though, since then you are letting a port
&gt; in to your internal machine. There is also some kind of fake ident
&gt; server project ive seen on sourceforge. This one answers 
&gt; ident requests,
&gt; but only dishes out fake information. This is good if you just need to
&gt; get around the ident server requirement, but wish to disclose 
&gt; as little
&gt; info as possible. Unfortunatly I think ive seen a security 
&gt; vulnerability
&gt; even with this one though! It would be fixed now though.
