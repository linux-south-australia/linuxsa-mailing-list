Hi Brian,
    I think, and I'm sure that others would agree, that the reason the 
words "Open Source Distribution Service" were used, was to ensure that 
all distro's were encompassed. The reason for the redhat, mandrake 
flavour of the thread being simply because the discussion started from 
those trying to obtain mandrake 9.0.
    Actually being organised may ensure that more distro's are 
available, ie requests could be forwarded to those with bandwidth and 
cd's circulated to the various distro points.

&gt;My question - Is this a Red Hat Open Source Distribution Service ?
&gt;or are others allowed.

&gt;&gt;Hi There,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It appears that there is enough interest to create an "Open Source
&gt;&gt;Distribution Service" and I would like to invite the people who wanted
&gt;&gt;to become part of the distribution network to my place for a `pot luck'
&gt;&gt;BBQ at my place.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anybody else is welcome to come along as well, however I would
&gt;&gt;appreciate it if people RSVP'ed me just in case my rather ample backyard
&gt;&gt;is too small to host the flocks coming :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Date:  Saturday, 12 October 2002
&gt;&gt; Time:  12 Noon - Late
&gt;&gt; RSVP:  <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>
&gt;&gt; Bring: Beer, soft drinks, meat, salad
&gt;&gt; Phone: 0402 440993
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you need transport please contact me and I'll do my best to arrange
&gt;&gt;car-pooling. I'm close to two "Go Zone" bus routes so public transport
&gt;&gt;won't be a problem either. If the weather is horrible then I have a
&gt;&gt;garage and a house so I think I'll  have enough undercover space to go
&gt;&gt;ahead.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The meeting will be informal but I will probably gather everybody at
&gt;&gt;about 1:30 PM and just have a general discussion of the logistics of
&gt;&gt;what we want to achieve and the aim of what we want to achieve.  Either
&gt;&gt;I, or someone else, will take a summary of the ideas and I'll present
&gt;&gt;them to the LinuxSA list and we can get this service underway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I look forward to meeting more of you in person.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
