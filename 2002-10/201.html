too right - I could help with documentation for the less technically
inclined on how to compile source files or something..

&gt; &gt; I am willing to put down say $10 at the next meeting - I 
&gt; suggest we all do

&gt; 
&gt; I'll often order a CD online from places that claim to put part of the
&gt; proceeds back into the community. It's cheaper than 
&gt; downloading ISOs from the
&gt; 'net.
&gt; 
&gt; Money isn't necessarily the best thing to give back to the Open Source
&gt; community, though. Ideally, we'd all be able to put back 
&gt; plenty of useful
&gt; code into our favourite projects, but that's rarely possible. 
&gt; Luckily for us,
&gt; coding isn't the only useful part of most Open Source 
&gt; projects that can do
&gt; with volunteers. Testing and Documentation are a fantastic 
&gt; way to put back
&gt; into the community.
&gt; 
&gt; Past employers (and indeed, my current one) have always 
&gt; gained a great deal
&gt; from Open Source software (in license fee savings, features, stabilty,
&gt; security, control and much more), so they quite often don't 
&gt; mind me spending
&gt; a little time here and there touching up a man page or 
&gt; submitting a patch to
&gt; fix a minor problem or testing the latest CVS copy of a particular
&gt; application. If each of us picked our favourite project and 
&gt; spent a few hours
&gt; of our own or our employers' time (with permission from the employer,
&gt; obviously) fixing parts of applications that have less polish than is
&gt; necessary. Documentation. Testing. Hell, even creating a 
&gt; bunch of pretty
&gt; little icons to be used with something like dia....
&gt; 
&gt; Donations of old hardware or licenses for unused operating systems to
&gt; particular software projects can help too (particularly some 
&gt; of the less
&gt; common stuff). Projects like samba (<A HREF="http://www.samba.org">http://www.samba.org</A>) 
&gt; tend to thoroughly
&gt; test their code on all sorts of strange platforms. It would 
&gt; be nice if others
&gt; did/could. Wasn't the Linux/Alpha port first done on a donated Alpha?
&gt; 
&gt; OK, so most of us don't have any old Alphas lying around that 
&gt; we can (or want
&gt; to) just give away, but you can see my point.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This could be a halfway point for those of us that still 
&gt; want to contribute
&gt; &gt; something.
&gt; 
&gt; Why only do half the job? :-). Get rid of all of your guilt 
&gt; at once. I think
&gt; contributions are more valuable than cash donations in a lot of cases.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; LinuxSA has no membership fee - we get free use of Compaq 
&gt; facilities, etc -
&gt; &gt; I am happy to start giving a little back - as small as that 
&gt; contribution may
&gt; &gt; be in the great scheme of things..
&gt; 
&gt; Good example. Compaq have made use of Open Source software in 
&gt; the past and
&gt; are showing their appreciation (at least in part) by allowing 
&gt; a local Linux
&gt; User Group to make use of their premises and even provide 
&gt; tea, coffee and a
&gt; bouncer :-)
&gt; 
&gt; If you'd like more ideas for how you can help a particular Open Source
&gt; project, ask the maintainer. The less time they spend 
&gt; documenting and testing
&gt; stuff, the more time they're coding.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; Matt
