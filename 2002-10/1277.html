way to go!!

What about small solar panels on each valve or a cluster of valves running
of one solar charged 12V gel battery?

I see what you mean - it is getting tricky!!!

What software does your parent's machine use?

It would be quite amusing if I just decided to get back to basics and run
string down the pipe to pull the valves open and closed from a distance
(maybe put the string in another pipe or plastic string in the  pipe
itself).  The idea is the keep stripping it back to keep it simple.  That's
half the fun is keeping a lid on it so it does not develop in to a major
logistical exercise and end its life confined to the forgotten project
drawer in the shed.

&gt; This is not a trivial problem, a linux operating system 
&gt; running a central
&gt; controller would constitute only 20% of the battle.   Your valves,
&gt; controllers, comms and plumbing are the most important part, also the
&gt; hardest to get running.
&gt; 
&gt; Not to put a negative spin on your project here are some of 
&gt; the challanges
&gt; that will cause you headaches with your ideal system;
&gt; 
&gt; - Water ingress into valve/cable connections (causes comms problems)
&gt; - Communications down water pipe unfeasible as majority of 
&gt; pipe is PVC,
&gt; water is a poor conductor (1.5k - 1Meg ohms/m)
&gt; - Cable must be "underground" rated, ie Gell Filled
&gt; - The more conductors the higher the cost of the cable per meter
&gt; - Valves require power to operate, you must signal down the 
&gt; same wires that
&gt; supply power (Can be done but not cheap !!!)
&gt; - Galvanic corrosion of valves/wire caused by DC imbalance 
&gt; (note this is a
&gt; big problem)
&gt; - Distance vs Voltage Drop vs Comms, the longer the wire the 
&gt; less power
&gt; available the harder it is to communicate
&gt; - Lightning !  If it hits the ground anywhere near your 
&gt; system put your
&gt; head between your knees and kiss your  ...... goodbye !
&gt; 
&gt; Here is a couple of links to commercial systems that will 
&gt; show you how some
&gt; of the technical challanges have been addressed.

&gt; 
&gt; In a previous life I was responsible for the installation of 
&gt; Toro based
&gt; Irrigation systems like you described on two Golf Courses 
&gt; here in Adelaide.
&gt; Each project was the better part of 6 months from woe to go, 
&gt; cost around
&gt; 300-400k and were a  real technical PITA (!!!)
&gt; 
&gt; Some suggestions for a home irrigation system would be to 
&gt; take a trip down
&gt; to the local electronics stores and look for the parallel driven relay
&gt; output boards.   I am sure these allow you do daisy chain 
&gt; each board where
&gt; each relay output is addressable.   It may have been a 
&gt; silicon chip kit.
&gt; They also have inputs from memory.   Buy a hefty 24VAC 
&gt; transformer and use
&gt; this to power your valves through the relay switches, 
&gt; Bunnings have a good
&gt; series of 24VAC 8VA valves for around $25.   My Parents place 
&gt; still has a
&gt; trusty 286-16MHz machine in the shed running their watering 
&gt; system.   I
&gt; have been meaning to replace it but the ol' girl just wont 
&gt; kick the bucket
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
