Thanks peter, I am looking into Octree.  You are right about VeriCAD the
English website is in Geman!  What do you mean about the warning?  Which of the
programs that you have used would you say is closest to using AutoCAD
(providing you have used this)?  I am mainly interested as my brother is
looking at starting a design course and am trying to find some Linux
alternatives.  I am interested myself also because most of these programs are
DXF (AutoCAD) compatible and so is Blender.

&gt; BTW, Speaking of CAD on Unix, anyone know of some decent CAD programs for
&gt; Linux?  I have found many but would like to hear from somone who has actually
&gt; used them.  
&gt; 
&gt; Used any of these?
&gt; 
&gt; LinuxCAD <A HREF="http://www.linuxcad.com/">http://www.linuxcad.com/</A> -commercial, claim to compete with AutoCAD
&gt; VariCAD -commercial
&gt; 
&gt; QCAD 
&gt; Varkon
&gt; FREEdraft
&gt; collabcad calloborative using Java and opencascade library
&gt; ARCAD
&gt; 
&gt; clayworks3d -looks like has potential

QCad is ok (2d only) once you get used to to the way the tools are 
organised. I have no real experience with CAD though other than fiddling 
:) I haven't tried any others as yet, mainly because an "apt-cache 
search cad" didn't reveal them (sometime debian makes things too easy :)).

I have previously tried some commercial 3D one that was free for non 
commercial.. but I can't remember what it was called, mainly because it 
was annoying to use so I just stuck with qcad.

I am yet to come to terms with Blender either (not really CAD, though it 
may be useful).
