All this talk of dying hard drives worries me.  I have some old drives still
in use at home - and I wonder if hard drives just suddenly die after a few
years which seems strange or if that is really only for servers in constant
use.  I often don't turn my desktop machine off - although I wonder if my
Linux box spins down the HD?

Doesn't the Linux kernel do a sync every few minutes which makes it hard to
spin down hard drives?

I know of people who have hard drives in their home machines running for
years with no problem - so I wonder how concerned we should be over data on
old(er) drives.

&gt; Subject: RE: New Server
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; With all due respect, and not wanting to start another ide vs 
&gt; scsi war :)
&gt; 
&gt; in the last 2 years I have had more scsi drives die than ide 
&gt; (We had a bad
&gt; batch from the IBM plant in Hungary), but even ignoring this 
&gt; distortion, I
&gt; have to say that I have not had an ide drive die at anything 
&gt; like around a
&gt; year after install. Years (2-5), yes. But not all ide drives 
&gt; by any means.
&gt; There's a couple in a RedHat 4.2 box I can think of that must be years
&gt; old!
&gt; 
&gt; I have ide drives in mailservers (shock!) and quite a few 
&gt; general purpose
&gt; servers around the organisation. They work fine, and whilst 
&gt; there _may_ be
&gt; speed issues with more heavily laden servers than these, as a 
&gt; general rule
&gt; the benefits of cost and simplicity outweigh the counter 
&gt; benefits in the
&gt; scsi camp of speed and robustness.
&gt; 
&gt; Where we have a heavy-hitting database with many users, we use multi
&gt; processors and a many-spindle scsi disk array, but the 
&gt; benefits on a more
&gt; simple requirement, with a lower load are just not enough to 
&gt; justify the
&gt; significant extra expense.
&gt; 
&gt; So if you're building a server that isn't going to be 
&gt; thrashed to an inch
&gt; of it's life, I'd use ide and use the savings on the memory, 
&gt; processor and
&gt; network. Even if your load increases to the point where an 
&gt; upgrade to scsi
&gt; is required, the old ide drives can be used elsewhere, and you're not
&gt; throwing much away if you don't!
&gt; 
&gt; My 2c,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;When it comes to building a server I would not even consider ATA.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The fact that most SCSI drives come with 5yr warrenty vs 6months
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;/1 year for OEM IDE drives.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;I beg to differ!  You certainly can get a 1 year warranty on hard
&gt; &gt; &gt;drives but 3 years is what we get on all our drives (unless we opt
&gt; &gt; &gt;for 1 year - which we don't).  Most of our drives are well and
&gt; &gt; &gt;truly cycled by three years.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ahh warrenty is irrelevant when comparing between SCSI and 
&gt; IDE drives, the
&gt; &gt; figure you both should be concentrating on is Mean Time 
&gt; Between Failture
&gt; &gt; (MTBF).   Undoubtly the IDE drives are fast approaching the 
&gt; speed of the
&gt; &gt; SCSI disks, but leave a IDE drive running 24/7 on average 
&gt; for more than 2-3
&gt; &gt; years and they will die why ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looking at the 10k Seagate SCSI drives they have a *spec'd*  MTBF of
&gt; &gt; 1.2x10^6 hours or 50,000 days continous operation (136 years by my
&gt; &gt; calculator), but this is not taking into account poor (note 
&gt; crap) air
&gt; &gt; circulation around the drives in many pre-rolled servers.   
&gt; This is many
&gt; &gt; times the length of the SCSI warrenty period, like over 27 times.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You will *not* find this information on the Seagate site 
&gt; [1] for their
&gt; &gt; ATA100 drives, so one would have to assume 8760 hrs (1 
&gt; year) which is many
&gt; &gt; times less than the SCSI (~136x).   If you were to use your 
&gt; PC for 4 hours
&gt; &gt; every day then with a MTBF for IDE drives of 8760 hrs the 
&gt; drive would last
&gt; &gt; approximately 6 years which seems about right in my 
&gt; personal experience.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You will get IDE drives that exceed the MTBF, these are the 
&gt; exception or
&gt; &gt; what is commonly called "Wednesday Afternoon" drives where 
&gt; the quality of
&gt; &gt; the drives produced seems to miraculously increase for some 
&gt; reason.   So
&gt; &gt; IDE drives may last *7 years continous* but you cannot be 
&gt; guarenteed of
&gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So if you consider rolling out IDE RAID servers for *real* 
&gt; production use
&gt; &gt; aim at replacing the entire array every 12months, this will 
&gt; give you the
&gt; &gt; added advantage of boosting the array size as drive capacities keep
&gt; &gt; increasing.   Otherwise roll out a SCSI array which you will have to
&gt; &gt; replace in around 5-7 years, mainly due to lack of 
&gt; available storage.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For a home server you have the option of replacing drives 
&gt; or turning the
&gt; &gt; machine off, the choice is up to you.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; [1] or many of the other manufacturers sites, that is not 
&gt; to say that I
&gt; &gt; went and checked every one.
