Damien,

&gt; It's been about a month where it hasn't occurred (I switched / from ext3 to
&gt; ext2), but it just happened again now (and I lost my work of course)...
&gt; Please, can anybody help? If it happens again I think i'm going to cry :(

Don your asbestos suit and all your logs. Take it back under warranty.
You'll most likely get "it's Linux's fault" but if you do tell them it's
not and serve them with a letter, dated and witnessed by a JP (i.e. a
Statutory Declaration) that you demand a replacement under warranty.

You'll need a Statutory Declaration in case they stall long enough for
it to go out of warranty in which case they'll probably attempt the
"it's no longer under warranty" shennanigans. If they try that, take
them straight to the Office of Business and Consumer Affairs and Today
Tongight.

(1) Putting it bluntly, you're an absolute munchking child for not
talking about this and taking it back earlier. I ain't not hardware
expert but clicking hard drives are bad...geez...unless you have Dorothy
Gale in your house, clicking anything is BAD.
