<H1>Blocking Spam - blacklisting IPs?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I have heard that IPs can be blacklisted - which is why that idiot in Perth
tried to sue our courageous anti-spammer - as he placed the idiot in
question on a block list - thereby blocking the idiot's consitutional right
to inundate people with his rubbish.

How can one blacklist IPs?

I go through my ISP (ihug) for email - of course they never do anything when
I report spam requesting the IP be put on a block list for their email
server.  I am not sure if this is because they can't or because they
couldn't care.  They just respond advising me to follow other avenues.

Is it possible to 'reject' traffic and have one's ISP bill the spammer for
wasted bandwidth?  Or legally advise the spammer that they will be billed on
a T&M basis for filtering through their rubbish - at say $10 an email (plus
GST)?  I am seriously considering this path if anyone has any legal advice?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Another possible alternative is shunning. 
&gt; 
&gt; You block the spammers ip address and notify the net block 
&gt; owner. I mean
&gt; block the address from sending email to you, redirect all web request
&gt; from that address to an explaination page with instruction on how to
&gt; contact you. It is necessary to block all ports requests to and from
&gt; that address because some spam contains web addresses for futher
&gt; information promotional material, confirmation of a valid 
&gt; email address.
&gt; 
&gt; If you dont get any response from the spammer or the net block owner,
&gt; you may consider blocking the entire netblock. It is a RFC requirement
&gt; for postmaster address to be read by humans or something to 
&gt; that effect.
&gt; 
&gt; I have read about this method before somewhere on the web about 18
&gt; months ago. I assume that there is a catch. ISPs may not be able to
&gt; follow this path but there is nothing that says that you must 
&gt; carry any
&gt; traffic on your private network as the end user.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I can't believe we as a global community, following 
&gt; thousands of years
&gt; &gt; of successful evolution (no flames please) - need to expend as much
&gt; &gt; resources on network spam as we don security.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What's the latest on legislation around the world on this 
&gt; rubbish?  I
&gt; &gt; know some spammer tried to sue a anti-spam crusader in 
&gt; Perth, failed,
&gt; &gt; went in to spamming again, tried to sue the anti-spam crusader again
&gt; &gt; and is still trying to spam people.  These people clearly are not
&gt; &gt; human - so legislation seems to be the only answer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unless there was a global database of known spammers that the global
&gt; &gt; community could inundate with physical and electronic spam 
&gt; in return?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One get rich quick scam from 5 million people should, theoretically,
&gt; &gt; get the message across - unless their servers explode first.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any success / failure stories to share 
&gt; &gt; &gt; about Spam Assassin?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like a *great* idea if it works..
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the weekend I tested an installation of SpamAssassin 
&gt; at message
&gt; &gt; &gt; accept time. This means that SA is run against each line of 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the message as
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is accepted from the remote system, and the connection is 
&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately
&gt; &gt; &gt; closed with an error.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Advantages:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - saves paying for an entire message to be downloaded and
&gt; &gt; &gt;    processed
&gt; &gt; &gt;      later
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - helps get people off spammers lists because it will be marked
&gt; &gt; &gt;    as 
&gt; &gt; &gt;      a failed delivery
&gt; &gt; &gt;    - uses less system resources
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I did this with Exim 4 with integration work from Marc 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Merlin. Seems happy
&gt; &gt; &gt; so far.
