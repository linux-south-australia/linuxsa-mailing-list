Daniel,

&gt; I thought PGP/GPG was an accepted standard amoung most people?

It comes across as a mime-encoded message. My anti-spam filter
unceremoniously dumps it.

&gt; Personally I think it's a good idea, although I just wish more email
&gt; clients would support it.

Why? It's a public mailing list...why would you want to prove who you are
and to whom? Admittedly a person has attempted to impersonate me once but it
was quite obvious it wasn't me.

&gt; standard... AFAIK GPG and PGP are incompatible as are the different
&gt; major versions of PGP with each other? (this is just what I have been
&gt; lead to believe, I don't actually know for sure)

To a certain extent, yes.

&gt; Preferred to html mail, yes. Actually I heard the issue of PGP on a
&gt; mailing list is one of those religious wars, though I have never seen it
&gt; myself.

:-)

Adding signature clap-trap, unless you have a very good reason to do so (1),
is a waste of bandwidth.

(1) I did once but it's a long story....
