no but as soon as (if) ADSL is available to me I will be.
You can't actually upgrade as I understand it (at the present
time anyway) you have to have the ISDN removed and a PSTN service
(normal single line) put back then get ADSL connected to that.
So you cop a major outage all round.  And as usual there's
no real reason why it has to be like that.

Re your options, same as me it appears:
1) DoV ISDN as you already have
2) satellite (proper two-way is way too expensive so really only
   one-way with modem backchannel - so still takes up a phone
   line so there's $20pm gone for nothing plus the perm ISP link
   for the modem, plus you get to do some "funny" routing, and
   it's not as reliable as I would like.
3) wireless - appears to be airnet, costs more than ADSL but has
   the potential to be good.  One advantage is telstra are out of
   the equation.  Internode apparently also do this (maybe?) but
   I suspect it's somewhat expensive (please say I'm wrong Simon).
