there is also the convenience of being able to select items to view rather
than just switching on the telly and hoping to catch that segment you like.

When I was in the USA - this convenience is what finally pushed me to decide
to get ADSL - it was just such a wonderful time saver.  Not to mention the
ABC broadband site.

Radio Nation also archive many of their shows online.  They always seem to
have great shows at really weird times like Sunday 9am (so people can listen
before going to Church??  Obviously the programmers are from another era).

I am going to work out how to set my Linux box to just go out and fetch ABC
and BBC items of interest and queue them locally on my server.  I won't have
to worry about missing a show or setting the video ever again.

Pay-TV will *never* have that convenience - unless it just becomes another
digital technology - but why pay per view?  I would rather pay $135 / month
and be done with it.

Digital streaming media is the way of the future (for news and information
junkies like me).

Looking at this it is not hard to see who even 8GB will need to be strictly
rationed - but it is certainly sufficient for my needs (for now).

&gt; Ian,
&gt; Wouldn't it be perhaps easier to get Foxtel which has BBC World?
&gt; 
&gt; (am considering this actually, because it now has rally)

&gt; &gt; No - I would always prefer untimed connections but metered 
&gt; bandwidth - if
&gt; &gt; only I could get up to 20GB / month!!!  That would allow up 
&gt; to 2 - 3 hours
&gt; &gt; of BBC news on my ADSL connected TV each night.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Speaking of which - I have always marvelled at the blatant 
&gt; inefficiency of
&gt; &gt; the Internet to handle streaming media - it is host to many 
&gt; many many
&gt; &gt; points.  Isn't IPv6 meant to handle media streaming more efficiently
&gt; &gt; somehow?  Such as broadcasting to many points rather than 
&gt; an individual
&gt; &gt; stream to each individual point even if they are in the same area.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My honest believe is that when streaming media becomes 
&gt; mainstream over ADSL
&gt; &gt; - then demand will most certainly exceed supply.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm just rapt that I can listen to talk back radio in 
&gt; Johannesburg or
&gt; &gt; Eastern Europe over ADSL - much more reliable that my short 
&gt; wave radio and
&gt; &gt; 20 metres of tuned wire.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I wonder if Internode will eventually be able to 'cache' 
&gt; streaming media?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But don't all ISPs have a usage meter for your account 
&gt; &gt; &gt; and/or some sort
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of arrangement to tell you when you're getting near your 
&gt; &gt; &gt; limit for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; month?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The larger ones certainly offer that facility in one form or 
&gt; &gt; &gt; another.  However 
&gt; &gt; &gt; there are problems, eg
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. It is the ISP's meter, not the users
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Some special action has to be taken by the user to see 
&gt; &gt; &gt; what the ISP says 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they have downloaded to date.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. SFAIK you can't see your download credit decreasing in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; real time as you 
&gt; &gt; &gt; surf/download/pick up mail/load news/whatever.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4a. The ISP doesn't mind the user exceeding their allocation 
&gt; &gt; &gt; - its all extra 
&gt; &gt; &gt; income to them and
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4b. Most users would want to be able to exceed their limit 
&gt; &gt; &gt; when they chose - 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they would not want to be cut off in the middle of a download.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. add your egs to taste 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue seems to revolve around the fact that ISPs are 
&gt; charged for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; bandwidth, and want to have fees which reflect that, whereas 
&gt; &gt; &gt; users would 
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably prefer all-you-can-eat timed access.
&gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO if an ISP offered a programme where you paid for time, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; paying more/hr for 
&gt; &gt; &gt; a fast link than for a slow one, many issues would be gone.  
&gt; &gt; &gt; The current 
&gt; &gt; &gt; $1/hr (give us $50 and you have 3 months to use the time) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; that some ISPs 
&gt; &gt; &gt; offer is excellent, but only applies to slow dial-up accounts.
