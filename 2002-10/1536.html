Hi,  ' Me know nothing ' BUT by accident I found in Mandrake 9 QCAD and
it look to be something to experiment with.
Jacob.

&gt; 
&gt; 3D Acceleration has been around for as long as CAD and 3D modelling.
&gt; Games had nothing to do with development of hardware acceleration.
&gt; Think SGI developed OpenGL to play Quake?  Games were written to utilise
&gt; existing hardware acceleration technology then the popularity of this
&gt; has made 3D acceleration go mainsteam and not just in Unix CAD boxes.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And remember, the gaming industry industry had a huge role on in 
&gt; &gt; &gt; pushing the envelope for desktop hardware. Game requirments drive 
&gt; &gt; &gt; hardware developers to create faster, more powerful everythings 
&gt; &gt; &gt; (CPU's, memory, GFX cards, networking equipment, etc, etc).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Games may have had *some* influence (e.g. in graphics, but what about 
&gt; &gt; the influence of photo editing on printers?), but what game requires 
&gt; &gt; gigabit ethernet?  Technology is following the curve of Moore's Law 
&gt; &gt; long before games were an influencing factor.
&gt; 
&gt; Games never really had much influence on the actual technology being 
&gt; developed.  Faster CPUs, larger capacity for memory and hard drives, 
&gt; networking equipment, etc would have been built regardless of the gaming
&gt; 
&gt; industry.  
&gt; 
&gt; However the home gaming industry did have a significant effect on the
&gt; home 
&gt; adoption of computers.  Having games was a real selling point for
&gt; computers 
&gt; in the home.  This created a larger consumer market for computers, and 
&gt; allowed more companies to make PC hardware, which in turn helped to
&gt; drive 
&gt; down the prices of the hardware to a level that could be more
&gt; affordable, 
&gt; etc.  Moore's law predicted the power of computer processing, but gaming
&gt; 
&gt; helped with the economics.
&gt; 
&gt; As for what game requires gigabit ethernet?  All of them (to get a real
&gt; low 
&gt; ping while streaming those MP3s at LAN parties :)  and probably QuakeIV.
&gt; 
&gt; Also I might postulate that perhaps on board 3D acceleration was given a
&gt; bit 
&gt; of a boost by gaming.
