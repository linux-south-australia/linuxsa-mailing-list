Hey all,

I just had some uni presentations, and of course we all use powerpoint. 
During a break between everybody elses presentations, I copied my ppt 
presentation onto the laptop that was being used, opened it up and ran 
through the presentation in full screen mode. Everything worked fine, 
all the graphics displayed correctly. The only problem was that it had 
replaced my numbering with hyphens, not a big deal.

So I sit down, satisfied that everything will go well. Then it's time to 
do my presentation, and low and behold one of the images does not 
display and I'm left saying "uh.. this was supposed to show blah, but 
it's decided not to". What image type was this? It was a PNG of course, 
why would Micro$oft want to support PNG? The funny thing is, M$ Office's 
bugs are random and you can't work around them.

How long until Linux + some nice office package are the norm? I 
personally cannot wait, if it was my computer we were running on, we 
would've been using Linux + openoffice. Heck, even kpresenter will do a 
better job than powerpoint.

I recently did a report using openoffice writer, and once I got used to 
the program, I can say my stress levels decreased a lot.

Just some frustrating thoughts I had to share :)

Damien
