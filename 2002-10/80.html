&gt; &gt; But then you have to maintain yet another set of ACLs, as opposed to just
&gt; &gt; continuing to use Posix ACLs on your filesystem with Maildir++.
&gt; 
&gt; And having to maintain user accounts on the machine to implement those
&gt; filesystem ACLs.  Non-rhetorical question (i.e. I don't know) - Does
&gt; Linux still implement the UID in 16 bits? 

The Linux kernel has 32-bit uid_t and gid_t since version 2.4 on all
architectures, glibc has supported them for quite a bit longer. But some
architectures have never had 32-bit calls, ie when you did a chown() it
never used 16 bits. On lesser architectures (ie ones that did use 16-bit
calls :-) there is an architecture-specific 32-bit version of affected
syscalls, eg chown32.

&gt; &gt; In practice the worst problems are functionality not scaling.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought they implemented their "Murder" IMAP aggregator to get around
&gt; that?

Murder does scaling not functionality so I don't follow your comment (it
muxes IMAP connections among multiple back-end servers.) I still claim
that you hit functional problems first with Cyrus long before you hit
scaling problems, even though in theory you can show that Berkley DB won't
scale as easily as a filesystem will etc etc.
