This is from David Bullock:

-----------

Richard Sharpe, a prominent open source developer will be giving a talk
regarding working on open source for capitalism, in a special meeting
of the AUUG this Thursday (Oct 17, 2002), 7pm, Level 3, 132 Grenfell St
(ie. Internode, in the old AAMI building).  Non-members are welcome to
attend.

Below is a brief bio about Richard and an abstract about the talk:

 
An Open Source Participant's Perspective on working for Capitalism

ABSTRACT

Richard Sharpe is an open source software participant who has worked on
packages like Samba and Ethereal, and who lived in Adelaide from 1984
until 2001.
 
Since leaving Adelaide, he has worked at Panasas, Inc, one of the 
hopeful new breed of Network Attached Storage companies in the US. 
During that time he has worked on integrating Samba into Panasas' 
vision, which has involved modifications to Samba to handle a richer ACL 
environment, as well as integrating sendfile (and recvfile, a new 
syscall under FreeBSD) into Samba with a goal of improving throughput in 
NAS environments. He has also worked on tasks like pushing SIDs into the 
FreeBSD kernel to improve  the performance of such fundamental 
operations as checking group  ownership in a file system that tries to 
provide both Windows and UNIX  functionality.
 
This talk will introduce you a to what Panasas is trying to build
and then will discuss Richard's experiences in working for Panasas. It
will also provide information on what is coming in Samba 3.0.0 and will
discuss the benefits of having commercial enterprises using and
supporting
Open Source Software as well as present a perspective on the power of 
Open Source Software.



Hope to see you there!

Regards,
David Bullock

Chairman, AUUG, SA.
