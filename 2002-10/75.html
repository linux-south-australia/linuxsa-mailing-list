Hello Ian,

Been nice to read your posts. Good discussions, etc.

:-)

Anyway, I don't know much about the specific case you are refering to, 
but I get the idea that you are kind of curious about Usian law and how 
it affects spam.

First, the standard answer:

After the United States became independent from Brittian, we knew that 
we were actually fairly satisfied with the British system, but for a few 
things that really ticked us off and caused us to rebel.

When we wrote up our constitution we decided to put the British system 
is place but include a list of things that the governement couldn't do 
to the people.  They ended up being called the Bill of Rights:

<A HREF="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/bill_of_rights/amendments_1-10.html">http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/bill_of_rights/amendments_1-10.html</A>

That in effect, is the law that lets people send you spam.

However, the Supreme Court has determined that yelling "fire!" in a 
movie theatre is not guaranteed by the first amendment.

There are probably similar laws in Australia, and that is probably what 
DSL was talking about in the thread.

&gt;There was a famous case in the USA about a lawyer who put a spammer on
&gt;notice that he will be charged at $20 a spam or somethng - and I believe he
&gt;constructed in such a way that it was legally valid (being a lawyer).  I am
&gt;really intrigued by that.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure what Australian legislation will permit ISPs or individuals to
&gt;do to recover lost T&M?
