 cromwell,

To be honest I haven't had much experience actually using these distributions
but I have put a LOT of time into looking at the alternatives for computers
with small hard drives.  

&gt;would you have a reccomendation for a fullest/smallest (i
&gt;know, i know, it's a trade off) console build?

As it was pointed out to me there is no reason why you couldn't use a popular
distribution such as Debian (or others) and choose minimal install options.  I
looked into Debian and it has a network install obtion where minimal packages
are installed and then other packages are added (untill you fill the hard
drive!). See <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/distrib/">http://www.debian.org/distrib/</A>

I personally wanted to try and install on some minimal hardware (drive space,
RAM, processor) without a CD drive so I came across

Debian network install 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/distrib/floppyinst">http://www.debian.org/distrib/floppyinst</A> (20 floppies)

"You must have at least 12MB of memory and 110MB of hard disk space. For a
minimal console-based system (all standard packages), 250MB is required. If you
want to install a reasonable amount of software, including the X Window System,
and some development programs and libraries, you'll need at least 400MB. For a
more or less complete installation, you'll need around 800MB"  
-<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/install</A>

ZipSlack (Slackware compatible) (100MB) (fits on 24 floppies or Zipdisk)
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.com/zipslack/">http://www.slackware.com/zipslack/</A>

www.peanutlinux.org
Then as I mentioned (600MB installed for 9.3) there is Peanut Linux which is a
good balance between functionality and size, although its main drawcard for me
is X-Windows and KDE.  Not bad for a 220MB download

There are plenty of smaller versions out there but it really depends on your
application.  I have copies of these distro's plan to do some more thorough
testing when exams are over, let me know if there is anything else I might be
able to help with.

Hope you don't mind me copying to list,

Nic Thiele

Nicholas, these interest me, i'm in particular interested in doing a
build 
aimed for the blind, which may or may not involve X-Windows, at the
moment 
i'm trying to see what compatibility issues exist with console clients
versus 
GUI clients, would you have a reccomendation for a fullest/smallest (i
know, 
i know, it's a trade off) console build?

Best regards,

cromwell

&gt; like to think installing on minimal hard drive space is my specialty.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't want to stuff around with Linux from Scratch there are
lots of
&gt; specialty distros available.  Also someone suggested you try Debian, I
read
&gt; on this list that you can do a minimal install and then add the extra
&gt; packages later.  I have also found Zip Slack to be an alternative
-fits on
&gt; a Zip disk. Let me know if you are interested in my personal favorite
&gt; Peanut Linux -a 200MB download and can provide KDE etc.  The latest
version
&gt; (7.3) wants 600MB but get an earlier version or cut back on packages
such
&gt; as KDE,

&gt; &gt; By the way, I
&gt;
&gt; have an 8mb
&gt; EDO memory
&gt; module that I
&gt; rescued from a
&gt;
&gt; &gt; damagedPC
&gt;
&gt; before it hit the
&gt; dumpster. I think
&gt; you need them in
&gt;
&gt; &gt; pairs, but you
&gt;
&gt; are
&gt;
&gt; &gt; welcome to it if
&gt;
&gt; it helps. I think
&gt; EDO memory
&gt; was the go in
&gt; P166
&gt;
&gt; &gt; days...
&gt; &gt; I'll have a hunt
&gt;
&gt; around, I may
&gt; also have another
&gt; &lt; 1gb Disk Drive
&gt; here
&gt;
&gt; &gt; somewhere that
&gt;
&gt; you could have.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Are you SA
&gt;
&gt; based?
&gt;
&gt; yeah i live near
&gt; Modbury. Thanks
&gt; for the RAM and
&gt; the HD if you can
&gt; find it, anyone
&gt; who says the
&gt; linux SA group
&gt; aren't nice guys
&gt; (with a few
&gt; exceptions) is an
&gt; idiot.
&gt;
&gt; I've included my
&gt; Phone No. in my
&gt; signature
&gt; (although during
&gt; the day it's
&gt; probably easier to
&gt; email me) so you
&gt; can get in touch
&gt; with me.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again
