Well,

&gt; &gt; (1) I did once but it's a long story....
&gt; 
&gt; Well with the all the saved bandwidth of the 99.x% of people who don't
&gt; sign their messages, there's enough for a long story ;-P

I had zapped a new user for something, and that user decided to go off list.
Mind you, he begun having a go at me and having a go at one of the List
Eldars when you've only first started posting isn't always the best thing to
do.

Anyway, he publicly advertised his ICQ number.

The next thing he does is claim he's gone off list and everyone does
the usual"you are so dreadful to newbies" chant at me. So I thought, hmmmm,
this is not the outcome I want.

So I contacted this person by ICQ.

Anyway, after proving that I am fantastically persistent, eventually he
tells me that if I keep on contacting him then he'll "crack my system" and
do other rather illegal stuff.

I thought *hmmm*.

So I wrote up a polite e-mail to the effect that threatening to crack
people's computers is actually a criminal offence and that he should desist.
And I signed it with one of my PGP signatures. 

Needless to say, he blew his cover by actually responding to that post.

Eventually I managed to help him out with what he needed to do, mainly
interactively via ICQ and things went quiet after a while.
