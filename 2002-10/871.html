Then why @ 20/c / MB?  Why not 1 or 2c?  I don't believe this has anything
to do with the ISP at all - it's happening upstream somewhere.

I believe that when it is finally cheaper to transfer an ISO over the Net
than post it - that is when we have finally hit turning point.  For now good
old fashion postage is often a cheaper alternative.

&gt; 
&gt; I never felt I was being screwed, at least not on the basis 
&gt; of having to
&gt; buy by the byte.  I'm obviously going to have to buy by some 
&gt; measurable
&gt; quantity, and if not by the byte, then by what?  By the 
&gt; bandwidth reserved
&gt; for me?  Could be.  There certainly are carriers who sell 
&gt; that way, and
&gt; they put a convincing argument if you can scale up that far.  
&gt; I had some
&gt; very nice people from Uunet in my office, and that was 
&gt; exactly what they
&gt; wanted to sell me: a fix price pipe, charged by how big it 
&gt; is.  I imagine
&gt; they buy even bigger pipes and split them into smaller 
&gt; quantities, adding
&gt; their profit.  Well done Uunet, owned by MCI, a division of 
&gt; WorldCom, now
&gt; gone bust.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem with buying a pipe is that I don't know how big I want it.
&gt; Well, I do: I want it as big as possible, but I can't afford 
&gt; that.  Well,
&gt; no, I *can* afford it if I only have to pay for it when I use 
&gt; it.  That's
&gt; what I want: I want to pay by the pipe-size only when I use 
&gt; it.  I think
&gt; that's almost like paying per byte.
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I did eventually decide I couldn't quite justify 
&gt; the cost of
&gt; that Uunet pipe.  If I could have spread my usage out over 
&gt; larger parts of
&gt; the day, so that I needed a smaller pipe during peak time, it 
&gt; might have
&gt; been different, but I was running a small ISP so that wasn't 
&gt; an option.
&gt; The numbers were pretty marginal, anyway.  I think it was 
&gt; something like,
&gt; 50% average utilisation of a 512K pipe cost the same as 
&gt; buying that data
&gt; per megabyte, so the potential was there to save money, but buying per
&gt; megabyte meant I could bring it in on a 2Mbps link, so for my volume
&gt; it worked out cheaper and faster.
&gt; 
&gt; I *like* paying per byte.  It gives me the best service that 
&gt; I can afford.
