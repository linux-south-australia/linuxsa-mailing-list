I think people have really forgotten how low end hardware can route 
packets effectively.

A Cisco 2500 series router is a Motorola 68030 with a little bit of 
hardware around it.  A 2514 can cope with routing 2x10Mbps ethernet and 
2x2Mbps serial, admittedly JUST doing the routing, not doing complex 
ACLs or anything.  (They just don't teach kids to optimise access-lists 
these days - routers are just too fast - where's the fun in that??).

(A total of 24Mbps is 2.4MBytes of traffic per second, which ain't THAT 
hard to move around a 16bit bus! Yeah I know I only calculated it for 
half duplex worth of traffic ...)

Cisco sold a few (millions) of the them over their lifetime.  Talk about 
ROI.

&gt; Telstra had an attempt at telling me that my 650 Mhz Athlon with 256Mb
&gt; of memory 1/2 Gig of swap and RedHat 7.1 with a 2.4.18 XFS enabled
&gt; kernel wasn't capable of coping with my 28.8Kbps link. When I promptly
&gt; retorted that I'd seen a TurboLinux Box running on a Celeron 500Mhz with
&gt; 64Mb of memory and shonky hardware cope with multiple streams that could
&gt; be measured as 512Kbps I got the "I'm only a line technician..." spiel.
