And I should read my mail in order, that way Mike Campbell's quoting
would've made more sense.  C'est la vie.

&gt;&gt; Horse hockey.

&gt; I've heard this before, do horses really play hockey?

C'noath.

&gt;&gt; Technology is following the curve of Moore's
&gt;&gt; Law long before games were an influencing factor.

&gt; Games never really had much influence on the actual technology being
&gt; developed.

Which was what I was getting at.  I don't see many 8 or 16 way Intel
motherboards, but I use such machines at work regularly (admittedly,
non Intel).  I don't think gaming had much at all to do with their
development.

But we've already put it down to misunderstanding, and moved on.

&gt; However the home gaming industry did have a significant effect on the home
&gt; adoption of computers.

Agreed, and it has had economic influences at the PC end of the market
as well, but I doubt it's ever been a driving force for the R&D side of
the equation (i.e. they taken existing technology and made it cheaper -
they haven't caused e.g. the rate in reduction of die sizes to increase).
