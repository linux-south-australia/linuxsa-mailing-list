Ian,

&gt; great - and we all love to trash members of lesser species - but if we think
&gt; about it for a moment - I don't recall *one* person from David's BBQ that
&gt; was happy with the status quo.

Just which status quo were you talking about?

&gt; Funny how on the list we are all superior to
&gt; all other consumers - but in person we are just like everyone else.

Did I say that anyone is superior? I said that I don't sign contracts that I 
don't understand and that people who do are, in my opinion, a tad stupid.

&gt; I was the only person there who is actually getting ADSL

And this justifies you how?

&gt; I am the only
&gt; person that thinks the status quo sucks here

I beg your pardon? Since when did I say I agreed with the status quo? Do I need 
to repeat - in my opinion people who sign contracts they don't understand are 
at best ill advised if not stupid?

&gt; but not one person justifying
&gt; the status quo (who is subject to it - not the ones getting deals through
&gt; their employer or otherwise) is planning on getting ADSL.

The justification for the rate limiting on ADSL was a discussion held long 
back. I'd suggest you search the archives about it. It happened around the time 
when Telstra imposed, out of the blue, a 3Gb cap. Internode, at least, and 
others, made some good points on both sides of the argument.

&gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why don't you all have
&gt; ADSL?

That is a rather obtuse comment is it not? What if:

* your line is pair gained
* you don't have the money
* you don't WANT an Internet Connection
* you already have Satellite
* you've got cable

...in other words, rather than ask a question that you obviously want to answer 
yourself, why don't you answer it? Reading between the lines you are saying 
that YOU are SUPERIOR to US because NOT ALL OF US have ADSL...

OR that WE DON'T LIKE DOWNLOAD CAPS so WE ARE BOYCOTTING ADSL.

*both of these conclusing are rather preposterous if you ask me*
