No true - we have much use for them here in our office.  Timelines are short
and it is often necessary to confirm receipt - say for a change going
through very shortly or for an invoice statement, etc.  We find it very
useful.

However, Outlook can be configured to not mark a message read until you tell
it to - I use this myself - to provide some control over the receipts.

&gt; There is an option in Outlook somewhere to set how long the 
&gt; mail is in the preview pain before it is marked read.
&gt; Change it to 10 minutes or something if you like.

&gt; I'm sorry, but Microsoft's implementation of this is 
&gt; extermely poor. Under
&gt; Outhouse, merely moving off an email to another in the 
&gt; preview pane generates
&gt; a read receipt, when in fact all that I've done is move off 
&gt; an email that
&gt; is currently highlighted (over which I have no control, for 
&gt; example if I've
&gt; moved to the Inbox from another folder) to an email that I 
&gt; *do* intend to
&gt; read.  I'll then mark the previous email as unread (an action 
&gt; that requires
&gt; me to select it again), but that doesn't negate the receipt 
&gt; that's already
&gt; gone out.  Occasionally, I'll get a call several hours later 
&gt; saying "Why
&gt; haven't you actioned that email that you read", when I 
&gt; haven't done any
&gt; such thing.
&gt; 
&gt; As User Interface Metaphors go, Read Receipts are one of the 
&gt; crappiest.
&gt; What next, an Understanding Receipt? [1]
