You're right - the mailbox (of 0 bytes) is actually being created with
the adduser command.  If the user.user mailbox file is deleted and then
user is sent mail, procmail creates the mailbox file with user.mail
ownership.  Yay!  I can't see any options in adduser to change this
behaviour

So procmail is creating the mailbox owned by user.mail, which is great,
but the mailbox still has 600 permissions.  I need 660 so that group
mail can read/write the mailbox, and thus Neomail can work.

man procmailrc mentions this:

       UMASK       The name says it all (if it doesn't, then for­
                   get about this one :-).  Anything assigned  to
                   UMASK  is  taken  as  an octal number.  If not
                   specified, the umask defaults to 077.  If  the
                   umask  permits o+x, all the mailboxes procmail
                   delivers to directly will receive an o+x  mode
                   change.  This can be used to check if new mail
                   arrived.

We've been playing around with this, but we still can't seem to make it
do what we want.  I'm still not sure if this is the option we need.

Jordan.

ps:  thanks muchly for your help thus far

&gt; &gt;&gt; Shouldn't do - depending on the mail delivery agent, it normally takes
&gt; &gt;&gt; care of that.  What's Mlocal set to in your sendmail.cf?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mlocal,         P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qSPfhn9,
&gt; &gt; S=EnvFromL/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
&gt; &gt;                 T=DNS/RFC822/X-Unix,
&gt; &gt;                 A=procmail -t -Y -a $h -d $u
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the -d flag on procmail tells it to run with the uid of the recipient,
&gt; but procmail's man doesn't explain what the group should be.  The F=S flag
&gt; tells sendmail to leave itself running as root (so that the delivery program
&gt; can setuid to the recipient), and the default user:group for sendmail is
&gt; typically mail:mail, so it's probably running as group mail when sendmail
&gt; invokes local for final delivery.  My guess is that the mail files aren't
&gt; being created by procmail, which is why the group id is getting fouled up.
&gt; Just as a note, the permissions on my /var/spool/mail are 775, and owned
&gt; by root:mail.
