Karun seems to have disappeared.  His web site was
<A HREF="http://www.karun.lorikeet.id.au">http://www.karun.lorikeet.id.au</A> but that's no longer there.  we got a bunch
from him.  very good service.  just about every distro & version for $75 -
about 25 discs.
Prolly he got sick of sticking CDs in his burner.  :)

I personally think that the distro's themselves should get their marketing
act together and at least have a contact in australia that distributes CDs
and the profits go back to the programmers for more of the good stuff.
places like everythinglinux.com.au etc are quick which is good, but at the
end of the day it doesn't really help redhat/mandrake financially.

anyway, that's my 2 cents worth.

&gt; So,
&gt; What are people willing to pay per CD for this kind of service?
(including
&gt; postage?)
&gt;
&gt; $5? $10? $20 per set?

$10 a set seems about the mark.  That's what a set of M9 discs cost to order
(plus postage) at everything-linux.com.au.  Might be a bit of waiting for
those though . . . . till they get them stamped.  The price would equate to
about the same as DSL suggested too ($3/disc).

Karun Zambiec was selling discs at a reasonable price too.  Haven't heard
whether he's still doing it though.  Can't remember his web address so if
you're interested, it's probably in the Linux-SA archives somewhere.

Cheers,
