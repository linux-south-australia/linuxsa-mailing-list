&gt; Dear Insiders,
&gt; 
&gt; In January of this year, Lindows.com released our first peek at LindowsOS with SP1 (Sneak Preview 1). Since then, just 10 months later, LindowsOS has been through some growing up and changing. The idea of our Insider's program was to take a year and work with our Insiders in coming up with the best OS we could to accomplish our mission of "Bringing Choice to the Desktop Computer." We would then take that OS, built together, and share it with the world as our "General Release."
&gt; 
&gt; As we now approach the General Release of LindowsOS, it is time for us to look at what we tried that worked, and what didn't. What we release to the world in this first General Release of LindowsOS will set the tone of what LindowsOS is all about. With this assessment, we are planning some significant changes that we wanted to share with our Insiders.
&gt; 
&gt; We try to define "what's working," as those things that get people to actually USE LindowsOS, not just look at it, tinker with it, play around with it, etc. So, given that definition, what worked with LindowsOS this past year?
&gt; 
&gt; - The simple, fast, void-of-a-lot-of-complicated-questions installer.
&gt; - Incorporating stable and reliable components, such as Netscape and StarOffice.
&gt; - Click-N-Run. Far and away the most "right" thing LindowsOS has introduced to date.
&gt; - Paying attention to all the little things, like making sure file associations are set up properly, a clean and familiar interface, printing, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; We certainly still have a long way to go, but we're trying to develop on those things that make LindowsOS USEABLE.
&gt; 
&gt; We need to develop on our strengths. As we assess this area, we have decided to make the following two changes with the General Release of LindowsOS. You'll see the following changes in version 3.0:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The MS Windows compatibility code WINE will be moved from the core OS to the Click-N-Run Warehouse. Those who wish to use WINE will need to use Click-N-Run to add it to the OS.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are some of the reasons why we want to make this change...
&gt; 
&gt; A. As many of you have read in the discussions here and here, a majority of LindowsOS users do not use WINE for any day-to-day productivity. The Warehouse will be a more ideal location so that WINE can be added by those who want it, but not included for those who don't.
&gt; 
&gt; B. WINE is not yet stable enough and has a long way to go yet before it can reliably run MS Windows software. Until WINE can more reliably perform the task it was developed for, we believe it makes more sense to keep it as an option in the Warehouse. We want to keep the core, default OS to those things that work reliably and fully. For example, we wouldn't want to ship LindowsOS with say a word processor that only worked a small percentage of the time and was still very much under development. Such products can, however, be ideally put in the Warehouse where the user can decide if they want to try it out, even as it is being developed.
&gt; 
&gt; C. Having WINE in the Warehouse sends the appropriate message to the marketplace, namely that it's optional, and not part of the default, core OS. Because WINE was installed by default, many people assumed that it would run many MS Windows compatible programs. Those familiar with WINE know this just isn't the case. (I define "run" to mean that the MS Windows programs can be run in a reliable and useable way, not just getting some of the screens to come up.)
&gt; 
&gt; D. It will be easier for us to keep WINE current and maintained with the latest WINE version by keeping it separate from the core OS. Just like it's easy to add a new version of GIMP by updating GIMP in the Warehouse, this will also be true with WINE. Those who want to use WINE will be able to install and keep it currently very easily with Click-N-Run. Also, WINE is notorious for one version fixing problems with one MS Windows program, only to break another. This will allow users to NOT update to the latest WINE if they so choose.
&gt; 
&gt; E. We can free up engineering and QA resources to improve LindowsOS and add more and better products to the Click-N-Run Warehouse. If you click here, you'll see a list that we use here to jot ideas down for products we want to see added to the Warehouse. As you'll see, it's a pretty long list and more programs get added to this list every week. We believe stocking the Warehouse full of great Linux products will produce a much better experience for LindowsOS users.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean that LindowsOS is completely abandoning WINE? No, it's still an option that will be growing and evolving. However, we are going to be spending more and more resources on getting great Linux programs in the Warehouse rather than investing more and more into WINE. (See my analogy of Trains, Wings, and Airplanes in this thread.) Lindows.com has always given back all our enhancements to WINE back to the WINE tree and will continue to do so. Since WINE is GPL, the WINE used by all the distros is 99% identical.
&gt; 
&gt; Some will feel we are backing away from a promise to get MS Windows software to run on LindowsOS. But that has never been our "promise." Our only promise has been, and remains, to bring Choice to the Desktop Computer. We feel that the Click-N-Run Warehouse and supporting Linux programs and encouraging more development in this area is a better way to be true to the commitment of bringing choice to the desktop computer.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, in the early days of starting this company, we were hopeful that WINE was a possible strategy to bringing choice to desktop computers, but it became evident early on that it would be years before it worked well enough to be used on a day-by-day basis. We believe native Linux application development will out pace WINE enhancements.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, WINE doesn't have the same economic win that you find with Linux software. Not only does Lindows.com want to bring more choices, we want to bring better-priced choices. For Linux to catch on with the masses, there needs to be a compelling reason. The licensing and cost advantages of Linux software over traditional MS Windows software will be that compelling reason for the masses to use Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Some will feel that this is a mistake because of the marketing benefits of "saying" that you can run MS Windows programs. We think letting people believe that WINE is more stable than it is would in the long run hurt us. Since April with the introduction of Click-N-Run, we have been sharing a realistic view of MS Windows compatibility. Those who use LindowsOS on a regular basis, know that the real value does not come at all from WINE, but rather comes from being able to easily install and run stable, reliable programs that WORK. (Those of you who use LindowsOS, ask yourself, how would you feel if we announced plans to get rid of Click-N-Run?!?!) Even though the rest of the world doesn't fully understand and appreciate CNR YET, it is our strength and those who try LindowsOS will soon find this out. We want to continue to play on our strengths.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: Those who update to the General Release using Click-N-Run, rather than a new installation, will still have WINE installed.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. The General Release of LindowsOS, version 3.0, will no longer include a "Preview Install." We have always known that installing Linux on top of a FAT file system with MS Windows would never be as fast and stable as a pure Linux file system. We hope that having had the Preview Install option in the past has made it possible for many of you to preview LindowsOS. Now, however, with LindowsOS coming pre-configured on computers, we want to focus 100% of our engineering resources into the main use of LindowsOS, and that is running it with a Linux file system.
&gt; 
&gt; Most Insiders do not use this option any longer anyway, so before we roll out LindowsOS to the rest of the world, we thought now was the best time to remove this option. Those of you who were using the Preview Install, may want to consider a full and complete LindowsOS installation, or partition your hard drive as a way of still running LindowsOS side-by-side with MS Windows. (The Advanced Install option which installs LindowsOS into a partition uses a Linux file system on the LindowsOS partition.)
&gt; 
&gt; Since we will no longer be supporting the Preview Install, this also means the migration tools will no longer work. After 3.0, we have plans on introducing far more complete and sophisticated tools for people to migrate their data from ANY version of MS Windows to their My.Lindows account, and then pull it in to their LindowsOS computer.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure these two changes will be seen as a disappointment to some, but we feel they are sound decisions for the majority of LindowsOS users and will help free up resources to make those parts of LindowsOS that work best to work even better!
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to post your comments and questions here, and I'll try to address them.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Kevin
