&gt; You could get really fancy and do your accounting with ipac-ng (or ipac) and
&gt; then setup a script that watches your total for the month and if it reaches
&gt; a certain limit (7Gb) it throttles you to a much slower connection.  you can
&gt; email your self daily reports as well and i think it has some graph output
&gt; though i gave up trying to get this to work.  it needed about 19 different
&gt; dependancies of which i couldn't find half.  &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; rant #1.  all software sites should have a collection of the dependancies
&gt; they need, not a link which will probably be broken after three days.  I've
&gt; come across about 2 peices of software that have the stuff i needed.  no
&gt; mucking around searching never.rpmfind.net  :)
&gt; 
&gt; rant #2.  linux rpm from the cl should have a flag or something that
&gt; automatically installs all the dependancies needed from the CDs. the front
&gt; end does, or used to but it was pretty cludgy.  i installed something and
&gt; literly went through about 14 or so thing needsing other things down to
&gt; about 3 or 4 levels deep.  this should be automatic.  or a flag to say just
&gt; do it.  having winged, is there a way you can do this?  :(

I can't resist... apt.

&lt;ahh, that's better :)&gt;
