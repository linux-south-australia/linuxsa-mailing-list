Hi There,

I've spoken to Kylie Wilson, Robyn Manning's sister, and she's told me
that Teen Challenge in Murray Bridge has been burned to the ground. It
appears that thieves or looters broke into their bookstore or second
hand shop, took some goods and then set the premises alight.

Unfortunately, some of the goods burned are not covered by insurance.

For those of you who don't know, Teen Challenge Murray Bridge provides
assistance and counselling to younger people who have suffered rape,
drug abuse, other types of abuse and alcohol abuse. I understand
that the Government funds only one such organisation in any defined
area, and that Teen Challenge is the designated organisation in the
rural riverland area.

Their web-site is at:


* <A HREF="http://www.lm.net.au/~tcmb/who.html">http://www.lm.net.au/~tcmb/who.html</A>


Computer Bank SA:


* <A HREF="http://sa.computerbank.org.au/">http://sa.computerbank.org.au/</A>


...is working to donate a number of computers and other necessary
equipment; a computer has been arranged for Tuesday to enable Teen
Challenge to start rebuilding.

It's taken Teen Challenge four years to establish themselves as a
viable, safe place for counselling and training. There's little we can
do but to offer our help and our support to the organisation.

However, any donations (and I have a suspicion donations of anything at
all), will be appreaciated. Donations such as computer equipment to
ComputerBank, to cash donations would help. ComputerBank will, of
course, install its customised version of Debian on all donated computer
equipment.

If you can think of any way we might be able to help, then please feel
free to contact me directly or call me on 0402 440993.
