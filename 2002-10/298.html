&gt; &gt; &gt; So while I agree wholeheartilly with a lot of sentiments aboiut giving
&gt; &gt; rewards 
&gt; &gt; &gt; to people who are working out of their garage, I also think it's important
&gt; &gt; to 
&gt; &gt; &gt; support the _companies_ who are targetting effort where no one else might
&gt; &gt; be.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since people were interested in a local angle... the only distro
&gt; &gt; co-ordinated from Australia is Debian (AJ, Release Coordinator), plus two
&gt; &gt; BSD core team members. The testing and packaging you speak of are done
&gt; &gt; very well indeed by these distros. Do these count as 'companies', the way
&gt; &gt; you were thinking?
&gt; 
&gt; Sure.  On the coordination front, the Gnome Release Manager is 'jdub' - another 
&gt; Aussie (in Sydney I believe).

Interesting point, I wasn't thinking distribution and packaging efforts
other than operating systems. Hmm, I managed to not notice the president
of the XFree86 project move from Australia (to the US according to the web
page) so that doesn't count. Not sure where you draw the line though
between an OS and an application, think of the release engineering
requirements of the Samba suite and its related projects for example.
