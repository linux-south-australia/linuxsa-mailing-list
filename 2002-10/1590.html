Maybe you could use a PS2 or an Xbox running mandrake 9. then you could just
use the standard controller(or optional cordless remote) for your interface
remote. if you were running a decoder that has some kind of avs support, you
could output it to a standard TV for cool effect :) and use the tv to set
your play lists. you would also have the advantage of a DVD player for more
storage than standard CD and they would both be capable of decent DivX
performance. I also think they both have surround sound output and i know
that the ps2 has an optical out for 5.1

just an idea.

I SERIOUSLY doubt a 486 would handle video!!!  (Brian - or am I just jumping
in again - whoops).  Audio perhaps?  I wonder if a Pentium is needed as a
minimum?

&gt; Quoting Michael Gratton &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@vee.net">mike@vee.net</A>&gt;:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'd want to do a few more things, such as running esd on it and so on -
&gt;&gt;in fact that may be the first step. I could hit the remote esd instance
&gt;&gt;from my notebook instead of the local one when playing music, so the
&gt;&gt;music actually gets played through the stereo instead of my notebook's
&gt;&gt;tinny speakers. Storage for the oggs themselves will probably be on a
&gt;&gt;separate machine in the end, as well.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Still, for me, a requirement would be having a device near the stereo to
&gt;&gt;play the music. This would run the decoder with playlist, a
&gt;&gt;network-accessable esd instance and a web application server. I want it
&gt;&gt;close to the stereo to minimise the length of the RCA run - less
&gt;&gt;interference and less cable snaking all over the house. Another req
&gt;&gt;would be to have a UI close to the stereo as well. This just needs to be
&gt;&gt;a web browser and a pointing device (a touch screen would work well, as
&gt;&gt;was pointed out to me off-list), and needs to be close becuase most
&gt;&gt;people will head over to to the stereo when they want to listen to some
&gt;&gt;music.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So I may as well combine the two devices into the one machine. I'd like
&gt;&gt;to netboot it so it can be diskless, but I don't know if that is
&gt;&gt;possible with a mac. I'd also like to use it for automatically ripping
&gt;&gt;and encoding new CDs. So for me, having an iMac sitting on top of the
&gt;&gt;stereo is pretty useful.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm, perhaps you should look at

&gt; or buy/beg/borrow/steal a series 1 TiVO from somewhere (eBay all gone :(
&gt;
&gt; Mmmmmm.... Set-top Linux....
