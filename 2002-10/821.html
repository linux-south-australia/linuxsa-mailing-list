&gt; I think I need to run another identd service on the client machine behind
&gt; the gateway and forward port 113 packets?

Not all irc servers require an ident server. There are a couple of
options. Simplest is to run an ident server on the firewall. Since your
masqueraded anyway, as far as the irc server is concerned the reply is
coming from you. 

Else you could do as you say and redirect port 113 through your
firewall. Thats not too nice though, since then you are letting a port
in to your internal machine. There is also some kind of fake ident
server project ive seen on sourceforge. This one answers ident requests,
but only dishes out fake information. This is good if you just need to
get around the ident server requirement, but wish to disclose as little
info as possible. Unfortunatly I think ive seen a security vulnerability
even with this one though! It would be fixed now though.
