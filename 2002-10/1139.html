Hiya.

I 'admin' a Cobalt XTR - and I'm quite frankly sick and death of Sun's (lack of) support for these.

Everything on the box is wierdly put, and if you want to upgrade anything yourself (i.e. compile, install over), you tend to make everything on the box fall over itself.  You can, of course, disable cron jobs, disable the web interface, etc... but there's still a large amount of proprietryness that makes these things quite frankly suck (and not in a good way).

Even though these machines (i386 based) are still, I believe, the most expensive and powerful Cobalts released to date, Sun are not releasing updated daemons for it.  I've had to disable a bunch of stuff, due to security issues.

If you've got problems with the out of dateness - Sun expect you to go and buy a new server 'appliance'.  What a joke.

I'm ready to give Sun the finger completely.

Unfortunately, replacing the actual machine isn't all that easy, and its located over in the US... and I want to fsck off everything on the machine and install Debian or FreeBSD over it.  As far as I can see, the hardware inside of them is pretty standard, but actually getting something installed ON it is going to be the fun part.

There's no CD drive.  I'm guessing possibly I could throw on the debian netinstaller onto another partition (i.e. /home or something), but the cobalts dont use lilo to boot, so getting it to come up is again, another fun part.

Ack.

Anybody got any ideas?

Any ideas, no matter how silly you might think they are, are very much welcomed ;-)
