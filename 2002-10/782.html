Ant,

&gt; Yeah, I remember recommending to a friend back when the pentium came out
&gt; to get a 6x86 instead. I said "the floating point is slow, but that
&gt; doesn't matter because all the games use integer maths". Then what
&gt; happened? Everything started using floating point since it ran fine on
&gt; the pentium 1s :(

The Cyrix 6x86 got a bad reputation from gamers, many expected Pentium
performance for much less money but 3D games started to appear at that
time. In fact there are many people today who stick to Intel because of
their experience with the Cyrix 6x86 and it's PR rating. They speculate
that AMD's Athlon XP are not worth buying, when in fact today's Athlon
XP != Cyrix 6x86 in any analogous manner.

But... we're not talking about games here, for the application of a
network appliance I wonder how the VIA C3 stacks up to a modern Celeron
or Duron?

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That too -- I think they are pretty good in some aspects, but not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others... Integer performance is ok, but the cache and floating point
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is crap. Estimates vary from VIA saying that it's a little faster
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (which I'm sure it is on the particular test they run), to people
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; saying they are about 1/2 speed...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, the fast integer, crap floating point drama. Don't you love it...we
&gt; &gt; &gt; need a trusted authority to actually measure the speed of various CPU's.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember reading a whitepaper from AMD complaining that "raw Mhz"
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't mean a thing in the real world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But how would you measure it? Comparisons of CPU speed often depend
&gt; &gt; more on compiler technology and hardware optimisations than on the CPU
&gt; &gt; itself. Also, it may well be a fact that you only need integer
&gt; &gt; operations -- most compiling and networking is nothing but integer
&gt; &gt; work, and any floating point capacity is wasted (literally -- the
&gt; &gt; circutry sits there and does nothing, it doesn't get used for integer
&gt; &gt; work)...
