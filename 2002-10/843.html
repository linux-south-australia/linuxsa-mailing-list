&gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why don't you all
&gt; have ADSL?

I make no comment about download caps.  I made a comment about consumers
thinking that web viewing didn't contribute towards their usage.

As someone who has operated an ISP, and therefore has had to pay by
the byte, I see nothing wrong with also expecting consumers to pay by
the byte.  But consumers like the predictability of fixed bills, which
I can understand because I like that, too, hence it's become normal to
have fixed-price plans.  How does a sensible business protect themself
against financial ruin when they have to purchase by the byte but resell
at a fixed cost?  Obvious: cap the consumers' usage.

In point of fact, Telstra does not in any way cap consumers usage.  You
may download as much as you can grab.  What they do is offer bundled data
with your monthly access fee.  When you've used the bundled data you've
used it up, and any additional use is charged at the underlying rate for
the plan.  They offer different plans with different rates, and if you
think the amount of bundled data you're purchasing is not enough then
change to a plan that more suits your needs.

I know it sounds harsh, Ian, so let me put it this way: I'd like to put
one of my servers into your house, on your ADSL.  You probably pay $40 per
month for ADSL, so I'll give you $20 per month for all I can eat.  Okay?
