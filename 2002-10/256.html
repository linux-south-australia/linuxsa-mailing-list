That's not at all what I was saying, so it seems something got lost in the
translation. Oops.

It is becoming quite common for one member of a development team to be
paid and none of the others. Often its not even the principal developer
who is paid. And this very rarely causes problems that I've seen. There
are also quite a few projects where lead developers were employed to code
during the dot-com days and are now back to doing it as a hobby.

I also wonder if some people might be confusing struggling companies with
struggling individuals, when it comes to distributions. The individuals
employed by the distributions are certainly not underpaid just because
they work for a free software company trying hard to make a profit. So I
wonder a bit at the suggestions of donating back to the distribution
companies directly, given that people seem to want to make a direct
difference to where the work gets done.
