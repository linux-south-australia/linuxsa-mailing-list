You get what you pay for.

I went for a cheap ISP which I am still trying to shake off - it's just a
nightmare when you want support and they just can't be bothered (cheap
ISP's) - sits there for months - receive bulk propaganda responses (we are
committed to excellence blah blah blah) and still nothing gets fixed.

This is not a plug for Internode - although I must say this is why I chose
to pay $20 / month or whatever for Internode because I have heard their
service is good and they don't just spin hot air marketing propaganda when a
customer has a problem - like - they actually fix it or at least do their
best.

You'll probably end up dealing with a mouse-monkey help desk that is just
there to recite poetic marketing propaganda and ditch them anyway.

I've had it up to the hilt with really poor service from companies so I
don't mind paying the bit extra any more for a decent service.
