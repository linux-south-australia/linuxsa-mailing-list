[<A HREF="mailto:ant@foghorn">ant@foghorn</A> ant]$ uptime
  4:11pm  up 360 days,  9:18,  1 user,  load average: 0.30, 0.16, 0.16

This guy gets overloaded from time to time, but thats usually mail
related and sendmail stops accepting connections untill it catches up
then it continues on its merry way. 

I'd have to agree with the others. Power outages longer than a few
minuites (we have an ups, but its not that big and on a whole rack).
Also, kernel upgrades. This is usually because we want to use a lesser
common feature that wasnt compiled in to the kernel (like QOS etc)...

Ant

PS... yes I know about that internode server that has over 1000 days
uptime, lets not go down that thread again :) Just give me 5 days, I'll
throw a 1 year birthday party and that'll be it.

&gt; Hello all,

&gt; I would like to know what most often causes your LINUX (i don't car about NT
&gt; or other) servers to go down. Is it over load (of whatever it is doing),
&gt; directly user related errors or perhaps software bugs/viruses? 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't mean to go too specific but just something general. Ta muchly.
