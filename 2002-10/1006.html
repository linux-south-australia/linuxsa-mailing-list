To SYN scans.  There are other scans that can still provoke responses.

Quite often, I find that firewalls that drop packets (in either direction)
make diagnosing network problems harder.  I had a problem with fetchmail
out at a client, where someone else had set the firewall to drop what was
once a working connection, and fetchmail would hang for a couple of minutes
before timing out[1].  It would have been nice for fetchmail to receive an
immediate reject (people who are concerned about reject packets causing
a DOS attack should bear in mind that ICMP messages are (or can be) rate
limited under Linux).

[1]  I had exactly the same problem again the other day with a Corba
     name server that someone had accidently pointed out to the 'net
     instead of pointing to the internal server.  Clients connecting
     to the server would hang for several minutes, and being Windows
     clients they were well and truly hung.  This held up a large and
     expensive development team for over a day, but it still wasn't
     thought to be a problem.
