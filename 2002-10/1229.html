&gt; Provided you're not disclosing some AARNet-internal secret, what do you 
&gt; use to collect, sort and report on that sort of data?

SNMP client on every machine, Nagios (was NetSaint) to notice
the outages, a requirement on staff that each outage be
acknowleged, and a set of standardised acknowledgement texts.

There's a Nagios plugin to test every service (SMTP, etc
come with Nagios, we add tests that the traffic accounting
system works, BGP works, etc).

Not rocket science.

We also use MRTG to collect baseline stats for capacity
planning and fault finding.  We collect a *lot* of stuff.
 From memory for the Linux boxes it is stuff like:
CPU, run queue lengths, disk space, disk I/O bandwidth
utilisation, TCP connections, top 10 processes, most
recently started processes, voltages and temperatures,
CPU sleep states, cover off state, interface states,
packet counts, error counts.

Depending upon the application we also collect BGP
neighbour state, BGP routing table sizes, MPLS tunnel
states, RSVP reserved bandwidths.

It's surprising just how useful the baseline stats are
when things go wrong and you need to decide what to
do next.

For example, we've currently got a switch that reboots,
apparently randomly.  By looking at the stats (add adding
some more) we've been able to tell that the switch has
an internal 4MB packet buffer and drops the highest-numbered
MAC addresses from this buffer when it fills.  The result
being that when you overload the switch OSPF Hello packets
are the first packets dropped.  We're applying the LART
to that manufacturer.

We put a lot of effort and time into monitoring the
network and making it managable.  For example, every
PoP has a Linux machine responsible for monitoring
that PoP.  Unlike your average ISP we need to do this:
our mission is advanced Internet services so we are
always running gear that isn't entirely production
quality.

Note that Nagios and MRTG aren't the best possible
tools, by a long way.  But we're very much of the
view that stats collection should happen today, not
when the perfect tool appears.  The Open Source
nature of the tools is essential -- for example, we've
extended MRTG to be able to count the number of rows
of a table, as it's often the size of something
rather than its contents that is of interest.

The lesson for us has been that *every* time we have
added new collections to the stats system we have
learned important things.  For example, we have
recently added statistics of TCP dynamics and found
that the Randon Early Drop parameters on our network,
which were the manufacturer's default, halved
throughput on low-capacity links compared to what
was possible with some tuning.  That is, we got
an effective capacity doubling of small links for
very little expenditure.
