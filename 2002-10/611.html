Hi Ryan,
I had the same problem with my SuSE 7.3 and 8.0 setup up.
I use the same CPU, motherboard and video card as you, just less HDD's :)
All I had to do was drop an entry into the 'append' line of  /etc/lilo.conf

append=disableapic
or  if that doesn't work try
append=noapic

I suppose I should recompile my kernel to disable APIC that way, but 
this is a quick and eaasy work around. I was having lockups every day or 
two, but since disableing apic I've had none for nearly 12 months.


Cheers,
DBC

&gt;Having some wierd, wierd problems with my machine.
&gt;
&gt;Debian 3.0 installation, 2.4.19, latest everything in unstable, with the nvidia stuff from apt-get.  Everything works as it should, except for the fact that the machine completely locks for no apparent reason.  I see nothing helpful in logs.
&gt;
&gt;System is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;AMD Athlon 1.4ghz
&gt;ASUS A7V133A board (VIA KT133a chipset, off memory)
&gt;1gig PC133 SDRAM
&gt;ASUS Deluxe Geforce 2 GTS card
&gt;4xIBM 7200rpm 40gig drives, hanging off the motherboard's promise controller
&gt;Soundblaster Live!.
&gt;
&gt;One thing I've noticed that almost always makes the machine lock up is if I drag a box on the desktop when nautilus2 is managing it (gnome2 virtual package from debian's experimental).
&gt;
&gt;I've tried a bunch of things to resolve this - including the "mem=nopentium" in lilo, and using nvidia's AGP stuff instead of the kernel's (Option "NvAGP" "1" in XF86Config-4, and making sure AGPGART isn't compiled into the kernel) but I still get the freezing.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;xf
&gt;
&gt;(FYI, the installation's been ghosted off my other Linux box, which runs the nvidia stuff no problems at all.  However, its a Pentium III, TNT2, VIA chipset.  I run X for weeks on end with no troubles.)
