&gt; great - and we all love to trash members of lesser species - but if we think
&gt; about it for a moment - I don't recall *one* person from David's BBQ that

&gt; all other consumers - but in person we are just like everyone else.
&gt; 
&gt; I was the only person there who is actually getting ADSL - I am the only
&gt; person that thinks the status quo sucks here - but not one person justifying
&gt; the status quo (who is subject to it - not the ones getting deals through
&gt; their employer or otherwise) is planning on getting ADSL.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is nothing wrong with download caps - then why don't you all have
&gt; ADSL?

Ian,
	I don't get the impression that anyone is defending the caps, they are 
simply saying "caveat emptor". They feel the deal is not good enough - 
so they don't puchase it, they feel the same as you do about the caps - 
the difference being that you are still using the service that you are 
dissatisfied with.

IMO, anyone who has the necessary information easily available to them 
is quite welcome to compain about the situation, but they are not 
welcome to claim they were hoodwinked. If they agree to something they 
don't understand, then that is their own problem, (provided the 
information hasn't been disguised / hidden / etc.)

The only people who have been treated unfairly in this situation are 
people who bought unlimited access and subsequently had that downgraded. 
And even in this situation, if they were released from their contract at 
this point then then ok (I am not sure if this is the case with the 
telstra deal though)
