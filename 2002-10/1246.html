I think this should be categorised.  I Perl script on Freshmeat to print
'hello world' in weird and wonderful ways is still an 'application'.

Perhaps this should include a category just for applications that are
regarded as 'applications' in the traditional sense - full blown projects or
applications like office and development applications.

I don't think fly-by-night GPL scripts on Freshmeat should be included in
any count to be presented to the non-Linux public.

It could also be misleading where 10 front ends exist for say 'cdrecord'
although it is arguable that this does not constitute 10 wholly seperate
'applications'.

I just think it would be easy to say 'yeah Linux has 10 million
applications' without really meaning anything.

&gt; Subject: Re: How many Unix applications are there?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Quoting Dan Shearer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dan@tellurian.com.au">dan@tellurian.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a reasonably credible number for how many Unix
&gt; &gt; applications exist? Some notion of what an application is 
&gt; would be useful
&gt; &gt; too. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Freshmeat is one starting point, and has 25k projects of 
&gt; all sorts (which
&gt; &gt; includes GPL Windows programs and all sorts of non-Unix 
&gt; stuff.) CPAN has a
&gt; &gt; huge number of modules (anyone ever counted? And when is a module an
&gt; &gt; application?) There's several overlapping collections of Linux
&gt; &gt; applications, which by and large are also Unix 
&gt; applications. Some of these
&gt; &gt; have stats pages, some don't. There are some Sun 
&gt; application databases.
&gt; &gt; Etc etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, anyone tried doing this before, or seen a URL where someone else
&gt; &gt; already has?
&gt; 
&gt; As a rough order of magnitude, the combination of sf.net, 
&gt; savannah.gnu.org and 
&gt; freshmeat.net is probably a very good start.  Sure there's 
&gt; some (significant?) 
&gt; overlap, but there's plenty also not covered by these 3 sites 
&gt; - probably evens 
&gt; itself out in the end.
&gt; 
&gt; You could also throw in KDE, GNOME, tigris.org, etc etc etc 
&gt; but really these 
&gt; are down in the noise.  Including CPAN and the "Valuts of 
&gt; Parnassus" is 
&gt; probably making life difficult for your definition of an 
&gt; "application".  How 
&gt; about generic C programs that will compile anywhere?  Does 
&gt; "CLIPS" count as a 
&gt; unix application?  What about "Film GIMP"?  Is that a 
&gt; separate application 
&gt; to "GIMP"?  How about the billion TCL/ksh/sh/awk/sed scripts 
&gt; out there?  Good 
&gt; luck with your definition of "application"! :P
&gt; 
&gt; What about licensing?  Are you are talking about just 
&gt; oss/fs/pd unix-ish 
&gt; applications and not proprietry licensed ones?  Shareware?  
&gt; Is M$ Windows a 
&gt; unix application because I can get the source code (shared 
&gt; source licence etc) 
&gt; and compile it up under unix?
&gt; 
&gt; Unforunately I don't know of a centralised repository or 
&gt; directory that is 
&gt; broader in scope than freshmeat.net
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't helped with this email, right?
