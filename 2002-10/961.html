yeah that's what I am getting.  Like I said - I think Internode are doing a
great job - my calculations show their margins would be very small - so it
appears Internode are being quite generous considering the provision costs
involved.  I also read part of their submission to the broadband inquiry
which helped me understand their position a lot more.

Of course it would be nice if I didn't have to pay $135 / month for the
privilege - but I dare say that has little to do with Internode.

Of course 20GB caps would be wonderful but I won't hold my breath.

If one goes to the BBC and ABC news sites and if one is in to news and
current affairs - they will immediately find a good use for bandwidth.  The
journalistic quality that one can get from overseas sites is great - and the
fact that one no longer is subject to the national censorship or culture
that filters what one sees on the news.  ADSL / broadband has fantastic
potential in this area.

&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have calculated that 8Gb would provide an hour or two of average
&gt; &gt; quality media a night which should be sufficient.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't understand.  I thought you were upset about caps, not about
&gt; the size of the cap.  Internode *do* have a plan with 8GB of data.
&gt; You need to change to PADSL-256-Purple.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; David
