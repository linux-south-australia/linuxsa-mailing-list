&gt; Here we have super flash bang sales people teling me to buy the latest
&gt; greatest phone with "absolutely fabulous" games that will make my life
&gt; "so much better".


Which is clearly marketeer's drivel, but...

&gt;  When in fact the current crop of phone games are no
&gt; better than games that are 20 years old.


... the games *do* run on a device which fits on the palm of your hand, 
which also lets you communicate in near-realtime with someone almost 
anywhere on the planet, and lasts for at least a week between needing to 
be connected to a wall outlet. I think that is pretty cool.. :)

And remember, the gaming industry industry had a huge role on in pushing 
the envelope for desktop hardware. Game requirments drive hardware 
developers to create faster, more powerful everythings (CPU's, memory, 
GFX cards, networking equipment, etc, etc).

One can only hope that the gaming industry on phones will have the same 
effect. Maybe games will be responsible for driving the demand up for 
GPRS and G3-like services enough that high-speed Internet access from 
your phone might one day become affordable. That would be great!
