* 1. Dan Shearer is presenting: "Maintaining OSs, A Quick Overview of 
Confusion"
   
Some computing fields have well-understood and standard answers.
Some don't, and operating system maintenance and distribution is an
example. The talk covers the major models developed to date and in use
today, including:

	- scope of the problem
	- list of solutions
	- examples of distribution problems solved badly
	- source vs binary distribution
	- factors such as compatibility, simplicity, security, *ity
	- the problems of scaling
	- the problems of defining assumptions


Dan Shearer is Open Source Manager at Tellurian, a software developer and
integrator in Adelaide. Dan has been participating in free software for 14
years, and is particularly interested in changing the way heterogeneous
computing environments are implemented. Tellurian's development efforts in
large-scale and cross-platform system integration span diverse fields 
including
telecommunications, robotics, user interfaces, machine vision and code
portability toolkits, and increasingly involve Open Source components.

* 2. Installfest 2002 Unplugged: How AUUG is helping

A brief discussion about what is happening at this years Installfest 
will be given
and registration of helpers and installees will also be taken. Anyone 
wishing to give
