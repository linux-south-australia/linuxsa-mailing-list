&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My misnomer about Linux and Free Unix (xBSD) is quite obviously
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that many of its users can write well with good grammar and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; impeccable spelling. I know -- I should get over it -- but then
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; again I do actually care about the open source community and it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be nice if we portrayed ourselves using standard spelling
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and standard grammar.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And note the two letter As in grammar ;-P
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I thunk ya missed yerrr S in 'letter' laddy!
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Steve,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Line 3, second sentence.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Steve only wrote one sentence.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please revise your use of hyphens.  A full stop or comma would have
&gt;&gt;&gt; been sufficient.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Are you talking of the second sentence at the (unattributed) third
&gt;&gt; level of indentation (which I think was David Lloyd)?  Those aren't
&gt;&gt; hyphens, they're dashes, also called em rules or (in American) em
&gt;&gt; dashes.  In print they're a continuous horizontal line the width of
&gt;&gt; the letter m (thus the name).  In ASCII they're represented by two
&gt;&gt; 0x2d (-) characters.  They're used to indicate an abrupt change in the
&gt;&gt; structure of a sentence.  It's not clear whether that is the case
&gt;&gt; here: it looks more like the dashes are superfluous.  It is clear that
&gt;&gt; they are surrounded by white space, which is incorrect.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; See the Commonwealth Department of Finance and Administration
&gt;&gt; Style Manual, 5th edition, sections 6.88 and on, and the Chicago
&gt;&gt; Manual of Style, 14th edition, sections 5.105 and on.
&gt;
&gt; My apologies for the incorrect email format.  I will familiarise
&gt; myself with the links provided below, thank you.
&gt;
&gt; The open source community should immediately initiate a project
&gt; within the Linux Standards Base on the correct usage and description
&gt; of the 0x2d.  As ASCII is the only universally understood language
&gt; in the world today - I suggest the sentence should be revised to
&gt;
&gt; "0x2d 0x2d I should get over it 0x2d 0x2d".

No, you're missing two points here:

1.  There should be no spaces round the dash:

    "0x2d0x2dI should get over it0x2d0x2d".

2.  That's the hex representation.  If that's what you want, you
    should write:

    "0x2d0x2d49200x730x680x6f0x750x6c0x640x200x670x650x740x200x6f0x760x650x720x200x690x740x2d0x2d".

3.  This is unnecessarily clumsy, though.  In such a case, you don't
    need the 0x:

    "2d2d492073686f756c6420676574206f7665722069742d2d".

4.  This is still unnecessarily verbose, since all the characters are
    printable.  Instead, I'd be inclined to include them directly,
    rather than their hex representations:

    "--I should get over it--".
