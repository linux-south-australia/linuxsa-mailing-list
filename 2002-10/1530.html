Ok, I am trying to customize Novel's setup script for Lindows.   Novel 
is a Netware client for Linux, and the project is hosted by sourceforge.net.

I am also trying to earn some programming skills with elbow grease.  I 
figure that bash shell scripting may be a good warm up before I attempt 
to take on Perl.


Anyway, I am just starting to get my feet wet, learning as I try to add 
features.

Comments & suggestions appreciated.

Stuff I don't know.....

Lindows is Debian based, so the following command, which is designed to 
check to see if ncpfs is installed, fails on Debian.

&gt; echo -n "Checking for ncpfs... "
&gt; if [ "`rpm -qa | grep ncpfs | wc -l`" -gt "0" ]; then :
&gt;     echo "installed"
&gt;     echo "ncpfs package is installed" &gt;&gt; setup.log


I am assuming that this command works on Red Hat systems, but I am 
wondering how to get it to scale between Red Hat and Debian.

Here is the rest of what I am trying to do:

Set a string to not assume that the client will be using eth0:

&gt; # User must identify his Unix Ethernet Card Number.
&gt; echo -en "\nWhat is the Unix device number of your ethernet card? 
&gt; (Default=eth0)[eth0/eth1/eth2/eth3]"
&gt;     read eth


apt-get ncpfs if not installed.

&gt;
&gt; # ncpfs package must be installed.
&gt; echo -en "\nDo you wish to apt-get ncpfs?[y/n]: "
&gt;     read YN
&gt; if [ $YN = "y" -o $YN = "Y" ]
&gt; then
&gt;         apt-get install ncpfs
&gt;     fi


If I have lynx installed, it will download ncpfs  if this command is ran:

lynx 
<A HREF="ftp://speakeasy.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/8.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/ncpfs-2.2.0.18-11.i386.rpm">ftp://speakeasy.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/8.0/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/ncpfs-2.2.0.18-11.i386.rpm</A> 


I could download mars-nwe and ipxutils the same way.

The next line would include ---&gt; rpm -i.....


apt-get IPX if not installed

Note that I gave up on trying to use grep. I thought of using ---&gt; which 
IPX_CONFIGURE

&gt;
&gt; # ipx needs to be installed.
&gt;     echo -e "\nipx must be installed if you wish to mount volumes"
&gt;     echo "on Netware 3.x and 4.x servers or do not have IP bound"
&gt;     echo "on your Netware 5 or above servers."
&gt;     echo -en "\nDo you wish to apt-get ipx?[y/n]: "
&gt;     read YN
&gt;     if [ $YN = "y" -o $YN = "Y" ]
&gt;     then
&gt;         apt-get install ipx
&gt;         IPX="True"
&gt;     fi


I  don't seem to be able to apt-get Mars-nwe. However, I found a .deb 
package available for download and
I figured if I could get Lynx to magically download the mars.deb file, 
it would be just as good. No luck  here, but lynx will automagically 
download RPM's from <A HREF="ftp://speakeasy.rpmfind.">ftp://speakeasy.rpmfind.</A> net

&gt;
&gt; # mars-nwe needs to be installed
&gt;     echo "You will need to download Mars-NWE"
&gt;     echo "via Lynx which we will apt-get."
&gt;     echo "Don't worry if Lynx is already installed,"
&gt;     echo "apt-get can detect this and won't break anything"
&gt;     echo "after Lynx installs, a dialogue box will come up."
&gt;     echo "At this point you are using lynx. Of the packages"
&gt;     echo "listed, please select mars-nwe_0.99.p120-0_i386.deb"
&gt;     echo "when it asks you if you would like to install, say yes"
&gt;     echo -en "\n Do you want to continue?[y/n]: "
&gt;     read YN
&gt;     if [ $YN = "y" -o $YN = "Y" ]
&gt;     then
&gt;         apt-get install lynx
&gt;     lynx <A HREF="http://people.debian.org/~pm/pool/main/mars-nwe">http://people.debian.org/~pm/pool/main/mars-nwe</A>
&gt;     fi

A few people don't install all of the protocols available to netware, so 
I figured I would let them use something other than 802.2.

For the client to work, Mars has to start up and the ipx_interface 
command has to be issued before the user logs in
So I want to grab the string and incorporate it into it into the whole 
command written in rc.local.

Again, there is another scalability issue, as (I think) rc.local has to 
be made in a Debian system, while Red Hat ships with it.

&gt; if [ "$IPX" = "True" ]; then
&gt;     echo -e "\n"
&gt;     echo "============================================"
&gt;     echo "   Binding IPX to your network interface"
&gt;     echo "============================================"
&gt;     echo
&gt;     echo "You need to bind IPX if your servers are not setup to use 
&gt; native IP."
&gt;     echo "We will also have to create an /etc/init.d/rc.local file"
&gt;     echo "The command will be something like: ipx_interface add -p 
&gt; eth0 802.2"
&gt;     echo "depending on which nic you want to bind and which frametype is"
&gt;     echo "in use in your environment. See the man page for more info."
&gt;     echo -en "\nWhich Frametype Would You Like to use? (802.2 is 
&gt; default) [802.2/EtherII/802.3/SNAP]: "
&gt;     read frame
&gt;     echo -e "\nadding ipx interface, frametype $frame:" &gt;&gt; setup.log
&gt;     ipx_interface delall 2&gt;&gt; setup.log
&gt;     ipx_interface add -p $eth $frame 2&gt;&gt; setup.log
&gt;       echo -en "Create the /etc/init.d/rc.local file? and add the 
&gt; commands? [y/n]: "
&gt;         read YN
&gt;     if [ $YN = "y" -o $YN = "Y" ]
&gt;         then
&gt;         touch /etc/init.d/rc.local
&gt;         chmod 775 /etc/init.d/rc.local
&gt;         update-rc.d rc.local start 99 2 3 4 5 .
&gt;              echo "ipx_interface delall" &gt;&gt; /etc/init.d/rc.local
&gt;             echo "ipx_interface delall" &gt;&gt; setup.log
&gt;             echo "ipx_interface add -p $eth $frame" &gt;&gt; 
&gt; /etc/initd.d/rc.local
&gt;             echo "ipx_interface add -p $eth $frame" &gt;&gt; setup.log
&gt;     fi
