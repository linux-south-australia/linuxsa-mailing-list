&gt; My computer has a Pentium 233 MMX and a J-TX98B motherboard. 
&gt; I can load RedHat 7.0 without any problems, Mandrake 7.2 will load sometimes, 
&gt; but I can't get any 2.4 kernel distros to load. 
&gt; Is this a problem with the processor or should I look elsewhere? 

You should be a little specific about "load".  If you take it to mean
install then look at the install logs (Alt-F1, Alt-F2, etc under most of
the installers to show different screens with information).  If you take
it to mean boot, maybe you should try booting to single user mode and
looking at the kernel log (dmesg).  It's hard to diagnose the problem
when we don't know exactly what it is.

It sounds like maybe you have a dodgy processor or mainboard.  I was
running RH7.1 and, more recently, 7.3 on my P233 MMX until I had a need
to install Windows2000 on it (long and painful story that's almost bad
enough to make me cry).  All the RedHat 7.x series is kernel 2.4 isn't
it?

I can't offer any suggestions except that maybe you stick with a distro
that does work and upgrade it online with something like up2date, red
carpet, "apt-get upgrade", etc.

&gt; ps. sorry about the HTML but it seems my ISP dosn't support plain text

HTML? The post looks plain text to me.

Cheers,
Adam
