Yes. You should do one of the above, or perhaps something in the middle :-)

Like any platform, the hardware needs to match the expected load. If you're
serving your data out over a 33.6k modem connection, a 486 may be more than
enough. Here's a list of variable factors you may want to take into account:

  * number of expected concurrent users
  * static vs. dynamic content (there's always a little extra CPU required
	for dynamic content on most platforms)
  * Bandwidth
  * Traffic likely to be a steady stream, or come in bursts?

&gt; 2. What main board would people find they have least hassles with for a
&gt; Intel solution

I've never bothered much about brand names myself. Others will disagree.

&gt; 3. Red Hat 8 seems to be much better for desktop use, Would it also be
&gt; better as a server than say Red hat 7.3

One advantage is that there have been a number of security updates to RedHat
7.3 since it's release. If you install RedHat 8.0, those will have been
incorporated into the release. It won't stop you from having to install any
updates that come out in the future, but at least it makes your job a little
easier in the short term. Some like to install the latest and greatest,
whereas others are a little more cautious.

Quite often, people (me) tend to install the bare minimum necessary for the
machine to function in it's intended role. The differences between two
versions of the same distribution become less obvious.

Hope it helps,
Matt
