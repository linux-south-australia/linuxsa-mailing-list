I suggest that I run a raffle at the next LinuxSA meeting.

Tickets are $2 each or two for $3 with two prizes:

 - First Prize: 30% of the takings, up to $300
 - Second Prize: 10% of the takings, up to $199

I don't *think* we'd raise more than $1500 however if I were to give
away a prize more than $500 I'd have to register as a lottery.

Now given that we have about 30 people at each meeting, let's say that
70% buy a single ticket and 30% buy two tickets:

21 x 2 = 42
 9 x 3 = 18
         --
         60

Making the first prize worth $18 and the second prize $6. This would
leave $36 as a donation. Continue this for twelve months and we would
have raised $432...

I suggest that we develop a list of appropriate people or organisations
to donate to and that as part of the winner's takings the winner gets to
choose which one gets the rest of the pot.
