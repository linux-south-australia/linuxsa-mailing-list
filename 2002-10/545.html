&gt; I asked my supplier and they said that Fujitsu produced a bad

This is probably accurate -- I had at least six 20Gb Fujitsu disks die
on me in various systems over the last 12 months.

I also had one near-death similar to yours, Damien, and it was a Fujitsu
20Gb -- luckily it was only my Windows drive.  The disk would freeze up
frequently, and because of the lack of information Windows gives me, the
only symptoms I saw were that the system had locked up, and the hard
drive light was permanently on.  I believe the hard drive was making
some sort of noise aswell from memory.

After a minute or so, the disk would appear to go back to normal.  This
was happening extremely frequently so I replaced the drive immediately
(and took the opportunity to upgrade :)).  Sometimes it was just too
much, and I had to reboot the system because it started taking too long
to recover.

In my position it was reasonably easy to send back dead Fujitsu hard
drives after that point because I'd had so many it just seemed like bad
luck, and I'm sure that wholesaler had more than just a few busted ones.


Damien -- Which brand was your hard drive?
