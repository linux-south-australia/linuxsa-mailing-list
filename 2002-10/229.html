We *definitely* do not want to formalise this - then it will just become a
bunch of meetings and documents that fail to actually achieve anything IMHO

Local contributions is a great idea - do Mandrake / Red Hat have groups in
Australia that could benefit?

It's also a good idea because our farm / mining based economy has trashed
our dollar and has rendered our currency about as valued or respected as a
certain software vendor's promises of stability and security..

At least if we keep it in the country - what little we raise will still be
worth something - which it won't be the moment it leaves our shores - plus
it is nice to keep money in the country - especially today when all we
export is what we can find in the ground (maybe we can change that by
contributing to our local IT development).

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Sending money to doubtless very worthy causes is one way of 
&gt; doing things.
&gt; Nearly all the causes I have seen mentioned are overseas ones. And yet
&gt; Australia has an extraordinarily rich collection of core 
&gt; developers and
&gt; fringe adder-oners, people the distribution makers cannot do without.
&gt; Perhaps the same ends could be served by moving the cash 
&gt; around locally? I
&gt; suspect it would have very much greater impact.
&gt; 
&gt; There are dozens and dozens of people churning out code around the
&gt; country, even a good few in Adelaide. Don't underestimate the
&gt; encouragement value of chunk of cash sufficient to buy a new microwave
&gt; oven or bicyle or something. I've known this sort of a 
&gt; donation to keep
&gt; interest up in open source projects which have made a big 
&gt; difference. (No
&gt; details avail.)
&gt; 
&gt; Allocating donations is very hard when it gets more 
&gt; formalised because of
&gt; the amorphous nature of open source. I learnt that many years 
&gt; ago when (as
&gt; an external consultant) I wrote the documentation surrounding 
&gt; the Linux
&gt; International Development Grant Fund and watched it in action 
&gt; for a while.
&gt; There were some guidelines, but it all got pretty torturous 
&gt; and although
&gt; they did some good things LI ended up winding down the scheme 
&gt; because of
&gt; the difficulties it faced in its then-form.
