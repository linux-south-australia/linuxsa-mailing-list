&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When non-Internet people think of downloading, they think 
&gt; of clicking 
&gt; &gt; the "Download" link and pulling down a file. They /don't/ 
&gt; think of how much 
&gt; &gt; browsing is costing them, or what the gazillion spyware 
&gt; programs on their PC 
&gt; &gt; are doing, or of how much porn their husband is watching. 
&gt; Is real-time 
&gt; &gt; streaming downloading? How about online shopping?
&gt; 
&gt; But don't all ISPs have a usage meter for your account and/or 
&gt; some sort
&gt; of arrangement to tell you when you're getting near your limit for the
&gt; month?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This sort of think isn't immediately obvious to people who 
&gt; don't understand the 
&gt; &gt; underlying protocols.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now, the ISP isn't being deliberately misleading, but the 
&gt; user isn't "stupid" 
&gt; &gt; either.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "3000 megabytes of inbound data a month!" doesn't mean very 
&gt; much to most users, 
&gt; &gt; which makes an ISP's job significantly more difficult when 
&gt; preparing 
&gt; &gt; advertising.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the average schmuck should do some research before they sign the
&gt; contract!  Computers/Internet are not for the uneducated.  If 
&gt; you don't
&gt; understand (at least a little) how it actually works you shouldn't be
&gt; using it.
&gt; 
&gt; If they get stung for excess usage then its their own fault for not
&gt; looking into what usage is.  We all know what 3G/mo downloads 
&gt; is, and as
&gt; someone already said, that could mean what happens when you select
&gt; "download" in Internet Exploiter (if you don't know jack!).  If you're
&gt; using the net and haven't bothered to find out at least the 
&gt; very basics
&gt; of its functionality then you deserve to be burned with an 
&gt; excess usage
&gt; fee.
&gt; 
&gt; As DSL (???) said earlier, why should people be protected 
&gt; from their own
&gt; stupidity.  Stupidity is probably too harsh a word (but 
&gt; applies in most
&gt; cases) when a lot of people are simply naive/ignorant.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well, that's my grunt about it. I always get annoyed when the
&gt; stupid/naive/ignorant (choose your own adjective out of those) want to
&gt; be compensated for their stupidity in some way!  I wish 
&gt; they'd just make
&gt; some effort to learn something about the things they're trying to do!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
