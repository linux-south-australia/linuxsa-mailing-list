hey maybe a few of us can get together one weekend - I can get some old
hardware to hobble together and we can make a project of it.  I would like
to have something set up in the back yard by January if possible so I can
show it off at BBQ's..

Quoting Michael Gratton &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@vee.net">mike@vee.net</A>&gt;:
&gt; I'd want to do a few more things, such as running esd on it and so on - 
&gt; in fact that may be the first step. I could hit the remote esd instance 
&gt; from my notebook instead of the local one when playing music, so the 
&gt; music actually gets played through the stereo instead of my notebook's 
&gt; tinny speakers. Storage for the oggs themselves will probably be on a 
&gt; separate machine in the end, as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, for me, a requirement would be having a device near the stereo to 
&gt; play the music. This would run the decoder with playlist, a 
&gt; network-accessable esd instance and a web application server. I want it 
&gt; close to the stereo to minimise the length of the RCA run - less 
&gt; interference and less cable snaking all over the house. Another req 
&gt; would be to have a UI close to the stereo as well. This just needs to be 
&gt; a web browser and a pointing device (a touch screen would work well, as 
&gt; was pointed out to me off-list), and needs to be close becuase most 
&gt; people will head over to to the stereo when they want to listen to some 
&gt; music.
&gt; 
&gt; So I may as well combine the two devices into the one machine. I'd like 
&gt; to netboot it so it can be diskless, but I don't know if that is 
&gt; possible with a mac. I'd also like to use it for automatically ripping 
&gt; and encoding new CDs. So for me, having an iMac sitting on top of the 
&gt; stereo is pretty useful.

Hmmm, perhaps you should look at

or buy/beg/borrow/steal a series 1 TiVO from somewhere (eBay all gone :(

Mmmmmm.... Set-top Linux....
