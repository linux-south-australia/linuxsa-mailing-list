Andrew,

&gt;    Basically what is happening is that the Windoze side
&gt; works fine (ie. mail, surfing etc.), but when I dual boot
&gt; into Linux, routing is working (I can ping IP addresses),
&gt; but DNS lookups are not (I cannot ping domain names, or surf
&gt; or nslookup etc).

The fact that Windows works is a fair indication it is not a
hardware-level problem.

&gt;    I have checked my /etc/resolve.conf file and it has the
&gt; name servers correctly. I have checked /etc/hosts,
&gt; /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny and they are set up
&gt; properly. Routing is working properly and route -n returns
&gt; the correct gateway information. The gateway server is set
&gt; up correctly to let requests through from this machine (well
&gt; it works for windoze and has worked for Linux using the same
&gt; IP addresses before).  The machine in question has an IP
&gt; allocated to this network and Telstra DNS "knows" about this
&gt; machine.

Do you get a specific error message when you can't access any machine by
domain name?

&gt;    From the similar discussion on the "Internet access"
&gt; thread, I have turned off iptables (the gateway firewall is
&gt; keeping people out that need to be at present). I have set
&gt; up ipchains on the dual boot machine just in case. shorewall
&gt; is not installed, and prelude seems to refer to the scheme
&gt; interpreter and nothing else. Now I know this is a simple
&gt; fix and I will probably say "Doh!" when I see it, but your
&gt; help would be greatly appreciated. TIA.

What output do the following give?

iptables -L
iptables -t nat -L
ipchains -L

Darryl
