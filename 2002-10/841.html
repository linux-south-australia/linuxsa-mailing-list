Quoting <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>:

&gt; &gt; When non-Internet people think of downloading, they think of clicking 
&gt; &gt; the "Download" link and pulling down a file. They /don't/ think of how much
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; browsing is costing them, or what the gazillion spyware programs on their
&gt; PC
&gt; 
&gt; Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to define what download is
&gt; reasonably well and not in small print.

Yes, but nobody reads the small print. Also, it might make perfect sense to 
you, but that's no guarantee that Joe Blow will understand it.

The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement when they 
mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before, it's unfortunate 
that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term for this.

&gt; &gt; Now, the ISP isn't being deliberately misleading, but the user isn't
&gt; "stupid"
&gt; &gt; either.
&gt; 
&gt; I take your point, but to it still doesn't put them in the best position. 
&gt; Simply because one is ignorant doesn't justify what one does.

True, but an ISP shouldn't exploit the fact that nobody reads the small print.

&gt; &gt; Because they want their Internet access and don't have personal lawyers or
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; geeks on hand.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm...so we should just sign a document because we don't have lawyers or 
&gt; experts on hand? That sounds a little irresponsible don't you think?

If I need a lawyer to purchase Internet access there's something terribly 
wrong. Hell, if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n 
Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something wrong.
