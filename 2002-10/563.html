&gt;Michael,

&gt;&gt;When it comes to building a server I would not even consider ATA.  The fact that most SCSI drives come with 5yr warrenty vs 6months/1 year for OEM IDE drives.  
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I beg to differ!  You certainly can get a 1 year warranty on hard drives but 3 years is what we get on all our drives (unless we opt for 1 year - which we don't).  Most of our drives are well and truly cycled by three years.
&gt;  
&gt;
As of the 1 Oct 2002 Maxtor, Seagate and Western Digital all announced 
that they are reducing warranties on desktop models from 3 years to 12 
months.
The reason given is that Hdd reliability has improved and therefore they 
don't have to give such a long warranty. (figure that one out !!!)
If you are getting longer warranties then it isn't from the manufacture 
it's from the supplier. Better make sure the supplier is still around 
after the 12month mark or your warranty is worth nothing.

&gt;&gt;IDE utilise cpu for IO, SCSI have built on controllers, SCSI has known and grown defects lists in the firmware .. etc etc.  When it comes to protecting data and ensuring reliability, the extra money for a SCSI based system is justified IMHO.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;True - but IDE has some great RAID controllers out now too - that also work well under Linux.  We have a Promise one running Western Digital 80GB Drives with 8MB Cache on each drive that gives the Intel Lancewood with SCSI and a Mylex RAID controller a run for its money!  Personally unless you had high and constant demand I wouldn't bother, ATA does the job just as admirably.
&gt;
&gt;Having sold SCSI in large servers for years even the main distributors mention that in most cases ATA is fine, unless you need very heavy and constant demand.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If this system is going to be just for DNS, two 4.5 GB drives in RAID 1 would be more than plenty.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Absolutely!
&gt;
&gt;Another 2c worth!
