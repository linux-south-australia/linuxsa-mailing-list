now your talking!  I am going to print this out and see what my friend
thinks.  I would find it highly amusing if we already had all if not most of
the gear needed for a el cheapo irrigation system.

Naaahhh, 
Just go to a local junk yard or troll house demolitions for parts. 
Since we are talking cheap re-use of garbage or cheap buyable items, you
could try: 
For the switch, you'd put it on a long wooden/plastic board which would sit
above the line of taps.  You'd connect each slot on the switch with flexible
copper wire to a spot above each tap and to a sort of controller device
(gone blank on what they are called but they are cheap - you can buy such
items for toy train tracks at hobby stores, or hobby markets, or flea
markets) which moves a hard metal wire or even coat hanger wire (to be
cheap) attached to the individual tap (with the holes in them) and move the
taps the required degree due to the amount of voltage fed to controller
device.
The switch, cheap one from electrical superstore; the board, some old piece
of board you've got, plastic/wooden, etc.; the copper wire, often you can
get this from old electrical stuff around the house; the hard metal wire, eg
old coat hangers; the taps from junk yards or house demolition sales; the
hose, as I've said before are the cheap plastic sprinkler type ones from any
hardware/garden/Big W/discount store - maybe even reject shop, cheap as
chips or cunninghams shop; some plumbers tape to cover over the holes you
don't want to use in the hose.
Have fun, 
Dez

&gt; &gt; We are going to see how many parts we can use from hard 
&gt; &gt; refuse night scavenging missions and other spare parts to 
&gt; &gt; cobble this together to prove it can be done simply and cheaply. 
&gt; 
&gt; Are you saying you're going to steak curb-side hard refuse from the 
&gt; council?  tsk! tsk!
