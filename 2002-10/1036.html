There is an option in Outlook somewhere to set how long the mail is in the preview pain before it is marked read.
Change it to 10 minutes or something if you like.


Matthew

I'm sorry, but Microsoft's implementation of this is extermely poor. Under
Outhouse, merely moving off an email to another in the preview pane generates
a read receipt, when in fact all that I've done is move off an email that
is currently highlighted (over which I have no control, for example if I've
moved to the Inbox from another folder) to an email that I *do* intend to
read.  I'll then mark the previous email as unread (an action that requires
me to select it again), but that doesn't negate the receipt that's already
gone out.  Occasionally, I'll get a call several hours later saying "Why
haven't you actioned that email that you read", when I haven't done any
such thing.

As User Interface Metaphors go, Read Receipts are one of the crappiest.
What next, an Understanding Receipt? [1]
