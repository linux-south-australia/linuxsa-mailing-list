G'day,

I've been helping set up a Red Hat 7.3 Linux box for a 
client, and while basically things are going very well, 
there's a couple of problems (possibly related) with the 
XFree86 installation.  The 7.3 ISOs have been updated 
with recent fixes/enhancements, up to about mid-September.  

[One possibly-related glitch that has been sorted out is 
 that the language selection was "sort-of" American 
 English under XDM, but this setting was incomplete:
	- No language was highlighted in the language 
		selection menu of the XDM login panel; and 
	- Changing terminal font failed silently, leading 
		to a somewhat unimpressed client.
 Once the language was selected from the XDM menu, the 
 terminal font change worked.]

The main problem is that XFree86 will not support a larger 
screen resolution than 1600x1200, despite having a capable 
monitor (Sony CPD-G520) and a capable video card (NVidia 
TNT2 M64, 32Mb RAM).  There is an 1800x1440 mode specified 
in the configuration file, and listed as an applicable 
mode under the display's modes line, but this mode is not 
used.  There are no messages in the X startup messages to 
suggest that this mode has been rejected for any reason -- 
and in particular, it's not rejected as being outside the 
capabilities of the monitor.  Resolutions higher than 
1600x1200 are supported under Windows.  

I'm wondering if the video card memory is an issue, but 
32Mb seems to be large enough for the requirements.  I 
haven't tried 24-bit mode instead of 32-bit mode.  If this 
was an issue, however, I would expect to see a 
warning/information message in the X startup messages.  

A strange message that might be related is that X does 
complain that the font ISO8859 isn't available.  I've 
found the relevant RPMs (75dpi and 100dpi) on the CD, 
and according to rpm(1) these packages are installed.  

I've browsed the Red Hat Bugzilla site, and also the web 
a little, but haven't been able to find anything that 
really helps.  

So my questions are:
	1. Why is the 1800x1440 entry silently ignored?  
	2. What other modes larger than 1600x1200 might 
		I try?  The 1800x1440 entry was the only 
		mode larger than 1600x1440 listed in the 
		XFree86 configuration file.  
	3. How can I sort out the ISO8859 font error 
		message, and is this error related to the 
		other problems?  
	4. What's going on with the XDM language 
		selection weirdos?  

Any help in answering these questions would be greatly 
appreciated.  

cheers,

behoffski

ps. Grouse is available to take on new projects from 
January.  
