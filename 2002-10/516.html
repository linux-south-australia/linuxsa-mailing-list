I can't make any predictions...but...

I am a Lindows "Insider" and from what I understand...they use Wine. All 
of their changes have been submitted back to the tree I hear.

I don't think all the changes have been worked back into the latest 
version of Wine yet, AFAIK.

I have spent a lot of time trying out different versions of 
Wine.......Codeweavers Cross Over Office, Reg. Wine, Transgaming Wine 
and Lindows Wine...

...and all I can say is is you own all 4 versions of Wine you have a 
60-75% chance that the application you want to run will run in one of 
these wines.

But I can say from having tried all 4 Wines...that Codeweavers Crossover 
Office gives you the best shot on Office applications, Winex on games, 
except AOL5... so far Lindows autostarts CD's best and provides better 
DGA support, whatever that means...

Lindows is not done yet and there are a lot of "Insiders" that would 
like to see more support for Windows applications. If I hear a lot of 
gripes, I will try all 4 wines & post a solution if I get lucky. That's 
what happened with Macromedia Dreamweaver & Flash.

Granted, Lindows Wine is almost as good as Codeweavers Cross Over 
Office. I would also say that wine in general has made tremendous 
improvements over the last year.

Anyway that is my .0000000002 mills worth.

&gt;G'day...
&gt;
&gt;Up until today I thought Lindows sucked, now I'm possibly having second thoughts... I just had a discussion with a friend who claims that Lindows in fact doesn't use Wine (as I had always thought) - it uses some kind of kernel level emulation layer for the Windows API.  I'm guessing this is simular to how Mac OS X runs "Classic" applications - and I know this does work well.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds fscking interesting.
&gt;
&gt;I'm an Evercrackhead - the day this runs under Linux at a half acceptable speed is the day I forever dump windows.  These days I use my Linux/BSD boxen 95% more then I do my windows box - hell, my windows box even looks like unix boxen ;) 
&gt;
&gt;The chances of EQ actually working in Lindows actually sounds pretty good, so hrmm... maybe I was wrong after all... ;)
&gt;
&gt;Anybody on this list got a copy?  Wouldn't mind looking at it.
&gt;
&gt;Email me offlist.
