At the BBQ at DSL's house today a couple of people were asking about a
simple iptables firewall to do forwarding and masquing etc...

As I tend to look for the laziest ways of doing things (linux is hard
enough already isn't it?) I suggested the script I use. Here's the URL.

<A HREF="http://monmotha.mplug.org">http://monmotha.mplug.org</A>

and a reference guide for it is at....

<A HREF="http://www.mplug.org/phpwiki/index.php?MonMothaReferenceGuide">http://www.mplug.org/phpwiki/index.php?MonMothaReferenceGuide</A>

It's very simple to setup and use. Just edit a few lines at the top of
the script to set the variables like INET_IFACE and TCP_ALLOW
etc...etc.... then chmod +x it and run it. Don't be fooled by the
version numbers MonMotha uses, and his "development" code is quite
stable for home lan's and even production boxes if you want. Just get
the latest.

He even has a mailing list to answer your questions and resolve any
problems you may have, with links on his page to subscribe. Or you can
try asking him directly (when he's awake) by joining #linuxhelp on any
EFNET irc server.

It's the simplest firewall script to use that I've found. It takes me
about 3 minutes to setup and run. Then just do iptables-save or if
you're using redhat/mandrake "service iptables save" to save the
rulesets for future boots.

Feel free to email me if you have a question although I'm no firewall
wizard.

HTH someone.  :)
