&gt; Hello all,

&gt; I would like to know what most often causes your LINUX (i don't car about NT
&gt; or other) servers to go down. Is it over load (of whatever it is doing),
&gt; directly user related errors or perhaps software bugs/viruses?
&gt;
&gt; I don't mean to go too specific but just something general. Ta
&gt; muchly.

OK, I know you don't care, but I'll include BSD anyway, just in case
somebody else cares.  Like others, the main cause of my outages used
to be power failures, including brain-dead UPSs.  I now have all my
machines on UPS, and since then power hasn't been the issue.

Excluding power, over the last few years, with an average of about 10
machines running, I've had about:

1.  System compromised.  This was a Red Hat 6.2 box which I was
    testing, and I wasn't expecting a compromise.  I had been running
    BSD for years, and I've never been compromised there.  It won't
    happen to my Linux boxes any more, either.
2.  Hardware failures.  If your disk dies, the machine tends to fail.
    No obvious difference between BSD and Linux here :-)
3.  NFS hangs.  Not really a crash: typically this happens on laptops
    which have NFS mounted file systems.  I shut them down and take
    them somewhere, forgetting to unmount the NFS file systems.  At
    some point, everything starts hanging on an access to NFS.
4.  Genuine panics.  Only happen on test machines, which is to be
    expected.
5.  One production machine (satellite gateway, running RH 7.0) died on
    me last month for no apparent reason; just froze.  This is the
    only time I'd really say I've got bitten by a software bug.  In
    its favour, I had just got back from the AUUG conference, and my
    hardware obviously hates me going, because I have lots of problems
    with it during that time.
