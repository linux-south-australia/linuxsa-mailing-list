cool - so *is* it possible to mirror open and close source software
archives?  Is it storage and server infrastructure that's the issue?  I
think it is quite reasonable to be concerned over blowing a quota sky high
just through updating one's OS if this can be avoided.  Like I said - it has
nothing to do with Internode - more like the Southern Cross Cable company or
something - I don't know..

ISP's can't share or link up mirrors can they?  I agree that it does seem
like an awful amount of effort that is just duplicated across various ISPs
to set up their own individual mirrors - so perhaps this can be shared?  It
does seem like a terrible waste to have each ISP suck down 10's of gigabytes
per day just to maintain mirrors if other ISPs are doing the same thing.

Speaking of which - can ISP's also share news server to perhaps one day
allow unmetered or increased quota for these?  Once again - I see how this
can not be provided at present if each ISP sucks down many gigabytes per day
just to maintain the news servers.

I also think that now that I have signed up for ADSL - I have some right to
voice my opinion.  It is not as though I am criticising anything without
actually signing up :-)  Need I say I signed up for the mega 8GB account too
(I am not THAT stingy a customer) so I don't appreciate being labelled
greedy or impatient.  And like I said I never pretend to be an authority on
the technical side of it - I just want to see more services like a customer
of any other service would.  I'm only human - and a big fan of Internode and
the quality services Internode provides..  I spend more time promoting
Internode to my friends than criticising it Simon :-)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We are perfectly happy to keep augmenting the things that we mirror. 
&gt; As has already been said, the facility is very new and we're still 
&gt; shaking it down - but we are also adding additional distributions to 
&gt; it on a continuing basis as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Please don't construe what Ian has said below as policy or as 
&gt; anything negative.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to make sure that this is clear - just because Ian didn't get 
&gt; an instant prediction of the nanosecond at which his hearts' desire 
&gt; will be fulfilled, that isn't a statement that we aren't likely to do 
&gt; exactly what he's requested - just that like all things in the world, 
&gt; sometimes just a tiny bit of patience is worth including in your 
&gt; expectations and requests :)
&gt; 
&gt; We are still feeling our way in terms of what is most useful for our 
&gt; customers in mirroring terms.
&gt; 
&gt; Helpful suggestions are always welcome (most usefully directly to us, 
&gt; not surprisingly - via our feedback email address, 
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:feedback@internode.on.net">feedback@internode.on.net</A>, or via a standard support request through 
&gt; our support web interface, or whatever).
&gt; 
&gt; But... the below reads ( to me ) like an accusation that we won't do 
&gt; it or we don't care - and neither could be farther from the truth. 
&gt; We're at the forefront of listening to what our customers need, and 
&gt; we always have been. That is why the mirrors exist (and in each 
&gt; state, so that every customer, in any state we provide ADSL, get the 
&gt; same high performance access to the mirrors as well).
&gt; 
&gt; In terms of other things to mirror - again we're looking into this at 
&gt; present. While its easy to ask for something, please bear in mind 
&gt; that sometimes its harder to do than it might seem from the outside 
&gt; to do these things at the snap of the fingers.
&gt; 
&gt; (and again the debian primary cd distributions are already on the 
&gt; Internode mirrors now)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;    Simon Hackett
&gt;    Internode

&gt; &gt;| &gt; Sounds good... would love to know when its up.

&gt; &gt;| &gt; I don't care much for ISO's - they're easy enough to obtain.

&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; I've been putting off broadband for a while, but its becoming
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; more and more apparent that I do need it ;)
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; I don't download a whole heap, but I do install/upgrade a
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; fair few debian packages, and a *lot* of my data 
&gt; comes from this.
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt;
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; Any ADSL providers covering Adelaide/SA (I'm in Victor
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; Harbor, ADSL is available here) with a local debian mirror
&gt; &gt;| &gt; | &gt; (particulary unstable packages) that isnt counted towards the
