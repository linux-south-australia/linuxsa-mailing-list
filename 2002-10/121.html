So, I finally got my webcam to work after quite a bit of searching for 
answers....

So I went back to the store to pick up one for a friend, and I mentioned 
that their generic camera infact worked in Linux, and that I would like 
to give them instructions and a CD with software on it so that people 
wouldn't get the impression that the store did not carry cameras for Linux.

I tried to be the politest person imaginable,  and asked to see the 
manager. I was a bit nervous at first trying to explain the whole thing, 
but it turns out the first guy I talked to used Free BSD in the past.  

Because my first impulse is to either problem solve (or joke...)  I told 
him that the source code for the driver was downloadable, and maybe he 
could use the same camera as well..  But then I realized that I couldn't 
give him step by step instructions, so I offered him my email address. 
 That was when he fessed up and admitted that he actually used OSX now.

So... BSD users....can a webcam be used in FreeBSD if a Linux driver is 
available? What are the steps.

Even though I have copies of both Free BSD and Net BSD....I don't have 
compatable hardware, so I can't test and expiriment like I usually 
do...so, I ask.

(back to the story)

Anyway.....the manager was helpful,  and told me where to email to 
submit my proposal. He also told me to CC him when I wrote.

Now my goal is to make it easy for them to:

1. Package the camera as being clearly made for Linux (or BSD if it is 
possible...) A penguin sticker that says works in Linux comes to mind....
2. Include instructions for installing the driver and using the camera. 
A photocopied white sheet comes to mind....
3. Include a CD with the necessary software on it.

I also hope that a side effect will be that they will buy more of these 
cameras from the manufacturer (Xirlink), who will hopefully make more.

Any ideas as to what I should say, and more importantly, anybody know 
how to get a webcam working in Free BSD?
