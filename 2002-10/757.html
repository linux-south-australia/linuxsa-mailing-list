I need to set up a box to function as a straight forward no fuss firewall /
router / transparent proxy for 1 (maybe very rarely more) users.  These are
the options from the Mon Motha script - I have sugggested a few configs
below for comment.  I am using 2.4.7 (stable version of the script).


MonMotha's IPTables Firewall Configuration Reference Guide

Version 2.3.8-pre7
Last Edited: June 23, 2002 


This is a detailed guide of the configuration options within httpMonMotha's
IPTables script &lt;<A HREF="http://monmotha.mplug.org/&gt">http://monmotha.mplug.org/&gt</A>;, a mature and easy to configure
Linux 2.4 kernel Netfilter script that will do firewalling, routing, NAT, IP
masquerading, and "Cable/DSL router"ing as CompUSA sales people call it.


This is a wiki page. Please feel free to comment where you think additional
information might be useful to people configuring the script. 

  _____  


Main Configuration Section 


*	IPTABLES="/usr/local/sbin/iptables" 

*	TCP_ALLOW="" I will use IRC, web (ssl and normal), FTP, all the
usual dekstop user stuff - so I just add the ports as required?  Find the
ports that IRC uses, etc..

*	TCP ports to allow on incoming connections to the firewall itself
(localhost) from the Internet. Add only the ports that you need for services
like SSHD, Web Servers, FTP servers, etc. Seperate port numbers with spaces
like "22 80 443" Keep this as short as possible for security. These also
apply to any computers behind the firewall that have public IPs. 

*	UDP_ALLOW="6112 6119 4000" - I will probably use quake3 or other
games - is this a security risk if left open?  What port/s does Quake3 use?

*	UDP ports to allow on incoming connections to the firewall itself
(localhost). The defaults are what you need to play all battle.net games
(including Starcraft
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mplug.org/phpwiki/index.php/NetfilterStarcraft&gt">http://www.mplug.org/phpwiki/index.php/NetfilterStarcraft&gt</A>; and Diablo ][).
These also apply to any computers behind the firewall that have public IPs. 

*	INET_IFACE="eth0" 

*	Interface device to the Internet. (probably eth1 or eth0 for cable,
leased line, and non PPPoE DSL; ppp0 for dialup or PPPoE DSL) 

*	LAN_IFACE="eth1" 

*	Interface device(s) to your internal LAN. This is probably eth0 or
eth1. In theory you can now have more than one of these. 

*	INTERNAL_LAN="192.168.0.0/24" -- I use a 192.168.0 LAN

*	The ENTIRE internal LAN. (If you have multiple subnet's, separate
with spaces). This should also set up all you need to use the firewall box
as a router between subnets (assuming your routing table is peoperly
configured). 
	*	/24 means subnet 255.255.255.0, /8 is 255.0.0.0 (for
10.x.x.x) 

*	MASQ_LAN="192.168.0.0/24"  -- will I have to worry about any
existing services on the host machine conflicting with masqueraded IPs of
ports also in use on that machine?  Say for identd or something.

*	The internal network(s) to be masqueraded. These IP addresses should
be within the three ranges specified by httpRFC 1918
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html&gt">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html&gt</A>; reserved for internal networks. 

*	SNAT_LAN="" --- I will use dial-up and soon dynamic ADSL - I doubt I
need worry about this??

*	Internal networks/hosts to use static NAT (format is &lt;internal ip or
network&gt;:&lt;external ip&gt;). This is for network address translation of real IP
addresses on the Internet side to certain httpRFC 1918
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html&gt">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html&gt</A>; addresses on the internal LAN. This
can replace masquerading if you have a static IP and will also allow you to
keep connections going if the interface drops momentarily. 

*	DROP="LTREJECT" --- I like logging and lots of flashing lights..

*	What to do with packets we don't want: 

*	DROP: Basically ignore the packet, no further action will be taken 
*	REJECT: Respond with an error, then DROP the packet 
*	TREJECT: Respond with tcp-reset for TCP or normal REJECT for other
protocols, then DROP the packet 
*	LDROP: log the packet then DROP it 
*	LREJECT: log the packet then REJECT it 
*	LTREJECT: log the packet then TREJECT it 

*	You probably want TREJECT as this will make your firewalled ports
show up as if they were not open at all. Use LTREJECT if you want to log it
too. 

*	DENY_ALL="" 

*	Internet hosts to explicitly deny from accessing your system at all.
This is an incoming only block (you can still connect to them), and will
take the system wide drop policy. 

*	BLACKHOLE="" 

*	Hosts you don't want to have anything to do with (this is a
bidirectional deny), this can have it's own policy (like DROP) to make your
box ignore flooders and other abusers after you've identified them and added
them to this. 

*	BLACKHOLE_DROP="DROP" 

*	What to do with stuff from blackholed hosts. Takes the same options
as DROP= above. 

*	TCP_FW="" -- do I just enter the same ports as above for TCP_ALLOW
for normal desktop applications?  I will also need streaming media, etc..

*	Port forwards on TCP. This allows you to forward one (or a range of
ports, use a - between the start and stop ports) port from the external
interface on the NAT box to the same or a different port on an internal
HOST. This can also be used between public IPs. The format is: port(range)
on external iface:port on internal iface&gt;destination IP. If a range is
specified, all the ports on the external interface will be forwarded
incrementally to the portrange specified on the internal interface. (I.E.
specify the rule "1-5:2-6&gt;10.0.0.1", port 1 will be forwarded to port 2 on
10.0.0.1, 2 forwards to 3, etc). As of 2.3.8-pre3 you will also need to
allow them in TCP_ALLOW or similar. 

*	UDP_FW=""  -- put the quake3 ports here?

*	Same as above but using UDP (some games may need this, such as older
versions of starcraft). 

*	MANGLE_TOS_OPTIMIZE="TRUE" 

*	This changes the TOS of various packets (mostly generated by games)
to ask for special treatment by routers along the way. Most routers simply
ignore this, but some can provide different routes for high-bandwidth vs.
low-latency (think gigabit satellite link vs. T1). Often this has no
noticable effect. Disable if you have problems or just don't like it. 

*	DHCP_SERVER="TRUE"  --- I have a dhcp server runing on it - seems
pointless for one machine but oh well..  It works and that's all that
matters - set this to 'true'?  I only want the DHCP server visible
internally..

*	Set to TRUE if the firewall is also a DHCP server. DHCP clients do
not need this. This allows broadcasts to the server from potential clients
on the LAN to succeede. 

*	BAD_ICMP="5 9 10 15 16 17 18" --- anyone know what this does?

*	This is a list of ICMP messages to deny from the internet. Numeric
or english form is acceptable. 

*	ENABLE="N" 

*	You will need to set this to "Y" or it won't run. This is a saftey
measure to make sure people don't blindly run it without configuring it. 


Flood Parameters Configuration --- I presume I can leave all this as is for
a desktop machine with very few services (if any externally excepting identd
for IRC maybe some others)


*	LOG_FLOOD="2/s" 

*	How often to log to the log file if something's happening that has
logging on it (the L-policies for DROP, synfloods, ping floods). This is to
prevent log DoSing. Probably should be decreased unless you are
investigating things. 

*	SYN_FLOOD="20/s" 

*	Rate at which to allow SYN packets. SYN packets are used in
establishing a TCP connection. If you have no services running, you can take
this down to 1-5/s and let the burst take care of the occasional FTP, DCC,
ICQ, etc connections. Servers will probably need this MUCH higher. If you
have problems with connections to your computer failing, increase this
number. 

*	PING_FLOOD="1/s" 

*	How many pings to respond to per second. For most people 1 per
second or even less is sufficient (just enough to check to see if you're
up). www.yahoo.com might want more though :) 


Outbound filters



*	ALLOW_OUT_TCP="" -- do I need to worry about this??  I thought I had
already defined ports, etc - or is this for 'hosts' in the proper sense that
run a web server, etc?

*	Internal hosts allowed to be forwarded out on TCP (do not put
this/these host/s in INTERNAL_LAN, but do define their method of access
(snat or masq) if not a public ip). Use the source luke. 

*	PROXY="" --- I run squid on the same box - 127.0.0.1:3128??  I think
I have set squid to transparent mode too in the config file - I don't know
how that changes the operation of squid.

*	Redirect for Squid or other transparent proxy. Syntax to specify the
proxy is "host:port". 


Experimental Options (please report your successes/failures) 


*	MAC_MASQ="" --- can I use this to lock my wireless ADSL connection
to my laptop wireless NIC?

*	MAC addresses permitted to use masquerading, leave blank to not use 

*	MAC_SNAT="" 

*	MAC addresses permitted to use static NAT, leave blank to not use
(format is &lt;MAC Address&gt;:&lt;external ip&gt;) 

*	TTL_SAFE="" 

*	How many hops packets need to make once they get on your LAN (null
disables the mangling) (requires patch from patch-o-matic). Probably for
extremely paranoid people only, it's only in for fun. 

*	USE_SYNCOOKIES="TRUE" --- will this break anything if I set it to
true?

*	TCP
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mplug.org/phpwiki/index.php/SynCookies?action">http://www.mplug.org/phpwiki/index.php/SynCookies?action</A>=edit&gt;Syn Cookies
on or off (TRUE/FALSE toggle). Recommended to TRUE, because this will
protect you from SYN floods by posing a cryptographic challenge per every
TCP connection to make illegitimate connections computationally expensive,
thus rendering SYN floods mostly ineffective. Requires more CPU power on
your firewall machine, though not noticably so unless you have an active
server or you are synflooded. 

*	SUPER_EXEMPT="" 

*	A list of hosts that get to completely bypass the packet filter.
Separate with spaces. Use these with extreme caution (you might as well add
them to /etc/hosts.equiv while you're at it if you trust these hosts this
much). 

*	BRAINDEAD_ISP="FALSE" -- I presume Internode is not 'braindead' lol

*	This option forces no fragments on TCP. Useful if you have an ISP
with a braindead firewall that blocks ICMP fragment needed messages or if
you are on a tunneled connection (such as PPPoE DSL) with an MTU lower than
that of your LAN. 

*	ALLOW_HOSTWISE_PROTO="" -- need I worry??

*	This option allows you to allow IP protocols (other than UDP and
TCP). Note that this has nothing to do with TCP or UDP port numbers.
Standard notation is acceptable for a host, so if you want to allow from
everyone it is acceptable to use 0/0 for the host to allow from. 


Pre-Alpha and non-functional stuff - Don't bother unless you're working on
it. 


*	DMZ_IFACE="" 

*	Interface your DMZ is on (leave blank if you don't have one). 


Additional information 


LOCIP options for configuration directives 


Many configuration directives allow a LOCIP option to be specified. This
allows you to filter based on the destination IP. This is useful if the
system running the firewall has multiple public IPs or you are running
publicly routable IPs on your internal LAN and want to open ports to a
single host only. 


Outbound filtering --- should this concern me or us?


The script has very little support for outbound filters. This will be
addressed in the later 2.5.x development series (not begun as of 23 June
2002).
