Anthony,

&gt; Can anyone advise me who in Adelaide could supply me with a cable and
&gt; sync adaptor so I can use a Hewlett Packard A1097C monitor with a PC?

The cable is easy. The answer is virtually anyone from Dickies to anyone
who can talk to Mimp.

&gt; It
&gt; has 3 x BNC connectors with sync on green.
&gt; 
&gt; Any recomendations would be appreciated.

Talk to Robyn Manning (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:rmanning@adam.com.au">rmanning@adam.com.au</A>) -- she's had
experience getting these things running and she says she understands the
skull-dudgery to get these things working. As testimony she has Sun
monitors (sync on sep. horiz and sep. vert) running on her systems.

She's looked at the circuitary to do what I need (sync on green) and
said she undertstands it, but I've never gotten her to do that circuit
for me.

I have a card from <A HREF="http://www.si87.com/">http://www.si87.com/</A>

It ended up costing me about $600 at the time. Might sound expensive but
I currently am running a 21"/20" viewable Sony Trinitron tube with it so
$600 isn't a bad price.

I hope this helps.
