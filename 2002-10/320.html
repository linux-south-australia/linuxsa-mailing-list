&gt;&gt;I believe that one could call her "Our Lady Theresa". She definitely
&gt;&gt;does have a title because Karol Wotyla, better known as Pope John Paul
&gt;&gt;II, canonised her very recently.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe that she has actually been canonized as yet; The church 
&gt; has started the process, is my understanding.

John Paul II waived the usual five-year delay after someone's
death for Mother Theresa's cause to be submitted to the
Congregation of the Causes of the Saints.

Agnes Bojaxhiu's cause needed to meet two requirements for
cononisation: (1) a "life of heroic virtue" and (2) "a miracle
attributed to her intercession".  (1) was determined pretty
quickly.

This week, on 1 October, the Congregation declared as authentic
a miracle which occurred with Mother Theresa's intercession.

It now rests with the Pope sign the decree stating that
condition (2) has been met.  This is expected at the
Congregation meeting in December.  After the signing it
is expected that the pontiff will announce the date for
her beatification.  For logistical reasons the ceremony
is expected in the Italian spring of 2003.

Regards,
Glen
