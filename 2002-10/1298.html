&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but isnt Citrix's protocol compatible with

Well, I know that ICA !== RDP, that's for sure. I doubt that the ICA
client would talk directly to an RDP-speaking server, either. 
MetaFrame sits on top of Windows Terminal Services, supposedly
enhancing it with ICA.

I'll put my money on ICA not talking to a server that doesn't have
Citrix on it, namely a plain WTS box.

[ Don't get me wrong; ICA is a nice protocol, but Citrix, well... ]

&gt; 
&gt; Yah, tell me about it - their client would be great if it wasnt
&gt; bloddy ActiveX driven. 

Hmm. In there defense, writing a client that ran on all platforms and
understood every platform's anomalies (including those relating to
sound, local ports and all that garbage) in Java would have been a
downright bitch.

&gt; Java based version of rdesktop would be awesome, but alas it doesn't
&gt; exist :-( 

Indeed.

&gt; I don't know why people suggest VNC in replacement for
&gt; Citrix/Terminal Services - its not the same thing people. 

That's right. I'm talking about connecting to a thin-client backend,
not remote access to the workstations of individuals.
