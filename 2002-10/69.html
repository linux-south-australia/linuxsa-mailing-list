There was a famous case in the USA about a lawyer who put a spammer on
notice that he will be charged at $20 a spam or somethng - and I believe he
constructed in such a way that it was legally valid (being a lawyer).  I am
really intrigued by that.

I'm not sure what Australian legislation will permit ISPs or individuals to
do to recover lost T&M?

&gt; Subject: Re: Blocking Spam - blacklisting IPs?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have heard that IPs can be blacklisted - which is why 
&gt; that idiot in Perth
&gt; &gt; tried to sue our courageous anti-spammer - as he placed the idiot in
&gt; &gt; question on a block list - thereby blocking the idiot's 
&gt; consitutional right
&gt; &gt; to inundate people with his rubbish.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How can one blacklist IPs?
&gt; 
&gt; There's a bunch of documentation around which details how to 
&gt; set up the RBL 
&gt; (realtime blackhole list, <A HREF="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/,">http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/,</A> <A HREF="http://mail-">http://mail-</A>
&gt; abuse.org/rbl/usage.html) to work on your server.
&gt; 
&gt; Side-note: I'm aware that there is some sort of annoying war 
&gt; going on between 
&gt; RBL and ORBS (another blacklist). Does anybody know if this 
&gt; has blown over yet, 
&gt; or can give me a bit more information on the current situation?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I go through my ISP (ihug) for email - of course they never 
&gt; do anything when
&gt; &gt; I report spam requesting the IP be put on a block list for 
&gt; their email
&gt; &gt; server.  I am not sure if this is because they can't or because they
&gt; &gt; couldn't care.  They just respond advising me to follow 
&gt; other avenues.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a bunch of things which are stopping them from doing this:
&gt; 
&gt;  * They need to confirm that the IP that you have reported is 
&gt; actually a 
&gt; spammer, which takes more time than most ISPs have.
&gt; 
&gt;  * If they start blocking IPs, they're suddenly deciding what 
&gt; content a user 
&gt; can and cannot receive. Users tend to get pissy about this 
&gt; sort of thing, 
&gt; especially when the ISP messes up.
&gt; 
&gt;  * Being sued by a spammer on the warpath is never fun.
&gt; 
&gt; What they /should/ be doing is pointing you towards 
&gt; spamassassin, the RBL, or 
&gt; some form of Windows software which performs a similar task.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if you report a spammer coming FROM their networks 
&gt; they're likely to 
&gt; do something about it. Make sure that you include the headers 
&gt; of the spam that 
&gt; you recieved when filing a report!
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Is it possible to 'reject' traffic and have one's ISP bill 
&gt; the spammer for
&gt; &gt; wasted bandwidth?  Or legally advise the spammer that they 
&gt; will be billed on
&gt; &gt; a T&M basis for filtering through their rubbish - at say 
&gt; $10 an email (plus
&gt; &gt; GST)?  I am seriously considering this path if anyone has 
&gt; any legal advice?
&gt; 
&gt; First question: theoretically, but your ISP won't do this, 
&gt; and the spammer 
&gt; isn't legally obliged to pay the bill anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Second question: I've heard of a couple of people who have 
&gt; successfully 
&gt; recieved a fair chunk of money (say, $500 a hit) from 
&gt; spammers who didn't want 
&gt; to be sued. Names and URLs escape me, though.
