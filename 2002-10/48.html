Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; I have heard that IPs can be blacklisted - which is why that idiot in Perth
&gt; tried to sue our courageous anti-spammer - as he placed the idiot in
&gt; question on a block list - thereby blocking the idiot's consitutional right
&gt; to inundate people with his rubbish.
&gt; 
&gt; How can one blacklist IPs?

There's a bunch of documentation around which details how to set up the RBL 
(realtime blackhole list, <A HREF="http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/,">http://mail-abuse.org/rbl/,</A> <A HREF="http://mail-">http://mail-</A>
abuse.org/rbl/usage.html) to work on your server.

Side-note: I'm aware that there is some sort of annoying war going on between 
RBL and ORBS (another blacklist). Does anybody know if this has blown over yet, 
or can give me a bit more information on the current situation?

&gt; I go through my ISP (ihug) for email - of course they never do anything when
&gt; I report spam requesting the IP be put on a block list for their email
&gt; server.  I am not sure if this is because they can't or because they
&gt; couldn't care.  They just respond advising me to follow other avenues.

There's a bunch of things which are stopping them from doing this:

 * They need to confirm that the IP that you have reported is actually a 
spammer, which takes more time than most ISPs have.

 * If they start blocking IPs, they're suddenly deciding what content a user 
can and cannot receive. Users tend to get pissy about this sort of thing, 
especially when the ISP messes up.

 * Being sued by a spammer on the warpath is never fun.

What they /should/ be doing is pointing you towards spamassassin, the RBL, or 
some form of Windows software which performs a similar task.

However, if you report a spammer coming FROM their networks they're likely to 
do something about it. Make sure that you include the headers of the spam that 
you recieved when filing a report!
 
&gt; Is it possible to 'reject' traffic and have one's ISP bill the spammer for
&gt; wasted bandwidth?  Or legally advise the spammer that they will be billed on
&gt; a T&M basis for filtering through their rubbish - at say $10 an email (plus
&gt; GST)?  I am seriously considering this path if anyone has any legal advice?

First question: theoretically, but your ISP won't do this, and the spammer 
isn't legally obliged to pay the bill anyway.

Second question: I've heard of a couple of people who have successfully 
recieved a fair chunk of money (say, $500 a hit) from spammers who didn't want 
to be sued. Names and URLs escape me, though.
