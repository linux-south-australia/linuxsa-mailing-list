Joh,

You haven't mentioned any other details about what you are trying to log
into, ie, a console or via X. From the description however, I'll take a
guess that you're trying to log in to X.

What desktop environment are you using (probably KDE or Gnome)? Have you
tried to have a look for any log files? Have you tried to look to see if
anyone else is having a similar problem (on Google).

Have you tried to leave the computer for an amount of time to see if it
will finish the login process (eg over night?). It sounds like a program
is trying to run but isn't and the rest of the process is waiting for it.
If you can when you log in and it freezes drop back to a console
(CTRL+ALT+F1) and using `ps ax` or `top` to see what programs are running.
A process that's taking up a lot of CPU time could be what's holding the
show up.

Darryl
