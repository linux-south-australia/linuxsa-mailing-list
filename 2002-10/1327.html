&gt;  &gt; simpler than to change all your apps to support mbox!
&gt;  &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Ant,
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently using mbox (Mailbox) already, and as I understand, this 
&gt; is what the majority of MUA's support. My concern is to what I would 
&gt; need to change to run Maildir. (or is this what you meant?)

Hmm ok, I thought qmail used Mairdir by default (infact, I thought qmail
invented it).
 
&gt; But going back to what you said, I guess you mean use courier IMAP or 
&gt; similar, but is this instead of qmail or on top of qmail?
&gt; and how would that work?

Well, qmail is your mail system. It is storing mail in mbox so you
say... but thats irrelevant if your webmail accesses the mailbox via
Imap. Its probably easiest to install an imap rpm, which should do what
you want pretty much out of the box, you might just need to configure it
to use in your case mbox if that is not the default. You then shouldn't
have to touch anything else, preventing other problems!

Ant
 
&gt;  &gt; We run maildir and
&gt;  &gt; our webmail uses IMAP. All works fine.
&gt; 
&gt; IMAP is all a bit unclear in my head, and I dont want to enter into 
&gt; trial and error methods, since we already have clients using the box 
&gt; and dont want to loose mail or have a long downtime trying new things.
&gt; 
&gt; could you elaborate a little, if you have time??
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; regards
