&gt;Then why @ 20/c / MB?  Why not 1 or 2c?  I don't believe this has anything
&gt;to do with the ISP at all - it's happening upstream somewhere.

I use e-access (www.e-access.com.au), and their excess per MB charges 
are only 4c per MB (recently dropped to that from 11c)  which I consider 
very good compared to similar offerings from other companies.

&gt;That's great - but remember when international phone calls cost like $3 - $9
&gt;/ a minute or something ridiculous?  Very few people used that service then
&gt;too.  Then came in competition and now people can afford to call the grand
&gt;kiddies overseas.  If only mobile phones would come down!!!

Im confused as to what needs to come down with mobile phones? Currently I get the same price as a land line optus customer for overseas calls (excluding the "special" deals if you preselect), on the weekend I get 20c for 10min to any mobile customer (which is useful to me seeing as I am usually out as are everyone I am trying to contact), and not that expensive landline rates (although it is measured every 30 seconds), my mobile is many many times the better deal than an English mobile or landline customer would get. I believe that Optus also has business plans (you need to be a business to sign up iirc) that allows 17c for 5 minutes of phone call to any phone in Australia.
