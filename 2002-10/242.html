&gt; &gt; Nearly all the causes I have seen mentioned are overseas ones. And yet

&gt; &gt; fringe adder-oners, people the distribution makers cannot do without.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps the same ends could be served by moving the cash around locally? I

&gt; Interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe this could be done in quite a direct and relevant fashion...
&gt; perhaps donations could be used to buy equipment and/or books for
&gt; hackers. I can't think how it would work, but it's an idea.

That's exactly what I was trying to say I noticed got difficult with the
LIGDF, if you come up with rules for what cash can be spent on things get
tricky. You get worthy ideas scotched because they don't fit the rules,
and worthy individuals passed over because they don't need a new computer
or a new book right now (but they do need a new XYZ which will give them
so much more time for development, but it isn't in the rules.)

I'm not sure the above applies with large chunks of money. When a fund
can afford to pay for people to go to international conferences or get
them new laptops etc, clearly this is a valuable directed contribution.
I'm talking about the kinds of amounts canvassed on this list.

I still think Matt is right when he talks about giving some time back as
being more direct input. But several people here seem to feel strongly
about handing out the folding plastic dollar stuff too.
