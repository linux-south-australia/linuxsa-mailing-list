It is obvious who's fault it was: the people who broke in and stole the
equipment! The equipment was certainly not unsecure. AirNet in no-way
inferred that Telstra was involved. These things happen, and AirNet had
a disaster recovery method which had the event repaired very rapidly. I
do not feel that it is justified to take a dig at AirNet because it was
the victim of a crime.

The down time was less than one business day (It took less than 6 hours
to restore over a dozen links) and it only affected clients who were
physically connected via to the links. Clients who had secondary links
via ADSL or ISDN were not majorly affected.

(FYI: There is a reward for any information which leads to the
apprehension and conviction of those involved of a broadband connection
(ADSL or WLL) for a year.)

Thank you to the people who have taken the time to be informed with the
dial up issue AirNet experienced between March and August. It was a
harrowing experience for me personally and incredibly costly and
frustrating to AirNet users and AirNet - the saga has not finished yet
and currently I am bound not to comment any further other than to say
that AirNet is currently addressing the Telstra OnRamp30 dial up issue
with the assistance of Baker McKenzie Law Firm and the ACCC. As with
most legal cases it is taking time, and the outcome for reimbursement of
re-dial charges will not be known for some time yet.

Who's fault was the unsecured equipment on-top of the carpark which was
stolen/damaged recently?

(And the downtime for their customers which resulted)

It certainly wasn't Telstra.
