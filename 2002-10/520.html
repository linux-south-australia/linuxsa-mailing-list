Oh.  Hrm.  I was lied to then ;-)

Yeah, all these commercial versions of wine sh*t me.  Why they cant all be merged into the single tree seems completely ridiculous - to run games, transgaming (winex) is what I use, whereas to run office apps, its codeweavers.  And even then their open source versions dont run everything.

Haha... no AOL?  I'll live ;-)

Fair enough.  If Lindows still uses Wine, my original opinion stands.  I thought the whole idea proposed to me before was way cool.

WineX is awesome, the amount of stuff I can run on it days astounds me.  And now supposedly EQ?  Wow :)

| &gt;G'day...
| &gt;
| &gt;Up until today I thought Lindows sucked, now I'm possibly having second thoughts... I just had a discussion with a friend who claims that Lindows in fact doesn't use Wine (as I had always thought) - it uses some kind of kernel level emulation layer for the Windows API.  I'm guessing this is simular to how Mac OS X runs "Classic" applications - and I know this does work well.
| &gt;
| &gt;Sounds fscking interesting.
| &gt;
| &gt;I'm an Evercrackhead - the day this runs under Linux at a half acceptable speed is the day I forever dump windows.  These days I use my Linux/BSD boxen 95% more then I do my windows box - hell, my windows box even looks like unix boxen ;) 
| &gt;
| &gt;The chances of EQ actually working in Lindows actually sounds pretty good, so hrmm... maybe I was wrong after all... ;)
| &gt;
| &gt;Anybody on this list got a copy?  Wouldn't mind looking at it.

| &gt;Email me offlist.
