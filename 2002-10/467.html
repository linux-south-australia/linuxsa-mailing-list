&gt; Actually, that is something our company started to do when we kept hiring people who couldnt even do the basics that we required. If somebody can display that they can do the basics, then more often than not they will actually be capabale of what they said in their CV.

&gt; My 2 cents worth :)

I think it's a great idea myself, except if they simply hire the highest
test score. I was informed that they will be interviewing following the
test results. At least that ensures that they dont just look at the
flashiest CV's. It makes for a more level playing field imho.

Previously I haven't even been able to get a chance at an interview.
Most places only seem to hire grads and those with a lot of past
experience. I'm confident of my skills, but I've never studied nor had
any previous employment in any sysadmin role.
