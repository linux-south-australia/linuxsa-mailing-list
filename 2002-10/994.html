&gt;&gt;&gt;then all I can say is that you can't legislate against stupidity.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It's a pity the pollies don't understand this :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;(I wonder when the open road speed limit in the hills will be brought 
&gt;&gt;down to 60 because some people _still_ can't drive - it's already down 
&gt;&gt;to 80 in most places)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Although I pretty much agree with you, laws which protect one from their
&gt; own stupidity (such as seatbelts[1]) shouldn't be so harsh [2]. But I
&gt; think the point here is the law isn't only protecting you from your own
&gt; stupidity, but protecting other drivers from your stupidity.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course this is all just my opinion and by no means right.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; [1] How is not wearing a seatbelt endangering somebody else's life
&gt; (unless you go hurtling through a windscreen at a hundred miles an hour
&gt; into an innocent bystander &lt;g&gt;)
&gt; 
&gt; [2] But insurance claims should be void by choosing to put yourself
&gt; unnecessarily at risk of injurt.

The point here is that it was dropped from 100/110 to 80 because people 
were having accidents where they were driving to fast for the 
conditions, eg doing 70 around a corner that should be taken at 50, or 
driving too fast in the rain. Dropping the speed limit does nothing to 
force these people to drive better, but does force you to do 80 on 
straights that can safely be taken at 100. Laws should be used to 
enforce proper behaviour while still being acceptable to those who _do_ 
behave properly. Speed limits are upper limits, not recomendations 
(thats what the yellow signs are for).
