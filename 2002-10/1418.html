Hmmm, I should read more of threads before I write replys.  But since I spent 
the time writing it, I'm gonna send it anyway.

&gt; &gt; And remember, the gaming industry industry had a huge role on in pushing
&gt; &gt; the envelope for desktop hardware. Game requirments drive hardware
&gt; &gt; developers to create faster, more powerful everythings (CPU's, memory,
&gt; &gt; GFX cards, networking equipment, etc, etc).
&gt; 
&gt; Horse hockey.  
I've heard this before, do horses really play hockey?

&gt; Games may have had *some* influence (e.g. in graphics, but
&gt; what about the influence of photo editing on printers?), but what game
&gt; requires gigabit ethernet?  Technology is following the curve of Moore's
&gt; Law long before games were an influencing factor.

Games never really had much influence on the actual technology being 
developed.  Faster CPUs, larger capacity for memory and hard drives, 
networking equipment, etc would have been built regardless of the gaming 
industry.  

However the home gaming industry did have a significant effect on the home 
adoption of computers.  Having games was a real selling point for computers 
in the home.  This created a larger consumer market for computers, and 
allowed more companies to make PC hardware, which in turn helped to drive 
down the prices of the hardware to a level that could be more affordable, 
etc.  Moore's law predicted the power of computer processing, but gaming 
helped with the economics.

As for what game requires gigabit ethernet?  All of them (to get a real low 
ping while streaming those MP3s at LAN parties :)  and probably QuakeIV.  
Also I might postulate that perhaps on board 3D acceleration was given a bit 
of a boost by gaming.
