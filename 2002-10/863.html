I agree there is no excuse - but on the other hand - I feel that a good
'corporate citizen' would explain to Mrs Jones from 72 that hours of video
conferences with the grand kids in Germany (where the situation is very
different) adds up to a lot of data.

Granted - many ISPs are doing this - so like I said - my beef is NOT with
ISPs who are just doing their job - but I seriously question why it is so
expensive in Australia.  The distances involved would surely add to cost -
but where does the Southern Cross Cable and the nodes in the USA that we
connect to fit in to this?

&gt; &gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their 
&gt; advertisement
&gt; &gt; when they mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I 
&gt; said before,
&gt; &gt; it's unfortunate that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term
&gt; &gt; for this.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah but there *is* a widely accepted shorthand term.  
&gt; "Download" is widely
&gt; understood to mean "data from the ISP to the customer."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n 
&gt; &gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's 
&gt; something wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Look, it's really quite simple.  People are NOT stupid and neither are
&gt; they guileless.  Some consumers will try anything to avoid 
&gt; paying for what
&gt; they bought.  They know that when they sign up to an ISP the 
&gt; product is
&gt; stuff delivered from the Internet.  To try to claim a 
&gt; mistunderstanding,
&gt; that they genuinely thought web pages, or email, or ICQ, or 
&gt; such, was for
&gt; free is just plain guile.  Darn, already used guile, must buy 
&gt; a thesaurus.
&gt; It's duplicit, artful, dishonest, deceitful, tricky, chicanery.  It's
&gt; almost fraudulent.
