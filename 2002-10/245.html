could it be to do with the ServerName and ServerPath directives?

I have virtual hosting setup and it works with it laid out like;
     &lt;VirtualHost 150.101.236.172&gt;
     ServerName nick.sond.com.au
     ServerPath /nick
     DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs/nick
     ErrorLog logs/nick.sond.error.log
     CustomLog logs/nick.sond.access.log combined
     &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

     &lt;VirtualHost 150.101.236.172&gt;
     ServerName sond.com.au
     ServerPath /sond
     DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/htdocs/sond
     ErrorLog logs/sond.error.log
     CustomLog logs/sond.access.log combined
     &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

but evidently, it isnt using an IP alias

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I am having a problem getting a website working on a
&gt; server. I have RTFMed, and this has shed no light on the
&gt; problem and since this is the first time I have tried to set
&gt; up Apache, I need a little help. Basically the problem goes
&gt; like this:
&gt; 
&gt;     I have set up an IP alias on my system and given it the
&gt; IP address I want to use for this web site (ie. my server is
&gt; 203.myIP.193 on eth0:0, and the alias is 203.myIP.250 on
&gt; eth0:1). These are correct, visible and pingable etc.
&gt; 
&gt;     I have set up DNS with my name servers for this IP
&gt; address and delegated the new domain and it is visible on
&gt; the net (ie www.mydomain and www.mynewdomain are visible
&gt; using DNS diagnostic tools Telstra provide with their DNS
&gt; services).
&gt; 
&gt; I have a series of web pages set up and they are live on the
&gt; net (ie I can get people outside my network to see them).
&gt; 
&gt;     This is where the problem starts.
&gt; 
&gt; If I type in www.mydomain I get:
&gt; 
&gt; Bad Gateway
&gt; The following error occurred:
&gt; 
&gt; A DNS lookup error occurred. The host was not found.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: This was working before I started this project.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If I type in www.mynewdomain I get:
&gt; 
&gt; Bad Gateway
&gt; The following error occurred:
&gt; 
&gt; A DNS lookup error occurred. The host was not found.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: This is what I want to get working.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If I type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.193">http://203.myIP.193</A> I get the index page for my
&gt; site www.mydomain
&gt; 
&gt; If I type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250">http://203.myIP.250</A> I get the index page for my
&gt; site www.mydomain
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But here is another weird part -
&gt; 
&gt; The new web site hangs off the default html directory (which
&gt; is /var/www/html/) in a sub-directory that is visible by
&gt; typing in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.193/subdir/index.html">http://203.myIP.193/subdir/index.html</A> (as you
&gt; would expect).
&gt; 
&gt; If I type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250/index.html">http://203.myIP.250/index.html</A> I get the index
&gt; page for my site www.mynewdomain , which is in
&gt; /var/www/html/subdir/index.html.
&gt; 
&gt; Here are the two things that are puzzling me:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.Why does Apache think DNS isn't working when I can get it
&gt; to work manually using the normal tools (ping, nslookup,
&gt; whois)? BTW my mail and everything else on the server isn't
&gt; broken.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Why does <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250">http://203.myIP.250</A> get the index page of the
&gt; default html directory just like <A HREF="http://203.myIP.193">http://203.myIP.193</A> (my
&gt; server and this is the behaviour I would expect) but if I
&gt; type in <A HREF="http://203.myIP.250/index.html">http://203.myIP.250/index.html</A> gets the index page
&gt; to the new website, which is hanging off the default html
&gt; directory in a sub-directory? Logically these two pages are
&gt; the same since the default html file is
&gt; /var/www/html/index.html.
&gt; 
&gt; O.K. here are a few diagnostic tidbits.
&gt; 
&gt; The server runs RH7.0 and Apache 1.3.13
&gt; 
&gt; The logs are a bit hard to interpret, but seem fine
&gt; (access_log and error_log and newaccess_log newerror_log)
&gt; 
&gt; httpd.conf
&gt; Has HostNameLookups On, but this doesn't seem to make any
&gt; difference if it is Off
&gt; 
&gt; Has two Virtual hosts set up
&gt; NameVirtualHost 203.myIP.193
&gt; NameVirtualHost 203.myIP.250
&gt; and
&gt; &lt;VirtualHost 203.myIP.193&gt;
&gt;   ServerName www.mydomain
&gt;   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;VirtualHost 203.myIP.250&gt;
&gt;   DocumentRoot /var/www/html/subdir/
&gt;   ServerName www.mynewdomain
&gt; 
&gt;   ErrorLog logs/newerror_log
&gt;   CustomLog logs/newaccess_log common
&gt; &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     What I want in the end to be able to do is type in
&gt; www.mydomain and get the index page for mydomain and type in
&gt; www.mynewdomain and get the index page for mynewdomain. This
&gt; has been annoying me for over a week now, and I am sure that
&gt; it is a simple problem to fix, but my limited experience
&gt; with Apache is probably blinding me to the answer. If anyone
&gt; could assist that would be most appreciated as I needed to
&gt; get this site working a couple of weeks ago and it still
&gt; isn't. Thanks in advance.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
