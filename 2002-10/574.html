&gt;&gt;When it comes to building a server I would not even consider ATA.
&gt;&gt;The fact that most SCSI drives come with 5yr warrenty vs 6months
&gt;&gt;/1 year for OEM IDE drives.

&gt;I beg to differ!  You certainly can get a 1 year warranty on hard
&gt;drives but 3 years is what we get on all our drives (unless we opt
&gt;for 1 year - which we don't).  Most of our drives are well and
&gt;truly cycled by three years.

Ahh warrenty is irrelevant when comparing between SCSI and IDE drives, the
figure you both should be concentrating on is Mean Time Between Failture
(MTBF).   Undoubtly the IDE drives are fast approaching the speed of the
SCSI disks, but leave a IDE drive running 24/7 on average for more than 2-3
years and they will die why ?

Looking at the 10k Seagate SCSI drives they have a *spec'd*  MTBF of
1.2x10^6 hours or 50,000 days continous operation (136 years by my
calculator), but this is not taking into account poor (note crap) air
circulation around the drives in many pre-rolled servers.   This is many
times the length of the SCSI warrenty period, like over 27 times.

You will *not* find this information on the Seagate site [1] for their
ATA100 drives, so one would have to assume 8760 hrs (1 year) which is many
times less than the SCSI (~136x).   If you were to use your PC for 4 hours
every day then with a MTBF for IDE drives of 8760 hrs the drive would last
approximately 6 years which seems about right in my personal experience.

You will get IDE drives that exceed the MTBF, these are the exception or
what is commonly called "Wednesday Afternoon" drives where the quality of
the drives produced seems to miraculously increase for some reason.   So
IDE drives may last *7 years continous* but you cannot be guarenteed of
this.

So if you consider rolling out IDE RAID servers for *real* production use
aim at replacing the entire array every 12months, this will give you the
added advantage of boosting the array size as drive capacities keep
increasing.   Otherwise roll out a SCSI array which you will have to
replace in around 5-7 years, mainly due to lack of available storage.

For a home server you have the option of replacing drives or turning the
machine off, the choice is up to you.

Cheers

[1] or many of the other manufacturers sites, that is not to say that I
went and checked every one.
