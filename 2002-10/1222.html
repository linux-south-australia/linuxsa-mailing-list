&gt; &gt; OK heres a scenareo:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You have a critical server that has 350 days uptime on it. It has a
&gt; &gt; small ups. The ups starts screaming, and you figure this is because the
&gt; &gt; battery is probably stuffed, and it could use a replacement. Before
&gt; &gt; ordering the replacement, you kick it, and it starts working fine again.
&gt; &gt; What do you do? :)
&gt; 
&gt; It's a critcal system, so the machine has two power supplies :-)
&gt; Move one to the unfiltered mains.
&gt; Now call the UPS vendor to arrange maintenance.

Well, yes. It is a critical machine and does have 2 power suplies.
Unfortunatly there is only one plug to the hot swap bay however, which
has dual power supplys in it. Damn. I guess they didnt think of that one
when they designed it! The poor thing has allready lost 1 scsi disk in
the raid array and has been running in degraded mode for a week waiting
for a replacement :(

&lt;good advice snipped&gt;

&gt; And get two power supplies on you next machine.

With 2 power cords! :(
