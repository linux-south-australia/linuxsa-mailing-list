Quoting Dan Shearer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dan@tellurian.com.au">dan@tellurian.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I also wonder if some people might be confusing struggling companies with
&gt; struggling individuals, when it comes to distributions. The individuals
&gt; employed by the distributions are certainly not underpaid just because
&gt; they work for a free software company trying hard to make a profit. So I
&gt; wonder a bit at the suggestions of donating back to the distribution
&gt; companies directly, given that people seem to want to make a direct
&gt; difference to where the work gets done.

After being involved early I've stayed out of _most_ of this - but I see an 
openning :)

My initial point on this thread was to say "give money to distros" so they can 
continue to a) employ free software hackers, and b) continue to do all the QA 
stuff in bundling free software together that isn't generally "fun".

Let's face it, given the choice of documenting, coding, and testing that a 
bunch of packages work together, most people would rather code.  Distros are 
good at doing the documenting and the testing - while people will code instead 
of sleep if that's what they are passionate about.

So while I agree wholeheartilly with a lot of sentiments aboiut giving rewards 
to people who are working out of their garage, I also think it's important to 
support the _companies_ who are targetting effort where no one else might be.
