&gt; I have faced almost the exact same problem, with the exception that all the

&gt; Commerical Options:
&gt; 
&gt; HOBLink ( US$140 per seat + Term Serv licences) worked extremely well.

Yeah, I've heard nothing but praise for HOBLink.

&gt; Citrix worked slightly better ($300-400 per seat + Term Serv
&gt; licences)

Citrix is good and all, but it seems to me to be a helluva lot more
expensive per-seat than plain old WTS. Whatsmore, I'm not sure that
the added functionality that Citrix brings is really a requirement.

&gt; SCO Tarantella was what we eventually went with. ($190 Per connection [Linux
&gt; Intel version only] + Term Serv licences).

I had a look at that when it was first released a year (or two, or
three..) ago. Looks pretty good, and, I would imagine, would work well
in a portal situation. I'm not really sure, though -- is there a
client for Tarantella other than the Java-based web client?

I'd also be interested in knowing how well it would (or wouldn't) cope
with appliances like the Compaq T20. Tarantella has its own protocol,
right? So, I'll assume that I won't be able to use the in-built
clients[1] that are already on the T20 (other than IE)?

&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tarantella.com/">http://www.tarantella.com/</A> You can download a free 30 day trial version, It
&gt; seems to do every thing that you need [and more].

Yeah, I might do that. Cheers.

&gt; Free options:
&gt; 
&gt; A Free option we looked into but never tested was having a linux VNC server
&gt; with "n" many VNC sessions on it. each VNC session on startup would run
&gt; rdesktop in full screen and connect to the Windows Terminal Server. thus the
&gt; VNCserver would act almost as a proxy for the RDP protocol.

Hmm. I'd rather not go down such a path. I'd be happier to pay up and
get a solution that doesn't require extra bits hanging around
everywhere.

&gt; Another option which we could not get working was the RDP 2 VNC proxy. 
&gt; 
&gt; extract from
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2000-November/018429.html">http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2000-November/018429.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; rdp2vnc is basically a translating proxy between VNC
&gt; &gt; and RDP protocols. it's not 100% complete but plenty
&gt; &gt; usable.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; some caveats:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - NT4 only, no support for win2k

First problem: we'll be using Windows 2000 Advanced Server.

[ ... ]

I wonder, though, whether that'll be more trouble than it's worth. It
is, though something I'll consider if I can't get a better solution. 
As I said before, I'd really prefer not to have to use a solution
that's all home-grown, but I'll see what happens.

&gt; I havent been able to quickly find a download, I may have a copy somewere if
&gt; you need it.

Cheers; I'll let you know if I can't find it and need a copy.

[1] ICA, RDP and a copy of Internet Explorer.
