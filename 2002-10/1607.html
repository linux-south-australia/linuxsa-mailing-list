&gt; What does 'registered' RAM mean?  That it is supported by the vendor?

That the memory has a "register" facing the memory bus.  The
register is a buffer that holds the data until it lines up
precisely with the bus clock cycle, allowing a clean data read.

"Holding the data" implies an hit of one clock cycle on the
memory read, so registered memory is slower than buffered memory
(which also holds the data, but doesn't try to line it up with a
clock cycle) or unbuffered memory.

It's difficult to know if you *need* this, it really
depends upon the tolerances of the motherboard.  Certainly
if the motherboard manufacturer says you need it, then you
need it.  For example, they might be relying on the RAM
having solid clocking to get away with a long memory bus
serving 8 or so DIMMs.


The point of ECC RAM isn't that it can detect errors, but
that it can *correct* them.  Particularly, all one bit
errors can be corrected by the DIMM itself.  All two bit
errors can be detected by the DIMM (and potentially
corrected in software).  Most other errors can also be
detected.  Best of all, the software can be informed
of the faulty DIMM, giving it the opportunity to take
the DIMM out of service.

For one bit errors the DIMM's electronics correct the
one-bit fault.  The OS can be informed of the error.

For two bit errors the operating system is informed of
the error.  If the error is minor it can be fixed in
software (at a performance penalty, as you have an
interrupt for each read of that memory).

If the error is major the operating system is still
informed.  This gives the OS a chance to recover
`gracefully'.  For example, it can kill all processes
holding allocations in the faulty DIMM, and take
the DIMM's memory out of the allocation pool.

If the kernel is in the faulty DIMM, it can alter
the kernel parameters to remove the faulty DIMM
and do an IPL or reboot.

Although all this is drastic, you still end up
with a functioning system rather than a heap
of useless silicon.  A better comparative outcome
than the Non-Maskable Interrupt issued on a
failure of a parity RAM DIMM.

All of this makes ECC RAM and good choice for a
high availability system.  You can probably afford
your desktop system to be useless while you pop out
to get some replacement RAM.

Linux is slowly getting ECC functionality (every
OS gets the one-bit errors corrected, even without
full ECC support).

ECC costs more because you need to hold additional bits
of error correcting code.  The code is reasonably complex
and so some significant electronics is required on the
DIMM to calculate the ECC.


ECC memory is usually registered.  This is a sensible
design and marketing choice.  Design-wise, having an
output register gives you a place to shove the corrected
value of a read of a memory cell with a one-bit error.
Marketing-wise, people with high availability (read "server")
needs are going to want both the registered and the ECC
features.  Very few of them are only going to want one.


Yet another mainframe technology arriving on PCs.  Scary.
