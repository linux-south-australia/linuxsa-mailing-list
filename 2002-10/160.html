Aiyah!

I blame Andrew. Apologies to Airnet, staff and customers, as well as
anyone else hurt in the production of this email.

Also, a clarification. Seeing as I explicitly mentioned bad
experiences, I thought I'd better clarify that so it's not
misinterpreted in a worse way than I had originally meant to say to
Andrew...

The comment was not meant to imply the support staff were bad, or that
we had bad people-related experiences there, just that there was a
technical problem that we couldn't seem to overcome, which was
overcome when we changed ISPs (though the same problem was evident
until they worked with us in solving it). This was quite some time
ago, and could well have been specific to the physical conditions
surrounding that specific link.

"Fading away" is nothing more than hearsay and idle speculation. I
have no reason to say that other than I heard it from someone who
heard it from someone who didn't think they were doing too well. This,
again, was some time ago, and may be even less accurate now than it
ever was (not that I have any material reason to believe it).

Again, apologies.

&gt; &gt; Whilst I'm sure you're able to make your own mind up, I might just add
&gt; &gt; (off-list) that I wouldn't touch AirNet with a 40-foot barge pole,
&gt; &gt; even if they paid me to.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, actually, if they were going to pay *me* to use their Internet
&gt; &gt; products, I might change my tune, but they don't, so I have to resort
&gt; &gt; to basing my opinions on facts :-)
