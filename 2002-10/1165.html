&gt; In a recent discussion in other forums we have been talking about why

Linux isn't, and can't be, inherently secure.  This pretty
much follows from it's use of the C programming language.

The definition of "inherently secure" is that the machine
fails to the secure state.  That isn't so with C, buffer
overflows being the prime example of this.

But the problem with this sort of discussion is that it doesn't
recognise that security is a matter of risk management.

Let's imagine a secure operating system.  Any command which
shows the state of the system to the average user is verboten.
So there is no "df", no "/etc".  Any command which influences
the state of ther system is rate limited.  So I/O is so slowed
so that you can't tell if another user on the system is doing
I/O; that is, if the machine is rated for 20 users, you get 5%
of the disk bandwidth.  Similarly for network traffic.  Every
action which changes the machine state is logged, and if that
log fills the machine halts.

You're going to say that this sort of system is slow, unusable
and unreliable.  You're right -- we're making a risk management
decision to trade off security for usability and performance.

If you want to compare Windows and Linux, you are comparing
the quality of their tradeoffs.

The world does lack a good OS with a stricter set of security
trade-offs.  Which is why we have such poor risk decisions such
as building firewalls on BSD, Linux and VxWorks.
