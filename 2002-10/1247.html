Quoting Dan Shearer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dan@tellurian.com.au">dan@tellurian.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; On Tue, 22 Oct 2002 <A HREF="mailto:michaeld@senet.com.au">michaeld@senet.com.au</A> taunted:
&gt; &gt; I haven't helped with this email, right?
&gt; 
&gt; There were some helpful comments -- but I can't get any sense out of the
&gt; M$ recompilation comment which I think is pretty bogus :-)

Yeah you are right.  Too much coffee and too little sleep this week.  Sorry.

Although the point I was trying to make was that there's a lot of (CLI) 
software out that could be classified as a unix-ish application or not.  
[Aside: Who knows if the Win2K kernel is cross platform?  Remember that a 
predecessor built on alpha and mips, and that a descendant builds on ARM :) ]

Sun Microsystems and SGI (and DEC^WCompaq^WHP) did once maintain some big lists 
of proprietary software that were available for their platforms.  You could add 
these to sf, savanna & freshmeat, except that things like the Rational toolset 
would be counted n times.

Things like Google are vertical niche applications that aren't for sale - I 
don't believe there are lists of such things.
