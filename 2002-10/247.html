Hi,

In general and most importantly, I think this has been a very positive 
discussion. :-)

&lt;snipped&gt;

Dan Shearer shared:

&gt;if you come up with rules for what cash can be spent on things get
&gt;tricky. You get worthy ideas scotched because they don't fit the rules,
&gt;and worthy individuals passed over because they don't need a new computer
&gt;or a new book right now (but they do need a new XYZ which will give them
&gt;so much more time for development, but it isn't in the rules.)
&gt;  
&gt;

This is a tough issue. So I am going to try to throw some more 
information into the pot, that is if I can. I don't know about the 
relevance.

Two pieces of the puzzle come to my mind.

Part one.... I suck at programming. :-)  I would say that it could be 
true for others, but maybe its just me. :-D

Ok, that's a bit tounge and cheek, but its actually worse than that... 
For all practical purposes, I couldn't really write my own program.

I'll take a long shot and try to modify someone else's work, but...that 
only gets me so far. Take for example, a program called GTKNetware which 
is available for download at www.darkrock.net.

Sure, I download it and was able to make one pathetically small tweak to 
it, and it was helpful to people...but there is no way I will be able to 
modify it the way I want to completely. BTW - I wrote the guy with some 
input, no response. But to keep it in perspective, I am appreciative 
that he made the program.

Anyway, I would probably have to quit doing accounting work for at least 
two weeks just to create a netware client that is easy and user friendly 
as the free one from Novell for Windows, and I can download that in a 
few minutes.  Since I bill out hourly, well, it doesn't make sense 
economically. I have to do what I can do after hours, and sense my time 
is limited, all I can do is expiriment and try to answer questions, come 
up with solutions, but when it is that late, I am not physically up to 
learning a new programming language.

So basically I fall into the category:    Can contribute most 
effectively by giving money.

Part two.....  

On the spending the money that comes in...

Some of my not for profit clients employ paid workers and accept 
volunteer help. Typically, the paid workers are there full time, while 
the volunteers are only there on weekends, nights, etc.  A lot of the 
full time workers are underpaid, so they are still doing a public service.

So for example, would Computer Bank be as well organized as it is now if 
it had no full time employees?  If the answer is no, than why wouldn't 
that be true of software development?

Anyway, I was going to reword that last sentence, because I am not 
trying to be argumentative....however, I have to get back to work!!   ;-)

Those are my thoughts...

James Leone
