Speaking of which - I have a Sola UPS 325 (?) and would like to obtain line
voltage and other information from it but I can't under Linux - the BestUPS
software only monitors if the mains are on or not.

Any ideas?

&gt; &gt; OK heres a scenareo:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You have a critical server that has 350 days uptime on it. It has a
&gt; &gt; small ups. The ups starts screaming, and you figure this is 
&gt; because the
&gt; &gt; battery is probably stuffed, and it could use a replacement. Before
&gt; &gt; ordering the replacement, you kick it, and it starts 
&gt; working fine again.
&gt; &gt; What do you do? :)
&gt; 
&gt; It's a critcal system, so the machine has two power supplies :-)
&gt; Move one to the unfiltered mains.
&gt; Now call the UPS vendor to arrange maintenance.
&gt; 
&gt; More usefully:
&gt; 
&gt; Screaming noises were probably a coil oscillating. Kicking it
&gt; upset the self-reinforcing oscillation.  Obvious position of
&gt; a coil in a UPS is the transformer.
&gt; 
&gt; Bad news is that the coil is usualy moved out-of-spec by the
&gt; strength of the oscillation, as the material the coil is
&gt; wrapped around is usually shattered.  As that material also
&gt; often provides insulation, I wouldn't be leaving the UPS
&gt; in service.
&gt; 
&gt; If it were me I'd be claiming a "dangerous" condition and
&gt; dropping the server during the next idle time (like 3AM)
&gt; and moving temporarily to the unfiltered mains.  It's a risk
&gt; assessment issue, and I'm really adverse to UPSs that might
&gt; overheat (with resulting smoke and acid issues that might
&gt; effect other machines in the computing facility).
&gt; 
&gt; You need to make your own assessment of the risks and then
&gt; act.  Expensive UPSs keeps internal statistics that can help
&gt; with this assessment (like the input and output voltages at
&gt; the transformer).  I'm not sure if these have propogated
&gt; down to smaller UPSs.
&gt; 
&gt; And get two power supplies on you next machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; Glen
