<H1>Why ECC RAM?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Why use ECC RAM?  I quote it up by standard for clients - and it is
*significantly* more expensive (or maybe that is also because it is
"registered" and somehow supported).  I can see why it is important for
mission critical applications - obviously - but are desktop users at a loss
because RAM is not ECC?  I am not sure if errors occur at random and this
can lead to data corruption over time?  I've never had a problem that I can
detect with errors in RAM - it's always seemed quite reliable to me (unless
some problems I have had are due to RAM errors but it did not appear that
way).

&gt; &gt; I have a coworker that owns a pentium iv Dell at home with a dual rim.

&gt; &gt; slots, the only difference being the 128 v 256 MB and the fact that one 
&gt; &gt; set of chips  are ECC while the others are not. He did buy Dell RAM
chips.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It didn't seem to work after the chips were installed.
&gt; 
&gt; does it work with only the 2 new 256Mb ones?
&gt; you should be able to have 2x128 and 2x256
&gt; I don't think you can mix ECC and non-ECC though
&gt; (ECC is error correcting BTW, generally good to have
&gt; but costs a fair bit more than non-ECC).

Yep, also:

Try putting the 128's where the 256's are, and vice versa.
or
Boot with 2x128's into the BIOS and try turning off any options that
relate to ECC.

Long shot, but you never know.
