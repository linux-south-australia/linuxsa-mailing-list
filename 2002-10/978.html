that's a fair call - I have found some good material on ldp and other sites
that seem to cover the basics quite nicely.  I *have* been trying to catch
up on all this.  If I look where I've come in a few weeks I think I am
definately getting there.  Until a very short time ago - I didn't even know
how a crossover cable worked or what IP numbers are (I just knew there was
some arbitrary allocation of them).

It sounds quite weird - but getting iptables running has forced me to learn
a lot about the basics as I go along - that's how some people learn - on the
go.  Bad way to learn perhaps - but I enjoy it.  One day when I have the
time I will take a good text to read before bed each night.

&gt; 
&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well if it is anything like iptables I'm up for it!!  It 
&gt; took me a while to
&gt; &gt; make progress on that!
&gt; 
&gt; If I may be so bold to say, I think one of your main problems 
&gt; is you try
&gt; to do too much in too little a time. There's an old adage that one
&gt; shouldn't run before one can walk; I fear if you start attempting to
&gt; understand:
&gt; 
&gt; * IP networking
&gt; * VPN's
&gt; * IPTABLES
&gt; * Routing
&gt; * IP Accounting
&gt; 
&gt; ...all at once you may very well get unnecessarily confused.
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest steps in this order:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Get a good understanding of networking (TCP, IP, UDP, ICMP and so
&gt; forth)
&gt; 2) Get a good understanding of how to relate (1) to a packet filtering
&gt; tool such as IP tables
&gt; 3) Get a good understanding of routing
&gt; 4) Then get into IP packet accounting
&gt; 
&gt; If you're having difficulties understanding the concepts required to
&gt; setup a packet filtering firewall with one of the scripts, not to
&gt; mention by hand, then I would suggest you forget about learning IP
&gt; accounting until you do. It sounds harsh, but you need to know the
&gt; basics before getting into the more advanced stuff.
