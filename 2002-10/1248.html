&gt; Although the point I was trying to make was that there's a lot of (CLI)

If it builds and runs on Unix I was thinking of saying it is a Unix app.
Even it is dreadful code that once came from VMS/NT/USCD
p-system/whatever.

&gt; [Aside: Who knows if the Win2K kernel is cross platform?  Remember that a 
&gt; predecessor built on alpha and mips, and that a descendant builds on ARM :) ]

Which descendent builds on ARM? Wince isn't a descendent of NT or even
close, but it is somewhat portable.

I don't dispute that the 2K kernel is cross platform (hardware), but I do
dispute that this means it can necessarily be compiled on other than an M$
software platform. Maybe it is and they are keeping it secret, but the
first does not imply the second.

&gt; Things like Google are vertical niche applications that aren't for sale - I 
&gt; don't believe there are lists of such things.

Google are only too pleased to sell their application for large company
intranets. They even sell hardware to go with it painted a pretty gold
colour. Same thing for FAST ASA's FreeBSD search engine.
