&gt; &gt; I would argue it's a waste of time.  I could work it out or I

&gt; 
&gt; I want you to be able to work it out.  That's the point of it.  As
&gt; to cut and paste, it was a closed computer exam! :-)

yeah but you'd never use that in the "real world".

you appear to be testing (not that I've read the url you
mentioned) detailed shell/language/whatever knowledge which
might be simply what you require, and if so fine, but a
better thing to do is test concepts and real understanding
rather than just memorising operator precedence (for eg).
 
&gt; &gt; I'd think twice about applying for a place that wanted me to sit some
&gt; &gt; little "exam" for a job!
&gt; 
&gt; I'd have felt the same way at one stage, but I've since seen too many
&gt; people in the industry, who give great interview and come with impressive
&gt; resumes, yet are hopeless at their job.  We've got so many charlatans
&gt; waving MCSE's (and soon, no doubt, RHCE's) that you just can't take their
&gt; word for it.  When I employ I need somebody great, and I only know of one
&gt; reliable way to tell if they are that person.  I figure, when I employ
&gt; someone it's going to be a long-term relationship.  If their "scared off"
&gt; by an exam then that's great.  Why should we waste each other's time?

indeed.  I've been asked detailed questions about how I solved
some particular problem or posed a real question the interviewer
(or company) has had and asked how I'd go about solving it.  
This is fine and appears to me to be a good way to check out a 
candidate.  I'm not all that great at interviews BTW!

On the other hand I've seen a bloke with a phd in CS, impressive
resume, interviewed fine, knew his stuff technically, and he was
hopeless in a practical situation (he lasted about 8 months).  
I think he would have done well at your test too.

BTW I'm only talking more senior type techo positions.

&gt; Again, thanks for your thoughts.

no worries, got lots to go around!

Dave.
