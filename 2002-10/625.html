I too have 2 2GB drives that are pushing 7 years, seagate barracuda's 
7200's, they have been in constant use and get spun down when idle (they 
are damn noisy) and they get hot, but I have them in bay coolers.  Have 
not checked the grown defects list lately but have not had a hiccup.

I would IMHO have to say that "typically" SCSI drives are substancially 
more reliable, and in regards to the cost, how much is yor data and time 
worth to rebuild a system?  Even from backups, restores must take time. 
  (I wouldn't know actually - never had to do one =)

&gt; 
&gt; Is this true?  So maybe leaving my Linux box always running is a good idea?
&gt; 
&gt; Someone once told me that parts have a certain lifespan and leaving them
&gt; running brings d-day closer each day it is left running.  I question the
&gt; validity of this rumour.

&gt;&gt;&gt;All this talk of dying hard drives worries me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;From alt.sysadmin.recovery:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Today, we are mourning the loss of /dev/ad43c.  He was a kind, gentle
&gt;&gt;disk, early in his years, with much free space ahead of him.  
&gt;&gt;He passed
&gt;&gt;away today, Friday, January 27th at 9:05am Pacific time.  It was a an
&gt;&gt;unexpected death, with no signs of illness or a history of complaints;
&gt;&gt;he simply went into spams, and started to slip away.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Despite our best efforts to save /dev/ad43c, despite two hours spent
&gt;&gt;trying desperately to bring him back from the brink, he simply lost
&gt;&gt;the battle, and passed on into oblivion.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I will miss /dev/ad43c.  He served us well, and was dedicated 
&gt;&gt;to living
&gt;&gt;the best life that he could.  He will live on in our hopes and in our
&gt;&gt;dreams, and in our hearts.  Though he can never truly be replaced, his
&gt;&gt;essence-- his soul-- shall be with us, always.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Good-bye, /dev/ad43c, and farewell.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have some old drives still
&gt;&gt;&gt;in use at home - and I wonder if hard drives just suddenly 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;die after a few
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;years which seems strange or if that is really only for servers in
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;constant
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;use.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Typically, drives don't die suddenly.  If you have any 
&gt;&gt;automated monitoring
&gt;&gt;of your syslog files, you'll quite often see a build up of 
&gt;&gt;errors before you
&gt;&gt;lose a drive completely (note to pedants that I said 
&gt;&gt;"typically": I have
&gt;&gt;also
&gt;&gt;seen cases of drives failing completely without warning).  
&gt;&gt;Note that vendors
&gt;&gt;like HP have finally gotten around to automating this 
&gt;&gt;process, so quite
&gt;&gt;often you're warned of failure before it happens.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I often don't turn my desktop machine off - although I wonder if my
&gt;&gt;&gt;Linux box spins down the HD?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"Typically", spinning up and down the hard drive increases 
&gt;&gt;the failure rate.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Doesn't the Linux kernel do a sync every few minutes which 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;makes it hard
&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;spin down hard drives?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Every thirty seconds, and only if there is data to be flushed to disk.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I know of people who have hard drives in their home 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;machines running for
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;years with no problem - so I wonder how concerned we should 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;be over data
&gt;&gt;on
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;old(er) drives.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have a 2 gig IBM SCSI drive in my firewall that would be 
&gt;&gt;pushing 7 years
&gt;&gt;continuous use now.  Put that in your MTBF pipe and smoke it!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Regards,
&gt;&gt;  Daryl Tester
