<H1>Using a Handspring Visor on USB Cradle in SuSE Linux 8 with Coldsynch& Jpilot</H1>

I am posting a set of procedures to setup my Handspring Visor in Linux. 
It so far has worked reliably , but only with coldsynch and jpilot. I 
will post my gripes separately as to not clutter this post.

The underlying assumption is that you have a computer with USB port, 
SuSE Linux 8, a Handspring Visor with the Palm OS & USB cradle available 
for use. The USB cradle is plugged into the computer at a USB port & the 
Handspring Visor is on the cradle.

SuSE Linux in particular is probably not required, however, I have not 
found this procedure to work in Lindows as for 10-18-2002. However, it 
may be a mistake on my part, or if not, it will probably be fixed 
realitively soon. Please note that the shell commands below do not 
include the A. or B. etc.

Caveats & applicable use...

Please note that you cannot hotsync email under this configuration. 
Furthermore, jpilot is designed to run in a home directory. It cannot be 
easily changed to store files on a network that will be accessable by 
other parties that have access to the calander. This solution is also 
not ideal in a dual boot situation, as jpilot & coldsynch are not 
windows compatable. Compatability is an issue in an office where a 
number of people keep track of the company calander, and would not want 
to have to wait for the machine to reboot to check the calander for 
available appointment times.


Steps taken to set up a Handspring Visor on USB Cradle in SuSE Linux 8 
with Coldsynch & Jpilot:

1. Install Jpilot
2. Install Coldsynch
3. Go to the shell and type:
    A. cd /dev
    B. ln -s /dev/ttyUSB1 pilot
    C. ln -s /dev/ttyUSB1 palm
    D. modprobe visor
    E.  modprobe usb-uhci
    F. modprobe usb-ohci
    G. emacs /etc/fstab
4. Once Emacs opens /etc/fstab:
    A. go to the bottom of the file.
    B. Note that the last line has the cursor on it at the left, but it 
is blank.
    C. Hit return to add another blank line.
    D. On the line you just created type the following:
        none    /proc/bus/usbdevfs    defaults    0    0
5. Reboot
6. Go to shell and type:
    A. mkdir visorbackup
    B. coldsync -p /dev/ttyUSB1 -mb visorbackup
    C. cd visorbackup
    D. ls -l
7. Note the presence of sundry files in the visorbackup directory. You 
are now ready to use jpilot.
8. Go to the shell and type:
    A. jpilot
9. Once jpilot opens up, go to file/preferences and click on the 
settings tab.
10. Change the serial port setting to read: /dev/pilot
11. Take note of the 4 black boxes on the right
12. Click on the top black box
13. Click on the New Record button at the right
14. Type "Testing" inside the upper of the two white boxes below the new 
record button
15. Click on the Add Record button to save your setting
16. Click on the small sync button at the right. It is located below the 
four black boxes described earlier
17. When the white box displays a message asking you to press the 
hotsynch button, press it
18. Note that the hotsynch process starts after a short delay. You will 
hear a few beeps.
19. When the Handspring Visor displays the message "Hotsync Operation 
Complete" check your Handspring's calander for the testing entry.
20. If you note that the testing entry is present in the visor, you are 
finished.

P.S. I will write my gripemail tommarrow after I wake up.
