Glen,

&gt; Linux isn't, and can't be, inherently secure.  This pretty
&gt; much follows from it's use of the C programming language.

Some languages give you a higher sense of confidence that a solution
is correct.  I would be more confident of a program written in Pascal,
for example, with it's strict type and array bound checking, than an
equivalent program written in C.  (I think that's what you are referring
to.)  Never the less, a real programmer can write Fortran in any language.
I have doubts that the language can make something inherently secure,
it's just that some languages make it easier to make mistakes.

In fact, posit a general purpose computing language, which can be
implemented on a range of current, popular microprocessors.  If a system,
Ss, written in that language, is inherently secure, then it follows that
there is a system, Sm, written in the machine laguage, which is also
inherently secure.  From this it also follows that both Ss and Sm are
members of an infinte set of systems, almost certainly including an Sc
(the system written in C), all of which are equivalent translations of
each other.


&gt; Let's imagine a secure operating system.  Any command which
&gt; shows the state of the system to the average user is verboten.
&gt; So there is no "df", no "/etc".  Any command which influences
&gt; the state of ther system is rate limited.

I think you are talking about a different kind of security than Ian.
You seem to be talking about Orange book security, in which classified
data (e.g. Top Secret) cannot be declassified.  (Rate limiting is in
reference to an ingenious attack in which data could be declassified by
a high-security transmitter using CPU modulation to send the data to a
low-security receiver.  Most amusing.  Sadly I no longer have references.)

Ian is, I think, referring to an uncrackable system.  That's much easier
to achieve.  (I'm not convinced that B level security, as in Orange book,
can be achieved.)


Giving my answer to Ian's question: No, Linux is not inherently secure,
just as Windows is not inherently insecure.  Both depend on how well they
are administered and what applications are run on them.  Linux has the
advantage that you can reasonably expect to be able to view the source
of all programs running on it, whereas with Windows that expectation is
generally not available.  So with Linux you could satisfy yourself that
it was secure, but with Windows you just have to hope.


Regards,

David
