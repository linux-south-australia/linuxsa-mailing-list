Sounds interesting, you might want to look into some related project ( 
I'm sure you already have, but for those that haven't).
Linux seems to be quite popular for home automation.

&gt;
&gt;I want to put in an automated irrigation system in the garden and rig that
&gt;up to a Linux box.  I've looked at controllers, valves, etc and they all
&gt;seem awfully expensive - any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;More *on topic* - what about software and interfaces?  I want it to be
&gt;'networkable' so the standard parallel or serial connection just won't cut
&gt;it - ideally each valve will be addressable and the signal would go down the
&gt;water pipe somehow.  This is to allow the system to be scalable and flexible
&gt;so that moisture and other sensors can be rigged up and report down the
&gt;water pipe.
&gt;
&gt;Each controller may be a 'subnet' and address up to 255 (or 254?) individual
&gt;valve and sensors or other equipment.  This would in turn allow up to 254
&gt;(?) layers on top of this.  For now - only up to maybe 15 to 30 valves and
&gt;sensors may be needed for a small pilot project.
&gt;
&gt;The idea is to have some open source software that will collect information
&gt;from the environment and respond according to the parameters given to it -
&gt;say sensor Y reports moisture below a certain level then switch on drip feed
&gt;valve X for 1 hour, pause 20 minutes and sample again until it returns to
&gt;'programmed' levels.
&gt;
&gt;Reporting software would collect information on water use and the
&gt;environment and any other required information (alert for leaking valve,
&gt;etc).
&gt;
&gt;Something like this could save *a lot* of water - but I have no idea where
&gt;to start!  I do have a big garden some friends with small farms that are
&gt;very interested - especially if the design can be kept very simple, scalable
&gt;and cheap.  This is why Linux may seem like an overkill at first - but with
&gt;the scalability and flexibility of addressable devices and the reporting it
&gt;can bring - it seems quite reasonable to pull out an old Pentium 133 and put
&gt;it to use.
&gt;
&gt;Any pointers or do I just think too much?
&gt;
