"Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt; asks:
&gt; What is Transmeta like for sheer grunt?  Or will Transmeta be primarily
&gt; for mobile applications?  If it appears on the desktop - will this spur
&gt; a little competition?

I have heard of desktop machines with a Crusoe, but the main benefit
is low power, and hence the chip is positioned for the mobile market.
Binary translation makes them slower than a GenuineIntel running at the
same clock speed, and in keeping with the low power design, they don't
come at the stupidly high clock speeds of the competition.  I wouldn't
buy one for grunt.

I trialled a Black-n-Gold Crusoe-based notebook, and found desktop
applications and screen updates to be acceptably responsive.  Since MPEG
decoding is CPU intensive I also watched a DVD movie on it and saw no
fault, which I took as a good sign.  I didn't think to ask if the machine
had a hardware MPEG decoder, so the DVD test might not have the importance
that I hoped.

Despite the quirky physical size of the screen (maybe 10" diagonal and
about the same aspect ratio as a wide-screen TV), it had 1024x768 pixels.
(Sony's Vio PCGC1MT has a wierd but bountiful 1280x600 pixels!)

Crusoe notebooks are rated for very long battery life, some as long as
five hours as compared to two hours for a traditional notebook.  They are
also quite light, usually weighing in at less than 1KG, and have a small
form factor.

I think they have a lot going for them, including price.  Small and light
yet full featured; fast enough but don't expect to wow anyone on <A HREF="mailto:Seti@home.">Seti@home.</A>
