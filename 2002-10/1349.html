&gt; Yesterday I configured RRDTool to graph the memory and I've since

That's really good, it means that the memory you have
paid for is being used to the utmost.  After all, if
you have excess memory above that required by applications
why not use it to cache disk blocks and improve system
throughoput.

Toto, we're not in Windows world any more :-)

&gt; Pressing SHIFT-M and sorting the processes by % memory allocated tells
&gt; me that very little memory is in use.  Of all 86 processes, the highest
&gt; any ever reaches is 0.4%, and that is usually a PRONTO process.

So your applications have more than enough memory.  Good,
they won't swap to disk and slow things down.

&gt; The point of activity at which this system is at highest load is daily
&gt; at 8pm when a script runs that tgz's the PRONTO database and uploads it
&gt; to a Samba server.

That sounds right, lots of disk blocks to cache at that time.

&gt; What could be the course of this excessive memory usage?  Do I have a
&gt; memory leak?

Does "ps" show a signle process's memory growing subtly
but continually?

&gt; Are there any reasonable utilities out there with which I
&gt; can more accurately interrogate my memory usage?
...
&gt; $ cat /proc/meminfo

A very good utility.

&gt; MemTotal:       514180 kB

&gt; Buffers:        105452 kB
&gt; Cached:         247312 kB

&gt; Any ideas?

Have a read of the chapters about about virtual memory
and disk caching in a good operating systems fundementals
book.  I'm sure a uni student could loan you Tannenbaum's
"Modern Operating Systems" or Deitel's "Introduction to
Operating Systems" at a LinuxSA meeting.
