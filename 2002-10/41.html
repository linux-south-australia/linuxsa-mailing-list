Another possible alternative is shunning. 

You block the spammers ip address and notify the net block owner. I mean
block the address from sending email to you, redirect all web request
from that address to an explaination page with instruction on how to
contact you. It is necessary to block all ports requests to and from
that address because some spam contains web addresses for futher
information promotional material, confirmation of a valid email address.

If you dont get any response from the spammer or the net block owner,
you may consider blocking the entire netblock. It is a RFC requirement
for postmaster address to be read by humans or something to that effect.

I have read about this method before somewhere on the web about 18
months ago. I assume that there is a catch. ISPs may not be able to
follow this path but there is nothing that says that you must carry any
traffic on your private network as the end user.

&gt; I can't believe we as a global community, following thousands of years

&gt; resources on network spam as we don security.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the latest on legislation around the world on this rubbish?  I
&gt; know some spammer tried to sue a anti-spam crusader in Perth, failed,
&gt; went in to spamming again, tried to sue the anti-spam crusader again
&gt; and is still trying to spam people.  These people clearly are not
&gt; human - so legislation seems to be the only answer.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless there was a global database of known spammers that the global
&gt; community could inundate with physical and electronic spam in return?
&gt; 
&gt; One get rich quick scam from 5 million people should, theoretically,
&gt; get the message across - unless their servers explode first.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any success / failure stories to share 
&gt; &gt; about Spam Assassin?
&gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like a *great* idea if it works..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Over the weekend I tested an installation of SpamAssassin at message
&gt; &gt; accept time. This means that SA is run against each line of 
&gt; &gt; the message as
&gt; &gt; it is accepted from the remote system, and the connection is 
&gt; &gt; immediately
&gt; &gt; closed with an error.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Advantages:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    - saves paying for an entire message to be downloaded and
&gt; &gt;    processed
&gt; &gt;      later
&gt; &gt;    - helps get people off spammers lists because it will be marked
&gt; &gt;    as 
&gt; &gt;      a failed delivery
&gt; &gt;    - uses less system resources
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I did this with Exim 4 with integration work from Marc 
&gt; &gt; Merlin. Seems happy
&gt; &gt; so far.
