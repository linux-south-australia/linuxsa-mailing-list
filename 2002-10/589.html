&gt;
&gt;Comes the exam, two of the class failed, myself and another. He had 
&gt;much greater knowledge than me, had loads of sysadmin and real life 
&gt;experience with W2K. He is the kind of guy you should employ because he 
&gt;does the job and does it well.
&gt;

Having done an MCP exam myself (not by choice, but when one is asked to 
by ones employer...) I can vouch for this sort of thing not being all 
that surprising, the MCP exam material (Win2K Pro), seemed more designed 
to have the student develop thinking in the Microsoft way, where 
memorising the "MS" answer to a question may be slightly different to 
the real world.

I can thankfully say that Checkpoint and Sun (Solaris Admin) exams seem 
to be based much more on product knowledge (use thereof).
