&gt;&gt; Ah but there *is* a widely accepted shorthand term.  "Download" is widely
&gt;&gt; understood to mean "data from the ISP to the customer."

&gt; To those who know what download means, yes. To the user who clicks "download" 
&gt; in IE, no.

Well we should agree to disagree on this one because I don't think either
of us are going to change our position.


&gt; My beef was with the attitude that a user shouldn't have to contact their geek 
&gt; friend in order to buy an internet connection, not that getting compensation 
&gt; out of the ISP is a good idea.

I don't disagree with you.  I feel much the same (as I imagine new
internet customers feel) every time I reprice the mobile phone market.
It is just *so* complicated to know how to compare one plan with another;
to work out which one is best for me.  It's easier to compare ISPs
because their plans are quite similar, but there are the same general
sorts of difficulties.  I do have to say that each mobile company, and
each ISP, does make their prices quite clear.  If I choose not to read
the plans then more the fool am I.
