Hi All,
    After suffering long and hard for a few weeks, I have
finally worked out what was the problem with my DNS and
Netscape, but the solution puzzles me a bit (thanks everyone
for your assistance). After trying every different server
and workstation config that I and a few others could think
of and getting nowhere the problem was fixed by setting the
manual proxy in Netscape. (BTW both Server and Workstations
WERE configured correctly to start with).

    This seems strange to me since even though proxies are
quite common, not everyone has one to use on their network,
so what happens if for some reason you WANT to connect with
direct access to the net and NOT through the proxy? I am
sure that I have done this before, and I know I have had it
working. If the Network knows how to do DNS lookups, then
why does netscape do them through the proxy (which is what
appears to be happening). I have learnt a bit about the new
security features of Linux since I last did an install (and
this is a good thing), but this just seems quite a wierd way
to do things. Any comments or ideas?
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
