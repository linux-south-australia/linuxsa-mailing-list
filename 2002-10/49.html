Dan,

&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any success / failure stories to share about Spam Assassin?
&gt; &gt; It looks like a *great* idea if it works..

Whilst I think that Spamassassin is quite good, I have the following
setup:

1) I use fetchmail to download to my FreeBSD gateway
 - it doesn't run SpamAssassin becuase I can't get it to compile yet

2) Periodically, I use fetchmail to take that from my FreeBSD box to my
Linux box
 - I have a crossover network which is presumably running 100Mbps

3) On my Linux machine (2.4.18-XFS_1.1 as built by the team at SGI)
 - it runs spamassassin under procmail:

:0
| nice -n 15 /usr/bin/spamassassin -L

 - I would use the daemon but it just sends my mail into the ether

Here comes the problem.

My Linux box keeps up if I use it to download the e-mail over my 28.8K
connection, however I run into an infamous "spawning lots of processes
kills the Linux VM and process scheduler" problem. In addition, my swap
of 512Mb becomes significantly (80%) full which surely can't help
matters. This means that all my GUI goes unresponsive and I suspect I
have IO thrashing.

I would use the daemonised version, however I can't quite work out what
is happening to my mail at all -- see another post of mine to Mark
Newton.

The -L switch, which stops all sorts of network lookups (from my
understanding of the documentation), has helped and my load average over
my download times goes from 50 (!) to about 15. 15 is still quite bad,
but a lot less than 50 I guess.

Spamassassin tags most spam although it zaps a lot of MySQL mailing list
stuff as spam which is annoying.
