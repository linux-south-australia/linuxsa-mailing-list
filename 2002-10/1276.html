have you ever read or played with this kind of stuff?  i've done a little on
PLCs talking to stuff like this in the field in my last job.  turning on
pumps, valves, taking readings etc etc.  basically it looked like this.

PC (running SCADA* software of some kind, we had a winblows one and another
on running on Sco Unix.)
|
|
PLC (programmable logic controller)
|
|
|  (loads of physical wires running out to all the solenoids which are on
the pumps/vales/etc/etc to drive them)

i didn't have a whole lot to do with the PLC to field stuff, i was on the PC
end taking info from the PLC and doing reports, etc etc..  interesting
stuff.  we did one system with about 7 PLCs up in Moomba for Stantos.  they
we're connected via radio links.

the reason i woffle about all this is because, i'm sure sure that networking
cable or TCP is designed to do this kind of stuff.  BUT, don't let me
discourage you.

it's all feasable, if you have taps or tap controllers that are networkable
with TCP (ie able to give them an IP address or something).  there's no
reason that it can't be done, but the industry standard is not TCP, put it
that way.

yeah it will be - have been toying with the idea for years.

If the signal can go down the pipe - theoretically that will allow it to be
scaled very easily and cheaply - and that's what Linux is all about -
scalability!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sounds interesting.  compared to standard water systems you'd
&gt; be breaking
&gt; into new ground transferring the signal through the water
&gt; pipe itself.  as
&gt; far as i can make out (i looked at ones from the hardware)
&gt; they have a wire
&gt; pair to each tap which goes back to the main controller.
&gt; the main controller being some kind of PLC that has the
&gt; ability to turn
&gt; things on and off in the
&gt; field.
&gt;
&gt; having said that i've never put an automated sprinkler system in, just
&gt; looked at quite a few brochures and thought 'that's not
&gt; cheap, i think i'll
&gt; go for the hand turning the tap version'  :)
&gt;
&gt; good luck, sounds like an interesting project.  especially if
&gt; you get your
&gt; sprinklers 'networked'.  sounds rather a challenge to say the
&gt; least  :)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is semi-off topic - so please refrain from the use of
&gt; high powered
&gt; flame throwers just yet (WIELDs asbestos suit just in case).
&gt;
&gt; I want to put in an automated irrigation system in the garden
&gt; and rig that
&gt; up to a Linux box.  I've looked at controllers, valves, etc
&gt; and they all
&gt; seem awfully expensive - any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; More *on topic* - what about software and interfaces?  I want it to be
&gt; 'networkable' so the standard parallel or serial connection
&gt; just won't cut
&gt; it - ideally each valve will be addressable and the signal
&gt; would go down the
&gt; water pipe somehow.  This is to allow the system to be
&gt; scalable and flexible
&gt; so that moisture and other sensors can be rigged up and
&gt; report down the
&gt; water pipe.
&gt;
&gt; Each controller may be a 'subnet' and address up to 255 (or
&gt; 254?) individual
&gt; valve and sensors or other equipment.  This would in turn
&gt; allow up to 254
&gt; (?) layers on top of this.  For now - only up to maybe 15 to
&gt; 30 valves and
&gt; sensors may be needed for a small pilot project.
&gt;
&gt; The idea is to have some open source software that will
&gt; collect information
&gt; from the environment and respond according to the parameters
&gt; given to it -
&gt; say sensor Y reports moisture below a certain level then
&gt; switch on drip feed
&gt; valve X for 1 hour, pause 20 minutes and sample again until
&gt; it returns to
&gt; 'programmed' levels.
&gt;
&gt; Reporting software would collect information on water use and the
&gt; environment and any other required information (alert for
&gt; leaking valve,
&gt; etc).
&gt;
&gt; Something like this could save *a lot* of water - but I have
&gt; no idea where
&gt; to start!  I do have a big garden some friends with small
&gt; farms that are
&gt; very interested - especially if the design can be kept very
&gt; simple, scalable
&gt; and cheap.  This is why Linux may seem like an overkill at
&gt; first - but with
&gt; the scalability and flexibility of addressable devices and
&gt; the reporting it
&gt; can bring - it seems quite reasonable to pull out an old
&gt; Pentium 133 and put
&gt; it to use.
&gt;
&gt; Any pointers or do I just think too much?
