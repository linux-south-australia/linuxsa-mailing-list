&gt; Hi David,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We've got so many charlatans waving MCSE's
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I think I have already told the story of the MCP course I was part of a 
&gt; couple of years back. I was one of the two students that helped with 
&gt; the course, ran Prac sessions etc, tutored others, and thought I had 
&gt; actually gained some real practical knowledge from it. Others spent all 
&gt; their wake time boning up on the cheats.
&gt; 
&gt; Comes the exam, two of the class failed, myself and another. He had 
&gt; much greater knowledge than me, had loads of sysadmin and real life 
&gt; experience with W2K. He is the kind of guy you should employ because he 
&gt; does the job and does it well.
&gt;
 
This sound very much as proletarian propaganda...a person with "real life" 
experience and knowledge shouldn't fail a simple test (suite).

&gt; 
&gt; Some of the class earned good scores, others just earned points for 
&gt; knowing the questions and then matching the right answer from the 
&gt; cheats they had studied. An example, one guy had no system building nor 
&gt; admin experience. He only used a WFW 3.11 system at home until we 
&gt; started the course. He had no access to any network except when 
&gt; attending the training sessions and only once did he get to build a 
&gt; network from scratch. He got almost every question right, missed only 1 
&gt; or 2! How come?

(Is there such a training course based on cheats?)

If one has the ability to learn and does that right, it is normal to get good 
results when it comes to apply the knowledge.

Florin
