&gt; The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their advertisement

Ah but there *is* a widely accepted shorthand term.  "Download" is widely
understood to mean "data from the ISP to the customer."

&gt; if I need an advanced level of technical knowledge to purchase n 
&gt; Internet connection from a newbie-targeted ISP there's something wrong.

Look, it's really quite simple.  People are NOT stupid and neither are
they guileless.  Some consumers will try anything to avoid paying for what
they bought.  They know that when they sign up to an ISP the product is
stuff delivered from the Internet.  To try to claim a mistunderstanding,
that they genuinely thought web pages, or email, or ICQ, or such, was for
free is just plain guile.  Darn, already used guile, must buy a thesaurus.
It's duplicit, artful, dishonest, deceitful, tricky, chicanery.  It's
almost fraudulent.
