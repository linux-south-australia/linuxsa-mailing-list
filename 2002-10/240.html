Hi There,

It appears that there is enough interest to create an "Open Source
Distribution Service" and I would like to invite the people who wanted
to become part of the distribution network to my place for a `pot luck'
BBQ at my place.

Anybody else is welcome to come along as well, however I would
appreciate it if people RSVP'ed me just in case my rather ample backyard
is too small to host the flocks coming :-)

 Date:  Saturday, 12 October 2002
 Time:  12 Noon - Late
 RSVP:  <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>
 Bring: Beer, soft drinks, meat, salad
 Phone: 0402 440993

If you need transport please contact me and I'll do my best to arrange
car-pooling. I'm close to two "Go Zone" bus routes so public transport
won't be a problem either. If the weather is horrible then I have a
garage and a house so I think I'll  have enough undercover space to go
ahead.

The meeting will be informal but I will probably gather everybody at
about 1:30 PM and just have a general discussion of the logistics of
what we want to achieve and the aim of what we want to achieve.  Either
I, or someone else, will take a summary of the ideas and I'll present
them to the LinuxSA list and we can get this service underway.

I look forward to meeting more of you in person.


David Lloyd
