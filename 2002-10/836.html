Whichever way you look at it - when a over 200MB/hr can be downloaded over a
512K link - with the average limit about 1 - 3 GB - it is still a matter of
concern.  That's about 1GB / 4 hours or so - a not-so-aware average Jo could
quite easily blow their limit sky high in a week and wind up paying over $30
/ hr.  A $500 excess bill is not unlikely - in fact - seems quite
reasonable.

Telstra did advertise their 'broadband' connection with a 'whopping' 300 MB
limit in the IT section of The Australian earlier this year or late last
year - I really wish I kept that add - it so pathetic it should be in a
museum.  They do give people the impression that one can watch news,
download trailers for films, etc without a worry in the world - which is
complete rubbish.

Everyone I meet from the LinuxSA group say the same thing in person but
another on the list (damn ignorant newbies) but they themselves say they
won't touch ADSL with a 50 foot barge pole when I inquire if they intend to
get it in person.

Germany, Denmark, etc have no limits with connections up to 8Mbit (I can
forward emails from a friend there if you don't believe me) - the USA is
another complex story.

Australia - the land of the lucky subsidised farmers.

&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; "We have had a number of complaints about bills for excess 
&gt; usage, which
&gt; &gt; appear to arise as a result of misunderstandings about what 
&gt; is included in
&gt; &gt; usage and what isn't," she said. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that users who are plain stupid and don't read 
&gt; or understand 
&gt; their sign-on contracts should be awarded a thing. If the 
&gt; ombudsman finds that 
&gt; an ISP/Telecommunications provider has been wilfully 
&gt; misleading then I would 
&gt; support that case.
&gt; 
&gt; But I don't particularly want to find myself in a society 
&gt; where my stupidity is 
&gt; someone else's responsibility.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; "For example, many consumers think usage only includes 
&gt; files or programs
&gt; &gt; that they download over the internet. They don't realise 
&gt; that just opening a
&gt; &gt; web page will contribute to their usage." 
&gt; 
&gt; To cover all the details I'm sure you'd need a booklet as 
&gt; large as the Bible or 
&gt; the Qu'Ran itself; I'd suggest such a booklet would be just 
&gt; as obscure and 
&gt; difficult to interpret. Just because consumers don't read 
&gt; contracts which are 
&gt; written in plain English and, if they are written in jargon 
&gt; then the consumer 
&gt; doesn't consult the ISP for clarification, doesn't excuse 
&gt; them for their 
&gt; stupidity.
&gt; 
&gt; Having seen a number of these contracts they can be 
&gt; confusing, but why would a 
&gt; consumer sign a contract they find confusing? I don't, but I 
&gt; don't consider 
&gt; myself stupid either.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The TIO advised new broadband users to check their usage 
&gt; continually. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "My theory is that the business model will have evolved, 
&gt; and it may be that
&gt; &gt; you pay differently for different types of content." 
&gt;
