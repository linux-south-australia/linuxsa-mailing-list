Whereas on contrast, in my home box, I have 3 IDE drives wedged next to
each other, no extra cooling, the case around them gets so hot you
_almost_ burn your finger on them (the seagate 7200rpm is mainly
responsible for the heat). Thats a seagate 6gb, a WD 20gb, and a seagate
7200rpm 40gb). They have all been running fine since I got them. 

Also in my server I have run out of drive bays, and have a WD 20gb
wrapped in paper, sitting loose on top of the ram slots. No problems
there in 2 years running 24/7 either. :) The thing with heat, is the
drives are designed with thermal compensation.

I think the main reason you'd use scsi is because you want more than 4
drives in the system. Hard drives seem to have existed long enough that
most the manufacturers know what they are doing now.

&gt; With SCSI, even more care needs to be taken, but that said, the benefits

&gt; atrocious with heavy file (large or small) [1] transfers but the 
&gt; reliability of SCSI (Seagate is my flavour) is justification alone for 5

&gt; [1] Try this: Copy a large directory containing many small files and a 
&gt; few large (&gt;200Mb) files between disks on an ATA system noting the time 
&gt; and the cpu load (ie response to other processes) then do the same with 
&gt; SCSI drives. If you take the trouble to do this you will never build 
&gt; another server with ATA drives again.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The fact that most SCSI drives come with 5yr warrenty vs 6months
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;/1 year for OEM IDE drives.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;I beg to differ!  You certainly can get a 1 year warranty on hard
&gt; &gt;&gt;drives but 3 years is what we get on all our drives (unless we opt
&gt; &gt;&gt;for 1 year - which we don't).  Most of our drives are well and
&gt; &gt;&gt;truly cycled by three years.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ahh warrenty is irrelevant when comparing between SCSI and IDE drives, the
&gt; &gt; figure you both should be concentrating on is Mean Time Between Failture
&gt; &gt; (MTBF).   Undoubtly the IDE drives are fast approaching the speed of the
&gt; &gt; SCSI disks, but leave a IDE drive running 24/7 on average for more than 2-3
&gt; &gt; years and they will die why ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Looking at the 10k Seagate SCSI drives they have a *spec'd*  MTBF of
&gt; &gt; 1.2x10^6 hours or 50,000 days continous operation (136 years by my
&gt; &gt; calculator), but this is not taking into account poor (note crap) air
&gt; &gt; circulation around the drives in many pre-rolled servers.   This is many
&gt; &gt; times the length of the SCSI warrenty period, like over 27 times.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You will *not* find this information on the Seagate site [1] for their
&gt; &gt; ATA100 drives, so one would have to assume 8760 hrs (1 year) which is many
&gt; &gt; times less than the SCSI (~136x).   If you were to use your PC for 4 hours
&gt; &gt; every day then with a MTBF for IDE drives of 8760 hrs the drive would last
&gt; &gt; approximately 6 years which seems about right in my personal experience.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You will get IDE drives that exceed the MTBF, these are the exception or
&gt; &gt; what is commonly called "Wednesday Afternoon" drives where the quality of
&gt; &gt; the drives produced seems to miraculously increase for some reason.   So
&gt; &gt; IDE drives may last *7 years continous* but you cannot be guarenteed of
&gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So if you consider rolling out IDE RAID servers for *real* production use
&gt; &gt; aim at replacing the entire array every 12months, this will give you the
&gt; &gt; added advantage of boosting the array size as drive capacities keep
&gt; &gt; increasing.   Otherwise roll out a SCSI array which you will have to
&gt; &gt; replace in around 5-7 years, mainly due to lack of available storage.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For a home server you have the option of replacing drives or turning the
&gt; &gt; machine off, the choice is up to you.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; [1] or many of the other manufacturers sites, that is not to say that I
&gt; &gt; went and checked every one.
