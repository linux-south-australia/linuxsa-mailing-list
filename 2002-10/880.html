Hi All,

&lt;2.2c worth (inc GST)&gt;

    I think that everybody here is just missing the point.
Why do Australian telcos have a download cap at all? Why do
they have such exorbitant fees at all? Basically because
they can. It seems that the major providers in Australia are
getting away with murder with crap service, crap product and
raking it in because the public don't know any better and
accept all this because of it, and the government, who are
just as naive let the telcos get away with it.

    If we lived in Canada, or the US or Ireland or somewhere
where they do have good service, then we would have no
download limit, be paying on average AUD$30 per month, and
have installation and after sales support at a realisic
level.

    This is not a function of 'oh but they have more people
there to service the network'. Telstra have the
infrastructure in place already and have had it for at least
5 years, but they have too many internal sub-companies
competeing against each other to get their act together. As
an example of this:

    I get bombarded with broadband advertising from telstra
constantly. $55 for a "permanent" broadband connection (but
no permanent IP addresses) and 20 times faster than dialup
(set by law at the moment to mean 19.2k, not up to 56k many
people get on a modem), and I get to keep my telephone line
and pay no extra for rental. This is for Bigpond Broadband
(different from Bigpond which is dial-in).

    I have a Bigpond Direct (note another sub-company) PSTN
dedicated modem link with 64 IP addresses. Now after being
snowed with the broadband advertising and doing the numbers,
it turned out that for about an extra $5 per month I should
be able to upgrade my link to broadband for $200 install and
ongoing $55 per month and triple my download limit. Sounds
great and affordable so I contacted Bigpond Direct,
explained what I wanted to do and was told that "Oh no sir,
that is Bigpond Broadband, not Bigpond Direct". The best
that Direct could offer me was to upgrade to ISDN for $800
install, pay $150 per month for access (three times the
present costs) and get a massive 20% (not 20 times) faster
access.

    So I went to Bigpond Broadband - "sorry sir, could you
explain the difference between static and dynamic IP
allocation again? We would love to sell you broadband, but
we are a different part of Telstra to Direct and we do
things differently". Please note that Bigpond Broadband for
Business is a different sub-company again and couldn't do
any better either.

    Now this kind of service is crap. Why should the same
company be able to give the public such a great deal but
screw businesses to the wall. Now I don't mind paying a
small amount extra for the privelege of having static IPs,
but I want value for money as well. Why is it that overseas
I can get similar deals for a permanent site as I can for a
non-permanent site. Why isn't the government (who is pro
business remember) looking after my rights as a consumer and
allowing me to be able to compete with the general public.
If the government wasn't so interested in getting their
dividends out of Telstra then they would stop this internal
competition crap and get a good deal going at an affordable
level for all and make their money by bulk selling to
everybody.

    Now I can hear a few of you out there sniggering about
Telstra (see that is why we left them and went elsewhere).
Well I might point out that Cable & Wireless (Optus) is one
of the biggest telcos in the world and does have the kind of
service mentioned overseas, but are they any better? A
little cheaper maybe (but they don't have to support the
competition that Telstra does by legislation - they are the
competition), but is the service any better - NO. Is the
product any better - NO. Why don't they compete? Because
they can suck heaps of money out of the consumers who don't
know any better and the government doesn't force them to do
better.

    I think we should applaud the watchdog for at least
trying to do something about the crap everything the telcos
are serving us as consumers. I don't agree with everything
that the watchdogs do, but at least we should be doing
something to help educate them and get the system working
and educate and lobby the government to do the same.

&lt;/2.2c worth (inc GST)&gt;

    Cheers!
        Andrew.
