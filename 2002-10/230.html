Good points. So next time we get a distro, and feel like someone
deserves something, we should have a look at the software in the distro,
pick an Australian author of a good part of the distro, and send $50
there way. It'll suprise them when they get it. Still be $au, and wont
have cost more than the box set of the distro that nobody seems to want
anyway. It wouldnt take many people doing it to ensure that Australian
open source developers keep developing, and might get a few more in to
it as well.

&gt; Local contributions is a great idea - do Mandrake / Red Hat have groups in
&gt; Australia that could benefit?
&gt; 
&gt; It's also a good idea because our farm / mining based economy has trashed

&gt; 
&gt; At least if we keep it in the country - what little we raise will still be
&gt; worth something - which it won't be the moment it leaves our shores - plus
&gt; it is nice to keep money in the country - especially today when all we
&gt; export is what we can find in the ground (maybe we can change that by
&gt; contributing to our local IT development).

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sending money to doubtless very worthy causes is one way of 
&gt; &gt; doing things.
&gt; &gt; Nearly all the causes I have seen mentioned are overseas ones. And yet
&gt; &gt; Australia has an extraordinarily rich collection of core 
&gt; &gt; developers and
&gt; &gt; fringe adder-oners, people the distribution makers cannot do without.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps the same ends could be served by moving the cash 
&gt; &gt; around locally? I
&gt; &gt; suspect it would have very much greater impact.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are dozens and dozens of people churning out code around the
&gt; &gt; country, even a good few in Adelaide. Don't underestimate the
&gt; &gt; encouragement value of chunk of cash sufficient to buy a new microwave
&gt; &gt; oven or bicyle or something. I've known this sort of a 
&gt; &gt; donation to keep
&gt; &gt; interest up in open source projects which have made a big 
&gt; &gt; difference. (No
&gt; &gt; details avail.)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Allocating donations is very hard when it gets more 
&gt; &gt; formalised because of
&gt; &gt; the amorphous nature of open source. I learnt that many years 
&gt; &gt; ago when (as
&gt; &gt; an external consultant) I wrote the documentation surrounding 
&gt; &gt; the Linux
&gt; &gt; International Development Grant Fund and watched it in action 
&gt; &gt; for a while.
&gt; &gt; There were some guidelines, but it all got pretty torturous 
&gt; &gt; and although
&gt; &gt; they did some good things LI ended up winding down the scheme 
&gt; &gt; because of
&gt; &gt; the difficulties it faced in its then-form.
