&gt; Quoting Troy Davis &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tdavis@comstech.com">tdavis@comstech.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt; I am about to build a server for web, mail and DNS using Red Hat Linux
&gt; &gt; My Questions are...
&gt; &gt; 1. Should I go buy the greatest P4 1.8gig system or stay lower end say
&gt; &gt; celeron
&gt; &gt; 2. What main board would people find they have least hassles with for a
&gt; &gt; Intel solution

Anything not made by PC Chips :-)  Reputable motherboard manufactures
include AOpen, ASUS, MSI (Microstar), Gigabyte, Intel themselves, etc. 
If you're using an on-board network card, just make sure it's supported
under your chosen OS (it most likely will be under RH 7.3 or 8.0)

&gt; &gt; 3. Red Hat 8 seems to be much better for desktop use, Would it also be
&gt; &gt; better as a server than say Red hat 7.3
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Do you want to future-proof your investment?  Buy the best you can 
&gt; (especially I/O if it's going to be a server).

Future proof?  You have got to be joking.  My rule of thumb is to buy
one or two steps less than the best.  It'll be a *bit* slower.  Then, in
12 months time you can use the money you saved to upgrade to something
better than you ever could have bought when you started.

I realise this benchmark is based on real-world Windows desktop
performance, but even so...

Anything you buy at the moment will most likely be overpowered for the
tasks you describe (web, mail, DNS) unless you're serving many, many
users who send many, many porn attachments to each other.  There's
nothing wrong with it being overpowered, it just means you don't need to
go silly buying "the best"

As others have stated, disk i/o is more likely to be your bottleneck.

&gt; 2. RH 8 has several different "types" of installation.  One of them 
&gt; is "desktop", but another is "server".  I would be installing the latest (RH8) 
&gt; as it'll have the latest software =&gt; no patches (yet) to be applied for 
&gt; security.  If you go with RH7.3 (or any other distro released &gt; 6 months ago), 
&gt; you'll have quite a bit of patching to make it secure.
