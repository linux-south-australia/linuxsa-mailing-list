Here is my opinion as to why Linux is inherently secure.  It is formed 
from a quote from Steven Crocker "Internet Pioneer", being interviewed 
about the recent DDOS "attack on the Internet."

<A HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,75350,00.html">http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,75350,00.html</A>

&gt; As part of tightening up the basic DNS system, we need to deploy the 
&gt; DNS security protocol [DNSSEC, a security protocol intended to improve 
&gt; data origin authentication] and create a wider set of implementations 
&gt; of BIND [the Internet Software Consortium's Berkeley Internet Name 
&gt; Domain server software used for DNS]. I hasten to add that lack of 
&gt; diversity is not actively causing any harm, and the main reason for 
&gt; wanting diverse implementations is general good practice.
&gt;
So, by implication, if there were 5 open source type Apache projects, 
"scalper" would not be as much of an issue, or perhaps, it wouldn't have 
been created.

Enter the diversity of the desktop. With choice of desktop environment, 
web browser, email clients, and applications, coupled with a kernel that 
requires a password and complicated compilation process, it would be a 
miracle if anyone could write a piece of malware that could scale this 
diversity.  Apache is one of the few Linux applications that has enough 
presence and exposure to spread a piece of malware systematically, and 
so, malware has been made for it.

Just my two cents, plus sales tax.
