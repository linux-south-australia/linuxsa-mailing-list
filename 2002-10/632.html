Screens? You only need one screen, and a network connection :)

Yep. I have an asus v3800 TNT2 ultra where the fan started sounding
stuffed 2 years ago. Then was intermittent, then just plain stopped
about 1.5 years ago. I left it on 24/7 anyway figureing I'd replace it
when it died, and it worked fine untill about 3 months ago when black
bars started appearing accross the picture. I replaced it last night
with a GF4 :) The fan (Or what was left of it) basically fell to bits
when I touched it! Even when it was connected it could wobble about 30
degrees each way! No wonder it couldnt spin. I payed close to $500 for
it when it came out too! What a rip off... :(
