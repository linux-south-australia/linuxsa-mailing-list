Hi All,
     The South Australian Chapter of The Australian Unix User Group 
(AUUG) is pleased to be able to host a special guest presentation by the 
famous Richard Sharpe.

Richard Sharpe is an open source software participant who has worked on
packages like Samba and Ethereal, and who lived in Adelaide from 1984
until 2001.

Since leaving Adelaide, he has worked at Panasas, Inc, one of the
hopeful new breed of Network Attached Storage companies in the US.
During that time he has worked on integrating Samba into Panasas'
vision, which has involved modifications to Samba to handle a richer ACL
environment, as well as integrating sendfile (and recvfile, a new
syscall under FreeBSD) into Samba with a goal of improving throughput in
NAS environments. He has also worked on tasks like pushing SIDs into the
FreeBSD kernel to improve  the performance of such fundamental
operations as checking group  ownership in a file system that tries to
provide both Windows and UNIX  functionality.

Richard's talk will introduce you to what Panasas is trying to build
and then will discuss Richard's experiences in working for Panasas. It
will also provide information on what is coming in Samba 3.0.0 and will
discuss the benefits of having commercial enterprises using and supporting
Open Source Software as well as present a perspective on the power of
Open Source Software.
