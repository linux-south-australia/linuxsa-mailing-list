Thanks Adam,
We also block .chs (compiled help), vbs, vbe plus a pile of others i can't
remember and can't be bothred looking at the server.

We didn't get burnt by this latest one but we we're rushing to get the
latest AV definitions.

We allow anything inside .zip files with the thought that you can't
autoexecute a .zip file to execure a virus.  at least not yet.  :)

regards
M

Subject: RE: Text of virus infected email - Bugbear



&gt; While on this subject i have two questions:
&gt;
&gt; How many people run mail servers (corporate ones, not isp
&gt; ones obviously) that block .exe files?

Definitely.

I don't even let them do it internally (considering any EXE file could
have been brought in *externally* and then forwarded via email
*internally*.

Every time they get an EXE file in their email it is stripped out, and
they are informed that EXE files are not allowed to be brought in via
email.  The main reason is *EVERYONE* here uses Outlook, and I'm afraid
I'm just not comfortable with the fact that a user can just load up an
EXE file and have it execute from their attachments.  The sender of the
message is also informed that the EXE file was blocked and they should
resend it inside a zip file.

That gives a level of protection by making sure a user can at least
*see* what they are opening before they open it.

Has anyone here ever figured out why Microsoft enabled a feature that
allows you to turn off file extensions?  The amount of times I see files
called rubbish.doc.doc is incredible.  And on top of that, it's no
wonder files like executeme.doc.exe are so commonly used in these
exploits.

What a load of rubbish.exe.com.bat.js.dll.btm.cmd.pif
