That's great - but remember when international phone calls cost like $3 - $9
/ a minute or something ridiculous?  Very few people used that service then
too.  Then came in competition and now people can afford to call the grand
kiddies overseas.  If only mobile phones would come down!!!

Nothing is unlimited - but I do wonder how 10 - 20c / MB will help our
national economy grow.

&gt; &gt;The problem is that an ISP will say "download" in their 
&gt; advertisement when they 
&gt; &gt;mean "data from the ISP to the customer". As I said before, 
&gt; it's unfortunate 
&gt; &gt;that there's not a widely accepted shorthand term for this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Not every ISP advertises 'downloads', some go out of their 
&gt; way to avoid 
&gt; the use of the word to avoid customer confusion. If the customer 
&gt; understands that when the lights flicker on their modem it's 
&gt; adding to 
&gt; their usage, then they probably won't have a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; The underlying problem is the amount of damage you can do to 
&gt; your bank 
&gt; account in a short amount of time with a broadband service;
&gt; 
&gt; Leave your tap on flat out for an hour, and it might use a megalitre. 
&gt; Costs you less than a dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; Leave your oven on for an hour, and it might use a 
&gt; kilowatt-hour. Costs 
&gt; you less than a dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; Call up Canada on a weekday evening and leave it off hook for 
&gt; an hour. 
&gt; Costs you less than $30.
&gt; 
&gt; Run your 512K ADSL connection flat out for an hour, and 
&gt; you're probably 
&gt; up for less than $40 in excess charges, if you had already used your 
&gt; plan's quota.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone understands that an International call is going to cost when 
&gt; you spend a long time on the phone, but very few people seem to 
&gt; appreciate that using the Internet requires international 
&gt; infrastructure. In fact, it uses a whole lot more of it. Yet 
&gt; I don't see 
&gt; any outcry demanding unlimited phone calls to the USA for $25 
&gt; per month.
