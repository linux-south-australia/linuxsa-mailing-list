Hi,
	i have had some experience with these boards and linux and so far been
unsuccessful in getting it to work. From what i have read on the matter,
unless you need to run windows on the machine aswell, your best bet is to
turn the raid off(ATA MODE), and use linux software RAID which performs much
faster than the promise emulation. Because the Promise fasttrack is the RAID
equivilent of a winmodem, dont use it unless you have no other choice. Also,
the best setup is to have 1 hdd per promise chain and keep all other ide
devices on the standard mainboard controller.

hope this helps.

Subject: Promise IDE Raid 100 w/ RH 8.0??


Has anybody tried redhat 8.0 with a promise IDE RAID lite 100 (and whatever
else it's called) controller?  the latest download only talks about 7.3 but
i want to put on 8.0

tried doing all the bits it told me to but it doesn't see the controller.
i've got it setup as a RAID 1 which is all cool, but it detects as two ide
drives.  no probs, the readme talks about that, but still doesn't help me
much.

Here's the readme in case you gurus can point me in the right direction.  I
have to do the 'With IDE issue' and type all the extra woffle down the
bottom which tells linux not to detect but what it is, i take it.

In case you are wondering it's the gigabyte GA-6VXDR7 mother, tho i would
have thought it'd matter.

also i have looked on promise's site and found:

<A HREF="http://www.promise.com/support/linux2_eng.asp?mode">http://www.promise.com/support/linux2_eng.asp?mode</A>=linux_download&product_id
=15

but they don't have 8.0 listed.  Obviously it's been out for a week or so,
but it'd be nice to get this going rather than have to reload/upgrade it
later one.

Sorry for the long post.  ava good one.

Matt
