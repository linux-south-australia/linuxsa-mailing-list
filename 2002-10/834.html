Quoting <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>:

&gt; &gt; "We have had a number of complaints about bills for excess usage, which
&gt; &gt; appear to arise as a result of misunderstandings about what is included in
&gt; &gt; usage and what isn't," she said. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that users who are plain stupid and don't read or understand 
&gt; their sign-on contracts should be awarded a thing. If the ombudsman finds
&gt; that 
&gt; an ISP/Telecommunications provider has been wilfully misleading then I would
&gt; support that case.

When non-Internet people think of downloading, they think of clicking 
the "Download" link and pulling down a file. They /don't/ think of how much 
browsing is costing them, or what the gazillion spyware programs on their PC 
are doing, or of how much porn their husband is watching. Is real-time 
streaming downloading? How about online shopping?

This sort of think isn't immediately obvious to people who don't understand the 
underlying protocols.

Now, the ISP isn't being deliberately misleading, but the user isn't "stupid" 
either.

"3000 megabytes of inbound data a month!" doesn't mean very much to most users, 
which makes an ISP's job significantly more difficult when preparing 
advertising.

&gt; Having seen a number of these contracts they can be confusing, but why would
&gt; a 
&gt; consumer sign a contract they find confusing? I don't, but I don't consider 
&gt; myself stupid either.

Because they want their Internet access and don't have personal lawyers or 
geeks on hand.
