Hmmmm....

&gt; When non-Internet people think of downloading, they think of clicking 
&gt; the "Download" link and pulling down a file. They /don't/ think of how much 
&gt; browsing is costing them, or what the gazillion spyware programs on their PC

Well, SeNet, Chariot, Adam and Internode all seem to define what download is 
reasonably well and not in small print.

&gt; Now, the ISP isn't being deliberately misleading, but the user isn't "stupid"
&gt; either.

I take your point, but to it still doesn't put them in the best position. 
Simply because one is ignorant doesn't justify what one does.

&gt; &gt; Having seen a number of these contracts they can be confusing, but why
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; a 
&gt; &gt; consumer sign a contract they find confusing? I don't, but I don't consider
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; myself stupid either.
&gt; 
&gt; Because they want their Internet access and don't have personal lawyers or 
&gt; geeks on hand.

Hmmmm...so we should just sign a document because we don't have lawyers or 
experts on hand? That sounds a little irresponsible don't you think?
