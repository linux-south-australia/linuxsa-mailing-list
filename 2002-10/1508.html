&gt;ISP's can't share or link up mirrors can they?  I agree that it does seem

&gt;does seem like a terrible waste to have each ISP suck down 10's of gigabytes

Sure they can share mirrors. The ISP's at ADNAP have been putting 
resources into filearena.net[1] for exactly this reason. At the moment 
there's just the tucows mirror there (tucows.filearena.net), but there 
is a new server with over 600G of disk on the way that will also host 
FreeBSD and Debian mirrors, along with whatever else looks popular.

This is available freely to ISP's on SAIX as well.

The 'sharing' part isn't entirely simple, as some of the ISP's connected 
to SAIX have customers in states other than SA. So while it wouldn't 
cost them any more than their own mirrors to deliver the data to local 
customers, it wouldn't be consistent to allow it just to Adelaide residents.

It looks like Internode just got a tucows mirror going themselves in the 
last few days. It doesn't have the linux files yet, but given the 
bandwidth restrictions on some of the tucows master sites, it's only a 
matter of time (it took weeks to get the full tucows the first time we 
did it).

Also worthy of mention is ozbytes.net.au, hosted by Senet. It's not as 
great as it once was, but it still has a lot of mirrored data.

[1] The same ISP's have been somewhat distracted putting resources into 
gamingsa.com, but they're getting there :)
