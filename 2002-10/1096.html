MS profits more than double 
Helen Jung 
OCTOBER 18, 2002 	
	
MICROSOFT'S profits more than doubled from a year ago as a new,
controversial software licensing plan helped drive sales and insulate the
company from the turmoil hitting the technology industry.

The software giant also was able to stem losses from investments. 

For the three months ended September 30, the software maker had a profit of
$US2.73 billion ($5.06 billion), or US50c a share, compared to net earnings
of $US1.28 billion, or US23c a share, for the same period a year ago. 

The results included one-time charges of $US291 million, or US5c a share,
related to weakness in Microsoft's investments. A year earlier, Microsoft
wrote down $US1.2 billion on investments. 

Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter revenue totalled $US7.75 billion, up 27 per
cent from $US6.1 billion in sales a year ago.

The company surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call had a consensus estimate of US43c a share on revenue of
$US7.1 billion. 

Microsoft cited a higher-than-expected enrollment in new, subscription-like
licensing plans that require companies to sign multiyear agreements and pay
annual fees in return for rights to software upgrades. The new plans also
eliminate many discounts that companies could receive when they chose to
upgrade. 

"It was a blowout," said Scott McAdams, chief executive of Seattle-based
investment research firm McAdams Wright Ragen. 

"We haven't seen a quarter like this in years," he said, attributing the
strong results to the deadline for companies to adopt the new licensing
agreements. 

But with the deadline past, coming quarters probably won't see that
strength, he said. 

"The bad news is it may not be sustainable," Mr McAdams said. 

The company also announced Windows XP sales have hit 67 million since the
new operating system was launched in October 2001. It also saw strong
increases in revenue for its MSN internet access service, as well as a 14
per cent jump in sales for its server software and related products. 

Microsoft shares closed up US36c Thursday at $US50.77 on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Shares went up $US2.44 a share in extended trading after Microsoft
released its first-quarter results.
