&gt; My company, DNA Pty Ltd, first used skills examinations as part of
&gt; standard recruitment procedures way back in the first half of the 1990's
&gt; (I guess you'd call that late 20th century! :-) Anybody can sit the exam,
&gt; which is tailored for each position, and interviews are only conducted
&gt; afterwards.  The reason for this policy is that interviews are social
&gt; affairs which favour bright personalities.  Some jobs need a bright
&gt; personality (e.g. selling), but for technical positions it's a shame
&gt; when the best person misses out simply because of social awkwardness.
&gt; Tellurian Pty Ltd, a company that I co-founded, adopted this same policy.
&gt; A sample exam (which I think I might have written) can be found at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/exam.shtml.">http://www.tellurian.com.au/exam.shtml.</A>

While I think that the concept of testing candidates is good, I am not 
sure that a written test like that would be of much use.

I write code every day. Last week I created a system call to push SIDs 
into the FreeBSD kernel, and wrote new VFS routine stubs for our file 
system, and tested them, and today I modified Samba to create the correct 
data structures and call the system call I created last week. 

I also figured out why we were getting data corruption when a program 
created a read only file opened for writing, (open("file", 
O_CREAT|O_WRONLY, 0544)) with setreuid surrounding the open.

However, I would not be able to write down on paper a program that places 
a connection or accepts a connection (even though I have done that in the 
past) without heavy reference to the man pages.

Indeed, I think such exercises should be done on-line. The way I develop 
code is to do it on-line. Of course a whole bunch of other things need to 
be worried about, like portability, GPL issues etc.

I do think that the RHCE test is very good, in that they give you a broken 
machine and you have to figure out the problem and fix it, and they give 
you a spec and ask you to create it.

In addition, I would criticize a question that asks what the following 
does:

    false && true && echo 1 || true && false && \
        echo 2 || false || true || echo 3 && echo 4 && echo 5

Not because I couldn't figure it out [1], but because it is not a common 
idiom, while people are going to come across something like:

[ -f /etc/sysconfig/desktop ] || (echo "You need to create it; exit)

And should know precisely what is going on here and should be able to name 
the general concept, and so on.

[1] With a bit of experiment, it is possible to figure out what is going 
on.
