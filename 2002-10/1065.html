&gt; You're right, of course, it's not a read receipt; it's a display receipt.

Part of the problem is that; the end users, bless their tiny brains, are
convinced that read receipt means the recipient has read the email.

&gt; Normally one would think that displaying is equivalent to reading, but
&gt; that's not necessarily so with automatic preview, even given the default
&gt; of five second before Outlook marks the message as read and presumably
&gt; then sends the read receipt.  Mind you, five seconds is an awfully long
&gt; time to not read the preview pane.

Ever been interrupted while reading an email?  (Happens all the time in
a support environment)

Ever had an email that was larger than the preview pane?  (You can't have
possibly read the entire email).

Ever had an email with documents attached?  (You can't have possibly even
opened up the corresponding application by the time the receipt has gone
back).

The receipt should at least come at the *end* of the event, not at
the beginning.

&gt; Of course sensibly paranoid users disable auto-previewing because of
&gt; the nasty javascript macros and such, that run just because of preview.
&gt; Problem solved.

And of course, people in corporate environments don't get that choice,
because it's forced down on them from an SOE and locked down (witness
people who are unable to switch off HTML for Exchange).

&gt; As Richard mooted, we
&gt; do need some sort of iron-clad guarantee that a message has been read.
&gt; If not read receipts then what?

Perhaps DSN, but that's almost as inappropriate - it doesn't guarantee
that an email has reached the client, only the penultimate MTA.

&gt; I'm keenly interested in the user interface metaphor that you would develop.

I wouldn't.  I'm on record as being against it, which means "not for it".
Anti-, you might say.
