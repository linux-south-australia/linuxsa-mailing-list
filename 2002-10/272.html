The Bugbear worm is a pain even for Linux admins. It forges the senders
address by combining names and domain names from the infected persons PC.

For example an infected user has the name <A HREF="mailto:jblow@company.com">jblow@company.com</A> and another
address of <A HREF="mailto:wally@microsoft.com">wally@microsoft.com</A>

The infected email it send out might have the "senders address" of
<A HREF="mailto:jblow@microsoft.com">jblow@microsoft.com</A>
We have been quarantining infected emails the last 3 days in ever increasing
numbers. Every time we get one a message is trying to be sent to the sender
to inform them their PC has a virus/worm. These are ALL bouncing back as no
such user
( undeliverable ).
Whilst the worm doesnt directly cause any damage to Linux machines, it must
be causing some disruption to email servers.

The Subject and body of email is very random.

Attachment names are all double extensions such as these ( real examples )

error.log.scr
mpie4ful.exe.exe
My Money.mny.exe
TO.doc.exe
Biz1Logo.jsp.scr
RECORDS.XLS.scr
resume2000.doc.scr

Subject name is Random and Body of the infected email is also randomly
picked from the infected PC ( I saw one yesterday that would have been
confidential ).

Regards,

Michael

&gt;Hi James,
&gt;
&gt;Well, actually, not quite. Not really.
&gt;
&gt;What the virus is doing, is taking random documents and emailing them
&gt;between addresses in the infected computer's address book (MS of course)
&gt;
&gt;
Just some ideas...

...fuzzy thoughts ...

....the body of message appears to be coherent enough to not have been
randomly generated...

....does that mean that the text was copied off of a machine...?

....does it mean that the computer the text was copied from is infected
in some way...?

....if so the only way to warn the person is to let them see what was
copied....they will then realize...

...'hey that's my message! I didn't send that to Leone!....

Anyway...I tried

&gt;The viruses (virii?) I have seen in the last couple of days have had many
&gt;different documents and email attachments, some have been the same, but
&gt;probably because they came from the same infected computer. Many have had
&gt;attachments like documentxyz.doc.pif which hides the virus payload for our
&gt;unsuspecting outlook users.
&gt;
&gt;By nature the content of the virus generated email will be different for
&gt;every infection.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;

&gt;&gt;If anybody received an email that looked like this, well, you have a
&gt;&gt;virus. A virus infected email was sent this way.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This was the visual part of the message.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Any progress on this?
&gt;&gt;&gt;If not then perhaps I should return the book and CDs and get my money
&gt;&gt;&gt;back.
