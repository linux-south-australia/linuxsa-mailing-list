I beg to differ on loosing an IDE drive every 15 - 18 months my servers both
run 24/7 and the only problem i have had was an initial mechanical failure
with the drive which was swiftly replaced by the manufacturer, maybe you
were looking at the wrong brands, because 18 months is not alot of time, i
have seen servers last over 4 years running permenantly using raid mirroring
that have not replaced a single drive (the workload on these servers are
remarkably high considering they are a school system)

my 2 cents worth also

&gt; For many years I have run my server 24/7. On average I would lose an ATA
&gt; drive every 15/18 months. I overclock so I take particular care about
&gt; cooling, mounting the drives vertically and having a fan placed to
&gt; provide laminar flow (keeping in mind flow polarity within the chassis).
&gt; With SCSI, even more care needs to be taken, but that said, the benefits
&gt; of SCSI preclude me from even contemplating ATA. The CPU load on ATA is
&gt; atrocious with heavy file (large or small) [1] transfers but the
&gt; reliability of SCSI (Seagate is my flavour) is justification alone for 5
&gt; 9's uptime.
&gt;
&gt; My 2.2c worth (GST Inc)
&gt;
&gt; Luke
&gt;
&gt; [1] Try this: Copy a large directory containing many small files and a
&gt; few large (&gt;200Mb) files between disks on an ATA system noting the time
&gt; and the cpu load (ie response to other processes) then do the same with
&gt; SCSI drives. If you take the trouble to do this you will never build
&gt; another server with ATA drives again.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The fact that most SCSI drives come with 5yr warrenty vs 6months

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I beg to differ!  You certainly can get a 1 year warranty on hard
&gt; &gt;&gt;drives but 3 years is what we get on all our drives (unless we opt
&gt; &gt;&gt;for 1 year - which we don't).  Most of our drives are well and
&gt; &gt;&gt;truly cycled by three years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ahh warrenty is irrelevant when comparing between SCSI and IDE drives,
the
&gt; &gt; figure you both should be concentrating on is Mean Time Between Failture
&gt; &gt; (MTBF).   Undoubtly the IDE drives are fast approaching the speed of the
&gt; &gt; SCSI disks, but leave a IDE drive running 24/7 on average for more than
2-3
&gt; &gt; years and they will die why ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looking at the 10k Seagate SCSI drives they have a *spec'd*  MTBF of
&gt; &gt; 1.2x10^6 hours or 50,000 days continous operation (136 years by my
&gt; &gt; calculator), but this is not taking into account poor (note crap) air
&gt; &gt; circulation around the drives in many pre-rolled servers.   This is many
&gt; &gt; times the length of the SCSI warrenty period, like over 27 times.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You will *not* find this information on the Seagate site [1] for their
&gt; &gt; ATA100 drives, so one would have to assume 8760 hrs (1 year) which is
many
&gt; &gt; times less than the SCSI (~136x).   If you were to use your PC for 4
hours
&gt; &gt; every day then with a MTBF for IDE drives of 8760 hrs the drive would
last
&gt; &gt; approximately 6 years which seems about right in my personal experience.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You will get IDE drives that exceed the MTBF, these are the exception or
&gt; &gt; what is commonly called "Wednesday Afternoon" drives where the quality
of
&gt; &gt; the drives produced seems to miraculously increase for some reason.   So
&gt; &gt; IDE drives may last *7 years continous* but you cannot be guarenteed of
&gt; &gt; this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So if you consider rolling out IDE RAID servers for *real* production
use
&gt; &gt; aim at replacing the entire array every 12months, this will give you the
&gt; &gt; added advantage of boosting the array size as drive capacities keep
&gt; &gt; increasing.   Otherwise roll out a SCSI array which you will have to
&gt; &gt; replace in around 5-7 years, mainly due to lack of available storage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For a home server you have the option of replacing drives or turning the
&gt; &gt; machine off, the choice is up to you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers

&gt; &gt; [1] or many of the other manufacturers sites, that is not to say that I
&gt; &gt; went and checked every one.
