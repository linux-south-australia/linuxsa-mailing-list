Yep, the Internode mirror servers are un-metered for Internode 
ADSL/SDSL customers.

See <A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net/htm/un-metered-sites-info.htm">http://adsl.internode.on.net/htm/un-metered-sites-info.htm</A>

&gt;I will just pray that Internode expand the mirror past a few select ISO
&gt;images that are really only useful when upgrading (and then damn useful) and
&gt;software that comes with those distros anyway unless it's for updates too.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;hint hint hint&gt;

The mirrors were only released to our customer base on Friday of last 
week! Give us a chance :)

I'll also note that the Internode mirrors are nationally distributed, 
so that our customers in every state have the same fast access to 
them. This is way beyond 'just' being a SA service. So the benefits 
are far wider spread than SAIX, but with no loss of performance 
(and/or increase in expense) due to inter-capital data transfer 
issues. See <A HREF="http://mirror.internode.on.net">http://mirror.internode.on.net</A>

We are actually considering opening the SA mirror up to general 
access (haven't decided that for certain yet) for various good 
reasons, possibly subject to some capacity constraints.

We've also got other things in our 'un-metered' list, most 
significantly our very very popular games server farm 
(<A HREF="http://games.internode.on.net">http://games.internode.on.net</A>) - which is available across SAIX to 
customers of other ISPs as well, of course. Whether that access is 
'un-metered' or not depends on your individual ISP.

I'll note that we've been hosting and paying all the bandwidth costs 
for ftp.netcraft.com.au (a nationally significant RedHat server site) 
for quite some time now, just because we're nice people (it sure 
isn't an income source for us!)

In many ways, the mirror servers are an outgrowth of that support, 
using it as a catalyst to do something really positive for our 
national customer base and (as a non-accidental side effect), also 
serving to relieve some of the extreme load and pressure on both 
server and intercapital link resources caused by the release of 
RedHat 8 :)

Yes, these -are- mirror servers. They automagically mirror all the 
updates from all of these various distributions. As and when new 
stuff appears on those sites, it magically appears on our mirrors too.
