I forgot to mention that the DNS problem goes away when you combine all
the config files into the one httpd.conf and remove the other conf files
from the directory. 

There are a few other changes with this version of Apache - it's well
worth checking up on what it can do from the apache site.  



&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; I just bought RedHat 5.2 from Netcraft (Beautiful scenery down there
&gt; BTW:)  ) and have it installed on my server machine, but I'm having some
&gt; fun getting it configured. Whenever I start httpd (I have 8 virtual host
&gt; entries in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file) it is telling me that
&gt; they all overlap with the one above, and the first entry overlaps with
&gt; the last. It suggests using NameVirtualHost, but I can't find any info
&gt; on this anywhere where I look. Any ideas? The RedHat documentation says
&gt; it is apache version 1.3
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I am having fun with the DNS setup as well. It doesn't seem to be
&gt; working. httpd says it can't resolve the virtual host names, which I
&gt; know are all in my named files. How can I check if named is actually
&gt; working and running? nslookup times out. Could it be because I have a
&gt; statip internet IP address which is used in the named files, but the
&gt; machine isn't logged on so it can't see that IP??  (And just when I
&gt; thought I had DNS down pat too... BTW... I *should* be at the meeting
&gt; tonight...)

Look forward to meeting you then!  :-)

Cheers,
Gaelyne
