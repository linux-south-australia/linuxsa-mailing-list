Just on the subject of video cards...
I've always disliked S3 cards with a passion, but I'm probably biassed in
this, and I'm not going into it. Suffice to say I won't use them in my
machines.
I also dislike Trident's, for similar historical reasons, and I wouldn't buy
one today for anyone at all.
Cirrus Logic have usually proved to be reliable cards, but rather lacking in
performance.
Matrox cards seem fairly good, but support is sometimes lacking, and they
are too exspensive for what they are.
Tseng Labs cards I 'believe in', and I tend to use these cards. Around the
time the ET4000/w32p was out, the card was far and away the superior option,
compared to the vlb tridents, cirrus logic's, s3's, etc. In terms of raw
performance it did better than anything else I owned or tried. With the
advent of PCI and highspeed PCs and many many video cards and windows and X
drivers and accelleration, the venerable ET4000 didn't mean too much
anymore. But the ET6000 was still running in this machine, until I put an
8Mb AGP i740 in. There is an ET6100 and ET6300 that are meant to be a lot
faster than the ET6000, but I never had an oppurtunity to try one out.

However, the ET4000 and ET6000 both had good support in X, and worked fine
for me! The ET6000's semi-downwards compatibility with the ET4000 was useful
for some legacy software (eg. DOS games that used extended modes).

Both the ET6000 and the i740 are readily available as extremely cheap clone
cards, and the only problem I have had is that the ET6000's original drivers
sucked, and the i740 overheated. Since the ET6000 has since had the drivers
fixed, and I've fixed the i740, I'm now happy again.

The ET6000 has nice hardware scaling functions, in windows and fullscreen,
and does MPEG playback very well - it can support 4 mpeg windows at once
even. It's better than the i740 in this respect. If people have trouble
buying these cards, give me an email, and I can source them for you.

Subject: video cards


&gt;I have a 2MB s3 video card, and I am finding the xserver/video card to
&gt;pretty unstable (especially when using netscape). Does anybody know
&gt;off/used/can recommend a PCI video card that is very stable with
&gt;xwindows ?
