&gt; Anyway, there probably is such a reference around...hidden in the
&gt; /usr/local/back'o'bourke/beware_of_the_leopard/bin/ directory, that you start
&gt; by typing "plshlpme."

I share your sentiments with this - it's a real bastard trying to find the
program you need.

I'd work on some sort of LSM (Linux Software Map) Parser for this very
purpose... but... I've got this weird feeling that one already exists.
It's probably called wtfisthatlsm, too.

If this is so, somebody please tell me before next Monday, or else I start
work on it.

I feel that something like this would be really usefull for gurus, too. If
somebody asks "Where is a program which does XXXX?" you could easily reply
"I'm sure there's one in your -local- lsm database. Check there.".

I know that lsm's aren't the be all and end all of finding what program
you need, but it's better than nothing, and would be nice to have
something local to check rather than having to go to the lsm repository.
