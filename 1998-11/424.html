I am absolutely legit on this.
2 decades.
I am sure there are ways out and around the contract but if
the government doesn't explore these...

Keep in mind the contract was signed about 3-4 years back.
Only 16 to go.

In my experience most IT people in government are total
MS junkies. When I was working for SA government everyone
knew my feelings and one day I got a job to fix a Linux server.
I asked what the deal with this server was and no one could tell
me because it had been in place so long and never caused any
problem that no one really remembered what it did. Most of
the staff didn't even work their when it was put in. The only reason
it failed was because of hardware failure.

Still they rather use their NT servers that are rebooted on an
almost daily basis.

That is why I moved to the federal gov, no EDS and not too much
MS.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) SA government signed a 20 year Microsoft contract for all
&gt; &gt; workstations and servers.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure about this? This sounds pretty far-fetched, 20 years in the
&gt; software industry is so enormously long (ie longer than MS has been
&gt; around). Come on, we probably won't even be using client-server (ie pc
&gt; workstations) in 10 years time, let alone 20! Surely the government
&gt; wouldn't be that short-sighted, I suppose they only look as far as the
&gt; next election.....
