&gt; BTW: Could you _please_ try formating your email properly.  Lines without
&gt; linefeeds are very annoying to read.

I have never come across this problem... I use pine, and used to use
elm... at home I use Outlook98, and have used Netscape mail in the past
also... Obviously, these mail readers have wordwrap on... Which ones
don't? And why don't they? Please don't interpret this as a flame, but I
don't understand why mail readers (ie the programs, not the people) can't
wrap the words themselves -- it would seem to be logical to me, as
different people have different screen widths, and it's pretty annoying to
get a mail where someone has put linefeeds on each line, and then my
reader wraps the last word of every line... This also happens with replies
to replies to &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replies...

Please educate me as to why linefeeds should be neccessary...

thanks
