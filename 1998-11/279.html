Well here's my 2 cents.

I downloaded Start Office, and it installed with a minimum of effort.

I was shocked to see that it looked "exactly" like a windows program. right down to the n-th degree.

Some examples:
dialog boxes during install had buttons labelled "Back" "Forward" "Cancel" exactly in the right position. 
All the little graphics have been cut and pasted. right dowen to the icons. eg. if it is a Word97 document, the icon it presents is the same.

My opinions
=========

Positives:
1. it looks and feels exactly like Office 97 for MS-windows, except for a few minor menu orderings. This allows users who are familiar with said products slip very quickly into a new environment. Anyone wishing to install it into an office situation would do well for this fact. 

2. It reads MS documents (alot of other unix programs do to however)

3. its just as wanky. i haven't tried out every feature, but i dont think I have to. It looks like a bunch of ex-MS programmers have gone and ported Office directly to unix.

Negatives:
1. Its Slow. I have a CyrixP200+ with 4meg ET6000 and 96meg RAM, and it was SLOWWWWW

2. its big and monolithic

3. it runs completely inside ONE window (i think). you needn't really run a window manager.

4. on my X server (straight out of the redhat 5.1) the fonts looked crap when i load a document written in Word97.



In conclusion, i'm not overlly impressed with it and I wouldn't waste my bandwidth. Wait untill an install-fest and try it out on someones elses computer first.

IMHO StarOffice 5 isn't really worth it.. sure, it's got all the whiz
bangs of the windows product, but that's where it seems to choke and
die. It feels very much like the programmers were hired to do a "direct
port from the windows version" and took it a little too literally. It's
even got it's own windows 95 widgets and start button.

I'm not writing this message to start a flame war. I'm writing this
message to warn those people who have to pay 20c per meg for their
bandwidth if you're looking for the Next Big Thing for OSS computing, this
isn't it (1). I just feel lucky that I'm not volume charged, or I'd be
paying $15 when I could be downloading GNU apps instead.

Ah, I hear you cry, but what other software of this variety is availble
for free download, and will compile under linux? I think gnome has some
pretty nifty editors, but I've yet to check it out... but still, for those
of us who have access to windows boxes running Office (ie at work, tafe,
etc), I really don't see the point. I might aswell go use my sister's
486: atleast there Office is in it's own native environment... and I can
easily telnet into my box for everything else *grin*.

I think it would have been a brilliant program, if only the developers had
been allowed a bit of free reign to explore X. A Qt or gtk version of so5
would have been great. I just feel kinda annoyed, because I use linux to
get away from the windows interface (I've found KDE to be very nice) and
then this big hunk of a NextBigThing program comes along and turns my X
server into a very slow windows box.

Sure, the program's great for new linux converts... but most of the new
linux converts I know don't even know how to get X working, let along
install the new glibc libraries.

One more thing, so you don't misquote me on all this, I'm not having a go
at StarOffice as a whole, I'm having a go at the way it's been developed.
X and linux apps should be nice and original - with maybe a few features
nicked from other OS's, but not a direct rip from that program/OS
combination we love to hate. And yes, it does have some rather nifty bits,
but I can't help feeling that I'm running a Windows emulator at half
speed.

 Anyway. I've had my fun. &lt;/mindless rant mode&gt;

Michael.
