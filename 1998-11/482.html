&gt; Unfortunately I am running Debian (Hamm), I should have said this in my earlier
&gt; email. Which borings me to the question: how do I decide which dist is best for
&gt; me?

  Well...I use Redhat because it's the easiest to use / configure, and also
  because it is (as far as I can see) the distro that sets the tone as far
  as new technology is concerned (eg rpm, modular kernel, hardware
  detection, more hardware support, glibc etc etc)

  *  And everyone on this list knows Redhat!!!  

&gt; I am assuming that it is not essential to use to load sound as a module. Is this
&gt; correct?

  Heh heh...with a modular kernel, if one sound module ( ie driver ) doesn't 
  work, you can simply load anothery, or change the module's setting...no need
  to recompile if you make a typo when you entered some values...and kernel
  support just isn't there (I don't think) for anything newer than an SB16.

&gt; Is sndconfig available with Debian? I could not find it on my hdd.

  Nope. Without sndconfig, you might want to try the SBAWE32-HOWTO. You might
  have to get your fingers dirty there...unless you switch to RedHat.

&gt; I wish it was. I think I can isolate the problem to me doing something wrong in
&gt; xconfig. More specifically with the IO settings for the card.

  Hmmm...as I said, I don't think you can compile AWE support into a kernel.
  It really only works for old cards. (I say this only because I tried for a
  long time to do it, with no success. It's probably possible, but sndconfig
  does all the yuck for you.)

&gt; I know the IO settings for my card according to win95. There are two sets of three
&gt; IO ranges (one set for 16 bit audio and one for wavetable midi). It seems that
&gt; xconfig only has room for one range of IO addresses. How do I enter multiple
&gt; ranges in xconfig?

  Sorry! You can't. (I tried it too!) sndconfig asks for IO port, IRQ, 8bit
  DMA and 16bit DMA. 

  I find that the card automatically uses the wavetable if you specify
  "general midi" as the midi device. Thus, in linux, I think it uses the wave
  table's midi by default, as it asks the card for it's "general midi" sounds,
  which I believe the card will translate as, "Oh, I think you mean the
  wave table's midi."

  As far as deb is concerned, I can't help you much more man. If you got
  Redhat, I can pretty safely say that it will find your card and configure it
  automatically for you, without worrying too much about the wavetable's IO
  addr.


  cheers!
