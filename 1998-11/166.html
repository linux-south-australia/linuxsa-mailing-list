Topics:
-   press reports regarding halloween article
-   French web pages on linux
-   5 to 10 million French linux users!?

My apologies for using yet another e-mail on this subject, but the
articles on linux vs MS on the net just keep getting better.

I just found one in the UK newspaper "the Guardian":

    <A HREF="http://reports.guardian.co.uk/articles/1998/11/8/p-32026.html">http://reports.guardian.co.uk/articles/1998/11/8/p-32026.html</A>

I got to that from

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/">http://linuxtoday.com/</A>

which I got to from a French site again:

    <A HREF="http://www.linux-center.org/fr/informations/news/">http://www.linux-center.org/fr/informations/news/</A>

which is actually a very informative page.

Their top French-language page is

    <A HREF="http://www.linux-center.org/fr/">http://www.linux-center.org/fr/</A>

which has the English-langauge version:

    <A HREF="http://www.linux-center.org/en/">http://www.linux-center.org/en/</A>

Cheers,

PS.  This all reminds me of my experience of moving from the US to
Germany in 1986. I had thought that the US was the home of the
Atari ST (which I had bought). But it gradually dawned on me over the
years that Germany was the true home of the Atari ST.
All the best software was in Germany, while Atari was going broke
in the US.

In the same way, I'm beginning to wonder if we're missing out on a lot
regarding linux in the english-speaking world. Other linguistic groups seem
to take to linux more positively. Maybe this is precisely because they
can modify the code for their own language purposes.

But anyway, I think it pays to keep in touch with the French scene, and
the Mexican scene, and so forth. Maybe that's where it's all really going
to happen.

In fact, some of the best linux stuff I've found in the last week comes
from Hungary, Germany and some other european country.

PPS. At the bottom of <A HREF="http://www.linux-center.org/fr/">http://www.linux-center.org/fr/</A> you will see
