People,

After watching the email that has been going through the list
in recent weeks I feel compelled to just set some guidelines
for the list.  Remember that these are just guidelines, and straying
from them is perfectly okay, as long people think it is appropriate.

We are all part of a community, albiet small, that should all try to get along
well together.  We need to acknowledge also that we are all different, we all
have different likes, dislikes, education and understanding.

There are literally hundreds of references to the do's and don'ts of email
etiquette.  In general when you breach the common etiquette it reflects badly 
on yourself and the email list.  It may be worth while some of us on the list 
doing a refresher by scanning the web to each other.

At the crux of it all there is...

	1) Keep personally directed comments/likes/dislikes personal.
		If you think that what someone has posted something 
		that is worth flaming, take the flame to the person
		directly.  If it is an intelligent comment that adds
		to the thread then by all means post it.

	2) Be polite.  It is unlikely that most of us would directly 
		flame or insult people if we where face to face with
		a person, so electronicly express the same level of
		of courtesy to each other here.

	3) If someone makes an inappropriate comment to the list, just
		ignore it.  The chances are that most people have
		similar feelings about the response and or the author.
		If you must make a response then do it personally.  When
		a simple comment or joke is posted to the list that may
		be inappropriate let it stay at that, we all don't need
		flamewars filling our inboxes.

The list is intended to be a friendly useful place to for people to exchange
ideas about Linux.  This may entail the odd posting about a joke or a have
you heard this.  This may seem annoying to some people, but it usually is 
useful or funny to some members of the list.  I find that the dynamics of
the list and the different attitudes, experiences and ideas of its members
of great value.

I don't think I am asking anything unreasonable in this email.

I have intentionally not pointed a finger at anyone in this email, but if
you do think this email is directed at you then look closely at your 
actions on the list.  Most people are fine and treat the list and its
members in an appropriate manner.  Some occasionally let a comment rip, 
and a few others just soap box.

Remember these are just guidelines for how to act on the list.  It is not
a policy and it won't be enforced.  

Have fun, and let's all keep LinuxSA getting better!

I would prefer it if people would like to make comments about this email then
do it privately.

Regards,

Matt
