&gt;Hehe, sorry to firstly be violating your last wish, Matthew, but I think
&gt;discussion of issues which affect all members of the list are worth doing
&gt;publicly.

Sorry, but I do my e-mails in order and I only got to this one *after* I
posted my reply to the word97 post.  :o)

But I too am getting a bit tired of some of the threads, and I agree with
Matthew's guidelines. I am highly guilty of jumping on the soap-box and
raving on for paragraphs if I feel the cause is worthy, and flaming leaners
is one of them!  It would be nice if it didn't happen in the first place
though.

Once thing I have noticed though, is the number of new names these
'discussions' bring out. Please, if you are lurking, the best thing you can
do is reply to people's queries and help them out. Don't worry if your
answer isn't right, hopefully someone will correct any errors in a positive
way.

This way we don't see the same people answering the questions all the time.
If you feel you can help, Please please don't be worried that you're going
to be shot down in flames if your wrong.

&gt;Technically oriented people seem to have a predilection for strong views. I
&gt;know, I'm like that, too. But, please, lets make sure we conduct ourselves
&gt;here in a civilised manner.

Yup, and also, don't forget that the list isn't limited to technical
matters only. If you wish to bring up anything Linux related, go ahead.

Cheers

Alex!
