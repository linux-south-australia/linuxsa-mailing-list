Hi Kirsty
I've used some ISA & PCI adaptec's, and a PCI NCR over 
the last couple of years with linux, with varying results
but preferred the NCR to any of the adaptecs.
A few months ago however I installed an Advansys 
PCI ultra I got with a burner in a non critical server.
I'd been reluctant to use it before because advansys
wasn't known to me. It worked absolutely flawlessly
in fact, so good I took it out & put it in one
of my important servers in lieu of a PCI ultra adaptec.
I subsequently bought another for a new server
I was building, which has also performed flawlessly.

Unlike the adaptecs they boot quickly, recognise
every device I've put to them including drives,
magneto-opticals, burners and dats, have never
given an error (vs many errors a day on every Adaptec
I've used) and are cheap, you can pick them up around $130.
I've even managed to use one to salvage data from disks
the others had given up as dead.

Advansys have provided linux drivers since 1995
and all kernels since v1.3.58 have included it, they even
include linux drivers (for old kernels) on the floppy.

I'm beginning to believe, like NIC's, Operating systems
and even whole PC's the brandnames aren't really ahead on
anything but marketing, hype and price. So don't feel you
have to buy an adaptec any more than you have to buy NT.
There are good alternatives like advansys.

regards
Adrian
