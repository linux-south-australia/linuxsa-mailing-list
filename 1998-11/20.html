Hi All,
	I'm a newbie and this is my third post in this list. I still have
not gotten sound to work in my redhat-5.1 system. A friend suggested that
I try and recompile a new kernel(linux-2.0.35.tzr.gz). I was doing that
but then(because I am booting Linux from a boot diskette as LILO cannot be
placed in the mbr of hda (I tried but it came out with the letter L and
hangs there. I guess this is because I placed the root fs near the end of
the hard-disk(g: in a 6.4GB hard disk which means it's &gt; 1024 cylinders)

	Anyway, when I tried to transfer the image to the floppy, that's
when I found out that I cannot access(mount) the floppy. All it does is
that it justs sit there and the light on the floppy drive would be lit. It
does that for (longest I waited - 7-10 minutes) then I ejected the disk(I
know I shouldn't do that) I even tried to format the disk using the
command - mke2fs /dev/fd0 This also just hangs there like before until I
eject the disk. 

	FYI - I mount using the command(tried all these)
		mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
		mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
		mount -t msdos /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt/floppy
		mount -t vfat /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt/floppy

I need to access the floppy to get the new kernel(boot disk) image to it.
Or else I cannot boot to the new kernel(linux-2.0.35) and get to configure
the sound from there.

	Please any help whatsoever is appreciated and needed. Otherwise
I'll have to go to the unwanted task of getting back to windows to play
CD's and MP3 and RealAudio Files(South Park!!)

	Thank you in advance. Really.
