  [ advansys SCSI host adaptors ]
 &gt; Unlike the adaptecs they boot quickly, recognise
 &gt; every device I've put to them including drives,
 &gt; magneto-opticals, burners and dats, have never
 &gt; given an error (vs many errors a day on every Adaptec
 &gt; I've used) and are cheap, you can pick them up around $130.
 &gt; I've even managed to use one to salvage data from disks
 &gt; the others had given up as dead.

The traits you mention there sound like they have very little to 
do with the quality of the host adaptor and lots to do with the
quality of your cabling.

It is not a SCSI controller's job to "recognise devices" any more
than it is a LAN card's job to "recognise computers" on the network.
That's the software's job.  Similarly, salvaging data from disks other
controllers have given up as dead suggests that the Advansys is more
forgiving of cabling errors than the Adaptec, and that if you'd fixed
up your cabling the Adaptec would have "salvaged" the data as well
(i.e.: the disks weren't really dead, they were just having trouble
communicating).

As suggested above, the best way to visualize SCSI is as a LAN:  A
SCSI bus consists of a number of wholly independent autonomous devices
which communicate with each other via a standardized protocol -- Your
computer's SCSI host adaptor is but one of those devices, and just happens
to be the one that originates most of the commands utilized by the
protocol, but is otherwise nothing special.  Like 10Base-2 LANs, SCSI
specifies "termination" criteria and limits on bus cable length, and
will fail if those specifications are not met.  Like LAN cards, some
SCSI host adaptors are more forgiving than others if those standards
are not met, but if an adaptor fails to communicate you can hardly 
blame the card if the cabling is bodgy.

In general, follow these guidelines when setting up your SCSI bus so
that it'll work with any host adaptor:

    - Total bus length should be no more than 3m (including all the
      cable coiled up inside your computer's case and any external
      enclosures).  Different SCSI standards actually have different
      cable length limits, but 3m is a fairly good rule of thumb.  Check
      IEEE's web site for the official specs if you want more info.

    - No more than two devices on the bus should be supplying terminator
      power.  Your SCSI card is usually one of those devices;  You may
      have to change the jumper configurations on other devices to switch
      of terminator power to make things work.

    - At least one device must supply terminator power.  Duh. :-)

    - Termination must be enabled on the devices at each end of the bus,
      and ONLY those devices.  If you don't have any external devices, that
      means your SCSI controller is at one end of the bus, so you'll need
      to enable your host adaptor's termination.  Conversely, if you plug-in
      external devices, be sure to disable the host adaptor's termination.
      Although most host adaptors have auto-termination these days, in my 
      experience it hardly ever works.  If the devices at the ends of your
      SCSI bus don't have in-built (switchable) termination, use external
      terminators.

    - Only use shielded external cables (usually thicker and stiffer than
      unshielded cable).  If you have unshielded external cable, expect your
      SCSI bus to act like an antenna and pick up RF noise from everywhere,
      making it fail for no apparent reason ("Why does my computer only work
      when the radio is switched off?").  Most people ignore this rule
      because shielded cable is more expensive than unshielded, and usually
      harder to get too.

    - If you have parity enabled on one device on your bus, enable it for
      all the others too.

If you get these right, your SCSI bus should work with any host adaptor.
If you get them wrong, it'll probably still work, but may fail randomly
for otherwise unrelated reasons.  I've had a customer with a SCSI bus
that worked perfectly for three years then suddenly failed -- Turned out
that it stopped working because he put another computer on the same desk,
and started working when we moved that computer to the other side of the
room:  Because the cabling was marginal, electromagnetic emissions from
the new computer were sufficient to make it stop working.  After I eliminated
about a metre of cable from the marginal SCSI bus, he was able to put his
new computer back on his desk where it belonged without further problems.
I've heard of other SCSI busses which only work when the lights in the
room are turned off (a fluro starter probably radiated too much :-) or
when someone is standing behind the computer (EM fields from the person's
body affecting the signals on the cable).

 &gt; I'm beginning to believe, like NIC's, Operating systems
 &gt; and even whole PC's the brandnames aren't really ahead on
 &gt; anything but marketing, hype and price. So don't feel you
 &gt; have to buy an adaptec any more than you have to buy NT.
 &gt; There are good alternatives like advansys.

Some host adaptors are *definitely* better than others.  I'm using an
Adaptec 7880UW and it absolutely rocks - Fastest SCSI controller I've
seen (and unfortunately hard to get these days, 'cos Adaptec superceded
them with an inferior model).  The Adaptec 7890s are fantastic too.

As a rule, however, Adaptec controllers are more anal about cabling.
You should have no trouble if you follow the rules of thumb I've presented
above.
