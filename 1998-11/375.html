&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW: Could you _please_ try formating your email properly.  Lines without
&gt; &gt; &gt; linefeeds are very annoying to read.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please educate me as to why linefeeds should be neccessary...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Actually it isn't so much the reading (I use pine also).  Rather it
&gt; affects me when I come to reply.  It also affects any attempt to save the
&gt; email, as many unix editors don't autowrap existing text (btw: This is a
&gt; valuable feature).  You should notice this problem if you try replying to
&gt; an improperly formatted email in pine.  

Well, I can't remember having that problem... mayme no-one's ever sent me
unlinefeeded mail... I notice that pico (the pine text editor) sucks if
you are writing programs, as it wraps the lines around, and can mess
things up unless you take care... Emacs doesn't wrap, which can be
annoying if you are writing some sort of document, and want to move the
cursor from line to line quickly, but it's way better for programming.
Wouldn't it be nice if programs could somehow wrap where appropriate... eg
I would like pine to be able to wrap automatically, and also wrap replies
consistently, so that instead of getting one word on the next line, with
no &gt;'s, the text would rewrap itself intelligently, re-aligning the &gt;'s as
it went... yes I know, it's probably harder than it seems, but it would be
nice... Maybe even emacs should have a mode where it puts LF's in (it
probably does....) automatically, so when you want to write a normal text
sort of document, as opposed to a program or script, it would be easier to
use... Maybe something along the lines of XML could be part of an answer
to this... although that wouldn't go down too well in a text-oriented unix
world...

&gt; 
&gt; You will find these issues raised in the email/usenet section of 
&gt; the nettiquite RFC (1855).

'scuse the lazy question, but where would I find this?
