&gt; My essential tenant is that using computers should _not_ be a skill.
&gt; It should be something I can do without understanding them at all.
&gt; I don't need to learn how my car processes fuel in order to drive, I
&gt; just turn the key, and go.  The fact that I'm using a computer should
&gt; be essentially transparent to me -- I am not using the computer for the
&gt; sake of it, I am using the computer to get a task done.  I am interested
&gt; in the task (the end) and not the means (the computer).
&gt;
&gt; (This, of course, avoids the issue of geekery, which _likes_ to get
&gt; distracted with the means ;-)

Tried to stay out of this but......

20+years of observation of computer users can be summed as follows:

KISS - the simpler the better. In fact the less the system does the happier
the clients will be.

Corollary: Design a program that does nothing and lots of people will buy it
(price is not overly important just make sure it does nothing). Users are in
fact happiest with dumb programs.

Therefore, MS will always succeed with dumbed down software, and their users
will be happier.

Over the years I have experimented with this principle. Normally I would
write a deeply integrated application - put the data in once and everything
happens. I find this confuses users. They like to walk data through the
system. They like paper. They like not having to think too hard.

So they should like a deeply integrated system. Easier to use isn't it? No.
The user can't understand how it works at all and worries about it and gets
confused. It takes a lot of training to convince them to trust the system.
It takes less training to say "Enter this data. Photocopy this page. When
the order is ready, enter the details again into the invoicing from the
paper.". If you don't believe me, do a quick survey of the most successful
software. Would you buy it? Millions do.

My experiments consisted of meeting the minimum spec from the user and doing
what I would normally consider a dumb, inadequate job. Hey presto. Happy
user.

Corollary. Don't try to be smart. Most users want to come to work, do their
job (if they must), get paid, go home and do whatever they do for the rest
of their lives. They don't care about our smart programs so don't try to
impress too much. Most of the time they will think better of us if we
respond simply and directly to their immediate need.

Corollary. MS wins because they do all these things. How they achieve them
is a separate problem. WinXX is pre-installed. Great. One less thing to
worry about.

My guess at the main reason Linux won't supplant Win now or in the future is
the multi user stuff. The PC should switch on and be ready to use. Forget
logins, permissions, etc. This is the big simplicity from MS that made
computing accessible. While Unix, VMS, et al were worried about multi-user,
multi-tasking, MS walked straight in, put a PC on a desk, and it worked.

Why is MS having so much trouble with NT? Their strength is their weakness.
They come from a 0 user culture (single user is a misnomer. A Linux desktop
is single user because one user at a time is identified to the system and
using it under the control of the system. WinXX might make a user login but
beyond that it has no way of identifying and controlling the user - 0 user
system). R&D is a people thing, not a money thing. $5bn buys a lot of
pepole, but as far as I can tell there are only a handful of people who
really understand multi-user/multi-tasking and none them work for MS.

One other observation. Yes, MS has set us back many years because they
rarely take advantage of the deep results from Computer Science, preferring
to invent again from scratch (albeit in copy mode).

And after all that rant, what works best for the user - WinXX on the desk
(easy to start), talking to Unix/Linux servers (to do the real work), using
applications that don't try to rule the world (instead they meet the user's
perceived need).

The important thing is that we are lucky enough to work in one of the most
dynamic industries ever with scope to become any thing from intellectual
nerds to exceedingly rich nerds. The average worker will never have that
choice.
