&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; And finally some of my colleauges and myself oh, and our IT
&gt; staff, are very
&gt; much aware of linux. The amount of discussion that takes place
&gt; has went from
&gt; nothing a few years ago to being mentioned at least once every day, and a
&gt; discussion on its merits at least one per week
&lt;/snip

That's also true of my colleagues in my department. On Monday I will be
installing Redhat Linux 5.2 on a machine in our office. It can't be
connected to the EDS LAN so I won't be able to demonstrate the networking
strengths of Linux, but people will be able get their hands on an
alternative OS.

I concur with Stephen Donaldson, there is no particular affection for
Microsoft products in our Agency either. We need to get our jobs done as
efficiently as possible, and currently the best combination for the desktop,
for the average user, is Win95 / NT Workstation running MS Office.

That's not to say there is no place for open source software or alternative
commercial software. I'm currently running Apache, VIM, SED and Analog (not
exactly OSS, but free) and Netscape is installed on plenty of workstations
in my area. Our IT branch will purchase any software that we request,
usually with no questions asked. There has never been any suggestion that we
should be forced to use an alternative Microsoft product. For instance I
requested Dreamweaver and it was supplied without any suggestion that I
should use Frontpage.

Most government agencies have a certain amount of freedom within the EDS
contract, particularly with Internet technologies. The DETE website nexus,
is run by DETE personnel on DETE servers not EDS servers. Our Website sits
on a an Internode server and there are state government websites residing on
Camtech servers.

There are some problems with the service supplied by EDS. But there are also
some strengths, StateNet the government WAN is an excellent service that
certainly improves the efficiency of the agencies connected to it. StateNet
connects government offices using TCP/IP from Ceduna to Renmark and Coober
Pedy to Mt Gambier, an excellent backbone for intranet services.

I have friends who now work for EDS, and they are just as concerned about
the quality of the service that they supply, as we are. They are also very
aware of the OSS movement, I'm sure that if it becomes economical and
practical to use OSS, it will be cautiously adopted. EDS is a commercial
organisation, if OSS increases profits and/or reduces costs they have a
responsibility to their share holders to consider it.

I think the original poster raised the idea of demonstrating Linux at some
sort of business lunch?? I'm not sure about the idea of a lunch (not many
people that I know stop for lunch these days) but I could easily interest
some of my colleagues in a Linux presentation. Our particular focus would be
the Oracle port to Linux and querying Oracle via Apache or the Oracle
webserver. I'm sure others would be interested in seeing Linux used as a
network server running Samba or running Xwindows sessions on windows
machines from a Linux server. There may also be the possibility of some sort
of an alliance with Oracle here is SA, particularly as Larry Ellison
(spelling?) is no friend of Microsoft.

Finally, forget the Microsoft / EDS bashing, there is no mileage to be
gained there for the OSS community. Just demonstrate a professional product.

Steve
