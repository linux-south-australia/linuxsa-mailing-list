Nick,

Many thanks for that note on the 20-year MS-compulsory contract.
I had heard that the EDS would be bad, but I didn't realise
it was quite that bad.
I'm glad I work for the federal govt!

I still think the idea of a big "get to know linux" event would
be enjoyable and beneficial.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  We could, of course, invite an opposition spokesperson as well,
and comapre their keynote speeches.
But in order to get real benefit for all concerned, it would be
best to keep politicians out of it.
They can't be expected to understand technology, after all.

PPS.  February would be a good time for an event.

PPPS.  In fact, why not make it a whole day, like a Sunday, and invite the
general public to a "linux fiesta" or something like that.
A "linux+gnu expo"?
As opposed to an installfest, the idea would be that
we demonstrate working software and give presentations on
the various aspects of "the linux question".
Why not have 20 stalls, each with a different focus.
In fact, why not invite opposing OSs to do some stalls too,
and there could be hardware demos, and....
Has anyone been to the Hannover CeBit?
Where can we get a cheap, big indoor venue with about 40 power points?
We also need a PA, and a wireless mike or two, and a big projector.
A back of an envelope estimate tells me this would
cost about $2000 for the day, mostly for venue hire.
Maybe the retailers who provide the hardware could pay for the venue.
Then they get their hardware and stuff demoed to the public etc.
