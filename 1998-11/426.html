&gt; &gt; As I'm a newbie to Linux, what book would you recommend me to get which
&gt; &gt; would take me gently through Linux installation and setting up a small
&gt; &gt; network?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there a preferred distribution to use?
 
&gt; RedHat is definetely your best choice if you're a newbie, and the
&gt; documents that come with the RH boxed set should get you on the right
&gt; track.

I just want to remind people - since we're (elsewhere)
so interested in saving $'s on books - that:

  There are two ways to buy RedHat's Installation Guide:

  - as part of the RedHat LINUX 5.2 boxed-set
    (Au$59 - Au$69 from Geoffrey, more in bookshops)

  - by itself (Au$ 25 from Geoffrey)

As to the RH distribution itself, didn't I see it for US$ 1.95
from Cheap Bytes (their version of 5.2 - no source?) for the
entry-level just learning... with no great need to modify (yet)

Locally (meaning in .au), I think LSL wants about Au$ 9 for
their low-end distribution (again, no source), but they have
at last one Combination Pack with *several* distributions
RedHat, Slackware & one from Germany, I think...

(LSL = LINUX System Lab's)

This would be the fairest way to compare LINUX versions...
you could install each for a week or month - in turn - and
next time try the next one...

Of course, just as there is a tendency to follow the local
crowd:

 - if in gov't IT, down the gold-brick Microsoft road -or-
 - if in LINUX SA, down the yellow-brick RedHat LINUX road,

I suppose you're at some risk of being persuaded by this
list's frequency-of-mention of "RedHat" i.e. unless you
do get such a "tripple-header" disk - for under Au$ 10

Do you follow "Fashion" -or- "Science"?  ;)
