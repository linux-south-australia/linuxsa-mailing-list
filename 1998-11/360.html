&gt; Completely disagree ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I disagree. By writting (albeit inferior) software, Microsoft has
&gt; &gt; increased the number of people using computers in everyday life.
People's
&gt; &gt; acceptance of computers has increased, and acceptance only increases
when
&gt; &gt; users do more using.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 	I tend to think that if MS had never happened (say, Bill was drowned
&gt; at birth), then I believe that we would all be sitting on $200-$300
&gt; multimedia network computers running open source applications from remote
&gt; UNIX machines across very high bandwidth links. All that MS has acheived
is
&gt; to send the whole industry temporarily down an evolutionary blind alley
for
&gt; a few years.

No, I'd say that *both* Bill *and* Linus have set before up a couple of
pretty straightforward examples - to follow or ignore at our own perill:

Those that DON'T have time to "bash" (whatever)
           DO have time to write programs (like bash...)
                that - in time - help make their dreams come true...

I seem to remember sending similar words to Markie - years ago -
and I see that they remain as true today as they were then...

As a result, we DON'T have "Newton 2000" on the horizon...

Like it or not, we have "Windows 2000" coming down the tubes...

Of course, all is NOT lost... we *also* have LINUX x.x.xx coming...

Now all we need is more app'n software so that "Real People"
(not to be confused with us "techies") will decide to try it

Now, you can Bash... or you can Design & Implement Programs...

Which path leads to your LINUX (or FreeBSD, Mark) goals...?

What can we learn from the Gates/Torvalds examples...?  ;)

PS Could I suggest that The Official LINUX SA NT Bashing Thread
   shift to one of the LINUX advocacy newsgroups...?  TIA  ;)
