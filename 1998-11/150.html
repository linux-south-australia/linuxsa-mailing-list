At 15:39 9/11/98 +1030, you wrote:
&gt;&gt; I know some/most will have already seen this, but I thought the funniest
&gt;&gt; was the two US guys who have a perl RSA crypt algorithm TATTOOED to their
&gt;&gt; bodies (so that they export it everytime they leave the country).
&gt;
&gt;I don't believe that is illegal.  It would only be illegal if they were
&gt;machine runnable, which they surely are not.  Oh, well, that's illegal
&gt;with respect to munitions export; there might well be patent and copyright
&gt;reasons why their tattoo is illegal.
&gt;

Yeah, sorry, I should have explained that bit some more.
On the site it says that:

"This is a perl program which implements RSA encryption and decryption, 
and is small enough to use as a signature file. Peter Junger, 
a law professor in the US, obtained from the US Commerce department 
a written statement ruling that this program must not be exported 
from the US."

The crux was more one of 'what extent people will go to just 
to snub the US gov export restrictions'.

But quite right, it is technically not classed as a "munition" 
(I think ;)
