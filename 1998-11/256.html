Hello,
	I'm planning to get a SCSI adapter and for what's it worth, I
think that adaptecs are really overpriced(AHA2940u costs ~AUD340). But the
thing is that I am worried that if I get any others, there would be
incompatibilties. As far as I know, adaptec are known for their absolute
compatibilites with any devices. I know for one card at least(aha1505)
that was to be connected to a scanner and a removeable drive(syquest
syjet) and as soon as it was connected, drivers loaded, NT immediately
recognised the card and all the dvices that was connected to it.

	I want to get a PCI SCSI and with the kind of pricing that adaptec
has on its line and with aha2940 not very well supported(as documented by
redhat5.2) it makes me think of getting another. At one point I was
considering a Mylex Flashpoint PCI that was going for around AUD130.00 in
one of the shops in Adelaide. At that time, my concern was again with
compatibility. I was afraid that it would not work on the machine.(or with
the devices that I plug into it)

	Well, guys, That's my 2 cents(and more?) I appreciate any feedback
on this(maybe even someone agreeing on adaptec's ridiculous pricing!) What
CARD is suggested by u guys/gals for a PCI SCSI card that is able to
support removeable drives, scanners, CD-R SCSI and hard drives both in
win98/NT and Linux(redhat).

	By the way, about these ultra wide SCSI, is the card able to
support simultaneously SCSI, Fast SCSI and Ultra SCSI ( or any other SCSI
variant That I do not know of), all in one single card and no give any
problems whatsoever. 

Thanks in advance.

&gt; Hi Kirsty
&gt; I've used some ISA & PCI adaptec's, and a PCI NCR over 
&gt; the last couple of years with linux, with varying results
&gt; but preferred the NCR to any of the adaptecs.
&gt; A few months ago however I installed an Advansys 
&gt; PCI ultra I got with a burner in a non critical server.
&gt; I'd been reluctant to use it before because advansys
&gt; wasn't known to me. It worked absolutely flawlessly
&gt; in fact, so good I took it out & put it in one
&gt; of my important servers in lieu of a PCI ultra adaptec.
&gt; I subsequently bought another for a new server
&gt; I was building, which has also performed flawlessly.
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike the adaptecs they boot quickly, recognise
&gt; every device I've put to them including drives,
&gt; magneto-opticals, burners and dats, have never
&gt; given an error (vs many errors a day on every Adaptec
&gt; I've used) and are cheap, you can pick them up around $130.
&gt; I've even managed to use one to salvage data from disks
&gt; the others had given up as dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Advansys have provided linux drivers since 1995
&gt; and all kernels since v1.3.58 have included it, they even
&gt; include linux drivers (for old kernels) on the floppy.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm beginning to believe, like NIC's, Operating systems
&gt; and even whole PC's the brandnames aren't really ahead on
&gt; anything but marketing, hype and price. So don't feel you
&gt; have to buy an adaptec any more than you have to buy NT.
&gt; There are good alternatives like advansys.
&gt;
