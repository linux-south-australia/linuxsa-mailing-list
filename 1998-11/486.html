I hate to say it, but I'm a fan of the Microsoft Natural Keyboards  - the
"melted" ones ... since I learnt to type a few years ago, the feel of
keyboard I use now matters a whole lot. I have both v1 (at work) and v2
(at home) ... obviously Microsoft OEMed them, as they don't lock up (and
turn blue!) .... they both look much better now that I have grafiti'ed the
"Microsoft" logo's with
 the "Powered by Linux" stickers I got last meeting ... gives that "The
rebels take over the Goverment TV station" look.

As to which version I would recommend it is hard to say (50 / 50)

V1 & V2 Good Points : Doesn't cease up like normal Microsoft products,
really long cable. Bad Points : Microsoft logo.

V1 - Good Points : regular AT keyboard layout, if not somewhat melted, not
too bad keyclick feel. Supports both "old" AT style keyboard connector,
comes with PS2 adaptor. Bad Points : takes up a bit of desk space, more
expensive than V2, might not be able to get V1 any more.

V2 - Good Points : smaller size, nicer feel than V1, USB connector when
USB is in Linux Kernel. Comes with adapter for PS/2. Bad Points :
Halloween ?Extend and Enhance? protocol - the inverted T arrow keys are
now in a + shape, and the Home, PGUP, PGDN, END, DEL etc block above the
arrow keys is 3 rows of two, rather than traditional 2 rows of three.
These keys and the function keys are also a smaller (which allowed them to
make the keyboard smaller).

HTH,
Mark.

&gt; PS.  Can anyone tell me what's the best sort of keyboard?
&gt; My PC keyboard is worse than my old Remmington typewriter -- which
&gt; I took to the city dump becasue it was too heavy.
&gt; I want something which is a total pleasure to use!
