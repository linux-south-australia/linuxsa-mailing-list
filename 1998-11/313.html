At 17:26 17/11/98 +1030, you wrote:
&gt;&gt; You don't mean turfing the srm.conf and access.conf do you???
&gt;
&gt;Don't turf them - append them to the httpd.conf file -- the new version
&gt;uses only the one file.  Then get the other files out of the directory so
&gt;it doesn't pick them up and try to process them as well.

I don't see why it should make any difference though, they all
contain unique config directives for specific purposes.
(And there is a fourth if you count the new "mime.magic" file)

If it didn't run the first time, why would it work reading the same 
directives from the one file? (unless it works because it is 
ignoring them in the httpd.conf and thereby side-stepping 
the real problem in srm or access by working from defaults)

The only Apache 1.3 related probs I've had with the conf files 
(that weren't related to a badly syntaxed directive :-) was
the way it had a conf AND an etc dir for conf files. I fixed that by
compiling the package so that it didn't ever use the "etc/" directory
as the conf dir.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; As I said in earlier post, I have the server IP-aliasing a different IP for
&gt;&gt; each virtual host. (but I'm now curious as to whether it is required or
not)
&gt;
&gt;This isn't required if you have the names set up in your DNS server
&gt;already.  

? 
I have to have the hostnames listed in my DNS whether I use unique IPs
or not. To my knowledge and as Michael Pearson posted just before, the
requests hit the server as IP-based and Apache decides which host it
is, based on what hostname that IP is responding as.

ie:
(AFAIK)
Apache is listening for requests made to the IP addresses that
resolve from the hostnames it is configured to serve.
That's why the most common prob with Apache is when the DNS
is not available, it can't make that initial resolution of the
hostnames and therefore doesn't start because it has nothing to
listen for.

PS: Gaelyne, pls don't take my reply as an argumentative attack, 
it is just that I have been working with Apache 1.2 for almost 
2 years and this thread is (in part) quite contradictory to 
my experiences. (I've been using 1.3 for about +3 months)

PPS: I'm currently configuring 1.3 on a spare server with two
hostnames resolving to it the main IP with a virthost
in the config (to test it for sure).

&lt;who is now more confused than enlightened by this thread :-P&gt;
