Not that this is a productive line of conversation, but I reckon the
best policy on y2k is to just keep your head down and pretend
the bug (known on french linux pages as "le bug de l'an 2000") won't
happen, which I reckon is the most likely outcome.
Hopefully I'll get a cheap airfare on 31 dec [19]99 out of it.
They were just talking about y2k bugs in the nat parliament -- taking
it just far too seriously.
[If I turn out to be wrong, this message will hopefully be deleted
from the archive by the bug.]

Anyway, getting serious:

Q1:  Can anyone tell me where the asian fonts for netscape are
documented. The other day, I looked at the japanese translation
of the halloween document, and found it had an instruction to
use an iso2022-jp font or something. Standard european
languages are iso9980-N or something similar.
The japanese text looked absolute stunning.
I'd like to be able to put vietnamese in some of my pages.
If netscape has them built in, I'd like to be able to use them.

Q2:  I don't think anyone's mentioned support for webcams
under linux. Is there an FAQ for this?
I'd like to do videoconferencing and webcam stuff on a linux box.
Obviously some sort of device driver support will be necessary.
By the way, my out-of-date webcam bookmark list is at
<A HREF="http://dartagnan.maths.adelaide.edu.au:8080/~akenning/webcam.html">http://dartagnan.maths.adelaide.edu.au:8080/~akenning/webcam.html</A>

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
