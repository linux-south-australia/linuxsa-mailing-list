&gt; Subject: Alternatives to Buying direct
&gt; Date: Monday, 23 November 1998 21:30
&gt; 
&gt; Still working with Woodslane on the purchase of a number of 
&gt; ORA books.
&gt; 
&gt; An alternative has been presented, however.

Why be afraid to buy direct?  Farmers have co-op's
why not learn from their example
 
&gt; Woodslane have a web page at 
 
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.bargainbooks.com.au">http://www.bargainbooks.com.au</A>
 
&gt; That has effectively seconds/returns in it.  The net result is
&gt; possibly substantial savings on various books.  The first example
&gt; I found was 'sed and awk' 2nd edition.  
&gt; 
&gt; The 'hurt' price was $A27.95, the list price was $A69.95.

It's a nice idea... but the group, direct buy
is more appropriate, I think... i.e. if you
don't want to see people saying:

  "Gee, I'd like to help you with that,
   &lt;client&gt;, but the book that I need
   has yet to appear on the Hurt-and-
   Returned book list on the Bargain-
   Book's web site..."

Would *you* be impressed by such an an-
swer?  I, for one, wouldn't...

What's the difference between ordering
together from Woodslane trading as
Bargain-Books (if it is)...

and an international supplier...

If still takes arranging the deal
(by toll-free tel.no *but* at a higher cost,
locally -or- by e-mail and cheaper
internationally), getting interest-
ed parties' money in, ordering,
waiting & distributing (e.g. at a
LINUX SA meeting).

Or... have I misunderstood your
suggestion?

Do you want people to drop the
plan of a cheaper, direct purchase
and buy *individually*?

Lots more "busy-work" on the part
of Woodlane (shipping lots more
small orders to SA)... so they
probably wouldn't be to keen to
discount much for it. (I wouldn't)

I've heard that such a distribu-
tor has - even for its reseller-
customers - two discount-scales:

  - book-shops (large discounts)
  - other resellers (small  "  )

Even with your buy from Woodslane
(in quantity) plan, you'd be start-
ing with the low-ball "other" dis-
count table, and be disadvantaging
the group as a result.

I vote for buying direct (carefully)

Let South Australia make its name
a little better known, rather than
trying to fly under the wing of its
Sydney-based bigger sibbling(s)...

Of course, if Woodslane sees value
in boosting its buying power... e.g.
with O'Reilly... and is willing to
meet the international competition's
per-unit end-user cost... then
I would surely change my vote.  ;)
 
&gt; Have a look, hopefully we will be able to organise something with
&gt; Woodslane for further purchases of ORA or other titles.

Do own shares in Woodslane?  ;)
 
PS Todays Australian mentions a Melbourne-
   based bookseller who's taking aim at
   Amazon.com (competing head-on)...

   Unfortunately, McGill's price for the
   DNS & BIND book (3rd Ed'n) is Au$ 75!
   [That's *not* my idea of competitive]

   What I'm suggesting is that we forget
   our "Fear of Direct Wholesale Buying"
   and help Woodslane LOWER the cost of
   books in Australia... by showing that
   - if they don't - we can (as needed).

   Removing a level or two from the mul-
   ti-tiered book market can really help
   bring the prices back to earth...

   Remember, your American counterparts
   can find 30-40% off list on the shelf
   on-line, if not at their local book-
   shops.

I am reminded of the riddle:

Q: Why did the Lord create so many goyim?
A: *Somebody* has to buy retail...

(From memory, it comes from "The
 Great Big Book of Jewish Humor")

These days... the Internet helps ANYBODY
buy wholesale without feeling guilty  ;)
