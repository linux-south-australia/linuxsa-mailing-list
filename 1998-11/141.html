&gt; No sounds, I suspect something quite obvious here.

&gt; I have a TX chipset motherboard with an on board sound card thingy SB16
&gt; compatible and WSS compatible.

Have a look at "pnpdump" and "isapnp" which are part of "isapnptools"
package. I have managed to get an onboard sound card mostly working with
them as a SB16.

Despite what the manuals claim, the on board sound card isn't that
compatible. I haven't managed to get the mixer working. I suspect this is
why the sound card refuses to pass on cd audio.

There was a discussion on linux-kernel a while back about onboard sound
cards. It seemed like most of them were extremely flaky and caused many
lockups. The person I set the onboard soundcard up for hasn't had any
crashes tho'.

The commercial version of OSS appears to have support for the onboard
sound card. I would have checked out the demo, but I dislike trusting
binary only drivers and I certainly wouldn't buy them.

There are a few more things I can try before I give up on the mixer. If I
come across anything, I'll let you know.

Regards,
Mark
