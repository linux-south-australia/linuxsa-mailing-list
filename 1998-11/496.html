PS.  Can anyone tell me what's the best sort of keyboard?
My PC keyboard is worse than my old Remmington typewriter -- which
I took to the city dump becasue it was too heavy.
I want something which is a total pleasure to use!

Alan,

I am not that much of a keyboard coniseur but I hve been using Mitsumi
keyboards for years.
This may surprise some as they are very inexpensive and I have had
fantastic performance from them.
	I had a cheap one, about $18 which I wore the keys smooth on, (still
working by the way) I decided to upgrade to the heavy duty version $33
worth and I am very happy with it, granted it is not a fancy looking thing
but the feel is quite good and they seem to last, it resembles the mega
dollar Wang keyboards used on their mini frame systems (VS15 etc) I used a
few years ago.
	I have a bit of a disposable attitude towards keyboards so I go for the
best of the cheap.
If I was to get keen which I might do soon I would look at the Honeywell
keyboards as they do have a good reputation, however upon seeing Marks
comments on the Microsoft one I might even take a closer look at those.

HTH
Kind Regards
	Paul
