&gt; PS.  Can anyone tell me what's the best sort of keyboard?
&gt; My PC keyboard is worse than my old Remmington typewriter -- which
&gt; I took to the city dump becasue it was too heavy.
&gt; I want something which is a total pleasure to use!

I use heaps of keyboards all the time - and the only real rule is to try
before you buy.  Like clothes, everybody likes a different feel, so don't
beleive anyone else's opinon on "the best feel ". (but it's good to know
which keyboards have what feel, and which are reliable)
A word of warning on the ergonomic keyboards:  i have had a chance to try
them out, and they are great - if you use one all the time.  If you're
like me and have to use many different keyboards, it's a hassle to swap
from straight to ergonomic regularly.
As far as reliability goes: expensive is generally better, but coffee 
kills any keyboard no matter what the cost.
Notwithstanding what i said about personal prefences, my favourite
keyboard of all time would have to be an old compaq laptop keyboard: one
of the membrane switch ones, where the keys only travel a few millimetres.
I would use it all the time, because it's very fast to type with, but the
function keys are ridiculous. (and i'd have to get used to it each time)
At the moment, on my home PC i use a $10 bargain basement model, that we
had at work and (most importantly) i liked the feel of.  I can
drink coffee or similar near it and not stress !
