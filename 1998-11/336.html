Completely disagree ...

&gt; I disagree. By writting (albeit inferior) software, Microsoft has
&gt; increased the number of people using computers in everyday life. People's
&gt; acceptance of computers has increased, and acceptance only increases when
&gt; users do more using.
&gt; 
	I tend to think that if MS had never happened (say, Bill was drowned
at birth), then I believe that we would all be sitting on $200-$300
multimedia network computers running open source applications from remote
UNIX machines across very high bandwidth links. All that MS has acheived is
to send the whole industry temporarily down an evolutionary blind alley for
a few years.

	I can understand your argument fairly well, but I think that anyone
that was around when the Amiga and Mac thing was first happening
all-those-years-ago knows that the ease of use and innovation argument is a
fallacy.

&gt; In the words of my father: "I don't want to have to drive the bloody
&gt; thing!" And what he says is true. It all fine and well for us as LINUX
&gt; enthusiasts to sit back and marvel out how clever we all are, and how
&gt; great LINUX is (don't get me wrong, LINUX is my preferred OS) but the fact
&gt; of the matter is, the Average Joe Bloe still shouldn't have to know how to
&gt; "drive" the computer.
&gt; 
	What your dad really wants then is a 3270 terminal that you just
turn on and bang - your app is immediately in your face. (or replace 3270
with wy-50, vt-320, JavaStation, etc).

	Now, the innovation of the user 'having to drive to computer' is
definately an MS innovation - I will concede that point. In the real world
that could have been, the driving of the computer would have been someone
else's problem (just like the driving of the telephone exchange is not the
telephone users problem). Microsoft sold middle management on the marvellous
idea of a mainframe on every desktop, and the acceptance of such a stupid
idea by these people has generated years of meaningless work for many in the
IT industry.

	Linux is unique in that it can scale from running those hellishly
complex distributed server applications down to providing an embedded
platform for NC's and PDA's. It is our responsibility to create those
solutions, and ensure that they are a more sensible and comfortable option
for Joe User than the alternative MS architectured solution. Thanks to MS
though, this is not a difficult thing to do.

&gt; Yeah - well explain to me why getting X to work is still a bit of a black
&gt; art.
&gt; 
	Compared to what ?  It has taken me around 3 months so far to get
all of gnome / orbit / gtk-themes compiled from scratch on my machine. This
is painful, but how many years would it take to get win95 compiled from
scratch if I (could ?) download the sources ?    The last 8 machines that I
have setup, using anything from RH to TurboLinux, setting up X was a trivial
exersize. If PC OEM's were allowed to have a choice on pre-installed OS on
the machines that they sold, then you can be assured that the pre-installed
linux on that brand shiny new Compaq PC would have a nicely setup X
installation.

&gt; LINUX has a long way to go before people will be buying it installed on a
&gt; computer out of a newspaper.
&gt; 
	Maybe closer than you think. Not long ago mobile phones were as much
as computers are now. You can now get a 'free' mobile by subscribing to a
service. The day is not far away when you will be able to get 'free' and
easy to use computers by subscribing to a service. When that day comes, you
can bet that Linux has a much better chance than NT / W2K of runinng those
free computers.


	As far as general bashing of MS goes, I dont have a problem with
that at all. MS will be determined to undermine Linux by direct assaults on
the internet standards themselves. While I  think that it is too late for
them to turn the game around, it just shows how low they are willing to go,
and for that they deserve nothing but the utmost contempt.
