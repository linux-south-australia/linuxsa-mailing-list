&gt; Does anyone know what I type at root to get xwindows

After you've setup X for your particular video card (Xconfigurator, can
be selected by running the program "setup") BTW, Xconfigurator is spelt
with a capital 'X', Unix is case sensitive.

"startx" should put you into X windows. You should head straight to the
control panel and add a new user by clicking on the conductor picture,
then "users", the reason for this is so that you can play around without
damaging your system.

&gt; apache

Should already be going, running somewhere in the background. You won't
even notice this unless you know where to look (ie viewing the web pages
with netscape)

&gt; netscape

You need to be in X windows to use Netscape, though there is a program
called lynx, that allows you to browse the internet without X.

1. Read the RH installation guide.
2. read the Unix and Linux Unleased books on your CD (use "xpdf" to view
them)
3. Head on over to <A HREF="http://www.linux.org">http://www.linux.org</A> and check out the Linux
Documentation Project
4. Resist the temptation to post a question, instead try and find the
answer yourself, you'll learn more, and more importantly you'll learn
problem solving skills and the ability to find information yourself.
5. Once you've got X working, make a new user and log in as them. This
is so you don't destroy your system.

READ READ READ. Play Play Play. Don't do this as root. Good luck.
