Hey All,

I just bought RedHat 5.2 from Netcraft (Beautiful scenery down there
BTW:)  ) and have it installed on my server machine, but I'm having some
fun getting it configured. Whenever I start httpd (I have 8 virtual host
entries in the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file) it is telling me that
they all overlap with the one above, and the first entry overlaps with
the last. It suggests using NameVirtualHost, but I can't find any info
on this anywhere where I look. Any ideas? The RedHat documentation says
it is apache version 1.3

Also, I am having fun with the DNS setup as well. It doesn't seem to be
working. httpd says it can't resolve the virtual host names, which I
know are all in my named files. How can I check if named is actually
working and running? nslookup times out. Could it be because I have a
statip internet IP address which is used in the named files, but the
machine isn't logged on so it can't see that IP??  (And just when I
thought I had DNS down pat too... BTW... I *should* be at the meeting
tonight...)

FYI, the machine is a 486SX33, 16Mb RAM, 500Mb HDD, running redhat 5.2,
with kernal 2.0.36. If you need any extra info, like my config files,
email me privately and I will send them over.

Thanks for any help in advance.
Dazz
