Hiya,

&gt; Hello,
&gt; My linux box (with a public IP on a University network) currently cannot be

&gt; What do I need to set on my computer to enable the other computers to 
&gt; access my computer?
&gt; The route man page wasn't helful enough.

How's it all set up? IE, is your box on the local intranet? Or is it at
your place? By exactly what means are the other boxes supposed to get to
your box? ie, is it supposed to go to a gateway which you have a ppp
connection to?

What's probably happening is that the other uni boxes are look at your ip
and saying "Oooh, that's in my subnet, that's on my local ethernet that
is" and looking for it there, not going through the gateway.

More info would really help. :))) 

A dump from just "route" would be nice, too.

Michael.
