&gt; The problem is that sendmail hangs at boot-time. I remember the solution was
&gt; something to so with DNS, so I put 127.0.0.1 as the last nameserver is
&gt; resolv.conf, and even as the first nameserver, but to no avail. (odd, because
&gt; that worked on another computer I fixed with the same problem!)

The problem is most likely caused by sendmail trying to resolve the
local IP address for its hostname.  To solve the problem, you can
either fix the problem that is causing your DNS server to be
unreachable (misconfigured networking setup?), or you can modify the
/etc/hosts file to include your machine name and IP address.

&gt; Also, is 5.2 worth the upgrade? Even if only for the new kernel...they're
&gt; always nice. I suppose that ".2" denotes a stable version, as opposed to ".1"?

As Michael pointed out, if all you want is the new kernel, just
download that.  Someone on <A HREF="mailto:redhat-list@redhat.com">redhat-list@redhat.com</A> pointed out that
there are 492 new RPMS (out of 573); this is excluding the 5.1
updates.

Red Hat's web site says this under "Changes from Previous Version":

Installation Class - This is a much more simplified installation
procedure allowing the user to select a workstation or server install.
The install will then automatically partition based your system and
take care of basic defaults.  All the power of the previous install
methods are still available via a "custom" install as well. 

- Multiple SCSI support during install (you can now easily install to
  systems with more than one SCSI adapter) 
- apache 1.3 (the worlds most popular WWW server) 
- gimp 1.0 (the long awaited release of the popular graphics package) 
- Linux 2.2 ready (install 2.1 development kernels now or be prepared
  for the Linux 2.2 kernel) 
- updated PCMCIA support (support for some of the latest PCMCIA cards) 
- better sound support (more supported cards) 

Has anyone in LinuxSA land installed 5.2 yet?  I'm still waiting for
it to download :-).
