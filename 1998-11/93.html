&gt; MS are leaking this stuff on purpose to make it look like they
&gt; haven't got a monopoly.

Didn't I read - in one of them - the hint of "Embrace & Entend"?

That's the way to build INcompatibility into the Internet...
e.g. so that LINUX boxes might become less interesting to the
larger market...

&gt; It's also interesting that MS are releasing stuff in France against
&gt; linux, apparently trying out their attakcs on linux there first.

I'm surprised by this... didn't I read somewhere that LINUX is already
in the French schools?  (Compare to SA Gov't's big all-of-gov't con-
tract to EMBRACE *Microsoft* operating systems & applications...)

Viva la France!

&gt; The French linux people have been responding to the attacks.

See above... in the schools, for one thing...

&gt; And presumably MS will use the responses to get the message
&gt; right when they release their attacks on linux in the US.

It's competition... and I like all signs of it... now, let's
stop collecting orders for badges, T-shirts and funny hats...
and start writing useful LINUX-based applications already.
 
&gt; By the way, my own expereicne of PCs with MS software is that
&gt; I had to obtain and use them because of only one thing -- the
&gt; fact that people keep sending me MS office format files
&gt; (*.doc, *.ppt, *.xls), and I have to be able to read/edit/create them.

Yes... mine includes something like that, as well...  And even
after tooling-up with Win95 (but before getting Office for it),
I found MS-supplied info doc'ts that Word Viewer can't display
properly!

Of course, the Commonwealth gov't didn't help - e.g. back in 94
I bought a CD-ROM from the DoTC or SMA (now ACA) listing all of
the radio frequencies & licensees... from 18 kHz thru (way up)
only to find that many of the technical papers included on the
disk were Word documents...

I think that there is good argument to REQUIRE such doc'ts to
be in HTML, so that any modern computer - including LINUX +
Netscape - can display them... or is there a better way (PDF?)

(BTW, is there a LINUX-based PDF-reader around?)
 
&gt; The fact that MS keep adding absurd amount of extra functionality to
&gt; the MS office software is in keeping with the idea of making their
&gt; stuff too complex to duplicate.

Functions, maybe, but their pirate watchdogs seem to find enough
pirated copies of the software to stay busy...

&gt; But taking over the PC world requires linux to provide initially
&gt; the ability to _exchange_ at least all of the formats in MS office.

You don't seem to be asking for much here...  BTW, are the MS Word
and Excel formats available?

&gt; I realise that there is some such software out there.

I'm too new to "applied LINUX" know which they are...
'anybody help here?

&gt; But if this area can be licked, I think that linux is really going
&gt; to beat MS in 5 years.

Pep talk acknowledged... but there's one HELL of a marketing
machine pumping in that big software house...
 
&gt; I don't think that the US govt is going to beat MS anyway.

Why not?

&gt; (They've failed on other anti-trust things, like against IBM, I think.)

Don't you know the story of the AT&T break-up...?

&gt; But in the meantime, MS has given great credibility to linux,

I think they did the same thing they did when they (belatedly)
noticed the Internet... it was only a matter of time...

(and, hey! by you LINUX didn't have credibility before MS?!?)

&gt; and free advertising. In the longer term, this will matter more,
&gt; because the US court case is bound to founder

"Be careful what you dream, for dreams come true" - Faith Flower

What can we learn from Microsoft's example... that won't con-
flict with the Spirit of LINUX...?

Make it more useful and - at least in principle - easier to use
than the competition... (I'm not saying they do it all the time
but they must be doing *something* right...)

You *have* read the $14 book "MS Secrets" haven't you?

"If not now, when?" - Talmud  ;)

SOME of the ideas in it are worth applying in the LINUXhood...
