My other half wrote the response below. I've found that once I set the
mode for my monitor via the XF86Setup program, I had no problems with
using Star Office, and the speed isn't an issue - as in it's heaps faster
than Office97.

&gt; I have a question about the StarOffice 5.0, as I have downloaded
&gt; it finally. I just  read a posting to the list which is quoted
&gt; below. Is anybody able to confirm or deny this, or to offer any
&gt; suggestions, as I have and S3V card, and would like to try StarOffice.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Someone posted re an incompatibility with the S3V X-server, which
&gt; &gt; seems to be correct. 

Aint that the truth....  Total lockups were the result we were getting :-(

&gt;&gt; could install it whilst using the SVGA
&gt; &gt; installer. I was hoping that it was only the installer that is
&gt; &gt; incompatible with the S3V server but alas it appears to be the whole
&gt; &gt; program.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance for any answers/advice.

I'd like to be more definitive, but I can't...   We did a lot of
experimenting before we got the thing to install (and work), and I'm not
100% sure exactly what solved our problem.    

Anyway, as near as I can determine, it isn't so much the S3V server that
causes the problem(s), but more like the MONITOR settings...  I could be
wrong here though...  

The steps we took (and have confirmed will work) is : 
1. Get the latest S3V and SVGA servers  
     (we did this, but still had the same problems, so it may or may not
        be important)
  
2.  As root, run /usr/X11/bin/XF86Setup - Ffrom the shell - NOT Xwindows  
3.  Answer NO to 'use default settings'  
4.  When the config menu comes up - change nothing! 
5.  click 'done' and save the new defaults.  
6.  The Xserver will try to start - if you get an error message saying
    files are missing (notable XF86_SVGA) then locate and intstall it,
    then repeat steps 2-6 until the server does start.
7.  login as a regular user - startx, then run the office install program.
    It SHOULD install correctly, although you'll need to move the windows
    cos your screen will be too small for it.  If it doesn't install then
    you are back on your own (this method worked for us on two different
    systems). 
8.  After the install you can then rerun XF86Setup and enter
    your prefered monitor resolutions.  
    We are still experimenting with this ourselves - some settings causes
    office50 to lock, others cause it to run slow, and others cause it to
    run faster than office40 did (for us anyway).  

I'm currently using 24bit colour at 800x600 and office runs like a charm. 

Here is a copy of my current config <A HREF="file:">file:</A> 
(hopefully it'll help - if not, then this import will make a useful backup
for myself should things go wrong again) &lt;g&gt;

Cheers
Rod
