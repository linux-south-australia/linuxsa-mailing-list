Good on you Alex!
I read a lot on this User Group about how you all want to see Linux grow in
market share and the little I have learned so far about a "real operating
system" has encouraged me to keep going and learn how to use linux.  However for
those of us who don't have the benefit of formal education in IT, getting a
start in Linux is difficult. The word 97 quirk may be old news to most but for
those of us who are in the middle of a sharp learning curve from MS to OSS it
was some light relief along the way.  If you folk want to see linux grow you are
going to have to learn to tolerate those of us who are computer novices who get
given a computer, told the company cant afford training so learn to use it
yourself.  I didn't know the quirk and neither has anyone else whom I have
asked, thank you to whoever first posted it.
Sorry that my first posting to this group wasn't some great breakthrough, I
appreciate it as part of my learning.
Gordon.
