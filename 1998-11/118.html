&gt; ive heard of this type of thing with pgp - and i thought the way arond it was to export the uncompiled source code, and recompile it offshore.
&gt; 
&gt; pgp was available (the string version) from sweden i believe - however the author was in the States....

The history of pgp is a huge mess because of export and patent laws. 
Recently the entire source of pgp was printed and sent that outside the US
to be scanned back in.

&gt; &gt;Decryption support would make xpdf a munition...
&gt; 
&gt; decryption maybe, but the documents i dl'd were readily readable with Adobe's reader, not xpdf.....

Adobe probably has a license to export it, which would explain why they
are allowed to export Acrobat Reader. PDF documents have several options
which can disallow printing or copying of the document. Your document is
probably encrypted with RC4 and no password is required. This seems rather
pointless to me, like using ROT13 for protecting confidential files...

Mark
