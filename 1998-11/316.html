 &gt; I have a Windows NT Server (Shudder) that is running a mail server. I
 &gt; _NEED_ to count the number of bytes in _and_  out aswell as number of

 &gt; there is upto 20 domains on there at the moment.

Congratulations, you've reached the limit of WhatCanBeDoneEasily on 
an NT system.  You're finding out the hard way that any functionality
that isn't documented in the how-to guide for the point-and-drool 
user interface is bletcherously difficult to achieve.

Your solution, of course, is to Get A Real Operating System.  If you
do it right, your boss won't even notice.  One SMTP server is as good
as another, right?

 &gt; The NT Box is Running "Netscape Mail Server 2.02"

There might be some hope for you then - I place marginally more trust
in Netscape's ability to write scriptable tools than I would in MS,
but if the foundation sucks...

Just out of interest, how much did you pay for this proprietry-OS with
its proprietry mail server which does precisely the same thing as a 
free OS with a free mail server, free POP3 server and free IMAP server,
'cept that it does it slower?

 &gt; Using SNMP would be great, being able to use a program to graph the stats
 &gt; would be of some use aswell .... Im currently using MRTG to graph some
 &gt; link in and out stats. Is it possible somehow to use this ??

Not unless you can make an SNMP agent on the NT box aware of the 
mail server's logs and somehow convince it to grovel through them
in real time.

 &gt; Has anyone had experience with this sort of Problem?

Most of us probably have at some point or another.  Most of us would
follow the path of least resistance by choosing the solution I outlined
above (i.e.: "Get A Real OS").  For any modern operating system apart
from Windows NT setting up and maintaining a mail server is a complete
no-brainer (well - once you've climbed the learning curve... :-)

I suspect you already know this, otherwise you wouldn't have sent
your request to a Linux mailing list, right?

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
