Hi all,

Apologies in advance for this slightly off-Linux question, but I've
been impressed with the general pool of knowledge of the people on
this list, and I'm sure someone must have an answer for me...

I want to know who can sell me 64M of SDRAM for my VX chipset PC.

The problem is that the VX chipset only has just so many address
lines, and can't support 64MBit memory depth (so I've been told).  So
the more conventional SDRAM DIMMs available today, which have a total
of 8 chips, are not suitable.

But apparently there is a double-sided 64M SDRAM DIMM with 32chips; I
just don't know who can supply these.

I've surfed around at some of the US and Asian manufacturer's sites,
and found that these devices are actually available, so for example,
an SDRAM card with (32x) HY57V164010ATC-10 would be OK.

Conversely, an SDRAM card with (8x) GM72V661641CT-10K is not good, as
the PC can only recognise the first few MB of this one.
   
Of course my next question for the knowledgeable supplier will be:
will the 32-chip 64M SDRAM work on the newer chipsets?

Phil.
