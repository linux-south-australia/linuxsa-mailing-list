&gt; What things about KDE do you like in particular and what do you feel it
&gt; offers over other x-windows managers?  Are there things you don't like
&gt; about KDE?   I'd really just like to hear more about it from someone 
&gt; that uses it.  

*nod* I'll admit that the screenshots look quite a bit like Win95, but the
important thing is that you can configure it so it looks nothing like it.

I've found that the qt widget set (on which KDE is based) looks alot like
netscape, but still isn't exactly Windows 95 by any means.

I'd take a screenshot of KDE for you, but I use Enlightenment lately,
which I've found is nicer than anything I've used previously.

But anyway, things about KDE (these are all IMHO btw):
- Looks nicer than the default FVWM setup that comes with RedHat
- Runs faster than the really fancy shmancy WM's, such as Enlightenment.
- Combines the good bits of Win95 (MIME file associations, easy task
switching, ability to run programs from desktop) with the good bits of X
(which everybody knows about anyway :)
- Is user friendly, but not braindead.

I mainly use Enlightenment now because it does look nicer than KDE, and
it's a challenge of sorts :)
