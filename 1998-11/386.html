&gt; 
&gt; Customs duty -- the customs site (www.customs.gov.au) is actually one of
&gt; the most useful and informative government sites around.

Maybe so, but I, for one, think they could do
just a little bit *more* by way of modernisation:

"Duty Rates 

 Rates of duty payable by an importer are determined by the classification
of goods
 within the Australian Customs Tariff. As the Tariff contains more than
five thousand
 headings and sub-headings it is impossible to list specific rates here."

OK you guys... get thee into a negotiation with ACS about putting
that big bad list of rates on-line (under LINUX, of course), so
we can have another local Reference Site to point to when talking
to businesses on the Merits of our LINUX...  ;)

Seriously, didn't I read somewhere that there are no Taxes (but
what about Duties) on Books...?  I mean that they have to clear
the box as it moves on thru just means that they may want to
open it (to be sure it's ONLY books) and not that it necessarily
costs more (although I will check further into duties on this...)
