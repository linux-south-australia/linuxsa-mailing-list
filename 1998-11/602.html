Hi, I'm trying to get my new computer set up, but I'm having a few problems.

Firstly, I only have the CD for RedHat 5.0, so I decided to download the
RPMs for 5.2. I put the RPM, instimage and base directories in \rh\RedHat (I
also have a empty "i386" file in there). This is a FAT32 partation. I made
the boot and supp disk to install and everything went great, until it looked
for the install files. When I told it to look on hda1 at /rh, it told me
there was an error opening the files. if I put any other directory, it tells
me it cannot find the files.

Also, I tried putting the files on another computer and doing an "SMB image"
install. I'm assuming that copying the files to another computer and sharing
it (as "rh") in win95 is enough to prepare that computer. I went back into
the RH5.2 install, and selected the SMB image. It found me network card and
I configured it with the same IP i will use once it's properly set up. I
told the setup the IP of the computer with the install files and put the
share name as rh, but it told me there was an error mounting. when I went to
alt-f3 (or one of those), it said that the host could not be found. If I
went back into Win98, I could ping that IP though.

I then decided to install RH5.0, and upgrade all the RPMs. The installation
went fine, but since that has kernel version 2.0.32, I can't access my FAT32
partation. The kernel RPMs are too big to fit onto a disk, and I don't know
any way to "split" it onto a number of disks. My only other choise was to
use the network, but it can't find my network card. When installing 5.2, I
selected the NE200 compatible and did an autoprobe and it found the card.
When I did the setup LAN after the install of 5.0, it asked me for the
memory address, or something, which I don't know, so I went back and skipped
that. When I rebooted, I couldn't figure out how to setup the network at the
prompt (I tried "ifconfig eth0", but it said unknown device, or something
like that), so I went into X. I've only managed to get X working at about
320x240 (because I have a card based on the NVidia Riva TNT), so netcfg took
up 4 screens in fvwm. I went to interfaces, add, and selected ethernet, but
I couldn't figure how to get past that. the little diamond next to ethernet
was red, but I couldn't see any ok buttons, so I couldn't tell it what IP to
use, etc.

The network card is a SimpleNet SN3200, but Win98 and the install of RH5.2
used drivers for RealTek (and compatibles).

If you havn't guessed already, and help would be appriciated. :)
If anyone knows what I was doing wrong to install RedHat 5.2, or how to let
me read the FAT32 partation, so I can install the newer kernels and other
RPMS.

Thanks for the help, and sorry if this mail is too long, I don't know how
much information I need to give ;)

Andy
