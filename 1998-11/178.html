[...]
I bought and have read most of running linux and linux in
a nutshell  but I still cannot get my computer to see my eexpress
pro 10 card as I cannot write the instructions correctly.  I am a very
frustrated linux user.

Aaaaarrrgggghhh!
I bought one of those cards in about July 1996, and also bought
red hat 4.0 and after months of trying, just gave up and used
the OS of the masses for two years because of this.
I would have got into linux 2 years earlier if not for that card!

If it's an Intel etherexpress PCI-bus Pro/10+ like I got,
then it would be better to give it away to a friend who uses
M$ software, and get yourself a $40 EISA-bus NE2000 clone instead.
I now use a PCI-bus NE2000 clone, and it goes literally 10 times
faster than the ether "express" anyway. [But maybe that's because
I changed OS to linux too. The tests were done on FTP. Linux got the
theoretical maximum of 10 Mbps on an unloaded ethernet with this card.]

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Even if you want to get the etherexpress card going, it's probably
better to get everything going with an NE2000 clone first
(or an equally reliable 3com 3c503 or something), and then
write a driver for the intel card at leasure.
