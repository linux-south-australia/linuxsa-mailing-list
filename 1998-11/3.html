Instead of trying to copy everything over to another drive you could try
resizing the reserve space. "tune2fs" will do this. The reserve space
defaults to about 5% of the drive when the partition is formatted to
ext2. The space is reserved so that only a specific user as well as users
belonging to a certain group can take advantage of it. Normally it is set
to root/root. You can change this setting with tune2fs as well. This
reserve space doesn't show up with "df". The main use for reserve space
is ensuring that root (and daemons) still have space to write to if some
user chews up all the disk space (although many ppl would recommend
separate partition for /home, /tmp, etc...). For home users this isn't as
critical.

Unmount the partition. If it is your root partition you can mount it read
only instead. If you boot into emergency or single mode through lilo it
will probably be much easier to do this. It is very important that you
don't make any changes to a mounted partition with "tune2fs". 

"tune2fs -l /dev/hda4" will list the current settings for the partition
hda4.

Use "tune2fs -r 5000 /dev/hda4" to resize the reserve space to 5000 blocks
(1k each).

If you can't free up enough space with tune2fs you can just add another
disk and copy other an entire directory structure to it (/usr for
example). Then edit /etc/fstab to reflect the changes. When you copy the
files across make sure the ownership and permissions are kept, use "-a"
with cp or "-p" with tar.

The only information which isn't transfered through utilities like "cp" 
and "tar" is the boot information. If your kernel image has changed it
location on a disk you will have to rerun "lilo" to set up the boot
loader. To set up the boot loader on a partition which isn't the root
partition "lilo -r /mnt/newdisk" is very useful. This will get lilo to
chroot to the specified directory (treat the directory as its root
directory). If you have to fix lilo from a boot disk, that is the easiest
way to do it.

Another way would be to back up everything you want to keep (ignoring the
distribution files). This isn't as hard as it sounds since almost
everything would be under a few directories like /etc, /home, /var/named,
/root, etc.. If you take this path be very careful you backup every
directory which contains something useful. Most of these directories
(/var/spool/mail for example) can be extracted (use -p with tar to keep
perms) into their place without any hassle. For /etc you would probably
want to merge it by hand. I have done this many times (and across
different distributions) and it works well (for me anyway :)).

Whatever you do, have some good backups just in case.

Regards,
Mark
