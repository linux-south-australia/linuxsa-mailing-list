&gt; Can anyone recommend a NE2000-clone 10base2 / 10baseT ISA network card

I've bought a bunch of different NE2K clones and they all work fine. While
poor NE2K clones used to be a problem, I suspect they are no longer made. 
The biggest problem (apart from performance :)) with ISA NE2K clones is
probing. If some other driver probes the card's IO space your computer can
lock up, although it has never happened to me. This is a well documented
problem. You can get around this by reserving the IO range (check the
BootPrompt HOWTO) or ensuring the other drivers don't have to probe to
find their device. You you may need to configure the card under DOS with
the NE2K software, or use isapnptools if you have a pnp card. I doubt
jumpered NE2K's are made anymore.

&gt; If so, what is it, what is it's cost, and where can I get it? :-)

You should be able to find them for about $35 almost anywhere. The PCI
version probably costs the same and doesn't have any probing/config
problems.

Mark
