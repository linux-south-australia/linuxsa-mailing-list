Hi,
anyone here installed debian successfully including eth0, 
soundcard, etcetra.  I got veryannoyed with win95,98, nt4 and so 
on costing me yearly for the rest of my life so I said *&%$.it  I have 
had it. The free stuff is more reliable and linux looks like it is going 
where I need it to go for me so I will use that.  I will too but I am a 
win 95 user who isn't a programmer and I am finding it difficult to 
get running the way I want.  I have x set up ok but I cannot set up 
gnome or kde to have a gui more intuitive to operate than any of the 
x window managers I have so far.  At the moment I believe kde is 
the way to go for now but gnome will be the way to go probably 
next released package. When I had only the debian release on my 
newly bought 6.4 gig hard drive (for debian)  Kde ran but not 
completely.  Then I started playing as in trying to make it run better 
and now I cannot get either kde or gnome to work in any of their 
varieties.  I bought and have read most of running linux and linux in 
a nutshell  but I still cannot get my computer to see my eexpress 
pro 10 card as I cannot write the instructions correctly.  I am a very 
frustrated linux user.  I will get there with or without help but with 
help would be easier.  BTW I chose debian as it is more in line with 
the way I think and seems to have the greater potential.  ps  I hate 
Bill Gates with a passion.
cheers,
Mike
