&gt; The binary-only apps are not part of Red Hat Linux 5.2 (thus you can't
&gt; get them by FTP); they are only included with the Red Hat Linux 5.2
&gt; Official Boxed Set.  The apps included are as supplied by their
&gt; respective vendors, so the licensing & usefulness would vary depending
&gt; on the product.

Yep, I knew that. How about some pro-active sales talk here, like what apps
are actually on the CD, what versions etc... I for one won't mind a bit of
shameless advertising from Netcraft, and I am in the market for a new
set of linux CDs right about now. Am I the only one in the group who would
say OK to some marketing from Netcraft here????? I think most people
in the group except me use RedHat anyway, and for this group it's probably
as much information as sales talk.

What I really meant to ask was, where is all the detail about what you get,
what price in $Aust. The RedHat site is (so far) a bit spare on detail on the
new release.

Cheers,

Bruce
