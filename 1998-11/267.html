hey Bruce,

i'm interested in the print mini-HOWTO.

printing under linux (with a non-postscript printer) has never been easy in my opinion.

i have a BJC-4000 and a BJ-10ex, and would like both to work (not at the same time tho :))

regards
Jake

Subject: 	passwd problem

Hi all,

I have just trashed my Linux system (deliberately) and re-installed a
fresh clean distro from scratch. I chose TurboLinux, for reasons of
perverse insanity etc etc (the usual) and mostly things are going along
fine. It is a rpm based distro.

There is one annoying problem I have found which someone may have
already come across. Now everything is up and running, I can't seem to
use the passwd command as a user at the command line. The command runs,
but always assumes you want to change the root passwd, not your own user
passwd, regardless of who you are logged in as. If anyone has a hint, I
would be grateful.

I have now discovered the niceties (not!!) of setting up a canon
bubblejet printer to print colour under this type of system. If anyone
wants a mini-howto I would be delighted to tell all. The results are
satisfying, as much as for succeeding against the nazi printtool
environment as for the nice results.

Oh and does anyone know what gated does, other than fill up the
/var/log/messages file??? Is this a service I would likely need to be
running as a desktop-style client machine, ppp to the internet the only
networking???

Cheers for now,

Bruce Moffatt
