Topics:
-   simulation software for linux found
-   summary of linux office software found
-   why linux office software availability is not just a
    religious zealotry thing

--------
Now finally I've found a competitor to my AKSL simulation
environment. It's remarkably similar in style nad
specs. But it's not quite free linux software.

It's in Hungary at

    <A HREF="http://www.hit.bme.hu/phd/vargaa/omnetpp.htm">http://www.hit.bme.hu/phd/vargaa/omnetpp.htm</A>

which I found via a listing of linux scientific software
[scientific applications on linux]:

    <A HREF="http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/cgi-bin/AT-SALsearch.cgi">http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/cgi-bin/AT-SALsearch.cgi</A>

and

    <A HREF="http://sal.rising.com.au/index.shtml">http://sal.rising.com.au/index.shtml</A>

I haven't evaluated omnet++ yet, but it does look
very similar to my own discrete event simulation approach.

--------
But even more interesting for general office applications is the
existence of pages which address exactly the issues I was asking about:

spreadsheets:
    <A HREF="http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/G/4/index.shtml">http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/G/4/index.shtml</A>
    <A HREF="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/spreadsheets.html">http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/spreadsheets.html</A>

word processors:
    <A HREF="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/wp.html">http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/wp.html</A>

office software in general:
    <A HREF="http://linas.org/linux/web-project.html">http://linas.org/linux/web-project.html</A>

--------
I'm just amazed at how much has been done already.
But I still think it is a good idea to tie all of this together into
a "MS to linux conversion" page, because otherwise it's just too exhausting
to have to explain it to sceptics, point by point.
I'd much rather have a single page for this.

This is not a case of "religious" zealotry. There's a practical
problem in any research establishment that there is a tendency for
administrators to decree that there shall be a single operating system
for everybody, and the serious researchers (who tend to dislike MS)
end up having to go along with the non-PhD admin staff, who
can only use MS software on PCs.
I.e. many people who would prefer to work with Unix end up
having a PC plopped on their desk so that they can communicate
via MS doc files, which is what admin people use even to send a
2-sentence ascii message sometimes.

It's now clear to me that linux provides sufficient software to
allow the scientific/engineering staff to use linux -- and
still communicate with admin people, due to document
compatibility.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
