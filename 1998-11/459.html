Im kind of a sysadmin at my school (Hallett Cove R-12) and we have
experienced similar issues. We just "upgraded" to exchange and the network
seemed to disagree with it a bit (12 computers in the one room crashed, i
wonder if it was related?"
We are currently working on a small linux project with some 486's that we
have. one is going ot be a firewall between the Admin and Curriculum
networks so that admin can use our ISDN line without having to worry about
security. The others are going to be internet terminals and workstations /
storage areas for us sysadmins. i think that they are going to be hooked
into the main network via a linux server that we are building out of a
surplus penitum. we have had success in interfacing with the NT 4 network so
far (accessing users home directories and using the internet connection
etc.) but we have not yet tried getting users off of the network but we will
probably investigate the possibility. The other motivation for setting up
some linux boxes was to annoy the computer illiterate staff and students
that probably can't function without Windows 95 holding their hand the whole
way.

P.S
Does anyone know how to take the SHELL function out of or other wise disable
it in visual basic 3.0?
