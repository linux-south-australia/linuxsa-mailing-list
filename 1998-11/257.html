Hello Paul,
	I wonder whether I have already replied to a mail like this as it
sounds very familiar.. Anyway, My sound card is a built in Pcchips
motherboard sound card call sound pro but is identified by redhat as a
CMI8330. Anyway, I tried redhat 5.1 and the kernels but cannot get it to
work. Then 5.2 came out. I downloaded,installed and configured, and
WAhoo!!! It worked..(no tweaking necessary. When I heard Linus's voice on
the speaker, I was overjoyed.)
	The only thing now is I don't really like the desktop and would
like something like windows(where you get shorcuts on the desktop. I think
KDE does that but still can't get it installed. Will work on that.)

Well, Paul give 5.2 a try it's a kernel 2.0.36-7 i think.

Regards,
Mun Heng, Ow

p/s: If you want I can send you a copy of my pnpdump if that helps.

&gt; I am still knocking heads with this sound card, I have tried all sorts of
&gt; things to get this sound card going but nothing seems to affect it.
&gt; 	On board sound card CMI8330, Win95 sets itself up as follows
&gt; SB16;
&gt; MEM 220
&gt; IRQ 9
&gt; DAM 0
&gt; DMA 7
&gt; 
&gt; WSS;
&gt; MEM 530
&gt; MEM 388
&gt; IRQ 10
&gt; DMA 1
&gt; 
&gt; Joystick
&gt; MEM 200
&gt; I have compiled this into the kernel, have done this many times with
&gt; various settings, 4 minutes to compile timed this a few time now.
&gt; 	The other suggestion was patching the kernel currently 2.0.35
&gt; patch to 2.0.35-2 is this correct?
&gt; 	How do I identify the correct patch from an internet site.
&gt; 	How do apply the patch, the man page did not help me a lot here.
&gt; TIA
&gt; 	Paul
