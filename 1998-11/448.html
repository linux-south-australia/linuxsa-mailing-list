&gt; &gt; From what I understand of the government IT scene is that not only are
&gt; &gt; departments/groups unwilling to upgrade for the reasons cited below but
&gt; &gt; that they are unable or disinclined to pay prohibitive costs associated
&gt; &gt; with upgrades.

Ok lurker coming out of shell ....

Yes the cost is a major concern with government cutbacks etc., however, the
idea that we hate MS software is not really accurate.  As it stands we really
don't go out of our way to choose software based on price, we use it because
we need compatibility with other users and office software that gets the job
done.  What most of us need is one thing and one thing only..., to get on
with our jobs with as little hassle as possible.

Im sorry to say this but we would all love to be using the latest MS
software, and so it goes.  We simply do not have the time to make comparisons
when we have deadlines to meet that make programing for a living seem like
beach job *grin*.


&gt; &gt; Secondly, rumours have it that there is a kind of clandestine
&gt;  sub-network

Interesting point, however, probably less accurate than linux users would
like it to be, considering I have been one of the pains in the butt trying to
get our own institute server up and running and finding EDS very much in the
way, oh! not physically but financially.  (one day when drunk I'll tell you
some horror stories) oops sorry not even then I just read my employment
conditions again. :-)

&gt; &gt; development happening - with servers hidden in back-rooms etc
&gt; to just try

Try getting a server running without the rest of the network seeing it ...
the network  is monitored,  nuff said


&gt; &gt; an maintain efficient systems. Mind you - only rumour!

Hmm... I didn't think Silicon Graphics Servers were too bad myself.

&gt; Our experience is that I can tell you that it is more than a
&gt; rumour, but I didn't say that ;)

No of course not :-)

Now to the good stuff.

It's the very cost savings and security not to forget stability of using
linux ON the desktop that might be the saving grace, its amazing how much red
tape you can get through when you mention cost savings in the tens of
thousands.  I'm not saying it can be done now, however, nothing, good was
ever achieved without a fight, history proves that.

The real problem up until now has been the available software for everything
from student graphics to a GOOD office package.  Now that these issues are
quickly fading I can see a much more protracted battle for the desktop
REGARDLESS of contracts.  And speaking of contracts I have not seen nor heard
of any teacher being forced to use MS software.  MS only audit for compliance
with records against machines to prevent accidental use bye departments.  We
all make mistakes....

If we were forced to use MS stuff I can assure you its guaranteed to make
people NOT use it. It's a rule in the educational sector.

And finally some of my colleauges and myself oh, and our IT staff, are very
much aware of linux. The amount of discussion that takes place has went from
nothing a few years ago to being mentioned at least once every day, and a
discussion on its merits at least one per week

Hope this sheds some light on what can only be described and an organic
topic.
