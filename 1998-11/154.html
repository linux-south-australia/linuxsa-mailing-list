&gt; At the crux of it all there is...
&gt; 

Can I just add another to this list... 

If you have a problem, include detail. As much detail as you can. It's
a tad difficult to fix your problem if you just say:
 
&gt;Procmail doesn't work after installing Sendmail

Now, the cause for this could be a number of things... but this narrows it
down a little more.

&gt;A friend of mine installed procmail for me ages ago, and it used to work
&gt;fine. He said it was "invoked from the MTA" or something. I upgraded to
&gt;the new version of sendmail today, 8.9.1, and opted to complety replace
&gt;configuration files. My mail used to be sorted into nice tidy little
&gt;folders by procmail, but now it just stays in the standard inbox. Any
&gt;ideas?

The cause of the problem is now obvious: the old sendmail config file
pointed to procmail as the local delivery agent, while the new sendmail
file probably uses /bin/mail. To correct the problem, the user would just
have to find "Mlocal" in their sendmail.cf, and make it point to procmail
instead of mail. (Not exactly easy, I know, but I'm not a sendmail guru.
If I were to answer this mail I would probably include the instructions
contained in the procmail source)   

Thanks,
Michael.
