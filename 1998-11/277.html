People,

Tippett Information Consulting has opened the Linux Support Initiative for
BETA test to any initial recepient of this email.

To have a look, visit 
	<A HREF="http://lsi.ticons.com.au">http://lsi.ticons.com.au</A> 

The Linux Support Initiative (LSI) has been developed to help fill the
void in the support of the GNU/Linux platform.

The LSI differs from other methods of support in that it is intended to 
act as a cross-bar for consultants to communicate with other consultants
and vendors in a vendor-neutral environment.  Once a support request
has been initiated further discussion is carried out through email.

Featuring a trouble tracking system, with integration with email. The LSI
is intended to be light weight to work with.   Most of the the work that
a consultant would do with the LSI would be through email.   Management of
support requests is done through authenticated web pages at the above URL.

The main benefit that the LSI would have in for the Linux community is that
all the support request information is placed as a matter of public record,
where anyone can access problems that have been solved through the LSI and
find out what the solution may be.

Hope that people have a look at the LSI and help find bugs and issues before
the launch later this year.  It is still rough around the edges, but will 
be smoothed out before launch.

Visit the LSI pages, apply, create a company and then a contract.  Contact me
and then some credits will be added to a contract, allowing the real fun
and games to start.

Thanks for your time,

Matthew Tippett
