&gt; HI All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have watched with interest the discussions on EDS / Goverment policy /
&gt; philosophy on OSS.
&gt; 
It's amazing to see just who is out there when a topic such as this 
hits the users group. :)

I suppose I should not be surprised, but I am. 

&gt; Over the last 5 years I have worked for both the Goverment and private
&gt; enterprise. I am currently working for EDS in Network support, maintaining
&gt; Statenet (thanks for the compliment Stephen!).
&gt; 
Ahh, the lets keep it between ourselves government type of 
openness. Does not take long for EDS to feel comfortable in that 
arena I see.

But yes I understand your point too.  My comments were not 
meant to say that EDS could not do the job, but after a quick 
review of my comments I can that I did not cover the whole picture, 
my apologies (lesson learned there when making comments to the 
unknown world)

Yes all organizations have stories of excellence and ALL 
organisations make mistakes, unfortunately most are remembered 
for the mistakes. And interfacing a whole of government policy for 
computing with a large private organisation inevitable has its ups 
and downs. The fact that the departments maintaint the internal servicing for desktop machines
makes things somewhat grey when determining just who does 
what. It could be that some parties take advantage of an 
environment where blame can flippantly cast to the other side.



One thing which not very many people understand is the EDS 
business model. EDS
&gt; arrange Service Level Agreements (ie. guarantees of availability) with
&gt; customers ... the minimum SLA I have seen is 98% uptime, 0800 - 1800 business
&gt; days, 97% all other hours. Higher is quite common. For a 98% service, this
&gt; means that if the service is not available (eg. a file service) for more than
&gt; 49 / 50 hours during business , EDS will pay the customer penalty rates. There
&gt; is also a limit to the number of outages within a month ie. within a 98% SLA
&gt; there cannot be one outtage per week for that 50th hour (ie. 49/ 50)
&gt;
True, and as far as I'm concernerd the network has been just fine (see my comments on previous mail re stability)
 
&gt; Consider how many other vendors of services / software / equipment are willing
&gt; to guarantee an availability level, and give money back if they don't meet it ?
&gt; This is one of the reasons why EDS need to have control the environment being
&gt; used by it's customers. Blame for not meeting an SLA will, by default, fall on
&gt; EDS. EDS have to use "industry proven" technology to provide those services.
&gt; 
IBM tried the same approach to controlling customers ...much pain 
for almighty big blue boy there, have they ever recovered from it I 
wonder?

&gt; I would suggest that, although Linux is exceptionally stable, it currently
&gt; doesn't have the "industry proven" track record it will need to have to make it
&gt; into the corporate world. Endorsements by Oracle, Netscape, Intel etc., plus
&gt; the test of time will give it the "industry proven" track record it needs.
&gt; Initiatives, like Matthew Tippett's Linux Support Initiative will also help
&gt; address the percieved lack of "reliable" support avenues.
&gt; 
Good point

&gt; Disclaimer : The above is all my own thoughts, opinions and comments, could all
&gt; be wrong, and I might have dreamt it last night. In no way should the above be
&gt; interpreted as official statements of EDS or anyone else *.
&gt; 
I should have put one of these in too :( 

So, all my comments past and present are my own personal points of view and in no 
way represent my Department or Institute and do not reflect policy 
implied or otherwise.

Steve
