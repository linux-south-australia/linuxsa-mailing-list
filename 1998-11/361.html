&gt; Some people have been asking about the KDE window manager, and why it
&gt; isn't included in certain distributions. The problem has been that it
&gt; depends on the Qt library, which is distributed under a restricted
&gt; licence. Up til now, that is...
&gt; 
&gt; 	"Qt Free Edition to go Open Source"
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.troll.no/announce/qpl.html">http://www.troll.no/announce/qpl.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; So Geoffrey, are we going to get KDE in RH 5.3? :-)

Qt might now be open source, but that's not the only criteria that Red
Hat use when deciding what software to include in their distribution.
For example, I believe that Red Hat are trying to move away from
using/including GPLd libraries in their distribution, because if you
apply the GPL to a library, you lose the freedom(?) of being able to
write proprietary software using those libraries.  The QPL seems more
similar to the GPL than the LGPL in this respect (see part 6 of the
QPL).

<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/lgpl.html</A> explains the LGPL.  Here's a
relevant bit:

&gt; Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
&gt; ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility
&gt; programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,
&gt; applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite
&gt; different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and
&gt; don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary
&gt; license.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is
&gt; that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or
&gt; adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a
&gt; library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using
&gt; the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or
&gt; application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the
&gt; linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original
&gt; library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
&gt; Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
&gt; sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We
&gt; concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

Of course, the usual disclaimer applies.  I don't work for Red Hat;
I'm just guessing.  Their press release
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/release.phtml?id">http://www.redhat.com/release.phtml?id</A>=70 "GNOME Development Efforts
Start to Pay Off" probably gives another big hint as to what they are
working on :-).
