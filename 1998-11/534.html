&gt;  &gt;  Has anyone thought of getting LINUX and/or its Y2K-
&gt;  &gt;  Compliant Applications listed (on the former), &/or
&gt;  &gt;  a page (e.g. on *each* LINUX vendor's Web Site) that
&gt;  &gt;  states that LINUX from them is Y2K Compliant...?
&gt;  &gt;  If not now, when [Geoffrey, et al.]...?      ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Great idea.  Who wants to become legally responsible for any mishaps
&gt; that might occur if some part of the GNU system that hasn't been looked
&gt; at carefully enough or any vendor-supplied tools reveal y2k glitches?  I
&gt; can see that it might be fascinating to get lawsuits from people you've
&gt; never heard of before, and it would be a wonderful opportunity to learn
&gt; all kinds of things about our legal system that you otherwise wouldn't
&gt; get to experience.
&gt; 
&gt; And which distribution?  Should we have separate fall-guys for Debian,
&gt; SuSE, RedHat, Slackware, etc, or should we just get one person to absorb
&gt; all the lawsuits for all of them?
 
OK... so - by you - LINUX fails a test for
suitability for real-world usage?

Are you therefore suggesting that anyone
who INSTALLS such an operating system may
suffer the same "inconvenience(s)" as are
posited above...?

PS I should think that inclusion of a LINK
   to Y2K statement pages on the web sites
   of the major LINUX players (Debian, SuSE,
   RedHat, Slackware, etc.) would put the
   ball in their court(s).  This may be the
   way to go, then...
