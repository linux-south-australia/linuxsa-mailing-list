&gt; Completely disagree ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I disagree. By writting (albeit inferior) software, Microsoft has
&gt; &gt; increased the number of people using computers in everyday life. People's
&gt; &gt; acceptance of computers has increased, and acceptance only increases when
&gt; &gt; users do more using.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 	I tend to think that if MS had never happened (say, Bill was drowned
&gt; at birth), then I believe that we would all be sitting on $200-$300
&gt; multimedia network computers running open source applications from remote
&gt; UNIX machines across very high bandwidth links. All that MS has acheived is
&gt; to send the whole industry temporarily down an evolutionary blind alley for
&gt; a few years.

I disagree. MS did one good thing, that thing that it orignally set out to
do (before it discovered money), was to bring PC's to the home user. Yes,
MS now really bites, but what they did 10 years ago was rather good.

Personally, I think if MS didn't come across, we'd be sitting on
$5000-$6000 Alpha machines using some rather expensive Unix variant.
Microsoft may be warping standards to hell now, but atleast back then it
defined itself as a popular OS and managed to get the PC to the home
market.

Linux would have probably come along anyway, and we'd all be using it
(being the naturally born and bred computer people that we are *grin*),
but when you said something like "I'll email it to you" or "Yeah, just
check out my webpage, the details are there" people would either wonder
what the hell you are talking about, or tell you that they've got better
things to do than trek all the way down to the Uni just to get the file.

Yes, Microsoft is definetely a bad thing on the whole, but if it weren't
for them who would have brought the PC to the home consumer market? Apple
failed in its early stages because it didn't support a uniform low
resolution. Unix is just too goddam complex and expensive for your average
Joe Bloggs. And Linux... back then Linux was just an idea in some poor
students mind.

Don't interpret me as a Microsoft lover here - I hate their policies with
every core of my being. But it would be nice if people stopped and thought
"Hey, without Bad.Company.From.Hell, we wouldn't have this, this, or this,
would we?"
 
&gt; &gt; In the words of my father: "I don't want to have to drive the bloody
&gt; &gt; thing!" And what he says is true. It all fine and well for us as LINUX
&gt; &gt; enthusiasts to sit back and marvel out how clever we all are, and how
&gt; &gt; great LINUX is (don't get me wrong, LINUX is my preferred OS) but the fact
&gt; &gt; of the matter is, the Average Joe Bloe still shouldn't have to know how to
&gt; &gt; "drive" the computer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 	What your dad really wants then is a 3270 terminal that you just
&gt; turn on and bang - your app is immediately in your face. (or replace 3270
&gt; with wy-50, vt-320, JavaStation, etc).
&gt; 
What I think his dad really wants is spoonfeeding. No matter what OS you
use, you still have to "Drive the thing"... what about all those nasty
win95 PNP device conflicts?? Atleast linux actually tells you what's going
wrong.

 &gt; 	Now, the innovation of the user 'having to drive to
computer' is
&gt; definately an MS innovation - I will concede that point. In the real world
&gt; that could have been, the driving of the computer would have been someone
&gt; else's problem (just like the driving of the telephone exchange is not the
&gt; telephone users problem). Microsoft sold middle management on the marvellous
&gt; idea of a mainframe on every desktop, and the acceptance of such a stupid
&gt; idea by these people has generated years of meaningless work for many in the
&gt; IT industry.

It's not such a bad ideal. Isn't it half the idea of linux having your own
UNIX kinda server on your Pentium machine? :) I know it's what sucked me
in.
(besides the fact that it's alot better than other os's in lots of kool
funky ways, and it's free, but that's not the point)

&gt; 
&gt; 	Linux is unique in that it can scale from running those hellishly
&gt; complex distributed server applications down to providing an embedded
&gt; platform for NC's and PDA's. It is our responsibility to create those
&gt; solutions, and ensure that they are a more sensible and comfortable option
&gt; for Joe User than the alternative MS architectured solution. Thanks to MS
&gt; though, this is not a difficult thing to do.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yeah - well explain to me why getting X to work is still a bit of a black
&gt; &gt; art.
&gt; &gt; 
Cos it's just so goddam pretty and nice, that's why :))

X is an enigma which will hopefully be solved when video card companies
start getting their act together and realising tech specs for their cards.

&gt; &gt; LINUX has a long way to go before people will be buying it installed on a
&gt; &gt; computer out of a newspaper.
&gt; &gt; 
I dunno... not with the new initiative's that RedHat are taking. Sure,
it's bringing alot of your basic "y3ah l3ts n00k and l4nd sum d00ds" types
to the OS, it's also bringing alot of people who used to be scared of
linux.

 &gt; 	Maybe closer than you think. Not long ago mobile phones were as
much
&gt; as computers are now. You can now get a 'free' mobile by subscribing to a
&gt; service. The day is not far away when you will be able to get 'free' and
&gt; easy to use computers by subscribing to a service. When that day comes, you
&gt; can bet that Linux has a much better chance than NT / W2K of runinng those
&gt; free computers.
&gt; 
Heh. Why am I thinking of W2K as the Windows 2000 bug? :))
IMHO that's a really bad marketing idea. ie:

Y2K = Year    2000 bug
W2K = Windows 2000

&gt; 
&gt; 	As far as general bashing of MS goes, I dont have a problem with
&gt; that at all. MS will be determined to undermine Linux by direct assaults on
&gt; the internet standards themselves. While I  think that it is too late for
&gt; them to turn the game around, it just shows how low they are willing to go,
&gt; and for that they deserve nothing but the utmost contempt.
&gt;

To finalise, I think MS has done its job getting the PC to the home
market, and it's time to ditch annoying trade secrets in protocols.
