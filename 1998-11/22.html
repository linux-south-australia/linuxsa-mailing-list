&gt; Hi All,
&gt;         I'm a newbie and this is my third post in this list. I still have
&gt; not gotten sound to work in my redhat-5.1 system. A friend suggested that
&gt; I try and recompile a new kernel(linux-2.0.35.tzr.gz). I was doing that
&gt; but then(because I am booting Linux from a boot diskette as LILO cannot be
&gt; placed in the mbr of hda (I tried but it came out with the letter L and
&gt; hangs there. I guess this is because I placed the root fs near the end of
&gt; the hard-disk(g: in a 6.4GB hard disk which means it's &gt; 1024 cylinders)
&gt; 
&gt;         Anyway, when I tried to transfer the image to the floppy, that's
&gt; when I found out that I cannot access(mount) the floppy. All it does is
&gt; that it justs sit there and the light on the floppy drive would be lit. It
&gt; does that for (longest I waited - 7-10 minutes) then I ejected the disk(I
&gt; know I shouldn't do that) I even tried to format the disk using the
&gt; command - mke2fs /dev/fd0 This also just hangs there like before until I
&gt; eject the disk.
&gt; 
&gt;         FYI - I mount using the command(tried all these)
&gt;                 mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
&gt;                 mount -t vfat /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
&gt;                 mount -t msdos /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt/floppy
&gt;                 mount -t vfat /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt/floppy
&gt; 
&gt; I need to access the floppy to get the new kernel(boot disk) image to it.
&gt; Or else I cannot boot to the new kernel(linux-2.0.35) and get to configure
&gt; the sound from there.

Since you booted off a floppy, I would say the floppy is already
mounted. Try umount /dev/fd0 before mounting another one (you may need
to change directory to do this). I think the reason the sound doesn't
work because 2.0.35-1 doesn't have sound loadable as a module whilst
2.0.35-2 does. Either change kernel versions or recompile 2.0.35-1. I
had this problem, and recompiling with sound inside the kernel fixed it
up.

PS Try fiddling around in BIOS and see if you have the option of using
the disk as type LBA. That should allow you to boot off the HD which is
a little easier than using a floppy all the time.
