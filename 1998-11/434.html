&gt; 
&gt; i have a linux box called linux.hallett-cove.schools.sa.edu.au
&gt; (i.e. linux)
&gt; i have it sharing SMB, http, ftp & telnet.
&gt; problems:
&gt; 
&gt; 1)
&gt; doing "smbclient //linux/share" works fine, but trying to mount it on a 95
&gt; machine asks for a password (on a guest share?) no passwd works on the other
&gt; linux box when i get it to mount it.
&gt; 
&gt; 2)
&gt; typing "linux.hallett-cove.schools.sa.edu.au" in a 95 web browser won't
&gt; bring up the web page, but 100.6.2.1 will.
&gt; 
&gt; 3)
&gt; how do i set up an ftp user? ive tried logging on as root, but it won't let
&gt; me. i want to do this so i can upload the web page from any machine. smb
&gt; would be ok if it worked.
&gt; 
&gt; we have a NT 4 server serving the domain, dns, web, etc, if it makes a
&gt; difference.

All users etc are setup as 'normal' users. Most programs don't allow
remote access via root, though you can change this.

SMB: I have a user called 'samba' on my box, and have it set so that
people who log on as guest via SMB have the permissions of that user. =&gt;
man smb.conf I think

DNS: Is the linux box on the internet? If it's only the local domain,
then everything after linux probably isn't even bothered with, this may
be NT's fault, I'm not too sure of this.

FTP: same problem as SMB, setup a non-su account and make sure they have
permissions to change whatever you want.

I've found with RH5.1 you can't set "no-password", it just dumps '!!' as
password in the /etc/passwd file, if you delete this, then it doesn't
ask for a password when loggin in via that account.

Good luck,

Dave Lawrence
