IMHO StarOffice 5 isn't really worth it.. sure, it's got all the whiz
bangs of the windows product, but that's where it seems to choke and
die. It feels very much like the programmers were hired to do a "direct
port from the windows version" and took it a little too literally. It's
even got it's own windows 95 widgets and start button.

I'm not writing this message to start a flame war. I'm writing this
message to warn those people who have to pay 20c per meg for their
bandwidth if you're looking for the Next Big Thing for OSS computing, this
isn't it (1). I just feel lucky that I'm not volume charged, or I'd be
paying $15 when I could be downloading GNU apps instead.

Ah, I hear you cry, but what other software of this variety is availble
for free download, and will compile under linux? I think gnome has some
pretty nifty editors, but I've yet to check it out... but still, for those
of us who have access to windows boxes running Office (ie at work, tafe,
etc), I really don't see the point. I might aswell go use my sister's
486: atleast there Office is in it's own native environment... and I can
easily telnet into my box for everything else *grin*.

I think it would have been a brilliant program, if only the developers had
been allowed a bit of free reign to explore X. A Qt or gtk version of so5
would have been great. I just feel kinda annoyed, because I use linux to
get away from the windows interface (I've found KDE to be very nice) and
then this big hunk of a NextBigThing program comes along and turns my X
server into a very slow windows box.

Sure, the program's great for new linux converts... but most of the new
linux converts I know don't even know how to get X working, let along
install the new glibc libraries.

One more thing, so you don't misquote me on all this, I'm not having a go
at StarOffice as a whole, I'm having a go at the way it's been developed.
X and linux apps should be nice and original - with maybe a few features
nicked from other OS's, but not a direct rip from that program/OS
combination we love to hate. And yes, it does have some rather nifty bits,
but I can't help feeling that I'm running a Windows emulator at half
speed.

 Anyway. I've had my fun. &lt;/mindless rant mode&gt;

Michael.

(1) And if it is, god help us all. :)
