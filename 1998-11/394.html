Hi all,

This sounds like a great idea, but there is one small problem.

The SA Government, with the exception of Work Cover, have three
main forces in effect that would stop them from taking part.

1) SA government signed a 20 year Microsoft contract for all
workstations and servers.

2) SA government signed a Microsoft exclusive agreement that
expressly forbids the use of any products not from MS.
* There are some small exceptions to this.

3) EDS run the show and their official line is MS all the way.

This goes to the point of being unable to install netscape
without being sued! And yes MS do audit government machines
regularly.

I supported the only two Linux boxes in the government (that I am
aware of) with the help of NetCraft and let's just say...
Their days are numbered...

The government is committed to NT all the way and then some.

I would like to see them change but I don't think it is legally possible
until the MS and EDS contracts are removed and don't expect that
to happen in your working lifetime. :(

But don't worry their is a whole world of corporate opportunity out
their... And your catch phrase could be...
"The government doesn't use it so, it must be good." :)

*climbs off soap box*

&gt; you might not know that some linux people in Melbourne put on a
&gt; business breakfast on 17 November 1998, and that it went very well.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't this be a great idea in Adelaide?
&gt; The idea, in my opinion, would be to have 8 computers (or so) around
&gt; a room, with demos ready to go, and a speaker for each machine.
&gt; Then each speaker gets 15 minutes to demonstrate their particular focus on
&gt; linux and explain it.
&gt; [We could even get the premier to come along and explain
&gt; how his initiatives brought linux to SA and cheated the other
&gt; states of this job-creating development. Someone will have explain
&gt; linux to him though first.....]
&gt; 
&gt; We could even have NT on one of the machines for fairness!?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; PS.  I'm happy to do a demo of the communications research
&gt; applications of linux. Then we should also have a web server demo,
&gt; file server, home computer with office software, games demos, etc.
&gt; And all machines should be ethernetted together and connected
&gt; to "the" net.
