&gt; Now the shameless advertising: we'll be selling the Red Hat Linux 5.2
&gt; Boxed Set for $69 + shipping.  If you place your order now, you'll
&gt; receive a $10 discount (offer closes next Tuesday, the 10th).

I read that APC will be including RH5.2 on the cover CD of their Linux
Pocketbook, due to be released this month sometime... The pocketbook is
about $14 or $15... I would doubt that it would include the extra apps
that come with the boxed set, and it may skimp on the source code
modules, too... Do you have any other information about it? (as one of
APC's Linux people) Will it include any extra apps not in the boxed set?
How worthwhile will the pocketbook's contents be? (better than the Win98
one?) Anything else that you (or anyone else) know?

Also, is there anything along the lines of the much-talked-about 
"ConfigFest" planned for LinuxSA? Could be worth doing, along with another
InstallFest, especially with the Pocketbook around...
