Hey All,

Been having fun with my computers. Scrubbed my server and reinstalled
RH5.2 on it, and got that running perfectly, except for one thing. Which
I'll tell you about in a minute :)

On such a high after getting RH5.2 installed and configured in an hour
and a half that I decided to put it on my PII-300. Tell ya, I should
have gone to bed!

I have a 6.4Gb HDD, and NT4 installed in a 4Gb partition, and I did a
"workstation" install in the 2Gb that was remaining, but it installed
LILO in the MBR and managed to completly screw up the partition table
(or I did trying to repair the MBR). Then I couldn't fdisk from DOS
6.22, but I tracked that down to having the IDE Zip installed in the
BIOS, took that out and fdisk worked first time...

Anyways, I now have my machine back up. And the server is running except
for one little detail. I want the computer to automatically log on on
startup, and reconnect if the connection drops out. I added a line:

pp:3:respawn:/usr/sbin/ppp-on

to the /etc/inittab, but when I do that, it starts to dial, then says
that device pp is respawning to fast and has been disabled for 5
minutes. Then it stop's dialing and puts it bacl "on hook". The DTR
light stays on. If I then log in and run ppp-on myself, it connects and
goes through and everything, but when the 5 minutes is up it disconnects
the modem and then proceeds to dial in again.. and does it every 5
minutes... How can I get it to wait for it to connect before it times
out??

Cheers
Dazz
