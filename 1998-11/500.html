&gt;PS.  Can anyone tell me what's the best sort of keyboard?
&gt;My PC keyboard is worse than my old Remmington typewriter -- which
&gt;I took to the city dump becasue it was too heavy.
&gt;I want something which is a total pleasure to use!

&gt;Alan,
&gt;
&gt;I am not that much of a keyboard coniseur but I hve been using Mitsumi
&gt;keyboards for years.
&gt;This may surprise some as they are very inexpensive and I have had
&gt;fantastic performance from them.

Snip

&gt;If I was to get keen which I might do soon I would look at the Honeywell
&gt;keyboards as they do have a good reputation, however upon seeing Marks
&gt;comments on the Microsoft one I might even take a closer look at those.
&gt;
if you are a typist ( all fingers )  the ergonomic keyboards are great ..
if you hunt and peck they are a pain in the but !
the Honeywell keyboards are great, there were some cheap versions of 
them which had a gritty feel to them ....
my  customers have had very good runs with the cheaper mitsumi 
keyboards 

My $0.02

&gt;HTH
&gt;Kind Regards
