&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Perhaps we can organise a book-buy (import it
&gt; &gt;  from an on-line discounter.. taking advantage
&gt; &gt;  of any quantity discounts, saving on shipping
&gt; &gt;  as well...
&gt; 
&gt; How much did Alex say it cost? I was at the back of the room and couldn't
hear
&gt; very well.... Was it about $60?
&gt; 
&gt; Dazz

Well, one on-line discounter (in USA, of course) told me:

 "The discount schedule is as follows:

  1-2 books     25% off retail
  3-10 books    30% off retail
  11-30 books   33% off retail
  31-100 books  35% off retail
  101-200 books 38% off retail

  The retail price for the "DNS & BIND" is $32.95.  It does not matter how
  many books you order since it is an overseas shipment it will go by exact
  weight of the package.  

  [Re: Cost of Shipping] I can weigh them and give you a shipping price,
  if you order them.  It usually takes 3-6 weeks to ship overseas.  Let
  me know if you would like me to place an order for you."

 If we have enough interest in buying 31 books, I suppose the cost might
 drop to around:

     Au $ 46.00 each  (compared with Au $ 60.00 or 70.00 locally...)

 (assuming an exchange rate of US$ 0.60 / Au$ and use of "DHL WorldMail"
 - air to Oz, then by ground to destination; used by one on-line peddler -
 which adds $ 7 per shipment and $ 6 per book)

 Of course, one problem is where to CHARGE the Au$ 1430 (i.e. until the
 books arrive; I, for one would certainly NOT like to send a cheque...)

 Any thoughts?
