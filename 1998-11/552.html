&gt; Hi Linux' People....
&gt; I finally got my modem going and I am able to send faxes, but I just can't
&gt; get it to connect to the net. I am trying to use kppp via kde. As far as I
&gt; can see all the settings are there, but everytime I click connect, it sends
&gt; the ATZ to the modem and says expecting OK, but that doesn't seem to be
&gt; forthcoming. I thought, if I can send a fax, I should also be able to
&gt; connect to the net? Any ideas?

This is usually caused by the user who is trying to start the 
session not having correct permissions to read and write to 
and from the serial port. There are a number of ways to fix this,
one involves changing the permissions of the device so your user/group
has permission... 'chmod 660 /dev/ttyS0' will set the first com port
to read/write for its owner and group. Just add all users that
you want to access the port to the group that owns it (i created
one called modem  and set the port owner and group as that) and then
all should be working. That fixed it for me with kppp.

BTW, to set the permissions of the port and change its ownership,
you must su to root first.
 
If you use Redhat, you could also try usernet which overcomes all those
problems, as long as you have allowed all users to activate the ppp
interface in the network settings. It is not as nice as kppp but
it does the same job in the end.
