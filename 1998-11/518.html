Hi.

I was reading about how to install my IOMega ZIP Plus drive and found out, on
the Zip Drive Mini-HOWTO, section 3.4, that:

(By the way, it looks like you don't need to switch your PC off to connect the
ZIP -- just make sure the module is not loaded and the drive is turned off,
then plug it in,
turn the drive on, and load the module.)

<A HREF="http://www.njtcom.com/dansie/zip-drive-3.html">http://www.njtcom.com/dansie/zip-drive-3.html</A>#ss3.4


But I recalled reading on Linux I/O port programming mini-HOWTO, section 6.1
that

Finally, a warning: Be careful with grounding. I've broken several parallel
ports by connecting to them while the computer is turned on. It might be a good
thing to
use a parallel port not integrated on the motherboard for things like this.
(You can usually get a second parallel port for your machine with a cheap
standard
`multi-I/O' card; just disable the ports that you don't need, and set the
parallel port I/O address on the card to a free address. You don't need to care
about the
parallel port IRQ, since it isn't normally used.)

The questions are:
    Can or can't I plug and unplug the ZIP drive without causing damages?
    Isn't this a contradiction in the Linux Documentation Project?

    Does anyone have any experience with a ZIP Plus Drive?
    Has the imm driver gone stable? If it is still alpha, is it safe to use?

Thank you.

Any answers will be greatly appreciated.
