&gt;  Background:  LINUX is reported to work
&gt;  OK on the faster 386DX-based systems

The biggest problem with the older slower cpus isn't the processor it is
the small amount of ram they normally have. It is possible with a bit of
trickery to get an older distribution (or a DIY one) onto a computer with
2MB ram. There are even floppy based distributions which will boot with
under 1MB of ram. These are normally based on a v1.0 kernel with some
modifications.

X is "not fun" with less than 8MB ram. If you want a windowing environment
to work in less ram MGR might be ok.

If you want to see what it is like to have less ram try "mem=4M" at
the lilo prompt.

&gt;  Is there a way to create a virtual parti-
&gt;  tion... i.e. spread over several drives,
&gt;  so that - e.g.- 3 (or 4)  250 Mb drives
&gt;  could "look like" a 1 Gb drive...
&gt;
&gt;  enabling the installation of all of (say)
&gt;  RH 5.x and still having space for some
&gt;  data & other applications?

It is possible to with this with "md". I don't know of any distributions
which support this during the installation process. If you have several
hard drives just partition them carefully and you can utilize the drives
almost as much without the overhead of md.

Mark
