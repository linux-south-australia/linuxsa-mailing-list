Before I go on, I consider myself a dedicated LINUX enthusiast, and well-known Microsoft hater. But I feel there is a difference between "balanced criticism" and just bashing for bashing's sake.

My comments on mindless slogging stand.

I disagree. By writting (albeit inferior) software, Microsoft has increased the number of people using computers in everyday life. People's acceptance of computers has increased, and acceptance only increases when users do more using.

In the words of my father: "I don't want to have to drive the bloody thing!" And what he says is true. It all fine and well for us as LINUX enthusiasts to sit back and marvel out how clever we all are, and how great LINUX is (don't get me wrong, LINUX is my preferred OS) but the fact of the matter is, the Average Joe Bloe still shouldn't have to know how to "drive" the computer.

&gt;off the street can use it, you are reducing functionality. 

Yeah - well explain to me why getting X to work is still a bit of a black art.

LINUX has a long way to go before people will be buying it installed on a computer out of a newspaper.
