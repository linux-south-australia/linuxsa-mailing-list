&gt; I would prefer it if people would like to make comments about this email
then
&gt; do it privately.

Hehe, sorry to firstly be violating your last wish, Matthew, but I think
discussion of issues which affect all members of the list are worth doing
publicly. Also, there is one particular statement you made which I feel
rather strongly about and which I feel warrants a public reply.

&gt; 	1) Keep personally directed comments/likes/dislikes personal.
&gt; 		If you think that what someone has posted something 
&gt; 		that is worth flaming, take the flame to the person
&gt; 		directly.  If it is an intelligent comment that adds
&gt; 		to the thread then by all means post it.

As far as I am concerned, and I know that there are others who share these
sentiments, personal comments and flaming are not welcome at all, either
publicly or privately. If you have constructive comments to make, whether
they be supportive, contradictory or corrective, by all means post them - to
the original poster if you feel they are not likely to be of general
interest, otherwise by all means let us all hear what you have to say.

But keep personally directed comments to yourself (and your close friends if
the need to vent something becomes too great! :) If you can't redirect your
hostilities somewhere inert, consider counselling! And as far as I'm
concerned, anyone should feel free to bring their concerns to the list if
they feel they have been in receipt of any private mail which they consider
highly inappropriate. Please remember that the *list* is the public forum
where responses are invited. Indeed, a public post is itself an invitation
for public comment, scrutiny and contradiction, where appropriate. They are
not, however, solicitations for written abuse, either publicly or privately.

At the very least, anyone feeling that they are the victim of unsolicited,
abusive e-mail should direct their concerns to the list administrators.

Technically oriented people seem to have a predilection for strong views. I
know, I'm like that, too. But, please, lets make sure we conduct ourselves
here in a civilised manner.

Regards to all,

Wayne
