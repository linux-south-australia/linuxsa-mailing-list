 &gt; I find this about non-MS products being banned etc very interesting,

Educational systems are one of the exceptions to the contractual rule --
Sometimes.

It goes something like this:

  "We want to do XXXX.  Does Microsoft produce some software that
   does XXXX?  If so, it's illegal to use something else.  If not,
   we're free to use third-party alternatives."

I think the various educational segments within the Govt (DETAFE,
DECS, etc) have defined their requirements narrowly enough that
MS can't provide a solution in certain cases that suit the educational
institutions[1] :-)  Clever, eh wot?  There can be other ad-hoc
exceptions on a case by case basis;  There's a section within the
ministry which acts as an arbitrator, and has the legal authority
to deem that certain special cases are outside the realm of the MS
contract.

The rule means high-end servers can still be non-MS, as can certain
embedded systems (firewalls, some web servers, mail relays, etc).
Just to complicate matters, EDS can (in theory) provide the govt
with any solution they wish to provide, MS or non-MS, because the
MS agreement binds the government, not EDS.

The MS rule only applies to new acquisitions, too -- Which lead to one
department (where I know a few people) refusing to upgrade their
department-wide email software for four years because they knew that
upgrading meant a forced migration to MS Exchange, whereas they could
continue to use WordPerfect Office for as long as they like if they
never upgraded it.

The state of Open-Source advocacy within the Government is probably
at about the same point that Open-Source advocacy was at in the
non-Government Corporate world five years ago.  Not a happy scene.
It may change, but the MS agreement will probably prove to set them
back ten or fifteen years when we look back on it in a few decades
time.

[1] maybe they put the words "must comply with standards" in their
    specification documents &lt;smirk&gt;
