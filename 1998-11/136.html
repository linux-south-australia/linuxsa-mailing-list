&gt;It says, "I'll drink to that!" whenever you type "I'm something or

I never mentioned anywhere that including bill gates was funny. That was you!

(Re-read all the posts very carefully before replying!)

It was an example, somewhat pertinent to the topic of this list, that's
all. Talk about getting the wrong end of the stick! Once again David, it's
not about bill gates, it's about your attitude. 

&gt;It's not funny, it never was.  It was always ignorant and juvenile.

Heh heh

Funny is in the eye of the beholder, mon frer. I'm laughing at the moment,
as are many others, and not just because of the bill gates joke. You missed
many points, but I'll help you...

1) Some people did find it funny. Live with it.
2) It has been proposed that your attitude is rude and arrogant, and that
you need to lighten up. You have proved this to be correct.
3) You do yourself no justice by replying in such a way a group of people
who have done nothing but agree on your attitude. You also picked a thread
that your opinion on - is a minority opinion.
4) If you don't have anything constructive to say, don't say anything.

&gt;Grow up.

I guess at the end of the day only the programmer will know the reasons for
the bug/egg/thing that we are discussing. It will always be a speculative
argument anyway. One thing however is quite apparent. "Tis you who must
grow up David!"

Cheers

Alex!
