Topics:
-   OSS simulation software for linux found
-   problem with staroffice 5.0 and redhat 4.0 found

Linux persons:

Just to finish off my postings about simulation software for linux,
here's a summary what happened.

After contacting <A HREF="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">gnu@gnu.org</A>, and being told that the matter would
be passed to Richard Stallman (i.e. the matter that I was suggesting
getting a GNU simulation library project going), I found the OMNet++
simulation software in Hungary, discovered that the software was
very close to what I have done over the last 10 years, and contacted
the principal author to see what the commercial conditions are.

In reply I was told that he (Andras Varga) had been thinking for
a while of converting to the GPL licence -- and he will now
do this in November, as a result of my e-mail!!

The really excellent-looking OMNet++ simulation software is at:

    <A HREF="http://www.hit.bme.hu/phd/vargaa/omnetpp.htm">http://www.hit.bme.hu/phd/vargaa/omnetpp.htm</A>

There could be a good opportunity for collaboration in this.

Cheers, and thanks for all the hints,
Alan Kennington.

PS. On the office software front, all looks well with the
staroffice software. Michael Firkins &lt;<A HREF="mailto:michael@home.lyppard.com.au">michael@home.lyppard.com.au</A>&gt;
gave me the most significant lead in this by suggesting to
use "strings" on the "non-existent" binary. It turned out that
the file /lib/ld-linux.so.2 is required by the staroffice "setup"
binary, whereas redhat 4.0 only gives you /lib/ld-linux.so.1.xy,
for some "xy". But the message seemed to say that the file "setup"
did not exist, when just the library did not exist.
This incomprehensible warning message in the loader cost me
a couple of days' work. Obviously loaders should give more
meaningful messages!
