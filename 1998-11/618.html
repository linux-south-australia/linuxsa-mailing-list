&gt; Subject: Unibooks and Redhat5.2
&gt; Date: Monday, 30 November 1998 23:38
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to order Redhat 5.2 at Unibooks, Levels Campus

Why? Was their price so much better than you can get either
from NetCraft or other local (meaning interstate) suppliers?

I've seen too many out-of-date RedHat boxed sets in local
bookshops and - despite their age - priced at about $ 90!

Even after the NetCraft's discount-period end(s), their
list-price is $ 69

BTW, I just saw an announcement - on one of the linux.announce
newsgroups - that told of one of those multi-distribution CD-
sets (with 6 CD-ROM's, I believe)... RedHat 5.2 with (later
than 5.2's boxed-set) kernel 2.0.36, no less...

(c.f. InfoMagic's COMMERCIAL posting of a day or two ago in
the linux.announce newsgroup... "on a news server near you")

To be honest, I was not a little disappointed that RedHat 5.2
(with files dated mid Oct 98) came here just in time to help
us MISS the new, stable 2.0.36 kernel (of November)...

Why it's almost like MS...

&gt; and was told they are unable to supply it
&gt; (or even order it), apparently because of a
&gt; contractual agreement with Prentice Hall.

Anti-competitive agreements stink!

And from a "student-owned" (or am I wrong)
university bookshop, no less...

I'd say this is a job for ACCC... it
would only cost you an e-mail to see

Send a cc: of that e-mail to our journo
at the Advertiser, while you're at it

&gt; Prentice Hall used to distribute RedHat 5.1 (so I'm told)

So what?

&gt; Now...
&gt; 1) apparently they don't have the distribution rights for RedHat 5.2.

Where is it written that one needs such rights to distribute LINUX?!?

Even RedHat's inst'n book says
you can legally reproduce it
(for subsequent distribution)

&gt; 2)Unibooks won't stock it, or order it in as it's not 
&gt; supplied at an 'educational' price.

It doesn't *need* to be supplied at such a price
(altho one could argue that the low-cost CD-ROM-
sets around should be deemed equivalent to that
Educational Pricing... after all, those learning
UNIX might well content themselves - during that
initial exposure - to a "cheapie" binary-only
distribution...

And I got the impression that InfoMagic's new
Developer's Tools 6 CD set (above) might well
include source and a heap of applications...

I suspect that NetCraft may have problems like
your uni.bookshop going "outside the church"
for products like that... which is sad...
contractual-loyalties don't serve this market
IMHO...

With a bit of luck, the big CD-ROM dealer,
just south of Victoria Square will soon get
the InfoMagic's CD-ROM set (he's had earlier
ones, I've noticed... as well as others'...
for years now...) for under $ 50 (but I don't
think this set includes support... correct
me if I'm wrong...)

&gt; [Netcraft is still in business :-) ]
&gt; 
&gt; Still, for a bookshop at an educational institution this seems
&gt; pretty lame.  

Possibly unlawful... e-mail ACCC today to see...

I'd be interested in hearing its reply...
