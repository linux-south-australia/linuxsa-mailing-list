&gt; 	I tend to think that if MS had never happened (say, Bill was drowned
&gt; at birth), then I believe that we would all be sitting on $200-$300
&gt; multimedia network computers running open source applications from remote
&gt; UNIX machines across very high bandwidth links. All that MS has acheived is
&gt; to send the whole industry temporarily down an evolutionary blind alley for
&gt; a few years.

Apologies if I'm cluttering this mailing list with an irrelevant message.
It's just that this comment from Steve is quite pertinent to Stephen Fry's
book "Making History" which I've just about finished reading at the moment.

For those who haven't read it, the plot revolves around the two main
modern day characters altering history so that Adolf Hitler was never born.
The idea being no WWII and the atrocities committed during it.  The result,
however, being a worse, or no better, 20th century.

Since it was just a coincidence that this comment should be made whilst I am
reading the book, I was wondering that if Bill Gates were never born, 
would there still be a Microsoft, perhaps by a different name?

Again, apologies for wasting bandwidth on a non-linux related comment.
(I presume there is an alt.hate.microsoft news group or something similar
which is more appropriate.)
