&gt; you might not know that some linux people in Melbourne put on a
&gt; business breakfast on 17 November 1998, and that it went very well.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't this be a great idea in Adelaide?
&gt; The idea, in my opinion, would be to have 8 computers (or so) around
&gt; a room, with demos ready to go, and a speaker for each machine.
&gt; Then each speaker gets 15 minutes to demonstrate their particular focus
on
&gt; linux and explain it.
&gt; [We could even get the premier to come along and explain
&gt; how his initiatives brought linux to SA and cheated the other
&gt; states of this job-creating development. Someone will have explain
&gt; linux to him though first.....]
&gt; 
&gt; We could even have NT on one of the machines for fairness!?

I understand that South Australia is signed-up for an
All-Microsoft (Windows / Office, etc.) whole-of-gov't
license agreement... maybe that "use it at work, then
you can - legally - use it on a computer at home" li-
cense term (for application software at least) did it

How could I resist asking about the gov't's Microsoft
contractual ties if he did?  ;)

Anyway, the idea is a good one... mostly...

PS Maybe you could start by showing & telling of your
comm's research application at a LINUX SA meeting...?
