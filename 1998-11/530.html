&gt; I have just had another amazing Linux experience.. for those
&gt; with RedHat 5.1 and above (not sure about previous versions)
&gt; there is a tcl/tk front end to Postgres which makes it
&gt; look like MSAccess97 called PgAccess.
&gt; (type 'pgaccess')

You see, that, IMNSHO, is one of the bigger problems with linux...
there's all these excellent programs such as wget lying around in the bin
directories (note plural) that do excellent things, but you kinda just have to
know that they're there, and what they do. 

Especially inhibiting is the fact that half of these program's names look like
an entry in the encrypted database file...are we just supposed to *know* that
there's a program called "fpoert" in the bin dir that fixes that problem
you've been sweating over all night?

Call me a sook, but a nice, friendly local software map, (or even an index
with descriptions) would make life a lot easier not only for our cherished
newbies, but also for us poor advocats that put someone onto linux only to
have them complain that they can't do anything in linux that they could in
windows.

The fact of the matter is, you can do almost everything in linux that you can
in windows, plus a host of other things that you certainly can't do in
windows, and you can do those things much quicker and triumphantly better, 
*IF* you can find the command!!! What usually happens is that newbies just put
up with not being able to send faxes/resume downloads/direct cable connect/etc
etc etc for months, and then someone tells them, "oh, there's a command called
'uudjeid' that does that..."

Anyway, there probably is such a reference around...hidden in the
/usr/local/back'o'bourke/beware_of_the_leopard/bin/ directory, that you start
by typing "plshlpme."

&lt;/PATHETIC WHINGE&gt;
