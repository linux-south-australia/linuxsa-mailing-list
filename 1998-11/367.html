&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If I remember correctly, most intro texts to Unix/Linux include a section
&gt; &gt; on text formatting. Browse a real bookstore (like Dymocks - don't work
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; them, but they have a consistently good range of Linux/Unix books) and
&gt; &gt; check out the Unleashed series and similar.
&gt;
&gt; Dymocks (at Marion shops) had some LINUX books, as you say, but...
&gt; RH 5.1 (or was it 5.0) for about $90 (!) when I was there...
&gt;
&gt; The Book Shelf (across from Adelaide Inst of TAFE) had its LINUX
&gt; books on the TOP SHELF (i.e. *above* UNIX books...); but, again,
&gt; the only RH boxed sets were older...
&gt;
&gt; If you (or anyone else) DOES get to such a (local) book store,
&gt; may I suggest you tell them that their RH boxed sets are OBSO-
&gt; LETE (or at least not the current edition)?
&gt;
&gt; (There is a chance that - like their US counterparts - they
&gt; just might discount these older sets (like they do for MS-
&gt; books after each new version arrives...), i.e. so that LINUX
&gt; becomes more attractive to the (e.g. student) marketplace.

OK, I admit it. I'm in Sydney and Dymocks has a very large computer section
with hundreds of Unix related titles. The original post was about groff etc. I
don't think RH5.0, 5.1,or later is relevant. Unix SystemIII, V, UnixWare, SUNOs
(very good for nroff) etc will all have a decent section.

And just for the record. I tend to have one release (SLackWare in my case) that
is fairly recent and just download new kernels as they become available.
Everything else is too hard.
