I find this about non-MS products being banned etc very interesting, as at our
school we have netscape on 20+ computers and I was even permitted to install
Linux on one. We use Netscape due to the fact it has page composer built-in and
so far has been much easier to get running without spontaneous blue screens and
GPFs. I would also like to point out that Encylopeadia Britannica CD will
_only_ work with Netscape. IE3 or 4 is a definate no-no. I wonder if the ban
covers situations such as this, as IE3/4 and Netscape _DO NOT_ co-exist on the
same system.
Worth thinking about.....
Sam.

&gt; The last time I worked on DETE (Education Department) machines, Netscape

&gt; In fact, I was cautioned against installing Internet Explorer on any of the
&gt; machines that I used.
&gt;
&gt; EDS still maintain machines running various flavours of UNIX that they
&gt; inherited from government agencies, but as far as I know, none of them use
&gt; Linux.

&gt; &gt; This goes to the point of being unable to install netscape
&gt; &gt; without being sued! And yes MS do audit government machines
&gt; &gt; regularly.
