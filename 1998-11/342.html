Hi all,

2 cents time...

&gt; &gt;What Microsoft has done to the collective IQ of computer users is a crime
&gt; 
So very true, as is proved by the next comment.

&gt; In the words of my father: "I don't want to have to drive the bloody
&gt; thing!"
&gt; And what he says is true. It all fine and well for us as LINUX enthusiasts
&gt; to sit back and marvel out how clever we all are, and how great LINUX is
&gt; (don't get me wrong, LINUX is my preferred OS) but the fact of the matter
&gt; is, the Average Joe Bloe still shouldn't have to know how to "drive" the
&gt; computer.
&gt; 
This mentality doesn't hold in my opinion.
It is like saying that "I want to drive my car but why should I learn the
road rules". In fact it is even worse than that. It is saying "I want to be
driven." Which is exactly what MS is doing, driving the average user
in a direction that they don't necessarily want to go and what is even
worse is that they actively pull down the competitions sign posts down
so you don't know you can take another route.


And as for the comment that MS have opened up the computer world
to Joe Bogs by making them easy to use...

If I sold a PC with Win XX to a customer and handed them a box and
an un-opened CD the first thing they would do is ring consumer affairs.
It is a matter of perception, everyone expects Win XX to be installed
on the PC. Ask Joe how hard it was to install and sure he will say
"it wasn't" because he has never done it.

I generally find it easier and certainly quicker to install and configure
Linux than Windows. (granted with the exception of new video cards...)

Most users (in my experience &gt;90%) have never managed to solve
even the simplest problem ("problem" definition: a computer or any
other piece of equipment that has a power on button, acting in a
manner different to the way the user believes it should act) because
their first reaction is not to think but to EXPECT someone else to
fix it.

Now I'm not saying that all users have to become experts but just
as with driving a car, operating heavy equipment, etc... the 'user'
knows that there is a minimum level of knowledge that they must
obtain before they can expect to be able to control it.
Strangely enough the 'user' thinks that computers don't fit into
this category. Well this may come as a shock but, they do!

If you are unwilling to learn the basics of computers it is unfair
on yourself to expect to be able to use them.

Case example...
My own mother used to come to me just about every time a
dialog box appeared on the screen. One day I made it clear that
this was ridiculous and that she shouldn't be afraid to read
the message (RTFM) and think about the problem. Now she
almost never has to ask for help. When she does ask for help
here questions are usually about a concept not, do I hit button
A or B.

And don't think I haven't given the same treatment to paying
customers... and with the exception of one person... in the
long run they have all been grateful. People like to learn and
feel in control, it is just sad that the MS mentality is so strong.

&lt;/RANT&gt;

Deep calming breaths.... In... Out.... In... Out...


Nick Stock.
