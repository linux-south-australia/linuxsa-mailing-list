Sorry, I know some of you must be getting tired of beginners. Mind you, I've
got about 20 years of computing behind me on Macs, Simulog Simulators, CPM,
etc.... but I can't get my head around some things in Linux, that upset me
badly... I've asked the other forums and no one can come up with much, so
maybe you can help me. Please, please, please...
I am using COL 1.3

1. I have a ESS Soundcard( ES688F). According to the HOWTO and the docs I am
supposed to set it up as a Soundblaster. But the darn thing won't even beep.
Why?

2. My Modem is a Spirit Viper, with Rockwell Chips on it (RC288DPi and
L39/U). When I query the modem via the little utility in KDE it answers and
sends signals around without a problem. However, if I try to dial out, ie.
to the internet, it sends the init string to the modem and waits for a
response, and that's it... In the log window it just says, "waiting for
response". This message might stay for an hour or so. The system hasn't
crashed, it just can't get a signal from the modem. (However, the same
procedure in the Query Modem works just fine)

3. My trusty Deskjet 540 doesn't like to print under Linux. I've configured
it with LISA and checked that the directories are all there, that printcap
is defined properly, lpd is running, and that all seems to be fine, but, it
doesn't print. If I run lpr &lt;file&gt;, it executes the command without an
error, but nothing happens. The file just disappears in somewhere in
cyberspace. The queue is empty. Where are my files? There are some temporary
ones appearing in the spool directory, is that my file? If so, how can I
convince it to got that little step further and end up in my printer, rather
than in that directory on my disk???

All these things work just great under Win95, OS/2 and POS (plain old
stupid) Dos.

Sorry, that this is so long. Please answer to the mailing list or e-mail me.

Thanks in Advance

Andy

P.S.: Are there LINUX groups elsewhere in Oz, I am located in Sydney for a
few months, but will move south soon
