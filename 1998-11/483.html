Linux device driver writers:

I'm not sure who out there is currently writing linux device drivers
or who might want to learn.
But I'd like to know who is doing that sort of thing.
This is the kind of thing that perhaps does not justify use of the
general linuxsa e-mail list, because discussions on this
topic could become voluminous and tedious to non device driver people.

If you have a fair level of interest in linux device driver
writing, could you please respond to this e-mail?

If the numbers are large, then it possibly _would_ be okay
to discuss such things on the general e-mail list.
Otherwise, perhaps a sublist could be formed, or just an
informal kind of cummunication among ourselves.

My current interest is in writing a non-device device driver,
which hijacks IP packets and hands them on to a user process
to deal with. This is kind of technical, because it relates to
moderating traffic use and translating protocols (e.g. from TCP to
UDP or native ATM). The most obvious application in the commercial
world would be traffic shaping for ISPs, e.g. to stop heavy
users making life tough for light users.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Can anyone tell me what's the best sort of keyboard?
My PC keyboard is worse than my old Remmington typewriter -- which
I took to the city dump becasue it was too heavy.
I want something which is a total pleasure to use!
