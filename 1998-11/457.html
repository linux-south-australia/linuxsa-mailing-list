HI All,

I have watched with interest the discussions on EDS / Goverment policy /
philosophy on OSS.

Over the last 5 years I have worked for both the Goverment and private
enterprise. I am currently working for EDS in Network support, maintaining
Statenet (thanks for the compliment Stephen!).

One thing which not very many people understand is the EDS business model. EDS
arrange Service Level Agreements (ie. guarantees of availability) with
customers ... the minimum SLA I have seen is 98% uptime, 0800 - 1800 business
days, 97% all other hours. Higher is quite common. For a 98% service, this
means that if the service is not available (eg. a file service) for more than
49 / 50 hours during business , EDS will pay the customer penalty rates. There
is also a limit to the number of outages within a month ie. within a 98% SLA
there cannot be one outtage per week for that 50th hour (ie. 49/ 50)

Consider how many other vendors of services / software / equipment are willing
to guarantee an availability level, and give money back if they don't meet it ?
This is one of the reasons why EDS need to have control the environment being
used by it's customers. Blame for not meeting an SLA will, by default, fall on
EDS. EDS have to use "industry proven" technology to provide those services.

I would suggest that, although Linux is exceptionally stable, it currently
doesn't have the "industry proven" track record it will need to have to make it
into the corporate world. Endorsements by Oracle, Netscape, Intel etc., plus
the test of time will give it the "industry proven" track record it needs.
Initiatives, like Matthew Tippett's Linux Support Initiative will also help
address the percieved lack of "reliable" support avenues.

Disclaimer : The above is all my own thoughts, opinions and comments, could all
be wrong, and I might have dreamt it last night. In no way should the above be
interpreted as official statements of EDS or anyone else *.

Regards,
Mark.
