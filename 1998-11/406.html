&gt; What things about KDE do you like in particular and what do you feel it
&gt; offers over other x-windows managers?  Are there things you don't like
&gt; about KDE?   I'd really just like to hear more about it from someone
&gt; that uses it.
&gt;

I use it by default these days because I have a user base of four (wife,
son 9 daughter 11 and me) and I am the only one religiously opposed to
Microsoft. KDE gives the users a leg into Linux with no productivity
drop to overcome, and gets them started on the Linux/Unix road. My 9 yo
son now has a good rudimentary knowledge of filesystems, file
permissions and the reason for them, and many other computing basics. My
daughter is a bit more advanced than that. My wife is being taught Un*x
by my kids. This was all too hard a transition for them using fvwm2,
just too big a stretch all at once. For myself I am not fussed, I use
Unix at work all day every day and have done so for the last 10 years,
except for some brief adventures with VMS and Primos. I come home and
play with Linux and I am still learning new things, but I appreciate
being a bit brain dead after a day in front of the screens at work so
using KDE is a nice rest. It is not a struggle, which is probably why it
is hated by sime sections, as for a lot of people I suspect wrestling
with Linux is a very enjoyable and satisfying passtime. Me, I don't need
the practise any more.

Now, having said that, I am going to try wrestling with Oracle 8.0.5 for
Linux on the weekend. :)))

Cheers,

Bruce
