I received the following item today.  This is sad for the Unix industry.
John Lions was one of the people who was instrumental in the early success
of Unix.  Owing to the legal restrictions against publishing his book, it
became one of the most pirated texts on Unix.  I'm sure many early Unix
people give it pride of place in their library.

Subject: The death of John Lions -- AUUG founder and life member

It is a sad day for AUUG, as I have to announce the death of John Lions,
AUUG founder and life member. John died on Saturday morning December 5th
after a long illness.

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie published a paper "The Unix Time-Sharing
System" in May 1974 in the Communications of the ACM. After fellow lecturer
Ken Robinson wrote away to get the new operating system, John Lions, a
lecturer at the University of New South Wales, decided to base his
Operating Systems course around reading the source code and wrote a
commentary to accompany it. Legal distribution of the commentary was
restricted to UNIX licence holders, however that didn't prevent it from
being widely photocopied and becoming a legend in the UNIX world.
Finally, in 1996, the Lions source code and commentary were able to be
published and sold freely as one book. The book has been translated into
several languages including Japanese.

Directly or indirectly John's early work with the UNIX operating system,
his contribution in founding AUUG, and his enthusiasm in introducing it
to students through his book and through his operating systems course has
had a great influence on the direction of UNIX in Australia and possibly
the world.
