Subject: RE: Removing Linux


&gt;Was planning to install from the pocketbook CD this wekend, as a dual-boot
&gt;with linux and windows-95, but these reported problems have scared me as I
&gt;have no practical way of backing up my files (other than downloading them
&gt;down the phone line - ugh!) and I don't have the win-95 install disks if I
&gt;need to reinstall (it's a work machine...)
&lt;snip&gt;

If you can't backup your data, and you can't reinstall your OS, my advice
would be don't even think about it. But if I couldn't backup my data and it
was important to me, I wouldn't have that data on a computer no matter what
the operating system was.

My experience with the Linux Pocketbook was with NT, I've no reason to
suppose that the instructions won't work with Win95/Win98. One of my
complaints with LPB is it's bland assumption that everybody who buys the
book it is running Windows. Perhaps the authors didn't try to install Linux
on another operating system, in which case it might have been prudent to
mention this somewhere prominantly in the book.

Another complaint is that the LPB is too brief, if you run into problems
installing Linux it's unlikly that you will find the answer in the LPB. I
think the redhat manual might be on the CD (in HTML format?) but thats not
going to be much help if you can't boot your machine so that you can read
the CD.

For instance when I tried to install Linux on a large disk and it failed,
there is no explanation as to what the disk druid error message (root
partition is too big) might mean. I think it meant that LILO must be
installed below cylinder 1023 and disk druid won't let you procede any
further untill LILO is installed below cylinder 1023. But the only
explanation I could find about that is in the Redhat manual. When I bought
the new disk on Saturday, a 4.3GB disk was the smallest that I could buy, so
I suspect that I won't be the only person to bump in to this problen with
LILO. Another pertenent question might be, how many people who buy the book,
or intend to install Linux, know what disk cylinders are?

The other serious flaw that I found with the book is where they tell you to
install LILO in the MBR. That might be OK for Windows, but if you do that
with NT it will totally disable NT, and the instuctions in the NT Howto, and
the alternative bootpart option, didn't work for me. (maybe because I used
NTFS instead of FAT?). Again you won't find any referece to this in the LPB.

A couple of options might be print/read the Redhat manual while you still
have a bootable machine or buy Redhat 5.2 and get the manual and the 3
months support. Redhat only costs about $70 which is pretty cheap.

The Linux pocketbook and CD is still a very useful reference for the
beginner, and it's currently in my breifcase because I refer to it at work,
at $15 dollars that's a cheap resource, but in my opinion it's also
seriously flawed.

Caveat Emptor, Steve
