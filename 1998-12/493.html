&gt; Hi All.
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently acquired a 3C509TP network card that I intend to use
&gt; under Linux. What I would like to know is: Is there any way under
&gt; Linux (or any other OS) to install the card and its drivers (I know
&gt; how to do that) and check that the card actually works before investing
&gt; any serious time in setting it up in a network with the other computers
&gt; in my house?
&gt; 
&gt; When I say "check that the card works", I mean is there any way to make
&gt; sure that Linux recognises it and that it can talk to my computer. I
&gt; accept that there is probably no way to test its actual networking
&gt; status without actually plugging it into a network and configuring
&gt; everything.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance, Adam

the 3com 509 tp card is works great and is auto detected fine by a RH5.x
install. In my experiance they are a great value for money card. The
software to setup them though runs under dos, but then if you are going
to use only one of them and it only has the TP port on it then you
proabably dont need to set it up. I have setup three in the one machine
and am using it as a gateway/router/firewall and Linux picked them all
up spot on, with out any kernel messages :-)
Just plug it in and boot up, then check the boot messages and it should
find it fine.
