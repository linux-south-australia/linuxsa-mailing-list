&gt; Here's the problem: I want to set up a proxy server in our school. We
&gt; have a 200+ node LAN running NT4.0. (I am a computer teacher not the NT
&gt; administrator.) I have suggested that as part of our effort to improve
&gt; our internet service we set up a Linux/Apache proxy rather than the MS
&gt; version. It will be behind our firewall, an NT solution. Our connection
&gt; is a direct line running at 128, soon to be 256Kbs.
NT Solution? Isn't that an oxymoron?
Btw, you'll probably be using squid to proxy stuff. Apache is a http
server, as far as I know it doesn't double as a cache.

&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone on the list tell me where to find the info I need. Basic
&gt; stuff like: how do I configure two ethernet cards on the proxy machne,
&gt; do I need a connection scrip in this situation, what size to set the
&gt; cache on the proxy machine, should I limit all the other servies on the
&gt; machine, etc.
Multiple ethernet cards can be configured by passing parameters to the
kernel at boot time, take a look at:

and 
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-3.html">http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-3.html</A>#ss3.2

Hopefully if redsplat is configured correctly it should be an easy thing
to modify the network configuration. Redhat 5.0 has a nifty little network
config control panel in X - not sure if 5.1 has it, though.

As for limiting the other services, that's usually a good idea. I'm
really no security guru, but the best general rule here is to only have
the services you really need. I'm not too sure about the cache size
though, I've never had to manage a proxy on a large network.

&gt; 
&gt; I have a 200Mhz clone with 32 Mgs of RAM and RedHat 5.1.
Should be fast enough, but you might want to upgrade the ram if you're
going to be caching.

Hope this helps,
Michael.
