&gt; Subject: Escellent speakers
&gt; Date: Wednesday, 16 December 1998 12:43
&gt; 
&gt; The organisers did an excellent job of
&gt; providing impressive speakers and very
&gt; relevant topics at last night's meeting.

Agreed, mostly...

&gt; Unfortunately I forgot my pen

Ask, man!  Compaq people - if no one else -
would surely have had something to offer...

Your forgetfulness might have been rewarded
with a Compaq advertising pen no less... ;)

And maybe even a Compaq notepad...

&gt; and was not able to record much of the crit-
&gt; ical detail including the names and email
&gt; addresses of the speakers

1. <A HREF="mailto:dPallott@Au.Oracle.com">dPallott@Au.Oracle.com</A> ("Dino")
2. cf bottom of <A HREF="http://samba.anu.edu.au/cifs/docs/what-is-smb.html">http://samba.anu.edu.au/cifs/docs/what-is-smb.html</A> (Richard
Sharpe)

   (that URL points to the start of an
    excellent presentation on SMBs BTW)

&gt; I would also like to get a copy of the Oracle beta database if anyone
&gt; remembers the download address. Is it available on cd rom?

technet.oracle.com for everything NOW...
if you have time and bandwidth to spare!

Dino says he's going to get (say) 50 CD-ROM's
and let Matt hand them out at a future meet'g

&gt; Those projected pages on Samba would be
&gt; extremely valuable too if they were avail-
&gt; able.

Well, helpful at least...  ;)   They left out
a bit, but would be good memory joggers...
 
Generally, however:

I think it should be a pre-requite of
inviting a speaker (whose organisation
or business - after all - gets valuable
PR for the investment of time, etc) that
a disk of the slides be available for re-
lease to the interested (as well as hand-
outs, for notetaking, at least from larger
- Oracle-sized - vendors...)
