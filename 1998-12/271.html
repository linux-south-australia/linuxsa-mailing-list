After last night's meeting, I floated the idea of "ConfigFests" {for want of
a better term} which was favourably received by those I spoke to.

What I was suggesting was a method of expanding the current concept of
"InstallFests" to bi-monthly or tri-monthly meetings in which, depending on
the venue, may have one or more themes.

For example, what about Networking ConfigFest in which people bring 2
machines (with appropriate hardware) and then work though the process of
networking them.

Another possibility is a Afterstep ConfigFest in which people bring their
machine in an then work through the various modifications that can be made.

What about a SAMBA ConfigFest etc etc.

Whilst this may be second nature to some of us, this approach may provide a
method in which new users can expand their knowledge in a supportive
environment.

My gut feeling is that these could be extremely successive meetings, perhaps
with a gold coin donation to LinuxSA.

Anyway, what do others think?

Cheers,

TonyR
