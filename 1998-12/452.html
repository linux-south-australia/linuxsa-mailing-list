Mark,

Thanks for those reponses.

&gt;  &gt; At the moment, I have two hypotheses:
&gt;  &gt; 1.	There's a bug in the ppp.o driver which makes it
&gt;  &gt; 	not wake up properly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Highly unlikely.  PPP has been bashed on by too many people over
&gt; too many years.

I tend to agree. But this might be "the last bug".

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; 2.	There's a bug in the ethernet card which makes it
&gt;  &gt; 	not wake up the CPU properly.
&gt;
&gt; Unless you have a really wierd ethernet card this is also unlikely 
&gt; for similar reasons.

This was a slip of the fingers -- I said ethernet when I meant modem.

&gt;
&gt; Throw away your internal modem (at the very least, borrow and external
&gt; one and suck it 'n' see).

I certainly prefer the external modem -- precisely because I can
diagnose so many problems by just watching the lights.
I've done that for many years, and find it enormously useful.
The problem is that they take up space and extra money, and extra
cables etc. etc. etc.
I thought I'd try an internal modem just to experience how
other people work their computers.
This might be the experience that makes me convert back to external.

However, there's an issue of bandwidth on the cable.
If I run the external wires at 115 kbit/sec or whatever,
I'm worried about line noise. Even 38.4 kbits/sec can
be vulnerable to much noise. An external modem takes up
my last spare serial port too!

&gt; I'd think the "top half" would be woken up by the bottom half saying, 
&gt; "here!  I've received a character".
&gt;
&gt; The bottom half of a device driver is just supposed to collect 
&gt; data presented by the hardware and do the minimal amount necessary
&gt; to clean up after an interrupt and prepare for the next I/O transaction.
&gt; The top half (in the kernel) does the rest;  it's kicked into action
&gt; by the bottom half saying, "Oi!  I just did something, now it's 
&gt; your turn!"

In fact, I think you just might be wrong here.
I've been having a go at network drivers myself in the last few
weeks, and I've found something which is somewhat disturbing for
people who like "real-time" software.

The way in which the bottom half of a driver informs the IP stack
of the packet arrival is that a packet buffer is allocated by
the driver. This buffer (actually an element in a doubly linked 
global list) then receives the bytes of the RX packet. Then a function
is called to just mark the packet as ready to receive.
Then at the next 10 mS system interrupt, the function net_bh() is
called to recieve all marked packet buffers.

I.e. a process waiting for packets will only be able to receive a
packet every 10 mS. That's why the packet arrivals in
my example TCP dump were spaced by multiples of 10 mS.

I.e. the driver receives any number of packets and queues them for
the IP stack in any 10 mS interval, and at the ned of that
interval, the system clock wakes up the kernel, which then
invokes net_bh() to collect the packets and hand them on to the
IP layer.
Notice that this is quite different to the case of a char driver.
net drivers operate differently. A char driver puts a process
on the ready queue when data is ready, which may result in
immediate wake-up of the process. But a net driver just
puts RX packets into a queue to be collected. The process
getting the packets from the RX queue will only get them when
it is put onto the ready-list for process scheduling.

this is all very troubling because in ATM switching by a PC running
linux, you would want to be able to shift over 100 Mbits/sec.
When dealing with 53-byte cells, with means an awful lot of
items in your buffer to be collected at each system interrupt.
Obviously ATM must be done differently.
But even ethernet can result in heaps of packets arriving in every
10 mS, like about 100 small packets every 10 mS.

&gt;  &gt; I'm pretty sure that the kernel collects packets from the driver
&gt;  &gt; every 10 mS.
&gt;
&gt; That would suck royally if you tried to run PPP over an ISDN TA
&gt; with a 115kbps DTE (where packets can arrive every couple of mSec
&gt; without necessarily congesting the line).
&gt;
&gt; The kernel *should* collect packets "when they're ready" rather 
&gt; than waiting for arbitrary timeouts.  If that isn't what's happening
&gt; then maybe we've found a project for someone who wants to learn a
&gt; bit more about kernel hacking :-)

Clearly this is an important topic.
I think that the linux-atm people must have already resolved all of this
for ATM. I haven't read the software and documentation for linux-ATM
yet, but it's all at <A HREF="http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/">http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/linux-atm/</A> .

&gt;  &gt; So the most believable theory for me right now
&gt;  &gt; is that the physical IRQ from card to driver is at fault.
&gt;
&gt; Then it wouldn't work at all.  What kind of failure mode are you 
&gt; expecting?

One possibility is that the packet-received interrupt might not
be activated in the modem card, but it might have a "watchdog"
timer that wakes it up every 9 seconds.

If only I could watch the TX and RX lights on the modem, I could
narrow down the hypotheses very musch more quickly!!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
