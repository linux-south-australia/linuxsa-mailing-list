&gt; Could somebody please help me with a little problem I'm having. I'm a
&gt; seasoned windows user but only new to linux, so some simple help
&gt; wouldn't go astray.
&gt;
&gt; After only 4 days

4 days? that could have something to do with it too.

&gt; of installing Redhat 5.2 (from the Linux pocketbook) I
&gt; have managed to crash it. I just used the find command to look for some
&gt; file from the root. At this time a cdrom file system was mounted (I
&gt; don't know if that had anything to do with it). Anyway, I noticed that
&gt; the hard drive had finished searching, but the cdrom was still spinning.
&gt; As I knew that I didn't want to search for the file on the cd, I decided
&gt; to stop it, using my old faithful methods which did not work - esc and
&gt; ctrl-c.

Ok, it doesn't hurt to search the cd and shouldn't take too long either. To
stop something, ctrl-c is good (usually does the trick) esc is useless
(probably gets trapped by the shell anyway) and ctrl-\ if all else fails
(will probably cause a core dump, but at least the process stopped).

&gt; Well then I went to kill the process. At this point everything
&gt; froze. The three fingered salute didn't work (Ctrl-alt-del).

left ctrl-alt

&gt; I went for
&gt; the reset button.
&gt;

always a good idea to wait 30 seconds for a sync (things aren't usually
completely frozen)

&gt;
&gt; At reboot the computer would not even get past the first intro screen
&gt; (the one where you can enter the bios).

which means there is probably a dodgy bit of hardware which is why
everything froze

&gt; Well, ctrl-alt-del worked then,
&gt; but to no avail. So I turned it off, then on again. Goody, it worked.
&gt; Told lilo to go to linux again. Now, here I began to read lines to the
&gt; effect that my file system was being mounted in read-only mode.
&gt; Something called fsck.ext2 was running. Then I had the choice of
&gt; submitting the root password or ctrl-d to reboot. Rebooting got me to
&gt; the same place. Out came the trusty Linux pocketbook and I decided to
&gt; run something called e2fsck (equivalent of scandisk with prompts, I
&gt; imagine?). Answered yes to all its (many) questions.
&gt;

scandisk is a pale imitation of fsck et al. while we're on fsck **** NEVER
**** interrupt it with a reboot you may do irrepairable damage.
Unfortunately answering yes is about all you can do most of the time.

On reboot everything seemed to go smoothly. Now, logged in as root, x

&gt; windows would not start. I imagine that I lost some (important) files. I
&gt; have a boot disk, and can easily make a rescue disk from the image on
&gt; the cd. Is there a way to restore these files or settings or whatever
&gt; without re-installing?

probably reinstalling the x application package is the best thing to do as
you probably have lost an important file. Even a full install should only
take an hour max. Which brings me back to the first question.... why 4
days? part of the answer may lie there.

Rick

&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
