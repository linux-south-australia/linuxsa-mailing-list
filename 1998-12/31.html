Hi all,

When I asked a little while back about ppls experiences with scanners, I
was asked to publish the results of my investigations.

Well, I waded into SANE, gtk, the GIMP and lotsa stuff, and came up with
the personal opinion that the UMAX scsi scanners were a good way to
start. I bought a 610s, but I can't tell you how it goes til after xmas
cos it's my wife's present. Apparently the 1220 series is alo very good.

The prices for the 610S varied from 399 to 279 (guess which price I
paid) in Adelaide. The prices for the 1220S are equally way variable. I
am not into publishing spam ads for retailers, if you want to know where
i bought it ask me off line.

I will let you all know how we go knitting it all together with Linux
into the new year. Thanks again to the ppl who replied to my request.

Cheers,

Bruce
