Sort of. But the real point is that one method exists already and works
well for _most_ people, and the other is something that needs to be added
for the minority who don't have filtering working yet.

It also makes the subject longer and all the e-mails in the LinuxSA folder
will have a subject that tells me that they're from LinuxSA. But I already
know that cause they have either to: or cc: as <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>

Still, I'm sure if a subject header is added, I will live. Mind you, it's
going to be pretty hard, but with the help of my family and friends, I'll
be able to see this through.

Cheers

Alex!

Geoffrey (who's been a little quiet lately (no-one's having a go at RH man
pages I guess)), what do you think?
