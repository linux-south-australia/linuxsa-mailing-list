&gt;Ah, fixed the sendmail man page problem - it was installing the wrong set
&gt;of manual pages. But the other difficulty still stands: does anybody know
&gt;how I can get rid of the &lt;AD&gt; in reverse caps when man/groff tries to
&gt;seperate a word? This happens only on a clean install of man/groff, not on
&gt;the basic redhat install.

Michael,

Well I'm not a guru on man/groff, but not seeing any response to 
your question for several days, I thought I'd provide some comments
because I noticed the same problem but in a different context (see
below).

The code &lt;AD&gt; that you are seeing, is the pager's way of telling
you that the 8th bit has been set.  I have confirmed this by reference
to an ASCII table and also by capturing the output from man using 
script(), the hyphen used to break words is a meta-hyphen.  Now,
when one reads a man page on a terminal, it is automatically put
through a pager, probably less() on your system.  The default
behaviour of less() is to expose meta codes, it is possible to 
give -r to less() which makes it do raw output, or use more() which
is 8 bit clean.  You indicated that in some circumstances the hyphens
look good, in others they do not.  My hint would be to isolate the
issue to either the action of the pager or to the output of man().
BTW, my system is Debian 2.0, the output captured by script as described
above contains meta hyphens yet man pages look OK until I break my
console as described below.

I discovered this when using setfont() to load a character map for the
language APL (which uses weird characters).  When the map is loaded,
the man page hyphens are broken, but to my annoyment, trying to reload
the default character map didn't fix it because the default map
provided by the package kbd (which provides setfont() ) is slightly
different to my initial font.

&gt;PS. Compiling a customised linux system from scratch is harder than I
&gt;thought it would be. If anybody needs any pointers on how this is done,
&gt;feel free to mail me. :)
It would be an ineresting topic to cover in a show and tell session at
one of our meetings.
