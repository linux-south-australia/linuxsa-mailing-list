 Mark reminded me that anyone who's new to LINUX
 (particularly if not coming from a UNIX context)
 has a Real Opportunity to Improve LINUX for the
 NEXT generation of newbies (as well as earn a
 good name for themselves in this hot niche area):

 As you find a "glitch" in some bit of LINUX's
 documentation, report it to the responsible party
 (*someone's* e-mail address is usually there in
 the file, except perhaps man pages...)

 Of course it's better still if you manage to
 solve or resolve the issue in question your-
 self... and then - to help somebody else
 avoid re-inventing the &lt;solution&gt; - write
 up a short note on the problem & your work-
 around.

 A copy to the author of the document that
 seemed to lead you astray (e.g. because it
 was describing an earlier version of the
 software bits under the hood...) couldn't
 hurt, maybe after getting some feedback
 from local guru's...  ;)

 Somebody here has already saved me HOURS
 OF MY LIFE by doing just that... and, as
 one with better things to do, I appreci-
 ate the "tip" that lead to this time sav-
 ing...  ;)
