&gt;Linux is far more consistant O/S. If something doesn't work, there is

But I think one of the most important advantages, is that when things are
broken, you can enable a logging/debugging option or glance at a message
file or even peer at the source code and you can work out what is wrong and
fix it.

No more than 15 minutes ago, I tried to install an .rpm and rpm just hung
there and looked at me. Windows often does the same thing when installing
software and a reboot is often the only solution, and you can forget about
the install ever working again.

With my rpm problem I just hit ctrl-c, and ran it again with the '-vv'
option and voila! The debugging output told me that there was a stale
/etc/passwd lock file and rpm needed to edit /etc/passwd. rpm was simply
waiting for the lock file to go away. I really apreciate an operating
system that tells you what is going on.

A trivial example, but it proves my point.

Cheers

Alex!
