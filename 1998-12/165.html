  SR&gt; Here's a tale of a lost three day weekend trying to dual boot
  SR&gt; Linux and NT.

&lt;sad saga deleted&gt;

  SR&gt; 7 - Finally, I understand why Elvis shot his Cadillac when it
  SR&gt; wouldn't start! . I have this overwhelming urge to shoot fdisk,
  SR&gt; LPB and Linux. I didn't like his music but I'm now a soul
  SR&gt; brother

I don't think it should be that hard...  Here are my pointers (taken
from a Debian background, but RedHat should be similar).

(1) If you have a decent BIOS, then it should offer a low-level format
    utility.  Often it includes choices like "Normal", "Large" and "LBA".
    If you start with a low-level LBA format of a 4.3 GB drive, you should
    end up with about (!) 128 heads, 63 sectors, 1047 cylinders, so where
    LILO goes on the disk should not be an issue.  Many of the READMEs are
    out of date and talk about 60 MB disks with 6 heads and 1000
    cylinders; this should not be a problem anymore.

(2) Secondly, _partition_ (do not format the first partition yet) the
    drive with _linux_ fdisk.  An example partition setup might be:

    1/. hda1 is a 2 Gig (fat32?) NT partition (about 500 cylinders)
    2/. hda2 is an extended partition that contains several logical 
        partitions:
          - hda5 : /         50 Mb
          - hda6 : /var      50 Mb
          - hda7 : swap      96 Mb
          - hda8 : /tmp      64 Mb
    3/. hda3 contains a 1 Gig /usr partition
    4/. hda4 contains a 1 Gig /home partition

    Make your system boot off of /dev/hda1 at first, if you wish.  (fdisk
    allows you to mark a partition as bootable.)  Later, if you use LILO
    (and I recommend that you do), you would run linux fdisk again and
    make /dev/hda2 the boot partition, as lilo would load stuff from
    /dev/hda5 (your root ("/") partition under unix).

    I have a vague memory that LILO ignores the "active" flags, but I
    could be wrong.

(3) Thirdly, install NT on your first partition.  DOS/NT fdisk should
    recognise only the 2 Gig partition, and should allow you to format it
    in a couple of different ways.  (Sorry, you'd know more about this
    part than I would.)  All that I'd suggest is that you do not use NTFS,
    or if you do, check out <A HREF="http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~loewis/ntfs/">http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~loewis/ntfs/</A>
    Does NT allow you to use FAT32?

(4) Finally, use a "rescue" floppy, or continue the install-from-CD to
    re-mount the previously initialised linux partitions, load your
    linux distribution and then install lilo.

    In this example, a /etc/lilo.conf file might look like this:

       boot           = /dev/hda2
       root           = /dev/hda5
       install        = /boot/boot.b
       map            = /boot/map
       vga            = normal
       default        = /vmlinuz
       delay          = 100
       compact

       image=/vmlinuz
               label  = Linux
               vga    = extended
               read-only

       other          = /dev/hda1
               label  = NT
               table  = /dev/hda

    Obviously check that the files exist; don't just copy this example
    verbatim!  Here I've specified the Linux-root-partition as the boot
    device because the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the harddisk is owned
    by Windows NT.

I hope these suggestions make it easier for someone someday.
