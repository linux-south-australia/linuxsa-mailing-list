And also.....

Not only is it silly to add GNU to the front,
it also seems to mistake the notion of OS. 
To my way of thinking, the OS was always waht nowadays is
called the kernel. The OS does not include applications,
even if some of those applications are various daemons.
Even the device drivers, even for the disk drives, are not
really part of the OS, although in some OSs, disk driver support
is inside the kernel, I believe.

In one GNU weg site page, there's an account by Stallman about
why linux should be called GNU/linux, because
linux distributions tend to have only a small number of lines
(relatively) of linux code relative to the applications that
are used with it (lpr etc.).
But it seems to me that this is an attempt by Stallman to
counteract the loss of limelight due to the success of linux.

The OS + auxiallary programs + device drivers could be
called, say, "linux+GNU". But I would prefer to say
"linux kernel, with GNU and other applications".

I know many people who saturate their sparc stations with
GNU software for all purposes, with the solaris OS.
But they don't call it GNU/solaris.
I think the GNU/linux thing is just an outgrowth of
Stallman's desire to take over the world.

By the way, it seems to me that he is _not_ in favour
of free software. More freedom for some always means
less freedom for others.
For instance, I ahve some 27,000 lines of C++ that
I think are not bad. I've been thinking of using the GPL for it.
But then I lose freedom over my own software, and I acquire
numerous obligations. And the users of my software lose
any right to make money out of their use of this software
in their work so that they can feed their kids.
I mean that they woudl not be able to create new works using my
software as a basis, and then make money out of it.

Therefore I am coming to the conclusion that
the Artistic Licen[sc]e is more balanced between the rights
of creators and re-users of software.
Public domain gives perhaps too much freedom to the re-users and
too little to the creator.

Conclusion:
A tight association between GNU and linux is
not necessarily for the good.
I predict there will be a time when OS developers
cry out to be released from the tyranny of the GNU licen[cs]e!
And then the term "GNU/linux" will seem to have the same
osrt of emotional significance that MS/linux might have right now.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
