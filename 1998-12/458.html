Mark,

I'll conclude this thread now. (At least I'll try.)
My thanks to everybody for not complaining about it.

&gt;  &gt; I.e. a process waiting for packets will only be able to receive a
&gt;  &gt; packet every 10 mS. That's why the packet arrivals in
&gt;  &gt; my example TCP dump were spaced by multiples of 10 mS.
&gt;
&gt; Yuk.  I knew the Linux TCP/IP code was pretty awful but I didn't
&gt; think it was that awful.  I wonder if it's actually possible to 
&gt; think of a worse way to implement it?
&gt;
&gt; Ironic question, of course.  We all know that version 1 was a worse
&gt; way to implement it. :-)

When I thought about this awful way of doing Internet packet RX
inthe kernel for a bit longer, I realised that it was not that bad.
If you have two processes time-sharing, they will generally only get their
quantum each (10 mS) in some sort of weighted round robin fashion.
So generally you don't expect a normal user process to be real-time.
They get to wake up every 10 mS if they're lucky. If there's a
superblock sync going on, a process could be blocked out for
a much longer time.

So if net driver RX packets are collected by the kernel every 10 mS,
that can't be so bad -- because 10 mS is the interval between
context swaps anyway.

The net device cannot wake up the waiting process, because it doesn't
know which one it is. The IP stack has to work it out. The IP stack
is called in linux each 10 mS to collect _all_ of the RX pakcets
of _all_ of the net devices, and what better time to collect them
than during a context swap!

If a process is woken up for each RX packet, then should it 
immediately be woken up? Even for a char device driver, a wakeup
on RX of an event only puts the receiving process onto the 
_read-to-run_ list for consideration at the next context swap.

So the way linux does net RX events is pretty much the best of all
worlds, unless you want real-time user processes like solaris!!!!

[No need to respond to all of this.....]

&gt;  &gt; One possibility is that the packet-received interrupt might not
&gt;  &gt; be activated in the modem card, but it might have a "watchdog"
&gt;  &gt; timer that wakes it up every 9 seconds.
&gt;
&gt; Your modem card doesn't have a "packet received" interrupt:  Your 
&gt; modem is a UART, nothing more.  It interrupts when it finishes 
&gt; receiving (or sending) *characters*.  It knows nothing about "packets",
&gt; that's the PPP network device driver's job.

this is an excellent point, which I had not brought into play in
my thinking. But this does not change my principal hypothesis -- 
that
the modem is holding onto heaps of bytes and then only passing them on to
the kernel after a certain amount of time.
The amount heald must be about 64 * 9 * 8 bits, plus PPP overheads.
that's about 600 bytes or 5000 bits.

Next time the problem arises (now that I've got rid of it by re-booting
pppd), I'll do a ping with double the size packets.
If that halves the time for the modem (or whatever) to release the bytes,
then I know that it is a modem thing -- because of what you said,
that the modem is a purely byte-oriented device and has no knowledge of
packets.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
