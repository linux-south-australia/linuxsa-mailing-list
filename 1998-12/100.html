Regarding this post...

&gt; Hi,
&gt; What are the better video cards which work well under Linux ( as an
&gt; accelerated server of course) and windows 95 both. 
&gt; 
&gt; Prasad


I don't know if this is relevant to anyone, but I recently upgraded my
system from a Pentium 200 to a K6-2/350... but the important bit is the
video card.  It's a S3 ViRGE DX w/ 4 megs of ram, and after a certain
time of use, and under certain (unknown) conditions, the fonts become
garbled and horrible.  And they just get worse.  (btw - this is whilst
in hi-res screen modes (1024x768+) (not that I've tested that..)

This isn't an X-specific problem - windoze does the same thing.

But windoze has a fix.  I turn down the "graphics acceleration" thing
in the "System Properties" dialog, and all is well.

The strangest thing about the problem is that only fonts seem to become
garbled.  All other graphics remain ok.

Has anyone had any dealings with this sort of problem before?  If you
have, I'd be most interested to know exactly what's causing it :)

Many thanks for taking the time to peruse my ramblings.
