Sorry about getting back so late, but some other weird things happened along the
way...

&gt; &gt; Tomasz, what other hardware are you using besides the Tseng et4000/w32 p
&gt; &gt; rev d video card?

&gt; &gt; Are you using a non-Intel CPU (IBM/Cyrix or AMD)?

I originally thought that I had an IBM chip in my computer - this is what was
written on the specs we were given from the place we bought it from. Recently I
downloaded a little program from Intel which reads some strings which are stored
within the CPU (think it was called CPUID) and it returned the 'GenuineIntel'
string. I have not taken off the heatsink to see what's written on the actual
chip, though. As far as I can tell it's an intel pentium P54C running at 100MHz.

&gt; &gt; What motherboard?

Abit PE5

&gt;  What CDROM drive?

Acer 24x, model no: 624A 403

&gt;  What RAM, how much?

Not sure if it's EDO, but 70ns. 24 megsAlso: hard drive - Maxtor 7850AV (very
reliable so far)

While I'm in the hardware area - I also have a scsi scanner which came with it's
own scsi host adapter card. It's a
DTC3181x/DTC3151x - well that's the name that window's device manager gave me.
THere was one DTC driver in Linux for the scsi adapters and I tried to use that,
but it was rejected. Where can I find a driver for this thing? I checked DTC's
site and they only have win3.x/win95/winNT drivers.
The scanner that it's attached to is Acerscan 310s.

&gt; &gt; Rick Marshall &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rjm@herzfeld.com.au">rjm@herzfeld.com.au</A>&gt; has already pointed out that Ctrl-C or
&gt; &gt; Ctrl-\ should regain control and Ctrl-Alt-Del should do a shutdown -r now.
&gt; &gt; My guess is that you have a hardware problem.
&gt;
&gt; That's totally possible, but I've had the exact same problem - I tried to
&gt; install staroffice with its setup program under kde, and the system froze.
&gt; telnetting to my box from another machine allowed me to see what was
&gt; happening, but shutdown -r now didn't bloody work.  So I went for the
&gt; reset switch.  After fsck did its quick check it thought there might be a
&gt; bigger problem and I did a manual run of it, answering yes (rather
&gt; blindly) to its insistent questions.
&gt;
&gt; then this happened:  nothing worked.
&gt;
&gt; I did "rpm -V `rpm -qa`" to check every package on the system, and there
&gt; were 1,000,000 files (or so) with checksum errors.  I suggest you do the
&gt; same, Thomasz.

Will do.I remember a message during e2fsck which said something to the effect
that suchnsuch a file was around 4 Terabytes in size. I assure you, my hard
drive isn't anywhere close to that size.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So I wussed out and did a reinstall - luckily I've partitioned my disks in
&gt; a way that meant no important data was lost.
&gt;
&gt; Just in case anyone was interested :)

  This is what I tried:
with the startx thing (Joao's suggestion), i piped the output to a file and
wanted to transfer it over such that windows could read it and i could post this
information up.
Oops, before that I tried to re-install the xwindows package from the cdrom - I
could not mount the cdrom.
THis is what I typed: mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
This was my answer: mount: fs type iso9660 not supported by kernel.

Groovy. I tried to transfer over the file to the windows partition. Trying to
mount that had the same effect as the cdrom (with vfat in place of iso9660). So
I tried to shove the file onto a dos formatted disk. The mmount command was not
even found.
By the way, what is the correct syntax for mmount? The help tells me something
like: mmount -V drive:
Is the -V meant to stay there or be substituted with something (like
'/dev/floppy'), and for 'drive:', you'd do something like 'a:'?

Wonderful, at this point it seemed as if nothing was working - if I can't even
see devices, what's the point?
It was time for a full re-install after which everything seems to work fine.

Can anyone tell me if this will happen again and whether I can prevent it, is it
hardware, or offer any help at all to stop this from re-occurring.

tahnks again,

Tom
