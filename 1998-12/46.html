&gt; &gt;This reminds me of lots of people saying that every plane that's airborne
&gt; &gt;is going to fall from the sky on January 1. I mean why? Does the plane
&gt; &gt;think "Uh oh... jumbo jets haven't been invented yet, i'd better get my ass
&gt; &gt;back on the ground ASAP!" or what? And how about the pilots? Surely they
&gt; &gt;can just turn OFF the autopilot and control the things manually? :)
&gt;
&gt; Planes don't think. Not yet anyway. I think you kinda missed my point. I
&gt; gave the examples of hard coded firmware to make absolutely sure people
&gt; would distinguish my rant from the media hype.

There is a few other aspects that would need to be thought about, going back to
the Jumbo Jet example. These days almost all passenger jet aircraft use GPS for
their location and navigation. GPS relies on time. What you will probably find
is that even though the plane will not "fall out of the sky" so to speak. What
*will* happen is the plane will think it is somewhere completely different to
where it actually is, so when it thinks it is time to land, it could be
*anywhere*. That could be quite messy for the people who have to clean the mess
up....

I think I heard a rumour that all major airlines were going to voluntarily
ground all their flights for a couple of days come new year. Is this true? If
not, remind me not to fly that day :)

Also, there are other devices, which could have serious consequences. One of
which is medical equipment used in hospital. No one really knows what effect the
date changeover will have on machines like life support systems and the like.

I agree wholeheartedly that the media has made a large fuss about the whole
affair, but they are concentrating on the PC area, not where the real problems
will be.

Just my 1½ ¥
