&gt; David Strom's latest essay gives an interesting perspective on Linux and
&gt; OSS. You can read it here:

Good paper... and I'd just like to ask:

If those who care to Advocate LINUX are serious
(and not "closet" would-be high-priced consultants)

...why isn't it reasonable to expect more of the
LINUX application (even server) software to in-
stall (almost) fully configured & "ready-to-go"?

I'm reminded of the ChMod's, etc. that some-
times need to be done to (in the Strom paper).

Rather than use, say, the Windows default
workgroup name(i.e. WORKGROUP), each &
every user of this very useful "bridging" pac-
kage (i.e. one that might help "sell" LINUX
into MS shops) has to find & change this
name to something else.

No big deal?  True for most, but realise that
we're trying to move *down* the expertise-
pyramid IMHO, in order to get more people
"in the door" we've got to make the inside-
environment even more friendly than the
competition.

Volvo may be a safer car than some others
but there are people who choose smaller,
lighter ones... sometimes for reasons of
convenience (not just cost), e.g. the doors
may feel lighter and easier to open/close.

Simplify, simplify... there's enough to do
(e.g. just feeding 5 billion people is getting
to be a big job... and fixing the Year 2000
bug) in the "real world" not to have to do a
lot of "trivia" like fiddling with file access
permissions, after installing software.  ;)

BTW in my search for material on John Lions
(yesterday), I found a ref. to a dated publi-
cation:

  "The UNIX Haters Handbook"

Has anyone seen/written one for the competition
(yet...)?
