Yes, I agree that it was a good night. I've been fiddling with samba for
quite a long time now, but the domain controller stuff was interesting - and
the Oracle presentation was good, and the speaker was very good on the
subject.
Check www.oracle.com, and technet.oracle.com and you will get to the
relevant sections eventually.
Alternatively, just ftp to ftp.oracle.com, and you'll get there eventually
;)
(And you can skip all the 'i agree i am not a iraqi, libyan, etc.' stuff
too.)
The name of the Oracle speaker was Dino Palotta, <A HREF="mailto:dpallott@au.oracle.com">dpallott@au.oracle.com</A>
I did not get the info for the Samba speaker, but I am sure you should be
able to find him from the samba.anu.edu.au pages by the sounds of it ;)

One thing that was suggested was that normally other Oracle speakers would
hand out CDs, and he suggested that if we organised a list of who was
interested, he might be able to arrange some for the linuxsa group as well.
Any news on this yet?

Toby

Subject: Escellent speakers


&gt;
&gt;The organisers did an escellent job of providing impressive speakers asnd
very
&gt;relevant topics at last night's meeting.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately I forgort my pen and was not able to record much of the
critical
&gt;detail inluding the names and email addresses of the speakers if they were
&gt;given.
&gt;
&gt;I would also like to get a copy of the Oracle beta database if anyone
&gt;remembers the download address. Is it available on cd rom?
&gt;
&gt;Those projectged pages on Samba would be extremely valuable too if they
were
&gt;available.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That was a really good night.
&gt;
