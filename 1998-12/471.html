1)
Drop DTE speed from 115200 to 57600, or even 38400, most 14k4 modems do
not like DTE speeds of 115200.
They connect OK & you think its working, but either the modem or
computer can't keep up at 115200, causing data errors on useful things
like ftp, email :)
2)
Set the PSTN attenuation level to -13dBm. (usually s91-13, the default
of -10dBm is usually not suitable).
This is the audio level sent down the analog phone line.
3)
Ask your ISP how their dial-in servers are setup:
a)
Will they allow hardware modem compression.
If so, set your modem to use only the type they use otherwise fall-back
to a non-compressed link. It may be worth turning it off completely.
b)
Will they allow error correction.
If so, set your modem to use only the type they use otherwise fall-back
to a non-error correcting link.
c)
Ask them what their MRU packet size is.
Generally ISPs use the default for Win95 since that is what most of
their clients are using. Adjust accordingly. Mine is 1500.
d)
Will they allow VJ compression.
Use only if hardware compression is not available. Do not use both! The
double compression often causing file transfers to stall.

If they can't answer these questions, they shouldn't be running an ISP
;)

&gt; Q. Need some help ideas for getting the modem speed up.
&gt; 
&gt; Details.
&gt; Modem: Quickcomm 14.4 Spirit II (external)
&gt; Running RedHat 5.2
&gt; PPP connection to my ISP using PAP
&gt; I have read most of the the relevant HOWTOs and FAQ.
&gt; before trying any major tinkering the modem does seem to run much faster
&gt; than 0 - 888 bps (according to the display on wmppp)
&gt; I tried runnning irqtune (to give the serial port a higher priority), and
&gt; only managed a marginal increase to 1142 bps.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless I am expecting to much, these speeds (using ftp, browsers, email etc)
&gt; seem incredibly slow. I had a similar problem using the modem under window$
&gt; but at least it ran at 9600 (which was barely tolerable)
&gt; 
&gt; Have I overlooked something very simple? Or is it just a crap modem with its
&gt; own hardware problems, and should I look at getting a new/replacement modem?
