&gt; &gt; I can't believe that by the time I've read your message the whole
&gt; &gt; lot of this free hardware hasn't already been spoken for.
&gt; &gt; There are several linux people who have houses full of museum-piece
&gt; &gt; computers. I only have stuff dating back 10 years.

I am reminded of the (local) vintage radio collectors' society (of
which I am not a member), which may be an example for the LINUX SA
who have old stuff sitting around...

Someday, I can imaging a SIG arising here, of people keeping some
of that old gear "alive" in the next millenium...

Perhaps a Computer Museum will come to replace Telstra's (now de-
funct) Telecommunications Museum as SA embraces IT...

&gt; &gt; If there's anything left over, please let me know.
&gt; &gt; One really good and fair idea would be to arrange for someone
&gt; &gt; to take any of this old hardware to our regular monthly
&gt; &gt; meeting on 15 December 1998, and then have a raffle or something.
&gt; &gt; The kind of gear you're talking about would be extremely popular.

The local amateur radio organisations hold Auctions at meetings
(on behalf of members wanting to sell their own items) they pre-
sumably collect a small % for the organisation for their efforts

An auctioneer with both a sense of humor and perhaps attitude
would be good to find...  ;)
 
&gt; I've actually only had one person interested, though they'll be dropping 
&gt; by later today. I like the idea of donating stuff to the group and doing 
&gt; group stuff with it if possible, since that's the way ProgSoc was built 
&gt; (courtesy of the lovely people at Sun Microsystems Australia.. though we 
&gt; put SPARClinux on their stuff :). I like the idea behind ProgSoc, to 
&gt; promote hacking, basically.. though that's kinda gotten obscured over the

&gt; last few years with people using our servers for webpages and not much
else.
&gt; 
&gt; You guys seem to be of similar mind, from what I've been reading on your 
&gt; website, so I'll have to drag myself along to a meeting now. :) We're 
&gt; bound to get rid of old stuff again, so I'll keep it in mind for when we 
&gt; do.. and for anything that's left over after people have picked over it 
&gt; today.

No problem... i.e. as long as it's a legitimate donation of gear

(I was once shown a huge pile of gear - in the office of a gov't dep't
- but I wouldn't touch any of if... because I couldn't get any "released
as scrap" paperwork for/with it...

and a "record" as one receiving stolen goods I do not need ;)  )

I trust this offer is different...
