Could somebody please help me with a little problem I'm having. I'm a
seasoned windows user but only new to linux, so some simple help
wouldn't go astray.

After only 4 days of installing Redhat 5.2 (from the Linux pocketbook) I
have managed to crash it. I just used the find command to look for some
file from the root. At this time a cdrom file system was mounted (I
don't know if that had anything to do with it). Anyway, I noticed that
the hard drive had finished searching, but the cdrom was still spinning.
As I knew that I didn't want to search for the file on the cd, I decided
to stop it, using my old faithful methods which did not work - esc and
ctrl-c. Well then I went to kill the process. At this point everything
froze. The three fingered salute didn't work (Ctrl-alt-del). I went for
the reset button.

At reboot the computer would not even get past the first intro screen
(the one where you can enter the bios). Well, ctrl-alt-del worked then,
but to no avail. So I turned it off, then on again. Goody, it worked.
Told lilo to go to linux again. Now, here I began to read lines to the
effect that my file system was being mounted in read-only mode.
Something called fsck.ext2 was running. Then I had the choice of
submitting the root password or ctrl-d to reboot. Rebooting got me to
the same place. Out came the trusty Linux pocketbook and I decided to
run something called e2fsck (equivalent of scandisk with prompts, I
imagine?). Answered yes to all its (many) questions.

On reboot everything seemed to go smoothly. Now, logged in as root, x
windows would not start. I imagine that I lost some (important) files. I
have a boot disk, and can easily make a rescue disk from the image on
the cd. Is there a way to restore these files or settings or whatever
without re-installing?

Thanks in advance,

Tom
