&gt; &gt; On the subject of computers and Linux use, I just wouldn't be myself if I
&gt; &gt; didn't mention that cheap Commodore C64's and C128's go well with Linux
&gt; (and
&gt; &gt; other *nix flavours).

For that purpose, C64 machine's have a few advantages: they are easy to
assemble (1 piece only) and can connect straight through to a TV,
bypassing the need for a monitor.

&gt; But to equate your clients with C-xx[x], saying that it is the perfect
&gt; match for them,
&gt; I think I would feel really *insulted* were I to be likened to computers
&gt; which:
&gt; 
&gt;   - are slow, unreliable, costly to repair,
&gt;   - have spares only available from used throw-aways,
&gt;   - can possibly affect users' vision, if TV used as display,
&gt;   - preclude access to video high-fidelity audio (e.g. RealAudio) from the
&gt; Internet,
&gt;   - don't seem to have much new software being developed for them these
&gt; days,
&gt;   - absorb users' excess cash without any chance of helping them
&gt; participate in the
&gt;     CREATIVE sides of the Internet (how many C-xx[x]-ers have web pages,
&gt; write
&gt;     programs, host webs, etc.)
&gt;   - (as a result) do not help users to develop a taste for "value for
&gt; money"

I bet if we did a survey on this mailing list, you'd find that quite a
few use the Lynx text-only browser. This is because most of the
'meaningful' content on the internet is in the text, not the fancy
pictures and sound. Are you saying that now with the introduction of TV
there is no use for written communication?

Web page's are pure ASCII, so yes, they should be able to write them.
The page's won't have fancy graphics (like animated gif's, porn ad
banner's etc), and the author will have to learn HTML, but their
homepage will probably be better than most due to them focussing on WHAT
they're saying, not how their page looks. Beside's, learning a skill
like writing HTML is a good thing, and should be encouraged.

There is a topic on Slashdot at the moment about how GUI's in school's
don't teach kid's 'real' computer skills. I grew up with a commodore in
my primary school, and I feel that I had some advantage over some of the
kid's of today. MacOS, WinNT, or 95 doesn't come with a way to easily
write your own simple programs. I did a yr5 presentation on programming
basic on the C64 (imput 2 numbers, display sum+product, enter name-&gt;
"Hello, Name" etc) and I wasn't the only one. Howmany don't know:

10 print "Mrs Crabapple smells"
20 goto 10

As for damaging user's vision, well, I can still see, and I wasted my
youth on BubbleBobble, Midnight resistance and Stunt Car Racer :)
