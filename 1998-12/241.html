&gt; I think we would, knowing Microsoft.  Let's face it, we call IE "Microsoft
&gt; Internet Explorer" even though it was written by Spyglass.
Probably.

&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;  If someone started a (hypothetical) project to port the 4.4BSD
&gt; userland (libraries, compiler, utilities) to Linux I sincerely doubt they'd
&gt; stop calling it Linux.  Not that as far as I can tell that'd be legal:
&gt; GPL'ed kernel and Berkeley-license userland, no problems at all.  It
&gt; wouldn't even need Linus' blessing, because he only owns the copright
&gt; on the kernel.
&gt; 
What I was trying to get across in the previous paragraph is that it seems
a chicken/egg thing. If GNU released an OS, using the linux kernel, before
the linux kernel hackers used the GNU utilities, chances are it'd be
called GNU. And yes, I know they wouldn't do that, they've got the Hurd.
:)

Btw, can anybody clear this up for me? Is the Hurd:
* GNU reinventing the wheel
* or GNU writing a kernel on a "better"? microkernel architecture, rather
than the monolithic style in which Linux is written.

It's the "better" that I'd like to clear up. Are microkernel's generally
faster/better/nicer/meatier?

&gt;  &gt; I don't know much about Solaris, but I'm guessing its basic utils are
&gt;  &gt; written by Sun.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course they weren't.  They were written by AT&T's USL (or USG, depending
&gt; on the timeframe), which was bought by Novell's UnixSwear group, which
&gt; was later sold to SCO.
Oh. :)

&gt; 
&gt; Oh for gods sake -- "Publically insulted the GNU efforts" by not saying
&gt; GNU/Linux?  Be serious, please.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the noble cause?  Promoting and providing free software as a 
&gt; legitimate alternative to proprietry liberty-damaging functionality-poor
&gt; commercial software?  Or enforcing the GPL?  'cos they're not the same
&gt; thing, you know, and many GPL evangelists seem to forget that.
&gt; 
Would like to respond to all the previous paragraphs in the following
manner:

Whoops.

I guess I just got a little hurt when software developed by volunteers is
referred to as "Stallman on world domination". And as before my whole
reason for the GNU/Linux thing is that I don't like to see good work done
go without credit. I'm not really a GPL evangelist, more of a GNU
evangelist, mainly because I use GNU utilities in atleast half the things
I do in Linux, and I kinda think they deserve a little respect.

I understand what you're saying with the embedded systems stuff, and yes,
I more or less stuffed up in that respect. But, as before, my heart was
with Stallman/Co, not with the FSF's license. I know it didn't sound that
way, but that's the main reason for my vehemence.

Michael.
