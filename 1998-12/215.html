 &gt; &gt;As for the "the packets include the LAN ip address" thing, what I think
 &gt; &gt;happens here is that some sort of connection is established by you sending
 &gt; &gt;the message, and the icq on the remote end sends packets through this
 &gt; &gt;connection. This is handled the normal masq way.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The way I understood how masquerading works, when my Win box sends a packet
 &gt; out over the LAN, destined for the Net, it has only got a LAN header in the
 &gt; packets and what the linux gateway machine does is to add an Internet header
 &gt; to the packets, so the packets have 2 lots of headers.

Not quite.

When your Winblows box sends a packet it just transmits it as a perfectly
normal IP packet, no different from any other IP packet it'd send if it
wasn't masquerading (remember, the whole point of masquerading is that
the machines behind the firewall aren't aware that masquerading is 
happening).

Let's try a worked example:  Imagine your Winblows box is 192.168.30.1
and your Linux box is 192.168.30.2, with a PPP interface on 203.23.150.33.

Here's what happens when you telnet from the Winblows box to archie.au:

1.  At connection establishment time, the Winblows box allocates
    an essentially random port number for its end of the connection
    (let's call it port 12345).  Because you're telneting to archie.au
    the destination port number is 23.

         [ 192.168.30.1 : 12345 ] -&gt; [ archie.au : 23 ]

    This packet is sent via the default router, as judged by the Winblows
    box's routing table.

2.  The default router, your Linux system, receives the packet and sucks
    it into the kernel.  The kernel says, "Ah, I'm masquerading," and
    allocates a random port number for the masqueraded connection (let's
    say it's port 23456) and rewrites the IP header in the packet from
    the Winblows box before retransmitting it.  So the packet becomes:

         [ 203.23.150.33 : 23456 ] -&gt; [ archie.au : 23 ]

3.  This packet makes its way out onto the net, and eventually arrives
    at archie.au.  archie.au will want to ACK it or send some other data
    back;  when it does that it transmits to the source address/port in
    the IP header used at connection establishment time;  In this case,
    that's the PPP interface IP address on your Linux box and port number
    23456.  So returning packets look like:

         [ archie.au : 23 ] -&gt; [ 203.23.150.33 : 23456 ]

4.  When such a packet arrives on your Linux PPP interface the reverse
    of step (2) is carried out:  The linux box says, "Ah, port 23456 
    belongs to a masqueraded connection.  When I established it I made
    sure I remembered that port 23456 actually corresponds to 
    192.168.30.1 port 12345, so I'll rewrite the *destination* address
    accordingly:

         [ archie.au : 23 ] -&gt; [ 192.168.30.2 : 12345 ]

Results:

 a. Winblows box thinks it's directly connected to the net even though it
    is firewalled;

 b. Internet machines can't get packets to the Winblows box unless it has
    already established a connection (i.e.: incoming connections yield a
    connection refused message from the Linux machine, assuming they're 
    routable at all).

(b) is sometimes seen as a security benefit, but it's also sometimes
seen as a problem (if you want an ftp or web server on your LAN, for
example).  You can get ride of the problematic aspects of it by saying
to your Linux box, "here's a port number:  Whenever you see packets 
coming in on this port number, forward them to this other port number on
this other IP address".  For instance, you might say, "forward packets
destined for [ 203.23.150.33 : 80 ] to [ 192.168.30.1 : 1025 ]."  Then
HTTP connections to your Linux box would be redirected to a web server
running on port 1025 on your Winblows box (yech).

That's what you have to set up to make ICQ work.  The above also explains
why many network interactions are asymmetric when you use masquerading
(i.e.: you can do something to other hosts, but they can't do it back to
you).

Hope this helps,
