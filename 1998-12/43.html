At 12:31 3/12/98 , you wrote:
&gt;This reminds me of lots of people saying that every plane that's airborne
&gt;is going to fall from the sky on January 1. I mean why? Does the plane
&gt;think "Uh oh... jumbo jets haven't been invented yet, i'd better get my ass
&gt;back on the ground ASAP!" or what? And how about the pilots? Surely they
&gt;can just turn OFF the autopilot and control the things manually? :)

Planes don't think. Not yet anyway. I think you kinda missed my point. I
gave the examples of hard coded firmware to make absolutely sure people
would distinguish my rant from the media hype.

Hard coded firmware is where most of the problems with electronic systems
will be. I've heard people say that planes will start falling out of the
sky, but of course they wont. However, your jumbo jet comment has made me
realize that so many people really don't understand Y2K. Even people in the
computer industry. Y2K requires lateral thinking. You can't just say "If I
move my pawn to King Four, I'll take his Rook". You have to extrapolate the
results of one action and apply them to the next action. You move your pawn
and you may loose the game.

An Aeroplane is a very technically complex thing and it has many many
"computers" on board. A computer isn't a Typewriter in front of a TV that
is sitting on a briefcase. It can be a ROM chip on a circuit board. What
does it do? Who wrote the code? Where are they now?

Did they think as far ahead as 4 digit years, or just two?

Will the component fail?

The Challenger space shuttle fell out of the sky cause a little piece of
rubber got too cold. I'm not saying that this will happen. It will probably
be much less spectacular. The plane may simply not start up. So all you
have to do is refund a few tickets. Wouldn't be that expensive for the
airline, would it?

Think about it a bit.

Cheers

Alex!
