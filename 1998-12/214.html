&gt;As for the "the packets include the LAN ip address" thing, what I think
&gt;happens here is that some sort of connection is established by you sending
&gt;the message, and the icq on the remote end sends packets through this
&gt;connection. This is handled the normal masq way.


The way I understood how masquerading works, when my Win box sends a packet
out over the LAN, destined for the Net, it has only got a LAN header in the
packets and what the linux gateway machine does is to add an Internet header
to the packets, so the packets have 2 lots of headers.

Then when a computer wants to send a packet back to my win box, if I have
sent a packet to it, it will have both headers, so it can construct the
header info the same as packets originating from my win box, so they make it
back. This is why people have to send me their ICQ messages through the
server until I send them a reply, because then they have my LAN IP info.

Maybe I have got it wrong, but that's the way I understood how it works...

Cheers
Dazz
