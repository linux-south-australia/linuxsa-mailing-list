&gt; &gt;This reminds me of lots of people saying that every plane that's airborne
&gt; &gt;is going to fall from the sky on January 1. I mean why? Does the plane
&gt; &gt;think "Uh oh... jumbo jets haven't been invented yet, i'd better get my ass
&gt; &gt;back on the ground ASAP!" or what? And how about the pilots? Surely they
&gt;
&gt; *laugh* cute, but...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;can just turn OFF the autopilot and control the things manually? :)
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but what if GPS or similar systems are based on some date
&gt; calculations?  How long since I moved from here to here?  It's all very
&gt; well to say "do things manually" but what if all their tools that help
&gt; them are giving them incorrect information?
&gt;
&gt; Sure, it's unlikely that a plane will come flailing out of the air, but
&gt; it's quite likely that their will be glitches that, if no-one watches
&gt; out for them/follows "the computer must be right"[1] syndrome will result
&gt; in some disasters.
&gt;

Having been in a 747 that nearly air stalled in spite of three voting auto
something redundant systems, let me say that you have to watch out (the pilot
didn't notice his computer had failed!!!! not flying with that airline again),
the co-pilot didn't tell him about the iminent disaster his own computer was
predicting, two out three computers were right. Unfortunately the one being
watched was wrong (or dead). The plane finally told everyone in its own
inimittable way (violent shuderring), that something bad was going to happen if
emergency procedures weren't followed. 10 minutes and thousands of feet later we
had air speed. Who needs Y2K? we just have bad procedures anywhere.
