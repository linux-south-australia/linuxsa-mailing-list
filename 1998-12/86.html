I added the -r in my man.config, and it works ! :)) Thanks for that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;PS. Compiling a customised linux system from scratch is harder than I
&gt; &gt;thought it would be. If anybody needs any pointers on how this is done,
&gt; &gt;feel free to mail me. :)
&gt; It would be an ineresting topic to cover in a show and tell session at
&gt; one of our meetings.
If there's enough demand for it I'll prepare a talk about it, but as it
stands I've still got quite a bit to do. I can compile stuff, run X, and
connect to the internet so I'm happy with its current setup.

Anyway, if people want me to give a quick talk about my experiences
sometime next month, just shout. It's not exactly for beginners though,
and I won't be using RPM's at all in my examples. Actually, I think the
only thing on this new setup which hasn't been compiled locally is the rc5
decoder ;)

There's one more thing, too. I need -any- input on a problem I'm currently
having compiling a CVS'ed version of the Gnome libs. I've tried my hardest
to edit the makefile and source code, but to no avail.

I'm getting this when I run a make in gnome-libs/gtk-xmhtml:

../gtk-xmhtml/.libs/libgtkxmhtml.so: undefined reference to `uncompress'
../gtk-xmhtml/.libs/libgtkxmhtml.so: undefined reference to `compress'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

AFAIK, it means that compress and uncompress are prototyped in the header
files, but the code for the functions themselves doesn't actually exist in
libgtkxmhtml.so. Compress and uncompress are part of the zlib libraries,
and everything in the header files and their code seems to be correct.
Actually, I'm pretty sure that it's a difficulty in the gnome-libs code
itself - probably something wrong in the makefile. I do a ldd -r on
.libs/libgtkxmhtml.so and get a list of undefined symbols about 80 lines
long. ie:

undefined symbol: XGetFontProperty      ()
undefined symbol: gtk_container_get_type        ()
undefined symbol: jpeg_finish_output    ()
undefined symbol: gtk_signal_connect    ()
undefined symbol: gtk_button_new_with_label     ()
undefined symbol: gdk_window_set_background     ()
etcetcblah

What I think this means is that the auxilary libraries that libgtkxmhtml
depends on aren't actually getting linked in to the final .so. I have no
idea whatsoever on how to correct this. Erm. Help! :)

Ta, Michael.

PS. I know I should just use the pretested tarballs, but I'm a glutton for
punishment.
