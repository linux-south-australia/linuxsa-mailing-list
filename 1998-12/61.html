&gt; 
&gt; Free old comptuer stuff would be great for giving
&gt; away to schools and other worthy institutions

Camp Quality (for kids with Cancer, or who have
survived it) have a computer program for their
kids

&gt; where we come in is that we know how to make
&gt; useful computers out of old 386s etc. by sticking linux on them.
&gt; 386s and 486s and other old stuff get thrown out sometimes 
&gt; just because wind95/98/NT/2000 can't work well with them.

Anyway, the two ideas were:

1) Why not a periodic LINUX SA Swap Meet?

   (it could be a fund-raiser, i.e. *if*
   we were actually an organisation...)

   It could still be run as a fund-raiser
   for some *other* charitable organisation

2) Instead of farming the bits & pieces out
   to anybody at all... why not make it avail-
   able to those who seek to get into LINUX?

   There are - in this community - people who
   can't afford computers for their kids...

   Some of these kids might possibly get off
   to a better start towards a career, e.g.
   if they got BOTH a computer with LINUX on
   it AND a bit of direction from a strong
   organisation like LINUX SA...

   (Or are we too "lost" in the pleasures of
   computing to remember the next generation?)
