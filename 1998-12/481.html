I know it's a bit old now, but 'nacctd' doesn't do too bad a job
at comprimising the tidyness of ipfwadm and the verboseness of tcpdump.
The package is called "Net-Acct.0.4" (network accounting daemon) and it
_was_ still available on a few Sunsite mirrors (nearly a year ago now tho).

It has a config file, in which you can customise how much info it logs
per packet and what subnets to watch/ignore, and is quite well-geared 
towards keeping tabs on ppp connections (although I'm primarily logging
what they pull into the server's eth0 off the LAN and _then_ back out
on the ppp device).

It writes to a file in /var/log and I have a perl cronjob that, once a day 
(midnight actually), kills the dameon, parses its log into a neater formated 
master log and clears the net-acct log file before restarting the daemon.
I find this 24 hr lifespan also helps the daemon from getting too flaky. ;-)

Caveats:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It logs both eth and ppp interfaces. ie: it can log the same packet twice
and the only visible difference is that one log entry will have "eth0" as
it's dev and the other will have "ppp0".

- It only has about a 95% success rate of logging packets so you may
not get BOTH the ppp and eth entries for a given packet.
(I get around this by producing two totals for a user and taking
the larger, ie: the dev that missed the least). The acuracy would
undoubtably go up on a system with less individual ppp connections
to worry about.

- You need ppp2.3.5 to be able to grab the username via the "auth-up",
and "auth-down" scripts (only supported by ver 2.3.5). It uses them to
write the username to a file in /var/run (named by the IP assigned),
which it queries when logging packets. 
*You can also put files there for the IPs of servers/domains that 
you want logged, ie: it will put the value found in the file (the domain
name) 
as the username of the logged packet.

- If the packet is coming from somewhere on the same subnet, it checks
the sender for ID (before checking if there is a username for the receiver).
*I have hacked this part of the code to make the order reversed. I can make
a patch (or atleast a diff statement) to make this bit easy to fix, but
unless you are trying to log dialup users on an ISP LAN I don't think
it will be necessary.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, this daemon is probably more suited to a multiuser system, 
(where you need to know WHO as well as HOW MUCH) but I thought it might 
be worth a mention for anyone who has tried the other two and was looking
for alternatives.

Hope this helps,
-Daniel
