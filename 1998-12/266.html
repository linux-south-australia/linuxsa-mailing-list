&gt; &gt; Free for you, but if it's comes from outside Australia, someone always
&gt; &gt; pays. It's an unfortuate consequence of byte charging, rather than pipe
&gt; &gt; charging. The 'time/bandwidth free' accounts you refer to will probably be
&gt; &gt; a thing of the past soon. A petrol station would never stay in business if
&gt; &gt; it said "We fill up any petrol tank for $20".
&gt;
&gt;They would if they did extensive market research and concluded that
&gt;the average amount customers spend per visit is $19.

Before I comment, you must realise that market research conducted before
you introduce your new pricing model, will only be able to make *educated
guesses* about the customer's usage patterns once the new prices are
introduced. If the petrol station existed that did the market research you
mention, then adopted a flat rate pricing model, I would buy a petrol tanker.

&gt;It's a bit like Pizza Hut's "All-You-Can-Eat for $8.99".

It's almost nothing like Pizza Hut's "all you can eat".

&gt;They
&gt;worked out that the average table of four finished the evening with
&gt;a $30 bill, so they said, "If we charge $8.99 for all you can eat
&gt;we'll get a table of four paying $36 instead of $30, *AND* we won't have
&gt;to pay for table service staff, meaning we can employ 3 people per
&gt;shift instead of 15."

Yes, but they knew that the usage patterns would not change dramatically if
they changed the pricing model to "all you can eat"

You've made a few assuptions here, that don't work with ISPs.

The average you've calculated is not deviated from very much at Pizza Hut.
Sure a really big eater may come in and down heaps of food, but the actuall
cost of the food is small compared ot the cost of the staff, rent, the
franchise, etc. These are the fixed costs, but they are also the biggest. 

An ISP's biggest cost is a variable cost...      DATA!

An Internet User can download at least 100 Meg per day if they want to,
over a month, in data alone this will cost almost $600 per month. The
average 'flat rate' or 'unlimted' account ranges from $20 to over $50 per
month.

The subsidies, asymetric routing, caching and peering will cover alot of
this, but it still is a bad pricing model if you want your business to
survive or even grow. I'd guess that the biggest Pizza Hut eater is going
to down $20 worth of food at the most. (That is probably about 4 family pizzas)

&gt;ISP time charging works the same way:  ISPs pay their provider by the
&gt;megabyte (in this country - not in any others), but they charge their
&gt;customers by the hour.  They do that because they average out how 
&gt;many bytes a typical customer will download per hour and factor that
&gt;into their hourly rate.

Very clever, but you'll notice that the e-mail you repiled to and the
e-mail it was in reply to, was talking about FLATE RATE accounts, NOT time
charging. 

&gt;Flat-rate internet connectivity is the same, 
&gt;except they average over a 24 hour period instead.

No we don't, otherwise I'd be asking for $300 per month from you.

Of course time charging works. It's the oldest Internet charging model
around. The petrol station could offer petrol and they could charge per
minute at the pump, and they could make a profit.

But $20 bucks a tank and they go out of business. $100 a tank they still go
out of business.

I said it before and I'll say it again.

As long as this country's Internet Access is charged for volume and not
pipe-size, flat-rate unlimited-data accounts, will become rarer and rarer.

There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Even the heavily subsidised lunches are getting harder to find.

Cheers

Alex!
