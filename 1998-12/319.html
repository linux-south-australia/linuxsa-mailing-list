Well, it seems that we have two camps here. Some agree with me and the other
mailing lists that we might be a little better off with an identifier in the
header, and others are vehemently against it. (by the way, the identifier
could be appended to the subject. In that case it would not interfere with
your reading the title of the message)

The main problem is this: I have Outlook Express, because I can't get PPP
going via Linux. Why? I don't know. If there is such a magical app in Linux
that filters perfectly - great. I'll just have to wait until I figure out
PPP, won't I.

In the meantime I've tried the various suggestions (ie. filtering by cc and
to, and even checking the last three lines in the message's body) but
neither Eudora Pro nor Outlook Express work 100%. I still get some messages
coming through to my Inbox.

On the other hand every single SLUG message arrives duely in the right box.

Now, I receive a large quantity of mail daily and it is not easy to filter
all messages by hand.

Sorry, to have bothered some of you - won't happen again.

To all those that gave constructive criticism. Thank you. You have given me
some great ideas, and it has improved my filtering quite a bit.
