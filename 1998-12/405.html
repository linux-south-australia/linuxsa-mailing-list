&gt; &gt; For what it's worth, i'm using the same dodgy mail client, and it

&gt;Hey!  New list motto!  "I fiddled with some options and it started

&gt;
&gt;    - mark :-)

Well, doesn't that just describe how most Microstuffed programs "work"?
I work with a lot of windows users, and so frequently when something was
broken, and then fixed, the only apparent solution was to 'fiddle' with
options, which apparently shouldn't make a difference but do.
It's like how, when someone has a problem with Windoze, you just tell them
to reboot twice, and see you in the morning if the trouble persists.
However, the rebooting usually does the job, and the PC returns to normal.

Linux is far more consistant O/S. If something doesn't work, there is
actually a reason for it, and if you change options around, then there a
definate effect. If Linux is working, it will keep on working, and it's also
that much harder to break in the first place, unless someone starts playing
with options they don't understand.

Now, what would we prefer? Random failures and random fixes from Micro$oft,
or hard certainty from Linux.
If windows crashes all the time, you don't know if it's hardware or software
or what.... If linux crashes all the time, or even much at all ;), you know
your hardware must be screwed.
