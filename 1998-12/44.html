&gt;This reminds me of lots of people saying that every plane that's airborne

&gt;back on the ground ASAP!" or what? And how about the pilots? Surely they

*laugh* cute, but...

&gt;can just turn OFF the autopilot and control the things manually? :)

Yes, but what if GPS or similar systems are based on some date
calculations?  How long since I moved from here to here?  It's all very
well to say "do things manually" but what if all their tools that help
them are giving them incorrect information?

Sure, it's unlikely that a plane will come flailing out of the air, but
it's quite likely that their will be glitches that, if no-one watches
out for them/follows "the computer must be right"[1] syndrome will result
in some disasters.

1: When you calculate something on a PC or calculator, so the answer
must be right... (Can you say Intel FDIV bug? :P)
