&gt; When you have chosen these ports it is just a simple matter of
&gt; forwarding them from the ipmasq box with ipautofw or similar program.

This is possible, although whether it is a simple matter is arguable, and
very much depends on your circumstance.  Hypothetically, if you use a
computer in a lab at a school, which connects to the internet via a
masquerading gateway, you are almost certainly not going to be able to
configure the gateway to forward incoming requests on your designated
port to whatever computer you happen to be using.  On the other hand,
and equally hypothetically, if you have a masquerading gateway in your
home, and you always run IRC client from the computer in your bedroom
(who doesn't :-)) it's a totally different matter.

Note that the sort of forwarding you described is dependant on the type
of masquerading gateway.  Since this is a linux mailing list, probably
it's a simple matter to use ipfwadm's -r option for those few circumstances
where you can say what masqueraded computer is going to offer whatever
service.  (IRC DCC in bedroom, SMTP in lounge, etc.)  In no case do you
get to have the same service on more than two computers.  You can put
your anonymous FTP server in the hallway, but then you cannot offer
FTP in the kitchen.

Regards,

David
