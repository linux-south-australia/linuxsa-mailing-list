Here's a tale of a lost three day weekend trying to dual boot Linux and NT.

I followed the instructions in apcmag's Linux Pocket Book (After my
experience this weekend I consider this little gem a poisonous, poorly
researched publication, but as you will read later, it does bring me closer
to Elvis.)

1 - Bought and installed a new 4.3 GB disk in a Pentium 120

2 - Created one 2 GB partition using the NT format program and left the rest
unpartitioned.

3 - Installed NT and all my software on the new partition, all working well.

4 - Tried to install Redhat Linux 5.2 on the remaining unpartitioned portion
of my disk, got to the disk druid part of the installation but couldn't
create the / partition. Error message - Unallocated partition, boot ( or
root partition, can't remember which) to big. I didn't know what that meant
so started reading the Redhat manual (as the Linux Pocket Book was
completely useless from here on)

 5 - After reading the Redhat Manual, Linux Undercover Howtos and various
Internet Web pages, discovered that LILO and the kernel should not / will
not be installed above cylinder 1023. Meaning that on my new large disc,
Linux must be on the first partition.

6 - Start all over again, repartition the disc and install NT and all my
software on the second partition, NT is again working OK

7 - Installed Linux on the second partition. LILO boots Linux, but no option
to load NT

8 - I discovered too late, that the statement on page 26 in LPB is
completely wrong (for NT at least) To quote the LPB "if you are planning to
have a multi-boot system and you already have Windows installed, you will
need to install LILO to your MBR." In fact for NT you must install LILO at
the start of your Linux partition and that partition must be below cylinder
1023.

5 - I can't boot NT or repair NT using the repair disc. Spend hours trying
to get things working. Get totally pissed off. Spit the dummy. Decide @&#$
it, I'll remove the lot and just install NT, as I need all that windows
software to do my job.

6 - I read lots more, and discover that I should use Linux fdisk to remove
the partition as MS fdisk will have problems recovering the total disk
capacity. I do that, but MS fdisk still doesn't recover all my disk space.
In fact I spent most of Monday and all of Tuesday evening trying everything
that I can think off, to convince fdisk that my disk is actually quite a bit
larger. MS fdisk is stubborn. MS fdisk insists that my brand spanking 4.3GB
disk is actually only 475MB!

7 - Finally, I understand why Elvis shot his Cadillac when it wouldn't
start! . I have this overwhelming urge to shoot fdisk, LPB and Linux. I
didn't like his music but I'm now a soul brother

8 - Wednesday evening. Install NT on a 300MB partition that MS fdisk lets me
create.Thank you fdisk. Discover that NT's format program does believe me
that the disc is really 4.3GB. Create a further four 1 GB partitions and
decided to keep the 300MB partition as a system partition, hope fervently
that NT wont need any more than that. Installed all my windows software.
Wrote and sent this using Outlook Express instead of Pine, but right now
I'll take anything that works.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I had a similar problem Stephen and I'm not sure I fixed it the best
&gt;way
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt; what I did was used NT's format program in the installation procedure
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; delete
&gt;&gt; &gt; all partitions and then allocated 1.7Gb to NT and 1.5 I left
&gt;unformatted.
&gt;&gt; I then
&gt;&gt; &gt; finished installing NT and then went on to reinstall Linux. I tried to
&gt;&gt; folow the
&gt;&gt; &gt; HowTo for an NT Linux Dual boot but I couldn't get it to work so I just
&gt;&gt; use a
&gt;&gt; &gt; Boot Disk for Linux.  I hope this helps, has anyone had more success,
&gt;If
&gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt; &gt; please send details.
