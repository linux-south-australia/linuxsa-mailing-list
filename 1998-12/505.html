Sorry, I had to join in...
 
&gt; &gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any software they get goes no where else... (granted that C-64 s/w might
&gt; &gt;go on a C-128... but is that anywhere else?)
&gt; 
&gt; Sould we eliminate Mac software since it can't go onto pure PC's, or PC
&gt; software since it can't go onto Macs then? How about BeOS software? Should
&gt; we scrap that as well?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't speak for any other Linux SA people, but I'd guess that some of
&gt; &gt;them
&gt; &gt;might consider what you're doing not unlike what Microsoft is doing... i.e.
&gt; &gt;helping to lock people into systems that have hidden costs and less than
&gt; &gt;optimal performance (*far* less, in the case of 8-bit Commodore technology)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure most C64 users know what their computers are capable of. You've
&gt; obviously missed the point that some people don't have a choice, and are
&gt; simply working with what they have.
&gt; Should we stop supporting people with 486/306's as well, since their PC's
&gt; can't reasonably be upgraded? Are these people who only have 386/486
&gt; machines "locked in" as well?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;At least, use of the heavy-weight Microsoft products yield presentable
&gt; &gt;docu-
&gt; &gt;ments that *their* customers can make money with... e.g. resumes for job-
&gt; &gt;hunting, newsletters/books, computer programs, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;For all its "bloat" I'd have to say that the MS choice empowers its
&gt; &gt;users...
&gt; &gt;giving those who put their minds to it the opportunity to increase their
&gt; &gt;wealth
&gt; &gt;so that they can (later) afford Multi-CPU, 256 Mb RAM, 23 Gb Hard Drives...
&gt; 
&gt; And what if people don't want to create nice looking resume's, and print
&gt; 24-bit graphics? Some people just want to read and send email, and you only
&gt; need 2 colors for that... the foreground, and the background.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I believe that it is morally wrong to lead people down a dead-end road in
&gt; &gt;IT.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; The road is already there, All that's being done is another roadsign is
&gt; being put on it.
&gt; 

It is a matter of courses for horses. For some people, that "dead end"
pathway may be more than sufficient for their needs. After all, not
everyone wants to be at the cutting edge, they are perfectly happy
as long as their solution works (even if it doesn't have all of the
bells and whistles that a more expensive one does!)

&gt; &gt;But to equate your clients with C-xx[x], saying that it is the perfect
&gt; &gt;match for them,
&gt; &gt;I think I would feel really *insulted* were I to be likened to computers
&gt; &gt;which:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - are slow, unreliable, costly to repair,
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah? I can get a C64 for about $5 from a garage sale, maybe another $50
&gt; for a monitor. You won't even get the LABOR for a computer repair for that
&gt; cheap.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  - have spares only available from used throw-aways,
&gt; &gt;  - can possibly affect users' vision, if TV used as display,
&gt; 
How reliable do you consider much of the equipment that many of us use
on
even the newest computers? I see hardware failures all the time around
the
place, and 99.999% are not caused by people mistreating their computer.
As well as this, they are not all old computers; one of my friends
bought one
and in 2 weeks the monitor failed. After it was replaced, the HDD
Controller
failed. After this the motherboard died. All were replaced under
warrenty.
(The company has since gone bankrupt...) :)
 

&gt; &gt;  - don't seem to have much new software being developed for them these
&gt; &gt;days,

And how much attention do you pay to information on C64/128's?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now, I grant you this:  If somebody's parent[s] squanders the family income
&gt; &gt;at the pokies, leaving very little for tech'y toys, etc. then - in such a
&gt; &gt;case,
&gt; &gt;there *might* be an excuse to go back to the dark ages of 8-bit C-xx[x]'s.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In *such* a family (which has demonstrated its ignorance of value-for-money
&gt; &gt;by losing $ at the pokies), it would be quite consistent with handing down
&gt; &gt;a tradition from one generation to the next; no less foolish, but
&gt; &gt;consistent.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
Do you think that is is nessesary or fair to make judgements on someone
elses choice of computer or to feel that they should justify their
choice?
I do realise that if they had been given incorrect information and based
their choice on the wrong information, then that may be an exception,
but
for someone who just wants email, (_PLAIN TEXT_ I might add, seeing as
some
people on the list are sensitive to HTML formatted email...) It would be
overkill to buy a dual pentium II 450 MHz with 256 MB RAM and a 23 GB
HDD...
Why bother spending multi thousand $ on a machine that you aren't even
going
to put the smallest load on?

I feel that you should be more understanding of people's needs other
than
yourself. Not everyone wants a computer for making money, nor does
everyone
intend to have all of the latest and greatest features and CPU chocking
apps. Many are perfectly happy to just get along with something that is
simple, cheap and that works. Why can't you just let them do it?

Sam.
