&gt;1.how to install new fonts (for X windows)?
&gt;2.where to get new fonts?
&gt;3.how to verify what type of fonts we have for X?

It appears that we have been slow to respond as Syahrul Nizam 
had to post a follow up to the above - I don't have all the
answers but I will do my best.

Q2. The easiest option is to look for fonts included with your
distribution, for instance, looking at the available fonts for
Debian 2.0 one can find packages such as: xfntil2, xfntscl,
xfntbase, xfnt75 ... and so on.  On the other hand, you may
be looking for unpackaged fonts, you could try a search
engine.  (Although the HOWTO's on my machine don't include
it, I saw a reference to Xfonts.HOWTO when I searched for 
the items on the above list, it may be out there!)

Q1. Again, assuming that you are installing fonts from scratch
rather than having a package do it for you:

	1. Depending on the type of font files that you get,
	it may be necessary to convert them from a text
	format (used for distribution) to a binary format.
	For instance, an exercise I recently completed,
	required the use of bdftopcf - refer to the man page.

	2. Put it into your fontpath (or adjust your fontpath
	to suit).  In my example, I used /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
	Look in your XF86config file for fontpaths.

	3. Run mkfontdir in that directory, this will rewrite
	the file fonts.dir.  If you remove the font, run
	mkfontdir again to prevent silly error messages later on.

BTW, another way to adjust the fontpath is with the command:
	xset fp+ your_font_directory
This may be usefull for testing, or on a machine where one doesn't
have write permission to the default font path.

Q3. You will know its installed if xfontsel and xfd can display it.
Also, many X clients take the option "-fn font_name".  At a lower
level, work backwards from the answers to Q2 and Q1 - determine
your fontpath and examine its contents directly.

Hope this helps,
