Of course - you continue to monitor the new pricing regime and nuke
it if it stops making money for you -- Which is what you're proposing
is about to happen with bandwidth pricing. 

In the long term, I disagree with you.  Here's why:

Currently most ISPs are like petrol stations:

The reason fuel is expensive is taxes and a corrupt cartel of oil
producers.  The reason bandwidth is expensive is Telstra's extortive 
costs and government mismanagement (which counts as "taxes" for the 
purposes of this discussion).

Now let's look at Telstra itself -- It's more like the pizza hut:


Pizza hut                               Telstra
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pizza ingredients are dirt cheap        Long-haul bandwidth is dirt cheap

Employees, advertising and real estate  Employees, advertising, administration,
are expensive but necessary because     the local loop and real estate are
they're the things which permit people  expensive but necessary because they
to use Pizza Hut's services.            are required if people are to use
                                        Telstra's services.

There was a time when the only place you could go to get cheap pizza
was Pizza Hut (sure, there were local neighbourhood pizza shops, but
they were more expensive).  During that phase, Pizza Hut dealt with
the cost of overheads and the desire for profit by selling the
pizzas made from dirt-cheap ingredients for comparitively very high
prices.  Telstra is presently doing that with bandwidth too (and they
want to do it more:  Time charged local calls, for instance, even though
there's no relationship between the duration of a call and the cost
of provisioning resources for it).

Anyway, other pizza chains entered the market and competed with Pizza
Hut.  The other chains didn't offer dine-in service, so their overheads
(employees, real estate) were smaller.  In order to compete properly
Pizza Hut offered a delivery service just like the other chains, but it
still had the dine-in bit and found that because the market had come
conditioned to eating pizza at home the dine-in part of each Pizza Hut
franchise was underutilized -- So they had lots of people and real
estate that wasn't being used.

Their strategy to "fix" that was to make dine-in attractive by making
it cheap.  The model of serving customers in a buffet-style
also requires less people, which nicely eliminated another huge outgoing.
It also meant that instead of having a restaurant 25% occupied with
people paying different amounts per seat they had 'em close to 100% 
occupied with each person paying $8.99.

[ of course, the novelty has worn off now, as Chuckie pointed out -- The
  one I was at last night was still packed out, though :-) ]

Turn to Telstra:  Just like it's most efficient for Pizza Hut to totally
fill a restaurant with people paying $8.99, Telstra would get a huge
payoff by encouraging flat-rate usage:  They'd get more usage, meaning
they could sell their excess capacity (they are currently over-provisioned
for bandwidth by a factor of several thousand);  They'd get a constant
cashflow;  They'd get simplified (cheaper) billing software, and they
could cut staff because they wouldn't need to employ so many thousands
of people to answer billing complaints.

But they won't do that because in the present non-competitive telco 
industry it's easier for them to maximise profits by maintaining 
artificially high prices like Pizza Hut used to do and like oil companies
do now.  The customer is the loser, but Telstra doesn't need to care
because the customer basically has no alternative (since telstra's 
competitors are all playing essentially the same game -- Those that
aren't completely at Telstra's mercy for pricing are, anyway).

Things which change that picture:  Satellite Internet delivery (which
drastically reduces the amount of data which needs to be pulled through
Telstra's overcharged service even if they are backchannel charging)
and the recent announcement by the ACCC that they're declaring the local
loop, so you won't have to think about Telstra at all if you don't want
to.

The local loop is the biggest cost of providing bandwidth to a home
(whether it's bandwidth via telephone or ISDN or xDSL doesn't matter,
the local loop still costs money).  When Telstra's competitors have
access to that without needing to pay the extortive prices Telstra
is currently charging for it, those competitors will be able to lower
their prices like they've never lowered them before.  Expect lots of
ISPs to say, "Hey, I'm a telco too!" and install routers in Telstra
exchange third-party rooms for permanent connectivity, and watch
the price of that connectivity fall through the floor.

When you take the price of the local loop out of the cost of delivering
bandwidth, the distance component is negligible.  If the distance
component of raw bandwidth is negligible, then long haul TCP/IP carried
over those cheap links can also be negligible.  Then we'll get 
vindication of my assertion that there's absolutely no justification
for Telstra's 19c/Mbyte charge for bandwidth, and the Internet industry
in Australia can start behaving like the Internet industry in virtually
every other country in the world (i.e.: more like the Pizza Hut).
