&gt;&gt; And who pays for the 560Mb of data at $0.20 Mb .. that's over $100 for a

&gt;&gt; Not to mention the Time it would take to get that amount of data.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Erm. Without time/bandwidth limits. Bandwidth that isn't charged. Ie, you
&gt;connect, set it to download, and leave it overnight for a few nights. Yes,
&gt;it takes lots of time, but it's free. And I thought I might aswell mention
&gt;the option. ;p

Free for you, but if it's comes from outside Australia, someone always
pays. It's an unfortuate consequence of byte charging, rather than pipe
charging. The 'time/bandwidth free' accounts you refer to will probably be
a thing of the past soon. A petrol station would never stay in business if
it said "We fill up any petrol tank for $20".

As was mentioned before, buy the CD, or download from a local mirror, but
for goodness sake, in the interests of keeing Internet costs down in
Australia, DON'T download the 400Meg from ftp.redhat.com.

Using the word "free" in your above statements makes great projects like
SAIX, Ausbone and Ausbytes look like a waste of time!

Cheers

Alex!
