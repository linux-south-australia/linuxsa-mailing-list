&gt; Was planning to install from the pocketbook CD this wekend, as a dual-boot
&gt; with linux and windows-95, but these reported problems have scared me as I
&gt; have no practical way of backing up my files (other than downloading them
&gt; down the phone line - ugh!) and I don't have the win-95 install disks if I
&gt; need to reinstall (it's a work machine...)
&gt; 
&gt; So are these problems only occurring with NT, or is it more generic with
&gt; dual-booting Linux? (haven't heard anyone mention 95...)
&gt; Is anyone from APC reading this mailing list? Do you have a fix for these
&gt; complaints? Are they filtering through directly?

&gt;         Subject:        Removing Linux
&gt; 
&gt;         I tried to dual boot a machine with Linux and NT without success. I
&gt; now need
&gt;         to remove Linux and reformat the disk so that I can reinstall NT.
&gt; 
&gt;          I used Linux fdisk to remove all the partitions but now DOS fdisk
&gt; and NT
&gt;         both report that my disk size is only a small fraction of the total
&gt; disk
&gt;         size.
&gt; 
&gt;         Does anybody know how I can get DOS fdisk to report the real
&gt; capacity of my
&gt;         disk and format it accordingly?
&gt; 
&gt;         Regards, Steve

Lea,
	I have installed RedHat 5.1 & 5.2 on machines running win95
and win98 and there were no problems for me on either and
Lilo will setup dual boot in mbr which can allow you to
either automatically boot into windoze or linux as well as
manually choose instead to open your alternative OS. Linux
install will however recognise win 95/98 as dos but it
doesn't seem to affect anything.  
The problem with NT apparently (accordoing to the HowTo) is
that NT wants to control the mbr and therefore conflicts
with Linux, this is not a problem with win95/98 as far as my
experience goes.
Gordon
