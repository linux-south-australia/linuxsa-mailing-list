As far as I know, unix in general doesn't support such things.
Instead of giving a password to a directory, you are supposed to use chown
and chmod to give directories owners and groups and relevant permissions to
each.
Eg. A directory /usr/local/stuff/fred would be owned by fred.users for
example. (man chown for nfo)
Then, the permissions could be rwx for fred, and rx for users, and none for
everyone else. (See man chmod for info on those.)
Thus, the user logged in as fred could cd into the directory and and read
and write files there.
Another user, who had been placed into the users group, could go into the
directory and only read files.
Everyone else couldn't go into the directory.
Hope this helps
Toby

    Subject: Directories with passwords


    Hi,
        I would like to know if there is a way to set directories so that
they need a password to be accessed.

    eg if I was in /usr/local/stuff and wanted to change into
/usr/local/stuff/fred

    I would type 'cd fred' and it would say "password:" and I then typed in
the password to access the directory??

    Please help, I run Redhat 5.2 kernel 2.0.36

    --Nige
