Steve, and other esteemed persons,

Is your query by any chance connected with the new 8c/MB transmitted
charge of Telstra?
According to

        <A HREF="http://www.telstra.net/btrfaqs.html">http://www.telstra.net/btrfaqs.html</A>

all transmitted bytes in any month over 2.75 times the received
bytes will be charged at 8c/MB, compared with the
current 19c/MB for received bytes.
E.g. If you're providing web pages on a home computer
attached (like mine in the very near future) to
bigpond direct, and if you receive nothing but just
let people grapb your pages all day at 33 kbit/sec, then
you get to pay

0.08 * 33000/8 * 3600 * 24 * 365.2425 / 1000000
 = $10413.794160 per year

If your link is used at only an average of 50% load, you get to
pay only about $5000/year.
But this is still quite large compared to the $240/year
which I was counting on paying.
Alteratively, this is $28.51 per day.
If I take a 1-week holiday of 9 days, I could lose $256.61 by
not noticing that people were reading my pages all that time.

[This price change coming in on 1 January 1999 was not
actually told to me by the sales people, by the way....]

Linux relevance:

Given that the firewall facilities on linux are quite good
(although I'll find out the details when I set it all up
in the next couple of days), there's an obvious pair of questions here:

Q1. Can the dollar rate and accumulated dollar cost of the
    link be monitored continuously as you mention.
    (And I had thought already myself of writing such a tool,
    just to save myself money.)

Q2. Can the traffic demand be moderated when the cost becomes excessive?

Question 1 is not that easy. You have to know whetehr each
packet is destined for overseas or not. Here's a quote from
the telstra web page:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
What is backchannel traffic?

Backchannel traffic is Internet traffic that is transmitted from the backbone
network of an ISP in Australia
to an Internet backbone network in another country.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

And ISP here includes all residential users of bogpond direct.
[The typo here was genuine. But I don't feel like correcting it....]
This raises another question:

Q3. How widespread is this? Does this cover _all_ ISPss in Australia?
    If so, I imagine all ISPs would be pretty quickly
    whipping out all the hosted web pages of their clients!

As to question 2, I've been doing research for some years on
moderating traffic demand in networks. So I pretty much know a
wide range of algorithms to apply here. And I've already written
software to solve the problem. It's a big step, though, to
bring out a "product". Now another question:

Q4. How many people out there are concerned about the
    new price regime? How many people would like to have
    good tariff monitoring and moderation software?

Q5. Has it been done already?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
