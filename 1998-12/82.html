Actually, like most e-mail propogated stories, it is a myth. From
<A HREF="http://www.nonprofit.net/hoax/hoax.html...">http://www.nonprofit.net/hoax/hoax.html...</A>

      "The cookie story (Mrs. Fields, Neimen Marcus, etc) is a myth.
      It has been circulating for at least 10 years in various
      forms. Please do not forward it."

There is also some good advice on this page about forwading e-mail.
Basically: Don't!

&gt;	I am just a little concerned (even though I liked seeing this yarn again)
&gt;that we get a mailing list like this bogged down in unrelated trivia, some
&gt;might consider this spam!
&gt;This is probably best left to friendly emails amongst friends rather than
&gt;to a mailing list :-)  for my 2c

Yes, i agree. It's also a little annoying for people who have seen it many
many times before. The Cookie Story is over 10 years old now. It even has
it's own Yahoo.com category. Unfortunatley we still get these things in our
e-mail boxes due to the concerns of well meaning, but non-the-less
uneducated Internet users. We should get them from mailing lists though.

I figured now would be a better time than ever to mention, that it goes
without saying that warnings about viruses, cookie recipes, charging for
e-mails, bill gates' e-mail tracing programme and and postcard/businesscard
collecting kids have no place on this mailing list.

If you are interested in this subject, you should have a look at
<A HREF="http://kumite.com/myths/myths/">http://kumite.com/myths/myths/</A> They have almost 200 different hoaxes listed!

Cheers

Alex!
