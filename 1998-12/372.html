<H1>dangers of redhat 4.0 -&gt; 5.2 upgrade</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
For several weeks now, I've been putting off upgrading one of
my home PCs from redhat 4.0 to redhat 5.2.
I'm very apprehensive about this.

A few months ago, my home sparc station /usr disk crashed and
I managed to salvage the files on it and copy them to another driver.
I then re-installed SunOS 4.1.3 over the copied /usr file system.
However, the re-installation over-wrote very many of my
basic configuraiton files (e.g. in /etc).

I'm very worried that if I upgrade from redhat 4.0 to redhat 5.2,
I'll clobber very many configuration files, and perhaps many other things
also. So here are my questions:

1.	Can anyone tell me if there is a serious 
	configuration-file-clobbering problem with such an upgrade?
	(In this case I would have to backup everything and
	put back the personalised config files one by one.)

2.	Do I really have to install via a re-boot from
	floppy disk, rahter than some program that runs while
	my redhat 4.0 software is running?
	(I expect the answer here may be that I _must_ re-boot
	from floppy disk, because the binaries are all going
	to get clobbered anyway.)

Would anyone recommend that I backup everything, then
reformat the disk, and then selectively put back the files that I want?
I hope very much that this is not the solution.
If this is what I must do, I'm in for a long, long re-setup of
the system.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
