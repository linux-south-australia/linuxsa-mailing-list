&gt; &gt;This reminds me of lots of people saying that every plane that's airborne
&gt; &gt;is going to fall from the sky on January 1. I mean why? Does the plane
&gt; &gt;think "Uh oh... jumbo jets haven't been invented yet, i'd better get my ass
&gt; &gt;back on the ground ASAP!" or what? And how about the pilots? Surely they
&gt; &gt;can just turn OFF the autopilot and control the things manually? :)
&gt;
&gt; Planes don't think. Not yet anyway. I think you kinda missed my point. I
&gt; gave the examples of hard coded firmware to make absolutely sure people
&gt; would distinguish my rant from the media hype.
&gt;
&gt; Hard coded firmware is where most of the problems with electronic systems
&gt; will be. I've heard people say that planes will start falling out of the
&gt; sky, but of course they wont. However, your jumbo jet comment has made me
&gt; realize that so many people really don't understand Y2K. Even people in the
&gt; computer industry. Y2K requires lateral thinking. You can't just say "If I
&gt; move my pawn to King Four, I'll take his Rook". You have to extrapolate the
&gt; results of one action and apply them to the next action. You move your pawn
&gt; and you may loose the game.
&gt;
&gt; An Aeroplane is a very technically complex thing and it has many many
&gt; "computers" on board. A computer isn't a Typewriter in front of a TV that
&gt; is sitting on a briefcase. It can be a ROM chip on a circuit board. What
&gt; does it do? Who wrote the code? Where are they now?
&gt;
&gt; Did they think as far ahead as 4 digit years, or just two?
&gt;
&gt; Will the component fail?
&gt;
&gt; The Challenger space shuttle fell out of the sky cause a little piece of
&gt; rubber got too cold. I'm not saying that this will happen. It will probably
&gt; be much less spectacular. The plane may simply not start up. So all you
&gt; have to do is refund a few tickets. Wouldn't be that expensive for the
&gt; airline, would it?
&gt;
&gt; Think about it a bit.

This could go on forwver (or until early 2000 anyway). Ever designed control
circuits? Most of them have only a time of day clock or a primitive calendar.
And anyway if my toaster stops I'll eat raw(?) bread.

I am concerned about the the GPS issue. I thought this was a triangulation deal.
What has the time of day got to do with it? Ah... or is the real problem in the
satellites, but the planes will have to compensate?

And if I remember the Airbus airshow crash, I think the deal is that the pilot
these days can only operate manually to the extent that the computer will let
him. A bit like having the teacher looking over your shoulder all the time.

I agree with those that think this is an overrated subject. I also believe that
there are thousands of professional and competent software and electrical
engineers who are applying the same care to this problem as they are to all the
other problems that could cause disasters.

I had to make my software 2000 proof 5 years ago, I have already sorted out the
GST bit (thanks to NZ experience), and I'm back at the real stuff in
applications.

At the end of the day my conclusion was that it isn't hard, rather boring.
Requiring painstaking, meticulous review of firstly data structures, then
calculations using the date components of the data structures, and finally the
collection and display of that data. - my I hope helpful contribution to this
debate. If you've got a better plan perhaps we could talk about that instead of
speculating on planes?

Rick
