&gt; SE Net do not allow CGI scripts, as far as I know -- not by customers,
&gt; and TAFE certainly do not allow individuals in their organisation
&gt; to provide them. And now I know why.

I wish most customers did ! Most ISPs I know of that like sleeping at
night either have custom inhouse written stuff for counters and forms for
customers to use or just plain do not give users cgi access.
Front Page is the worst of all such incarnations of cgi access - that
kludgy pile of crap by the Boys from Redmond will introduce more problems
that it is worth.

&gt; But on a Unix box, surely it must be possible to make all CGI scripts
&gt; run as user "nobody", or as the user who wrote the script,
&gt; and then the damage should be very much limited.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd bet that someone else out there knows the answers!....
&gt; 
&gt; I can't determine from the article whether the machine was
&gt; unix or windows based, but the reference to "directories" rather than
&gt; "folders" suggests that it was unix of some sort.
&gt; 
&gt; My question:
&gt; If you configure the server to run CGI scripts as "nobody"
&gt; (e.g. apache can be made to always run as "nobody"), then
&gt; isn't it true that no harm can be done to anything outside
&gt; world-writable areas?

There are lots of vunerabilities in all sorts of programs, you have to
keep in front of that wave in order to prevent this style of thing from
happening. For those interested do a web search on bugtraq and look
through some archives - makes for good reading.

&gt; In the article, they say that they didn't do backups because of
&gt; the overheads on a heavily loaded system.
&gt; Surely this must be invalid for a unix system  doing the standard
&gt; sort of total or diffe\rential backup.

I can "sort of" understand the lack of will to do backups for user data,
it comes down to economics. It is very hard to convince users they should
pay for web space - if you get no income for that service it is very hard
to justify the time and effort to run a properly monitored backup regime
(that being said we do back up all user data). Web pages used to be a
freebie in Australia now but with carriers looking at charging for data
sent as well as received (if in excess of quota) then web pages have a
REAL cost. 

For those that do not know Telstra are looking at charging 8c per Mb
outbound all all data in excess of a 2.75:1 out to in ratio. We have one
content site that does 20 gig per day out and about 2 gig in - the times
they are a changing !

Also if you have alot of popular user web sites on the one box then pure
IO bandwidth may get in your way (it would have to be one busy little box
though).
