For what it's worth, I work with many servers in commercial environments,
and there have been many times that I have swapped harddrives between
different types of SCSI controllers. 90% of this was done with NT4 machines,
and I never once had a problem that required a lowlevel format! I would not
expect to ever need to low-level-format a harddrive, under any circumstances
anyway.
Plus, I just wouldn't trust anything Microsoft say, just on principle.
I know you said you didn't want 'comments from just ordinary people who
don't have anything at risk', BUT I do commercially maintain servers,
working in a company, and so I and my company are at risk in not heeding
this MS Warning (tm). However, I don't know of anyone in the field who DOES
actually lowlevel format their harddrives on swapping host adaptors.
(Note: If you are dealing with RAID arrays of harddrives, running off a
proprietry controller (as opposed to a software implementation, like NT
striping or Linux raid filesystems), then I certainly would consider
low-level formatting the drives after switching to a different type of host
controller. HOwever, I would plug all the drives in and see if they do still
work first, and if so, run some good tests too.)

Subject: SCSI: Same Disk, Different Controllers ==&gt; Need Low-Level Format?


&gt;
&gt; This is a follow-up for a thread with
&gt; a different subject (long forgotten).
&gt;
&gt; In that thread, it was said that the
&gt; subj. combination could not be guar-
&gt; ranteed to provide safe or reliable
&gt; data access.
&gt;
&gt; Another correspondent replied with a
&gt; blanket "no problem" statement on the
&gt; question, but without citing a source
&gt;
&gt; Now, one of the sources, on which I had
&gt; based the earlier position (i.e. that
&gt; the combo *was* risky or worse), has
&gt; surfaced:
&gt;
&gt; From Win NT Server 4.0 Resource Guide
&gt; (p.78):
&gt;
&gt;   "SCSI disks should always be low-
&gt;    level formatted when put on a new
&gt;    controller.
&gt;
&gt;    The reason for this is that the
&gt;    translation in use on the disk
&gt;    varies from controller to con-
&gt;    troller, and can even vary be-
&gt;    tween two identical controllers
&gt;    based on the controllers settings."
&gt;
&gt; I seem to recall a similar warning in
&gt; a SCO Open Server Release 5 manual as
&gt; well (I have not yet re-stumbled upon
&gt; this ref.)...
&gt;
&gt; Is there any more "citable" info avail-
&gt; able; off-the-cuff opinions aren't worth
&gt; taking commercial risks for IMHO, and
&gt; I'm sure the matter has been taken up
&gt; earlier by vendors whose reputations
&gt; are on-the-line more substantially
&gt; than people who posit in LINUX SA  ;)
&gt;
&gt; Add'l ref's to reliable sources would
&gt; be of interest.
