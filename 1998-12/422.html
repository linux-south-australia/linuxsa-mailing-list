Hi all,

Just thought you would find this interesting.
The original email was from an IT News email group and
was forwarded to me by an IT Admin who is responsible
for 2500 Windows machine network. (Rather him than me.)
He sent this to me so I could protect the Linux machines
I am responsible for. Read my response to him at the
bottom. :)


&gt; MCI WORLDCOM ATTACHED BY NEW VIRUS
&gt; 
&gt; A new computer virus, dubbed "Remote Explorer," attacked the 
&gt; systems of telecommunications giant MCI WorldCom earlier today.
&gt; 
&gt; The virus, which affects Windows NT networks, was detected 
&gt; early and MCI WorldCom says there was no damage to client data. 
&gt; Network Associates (NAI), formerly McAfee Associates, helped 
&gt; contain the virus and prevent extensive damage to sensitive data 
&gt; files.
&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft is working with NAI to deal with the virus which attacks 
&gt; WinNT systems running Intel chips in the Administrator mode.
&gt; 
&gt; The Remote Explorer virus compresses program files so they can't 
&gt; be executed and it encrypts data files so they are worthless to 
&gt; network users.
&gt; 
&gt; NAI expects to post a "detector" for the virus on its Web site 
&gt; within hours, and a "cleaner" to combat the virus will be posted 
&gt; later today. 
&gt; 
&gt; Dave Murphy, founder of ITrain,  said that this virus is a serious threat.
&gt; 
&gt; Because it affects both executable and data files, it could 
&gt; potentially cripple an entire network system, and therefore, an 
&gt; entire enterprise.
&gt; 
&gt; Although the virus appears to attack only WinNT systems, it can 
&gt; be transported on any machine, including those running Win95, 
&gt; Win98, Netware, Unix, and the up-and-coming operating system, 
&gt; Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Dave Murphy continues to recommend NAI's VirusScan and it's 
&gt; monthly updates to all computer users. This goes double for 
&gt; network administrators.

---------------------------------

Just another reason to get rid of Windows 9x/NT from
all systems that are of any value of any kind. And if
it isn't of any value of any kind then how can you justify
paying money to run Windows on it!

&gt; Although the virus appears to attack only WinNT systems, it can 
&gt; be transported on any machine, including those running Win95, 
&gt; Win98, Netware, Unix, and the up-and-coming operating system, 
&gt; Linux.

I like this bit, what it says is that any OS can transmit the
virus. Well for that matter so can anything that has any form of
network or storage ability. My 1.44MB floppy disk is just as
capable as "the up-and-coming operating system, Linux". :)

Unfortunately some people may read more into this than what it
says and come to the conclusion that people running systems
other than windows should be careful.

The simple fact is that due to the memory and disk security
inherent in 'Unix' virus are unable to propagate and damage
a system in the same way they can in windows. It is theoretically
possible for a virus to damage a 'Unix' system but it would
require an incompetent system admin who would have to execute
the virus as root. The rule of thumb is don't execute any code
as root unless you trust the vendor/source.

(Ok this is a simplified view of the world but I do actually
have to do some work occasionally instead of just email.)

Just my $0.02
Nick Stock
