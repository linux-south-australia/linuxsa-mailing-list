Seems like it.
&gt; 
&gt; If I do a 'startx 2&gt; x.log', then quit and look at the file, I see it
&gt; defaults to 8bpp. In my XF86Config file, I have 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp and
&gt; 32bpp all defined to use 1024x768. I commented out all the modelines
&gt; that are out of my monitors capabilities, so when I looked at x.log,
&gt; there were no errors, yet when I do a ctrl alt + , it doesn't seem to
&gt; actually change. If I add another mode in the 8bpp section, such as
&gt; 1280x1024, the ctrl alt + works and the resolution changed. oh, looking
&gt; at the XFree86 docs, 32bpp does not seem to be supported for Riva chips.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, does ctrl alt + cycle through colour depths as well as
&gt; resolutions? If so, any idea why I don't seem to be able to get out of
&gt; 8bpp? if not (or either way), how do I make it default to 16bpp instead?
Nope, afaik it only does resolutions. Try removing 8 bpp and 16 bpp from
your config files.
&gt; 
&gt; sorry if it's an easy thing to solve, it's probably as easy as getting
&gt; gnome to load (rather than AfterStep), which I havn't managed to do yet
&gt; either *grin*
I found KDE easier to install, but neither of the sides in this holy war
are especially "easy" to install. 

Good luck,
