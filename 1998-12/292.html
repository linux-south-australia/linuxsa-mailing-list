&gt;So how does one do this if they don't have access to procmail, or any
&gt;other filtering software?

What e-mail programmes are there now that don't filter? What platform are
you using? I'm sure there'd be many people out there willing to put in a
good word for their favorite OS/e-mail combination.

That reminds me, being a pine user who now uses X, is there anything anyone
would recommend in the X mail programme department?

&gt;_This_ is the reason linuxsa is almost the only
&gt;mailing list I subscribe to that dosn't provide [LIST] prefixes on its
&gt;email.

Yes, but for the other 99.7% of people on this list who _do_ filter
successfully, we have no need to see a whole box full of mail, where each
mail has the same [WHATEVER] header.

&gt;Suggestion, what's wrong with  [LSA]?

Nothing as such, EXCEPT, filtering works fine with to: and cc: so is just
not really nessecary. See the David Newall rule for more info.  :o)

Cheers

Alex!

P.S. Is this the second or third header disscussion we've had on this list?
Might be an idea, if this gets resolved, to have a section on the web site
for an explanation of the adopted method   :o)
