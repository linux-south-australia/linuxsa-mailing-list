G'day SBS,

&gt; Wonderful...  I suppose - from one angle - it is good that you are
&gt; achieving your business goals...

It was more a personal goal (writing the book) than a business goal. But I've
been very pleased from a business point of view to have sales far beyond the
anticipated hundred or so. It was and is NOT the only computer we use or
support.  Why would I be on the LinuxSA list if that were the case?  


&gt; But from the point of view of helping build an IT capable community...

I was only mentioning this in relationship to those who have Linux systems and
friends/relies who want inexpensive access to Internet features like Email and
such. It was in response to a fellow list members asking about systems his Mum
could use to keep up with sending Email to family members.

It can also be useful in-house as an additional terminal - plugged in via a
null modem to the Linux box, it's handy if someone else in the house wants to
bang on the keys using console programs when you're using the main computer. 

&gt; Worse for hardware... (unless there is an external modem for C-xx[x]'s that
&gt; would work via RS-232 serial ports)

We've been using 56k modems in the C= arena since 56k became available.  I
think you're answering this from the assumption that nothing has changed in the
Commodore arena in the last several years, and this simply isn't the case at
all. In fact, the Internet has had an extremely positive impact.  

&gt; Considering the price of repairs 

Repairs?  Heck no.  It's easier to recommend someone find someone giving one
away. If you want to do repairs though, it's easy enough to find the
information required on the net or to find a repair company through the
comp.sys.cbm vendor list.  

&gt; (which - I presume - may be another of the side-lines that helps you achieve
&gt; your business goals), 

We do not repair any computers. Our primary business is VCR and Camcorder
repair.  Our secondary is Web hosting and design.  Our personal enjoyment of the
Commodore is personal.  The book was something extra, and not a planned business
goal.  

&gt; slowness of floppy-drives 

No argument there in relation to OLD 1541/71 drives, but there are better
alternatives.  

&gt; (Is there a hard drive for C-xx[x]'s?), etc. - all

Yes, and a Ram device that's battery backed (not an expansion unit but more
a Hard drive in ram) which I prefer. And accelerators as well. 

&gt; make me conclude that you're helping to create a Computer Underclass...

huh?   That 'underclass' has existed for years.  It just won't go away. I sure
didn't help in it's creation at all. It existed long before I had one or
started writing about using them. Just as I would defend anyone choosing (on
their own) to use Linux, I would too with the Commodore. 

&gt; I don't speak for any other Linux SA people, but I'd guess that some of
&gt; them might consider what you're doing not unlike what Microsoft is doing...
&gt; i.e. helping to lock people into systems that have hidden costs and less than
&gt; optimal performance (*far* less, in the case of 8-bit Commodore technolog

If you want to make assumptions like this, go ahead.  
It is an untrue (and unfair) assumption though.  


&gt; At least, use of the heavy-weight Microsoft products yield presentable
&gt; documents that *their* customers can make money with... e.g. resumes for job-
&gt; hunting, newsletters/books, computer programs, etc.

This is also a very untrue assumption on your part. I should mail you a copy of
the post script printed newsletter I rec'd this week. You'd be VERY surprised. 
I am quite willing to post it to you if you like. 

&gt; I believe that it is morally wrong to lead people down a dead-end road in
&gt; IT.

All I did was say that Mum could use a Commodore to read Email.  
I'm going to hell for that???   

 
&gt;   - are slow, unreliable, costly to repair,

Assumption.

&gt;   - have spares only available from used throw-aways,

See <A HREF="http://www.cmdweb.com">http://www.cmdweb.com</A> for ongoing repairs and such there are other places
as well. 

&gt;   - can possibly affect users' vision, if TV used as display,

I don't suggest anyone use a TV as a display.  Monitor's are almost as
available as the machines are.

&gt;   - preclude access to video high-fidelity audio (e.g. RealAudio) from the
&gt; Internet,

That's a personal requirement.  

&gt;   - don't seem to have much new software being developed for them these
&gt; days,

This is a major assumption and untrue.   

&gt;   - absorb users' excess cash without any chance of helping them
&gt; participate in the
&gt;     CREATIVE sides of the Internet (how many C-xx[x]-ers have web pages,
&gt; write
&gt;     programs, host webs, etc.)

LOL....  there are hundreds out there with web pages. A few less programs but
those that are new this year are fairly major developments (after all, we've
had fax and word processors and such for ions so these days development is
more along the lines pushing the envelope a bit further -something many enjoy
doing).  

You can start at <A HREF="http://videocam.net.au/gaelyne/links.html">http://videocam.net.au/gaelyne/links.html</A> if you like.
Notice that the URL is off my own personal directory, not off our business
directory. It's a personal thing, not a business thing.   

We've had more programming developments BECAUSE of Internet access and the
ability to quickly communicate with people than we did in the past. 

&gt;   - (as a result) do not help users to develop a taste for "value for
&gt; money"

Many of these people are retired.  Spending $20US on a book that helps them use
a Freenet (in the US) with equipment they already own is considered value for
money. 
 
&gt; As I found out (from replies to an earlier posting), shell accounts are
&gt; *also*
&gt; getting as scarce as hen's teeth... (although there is hope - for those who
&gt; want (e.g. HappyHackers) or, apparently, need (i.e. C-xx[x] internet users)
&gt; them - e.g. from a *few* Public Access systems in the APANA network...)
&gt; 
&gt; I presume you run an ISP for your "congregation"... good for business... 
&gt; ;)

Well, we don't yet. 


&gt;&gt; to enhance the types of items that can be printed.
&gt;        ------------
&gt; Not "enable"...?

No, because PS printing has been available for many years now.  

&gt; Anyway, have a nice holiday!  ;)

Ditto.  

I think you really mis-interpreted my original message though. 


Cheers,
Gaelyne
