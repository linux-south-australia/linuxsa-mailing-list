&gt;I was just wondering if any one had done the obiouios,
&gt;Setting your computer clock forward to a few min untill the year 2000 and
&gt;waiting for it to click over, then run it for the next week looking for new
&gt;problems

This nessecaryily test for rollover because tehre is more than one clock on
your PC. Unfortunately, it's not a simple as that although you'll get a
better picture after a few days and a few loings and logouts and reboots.
Find out which clocks are 1900, which are 1980 and which are 2000.

But here is the point that mosty people miss. SO WHAT! Seriously, I have
people ask me all the time, "is my PC Y2K compliant? I'm worried". The
answer is, "So what if it isn't?", just reset the date, buy a new bit of
hardware, get a new software update. You word files might need the dates
reset, but at least no-one gets killed. This is the media hype at work.

But you don't have to be killed to be afftected by Y2K problems.

What you REALLY want to know is, will your video still record programmes on
timer? If you can, by just fooling it into a date that is wrong, will G
code still work? Will your answering machine still work? Will your
airtraffic control system still work? Will your burglar alarm work?

Heaps of systems have hard coded ROM software that can't deal with dates
starting with 20. They are the problem. Non-essential computer systems
really don't matter. Mind you, if a banking computer had a problem, imagine
the 100 years of interest that will get paid on 01/01/00. Nice.

The burglar alarm example. Will it go off at midnight when it realises it
hasn't been looked at for 100 years? Will you get a callout fee? Will there
be so many callouts after midnight on 01/01/2000 that the security
companies don't bother going out to them all? If you're a burglar, why not
put in a few hours on January 1? Maybe he'll come and steal your Y2K
compliant video and PC!

It's a big problem, but it's also the perfect platform for media hype.

Watch with interest.

Cheers

Alex!
