Hi,

I did an FTP install over my LAN to install Linux on this machine. The first
time I tried installing, I continuously got errors. Not the type you got (I
think), but many, many file not found and file is corrupted and often the
rpm would install but then tell me that the script failed. Since I had
downloaded every single rpm, I knew something was wrong. I tried a different
FTP server on the win95 machine, and everything went perfectly. I don't know
which server didn't work and which one worked, but all I can suggest is to
try a different ftp server.

hope this helps,
Andy

Subject: Red Hat 5.2 Sparc install failing


&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I got hold of the 5.2 variety pack the other day, and have been
&gt;able to reboot my IPC from the install floppy images.  I've then
&gt;tried to get a FTP install working.  The CD is on a Win95 box
&gt;running WARFTPD.
&gt;
&gt;The install seems to be working to a point - there is a fair bit
&gt;of initial ethernet action as it FTPs across one of the config
&gt;files (sorry, couldn't write the name down that fast), then the
&gt;file systems get set up and formatted, and then the serious FTP
&gt;downloading starts, and I get a failure 11.
&gt;
&gt;I'll try it again tomorrow and get more details, but at this
&gt;point I was wondering if anyone had got this setup to work?  I
&gt;saw some other newsgroup messages suggesting similar problems,
&gt;but the only responses were "was it plugged in" and "did you
&gt;give the right IP address" and so forth.
&gt;
&gt;The problem looked a little like the might be problems with
&gt;filename munging or some such, but util I write down the full
&gt;details I won't be sure.
&gt;
&gt;Any thoghts appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, Dieter.
