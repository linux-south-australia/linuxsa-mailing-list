&gt;Does anyone know a solution to this problem?

The best solution is a good relationship with your upstream provider.
I include the following message recently posted to server-linux, and
excellent list for those administrating (multiple) Linux server boxes:

&gt; How do I defense against Smurf attacks?  My Linux servers are
&gt; pretty well protected, but the attack went to my gateway router,
&gt; which is a lowly Cisco 2501.
&gt;
&gt; Appreciate any suggestions/comments.

This happened to us as well.  Actually, the attack on us included more
than just Smurf, it was a variety of things including other UDP and
ICMP.

Unfortunately, it probably is not good enough for you to put a filter on
your router, which is simple enough to do using Cisco access lists.  For
example,

conf term
int s1.1
no ip access-group 113 in
no access-list 113
permit udp any eq domain any
permit udp any any eq domain
deny   udp any any
deny   icmp any any
permit ip any any
int s1.1
ip access-group 113 in

Then use the

clear access-list counters
show access-list

commands to see how many matches are taking place on each rule.

The above access list will block all ICMP access and all UDP access
except for DNS.  This may block services you want, so you may have to
modify the access list for your site.  Don't leave the list in
permanently, only as long as the attack persists.

NOTE that you must be careful when playing with access lists on a live
router, since if you blow a command, or if you do things in the wrong
sequence, you can render your router unreachable for further corrective
action.  It is a great idea to do this sort of work over the serial
terminal port rather than telnet.  To simplify installation, I usually
keep the commands I want to paste in up on one xterm and then do a mouse
cut-and-paste into the xterm with the connection to the Cisco.

However, the above filter probably won't solve your problem.  The only
real defense seems to be to have your upstream provider put the filter
in for you, since if the attack is severe, by the time the packets get
to your router it is too late--your router will be flooded trying to
filter them!   We had to put the filter in upstream of us during our
attack.

You will have to leave the filter in until it looks like the attack is
no longer going on, and then remove it and hope that the attack is done
and doesn't come back.

Unfortunately our upstream provider UUNet was not able to trace the
source of the attack.
