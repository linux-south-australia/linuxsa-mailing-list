Mark,

You've just blown away my good intentions to not 
write any more mail to linuxsa on this topic.

This might be a real bug in the ppp driver!

The fact that modems do so little buffering, which I'm sure
you're right about, and the fact that with big
throughputs (file transfers, as opposed to pinging) I get
the same dealying behaviour point to the modem being 
innocent. It's obviously the "ppp" driver not putting
packets into the RX queue for the kernel IP code.
The ppp driver must be accumulating the RX packets
for some reason -- or maybe it's not inserting them in
the RX queue correctly.
This is fascinating, because it relates to my work
on a "packet ferret driver".

This is something that _does_ deserve an examination of the
"ppp" driver code, which I will now have to do.
Just for reference, the ppp version is
ppp-2.3.5 and the kernel is 2.0.36.
The hardware is an AMD 486DX2-66.
The card is on an EISA slot.
The rpms are:
ppn-2.3.5-1.src.rpm
kernel-2.0.36-0.7.src.rpm

Something in this combination is probably causing the
problem. Maybe the prime reason why I get the problem
and no one else does is the use of an old CPU.
But the driver _should_ cope with that.

This could take me weeks to do.
I'll let you know what I find.
It will be a good exercise in reading driver code.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
