&gt; &gt; After only 4 days
&gt;
&gt; 4 days? that could have something to do with it too.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; of installing Redhat 5.2 (from the Linux pocketbook) I
&gt; &gt; have managed to crash it.

&gt; &gt; Well then I went to kill the process. At this point everything
&gt; &gt; froze. The three fingered salute didn't work (Ctrl-alt-del).
&gt;
&gt; left ctrl-alt
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I went for
&gt; &gt; the reset button.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; always a good idea to wait 30 seconds for a sync (things aren't usually
&gt; completely frozen)
&gt;
&gt;

It probably was about half that.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At reboot the computer would not even get past the first intro screen
&gt; &gt; (the one where you can enter the bios).
&gt;
&gt; which means there is probably a dodgy bit of hardware which is why
&gt; everything froze

Yes, I was about to get my screwdriver out at that point. As far as I've read,
the Tseng et4000/w32 p rev d should be fine for linux? Xconfigurator chose the
svga driver rather than the et4000/w32 when I installed it - is this right?

&gt; Out came the trusty Linux pocketbook and I decided to
&gt; &gt; run something called e2fsck (equivalent of scandisk with prompts, I
&gt; &gt; imagine?). Answered yes to all its (many) questions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; scandisk is a pale imitation of fsck et al. while we're on fsck **** NEVER
&gt; **** interrupt it with a reboot you may do irrepairable damage.
&gt; Unfortunately answering yes is about all you can do most of the time.
&gt;
&gt; On reboot everything seemed to go smoothly. Now, logged in as root, x
&gt;
&gt; &gt; windows would not start. I imagine that I lost some (important) files. I
&gt; &gt; have a boot disk, and can easily make a rescue disk from the image on
&gt; &gt; the cd. Is there a way to restore these files or settings or whatever
&gt; &gt; without re-installing?
&gt;
&gt; probably reinstalling the x application package is the best thing to do as
&gt; you probably have lost an important file. Even a full install should only
&gt; take an hour max. Which brings me back to the first question.... why 4
&gt; days? part of the answer may lie there.
&gt;

Ok, I'll try the x package first, and if no other programs spit the dummy that
they can't find some files I should be fine.Well, a little more than 4 days ago
I first bought the Linux pocketbook. Then for a few days after that I was
making space on my inadequately small hard drive for it. And it was 4 days ago
that I actually got to installing it for the first time on my system.

Also, there was another problem before that one. I made an account called tom.
Now, tom couldn't load xwindows, but root could. With tom's it stopped at a
grey screen with an x in the middle for the cursor position. That one's a
complete mystery to me. Once again is it anything to do with the video card?
