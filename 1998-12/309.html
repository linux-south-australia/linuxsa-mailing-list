I think you will find that the actual speed of the drive is irrelevant...
Ie. You could install linux with a 0.5x speed CD drive if you wanted to wait
long enough, or on a 512x CD drive for that matter. Or a DVD drive with CD
compatibility.
What _IS_ important though is the quality of the drive. In my experience,
for instance, I've learnt to trust Panasonic CDROM drives, and to avoid
Mitsumi drives. YMMV, but Panasonic and Sony seem to produce drives that
work faster (even at the same rated speed!), and work with a wider range of
CDs and burnt CDs. I have a Acer 32x here that refuses to read all the CDs
you put into it, but a Sony 16x I have and a Panasonic 24x and scsi 4x work
fine. Creative drives seem to vary from good to bad, depending who their
drive is based on.
My reccommendations are the 32x panasonic IDE or SCSI.

Subject: CDROM drive compatibility


&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I am putting together a new Pentium 11 system and need some help please
&gt;on CDROM compatibilty.
&gt;
&gt;The Linux hardware compatibility guide indicates that almost any x2, x4
&gt;and x6 speed ATAPI/IDE CDROM drives should work. However, given the
&gt;unavailibilty of new drives in that range just how far can I push the
&gt;compatibility envelope e.g.,would a x24 or x32 speed work with my Redhat
&gt;5.1 running the 2.0.35-1 kernel. My existing box with a x8 Mitsumi works
&gt;OK and this is outside the stated speed compatibility range???
&gt;
&gt;Experienced users would no doubt be able to explain to me why
&gt;compatibility seems to be nominally stuck at x6. Is it a complex issue
&gt;to produce code to support faster drives that are now on the market.?
&gt;
&gt;Given the above what new drives could I consider for compatiblity with
&gt;my new box?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you.
&gt;
&gt;Brenton.
