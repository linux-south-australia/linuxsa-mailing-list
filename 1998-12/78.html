&gt; --  the APC linux pocketbook...
&gt;
&gt; In the first 10 seconds, my reaction was that I was disappointed
&gt; by the small size of this booklet.
&gt; But then it occurred to me that it is precisely what is needed for
&gt; the beginner, who has proably some idea of how to usewind95/98/nt.
&gt;
&gt; Not everyone wants a 600-page manual filled with detail.
&gt; Most people would really prefer to just be told how to
&gt; set it up, how to use it, and how to configure it, and later
&gt; they'll get into it.
&gt; It's a perfect "getting started" book for people who are
&gt; not linux experts, and who do not wish to feel 3 months of
&gt; pain before they get the thing going.
&gt;
&gt; Conclusion of conclusion:
&gt; I recommend this for people who want to try linux
&gt; for the first time. It should take a lot of pain out of the
&gt; experience.
&gt;

Alan I heartily agree.  I started looking at Linux after the Apcmag article of some
months ago.  I purchased RedHat 5.1 and have spent the rest of the time trying to
work things out.  I have purchased some of those "600 page" books ie QUE: Using
Linux; Linux Unleashed 3rd ed.; A Practical Guide to Linux, Mark Sobell;  SAMS: Linux
in 24 hrs and even O'Reilly: Linux in a Nutshell.  However despite the quality of
information given by these books none of them have been as practical nor encouraging
as the Apcmag Pocketbook.  It wont replace the aforementioned tomes but it is an
encouraging introduction that produces results and is worthwhile as an evangelistic
tool in drawing others into the Linux using community. Bravo Apc
Gordon
