&gt; Anyways, I was thinking of writing a crontab script to run every hour
&gt; and check to see if ppp is up, and if not, then bring it up again. Now I
&gt; know that that isn't scrictly forcing it up, but the server being
&gt; disconnected for a maximum of an hour is better than the 4 or 5 days it
&gt; currently is when the server is running unattended, which is more of a
&gt; problem in the holidays than any time else.

A better solution would be to use init. You can add a line to /etc/inittab
to have pppd respawn whenever it dies. I'd suggest you wrap it up so it
doesn't continually try to dial if it can't get through or keeps dropping
out. I'll forward you a script that does that. 

&gt; My question is about the format of the cron scripts. I've never actually
&gt; written a script (except the ppp scripts) under Linux, so I just need
&gt; some pointers about how to structure the scripts and the commands and
&gt; things. Is there any documention on cron? I don't have the linux box in
&gt; front of me at the moment, so I appologise if there is info in the man
&gt; pages...

man crontab 5 crontab

Mark
