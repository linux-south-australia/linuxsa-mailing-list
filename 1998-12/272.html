Hi Steve,

[snip]...

&gt;However when I got the machine home I tried to boot NT. I got the initial
&gt;welcome screen, allowed NT to boot through to the blue screen, where I got
&gt;the dreaded "blue screen of death" with the message
&gt;inaccessible_boot_device. 
&gt;
&gt;Does anybody know what I should do next? I think LILO has overwritten some
&gt;files in the MBR that NT requires, but I'm only guessing.

Your guess may be right, in which case you will need to boot NT from
floppy or CDROM installation disk and rewrite the MBR.  Someone who
knows NT better than I should confirm (or correct this): use the
MS fdisk program as follows "fdisk /mbr".

However, one thing that is worth a try before doing the above is to
run the Linux fdisk and make sure that the boot flag appears next to 
the NT partition.  I suggest this because when I set up my machine
for dual boot Win3.1/Linux, MS would not play the game without the
boot flag.  Furthermore, as your initial welcome screen comes up, this
suggests that the MBR is intact but something else is wrong (ie the
inaccessible_boot_device); perhaps the boot flag is all that is
required to make it accessible.

Good Luck,
