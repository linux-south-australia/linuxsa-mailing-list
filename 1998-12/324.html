I think most of the people suffering from problems that cant _easily_ be
addressed are using MS clients - I have a difficult time trying to get
Outboard98 to filter mail properly (something I've done on Unix clients for
years with no serious problems) - seems like it has trouble grokking display
name vs address, as best I can figure, and the display name will differ
according to what each sender has the list aliased as ...

One way to solve the 'problem' is changing the way the list addresses mail
as it is processed (which probably varies in capability according to the
list software), so that either the sender or recipient are always a fixed
format, eg I never have problems with the debian lists, they always rewrite
the addressing to a fixed format. Of course there's always the option of
_not_ running an MS client, something not all of us have absolute choice
over given our email provider and work requirements (unfortunately).

A digest would be nice also, sifting 3-400 messages a day with a poor client
like 'Outboard98' is painful ;-)

&gt; &gt;In the meantime I've tried the various suggestions (ie. 
&gt; filtering by cc and
&gt; &gt;to, and even checking the last three lines in the message's body) but
&gt; &gt;neither Eudora Pro nor Outlook Express work 100%. I still 
&gt; get some messages
&gt; &gt;coming through to my Inbox.
&gt; 
&gt; Eudora Pro:
&gt; 
&gt; - Click on the 'Tools' menu and select 'Filters'.
&gt; - Click 'New' and check the 'Incoming' and 'Manual' boxes.
&gt; - From the 'Header' drop down list, list select 'Any Header:'
&gt; - Underneath this, ensure 'contains' is selected and to the right of
&gt;     this enter the text '<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>'
&gt; - Underneath this, select 'or' from the drop down list.
&gt; - Underneath this, ensure 'contains' is selected and to the right of
&gt;     this enter the text '<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@Elizabeth.netcraft.com.au">linuxsa@Elizabeth.netcraft.com.au</A>'
&gt; - Select 'Transfer To' from the first 'Action' drop down box and click
&gt;     on the destination button immediately to the right of this
&gt; - Select a mailbox from the list, or create a new one.
&gt; - Close the filters window and answer 'Yes' to the 'Save Changes?'
&gt;     dialogue box.
&gt; 
&gt; This has worked for me since the list started. Of course I 
&gt; use pine now :o)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Now, I receive a large quantity of mail daily and it is not 
&gt; easy to filter
&gt; &gt;all messages by hand.
&gt; 
&gt; My record is this...
&gt; 
&gt; 	Downloading message 1 of 15336
&gt; 
&gt; 47 Meg worth. text only, no attachments. That was on Eudora. 
&gt; Filtered like
&gt; a dream.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;To all those that gave constructive criticism. Thank you. 
&gt; You have given me
&gt; &gt;some great ideas, and it has improved my filtering quite a bit.
&gt; 
&gt; Flitering is something you perfect slowly. If a mail gets 
&gt; through a hole
&gt; you can modify your filters to compensate. You'll notice with 
&gt; the above
&gt; example I included elizabth.netcraft.com.au as well, as I had 
&gt; a few slip
&gt; through once, but I think it was a fault that has since been recified.
&gt; Still, no harm in keeping it there.
&gt; 
&gt; Have fun with your filters!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Alex!
