&gt; Well, it seems that we have two camps here. Some agree with me and the other
&gt; mailing lists that we might be a little better off with an identifier in the
&gt; header, and others are vehemently against it.

Is anyone else amused by this transparent attempt to gain credibility by the
implied claim that "most other people do it that way, too."  Might I paraphrase
the above: "Well, it seems that we have two camps here.  Some agree with me,
and others agree with the other mailing lists that are vehemently against it."

Amusement aside, here is the truth behind the proposal:

&gt; The main problem is this: I have Outlook Express, because I can't get PPP
&gt; going via Linux.

Using Microsoft limitations to justify a change to a Unix mailing list seems
a little like giving drunkedness as an excuse at an AA meeting.  Yes, some of
us still do Microsoft, but truly it's an unfriendly operating system and I
refuse to degrade my Unix environments in a gratuitous exercise to pander to
Windows.  The real solution to this problem will be evident if the following
command works:

   del c:\*.* /s

I recommend you do try this.

David
