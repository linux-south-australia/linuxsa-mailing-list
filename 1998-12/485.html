&gt; Subject: One man's treasure
&gt; Date: Wednesday, 23 December 1998 19:03
&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of computers and Linux use, I just wouldn't be myself if I
&gt; didn't mention that cheap Commodore C64's and C128's go well with Linux
(and
&gt; other *nix flavours).  
&gt; 
&gt; Pine, Elm, Pico, Tin, Lynx, Emacs, Vi, telnet, ftp etc are all utilities
&gt; can be used by a C64 or C128 connected to the system, and for some
people, this
&gt; does the job for them when it comes to Internet access. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have a mail list with 140 subscribers for TIFCU (The Internet for
Commodore
&gt; Users) and my book (same title) has sold enough copies for us 1) to
afford our
&gt; Internet connection, and 2) &lt;grumble&gt; to pay taxes on the income earned. 

Wonderful...  I suppose - from one angle - it is good that you are
achieving your
business goals...

But from the point of view of helping build an IT capable community...

I really don't see being locked-in to a C-64 or (the
ever-so-slightly-better equipped)
C-128 helping your customers to achieve theirs.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but...

Any software they get goes no where else... (granted that C-64 s/w might
go on a C-128... but is that anywhere else?)

Worse for hardware... (unless there is an external modem for C-xx[x]'s that
would work via RS-232 serial ports)

For H/W, compare to PCI expansion cards which - with a change of driver
S/W - can sometimes go from a IBM-compat. PC to a Mac.

Considering the price of repairs (which - I presume - may be another of the
side-lines that helps you achieve your business goals), slowness of floppy-
drives (Is there a hard drive for C-xx[x]'s?), etc. - all up - make me
conclude
that you're helping to create a Computer Underclass...

I don't speak for any other Linux SA people, but I'd guess that some of
them
might consider what you're doing not unlike what Microsoft is doing... i.e.
helping to lock people into systems that have hidden costs and less than
optimal performance (*far* less, in the case of 8-bit Commodore technology)

At least, use of the heavy-weight Microsoft products yield presentable
docu-
ments that *their* customers can make money with... e.g. resumes for job-
hunting, newsletters/books, computer programs, etc.

For all its "bloat" I'd have to say that the MS choice empowers its
users...
giving those who put their minds to it the opportunity to increase their
wealth
so that they can (later) afford Multi-CPU, 256 Mb RAM, 23 Gb Hard Drives...

I believe that it is morally wrong to lead people down a dead-end road in
IT.

And, unfortunately, I equate C-xx[x]'s with such a dead-end.

&gt; I know for many who want graphical web browsers and such it wouldn't be
the
&gt; right system for them, but I also know (from a few hundred customers)
that it's
&gt; the perfect match for other people.   

I hope you're wrong here...  While I see the point you're making - not
unlike:

  People choose a dog that matches their personality  (I want a Golden,
myself)

But to equate your clients with C-xx[x], saying that it is the perfect
match for them,
I think I would feel really *insulted* were I to be likened to computers
which:

  - are slow, unreliable, costly to repair,
  - have spares only available from used throw-aways,
  - can possibly affect users' vision, if TV used as display,
  - preclude access to video high-fidelity audio (e.g. RealAudio) from the
Internet,
  - don't seem to have much new software being developed for them these
days,
  - absorb users' excess cash without any chance of helping them
participate in the
    CREATIVE sides of the Internet (how many C-xx[x]-ers have web pages,
write
    programs, host webs, etc.)
  - (as a result) do not help users to develop a taste for "value for
money"

&gt; We're hosting another mail list for C= users who are using postscript
printers

As a matter of curiosity, how many such users are known to exist
(worldwide,
in Australia and/or locally)?

&gt; we've been investigating ways to use shell accounts

As I found out (from replies to an earlier posting), shell accounts are
*also*
getting as scarce as hen's teeth... (although there is hope - for those who
want (e.g. HappyHackers) or, apparently, need (i.e. C-xx[x] internet users)
them - e.g. from a *few* Public Access systems in the APANA network...)

I presume you run an ISP for your "congregation"... good for business... 
;)

&gt; to enhance the types of items that can be printed.
       ------------
Not "enable"...?

&gt; Anyway, if you're interested in low-tech (and inexpensive) Internet
options,
&gt; this is another option.   

I'm interested in building a community in which people choose options which
give better "value-for-money"... not just (apparently) "cheap" options that
cost
them much of value later.
 
Anyone who watches the "price-tumbles" of PC computers and seeks value-
for-EVEN-LESS-money will choose a 386 or better i.e. if money is a problem
for them and IMHO be making a much better decision for themselves, their
children and the larger community.

Now, I grant you this:  If somebody's parent[s] squanders the family income
at the pokies, leaving very little for tech'y toys, etc. then - in such a
case,
there *might* be an excuse to go back to the dark ages of 8-bit C-xx[x]'s.

In *such* a family (which has demonstrated its ignorance of value-for-money
by losing $ at the pokies), it would be quite consistent with handing down
a tradition from one generation to the next; no less foolish, but
consistent.

Your posting reminds me that SA *really* needs "Value-for-Money Training"

Anyway, have a nice holiday!  ;)
