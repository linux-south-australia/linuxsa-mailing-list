&gt;No elm, no perl (it's a hacking tool remember :), I rather expect that

Perl only does what can less easily be done using sed, awk, cut and
grep -- ie. this is a rather short-sighted view if you have any of these
other binaries.  If you _don't_, then the below will be quite difficult.

&gt;Anyone know how it might be done in bourne shell?  I do have access to
&gt;that (and I am allowed scripts provided they don't come from rootshell :).

Do you get agrep?  That allows you to grep chunks instead of lines.
I expect you don't get formail (which is part of procmail, I think?),
which would be really helpful.  A shell script of the form:
	# we pipe seperate messages to this script from our .forward, so
	# it only every expects to receive one email message
	(paraphrasing here)
	write line to temporary file (ie. &gt;&gt; /tmp/newmail.$$)
		if line is one of the headers we like to check (eg. set in a
		config file or in this script) then check it.

		if it is a blank line, that's the end of the headers,
		so stop checking.  Write the rest of the file out,
		and do whatever action you decided from the above
		checking, ie. cat the file to the appropriate folder:

			cat /tmp/newmail.$$ &gt;&gt; $HOME/Mail/$decidedfolder
			rm /tmp/newmail.$$
	# end script

This doesn't do any file locking, which is a rather critical operation
in mail filtering.  The easiest way to do that is to have a lock file,
and have a while loop that waits for this process to somehow own the
lock file, eg (excuse the csh, the code below isn't mine :-)
while (1)
  set mypid="$$"
  set mylockfile=locked.$mypid
  echo $mypid &gt; $mylockfile
  while ( -f locked )
        sleep 100
  end
  mv  $mylockfile locked
  sleep 5
  set whogotit=`cat locked`
  if ( $whogotit == $mypid ) break
end

You also probably want to have some way to make sure you don't lose mail
if something wierd happens in your shell script.

Ultimately, your life would be easier if you just convince your sysadmin
that, whilst you can hack the equivalent functionality in shell, you will
probably chew less system load if you run a program designed to do this:
ie. procmail.
