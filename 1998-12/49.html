Hi all,

I just felt I had to jump in on this whole thing since I
actually have had something to do with it.
(Lots of Y2K testing going on out here.)

The GPS Y2K issue it probably one of the more crucial.
Apparently (according to the US) all the satellites are
Y2K proof but as yet 3 ground stations are not and as
such the US are making no guarantee about the whole
thing.

But Y2K is not the only problem we face.
Most (older) GPS receivers use a 10bit number to store the
time. (ms from 1970) and as such will clock over in Aug 99
(opps not Y2K politically correct there) in Aug 1999. :)
So since you won't be able to use your receiver some
5 months before 2000 anyway the Y2K issue shouldn't worry
you. :)

And let's not forget the 2038 (32bit time) problem. Now
put your hand up if you honestly believe there won't be a
single system still using 32bit time in 2038.
Reminds me of... "640Kb is enough for everyone."


The fear should be in all these little embedded systems that
most people don't even realise exist. Like the one that
tells the plain that the airport isn't 300 feet below ground
level.

I think that most airlines won't be flying in the first few
days except for testing purposes. (I am sure there will be
a few well paid jobs on offer that week...) Boeing have
made the statement that their planes are Y2K compliant but
they make no such claim for the 500 or so third party systems
that they rely on.

But I am not worried. On the stroke of midnight 31/12/1999 I
intend to be flying over the north pole in a fly-by-wire
Boeing 757 using my notebook via my iridium mobile phone
to transfer money between my bank accounts.
No Fear!

Nick Stock
