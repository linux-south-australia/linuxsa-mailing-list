Hi,

Firstly, I'd like to say I downloaded the new version of the SVGA server
for Xwindows and it works on my Diamond Viper 550 (based on the Riva TNT
chip). Anyone thinking of getting a card based on this chip may do so
and know that xwindows will work. However, I am having a few problems.

When in netscape, graphics are displayed strangely and it seems that any
JPEG is displayed black and white. I think this is because i'm in 256
colour mode. Also, some programs sometimes don't load, and once I got a
message saying something like the colours have been distributed and I
need to close colour intense programs. When I closed all the other
programs, that program would load properly. I think this may too be
caused being in 256 colour mode.

If I do a 'startx 2&gt; x.log', then quit and look at the file, I see it
defaults to 8bpp. In my XF86Config file, I have 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp and
32bpp all defined to use 1024x768. I commented out all the modelines
that are out of my monitors capabilities, so when I looked at x.log,
there were no errors, yet when I do a ctrl alt + , it doesn't seem to
actually change. If I add another mode in the 8bpp section, such as
1280x1024, the ctrl alt + works and the resolution changed. oh, looking
at the XFree86 docs, 32bpp does not seem to be supported for Riva chips.

anyway, does ctrl alt + cycle through colour depths as well as
resolutions? If so, any idea why I don't seem to be able to get out of
8bpp? if not (or either way), how do I make it default to 16bpp instead?

sorry if it's an easy thing to solve, it's probably as easy as getting
gnome to load (rather than AfterStep), which I havn't managed to do yet
either *grin*

thanks,
Andy
