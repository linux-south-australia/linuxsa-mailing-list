&gt; 1) before you send a message to someone: they can see you, but they have to
&gt; send their messages through the server. This is because when they send you a
&gt; message, they send it to the IP address of your linux box, which doesn't
&gt; know what to do with it, so it just ignores it. However, once you send them
&gt; a message, the packets they send you will include your LAN IP address, so
&gt; the linux box knows what to do with them and there is no problem.

Hrm.... no. What I think actually happens is that icq listens on a port
for all of its requests, and when somebody sends you something it'll be
through that port. Because linux doesn't know that the win box is
listening on that port, it just denies the packet. A workaround for this
is ipportfw, which is a new option in the 2.1.x kernels: it allows other
boxes to listen on ports, and linux will recognise this and listen on the
port for the windows box.

As for the "the packets include the LAN ip address" thing, what I think
happens here is that some sort of connection is established by you sending
the message, and the icq on the remote end sends packets through this
connection. This is handled the normal masq way.

I'm probably wrong...
Michael.
