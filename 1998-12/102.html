&gt; I don't know if this is relevant to anyone, but I recently upgraded my
&gt; system from a Pentium 200 to a K6-2/350... but the important bit is the
&gt; video card.  It's a S3 ViRGE DX w/ 4 megs of ram, and after a certain
&gt; time of use, and under certain (unknown) conditions, the fonts become
&gt; garbled and horrible.  And they just get worse.  (btw - this is whilst
&gt; in hi-res screen modes (1024x768+) (not that I've tested that..)

I had this only when using Metro-X from Redhat 5.0
I, also have the S3 ViRGE DX w/ 4M ram in it. The solution
in windows is (most likely) to use the latest drivers, as I have
fairly recent ones that were dated about a month before i 
got the computer and I never had that trouble in windows. Also,
I saw the same prob. with Diamond cards at work (using S3
chipsets) under windows when the memory on the card was too FAST.

&gt; This isn't an X-specific problem - windoze does the same thing.

I only ever had the prob. under Metro-X, and upgrading to the
XFree86 S3V server solved it for me :-)

&gt; But windoze has a fix.  I turn down the "graphics acceleration" thing
&gt; in the "System Properties" dialog, and all is well.

Try the latest drivers from the www.s3.com.

&gt; The strangest thing about the problem is that only fonts seem to become
&gt; garbled.  All other graphics remain ok.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any dealings with this sort of problem before?  If you
&gt; have, I'd be most interested to know exactly what's causing it :)

See above about memory speeds. I know that slow memory garbles
everything at high res. modes, and in the Diamond cards, memory
which was too fast caused the fonts to become garbled. I suggest
that it may be incorrect memory installed in your video card.

I cannot recall the memory speeds required for the cards, and
the manual for mine isn't exactly very helpful on the subject.

I also read somewhere about a bug in one of the X-servers that
caused the fonts to be garbled when an application tried to
write a pixmap to its window background. Don't quote me on that
because i cannot remember where I read it, nor what server/card
combination it was.

The thing that I found that set off the garbled fonts was to open
a window with a scroll-bar and then open a bit file/document and
scroll to the bottom of it. On the way back up, it garbled the text.
