&gt; I can't believe that by the time I've read your message the whole
&gt; lot of this free hardware hasn't already been spoken for.
&gt; There are several linux people who have houses full of museum-piece
&gt; computers. I only have stuff dating back 10 years.
&gt; 
&gt; If there's anything left over, please let me know.
&gt; One really good and fair idea would be to arrange for someone
&gt; to take any of this old hardware to our regular monthly
&gt; meeting on 15 December 1998, and then have a raffle or something.
&gt; The kind of gear you're talking about would be extremely popular.

I think you meant to cc that msg to the list, so I've cc'd this one.

I've actually only had one person interested, though they'll be dropping 
by later today. I like the idea of donating stuff to the group and doing 
group stuff with it if possible, since that's the way ProgSoc was built 
(courtesy of the lovely people at Sun Microsystems Australia.. though we 
put SPARClinux on their stuff :). I like the idea behind ProgSoc, to 
promote hacking, basically.. though that's kinda gotten obscured over the 
last few years with people using our servers for webpages and not much else.

You guys seem to be of similar mind, from what I've been reading on your 
website, so I'll have to drag myself along to a meeting now. :) We're 
bound to get rid of old stuff again, so I'll keep it in mind for when we 
do.. and for anything that's left over after people have picked over it 
today.
