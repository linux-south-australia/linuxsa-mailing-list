&gt; One thing I have seen on other mailing lists is the reply-to has been set to
&gt; the mailing list, so you just press reply and it sends it back to the
&gt; list....
&gt; 
&gt; Could that be looked at as an option. Then it would be an easy solution to
&gt; sort by reply-to address. As well as solving the (minor) problem where you
&gt; just press reply instead of reply-all when you want to send it to the
&gt; list...

I'd like to do this, as I get the impression that people are often
responding to questions privately and thereby wasting effort for two
reasons:
- If responses were sent publically, people could see whether an
  answer has already been given before they responded.
- Reading the questions and answers going back and forth across the
  list is a great way to learn, even if you never post.  If answers
  never appear on the list, how are the rest of us to learn?

However, I feel that the disadvantages of adding a Reply-To field to
all outgoing list mail outway the advantages:
- It changes the expected behaviour of the Reply function of people's
  MUAs so that it works the same way as a the 'Group Reply' function.
- People will start embarrassing themselves by sending private emails
  to the list.
- There's no way of sending a reply to just the sender short of
  manually changing the 'To' field in your reply.

Instead of adding the Reply-To field, I'd like to see people who get
private answers to summarise the answers back to the list so that
everybody else can learn (of course, private email should be kept
private!).  Also, if you ask a question and then figure out the answer
yourself, don't write to the list "nevermind, I figured out the
answer" -- tell us what you discovered!
