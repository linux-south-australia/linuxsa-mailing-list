Hi,
I'm getting closer to getting on the net but I'm stuck at one point!

When I set up the connection via X in the modem configuration panel I
put in the user name and password ok, however, where the screen is spit
into EXPECT AND - SEND, it comes up with ogin under expect and send is
ok because I type in ny details, so far so good if this is correct.

Next point I left the settings as is and put my details in, and
wonderful feelings the modem responded and proceeded to connect, well
handshake to be accurate.  Then it waited for about 15 sec then retried
until I disabled the ppp redial.

Ok I says to myself change the "ogin to login" and asswd to password and
presto here we go Ive cracked it :-)....Hmm no such luck.

So that's it, the modem works the connection goes through but does not
get accepted for whatever reason.

Finally if your ISP provides the ip and the name server address do you
need to fill in the hosts names box.

Sorry if this is wandering a  bit I'm still trying to make sense of it
all. Feel free to correct terminology :-)


Thanks

PS Is it just me or is everyone getting exited re good office packages
becoming available like Corel's it seems to me there are big things
afoot. But boy I really need a good HTML editor (bla bla yes yes a text
program can do it but I need productivity more to the point)

Keep up the good help guys.


Steve
