I installed RH5.0 over FTP from a Win98 box a while ago, if I remember
correctly, it was because the 2x CDROM drive I had in the machine I was
installing RH onto wouldn't read any disks that I had burnt.

I remember that I had some fun trying to get it to work, and what I ended up
doing was copying the entire CDROM to my hard drive (not a problem on my 6Gb
drive..) and then installed it over FTP from there.

If you are putting 5.2 on, the install has an option to do it over a samba
share. That would be a much better option than the FTP option, I would have
thought anyway. If you need any help setting up the samba options, let me
know and I will run through it with you.

Cheers
Dazz

Subject: Red Hat 5.2 Sparc install failing


&gt;Hi Folks,
&gt;
&gt;I got hold of the 5.2 variety pack the other day, and have been
&gt;able to reboot my IPC from the install floppy images.  I've then
&gt;tried to get a FTP install working.  The CD is on a Win95 box
&gt;running WARFTPD.
&gt;
&gt;The install seems to be working to a point - there is a fair bit
&gt;of initial ethernet action as it FTPs across one of the config
&gt;files (sorry, couldn't write the name down that fast), then the
&gt;file systems get set up and formatted, and then the serious FTP
&gt;downloading starts, and I get a failure 11.
&gt;
&gt;I'll try it again tomorrow and get more details, but at this
&gt;point I was wondering if anyone had got this setup to work?  I
&gt;saw some other newsgroup messages suggesting similar problems,
&gt;but the only responses were "was it plugged in" and "did you
&gt;give the right IP address" and so forth.
&gt;
&gt;The problem looked a little like the might be problems with
&gt;filename munging or some such, but util I write down the full
&gt;details I won't be sure.
&gt;
&gt;Any thoghts appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, Dieter.
