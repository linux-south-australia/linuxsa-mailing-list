&gt; Probably.
Do remember that they did call it MS DOS.

&gt; I guess I just got a little hurt when software developed by volunteers is
&gt; referred to as "Stallman on world domination". And as before my whole
&gt; reason for the GNU/Linux thing is that I don't like to see good work done
&gt; go without credit. I'm not really a GPL evangelist, more of a GNU
&gt; evangelist, mainly because I use GNU utilities in atleast half the things
&gt; I do in Linux, and I kinda think they deserve a little respect.

I to am regularly offended by the many anti-FSF/GNU sentiments made by
various (often anonymous) linux enthusists.  There are few (if any)  
people who can match Richard Stallmans contribution to free software.  And
no organisation has done as much as the FSF to promote and maintain free
software (although there are organisations who have contributed more
source code).

However Linux isn't The Free Software and visa versa, and while the FSF
have made a signifigant contribution to linux, by no means are they the
only ones.  The FSF go to great lengths to explain that not everything
under the GPL is GNU, I consider it rather predatory and oppitunistic for
them to make an exception to this rule for linux.

&gt; I understand what you're saying with the embedded systems stuff, and yes,
&gt; I more or less stuffed up in that respect. But, as before, my heart was
&gt; with Stallman/Co, not with the FSF's license. I know it didn't sound that
&gt; way, but that's the main reason for my vehemence.

My prefered license is the LGPL.  I don't like the infection clause of the
GPL, however I don't like the fragmentation of the various BSD licensed
source-trees.
