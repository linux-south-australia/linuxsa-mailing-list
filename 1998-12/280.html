&gt; Things which change that picture:  Satellite Internet delivery (which
&gt; drastically reduces the amount of data which needs to be pulled through
&gt; Telstra's overcharged service even if they are backchannel charging)
&gt; and the recent announcement by the ACCC that they're declaring the local
&gt; loop, so you won't have to think about Telstra at all if you don't want
&gt; to.
&gt; 
&gt; The local loop is the biggest cost of providing bandwidth to a home
&gt; (whether it's bandwidth via telephone or ISDN or xDSL doesn't matter,
&gt; the local loop still costs money).  When Telstra's competitors have
&gt; access to that without needing to pay the extortive prices Telstra
&gt; is currently charging for it, those competitors will be able to lower
&gt; their prices like they've never lowered them before.  Expect lots of
&gt; ISPs to say, "Hey, I'm a telco too!" and install routers in Telstra
&gt; exchange third-party rooms for permanent connectivity, and watch
&gt; the price of that connectivity fall through the floor.


This will happen but do not expect to see a plethora of small ISPs racing
out to spend cash on DMS-100 or other stuff. Lets look at the US example
and how it works after the breakup of the US monopolies and a bit ....

First of all you must become a Telco (or something they call a Competitive 
Local Exchange Carrier - CLEC) - this is not too hard as there are
lots of them and there are plenty of lawyers to help you out :-) (on that
one for alot of ISPs in the US who have become CLECS ussually have between
2 and 6 lawyers on staff - hands up those with more than 6 tech support 
staff ?). To become a telco you need to publish a tariff which says that
you must offer the federal Universal Service, things like local calls and
other goodwill stuff - you do not have to do this affordably - you just
have to do it - who wants to buy a local phone call at $6 per minute ?

[Still figure $50k and 18 months if the lawyer is a putz or about $150k
and six months of you get somebody switched on]

For the most part the state based PUC (Public utility Commissions) really
do their best to help out new players in the market.... the AUSTEL/ACA
would require a labotomy for that to happen !

OK. So you are now a carrier - you then have to negotiate for access to
the "Central Office" (exchange) ..... lets say that you can successfully
do that. After you go through that process the carrier requires you to
inventory everything that you plan placing in their facility to make sure
it is safe of course - do a search on NEBS standards and compliance if you
are interested because all your gear will have to conform to NESB3. They
will reject any application that plans to use equipment that does not meet
safety requirements. Once you have all the gear commonly called carrier
grade (also carrier priced) you will need to get the actual room on the
exchange floor - but of course there is none left (this is a standard
delay tactic in the US) [3 months go by while they survey some more space
for you or in real world terms they move the staff ping-pong and pool
tables]

OK. Then you get the bill for your 10 ft x 10ft chunk of exchange room
floor - cheap (in the US) is $100k to just set it up and that does not
include your cage and is US$. Then you can pay anything up to $300k pa for
that space depending on the echange (Central NY or SF exchange a good
example) but that only $120k per year is more typical for elsewhere.

OK. You have your space, you have set up your gear and have your frame
there that people can connect to (you have to jumper them your frame or
pay Telstra to do it). You cannot (in the US model anyway) switch any
services inside that building - all of the calls/data has to be switched
elsewhere - it is merely a point of access or interconnect. So you need to
run a fibre back to your switching room - where ever that is - better get
the Komatsu dozer out and some cable layers !

Then if you plan to do phonecalls you will need to negotiate reciprocal
compensation or settlement .... do you still have those laywers ?

[In all the above I have missed dozens of hurdles that you would need to
cross]

So the moral of the story is that you need shitloads of cash, you need
truckloads of patience and REALLY good legal advice. Mind you I think that
I would be scared if it were too cheap - that would lead to absolute
chaos ! And even with all of the above in the US they have driven a wooden
stake through the heart of telco pricing despite what you have to go
through.

The 14th of December 1998 was indeed a grand day :-)
