If your link is used at only an average of 1.5% load (which is much
more likely for individuals with permanent home links) you pay almost
nothing.

The backchannel charging thresholds have apparently been calculated to
mean that the whole thing is a non-issue for most people anyway -- There
is no backchannel charge if your received:sent ratio is less than 2.75:1.
Telstra's backchannel charging is really out to get ISPs like SE-Net,
which have a volume charged bigpond connection for outgoing traffic
and a satellite link for incoming traffic:  They use the Telstra link
essentially for ACKs, and therefore incur virtually no charges on it
(because you usually only pay for received traffic on Telstra WetSpot
connections) while generating quite a substantial amount of international
traffic.

Not that I'm excusing Telstra here, since there's very little economic
reason for them to be volume charging at all, let alone at the hugely
extortive price of 19c/Mbyte, but they really aren't Out To Get small-time
individual users here.  2.75:1 means that protocol ACKs will almost always
be enough to make sure you don't hit their backchannel charging threshold,
so you won't get billed for it unless you start flood-pinging non-existent
IP addresses.
