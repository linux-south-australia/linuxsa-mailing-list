&gt;What I was trying to get across in the previous paragraph is that it seems
&gt;a chicken/egg thing. If GNU released an OS, using the linux kernel, before
&gt;the linux kernel hackers used the GNU utilities, chances are it'd be
&gt;called GNU. And yes, I know they wouldn't do that, they've got the Hurd.
&gt;:)

I'm glad this discussion is still on the list, because I think those
who weren't aware have learnt a lot (me too :-)

I think it is worth noting, for those who don't know, that Linus
_intentionally_ designed Linux around the available GNU tools.  ie. the
above scenario isn't just impossible because of GNU and Hurd, it is
impossible because without GNU there was no Linux -- Linux was built
on/with gcc and depended on it (GNU) for the basic system utils.

This is why RMS wants it to be called GNU/Linux -- because it takes
so much from the GNU project.  OTOH, I don't like calling it GNU/Linux
because it _isn't_ part of the GNU project, and GNU didn't support it
for a significant while.  I think it _is_ important that we give credit
where credit is due, but the fact is, Linux isn't famous because it's
free (why not *BSD?), it's famous because of the team behind it, lead
by Linus Torvald, who named his OS "Linux" (actually Freax, but we won't
go there :-).

GNU forms an important part of Linux, but it is would no longer be fair
to only recognizes GNUs efforts without similarly recognizing BSD and
Artistic licence (c is a noun, s is a very, I believe :-) input, for
without the networking code (BSD inspired, I believe?, although totally
recoded) and Apache/Perl, Linux would not be where it is today.

&gt;Btw, can anybody clear this up for me? Is the Hurd:
&gt;* GNU reinventing the wheel
&gt;* or GNU writing a kernel on a "better"? microkernel architecture, rather
&gt;than the monolithic style in which Linux is written.
&gt;
&gt;It's the "better" that I'd like to clear up. Are microkernel's generally
&gt;faster/better/nicer/meatier?

I can't answer that directly, but my understanding is that Hurd is
a worthwhile venture investigating different ground to Linux, and it
is quite likely that we the OS we use in 10 years time will be quite
different to that we use today -- just as flexible, powerful and free,
but perhaps not as traditionally Unix -- because we are beyond trying
to make Linux a full Unix, and are now breaking new ground that others
(SCO, x86 Solaris) are trying to catch up with.  Hurd technology will
probably flavour Linux in the future, once it is more proven.

&gt;Would like to respond to all the previous paragraphs in the following
&gt;manner:
[Explaination of miscommunication]

Goodness me, how are we supposed to have a religous war with everyone
being so eminently reasonable? :-)
