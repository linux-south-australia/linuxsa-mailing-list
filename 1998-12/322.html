&gt;In the meantime I've tried the various suggestions (ie. filtering by cc and
&gt;to, and even checking the last three lines in the message's body) but
&gt;neither Eudora Pro nor Outlook Express work 100%. I still get some messages
&gt;coming through to my Inbox.

Eudora Pro:

- Click on the 'Tools' menu and select 'Filters'.
- Click 'New' and check the 'Incoming' and 'Manual' boxes.
- From the 'Header' drop down list, list select 'Any Header:'
- Underneath this, ensure 'contains' is selected and to the right of
    this enter the text '<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>'
- Underneath this, select 'or' from the drop down list.
- Underneath this, ensure 'contains' is selected and to the right of
    this enter the text '<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@Elizabeth.netcraft.com.au">linuxsa@Elizabeth.netcraft.com.au</A>'
- Select 'Transfer To' from the first 'Action' drop down box and click
    on the destination button immediately to the right of this
- Select a mailbox from the list, or create a new one.
- Close the filters window and answer 'Yes' to the 'Save Changes?'
    dialogue box.

This has worked for me since the list started. Of course I use pine now :o)

&gt;Now, I receive a large quantity of mail daily and it is not easy to filter
&gt;all messages by hand.

My record is this...

	Downloading message 1 of 15336

47 Meg worth. text only, no attachments. That was on Eudora. Filtered like
a dream.

&gt;To all those that gave constructive criticism. Thank you. You have given me
&gt;some great ideas, and it has improved my filtering quite a bit.

Flitering is something you perfect slowly. If a mail gets through a hole
you can modify your filters to compensate. You'll notice with the above
example I included elizabth.netcraft.com.au as well, as I had a few slip
through once, but I think it was a fault that has since been recified.
Still, no harm in keeping it there.

Have fun with your filters!

Cheers

Alex!
