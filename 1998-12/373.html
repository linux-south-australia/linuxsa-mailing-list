Whoops - forgot to put brain in gear :-(

What I meant to say was that such events could possibly be held every second
or third month *not* 2 or 3 times a month.

Cheers,

&gt; Subject: ConfigFests - developing new users
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; After last night's meeting, I floated the idea of "ConfigFests"
&gt; {for want of
&gt; a better term} which was favourably received by those I spoke to.
&gt;
&gt; What I was suggesting was a method of expanding the current concept of
&gt; "InstallFests" to bi-monthly or tri-monthly meetings in which,
&gt; depending on
&gt; the venue, may have one or more themes.
&gt;
&gt; For example, what about Networking ConfigFest in which people bring 2
&gt; machines (with appropriate hardware) and then work though the process of
&gt; networking them.
&gt;
&gt; Another possibility is a Afterstep ConfigFest in which people bring their
&gt; machine in an then work through the various modifications that
&gt; can be made.
&gt;
&gt; What about a SAMBA ConfigFest etc etc.
&gt;
&gt; Whilst this may be second nature to some of us, this approach may
&gt; provide a
&gt; method in which new users can expand their knowledge in a supportive
&gt; environment.
&gt;
&gt; My gut feeling is that these could be extremely successive
&gt; meetings, perhaps
&gt; with a gold coin donation to LinuxSA.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, what do others think?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
