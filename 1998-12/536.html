&gt; Tomasz, what other hardware are you using besides the Tseng et4000/w32 p
&gt; rev d video card?
&gt; Are you using a non-Intel CPU (IBM/Cyrix or AMD)?
&gt; What motherboard?  What CDROM drive?  What RAM, how much?
&gt; Rick Marshall &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rjm@herzfeld.com.au">rjm@herzfeld.com.au</A>&gt; has already pointed out that Ctrl-C or
&gt; Ctrl-\ should regain control and Ctrl-Alt-Del should do a shutdown -r now.
&gt; My guess is that you have a hardware problem.

That's totally possible, but I've had the exact same problem - I tried to
install staroffice with its setup program under kde, and the system froze.
telnetting to my box from another machine allowed me to see what was
happening, but shutdown -r now didn't bloody work.  So I went for the
reset switch.  After fsck did its quick check it thought there might be a
bigger problem and I did a manual run of it, answering yes (rather
blindly) to its insistent questions.

then this happened:  nothing worked.

I did "rpm -V `rpm -qa`" to check every package on the system, and there
were 1,000,000 files (or so) with checksum errors.  I suggest you do the
same, Thomasz.

So I wussed out and did a reinstall - luckily I've partitioned my disks in
a way that meant no important data was lost.


Just in case anyone was interested :)
