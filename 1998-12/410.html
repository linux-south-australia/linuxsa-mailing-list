 &gt; Has anyone out there had any experience with running FP extensions

 &gt; It is looking like we will have to support them for some of our

 &gt; for any nasty suprises.

I didn't see any replies to this.  All I can say is, "Be afraid,
be very afraid."

The first version of the extensions was binary only;  it contained
a bug which permitted anyone on the Internet to break-into your
machine as root.

They patched that.  The second version of the extensions was
also binary only;  It contained a *different* bug which permitted
anyone on the Internet to break into your machine as the same
user-id your web server runs under (root on some sites).

They patched that.  They released a third version which was mostly
binary-only, with the exception of one or two .c files.  The .c files
are so badly written it's almost comical; It's pretty obvious that
whoever wrote them has absolutely no idea about C programming under
UNIX (or, perhaps, under any other OS).  There is very little evidence
that "safe" programming practices for setuid executables have been
followed, and the vibe among the professional security community is
that the extensions can't be trusted as far as you can throw them.
There are profound issues of reliability to consider if the bits they
haven't released source code for have been written by the same person
who wrote the source they do include.

The extensions try really hard to install themselves as setuid-root.
If you jump through enough hoops and sacrifice a bit of functionality
you can convince them to run setuid to the web server uid instead.  I
haven't been able to make them work without the setuid bit added.

Summary:  They're dogshit.  If you value your security stay right
away.

 &gt; Are there any known exploits we should be aware of?

I'm more concerned about the unknown ones.  The code really is
appalling, written by someone who is so ignorant of UNIX that they've
named all the executables with .exe extensions.  There is no reason at
all to think they understand the significance or peril of giving badly
written code setuid privileges, and a history of two buggy versions to
point very stongly to the idea that they don't know what they're
doing.  I give my customers a very strong recommendation against using
the FrontPage extensions at all, and where they go ahead with it
anyway I make sure they understand that they're probably tossing away
any pretense of security.

The FrontPage extensions are CGI scripts which handle HTTP form
submissions (thats how pages get uploaded from FP into the web
server).  Think about all the security problems which result from
giving users the ability to run CGI scripts, then consider that the
FrontPage extensions only work when they're enabled.  Just to top it
all off they're insecure setuid CGI scripts written by Microsoft.

They're evil.  Just Say No.

Now, what happens if you don't provide the extensions?  Not a lot.
Frontpage still works, you just have to publish to an <A HREF="ftp://">ftp://</A> URL
instead of a <A HREF="http://">http://</A> URL and you don't get to use the whizzy
(non-netscape-compatible) "FrontPage Enhancements".  I think that
counts as a definite plus.  Just tell your users they can get their
webpage counters from sites all over the net and they won't know the
difference. :-)
