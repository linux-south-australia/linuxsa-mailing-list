G'day,

I did a bit of Linux lunacy (er, advocacy) &lt;grin&gt; tonight while at the 
Southern Districts Computer User Club Inc meeting tonight. 

I suggested that maybe someone from the LinuxSA group could come and give a talk
to the group.  A friend of ours happened to bring along the APC pocket book, so
I carried it around to a few key people and showed them some of the nifty screen
shots on the assumption that you can get Windows users interested in Linux by
showing them a few neat screens of cool stuff.  

I offered to write an article to go in the next newsletter which will be
published in February, and the president seemed interested in having someone
from LinuxSA in to speak (if we can arrange it) for the March meeting. 

SDCUCI meets on the 3rd Wednesday of the month, which is nice, since it doesn't
conflict with LinuxSA's meetings. 

Is there someone who could come give a talk and a demonstration of Linux? 
Something basic - with the aim towards showing those who've never heard of it
before a brief glimpse of what it offers and then dazzle them with amazing
feats like oh, not having to reboot every 10 minutes?  ;-)


Cheers,
Gaelyne
