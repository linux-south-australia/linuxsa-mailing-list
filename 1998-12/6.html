&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, I'd like to say I downloaded the new version of the SVGA server
&gt; for Xwindows and it works on my Diamond Viper 550 (based on the Riva TNT
&gt; chip). Anyone thinking of getting a card based on this chip may do so
&gt; and know that xwindows will work. However, I am having a few problems.
&gt; 
&gt; When in netscape, graphics are displayed strangely and it seems that any
&gt; JPEG is displayed black and white. I think this is because i'm in 256
&gt; colour mode. Also, some programs sometimes don't load, and once I got a
&gt; message saying something like the colours have been distributed and I
&gt; need to close colour intense programs. When I closed all the other
&gt; programs, that program would load properly. I think this may too be
&gt; caused being in 256 colour mode.
&gt; 
&gt; If I do a 'startx 2&gt; x.log', then quit and look at the file, I see it
&gt; defaults to 8bpp. In my XF86Config file, I have 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp and
&gt; 32bpp all defined to use 1024x768. I commented out all the modelines
&gt; that are out of my monitors capabilities, so when I looked at x.log,
&gt; there were no errors, yet when I do a ctrl alt + , it doesn't seem to
&gt; actually change. If I add another mode in the 8bpp section, such as
&gt; 1280x1024, the ctrl alt + works and the resolution changed. oh, looking
&gt; at the XFree86 docs, 32bpp does not seem to be supported for Riva chips.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway, does ctrl alt + cycle through colour depths as well as
&gt; resolutions? If so, any idea why I don't seem to be able to get out of
&gt; 8bpp? if not (or either way), how do I make it default to 16bpp instead?
&gt; 
&gt; sorry if it's an easy thing to solve, it's probably as easy as getting
&gt; gnome to load (rather than AfterStep), which I havn't managed to do yet
&gt; either *grin*
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Andy
