 &gt; &gt; Ok I says to myself change the "ogin to login" and asswd to password and
 &gt; &gt; presto here we go Ive cracked it :-)....Hmm no such luck.
 &gt; 
 &gt; the expect strings are case sensitive ( i think), so Login would be
 &gt; different from login, but ogin is common. username or Username is
 &gt; common, too, so try "ame:"
 
 
 NB: chat (the program that talks with the modem) only needs to understand
 _part_ of what it's given - ie if the ISP says "Login:" chat only needs
 "ogin:", "gin:" or whatever.
 
 Also watch /var/log/messages (tail -f /var/log/messages) while linux
 attempts the ISP connection - it speaks to you of what chat is doing and
 may well give you some handy information..
 
 Hope this is useful?
 
 By the way - look at this:

 I've dialled into my ISP (I have a shell account) and connected fine.
 Then I went out and had some beers with friends.  Before I went out,
 the speed of the connection was what you'd expect from a 33.6K modem.
 Now I'm getting these ridiculous ping times - sounds perhaps similar to a
 recent thread re pppd?  Not sure...  the output I've pasted was from a
 ping _TO_ my local machine _FROM_ a telnet session to the remote (ISP)
 machine.  The xx.yy's are from me post-pasting :)
 
 Why the huge variation?  There is no other traffic running here except
 licq - but that only does the occasional ping to icq.mirabilis.com to make
 sure it's still alive.  My system is showing no other signs of
 strangeness - AFAI'veNoticed, anyway...
 
 Has anyone experienced this before?  If so, please help - this has
 happened a few times before and is beginning to bug me because it means
 breaking my connexion :(
 
 If you want any more info, please ask.
 
 Many thanks for your time reading this :)
