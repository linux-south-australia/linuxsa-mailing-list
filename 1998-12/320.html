Mark,


I took a look at FAQ-o-matic

    <A HREF="http://www.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jonh/faq.pl">http://www.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jonh/faq.pl</A>

It looks really great.
Have you used it?

I had the impression that with authentication etc. etc. most users 
could not be bothered with it.
But the effort involved in posting to a linuxsa-solutions site is
almost zero.

The way it would work is that when someone has finaly got the answer
the the problem that they have posted, they post the final answer
ina nice neat form (statement of problem then statement of solution)
to _two_ newsgroups, both "linuxsa" and "linuxsa-solutions" at
linuxsa.org.au. Then the solution magically shows up in the
linuxsa-solutions version of the file

The advantage of this approach is the very tiny amount of extra effort --
no extra work, and nothing new to learn (even simple interfaces do
need learning time and occupy valuable brain-RAM [or brain-WORM ?]),
and easy access by users, with negligeable set-up effort by
administrators.

Conclusion:
I prefer the hypermail approach to the FAQ-o-matic approach,
although I haven't spent much energy trying to understand the
FAQ-o-matic -- because I just don't have the patience.

Cheers, and many thanks for the suggestion,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I'm sure it won't be up to me to make a decision one way or another
on the "linuxsa-solutions" solutions archive.
If the hostmaster(s) of linuxsa.org.au pick up on the idea, they will
decide which way to go.
Obviously either idea would resemble in its functionality the
kind of thing that I think Matthew Tippett is trying to do with the
Linux Support Initiative. I thought at the time that the
linuxsa list comes close to his objectives. But the list lacks
accessibility to its history -- results are not written up,
and they are not easy to find among the discussions.
This would be answered by Ccing nicely written up solutions to
problems (written up by the problem proposer) to a "solutions"
mail list -- called <A HREF="mailto:solutions@linuxsa.org.au">solutions@linuxsa.org.au</A> ??
