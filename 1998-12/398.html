&gt;PS Where can I get Transmeta shares??? RedHat one's would be nice as
&gt;well.

Considering Red Hat just got a new influx of venture capital, it's
unlikely they will need to float on the sharemarket any time soon.
However, they may do so regardless, if the founders want to get some
return on their hard work.  I would happily invest in Red Hat as a show
of support as well as a sound business investment in a company that is
only going to increase profitability.

Transmeta is still in the embryonic stage, it's unlikely to be a public
company for some time (but definitely will become one, IMHO, as venture
capitalists tend to like 'IPOs' as a way to get their money back, or
at least give it tangible value), although Paul Allen doesn't appear to
always work that way... (prob. since he doesn't need the money :-)

IPO = initial public offering = what we call 'a stockmaket float'
