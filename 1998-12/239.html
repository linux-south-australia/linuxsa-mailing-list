&gt; Not only is it silly to add GNU to the front,
&gt; it also seems to mistake the notion of OS. 
&gt; To my way of thinking, the OS was always waht nowadays is
&gt; called the kernel. The OS does not include applications,
&gt; even if some of those applications are various daemons.
&gt; Even the device drivers, even for the disk drives, are not
&gt; really part of the OS, although in some OSs, disk driver support
&gt; is inside the kernel, I believe.

I know it's a bad example, but if the Windows windows kernel was developed
by Microsoft, but paint, notepad, solitaire, scandisk, write, backup,
control panel, the GUI itself, recycle bin code, and print spooler were
developed by FooBarInc and were available _seperately_ (ie not owned by
MS, or a department of) from FooBarInc, you wouldn't go around calling MS
Windows MS Windows.

Linux is a kernel which uses the GNU utilities, or the GNU utilities are
programs which use the Linux kernel. Do you really think that even the
base utilities (such as cp, ls, and mv) are in the kernel? No, they're
GNU. Sure, it's possible and viable to use non-GNU utilities as the basis
of an operating system with the Linux kernel, and I'm not saying that you
should call the OS GNU/Linux in that instance. I'm saying that Linux is
a kernel, and a kernel is nothing if you can't do anything with it.

 &gt; 
&gt; In one GNU weg site page, there's an account by Stallman about
&gt; why linux should be called GNU/linux, because
&gt; linux distributions tend to have only a small number of lines
&gt; (relatively) of linux code relative to the applications that
&gt; are used with it (lpr etc.).
&gt; But it seems to me that this is an attempt by Stallman to
&gt; counteract the loss of limelight due to the success of linux.

If your organisation wrote a full C library, a compiler, tonnes of shell
utilites, a -shell-, an editor, and various other things, and then some
people developed a kernel for it to run on, and everybody went around
calling YOUR utilities the name of the kernel, you'd get pretty cheesed
too.

I'm not blaming Stallman, or Linus, or all of the people who work on the
kernel or the GNU utils. I'm blaming common ignorance.

&gt; &gt; The OS + auxiallary programs + device drivers
could be &gt; called, say, "linux+GNU". But I would prefer to say
&gt; "linux kernel, with GNU and other applications".

I'm all for that. I just don't like it when people say Linux, and mean a
whole operating system. I'm being hipocritical here, though, because I
often say Linux and mean the whole OS, but that's mostly out of habit and
because I tend to start way too many wars if I say "GNU/Linux". Like this
one, for example. *sigh*

 &gt; 
&gt; I know many people who saturate their sparc stations with
&gt; GNU software for all purposes, with the solaris OS.
&gt; But they don't call it GNU/solaris.
&gt; I think the GNU/linux thing is just an outgrowth of
&gt; Stallman's desire to take over the world.
I don't know much about Solaris, but I'm guessing its basic utils are
written by Sun. Again, it boils down to what you're referring to.

Stallman's desire to take over the world?!?

&gt; 
&gt; By the way, it seems to me that he is _not_ in favour
&gt; of free software. More freedom for some always means
&gt; less freedom for others.
&gt; For instance, I ahve some 27,000 lines of C++ that
&gt; I think are not bad. I've been thinking of using the GPL for it.
&gt; But then I lose freedom over my own software, and I acquire
&gt; numerous obligations. And the users of my software lose
&gt; any right to make money out of their use of this software
&gt; in their work so that they can feed their kids.
&gt; I mean that they woudl not be able to create new works using my
&gt; software as a basis, and then make money out of it.

Excuse me? You can sell GPL'ed software. And what do you mean, lose
freedom? Are you saying that by allowing coders around the world to mess
with your code you're denying yourself some sort of "It's my code, only
I'm allowed to mess with it" right?

 &gt; 
&gt; Therefore I am coming to the conclusion that
&gt; the Artistic Licen[sc]e is more balanced between the rights
&gt; of creators and re-users of software.
&gt; Public domain gives perhaps too much freedom to the re-users and
&gt; too little to the creator.

Again, the creator is allowed to sell the software. I think the only
freedom you are denying yourself is the freedom to REJECT giving freedom
to others.

&gt; 
&gt; Conclusion:
&gt; A tight association between GNU and linux is
&gt; not necessarily for the good.
&gt; I predict there will be a time when OS developers
&gt; cry out to be released from the tyranny of the GNU licen[cs]e!
&gt; And then the term "GNU/linux" will seem to have the same
&gt; osrt of emotional significance that MS/linux might have right now.

Erm. What? Tyranny of GNU? That's like saying "Don't give me your source
code! Your taking away my freedom!"

Be aware that it is not the intention of the FSF to make all software free
in cost. It is the intention of the FSF to fight patent issues which
restrict YOUR freedom to code what you want to code, and to ensure that
better code is generated through the input of more than a select elitist
few, who stuff things up anyway (re win95). I urge you to read the GNU
manifesto at www.gnu.org. 

I would normally remove the linuxsa cc from something like this, but I
feel that you have publicly insulted the GNU efforts, and it is my right
to defend what I beleive is a very noble cause.

Wishing he really hadn't made the comment about GNU/Linux in the first
place, 
Michael.
