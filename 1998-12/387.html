G'day,

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Does any of the Official RedHat verison CD('s) contain the KDE rpm's?
&gt; Could be version 5.2?
&gt; Thank you anticipated!

None that I've personally seen, which includes the v5.2 CD from RedHat and the
PocketBook CD.  

However, I used the RH v5.1 RPM's that are available from KDE, and had no
problems at all with installing it.  There's an INSTALLATION file with a list
of the order to use for installing the RPM's, and the only item not listed in
it that might catch someone out is it helps a lot to add the /opt/kde/bin
directory to your path before starting KDE. 

A few weeks ago I asked on the list for opinions about KDE - I don't really
recall what the concensus (if any) was, but I've been quite pleased with the
system.  Some of the complaints I've read in the newsgroups about it were that
Netscape and Star Office ran slow with it, but I haven't had this problem and
in some instances (Netscape in particular) I've actually seen an improvement. 

One of the other oddities is that my sound setup hadn't been quite right (I had
sound, but I thought it neated a bit of tweaking to improve it), and after I
started using KDE, I noticed that sound files now play a lot better. I'm
guessing the default mixer settings for KDE's mixer took care of the problem,
but I honestly don't know. 

Hope this helps you out.  

Cheers,
Gaelyne
