Hi,

I'm currently working on a kernel system call called simply "ttymigrate".
In effect, it will enable a user to make a process either switch tty's, or
direct itself to a file/device. Some of you at the last linuxsa meeting
probably heard me yammering about it. I need some input from you lot on
what the best way to do this will be.


Issues which have already been covered:

Q. Why don't you just use screen/some other program?
A. I don't like screen. I want to be able to move a process around
-without- running some sort of parent program for the process.

Q. That's super hackish/bogus/implements policy in the kernel/creeping
featurism/feeping creaturism.
A. I know. It's still fun though, and will be very usefull to me once I've
finished it. It's also a way to familiraize (erk. spelling) me to the
kernel sources, which is a good thing. :)

Q. Why isn't this mail going to <A HREF="mailto:linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu">linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu</A>?
A. I wanted to get the input of this list first. And, from what I hear,
the development kernels are undergoing a code freeze atm - that means no
new functionality, just bugfixes and suchlike. Correct me if I'm wrong. :)

Q. Wasn't this going to be an ioctl?
A. Yeah, but I changed my mind, seeing as it messes with processes more
than it does file descriptors.


Now, firstly I need some sort of input on the best permission policy for
this sort of thing. Note that whenever I refer to a tty or tty_struct
I'm referring to the tty which will be moved to. I'm currently considering
the following options:

- If you're not root, you can't do anything with it.

- Only work if the process to be moved is yours, and the tty-&gt;pgrp's
effective uid is yours.

- Only work if the process to be moved is yours, and ALL the processes
using the tty in question are yours.

Of course, the following simple policy will apply if you want to direct a
process to a file or non tty device:

- Only work if the process to be moved is yours, and you have read/write
permission to the file.


Also, I'm considering the best way to do this. The current preference is:

1. a file descriptor to a tty/file and pid of process in question is
passed to the syscall.
2. syscall performs sanity/permission checks (see above)
3. the tty-&gt;pgrp is changed to the pgrp of the pid.
4. the pid-&gt;tty is changed to the tty, or null if not a tty
5. copy the details of the tty/file descriptor to the fd's 0,1 and 2 of
the process


Hopefully, that'll cause the process to effectively be on the new tty.
There's one or two things I haven't covered yet, though:

- What to do with the process(s) on the tty that's being moved to.
- Whether I should move every process running on the old tty to the new
tty, or just the individual process.


Ta,
Michael

PS. This is my first project with the linux kernel, and my second in
linux, so if there's anything obvious that I've missed please shout. Also,
ta for Paul/Michael's input on this at the linuxsa meeting, too.
