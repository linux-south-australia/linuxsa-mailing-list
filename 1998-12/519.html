Hi Folks,

I've had a chance to retry the install with a couple of other FTP
servers and an NFS server running on the Windows 95 box with the
CD drive, and the cause now appears clear: all of the FTP and NFS
servers I have been able to test do not make use of the TRANS.TBL
file in determining the filenames they export.

For example, on the CD in /Redhat/RPMS/ there is a file called
APACHE-1.RPM which is mapped to it's "real" name by the an entry
in the TRANS.TBL file containing:

  F APACHE-1.RPM;1                     apache-1.3.3-1.sparc.rpm

The servers I've tried are not smart enough to use the TRANS.TBL
file in determining the names they export to the network.  This
seems to be a pretty obvious (and trivial to code) extension to
a server, but as far as I can tell, none exist which have support
for this.

Anyone able to tell me otherwise?

This seems like an entirely unnecessary dividing line - until you
get unix running on the machine with the CD, you can't do a net
install!

If there's no server which supports TRANS.TBL I may have to tar
up the files, ftp them, and try to do some sort of disk install,
but I'm sufficiently limited in disk space (1 Gb) that this will
make it difficult to get a full install.

Any clues appreciated.

Cheers, Dieter.
