Heyas,
I am using masquerading on my LAN. I don't use IRC much, but I do use ICQ a
*LOT* and here is what I have found:

1) before you send a message to someone: they can see you, but they have to
send their messages through the server. This is because when they send you a
message, they send it to the IP address of your linux box, which doesn't
know what to do with it, so it just ignores it. However, once you send them
a message, the packets they send you will include your LAN IP address, so
the linux box knows what to do with them and there is no problem.

2) file sending. Somewhat related to the above. When someone tries to send
you a file, the file request is sent as a message, then when you click
accept, your ICQ program tells the other end to send it on a random port,
but since the other end doesn't have your LAN IP address on that port, it
doesn't go through.

Couple of things I'd like to see introduced into ICQ for the next version:

1) When you connect to the server, and you are on a LAN, the server knows
what your LAN address is. I don't see why it can't send that little extra
info to the people who are on your list when you show as being online. Make
things a lot easier.

2) When ICQ knows what IP you are on on one port, it should be able to use
that LAN IP on *any* port.

Just my thoughts and findings. Hope they help.
