Hi Alan,

Off the top of my head, a few things / work arounds you could try (some
may not be very elegant, but might get you out of a squeeze).  :

1) Apparently, a quirk of most (if not all) Unix TCP/IP stacks is that if
you set your default route gateway to be your *own* IP
address ie. the address of the interface, then *all* foreign (ie. outside
the box) destinations are considered to be on the local subnet, forcing an
ARP request for the MAC address of the intended destination.  Your linux
boxes would hear the ARPs and reply with their MAC address. Once in the
local ARP table, your sunos box will talk directly to the linux boxes,
using the default route to determine the interface. I haven't tried this
(on Linux or Sunos), but Cabletron have convinced Microsoft to add this
quirk into NT / Dhcp server to suit the Cabletron L3 switching technique,
which tends to indicate it is a common quirk.

The problem with this method is however, when your destination is a real
"remote" destination ie. on the other side of a router. You will need to
set up the router to perform Proxy ARP for real "remote" destinations.

2) You could create host routes for each of your linux boxes. Of course,
you will need a host route for each linux box.

3) It appears that your problem is the "route" command, not the kernel /
ip routing itself. You could run gated, which will automatically add
routes into the table for interfaces discovered when it startes. As an
added bonus, you can play with dynamic routing. I have had the same sort
of issue with trying to add supernets to the Linux routing table using the
route command ... gated however does not have any trouble adding routes
with "odd" masks to the kernel route table.

4) Actually, as a variant of (1) which is more I think is better (ie. it
is not taking advantage of a quirk), as you suggest you could stick your
255.255.255.0 entry in, and then, when you want to access the other
15/16ths of the Class C, set up the router to do Proxy ARP. One thing to
be make sure to do is to keep the most significant 4 bits of your sunos
node address the same as the linux boxes subnet address.

eg.

Sunos
~~~~~
IP Address 192.168.5.18
SM 255.255.255.0
Node Address bits (0001 0010)

Route 192.168.5.0 mask 255.255.255.0

When Sunos wants to send to 192.168.5.19, it will match on 192.168.5.0 and
send it out the ethernet interface.

Linux box 1
~~~~~~~~~
IP Address 192.168.5.19
SM 255.255.255.240
Subnet Address Bits (0001)
Node Address (00011)

Route 192.168.5.16 mask 255.255.255.240

When Linux box 1 sends back to 192.168.5.18, it will think that
192.168.5.19 is on subnet 16, match the 192.168.5.16/28 route  and send it
out the ethernet interface back to the sunos box.

This method would allow you to also use a default route (which is always
good to have up your sleeve).

I would be interested to see how you go with any of the above suggestions.

HTH,
Mark.

&gt; My problem:
&gt; I have two machines with linux at home, and one sparc station,
&gt; all on the same subnet. This is a 28-subnet. I.e. the
&gt; mask is 255.255.255.240.
&gt; The linux "ifconfig" and "route" commands permit me to
&gt; use subnets by specifying the appropriate netmask.
&gt; The SunOS 4.1.3 "route" command does _not_ permit me to
&gt; specify a netmask, although the "ifconfig" does permit it.
&gt;
&gt; The result is that I have some quirky behaviour on my net, not
&gt; to mention lack of functioning of various routing functions
&gt; and e-mail etc. etc.
&gt;
&gt; My question:
&gt; Do I really have to abandon my intention to use subnetting of
&gt; my C-class network, so that the broadcast addresses match up etc.?
&gt; Or is there some way of making a SunOS 4.1.3 routing table
&gt; recognise netmasks via some C-level function or something?
&gt; I keep seeing these "who" packets directed to incompatible
&gt; broadcast addresses.
&gt; [I think this is really more a sunos question than a linux
&gt; question, but it must have been encountered by people
&gt; who have combined the two types of operating system.]
&gt;
&gt; Clearly I could just put all nodes on the network on
&gt; the 255.255.255.0 netmask. But this would not be
&gt; the "right" thing. One day, I might want to talk to the
&gt; other 15/16 of the C-class net.
&gt;
&gt; Another question:
&gt; COuld I just configure all of the host-to-host links
&gt; in the 3-host network as pointopoint links over ethernet?
&gt; That sounds probably even more dodgy.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, and thanks in advance for any info,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
