To ifconfig+route+netstat experts:

My problem:
I have two machines with linux at home, and one sparc station,
all on the same subnet. This is a 28-subnet. I.e. the
mask is 255.255.255.240. 
The linux "ifconfig" and "route" commands permit me to
use subnets by specifying the appropriate netmask.
The SunOS 4.1.3 "route" command does _not_ permit me to
specify a netmask, although the "ifconfig" does permit it.

The result is that I have some quirky behaviour on my net, not
to mention lack of functioning of various routing functions
and e-mail etc. etc.

My question:
Do I really have to abandon my intention to use subnetting of
my C-class network, so that the broadcast addresses match up etc.?
Or is there some way of making a SunOS 4.1.3 routing table
recognise netmasks via some C-level function or something?
I keep seeing these "who" packets directed to incompatible
broadcast addresses. 
[I think this is really more a sunos question than a linux
question, but it must have been encountered by people
who have combined the two types of operating system.]

Clearly I could just put all nodes on the network on
the 255.255.255.0 netmask. But this would not be
the "right" thing. One day, I might want to talk to the
other 15/16 of the C-class net.

Another question:
COuld I just configure all of the host-to-host links
in the 3-host network as pointopoint links over ethernet?
That sounds probably even more dodgy.

Cheers, and thanks in advance for any info,
Alan Kennington.
