I didn't think I needed to -- The onus is on the person claiming the
problem to cite a source, innit?

 &gt;  From Win NT Server 4.0 Resource Guide
 &gt;  (p.78):
 &gt; 
 &gt;    "SCSI disks should always be low-
 &gt;     level formatted when put on a new
 &gt;     controller.
 &gt;     The reason for this is that the
 &gt;     translation in use on the disk
 &gt;     varies from controller to con-
 &gt;     troller, and can even vary be-
 &gt;     tween two identical controllers
 &gt;     based on the controllers settings."

Pah.  The whole concept of cylinder translation is a botch to let
DOS/Windows believe that a disk has &lt; 1024 cylinders even when it
doesn't.  If you have a 32-bit OS with 32-bit drivers and a 32-bit
bootloader you use 32-bit cylinder numbers and the problem goes away.

The only reason the Microsoft document says it's necessary is
because it's Microsoft who was responsible for the botch in the
first place.  If they want you to low-level format your disks
to install Microsoft operating systems then so be it, but don't
make the mistake of applying that rule to any other OS in the
computer industry.

The lunacy of insisting on a low-level format on SCSI disks is amply
illustrated by Quantum disks: Many of them implement the
low-level-format SCSI command as a no-op, meaning that even if you
follow the Microsoft bouncing ball and try to low-level format your
disk you don't actually reformat it: The disk just says, "Ok! Done!"
and tosses your command out the window without actually changing
anything on the disk at all (which is why many Quantum disks
low-level-format in about a tenth of a second instead of taking hours
-- The entire LPS series of drives was like that, but they've done it
on other model lines as well).  Does Microsoft's report mean you can't
install NT on a Quantum disk that has been used on a different
controller in the past?  Or does Quantum's behaviour indicate that
low level formats aren't really necessary at all?

SCSI disks are low-level-formatted at the factory;  They very rarely
need it done again throughout their working lives.
