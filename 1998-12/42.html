&gt;What you REALLY want to know is, will your video still record programmes on
&gt;timer? If you can, by just fooling it into a date that is wrong, will G
&gt;code still work? Will your answering machine still work? Will your
&gt;airtraffic control system still work? Will your burglar alarm work?
This reminds me of lots of people saying that every plane that's airborne
is going to fall from the sky on January 1. I mean why? Does the plane
think "Uh oh... jumbo jets haven't been invented yet, i'd better get my ass
back on the ground ASAP!" or what? And how about the pilots? Surely they
can just turn OFF the autopilot and control the things manually? :)


&gt;
&gt;Heaps of systems have hard coded ROM software that can't deal with dates
&gt;starting with 20. They are the problem. Non-essential computer systems
&gt;really don't matter. Mind you, if a banking computer had a problem, imagine
&gt;the 100 years of interest that will get paid on 01/01/00. Nice.
Along with 100 years of interest on my car loan. Yuck :(

&gt;It's a big problem, but it's also the perfect platform for media hype.
&gt;
Of course it is.
*thinks* Maybe i'll call up all the TV and newspapers and tell them that
their payroll computers will all die on Jan 1 and they won't get paid. THEN
we'll see some real panic ;)
