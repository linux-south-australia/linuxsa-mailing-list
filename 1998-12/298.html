Please do not follow up this meta-suggestion with numersous
comments, but....

I keep thinking that it's sad that there is not real
half-way house between broadcasting lengthy threads to all
of the list and narrowcasting replies to one or two participants.

Given that the best option is to broadcast if in doubt,
up to a certain point, here's a suggestion as to how to
get some really positive outcome out of questions asked:

Each time a stream/thread of  discussion results in a resolution,
e.g. someone finds out how to filter their mail, or how
to cross-mount their file systems etc. etc., 
then the questioner should prepare a brief html page
(possibly just pure ascii) and insert it (somehow)
on a suitable web site, so that eventually we get a
set of FAQ pages -- i.e. not the classical multi-deca-kilobyte
FAQ that answers everything, but a set of page-per-question
files that can be browsed somewhere.
If I had a realibel site, I'd offer.
Is there some standard software which allows people to 
(securely and safely) insert a file in a directory for 
others to peruse?
Otherwise it needs a FAQ editor (i.e. human) to receive
the pages and store them.
Perhaps this could be done with procmail automatically
receiveing e-mails and storing them.
Or...... how about the software that compiles the e-mail
archives at linuxsa.org.au ? We coudl have a separate e-mail
list, and this should be for only _solved_ problems (or problems
that eventually were abandoned as being unsolvable).
Then this could be perused by people looking for definitive answers
to things that have already been solved.

My apologies for the typing errors.
My current set-up is not convenient for correcting typos.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
