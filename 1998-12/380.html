&gt; One thing I have seen on other mailing lists is the reply-to has been set to
&gt; the mailing list, so you just press reply and it sends it back to the
&gt; list....

This, too, is a bad idea.  The reply-to address is something which an author
can set to indicate that his or her email address is different to the one
which was used for sending the email.  It is inappropriate for the list to
subvert the meaning.  It also leads to a flood of private replies to the
list.  Remember that it is easy to resend a copy to the list if it was meant
to be public, but almost impossible to retract the copy sent to the list if
it was meant to be private.  Note that in the first case, the private copy
is probably harmless; the chances are that you meant it to go to the private
address, too, as the private address is almost certainly also a list recipient.
