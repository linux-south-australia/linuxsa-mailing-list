&gt;&gt; Here's the problem: I want to set up a proxy server in our school. We
&gt;&gt; have a 200+ node LAN running NT4.0. (I am a computer teacher not the NT
&gt;&gt; administrator.) I have suggested that as part of our effort to improve
&gt;&gt; our internet service we set up a Linux/Apache proxy rather than the MS
&gt;&gt; version. It will be behind our firewall, an NT solution. Our connection
&gt;&gt; is a direct line running at 128, soon to be 256Kbs.
&gt;NT Solution? Isn't that an oxymoron?
&gt;Btw, you'll probably be using squid to proxy stuff. Apache is a http
&gt;server, as far as I know it doesn't double as a cache.

Actually, Alcaron, I think you'll find that Apache can double to proxy
stuff...
However, most people use squid, since it's better ;)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can anyone on the list tell me where to find the info I need. Basic
&gt;&gt; stuff like: how do I configure two ethernet cards on the proxy machne,
&gt;&gt; do I need a connection scrip in this situation, what size to set the
&gt;&gt; cache on the proxy machine, should I limit all the other servies on the
&gt;&gt; machine, etc.
&gt;Multiple ethernet cards can be configured by passing parameters to the
&gt;kernel at boot time, take a look at:

&gt;<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-3.html">http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-3.html</A>#ss3.2
&gt;
&gt;Hopefully if redsplat is configured correctly it should be an easy thing
&gt;to modify the network configuration. Redhat 5.0 has a nifty little network
&gt;config control panel in X - not sure if 5.1 has it, though.
&gt;
&gt;As for limiting the other services, that's usually a good idea. I'm
&gt;really no security guru, but the best general rule here is to only have
&gt;the services you really need. I'm not too sure about the cache size
&gt;though, I've never had to manage a proxy on a large network.

check /etc/inetd.conf, /etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny, and the squid conf
files.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have a 200Mhz clone with 32 Mgs of RAM and RedHat 5.1.
&gt;Should be fast enough, but you might want to upgrade the ram if you're
&gt;going to be caching.
I'd agree with that, although a quick harddrive would be good also.
SCSI RAID arrays for storage and a whole loada RAM would be good if you are
going to be doing a lot of requests-per-second, like for 200+ pcs all
accessing the web simultaneously ;)

&gt;Hope this helps,
&gt;Michael.
