Heyas All,

Having some "fun" getting a gnome program to work. The program I want to
install is called gtkicq-0.56. Anyways, when I try to create the
makefile for it, it comes up with an error saying:

configure: error: Could not find the gnomeConf.sh file that is generated
by gnome-libs install

This file is supposedly in /usr/lib. However, I know that
gnome-libs-0.20-3 is installed, and doing a rpm query on that proves it.
So where is this missing file? I tried to install gnome-libs-0.30.1 to
see if that would fix the problem, and that came up with an error
saying:

configure: error: *** IMLIB 1.8 not installed - please install first ***

But when I do an rpm query on that, it tells me imlib-1.8-5 is
installed. So what is going on?

I scrubbed my linux partitions and did a clean install of RH5.2 off the
CD this morning, to see if I had screwed anything up by playing with it,
but it hasn't made any difference.

My system is a PII-300, 64Mb RAM, 6.4Gb HDD (3Gb for NT4 the rest for
linux), running redhat 5.2 (from the boxed set). I have installed
glib-1.1.4 and gtk+-1.1.3 after installing linux this morning.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers
Dazz
