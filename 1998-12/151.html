I'm not normally in the habit of posting private replies in a public forum,
at least not without first asking for permission.  I make an exception in
this case with the justification that I have been given implicit permission.
(My correspondent said, "I gave myself permission.  Try it someday", and
so I am.)

I should imagine it is obvious to most of us that private communications
are not fair game for the public arena.  It is perhaps beneficial to know
who does not share this view, particularly when those people show intent
to continue in their abuses.  Caveat Interlocuter.

Regards,

David

&gt; If I understood what you wrote, you were trying to defend your
inexcusable

Between you and me, I think you can be more humane than this, if you try.

&gt; breach of common courtesy,

Where is it written... where have I signed your Social Contract...?

On what basis of Law, etc. would you be basing your case,
Mr. Prosecutor?

And, who appointed/elected you our District Attorney...?

Have you any credentials to indicate that your own dealings
have always been fair and your judgements of others unbiased?

When you have met these criteria, you may apply for the job
(e.g. in State or Commonwealth gov't, but not here).

Until then, sir, I request No More direct e-mail from yourself,
thank-you...

&gt; to whit,

I see you've got the legalese (or is it Shakespearese) for the job
but what about the more *important* credentials (see above)?

Anybody can wear a judges wig... but who can judge fairly?

&gt; posting a private communication in a public forum without
&gt; permission.

I gave myself permission.  Try it someday... you'll experience
much more freedom than you have today. You might find your-
self speaking out more about your gov'ts mistakes (e.g. pokies,
restrictive shopping hours, 20-year Microsoft-only contract, etc.)
and (hopefully) - in the end - effecting some badly needed change.

How much time do you have, friend... and where do you think
you can get the best return on your investment of it?

&gt; Shame on you.

And... how many Hail Mary's would you be prescribing,
i.e. if - instead of self-appointed Judge & Jury - you were
to role-play a priest in a confessional? (No reply is req'd)

&gt; Shame for the offense,

Who are you to judge the actions of another human being?
Is you blood redder than mine?

&gt; and double shame for trying to talk your way out of it.

My previous comment applies here as well.

Now, kindly accept my (above) request to cease & desist
with dignity, thank-you.

And send me No Additional E-Mails; your effect is nil,
and my mailbox fills with enough spam withour yours.

This ban on direct input from you is not negotiable, sir.

I look forward of news that you have applied your time
to more productive purposes and will cheer any accom-
plishments - on your part - that may come from (in fu-
ture) the better use of your time being better spent.

Oh... and... Have a Nice Day  ;)

PS We could have had a "Newall 2000" or three, if you
had applied "flame"-time to LINUX product development

Think about it...  The choice is still yours to make...

By coincidence, something *else* turned up in my day's
e-mail:

&lt;quote&gt;

  There is a major difference between being critical, and having
  a positive influence on others by saying things with
  compassion and true caring. When you sound critical, the
  person on the receiving end is likely to deny your words, which
  will be perceived as an attack. And then you won't accomplish
  anything.
