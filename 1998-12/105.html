&gt; Subject: ComputerBank
&gt; Date: Monday, 7 December 1998 13:28
&gt; 
&gt; Following on from the ComputerBank posting that was sent.  The original
&gt; author of the email has indicated that she wanted to respond.  &lt;snip&gt;
 
&gt; ======
&gt; 
&gt; Dear SBS Expt,
&gt; 
&gt; The email that you sent to this list was a private communication between
&gt; yourself and I.

Before today I have sent but *one* message to you,
and you have sent only *one* reply message to me.

(The exchange of messages was about a public call
for donations of time &/or equipment for a (presuma-
bly) charitable purpose, as indicated on a web-site,
mentioned in a post to LINUX SA's mailing list.)

Before that exchange, we were *total* strangers.

While it is unfortunate that personal details were
inadvertantly revealed, may I suggest that - when
writing to a total stranger, on "project" matters
(e.g. ComputerBank) - you consider the possi-
bility of either:

- withholding personal info that you would not
  like to see (even inadvertantly) published    -or-

- prefixing a quick reminder (e.g. "between you
  and I...").

Indeed, it was the very openness with which you told
of your plans for ComputerBank, et al. that gave me
to understand you to be a rather open person.

(Not only that, I have lived in more open societies
than Australia now appears to be; one, e.g., where
both the government's and individuals' details are
accessible by anyone (even the passing tourist),
under an openness principle written long ago into
the Constitution.  And, I have learned much in that
country, as as result of that tradition of openness.)

Fortunately, LINUX SA is a relative small circle of
(apparently) decent human beings who do not show
any signs of intending harm to any person, et al.

I trust that - having the benefit of your reply here
- they will comply with your wishes for confidenti-
ality with respect to any personal information that
they may have been able to gleen from the post
in question.

&gt; By posting this you have severely breached the 
&gt; confidentiality of our discussion.

For the record, I apologize for any inconvenience
inadvertantly caused by my report in this matter.
 
&gt; If people want to make their own decision of the relative merits of
&gt; ComputerBank I suggest they visit

I quite agree and wish you - and your project - due levels of success.
 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Kylie
