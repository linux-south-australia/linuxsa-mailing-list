With a bit of digging, and some help from Matthew Tippett it seems there is
a bug in LILO 20 that was fixed last week with the release of LILO 21. The
release is source code only, and as I don't know how to compile the source
code I'll wait until I can get LILO 21 as a rpm file.

My problem was, I needed to remove LILO from the MBR to get NT working
again. Looking through the Man pages I discovered that you can remove LILO
with the command lilo -U which removes LILO from the MBR and then restores
the files that LILO replaced.

Magic - NT boots again, and I can boot linux using a bootdisk. Whoever wrote
LILO should get a medal for thinking of backing up the files that LILO
replaced and then writing them back to the MBR when you remove LILO.

One day I'll work out how to compile source code and then install the
binaries, but until then I'll manage with work arounds and rpm files.

&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt;
&gt; [snip]...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;However when I got the machine home I tried to boot NT. I got the initial
&gt; &gt;welcome screen, allowed NT to boot through to the blue screen,
&gt; where I got
&gt; &gt;the dreaded "blue screen of death" with the message
&gt; &gt;inaccessible_boot_device.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anybody know what I should do next? I think LILO has
&gt; overwritten some
&gt; &gt;files in the MBR that NT requires, but I'm only guessing.
&gt;
&gt; Your guess may be right, in which case you will need to boot NT from
&gt; floppy or CDROM installation disk and rewrite the MBR.  Someone who
&gt; knows NT better than I should confirm (or correct this): use the
&gt; MS fdisk program as follows "fdisk /mbr".
&gt;
&gt; However, one thing that is worth a try before doing the above is to
&gt; run the Linux fdisk and make sure that the boot flag appears next to
&gt; the NT partition.  I suggest this because when I set up my machine
&gt; for dual boot Win3.1/Linux, MS would not play the game without the
&gt; boot flag.  Furthermore, as your initial welcome screen comes up, this
&gt; suggests that the MBR is intact but something else is wrong (ie the
&gt; inaccessible_boot_device); perhaps the boot flag is all that is
&gt; required to make it accessible.
&gt;
&gt; Good Luck,
&gt; --
