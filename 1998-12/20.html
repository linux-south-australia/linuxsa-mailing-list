&gt;Some mid points are to allow some known CGI scripts (web counters), feedback

Or run 'cgiwrap', which runs the scripts as the actual user.  This works
for systems where the users have real accounts, which isn't what most
ISPs do any more.

&gt;In general Remote attacks are attempts to get local host access, and
&gt;then local attacks try to leverage priveledges.  

Yup.  For example, there was a system that I administered a virtual web
site on.  They used to give us shell access, then they took it away.
I no longer had a way to get statistics on the site (none were generated
for us), so I thought -- hmm.  And I wrote a CGI that put a new entry
in cron -- my log processing job.  Only problem was, of course, that it
ran as nobody.  Oops!  But it shows how vulnerable a system with CGIs is.

&gt;&gt; In the article, they say that they didn't do backups because of
&gt;&gt; the overheads on a heavily loaded system.
&gt;
&gt;No *real* excuse here.

I agree, but...

There are two things -- one, when people aren't paying for something,
you value it less, and two, when you have a server on another continent,
you don't really want to saturate your international link backing it up.

They should've had "backup" as part of their server solution in the U.S.
Every page in existance that talks about RAID clearly states that it is
*NOT* a substitute for backing up.

&gt;Turn extra services off

I think this is the key, at every level -- if you don't absolutely
need it, don't run it.  This makes tracking log files a _lot_ simpler.
Suddenly, you can say -- why the heck was that process running, I don't
need it, I didn't run it -- hmm...

Ultimately the best form of security probably isn't so much in making
your system secure as it is in monitoring what happens on your system.
Once you've tied it down, all you can do is wait and watch.  If you're
watching the right places, you'll be ok :-)

That said, I do like the concept of the deception toolkit:

Forewarned is four-armed! ;-)
