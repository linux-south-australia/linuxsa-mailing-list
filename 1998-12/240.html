 &gt; I know it's a bad example, but if the Windows windows kernel was developed

 &gt; developed by FooBarInc and were available _seperately_ (ie not owned by
 &gt; MS, or a department of) from FooBarInc, you wouldn't go around calling MS
 &gt; Windows MS Windows.

I think we would, knowing Microsoft.  Let's face it, we call IE "Microsoft
Internet Explorer" even though it was written by Spyglass.

 &gt; Linux is a kernel which uses the GNU utilities, or the GNU utilities are
 &gt; programs which use the Linux kernel. Do you really think that even the
 &gt; base utilities (such as cp, ls, and mv) are in the kernel? No, they're
 &gt; GNU. Sure, it's possible and viable to use non-GNU utilities as the basis
 &gt; of an operating system with the Linux kernel, and I'm not saying that you
 &gt; should call the OS GNU/Linux in that instance. I'm saying that Linux is
 &gt; a kernel, and a kernel is nothing if you can't do anything with it.

&lt;shrug&gt;  If someone started a (hypothetical) project to port the 4.4BSD
userland (libraries, compiler, utilities) to Linux I sincerely doubt they'd
stop calling it Linux.  Not that as far as I can tell that'd be legal:
GPL'ed kernel and Berkeley-license userland, no problems at all.  It
wouldn't even need Linus' blessing, because he only owns the copright
on the kernel.

(An interesting point, really -- What better way could a company like MS
dilute Linux "mindshare" than by producing a version of "linux" that's
incompatible with other versions of "Linux"?  It wouldn't even need to
be widely adopted for them to be able to say something like, "Don't take
Linux seriously;  They aren't even compatible with themselves!")

 &gt; I don't know much about Solaris, but I'm guessing its basic utils are
 &gt; written by Sun.

Of course they weren't.  They were written by AT&T's USL (or USG, depending
on the timeframe), which was bought by Novell's UnixSwear group, which
was later sold to SCO.  

 &gt; Excuse me? You can sell GPL'ed software. And what do you mean, lose
 &gt; freedom? Are you saying that by allowing coders around the world to mess
 &gt; with your code you're denying yourself some sort of "It's my code, only
 &gt; I'm allowed to mess with it" right?

&lt;sigh&gt;

I write a software package.  I think to myself, "Hmm!  This would be
way better if I could make it do *this* was well," and the easiest
way to make it do "this" is to incorporate some pre-existing software.

So I do a web search and find that there's some pre-existing software
out there which fits the bill, and proceed to incorporate this "free"
software into mine.

Except I find out then that it isn't really free -- I have to pay a huge
price for it, namely that my right to redistribute *MY OWN SOURCE CODE*,
i.e.: that bit that isn't covered by the GPL, is suddenly restricted.
I am obligated to provide source code for any software that incorporates
GPL code, whether I want to or not.  Thus the "price" for using that "free"
software is giving up my right to refuse to distribute source code
(or, putting it another way, the price is that I must divert potentially
unlimited time, money and resources in making copies of my software 
available at the whims of others forever and ever, amen).  It isn't
really free at all, that price will, in many cases, be higher than
anyone is willing to pay.

And for what?  Incorporating the GPL'ed software into some closed-source
or open-source-but-with-a-different-license (like BSD or Apache) project
doesn't prevent other people from getting the GPL'ed code:  They can get
it the same way I found it.  So it isn't really helping Stallman's stated
goal of software hoarding, unless you consider that Stallman's license
makes me reject my legal right to hoard my own software.

That's why the GPL damages freedom.  It's like a virus which infects other
code it comes into contact with.  If I use a single routine from a GPL
program, I automatically *MUST* release the source code to my entire
project.  Open-Source isn't about *forcing* authors to release their
code to the public, is it?

 &gt; Again, the creator is allowed to sell the software. I think the only
 &gt; freedom you are denying yourself is the freedom to REJECT giving freedom
 &gt; to others.

There are other ways to (a) preserve the freedom for the creator to 
sell, (b) maintain the availability of source code, and (c) not restrict
the rights of software consumers.

The Berkeley license essentially says, "You can do anything you want 
with this software, up to and including incorporating it into commercial
products which get sold for millions of dollars without paying the author
royalties.  The only restriction on that use is that regardless of what
you do with the software, you must credit the author in the documentation
that accompanies your derived software, and you must include the author's
copyright messages in comment blocks in your own source code."

THAT license stimulates freedom:  Source code is always available;  The
Author is still free to sell his product;  Consumers aren't encumbered
with legal obligations to release the entire source code for any product
they later on decide to write.  That's the license I place on software
I write, because I have no desire to restrict the freedom of my consumers.

 &gt; Erm. What? Tyranny of GNU? That's like saying "Don't give me your source
 &gt; code! Your taking away my freedom!"

That's exactly what it amounts to.  That's why the BSD camp has such a
rabid loathing of GPL code in the FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD kernel -- As
soon as it's included, everyone who uses a derived system as, say, part of
an embedded system must release all the source code for their embedded
system to anyone who demands it.  Their freedom is restricted.

So they say, "Don't give me your [GPL'ed] source code!  You're taking away
our freedom to provide this product to people who build commercial 
embedded systems!"  That's a perfectly legitimate response to the General
Public Virus!

 &gt; Be aware that it is not the intention of the FSF to make all software free
 &gt; in cost. It is the intention of the FSF to fight patent issues which
 &gt; restrict YOUR freedom to code what you want to code, and to ensure that
 &gt; better code is generated through the input of more than a select elitist
 &gt; few, who stuff things up anyway (re win95). I urge you to read the GNU
 &gt; manifesto at www.gnu.org. 

We've probably all done that.  Alternate paragraphs offer cogent points
or extreme kookiness.

But you can be just as extreme (and extremely kooky) about free (open-source)
software without jumping feet-first into GPL evangelism.  There are other
ways, as shown by the remarkable success of Perl, apache, BSD, and others.
They're all free, and they all refused the GPL (read their mailing list
archives;  They all have "which license will we use?" debates in them
somewhere, which all finish with clear and concise reasons for avoiding
the GPL like the plague).

 &gt; I would normally remove the linuxsa cc from something like this, but I
 &gt; feel that you have publicly insulted the GNU efforts, and it is my right
 &gt; to defend what I beleive is a very noble cause.

Oh for gods sake -- "Publically insulted the GNU efforts" by not saying
GNU/Linux?  Be serious, please.

What's the noble cause?  Promoting and providing free software as a 
legitimate alternative to proprietry liberty-damaging functionality-poor
commercial software?  Or enforcing the GPL?  'cos they're not the same
thing, you know, and many GPL evangelists seem to forget that.
