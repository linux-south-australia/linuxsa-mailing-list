Hi

Yesterday I posted the message below to the list, but the message didn't
reach the list, I tried again, but it still didn't work even though I know
my e-mail is working. Today I tried to reply to a post to the list, still
didn't work. So I surfed on over to the Linux SA Web site only to find the
following:

---
Important Notes

Do not send subscription requests or posts from a root account (even if you
change the From line in your header). The listserver will ignore any
requests from root and will not bounce the message in any way.

If more than three messages sent to your account bounce, you will be
automatically removed from the list and you will have to resubscribe.

If you read the original post you'll see why I called this post:

CATCH 22

======== Original Post =============

Hi

I've been following the instructions in the Linux Pocketbook on connecting
to the Net. This message is the result, my first e-mail using Linux. Thanks
to all who have helped me get this far.

I can't seem to get PPP permissions working properly. I can connect PPP as
root/su but not when I'm logged in under my user account. I'm sending this
message as root. If I try to launch netcfg under my user account I get a
permission denied message even though I have the "Allow any user
to (de)activate interface" option selected.

If I connect as root/su, and then open another terminal window under my
user account I can't ping a site. Should I be activating PPP with netcfg
or is there another way.

Can anybody tell me where I'm going wrong?

======== End Original Post =============

Actually it's not strictly CATCH 22 as my way out was to issue the command:

shutdown -r now

Boot NT and then Outlook, and so long as I haven't been automatically
removed from the list I should be able to post this plea for help.


Regards Steve
