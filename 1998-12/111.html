 &gt; I have a question that is eluding me. I want to make linux reduce the
 &gt; size of the buffers and caches it stores in memory. I want to do this
 &gt; because I have 64 meg, and Xosview reports that over half of it is
 &gt; being used as a cache. The problem is that if I run an application like
 &gt; netscape, the system starts swapping to disk and thrashing around
 &gt; even though that there would be pleanty of memory if it reduced the
 &gt; cache size.

Ok, so your question can be roughly translated to, "I think my system
isn't running fast enough, but it might be a good idea to make it slower
by limiting the cache."

The way the cache operates means that any memory that isn't otherwise
in use for user processes will be used as cache memory;  That means if
half of your memory is cache, you probably don't have a high demand
for memory resources.

The real metric you can use to see if you're short of memory is to
monitor pageouts.  Pageouts occur when you have *really* run out of
memory, so the system sends pages from active processes out to disk.
It'll only do this after freeing cache blocks to make room;  even
once it has cleared all the cache blocks it'll try to throw away 
"clean" pages before paging out dirty ones.

If you're not paging out when you start Netscape, you probably don't
have a memory problem.  There are probably other problems causing you
grief (or, alternatively, you might just be suffering from the fact
that Netscape is miserable bloatware that uses far too much memory).

Linux has historically had a problem with performance when a process
or group of processes exhibit high demand for memory and high demand
for I/O at the same time -- You've probably seen this when you try
to run the C compiler and the X at the same time on a 16Mbyte machine.
Consider:

   1.  Process requesting I/O (disk reads/writes) sends requests to 
       the cache to receive the blocks it needs.

   2.  Cache says, "Hmm.  Performance issues caused by heavy demand
       for I/O can be mitigated by increasing the size of the cache
       so that it gets a greater hit rate."

   3.  Cache increases in size.  Clean pages from current processes
       may be freed to accomplish this.

   4.  If (1) thru (3) happen often enough (because I/O demand is high
       enough), processes exhibiting high demand for memory find that
       their pages have disappeared out from under them, so they fault
       them back in.  But the cache must be reduced in size to make
       room.

   5.  Extra paging overhead caused by (4) actually adds to the I/O
       demand that caused the problem in the first place.  Negative
       feedback makes problem worse -- Go back to step (1).

It's actually a problem shared by other UNIXes with unified filesystem
and VM cache (including IRIX and HP-UX).  The accepted solution is,
"Buy more memory."  The alternative approach is to either not use an
adaptive cache (by fixing its size at boot time, a-la SunOS 4.x, 
Ultrix) or by having an adaptive cache with an upper-bound on its
size (a-la Solaris and *BSD).  Both of these approaches allow the
C compiler and window system to run quite happily in 16Mbytes (well --
as happily as they can, anyway :-)

Machines with workstation workloads typically benefit from a fully
adaptive cache, which is why Linux probably uses one.  Machines with
server workloads find better results by either having a shitload of
physical memory and an adaptive cache, or by having less memory and
a cache which is limited to a bit less than 50% of physical memory
(although that should be tuned from workload-to-workload).  Ideally,
a server machine should have enough memory to never page out at all
(because delays from pageouts on a server can potentially affect lots
of users, whereas delays from pageouts on a workstation only affect
the person who has the machine in front of them), so in practice this
isn't really an issue.

 &gt; Is there any way to tell Linux to use smaller caches or to reduce them
 &gt; even smaller when it needs to use the memory otherwise?

The cache is adaptive -- It does this whether you ask it to or not.
