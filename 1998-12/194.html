Many thanks to all who posted comments to the list on dual booting Linux and
NT. I printed out all the relevant e-mails and then had another attempt this
weekend, this time successfully, at installing both operating systems.

This is what worked for me:

Disk is WAD Caviar 4.3GB EDI Hard Drive
Cyl = 8912
Hds = 15
Spt = 63

As LILO must be located entirely below cylinder 1023, and I think I needed
to install NT on the first partition, I used a calculator to work out that
cylinder 1023 was at approximately 490MB.

I still had problems with my copy of MS-fdisk, so grabbed a copy of MS-fdisk
from a neighbours machine with the FAT32 release of Win95. That still
wouldn't read my disk properly. So used a copy of MS-delpart.exe that I had
downloaded from the Internet a few days earlier and used that to delete all
the partitions.

After rebooting, MS-fdisk would read the disk, but continued to report the
wrong disk size (470MB instead of 4.3GB) I don't know why it still does
that.

I created a primary FAT16 partition of 350MB and installed NT, I use this as
a system partition and will only install the OS here. All other data and
programs will be installed on logical partitions later. (As I write this,
that partition has 260MB of data on it and has 90MB free, so 350MB for an NT
systems partition on a workstation seems ample.)

NT boots OK.

I then installed Linux. Using a combination of Disk Druid, Linux Fdisk and
lots of trial and error, I created more partitions. I followed the
recommended partition setup from the Redhat 5.2 manual, creating a 100MB
primary root partion, which keeps LILO and all the files LILO needs to
access, below cylinder 1023.

I then created three logical partitions, a 127MB Linux swap partition, a
700MB /usr partition and a 500MB /home partition. These are all above
cylinder 1023, but that's OK. I then installed Linux, selecting to install
LILO at the start of the Linux partion and NOT (and this is very important)
in the Master Boot Record.

After booting Linux a couple of times using a boot disk, to make sure
everything was working OK I then booted NT, and using the Disk
Administrator, created two 1 GB NTFS partitions (NTFS has smaller, more
efficient clusters than FAT16 on large partitions) I use one of these as a
applications partion and the other as a data partition (similar to /usr and
/home I suppose) Finally I used the remaining space to create a 490MB FAT16
partion that I might be able to use to pass files between NT to Linux, not
sure if I can do this yet.

I followed advice from the Linux pocketbook when creating the swap partition
and set a value for the swap partition of 1 and then selected growable,
which gave me a 127MB swap partition. In retrospect I'm not sure if I did
the right thing there, and I wonder if I still have a 127MB swap partion? Or
did the NT Disk Administrator steal some of that growable partition? I don't
know, and I don't know how I can tell, however Linux seems to be working OK.

I still have to boot Linux using a boot disk, but that's OK for the time
being. After all the problems I had getting this far I'm currently a bit
gun-shy, and I'm not too keen to mess about with LILO, bootpart or the MBR.

I will probably still take my machine along to Tuesday nights meeting. I
have a  S3 Trio 64V+PCI Video Card with 1MB memory, but can't set the
resolution in X greater than 640x480, perhaps somebody can show me where I'm
going wrong.

Many thanks to all who posted help to the list, if I didn't take your advice
it was because some of the stuff was just to technical for me, in particular
I'm still not sure what cylinders are, how a low level format can change the
number of cylinders with out reducing disk space, or in the BIOS, what
Normal Large or LBA means.

Seems I have a bit of reading to do, now where are those old lecture
notes..............
