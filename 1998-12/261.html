 &gt; Just thought people would find this interesting.
 &gt; In the beginning, Microsoft adamantly declared that Windows NT
 &gt; would replace Unix. Back then, looking at the rate of NT
 &gt; deployment, many were convinced this was going to be the case.
 &gt; However, after seven years of trying, Microsoft must admit that
 &gt; NT hasn't yet achieved that goal.

The Microsoft UNIX connectity tools aren't new, they're just a
rebadging of third-party products that have been around for ages
(the MKS toolkit and an NFS package that escapes my memory).

Don't be misled: This is classic MS "Embrace and Extend".  Providing
NFS services for NT doesn't make UNIX more attractive in an NT server
environment, it makes NT more attractive in a UNIX server environment.
It's MS's way of getting a toehold in markets it would never have been
able to penetrate, by positioning itself as a competitor to Samba.

Pah.

The MKS toolkit is the one featured in the semi-recent story about
Dave Korn heckling a Microsoft marketting exec at a trade show (where
the MS type insisted that MS's, aka MKS's, ksh was compatible with
UNIX's, while the author of UNIX's ksh insisted it wasn't).  The NFS
package they're bundling has been around for ages, meaning that it has
been able to build up a solid track-record of being one of the
slowest, buggiest, crash-prone NFS implementations available on any
platform.

The licensing on MS's product is warped too: You have to pay for each
server and each client in a model similar to the licensing model for
NT itself.

If you want to integrate PCs and UNIX use Samba.  It's free, reliable,
and (according to a press release from SGI earlier last week) it has
been benchmarked at nearly 5 times faster than WinNT 4.0 using MS's
own performance metrics.
