This idea won't get much further than Michael's current version of Linux.
It's not going to make it into any "real" distribution, and while Michael
*might* complete it (but probably won't), and therefore *might* convince a
few other people to use it, too (but also probably won't), come the next
version of Linux the people who do use it will need to choose between
giving the feature up; re-implementing it for the new (and possibly quite
different) kernel; and keeping the old (and presumably less attractive)
kernel.  Ultimately everyone will choose the first option.  This, of
course, is intended to be a harsh and dismal view of the world; also it's
realistic.

Replacing one open file with another, which does seem to be the nub of
the idea, is an odd idea.  I can't imagine what would happen if you started
a program on a terminal, and thus the program found out all about the
terminal, that is, number of rows, number of columns, baud rate and terminal
type, and then you replaced it with, say, a disk file.  Those ioctl() calls
won't make much sense, and many programs will proceed to fail.

Security is another issue: I won't even start on this one, except to say
that it will be one (of many) major reason why the idea won't gain wide
acceptance.

The idea sounds to me like a kernel replacement for something screen already
does.  I remind you of Newall's rule: If a problem can be solved in two (or
more) ways, pick one; don't pick them all.  Looking further, screen relies
on the fact that programs started within it are *not* talking to a terminal.
They talk to a psuedo tty.  This is important because if the user disconnects
from the real terminal (ie the modem drops out), all processes in that
terminal group are sent a hangup signal, which generally causes them to
terminate.  I believe this behaviour is non-negotiable; if Michael tries to
change it his idea is going to get even less support than I already predict.

Most of all, what I would like to hear, is the reason why ttymigrate is
needed.  I think I heard, "because it's a great training exercise".  Perhaps
it is; however I don't think training exercises are particularly interesting
to anyone other than the people directly involved.  They certainly don't
warrant any public discussion.  So why?  What problem is being solved?

Regards,

David
