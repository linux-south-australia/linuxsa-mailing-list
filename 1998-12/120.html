Mark,

You're doing an expected/mean outcome analysis.
I'm doing a worst case analysis.
In the worst case, a person of ill-will could e-mail a friend overseas
to non-stop read files from my web site, and that would cost
me $10,000 per year, or $28 per day, with my 33k modem.

And even iller-will person could _send_ me packets
all day (e.g. "spray" or "tcpstat" or something), and that
would cost me 19/8 times as much, i.e. about $23750 per year,
or about $65 per day.
Even if I filter out all the bad packets by identifying
the offending source IP address and barring it, the packets
will still come down my telephone line and I will pay for
that traffic.

This is something which is much worse than what a hacker can
do, because you can defend against that. But how do you
defend against someone costing you $65 a day by sending
you non-stop ping packets or something?

This is such a tricky topic, I'm reluctant to air it
in an e-mail list.
Does anyone know a solution to this problem?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
