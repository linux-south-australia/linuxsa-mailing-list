 &gt; Btw, can anybody clear this up for me? Is the Hurd:

"Yes" :-)

 &gt; It's the "better" that I'd like to clear up. Are microkernel's generally
 &gt; faster/better/nicer/meatier?

That's a religious issue (it's actually the issue that made Linux
what it is -- Linux essentially started due to a flamewar between
Linus and Andrew S. Tannenbaum in comp.os.minix.  Tannenbaum thought
microkernel-based modular OSs were superior).

Microkernel OSs can be conceptually simpler, and there's no compelling
need for them to be slower (or faster) than monolithic kernels.  However,
the widely-used microkernel based OSs of today are conceptually more
complicated and slower than the monolithic kernels of today (example
microkernel OS:  NT :-).

The Hurd has some nice traits (filesystems implemented as server processes,
processes with multiple user-ids in the same way that UNIX processes
can have multiple group-ids, well-defined abstraction incorporating
separation between microkernel-level activities, server-level activities
and process-level activities).  However, it burgeoned like Emacs:  Too 
many features, implementation complexity overwhelming design simplicity,
etc.  It also came way too late:  When they started it there were no
free UNIXes, but by the time they released it everyone who was interested 
was using Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.  If they released it four years
earlier Linux might never have happened.  Which would be a shame,
since open-source software would never have gained mainstream acceptance 
with Stallman as its poster-boy.
