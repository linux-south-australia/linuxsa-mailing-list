 This is a follow-up for a thread with
 a different subject (long forgotten).

 In that thread, it was said that the
 subj. combination could not be guar-
 ranteed to provide safe or reliable
 data access.

 Another correspondent replied with a
 blanket "no problem" statement on the
 question, but without citing a source

 Now, one of the sources, on which I had
 based the earlier position (i.e. that
 the combo *was* risky or worse), has
 surfaced:

 From Win NT Server 4.0 Resource Guide
 (p.78):

   "SCSI disks should always be low-
    level formatted when put on a new
    controller.

    The reason for this is that the
    translation in use on the disk
    varies from controller to con-
    troller, and can even vary be-
    tween two identical controllers
    based on the controllers settings."

 I seem to recall a similar warning in
 a SCO Open Server Release 5 manual as
 well (I have not yet re-stumbled upon
 this ref.)...

 Is there any more "citable" info avail-
 able; off-the-cuff opinions aren't worth
 taking commercial risks for IMHO, and
 I'm sure the matter has been taken up
 earlier by vendors whose reputations
 are on-the-line more substantially
 than people who posit in LINUX SA  ;)

 Add'l ref's to reliable sources would
 be of interest.
