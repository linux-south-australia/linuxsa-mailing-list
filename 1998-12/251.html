To ara/sbs_expt person:

I'd like to ask you and others for a bit more than
just individual preferences.
What I'm after is a fairly comprehensive list of 
licence styles. [US: License.]

My current guess is that in order from least freedom
to user to greatest might be:

c  u  r
10 0  0  Private, closed source, with nasty warning about going to gaol
3  10 3  GPL
5  10 7  LGPL
10 10 8  BSD
10 10 8  Artistic
0  10 10 Public Domain

The columns here mean:

c	creator's amount of control, freedom, satisfaction etc.
u	user's amount of control, freedom, satisfaction etc.
r	re-user's amount of control, freedom, satisfaction etc.

By re-user here I mean a developer re-using the source code,
whereas a user is the non-developer.

Each Licence obviously gives varying amounts of rights
to each party to a contract. Although not everyone can have all
the rights to everything, a contract should surely
reflect some notion of justice to all concerned -- e.g.
reward for good effort, and punishment for evil acts.

If my ratings are anything like correct, then maybe
the BSD and Artistic Licences are the best all-round.
Of course, "control, freedom, satisfaction", not to mention
monetary reward, is multidimensional, and therefore my
numerical ratings are coarse at best.

Requests:

1.	Could you please contribute any new licence styles
	that are not in the above list?

2.	Could you please provide definitive sources for each
	licence that you contribute?

3.	COuld you please tell me if my assessments are
	wildly wrong?

My instincts tell me that this is _not_ a truly
linux-specific topic. And therefore some readers will
be tuning out of this discussion.

Therefore, I think we need a mug to accept
contributions on this topic, who would then stick the
results of discussion in an FAQ or similar sort of web page.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
