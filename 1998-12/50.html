Hi all!

I was recently pointed at this list (and group) from my pals at ProgSoc 
in Sydney. Much happiness and glee to find out there is a Linux group in 
my new home town.

On to the important stuff: We are doing a cleanup here at work and are 
chucking out a whole heap of obsolete gear, most of which does work, it's 
just old. For instance, I've nabbed a couple of old PC's to scavange 
parts and upgrade my own i386 at home (which should now have enough disk 
and memory, etc to handle a linux partition *yay*). There's quite a bit 
of stuff and it seems a shame to throw out stuff that works, so I figured 
I'd find someone like ProgSoc here in SA who might be able to use it.

There're bits and pieces from keyboards to old PS/2's, a couple of 
black&white Sun monitors, some modems (up to 14.4k I think).. the list 
goes on. If anyone is interested in getting some of this gear, drop me a 
line and we can attempt to arrange a time for you to pick the stuff up. 
I don't know anything about how you guys do things, but I figure some of 
this could provide good hacking/learning material if nothing else.
