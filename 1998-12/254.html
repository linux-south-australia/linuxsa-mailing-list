&gt; &gt;So what is the cheapest way to get RH5.2 ?
&gt; &gt;Buy the APC book ?
&gt; &gt;ben....... :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 1. I do not know of a really cheap way. In Oz it will cost $60-70 for the
&gt; 'official' boxed set.  Some $$oftware resellers ask around $100

Yes... forget "loss leader" pricing at the new Harvey Norman IMHO

(At least it was the *LATEST* RedHat boxed-sets they had for $109
Actually, I presume their going to do some mark-downs any day now
AS WELL AS more mark-downs after for Christmas sales...  But it's
not nice to hear that our local market's ignorance is being used
to its disadvantage...

&gt; -- avoid them!

You sound like somebody who "missed out on the '60's"...
avoiding them is an Ostrich's "head in a hole" tactic...

Better to ENGAGE them - as in Engaging the Enemy... ;) -
if you want to effect change in this market...

Anyone visiting this store is encouraged to make a big deal about
how OVER-PRICED RedHat is there...  Of course, make sure you say
how GOOD it is to see LINUX on the shelf in the same conversation:

"Boy, I'm sure glad that you guys are
 stocking the latest [RedHat] LINUX!!

 I just want you to know, however, that
 I bought mine for $59 (or $69) locally"

If this market continues to ACT LIKE BUMPKINS
it's going to be hit with BUMPKIN PRICING...

When we show (especially newcomers) that
we do our market surveying homework...
THEN we'll start seeing better pricing!

'applies to local Bookshops too, of course!

It's only when a supplier can keep a market ignorant
& QUIET that high prices get paid.  Make some NOISE!

Contrast:  Sheep... peacefully grazing in pastures.

(I recommend similar ways of responding to gov'ts...
e.g. over its 20-year MS-only contracting syndrome,
pokies, restrictive Trading Hours...)

&gt; Actually, $60 is reasonable when you remember that resellers have to
&gt; make a profit to stay in business and they have to have enough of a
markup
&gt; ( &gt;&gt; 100%) to be able to write off any left-over stock when the next
&gt; release comes out.  Try selling RH5.1 now!

In the US, the answer to the "Sell RH5.1" challenge is:

  Mark it down by maybe 50% (to or even *below* cost)
  to keep your Cash Flow up

  Result:  - People KNOW they're getting an old version -but-
           - People who might (otherwise) NOT try it... DO
           - More LINUX Users

By contrast, locally, if not all over Australia:

  Shops seem to be quite happy to use the Customers' ignorance
  against them... HOLDING prices at the same level as when the
  product was current...

  Result:  - People aren't quite as likely to try LINUX
           - Those who DO try it and find only OLD versions in shops
             may well feel disappointed when they realise the facts
             (contrast this with the competition's same world-wide
             release dates policy...)
             ...and, with the inherent strangeness & difficulty in
             finding LINUX software on the same shelf as they found
             the op sys, no great lust in generated for LINUX...
           - Less return-business for the shop(s) that act so...
           - Less LINUX Users

&gt; 2. Cheapbytes in the US of A &lt;www.cheapbytes.com&gt; do a pretty good 'bare'
&gt; CD for US$2-3 (that's right some are only US$1.99 each), however, the
&gt; shipping costs are a bit steep unless you are getting a dozen or more CDs

So, nobody wants to do an Australia-wide bulk buy...
split the big shipment into State User Group partials
and save more money...?  It *is* an option...

&gt; (Last time I bought from them, they charged US$11 to airmail up to 15
CDs,
&gt; so you can get them here for under Au$5 each if you buy in bulk).

So, at $14.95 the APC book is overpriced...
compare Win 98 Pocketbook for 8.95?  Did IT
sell-out like the LINUX Pocketbook?  If not,
then the *NEXT* LINUX Popcketbook, which IMHO
ought to contain/install the very latest kernel,
ought ALSO to be $8.95

Tell that to APC, will you Geoffrey...?  ;)

&gt; 3. If you have access to a CD-burner, burn a copy for under $3 - yes,
this
&gt; is legal, read the RedHat copyright notice.  However, 'time is money' so
&gt; this may not be as cheap as you might think.

It *has* to be cheaper than downloading...
at least for those who pay by the hour....

Look people, it can cost under $1.00 to
reproduce (say 200) CD-ROM's in Australia

When over 13 of us have spent $14.95 for
APC's LINUX PB, we have spent more than
it would cost to make 200 copies of your
favorite RH LINUX CD-ROM...

14 for the individuals and 186 to sell or
give away...

So, if you want to see LINUX use spread,
put your money together & make CD-ROM's

&gt; 4. The APC P'book. This is NOT a cost-effective way to get a $3 CD.  The
CD
&gt; is fine, but unless you want to spend a lot of time correcting it, throw
&gt; the book away.  IMO - it seems  that the book was written pre 5.2 and not
&gt; updated, in fact, I think that some parts of the book may have been
written
&gt; by people using something other than RedHat. There are many good
&gt; distributions of linux (Slackware, Debian etc) but please don't use one
of
&gt; these to write a RedHat book. Perhaps the 2nd edition will be better.  I
&gt; hope APC are not going to do a 'Billy Goats' and try to make a fortune
&gt; selling corrections   :-I 

I think the APC book is something to have
e.g. at a Trade Show or LINUX Business Lunch
sitting next to Windows 98's OEM CD-ROM & Manual

Which would be more appealing to your eye
& mind?  One that points you at *local*
sources of support?  Or one that mentions
only one (or a few) such sources...?

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; 6. Take a hard disk (in a computer if necessary) along to your local
Linux
&gt; User Group. This is only a valid option if you can afford to tie-up 600+M
&gt; of disk space and only if you actually have a local LUG.

That's the best idea I've heard...
provided you meant IDE Hard Drives
(SCSI documentation usually warns
that taking a drive from one SCSI-
controller to another is asking
for trouble... is this still true?)

Now the way to improve on it (albeit
at a cost) is with a Mobile Frame

(so computer cases can remain in place
and fingers can remain far from m/b's
& IDE cables; instead, just plug in a
disk-drive (in a mobile frame) and
lock it in place... i.e. BEFORE power-
ing up the computer; NOT Hot Swap...)

Preferably a more-or-less "LINUX SA
agreed" choice of IDE Mobile Frames
(small variations in size even with-
in one maker's product line happen)

low-cost (in bulk):  $30-40 (est.)
