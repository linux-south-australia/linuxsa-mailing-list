--------------------8&lt;---------------------------------------
&gt;The Linux hardware compatibility guide indicates that almost any x2, x4
&gt;and x6 speed ATAPI/IDE CDROM drives should work. However, given the
&gt;unavailibilty of new drives in that range just how far can I push the
&gt;compatibility envelope e.g.,would a x24 or x32 speed work with my Redhat
&gt;5.1 running the 2.0.35-1 kernel. My existing box with a x8 Mitsumi works
&gt;OK and this is outside the stated speed compatibility range???
--------------------8&lt;---------------------------------------

	I don't know much about the really technical aspects of CDROM Drives, for
my 2c worth, I have been using Mitsumi and Matsushita (Panasonic) drives,
speeds X4, X24, X32 and have not had a problem, now a Mitsumi CD Writer
that I am about to  try.
	I have however seen problems with some older CDROM's that have proprietary
interfaces to sound cards or the like, it is my understanding that they do
work with Linux but there are some other techniques required to get them to
work.
The problem I have seen is the Install boot disk did not find the CDROM.
	It is my understanding that if your CDROM drive has a standard IDE
interface to your motherboard it will most likely work, it would be a
matter of experience of people on this list who will hopefully advise you
of the ones they have had problems with and why.

Kind Regards
