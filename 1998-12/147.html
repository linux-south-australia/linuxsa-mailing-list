Heyas Again,

Also, I am running NT4 and RH5.2 on my machine. I *was* running NT on an NTFS
partition, and when I installed RH5.2 LILO stuffed up NTs boot info. If I remember
correctly, it recognised the NTPS as an OS/2 HPFS. Hence that was probably why it
stuffed it up for NT.

I am now running NT4 on a FAT16 partition, and LILO had no trouble installing
without stuffing the system up for NT. This may not be the most secure way to run a
system, but in many cases, FAT/NTFS isn't really that much of a system.

FYI, my system is a PII-300 with a 6.4Gb LBA HDD. I did have some fun trying to fix
the screwup thanks to the IDE ZIP which wouldn't let me "fdisk /mbr" the harddrive
from a dos boot floppy. But removing the drive from the CMOS setup solved that. I
seem to remember reading something about that somewhere...

I have two partitions for NT, for a total of 3Gb and the rest I left for RH, and I
did a "workstation" install straight off the CD. I have the main C: mounted on /nt4
and the d: mounted on /nt4data

&gt; &gt; I tried to dual boot a machine with Linux and NT without success. I now need
&gt; &gt; to remove Linux and reformat the disk so that I can reinstall NT.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I used Linux fdisk to remove all the partitions but now DOS fdisk and NT
&gt; &gt; both report that my disk size is only a small fraction of the total disk
&gt; &gt; size.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anybody know how I can get DOS fdisk to report the real capacity of my
&gt; &gt; disk and format it accordingly?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; I had a similar problem Stephen and I'm not sure I fixed it the best way but
&gt; what I did was used NT's format program in the installation procedure to delete
&gt; all partitions and then allocated 1.7Gb to NT and 1.5 I left unformatted. I then
&gt; finished installing NT and then went on to reinstall Linux. I tried to folow the
&gt; HowTo for an NT Linux Dual boot but I couldn't get it to work so I just use a
&gt; Boot Disk for Linux.  I hope this helps, has anyone had more success, If so
&gt; please send details.
