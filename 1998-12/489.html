&gt;&gt; I have a mail list with 140 subscribers for TIFCU (The Internet for
&gt;Commodore
&gt;&gt; Users) and my book (same title) has sold enough copies for us 1) to
&gt;afford our
&gt;&gt; Internet connection, and 2) &lt;grumble&gt; to pay taxes on the income earned. 
&gt;
&gt;Wonderful...  I suppose - from one angle - it is good that you are
&gt;achieving your
&gt;business goals...

On a less sarcastic note than this, I think it's good that someone is able
and willing to cater for C64 users. I don't have one myself, and I was
never a big fan of them, but lots of people still do...

&gt;
&gt;But from the point of view of helping build an IT capable community...

So what should be done instead? Ignore them? That doesn't build anything at
all...

&gt;
&gt;I really don't see being locked-in to a C-64 or (the
&gt;ever-so-slightly-better equipped)
&gt;C-128 helping your customers to achieve theirs.
&gt;

I doubt VERY MUCH that the customers bought a C64 just to get on the
internet. This merely provides a means for them to do so.

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but...
&gt;
&gt;Any software they get goes no where else... (granted that C-64 s/w might
&gt;go on a C-128... but is that anywhere else?)

Sould we eliminate Mac software since it can't go onto pure PC's, or PC
software since it can't go onto Macs then? How about BeOS software? Should
we scrap that as well?

&gt;
&gt;For H/W, compare to PCI expansion cards which - with a change of driver
&gt;S/W - can sometimes go from a IBM-compat. PC to a Mac.

Yeah only sometimes... most stuff can't - should we scrap all the stuff
that can't?

&gt;
&gt;Considering the price of repairs (which - I presume - may be another of the
&gt;side-lines that helps you achieve your business goals), slowness of floppy-
&gt;drives (Is there a hard drive for C-xx[x]'s?), etc. - all up - make me
&gt;conclude
&gt;that you're helping to create a Computer Underclass...
&gt;
&gt;I don't speak for any other Linux SA people, but I'd guess that some of
&gt;them
&gt;might consider what you're doing not unlike what Microsoft is doing... i.e.
&gt;helping to lock people into systems that have hidden costs and less than
&gt;optimal performance (*far* less, in the case of 8-bit Commodore technology)
&gt;

I'm sure most C64 users know what their computers are capable of. You've
obviously missed the point that some people don't have a choice, and are
simply working with what they have.
Should we stop supporting people with 486/306's as well, since their PC's
can't reasonably be upgraded? Are these people who only have 386/486
machines "locked in" as well?

&gt;At least, use of the heavy-weight Microsoft products yield presentable
&gt;docu-
&gt;ments that *their* customers can make money with... e.g. resumes for job-
&gt;hunting, newsletters/books, computer programs, etc.
&gt;
&gt;For all its "bloat" I'd have to say that the MS choice empowers its
&gt;users...
&gt;giving those who put their minds to it the opportunity to increase their
&gt;wealth
&gt;so that they can (later) afford Multi-CPU, 256 Mb RAM, 23 Gb Hard Drives...

And what if people don't want to create nice looking resume's, and print
24-bit graphics? Some people just want to read and send email, and you only
need 2 colors for that... the foreground, and the background.

&gt;
&gt;I believe that it is morally wrong to lead people down a dead-end road in
&gt;IT.
&gt;
The road is already there, All that's being done is another roadsign is
being put on it.

&gt;  People choose a dog that matches their personality  (I want a Golden,
&gt;myself)

And you're saying you'd shoot the dog as soon as it sprained an ankle?

&gt;
&gt;But to equate your clients with C-xx[x], saying that it is the perfect
&gt;match for them,
&gt;I think I would feel really *insulted* were I to be likened to computers
&gt;which:
&gt;
&gt;  - are slow, unreliable, costly to repair,

Yeah? I can get a C64 for about $5 from a garage sale, maybe another $50
for a monitor. You won't even get the LABOR for a computer repair for that
cheap.

&gt;  - have spares only available from used throw-aways,
&gt;  - can possibly affect users' vision, if TV used as display,

See previous point. :)

&gt;  - preclude access to video high-fidelity audio (e.g. RealAudio) from the
&gt;Internet,
&gt;  - don't seem to have much new software being developed for them these
&gt;days,
&gt;  - absorb users' excess cash without any chance of helping them
&gt;participate in the
&gt;    CREATIVE sides of the Internet (how many C-xx[x]-ers have web pages,
&gt;write
&gt;    programs, host webs, etc.)
&gt;  - (as a result) do not help users to develop a taste for "value for
&gt;money"

What extra money would a C64 absorb, aside from internet costs? If it can't
be upgraded, then there's nothing else to spend on it, right?

The internet isn't all about web pages... what is a blind person going to
do with nice graphics? Or a color-blind person going to do with 24-bit
color? Or a deaf person going to do with RealAudio or 16/32-bit sound?

&gt;
&gt;I presume you run an ISP for your "congregation"... good for business... 
&gt;;)

Sure would be... from an outsiders point of view, you can provide net
access EXTREMELY cheaply for a C64 user. No graphics/Real Audio/etc. means
less bandwidth used, which means less bandwidth paid for, which means a
higher profit :)

&gt;
&gt;I'm interested in building a community in which people choose options which
&gt;give better "value-for-money"... not just (apparently) "cheap" options that
&gt;cost
&gt;them much of value later.
&gt; 
&gt;Anyone who watches the "price-tumbles" of PC computers and seeks value-
&gt;for-EVEN-LESS-money will choose a 386 or better i.e. if money is a problem
&gt;for them and IMHO be making a much better decision for themselves, their
&gt;children and the larger community.

If someone offered me a Ferrari for $10,000 I wouldn't buy it. Even though
it would be outstanding value for money, I just couldn't afford $10,000 -
let alone the price of repairs, tuning, petrol, etc.etc. Sure i'd LIKE to
have a Ferrari, but i'm a realist :)

However, I could probably get parts for an old "jalopy" quite easily from a
wreckers, since a LOT of people had the same make/model as MY jalopy, and I
could just go into the wreckers and get the part cheap, or go and take it
from one of the wrecks myself. When did you last see a Ferreri in a
wrecking yard?


&gt;
&gt;Now, I grant you this:  If somebody's parent[s] squanders the family income
&gt;at the pokies, leaving very little for tech'y toys, etc. then - in such a
&gt;case,
&gt;there *might* be an excuse to go back to the dark ages of 8-bit C-xx[x]'s.
&gt;
&gt;In *such* a family (which has demonstrated its ignorance of value-for-money
&gt;by losing $ at the pokies), it would be quite consistent with handing down
&gt;a tradition from one generation to the next; no less foolish, but
&gt;consistent.
&gt;

Now come on... this last section is COMPLETELY unfair and irrelevant. Just
because someone can't afford the latest model computer doesn't mean that
they just spent their money unwisely. Maybe the money wasn't there in the
first place?

&gt;Anyway, have a nice holiday!  ;)
&gt;
Except for those that can't afford it, who should just be forgotten about,
right?

&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
