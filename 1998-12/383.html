&gt;1. Can anyone tell me if there is a serious
&gt; configuration-file-clobbering problem with such an upgrade?
&gt; (In this case I would have to backup everything and
&gt; put back the personalised config files one by one.)

The experience I have had when upgrading my system from RH5.0 to RH5.2
(i know - not a big step, but still), and when upgrading packages
manually was that RPM would save any config files that were being 
overwritten with the extension ".rpmsave". Although the config files
are still there backed up - it is most likely not possible to 
just copy it over the new one, as the format of the file is likely
to change somewhat over time and new releases. I notice that
you wish to upgrade from RH4.0 to 5.2 which is a large step.

I may be wrong, but the only real solution that I see is to upgrade
the system and then, using the backed up config files as a guide only,
reconfigure the system to the state it was at before the upgrade.

&gt;Would anyone recommend that I backup everything, then
&gt;reformat the disk, and then selectively put back the files that I want?
&gt;I hope very much that this is not the solution.
&gt;If this is what I must do, I'm in for a long, long re-setup of
&gt;the system.

I would always recommend backing up important data/config files
when doing anything to a system that has the (however unlikely)
possible outcome of corrupted files and lost data.
