Heyas All,

I've been pondering the problem of forcing my ppp connection to stay up.
I tried to compile diald but it was coming up with millions (well,
screens and screens and screens!!) or error messages. I could probably
track the problem down if I had time to sit down and play with it, but I
am a bit short of time at the moment. But who isn't at this time of
year? :)

Anyways, I was thinking of writing a crontab script to run every hour
and check to see if ppp is up, and if not, then bring it up again. Now I
know that that isn't scrictly forcing it up, but the server being
disconnected for a maximum of an hour is better than the 4 or 5 days it
currently is when the server is running unattended, which is more of a
problem in the holidays than any time else.

My question is about the format of the cron scripts. I've never actually
written a script (except the ppp scripts) under Linux, so I just need
some pointers about how to structure the scripts and the commands and
things. Is there any documention on cron? I don't have the linux box in
front of me at the moment, so I appologise if there is info in the man
pages...

Any info about the format of the scripts and testing to see if the ppp
link is up would be great, although I can probably work the 2nd out
given a few minutes to tinker.

Cheers
Dazz
