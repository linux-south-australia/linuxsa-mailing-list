&gt;  From Win NT Server 4.0 Resource Guide
&gt;  (p.78):
&gt; 
&gt;    "SCSI disks should always be low-
&gt;     level formatted when put on a new
&gt;     controller.
&gt; 
&gt;     The reason for this is that the
&gt;     translation in use on the disk
&gt;     varies from controller to con-
&gt;     troller, and can even vary be-
&gt;     tween two identical controllers
&gt;     based on the controllers settings."

This confuses me a bit, SCSI uses LBA, so there should never
be any translation issues.  The only 'translation' related area
which I can recall is if there are different sector sizes in 
different zones, you can ensure that the sector size is equivalent.

I feel (although I can't confirm) that this NT RG comment is a
cover-all line.  Glossing over the real details that would allow
an deeper understanding of the motivations for doing a low level format.

In general there should be no technical reason for doing a low level
format if the drive has been used as a 512 byte/sector disk on a different
controller.

On the topic of trusting a vendors comment, I don't think that that is
always the best option.  Since a vendor will take the path of least
cost and (near) guarranteed (sp?) solutions.  In most cases there is a 
number of solutions of which the most appropriate should be taken.
For example, if you have data on a disk, the controller dies, you buy a
different controller but (feel from the NT RG) that you must re-format the
disk.   If you look at the variables, you might be able work out a better
solutions.  

Educated comment is usually a bit better since it will be based on the
particular situation, rather than a vendors sledgehammer approach which will
have known results.  

Regards,

Matt
