Hey All,

Thanks to everyone who helped me track down what I was missing in the
tar command. One little "f" !  Oh well.

Anyways, I got that installed, haven't finished configuring it or
anything yet. That can wait. What I need to get working is diald, but
when I try to do the "make depend" I get a whole tonne of messages
looking like this:

/usr/include/linux/in.h:104: warning: `INADDR_NONE' redefined
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:130: warning: this is the location of the
previous definition
/usr/include/linux/in.h:114: warning: `INADDR_UNSPEC_GROUP' redefined
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:140: warning: this is the location of the
previous definition
/usr/include/linux/in.h:115: warning: `INADDR_ALLHOSTS_GROUP' redefined
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:141: warning: this is the location of the
previous definition
/usr/include/linux/in.h:116: warning: `INADDR_MAX_LOCAL_GROUP' redefined

/usr/include/netinet/in.h:143: warning: this is the location of the
previous definition

I didn't count how many screenfuls of that shot past, but it was a lot!!
Then when I do the "make" like it says in the readme, it gives a whole
stack more warnings like that and a few more that look like:

/usr/include/netinet/in.h:36: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_IPIP'
/usr/include/linux/in.h:29: conflicting types for `IPPROTO_TCP'
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:37: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_TCP'
/usr/include/linux/in.h:30: conflicting types for `IPPROTO_EGP'
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:38: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_EGP'
/usr/include/linux/in.h:31: conflicting types for `IPPROTO_PUP'
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:39: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_PUP'
/usr/include/linux/in.h:32: conflicting types for `IPPROTO_UDP'
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:40: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_UDP'
/usr/include/linux/in.h:33: conflicting types for `IPPROTO_IDP'
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:41: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_IDP'
/usr/include/linux/in.h:35: conflicting types for `IPPROTO_RAW'
/usr/include/netinet/in.h:45: previous declaration of `IPPROTO_RAW'

then quits with

make: *** [diald.o] Error 1

I don't even get as far as the "make install".... Am I missing something
again?

Lotsa thanks in advance
Dazz
