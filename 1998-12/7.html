Rob,

That's an extremely scary story.
I'm just about to go onto the net myself as a real IP host open
to the world. And obviously I have to worry about the hacking.

SE Net do not allow CGI scripts, as far as I know -- not by customers,
and TAFE certainly do not allow individuals in their organisation
to provide them. And now I know why.

But on a Unix box, surely it must be possible to make all CGI scripts
run as user "nobody", or as the user who wrote the script,
and then the damage should be very much limited.

I'd bet that someone else out there knows the answers!....

I can't determine from the article whether the machine was
unix or windows based, but the reference to "directories" rather than
"folders" suggests that it was unix of some sort.

My question:
If you configure the server to run CGI scripts as "nobody"
(e.g. apache can be made to always run as "nobody"), then
isn't it true that no harm can be done to anything outside
world-writable areas?

In the article, they say that they didn't do backups because of
the overheads on a heavily loaded system.
Surely this must be invalid for a unix system  doing the standard
sort of total or diffe\rential backup.
For instance, with SunOS, I've often run "backup" on a running
system, and there's not much of a problem.
One could NFS the machine's drives across to another machine, and
back it up there etc. etc.

This story convinces me that I will have to backup any disk drive
which I expose to the net!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
