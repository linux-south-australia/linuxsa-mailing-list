&gt; The Boxed set I bought from Netcraft the day before the last LinuxSA

&gt; distributions of it be any different?

The 2.0.36 kernel was released after Red Hat 5.2. The 2.0.36 kernel in 5.2
is something like 2.0.36pre7. The pre patches between 2.0.35 and 2.0.36
were mostly very stable. The earlier pre patches included the more
significant bug fixes with the later ones containing concentrating on
improving a few drivers (including ISDN and Adaptec) and enhancements.

Many people have criticised Red Hat for not delaying their release
(again), but there is nothing that can be done. There are so many major
software announcements in the Linux world that there is no break to take
advantage of.

Red Hat may have released (or might release) an unofficial upgrade to
2.0.36. If they do it would almost certainly be included on their the next
set of RH52 cds, just like their normal errata.

Regards,
Mark
