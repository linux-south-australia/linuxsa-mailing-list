 &gt; Good paper... and I'd just like to ask:
 &gt; If those who care to Advocate LINUX are serious
 &gt; (and not "closet" would-be high-priced consultants)
 &gt; ...why isn't it reasonable to expect more of the
 &gt; LINUX application (even server) software to in-
 &gt; stall (almost) fully configured & "ready-to-go"?

Part 1 of the answer:  Why does it matter whether an advocate is
a high-priced consultant?  Why do you assume that high-priced consultants
aren't "serious"?  Your question strikes me as schitzophrenic, because
on the one hand you're bemoaning perceived lacklustre commercial 
support and on the other hand you have an unstated bias against
commercialism.

Part 2 of the answer:  Almost all software does install ready-to-go.

Part 2a:  Where the OS isn't easy to install, it's usually due to crappy
PC hardware.  PCs are atrocious and it's amazing anything works on them
at all.  We can thank our lucky stars that open-source OSs have less 
problems with this than commercial OSs.

Part 2a:  Where applications aren't easy to install, it's because people
(like you) have noticed inevitable installation problems then failed to
submit fixes back to the authors.  Solution:  Fix it and submit patches.
Don't rely on others to fix it and submit patches because other people
probably don't think it's difficult.

 &gt; No big deal?  True for most, but realise that
 &gt; we're trying to move *down* the expertise-
 &gt; pyramid IMHO, in order to get more people
 &gt; "in the door" we've got to make the inside-
 &gt; environment even more friendly than the
 &gt; competition.

Who's "we"?  If you see a need, produce something to address it.  

Who's "the competition"?  We don't need to compete to be successful.

Microsoft has spent 20 years making people think that unqualified
monkeys can manage computing resources.  At the close of the 20th
century, its just starting to become obvious to the man-in-the-street
that this idea is and always has been totally ludicrous.  Whether
you use Linux, some other UNIX or NT you still need a qualified 
staffmember to properly install and manage your enterprise;  Qualified
UNIX people don't have trouble with installing UNIX software on Linux,
just like qualified NT people don't have trouble fixing MS problems
("There, I rebooted it so it's ok now.").  Unqualified people have 
trouble in both areas, and there's an ample supply of unqualified 
people around to testify that both environments are configuration 
minefields.

The user-friendliness problem comes from expecting system management
to be easy.  It isn't, never has been, and probably never will be.  No
amount of crying, "Why isn't it simple?" will fix that; You just get
in a qualified person who has sufficient skill levels to be able to
spend an hour doing something that takes you eight hours and the
problem is solved (that's where high priced consultants come into the
picture, and that's why their customers know they're worth the money).
Or you invest the requisite 8 hours, spend another 4 hours writing patches,
and submit them back to the authors (who may integrate the patches if
they think it's worth it).

 &gt; Simplify, simplify... there's enough to do
 &gt; (e.g. just feeding 5 billion people is getting
 &gt; to be a big job... and fixing the Year 2000
 &gt; bug) in the "real world" not to have to do a
 &gt; lot of "trivia" like fiddling with file access
 &gt; permissions, after installing software.  ;)

So simplify it.  That's what open-source is about, you know -- If you
see a problem, do something abou tit.

Alternatively, pay someone who doesn't think it's actually hard and
get them to do it for you so you can run off and feed your starving
billions (or play Quake, or whatever).

 &gt; BTW in my search for material on John Lions
 &gt; (yesterday), I found a ref. to a dated publi-
 &gt; cation:
 &gt;   "The UNIX Haters Handbook"
 &gt; Has anyone seen/written one for the competition
 &gt; (yet...)?

Why don't you write one?
