Mark and Alan,

&gt;Mark,

&gt;Thanks for those reponses.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  &gt; At the moment, I have two hypotheses:
&gt;&gt;  &gt; 1.	There's a bug in the ppp.o driver which makes it
&gt;&gt;  &gt; 	not wake up properly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Highly unlikely.  PPP has been bashed on by too many people over
&gt;&gt; too many years.
&gt;
&gt;I tend to agree. But this might be "the last bug".
&gt;

Actually that's kinda funny considering we have to do a small
hack to pppd 2.3.5 every time we compile it (from a fresh pkg),
just to make it run stable. It only requires hard-commenting
an "IF DEFINED" section about your kernel version but until we
did, it was hopeless.

It has been my own observation that pppd has been getting more
features but less stability with every version leading up to 2.3.5
It DEFINATELY ISN'T anyway near as reliable as ver 2.2.0 ever was.

If it weren't for supporting PAP logins, we never would have
gone through all the dramas of finding which bit of code
to kludge to get it to work. And even then, as soon as we start to 
get "pppd[xxxx]: ioctl(PPPIOCSASYNCMAP): I/O error(5)" messages
in the syslog (and they aren't due to the uplink being dead),
we had might as well just reboot the sucker right there because
it won't get any better till you do. :-\

I must admit, however, I don't think pppd is to blame in Alan's
case either. It was just that I couldn't believe that no-one
else had found the newer versions to be as shonky as we had???

Could it be that it is biased towards Red Hat libraries or something
similar? (we are running all slackware servers)

Just curious,
-Daniel

PS: I'm not disputing the quality of pppd on Mark's or Alan's systems,
(or more importantly their judgements on it's quality) just that the
case is simply not the same for us. :-)
