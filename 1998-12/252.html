&gt;So what is the cheapest way to get RH5.2 ?
&gt;Buy the APC book ?
&gt;ben....... :-)
&gt;
1. I do not know of a really cheap way. In Oz it will cost $60-70 for the
'official' boxed set.  Some $$oftware resellers ask around $100 -- avoid
them!  Actually, $60 is reasonable when you remember that resellers have to
make a profit to stay in business and they have to have enough of a markup
( &gt;&gt; 100%) to be able to write off any left-over stock when the next
release comes out.  Try selling RH5.1 now!
2. Cheapbytes in the US of A &lt;www.cheapbytes.com&gt; do a pretty good 'bare'
CD for US$2-3 (that's right some are only US$1.99 each), however, the
shipping costs are a bit steep unless you are getting a dozen or more CDs
(Last time I bought from them, they charged US$11 to airmail up to 15 CDs,
so you can get them here for under Au$5 each if you buy in bulk).
3. If you have access to a CD-burner, burn a copy for under $3 - yes, this
is legal, read the RedHat copyright notice.  However, 'time is money' so
this may not be as cheap as you might think.
4. The APC P'book. This is NOT a cost-effective way to get a $3 CD.  The CD
is fine, but unless you want to spend a lot of time correcting it, throw
the book away.  IMO - it seems  that the book was written pre 5.2 and not
updated, in fact, I think that some parts of the book may have been written
by people using something other than RedHat. There are many good
distributions of linux (Slackware, Debian etc) but please don't use one of
these to write a RedHat book. Perhaps the 2nd edition will be better.  I
hope APC are not going to do a 'Billy Goats' and try to make a fortune
selling corrections   :-I 
4a. Perhaps you are just looking for some opinions on the APC thingy?
Well, my opinion is not very high.  It was a good idea that lost in the
translation.  Too many errors for a beginners' book and $15 is too much to
pay for a CD.
5. Downloading a distribution direct from RedHat is fine in theory but not
practical.  There are mirrors in Oz, but unless you can get a direct
connection, forget about it, Telstra lines are just not up to it.
6. Take a hard disk (in a computer if necessary) along to your local Linux
User Group. This is only a valid option if you can afford to tie-up 600+M
of disk space and only if you actually have a local LUG.

Hope this helps, Ben. One of my hobby-horses, I do think that software
resellers who are not rip-off merchants should be encouraged.

Cheers from warm-and-sunny RedRock
