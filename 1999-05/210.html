&gt; with samba (or nfs), you don't even need to copy the file in the first
&gt; place! Just access it in-place.

I can understand where Nick is coming from.  

For a locally connected machine using file sharing is fine.

When you are working on a remote host, sometimes there may be situations
where FTP/HTTP/rcp whatever may not be available (or even across firewalls).
Even administrative restrictions may stop FTP or whatever both in and out.

In cases like this if you use a telnet proxy across you have a link to
the other system.  You only have one link though.  Hence your only 
datapath is your terminal.  This is very similar to your old style BBS
dialup.

Hence using this datapath as your file transfer mechanism is quite handy.
Sit on your login and 'sz' your file.  Although I don't say use it as the
primary means of transfer, it is a handy 'alternative' path.  In some cases
you might find that the the data being transferred is a prerequisite for
the next step you want to do, resulting in situations where irrespective 
of what transport mechanism you do use, you will be waiting for the file to
transfer.

But really it is horses for courses.  But knowing of terminal programs that
use telnet that can do that is something useful to have for those unfortunate
times that you only have one data-channel and need to transfer data.

Regards,

Matt
