Heyas
Didn't you send exactly the same message at the beginning of the week?
According to my email, you did anyway.

Now, I notice you didn't receive any replies to your original post.
However, if you were reading other posts that have been going on, you
will understand why.
Your question does not actually ask a straight question, nor does it
give any information that could be used to help answer some of the
questions you are obliquely asking.
(Eg: My machine runs out of ram - why?
     amd doesnt work - why?
)

However, the only information you volunteer is that "we are using redhat
4.2 with a serial ISP link."
I have NFI what use a "serial ISP link" is going to be for us to
diagnose a problem regarding memory and filesystems.
You don't even tell use how much total ram your machine has, let alone a
process listing dump showing us what you are running, how much ram each
is using, etc. and how much is left over free, etc. etc.

However, I suspect if you did even look at this information yourself,
you would be able to figure out your problem on your own!
Please, LinuxSA is not your personal consultant! We don't get paid for
this, so if you want help, try to make it obvious what you want, and try
to do some work yourself!

If you took the time out to check how much free memory you have, and
free swap space, and then looked at how much ram each program was using,
I think you'd probably find the answers to your questions are that
you've got a pitiful amount of main ram and next-to-no-swap-space. (If
your machine is running redhat 4.2 I'm assuming it's pretty ancient.)

If you don't know how to tell how much ram your machine has, or how much
is free, then RTFM!

If you don't know how to RTFM, then go out and borrow someones APC
handbook - they're a great place to start for newbies.

Seeyas :)

&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; my linux server keeps getting out of memory errors after it runs for a
&gt; while. it comes up with out of memory error inetd and sendmaild.
&gt; I have been looking at a problem with amd which stops it from restarting
&gt; occasionally.
&gt; "rpc.mountd/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S60nfs: usr/sbin/rpc.mountd    no such file or
&gt; directory" it has had this error for a while but it seems to hang when
&gt; booting when it starts amd.
&gt; i have tried a few things and read a few man pages but after a bit of time
&gt; it runs out of memory.
&gt; we are using redhat 4.2  with a serial isp link
&gt; 
&gt; thankyou
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you
