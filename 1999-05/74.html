I must agree that it would be best to keep the lists complete even though
more experienced users may find questions from less experienced users,
like myself, annoying.

Whilst people like myself may ask rather inane and sometimes rather
obvious questions to some, I would not ask them if I were able to find the
information. Perhaps a quote from Sams (publishers) Special Edition Using
Linux: `Linux needs to be managed' - I've never managed a computer system
before and looking for specific pieces of information is very much like
looking for needles in haystacks.

On the other hand I have been, every now and then, joining in on
conversations at Yahoo.Com (Computers / Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBsd) forum.
I have been able to answer a significant amount of basic questions and
additionally I have successfully explained what Linux is to a number of
people who were simply bombarded with computer techno-jargon clap-trap.

The `Newbies' - if you MUST use that phrase - can be a nuisance, but we
have all been `newbies' for something at some time. Some will leave and
some will stay; those who stay will also contributed.

David.
