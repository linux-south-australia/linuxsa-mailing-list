&gt; Geez! I hate that word `newbie'. It's condescending, impolite and most
&gt; anti-community minded.
&gt;
&gt; Nonetheless, I stay on the list because I am able to assist some people
&gt; with their problems; I do this directly - I refuse to copy answers to
&gt; so-called Newbie questions to LinuxSA because the others, especially those
&gt; who make replies such as I have quoted, know them. Don't they?
&gt;
&gt; Finally, because I am a community minded person concerned with the ill-will
&gt; that the various debates re: newbie questions etc have been debated on this
&gt; list, ALL newbies should feel free to email their queries to me DIRECT at
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@senet.com.au">lloy0076@senet.com.au</A>
&gt;
&gt; I shall endeavour to find some sort of sensible answer through whatever
&gt; means I am able to and get the answer DIRECT to you.
&gt;
&gt; Let me tell you, I refuse to tell you that your questions are stupid, that
&gt; you are a newbie or any other such condescneding, ridiculous terminology as
&gt; this. Theree are many people on this list who will help so-called newbies
&gt; with their questions, but there are a VOCAL few who insist on flaming them
&gt; for their so-called stupid questions.
&gt; No question is stupid. Either ask them, or ask me!

David the problem with your invitation to me seems to be two fold a) Are you
sure that you can answer all of the potential questions by yourself if people
email you direct and b) If you are so community minded why are you inviting
people to ask questions outside the community.
I am a novice Linux user (12 months) but mainly because of time constraints as
I don't have any formal computer training and 'self-taught' is a slow route to
competence.  However I have been a member of the LinuxSA community for most of
that time and have learnt as much from reading about others problems and the
various community responses as I have from my own 'discoveries'.  If newbies
dont ask questions on this list not only do they miss out on the communities
corporate knowledge but those of us who don't have a direct question to the
group fail to benefit from their journey of discovery.
There is some occasional flaming on this list but so in life , so in
cyber-space, but for the most part this list is supportive and tolerant.  The
responses here are nowhere near as denigrating or codescending as I have
received from mebers of the WinNT fraternity and Linux in my experience for the
absolute novice is easier to learn and use if you are prepared to do the work.
My apologies for the punctuation for those who find it a concern correct
grammar is not my forte'.
