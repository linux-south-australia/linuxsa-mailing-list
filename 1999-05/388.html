well not quite.

i dont want to mount the cdrom, but call a program to do
.....things.....

i've looked at the autofs package, and it looks good. But... it is only
activated when a user tries to access a path. The autofs deamon receives
the request, and then mounts the resource in question.

autofs also has the ability to run a program (e.g, instead of "mount",
like a script that pings machine to find the fastest etc.), which is
what i want, but it still initiated by a user.

I have noticed that when the cdrom tray is closed, the drive light comes
on. I realise this may be drive-type specific, but it may indicate that
at this point in time the drive is talking to the IDE controller, and
therefore possibly the kernel. I have also noticed the message "hdc:
media changed" come up, but again only during a mount or ioctl() call.

What I'm wondering is what does the kernel know about cdrom drives? Does
it know when the drive is opened and therefore closed?

I've looked through the kernel source, which has been helpfull, but i
dont know enough about how the kernel operates in repect to devices to
know whereto start looking.

I did manage to learn how to make a nifty (albeit kludgy and some will
say ugly) bit of c-code to open the cd ...
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/cdrom.h&gt;
int main(void) { /* yes!! int!! :) */
  int cdrom;
  if((cdrom = open("/dev/hdc", O_RDONLY))==-1)
    perror("error opening");
  if(ioctl(cdrom, CDROMEJECT)==-1)
    perror("error ejecting");
  return(0);
}
