Please read this with at least a grin. To all LINUX users, I am not saying
that because it took me 30 secs that I, or Windows, or Deplhi should be held
in high regard (definetely should, but hey were all surrounded by friends
here, pity they are someone elses, &lt;grin&gt;)

Controversy, controversy! Please forgive any transgressions.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't consider cut and paste "cool", in fact I find it uncool.
&gt;
&gt;What on earth is wrong with cut and paste?  I assume you know that I'm
&gt;talking about the unix commands, not the windows commands......
&gt;

Tell me how much more can be read into 'cut' and 'paste'.

&gt;&gt; Ok some M$
&gt;&gt; software crashes. So does some Linux software. It's not a case of M$
can't
&gt;&gt; write software without bugs and the Linux community can, untrue. Bugs are
&gt;&gt; fixed more often (well fixed!) in OSS software than M$ does true.
&gt;
&gt;True.  Oh so true.  Bugs are definitely fixed in OSS software.  And
&gt;generally not fixed quickly in non-OSS software.  We all know the reasons
&gt;for that.
&gt;
&gt;Buuut..  that's good.  I like having bugs fixed quickly.  Don't you?

Did I say I didn't ?

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Don't just lump all of M$ together and go SHIT and Linux - GOLD.
&gt;
&gt;Did I do that?  *re-reads previous email*

Never said YOU did, this was in relation to all people who dislike
microsoft, just happened to stand on a soapbox here. Note a soapbox is not a
position well suited to directly having a go at one person, unless they are
the only ones there. I did mention at the end of the email that I stepped
off of a soapbox.... I also have sent you a public apology for inferring
that I was just having a go at you but that was before this, so pretty much
ignore me here!

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can we can the M$ bashing in this list and concentrate really on the
&gt;&gt; concentrate on the important things like hmm Linux and Linux related
&gt;&gt; problems. We can sit and feel smug that we have a Superior OS (which is
&gt;&gt; true!) but don't criticise just because it's M$. I really haven't
&gt;
&gt;e-Hem.  Did I critisise anything I critisised purely because it's MS?  I
&gt;gave many mant many examples of the sorts of bugs the software I have
&gt;recently been forced to use contains.  I don't believe I've slagged off
&gt;windows just because it's windows.  Have I?

&gt;

See above comment from me!

&gt;&gt; heard any
&gt;&gt; sling off at Mac, Sun Microsystems (hmm it's Unix, why should we I
hear!),
&gt;&gt; Be (of BeOS fame, is that the Company name, doesn't matter, you get the
&gt;&gt; idea!).
&gt;
&gt;Truuuee...   *rubs chin*...  but how many of us, comparitively, use MacOS,
&gt;Solaris, etc etc as opposed to windows?  There may just be something in
&gt;that.
&gt;

Yeah well, umm I had to support Macs for 2 years in one job (sending shivers
down spine) and that was not fun. But hey let's not go there

&gt;&gt; &lt;steps off of own soapbox!&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Rob.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; P.S. I do not advocate M$, and I know I am a slight hypocrite
&gt;&gt; (nobody needs
&gt;&gt; point this out). The M$ shows that I am slinging off at Microsoft, but
you
&gt;&gt; must admit the $ is accurate in terms of their money making
&gt;&gt; ability, I think
&gt;&gt; they are getting their own printing press shortly!
&gt;
&gt;Good to hear.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well..  there you have it.
&gt;
&gt;:)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; An advocacy experience:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; After dutifully explaining the benefits of Linux to someone in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; education market,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm feeling quite depressed (yet again) as they have just gone out and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; purchased a room full beautiful PC's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with Windows 98, obviously pre-installed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone out there have any good news?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;well..  I've spent all day using cut, paste and grep in script files to
&gt;&gt; &gt;parse text files.  I've done everything I've needed to do (basically
&gt;&gt; produce
&gt;&gt; &gt;a standardised name and address database from lots of little
&gt;&gt; bits) in less
&gt;&gt; &gt;than half the time it would have taken me using M$ "tools".
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I've also been recording bug after bug after bug after bug in MS
&gt;&gt; Access as
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; &gt;create a database interface that my boss can use.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;eg, Jet won't import a file which has more than one "." in its name.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;And it won't even -look- at text files unless they have CR/LF...
&gt;&gt; unlike my
&gt;&gt; &gt;unix files, which have CR only.  It gives me a good error
&gt;&gt; though..  "Error:
&gt;&gt; &gt;Overflow.  [OK]"
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Excel has real hassles saving as text files.. it spasmodically
&gt;&gt; puts quotes
&gt;&gt; &gt;around number figures because they have more characters than it expects.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Importing fixed-width ascii files into excel is a pain, because
&gt;&gt; it looks at
&gt;&gt; &gt;the first few records to see how long every other record in the file
will
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; &gt;and then fucks up when you try to change the field sizes.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm just about to start installing linux as our primary smb file server
&gt;&gt; here
&gt;&gt; &gt;at work.  It's also going to do internet sharing (ipmasq) and
&gt;&gt; proper email
&gt;&gt; &gt;handling, and an intranet, and it's not going to crash every ten minutes
&gt;&gt; &gt;like our current (albeit windows 98) machine.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Microsoft products suck if you want to do anything cool with them.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Unix products rule for everything cool.  If you want to parse a
&gt;&gt; text file,
&gt;&gt; &gt;get information, use funky cut and paste and grep &c commands, and have
a
&gt;&gt; &gt;system that generally knows what the fuck you're talking about, use
unix.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Linux, specifically :)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I truly pity these poor souls who just purchased that roomfull
&gt;&gt; of hell and
&gt;&gt; &gt;trouble.  Maybe soon people will learn...
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Bye all.  Back to work.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
