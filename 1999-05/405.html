&gt;&gt;I have a (perhaps misguided) need to install multiple copies of Linux on a
&gt;&gt;single machine (along with a copy of Win 9x).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;However, they currently boot only one copy of vmlinux (the one on the
&gt;&gt;partition where I last ran lilo from).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;can anyone think of any other
&gt;&gt;problems I am likely to have?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I currently have Redhat, Slackware, Win98 and WINNT on one machine.
&gt;
&gt;The two linux's (linii?) each have their own partition on the HD, which they
&gt;consider to be "/".
&gt;Each crossmounts the others partition something like this:
&gt;
&gt;/dev/hda1 is redhat, also mounts /dev/hda2 as /Slackware
&gt;/dev/hda2 is slackware, also mounts /dev/hda1 as /Redhat
&gt;
&gt;Now each has their own /etc/lilo.conf, which points to the right vmlinuz for
&gt;each system. That is,
&gt;they both have to match and have equivalent corresponding entries. It doesnt
&gt;matter where I run
&gt;lilo from, the MBR gets a valid entry to boot either system (or the MS
&gt;ones).

Ahhh, that is neat, at the cost of having to ensure that lilo.conf in each
area is up-to-date, incase you run lilo from any one of them.

That actually solves my problem better than a common /boot.

So what I would have in lilo.conf is:

image=/distro1/boot/vmlinuz
	label=distro1
image=/distro2/boot/vmlinuz
	label=distro2

etc.

What about map files?

&gt;The reason this works is that the lilo boot process does NOT use the
&gt;filesystem as such (I think!).

Indeed. When you run lilo, it builds sufficient info onto LILO's config
that it can find where on the disk vmlinuz is.  As long as I can use LBA, I
will be ok.  If I can't use LBA, then I might have to think more carefully
about /boot.

&gt;I havent encountered any particular problems with this setup.
&gt;
&gt;cheers
