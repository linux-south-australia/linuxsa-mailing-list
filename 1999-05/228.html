Hey all,

I have recently installed an Intel EtherExpress 16 into my debian linux box,
and with some heavy assistance from a friend, managed to get it recognised
by the system.

I need to use BNC connector, but when it booted up the card automatically
assumed that it was using RJ-45.  So I used the Software Setup for the card
to change it over to BNC manually.  This worked fine, and after running a
board diag (that it passed successfully) I rebooted into linux.  Linux
recognised it fine, but then it came up with an error when trying to send
packets over the network.  I have tried using a different cable only to have
the same affect.  I know that this cards BNC was working in the last PC that
it was in...

Anyone had a similar problem?  Is there any diag software that I can use
under linux to try and figure out what the heck is goin on?  I make this
disclaimer...Im a newbie...fresh as they come...but very willing to learn
:)

Cheers,

remnant
