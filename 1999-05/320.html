&gt; I am still interested in the Sangoma WANpipes if anyone else wants to give

They look really useful.

Note that the lack of a serial interface can mean big dollars
in hired test gear if you need to debug at the protocol level.

Fortunately, the Sangoma device driver set seems to come
with a good link-level dump utility.  If you are considering
alternative products, look for debug software.

The Linux Journal review had an axe to grind on Linux routers
versus specialised routers, which is a shame as both have
their place and all the review ended up doing is turning
off data comms people with the obvious hyperbole.


There's little advantage in creating a Linux-based frame relay
switch.  The PC architecture simply doesn't scale to the number
of interfaces required.  IRQs run out far too quickly and the
card-oriented physical layout increases the semiconductor
component count (as you can't use 4 x drivers, etc) making
PC-based routers uncompetitive unless significant economies
of scale are present (as with ethernet cards).

Where a Linux based router does come into its own is at the
edge.  Any 486 or better PC can drive two low-speed interfaces.

And it also makes routers somewhat redundant.  There's a
lot to be said for plugging your WAN interface directly
into your web server and firewall.

At the edge, the choice between Linux router and a more
traditional router becomes one of risk management.  This
can be helped along significantly if the PC is tailored
for routing applications (network interfaces not on
motherboard, root partition on IDE flash disk, mirrored
disks, brand-name bog-standard parts).
