Natalia,

Here's the deal.  You say that you feel put off Linux for some of the
things that you read on this list.  You say that there is no-one to talk
to about it and that Linux is not easy to get used to in comparison to
other OSs.

I am expert with CP/M, Apple ][ DOS, Apple ][ ProDOS, Apple /// SOS,
Unix of many flavours, Macintosh OS, MS-DOS, Windows 3, Windows 9x, UCSD
p-System; while not expert, I have more than adequate skills with VMS,
NOS, NOS/BE and Windows NT; and I have passing familiarity with MVS.
In addition I have skills ranging from meagre to expert in other operating
systems which are simply too little-known to be worth mentioning.  In
all of my experience with quite different operating systems I found Unix
one of the easier to learn.  It's command list is neither more nor less
intuitive than any of the others.  For example, to get a catalogue of
files under MS-DOS you use the dir command; under Unix you use ls.
Neither is particuarly obvious; both are quite memorable.  Text editing
under Unix is easy, and of course you have a range of editors including
pico, which is a powerless no-brainer, up to emacs, the Swiss Army Knife
of editors, which is only usable after completing a three year degree
in computing and cognitive sciences.  Under, for example, Apple ][ DOS
there is no text editor, unless you consider "10 REM Program to display
Hello World" to be a text editor.  Which it's not.  VMS has text editors,
and they are at least as terse and complex as vi; actually more so.
Even Windows is no paragon of ease of use.  For example, no matter how
long I stare at Windows NT, I simply cannot fathom the logic behind
clicking on the Start button in order to shut the thing down.

Natalie, you say Linux is not easy to get used to; I say you have been
trained in something else and are peeved because Linux is different.
Bad luck.

You say there is no-one to talk to about Linux; well what are we doing
here?  You say you feel put off Linux for some of the things that you
read on this list.  I say what you read on this list is (by and large)
top quality, free tuition.  If you care to make up the difference between
the total cost of owning Linux and Windows (say $180 for Windows, plus
$750 for Office, plus $1150 for SQL Server, plus $100 per seat for
Exchange, plus plus plus plus; less the $50 you paid for your Linux CD)
you could buy quite a great deal of courteous hand holding.  Or you
could read the wealth of material that's available -- more material than
is available for Windows, by the way.  Teach yourself and save many
thousands of dollars.

Regards,

David
