Alister!

I'm not certain of the mechanics of all that you are saying, but Linux is a
very stable, secure operating system. It does cope with NT 4.0 etc, etc.
You might like to check out the UNIX-vs-NT organisation's home page:

<A HREF="http://www.unix-vs-nt-org.com">http://www.unix-vs-nt-org.com</A>

On it is something called the `Kirch Paper' which details a host of issues
about why UNIX is better than NT. 

I see no reason why Linux wouldn't be able to do what you expect it to do,
however I also think you'll need to check out with more detail the exact
machinactions of how your server will work.

The guys and girls who see this list are quite helpful, and don't be afraid
to ask what you might consider a simple question.

David.

&gt;98 loaded and will be using a range of music, graphics and  video editing
&gt;software. Question. Am I doing the right thing? ( or  should I use NT 4?)  
&gt;  etc? I ask this as I have not found a simple adequate answer so  far. Any
&gt;sound advice would be appreciated   Thanks Alister Davies
