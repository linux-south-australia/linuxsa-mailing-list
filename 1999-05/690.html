&gt; What happens when the person gets excited!!&lt;g&gt;  As far as I know a lie
&gt; detector doesn't know the diff between excitement, certain emotions(ie
&gt; hate,
&gt; love) and nervousness.  To bad if you are an adult looking a  smut page
&gt; and
&gt; get turned on, and blocked for it!!&lt;lol&gt;
&gt; cya
&gt; 
	[O'Connor, Steven]  Once again - wiring the modem (?) up to the pet
cat solves all.

	Incidentally - I read a good one in the Sunday mail last weekend -
there was a case of 'Air Rage' where a passenger on a Jumbo Jet was asked by
the staff to please turn off his  laptop computer - because he was browsing
his own personal collection of porn whilst on the plane. Apparently, after
repeated attempts to get the man to cease and desist, he flew into a rage,
even at one point inviting one of the security guards on the aircraft to
'Step outside and sort this out'    (the plane was in flight at the time
...) 

	.. Maybe after that one, the government will place a ban on XV and
other immoral works of software !
