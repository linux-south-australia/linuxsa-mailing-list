Hi Andy,
I not sure if this will help...
I used to have my X crash all the time and then I changed video cards
from an old s3 to a new s3virge. The regularity of crashes has gone
down, but I still have the occasional crash caused from other faulty
hardware ( motherboard may be cracked or cheap ram) but I havent got the
money/time to find out what causes the crashes now. (actually now it is
getting rather bad as it wont boot every time I turn it on, I have to
try about 3-6 times to get the motherboard to start.... I will have to
start saving my $ as I cant leave it on 24/7/52)

Ben.....  :-)

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm running RedHat 6, with GNOME and Enlightenment as my desktop/window
&gt; managers, on my computer (PII, 64MB RAM, Daimond Viper 550. is that all
&gt; the relevant information needed?) and I occasionally find that X windows
&gt; just crashes for no reason at all. I have Linux run in init level 5, so X
&gt; starts again, but it's rather annoying.
&gt; 
&gt; It just happened to me not even 5 minutes ago, and all I had running was
&gt; x11amp, and it was loading netscape. It dumped core, if that makes any
&gt; difference. When I came back, I ran top and saw that 33MB of the ram was
&gt; used for cache, so I don't think it could be a memory problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else had similar problems and fixed it? does anyone know how I
&gt; could try to identify what is causing the problem (apart from trying
&gt; different desktop/window managers, if possible)?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Andy
