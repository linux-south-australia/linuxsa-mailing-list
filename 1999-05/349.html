With the usual caveats about correctness and doing things
the UNIX way rather than the Novell way, this looks like
good news for people using Linux in a corporate desktop
environment.

PS: The original media release had the invalid ISO Latin-1
    characters used by Microsoft products for quote marks.
    `BrainShare' indeed :-)

Novell Extends Directory Leadership Across Major Platforms with NDS for
Linux

Next-generation Scalable Directory Service to Unify NetWare, NT,
Solaris, Linux Environments

NICE, France (BrainShare Europe '99) -- May 18, 1999 -- Novell®, Inc.
today announced Novell Directory Services® (NDS) for Linux, the next
milestone in its strategy to extend its next-generation, scalable
Internet directory service, NDS 8, across the major computing platforms
of the enterprise and the World Wide Web. Running natively on Linux, NDS
will enable customers to effectively manage Linux workstations and
servers and integrate these Linux resources with NetWare®, NT and
Solaris systems on enterprise networks. Novell expects to make NDS for
Linux available by the end of calendar year 1999.

By running across platforms, NDS enables customers to choose the
hardware, server operating systems, and client operating systems that
best meet their requirements. Customers can deploy a single directory
infrastructure for managing and securing their platforms and
applications of choice, establishing a single-user signon and single
point of administration that dramatically reduces the cost and
complexity of network administration and management. In addition,
scalable NDS 8 supports an expanding spectrum of directory-enabled
applications that leverage user identity information as the basis for
customized Internet and e-commerce services.

`With NDS for Linux, Novell continues to advance our vision of a
business ecosystem encompassing the full diversity of people, platforms,
applications and services that populate the Internet,' said Christopher
Stone, Novell senior vice president for corporate development and
strategy. `Customers want the broadest possible access and choice, along
with the greatest possible control over the identity information that
determines what users can do on the network. The solution is the power
of NDS 8, which pulls together diverse platforms and applications into a
single intelligent network that is secure, easy to manage and easy to
use.'

 `Novell's announcement of NDS for Linux is another important step for
Linux as a major application platform for the enterprise and the
Internet,' said Bob Young, chairman and CEO of Red Hat, the leading
developer of Linux products and services. `The availability for Linux of
leading network services such as NDS will further strengthen Linux as a
robust business and Web platform that can be seamlessly integrated with
the other platforms and applications on customer networks today.'

About NDS
Novell's directory technology, NDS, is an integral component of Novell?s
directory-enabled NetWare platforms and the world?s leading directory
service. It is the unifying, cross-platform infrastructure for managing,
securing, accessing and developing to all the major components of a
network. NDS supports more APIs, tools, standards and protocols than any
other directory service. The advanced functionality in NDS offers a
strong development foundation for delivering secure, manageable network
applications. The market-proven and powerful structure of NDS
streamlines administrative tasks to minimize management time and
expense.

NDS 8 achieves unprecedented levels of scalable performance, including
the demonstrated ability to store and manage over a billion directory
objects such as users, applications, network devices and data --
millions
of objects more than competing directories. As a result, customers can
grow their networks and Internet-based services without interruption,
and deploy the highly centralized directory applications required for
e-commerce and other Internet services. NDS 8 natively supports the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) v 3 protocol, enabling
interoperability with other LDAP directories and support for all LDAP
applications.

NDS 8 is currently available for Novell's NetWare 5 platform and can be
downloaded from the World Wide Web at

In addition to NDS for Linux,  Novell plans to make NDS 8 available for
the NT and Solaris platforms by the end of the year. Earlier versions
of NDS, which interoperate with NDS 8, are available now from Novell
for the NT and Solaris platforms.
