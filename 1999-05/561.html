The Govt. also seems to forget that there are products available (ie
netnanny) that can prevent kids from viewing particular sites ( if properly
set up).  I think this government wants control of anything they don't
understand!!

&gt; IMHO,
&gt;
&gt; part of the problem the gov and parents have, seems to be that material
&gt; you wouldn't want your children to see comes from places you don't know
&gt; where.
&gt;
&gt; so why not make a top level domain called .sex right up there with .com
&gt; and .org etc.
&gt;
&gt; then the people who want that type of material know where it is, and the
&gt; people who don't want their children to go there know what to block.
&gt; ISP's don't have to do anything.
&gt;
&gt; i can just see tons of people jumping over themselves to get this sort
&gt; of domain name too. also the industry continues to self regulate itself
&gt; which is what it wants and sites continue to decide what type of domain
&gt; they go into.
&gt;
&gt; also IMHO, if it's so bad you wouldn't want your children to see it, you
&gt; shouldn't be looking at it either.
&gt; (from an ISP who is a father)
