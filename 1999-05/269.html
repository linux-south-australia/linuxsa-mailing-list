By all means, get into Java, it is a good hack environment and very
productive.

But it is worth your time learning at least one of Qt (KDE)   or GTK+

I have not spent much time in Qt, but GTK+ is just really, really good. It
seems insanely
verbose when you first dive in, but once you have your own libraries set up
nicely, it beats
anything if speed and control are your goals.

I find it about as code efficient as Java - AWT

&gt; There's nothing wrong with Delphi 4.0 or Builder 3.00 or 4.00. They're
&gt; very
&gt; good programming environments and provided you ensure that you stick to
&gt; strict programming protocols (i.e. gon't get lazy just because it's a drag
&gt; and click operation), you'll get a reasonable working program out of them.
&gt; 
&gt; I've had a basic look at X programming and in C it seems to be just as
&gt; esoteric and impossibly long and non-intuitive as programming for Windows.
&gt; However, I've decided that unless I'm writing a speed criticial program,
&gt; or
&gt; platform specific program, I'll program in Java.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh well. That's my two bobs for the day.
&gt; 
&gt; David.
