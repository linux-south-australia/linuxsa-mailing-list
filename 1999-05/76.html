Welllll...I think ( too) it is good to have cover from high-level input
 tech-penquins] they are a blessing. AND interestant will be to hear about
experienced go-arounds (experiment- penquins-combiners) the web servers may
be (gateway-penquins) BUT also the just starters (with or without
intellect-training...or pensioners already..(struggle-penquins) It all
depend on what is good commercial or what is good entertainment. What am I
saying ???? .......Bey for now.(swiming in my penquin-pool) Where is my
how-too   nowwww?

&gt; &gt; Thanks Toby I accept your criticism as a new user, maybe I am not as
&gt; &gt; intellectually gifted as you, But I would expect as Linux gains in
&gt; &gt; popularity you are going to be irritated as hell at the stupid questions
&gt; &gt; people ask. So may be an alternate mailing list is a good idea!
&gt;
&gt; Hello :)
&gt;
&gt; The main concern here, I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is
that
&gt; some people are using this list as an easy way out, and not doing any of
&gt; their own research.  I don't think that it's a stab at anyone's gift of
&gt; intellectualism.
&gt;
&gt; I most definitely agree that there should possibly be another, seperate,
&gt; LinuxSA mailing list, called NewbieLinuxsaSA, or something equally catchy,
&gt; which could accomodate the less technical questions.  Any questions that
go
&gt; above the heads of NewbieLinuxSA could be refered to LinuxSA, which could
be
&gt; renamed ProLinuxSA to fall in line with the new standard I've proposed.
&gt; (please laugh..)
&gt;
&gt; It's a whole lot more satisfying answering a question that relates to your
&gt; approximate level of experience.. not that answering "simpler" questions
is
&gt; not satisfying.. so a seperate list would probably benefit all round.
&gt;
&gt; Hands up who agrees!  *sticks hand up*
&gt;
&gt; Feel free to flame me relentlessly if you don't agree.  8|
&gt;
&gt; My 2c.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;There's a nice set of HOWTOs for all this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;cd /usr/doc/HOWTO
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;and check out the Networking-Overview, the NET-3-HOWTO, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt;PPP-HOWTO, and the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO. It's probably worth reading the
&gt; &gt; &gt;IPCHAINS-HOWTO as well.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Just skim read through those, and you'll gain a massive understanding
&gt; &gt; &gt;about how everything works. If you ever have a question, there's
usually
&gt; &gt; &gt;a howto or faq that has the answers.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;It'd be nice if the mailling list was used for things that aren't
&gt; &gt; &gt;already covered in the documentation. Tracking down bugs, fixes for
said
&gt; &gt; &gt;bugs, generating new ideas, brainstorming over complex problems....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Instead, the list these days seems to have become more like a "Help -
&gt; &gt; &gt;I've just installed linux, I don't understand Unix, and I'm too lazy to
&gt; &gt; &gt;read the masses of documentation, or at least figure it out for myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Can someone set my PC up for me so I can get online and use netscape
and
&gt; &gt; &gt;read email?"
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This isn't particularly directed at you Neil, just some people on this
&gt; &gt; &gt;list in general.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Someone was even asking "how do I view a file and make it stop on every
&gt; &gt; &gt;page?" a few days ago.
&gt; &gt; &gt;'more' is a command that's fairly universal. If you don't even know
&gt; &gt; &gt;about it, maybe people should consider buying a book on the subject of
&gt; &gt; &gt;Unix. There are many fine ones out there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Redhat even came with one in the boxed form, from what I recall.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Linux people tend to be sharing caring folks, unlike MSCEs who usually
&gt; &gt; &gt;want upwards of $100/hr for their time. However, I'm sure even the most
&gt; &gt; &gt;dedicated Advocate will eventually tire of answering the same basic
&gt; &gt; &gt;questions over and over.
&gt; &gt; &gt;That's what FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions (including Answers)) are
&gt; &gt; &gt;there for.
&gt; &gt; &gt;HOWTO's are there for when you want to know HOW TO do something.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyone want to write a auto-responder for the mailling list, that scans
&gt; &gt; &gt;thru the question-posts, and tried to determine what it is about, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;then locates appropriate HOWTO and FAQ s that are relevant, and replies
&gt; &gt; &gt;with a:
&gt; &gt; &gt;"
&gt; &gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup
&gt; &gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/FAQ/txt/PPP-FAQ
&gt; &gt; &gt;"
&gt; &gt; &gt;message?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Now there's some flame bait for you.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Yours,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Toby

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small
&gt; &gt; Network (2 pc's)
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to connect to
my
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; resolve addresses
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I have
called
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have the loopback
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au..
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through
Linux?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything
&gt; &gt; except for
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Regards
