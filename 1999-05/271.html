List,

I Come from a NT background. Recently I have been reading up on Linux
Security and I think I am getting there, however I am stumbling on a few
areas and no matter how many times I re-read the doco it just does not sink
in, pretty much like exams!!

First is the concept of "umask", whilst I think this sets a default kind of
security profile for something, I am not sure I understand its full
implications.

Second, how do you assign someone to multiple groups? If they are in
multiple groups which group takes precedance with regard to permissions.

Third, I briefly read something to do with suid and guid. Whilst I think I
grasp the importance of this, how do you prevent a malicious attack?

Last, but not least, as a complete new user to Linux (all of four weeks),
all I have done is basically installed the APC 5.2 version of RedHat. Whilst
I probably don't know what I am doing, it all went well, even the connecting
to the Ineternet bit. My last question concerns a default installation such
as this, what security aspects should I be observing with connecting to the
Internet (currently this is a non production machine), and how do I start
setting up policies to monitor who may be trying to break in? I appreciate
this last question may be where some consultants make there $$, so I am not
totally after a free ride, but some pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.

Mike
