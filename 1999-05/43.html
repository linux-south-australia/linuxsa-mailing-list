Hey All,

I've recently upgraded my motherboard from a 66MHz (Slot 1, 440LX) board to
a 100MHz 440BX board which has an onboard 8Mb SiS APG video adaptor and 3D
PCI sound card. I'm just wondering how hard it is to upgrade X to support
the new graphics card. I pay per Mb for my downloads and I don't really want
to download the latest version of the X server and find out I can't run
it... What sort of pitfalls am I likely to come across?

I am running Slackware 3.5.0, which is completely standard, except for the
kernel which I've upgraded to 2.2.1. Not sure which versions of the XFree86
slackware comes with.

Also, the abovementioned motherboard is for sale. I had to upgrade it
because it was causing interference on channel 9. It was putting green and
blue diagonal bars on the TV. I didn't have a lot of time to work out why it
was doing that, I just changed the board. If someone is interested in it,
make an offer. Its an LX board that runs at 66MHz. Has two Slot 1 slots, but
you need an APIC module to support the second slot. Will take up to a 333MHz
CPU(s). 4 DIMM slots. Any other info anyone wants? If you're interested,
e-mail me off the list.

I also have a brand new ATX power supply that I bought when I was trying to
work out what was wrong with the old board. I've used it for about 24 hours.
I'm pretty sure that its a 250W P/S (I don't have it sitting here in front
of me to check.) I'd like $65 for it if anyone is interested. Again, e-mail
me off the list.

Cheers
Dazz
