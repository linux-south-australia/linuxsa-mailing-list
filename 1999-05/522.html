Heyas
Two quick questions:
1) A SMP kernel should run on a single CPU, and it certainly appears to.
However, my build of 2.2.9 for SMP won't load some of the modules...The
problem is that they can't find the symbols for global_cli, global_sti,
and 2 related functions.
These are interrupt functions, and they will vary in how they work
between SMP and non-SMP machines. However, it appears they don't exist
in my SMP kernel!
IRQ handlers are not created as modules, and even if they were, depmod
should have found them and installed them with a modprobe sb. Except
depmod -a reports it can't find all the required symbols for some
modules.

the ne2k-pci module loads, but the 3com one doesn't for example.
soundcore loads, but sound and sb won't.

Does anyone know if this is a specific bug in 2.2.9, or is there
something I am doing wrong?
This SMP motherboard currently only has a single celeron CPU, and no
APIC chipset - irq's are being handled by the internal PIIX4 chipset.
I'll be getting an APIC chip for the m/b soon, (this is the only
motherboard I've ever seen that has an external APIC-IO chip!), but I
don't think this would cause this problem. AFAIK the symbols should
still exist in the kernel regardless.

On another related subject - does anyone know where I can get the
Socket370/PPGA to Slot 1 adaptor cards, that enable the Celeron to work
in a dual configuration?
Most adaptors require a wire or two being soldered to the back of them,
but there are some around that are already done this way, or else have a
jumper to set it.

Thanks,
Toby
