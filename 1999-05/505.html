Hello,

I recently used fips 2.0 on a Dell Inspiron (4-ish gig I think) without a
problem.
Windows booted fine afterwards, then I used dos fdisk  (the guy only wanted 
separate windows drives) to put logical drives into the new partition.

Cheers,

Ian

		Hi,

		I have not had any success running FIPS on laptops with
disks larger than 2GB.

		In each case, although FIPS was able to repartition, the
resultant Windows
		system would not boot and complained about problems with
Win386 and other
		files.

		This has happened on two laptops, an Acer Extensa 368T
(which appears to be
		a less than desirable machine, another name would be HoC)
with a 3.2GB disk
		drive, as well as a Compaq 1700 with a 4GB disk drive.

		Does anyone know what one has to do with such machines to
make sure that
		FIPS can do its work while preserving their ability to boot
that other OS?

		Alternatively, how to make the recovery CD with at least the
Compaqs
		partition up your disk into say, a small amount for Windows,
and lots for
		Linux :-), would be a good piece of info as well.
