&gt; Hi, we currently run a Novel 5 network with a Linux Box running as the
&gt; firewall - inter/intranet server.
&gt; The problem is that we would like the Linux box to act like a Novel
&gt; client and server so that it can access the Novel server and share
&gt; directories.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is our current setup.....
&gt; Novel 5 - Using IP disabled IPX
&gt; Linux 2.2.6 with ncpmount and ncp support in the kernel
&gt; Novel clients - Using IP  - NO IPX support
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment we can get the linux server to mount the Novel server by
&gt; compiling IPX support but disabling it with ipx_configure and it the
&gt; users IP this is fine and dandy but a bit awquared.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to be able to share directories on the linux server so they
&gt; look like a Novel server. Mars_nwe and ld something look promising but
&gt; all seem to only support IPX, as the clients don't have the IPX protocol
&gt; they can't access the files on the server.
&gt; Is there a way i can fix this? I know about the new Novel project but
&gt; that won't be out for months and we need this ASP.
&gt; 
&gt; The last thing i would like to do and this is really on the wish list. I
&gt; would like an squid authentication module that reads the users from the
&gt; NDS tree. I know that it is highly unlikely that this exists, i was
&gt; wondering is there any project that would be able to help or some code i
&gt; could start hacking? If i can get this it would be cream of the crop!
&gt; 
&gt; I have been trying to fight of repeated attempts to have boarder manager
&gt; installed on the firewall because I believe linux is a much better
&gt; product. Anyway its FREE :)

As far as I am aware, the only linux that fully supports NDS (as a client)
is Caldera OpenLinux.. Which is commercial.. And it has to do with
Novell licencing.. (Why it's not free I mean_..

Also, to run a proper server with NDS, you need NetWare for linux, which
also runs on Caldera.

Standard Linux only has Bindary IPX Novell support.
