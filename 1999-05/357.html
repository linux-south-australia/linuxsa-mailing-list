Hi,

I have been looking further at the certification issues, and have found the
following.

There are about five different certification avenues:

    Caldera certification
    RedHat certification:    Seems really for resellers
    Linux Professional Inst: www.lpi.org
    SAIR:                    www.linuxcertification.org (note the change)
    DigitalMetrics		  www.digitalmetrics.com

Digital Metrics seems to be well advanced on its program. SAIR and LPI are
offering certification exams through Sylvan Prometrics and VUE respectively.

What is interesting is that DigitalMetrics requires that you sign a
non-disclosure agreement prior to taking any certification exams. Indeed,
you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement just to sign up to take exams.

Has anyone else had experience with any of the other certification
processes, like MCSE, CNE, etc?  Do you have to sign non-disclosure
agreements just to sign up to take exams?

It seems that DigitalMetrics is trying to tightly control their whole Linux
Certification process, which seems to be somewhat counter to the Linux
philosophy. Imagine if RedHat asked you to sign a non-disclosure in order
to buy their product?

Because certification is going to be important to the whole Linux in
business space, I think it is important to discuss these issues in the open
to make sure we get it right.

Comments?
