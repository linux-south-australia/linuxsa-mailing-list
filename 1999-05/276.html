&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Who else has used internet banking services offered by the banks?

A very active Commonwealth bank user.

&gt; 2. It takes a damn long time to load, although it may now be in the cache.

Having squid running on your machine makes a whole lot of difference, very
easy to install, very quick to react.  Turn down the netscape disk cache
right down and let a web cache work well.

&gt; 3. The little lock on the applet was broken all the time, indicating that
&gt; they are not using SSL, and my account details, including possibly by
&gt; access number are potentially exposed for anyone (in the right place) to
&gt; capture and use.

Not necessarily.  There is also a the possibility that Adelaide Bank have
licensed a Java encryption engine.  Layering on top of the normal socket
based services.  The security pages at 

	<A HREF="http://www.adelaidebank.com.au/home/online/high-4.html">http://www.adelaidebank.com.au/home/online/high-4.html</A>

Indicate that the applet is downloaded through SSL, which it is, the 
padlock on the Applet window indicates whether or not the applet is
signed.  (Which IMHO it should be, otherwise you can't guarantee that
the applet is *really* from Adelaide Bank).

The raw socket interface that Java has access to can easily be encrypted.
They probably have licensed a swedish (or israeli :) encryption library.
Mind you though based on the recent article from slashdot on Echelon at

	<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid</A>=99/05/09/143254&mode=thread

you do have to wonder about that proprietary (swedish or otherwise) 
encryption technology ;) (- conspiracy mode off :).

Althought all in all, the launch point (and the applet itself) do look
relatively amateurish.  They didn't give the launch page the same look
and feel as the other web pages.

&gt; So, I wonder how other banks do it?

CBA have an windows only application.  It does run under wine, and that is
how I have been using it (I have actually never run it under MS Windows of
any variant :)  It also runs under the Mac windows emulators (apparently).
I assume that it will run under VMware quite happily.

All in all I am quite happy with the CBA software, transaction history, 
transfers, BPAY all make life that little bit easier.

Regards,

Matt
