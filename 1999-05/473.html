&gt;  "To promote and support Linux in South Australia"
&gt; 
&gt; Simple. Nothing more and nothing less.  Support means assisting those who
&gt; don't have the knowledge or experience, understand and fix problems. Part
&gt; of this includes improving the abilities of its members.
&gt; 
&gt; To achieve this we must attempt at least the following :-
&gt; 
&gt;  o Act in a civil and friendly manner.  If you feel you have to be
&gt;   rude, *DON'T*, we are are civilised people here.  If you get
&gt;   heated writing a message, don't write it.
&gt;  o Keep in mind that people may not know the 'simplest' thing, some
&gt;   people have never used any sort of Unix before.
&gt;  o Point people in the appropriate direction to improve their
&gt;   knowledge.
&gt;  o Flaming is rude, especially in a public forum.  Be an adult, *DON'T*.
&gt; 
&gt; Neither Geoffrey nor myself are going to do any of the following to 
&gt; LinuxSA :-
&gt; 
&gt;  o Split the list - we are all civilised, we should all be able to
&gt;   get along with each other.
&gt;  o Moderate the list - Free and open discussion is what I founded
&gt;   LinuxSA on.
&gt; 
&gt; LinuxSA is not intended to be everything to everyone.  LinuxSA was founded
&gt; with the above principle, and will remain true to that principle.  Each
&gt; person has to make their own choices as to whether they want to follow
&gt; that principle.  I am sure that a vast majority of people on the list feel
&gt; that way, particularly the new arrivals on the Linux scene.
&gt; 
&gt; Well that is the LinuxSA co-ordinators view.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Matt

Great Matt,
any chance of creating the list as a digest too considering its number of 
daily messages.
cheers,
Mike
