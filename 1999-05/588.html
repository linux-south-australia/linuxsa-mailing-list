 &gt; &gt; Filtering software doesn't tell you what it's blocking.  The blacklists

 &gt; Huh?
 &gt; I suppose this could be this way to prevent competitors from stealing
 &gt; the lists,

Yup.  Not just competitors, too:  Can you imageine the sales figures
on a CD-ROM full of pornographic URLs? :-)

 &gt; but it also seems like a rather stupid thing from a
 &gt; consumers/users point of view...I mean, say you find out that your
 &gt; search engine is blocking out, say, a site about preventing AIDS, and
 &gt; you want to unblock it, you couldn't really do it, if you can't access
 &gt; the blacklist. 
 &gt; (Can you?)

Most (but not all) of them provide a way of editing the blacklist
through a GUI.  Some of them don't give you complete control, though
(like, they may only have "slots" for 20 bad blocks, for instance).

 &gt; Are there any Open Source proxy filters out there?

I don't generally consider that those with the kind of mindset that
encourages open-source software development are much inclined to
write software for the explicit purpose of reducing access to information.
I certainly hope not, anyway.

See <A HREF="http://www.censorware.org">http://www.censorware.org</A> for HEAPS of information about censorware,
and <A HREF="http://www.efa.org.au/Publish/report_isheriff.html">http://www.efa.org.au/Publish/report_isheriff.html</A> for a report
on Senator Alston's favourite censorship software.
