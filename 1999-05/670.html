Hi,

Regarding censorship, I believe our government should begin their
campain looking at what they show on TV's. It is the very first place
where children can get to view anything that any parent does not want
them to! There is a lot of material that suggest sexuality, even when
watching Video Hits!
Well, this is another story. Our government is appears to be more
concerned with banning all access to material that is out of their hand
and cannot be taxed! It's all about money and nothing else! Media sucks,
sending through only the picture they want us see to and not the real
facts. Just look at who owns the huge tabloids and TV channels!
Need anything else to say? OK, what about the Penthouse magazines?
Does anyone know some government bodies that can be contacted through
e-mail? I wish to check out some oppinions from the big guys!
Thank you anticipated,

Best wishes,

Nick.

PS. Whatch your kids and make sure they go to bed early and they won't
watch that bloody TV late at night. Some phone numbers they show cost as
little as $4.95/minute! But that's a different story!
