&gt; Oh, really, dont bore us - thats just what we *expect* from a sophisticated
&gt; Linux-based system.
&gt; It's references to that primitive, legacy OS (I think its called panes, or
&gt; windows, or something) that are the cause of shock-horror reactions - it is
&gt; still occasionally used here and there, you know...

I used to be a systems programmer for *the* legacy operating
system, IBM's MVS.  MVS is so legacy that it still treats files
on disk as though they are stacks of punched cards sitting in the
input hopper of a card reader.  Until MVS/ESA (released in the
mid-90s) you could actually boot the operating system off punched
cards.

For all that, the IBM mainframe operating system was so
stable that it would only have to be rebooted (or `Initial
Program Load' in IBM-speak) twice a year.

Now here's the cringing bit.  Why did it have to be IPLed
twice a year?  So you could change the time from standard
to daylight savings time and back again.  Of course, most
sites that really care don't bother changing the time.
This lead to interesting hacks in COBOL applications programs
that I bet Y2K programmers hate.

To give you an idea of MVS's stability, most sites I know
don't record the longest period of uptime, that would be
boring.  They record the maximum number of IPLs that happened
on one day (usually many years ago during an upgrade).


IBM's VM is also interesting: just like VMware you can
run multiple simulateneous copies of the OS, each on a
seperate virtual machine.  This is really useful.  You
can have a grunty computer running production services
in one VM, and the test environment running in another.
You can create a third VM to test the OS upgrade procedure,
meaning that the outage on the real-world system is very
small (and might actually just be changing the user's
default VM from the old VM to another VM).

If you are looking at creating production services that
must have low outage periods for their entire lifetime,
I'd have a good look at VMware (especially if the
application doesn't allow for redundant platforms).
