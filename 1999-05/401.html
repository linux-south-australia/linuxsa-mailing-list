Hi,
This is a bit of a saga for me, so I'll ask a little, and expand if
nexesary.

I have an Adaptec AHA1542 SCSI card, which works fine under DOS/Win/Win95

Linux seems to have problems with it. As it is the only non-PNP card on my
system, its been jumpered to IRQ 12, Port 130H.

Using modules, I've loaded the driver with portbase=0x130 (from the SCSI
howto), and at boot time I get no success or failure error messages about
it loading. insmod seems to indicate it has loaded, but to query this I
have to check using a non-compiled prog, which I'll obtain.

I have also tried re-compiling my kernel with SCSI support, and giving
LILO directives.

My box is a RedHat 5.2
My SCSI card has A SCSI Zip, and a HDD with a DOS partition on it.


My question is about the devices in /dev, as there seems to be come
confusion in the man pages and other documentation about what they
represent.

/dev has sd[a-g][1-15] and sg[a-h], but there is confusion as to how it
resolves to Partition and SCSI ID. Some indicate it the letters, and some
the numbers. How do I specify:

A SCSI HDD on SCSI ID 4 with a primary partition?
A SCSI HDD on SCSI ID 4 with an extended partition?
A SCSI ZipDrive on SCSI ID 5?

thanks
