If you've ever wondered, as I did a few weeks ago, if the penguin would
still be happy living in '386 land, don't try it yourself unless you have
tooooo much spare time.
The system was a 386 SX40 with 8meg and 2x cdrom hanging off a Soundblaster
16. Around 350 megs of apps were chosen to be installed including X.
The RH 5.2 install went
perfectly........................................slowly.
After around 7 hours and no glitches what-so-ever I was greeted with a
familiar login prompt.
It might take several minutes to boot then a few more to 'startx' but at
least you have time to get another coffee. You can generally grow the beans
from seed and still beat X. Next I might try to rebuild the kernel. Should
be ready by Christmas!
Maybe Bill could learn something about backward compatibility from this.

And for all those flamers out there, yes, I promise to get a life but there
really isn't a lot to do in the Alice.
