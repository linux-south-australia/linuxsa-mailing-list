I really like Linux. It is good. I have 3 different versions (Slakware 2.0,
3.5, and RedHat 5.2 (APC)) on 3 of my home machines. But the following
attitude is ridiculous:

&gt;
&gt;As for NT, forget the "Start" to shut it down.
&gt;
&gt;Just change some insignificant setting or just let it go for a while.
&gt;
&gt;It will shut itself down :-&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;Kevin
&gt;

I have worked with NT since version 3.1 (developed prototype servers for Com
Bank, Westpac and others) and it is only when I see some "Expert" with a
Novell or to a lesser degree, Unix background set it up that it exhibits
that kind of behaviour. Some of the worst are by MCSEs and MCPs (What
Microsoft teach in those courses defies belief sometimes).

I have an NT 4.0 server which runs happily on an under-specified 686. It
rarely gets shutdown and never reboots itself. At work we have approximately
50 NT, around 30 Unix servers of varying flavours (mainly Digital and HP-UX)
and a couple of dozen VAXs. Lately it seems that the unix beasties are going
up and down like yo-yos. It is all in what you look for. Different OSs for
different tasks. I don't like a lot of MS tactics, ethics and charges, etc.
either, but they have brought me LOTS of work over the years. If it was
perfect I would be a pauper.

In politics, the mud-slinger loses as much credibility as his/her target.
The real successes are those who can stand on their own merit. Linux has the
potential to do that by itself, without tearing down other O/Ss. If we all
get real for a moment here, Linux is not for the faint hearted or the
non-technical person. It is NOT ready for mass consumption at the desktop
level yet. It has GREAT potential, but it is still immature in the
user-friendly stakes. One thing that it lacks is a CUA '91 standard
interface. This was supposed to be an international standard for all GUIs, X
included. If something like this was added, you wouldn't need to give
someone a brain transplant so that they can successfully install and enjoy
Linux.

I think that if we keep promoting the benefits of Linux, people will move
over. We just get into childish finger pointing at the establishment, we
will be passed over like children. Remember what happened to OS/2. That was
one of the best O/S's of its day but was rejected by many because of the
'Religious Fervour' of it's adherents. People don't like to be labeled
'fanatic' or 'minority' when it comes to stuff like this, especially when it
comes to their jobs.

I think that I need to go to bed, I'm raving again.....
