Re problem with LP1.

This may or may not be relevant but,
during my recent install of RH 6.0 I lost printing to lp1. I came across
the info below during my search - which continues. 


Beginning with kernel 2.1.33 (and available as a patch for kernel
2.0.30), the lp device is merely a client of the new parport device. The
addition
of the parport device corrects a number of the problems that plague the
old lp device driver - it can share the port with other drivers, it
dynamically assigns available parallel ports to device numbers rather
than enforcing a fixed correspondence between I/O addresses and port
numbers, and so forth. 

The advent of the parport device has enabled a whole flock of new
parallel-port drivers for things like Zip drives, Backpack CD-ROMs and
disks, and so forth. Some of these are also available in versions for
2.0 kernels; look around on the web. 

The main difference that you will notice, so far as printing goes, is
that parport-based kernels dynamically assign lp devices to parallel
ports.
So what was lp1 under Linux 2.0 may well be lp0 under Linux 2.2. Be sure
to check this if you upgrade from an lp-driver kernel to a
parport-driver kernel

I goes on to say that auto detection may not work !

&gt; Hello,
&gt;         A short while back, I noticed some correspondence concerning a
&gt; problem where the lp1 port would disappear if parallel port support was
&gt; included in a kernel; well, I think that's what it was.
&gt; 
&gt; The solution was to actually communicate with the printer through lp0
&gt; instead.  I had a similar problem, but could not solve it.
