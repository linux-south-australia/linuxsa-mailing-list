Hi Guys,
    I posted the below a couple of weeks ago, but it seems
to have been buried in other stuff. The only response I got
was the one also below, but I still don't have a
satisfactory answer to my problems. Thanks to Toby for his
effort, but if "M$ redefining ascii" or "booting a Sun 3/60"
gets multiple responses, do you think that a real Linux
question could get more than 1. I really am still stuck with
these problems, particularly the printer problem.
    Thanks,
        Andrew.


&gt;I don't know about your first problem, but the second one
sounds
&gt;suspiciously like X is no longer SUID root. I'm not sure
where the suid
&gt;root is supposed to be though, but maybe someone else will.
&gt;I don't see how this could really have occured though. But
it's just a
&gt;thought that X DOES need to be suid root to access the
video card
&gt;directly, and so if a user can't run it, it looks like it
doesnt have
&gt;it's root priveleges.

&gt;&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt;&gt;     Couple of problems, unrelated on two different
machines.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Problem 1.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Machine running Redhat 5.2, has been running
perfectly
&gt;&gt; no problems. Just upgraded video card to a Diamond
Viper550
&gt;&gt; AGP card. Was running XFree86 3.1 or whatever was default
&gt;&gt; with the APC disk, and this didn't like the new Video
card
&gt;&gt; so I downloaded  the latest X 3.3 and it now runs fine,
no
&gt;&gt; problems. Now here is the strange bit, the Printer, an HP
&gt;&gt; DeskJet 670C, was running fine, but now it will only
print
&gt;&gt; Postscript. It will NOT print standard output or a text
&gt;&gt; file. Went to the printer tool in X, printed PS, ascii to
&gt;&gt; the port, ie dev/lpt0, this worked fine. Tried to print
&gt;&gt; ascii test page and the error light on the printer
started
&gt;&gt; flashing and no output. Cannot pipe cat text to lp, ie.
&gt;&gt;         cat .bashrc | lpr -lp
&gt;&gt; weird. Can print PS through Ghostview. I just don't
&gt;&gt; understand how this can happen when I have not changed
&gt;&gt; anything remotely to do with the printer. The same
symptoms
&gt;&gt; occur if I am running X or not.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Problem 2.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Machine is completely isolated from machine 1.
Machine 2
&gt;&gt; is an Intel Celeron 333, 128Mb RAM, Diamond Viper 330 AGP
&gt;&gt; Video card. Installed a virgin copy of Redhat 5.2 from
the
&gt;&gt; APC disk. Machine appeared to set up fine, appeared to be
&gt;&gt; working fine. X runs perfectly under root. Strange
&gt;&gt; occurrence number 2 - created 1 user in the normal
fashion,
&gt;&gt; gave him a passwd etc. Logged in as that user, no
problems.
&gt;&gt; That user CANNOT run X. runs startx command and gets the
&gt;&gt; initial grey screen with a cursor, and then it appears to
&gt;&gt; hang. Fire off a trusty Ctrl-Alt-F1 and get the following
&gt;&gt; message :
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports :
&gt;&gt; &gt; Error    bad length in Geometry
&gt;&gt; &gt;            Output File "var/temp/Server-0.xkm" removed
&gt;&gt; Errors from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server
&gt;&gt; Couldn't load XKB keymap, falling back to pre-XKB keymap
&gt;&gt; xinit : unexpected error 2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Waiting for X server to shutdown
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; O.K. now I expect the last 2 lines were me when I Ctrl-C
to
&gt;&gt; kill the process. But how can it work fine for root but
not
&gt;&gt; a user in this case. The setup was a virgin install onto
a
&gt;&gt; virgin hard disk and was done in exactly the same way as
I
&gt;&gt; setup other machines that have no problems. I am a bit
out
&gt;&gt; of my depth here so basically help guys.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;&gt;         Andrew
