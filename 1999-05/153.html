I certainly hope not!  It's  part of the standard UNIX environment.

In traditional UNIX systems, the number of parameters you give to
a function doesn't really make any difference, as long as you provide
the minimum number established in the prototype:  Parameters are
pushed onto the stack in reverse order, then the top of the stack
is designated the first parameter, the second-from-the-top is the
second parameter, and so on.  On an architecture that uses registers
instead of stack frames for parameter passing, the principle is 
the same, you just substitute the terminology.

So if you have a routine which expects two parameters and you give
it three (or eighty :-) nobody really cares, you just end up with
a whole pile of unused parameters cluttering up your stack space.

Five points to anyone who can come up with a method of dynamic
memory allocation with resource tracking based on pushing unused
parameters onto the stack &lt;grin&gt;

Anyway, on with the story...

 &gt; "void main( void)" is not a
 &gt; supported option and apparently this is important. 

Actually, void main(void) *is* a supported option, because under
ANSI C main() is permitted to have a void return type and because
the C runtime doesn't actually give a toss about your prototype 
anyway (because it can't see it;  it just jumps to whatever address
is mapped to "main" in the symbol table and hopes for the best).

One thing to remember is that crt0 doesn't actually have the faintest
idea about what prototype you've given to the various functions in the
object files you're linking against it, it just sees a collection of
entry points exported by a symbol table.

So crt0 will say "use _main as the entrypoint"[1], and the linker will
look at your object file symbol tables, find out the address of 
_main, and substitute it in the quoted sentance above.  That process
is invisible to crt0, which is why it doesn't care what type of 
function main really is, or whether it's a function at all.  There's
a famous winner in the annual IOCCC competition which was a C "hello,
world" program that looked like this:

const int main[] = {
  /*
   * comma-separated 16-bit hexadecimal, octal and caracter 
   * representations of a Hello, world program written in VAX
   * and PDP-11 machine code.
   */
};

Compile that and you end up with a block of memory containing the
stuff you've initialized the array with and a symbol table containing
"_main" and the address of that block of memory;  When you link that
object file against crt0.o all it really wants is the address of
_main, which it gets without caring about the fact that it's the
address of an array, not a function.

So what happens if you declare main as "void main(void)"?  Well,
crt0 expects to call "main(int ac, char **av, char **ep)", i.e.:
a function with one integer parameter and two pointer (32-bit words
on x86) parameters.  It pushes them onto the stack then jumps into
main(), but main() never actually uses the parameters that have been
shoved onto its stack.  Does crt0 care?  Nope.  Does it still work?
Yup (it should, anyway.  If pain persists, see your physician).

 &gt;   void crt(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 &gt;     exit(main(argc, argv));
 &gt;   }
 &gt; 
 &gt; What happens if you define main as a void?  Apparently the program bombs
 &gt; on return. 

The original poster didn't say it bombed;  he just said he got no output.

Again, think about it on the register level:  If you're using a compiler
and runtime which provides return values in registers, a return from a 
void function will just mean that the register containing the return
value is either zero or uninitialized, so you'll get a 0 exit status or
a random exit status from the code fragment above.

If you're using an application architecture which uses the stack for
returning values from functions, the prototype of the called function
can make a difference:  If crt0 expects to find, say, a 32 bit int
on the stack after main() returns, it'll get whatever random cruft
was underneath the stack at the time if the function that has been
called is actually void (and therefore not writing anything to the
stack).

So, you get a kinda-random return value;  but crt0 should be able
to figure that out, because you can see how much data the routine
you've called has left for you on the stack by working out the
difference between the current stack pointer and the stack pointer
you saved away before you called the function in the first place.
One would hope that crt0 does something like that!

Take note, though:  Even if it doesn't, that won't stop the 
fflush() from happening!  It'll just mean the exit status is
an undefined value.  Go back to your pseudo-code definition of
exit() and you'll see that the file handle flushes happen regardless
of the parameter passed-in to exit().

So, have I answered the original question?  Nope! :-)

Perhaps we could get further if the original poster could try
a few things:  

Firstly, what happens if he terminates main() with "exit(0)"?

Secondly, what happens if he defines main() as "int main(void)"
instead of "void main(void)"?
