&gt; &gt; &gt; they not want to sell it? :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Maybe just not this week.. Geoffrey's away on his Honeymoon.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Since today is the "official" release date it might be still a little
&gt; while.  Even EverythingLinux (www.everythinglinux.com.au) doesn't have
&gt; it up on their webpage. for sale yet (except for the EverythingLinux
&gt; pressed CD for $7 + $11 postage and handling :-)

Actually it's $7 + $1.32 p&p... (It mentions that all up and delivered
it's $11 or less.. It's $11 for international).

Regarding the Boxed Set, there is a good reason why we haven't put it up..

Since RedHat have increased the price, lowered the margin, and doubled the
weight, it's made the boxed set basically unaffordable to most people in
Australia (approx AUD $150 landed).. Basically, most people
internationally have pulled most of their orders from the distributers..

In responce to this, RedHat are talking about an International release..
Im not sure exactly what their doing, probably un-bundling the support,
but even still, thats going to be around $120 landed. These won't be
released until the 14th or something..

With all this uncertanty, we can't really put a price online as it could
just as well change at the last minute. When we have definate details of
delivery and costs, we will put it up.

I assume that just about everyone else hasn't put up a price yet for the
same reason.
