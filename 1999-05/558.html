Hi,

&lt;Snip of message&gt;

Somewhat cynical, but very believable. I don't think the medeia is THAT
biased, but it can come close. Will MS be that dominatory ? Concievable,
but one thing I've pondered for a while. MS is seen as Big Evil Brother.
Even more evil is its CEO Mr Gates. I think MS's direction and drive comes
mostly from Gates himself.

Now the question, how long will Gates be CEO. I don't know his age, but he
must be appproaching 40/50 ? Thats starting to get to the time when he'll
start to consider directions in his life. When will he retire ? Can't
answer, but one thing I'm positive of, they can't replace him. Whoever
they replace im with will not direct the company in the same way. Whatever
else he is, he is a smart business man.

The point here is that though the computer world changes fast, the real
world changes slow, and it the "!984" senario comes to pass I think some
or all of this might have happened before hand, and MS might have lost its
edge by that stage.

We can live in hope.

cya
