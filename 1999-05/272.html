My condolences.  Unless "come from" implies "have left", in which
case congratulations! :-)


&gt; First is the concept of "umask", whilst I think this sets a default
&gt; kind of security profile for something

When you use the creat() system call, or the open() system call
with the F_CREAT flag, you also specify a file creation mask.  This
is a nine bit value comprising three groups of three bits.  The
groups are the permissions for the creator of the file, the
permissions for the group of the file, and the permissions for
everyone else.  Each group is three bits, being permission to read,
permission to write and permission to execute the file.  (Side
note: For directories, execute permission means permission to access
a file within that directory.)  The file creation mask which you
specify with the creat() or open() system call is masked with the
complement of the processes umask; that is, every bit in the umask
is a bit which is cleared from the creation mask passed to creat().

There's something of an unwritten convention that all programs
create files with a permission mask of 0777 (that's octal), meaning
all permissions enabled.  There's something else of an unwritten
convention that all processes run with a umask like 022, 027; that's
disallow write access to group and other; or disallow write access
to group and disallow everything to other.  Obviously the umask
you use needs to be determined by your local security policy, and
the creation mask needs to be tempered by your specific application.


&gt; Second, how do you assign someone to multiple groups?

You list the username in the /etc/group file.  It's the last field
of the line, and it's a comma separated field.  There is a limit
to the number of groups a process can be in, and that limit is
system dependent.  16 or 32 is a common limit.  (You can change
it, but you may have to relink your kernel.)  All groups are equal
with repsect to what files you can access.  The group id listed in
the /etc/passwd file is the group which owns files that the user
creates.


&gt; Third, I briefly read something to do with suid and guid. Whilst I
&gt; think I grasp the importance of this, how do you prevent a malicious
&gt; attack?

Don't ever set a program to be setuid or setgid unless you know
what you are doing.  The really simple answer is that the person
who writes the program decides if it should be setuid or setgid
or (more commonly) neither.

A setuid or setgid program is a way for you to permit other people
to have some of your privileges.  It is up to you, when you write
the program which runs setuid or setgid, to control what they can
do.  It's quite easy to get that wrong, for example, you might
write a program which, as part of it's function, sorts a data file;
and you might do it by saying, system("sort -o data.s data").  This
could be sufficient to give away all of your permissions.  (It need
not be insecure, but probably is.)  Truly, the simple explanation
is that usually you don't need to run programs set?id.


&gt; Last, but not least, as a complete new user to Linux (all of four
&gt; weeks), all I have done is basically installed the APC 5.2 version
&gt; of RedHat. Whilst I probably don't know what I am doing, it all went
&gt; well

It does take a long time to learn Unix, and it is heartening to
see you cheerfully admit that you probably don't know what you are
doing.  (For the record, I respectfully agree with you :-) ).  Unix
systems tend to be setup securely (which is a large part of the
reason why newbies find it unfriendly.)  This does not mean you
can assume your system is secure.  Unfortunately nobody can reasonably
say what security aspects to be concerned with in this forum --
there are tomes written on the subject, indeed you need to pay
particular attention to "Unix Security, Volume XVII" (my little
joke).  It's taken me decades to learn that I don't know Unix
security; and of course the more I learn the less I know.  Read,
read and read again.  (Going to a course is almost always a waste
of money.  I think it's like Windows in that respect.)

If you're interested, I'm hideously expensive but excellent value...

Regards,

David (who probably just stunned most of this list: it's not the
question, it's the effort that went into it.)
