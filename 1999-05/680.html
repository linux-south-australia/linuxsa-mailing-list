HI

In the process of doing this:

****
Also make sure you have the following in /etc/ppp/options:

lock
deflate 15,15

And the following in /etc/conf.modules:

alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp    # Enable bsd compression
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate # protocol number from draft RFC
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate # real protocol number.

This makes sure that you also use software compression.

Other things to check. In /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0 
(you may not have the 0 on the filename). Chech you have these lines:

MRU="1500"                   # maximum receive block size
MTU="1500"                   # maximum transmit block size
LINESPEED="115200"           # default connect speed for 28.8 upwards
HARDFLOWCTL="yes"            # keep the modem reciving while pc works
DEFROUTE="yes"               # send all packets to this gateway 
****

My blasted Linux has decided that it's not going to talk to the modem. I
went back to all the files I changed and reset them to what they were (I'd
saved a back up) and it still won't talk.

I'm pulling my hair out. One minute Linux's Network Configuration tool
works with my modem to connect to the Internet. Next minute it won't talk
AT ALL to my modem - there's no sound (it's external and has worked with
senet before once) coming out of it at all.

Any suggestions? I think I'd prefer to have a SLOW Internet connection, but
at the moment I've got NO Internet connection.

David.
