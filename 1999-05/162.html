 &gt; My question therefore has morphed into this:

 &gt; If so, I think this is un-funky. In my opinion, the coder should not
 &gt; have to care what the stdout stream is going. It seems however that a
 &gt; coder does, or at best put fflush() calls everywhere.

You don't have to care -- if your program ever exits, all the buffers
will be flushed and you'll get your output.  If you're running in a
continuous loop, you'll get your output every time you fill a buffer
(probably 8k or so; a multiple of your disk block size at least).
It's only if you play tricks (like expecting that the only way you'll
ever close a stream is by getting killed) that you run into problems.

When stdout and/or stderr correspond to a tty, the stdio subsystem 
realizes that they're supposed to be interactive (via isatty()) and
unbuffers them (i.e.: gives you an implied fflush() after every newline).

If you put an fflush() after every printf() you'll slow your program
down terribly when you're redirecting to a file, and won't help at all
when you're running interactively.
