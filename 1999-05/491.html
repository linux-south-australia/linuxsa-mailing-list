Natalie,

First of all I agree 100% with david and just had one more point to add

&gt;long as I can come to grips with Linux.  But if someone asks a question, I
&gt;don't think the answer should be posted on the list but directly to the
&gt;person who asked.  If anyone else wanted to know they would have asked
also.
&gt;This will minimise the incredible amount of stuff floating on this list
&gt;which I suspect is mostly what's getting up everyone's noses - seeing the
&gt;same answer over and over again and not necessarily seeing the same
question
&gt;over and over again.


I disagree with this totally. By posting answers on the list you not only
build up a knowledge base
in the form of linux-sa archives (which i hope become searchable :), but for
the people that
either didnt feel confident asking the question, or wondered it once but
later forgot it provides a wealth of
knowledge to.

Posting answers to questions no matter how trivial is very beneficial to
all.. Chances are if u read the
topic and are disinterested you can skip past those messages.


-Paul,
