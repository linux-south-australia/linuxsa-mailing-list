Love my Logitech Marble Trackman ... meets all your requirements, and
cost me about $127 at Office works - normally I wouldn't by computer
bits from woolworths, but these guys are cheap for commodity, quality
items (Here is the web page for the Marble+ - which has the scrolly
wheely thing - mine doesn't have one, nor do I really miss it, as I just
flick the trackball with my thumb, apparently the latest XFree X servers
support the scrolly wheely things)

<A HREF="http://www.logitech.com/au/trackballs/tb20_100.html">http://www.logitech.com/au/trackballs/tb20_100.html</A>


I also used to have the Logitech Trackman with the blue ball - it was
good, but it used rollers to detect movement (like a conventional
mouse), and I had to clean them all the time.

The marble trackman uses optical sensors to sense the movement of the
dots on the ball. Occasionally you get a bit of resistance from finger
grease on the ball supports, but it is very easy to clean off. I
probably end up cleaning the contacts every four weeks or so (ie. I
can't remember the last time).

I have used both mice with XF86 for a could of years now, and have never
ever had trouble. 

The only disappointment is you specify "microsoft" as the mouse protocol
! eg.

Section "Pointer"
   Protocol        "Microsoft"
   Device          "/dev/mouse"
   BaudRate        1200
   Resolution      200
   Buttons         3
EndSection


BTW, if you want to weird out your friends, and have two mice
controlling the one cursor (like Win95 can), add the following to
XF86Config :

Section "Xinput"
  SubSection "Mouse"
       Port "/dev/ttyS1"
       Protocol "Microsoft"
       DeviceName "pointer2"
       Emulate3Buttons
       AlwaysCore
  EndSubSection
EndSection


with the right settings. The above is for a Microsoft "bar of Dove soap"
attached to com 2.

HTH,
Mark.

&gt; Having spent less than $300 on my home Linuxen, I now
&gt; want to have a total budget blow-out and buy a three-button
&gt; mouse.
&gt; 
&gt; Specs:
&gt; 
&gt;   PS/2.
&gt; 
&gt;   Microsoft protocol.
&gt; 
&gt;   Mechanical (I still remember the days of Sun's optical
&gt;      mice, and they sucked).
&gt; 
&gt;   Good brand: Logitech, etc (Not because they are better,
&gt;      but a message "My Logitech XYZ doesn't work with
&gt;      XF86 3.3.3.666" will get a response.  Even "mine
&gt;      does, so there!" is useful when fault-finding.)
&gt; 
&gt;   Three real buttons :-)
&gt; 
&gt;   A reasonable length of cable (I hope to put the PC
&gt;      under the desk).
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seem something suitable around town?
&gt; 
&gt; I made the mistake of wandering into Dick Smith's
&gt; looking for the mouse and some 44256 RAM and didn't
&gt; come out with either.  I knew Coles buying DSE was
&gt; the beginning of the End :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Glen
