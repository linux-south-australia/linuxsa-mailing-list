&gt; A 'possible today' method would be a modified lie detector attached to
&gt; your PC, maybe?
&gt; Lie detectors detect nervousness, so if you're nervous about loading a
&gt; page you know to be illegal, then it'll notice it and block the page for
&gt; you.
&gt; So, an adult who knows its fine to view the smut he's d/ling will be
&gt; allowed to see it, but a 15 yr old kid who's hoping his parents don't
&gt; notice, will be nervous, and it'll be blocked.
&gt; 
	[O'Connor, Steven]  Excellent idea ...

	However, I would think that when the 15 yr old is home alone (Ma &
Pa are off to a PTA meeting at the highschool), and they are free to browse
without fear of discovery, then the blocker would detect less nervousness,
and allow more content than usual.

	Mind you, when the same 15 yr old is on the last day of a major
school project that is due first thing in the morning, and they are
frantically scouring encarta.com for relevant material, the degree of
tension and nervousness would more than likely trigger the blocker to flash
the screen red, and blast THOUGHTCRIME.WAV out of the 300W speakers !

	You could always wire the detector up to the cat, who despite the
fact that he eats and sleeps too much, is possessed of a wonderful arrogance
that makes them immune to all feelings of guilt.
