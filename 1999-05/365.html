&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I get this every boot time...
&gt; 
&gt; I thought it was something to do with tho loopback being added to the
&gt; routing
&gt; table as 127.0.0.1, instead of 127.0.0.0, but a netstat -r  reveals a
&gt; 127.0.0.0.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the deal? Once again, I wish these programs would return slightly
&gt; more
&gt; informative error messages!#$@!  Like at least show me the invalid
&gt; argument???
So edit the source code and MAKE it give you more information.
You could even do it neatly, and submit it into the next kernel release.
People who've used unix for ages probably don't make mistakes and pass
invalid arguments, and so they never notice that there isn't much help
when they do. If you want to help make Linux easier to use for all the
newcomers, then why not do something, instead of complaining?


Oh, and while you're at it, do you think you could add nice helpful
error messages to every other function call in the kernel? ;)

(Developer) People are generally more interested in development and
leading edge stuff, rather than documenting what they've done and adding
nice usage and help information, so it tends to come along later when
they've got time. This is why linux has traditionally been a 'hobbyists'
or 'hackers' system, because you basically need to have a good knowledge
of unix and C programming to use it. This has changed a bit now, but
it's still true for a lot of it.

And we still see people posting messages like "how do I view a file, and
make it pause on every screen" (answer, less or more) and "How do I
append to a file without loading it in an editor and pasting the new
stuff" (answer, &gt;&gt;). What's scary is that we even sometimes see people
who have taglines reading "System Administrator" or "Lead developer"
asking about basic subjects.
I know we've all got to start somewhere, but are they giving out SysOp
badges on the back of cornflake packets now?


&lt;/rant&gt;
&lt;hides under fire blanket&gt;
&lt;goes back to work&gt;
