&gt;Subject: Linux Certification by Sylvan and other snippets

[Deletia]

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I certainly WASN'T impressed by their "re-labelling"
&gt;a Linux HOW TO document (on IP Multicasting)
&gt;as a "Study Guide" (in a way so as to suggest
&gt;that they'd produced it...)
&gt;

Hmmm, yes, I sent email to Tobin and pointed out that in any case, the
section on Multicast stuck out like a dog's reproductive appendages (which
might have pissed him off), but he responded saying that it was essentially
a filler.

At one time or another, we all suffer from time compression, and are forced
to run with whatever we have in order to meet a deadline :-(

However, as more serious concern I have with the SAIR stuff (which is what
Sylvan is going with) is that it does not have the support of the Linux
community.  The majority of the distro producers are supporting the LPI
initiative (www.lpi.org).
