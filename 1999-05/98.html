I already have learn't quite abit about Linux from this group, and it is
good to have "pro" discussions happening 
because even if you don't understand all of it, some of it sinks in. I
did search for the HOWTO, and read the the pppd 
howto but it was all command line and I tried the examples and they all
failed.. Then I read the Help files in linuxconf
for ppp and I was unable to get relevent help from that, I also read the
pppd man page, before I asked this group.

Regards,

Neil Ridley

&gt;Neil,
&gt;
&gt;Don't worry about some of the original members of this list.  At least your
&gt;gender was not refered to and you were not told you will end up in tears.
&gt;Good list to watch because some of the stuff gets pretty technical.  You'll
&gt;pick up a lot in the general feel of linux.  I'm new too and i don't get
&gt;much Linuxing done but I've learnt heaps just by reading about what they put
&gt;up on this list.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely
&gt;Natalia.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small Network (2 pc's)
&gt;&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to connect to my
&gt;&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt;&gt; resolve addresses
&gt;&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt;&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I have called
&gt;&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have the loopback
&gt;&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt;&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au.. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through Linux?
&gt;&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything except for
&gt;&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Regards
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Neil Ridley..
