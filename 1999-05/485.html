The only problem with only replying off-list is that nobody else knows who
answered the question, so if another non-pro asked the same questions later
on, it does happen, they would have to ask again and hopefully get an
answer.

Okay so they would still have to ask, but they could be told, "Well that was
answered approx &lt;enter date&gt;, have a look at <A HREF="http://&lt">http://&lt</A>;some url&gt; and see if
that helps, if not, let us know."

Which is more helpful than "Well this was answered, we think, not sure, umm
lookup a similar question from &lt;enter date&gt;, by looking at <A HREF="http://&lt">http://&lt</A>;some
url&gt;, email the person that asked the question, see if they got an answer
and ask them to give it to you, along with any other info they have
gathered. See if they can help you resolve the problem, as they probably
should/would have, and if not then come back and tell us all of this info
and we shall see if we can help".

Which seems easier. Personally, I love seeing all the answers to all
questions posed, whether pro questions or non-pro question. The answers
usually have small gems, and sometime massive diamonds of information.

The short version: Answers off list, help 1 person, on list, help everyone
(whether they need it or not!).

As I have said before, pro's are non-pro's in areas where they are not pro's
(should I be a politician or what with this answer???)

Natalia, I hope you learn all the information you need from this list, there
are many wonderful people on it with the answers you need, but just like
anywhere, there are people who have a question but will not ask it for fear
of looking stupid.

Should they be penalised for not asking the question in the first place ????

If you are new to Linux, welcome.

Rob

Subject: questions - thorns amongst roses


&gt;
&gt; As a newbie-newbie I have to make a point.  I have been put off
&gt;Linux for some of the things that I've read on this list and, seriously,
the
&gt;lack of support to anyone new to Linux. I mean there is no one to talk to
&gt;about it at the beginning, as a newbie in the sense similar to what a MS
&gt;newbie is, only stuff you can read and for real boffins (no offence
intended
&gt;here) this may be OK but not for a lot of up and coming newbies. Linux is
&gt;getting a real plug at the "am new to computer OS's altogether" end of the
&gt;market (that not being me though). Sorry but Linux is not easy to get used
&gt;to in comparison to other OSs.  The beauty of Linux is that once you master
&gt;it, it is very, very good and efficient and fast and that is why so many
&gt;newbies get attracted to it.  I don't have a problem with categorising as
&gt;long as I can come to grips with Linux.  But if someone asks a question, I
&gt;don't think the answer should be posted on the list but directly to the
&gt;person who asked.  If anyone else wanted to know they would have asked
also.
&gt;This will minimise the incredible amount of stuff floating on this list
&gt;which I suspect is mostly what's getting up everyone's noses - seeing the
&gt;same answer over and over again and not necessarily seeing the same
question
&gt;over and over again.
&gt;
&gt; ?????
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely
&gt; Natalia
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, because I am a community minded person concerned with the
&gt;&gt; ill-will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that the various debates re: newbie questions etc have been debated
on
&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; list, ALL newbies should feel free to email their queries to me
DIRECT
&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@senet.com.au">lloy0076@senet.com.au</A>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;With all respect, this is precisly what Matthew, after a lot
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;of thought, has asked people on the list specifically *not*
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to do.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I would have thought from your statements above that you would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;have been the first person to respect such a request.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Matthew is obviusly trying to correct the dysfunctional behaviour
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;on the list and not to segment the LinuxSA group into multiple
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;camps.  Your suggestion undermines that goal, without giving
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Matthew's attempt a chance.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; GEEZ!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In deference to Matthew Tippett I withdraw that offer. All questions
&gt;&gt; regarding linux should therefore be directed to
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If I  i n a d v e r t e n t l y  receive any requests for help from
people
&gt;&gt; whom I do not know then I shall forward them unedited to
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.</A>
