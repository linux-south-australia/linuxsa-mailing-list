hi,

I have a computer running as a gateway/proxy/etc, using RedHat 5.2, with
squid-novm-1.1.22-2 (from the RH5.2 dist). It was a while since I changed
the config file, but from memory, I think I only changed the information
about how much space on teh HDD and in RAM to use.

Anyway, I know that the proxy's being used, since the log files grow, the
spool dir gets big, and if I do a 'netstat --tcp' while browsing, it shows
the proxy on the proxy's port number.

on the machine i'm on now (running RH6.0, netscape 4.5) It all works, but
if I go to a page, then clock on a link, then press on the back button,
all the pictures get downloaded again (I see the modem lights flashing,
and it's happened too many times to be a conincidence). I don't really
care that netscape isn't using it's own cache, but why is squid not giving
it's own cached files?

Also, I looked at the cache stats through the cachemgr.cgi that gets put
in the ~httpd/cgi-bin directory, and the hit ratio is quite high (IMHO, at
0.3, assuming it's 30%), but the pictures are still downloaded, or so it
seems. BTW, only 120/300 megs is being used, so the spool is not full.

I don't know much about squid (i just hoped it would work when I installed
it), so any help would be apriciated.

thanks,
Andy
