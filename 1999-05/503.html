While looking for the answer to a simple question, I stumbled 
on some interesting Web pages.  After clicking around for a 
bit, I found that they were part of the Linux Documentation 
Project -- the System Administrator's Guide.  

I found that a number of questions that I had stumbled over, 
plus others recently thrown around in this list, were covered 
quite well by this documentation.  

To my embarrasment, I found that the pages had been installed 
on my Linux system all along.  If only I'd found them earlier...

(Incidentally, I found them using the locate(1L) command.  If 
locate complains that the database is out of date, use 
updatedb(1L) to rebuild the summary of all files on the system.
You probably need to be logged in as root to run updatedb.)  

If you've got X windows up, and have Netscape going, then look at:

	<A HREF="file:/usr/doc/LDP/sag/index.html">file:/usr/doc/LDP/sag/index.html</A>

Of course, these documents can't directly help if your system 
has major problems.  But if you're trying to get the hang of 
Linux, having successfully installed the system [from a CD], 
then you probably can access these files... unless you didn't 
install the documentation off of the CD!  

I've included the (short) table of contents below, and then 
an extract from the guide to give you a bit more of a feel 
of the information.  The extract is to do with the system 
initialisation that was discussed a week or so ago.  Some of 
the "lack of consensus" issues listed in the extract have 
been resolved -- this is a by-product of the rapid maturing 
of the system over the last two or three years.  Another 
force for consensus has been the dominance of particular 
distributions, such as Red Hat.  

cheers,

Run levels

A run level is a state of init and the whole system that defines 
what system services are operating.  Run levels are identified by 
numbers, see table 7.1.  There is no consensus of how to use the user 
defined run levels (2 through 5).  Some system administrators use run 
levels to define which subsystems are working, e.g., whether X is 
running, whether the network is operational, and so on.  Others have 
all subsystems always running or start and stop them individually, 
without changing run levels, since run levels are too coarse for 
controlling their systems.  You need to decide for yourself, but it 
might be easiest to follow the way your Linux distribution does things. 


	0:   Halt the system.
	1:   Single-user mode (for special administration).
	2-5: Normal operation (user defined).  
	6:   Reboot. 
  
Table 7.1: Run level numbers

Run levels are configured in /etc/inittab by lines like the following: 

      l2:2:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 2 

The first field is an arbitrary label, the second one means that this 
applies for run level 2.  The third field means that init  should run 
the command in the fourth field once, when the run level is entered, 
and that init should wait for it to complete.  The /etc/init.d/rc  
command runs whatever commands are necessary to start and stop 
services to enter run level 2. 

The command in the fourth field does all the hard work of setting up 
a run level.  It starts services that aren't already running, and stops 
services that shouldn't be running in the new run level any more.   
Exactly what the command is, and how run levels are configured, depends 
on the Linux distribution. 

When init  starts, it looks for a line in /etc/inittab  that specifies 
the default run level: 

      id:2:initdefault: 

You can ask init  to go to a non-default run level at startup by giving 
the kernel a command line argument of single or emergency.  This allows 
you to choose the single user mode (run level 1), which is described 
in section 7.5. 

While the system is running, the telinit command can change the run
level. 
When the run level is changed, init runs the relevant command from 
/etc/inittab.
