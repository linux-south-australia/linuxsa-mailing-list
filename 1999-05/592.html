&gt; &gt; Remember why it's being proposed too:  The only reason we're going
&gt; &gt; through any of this stuff is because some conservative elements don't
&gt; &gt; like photos of naked women.  That's it.  The end.  The debate isn't
&gt; &gt; about children (since the new law restricts adults), it isn't about
&gt; &gt; illegal content (because the new law restricts material which is
&gt; &gt; legal in other media), it isn't about terrorism (because there has
&gt; &gt; never been a single case of any terrorist activity traced back to the
&gt; &gt; Internet), it's purely and simply about pictures of naked women.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is that so overwhelmingly important that we should have a well-organized
&gt; &gt; international police force to act as arbiters of taste and community
&gt; &gt; standards?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt;         Which of course would make anyone shake their head and say 'why
&gt; bother with such a trivial thing when there are so many more pressing issues
&gt; at hand ?'
&gt; 
&gt;         It does not seem rational ...
&gt; 

Oh don't look to out pollies for rational... Recently I was attacked in
our SA upper house of Parliament by a Liberal MLC who claimed that I am
in some sort of conspiratorial league with the Labor Party and the CFMEU
(builders union) because media releases by all three of us 'used the
same typeface, and hence must have come from the same typewriter'.

I ask you all to consider as I did that the only thing the
(honourable??? MLC) has in common with Sherlock Holmes is the century
they apparently live in.

Oh me, oh my, and we sell ourselves as the IT state. How embarrasment.
