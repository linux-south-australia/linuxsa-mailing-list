&gt; Hey All,
&gt;
&gt; I've just bought, well, actually, a friend of mine has bought and asked me
&gt; to set Linux up on it, an Acer 486/50 server that is fullly kitted out with
&gt; SCSI and everything, however, I'm having memory problems with it. I think it
&gt; needs parity memory, but I'm not sure.
&gt;
&gt; When it boots up, it comes up with:
&gt;
&gt; RAM Parity Error
&gt; Press ESC to disable NMI or any other key to reboot

You may see a Dazed and Confused message also when booting

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It does this whether I'm loading Linux or DOS (It has Dos 6 and Win 3.1 on
&gt; the HDD) If I press ESC, DOS boots ok, and it doesn't seem to have any
&gt; problems, but if I try to boot the Redhat boot disc, it either gives a
&gt; Kernel panic or a GPF. I can't remember what the exact error in Linux is,
&gt; but if you want to know I could boot it up and write it down I guess.

Okies, With the price of parity RAM on the up and up as it becomes less and
less
available a work around maybe to only supply the parity to the part of memory
that needs it
Often the parity is needed only in the first 640k, so the parity chip need only
be a 2/4 Meg chip in the
first slot. The rest may be standard RAM, however this may still give you dazed
and
confused messages when booting, but will run ok.

Of course this is a work around that I use occasionally and is not substitute
for the
genuine article. Let me know what the best price you find for parity RAM.
I would be keen to know

Kind regards

Kevin


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If this is the case, does anyone have 16 or 32Mb of 72pin parity ram?? If
&gt; this isn't the problem, can anyone point me in the right direction.
&gt;
