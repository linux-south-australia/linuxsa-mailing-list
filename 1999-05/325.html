Well as far as I can see your assumptions seem to be correct.

Write should return straight away with the amount of bytes written to the
pipe file. Straight away the read happens. B Could rarely get a chance as it
would have to be swapped in, made the active process between the write and
read code in A, there is a window, but is extremely slim.

As far as A is concerned (due to the nature of read/write pipes), the data
waiting there for the read is new data, it doesn't care where it came from.

I would suggest a timeout period and setjmp and longjmp (????!!!?? Check the
man pages). Or a packet header to identify that it came from me. Something
would have to be done to stop a from reading itself.

To be honest I would suggest using the separate pipe idea. You can then
handle the synch by yourself instead of hoping that the scheduler does what
you want...

I can't give you the code for several reasons:

1) No Linux box or C compiler in front of me 8-(
2) C is rusty (okay very rusty!)

I hope this helps.

Rob.

Subject: PRO: (c-code)writing and reading from pipes


&gt;
&gt;there, hope the subject line is helpfull ;)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;ok, two progs (proc A and procB) want to communicate with each other via
&gt;a pipe, or pipes. The communications is to be 2-way.
&gt;
&gt;here are the (relevant) code snippets...
&gt;(error checking, #define removed)
&gt;
&gt;procA
&gt;  pipe = open("/tmp/rip_pipe", O_RDWR);
&gt;
&gt;  count = write(pipe, buff, 2);
&gt;
&gt;  read(pipe, buff, 2));
&gt;
&gt;procB
&gt;  pipe = open("tmp/rip_pipe", O_RDWR);
&gt;
&gt;while(1) {
&gt;  FD_SET(pipe, &fdSet);
&gt;  FD_ZERO(&fdSet);
&gt;
&gt;  select(pipe+1, &fdSet, NULL, NULL, NULL);
&gt;
&gt;  if(!FD_ISSET(pipe, &fdSet))
&gt;     continue;
&gt;
&gt;  count = read(pipe, buff, 2);
&gt;
&gt;  /*logic stuff*/
&gt;
&gt;  count = write(pipe, buff, 2);
&gt;} /* end while(1) */
&gt;
&gt;bash$&gt; mkfifo /tmp/rip_pipe
&gt;
&gt;this is what I think is happening.
&gt;
&gt;  o   procA writes to the pipe
&gt;       \--&gt; the write is successfull (buffered is some magic kernel
&gt;buffer ??)
&gt;  o   procB isn't swapped in by the kernel, and so the select() doesn't
&gt;get a chance         \--&gt; or something....
&gt;  o   procA reads the pipe
&gt;       \--&gt; the read is successfull, and the same data back as it wrote.
&gt;
&gt;As far as the reads and writes being successful, this is true. The bytes
&gt;read and written have been checked, the data read is in fact the same as
&gt;that written.
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone confirm/deny my guess as to what's happening?
&gt;
&gt;One alternative to this is to have 2 pipes (1 read and 1 write), but I'd
&gt;like this solution better.
&gt;
&gt;If I haven't explained it well enough, I'd be glad to say it all again
&gt;:).
