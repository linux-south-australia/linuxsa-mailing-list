 could use bash and tcl, or python and GTK+ to write a vcd in 45 seconds.
Or I code code up completely fresh one from scratch in C in a couple of
weeks.

The difference will be, that mine will still compile and run in 10 years
from now. 
Your Delphi code will cease working with the 'latest release' of windows in
under a year from now.

In the near future, you will have to ditch all of your old OLE code and
upgrade it to OLE-3
or whatever, which will require Win2000, which will require IE 6, etc, etc.
As soon as you 
get to that point, MS will announce 'An end to OLE - MS-XML is the way of
the future', and
off you go again ...

As far as coolness, there is nothing cooler than crunching text, with the
possible
exception of coding intelligent weapons systems.

	Not slamming anyone here, but can someone show me how to write a vcd
player
	in 30secs ? I just did the other night with Delphi and Win98, now
that is
	cool.

	I don't consider cut and paste "cool", in fact I find it uncool. Ok
some M$
	software crashes. So does some Linux software. It's not a case of M$
can't
	write software without bugs and the Linux community can, untrue.
Bugs are
	fixed more often (well fixed!) in OSS software than M$ does true.

	Don't just lump all of M$ together and go SHIT and Linux - GOLD.

	Can we can the M$ bashing in this list and concentrate really on the
	concentrate on the important things like hmm Linux and Linux related
	problems. We can sit and feel smug that we have a Superior OS (which
is
	true!) but don't criticise just because it's M$. I really haven't
heard any
	sling off at Mac, Sun Microsystems (hmm it's Unix, why should we I
hear!),
	Be (of BeOS fame, is that the Company name, doesn't matter, you get
the
	idea!).

	&lt;steps off of own soapbox!&gt;

	Rob.

	P.S. I do not advocate M$, and I know I am a slight hypocrite
(nobody needs
	point this out). The M$ shows that I am slinging off at Microsoft,
but you
	must admit the $ is accurate in terms of their money making ability,
I think
	they are getting their own printing press shortly!

	&gt;&gt; An advocacy experience:
	&gt;&gt;
	&gt;&gt; After dutifully explaining the benefits of Linux to someone in
the
	&gt;&gt; education market,
	&gt;&gt; I'm feeling quite depressed (yet again) as they have just gone
out and
	&gt;&gt; purchased a room full beautiful PC's
	&gt;&gt; with Windows 98, obviously pre-installed.
	&gt;&gt;
	&gt;&gt; Does anyone out there have any good news?
	&gt;
	&gt;well..  I've spent all day using cut, paste and grep in script
files to
	&gt;parse text files.  I've done everything I've needed to do
(basically
	produce
	&gt;a standardised name and address database from lots of little bits)
in less
	&gt;than half the time it would have taken me using M$ "tools".
	&gt;
	&gt;I've also been recording bug after bug after bug after bug in MS
Access as
	I
	&gt;create a database interface that my boss can use.
	&gt;
	&gt;eg, Jet won't import a file which has more than one "." in its
name.
	&gt;
	&gt;And it won't even -look- at text files unless they have CR/LF...
unlike my
	&gt;unix files, which have CR only.  It gives me a good error though..
"Error:
	&gt;Overflow.  [OK]"
	&gt;
	&gt;Excel has real hassles saving as text files.. it spasmodically puts
quotes
	&gt;around number figures because they have more characters than it
expects.
	&gt;
	&gt;Importing fixed-width ascii files into excel is a pain, because it
looks at
	&gt;the first few records to see how long every other record in the
file will
	be
	&gt;and then fucks up when you try to change the field sizes.
	&gt;
	&gt;I'm just about to start installing linux as our primary smb file
server
	here
	&gt;at work.  It's also going to do internet sharing (ipmasq) and
proper email
	&gt;handling, and an intranet, and it's not going to crash every ten
minutes
	&gt;like our current (albeit windows 98) machine.
	&gt;
	&gt;Microsoft products suck if you want to do anything cool with them.
	&gt;
	&gt;Unix products rule for everything cool.  If you want to parse a
text file,
	&gt;get information, use funky cut and paste and grep &c commands, and
have a
	&gt;system that generally knows what the fuck you're talking about, use
unix.
	&gt;Linux, specifically :)
	&gt;
	&gt;I truly pity these poor souls who just purchased that roomfull of
hell and
	&gt;trouble.  Maybe soon people will learn...
	&gt;
	&gt;Bye all.  Back to work.
