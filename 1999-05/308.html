<H1>Problems with Mylex DAC960PG</H1>

Hi,

at one of my sites we run a pair of production machines:

   Dual PentiumPro 200's with 256MB and Mylex DAC960 RAID controllers
   with 4 9G disks, two for data, one for parity and one standby.
	
   The DAC960PGs are the tri-channel UW SCSI jobs with 32MB of cache, 
   but we currently only use one channel.

   We run essentially RedHat Linux with a 2.0.35 kernel.

The two machines back each other up.

One of the machines has been rock solid for the last 8 months, but one of
them has had a penchent for hanging.

The hangs seem to occur when we are rsync'ing the file system from the
production machine to the backup machine. 

On this second machine, the DAC960PG every now and then gives up on one of
the drives, and we have had it rebuild the RAID set on the standby and then
take another error, and go critical as it has no backup.

A little jiggery-pokery in the RAID management console mode stuff can
eventually convince it to take the disks back, but it is a bit of a pain to
have to take the machine down.

Has anyone had any experience with these Mylex controllers?  Does anyone
have any sugestions?

Currently scheduled activities are to upgrade the Linux driver to the
latest, and to upgrade the DAC960 firmware to the latest, but it is the
same as its partner in the other machine.

Suggestions to upgrade to a more recent version of Linux will be unhelpful,
as this is a production machine, and we will not get an opportunity until
end of financial year processing is complete sometime in August.
