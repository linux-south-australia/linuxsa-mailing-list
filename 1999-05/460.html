PS A long discussion about certification and the value of the paper it's written on. I know that a lot of the discussion is about MS and Novell but the parallels can be drawn to the Linux/GNU circumstance.

2)  Feature Article:
There Are Too Many Paper MCSEs/CNEs Out There!
"
Lets face it. There are too many paper certified IT professionals in our Industry. Each of these individuals has a tremendous contribution to offer once their education has been tempered with real world experience. But how to get them to that stage?

The large vendors, like Microsoft, Novell, Cisco and Lotus that have been pushing certification for many years have done us all an injustice by ignoring the problem. To some degree, it is understandable. The main objective of these vendors is to create enthusiasm for their products. I sat through a Novell Education seminar once where the entire topic was, "How to create an evangelistic fervor through education". But, a certification with a watered down reputation does no one any good - neither the vendors nor the individuals who sweated the long hours to become certified.

It is time to tackle this problem. It is necessary to tack on an apprenticeship experience to Certification. If completing your certification is like graduating from Medical School, an apprenticeship is like doing an internship at the local hospital. There must be a formal program to provide recently certified individuals with the skills to research and apply problem solving skills in a real world situation.

The big question is how to do this? One answer would be to add a probationary requirement to the certification. The assumption would be that the newly minted Certified Professional would be getting the experience necessary on-the-job to complete the program. But this is just an
assumption. What if the individual was typing resumes all day. Quite obviously, there would be no networking real world skills being developed.

A better answer is offered by No-Wonder (<A HREF="http://www.nowonder.com/certs">http://www.nowonder.com/certs</A>). This is a web site that answers your real world problems for free. This is accomplished by pairing off volunteer consultants with people who have submitted real life problems. What is interesting is the 'certification' that No-Wonder provides once their volunteer consultants have answered a set
number of problems over a 3 month period. All the responses of a consultant are then presented to a panel of peers to determine if the consultant is 'certified'.

This is a great idea. This is a way to give real world experience to new, up and coming Certified Professionals while at the same time providing tremendous good to the computing public.

Major vendors should get behind a program like this. They could contribute by providing software for the apprentice. An example of this is the offer that Microsoft has right now for resellers. You can get a low cost, licensed copy of Exchange 5.5 for $125 USD.

The industry needs to address the problem of paper MCSEs/CNEs. We all know there is a problem. Let's get moving and talk about solutions. Send me your answers and I will post the best of the answers on Cramsession.
