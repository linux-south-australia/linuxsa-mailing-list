&gt; If you don't do that, you need to do things manually...  or... will
&gt; linuxconf help us here?  I've never really used it..  Anyone know?

I've always setup my networking using netcfg. The best thing about it IMHO,
is that when you load it, it'll show you which devices can be seen by the
computer. Also, it's really easy to use (again, IMHO) :) Incase anyone
cares, netcfg was _the_ first program I ran once I got X working :)

If you've got a PCI network card that's supported by Linux, then normally
just loading linux will load the modules (assuming it's done in modules),
then you just use netcfg to set it up. If you've got an ISA net card (like
me), what you do is try to get the modules for your card loaded (look at the
isapnptools package, and maybe the Ethernet-HOWTO, although I didn't need
to), then load netcfg to see if the computer sees the card. if not, try
again, it it does, configure it :)

I've never used linuxconf, but I have looked at it a few times. I don't
think it tells you which devices are already seen by the OS, like netcfg
does, but I think you may be able to check jsut by typing "ifconfig" anyway.
Actually, I don't think ifconfig shows unconfigured devices? well, there's
other ways to check, perhaps by looking at /proc/interrupts and looking for
one being used by the net card. Well, I use netcfg :)

good luck,
Andy
