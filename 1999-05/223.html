  CG&gt; Hi, Can anyone recommend books specific or helpful to Debian
  CG&gt; from personal experience.  

Sorry that I can't answer from _personal experience_ (I've never read
any unix books).  However, here are four (anonymous) extracts from a
recent thread on the debian-user mailing list (search the archives for
more information):

 Subject: Recommendation for best Linux book 

 *  If you don't want a 1500 page book, go for O"Reilly. "Running Linux" is
    a good starting point. "Linux in a Nutshell" is an excellent reference,
    that includes most Linux commands, covers bash, emacs, vi, system
    administration and lots of other stuff.

 *  I've used "Running Linux" and "A Practical Guide to Linux".  I think
    "Guide" is better.  It's by Mark G. Sobell

 *  I got a lot out of "Running Linux", but I find that the most useful
    Linux book to me now that I've progressed from newbie to post-newbie,
    is "Linux in a Nutshell".  I have a hideous memory for command syntax,
    especially if I don't use the particular command very much, so "Linux
    in a Nutshell" is never far from my desk.

 *  Linux press has a book that does a lot of what you are asking.  It is
    written by Dale Scheetz, who is a Debian developer.  It comes with 4
    Debian 2.1 CDs It is much more than just an installation book, it
    deals with issues that anyone using Linux should be familiar with.
    The best part: you can down load an electronic copy for free, at
    www.linuxpress.com. If buy the hard copy, you get 30 days of email
    support.  The price is about $40, but you can get it for about $32 on
    Cheapbytes web site.

footnote to last "quotation": the thread went on to say that someone was
going to package up the electronic version of the book.  But you
probably want a hard-copy (now!) anyway.

HTH,
