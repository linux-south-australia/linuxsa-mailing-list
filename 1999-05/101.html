Thanks Toby I accept your criticism as a new user, maybe I am not as
intellectually gifted as you, But I would expect as Linux gains in
popularity you are going to be irritated as hell at the stupid questions
people ask. So may be an alternate mailing list is a good idea!

&gt;
&gt;There's a nice set of HOWTOs for all this.
&gt;cd /usr/doc/HOWTO
&gt;
&gt;and check out the Networking-Overview, the NET-3-HOWTO, and the
&gt;PPP-HOWTO, and the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO. It's probably worth reading the
&gt;IPCHAINS-HOWTO as well.
&gt;
&gt;Just skim read through those, and you'll gain a massive understanding
&gt;about how everything works. If you ever have a question, there's usually
&gt;a howto or faq that has the answers.
&gt;
&gt;It'd be nice if the mailling list was used for things that aren't
&gt;already covered in the documentation. Tracking down bugs, fixes for said
&gt;bugs, generating new ideas, brainstorming over complex problems....
&gt;
&gt;Instead, the list these days seems to have become more like a "Help -
&gt;I've just installed linux, I don't understand Unix, and I'm too lazy to
&gt;read the masses of documentation, or at least figure it out for myself.
&gt;Can someone set my PC up for me so I can get online and use netscape and
&gt;read email?"
&gt;
&gt;This isn't particularly directed at you Neil, just some people on this
&gt;list in general.
&gt;Someone was even asking "how do I view a file and make it stop on every
&gt;page?" a few days ago.
&gt;'more' is a command that's fairly universal. If you don't even know
&gt;about it, maybe people should consider buying a book on the subject of
&gt;Unix. There are many fine ones out there.
&gt;Redhat even came with one in the boxed form, from what I recall.
&gt;
&gt;Linux people tend to be sharing caring folks, unlike MSCEs who usually
&gt;want upwards of $100/hr for their time. However, I'm sure even the most
&gt;dedicated Advocate will eventually tire of answering the same basic
&gt;questions over and over.
&gt;That's what FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions (including Answers)) are
&gt;there for. 
&gt;HOWTO's are there for when you want to know HOW TO do something.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone want to write a auto-responder for the mailling list, that scans
&gt;thru the question-posts, and tried to determine what it is about, and
&gt;then locates appropriate HOWTO and FAQ s that are relevant, and replies
&gt;with a:
&gt;"
&gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup
&gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/FAQ/txt/PPP-FAQ
&gt;"
&gt;message?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Now there's some flame bait for you.
&gt;
&gt;Yours,
&gt;Toby

&gt;&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small Network (2 pc's)
&gt;&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to connect to my
&gt;&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt;&gt; resolve addresses
&gt;&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt;&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I have called
&gt;&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have the loopback
&gt;&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt;&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au..
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through Linux?
&gt;&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything except for
&gt;&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Regards
&gt;&gt;
