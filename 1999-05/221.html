Maybe it is the 2xCD off a SB16...
I have a 586-100 with the same setup and RH2  took 3 goes at 7hours each to get
a decent working installation.  My soundcard may not be standard type and I
had to boot into DOS to set the CD up before warmbooting to linux off a floppy!!
Lilo installation was a no go, it kept crashing the system whenever I tried to set it up.

It boots in 2 minutes and X comes up fast, so maybe its the fact you use an SX if the
X graphics are slow.

Haven't had time to play with the instalation yet (I have a life :-), so this is all probably cureable....
will get to it sometime and discover the much touted benefits of Linux.

Point being, Linux is not as easy to install as the experts think, unless you are an expert!
.... or maybe if you have all the "right" hardware.

&gt; If you've ever wondered, as I did a few weeks ago, if the penguin would

&gt; tooooo much spare time.
&gt; The system was a 386 SX40 with 8meg and 2x cdrom hanging off a Soundblaster
&gt; 16. Around 350 megs of apps were chosen to be installed including X.
&gt; The RH 5.2 install went
&gt; perfectly........................................slowly.
&gt; After around 7 hours and no glitches what-so-ever I was greeted with a
&gt; familiar login prompt.
&gt; It might take several minutes to boot then a few more to 'startx' but at
&gt; least you have time to get another coffee. You can generally grow the beans
&gt; from seed and still beat X. Next I might try to rebuild the kernel. Should
&gt; be ready by Christmas!
&gt; Maybe Bill could learn something about backward compatibility from this.
&gt;
&gt; And for all those flamers out there, yes, I promise to get a life but there
&gt; really isn't a lot to do in the Alice.
