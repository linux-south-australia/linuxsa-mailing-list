The thing I like most about this thread is the way the subject line is
gradually being refined :)

&gt; Fine, we will just start another Network, "We can call it Air Net or
&gt; something like that".

&gt; &gt;Subject: 	Opinions on New Internet Bill (While I am still
&gt; allowed to express
&gt; &gt;them)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It will be very interesting to see what sort of 'content' the
&gt; powers-that-be
&gt; &gt;declare to be offensive ....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Consider these points (presented in no particular order)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- During the Vietnam War, things went very wrong for 'The System' mainly
&gt; &gt;because of open reporting.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- By the time that the Gulf war came around, the media
&gt; representation of the
&gt; &gt;war was very much back under the control of 'The System'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Closely followed by Somalia, we even had cameras and film
&gt; crews all setup
&gt; &gt;on the beaches BEFORE the troops turned up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Now with Yugoslavia who knows what is going on - we get 'ameteur video'
&gt; &gt;shots of Serbian tanks driving around quite clearly in the open,
&gt; and yet the
&gt; &gt;USAF seems intent on blowing up bridges, refugee columns, and
&gt; water storage
&gt; &gt;facilities ... huh ? The only media that we get is straight from the US
&gt; &gt;Ministry of Truth.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Yugoslavian radio stations, satellite relays, and internet broadcast
&gt; &gt;capabilities have been targetted very agressively by NATO (while
&gt; the Serbian
&gt; &gt;tanks are free to roam the countryside). - huh ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- An article in the age
&gt; &gt;(<A HREF="http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990523/news/news3.html">http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990523/news/news3.html</A>) shows how 'The
&gt; &gt;System' has admitted that all comms into and out of this country
&gt; are tapped
&gt; &gt;and scanned, and analysed by computers. (Purely to protect the Australian
&gt; &gt;people from anti-social elements, of course)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- We have Mr Gates virtually buying AT&T in the US, to own the
&gt; &gt;infrastructure for comms over there, and now he is making a big move on
&gt; &gt;Deutsche Telekom, to own the European comms and cable internet
&gt; &gt;infrastructure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Bill Clinton ..  Big mover & shaker, or pawn of 'The System' ? Whatever
&gt; &gt;the case, whoever controls the Media certainly had the power to
&gt; put him in
&gt; &gt;there in the first place (remember those pathetic im-promptu
&gt; performances on
&gt; &gt;the saxaphone ?), and will certainly have the power to decide
&gt; whether or not
&gt; &gt;he stays or goes. Look at the procession of 'electees' in the
&gt; USA - Reagan
&gt; &gt;(actor), Jesse Ventura (WWF Wrestler / Actor) , etc, etc. If Bill Clinton
&gt; &gt;does not toe the line, who will be next ? Leonardo DiCaprio ?,
&gt; Tom Cruise ?
&gt; &gt;Bill Gates ?  .... dont laugh too loud, just wait and see whats coming.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Australia, home base for US signals intelligence, rushes a law
&gt; through the
&gt; &gt;parliment that effectively gives 'The System' enormous powers of control
&gt; &gt;over the internet in this country, all under the guise of 'protecting the
&gt; &gt;people'. What exactly does this Bill achieve - does it protect
&gt; children from
&gt; &gt;porn and dissident opinion ? - No, not at all. We know that, and
&gt; They know
&gt; &gt;that. What we all know, is that within a very short time of this Bill
&gt; &gt;becoming law, virtually every ISP in this country will be
&gt; technically guilty
&gt; &gt;of an offense under the act. Will there be prosecutions ? - NO,
&gt; NO, and NO
&gt; &gt;again. The System will not be interested in charging anyone
&gt; under the act.
&gt; &gt;It will appear as if it was a big fizzer, and life will go on as
&gt; normal, in
&gt; &gt;fact, every unpunished offence that goes by each day gives Them more
&gt; &gt;leverage when the time comes to act.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The Future :
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is how I reckon it will pan out :
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- The first people to go down will be ISP's who offer extended
&gt; services like
&gt; &gt;building intranets and other applications for customers. These
&gt; first victims
&gt; &gt;will be non-Microsoft shops who for one reason or another, are
&gt; not helping
&gt; &gt;Mr Gates in his cause. Lets call this company XYZ Pty. Ltd. The issues at
&gt; &gt;hand will be about market share, and control of technology. XYZ
&gt; Pty Ltd will
&gt; &gt;be building and hosting sites using standard protocols, whereas
&gt; MS will be
&gt; &gt;asking that they convert everything to COM / ActiveX /
&gt; Office-2000 / MS-XML.
&gt; &gt;XYZ P/L's products and services will be competing very nicely in
&gt; the market.
&gt; &gt;One day, XYZ P/L will go too far, and produce some plugin or other that
&gt; &gt;allows netscape to view IIS-6 pages, or allows Samba to mount an NTFS-2
&gt; &gt;drive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- The first thing that the masses will see of this will be a show-trial,
&gt; &gt;mostly on TV. Suddenly, several years worth of log files will be dragged
&gt; &gt;out, showing a collection of smut and offensive material that has passed
&gt; &gt;through XYZ P/L's servers. The simple fact that those same downloads may
&gt; &gt;have passed through BigPond, ninemsn.com.au, etc, on their way
&gt; to XYZ P/L's
&gt; &gt;proxy server will be ignored completely by the prosecution. Every TV news
&gt; &gt;report will cover the exact same story - showing lurid pictures of half
&gt; &gt;dressed ladies, throw in a snippet of some 'youth' taking a
&gt; drink out of a
&gt; &gt;Vodka bottle at a Marilyn Manson concert, toss in a picture of a web page
&gt; &gt;bearing a swastika, and point the big ugly finger of guilt all
&gt; at XYZ Pty.
&gt; &gt;Ltd.  'Here is an example of the sort of filth that these monsters at XYZ
&gt; &gt;Pty. Ltd. have been pushing on our children'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- The masses will be only too happy to see XYZ go down, and have their
&gt; &gt;customer base moved over to someone safer, like ninemsn.com.au
&gt; for example.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Over time, there will be no more ISP's as we know them. They
&gt; will either
&gt; &gt;become branch offices of MSN, investing big bucks to bring all their
&gt; &gt;operations into line with the MS-way, or face the consequences.
&gt; The ultimate
&gt; &gt;consequence will be to be hauled up before the media as a 'Drug peddling,
&gt; &gt;rascist, paedophile'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Once this experiment has been successful in this country, expect to see
&gt; &gt;other countries adopt the same model.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Will there ever be a prosecution against msn.com.au ? ... what do you
&gt; &gt;reckon ?      If we all ran background processes to anonymously pull porn
&gt; &gt;and offensive material through msn 24 hours a day, and reported
&gt; all of the
&gt; &gt;downloads to the media, do you think that there will be any
&gt; mention of it at
&gt; &gt;all ? - I dont think so.
