&gt; An advocacy experience:
&gt;
&gt; After dutifully explaining the benefits of Linux to someone in the
&gt; education market,
&gt; I'm feeling quite depressed (yet again) as they have just gone out and
&gt; purchased a room full beautiful PC's
&gt; with Windows 98, obviously pre-installed.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone out there have any good news?

well..  I've spent all day using cut, paste and grep in script files to
parse text files.  I've done everything I've needed to do (basically produce
a standardised name and address database from lots of little bits) in less
than half the time it would have taken me using M$ "tools".

I've also been recording bug after bug after bug after bug in MS Access as I
create a database interface that my boss can use.

eg, Jet won't import a file which has more than one "." in its name.

And it won't even -look- at text files unless they have CR/LF... unlike my
unix files, which have CR only.  It gives me a good error though..  "Error:
Overflow.  [OK]"

Excel has real hassles saving as text files.. it spasmodically puts quotes
around number figures because they have more characters than it expects.

Importing fixed-width ascii files into excel is a pain, because it looks at
the first few records to see how long every other record in the file will be
and then fucks up when you try to change the field sizes.

I'm just about to start installing linux as our primary smb file server here
at work.  It's also going to do internet sharing (ipmasq) and proper email
handling, and an intranet, and it's not going to crash every ten minutes
like our current (albeit windows 98) machine.

Microsoft products suck if you want to do anything cool with them.

Unix products rule for everything cool.  If you want to parse a text file,
get information, use funky cut and paste and grep &c commands, and have a
system that generally knows what the fuck you're talking about, use unix.
Linux, specifically :)

I truly pity these poor souls who just purchased that roomfull of hell and
trouble.  Maybe soon people will learn...

Bye all.  Back to work.
