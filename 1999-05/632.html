Hi Rob

There would be some pathetic individuals that would do anything to be in 
the middle of this little Black Hole of smut. We might end up with a 
black-market trade in the smut list. It would of course have to use snail 
mail channels to be legal.

Someone also mentioned that the next "logical" step in this control 
scenario is the vetting of snail mail. After snail mail what next - there 
will be spies, cameras, robots in the house, car, mountain, wherever that 
is ready willing and able to dob the residents in. Why not go a little 
further and get closer to the ultimate intrusion (read control) put an 
implant in every living soul and connect them up to the internet - ouch. 
&lt;thinks&gt; Can not use the internet for this - oh never mind, it was an 
interesting thread.

Legislators, please go and get a life and find something better to do.

Here's hoping that this crap (oh shit oops) does all disappear up its own 
fundamental - right where it belongs.

:-)  Terry

Just a quick thought. Wouldn't one filter software's web sites be blocked 
by
another, because it would have to have examples of what is being blocked or
text describing it, so maybe this whole thing will collapse in on itself
because no-one can actually get the filtering software to begin with 
???????
