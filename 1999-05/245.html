&gt; Not slamming anyone here, but can someone show me how to write a
&gt; vcd player
&gt; in 30secs ? I just did the other night with Delphi and Win98, now that is
&gt; cool.

Good for you.  I believe you'll find that Delphi and Win98 were designed
with that in mind.  So you can put together a few controls in a box and link
in a few libraries together.  Good.

&gt; I don't consider cut and paste "cool", in fact I find it uncool.

What on earth is wrong with cut and paste?  I assume you know that I'm
talking about the unix commands, not the windows commands......

&gt; Ok some M$
&gt; software crashes. So does some Linux software. It's not a case of M$ can't
&gt; write software without bugs and the Linux community can, untrue. Bugs are
&gt; fixed more often (well fixed!) in OSS software than M$ does true.

True.  Oh so true.  Bugs are definitely fixed in OSS software.  And
generally not fixed quickly in non-OSS software.  We all know the reasons
for that.

Buuut..  that's good.  I like having bugs fixed quickly.  Don't you?

&gt; Don't just lump all of M$ together and go SHIT and Linux - GOLD.

Did I do that?  *re-reads previous email*

&gt; Can we can the M$ bashing in this list and concentrate really on the
&gt; concentrate on the important things like hmm Linux and Linux related
&gt; problems. We can sit and feel smug that we have a Superior OS (which is
&gt; true!) but don't criticise just because it's M$. I really haven't

e-Hem.  Did I critisise anything I critisised purely because it's MS?  I
gave many mant many examples of the sorts of bugs the software I have
recently been forced to use contains.  I don't believe I've slagged off
windows just because it's windows.  Have I?

&gt; heard any
&gt; sling off at Mac, Sun Microsystems (hmm it's Unix, why should we I hear!),
&gt; Be (of BeOS fame, is that the Company name, doesn't matter, you get the
&gt; idea!).

Truuuee...   *rubs chin*...  but how many of us, comparitively, use MacOS,
Solaris, etc etc as opposed to windows?  There may just be something in
that.

&gt; &lt;steps off of own soapbox!&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Rob.
&gt;
&gt; P.S. I do not advocate M$, and I know I am a slight hypocrite
&gt; (nobody needs
&gt; point this out). The M$ shows that I am slinging off at Microsoft, but you
&gt; must admit the $ is accurate in terms of their money making
&gt; ability, I think
&gt; they are getting their own printing press shortly!

Good to hear.


Well..  there you have it.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; An advocacy experience:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; After dutifully explaining the benefits of Linux to someone in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; education market,
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm feeling quite depressed (yet again) as they have just gone out and
&gt; &gt;&gt; purchased a room full beautiful PC's
&gt; &gt;&gt; with Windows 98, obviously pre-installed.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Does anyone out there have any good news?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;well..  I've spent all day using cut, paste and grep in script files to
&gt; &gt;parse text files.  I've done everything I've needed to do (basically
&gt; produce
&gt; &gt;a standardised name and address database from lots of little
&gt; bits) in less
&gt; &gt;than half the time it would have taken me using M$ "tools".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've also been recording bug after bug after bug after bug in MS
&gt; Access as
&gt; I
&gt; &gt;create a database interface that my boss can use.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;eg, Jet won't import a file which has more than one "." in its name.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And it won't even -look- at text files unless they have CR/LF...
&gt; unlike my
&gt; &gt;unix files, which have CR only.  It gives me a good error
&gt; though..  "Error:
&gt; &gt;Overflow.  [OK]"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Excel has real hassles saving as text files.. it spasmodically
&gt; puts quotes
&gt; &gt;around number figures because they have more characters than it expects.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Importing fixed-width ascii files into excel is a pain, because
&gt; it looks at
&gt; &gt;the first few records to see how long every other record in the file will
&gt; be
&gt; &gt;and then fucks up when you try to change the field sizes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm just about to start installing linux as our primary smb file server
&gt; here
&gt; &gt;at work.  It's also going to do internet sharing (ipmasq) and
&gt; proper email
&gt; &gt;handling, and an intranet, and it's not going to crash every ten minutes
&gt; &gt;like our current (albeit windows 98) machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Microsoft products suck if you want to do anything cool with them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Unix products rule for everything cool.  If you want to parse a
&gt; text file,
&gt; &gt;get information, use funky cut and paste and grep &c commands, and have a
&gt; &gt;system that generally knows what the fuck you're talking about, use unix.
&gt; &gt;Linux, specifically :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I truly pity these poor souls who just purchased that roomfull
&gt; of hell and
&gt; &gt;trouble.  Maybe soon people will learn...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Bye all.  Back to work.
&gt; &gt;
