&gt; my point is, does it _really_ matter? Will it effect anything? Surem its
&gt; not to spec, and main is defined as returning int, but c (as far as i
&gt; know) has always been known have its rules broken.

I think I will quote from Black Adder II, wherein Lord Black Adder was
heard to say that he thought it was common maritime practice to have
a crew.  In answer: "Opinion is divided on the matter.  All the other
sea captains say it is; I say it isn't."
 
&gt; Thing is, the main program is _never_ supposed to exit.

The thing is, the main program is also supposed to start.  Just because it
starts on your box is no reason to assume that it will start on other
implementations.  Don't you get it?
