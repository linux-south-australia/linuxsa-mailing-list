Subject: Certifications


&gt;I mentioned in last night's meeting that Linux Certification is ramping up.
&gt;
&gt;Here is some more info.
&gt;
&gt;There is an 'open/community' certification effort under way through the
&gt;Linux Professional Institute (www.lpi.org).  This group has received
&gt;'support' from a number of vendors, including Caldera, PHT, etc.  LPI will
&gt;use VUE for delivery of exams.  After the exclusive mentioned below, LPI
&gt;will probably sign with Sylvan Prometric.
&gt;
&gt;There is also a for-profit group, SAIR Inc (www.linuxcertification.com)
&gt;that is also developing courses and certification exams. SAIR Inc has
&gt;signed an exclusive (for 6 months) deal with Sylvan Prometric.


So, it is only the Radio Amateurs of USA, Australia, etc. who are ready,
willing, able & trusted by their gov'ts to reliably administer qualifying
exam's (in the case of Amateur Radio, passing such exams yields the
corresponding gov't Amateur Radio License)?

When will there be similar community examination services available
in Linux circles?

(By the way, in USA at least, the question pool is public... anybody
can study the questions, write a book with their answers, etc.)

In Australia, these Voluntary Examiners get no payment for their
time & efforts... but their central exam producing organisation (aka
Wireless Inst of Australia) collects around $60 for a complete exam.

By contrast, USA's Volunteer Examiners get reimbursed for only
their actual costs... and - even so - up to a very strict limit (after all
an exam costs each candidate no more than $7 or $8 dollars... &
that's for both elements:  Morse Code, Regulations/Radio-Theory;
the amount charged for the exam is restricted by law; thus, those
giving the exam - in USA - are motivated by interest in having
more qualified Radio Amateurs in their circle, not by profit).

Get the idea?
