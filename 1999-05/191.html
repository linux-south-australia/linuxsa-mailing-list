Level 3 Question:

I have a site where the poor users have to go through MS-ProxyServer to
access the net. This site is highly distributed, and some of the more remote
users have trouble even reaching the proxy server let alone the net.

I would like to place a linux box running squid at the remote location, so
at least local intranet traffic is made much faster. If this was done, it
would also require that the squid box act as a proxy to the proxy server.

Now, squid &lt;-&gt; squid proxying works just fine, using the standard ICP
(inter-cache-protocol) setup.  I can only hope that MS-Proxy adheres to the
'standard' for distributing it's cache.  Anyone know for sure whether this
works ?

The other potential bugbear is that the MS-Proxyserver is using NTLM for
client authentication. This would mean that my remote users coming through
squid before they hit the MS-Proxyserver will also require NTLM
authentication. Does anyone know if squid can handle this (by passing the
raw traffic straight through), or will it just get in a gigantic mess ?

Thanks
Steve OC
- who at least qualifies his question with a level code in the subject to
deflect further flames, levels being in the range 1-7, as per the 7 wonders
of the world, the 7 wise men, the 7 days of christmas, etc. -
