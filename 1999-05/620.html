&gt; Agreed that there is no way to check. As the old adage (is that spelt
&gt; right?) goes "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog". How many of
&gt; those
&gt; gorgeous chickie babes (scuse the term) in chat rooms are really 13 year
&gt; boys with lot's of computer knowledge and not much to do with it except
&gt; hang
&gt; out there ???
&gt; 
	Ahhhhh - cyberspace, the reality of human imagination - profound i
know

	I don't think there is anyway to get around this bar the future when
you can scan your fingerprint in and even then. OR - Under-age, sensitive
material can be categorised as TV is and one simply can not get access
without verification.  Parents can set their own categories at service
provider level ie have the choice what the service provider services them
with.  This also gives scope to service providers to sell products at
different rates and develop software which can cope with this sort of thing
and that can only be a good thing for the economy.  Meanwhile at least the
underground economy will boom now.

	Sincerely
	Natalia
