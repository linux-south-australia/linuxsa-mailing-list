FYI:

mirror.aarnet.edu.au can no longer be accessed by people on
the far side of the AARNet international link.

This is because the usage of the mirror by people
located on the far side of the link was destroying
all the financial gains of installing the mirror
in the first place.

This is now implemented by BGP policy rather than reverse
DNS lookup, so people with .com names located on a domestic
network should once again be able to access the mirror.

A very nice side effect is that the mirror is now back
to its previous very excellent level of performance
for Australian users.

A poorer side effect is that the mirror looks as if
it has dropped of the network to people overseas.  This
makes quoting a mirror URL in an international newsgroup
a bit dodgy.

I do have plans to fix this, but not for another month
or so.

Cheers,
glen
