Subject: Apology and explanation...


&gt; Some people missed the hyperbole in my last message.  If you 
&gt; were offended, my apology.  
&gt; 
&gt; Underpinning the message was a serious idea, however: It is 
&gt; good manners to use correct grammar and punctuation when 
&gt; conversing with others, even where the interface is as 
&gt; impersonal as an e-mail window on a terminal.  
&gt; 
&gt; If you think that I'm being too picky, consider this: 
&gt; When using any computer, correct punctuation and 
&gt; capitalisation is essential in most tasks.  Try typing "man x11" 
&gt; (Enter) and see how much response you get.  So obviously, you're 
&gt; willing to learn the rules and play the game when conversing 
&gt; with the computer: How about treating people with the same 
&gt; respect?  
&gt; 
&gt; Style may be amusing, and may help you identify with a 
&gt; group of people you like.  That's okay, but please tailor 
&gt; the style to fit the group you're sending to.  In the case 
&gt; of a group like LinuxSA, a conflicting style just makes it 
&gt; harder to tune into the content of the message, and makes 
&gt; it more likely that people will switch off.  There's a lot 
&gt; of junk on the 'net, so people have learned to filter out 
&gt; irrelevant-looking messages very quickly.  It's your own 
&gt; misfortune if your style leads to people tuning out.  There 
&gt; is no blame attached to this: it's merely a fact of life.  
&gt; 
&gt; At heart in using computers is communication: Always strive 
&gt; to improve your communication skills at all levels: it will 
&gt; pay huge dividends both in conversing with computers and 
&gt; in conversing with people.  
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Brenton

&gt; thing.  Also, I'm certainly not an expert in Linux, though I 
&gt; do have some experience in some other areas.]
