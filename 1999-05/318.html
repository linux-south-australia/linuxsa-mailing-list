For those who are interested, yes, Linux really does mean business!

Last thursday, at my favourite customer site, we cut over to a Telstra
provide Frame Relay network.

We have 192kbps access in Adelaide, with 128kbps in Sydney and Melbourne,
and soon Brisbane.  We have 64kbps PVCs to Melbourne and Sydney from
Adelaide and soon to Brisbane, and we have a 64kbps PVC to the Big Pong,
which I will have to hook up via a firewall soon. We have reasonable CIRs
in each location and can burst up to the access in all locations. The Big
Pong PVC has an EIR of 64k though, to stop Web traffic from hogging all the
bandwidth.

If I hadn't been so chicken we would have been using the Sangoma WAN pipes,
but we are using Ciscos.

So, Linux really means business.

I am still interested in the Sangoma WANpipes if anyone else wants to give
them a try.  They are cheap enough that I may just buy a couple to try out
and create a Linux-based Frame Relay switch.
