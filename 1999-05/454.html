People,

I apologise for having to do this, but things have got to a point where I
think it necessary.  People should not need to think twice about sending
a request to the mailing list.

For those who don't know me, I am the founder and co-ordinator of LinuxSA, 
and consequently I feel it is appropriate for me to speak out on this.
I *DO NOT* want this to continue into a major thread on the list, goodness
knows we have had enough silly ones recently.  

*ALL* responses to this email should go direct to me, unless they are 
explicitely *CONSTRUCTIVE*.  If feel that you should respond publicly then 
so be it.  I will not respond publicly, but will gladly do so privately.  I
hope that other people show some restraint likewise.

I hate to say this, but over the last few weeks I have been disappointed by
some of the happenings on this list.  Some tempers have been frayed, some 
people have lost their cool.  Others have just been plain rude.  I am *NOT*
pointing fingers here, you interpret your own actions on the list your 
own way. 

LinuxSA has grown.  Three years ago (April 96) the meetings consisted of
4 people (including myself) and a mailing list of about 40.  Now the mailing
list is in the order of 400, with almost 7000 emails having passed through
the list since it was created at it's current host in April 1997.

Due to it's size, there is a diverse range of experiences and attitudes. In
my opinion this is good.  I don't think there is anyone on the list that
can say that they are a true expert in *everything*.  We are all newbies
in some area (afterall most of us are human :).

LinuxSA's mission statement is :-

	"To promote and support Linux in South Australia"

Simple. Nothing more and nothing less.  Support means assisting those who 
don't have the knowledge or experience, understand and fix problems.
Part of this includes improving the abilities of its members.

To achieve this we must attempt at least the following :-

	o Act in a civil and friendly manner.  If you feel you have to be
		rude, *DON'T*, we are are civilised people here.  If you get
		heated writing a message, don't write it.
	o Keep in mind that people may not know the 'simplest' thing, some
		people have never used any sort of Unix before.
	o Point people in the appropriate direction to improve their
		knowledge.
	o Flaming is rude, especially in a public forum.  Be an adult, *DON'T*.

Neither Geoffrey nor myself are going to do any of the following to 
LinuxSA :-

	o Split the list - we are all civilised, we should all be able to
		get along with each other.
	o Moderate the list - Free and open discussion is what I founded
		LinuxSA on.

LinuxSA is not intended to be everything to everyone.  LinuxSA was founded
with the above principle, and will remain true to that principle.  Each 
person has to make their own choices as to whether they want to follow that
principle.  I am sure that a vast majority of people on the list feel that
way, particularly the new arrivals on the Linux scene.

Well that is the LinuxSA co-ordinators view.

Regards,

Matt
