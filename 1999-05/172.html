&gt; &gt; QVT Term bugs me.. but I guess that's because I'm used to CRT,
&gt; and I use the
&gt; &gt; "sz" and "rz" commands a lot, which CRT supports automatically.
&gt;
&gt; Why don't you use FTP?

Beca-a-ause FTP is harder to use - more keystrokes - than sz.

I've got a file called hello.txt on my windows machine, I want to put it on my
linux machine.  I type "rz" in linux, CRT automatically brings up a dialog box
for me to select files, I double-click my file and away it goes, then
everything automatically closes and returns me to the bash prompt without me
having to do a thing.

FTP would involve me having to have an FTP server on my windows machine -
which I don't have, and can't be bothered enough with windows and its
Undocumented Feature collection to set up.

I want to send /home/nickm/.bashrc to my windows box - I type "sz
/home/nickm/.bashrc" and again, away it goes, returning me to my command
prompt when it's finished.

I'm a sucker for convenience, as long as it's convenience I can control.

And has everyone tried the newer versions of enlightenment?  DR 0.15.5 is the
one I've got, and -yum- -yum- -yum-.  It is absolutely scrummy.  It's
definitely worth considering over KDE *ducks*.  The interface is much more
intuitive, the default theme is bloody great, and it's just a pleasure to use.

It's also getting even better to show off your linux machine to your friends
with :)  (yay!)

BTW - to the original author of this post - it's "questionnaire", I believe
:o)

Bye.
