I personally totally disagree with Nick only because we must always practice
the basics. Remember that the non-trivial stuff is built up on the trivial
stuff.

ie.
    Today I learnt some new commands
    Tomorrow, I will learn how to shell script
    The next day, I learn how the startup process works
    The following days, I learn some C to read the source to some of the
processes I just learnt that startup
    Next, I write some C
    Then I write some stuff that starts up when Linux does
    Following this I am hacking the Kernel and helping the Linux effort out.
    Now how do I write a shell script again to automatically do something to
this wonderful hack I just wrote ????????????????????????????

This continues ad nauseum. I think Newbies give the Profies the chance to
re-iterate over what they themselves have learnt and maybe learn more. Trust
me, when you teach a subject, you learn more that when you are learning the
subject. Some gems come from newbies that we all need to know.

Everyone should encourage Newbies to this list. All of us are newbies to
some area of Linux. I have not seen a small group of people who answer EVERY
question. I have seen a small group answer almost every question on a
particular area of Linux, Networking ,Samba, scripting, etc.

Not even Linus, know all of Linux. Does a Caldera user know all of Redhat or
Slackware or vice-versa.

Do YOU know every web site with regards to every aspect of Linux? I think
not!

Be nice to newbies and they will be nice to you.

What maybe should be set up is an major size FAQ here with all the GEMS
found on this list, I know there is archives of the mail, we need something
with a nice interface, with classifications, etc. Newbies would be directed
here from LinuxSA.org.au as a starting point. This mailing list is their
lifeline with current and upto date info and of course, someone who knows
the answers to their questions.

Also by defn a newbie, doesn't really know where all the HOWTO's are, where
all the FAQ's are, where all the URI's are. Cut them some slack and play
nice.

Rob.

P.S. I have a fire extinguisher next to me, so if you disagree with me in
any way shape or form, please feel free to flame me.

P.P.S. Has anyone heard the expression "There aint no such thing as a stupid
question ?" - I have an extension to this "- Only a stupid answer!"

&gt;
&gt;Hello :)
&gt;
&gt;The main concern here, I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that
&gt;some people are using this list as an easy way out, and not doing any of
&gt;their own research.  I don't think that it's a stab at anyone's gift of
&gt;intellectualism.
&gt;
&gt;I most definitely agree that there should possibly be another, seperate,
&gt;LinuxSA mailing list, called NewbieLinuxsaSA, or something equally catchy,
&gt;which could accomodate the less technical questions.  Any questions that go
&gt;above the heads of NewbieLinuxSA could be refered to LinuxSA, which could
be
&gt;renamed ProLinuxSA to fall in line with the new standard I've proposed.
&gt;(please laugh..)
&gt;
&gt;It's a whole lot more satisfying answering a question that relates to your
&gt;approximate level of experience.. not that answering "simpler" questions is
&gt;not satisfying.. so a seperate list would probably benefit all round.
&gt;
&gt;Hands up who agrees!  *sticks hand up*
&gt;
&gt;Feel free to flame me relentlessly if you don't agree.  8|

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;There's a nice set of HOWTOs for all this.
&gt;&gt; &gt;cd /usr/doc/HOWTO
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;and check out the Networking-Overview, the NET-3-HOWTO, and the
&gt;&gt; &gt;PPP-HOWTO, and the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO. It's probably worth reading the
&gt;&gt; &gt;IPCHAINS-HOWTO as well.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Just skim read through those, and you'll gain a massive understanding
&gt;&gt; &gt;about how everything works. If you ever have a question, there's usually
&gt;&gt; &gt;a howto or faq that has the answers.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;It'd be nice if the mailling list was used for things that aren't
&gt;&gt; &gt;already covered in the documentation. Tracking down bugs, fixes for said
&gt;&gt; &gt;bugs, generating new ideas, brainstorming over complex problems....
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Instead, the list these days seems to have become more like a "Help -
&gt;&gt; &gt;I've just installed linux, I don't understand Unix, and I'm too lazy to
&gt;&gt; &gt;read the masses of documentation, or at least figure it out for myself.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Can someone set my PC up for me so I can get online and use netscape and
&gt;&gt; &gt;read email?"
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;This isn't particularly directed at you Neil, just some people on this
&gt;&gt; &gt;list in general.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Someone was even asking "how do I view a file and make it stop on every
&gt;&gt; &gt;page?" a few days ago.
&gt;&gt; &gt;'more' is a command that's fairly universal. If you don't even know
&gt;&gt; &gt;about it, maybe people should consider buying a book on the subject of
&gt;&gt; &gt;Unix. There are many fine ones out there.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Redhat even came with one in the boxed form, from what I recall.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Linux people tend to be sharing caring folks, unlike MSCEs who usually
&gt;&gt; &gt;want upwards of $100/hr for their time. However, I'm sure even the most
&gt;&gt; &gt;dedicated Advocate will eventually tire of answering the same basic
&gt;&gt; &gt;questions over and over.
&gt;&gt; &gt;That's what FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions (including Answers)) are
&gt;&gt; &gt;there for.
&gt;&gt; &gt;HOWTO's are there for when you want to know HOW TO do something.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone want to write a auto-responder for the mailling list, that scans
&gt;&gt; &gt;thru the question-posts, and tried to determine what it is about, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;then locates appropriate HOWTO and FAQ s that are relevant, and replies
&gt;&gt; &gt;with a:
&gt;&gt; &gt;"
&gt;&gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup
&gt;&gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/FAQ/txt/PPP-FAQ
&gt;&gt; &gt;"
&gt;&gt; &gt;message?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Now there's some flame bait for you.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Yours,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small
&gt;&gt; Network (2 pc's)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to connect to my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; resolve addresses
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I have called
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have the loopback
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au..
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through
Linux?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything
&gt;&gt; except for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regards
