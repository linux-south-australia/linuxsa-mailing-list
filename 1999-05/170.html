I know it's unusual for me (of recent times, anyway) to 
contribute any technical detail, but anyway...

The C FAQ:

       <A HREF="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq.top.html">http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq.top.html</A>
       Copyright 1990-1995 by Steve Summit.  

does talk about this issue.  I've always found this FAQ 
to be exceptionally good value.  To be fair, GCC is very 
mainstream in its interpretation of C issues [in addition 
to its ANSI C status], and the Intel architecture is a 
fairly straightforward architecture, so most of the 
warnings about unusual compilers/architectures below 
don't apply.  Even so, it's always handy to know a 
definitive interpreation, in case you happen to come 
up against a curly environment...

Here is an excerpt covering most of the recent discussions:

11.12:  Can I declare main() as void, to shut off these 
        annoying "main returns no value" messages?

A:      No.  main() must be declared as returning an int, and as 
        taking either zero or two arguments, of the appropriate 
        types.  If you're calling exit() but still getting warnings, 
        you may have to insert a redundant return statement (or 
        use some kind of "not reached" directive, if available).

        Declaring a function as void does not merely shut off or
        rearrange warnings: it may also result in a different 
        function call/return sequence, incompatible with what the 
        caller (in main's case, the C run-time startup code) 
        expects.

        (Note that this discussion of main() pertains only to 
        "hosted" implementations; none of it applies to 
        "freestanding" implementations, which may not even have 
        main().  However, freestanding implementations are 
        comparatively rare, and if you're using one, you probably 
        know it.  If you've never heard of the distinction, you're 
        probably using a hosted implementation, and the above 
        rules apply.)

        References: ANSI Sec. 2.1.2.2.1, Sec. F.5.1; ISO Sec. 5.1.2.2.1,
        Sec. G.5.1; H&S Sec. 20.1 p. 416; CT&P Sec. 3.10 pp. 50-51.

11.13:  But what about main's third argument, envp?

A:      It's a non-standard (though common) extension.  If you 
        really need to access the environment in ways beyind what 
        the standard getenv() function provides, though, the global 
        variable environ is probably a better avenue (though it's 
        equally non-standard).

        References: ANSI Sec. F.5.1; ISO Sec. G.5.1; H&S Sec. 20.1 pp.
        416-7.

11.14:  I believe that declaring void main() can't fail, since I'm
        calling exit() instead of returning, and anyway my operating
        system ignores a program's exit/return status.

A:      It doesn't matter whether main() returns or not, or whether
        anyone looks at the status; the problem is that when main() 
        is misdeclared, its caller (the runtime startup code) may 
        not even be able to *call* it correctly (due to the potential 
        clash of calling conventions; see question 11.12).  Your 
        operating system may ignore the exit status, and void main() 
        may work for you, but it is not portable and not correct.

11.15:  The book I've been using, _C Programing for the Compleat Idiot_,
        always uses void main().

A:      Perhaps its author counts himself among the target audience.
        Many books unaccountably use void main() in examples.  
        They're wrong.

11.16:  Is exit(status) truly equivalent to returning the same 
        status from main()?

A:      Yes and no.  The Standard says that they are equivalent.
        However, a few older, nonconforming systems may have 
        problems with one or the other form.  Also, a return from 
        main() cannot be expected to work if data local to main() 
        might be needed during cleanup; see also question 16.4.  
        (Finally, the two forms are obviously not equivalent in a 
        recursive call to main().)

        Sec. 5.1.2.2.3.
