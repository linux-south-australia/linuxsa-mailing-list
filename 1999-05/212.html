&gt; &gt; If you don't do that, you need to do things manually...  or... will
&gt; &gt; linuxconf help us here?  I've never really used it..  Anyone know?
&gt; 
&gt; I've always setup my networking using netcfg. The best thing about it IMHO,
&gt; is that when you load it, it'll show you which devices can be seen by the
&gt; computer. Also, it's really easy to use (again, IMHO) :) Incase anyone
&gt; cares, netcfg was _the_ first program I ran once I got X working :)
&gt; 
&gt; If you've got a PCI network card that's supported by Linux, then normally
&gt; just loading linux will load the modules (assuming it's done in modules),
&gt; then you just use netcfg to set it up. If you've got an ISA net card (like
&gt; me), what you do is try to get the modules for your card loaded (look at the
&gt; isapnptools package, and maybe the Ethernet-HOWTO, although I didn't need
&gt; to), then load netcfg to see if the computer sees the card. if not, try
&gt; again, it it does, configure it :)
&gt; 
&gt; I've never used linuxconf, but I have looked at it a few times. I don't
&gt; think it tells you which devices are already seen by the OS, like netcfg
&gt; does, but I think you may be able to check jsut by typing "ifconfig" anyway.
&gt; Actually, I don't think ifconfig shows unconfigured devices? well, there's
&gt; other ways to check, perhaps by looking at /proc/interrupts and looking for
&gt; one being used by the net card. Well, I use netcfg :)
/proc/interrupts wouldnt show the IRQ up unless there was a module (or a
kernel)  installed that was using it..

However, /proc/pci will show it up regardless, and is much easier to
read too.

The catch being that you need a PCI netcard.

&gt; good luck,
