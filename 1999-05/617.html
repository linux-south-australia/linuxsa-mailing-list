Everyone's having a go at the government generally and also saying that it's
unworkable legislation.

I think the government has nfi and I believe that in the short term at
least, the legislation is unworkable.

However, I don't believe the legislation will be unworkable forever.
Technology is simply like that *grin* (probably why I have any interest in
this industry at all).

The government is simply trying to make money out of it - there is no other
sensible reason for it.  I remember having described a speeding fine to a
friend of mine by stating that it was simply a "voluntary tax".  It's all
about money.  The government needs some money to ensure that the
infrastructure of the country doesn't die and with the threat of the GST
getting through, but with severe changes to the original proposition, the
governemnt needs another income source - they've effectively invented
another "voluntary tax"...

Most politicians know the history of prohibition and it's affects - they
need more money so that they can generate more income and if they do this
properly, the "voluntary tax" will be realised, but I don't think they
will - too many intelligent people in the IT industry generally and, to take
the illustration a little further, too many thugs appreciating the money
their bosses gave them in the 1920s.  Who has the most money?  Well see...

The other point is that government is in the process of trying to sell the
rest of Telstra, which as we all know is one of the biggest carriers of data
in the country.  In today's global economy, foreign investment seems to be
the order of the day.  With Marijuana legislation being softened (there has
to be a reason for that) in South Australia (it's just a fine for users),
there's an element of archaicness (word?)about it all.

I don't really know.  I've never had any interest in porn so if that's all
that's filtered, I'm not overly fussed (no flames please - I'm allowed)
either way.  I am really concerned with how far this will go.  Someone has
mentioned already the possibility of useful, educational material on AIDS
being potentially filtered out of "the system".  AIDs is only one issue.
I'm a person that believes that some of the rapes occur because of a
person's disgust at masturbating (yes, it does happen) - generally it's
about power, but we won't go there atm...  Education is what I'm worried
about - access to information is what I'm worried about - having pictures to
masturbate over so that someone doesn't go and rape is what I'm worried
about - the amount of money involved regulating this legislation is what I'm
worried about - and all the other concerns I have is what I'm worried about.

See yas all Sunday...
