&gt; While I am as guilty as the next person as far as asking a quick question
&gt; because I am too lazy to check the HOWTOS, it does raise an interesting
&gt; point ...
&gt; 
&gt; At which level does a question pass from one layer of complexity to
&gt; another,
&gt; and who should be the judge of which layer a question belongs to ?
&gt; 
&gt; May I suggest that we define 7 layers of experience (just like the 7
&gt; layers
&gt; of the OSI model, the 7 days of the week, the 7 members of the G7, the 7
&gt; horsemen of the apocalypse, etc).
&gt; 
&gt; Questions may only be posted & read from the layer that the postee belongs
&gt; to 'And they were alllowed to post their questions, neither above nor
&gt; below
&gt; their place', with very top layer reserved for only a select few - Linus,
&gt; Alan Cox, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; In order to pass from one layer to another, we could impose a strict set
&gt; of
&gt; guidelines, maybe requiring a weekend of exhaustive mental and physical
&gt; testing out in some secluded bush retreat, culminating in a midnight
&gt; graduation ceremony at torchlight for the few survivors. Before the rising
&gt; statue of the penguin, they could then be applied with the secret mark of
&gt; the new level, and be sworn into their new fraternity.
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst this would be extremely cool, it creates a problem in that a
&gt; question
&gt; at one level may in fact have the answer somewhere else. Unfortunately,
&gt; experience is not a linear scale ... there may be some total assembly
&gt; language kernel hacker guru who has no idea how to setup KDE, or there
&gt; could
&gt; be someone that knows every possible thing about Samba and PPP but who
&gt; could
&gt; not write a perl script to save their pet cat.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe a better idea would be to have 1 list for 'Linuxsa_questions' and
&gt; the
&gt; other for 'linuxsa_news', if you must split the list.
