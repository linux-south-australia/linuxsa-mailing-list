 &gt; A synopsis: Jake provided a program with main declared as returning void.
 &gt; I observed that it was obligatory to define main returning int.  Mark said
 &gt; that it didn't matter and that void was fine.  I provided many references
 &gt; to the contrary (although this is not the case in special circumstances,
 &gt; however it is clearly understood that none of us are talking about such
 &gt; circumstances.)

Yawn.  Read what I wrote.  Specifically, see the very first message I
wrote on the topic, where I suggested that the original poster might
like to explicitly exit() and/or declare main() as an int; then
follow-up with every message I've written since where I've repeated
the same damn thing, but gone on to say that in most cases it really
doesn't matter (which is the truth - It really doesn't matter, except
in certain special cases, as Greg Black stated in his followup to your
Argumentum ad verecundiam, and which you've turned around in your
synopsis above).

I mean, what more can I say?  In my first message on the topic I even
made the point that crt0 would get a garbage return value for main()
if it was declared "void", which seems to be exactly the point you and
everyone else here have made, but apparently the root problem here is
that I'm not as xenophobically religious about making that point as
you are, and I used the wrong words to describe the lossage (for
instance, I didn't call anyone "stupid").  Fine, if you want to be a
zealot about it, it isn't my credibility that's on the line, is it?

What is it with you, David?  I thought this whole thing finished at
10:00 last night, but here you are at 12:30 the next day, obsessed
with pathetic minutae which shouldn't have ever been in dispute in the
first place.  Were you ever actually interested in helping the
original poster (who you actually abused with a non-sequitur about his
choice of From: address as soon as he posted his first question, so
perhaps we know the answer to that question), or is this more of a
dick thing?

The fact of the matter is that in this instance we *were* talking
about special circumstances: We had a specific problem with a specific
piece of code on a specific host platform under a specific application
architecture which wasn't doing the right thing (the fact that we
found that the code he posted wasn't as specific as we thought after
the fact is beside the point).  You can argue geneneralities that
nobody else was prepared to argue 'til the cows come home, but that
won't change the fact that in this case declaring main() to be int or
void wouldn't make any difference at all, and focussing on it so
obsessively can only *detract* from efforts to find the root cause of
the problem.

Sigh.

 &gt; Having quoted chapter and verse, and including a reference to the
 &gt; relevant ISO standard, I should have expected that there would be the
 &gt; end of it; but no, we still have argument that void is okay.

Only because you're pushing it.  I gave up on this thread and stopped
posting to it last night (and, save for this one message, vow not to
post to it again henceforth).  What's your excuse?

  [ more imflammatory verbiage deleted ]

Yeah, yeah, sure David -- Take your pills, have a deep breath, relax,
and have a good lie down.  Everything will be better in the morning.

 &gt; Probably Greg (who I quoted half in jest), should be taken more seriously.

And you, my friend, shouldn't be.

End Of Thread.
