IMHO,

part of the problem the gov and parents have, seems to be that material
you wouldn't want your children to see comes from places you don't know
where.

so why not make a top level domain called .sex right up there with .com
and .org etc.

then the people who want that type of material know where it is, and the
people who don't want their children to go there know what to block.
ISP's don't have to do anything.

i can just see tons of people jumping over themselves to get this sort
of domain name too. also the industry continues to self regulate itself
which is what it wants and sites continue to decide what type of domain
they go into. 

also IMHO, if it's so bad you wouldn't want your children to see it, you
shouldn't be looking at it either.
