Hi, we currently run a Novel 5 network with a Linux Box running as the
firewall - inter/intranet server.
The problem is that we would like the Linux box to act like a Novel
client and server so that it can access the Novel server and share
directories.

Here is our current setup.....
Novel 5 - Using IP disabled IPX
Linux 2.2.6 with ncpmount and ncp support in the kernel
Novel clients - Using IP  - NO IPX support

At the moment we can get the linux server to mount the Novel server by
compiling IPX support but disabling it with ipx_configure and it the
users IP this is fine and dandy but a bit awquared.

I would like to be able to share directories on the linux server so they
look like a Novel server. Mars_nwe and ld something look promising but
all seem to only support IPX, as the clients don't have the IPX protocol
they can't access the files on the server.
Is there a way i can fix this? I know about the new Novel project but
that won't be out for months and we need this ASP.

The last thing i would like to do and this is really on the wish list. I
would like an squid authentication module that reads the users from the
NDS tree. I know that it is highly unlikely that this exists, i was
wondering is there any project that would be able to help or some code i
could start hacking? If i can get this it would be cream of the crop!

I have been trying to fight of repeated attempts to have boarder manager
installed on the firewall because I believe linux is a much better
product. Anyway its FREE :)

Any help on the above would be greatly appreciated.
Thank in advanced

Tim
