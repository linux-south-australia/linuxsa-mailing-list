(As advertised, this is not a LINUX SA topic,
so I will ask that all replies to it go via e-mail)

We have a 1-year pre-paid I'net account
with EISA... but have been having lots of
trouble accessing its USENET News Server
e.g. for aus.computers.linux (sp?), etc.

Who can suggest a good, preferably local
(but I suppose that's a big ask...) USENET
News Server that is open to users from
other ISP's (such as myself)?

Of course, I would like to post occasionally,
but even if I had to use a slower one at such
times, while enjoying a faster service at
other times... at least I'd have some access
to USENET news on a regular basis.

Of course, for speed considerations, I would
rather NOT use a browser-based source,
such as DejaNews or the like...

I don't have any hopes of the local public
access ass'n (APANA) of saving the day
here... last I heard, they were one of our
"black holes"... happy to consume the
world's I'net resources (like most of us),
but not as happy to share (at least the
many apana.*.*'s content is private...
as was its news server, in past...)

Surely, there is an open news server
out there to fill the gap...?

TIA
