Yeah 

Good idea for NewbieList but who is going to help all the newbies if all the
pros are on another list?  Most pros are unlikely to be on that list, if as
you suggested you prefer to be on a Pro only list.  Different levels of
experience is the better way.  I don't actully ask any questions since my
intro because I'm to scared someone will bite my head off.  Reading the
stuff you guys put on in here is good and even if a Newbie list would get
started most Newbies would still be on this list asking "simple" questions.
Hello - where is logic???  Exclusive club mentality maybe??? 50's all over
again.

Sincerely
Natalia.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks Toby I accept your criticism as a new user, maybe I am not as
&gt; &gt; intellectually gifted as you, But I would expect as Linux gains in
&gt; &gt; popularity you are going to be irritated as hell at the stupid questions
&gt; &gt; people ask. So may be an alternate mailing list is a good idea!
&gt; 
&gt; Hello :)
&gt; 
&gt; The main concern here, I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is
&gt; that
&gt; some people are using this list as an easy way out, and not doing any of
&gt; their own research.  I don't think that it's a stab at anyone's gift of
&gt; intellectualism.
&gt; 
&gt; I most definitely agree that there should possibly be another, seperate,
&gt; LinuxSA mailing list, called NewbieLinuxsaSA, or something equally catchy,
&gt; which could accomodate the less technical questions.  Any questions that
&gt; go
&gt; above the heads of NewbieLinuxSA could be refered to LinuxSA, which could
&gt; be
&gt; renamed ProLinuxSA to fall in line with the new standard I've proposed.
&gt; (please laugh..)
&gt; 
&gt; It's a whole lot more satisfying answering a question that relates to your
&gt; approximate level of experience.. not that answering "simpler" questions
&gt; is
&gt; not satisfying.. so a seperate list would probably benefit all round.
&gt; 
&gt; Hands up who agrees!  *sticks hand up*
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to flame me relentlessly if you don't agree.  8|

&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: 	Re: DNS/hostname & lUser problems..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;There's a nice set of HOWTOs for all this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;cd /usr/doc/HOWTO
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;and check out the Networking-Overview, the NET-3-HOWTO, and the
&gt; &gt; &gt;PPP-HOWTO, and the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO. It's probably worth reading the
&gt; &gt; &gt;IPCHAINS-HOWTO as well.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Just skim read through those, and you'll gain a massive understanding
&gt; &gt; &gt;about how everything works. If you ever have a question, there's
&gt; usually
&gt; &gt; &gt;a howto or faq that has the answers.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;It'd be nice if the mailling list was used for things that aren't
&gt; &gt; &gt;already covered in the documentation. Tracking down bugs, fixes for
&gt; said
&gt; &gt; &gt;bugs, generating new ideas, brainstorming over complex problems....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Instead, the list these days seems to have become more like a "Help -
&gt; &gt; &gt;I've just installed linux, I don't understand Unix, and I'm too lazy to
&gt; &gt; &gt;read the masses of documentation, or at least figure it out for myself.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Can someone set my PC up for me so I can get online and use netscape
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt;read email?"
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;This isn't particularly directed at you Neil, just some people on this
&gt; &gt; &gt;list in general.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Someone was even asking "how do I view a file and make it stop on every
&gt; &gt; &gt;page?" a few days ago.
&gt; &gt; &gt;'more' is a command that's fairly universal. If you don't even know
&gt; &gt; &gt;about it, maybe people should consider buying a book on the subject of
&gt; &gt; &gt;Unix. There are many fine ones out there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Redhat even came with one in the boxed form, from what I recall.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Linux people tend to be sharing caring folks, unlike MSCEs who usually
&gt; &gt; &gt;want upwards of $100/hr for their time. However, I'm sure even the most
&gt; &gt; &gt;dedicated Advocate will eventually tire of answering the same basic
&gt; &gt; &gt;questions over and over.
&gt; &gt; &gt;That's what FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions (including Answers)) are
&gt; &gt; &gt;there for.
&gt; &gt; &gt;HOWTO's are there for when you want to know HOW TO do something.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Anyone want to write a auto-responder for the mailling list, that scans
&gt; &gt; &gt;thru the question-posts, and tried to determine what it is about, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;then locates appropriate HOWTO and FAQ s that are relevant, and replies
&gt; &gt; &gt;with a:
&gt; &gt; &gt;"
&gt; &gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup
&gt; &gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/FAQ/txt/PPP-FAQ
&gt; &gt; &gt;"
&gt; &gt; &gt;message?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Now there's some flame bait for you.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Yours,
&gt; &gt; &gt;Toby

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small
&gt; &gt; Network (2 pc's)
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to connect to
&gt; my
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; resolve addresses
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I have
&gt; called
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have the loopback
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au..
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through
&gt; Linux?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything
&gt; &gt; except for
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Regards
