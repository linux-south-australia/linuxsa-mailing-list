Hi,

I have a (perhaps misguided) need to install multiple copies of Linux on a
single machine (along with a copy of Win 9x).

What I envision is 1 copy of Win9x, plus copies of RH, TL, SuSE, etc.

I have played around with putting two versions of TL on the one disk, and I
have a spare 8.4G disk that is just looking for something to do.

I have managed to get LILO to work with my two installations of TL (and
that other OS) such that I can boot any of them.

However, they currently boot only one copy of vmlinux (the one on the
partition where I last ran lilo from).

I was thinking of the following structure

   /boot - small partition, maybe 50MB containing the various versions of 
           vmlinux and other support files, like initrd and map files
           for each distro

   separate / for each distro in their own partition, each with everything
            on /

   swap used by each OS when it is up.

Now, in just thinking about this, the various distro's are not built to
cohabitate.  The producers have other priorities.

Apart from the obvious things like stomping all over each other's vmlinux
and initrd and other things in /boot, which will probably necessitate me
using separate directories for each distro, can anyone think of any other
problems I am likely to have?

Has anyone tried VMware and installed multiple distro's? That is the next
thing I will want to do: One Laptop, one 14GB disk, 4 distro's and VMware
and run them all at the same time!
