A synopsis: Jake provided a program with main declared as returning void.
I observed that it was obligatory to define main returning int.  Mark said
that it didn't matter and that void was fine.  I provided many references
to the contrary (although this is not the case in special circumstances,
however it is clearly understood that none of us are talking about such
circumstances.)

Having quoted chapter and verse, and including a reference to the
relevant ISO standard, I should have expected that there would be the
end of it; but no, we still have argument that void is okay.  I do not
understand this continuing debate, in the face of convincing research to
the contrary, that void is okay.  If you think you can autocratically
ignore standards then you are a cowboy.  Your code might work on the
combination of hardware, operating system and compiler on which you first
wrote it, but you have cannot know whether it will continue to work as you
upgrade compiler, operating system and hardware.  If you want to be taken
seriously you should be serious about the quality of your code.  As a bare
minimum you should write your programs to conform to language standards.

Probably Greg (who I quoted half in jest), should be taken more seriously.
