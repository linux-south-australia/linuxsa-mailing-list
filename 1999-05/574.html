All this rhetoric generated by a Govt who think that "Work-for-the-dole"
should be renamed due to the negative connotations in the word "Dole", isn't
that just ground breaking international news that overshadows that little
old internet thingamabob!

I must admit, if that one get's on the list, I might just hand in my
resignation. I suppose then the waiting list to get on work for the dole
will be something along the lines of, you must have been unemployed for 6
years (or employed as a pollie for &gt; 1 minute) and must be grateful to know
that you have the fastest internet access in Oz.

Hmmm, I apologize right now for this bit of cr&lt;backspace, backspace&gt;errm
garbage.

Just a thought, wouldn't LinuxSA get blocked, I mean some of the words that
would be in the archives.... Oh no, stop swearing everyone or this list will
be like the dinosaurs &lt;shivers in little red booties, okay will really be
doing something like this if this things becomes law!).

Rob.

&gt;Hi Mark,
&gt;
&gt;At 14:49 27/05/99 +0930, you wrote:
&gt;&gt;Firstly, there's no such thing as snuff films.  Any politician who
&gt;&gt;claims they're a problem is only showing his own ignorance.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, I know, they're a bit of an urban myth ;-)
&gt;Sorry, I really just meant the stuff politicians refer to, like
&gt;downright gory/offensive content (eg: gore archives with stuff taken
&gt;from "Dan's Gallery of the Grotesque" before it got taken down...by the
&gt;author himself). Point I was making was simply that the SERIOUSLY BAD
&gt;content is mostly hidden away in the quieter hollows of the net.
&gt;Not sitting on popular HTTP sex-sites (which, I believe, are the
&gt;only targets here).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If it became an INTERNATIONAL law/agreement, then there would
&gt;&gt; &gt; be a whole lot less "oh but that's within THEIR juristriction"
&gt;&gt; &gt; crap and they would have to hide in the few nations left that
&gt;&gt; &gt; bauk extraditions and such. They currently use the internationalism
&gt;&gt; &gt; of the Internet for safety from prosecution. So let's turn it against
&gt;&gt; &gt; them by making it the same law wherever they are.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Secondly, this has already happened.  There is nowhere in the world
&gt;&gt;where kiddyporn is tolerated.  Police have been cooperating
internationally
&gt;&gt;on this for years before the internet even existed, and ISPs worldwide
&gt;&gt;remove it where they find it.  There have been several successful
&gt;&gt;prosecutions in Australia for distributing child pornography on the
&gt;&gt;net, which just goes to show that existing laws were working.
&gt;
&gt;Quite true. I wasn't actually sure if it was permanent and well established
&gt;(not to mention financed) yet. But I did hear about those operations
&gt;last year (busting the "Wonderland Club" or something similar wasn't it?).
&gt;
&gt;However, I was more refering to an actual international organisation,
&gt;kinda like the UN (bad example I know ;-) which then co-ordinates
&gt;and directs the cooperative efforts of all these police forces.
&gt;And not just porn, I'm talking about setting up an organisation with
&gt;technically-minded, well-informed specialists who act like
&gt;Internet "Marshalls". Not because I love the idea of regulation or
&gt;censorship; but purely to pre-empt stupid 'stop-gap' legislation
&gt;getting forced into effect by the moral majority (who understand
&gt;practically nothing about the technical nuances of the problem
&gt;they wish to rememdy). I mean, the official documents of this new
&gt;law probably still have liquid-paper over the "must display warning
&gt;sticker on outside plastic packaging..." sections from when it was
&gt;originally the film/literature clasification laws document ;-P
&gt;
&gt;So, I wasn't saying they hadn't done it at all, just not enough,
&gt;and not as ONE mighty organisation/body.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It is a fallacy to say the Internet is unregulated, and the fallacy
&gt;&gt;is generally only promulgated by those who have a vested interest
&gt;&gt;in increasing the regulation.  Restrictions on banned erotica, terrorism,
&gt;&gt;and incitements to violence have always been illegal in all media,
including
&gt;&gt;the Internet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I didn't mean unregulated. I just meant that it can/could be a potential
&gt;juristrictional nightmare, IF there ARE any countries that don't want
&gt;to play ball with each of the other countries involved.
&gt;(There is no one head to the beast, if you know what I mean ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I said it sounded utopian ;-P (albeit slightly inacurate too),
&gt;just anything is better than insisting that the net regress to a senario
&gt;that suits our paper-based censorship system (ie: list it, ban it).
&gt;Many man-hours chewed in just making/maintaining the list too.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;sarcasm&gt; Hey, now there's a job that the 'work-for-dole' mob wouldn't
&gt;knock back: trauling the net for porn to block.  heheheheh &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;-Daniel
&gt;
&gt;PS: I in no way work in the area of international law enforcement,
&gt;so bear with me if my 2c worth is in any way niaeve or just wrong ;-)
