Well, I don"t know laws -rules - conventions etc.....but
Having one machine with two harddisks in it. Harddisk numero one works with
windows98 using 50% of the disk.The other 50% is formated ext2fs with linux
5.2 redhad (It had have three others before like dummy and Caldera ) On the
second harddrive I have a 1/4 reserved for dos/windows with zipfiles
stored.The rest 3/4 is ext2fs with redhat 6.0. BEFORE I had lilo boot from
drive one (hda1) and while startingup had to be very very quick to choose
between windows or linux bootups. I you are not quick enough....you get
windows if you want redhat or get redhat if you want windows. SO I deleted
this lilo boot thing and make each linux now bootup with its own floppy boot
up to boot its own redhad kind. SO that is now peaceful for me ( maybe for
all persioners anyway, who are not so wild goose any more ) Jacob.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I have a (perhaps misguided) need to install multiple copies of Linux on
a
&gt; &gt;&gt;single machine (along with a copy of Win 9x).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;However, they currently boot only one copy of vmlinux (the one on the
&gt; &gt;&gt;partition where I last ran lilo from).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;can anyone think of any other
&gt; &gt;&gt;problems I am likely to have?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;I currently have Redhat, Slackware, Win98 and WINNT on one machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The two linux's (linii?) each have their own partition on the HD, which
they
&gt; &gt;consider to be "/".
&gt; &gt;Each crossmounts the others partition something like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;/dev/hda1 is redhat, also mounts /dev/hda2 as /Slackware
&gt; &gt;/dev/hda2 is slackware, also mounts /dev/hda1 as /Redhat
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now each has their own /etc/lilo.conf, which points to the right vmlinuz
for
&gt; &gt;each system. That is,
&gt; &gt;they both have to match and have equivalent corresponding entries. It
doesnt
&gt; &gt;matter where I run
&gt; &gt;lilo from, the MBR gets a valid entry to boot either system (or the MS
&gt; &gt;ones).
&gt;
&gt; Ahhh, that is neat, at the cost of having to ensure that lilo.conf in each
&gt; area is up-to-date, incase you run lilo from any one of them.
&gt;
&gt; That actually solves my problem better than a common /boot.
&gt;
&gt; So what I would have in lilo.conf is:
&gt;
&gt; image=/distro1/boot/vmlinuz
&gt; label=distro1
&gt; image=/distro2/boot/vmlinuz
&gt; label=distro2
&gt;
&gt; etc.
&gt;
&gt; What about map files?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The reason this works is that the lilo boot process does NOT use the
&gt; &gt;filesystem as such (I think!).
&gt;
&gt; Indeed. When you run lilo, it builds sufficient info onto LILO's config
&gt; that it can find where on the disk vmlinuz is.  As long as I can use LBA,
I
&gt; will be ok.  If I can't use LBA, then I might have to think more carefully
&gt; about /boot.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I havent encountered any particular problems with this setup.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;cheers
