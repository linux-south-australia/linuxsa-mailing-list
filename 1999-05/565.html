&gt;The Govt. also seems to forget that there are products available (ie

&gt;understand!!

Hi all,
&lt;feels obliged to mount soapbox&gt;

Talk about "don't understand"! Has anyone heard any mention of
strategies to track/regulate the ACTUAL source of the nasty porn
(and other tasteless stuff) - ie: the newsgroups, usenets, irc channels,
temp-IP dialup FTP sites, etc. I haven't heard JS! ;-)

I'd also like to know why half the media don't bother researching
the difference between Internet SERVICE Providers and Internet CONTENT
Providers (ie: the sites themselves). &lt;sarcasm&gt; Apparently a lot of
us ISPs were going to have to put PIN-code on 'our' sex sites &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

And then there is the ridiculously un-technically viable method
of checking HTTP requests against a mammoth (yet incomplete) list
of "blocked" sites &lt;shakes head&gt; What a farce!

I think, at the end of the day, the thing I find most ironic is that
it will have the same effect as closing brothels to 'stamp-out'
prostitution: the sex will just end up in the back-alleys.
As soon as this starts to hit hard, there will more likely be an
INCREASE in the number of dodgey (or clandestine) sex sites, because
as we all know:	PROHIBITION	==&gt; GREATER DEMAND
					==&gt; ORGANISED CRIME INFLUENCES

&gt;----- Original Message -----
&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;&gt; so why not make a top level domain called .sex right up there with .com
&gt;&gt; and .org etc.
&gt;&gt; then the people who want that type of material know where it is, and the
&gt;&gt; people who don't want their children to go there know what to block.
&gt;&gt; ISP's don't have to do anything.
&gt;&gt;

I head this idea a little while ago, they were also going to trade in
any existing sex-site domains to the .sex domain for FREE too.
This definately my favourite suggestion by far.
(not to mention the only logical and sane one ;-)

&lt;/climbs off soapbox&gt;

Personally, I think if all the people in the world really cared
about stopping kidy-porn,snuff,etc content, they would get off their
arses and form an international organisation to hunt the offenders
down and not just ignore/block them and hope they'll go away.
If it became an INTERNATIONAL law/agreement, then there would
be a whole lot less "oh but that's within THEIR juristriction"
crap and they would have to hide in the few nations left that
bauk extraditions and such. They currently use the internationalism
of the Internet for safety from prosecution. So let's turn it against 
them by making it the same law wherever they are.
I know it sounds utopian and inpractical but how practical is
5 million line refuse list?? ;-)

Bye all,
-Daniel
