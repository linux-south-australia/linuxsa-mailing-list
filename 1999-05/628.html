 &gt; 	Well - i think you are right that the only way it can be done is for
 &gt; people who actually know what they are talking about to provide governemnt
 &gt; with an alternate solution (ie solve their problem for them) which does not
 &gt; hurt their industry because you can bet your bottom dollar that as usual gov
 &gt; did not consult anyone in the industry.  Go the minister for information
 &gt; technology ( i think this is a portfolio now).  Did she go out and ask first
 &gt; - nah - wouldn't have a clue - probably knows less about the internet then
 &gt; most parents - maybe someone should educate the government first.

The Minister for Information Technology, Senator Richard Alston, is
the perpetrator of this horrible bill.  The man has been educated by
people like EFA, IIA, SAIA, WAIA, the Australian Civil Liberties
Council, CSIRO and hundreds of concerned individuals like myself for
the last four years, but has remained *willfully* ignorant (I doubt
it's possible to remain accidentally ignorant in the fact of that much
dissenting information).

You can't reason with people like that:  He's doing it because he
sees votes in it, and he's pushing a political agenda to get the GST
and Telstra passed.  It's up to us to show him that if he does this
it will cost his party the next election.
