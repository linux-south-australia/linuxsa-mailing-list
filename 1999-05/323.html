there, hope the subject line is helpfull ;)


ok, two progs (proc A and procB) want to communicate with each other via
a pipe, or pipes. The communications is to be 2-way. 

here are the (relevant) code snippets...
(error checking, #define removed)

procA
  pipe = open("/tmp/rip_pipe", O_RDWR);

  count = write(pipe, buff, 2);

  read(pipe, buff, 2));

procB
  pipe = open("tmp/rip_pipe", O_RDWR);

while(1) {
  FD_SET(pipe, &fdSet);
  FD_ZERO(&fdSet);

  select(pipe+1, &fdSet, NULL, NULL, NULL);

  if(!FD_ISSET(pipe, &fdSet))
     continue;

  count = read(pipe, buff, 2);

  /*logic stuff*/

  count = write(pipe, buff, 2);
} /* end while(1) */

bash$&gt; mkfifo /tmp/rip_pipe

this is what I think is happening.

  o   procA writes to the pipe
       \--&gt; the write is successfull (buffered is some magic kernel
buffer ??)
  o   procB isn't swapped in by the kernel, and so the select() doesn't
get a chance         \--&gt; or something....
  o   procA reads the pipe
       \--&gt; the read is successfull, and the same data back as it wrote.

As far as the reads and writes being successful, this is true. The bytes
read and written have been checked, the data read is in fact the same as
that written.

Can anyone confirm/deny my guess as to what's happening?

One alternative to this is to have 2 pipes (1 read and 1 write), but I'd
like this solution better.

If I haven't explained it well enough, I'd be glad to say it all again
:).
