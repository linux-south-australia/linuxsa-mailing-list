<H1>Redhat 6.0 Summary (spoiler!?)</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I have just done a network install of
RedHat Linux 6.0 for Intel, 2CD Set purchased 27 May 1998 - ($25 from
Netcraft)
If you're the type of person who likes to be (pleasently) surprised
then the follwoing might contain spoilers.

--------------------------------------------------------
Installation:  NFS
Needed to create spacific boot disk from /images/netboot.img
  otherwise, CD is bootable, or boot.img is also available.
Installation is identical to Redhat 5.2.
[I miss the option of 'Redneck' as a language but I think that was
removed after Redhat 5.1]

Machine:
i486 40MHz (39.83 BogoMIPS)
Network - NE2000 and compatible (chosen, then interupts etc
auto-detected)
3Gb HDD (hda1 (rest) - , hda5 (66Mb)- swap
[selected all packaged... went to lunch]

[after lunch]
'Which services do you wish to have running' menu
[chose all of these, except ypserv, see below]
'NIS server, Shadow passwords, MD5 passwords' - NEW MENU!
[The machine is working in a NIS environment- it was able to
  find the NIS server OK]

Video - 1Mb Trident TGUI 9440  (auto detected memory size)
Monitor - Meg DX1595
Mouse - Generic 3 button serial mouse (/dev/cua0)
(No soundcard!)

[Choosing something other than the default X11 options,
  maximum resolution at 8 bits gave an error.
I wanted 16 bit colour at 800x400.  When this didn't work I was
able to go back and try something else (ie. pick the default).

The Video setup has two sets.. a hardware probe.. which
blinks the screen a couple of times.. and a 'software probe'..
where X is started with a box saying 'click here if you see me',
and a 5 second timer.

'Do you wish to start X automatically?' - NEW MENU!
'Root Password Menu'
Then, after finishing the installation, the machine
is reboots (after remembering to take out the boot disk).

The messages displayed during the boot process are
slightly different, with coloured [pass] or [fail] messages
for each service started.  A nice touch.

The Kernel:
Red Hat Linux release 6.0 (Hedwig)
Kernel 2.2.5-15 on an i486
[Hedwig is my Mothers name.. so that was a pleasent surprise]

The Xdm (if that is what it still is) login screen looks better than
it used to but Tux has been replaced by a RedHat Logo..
If you put in an incorrect username/password the box
shakes and complains.

A correct login greets the user with
a 'starting enlightenment' progress bar..
.. and it pops into what looks like Gnome.
It seems to be enlightenment with gnome tools running.

All in all it was a very painless excersise.
As to how usable this is on a 486 I don't know.

Space used:
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda1              3001898   1039952   1806716  37% /
