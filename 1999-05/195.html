&gt; Yawn.  Read what I wrote.  Specifically, see the very first message I
&gt; wrote on the topic, where I suggested that the original poster might
&gt; like to explicitly exit() and/or declare main() as an int

Then I half agree with you.  I still take you to task over "or declare
main" as this is not optional.  If you meant, "declare main as int and
optionally call exit", we would be in total agreement.

&gt; apparently the root problem here is that I'm not as xenophobically
&gt; religious about making that point as you are

Artistic, but quite inaccurate.  Xenophobia doesn't come in to it as
I have no fear of foreign implementations.  I think the root problem
might have been your lack of care when stating your opinion.  It hardly
seems fair for you to blame me for interpreting "or declare main as int"
as suggesting an alternative.

&gt; Were you ever actually interested in helping the original poster

I think I am the only person who gave the correct answer.  And I gave
that answer on my first post.  Need I say more?

&gt; The fact of the matter is that in this instance we *were* talking
&gt; about special circumstances

We were talking about void main under Linux.  If you persist in giving
that any credibility then the blame for continuance of this discussion
lies with you.  Stop giving the false impression that void main is okay.

What did you mean by "a dick thing"? [shrug]
