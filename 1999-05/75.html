Here is a classic example :

&gt; Subject:	Newbies and all
&gt; 
&gt; The availability of Linux via free CD's etc. to all computer users is part
&gt; of the push by the Linux community to increase its 
&gt; use.  
&gt; 
	Good so far ...

&gt; The problem here is that Linux is far from user friendly and browsing 
&gt; HOWTO's for answers can be like looking for a needle in a haystack, if it
&gt; has 
&gt; an answer at all.
&gt; 

The very very best possible help system would be
something with a natural language interface, and highly intelligent engine
at the other end ... which is exactly what a mailing list is.

&gt;   For instance,   ... blah .. blah  
	 ...  and reconfigured the kernel after NO system changes it 
&gt; would not compile, time after time.  Nothing in the Howto's help.  
&gt; 
	I am not surprised that you could not find the answer...  

Generic complaints of the nature 'it wont compile'   are completely useless
and cannot be answered. 

Go to the garage and tell them that 'your car wont work'. 

&gt;    Ease of use is going to have to be addressed  
..... or what ?

Note for 'newbies' - Linux is the production of an all-volunteer crew. 

- It is perfectly acceptable to be critical of aspects of Linux, that is
fine, provided that your aim is to highlight areas for improvement.
- The one thing that you must _never do_ is make an inferred demand, or just
whine and winge.

	Steve's famous analogy time :

- It is Sunday, and old Nanna Wilson is slaving away in the hot kitchen
cooking up scones, pastries and chocolate muffins. She  does it not because
she is hungry, but because it keeps her occupied, and helps repress those
memories of what happened back in the spring of 1924 .. also it brings the
grandchildren around.

finally the plate is bought forward and the youngsters devour everything.

	'Hmm nice nanny'      - thats an OK response
	'Could do with more cream'   - thats an OK response
	'Thanks nanna'         - OK again
	'You should cook more than 12 next time'   - that is an OK response
as well

	...

then, down the back is little jeremy, with his shirt hanging half
out, and chocolate smeared on his cheek says 'This food sucks, it dont taste
good, why dont you cook us some chips like they do at McDonalds'

	Nanna finally snaps, and rushes at jeremy ....

Also - on the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse issue, the original prophesy was
of the 7 horsemen of the apocalypse, penned by the sumerian scribe Imnamesh.
(It was actually the 7 wild asses of the apocolypse, since thats all the
sumerians had until the modern day horse came along).
