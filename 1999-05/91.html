I think that the teacher from south pak put it best:-  "There are no stupid
questions, only stupid people."

I'm joking.  :)

Reading all these posts has been mightily interesting.

This discussion is perhaps brought about by some confusion as to what the
list is actually designed for..  I believe Mr Tippett has summed it up for
us nicely.

Also, on thinking about it, how does a newbie know what a newbie question
is?  They might consider themselves newbies, but know a hell of a lot more
answers than someone who professes to be a pro.  Or the question may be one
that the pros have never considered.

And, as someone else said, the pros can always simply ignore the question.
Not hard.

So yeah, perhaps we should be a little more understanding of the people
behind more straightforward questions.

But.. gad.. HTML emails from overseas addresses that say nothing more than
"I can't get X to work, has anyone had any experience with this?" get on my
nerves.  But I get over it and delete them.  :)

PS  I've been tossing around the words "newbie" and "pro" a lot..  please
append each mention of them with " for want of a better word"  :)

*sigh*  Back to work :(

&gt; I personally totally disagree with Nick only because we must
&gt; always practice
&gt; the basics. Remember that the non-trivial stuff is built up on the trivial
&gt; stuff.
&gt;
&gt; ie.
&gt;     Today I learnt some new commands
&gt;     Tomorrow, I will learn how to shell script
&gt;     The next day, I learn how the startup process works
&gt;     The following days, I learn some C to read the source to some of the
&gt; processes I just learnt that startup
&gt;     Next, I write some C
&gt;     Then I write some stuff that starts up when Linux does
&gt;     Following this I am hacking the Kernel and helping the Linux
&gt; effort out.
&gt;     Now how do I write a shell script again to automatically do
&gt; something to
&gt; this wonderful hack I just wrote ????????????????????????????
&gt;
&gt; This continues ad nauseum. I think Newbies give the Profies the chance to
&gt; re-iterate over what they themselves have learnt and maybe learn
&gt; more. Trust
&gt; me, when you teach a subject, you learn more that when you are
&gt; learning the
&gt; subject. Some gems come from newbies that we all need to know.
&gt;
&gt; Everyone should encourage Newbies to this list. All of us are newbies to
&gt; some area of Linux. I have not seen a small group of people who
&gt; answer EVERY
&gt; question. I have seen a small group answer almost every question on a
&gt; particular area of Linux, Networking ,Samba, scripting, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Not even Linus, know all of Linux. Does a Caldera user know all
&gt; of Redhat or
&gt; Slackware or vice-versa.
&gt;
&gt; Do YOU know every web site with regards to every aspect of Linux? I think
&gt; not!
&gt;
&gt; Be nice to newbies and they will be nice to you.
&gt;
&gt; What maybe should be set up is an major size FAQ here with all the GEMS
&gt; found on this list, I know there is archives of the mail, we need
&gt; something
&gt; with a nice interface, with classifications, etc. Newbies would
&gt; be directed
&gt; here from LinuxSA.org.au as a starting point. This mailing list is their
&gt; lifeline with current and upto date info and of course, someone who knows
&gt; the answers to their questions.
&gt;
&gt; Also by defn a newbie, doesn't really know where all the HOWTO's
&gt; are, where
&gt; all the FAQ's are, where all the URI's are. Cut them some slack and play
&gt; nice.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; P.S. I have a fire extinguisher next to me, so if you disagree with me in
&gt; any way shape or form, please feel free to flame me.
&gt;
&gt; P.P.S. Has anyone heard the expression "There aint no such thing
&gt; as a stupid
&gt; question ?" - I have an extension to this "- Only a stupid answer!"

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hello :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The main concern here, I think, and please correct me if I'm
&gt; wrong, is that
&gt; &gt;some people are using this list as an easy way out, and not doing any of
&gt; &gt;their own research.  I don't think that it's a stab at anyone's gift of
&gt; &gt;intellectualism.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I most definitely agree that there should possibly be another, seperate,
&gt; &gt;LinuxSA mailing list, called NewbieLinuxsaSA, or something
&gt; equally catchy,
&gt; &gt;which could accomodate the less technical questions.  Any
&gt; questions that go
&gt; &gt;above the heads of NewbieLinuxSA could be refered to LinuxSA, which could
&gt; be
&gt; &gt;renamed ProLinuxSA to fall in line with the new standard I've proposed.
&gt; &gt;(please laugh..)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It's a whole lot more satisfying answering a question that
&gt; relates to your
&gt; &gt;approximate level of experience.. not that answering "simpler"
&gt; questions is
&gt; &gt;not satisfying.. so a seperate list would probably benefit all round.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hands up who agrees!  *sticks hand up*
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Feel free to flame me relentlessly if you don't agree.  8|

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: DNS/hostname & lUser problems..
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;There's a nice set of HOWTOs for all this.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;cd /usr/doc/HOWTO
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and check out the Networking-Overview, the NET-3-HOWTO, and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;PPP-HOWTO, and the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO. It's probably worth reading the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;IPCHAINS-HOWTO as well.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Just skim read through those, and you'll gain a massive understanding
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about how everything works. If you ever have a question,
&gt; there's usually
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;a howto or faq that has the answers.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It'd be nice if the mailling list was used for things that aren't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;already covered in the documentation. Tracking down bugs,
&gt; fixes for said
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;bugs, generating new ideas, brainstorming over complex problems....
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Instead, the list these days seems to have become more like a "Help -
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I've just installed linux, I don't understand Unix, and I'm
&gt; too lazy to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;read the masses of documentation, or at least figure it out
&gt; for myself.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Can someone set my PC up for me so I can get online and use
&gt; netscape and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;read email?"
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;This isn't particularly directed at you Neil, just some people on this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;list in general.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Someone was even asking "how do I view a file and make it
&gt; stop on every
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;page?" a few days ago.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;'more' is a command that's fairly universal. If you don't even know
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;about it, maybe people should consider buying a book on the subject of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Unix. There are many fine ones out there.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Redhat even came with one in the boxed form, from what I recall.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Linux people tend to be sharing caring folks, unlike MSCEs who usually
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;want upwards of $100/hr for their time. However, I'm sure
&gt; even the most
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;dedicated Advocate will eventually tire of answering the same basic
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;questions over and over.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That's what FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions (including Answers)) are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;there for.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;HOWTO's are there for when you want to know HOW TO do something.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone want to write a auto-responder for the mailling list,
&gt; that scans
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;thru the question-posts, and tried to determine what it is about, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;then locates appropriate HOWTO and FAQ s that are relevant,
&gt; and replies
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;with a:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;RTFM: /usr/doc/FAQ/txt/PPP-FAQ
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;"
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;message?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now there's some flame bait for you.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Yours,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to
&gt; connect to my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; resolve addresses
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I
&gt; have called
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have
&gt; the loopback
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au..
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through
&gt; Linux?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything
&gt; &gt;&gt; except for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
