&gt;&gt; Has any one have an idea if AGP card is supportd by linux.
&gt;
&gt;It depends what card. I beleive all (or at least most) cards will be able
do
&gt;take the console, since it uses standard VGA (?) graphics. For X windows,
&gt;most people use XFree86, so you'll probably want to check if the chipset in
&gt;your card is supported there. (you can check at
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.3.1/index.html">http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.3.1/index.html</A> ).
&gt;
&gt;I have a Diamond Viper 550 AGP in my computer, which works fine under
&gt;XFree86 3.3.3.1 :)


I just upgraded my motherboard to one that has an on-board 8Mb SiS 6326 AGP
Graphics Adaptor. I am only using the default version of XFree86 that comes
with Slackware 3.5.0 (XF86 3.1.something??) and I have got it to bring up X.
Although its only in 256 colours and the resolution looks like its only
480x240 or something ridiculus like that. I haven't had a chance to have a
really good play with it yet though. Anyways, I just wanted to say that it
is possible to get *something* up, even on a chipset that isn't specifically
supported.

Cheers
Dazz
