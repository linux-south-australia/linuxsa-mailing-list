There's a nice set of HOWTOs for all this.
cd /usr/doc/HOWTO

and check out the Networking-Overview, the NET-3-HOWTO, and the
PPP-HOWTO, and the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO. It's probably worth reading the
IPCHAINS-HOWTO as well.

Just skim read through those, and you'll gain a massive understanding
about how everything works. If you ever have a question, there's usually
a howto or faq that has the answers.

It'd be nice if the mailling list was used for things that aren't
already covered in the documentation. Tracking down bugs, fixes for said
bugs, generating new ideas, brainstorming over complex problems....

Instead, the list these days seems to have become more like a "Help -
I've just installed linux, I don't understand Unix, and I'm too lazy to
read the masses of documentation, or at least figure it out for myself.
Can someone set my PC up for me so I can get online and use netscape and
read email?"

This isn't particularly directed at you Neil, just some people on this
list in general.
Someone was even asking "how do I view a file and make it stop on every
page?" a few days ago.
'more' is a command that's fairly universal. If you don't even know
about it, maybe people should consider buying a book on the subject of
Unix. There are many fine ones out there.
Redhat even came with one in the boxed form, from what I recall.

Linux people tend to be sharing caring folks, unlike MSCEs who usually
want upwards of $100/hr for their time. However, I'm sure even the most
dedicated Advocate will eventually tire of answering the same basic
questions over and over.
That's what FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions (including Answers)) are
there for. 
HOWTO's are there for when you want to know HOW TO do something.

Anyone want to write a auto-responder for the mailling list, that scans
thru the question-posts, and tried to determine what it is about, and
then locates appropriate HOWTO and FAQ s that are relevant, and replies
with a:
"
RTFM: /usr/doc/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup
RTFM: /usr/doc/FAQ/txt/PPP-FAQ
"
message?



Now there's some flame bait for you.

Yours,
Toby

&gt; I have added an 10/100 Nic card to my PC to run a small Network (2 pc's)
&gt; for learning purposes. However I need to be able also to connect to my
&gt; ISP. I am logging into my ISP however there are DNS problems, cannot
&gt; resolve addresses
&gt; for http and for my email account. I use RedHat 5.2 and the Control
&gt; Panel in X to configure my Network and PPP properties... I have called
&gt; my PC ".SIS"  192.168.0.0 in Hosts and I also still have the loopback
&gt; 172.0.0.1. entry in Hostnames. I also have the ipaddresss for my ISP
&gt; with the Domain NAME www.blah.com.au..
&gt; 
&gt; Is an ISP ipaddress compulsory when connecting to an ISP through Linux?
&gt; Because when I log in through windows I dont require anything except for
&gt; the phone number, username & password.
&gt; 
&gt; Does some one know what is required here?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
