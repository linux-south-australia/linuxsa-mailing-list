	As a newbie-newbie I have to make a point.  I have been put off
Linux for some of the things that I've read on this list and, seriously, the
lack of support to anyone new to Linux. I mean there is no one to talk to
about it at the beginning, as a newbie in the sense similar to what a MS
newbie is, only stuff you can read and for real boffins (no offence intended
here) this may be OK but not for a lot of up and coming newbies. Linux is
getting a real plug at the "am new to computer OS's altogether" end of the
market (that not being me though). Sorry but Linux is not easy to get used
to in comparison to other OSs.  The beauty of Linux is that once you master
it, it is very, very good and efficient and fast and that is why so many
newbies get attracted to it.  I don't have a problem with categorising as
long as I can come to grips with Linux.  But if someone asks a question, I
don't think the answer should be posted on the list but directly to the
person who asked.  If anyone else wanted to know they would have asked also.
This will minimise the incredible amount of stuff floating on this list
which I suspect is mostly what's getting up everyone's noses - seeing the
same answer over and over again and not necessarily seeing the same question
over and over again.  

	?????

	Sincerely
	Natalia

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Finally, because I am a community minded person concerned with the
&gt; ill-will
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that the various debates re: newbie questions etc have been debated on
&gt; this
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; list, ALL newbies should feel free to email their queries to me DIRECT
&gt; at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@senet.com.au">lloy0076@senet.com.au</A>
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;With all respect, this is precisly what Matthew, after a lot
&gt; &gt;&gt;of thought, has asked people on the list specifically *not*
&gt; &gt;&gt;to do.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I would have thought from your statements above that you would
&gt; &gt;&gt;have been the first person to respect such a request.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Matthew is obviusly trying to correct the dysfunctional behaviour
&gt; &gt;&gt;on the list and not to segment the LinuxSA group into multiple
&gt; &gt;&gt;camps.  Your suggestion undermines that goal, without giving
&gt; &gt;&gt;Matthew's attempt a chance.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; GEEZ!
&gt; 
&gt; In deference to Matthew Tippett I withdraw that offer. All questions
&gt; regarding linux should therefore be directed to
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>
&gt; 
&gt; If I  i n a d v e r t e n t l y  receive any requests for help from people
&gt; whom I do not know then I shall forward them unedited to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au.</A>
