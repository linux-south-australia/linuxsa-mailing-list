 &gt; 	I am just waiting for the article on A Current Affair, or in the

 &gt; atrocity 'Were known to have used the Internet on at least 1 occasion', and
 &gt; if we are lucky, we might even be treated to a log file of the URL's that
 &gt; they visited - just you wait and see, I betcha they try this one. 

Too late, it's already happened.  The Littleton kids were, of course,
avid players of Doom and Quake, and were known to be heavy users of
the Internet.

[ which, of course, says nothing of the fact that virtually all geeks
  are avid quake players and heavy users of the Internet:  You never
  hear about how out of nearly 100,000,000 people to have bought Quake
  (according to ID Software), only two people have turned into mass
  murderers -- Christ, we could use the same flaky logic to show that
  Quake players are among the most mentally stable groups in society
  with stats that good! That outcome isn't *really* backed up by the
  figures, but neither is the one that says playing Quake begats violence ]
  
 &gt; This will be used as all the more reason why the Internet is wrong,
 &gt; and needs to be controlled (for the sake of Our Children of course)

Immediately after Littleton, and using Littleton as a justification,
Congress and major backbone carriers in the United States agreed to
the mandatory provision of end-user censorware.  Again, this has 
already happened, is already happening, and will keep happening until
enough of us convince enough of them that it's *wrong*.

I'm not going to tell anyone who to vote for at the next election;
However, I will strongly recommend that you DON'T VOTE LIBERAL.
