Agreed that there is no way to check. As the old adage (is that spelt
right?) goes "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog". How many of those
gorgeous chickie babes (scuse the term) in chat rooms are really 13 year
boys with lot's of computer knowledge and not much to do with it except hang
out there ???

I think the govt has realised this and many other points, "We can't figure
your age, let's just completely ban it from everyone, which is a tenant of
the 'law' being pushed through"

hmmmm,

&gt; &gt; So this totally ignores the fact that some kids learn
&gt; &gt; to duplicate one or the other parents signatures, have access to the
credit
&gt; &gt; card (let's just rip it off from mum/dad) and can get hold of an order
form
&gt; &gt; somehow.
&gt;
&gt;This is another fallacy the Government has not been interested in
&gt;persuing:  Adult verification schemes don't work because ownership
&gt;of a credit card is not evidence of your age.  It is possible to
&gt;obtain a foreign credit card from the net;  it is also possible to
&gt;legally acquire a credit card with a zero-dollar credit limit from
&gt;Australian financial institutions.
&gt;
&gt;When that aspect of "adult verification" techniques is known, it becomes
&gt;clear that their only "useful" effect is to restrict privacy by forcing
&gt;visitors to identify themselves.  If a child actually wants to see
&gt;something on the other side of an adult verification service, there's
&gt;absolutely nothing preventing them from doing so.
&gt;
&gt;This is why the US Supreme Court, the Canadian CRTC, and virtually
&gt;everyone else who has looked at the matter except the Select Committee
&gt;on IT has agreed that there is no way to validate someone's age on
&gt;the Internet.
