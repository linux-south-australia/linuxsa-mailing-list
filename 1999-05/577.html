Just a quick thought. Wouldn't onr filter software's web sites be blocked by
another, because it would have to have examples of what is being blocked or
text describing it, so maybe this whole thing will collapse in on itself
because no-one can actually get the filtering software to begin with ???????

&gt;&gt; Just a thought, wouldn't LinuxSA get blocked, I mean some of the words
that
&gt;&gt; would be in the archives.... Oh no, stop swearing everyone or this list
will
&gt;&gt; be like the dinosaurs &lt;shivers in little red booties, okay will really be
&gt;&gt; doing something like this if this things becomes law!).
&gt;
&gt;Good point.  I'm not going to to be too happy if I'm looking at
&gt;www.linuxsa.org.au and come across a really important article "IP
Mascarading
&gt;explained in one syllable words or less"  and it's blocked because the
person
&gt;writes "I'm glad I got that s**t sorted out".
&gt;
&gt;Remember this bill is divided into two parts.  Take-down messages which
will
&gt;remove innpropriate content, and also a requirement on ISP's to use
filtering
&gt;technology etc... to keep their users safe.
&gt;
&gt;It's like asking Australia Post to read your mail first to check there's
nothing
&gt;naughty written there....

&gt;&gt; &gt;Hi Mark,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;At 14:49 27/05/99 +0930, you wrote:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, there's no such thing as snuff films.  Any politician who
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;claims they're a problem is only showing his own ignorance.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Yeah, I know, they're a bit of an urban myth ;-)
&gt;&gt; &gt;Sorry, I really just meant the stuff politicians refer to, like
&gt;&gt; &gt;downright gory/offensive content (eg: gore archives with stuff taken
&gt;&gt; &gt;from "Dan's Gallery of the Grotesque" before it got taken down...by the
&gt;&gt; &gt;author himself). Point I was making was simply that the SERIOUSLY BAD
&gt;&gt; &gt;content is mostly hidden away in the quieter hollows of the net.
&gt;&gt; &gt;Not sitting on popular HTTP sex-sites (which, I believe, are the
&gt;&gt; &gt;only targets here).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If it became an INTERNATIONAL law/agreement, then there would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; be a whole lot less "oh but that's within THEIR juristriction"
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; crap and they would have to hide in the few nations left that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bauk extraditions and such. They currently use the internationalism
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of the Internet for safety from prosecution. So let's turn it
against
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them by making it the same law wherever they are.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, this has already happened.  There is nowhere in the world
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;where kiddyporn is tolerated.  Police have been cooperating
&gt;&gt; internationally
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;on this for years before the internet even existed, and ISPs worldwide
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;remove it where they find it.  There have been several successful
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;prosecutions in Australia for distributing child pornography on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;net, which just goes to show that existing laws were working.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Quite true. I wasn't actually sure if it was permanent and well
established
&gt;&gt; &gt;(not to mention financed) yet. But I did hear about those operations
&gt;&gt; &gt;last year (busting the "Wonderland Club" or something similar wasn't
it?).
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;However, I was more refering to an actual international organisation,
&gt;&gt; &gt;kinda like the UN (bad example I know ;-) which then co-ordinates
&gt;&gt; &gt;and directs the cooperative efforts of all these police forces.
&gt;&gt; &gt;And not just porn, I'm talking about setting up an organisation with
&gt;&gt; &gt;technically-minded, well-informed specialists who act like
&gt;&gt; &gt;Internet "Marshalls". Not because I love the idea of regulation or
&gt;&gt; &gt;censorship; but purely to pre-empt stupid 'stop-gap' legislation
&gt;&gt; &gt;getting forced into effect by the moral majority (who understand
&gt;&gt; &gt;practically nothing about the technical nuances of the problem
&gt;&gt; &gt;they wish to rememdy). I mean, the official documents of this new
&gt;&gt; &gt;law probably still have liquid-paper over the "must display warning
&gt;&gt; &gt;sticker on outside plastic packaging..." sections from when it was
&gt;&gt; &gt;originally the film/literature clasification laws document ;-P
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;So, I wasn't saying they hadn't done it at all, just not enough,
&gt;&gt; &gt;and not as ONE mighty organisation/body.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It is a fallacy to say the Internet is unregulated, and the fallacy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;is generally only promulgated by those who have a vested interest
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;in increasing the regulation.  Restrictions on banned erotica,
terrorism,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and incitements to violence have always been illegal in all media,
&gt;&gt; including
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the Internet.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;I didn't mean unregulated. I just meant that it can/could be a potential
&gt;&gt; &gt;juristrictional nightmare, IF there ARE any countries that don't want
&gt;&gt; &gt;to play ball with each of the other countries involved.
&gt;&gt; &gt;(There is no one head to the beast, if you know what I mean ;-)
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Anyway, I said it sounded utopian ;-P (albeit slightly inacurate too),
&gt;&gt; &gt;just anything is better than insisting that the net regress to a senario
&gt;&gt; &gt;that suits our paper-based censorship system (ie: list it, ban it).
&gt;&gt; &gt;Many man-hours chewed in just making/maintaining the list too.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;sarcasm&gt; Hey, now there's a job that the 'work-for-dole' mob wouldn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;knock back: trauling the net for porn to block.  heheheheh &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Cheers,
&gt;&gt; &gt;-Daniel
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;PS: I in no way work in the area of international law enforcement,
&gt;&gt; &gt;so bear with me if my 2c worth is in any way niaeve or just wrong ;-)
