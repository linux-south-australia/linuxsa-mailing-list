Subject: anti-censorship rally, Sunday May 30th, Adelaide

Attacks on Australians' freedom        ADELAIDE rally
of speech have been steadily           Sunday May 30th    
growing: on the Internet, with         3pm, State Library Nth Terrace
films and television, and in 
other media.  To protest this,         To protest, You're invited to
events are being organised             a barbeque outside the State  
around Australia.                      Library in North Terrace. 
                                       Bring along anything you think
                                       should be thrown on the Weber.   

     &gt;&gt; Please forward this to friends and colleagues in   &lt;&lt;
     &gt;&gt; the Adelaide area who are likely to be interested. &lt;&lt;

Net censorship legislation currently before Parliament is unparalleled
in the Western world -- and more authoritarian than that of Malaysia or
Singapore.  It treats the Internet like television and totally ignores
civil liberties.  It will drastically restrict adult freedoms, by making
material which is legal in other media illegal online; it will increase
costs for all Internet users; and it will damage our economy -- and yet
it will fail dismally at making the Net "safe for children".

For more details, see <A HREF="http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/stop.html">http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/stop.html</A>

Political interference in the censorship system is apparent in the
attacks
on the films Salo and Lolita, the Rabelais newspaper case, and attempts
to stack classification review boards.  And computer games considered
unsuitable for children are completely illegal in Australia -- there is
no recognition that adult Australians play computer games.
