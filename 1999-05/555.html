Along this thread, I was running enlightenment DR0.15.5 -without- gnome (I
don't like gnome..  lol.. I can't see the fascination!  But anyway..)  using
kernel version 2.0.36 for a while.  It crashed frequently, and the only
programs I've been running on it are netscape and xterm..

I've upgraded since to 2.2.9, and the problems still occur.

Enlightenment 0.15.5 seems very buggy.. or maybe it's just my system's
configuration..  but for me, things like the submenu where you can choose a
background picture?  You know the one I mean?  Well, it don't work.  50% of
the time it just doesn't change the background, and the other 50% it crashes
completely.  I haven't touched any of the config files..  maybe they need
some manual tweaking..

Ah well.  Back to KDE.

&gt; &gt; I'm running RedHat 6, with GNOME and Enlightenment as my desktop/window
&gt; &gt; managers, on my computer (PII, 64MB RAM, Daimond Viper 550. is that all
&gt; &gt; the relevant information needed?) and I occasionally find that X windows
&gt; &gt; just crashes for no reason at all. I have Linux run in init
&gt; level 5, so X
&gt; &gt; starts again, but it's rather annoying.
&gt; &gt; &lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone else had similar problems and fixed it? does anyone
&gt; know how I
&gt; &gt; could try to identify what is causing the problem (apart from trying
&gt; &gt; different desktop/window managers, if possible)?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi Andreja,
&gt; 	I had the same problem repeatedly with the combo you mentioned. I
&gt; kept getting a CATCH SIG 11 which normally implies a memory/overclocking
&gt; error. I thought it this was quite possible (I have a P133 running at 188)
&gt; but since swithcing to kde I have had no problems.
&gt;
&gt; I also used standard enlightenment (instead of gnome) but that suffered
&gt; the same fate. I think that it may be enlightenment causing X to crash.
&gt; Solution - switch window managers :)
&gt;
&gt; Overall I think redhat 5.2 had a higher stability. (Then again it could be
&gt; the 2.3 development kernels - Nah!)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
