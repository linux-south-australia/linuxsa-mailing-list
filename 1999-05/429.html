&gt; hi all
&gt; has anyone used linux on an IBM 300Mhz M2 chip? i'm thinking of buying
&gt; one to try linux on but it's no use if linux definetly won't work. or is
&gt; it safer to go to cyrix or stick with intel? thoughts anyone or where do
&gt; i go to find the latest info?

Yes, they'll work in Linux. Afaik Alan Cox has a Cyrix M2 machine. And the
cyrix issues that used to be in the kernel are resolved. A few things you
should note, though:

: Buy a k6 instead
: Their floating point performance really really sucks. What this means
  is, ANY fairly recent 3D gameswill suck on it. I count Unreal as being
  fairly recent - I've tried it on an cyrix 300. It's not pretty. And this
  was in 300x200.
: The reported cpu speed (ie 300) is NOT the speed at which it is clocked.
  If I remember correctly, the 300 is clocked at about 266. Integer perf
  would be between 266 and 300, while floating point performance will
  probably be around the 200 mark. If you're lucky, that is.
: Buy a k6 instead

I'd rather get a cyrix than an intel though. More bang for your buck,
unless you're doing anything fpu intensive.
