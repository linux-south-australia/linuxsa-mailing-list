It will be very interesting to see what sort of 'content' the powers-that-be
declare to be offensive ....

Consider these points (presented in no particular order)

- During the Vietnam War, things went very wrong for 'The System' mainly
because of open reporting.

- By the time that the Gulf war came around, the media representation of the
war was very much back under the control of 'The System'

- Closely followed by Somalia, we even had cameras and film crews all setup
on the beaches BEFORE the troops turned up.

- Now with Yugoslavia who knows what is going on - we get 'ameteur video'
shots of Serbian tanks driving around quite clearly in the open, and yet the
USAF seems intent on blowing up bridges, refugee columns, and water storage
facilities ... huh ? The only media that we get is straight from the US
Ministry of Truth.

- Yugoslavian radio stations, satellite relays, and internet broadcast
capabilities have been targetted very agressively by NATO (while the Serbian
tanks are free to roam the countryside). - huh ?

- An article in the age
(<A HREF="http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990523/news/news3.html">http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990523/news/news3.html</A>) shows how 'The
System' has admitted that all comms into and out of this country are tapped
and scanned, and analysed by computers. (Purely to protect the Australian
people from anti-social elements, of course)

- We have Mr Gates virtually buying AT&T in the US, to own the
infrastructure for comms over there, and now he is making a big move on
Deutsche Telekom, to own the European comms and cable internet
infrastructure.

- Bill Clinton ..  Big mover & shaker, or pawn of 'The System' ? Whatever
the case, whoever controls the Media certainly had the power to put him in
there in the first place (remember those pathetic im-promptu performances on
the saxaphone ?), and will certainly have the power to decide whether or not
he stays or goes. Look at the procession of 'electees' in the USA - Reagan
(actor), Jesse Ventura (WWF Wrestler / Actor) , etc, etc. If Bill Clinton
does not toe the line, who will be next ? Leonardo DiCaprio ?, Tom Cruise ?
Bill Gates ?  .... dont laugh too loud, just wait and see whats coming.

- Australia, home base for US signals intelligence, rushes a law through the
parliment that effectively gives 'The System' enormous powers of control
over the internet in this country, all under the guise of 'protecting the
people'. What exactly does this Bill achieve - does it protect children from
porn and dissident opinion ? - No, not at all. We know that, and They know
that. What we all know, is that within a very short time of this Bill
becoming law, virtually every ISP in this country will be technically guilty
of an offense under the act. Will there be prosecutions ? - NO, NO, and NO
again. The System will not be interested in charging anyone under the act.
It will appear as if it was a big fizzer, and life will go on as normal, in
fact, every unpunished offence that goes by each day gives Them more
leverage when the time comes to act. 

The Future :

This is how I reckon it will pan out :

- The first people to go down will be ISP's who offer extended services like
building intranets and other applications for customers. These first victims
will be non-Microsoft shops who for one reason or another, are not helping
Mr Gates in his cause. Lets call this company XYZ Pty. Ltd. The issues at
hand will be about market share, and control of technology. XYZ Pty Ltd will
be building and hosting sites using standard protocols, whereas MS will be
asking that they convert everything to COM / ActiveX / Office-2000 / MS-XML.
XYZ P/L's products and services will be competing very nicely in the market.
One day, XYZ P/L will go too far, and produce some plugin or other that
allows netscape to view IIS-6 pages, or allows Samba to mount an NTFS-2
drive. 

- The first thing that the masses will see of this will be a show-trial,
mostly on TV. Suddenly, several years worth of log files will be dragged
out, showing a collection of smut and offensive material that has passed
through XYZ P/L's servers. The simple fact that those same downloads may
have passed through BigPond, ninemsn.com.au, etc, on their way to XYZ P/L's
proxy server will be ignored completely by the prosecution. Every TV news
report will cover the exact same story - showing lurid pictures of half
dressed ladies, throw in a snippet of some 'youth' taking a drink out of a
Vodka bottle at a Marilyn Manson concert, toss in a picture of a web page
bearing a swastika, and point the big ugly finger of guilt all at XYZ Pty.
Ltd.  'Here is an example of the sort of filth that these monsters at XYZ
Pty. Ltd. have been pushing on our children'.

- The masses will be only too happy to see XYZ go down, and have their
customer base moved over to someone safer, like ninemsn.com.au for example.


- Over time, there will be no more ISP's as we know them. They will either
become branch offices of MSN, investing big bucks to bring all their
operations into line with the MS-way, or face the consequences. The ultimate
consequence will be to be hauled up before the media as a 'Drug peddling,
rascist, paedophile'.

- Once this experiment has been successful in this country, expect to see
other countries adopt the same model.

- Will there ever be a prosecution against msn.com.au ? ... what do you
reckon ?      If we all ran background processes to anonymously pull porn
and offensive material through msn 24 hours a day, and reported all of the
downloads to the media, do you think that there will be any mention of it at
all ? - I dont think so.
