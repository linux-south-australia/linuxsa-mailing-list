Hi,  thanks for the replies.  My interpretation of head crashing was
mistaken.  I thought it included all actions that could damage heads.
After dismantling a damaged drive to find that the read/write heads
where mounted in a plate possibly made of teflon (could be anything)
that rode directly on the surface of the disc I assumed that the head
couldn't touch the disc in any circumstances in modern drives.  This
drive used to slam the arm against the stops (sounds nasty too) causing
one of the teflon plates to break resulting in bad sectors.  Since the
drive didn't cost me anything I didn't care.  When a new drive sounds
like it is hitting the stops it gets your attention.  It may be paranoia
but you never know till it fails.  It isn't as loud as the previous
example but damn hard to analyse.  It occurs in ms windows occasionally
now so it may not be a linux thing after all although it was heard the
most there.
Thanks
Conrad.
