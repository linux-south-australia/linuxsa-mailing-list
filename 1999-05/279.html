Paul from CAE Mrad forwarded this interesting request:

Before people barrage Zdenek with their resume's, I have had some
correspondence with Zdenek wrt this.

Saliant points I see are:

1. This appears to be a start-up company. This translates into high risk.

2. They are looking at doing really heavy duty CIFS/SMB stuff. You will
need to  know a fair bit about CIFS/SMB. If you are only now starting to
look at the various specs or looking at the Samba source, you are probably
not in the running. Just being Australian is not enough, and there are some
Americans, French and British people who I can think of who have the
relevant experience. Of course, there are some Australians I can think of
who also have lots of the relevant experience. They are mostly tied up,
however.

3. There is some suggestion that Samba is the wrong source to start with
because of their requirements. This relates to risk management. Zdenek has
a very tight time frame and with the Samba source, you would be too far
into the project before you could tell you were going to fail.

On the up-side, they are looking at doing some innovative things, like
having hardware move data around, rather than using things like bcopy etc
... They are also looking at working with an RTOS, rather than, say, UNIX
or Linux.

I mentioned a multi-threaded (pthreads) RTOS targetted SMB server that I
have been writing, and there seems to be some interest, but who knows ...
 
Just thought I would pass on these comments in the hope of forestalling any
unrealistic expectations.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I'm interested in knowing more.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Our company has several software engineers which might also be
interested.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Paul,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks for responding to my request. At this point I am collecting
&gt;&gt; information and trying to come up with a suitable strategy and deal with
&gt;&gt; the fact that
&gt;&gt; the samba expertise resides in Australia - we are located in Mass. USA.
&gt;&gt; Could you please send me your resume and a few lines about how much
&gt;&gt; time you could dedicate to this project? Ideally, we are looking for
full time
&gt;&gt; engineers here, but we could be very flexible if we have to.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -Zdenek
