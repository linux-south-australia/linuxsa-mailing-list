According to my documentation on page 325 of the Red Hat Installation Guide
for RH 5.2

`It ahs been found that the 2 button Microsoft Mouse of Version 2.1A or
greater is a `smart' [intelli] mouse...This caus X and or gpm to not work
with Linux because the mouse is not responding in a way these programs are
expecting. To `reeset' the mouse to work with them you can use several
methods:

use mouseconfig as
  mouseconfig --kickstart --device cuaX

where cuaX is where the mouse is (cua0 = com1, cua1 = com2)

another solution is to get gpm1.13, run as gpm -t pnp -R and configure
XFree86 for
MouseSystems Protocol with /dev/gpmdata as the device
'

These are direct quotes.

I found RedHat took ages to recognise my mouse properly. After about thirty
restarts and installs the mouse now works perfectly!!!!!!

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I have just put Linux on a new PII and as with all systems
&gt;bought by those who don't have to use them they bought an
&gt;Intel i740 video card and MS Intellimouse.
&gt;
&gt;When I was using VGA16 640x480x16 (ergh) I had no probs,
&gt;but when I upgraded to the XBF-i740-glibc-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm
&gt;from redhat the mouse stopped working.
&gt;
&gt;It still works fine at the console with "gpm -t imps2",
&gt;but under X it just stays in the top left corner clicking...
&gt;
&gt;The XF86Config is
&gt;
&gt;&lt;cut&gt;
&gt;Section "Pointer"
&gt;    Protocol    "imps/2"
&gt;    Device      "/dev/mouse"
&gt;&lt;/cut&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have tried both 3 button emulation and not, with no effect.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone have any ideas?
&gt;Anyone experienced problems with MS Intellimouse or XBF?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Nick
