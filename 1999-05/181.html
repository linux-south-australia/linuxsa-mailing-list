Quick buffering tutorial.

stderr isn't buffered.
stdout is line buffered.
Any other file you fopen() is block buffered.

But the C buffering isn;t the only buffering in the system.

When redirecting stdout to disk, you won't see anything
in the file until at least one full disk block has been
output.  In fact, UNIX makes no guaruntees about file
contents until the file is closed().  Then it guaruntees
that the next open()er of the file will see what you wrote.

The people from BSD modified these guaruntees for the file append
mode.  Otherwise writing syslogd would have been a major pain.


There are two common cases where the buffering is a problem:

1) Interactive prompts:

Imagine you are presenting a prompt without a trailing \n to trigger
the C line buffering.

So, before you ask for interactive input, you need to

  if (isatty(fileno(stdin) && isatty(fileno(stdout)) {
	fflush(stdout);
  }
  fgets(...)


2) Database integrity

Nothing in the guaruntees above said that the blocks output by
the program made it to disk.  The "written" disk blocks could
still be in memory.

This simply isn't acceptable for a transactional database.  These
RDBMS's usually solve this problem by using their own filesystem
on "raw" disk.  Unfortunately, Linux has yet to get raw disk devices.

Naturally, interested people are working on this :-)


&gt; Whilst we're on the subject, consider this:
&gt; 
&gt;         process A  ----- fifo pipe ------&gt; process B
&gt; 
&gt; A is set to write only, B is set to read only
&gt; 
&gt; can you confirm or deny that when process A dies, the select() call
&gt; (waiting on bytes available to read) in B will return?

confirm.

You should ensure you handle incoming signals cleanly,
not just EOF.
