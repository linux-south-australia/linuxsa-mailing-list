&gt;  &gt; However, I don't believe the legislation will be unworkable forever.
&gt;  &gt; Technology is simply like that *grin* (probably why I have any interest in
&gt;  &gt; this industry at all).
&gt; 
&gt; When they come up with artificial intelligence powerful enough to
&gt; distinguish a bomb recipe from a copy of the constitution, a nude on
&gt; an art gallery site from a nude on a porn site, and a Rabelais article
&gt; on shoplifting from criminal instruction, I'm sure they'll dedicate
&gt; its use to something a lot more important than trawling through the
&gt; net looking for smut.
&gt; 
&gt; The Canadian CRTC report puts a financial estimate on th question of
&gt; how to categorize the web for content filtering purposes, and suggests
&gt; they'd need a budget in execess of $100 million per annum to do it,
&gt; and even then they wouldn't do it right.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think we'll have workable blocking software in my lifetime.
&gt; I'll buy a six-pack of Lemon Ruski for the first person who comes to
&gt; me with evidence that I'm wrong.
How about a brain implant linked to PCs, that can detect if the person
feels guilt when loading a website...If guilt is felt, the website is
blocked.
Now THATS 2084 for ya ;)
A 'possible today' method would be a modified lie detector attached to
your PC, maybe?
Lie detectors detect nervousness, so if you're nervous about loading a
page you know to be illegal, then it'll notice it and block the page for
you.
So, an adult who knows its fine to view the smut he's d/ling will be
allowed to see it, but a 15 yr old kid who's hoping his parents don't
notice, will be nervous, and it'll be blocked.

A corporate employee who's wasting time by replying to LinuxSA emails in
his lunch break would also be blocked if he feels nervous 8)
