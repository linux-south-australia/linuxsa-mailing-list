After a few hiccups my install of RH 6.0 came good. The install
initially stalled on the Virtual File System that had been installed for
VMWare. After a couple of attempts it seemed to resolve this problem. I
am booting into Gnome and Enlightenment. 

However I have lost my printing capability. The Auto detect did not
detect my parallel port. It says nothing detected on
/dev/lp0,/dev/lp1,/dev/lp2. The RH Printool will send a test file to the
spooler but no further. Is there some way of locating this port? Can I
create a link between the spooler and port? Previous install RH 5.2.


 Re problem with LP1.

&gt; 
&gt; Beginning with kernel 2.1.33 (and available as a patch for kernel
&gt; 2.0.30), the lp device is merely a client of the new parport device. The
&gt; addition
&gt; of the parport device corrects a number of the problems that plague the
&gt; old lp device driver - it can share the port with other drivers, it
&gt; dynamically assigns available parallel ports to device numbers rather
&gt; than enforcing a fixed correspondence between I/O addresses and port
&gt; numbers, and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt; The advent of the parport device has enabled a whole flock of new
&gt; parallel-port drivers for things like Zip drives, Backpack CD-ROMs and
&gt; disks, and so forth. Some of these are also available in versions for
&gt; 2.0 kernels; look around on the web.
&gt; 
&gt; The main difference that you will notice, so far as printing goes, is
&gt; that parport-based kernels dynamically assign lp devices to parallel
&gt; ports.
&gt; So what was lp1 under Linux 2.0 may well be lp0 under Linux 2.2. Be sure
&gt; to check this if you upgrade from an lp-driver kernel to a
&gt; parport-driver kernel
&gt; 
&gt; I goes on to say that auto detection may not work !

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;         A short while back, I noticed some correspondence concerning a
&gt; &gt; problem where the lp1 port would disappear if parallel port support was
&gt; &gt; included in a kernel; well, I think that's what it was.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The solution was to actually communicate with the printer through lp0
&gt; &gt; instead.  I had a similar problem, but could not solve it.
