&gt; &gt; A 'possible today' method would be a modified lie detector attached to
&gt; &gt; your PC, maybe?
&gt; &gt; Lie detectors detect nervousness, so if you're nervous about loading a
&gt; &gt; page you know to be illegal, then it'll notice it and block the page for
&gt; &gt; you.
&gt; &gt; So, an adult who knows its fine to view the smut he's d/ling will be
&gt; &gt; allowed to see it, but a 15 yr old kid who's hoping his parents don't
&gt; &gt; notice, will be nervous, and it'll be blocked.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; [O'Connor, Steven]  Excellent idea ...
&gt;
&gt; However, I would think that when the 15 yr old is home alone (Ma &
&gt; Pa are off to a PTA meeting at the highschool), and they are free to
browse
&gt; without fear of discovery, then the blocker would detect less nervousness,
&gt; and allow more content than usual.
&gt;
&gt; Mind you, when the same 15 yr old is on the last day of a major
&gt; school project that is due first thing in the morning, and they are
&gt; frantically scouring encarta.com for relevant material, the degree of
&gt; tension and nervousness would more than likely trigger the blocker to
flash
&gt; the screen red, and blast THOUGHTCRIME.WAV out of the 300W speakers !
&gt;
&gt; You could always wire the detector up to the cat, who despite the
&gt; fact that he eats and sleeps too much, is possessed of a wonderful
arrogance
&gt; that makes them immune to all feelings of guilt.
What happens when the person gets excited!!&lt;g&gt;  As far as I know a lie
detector doesn't know the diff between excitement, certain emotions(ie hate,
love) and nervousness.  To bad if you are an adult looking a  smut page and
get turned on, and blocked for it!!&lt;lol&gt;
