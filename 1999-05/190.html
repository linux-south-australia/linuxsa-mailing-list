Since I'm not on the linuxsa list I missed the start of this
(and I don't know if this message from a non-subscriber will
appear there), so I don't want to get too involved in this
discussion.  However, there are a couple of points that seem to
be worth making -- apologies if they have already been made.

&gt;  &gt;    ``Within main, return expr is equivalent to exit(expr).''
&gt;  &gt;      -- K&R2 pp164
&gt; 
&gt; ... which is all very well, considering "return" from within "main" 
&gt; was only "officially" supported at all when ANSI C was formalized 
&gt; (which isn't to say that it wasn't supported by various implementations,
&gt; just that they didn't have a standard behind them).  Before then, you
&gt; either got out of main() via exit() or by dropping off the end of
&gt; the world.

This is wrong.  K&R1 (which is the only sane source for a
definition of C prior to the Standard) clearly states that you
can return from any function.  It also states (in A.9.10):
"Flowing off the end of a function is equivalent to a return
with no defined value."  In other words, dropping off the end of
main() is identical to putting `return;' as the last executable
statement in main().

On a slightly different point, I would stress that main() has
always been defined as returning `int' -- that's how it was in
K&R1 and that's how it was maintained in the Standard.

&gt; If you want to cast main() to void your program will still work, 

For certain definitions of "work", not including any that I find
satisfactory.  The process's parent is entitled to call one of
the POSIX wait functions, all of which are designed to provide
status information -- including the value that was passed to the
exit function in any process that called exit.  But that status
value is meaningless in any case where main() is treated as a
void function.
