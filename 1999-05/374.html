Tys,

I wouldn't agree that the error message is totally lacking in information.
Of course it's hard to know whether you told us all of the error message,
however your subject, "SIOCADDRT: invalid argument", is enough for me
to know that an invalid argument was passed in conjunction with the use
of SIOCADDRT.  Admittedly it's not obvious that SIOCADDRT is a socket
ioctl, but I expect you should be able to try some basic research and
discover this yourself.  The first thing I tried was "grep SIOCADDRT
/usr/man/*/*", and up popped /usr/man/man2/ioctl_list.2.  There you go,
you now know that it's an ioctl.

When you look at the manual page for ioctl you discover that EINVAL
("Invalid argument") means either the request (SIOCADDRT) or the argument
(see man 2 ioctl_list) is not valid.  Presumably SIOCADDRT is a valid
ioctl command, although you really haven't given enough information for
me to be certain of this.  Knowing what program elicits this response,
and whether the program was part of your original distribution, or from
somewhere else, or modified, would be useful.  At this time I would be
willing to accept that SIOCADDRT is not the problem; if it were the
problem I think you would already know the reason why.  Therefore
presumably the problem is with the argument to the ioctl.

You suggest that it might be something to do with the loopback route,
but with respect, you give me little reason to trust your judgement.
Find out exactly what command displays the message.  Find out exactly
what arguments are given to the command.  Consider whether the command
is being used correctly or not (maybe you are trying to add a route
using a gateway which you can't directly reach?)  After all of that,
which I hope you agree is the minimum we can expect you to do before
asking for help, if you still have a problem then I'm sure someone here
will be pleased to help.

I hope most readers here found this to be educational.

David
