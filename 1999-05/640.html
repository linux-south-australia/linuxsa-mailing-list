&gt; Hello,
&gt;         A short while back, I noticed some correspondence concerning a
&gt; problem where the lp1 port would disappear if parallel port support was
&gt; included in a kernel; well, I think that's what it was.
&gt; 
&gt; The solution was to actually communicate with the printer through lp0
&gt; instead.  I had a similar problem, but could not solve it.
&gt; 
&gt; My question is not how do I fix my problem, but how do I go about finding
&gt; the solution such as the one given above?  For instance, what log files
&gt; might I look for, or what files on /proc or whatever?
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the person who answered the problem might like to outline how they
&gt; find the answer.

Not sure if I answered it but...

This occured as the person updated the kernel from 2.0.x to 2.2.x
There was a change in the kernel code where parallel ports were
numbered from 0 rather than 1.

This is somewhere in the kernel documentation 
(ie /usr/src/linux/Documentation  - possible Changes).
The kernel documentation can solve LOTS of Q of this list.

I knew this change as I'm a member of linux-kernel mailing list :)

Cheers,
