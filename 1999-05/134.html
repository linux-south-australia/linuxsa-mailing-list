<H1>Apology for the apology...</H1>

Okay, so I apolgise for my previous apology.  

I implied that the LinuxSA was an intolerant lot, when the 
very opposite is true not only of LinuxSA but the entire 
Linux community in general: the whole thing is built on 
sharing, and there are lots of people that work very hard 
to help in all kinds of situations.  The quality of 
help found in the LinuxSA forum is extremely high and is 
worth working to preserve.  

The reason for my previous rant and rave was to try to 
be helpful: an improvement in communication might lift 
the readership of your message, possibly from 97% to 98%.  
In other forums where there's more noise and less signal, 
the difference might be more significant, possibly changing 
from 10% to 20%.  

Either way, the extra readership is a win: It just might be 
the difference between scoring an answer or not.  It's 
in your interests to maximise your chances.  

I don't claim to be a guru at communication -- in fact, 
those of you that know me well would know that I have 
sometimes been too stroppy for my own good -- but my 
motives here have all been good ones.  

Anyway, now having two feet in my mouth, and rapidly 
running out of feet, I'll go and have a cup of tea 
and a good lie down the next time I feel motivated to 
post anything resembling an opinion.
