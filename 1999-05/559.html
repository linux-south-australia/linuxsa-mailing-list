&gt; Somewhat cynical, but very believable. I don't think the medeia is THAT
&gt; biased, but it can come close. Will MS be that dominatory ? Concievable,

IMO as long as we have the ABC we'll be ok. The problem is, the media is
owned by the very rich, who of course are very pro-liberal, leading to
some bias in the media to do with political issues. A blatant example is
the "this man cost you X amount each week" headline in the Sunday mail
(owned by Murdoc (who's pro lib) when senator harradine rejected the
GST.

&gt; but one thing I've pondered for a while. MS is seen as Big Evil Brother.
&gt; Even more evil is its CEO Mr Gates. I think MS's direction and drive comes
&gt; mostly from Gates himself.

I don't think Gates is evil, just ruthless, and a bad loser.

&gt; We can live in hope.

Or be cynical bastards, which is much more fun ;)
