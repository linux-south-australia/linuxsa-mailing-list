&gt; Subject: anti-censorship rally, Sunday May 30th, Adelaide
&gt;
&gt; Attacks on Australians' freedom        ADELAIDE rally
&gt; of speech have been steadily           Sunday May 30th
&gt; growing: on the Internet, with         3pm, State Library Nth Terrace
&gt; films and television, and in
&gt; other media.  To protest this,         To protest, You're invited to
&gt; events are being organised             a barbeque outside the State
&gt; around Australia.                      Library in North Terrace.
&gt;                                        Bring along anything you think
&gt;                                        should be thrown on the Weber.
&gt;
&gt;      &gt;&gt; Please forward this to friends and colleagues in   &lt;&lt;
&gt;      &gt;&gt; the Adelaide area who are likely to be interested. &lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; Net censorship legislation currently before Parliament is unparalleled
&gt; in the Western world -- and more authoritarian than that of Malaysia or
&gt; Singapore.  It treats the Internet like television and totally ignores
&gt; civil liberties.  It will drastically restrict adult freedoms, by making
&gt; material which is legal in other media illegal online; it will increase
&gt; costs for all Internet users; and it will damage our economy -- and yet
&gt; it will fail dismally at making the Net "safe for children".
&gt;
&gt; For more details, see <A HREF="http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/stop.html">http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/stop.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; Political interference in the censorship system is apparent in the
&gt; attacks
&gt; on the films Salo and Lolita, the Rabelais newspaper case, and attempts
&gt; to stack classification review boards.  And computer games considered
&gt; unsuitable for children are completely illegal in Australia -- there is
&gt; no recognition that adult Australians play computer games.
&gt;

&gt;   Adelaide - 3pm Sunday May 30th, Outside State Library North Terrace
&gt;   Protest against censorship
