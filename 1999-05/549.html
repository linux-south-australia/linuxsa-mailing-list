&gt; &gt;Well, the bill has passed now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Presumably this means the internet as we know it will end quite shortly.
&gt;
&gt; Oh ye of little faith... haven't you read CSIRO's report...?!?

Yes, when it was available.  Obviously the government didn't read it however
;-)

&gt; &gt;Make sure you attend the rally outside the State Library at 3pm this
&gt; &gt;Sunday!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Wear all your corporate stuff, make the government aware how many people
&gt; &gt;they're annoying.
&gt;
&gt; I don't think the gov't cares...
&gt; it may feel just fine about it.

At this stage they feel fine...  Obviously when the legislation comes into
effect and suddenly they can't look at www.cnn.com etc... they'll feel bad
about it.  It looks like screaming 'get out of the way of the train' just
doesn't work for them.

&gt; Rather than jump up and down
&gt; every time gov't reduces a freedom,
&gt; why not demand a nice big Axiomatic Solution...?
&gt;
&gt; I.e. a Bill of Rights with a very clear
&gt; limitation of gov't powers.
&gt;
&gt; Could save time in the long run.

Maybe.  But in the meantime make sure you attend the rally on Sunday at 3pm
outside the State Library =)
