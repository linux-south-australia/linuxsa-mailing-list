Hi,

I have not had any success running FIPS on laptops with disks larger than 2GB.

In each case, although FIPS was able to repartition, the resultant Windows
system would not boot and complained about problems with Win386 and other
files.

This has happened on two laptops, an Acer Extensa 368T (which appears to be
a less than desirable machine, another name would be HoC) with a 3.2GB disk
drive, as well as a Compaq 1700 with a 4GB disk drive.

Does anyone know what one has to do with such machines to make sure that
FIPS can do its work while preserving their ability to boot that other OS?

Alternatively, how to make the recovery CD with at least the Compaqs
partition up your disk into say, a small amount for Windows, and lots for
Linux :-), would be a good piece of info as well.


Regards
