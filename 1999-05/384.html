hi
I know I didn't put to much info into the post. I thought that the symptoms
I said where a symptom of being hacked. I had spent most part of a day or so
trying to figure out what went wrong the network setup here. I was asked by
the network admin here to look at the machine. I scanned the logs and tried
to see what was running but the machine kept falling over.
I disconnected the machine from the perm. link and stopped access on a few
services and that seems to have fixed the problem for now. we are running
4.2 because I was not allowed to upgrade the machine with out a backup. I am
still trying to compile ftape but I have had  to upgrade some rpm's and
other stuff.

anyway its all a learning experience and the attack came from NZ somewhere.

&gt; Subject: Q&A - out of memory
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I feel it necessary to say a few things here to avoid a newbie/pro
&gt; flame war.
&gt;
&gt; What Toby is saying (albeit a little bit bluntly) is that
&gt; Computers are NOT Cars & LinuxSA is NOT Ultra Tune.
&gt; LinuxSA IS here to help solve problems but saying "it's making
&gt; a bang bang clunk noise", is not going to help.
&gt;
&gt; If you ask a question you must provide information to help
&gt; people solve it.
&gt;
&gt; If it is a low memory issue then include info from utils
&gt; such as 'free' and 'top'. OS and Distribution details.
&gt; When the problem started, any affecting factors etc...
&gt;
&gt; Also, when ever you have a problem the two key things to do
&gt; before coming to a support group like LinuxSA is RTFM and
&gt; upgrade to the latest stable release (if possible).
&gt;
&gt; If you don't know where the "M" in RTFM is, then ask. No one
&gt; would have a problem in pointing you in the right direction.
&gt;
&gt; In your particular case John, it would be useful to have info
&gt; from 'free' and 'top'. Also...
&gt; What is the machine doing?
&gt; What services are running on the machine?
&gt; How much RAM & SWAP?
&gt; Why are you still using V4.2?
&gt; etc...
&gt;
&gt; If you can provide this info it would help us help you.
&gt;
&gt; Nick Stock
&gt; RJ-45 of all trades.

&gt;
&gt; Heyas
&gt; Didn't you send exactly the same message at the beginning of the week?
&gt; According to my email, you did anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I notice you didn't receive any replies to your original post.
&gt; However, if you were reading other posts that have been going on, you
&gt; will understand why.
&gt; Your question does not actually ask a straight question, nor does it
&gt; give any information that could be used to help answer some of the
&gt; questions you are obliquely asking.
&gt; (Eg: My machine runs out of ram - why?
&gt;      amd doesnt work - why?
&gt; )
&gt;
&gt; However, the only information you volunteer is that "we are using redhat
&gt; 4.2 with a serial ISP link."
&gt; I have NFI what use a "serial ISP link" is going to be for us to
&gt; diagnose a problem regarding memory and filesystems.
&gt; You don't even tell use how much total ram your machine has, let alone a
&gt; process listing dump showing us what you are running, how much ram each
&gt; is using, etc. and how much is left over free, etc. etc.
&gt;
&gt; However, I suspect if you did even look at this information yourself,
&gt; you would be able to figure out your problem on your own!
&gt; Please, LinuxSA is not your personal consultant! We don't get paid for
&gt; this, so if you want help, try to make it obvious what you want, and try
&gt; to do some work yourself!
&gt;
&gt; If you took the time out to check how much free memory you have, and
&gt; free swap space, and then looked at how much ram each program was using,
&gt; I think you'd probably find the answers to your questions are that
&gt; you've got a pitiful amount of main ram and next-to-no-swap-space. (If
&gt; your machine is running redhat 4.2 I'm assuming it's pretty ancient.)
&gt;
&gt; If you don't know how to tell how much ram your machine has, or how much
&gt; is free, then RTFM!
&gt;
&gt; If you don't know how to RTFM, then go out and borrow someones APC
&gt; handbook - they're a great place to start for newbies.
&gt;
&gt; Seeyas :)

&gt; &gt; Hello
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; my linux server keeps getting out of memory errors after it runs for a
&gt; &gt; while. it comes up with out of memory error inetd and sendmaild.
&gt; &gt; I have been looking at a problem with amd which stops it from restarting
&gt; &gt; occasionally.
&gt; &gt; "rpc.mountd/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S60nfs: usr/sbin/rpc.mountd    no
&gt; such file or
&gt; &gt; directory" it has had this error for a while but it seems to hang when
&gt; &gt; booting when it starts amd.
&gt; &gt; i have tried a few things and read a few man pages but after a
&gt; bit of time
&gt; &gt; it runs out of memory.
&gt; &gt; we are using redhat 4.2  with a serial isp link
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thankyou
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you
