Hi all,

I raised the FP Extensions thread a while back and, although there was 
a nearly unanimous condemnation of the idea (myself included), I am
now rather unfortunately forced (by clients) to do the unspeakable ;-)
(It came to a choice of that OR sticking an NT box on our network...uugghhh)

So I have dedicated a specific server to the task (separate to any of our
standard webservers), and installed the latest 3.0 (FP-98) version of the 
extensions. This version has worked a little harder on the Apache patches and 
lets you do all the patching directly to one or two source/header files and 
compile it with an extra 'mod_frontpage.c' module. This method (referred to
as 
'apache-fp') is the preferred installation for unix servers as it no longer
uses "stubs" copies of the extensions on EVERY host that has a 'FP web'.
There are stripped-down binaries which call the centrally located extensions.

Sound's good on paper doesn't it? ;-P

Getting it to work is a different story. The installation has not had any
errors and I know that the 'built-in' functionality of the extensions is
working because &lt;webbot blahbalah...&gt; tags for FP forms are now working.
However, when you try and submit these forms to the "shtml.exe" parser,
it bitches about syntax or has a 500 error. 

The problem with the syntax for these calls is that MS (in their infinite
wisdom)
have used the "/" character to delimit between the call to "shtml.exe" and
the "whatever.htm" that is being passed.

eg:
&lt;webbot.... form action="[path]/shtml.exe/whatever_srch.htm" ...&gt;

What a surprise that if I use any other form of character to delimit
this sequence I get a "Front Page Error: [something about invalid params]"
message YET if I submit it as is I get a 500 (internal server) error
which, when checked in the error_log is caused by:
