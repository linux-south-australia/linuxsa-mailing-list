&gt; 1. Having fully attempted to resolve the problem before asking for help
&gt; on the list.

Crap...had it occured to any of you that I did try??? (Why else would I
*risk* a post...)

    - man -k SIOCADDRT found nothing.
    - when I ran ALL of the programs mentioned in Redhat's rather
(over?) complicated network init-scripts, I couldn't reproduce the error
message.

The reason I didn't give more info is because that was all the info
I had....
At boot time, right after net-card probe, it says SIOCADDRT: invalid
argument.

I even offered what I thought, as a stab in the twilight, might be the
problem to prove that I had tried, but that was shot down in flames with
"...with repect, you give me little reason to trust your judgement...".
Thanks :{

The man page David Newall pointed me to was a kernel programming page, for
goodness sake. (Do I have to be a programmer to "really" use Linux? One guy
suggested: "So edit the &lt;kernel&gt; source code and MAKE it give you more
information...." Sorry, but that's gotta be dumbest advice I've ever heard:
edit the program and tell it to tell you something you don't know about...)

ioctl_list.2 is a list of hex values for signals, etc. NT doesn't need
users to understand kernel code just to fix (cryptic) error messages; does,
and if so, should in your opinion, Linux?

I think I might cool off trying to persuade my NT-admin friends to try
Linux, if this is the case. (I think I might be echoing an old religious
war about elitism amongstUnix users here...)

&gt;&gt;Admittedly it's not obvious that SIOCADDRT is a socket
     good admission
&gt;&gt;ioctl, but I expect you should be able to try some basic research...
&gt;&gt;When you look at the manual page for ioctl you discover that EINVAL
    Discover? You mean decipher, which I couldn't. So shoot me.
&gt;&gt;("Invalid argument") means either the request (SIOCADDRT) or the
&gt;&gt;argument (see man 2 ioctl_list) is not valid.

Call that basic research?


Please forgive me if I sound a little pissed off, but if you can't stand
newbies, then...well I don't know. Perhaps that's something you need to
sort out for yourself.

Or go all the way, and tell them to go and join another group...
(linuxsa-kernel-programmers) / (linux-elsewhere-mortals)

What if I was a real newbie, or an NT specialist who was just starting to
try out Linux but needed some help, or I didn't even know that manpages
existed, which many newbies (or stupid people) don't?

I'm also curious about what "Signal 11" means, but I can't find and
explanation in the manpages...do I dare ask the masters? I might try
somewhere else first.

I think it's a bit sad that some people can set a rather high standard of
knowledge on SA's (I presume) only Linux list, which I was previously proud
of, but then refuse to split the list when people that know less than them
bug them with "dumb" questions.

&lt;/SOOK&gt;

Ok, I'm finished now. :)
