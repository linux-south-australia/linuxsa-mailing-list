&gt;Hello all
&gt;
&gt;I am trying to install linux on a compucon bookshelf computer
&gt;the motherboard is an ASUS TX97-N
&gt;
&gt;I can boot the machine from a DOS floppy  DOS and all aappears well
&gt;but the linux redhat 5.2 installation disk will enter into the boot: 
&gt;prompt and load the initrd and vmlinuz and enter the welcome
&gt;screen anything after that results in the machine rebooting
&gt;
&gt;I have reflashed the BIOS to the latest version and also have
&gt;removed all shadow bios settings etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Has anybody got any ideas or encounters similar to this

Hi Jeff,

I've had similar problems with my old 386.  Most boot disks contain a
minimal kernel which does not function well with my hardware.  I had
to give up on RedHat 5.0.  I disovered that Debian has a selection of
boot and root disks. Version 1.3 provided an alternative boot disk
which worked whereas the recommended one produced similar symptoms to
what you describe.  On the other hand, Debian 2.0 which I am using now
required _not only_ the use of the second choice boot disk but some
additional boot time parameters - according to my notes I had to use
"boot: linux floppy=thinkpad".  The docs that led me to this solution
referred to a slow floppy problem which I know to be the case with my
hardware due to experience with Windoz.  BTW, once the system is
installed with a proper kernel, all will be well.

So where does this leave you?  I guess that I'm pointing you to any
supplementary documentation for additional boot time parameters and/or
an alternative boot disk such as the rescue disk.  Also, IMHO,
flashing the bios wont make very much difference because Linux mostly
bypasses the bios, it has all the device drivers that it needs in the
kernel.  On the other hand, I've read that removing any shadow settings 
is good practice because Linux likes to do all its own memory management.

Good Luck,
