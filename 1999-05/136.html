Maybe this problem was there all along, but windows wasn't accessing the
part of the disk that causes the problem? You've probably installed
Linux in an area previously unused much.(ie. near end of disk?)

&gt; Hi,  thanks for the replies.  My interpretation of head crashing was
&gt; mistaken.  I thought it included all actions that could damage heads.
&gt; After dismantling a damaged drive to find that the read/write heads
&gt; where mounted in a plate possibly made of teflon (could be anything)
&gt; that rode directly on the surface of the disc I assumed that the head
&gt; couldn't touch the disc in any circumstances in modern drives.  This
&gt; drive used to slam the arm against the stops (sounds nasty too) causing
&gt; one of the teflon plates to break resulting in bad sectors.  Since the
&gt; drive didn't cost me anything I didn't care.  When a new drive sounds
&gt; like it is hitting the stops it gets your attention.  It may be paranoia
&gt; but you never know till it fails.  It isn't as loud as the previous
&gt; example but damn hard to analyse.  It occurs in ms windows occasionally
&gt; now so it may not be a linux thing after all although it was heard the
&gt; most there.
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Conrad.
