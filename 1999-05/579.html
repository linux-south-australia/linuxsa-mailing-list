Just out of curiosity, if ISP's are meant to be blocking all this
"offensive content" by what criteria are they going to block it?  

By words? 

If I'm not mistaken, many people use "offensive" words in the meta tags
of homepages to generate hits from search engines.

By links?

There's quite a number of "offensive" sites on the net, and I don't see
any simple (or effective) way to keep track of them all.

By domain name?

It's possible, but with the numbers of sites changing daily as
"offensive" sites move from provider to provider, there still isn't any
way to filter it.

By known IP addresses?

again, I don't see how it can be done.

The other way would be to monitor everything that your customers do
online and make "informed" judgements on that basis, but isn' that
invasion of privacy?

Getting down to the nitty-gritty of the whole situation, I find the word
"polititian" to be extremely offensive and would like to request of the
ABA that all sites containing this most-offensive of words be blocked
from all sources.

&lt;/soapbox&gt;

Looks like I'll be seeing a lot of people on Sunday at the rally.

Cheers

Tim
