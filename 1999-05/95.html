Now for a word from our sponsors (me and Geoffrey).

Geofrey and I have discussed this before.

We decided to leave the list as is.

This is because there is value in all people being exposed to the
same information, no matter how trivial it may seem.  As Linux picks
up popularity and we don't have shelves of Linux books at Dymocks the
community has to pick up the slack.  We are the community, and we should
embrace the new people, until they are up to speed and feeding information
back into the community.

There will be some who are wholesale consumers of information.  They may not
give back to the community in the long run.  But these people are in the
minority, and so we just have to let things ride.  

A few points to help people ask answers and get other people to answer them.

When asking a question.

	1) Use a subject that is descriptive - "X not working" will turn
		most people off.  "nVidia TNT not working under X" will 
		get a lot better response.
	2) State what you have tried, what resources you have used and
		where you feel the problem may be.
	3) Give enough technical details to be useful.  Precise error
		messages, bits of details that you have used trying
		to find out things.  Snippets of configuration files
		are sometimes useful if they are relavent.
	4) Do NOT attach all configuration files.  If people start
		helping you then you can fine tune what is sent.
	5) Do not be afraid of asking questions.  You may feel intimidated, 
		but on the whole, those who are willing to help far out
		number those who get frustrated with newbie questions.

When giving a reply

	1) Address the problem,
	2) If an external resource is useful cite it precisely.  A HOWTO
		name or web site can give the asker a whole lot more
		information than can be gleaned from an email message
	3) Cite references, refer to sections of HOWTOs, parts of
		manpages.  A simple cut and paste can explain a large
		amount very quickly.
	4) Don't attack the person asking the question.  Most times they
		just don't know the answer or don't know where to look.
		Sometimes what appears lazy may hide a large number of hours
		scratching one's head.
	5) Give references for more information.  Even if they had a problem
		they are playing with something that may need good reference
		later on.

Although these are not hard and fast rules, one line questions or one line
answers don't really add much to helping people understanding things.  Use
your discretion and ask questions intelligently.

Regards,

Matt
