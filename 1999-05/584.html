&gt;  &gt; Just a quick thought. Wouldn't onr filter software's web sites be blocked by
&gt;  &gt; another, because it would have to have examples of what is being blocked or
&gt;  &gt; text describing it, so maybe this whole thing will collapse in on itself
&gt;  &gt; because no-one can actually get the filtering software to begin with ???????
&gt; 
&gt; Filtering software doesn't tell you what it's blocking.  The blacklists
&gt; that come with filtering programs are almost always encrypted.

Huh?
I suppose this could be this way to prevent competitors from stealing
the lists, but it also seems like a rather stupid thing from a
consumers/users point of view...I mean, say you find out that your
search engine is blocking out, say, a site about preventing AIDS, and
you want to unblock it, you couldn't really do it, if you can't access
the blacklist. 
(Can you?)

Are there any Open Source proxy filters out there? I know I'd rather
have one of those, than some piece of !@#$ written by Microsoft, that
probably is not only unreliable and slow, but also secretly monitors and
correllates users with data/websites they access, and then feeds it all
back to microsoft. Very bigbrother-ish. Plus, of course, would you feel
safe knowing that your credit card details, or your Ecommerce details,
were going thru a probably vastly insecure M$ proxy?

I know I wouldn't.

NT Server apparently has a fairly high security rating by the USA
(laughable, hey?). What's more laughable is that it only applies when
the computer is not connected to a network. Not that M$ go to any
lengths to point that out of course.

See you on Sunday,
Toby

(Any plans for a LinuxSA pre-meet?)
