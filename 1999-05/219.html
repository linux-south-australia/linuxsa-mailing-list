Be careful about inferring anything about the C standard 
by looking at the output of GCC.  This practice, if maintained, 
will quickly lead you into heavily shark-infested waters.  
Your claim that you haven't been bitten after a very short 
foray says very little about the risk of being bitten!  

David has been vehement in arguing that "it works for me" 
isn't as good as "it conforms to the C standard".  While 
not wishing to contribute to the flame war, I have to 
agree with David: you may stray away from conformance 
to the C language specification at your peril.  It 
may be that you have good reasons for doing so -- but 
unless you're absolutely certain about what you're 
up to, it's far better to stick inside the boundaries 
set by the Standard.  

While it's interesting to see how the C code you 
write maps into code generated by the compiler, this is 
not the way to check for standards conformance.  What 
seems simple today will surely be complicated tomorrow -- 
high-performance architectures like DSP chips and 
microcontrollers like the PIC have a way of turning 
every iota of the implementation around in order to 
extract performance.  

If your code is entirely within the Standard, and the 
compiler conforms to the Standard, then you won't suffer 
too badly as most things will work as you expect -- apart 
from the architectural details that you have to address (e.g. 
DSP chips often have a 32-bit char type!)  Non-standard 
code, however, tends to be broken in very exotic ways, and 
can be an absolute horror to debug.  The reason we're so 
emphatic about this is because the needless pain and 
suffering that results from nonstandard code is very high, 
and we would not wish that experience on anyone.  

The practical upshot is this: always double-check against 
the Standard when grey areas in coding practice crop up.  
Weigh up any benefits of being nonstandard with the 
extremely large benefits of being conformant.  If you 
still wish to step outside, double-check your opinion 
with knowledgable persons before embarking.  The C FAQ 
I mentioned before is a good quick guide to the 
Standard.  

On a more philosophical level, keep the abstract interface 
as separate as you can from the implementation, at all 
levels throughout your system.  The better the separation, 
the more consistent things will be, and the less territory 
you will have to cover when debugging.  The C language / 
compiler implementation interface is just one of many places 
where this separation is important.  Others include your 
command line or GUI interface, and the boundaries between 
modules inside your system.  We're back to the same issue 
of clear communication that I was raving about in earlier 
messages, merely in a slightly different domain.
