 &gt; part of the problem the gov and parents have, seems to be that material
 &gt; you wouldn't want your children to see comes from places you don't know
 &gt; where.
 &gt; so why not make a top level domain called .sex right up there with .com
 &gt; and .org etc.

That idea has been canvassed at quite some length:  It won't work:

   * The only way to make it work is to force sex sites to use it,
     otherwise you'll still have sex in places parents don't know about;

   * You can't force sex sites to use it because US laws compelling speech
     are just as unconstitutional as laws forbidding speech;

   * If it did work, once all the sex sites were corralled into one
     place you'd have every government in the world tumbling themselves
     to ban the domain.

The solution to the problem of parents not knowing about the net is to 
educate parents about the net - that's the beginning and the end of
the matter.  The fact that the government isn't doing this is a strong
indictment of thier incompetence over this whole affair.
