&gt; 
&gt; This sounds like a very interesting idea, and I do think some of the
&gt; people
&gt; on this list would make excellent vocal advocates.
&gt; 
&gt; A thought, why not create a political party ourselves, something like
&gt; 
&gt; The SA Internet Users Party - Protecting Your Right To Freely Use The
&gt; Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of the mandate of such party, it could hold public information
&gt; seminars giving information to empower the average person regardless of
&gt; internet knowledge. The seminars could be used instead of maybe club
&gt; meetings.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas, criticism or downright telling me to shutup will be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Rob.

&gt; Subject: I'net Bill - What to do? What to do? - Confucius
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I wonder if anybody else has thought
&gt; &gt;about educating the general public
&gt; &gt;about the Internet (not for the purpose
&gt; &gt;of selling them an ISP access package,
&gt; &gt;but in the way that 4WD clubs help
&gt; &gt;their members get the best out of their
&gt; &gt;4-wheel-drive vehicles...):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Something of a social context in which
&gt; &gt;people would intentionally endeavour
&gt; &gt;to create an Internet culture and pass
&gt; &gt;it to the "next generation" of Internet
&gt; &gt;newbies...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Guiding them to useful material... if
&gt; &gt;only so that the wildly negative PR
&gt; &gt;that seems - now and again - to fill
&gt; &gt;media about the 'net doesn't (in the
&gt; &gt;absence of such social/cultural con-
&gt; &gt;texts) become a self-fulfilling prophesy
&gt; &gt;that makes it easier for people to
&gt; &gt;accept silly laws like the one we've
&gt; &gt;been discussing lately...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I, for one, think that doing the above
&gt; &gt;would be giving people a new choice:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;While they'd still be able to do it alone,
&gt; &gt;or with cyber-associates, now they
&gt; &gt;would be able to meet and socialise
&gt; &gt;with people whose values might be
&gt; &gt;vastly different from the minority who
&gt; &gt;seem to get the air-time (e.g. pedo-
&gt; &gt;philes, purpetrators of 'net frauds,
&gt; &gt;online gambling, etc.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Of course, there would be various
&gt; &gt;clubs and not all of them would share
&gt; &gt;the same values (some might find
&gt; &gt;online gambling OK, while I would
&gt; &gt;not in mine...).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But getting the more conservative
&gt; &gt;and/or lesser experienced computer
&gt; &gt;users (including some that have had
&gt; &gt;no contact with the computer and/or
&gt; &gt;Internet) into contact with the 'net via
&gt; &gt;one of these clubs (either on a period-
&gt; &gt;ic basis or even during a one-night or
&gt; &gt;afternoon intro "show & tell" presen-
&gt; &gt;tation) would ease their minds about
&gt; &gt;what the Internet's all about...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Less fear... less jumping on Harradine's
&gt; &gt;censorship bandwagon.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And - who knows? - it might even help
&gt; &gt;the economy, e.g. if some new Internet
&gt; &gt;User (who's been shown how to find
&gt; &gt;info on a new service, technique or
&gt; &gt;product happens to work it up into a
&gt; &gt;business success for him-/her-self,
&gt; &gt;right here in SA...).  It would surely
&gt; &gt;help convince the pollies, no?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Of course, it would!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So, as I've asked (rhetorically?) before:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Do you want to quash this bill...?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Or do you want to sit around sputtering
&gt; &gt;about how awful it is...? how unrespons-
&gt; &gt;ive the gov't is...? etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The choice is yours...  ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Let's hope you make the right choice!
