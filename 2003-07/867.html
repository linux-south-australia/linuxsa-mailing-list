how hard is it to have multiple HDDs hooked up in a box? I know that between 
HDDs and CDs and whichever else, you have primary and secondary master and 
slaves... so does that limit you to four? or can you hook up more?

another thought that comes is RAID, but my understanding of that (which isn't 
that great) is that it uses a bunch of HDDs together, which isn't quite what 
I want...
say, a CD/DVD writer, CD -ROM, a HDD for swap, a HDD or two for squid cache 
(from what I remember in squid docs, it'd like several drives for a major 
site, which I wouldn't be doing, but a squid dedicated drive would boost 
performance still), a HDD for data (movies and music, maybe), a HDD or two 
for linux... is it doable on x86 hardware? without jumping through too many 
hoops?
would I need certain mobo/bios/other hardware? (I haven't bought anything yet, 
and probably wont for a while yet, so if I need to get something special, 
it's not ruled out, it can go on the considerations list)

TIA, Adam
