If you go back far enough, evolution doesn't provide any answers.  It
provides a questionable theory for in between "The beginning" and
present day and thats it.

The thing I find most ironic about the theory of evolution is that
ultimately evolution relies on creation anyway.  Even the "big bang"
theory relies on the existence of material and energy, in order for it
to take place.  Where, might I ask, did all this "stuff" come from.  To
date I haven't heard a single theory on the matter because ultimately it
involves a question that can only be answered with something being
created.

Just to clear things up, I believe in evolution, but let's define
evolution here.  Micro evolution or macro evolution??  I believe in
micro evolution, that is the ability for a species to adapt to it's
surroundings/environment at a micro level. This has been observed in
nature today.  

What I don't accept, and this is the quantum leap evolutionists want you
to take, is macro evolution. I DON'T believe my great, great, great,
great, great, great, great, (you get the idea) grandfather was an
amoeba!!  I'm sorry, I don't care how many millions of years you put in
between!  The sad thing is, that evolutionists try to extrapolate micro
evolution to macro evolution.  If you have a decent dig into the
arguments for evolution, you will find there is not a single shred of
evidence to support macro evolution.

I'm sorry, I know this is off topic, however I don't think those that
post "this thread should end now" should post their views beforehand and
then request that the thread should end, without providing for a right
of reply :)

Cheers,
Graham
