&gt; I don't believe having a consistent and easy to understand 
&gt; configuration 
&gt; layout is "training wheels" or going to create "inferior" System 

It wouldn't be if it was implemented everywhere all at once. However, in the
meantime, we still have thousands of machines with traditional config
layouts, and people who move from the new and improved system to the old
system will be lost. It's not an insult to a newly designed system, it's
just a fact of life (eg if you learn in an automatic car, you are not going
to be able to drive a manual, and so whether or not automatics are "better"
doesn't matter -- if you want to drive my car, you are going to need to know
how to drive a manual). Likewise, if you are going to want to administer any
other *nix box, you are going to need to know how to drive the old /etc
system (and I, in my arrogance, would sat that that is essential for calling
yourself a systems administrator :) )...

&gt; Administrators. I think what it could do is make an 
&gt; unecessarily complex and 
&gt; illogical system easier to learn and remember. It's about 
&gt; making a system 
&gt; more accessible, not "dumbing it down" or making it any less powerful.

"dumbing it down" wasn't great choice of words on my part. It's quite
possible to not dumb it down. I guess every GUI tool I've ever seen does
dumb things down, and eventually, you need to get into the config files.
