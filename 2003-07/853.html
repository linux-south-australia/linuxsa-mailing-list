Richard,

&gt; I wasn't going to say anything here, but I can't help it...

;-P

&gt; And practically speaking, how are you going to prove that a large open
&gt; source project conforms to all the standards, and doesn't act
&gt; differently to other programs?

True, so they pay someone else.

(which of course leads onto the question, why bother? Just use
Microsoft/SCO etc)

&gt; &gt;  (1) Fix it; or
&gt; &gt;  (2) Know precisely what it is doing
&gt; 
&gt; You can, yes. But for the most part, the users of software don't
&gt; particularly want to do either of those things.

Maybe the Government has more people than simple office workers and high
level managers who don't know or don't want to know about the source.
Maybe the Government employs some technically competent people...

&gt; So what are you arguing about then? This thread doesn't make sense.

It makes a reasonable amount of sense. I think that Barney is saying don't
create a bill based on positive discrimination. I'm disagreeing...

&gt; &gt; This is to say, if the Government wants to purchase 1000 
&gt; &gt; Apple Mac's and use Aqua [which is not open source], it would need to:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  1) Gazette what it's about to do
&gt; &gt;  2) Wait for a public review
&gt; &gt;  3) Wait for a review from an independent board [2 + 3 could 
&gt; &gt; be combined]
&gt; &gt;  4) Expose all financial details as is practicable to the public
&gt; &gt;  5) Then work out what to do
&gt; 
&gt; Is this a plan to increase innefficiency and sluggishness in the
&gt; government? It would certainly be effective in doing that.

LOL

Maybe, maybe so but it coulbe become a better check and balance than we
have at the moment...
