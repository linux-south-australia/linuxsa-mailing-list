Barney,

&gt; It's called an acceptance test. If you have a requirement, test that it 
&gt; is met before accepting the software.

One could; but if you get landed with an open source product that passes
an acceptance test but for some subtle reason then fails to live up to
standards, you have a chance to fix it.

If it's closed source, then there's not much one can do apart from work
with the closed source creators. Who may want to fix it for you for a
price or not at all.


&gt; You are missing the point here, yes OS is better in some ways -
&gt; and these should be taken into account when assessing a bid, _but_ OS
&gt; should not be a critical requirement, it should be weighted according to
&gt; the needs you have and how it helps you meet those needs.

Perhaps.

Maybe what I'm arguing is that open source is better in general and closed
source is a total pain. I am sounding like the leader of the FSF ;(

&gt; Mandating OSS _is_ descriminatory - so why use the argument that 
&gt; descrimination needs to be abolished as an argument _for_ it?

For the same reason why there are positive discriminatory laws for women,
aboriginals, non-whites...and various other minority groups...

&gt; why only for proprietary purchases? It should always be able to justify 
&gt; any purchasing decision.

LOL - now you're making me laugh [but I do agree with you] ;-P
