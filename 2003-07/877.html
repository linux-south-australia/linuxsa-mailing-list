&gt; Dear All,
&gt;     It SUCKS! BADLY! But surprises me not one bit. People told me that
&gt; living in Adelaide was like living in a country town in the 1970s, but
&gt; Brisbane is like the same country town in the 1950s. No footpaths, no 
&gt; street
&gt; lights, no idea.

Just where the hell in Brisbane are you ? No footpaths ? eh?

&gt; When driving you take your life in your hands, and
&gt; Roundabouts.........Don't get me started. The most progressive thing 
&gt; they
&gt; have up here are traffic lights, and there are alot of people up here 
&gt; who
&gt; are about as bright as the orange one. One of these days they will be
&gt; dragged kicking and screaming into the 1960s - that'll show 'em.
&gt;     If I didn't have to work here, I wouldn't be here - believe me.
&gt;

Hmmm interesting...

When I moved from Brisbane to Adelaide, I felt I was going back a few 
years... Adelaide was like Brisbane but flatter and slower.

Having moved back to Brisbane recently (last month), I've seen Brisbane 
has moved ahead in leaps and bounds over the last three years, while 
Adelaide definitely hadn't.

Adelaide drivers are by far some of the worst in the country (red 
lights ? indicators ? merging ?), and this I've heard from native 
Adelaide residents (as well as just about every "tourist" you meet).

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my stay in Adelaide.

Oh well, different views...

Dave
