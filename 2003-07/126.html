After searching the archives I could only find very old
references to
Freesco (it has changed a lot) and none with reference to using
Freesco
with Telstra Cable.

I have got to the point of having Freesco logging in to BPA just
fine,
but these damn 'heartbeats' are causing me a real headache. The
only
Telstra-compatible login client I could find that was small
enough to
fit on a 1-floppy distro was bids2login. It works fine with
FloppyFW
(from personal experience) and SmoothWall (documented by others).
I
haven't tried BPALogin because bids2login is smaller (1-floppy,
remember) and is known to work with other distros.

When mated with Freesco, the bids2login client will perform the
login
fine, but response to heartbeats doesn't seem to happen. I've
enjoyed
unstinting support from the Freesco forum members and developers,
but as
99.9% of them are Yanks, none of them have any way to actually
test
Freesco with the login client. The work-around I implemented
(more of a
sidestep really) was to cron the execution of the login client
for 30
minute intervals. Without responding to heartbeats you have about
40
minutes of grace before you are denied further access.

Anyway, the workaround works fine ... but, damn-it, it's just not
RIGHT!
I have an overwhelming urge to get it working properly, so I'd
like to
plead some help in getting it to work with Telstra cable the way
it
should. Even if it meant a minor change in Freesco itself I'm
pretty
confident the developer would be happy to consider it. More
likely it
will be something much simpler.

If anyone who is on Telstra cable is willing to test it out, I'll
be
happy to send you a 1.44Mb floppy image (if you want a self
extracting
image just say so). The advantage of using my image is that it is
all
set up with the login client ready to go. You'll just have to
customize
it for your UID/password/internal IPs.

Thanks in advance,

PS Please Please Please do not turn this thread into a "Have you
tried
XYZ distro". I probably have. Freesco is the one I am interested
in. I'm
here seeking expert help, not to start or participate in Distro
Wars.
