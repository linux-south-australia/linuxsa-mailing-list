I need to clarify this remark.  In the context of talking about patches
which include fragements of unchanged code, David N asked:

 &gt;  &gt; But why would
 &gt;  &gt; you think it's okay for you to release the lines you didn't change under
 &gt;  &gt; any new licence?  That's just theft, isn't it?

And I dismissed that comment, exasperated:

 &gt; We're speaking ENGLISH here, aren't we David?

That didn't really add my to this conversation, did it?  So I'll have
another go.

It's a well-founded principle of copyright law that a small excerpt can be 
taken from a copyrighted work, used in a new work, and that new work can
be copyrighted separately from the original.

We call this principle "Fair Use" -- We've had case-law and legislation 
which respects it and depends on it for hundreds of years.

In the context of discussions about the rights of libraries to show excerpts
of DVDs for research and social commentary, the MPAA calls it "theft".  

Most of us in the free software world look at the MPAA and think they're 
coming from a different planet or something.  They try to pass laws which
remove Fair Use on the grounds that it is theft;  The DMCA passes in the
US, and the world erupts (or, on eDonkey and Kazaa, the world fails to
care and continues as if the MPAA and DMCA never existed.  But that's
another debate... :-).

Anyway...

If you believe the GPL/FSF envisages that producing a cdiff which happens
to have a few lines of GPL code in it co-mingled with my own creative output
ISN'T "Fair Use", then we'll need to move this discussion along a bit to
explore the commonalities between the attitudes of the MPAA (boo-hiss!) 
and the attitudes of the FSF (yay!).

There's really no point in doing that, though - Despite your rebuttal
earlier today, section 2(b) of the GPL is clear that any "derived work"
can only be distributed under the GPL.  Whether it's a work that includes
other GPL code under fair use or whether it says, "Insert the following
at line 1038," without displaying any unchanged lines of code doesn't 
matter.  "... in whole or part CONTAINS OR IS DERIVED FROM the Program
OR ANY PART THEREOF..."

I know you think it's possible to produce a bugfix which isn't a derived
work, but I'm working on the assumption here that the only reason you
believe that is because you don't understand what "derived work" means 
for copyright purposes.

[ Hint:  AutoDesk tried to say that third party dongles were derived works,
  even though they contained no AutoDesk intellectual property.  The judge
  agreed, but said third-party dongles were ok regardless because of the
  principle of Fair Use.  That was pre-DMCA, the outcome today would be
  very different ]
