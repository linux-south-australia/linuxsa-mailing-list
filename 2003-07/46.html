&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; Well Hi there!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The separation of Administrator-modified configuration files and the
&gt; &gt; default files installed by the system makes sense to me. But having it in
&gt; &gt; two totally different locations doesn't, e.g. "/etc and /usr/local/etc".
&gt; &gt; Forgetting about Unix history for a moment and stepping outside of the
&gt; &gt; box, if you were to design the filestructure from scratch, where would
&gt; &gt; you place these two directories?
&gt;
&gt; Because it's the history of Unix that has held it together as a scalable
&gt; operating system for so long.
&gt;
&gt; And it makes logical sense to me.
&gt;
&gt; /etc for your basic system config files that come with your operating
&gt; system,
&gt;
&gt; /usr/local/etc for all the additional stuff you've added to the system that
&gt; doesn't come as part of the underlying model.  'man hier' and look up
&gt; /usr/local.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that it can be sometimes confusing, for example:
&gt;
&gt; /etc/named/named.conf
&gt; /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf
&gt;
&gt; (Yes -- both services are fundamental to most networks, and while
&gt; named.conf is a file and a service included with a generic install,
&gt; dhcpd.conf is not, because it's installed, in freebsd's case, from the
&gt; ports.

And you don't see that as confusing? How on earth is that supposed to make 
sense? Yes I understand the desire to separate things out for large 
installations and for NFS mounting partitions from different servers, etc. 
But really, isn't there a better way? If I was looking for dhcpd.conf, I'd be 
looking in /etc, not /usr/local/etc. And why does named get it's own 
directory, but dhcpd doesn't? It's inconsistent!

&gt;
&gt; &gt; So here are my revised goals:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Design a logical directory structure within the /etc directory.
&gt; &gt;    - it must be fairly simple for somebody to look through that directory
&gt; &gt; to find something without resorting to "locate" or "find".
&gt;
&gt; How?

Because it would be structured in a good way. Let's say you wanted to find the 
configuration file for "samba".

Let's say the path was :

/etc/system/services/samba

and the rest of the directory layout was like in my earlier email. I would be 
thinking, "well, samba is part of the system, certainly not a user 
application", so I cd to system, then I think "well, it's a service", then I 
type "ls" and see "samba" there... ooh I found it!

That's probably a bad example because typing ls /etc | grep samba will show 
you the samba directory. But it's consistency that I'm after, *all* configs 
for *all* services will be in /etc/system/services, and the admin will easily 
get used to and remember that location.

Keep in mind that my example directory tree layout from my earlier email was 
off the top of my head, I haven't sat down and properly designed it yet (I 
was hoping to get input from systems administrators).

&gt;
&gt; Any sort of mixing together of basic configuration files and configs for
&gt; additional modules would take away the principles of the logical structure
&gt; that Unix has today.  The same principle exists right now for /bin and
&gt; /usr/local/bin.  Should we change that aswell?  /bin is for programs that
&gt; need to be run in multi or single user mode, and /usr/local/bin is used for
&gt; binaries for added on programs (because that's generally what your /usr
&gt; partition is for.)

One step at a time my friend :) Let's not go changing everything just yet, I 
would rather work within the current frame work (afterall, it has worked for 
a rather long time, but now Unix-like systems are finding new users and 
should adapt accordingly).

&gt;
&gt; It is only poor coding by some developers that make things inconsistent, or
&gt; a user's customized personal preference (for example, some users like to
&gt; store their applications in completely seperatated directories, including
&gt; all data, config files and libraries.)

By setting a "standard" and developing an API to help developers adhere to 
that standard, it will make things a whole lot more consistent. Rather than 
everybody making their own config file format and dumping wherever the hell 
they please in /etc or /usr/etc or /usr/local/etc, they will say "hey, here's 
a library that does it for us, let's get on with actually coding our program 
and not worrying about writing a parser for the conf file".

&gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. Design a unified configuration file format.
&gt; &gt;   - This format must be simple enough to be easily understood by somebody
&gt; &gt; without them having to refer to a manual
&gt;
&gt; Some of what you say here is valid, because there are config files that set
&gt; options differently, eg:
&gt;
&gt; -- from /etc/inetd.conf:
&gt; ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/ftpd       ftpd -l
&gt;
&gt; -- from /etc/rc.conf:
&gt; defaultrouter="10.0.0.254"
&gt; hostname="host.domain.com"
&gt;
&gt; -- from /usr/local/etc/wine.conf
&gt; ;; Floppy Disk Drive
&gt; [Drive A]
&gt; "Path" = "/mnt/fd0"
&gt; "Type" = "floppy"
&gt; "Label" = "Floppy"
&gt; "Filesystem" = "win95"
&gt; "Serial" = "87654321"
&gt; "Device" = "/dev/fd0"
&gt;
&gt; -- from /etc/named/named.conf
&gt;
&gt; options {
&gt;         directory "/etc/namedb";
&gt;         pid-file "/var/run/named/pid";
&gt; 	}
&gt;
&gt; &gt;   - All configuration files will have a common extension so they can
&gt; &gt; easily be seen as such (e.g: .conf).
&gt;
&gt; There are a few exceptions to this, but you'll probably find that most
&gt; programs already use a .conf extension, and of those that aren't -- sloppy
&gt; programming, most likely.


Having a standard and an API to take care of that standard makes it easier to 
not be sloppy.


&gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. Design a simple (probably xml-based) layout file that allows an
&gt; &gt; application to display (graphically) the configuration options for a
&gt; &gt; program.
&gt;
&gt; Most programs don't utilise a GUI interface because:
&gt;
&gt; a) They don't run in a GUI environment
&gt; b) They have way too many options to display in a GUI
&gt; c) Their configuration files have extended attributes or macros which are
&gt; too difficult to display in a GUI
&gt; d) They are too short to display in a GUI
&gt; e) There's no point displaying them in a GUI because they are so straight
&gt; forward.

Why does "webmin" exist? why does the Mandrake tools for configuring the 
system exist? They exist because people want them. A GUI can't cover 
everything, but it can cover a lot (the most "popular" options anyway). More 
advanced options can still be config-file only, and if you have read my 
earlier emails you will see I discussed a way to do this (public and private 
variables).

&gt;
&gt; Are you proposing some sort of registry clone?

The Windows registry is a large binary bloated pig. No I don't want to clone 
that :) The Windows Registry is, however, a central place where all settings 
are stored for all programs. My system differs because:

-it is text based
-based on directory structure and individual files (no single point failure 
due to corruption, etc)
-doesn't require a gui to configure
-customizeable

I am trying to retain the best things from the current system whilst 
addressing its flaws.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;   - The file format should be fairly easy to understand, but referring to
&gt; &gt; a manual in order to write one will be necessary (and possibly to read
&gt; &gt; one and understand it fully).
&gt;
&gt; I suggest we use a text-based format for easy reading, easy parsing, and
&gt; easy portability from one platform or system to another.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;   - It should allow some interpretation by the GUI program so that all
&gt; &gt; configuration dialogs look consistent. The layout file shouldn't specify
&gt; &gt; things like "rectangle,200,200", but should just group configuration
&gt; &gt; variables and specify the type of value they take (like in a programming
&gt; &gt; language), amongst other things (such as a "display name", visibility,
&gt; &gt; etc etc).
&gt;
&gt; I like consistency as much as the next guy!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe something like this could be done if it is managed in stages:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Discourage hard-coding paths to configuration files so that
&gt; &gt; configuration files can be placed wherever the user pleases.
&gt;
&gt; Above, you wanted a logical and consistent system that allowed us to not
&gt; have to use tools like find and locate.  Now you say you want us to be able
&gt; to put our configuration files anywhere we choose?

This is because finding and opening the configuration files is handled by the 
library. If you really don't want the samba config to be in 
/etc/system/services/samba, but in /etc/samba, you can just move it. When 
restarting samba, the library will fail to find the samba config file in the 
old location, so it will search for it, open the file at the new location and 
update the path-cache. Samba has no knowledge of the file being moved.

When I say i want a logical and consistent system, I am talking about a 
written standard, not something enforced at gunpoint. The library will manage 
and stick to the standard if you want to, or you can do your own thing, it 
will still cope :) (I've thought about implementation details of this also, 
it is do-able, IMO).

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Application accesses these files through a library "say libetc, or
&gt; &gt; libconfig".
&gt;
&gt; So that when we're on a slow link we have to use annoying tools that slow
&gt; us down.

Nope. A program that has a configuration file, e.g. "samba", uses the library 
API to open and access the configuration file. If you want to modify the 
config file with vi over ssh, go ahead.

For a long-haired old hand Unix hippie (and I mean that in the nicest way, 
being long-haired myself :), not much will change, except that all the config 
files will look the same (same layout), the /etc directory tree will be 
different (more organised), and config files can be moved if the sys admin so 
desires (though that would make the system non-standard). Editing config 
files and restarting services will not change.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) Create layout file format and sample application that can parse the
&gt; &gt; etc tree and provide a GUI for config files that have an accompanying
&gt; &gt; layout file.
&gt;
&gt; I think Microsoft have tried this a few times, and they got their Registry
&gt; Editor which is a most friendly application to get your head around, not to
&gt; mention navigate.

Not even close to what I want. In MS world, think of it more like one of those 
.cpl thingies that sit themselves in the control centre. The difference being 
that this layout file is not compiled, toolkit independent, and editable with 
a text editor :) It's a description of a fully fledged GUI with tabs, 
checkboxes, edit boxes, etc...

&gt;
&gt; You may argue that once you get used to it, it's easy!  Sure, I know how to
&gt; find some things in there, but I still find Unix's structure a lot more
&gt; simplistic than a bloated and overly complicated GUI navigation tool.
&gt;

I've almost NEVER used the registry editor in Windows (I'm not exactly a 
Windows PRO, I've been using Linux as my main OS for almost 2 years now 
(first used it as a home file/print/internet server in 2000). Sure that's not 
a whole heap of experience with Unix (I've used Solaris at Uni though), but 
I'm at a point where I understand what's going on (mostly), but I'm not so 
entrenched in the ways of Unix that I can't let go and think of something 
better.

&gt; Let's not forget they tried sysconf.exe aswell, which ended up just loading
&gt; several configuration files into editable windows (which seems logical to
&gt; me!)

Never heard of it. Despite what you may think, I'm not all that familiar with 
stuffing around with Windows. I used it to play games, load stuff like 
Matlab, Word, etc. I didn't tweak it at all (why bother).

&gt;
&gt; Gnome2 have added a new registry-style configuration editor and I steer
&gt; clear of that wherever possible.

I'm not after a registry, or registry editor. Just a logical structure for the 
/etc file tree. Making the task of configuring the system via a GUI becomes 
an added bonus (and adding a layout file format adds more power and 
consistency).

&gt;
&gt; &gt; 4) ???
&gt;
&gt; ???
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 5) Profit!! :)
&gt;
&gt; !

South Park: Underpants Gnomes Business Model.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Somewhere in those stages the layout of the /etc directory and the format
&gt; &gt; of the configuration/layout files should be attempted to be made a
&gt; &gt; standard (LSB) so as to encourage people to follow it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For all those that say "the current system is fine once you know it", I
&gt; &gt; say how does that make the current system the best possible? How can we
&gt; &gt; make progress if we stay stationary? (and if you say "if it aint broke
&gt; &gt; don't fix it", I'm going to scream :) It *IS* broke :)
&gt;
&gt; Because it is scalable, and it makes logical sense.  Of all of the things
&gt; you've described, it seems that it's only the application developers who
&gt; are breaking the rules of where files should belong, and how they are laid
&gt; out. Maybe you should explain to them the importance of a logical file
&gt; system?

How about we make it easier for them to abide by standards than to ignore 
them? What's easier: Coming up with your own config file format, file 
location and writing a parser for it, or, using a library that does it for 
you ?

&gt;
&gt; I agree to some of what you have said, but certainly not all of it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt;
