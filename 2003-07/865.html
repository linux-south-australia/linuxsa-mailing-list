me to!


No I'm not going to say just that.

&lt;rant&gt;
My position on this is -

We need accountability from the software companies that supply Gov. and
Industry software.

Why?

To see firsthand the mess that some viruses and gaping great holes in
software have caused the Gov. in years past is disgusting. The waste of
time and money spent on updating virus checkers, applying service
patches, licensing compliance etc. A department of people looking after
just software because someone else had the hardware contract, they
couldn't even install a stick of ram.

Open Standards ie keep the bastards honest. If I say XYZ software will
do the job you require and not corrupt next years data files then that's
what it is supposed to do every time. That when I import your data it
will be correct, that all of it will be there, that my company is
available to you to correct any probs. and software with incorrect data
is not being picky.

The length of time it takes some companies to diagnose and correct
problems is crazy. With people employed to correct any software problems
in Open Source software, things will get done.

If there is a Standards problem in months / years to come with Open
Source it can be fixed.

Software that works most of the time is not good enough.

Set standards for software compliance ie security, accuracy and
useability.

Start with demanding these and other standards from software companies
now.

Then to better achieve these standards Open Source.
&lt;/rant&gt;

There that's better now haven't had a good rant for a while.

What are we going to do?

Some of us meet at Davids on Friday nights, why not come for some
discussion and ideas about what we can do.

&gt; &gt;And practically speaking, how are you going to prove that a large open
&gt; &gt;source project conforms to all the standards, and doesn't act differently to
&gt; &gt;other programs? It's pretty much the same in practice. All this bullshit
&gt; &gt;about you can fix it yourself is unrealistic when it comes to large-scale
&gt; &gt;software. No consumer of software in their right mind is going to take on
&gt; &gt;software planning to maintain it themselves! The ability to get into the
&gt; &gt;source code simply isn't a draw card for most people -- myself included --
&gt; &gt;because most people don't have the time or interest to be working on their
&gt; &gt;tools. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Who says you need to fix it yourself to benefit from being able to see 
&gt; how it works?
&gt; 
&gt; If I make yet another analogy &lt;fx: groan from the audience&gt; a closed 
&gt; source car would have a locked bonnet, and when it leaks oil on your 
&gt; driveway, you take it back to the manufacturer and they charge you for 
&gt; parts + labour to fix it. They charge twice as much as the mechanic down 
&gt; the street, because only they have the right keys to open the bonnet.
&gt; 
&gt; With the open source car, you can lift the bonnet and see exactly which 
&gt; gasket is leaking, or that the supplier forgot to put the oil cap on 
&gt; altogether. Not being a car person you take it back to where you got it 
&gt; from, where they fix it for free and promise it will never happen again.
&gt; 
&gt; With a closed source software model, bugs and faults can be attributed 
&gt; to user error, solar winds or bad feng shui without the supplier being 
&gt; held accountable. If the source is available, it can be reviewed by 
&gt; someone who can keep the supplier honest. If it's available as open 
&gt; source, then the reviewer doesn't have to sign any NDA's, and the 
&gt; supplier can't claim a conflict of interest or stall the review process.
&gt; 
&gt; With the issues of tainting raised by the SCO case, I wonder if any 
&gt; (competent && sane) programmer would even agree to sign an NDA to look 
&gt; at closed source related to their area of experience. This in turn may 
&gt; limit the value of non-free 'source available' policies, since less 
&gt; competent programmers may be used for review.
