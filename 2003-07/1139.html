&gt; About a month ago I went out and bought an 80 gig HD for my desktop computer 
&gt; and partitioned it with SuSE Linux during the installation.
&gt; 
&gt; I ended up with this configuration:
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hda1 Windows 2000 (10GB) FAT32
&gt; /dev/hda2 FreeBSD 5 (10GB) FreeBSD native
&gt; /dev/hda3  [1]Plan9 (10GB) Plan9 file system
&gt; /dev/hda4 (Extended, includes all of the below)
&gt; /dev/hda5 SuSE LInux 8.2 (10GB) - Reiser
&gt; /dev/hda6 Red Hat Linux 9 (10GB) - Reiser
&gt; /dev/hda7 Mandrake 9.1 (10GB) - Reiser
&gt; /dev/hda8 Lindows 4, beta 3 (10GB) - Reiser
&gt; /dev/hda9 Linux swap (314MB) - Swap
&gt; /dev/hda10 - used for storage (6.3GB) - FAT32

eek, firstly I suggest getting a few more computers.

&gt; I have a list of things I want to do in FreeBSD:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Run startx automatically before I log in
Why, just run xdm
change:
ttyv8&gt;."/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"&gt;.xterm&gt;..off secure
to
ttyv8&gt;."/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"&gt;.xterm&gt;..on secure

in /etc/ttys

&gt; 2. Upgrade to kde3

cd /usr/ports/x11/kde3;make install clean

&gt; 3. Add Reiser support
&gt; 4. Get the lpd to start automatically
you say later that you want cups, so bsd printing or cups ?

&gt; 5. "Port" over my Netwhere IPX client
&gt; 6. Run a Samba client
add a suitable line in /etc/fstab

&gt; 7. Install Winex
&gt; 8. Install Cross Over Office
&gt; 9. Figure out what's wrong with my screen colors - they are slightly off
more info required, try LSCOLORS=GxFxbxcxBxdfdEabafabab; export LSCOLORS in
.bashrc
if you are using tcsh, then you know how to alter this
&gt; 10. Set up a network printer
cups should make this easy, can't remember how i got one working here
but it was a no brainer

&gt; 11. Set up cups & autostart
&gt; 12. Learn how to easily upgrade without having to download a CD

install cvsup, copy and edit a supfile and run cvsup -g stable-supfile

&gt; 13. Replace vi with emacs for an editor - I am a horrible typist.
EDITOR=emacs in .whatever_shell_you_are_using_dotfile

&gt; # 1 - I'll google search, but the answers are not clear and perhaps 
&gt; conflicting
&gt; # 2 - I went to <A HREF="http://freebsd.kde.org/instructions.php">http://freebsd.kde.org/instructions.php</A>#upgrade3 but 
&gt; portupgrade did not work. It says that it can't find a directory called 
&gt; /usr/ports/portupgrade. I know its not there, because I looked.  What am I 
&gt; missing here?
&gt; So I went to <A HREF="http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/">http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/</A> and tried to type in the command  
&gt; "PACKAGESITE: 
&gt; <A HREF="http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/">http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/</A> 
&gt; <A HREF="ftp://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/">ftp://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/</A> "and it 
&gt; said "PACKAGESITE command not found.

no required, just use the ports. update them first using cvsup

&gt; # 3 - Seems like Reiser is a GPL file system and therefore not supported ?
&gt; # 4 - I am probably going to edit rc.local
&gt; # 5 - Looks like there is a mature level of IPX support in FreeBSD. Of course 
&gt; the commands are different than in Linux, but it looks like shell commands 
&gt; could be used to set this up. It seems that kernel support needs to be in 
&gt; there, but I don't know how to determine this easily. Next I would need ncpfs 
&gt; for FreeBSD, [perhaps ncplogin(?)] but I can't find that package in the 
&gt; Freebsd ftp site from sysinstall. I haven't tried pkg_add ncpfs yet. I have 
&gt; Mars-nwe installed.  There were some emails I found on the internet that said 
&gt; that ipx and ncp options had to be added to the kernel. I could probably use 
&gt; Grog's book to figure out how to build a custom kernel. Hard to sort out what 
&gt; is needed and what isn't. The man page for mount_nwfs that I found on the 
&gt; Internet doesn't say what packages have to be installed for it to actually 
&gt; work. That's my main gripe about man pages in general. It refers to an 
&gt; ncplogin command.
&gt; # 6 - I am going to try to set up NFS or search for a samba client for BSD

the handbook makes this easy

&gt; # 7 - I am going to try to compile winex from source
&gt; # 8 - I think I have an ice's chance in hades of doing this
&gt; # 9 - I will probably just copy over my xfree86config-4 file from SuSE on a 
&gt; floppy, and modify it so it smells like a bsd file.
&gt; #10 - Maybe Grog's new book will have an answer
&gt; #11 - I think I have an ice's chance in hades of doing this
&gt; #12 - I think I have an ice's chance in hades of doing this
&gt; #13 - I found a reference to setenv EDITOR ee. I modified this and typed 
&gt; setenv EDITOR emacs at the shell but Mutt still comes up with vi.

change the editor in your .muttrc file
set editor=emacs (or whatever), i use set editor="vim +2 -c 'set tw=72'
%s"

Some time reading the handbook would do wonders.
