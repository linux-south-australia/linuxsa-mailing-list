&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; And practically speaking, how are you going to prove that a 
&gt; large open 
&gt; &gt; source project conforms to all the standards, and doesn't act 
&gt; &gt; differently to other programs?
&gt; 
&gt; True, so they pay someone else.
&gt; 
&gt; (which of course leads onto the question, why bother? Just 
&gt; use Microsoft/SCO etc)

... or just "why bother?" ... do you need to prove that it conforms to all
the standards?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  (1) Fix it; or
&gt; &gt; &gt;  (2) Know precisely what it is doing
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can, yes. But for the most part, the users of software don't 
&gt; &gt; particularly want to do either of those things.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the Government has more people than simple office 
&gt; workers and high level managers who don't know or don't want 
&gt; to know about the source. Maybe the Government employs some 
&gt; technically competent people...

I'm sure they do. But don't they have better things to do than fix tools?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So what are you arguing about then? This thread doesn't make sense.
&gt; 
&gt; It makes a reasonable amount of sense. I think that Barney is 
&gt; saying don't create a bill based on positive discrimination. 
&gt; I'm disagreeing...

OK. I fail to see why anyone needs to prove that something conforms to open
standards though, and certainly find the whole maritime union thing entirely
irrelevant. If you are disagreeing with his claim that we don't need
positive discrimination, why not just say that, and argue that case, rather
than wander all over the dock?
