&gt; But the 'premature' part worries me.  My main reason for writing the
&gt; article was to get CPA's interested in using Linux. I wanted CPA's to
&gt; realize that they can get Linux to do most everything they do in
&gt; Windows, and if our profession just made a small push, it could be a
&gt; viable choice for us.  And that's all I really want.

Maybe you want to start by writing a letter to the editorial instead of an 
article.  A few paragraphs that say how you use Linux and all that guff quite 
successfully.  Send a link to your website, and make sure it's got good 
instructions on there, screen shots, tonnes of links, etc.  Just make sure 
it's not too technical because while you may be computer savvy, the majority 
of the population is clueless.  They can use their applications, but don't 
really know (or want to know) what's going on underneath.

If you break every task down into smaller tasks then everything is possible.  
Getting your article published is no different.  Start small.  The business 
world is scared of Linux because there are no real commercial applications 
for it. If you start by demonstrating on a webpage that other accountants can 
see then they may start to show more interest.

&lt;overkill&gt;
If you're really game, create CPA's Linux.  A distro that comes preconfigured 
with all the free software you need to get right into the swing of things.  
Have it set up to allow Wine to run the installers of the Windows programs 
needed, and then be able to run the Windows programs as well.

The key to getting the masses to do things is simplicity.
&lt;/overkill&gt;
