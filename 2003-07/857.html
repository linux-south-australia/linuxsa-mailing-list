&gt; And practically speaking, how are you going to prove that a large open
&gt; source project conforms to all the standards, and doesn't act differently to
&gt; other programs? It's pretty much the same in practice. All this bullshit
&gt; about you can fix it yourself is unrealistic when it comes to large-scale
&gt; software. No consumer of software in their right mind is going to take on
&gt; software planning to maintain it themselves! The ability to get into the
&gt; source code simply isn't a draw card for most people -- myself included --
&gt; because most people don't have the time or interest to be working on their
&gt; tools. They just want to use their tools. If you are buying a hammer, and
&gt; you need one with a claw on the back for pulling out nails, you're going to
&gt; choose one with a claw on the back for pulling out nails, not one with a
&gt; lump of metal that you can configure into a nail-claw or a ball hammer or a
&gt; mallet.

Well, for small companies and organizations, what you say is pretty 
relevant. They are not going to have the skills to determine these things 
for them selves, nor are they, usually, going to be interested in fixing 
the code or debugging it or anything like that.

However, government and large commercial organizations are a different 
kettle of fish. They are going to have the skilled staff who can determine 
these things themselves, and they are going to be able to fix bugs 
themselves, and so on.
