&gt; No, the friction is that the _closed source_ world doesn't
&gt; want to open
&gt; it's source. I would expect there to be just as little, if not less
&gt; commercial software companies that would release using BSD
&gt; license as
&gt; ones that would release using the GPL. RH is a commercial software
&gt; company - and they haven't got a problem with the GPL.

IBM have GPL products and they have closed source products.
They run GPL products on closed source OS's.

They have found a happy medium. One with lots of admin overhead tho...

As do Intel, HP, 3Com ...

&gt; How much better than MacOS 9 is MacOS X? (I haven't used it but
&gt; anecdotal evidence suggests that it is significantly so) I
&gt; think you would be hard pressed to say that Apple haven't
&gt; benefitted from basing their product on a BSD OS.
&gt; Has the associated BSD gained as much from the relationship
&gt; as Apple has?

has NetBSD ever gained from Apples research into Darwin
and MacOS X server ... we would have heard about it if
they did ... yes Apple started with NextStep and pulled
in BSD licenced tech, but i suppose that once code or IP
was tainted with Next IP theres not reverse polination...
=(

&gt; Regardless I am not trying to take sides - I am simple
&gt; supplying arguments.

you would not be participating if you didn't think that
there was something amiss in the balance here.
