&gt; Subject: Tech Talk Intimidates
&gt; From: Doug Yriart (Sysop)
&gt;
&gt; "So far, efforts to make Linux more friendly to desktop users
&gt; have tended to cripple the parts of Linux that do things
&gt; Windows can't.
&gt;
I think Doug overlooks Linux' modularity and resulting customizability. 
Just because KDE can run on Linux, it does not mean he has to do it too.


&gt; Hacking Linux to make it desktop friendly consumes resources
&gt; better invested in making Linux a better server.
&gt;
Overlooks the expanding pie chart effect.  There are more people working 
on Linux now than ever. Certainly not less people working on servers as 
a ressult of desktop use.

But he might have Red Hat in mind. It seems to me, but I haven't looked 
lately, that Red Hat might have started to force the user to use a GUI. 
GUI's should be non intrusive as a matter of principle, but also very 
easy to get to for those that need it.

If I could add one feature to the FreeBSD installer, and not by editing 
config files directly, would be an option to boot right into KDE and 
have the windows managed by the same Window manager that is used by most 
Linux distributions.  I don't think that would do anything to hurt the 
rock solid performance of FreeBSD's wonderful server system, but it 
would provide a bridge for more users to use a really outstanding 
operating system.


&gt; Linux is inherently a multi-user operating system. Windows
&gt; is a single user operating system, even the server editions.
&gt; To make Windows support multiple concurrent users requires
&gt; an application such as CITRIX or Windows Terminal Server.
&gt; The tendency seems to be to want to strip out the multi-user
&gt; features of Linux to make it more "friendly". 
&gt;
I don't have the technical knowledge to comment on the above.

&gt;There is no
&gt; point to Linux without the multi-user features...
&gt;
....but, the folks at Lindows would argue with this last sentence.

Cheers,

James Leone

P.S. Just woke up, and am in LA, so I am going to Tommy's!  If you are 
ever in Los Angeles, this is a _must do_. "Double Cheese, chili fries!" 
Only a chili burger this good can be eaten for breakfast and dinner.
