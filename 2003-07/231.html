If the planned OSBN-SA (Open Source Business Network -- SA) actually gets
off the ground (we're waiting on an external party to give us some support
for insurance etc), then it may be an appropriate body to fill this role,
being more business focussed, and probably incorporated.

&gt; Subject: Broadly -OS and Govt
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting interview with EDS on the ABC drive program last 
&gt; night with Kevin Norton.
&gt;  
&gt; According to a report released recently the State has done 
&gt; very well from its 9 year contract with EDS. 
&gt; 
&gt; There was some discussion about the length of contracts with 
&gt; EDS saying 
&gt; a minimum of 5 years was necessary. Just imagine the state being 
&gt; contracted to EDS for 14 yrs ! 
&gt; 
&gt; (Says he thinking back to the interview)The Govt has started 
&gt; a review of its IT 
&gt; plans/contracts although there is two years to run. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Treasury will be looking for cost savings and breaking up 
&gt; the IT contract 
&gt; may be considered to that end.
&gt; 
&gt; Others may be able to fill in the gaps.
&gt; 
&gt; The interview caused me to reflect again about LinuxSA and 
&gt; the discussion a few weeks ago about Linux in business. We 
&gt; still lack anyone to speak for us. We are just a disparate 
&gt; group of Admins, users and enthusiasts, without much 
&gt; likelihood of influencing IT policy. 
&gt; 
&gt; What would constitute a representative Linux group in South 
&gt; Australia? I would suggest some Linux Admins from each Uni, 
&gt; LinuxSA members, Unix users group members, someone from the 
&gt; Govt and also business representation. It would need to be 
&gt; headed by someone with some media skills.
&gt; 
&gt; The object of the group would be to determine the extent of 
&gt; Linux usage in public and educational institutions, to 
&gt; coordinate future expansion, offer expertise to institutions 
&gt; wanting to move to opens source, to provide leadership in 
&gt; explaining the benefits of Open Source in Govt and business, 
&gt; to seek funding for a part-time (initially) position to 
&gt; employ someone to 
&gt; further these objectives.
&gt; 
&gt; Even this may be too late for the current round of negotiations.
