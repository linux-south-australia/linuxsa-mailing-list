&gt; If linux achieved over 50% of market share, the big players would form a

&gt; we would have to write another linux, which is really a programmers' 
&gt; operating system, not so much an ordinary user system.

I don't see why it can't be both a programmer's operating system as
well as one for ordinary users.  There are linux distributions which
target the desktop users, ones which favour programmers, and ones
which optimise for servers/enterprise. There is nothing stopping a
group of programmers forking any of the open source software if they
believe the "mainstream" is going in the wrong direction.

&gt; If linux achieves even 30% or market share, I predict that most linuxistas
&gt; will take refuge in BSD as a system that nerds can be comfortable in.

*shrug*. There are some people who like to use an OS that is only used
by a minority of people.  The main criteria I have for what I use is
that it fits *my* needs the best. At the moment, thats Linux.

&gt; When MS got taken to court, the lawyers shouldn't have demanded that a few 
&gt; pathetic little API functions be revealed so that competitors could
&gt; write competing applications on the MS "platform". They should have demanded
&gt; that every protocol and file format used by MS should be open and free.
&gt; __That's__ what would remove their unfair monopoly position.

That's much easier said than done. You're assuming that it has in fact
ever been properly documented, let alone that documentation been
tested. With a lot of proprietary applications the code *is* the
documentation for the protocol. Ideally you'd want an open standard,
but realistically if you're taking an proprietary protocol and making
it open, the source code is going to much more useful than any
documentation.

&gt; Linux can only take over the world by becoming _not_ linux.
&gt; I just wish that linux advocates would stop to think about _why_ they
&gt; want to take over from MS. If it's to guarantee the survival of linux,

I want more apps on Linux. For a lot of them we're below the market
share required for ISV's to invest the resources to port.
