&gt; When I first received the message,  I was going to write him back and 
&gt; say this:
&gt; 
&gt; Can you write the article instead? :-)   I don't care if I am even 
&gt; listed as a contributor, I just think that this information 
&gt; is important 
&gt; for CPA's to know.
&gt; 
&gt; That's honestly what I feel about his opinion on the "article 
&gt; worthiness" of the paper.

Hmm... evidently you and he differ, but he's the editor, and you're not...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; So when he says 'premature' I worry because it quashes my 
&gt; main purpose 
&gt; for writing the article in the first place. Its silly that 
&gt; Linux should 
&gt; have to run the applications 100% instead of 95% perfectly in 
&gt; order for 
&gt; this information to be newsworthy.

Well, perhaps that's a major point of difference. I would suspect that
accountants being generally more conservative than your average business,
95% functional is 5% too little to even consider. Now, I didn't read the
article thoroughly, but I did skim-read it. I can't remember much of it,
because I'm not an accountant, and it wasn't a field that interested me :)
... I also am not familiar with the magazine you were talking about...
However, none of that's not going to stop me from having an opinion ... :)

What if you took a different approach entirely? Perhaps make it a "this is
what the future may hold" type article, explaining that "it's not quite 100%
yet, but it's getting close", and what kinds of benefits may flow when it
all comes together. You could explain some of the work you've been doing in
very broad terms (I've got most of the software we need for our practice
working, and am making progress daily), and promise to keep people informed
(perhaps set up a blog where you can log your progress, and invite others
doing similar work to contribute -- then again, there's probably a larger
community site out there somewhere already doing exactly this). 

Of course, it would be ideal to bounce this type of idea off the editor to
gauge his opinion on it. Perhaps he can explain what sort of approach would
not be premature (bear in mind he did offer some words of encouragement, so
he's interested in the topic in general). 

Cheers
