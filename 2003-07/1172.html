Continuing where I left off...

It looks like Mutt and emacs are working now. I have three almost identical mails that went through. 

After I first set up FreeBSD, I boot into it and I would see an error message from Sendmail saying that the domain name FreeBSD could not be qualified. I googled for some answers and then found <A HREF="http://dbforums/arch/180/2003/5/794970,">http://dbforums/arch/180/2003/5/794970,</A> which seemed to tell me to change /etc/rc.conf to read sendmail_enable="NONE". I think that caused my problem with the mail not going out. (Or so I thought). I sence changed sendmail back to read sendmail_enable="yes" and to my surprise this morning, the mails actually went through. I don't know if that has anything to do with my setting up of the ports, probably just changing the setting back. If I have more issues with it, I will just go with Postfix.

Ports

Pretty amazing. Must be a big effort to get those set up. It is nice and automated, works well in general I can tell.

While moving up to kde 3.1 I got a dependency error and it couldn't install Qt 3.1. I wrote the maintainer about this and he basically said that I may have to do that manually. He told me to run pkg_info | grep -i qt to find my versions.kwatch-2.3.0_1, qt-3.0.5_5 and qt-bluecurve-theme-0.47 came up. I don't know how to take the next step, I didn't see a /usr/ports/x11/qt directory.

XDM

If I run xdm, I can't log in at all. It just gives me the grey screen and then my screen flickers after a while. I usually have to resort to hitting the reset button because I don't know how to make it stop, ctrl-alt-backspace does not solve the issue.

Root Password

After hitting reset on a XDM blinking monitor loop, I hit reset. I then booted up and typed boot and then an OK sign came up before I was finished typing boot. I then typed boot -s, then mount -rw / and then it said run fsck, so I did. After that I typed mount -a, then emacs /etc/ttys and changed the ttyv8 back to off.

When I got to the log in prompt I typed "root" and then I was in, no password was asked for. My /etc/printcap was also changed to the vanilla file, so I had to reedit it back to enable my printer.

Printing

Printing is a bit flakey right now. I didn't finish the print setup. I was ok doing everything up to setting up spooler filters, but that's just a bit too much work, so it wasn't fun anymore. Its a lot to know.

Sound

I don't have sound support, but for the pc card. In Linux both of my sound cards work, one is a via and the other is an aztech. I don't know how to set up sound in FreeBSD yet.

I have to go back into Linux to find the last email I got with help, I don't have it here.
