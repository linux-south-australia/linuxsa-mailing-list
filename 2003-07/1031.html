&gt; &gt; dragged kicking and screaming into the 1960s - 
&gt; &gt; that'll show 'em.
&gt; Hmmm interesting...

that is a valid point. political infighting in 
brisvages has a lot to answer for... nothing
curbs growth like muppets at the top.
 
&gt; When I moved from Brisbane to Adelaide, I felt I 
&gt; was going back a few years...
&gt; Adelaide was like Brisbane but flatter and slower.

slower in what way? only traffic? is that because
you can't do 100mph along the equivalent of the western
freeway in adelaide?

adelaide has a clue and a plan where Brisbane often
doesn't. adelaide also has a conscious where brisbane
doesn't, especially on social planning issues.

&gt; Having moved back to Brisbane recently (last month), 
&gt; I've seen Brisbane has moved ahead in leaps and 
&gt; bounds over the last three years, while Adelaide
&gt; definitely hadn't.

how so?

has brisbane got their light rail project finished yet?
its only been in the planning stages for ten years.

its funny how transport is the first thing folks notice
when they move to somewhere. and the thing that seems
to make the biggest first impression.

&gt; Adelaide drivers are by far some of the worst in the
&gt; country (red lights ? indicators ? merging ?),
&gt; and this I've heard from native Adelaide residents
&gt; (as well as just about every "tourist" you meet).

i have lived and worked in Brisbane, Adelaide and
stayed a while in Melbourne and Sydney.
and i recon that Sydney traffic is the most diabolical!
worse than even London IMHO ...

&gt; Oh well, different views...

indeed, thank goodness for diversity...

cheers,

Kim
