&gt; &gt; The line reads:
&gt; &gt;     RX bytes:1509937488 (1439.9 Mb)  TX bytes:3869741880 (3690.4 Mb)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What i was wondering is if this value is the correct value? (the
&gt; &gt; machines have not been reboooted).
&gt; 
&gt; It should be the correct value, but that depends on your 
&gt; TCP/IP stack code. I'm assuming Linux or derivative here?

You may wish to try recording it on a daily basis for a week or two, and
estimate from that what your expected usage should be, given no
abnormalities. Also check for signs of 0wnage, because people often crack
machines, make an anonymous FTP server there, and store warez -- see if you
have any unexpected files lying around (MP3s, AVIs, ISOs, etc)...

You may also wish to consider traffic that might have been sent to you but
you have been blocking... It's possible that traffic is being charged by
your ISP, because it gets sent to you, but gets filtered out before your
machine sees it... I have a feeling that the number you list above would
include packets rejected by iptables & friends, but if you have a separate
device that is filtering packets, perhaps you are being charged for these
packets but not actually seeing them on this interface.

Also, as an aside, I'm just wondering what derivative of Linux you would be
talking about? I didn't know there were any... Perhaps uLinux or something,
but... Hmm... the BSDs and Unices are not Linux derivatives...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does the 'ifconfig' result show ALL data that has passed through a
&gt; &gt; network card, or is
&gt; &gt; some stuff not shown (e.g. secure traffic or whatever?).
&gt; 
&gt; This I couldn't be sure about, you might want to try traffic 
&gt; accounting using firewall rules (iptables, ipfw, etc)

It is my understanding that iptables doesn't actually account correctly,
because packets can overwrite the buffer before accounting takes place. I
learnt that from one list member who posted a open source packet accounting
program about a month ago. For the life of me, I can't recall the name of
this member (sorry -- I'm sure I'll recognise it, but it's late on a Friday,
so you'll forgive me for misplacing your name... :) .... 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (i'm presuming that most co-location places charge for both 
&gt; incoming 
&gt; &gt; AND outgoing data)
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, I have a server at Internode and I only get charged for 
&gt; incoming data to my server,  unless there's been some 
&gt; oversight by Simon and Co.

Most places only charge for one way (for colo, it's usually outgoing), but
some charge for the highest of outgoing and incoming, and some charge for
the total... Depends on your ISP.
