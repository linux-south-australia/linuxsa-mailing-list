&gt;Barney,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is just like saying that we should introduce non-compulsory
&gt;&gt;&gt;unionism in the interests of "freedom".
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The shipwrights will say: "Introduce freedome of choice" with respect to
&gt;the maritime unions. They will then offer non-union labour about 25-50%
&gt;more than union labour. Eventually though, they'll drop EVERYONE's
&gt;conditions.
&gt;
&gt;It's NOT freedom of choice - it's freedom for those with the most
&gt;resources and MONEY to do what they want.
&gt;
I understand the example David, what I don't understand is how it relates to the topic at hand. I am talking about putting _greater_ restrictions on proprietary solutions so that the opportunity to use anti-competitive behaviour (lock-in software) is removed. What you are describing in your analogy is the current state of play, not what I am proposing.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you want to put something in that will get amended to what you want, 
&gt;&gt;you obviously would need to start asking for something more than your 
&gt;&gt;aim, not less - as is the case here. Regardless I disagree with the 
&gt;&gt;thought anyway - ask for what you want and back it up with good logical 
&gt;&gt;arguments.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;You wouldn't make a good politician would you? We're talking politics
&gt;here, not computers. It's NOT logical. The things that matter here are:
&gt;  
&gt;
I fail to see why backing up your argument logically is detrimental to 
getting your point across.

&gt; * who has the most money?
&gt;   [I would suggest Microsoft, SCO, IBM et al by a long shot]
&gt;
&gt; * who has the most political sway?
&gt;   [hell, we can't even agree on whether the bill is good or not]
&gt;
&gt; * who's sexier in the public eye?
&gt;   [seen those Windows XP ads? They're cool. Now, what open source ads do
&gt;    you remember seeing on TV? If Howard/Rann stomps on the open source
&gt;    community, who cares - you can do it all with XP anyway]
&gt;
&gt;Bend the mind, think out of the square. Don't attempt to argue logic in a
&gt;public forum against the politicians. Play them at their own game ;-)
&gt;  
&gt;
I understand this cynical view of politics, I am also a cynic, but the 
fact remains, if you make an argument for doing something, it should 
actually achieve your aims - or somebody will rightfully point this out 
and use it against you. If you are in the minority, ie. you don't have 
much political sway - you will need to convince others to support you. 
If your argument is full of holes, I would suggest you would have less 
chance than if it wasn't.
Just because others make illogical arguments, doesn't mean it a good 
thing to do. The things you claim matter before logic help illogical 
things get through _despite_ the fact they are illogical not because 
they are illogical. Applying logic as well should only make those other 
reasons _easier_ to meet, not harder.
Play the game to your advantage - yes. Give your opponents unecessary 
ammunition to shoot you down with - no.
On top of all this, going by your examples, how is asking for open 
source anymore likely to succeed than asking for open-standards? At 
least by asking for open standards you aren't taking on those big money 
companies head on - they won't be forced to open their code just to be 
considered.

Barney
