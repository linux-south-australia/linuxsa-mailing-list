How does that work?


&gt; useful to the graphic design industry) and sell the result -- because
&gt; the Pantone system is patented, and I wouldn't be able to include source.

Is that a fault with GPL or a criticism of conditions of licensing the
Pantone patent?  Would a BSD licence (for GIMP) help?  What about if
you didn't quite understand how to do Pantone, and neither did I, but
between us we both did; but sadly we didn't know each other?


&gt; You own and run a business.  You know how important competitive
&gt; advantage is.  I don't understand why you'd have issue with this.

I have no issue with BSD licences.  I was responding to a question about
how BSD denies you access to your own gift.  I think, were I contemplating
writing free software, I'd do it under a GPL licence rather than a BSD
licence.  That would have nothing to do with denying others the right
to make money from my work (which we have both agreed they can do under
GPL), rather it would be to ensure that I didn't end up having to buy
my own work.  See my later comments on Ingres to explain this.


&gt; Generally speaking, the only people who really, really care are software
&gt; authors who use the GPL to prevent a company from making a buck from
&gt; their work

No, I think the ones who mostly care are software authors who are denied
access to improvements to their work.


&gt;&gt; The BSD is what you use to
&gt;&gt; deny someone else the right to make a buck.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;boggle&gt;  How?

BSD lets someone improve a product such that the original becomes
worthless, and deny others the right to make a buck from (or even use)
that improved version.

Let's take the case of Ingres.  It was free, under a BSD licence, and
became stale.  Then it became commercialised, refreshed and proprietary.
You couldn't do anything with Ingres because, frankly, the BSD version
wasn't good enough to compete.  The people who ran with it had what
amounted to a free leg up on Oracle, Informix and IBM.  Of course, the
Ingres story has a happy ending, being Postgres, but that easily could
have been different.
