&gt; My memory is hazy about this, but isn't it the case that UNIX-like

I don't think so.  One reason for root reserved disk space is so that
root is still able to log in and clear space in the file system when a
file system has been filled by a non-root user.  For example, login
writes entries to utmp and wtmp when a user logs in - if the file
system that wtmp lives on is filled to 100%, then login tries to append
an entry to wtmp and fails, then login may typically abort, thus
preventing root from being able to log in and clear the problem.

On some systems that I look after there are no reserved blocks on the
file systems allocated to Oracle, and the datafiles are preallocated
to cover nearly 100% of the file system size (with none of that auto
extend rubbish set within Oracle).  There are definitely no performance
issues with doing that.  NTFS, however, is supposed to have problems
when reaching near full capacity[1].
