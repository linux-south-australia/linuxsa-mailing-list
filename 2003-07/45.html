&gt; I know Internode people contribute to the list, but their silence on 
&gt; whether Internode do offer DSL wirless may be taken to mean 
&gt; that contrary 
&gt; to what Simon has stated, they don't do DSL wireless?
&gt; Can anyone confirm that they do or they don't. There seems to be 
&gt; conflicting statements and I would really like to explore it 
&gt; further if 
&gt; they do.

Steve,

What is DSL wireless? DSL is Digital Subscriber Line, which would indicate a
physical line... wireless would indicate the opposite. I assume that some
people are marketing broadband wireless as DSL wireless, but that would be
just marketing terminology...

If it's broadband wireless you're after, then yes, Internode will do high
speed wireless links (as Simon Hackett said: "Internode/Agile offers
wireless DSL equivalents along that strip to spots that don't have ADSL
coverage on Greenhill Rd").  I would imagine that this connectivity is
provided either by microwave or 802.11b, but there may be other options.

Certainly Adam are able to provide a similar service, though it is my
understanding that usually they would rather lease roof space and an
ethernet port, and have you manage your own microwave link (John Edwards
will likely correct me if I have this wrong). That would mean you could use
whatever technology you chose, within reason (provided it's legal, doesn't
interfere with other equipment, and isn't so heavy that the roof can't
support it... though I can't think what you'd be doing with something that
heavy anyway).

There are, of course, others, but I suspect that unless you want cheap and
nasty, most needs would be satisfied by one of this lists two favourite
ISPs... :)
