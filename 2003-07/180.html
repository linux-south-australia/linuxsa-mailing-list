I have just written and submitted an article to the US Journal of 
Accountancy (JOA), about Linux, and if I am lucky, it will make it in. 
When I first started making the article, I really wanted to do some 
things that I realized I coul not, as it would just confuse the reader:

1. Call Linux....Gnu/Linux/X11/Kde/etc   I have a lot of respect for 
Stallman, but I have to deliver a clear message.

2. Include other Unix like oses, especially FreeBSD.    Same as above. I 
started calling Linux Unix, and then I started to branch out into a Free 
BSD discussion, but then I realized that I did not have the skills yet 
to reproduce  what I have done in Linux.

3. List applications unfamiliar to the reader - Unknown can mean not viable.

4. Include my own tax project in the article.  - We have a lot of work 
to do and mentioning it would muddy the water on an already complicated 
subject

I was able to explain Samba in a sentence or two so I includced that.

Originally I sent a draft had the document in LyX format and sent a PDF 
and received this message:

&gt;Dear Mr. Leone:
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your interest in the Journal of Accountancy.  However, I
&gt;was unable to open your attachment.  Please resend, in Word, if
&gt;possible.
&gt;  
&gt;

Yes, we did have a recent discussion @ this now didn't we.  If Linux is 
truely viable, I have to be able to deal with the rest of the world, and 
I did.

I moved the thing over to MS Word, and that took a while. Word didn't 
like .eps files, but liked .tiff files, so I had to convert them. I then 
finished the article.

So I can guess that some folks may want to tar and feather me. 
Fortnately I will be in LA, such as not to be found. :-D

Anyway here is the article as I submitted it to the JOA.  It is a pdf 
and is 3mb. I am in a rush and did not have time to turn it into a html. 
Maybe next week.

Here it is(3MB big, pdf): <A HREF="http://www.morton2001.org/linuxacct.pdf">http://www.morton2001.org/linuxacct.pdf</A>
