Yesterday I posted a page from Cadalogue.com that showed a growing trend
in their use of open source for creating and disseminating cad "add on"
packages. These are the millions of lisp files that people create so that
their cad software can draw springs and gadgets.
Enclosed is a copy of a mail that illustrates further the amazing tentacles of
open-source and its impact on society. Opsound is not for everyone. Some of the music
(or is it sound) is way out. But it serves as another illustration of what
is happening out there.

Musicians and sound artists of all kinds are invited to join the Opsound
project.

Opsound is a record label using an open source, copyleft model, an
experiment in practical gift economics, a
+laboratory for new ways of releasing music.

In its first phase of operation, Opsound is gathering material for an open
sound pool which will be drawn on
+for the creation of a series of online and real-world microlabels. All
material for the sound pool will be
+released under a Creative Commons license (the "Attribution-ShareAlike
license"), a copyleft license in the
+spirit of open source software license which allows for all kinds of
copying, remixing, use, and reuse while
+retaining an attribution to the original artist.

Anyone is encouraged to contribute sound files to the open sound pool,
including field recordings, ambiences,
+incomplete improvisations, monologues & dialogues, unfinished experiments,
detached soundtracks, vocal solos,
+strange noises, bedroom laptop, microsound, generative, glitch dub, idm,
minimal techno, blip hop, hip hop,
+turntablist, downtempo, uptempo, reggae, ragga, raga, roots, breakbeat,
basement punk, garage band, indy,
+shoegazer, psychedelia, noise, song, be-bop, free jazz, modern composition,
avant-anything, etc. Sound files
+can be complete pieces of music, or elements intended be combined into
something new.

DEADLINE: There is currently no deadline, and entries will be accepted on an
ongoing basis. You are, however,
+encouraged to enter your material as soon as is conveniently possible.

HOW TO ENTER: Visit the website at <A HREF="http://www.opsound.org,">http://www.opsound.org,</A> Please read the
guidelines and faq, and then use the
+entry form.
