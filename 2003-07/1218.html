&gt; &gt; But isn't IPCop a GPL replacement for Smoothwall? (the commercial

&gt; IPCop was Smoothwall WITHOUT Richard Morrell. He makes me 
&gt; look the most polite, saint that's ever existed.

yes he is a prick and makes david look quite gentle and agreeable =)

the smoothwall project is a prime example of business
or a persons ambition tearing the OSS community appart.

and this seems to be what this whole thread is about.
business wants access to code/software, and control
the outcome of its own modifications.

that is fine. i am not saying that is bad/evil/etc.
thats what software licencing is all about.

what i am saying is that business bitching about
the GPL because they have less access to it, or
have less leverage to use it in the market place
is unfair and they should choose other means to 
achieve what they need to do.

like i said before, if you don't like that a piece
of software is licenced under the GPL, write your
own.
