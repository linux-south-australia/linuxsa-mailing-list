Are you intentionally trying to be an annoying prick David?   Or is that 
just how you are?  Twice in two days you've been picking needlessly at 
things I've posted or done.  WHat's the issue?  

&gt; &gt; a) getting PCI cards that work with wireless is the issue 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it?

Yes.  Since the DLink PCI card got a rev there hasn't been a cheap PCI one 
available - this has been discussed quite a few times on this very list.  
Have you missed those?

&gt; &gt; b) I've d/led the driver tar ball but I cannot tell 100% if indeed it
&gt; &gt; does work with the PCI card
&gt; 
&gt; Well the problem there is 15" in front of the screen isn't it?

Tell you what, if you want to be a smartarse about it - you download it and 
see if you can tell.  It's a series of binary objects (a binary driver 
currently) with no documentation.  I'm a competent programmer and integrator 
but without the actual hardware I do find it a tad more involved ... Heck, 
I've only got an honours computer science degree and almost 10 years of 
industry experience, but hell, I must be a moron.

&gt; &gt; c) the email from pcrange is at least saying they'll be supporting it
&gt; &gt; under linux and it'll be getting better (and hopefully oss not a binary
&gt; &gt; driver)
&gt; 
&gt; And?

And what?  I thought that people on "linuxsa" would be please about a 
company saying that YES they were going to support linux on a cheap and 
useful piece of kit.  I could be wrong.
