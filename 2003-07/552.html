IPv4 fragmentation doesn't quite work as you describe.

A host sends a packet.  If this exceeds a link MTU then the
router attached to that link fragments the packet so each
of the packet fragments is small enough to pass across the
link.

The router at the other end of the link does not reassemble
the packets but simply forwards them.  This makes sense, for
two reasons

1) packet reassembly would force the router to track state
    about each connection crossing a link and thus would set
    an upper limit on the number of connections which could
    cross a link at any one time.  An IP packet can be 64KB
    in size, so a reasonable number of connections could
    impose memory requirements in the MB.

2) the downstream router might not see all the fragments
    as they might take another path through the network to
    the host.  Imagine per-packet round-robin on a link or
    a routing change on a path.

The receiving host is the only party which is always guarunteed
to see all fragments, so it must be able to do packet reassembly.
So the design question is "why should routers need to reassemble
packets when the receiver has to be able to do so anyway"?

Fragmentation is massively inefficient comapred to sending the
right-sized frame in the first place.  For this reason most IPv4
implementations do "path MTU discovery" and set the Don't Fragment
option on packets.

If the path changes, thus perhaps decreasing MTU, then the packets
get to a router that will try to fragment them, go "whoops the
Don't Fragment option is set", and will send back a ICMP error
"fragmentation required and DF set".

The sending host will use that ICMP error as a hint to drop
the sent MTU.  By guessing about the IPv4 sender will eventually
find a MTU just at or below the smallest MTU on the packet's
path.


IPv6 has two changes from IPv4.

1) Path MTU discovery is compulsory and there is no packet
    fragmentation.

IPv6 is aimed at making life easier for ASIC designers.  So complicated
schemes like fragmentation aren't looked upon well (as the ASIC either
needs to be complex or packets which need fragmentation punted to
the CPU, which puts a limit on the packets-per-second).

Given that Path MTU Discovery works well in IPv4, the IPv6 designers
dropped fragmentation altogether.

2) The ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" has information.

The ICMPv4 message "Fragmentation Required and DF Set" just tells
the sender that the sent packet is too big for a link.  So the
sender is forced to guess the next MTU to try, which is hard to do.

Ther ICMPv6 message "Packet Too Big" tells the sender what the MTU
of the link the packet tried to cross was.  So the sender knows what
MTU size to try next (it still might fail, as the next link could
have a even smaller MTU, but the right packet size will be found
pretty quickly).

There is no way that this calculation is 5% of the total packet
transmission CPU.  In any case, it's obviously well less than
the CPU used in the IPv4 algorithm to guess the path MTU.

&gt; I am also a little confused in that if at present the standard for LANs
&gt; is ethernet (with an MTU of 1500 bytes), then under IPv6 wouldn't that be
&gt; the smallest MTU along the route and so the packets would be this big?

The smallest MTU of a path doesn't differ between IPv4 and IPv6.
The packets run over the same link-layer technologies (ethernet,
ATM, SDH, PPP over dialup) and it's the link-layer technology
which sets the biggest packet which can cross the link.

&gt; ...if the path is worked out prior to transmission, what happens if the
 &gt; path changes enroute for different packets to that the calculation
 &gt; was done on?

new path MTU &gt; old path MTU

   Nothing, so packets are now smaller than those which could be
   sent so the connection is suboptimal.  Implication for hosts
   is that cached path MTUs should time out.

new path MTU = old path MTU

   All's well.

new path MTU &lt; old path MTU

   Router connected to link with the small MTU sends a ICMPv6 "Too Big"
   to the sending host.  The sending host records the new path MTU size
   and lowers the size of sent packets accordingly.

   For reliable connections such as TCP, the implementation can wait
   for the TCP Ack timer to expire and re-send the packet.  This isn't
   optimal (as the TCP now thinks it has encountered congestion) so
   most implementations cheat and the IP layer hints to the TCP layer
   that the MTU has changed and TCP immediately retransmits without
   entering congestion avoidance (ie, low performance) mode.

&gt; Finally, under IPv6 the hop count is restricted to prevent endless loops
 &gt;(amongst&gt; other things), and this is good, but it is restricted to a
 &gt; relatively low number, like 16 or 20 (how quickly I forget). Surely
 &gt; much data would need more hops than that to get to some places.

IPv4 and IPv6 both have a counter which is decremented per
hop.  IPv4's is called Time To Live (the original idea being
that it would be decremented once per second or once per hop,
but in practice no packet is queued in a router for more than
a second).  IPv6's is called Hop Count.

TTL and Hop Count do exactly the same thing.  They allow a
looping packet to be discarded rather than live in the
network forever.

TTL and Hop Count both start with a value of 64.  The older
RFCs have smaller values.  You need to be careful with RFCs,
they often have details amended by later RFCs.  There's also
"implementation practice" which isn't documented in a RFC
which is designed to be a standard -- this is to allow implementation
practices to change over the years.  Sometimes the current
implementation practice is documented in a "informational"
RFC, other times it isn't but is simply known informally
to the implementation community.

This distinction between "informational" and "standards-track"
RFCs doesn't exist in older RFCs (like those defining IPv4,
ICMPv4 and TCP) so you need to read those with an eye to
identifying what statements are standards-setting and which
are merely good advice for implementers of that period
(and perhaps still good advice today, or perhaps not).
