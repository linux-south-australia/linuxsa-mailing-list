Ok, great, that's going back to the point of view of the licensee 
which I was talking about in my original email message.  And we've
already established that the GPL imposes obligations on licensees
who wish to redistribute, and that the BSD license doesn't.

But what about the licensor...?  After having gone into the detail
you've expressed above, what, exactly, is the GPL doing for YOU, as
the author of the code?

Are you using the GPL because you'd feel ripped-off if someone else 
used your labour to make a buck?  If so, your reasons for using the 
GPL are basically selfish, and otherwise enlightened arguments about
the superiority of free software will always have their basis in 
money and hard commercialism.

That's your perogative, and I have no problem with it.  But I think
there's a lot of dishonesty in the "free software" and "open source"
world.  Just about everyone runs around talking about how selfless they
are by creating all this software off the sweat of their brows, 
pouring blood, sweat and tears into it for little or no financial
reward.  But if they were *REALLY* selfless they wouldn't have a problem
with someone else taking those "gifts" and making a buck off them if
they thought it was worth making a go of it.

... which is effectively what happens when a programmer puts his creative
output under the BSD license.
