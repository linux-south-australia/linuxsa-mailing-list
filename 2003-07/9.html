Thanks for the reply.
I am happy to have squid using the amount of RAM it is using, after all the
purpose is to speed up squid and its associated processes, not have the
machine sit on 1% all day long.

I am 'obsessing' about the CPU usage because when the system is underload
kscand is occupying 30+% at which times there is 0% idle. I thought that if
I can reduce its usage (if at all possible) It would assist in a marginally
better response time

As far as the horse shit attached to my email. You may have noticed the
address I sent from, you may also have noticed that this is a government
address, you could then assume that I don't include this stuff for fun, at
that it is a requirement for generated emails to contain some form of horse
shit as a disclaimer.

BTW this box has had load averages of 5+ up to 10.

Yes I am aware that a faster disk subsystem would prove significantly better
performance wise. I have 4x 18GB 10K U160 SCSI disks in my draw for this
purpose. But for now the 2 disks can handle around 120 I/O's a sec which is
just adequate.

Cheers,

&gt; What the hell is it (kscand) and why is it occupying so much CPU time?

It's part of the kernel;  it scans your memory for free pages.  The rate at
which it scans is loosely coupled to the demand for free memory, and hence
is somewhat tied to the amount of RAM in your machine (less RAM will make it
use more CPU;  increasing RAM or decreasing demand for RAM will make it use
less).

If you buy more memory or make squid use less memory then kscand will do
less.  But have a good hard think about whether that's the result you really
want to achieve;  there is a pretty savage cost-benefit analysis outcome for
both of those scenarios.

&gt; I  belive it has now been replaced by 3 processes, kscand/DMA, 
&gt; kscand/Normal and kscand/HighMem in later RH versions ive googled and 
&gt; got very little other than it is a kernel based (which is easily 
&gt; worked out anyway) page checker. Is this memory page or swap...?

Is there a difference...?

&gt; If it is RAM based, the 1.5GB of it may account for it being slightly 
&gt; higher than normal, but its a 2Ghz machine and it should not be using 
&gt; the amount of CPU time it is.

Err - why not?  111 minutes in five days is roughly 3% of your system.
And your machine is 72% idle -- So why you do care about the CPU utilization
of -any- of your processes anyway?  It's not like CPU cycles are at a
premium on your system.  Web caches are more IO-bound than CPU-bound;
Buying a fast disk subsystem (e.g., a properly tuned RAID array) will
deliver vastly better results than tinkering with a few percentage points of
CPU overhead.

(side note:  I've never quite understood why people obsess over processes
using large percentages of CPU time.  It's almost as if there's a mindset
that says there's something wrong with using 100% of your CPU -- even though
the scheduler does a sterling job of maintaining excellent response times
for load averages up to about 5.00.  You've bought 100% of a CPU, why
shouldn't you use 100% of a CPU?)

Blah blah blah.  What a load of horse-shit.  Think of all the CPU
utilization, network bandwidth, IO throughput and disk space wasted by mail
servers all over the world as they spin their wheels uselessly forwarding
that hideously huge signature to everyone on this mailing list, for no
measurable benefit to anyone.  Betcha kscand pales into insignficance next
to the cumulative weight of that abject wastage...
