Hey all,

I was asked to pass this on to the list....




A friend passed this on to me, as I'm not subscribed to linuxsa anymore;
not
enough hours in the day. :)

&gt; &gt; From: Glen Turner &lt;<A HREF="mailto:glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au">glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au</A>&gt;
&gt; &gt; [ You can see what's going to happen.  Everytime someone uses
&gt; &gt;    open source software within the SA government Weatherill's
&gt; &gt;    comment will be used to make the Minister look silly in the
&gt; &gt;    trade press. He'll probably be lumped with this for years. ]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/17/1058035117513.html&gt">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/17/1058035117513.html&gt</A>;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; SA govt's main website runs on open source software
&gt; &gt; 

Jay's actually a pretty smart guy. He's probably been fed that
impression by
an advisor, sadly. I haven't actually seen the full quote of his
dismissing
OSS, if someone could post me a link I'd appreciate it. Some context
would
be nice, the SMH article didn't have much, or a link to another story or
anything.

&gt; &gt; The site has been running since 1997 and underwent a
&gt; makeover in 2000.
&gt; &gt; It is "maintained using Dreamweaver. The underlying technology
&gt; &gt; includes: IBM DB2, IBM Websphere and Java Server Pages."

Actually, it had a minor refit after that, but the about page doesn't
appear
to reflect it. The site's more open source than it states, running
Apache
Tomcat and PostgreSQL, rather than Websphere and DB2.

Cheers

Tom
