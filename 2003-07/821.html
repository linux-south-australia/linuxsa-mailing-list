Barney,

&gt; I understand the example David, what I don't understand is how it
&gt; relates to the topic at hand. I am talking about putting _greater_
&gt; restrictions on proprietary solutions so that the opportunity to use
&gt; anti-competitive behaviour (lock-in software) is removed. What you are
&gt; describing in your analogy is the current state of play, not what I am
&gt; proposing.

You're proposing open standards as opposed to open source. If you simply
promote open standards but do not mandate open source at the same
time--unless there is a justifiable reason to use a closed source
solution--then you land in my maritime union example.

&gt; I fail to see why backing up your argument logically is detrimental to 
&gt; getting your point across.

Because noone wants to hear the truth, especially if it's ugly.

&gt; I understand this cynical view of politics, I am also a cynic, but the 
&gt; fact remains, if you make an argument for doing something, it should 
&gt; actually achieve your aims - or somebody will rightfully point this out 
&gt; and use it against you.

Unless you happen to have a better marketing machine than them. Microsoft
et al have a better marketing machine than us.

&gt; If you are in the minority, ie. you don't have  much political sway -
&gt; you will need to convince others to support you.

Trust me, 10% of the population can change laws. The Christian Churches,
in  a country where Christians are becoming more of a minority, still hold
greater sway than their ostensible per cent of the population should.

[side swipe: it's the CHURCHES who tend to support censorship bills and
such]

&gt; If your argument is full of holes, I would suggest you would have less
&gt; chance than if it wasn't.

Quite likley.

&gt; reasons _easier_ to meet, not harder. Play the game to your advantage -
&gt; yes. Give your opponents unecessary ammunition to shoot you down with -
&gt; no.

Feed the stuff to shoot at you and quietly go in via the back door. It's
highly effective if you can do it right...

&gt; On top of all this, going by your examples, how is asking for open 
&gt; source anymore likely to succeed than asking for open-standards? At 
&gt; least by asking for open standards you aren't taking on those big money 
&gt; companies head on - they won't be forced to open their code just to be 
&gt; considered.

LOL

No, they'll just write the standards...
