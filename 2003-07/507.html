Adam,

I too have an ATI Radeon 9k, (actually Powercolour with ATI chip).

When I installed it, first attempt was from my Debian disks.  Can't remember 
what went wrong but eventually I got onto the ATI web site and downloaded 
their Linux driver.  This was on a recommendation discovered from a Google 
search.  The install is not straight forward at all; it requires amongst 
other things cut and paste between a XF86Config-4 file created with ATI 
utility and the original Config.  In addition, because I knew that the result 
would not be supported by dpkg, I made copies of all the files that were 
replaced by the ATI just in case I had to back out of it.  

If you have an rpm system, I expect that you could just install the ATI files 
without jumping through the hoops I've just described.  

I'm suitably impressed with the result.  I've been experimenting with  
flightgear simulator and I'm amazed to a watch and control a virtual 
environment inside an X11 app.

Finally, hows this for irony: the Win98 drivers from the ATI site contain a 
bug which prevents refresh rates higher than 60Hz even though it lies and 
claims higher rates (hurts my eyes).  However, my Linux/Xfree86 platform 
supports 85Hz no problems at all.

Good Luck,
-- 
Branko

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have been trying tonight to get my ATI Radeon 9000 do do TV out under
&gt; Linux. I can boot the machine with the TV plugged in as well as the monitor
&gt; and I get the text console mirrored on both screens (in excellent, readable
&gt; quality on the TV too).
&gt;
&gt; The problem is X won't start.
&gt;
&gt; I have installed the GATOS drivers, but they don't seem to work, and they
&gt; complain about no screens being defined.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
