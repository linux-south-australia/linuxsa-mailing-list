 &gt; Whilst I havent seen the film (a decent screening of the film would be 
 &gt; ex), there is no real debate that adding a bit of contentious sex and 
 &gt; violence to a film has been an effective way for directors to get 
 &gt; attention for their films, however an interesting question is, can 
 &gt; australian national cinema be considered art if it repeatedly sinks to 
 &gt; cheap porno tactics? and is Ken Parks use of sex appropraite to the 
 &gt; context of the story and not just porn?

Here's a rule of thumb for you all to ponder.

If sex is superfluous to the story, and has been added only to provoke
tittilation, then it can be removed when the OFLC refuses classification,
then the OFLC will review the edited version of the movie and it'll
pass with an MA15+ or an R rating.  Producers may be reluctant to edit
their films after they've been released, but given a choice between 
removing a sex scene and having their movie banned they'll generally 
remove the sex scene.

If, however, the sex is a key cornerstone of the movie, then it cannot
be removed without fatally damaging the storyline or the message the
film is trying to communicate. That will result in the film's
classification being refused, and it will be banned in Australia as
a result.

Generally speaking, that means all the "serious cinema" movies which
have been banned by the OFLC over the last few years (Ken Park, Lolita,
etc) have been refused classification because the controversial content
has been integral to the story, rather than added for cheap thrills.

Australia's classification system is biased TOWARDS cheap thrills, not
against them.  Pornography receives an R or X rating because the
producers know exactly what they need to do to stay on the "bright side
of the line".  Serious cinematic productions are refused classification
because it's nearly impossible to work out what the OFLC will take
offense to until after you've put together the finished film product.

... which is why you can *generally* make the assumption that any film
which is scheduled to be shown at an artistic film festival but is then
banned by the OFLC is actually a serious work of art.

Make of that what you will.
