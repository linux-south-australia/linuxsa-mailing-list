&gt; SUBJECT: URGENT ASSISTANCE REQUIRED
&gt;
&gt; DEAR SIR/MADAM:
&gt;
&gt; I AM MR. DARL MCBRIDE CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
&gt; EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SCO GROUP, FORMERLY KNOWN AS CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt; INTERNATIONAL, IN LINDON, UTAH, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I KNOW THIS
&gt; LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS
&gt; COMMUNICATIONS OR BUSINESS DEALINGS BEFORE NOW.
&gt;
&gt; MY ASSOCIATES HAVE RECENTLY MADE CLAIM TO COMPUTER SOFTWARES WORTH AN
&gt; ESTIMATED $1 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS.  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE
&gt; BECAUSE WE URGENTLY REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE TO OBTAIN THESE FUNDS.
&gt;
&gt; IN THE EARLY 1970S THE AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION
&gt; DEVELOPED AT GREAT EXPENSE THE COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE KNOWN
&gt; AS UNIX. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS OF MY COUNTRY PROHIBITED THEM FROM
&gt; SELLING THESE SOFTWARES AND SO THEIR VALUABLE SOURCE CODES REMAINED
&gt; PRIVATELY HELD. UNDER A SPECIAL ARRANGMENT SOME PROGRAMMERS FROM THE
&gt; CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF BERKELEY DID ADD MORE CODES TO THIS OPERATING
&gt; SYSTEM, INCREASING ITS VALUE, BUT NOT IN ANY WAY TO DILUTE OR DISPARAGE
&gt; OUR FULL AND RIGHTFUL OWNERSHIP OF THESE CODES, DESPITE ANY AGREEMENT
&gt; BETWEEN AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH AND THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY
&gt; OF BERKELEY, WHICH AGREEMENT WE DENY AND DISAVOW.
&gt;
&gt; IN THE YEAR 1984 A CHANGE OF REGIME IN MY COUNTRY ALLOWED THE AMERICAN
&gt; TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION TO MAKE PROFITS FROM THESE
&gt; SOFTWARES.  IN THE YEAR 1990 OWNERSHIP OF THESE SOFTWARES WAS
&gt; TRANSFERRED TO THE CORPORATION UNIX SYSTEM LABORATORIES.  IN THE YEAR
&gt; 1993 THIS CORPORATION WAS SOLD TO THE CORPORATION NOVELL.  IN THE YEAR
&gt; 1994 SOME EMPLOYEES OF NOVELL FORMED THE CORPORATION CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt; INTERNATIONAL, WHICH BEGAN TO DISTRIBUTE AN UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM
&gt; KNOWN AS LINUX.  IN THE YEAR 1995 NOVELL SOLD THE UNIX SOFTWARE CODES
&gt; TO SCO.  IN THE YEAR 2001 OCCURRED A SEPARATION OF SCO, AND THE SCO
&gt; BRAND NAME AND UNIX CODES WERE ACQUIRED BY THE CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt; INTERNATIONAL, AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt; INTERNATIONAL WAS RENAMED SCO GROUP, OF WHICH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS
&gt; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.
&gt;
&gt; MY ASSOCIATES AND I OF THE SCO GROUP ARE THEREFORE THE FULL AND
&gt; RIGHTFUL OWNERS OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARES KNOWN AS UNIX.  OUR
&gt; ENGINEERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT NO FEWER THAN SEVENTY (70) LINES OF OUR
&gt; VALUABLE AND PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODES HAVE APPEARED IN THE UPSTART
&gt; OPERATING SYSTEM LINUX. AS YOU CAN PLAINLY SEE, THIS GIVES US A CLAIM
&gt; ON THE MILLIONS OF LINES OF VALUABLE SOFTWARE CODES WHICH COMPRISE THIS
&gt; LINUX AND WHICH HAS BEEN SOLD AT GREAT PROFIT TO VERY MANY BUSINESS
&gt; ENTERPRISES. OUR LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE ADVISED US THAT OUR CONTRIBUTION TO
&gt; THESE CODES IS WORTH AN ESTIMATED ONE (1) BILLION U.S. DOLLARS.
&gt;
&gt; UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY EXTRACTING OUR FUNDS FROM THESE
&gt; COMPUTER SOFTWARES.  TO THIS EFFECT I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE MANDATE BY MY
&gt; COLLEAGUES TO CONTACT YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.  WE ARE PREPARED
&gt; TO SELL YOU A SHARE IN THIS ENTERPRISE, WHICH WILL SOON BE VERY
&gt; PROFITABLE, THAT WILL GRANT YOU THE RIGHTS TO USE THESE VAULABLE
&gt; SOFTWARES IN YOUR BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.  UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT ABLE
&gt; AT THIS TIME TO SET A PRICE ON THESE RIGHTS.  THEREFORE IT IS OUR
&gt; RESPECTFUL SUGGESTION, THAT YOU MAY BE IMMEDIATELY A PARTY TO THIS
&gt; ENTERPRISE, BEFORE OTHERS ACCEPT THESE LUCRATIVE TERMS, THAT YOU SEND
&gt; US THE NUMBER OF A BANKING ACCOUNT WHERE WE CAN WITHDRAW FUNDS OF A
&gt; SUITABLE AMOUNT TO GUARANTEE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS ENTERPRISE. AS
&gt; AN ALTERNATIVE YOU MAY SEND US THE NUMBER AND EXPIRATION DATE OF YOUR
&gt; MAJOR CREDIT CARD, OR YOU MAY SEND TO US A SIGNED CHECK FROM YOUR
&gt; BANKING ACCOUNT PAYABLE TO "SCO GROUP" AND WITH THE AMOUNT LEFT BLANK
&gt; FOR US TO CONVENIENTLY SUPPLY.
&gt;
&gt; KINDLY TREAT THIS REQUEST AS VERY IMPORTANT AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
&gt; I HONESTLY ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL AND
&gt; RISK-FREE.
