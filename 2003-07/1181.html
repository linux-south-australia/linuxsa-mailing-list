&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I'm having trouble coming up with any open source software at all that
&gt;&gt;  Aunt Nelly would use. :-)
&gt;
&gt; Nah, that's just being pessimistic :-) What's happening on the OSS
&gt; desktop is exciting!  Red Hat, Mandrake, Lindows and others are all
&gt; pitching (rightly so) at end users.  GNOME and KDE are looking nicer
&gt; all the time, and are getting deployed to large numbers of
&gt; non-technical desktops.

Well, they're looking more like Microsoft.

&gt; We're seeing big user-freiendly applications like Evolution (and
&gt; it's competitor Creationism :-), OpenOffice[1], MrProject, AbiWord,
&gt; Gnumeric etc etc etc.  And what's better?  All GPL or LGPL.

Are these user friendly, or do they just pretend to be?  I'm reminded
of the story of the moujik and the frozen bird.  The best thing you
can say about things like OpenOffice is that they're relatively easy
to learn if you have a Microsoft background.  That may or may not
include Aunt Nelly.

Despite this apparently negative start, though, I agree with you and
disagree with Mark.  There *are* free software programs that Aunt
Nelly (or in this case, Diane) would use.  Last Christmas I put
together a computer out of spare parts for a retired neighbour of
ours.  Based on FreeBSD, KDE and OpenOffice, it was far too heavy for
the 64 MB in the box.  I took out KDE and replaced it with fvwm2,
which improved things, and she no longer had time to make a pot of tea
while working with OpenOffice.  She had almost no instruction, but was
able to find her way around from the start.

A lot of people who say "it's not user friendly" mean "it's not enough
like Microsoft".  Don't confuse the two.  Once people get beyond the
stage of rank beginners with computers, the definition of user
friendliness changes to the advantage of UNIX-like systems.

&gt; [1] Started life non-free, but become a whole lot nicer once it was
&gt; freed.

Aunt Nelly?  Did you put your [1] in the wrong place?

Greg
