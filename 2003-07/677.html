&gt;
&gt; Yesterday was my day to drive home from Los Angeles and back to work
&gt; today.  Its a 5 hour drive, and I usually feel that its a waste of time
&gt; unless I can learn someything during the trip. In doing so, I usually
&gt; pick up an audio version of a book, and this time I picked up the audio
&gt; version of "Sunburned Country" by Bill Bryson.
&gt;
&gt; Before I heard this tape, I had a great admiration of Australia, and I
&gt; have even more now. Believe me, it would be an honor to be countrymen
&gt; with you all. But at the same time, I have too much faith in the people
&gt; I exchange emails with every day, to believe that the situation could
&gt; ever become as David Mosler describes.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Look at how the South Australian government just bowed
&gt;
&gt; Ah, but look at how America's State of Oregon just bowed down to
&gt; America....
&gt;
&gt; doh!
&gt;
&gt; I really truely believed that the bill would fail because of its
&gt; wording.  It mandated open source.  I think it's failing has little to
&gt; do with Australia's supposed bowing down.

I totally agree on that point, the bill was flawed. However, the reason I am 
saying the SA Government bowed to the ISC is because of the reasons given for 
not supporting the bill. They didn't say anything reasonable like "Automatic 
preferences are probably not a good idea...", they practically said "Open 
Source software sux0rz".

Cheers,

Damien

&gt;
&gt; &gt;to the ISC and practically denounced Open Source as "crap", or more
&gt; &gt; accurately (and I quote) "[not] suitable for fundamental business
&gt; &gt; functions" -- i.e. they are just towing the US Corporate lines.
&gt;
&gt; The ISC will use whatever tactic they feel appropriate for the political
&gt; situation. I say throw the "South Australian government just bowed"
&gt; belief in with the rest of the rubbish, and it will never be heard of
&gt; again. Embrase it and it will haunt you.
&gt;
&gt; When I first heard of the ISC's strategy for South Australia, I thought
&gt; that it was pretty damn weak. Australians have fought against harsh
&gt; weather and an unfamiliar environment to create one of the best
&gt; countries to live on Earth, including Brittian.
&gt;
&gt; Given that impresssive track record, I wonder why AU needs US trade at all.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Looking at the various bills being introduced there it looks like there's
&gt; &gt; a good chance of America becoming (even more of) a police state.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, and this is awful in my book.  If we had Bill Clinton back, I think
&gt; this would be less of an issue.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; P.S: No offence intended to American citizens reading :)
&gt;
&gt; You know none is. :-)
&gt;
&gt; BTW - Do you shop at Bullocks? :-D

&gt; &gt;&gt; AUSTRALIA has been urged to seriously consider becoming the
&gt; &gt;&gt; 51st state of the US.
&gt;
&gt; I wonder _who_ urged this?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; And American-born historian Dr David Mosler told a Brisbane
&gt; &gt;&gt; audience yesterday there was a 20 per cent chance of
&gt; &gt;&gt; Australia becoming an American state in the next 50 years.
&gt;
&gt; He sounds like Howard Stern, a radio star that makes ratings by being a
&gt; "shock jock." He says a great many outrageous things just to get a rise
&gt; out of people.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The visiting research fellow at Adelaide University, who has
&gt; &gt;&gt; lived in Australia since 1971, said the chances would
&gt; &gt;&gt; increase significantly in the event of a major Al-Qaeda
&gt; &gt;&gt; attack on Australia or if Indonesia became a fundamentalist
&gt; &gt;&gt; Islamic republic.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that Al-Quada's attack was one of theatrics, and probably the
&gt; most that they could muster. Surely they could have rented out an office
&gt; or two in the World Trade Center and done as much damage.
&gt;
&gt; In my book, Al-Quada are not impressive. In fact, I feel that we have
&gt; dome more damage to ourselves in responding to the attack, than was done
&gt; by the September 11 attackers.  They probably were hoping for us to self
&gt; destruct, expecting that we would not hold true to the beliefs of our
&gt; founding fathers:
&gt;
&gt; "Those willing to give up a little liberty for a little security deserve
&gt; neither security nor liberty. " Ben Franklin
&gt;
&gt; "Give me liberty or give me death" - Patrick Henry

&gt;
&gt; Instead we traded away our freedoms in the U.S. instead of insisting
&gt; that the airports be kept open, and that a steel door should be placed
&gt; between an airplane pilot and its passengers.
&gt;
&gt; There is no reason why Australia should overreact as we did.
