Hi Luke,

I had an open bug report with Mozilla.org about mozilla not being able
to run more than one instance of itself, don't know if this was RedHat
only. They answered this as the preferences file could get corrupt and
that they were reworking the preferences code.

So as Joseph has said try not using your old preferences.

&gt; Luke,
&gt; 
&gt; The word on Slashdot is that you have to NOT reuse your preference
&gt; settings from older versions of Mozilla. Weird things start happening
&gt; apparently.
&gt; 
&gt; Try nuking the Mozilla directory, then reinstalling. Then renaming your
&gt; .mozilla directory and start fresh. Copy your bookmarks across once
&gt; everything looks OK.
&gt; 
&gt; Mozilla 1.4 has been fine on my machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've tried using mozilla 1.4.
&gt; &gt; I've had nothing but problems with it.
&gt; &gt; I need a browser that can do java, flash, javascript, without problems under 
&gt; &gt; Linux.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mozilla 1.1 was much less buggy in that sense, but I couldn't do certain java 
&gt; &gt; things such as online banking at banksa, or library catalogue browsing
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mozilla 1.4 does not download files (it crashes, tried with zip and tar.gz 
&gt; &gt; files). It doesn't  allow me to set preferences, it bombs instead).
&gt; &gt; It doesn't do java, although I've installed the plugin, (it's clearly visible 
&gt; &gt; via a symbolic link in the /usr/local/mozilla/plugins directory)
&gt; &gt; In short it's bloody useless.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a suggestion for a browser that does all the above under 
&gt; &gt; Linux successfully,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If not it's a sad state of affairs, I'll have to revert to windows for 
&gt; &gt; browsing now as well as documents and spreadsheets :-(
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; suggestions welcomed,
&gt; &gt; kind regards,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Luke
