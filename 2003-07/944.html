 &gt; &gt; other people might make a profit out of their hard work.  I guess it
 &gt; &gt; all depends on how self-centered you are, doesn't it?  &lt;g,d,r&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; Well there's also this scenario:
 &gt;   - taxpayer funds software development as research.
 &gt;   - company takes research and productises it.
 &gt;   - taxpayer buys result, which it 90% owns but pays full price for.
 &gt; which the GPL avoids.

... but what problem is *really* being avoided?  If the same software
was BSD-licensed then we'd get this scenario instead:

   - taxpayer funds software development as research.
   - company takes research and productises it.
   - taxpayer buys result, which it 90% owns but pays full price for.
   - some taxpayers don't like that outcome, so they download the original
     BSD-licensed bits created by the government-funded research and 
     build their own systems around that instead.

"Ah ha!" you might say, "the original bits won't necessarily be production
quality, and may not be useful to anyone!"

And that's why the company is perfectly justified in selling a finished
product which incorporates that code to the taxpayers.
