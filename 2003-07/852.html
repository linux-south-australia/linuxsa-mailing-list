I wasn't going to say anything here, but I can't help it...

&gt; &gt; I don't see why the source must be open. If someone has a better 
&gt; &gt; product that is closed, why not use it?
&gt; 
&gt; Because how can you prove that a closed source program 
&gt; conforms to all the standards, doesn't act differently to 
&gt; other programs? And what happens if it ACCIDENTALLY doesn't 
&gt; conform but the company making it just goes "You'll have to 
&gt; wait until the next release."

And practically speaking, how are you going to prove that a large open
source project conforms to all the standards, and doesn't act differently to
other programs? It's pretty much the same in practice. All this bullshit
about you can fix it yourself is unrealistic when it comes to large-scale
software. No consumer of software in their right mind is going to take on
software planning to maintain it themselves! The ability to get into the
source code simply isn't a draw card for most people -- myself included --
because most people don't have the time or interest to be working on their
tools. They just want to use their tools. If you are buying a hammer, and
you need one with a claw on the back for pulling out nails, you're going to
choose one with a claw on the back for pulling out nails, not one with a
lump of metal that you can configure into a nail-claw or a ball hammer or a
mallet.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem ATM is that you can get  stuck with a closed solution 
&gt; &gt; because they lock you in. If you eliminate this possibility 
&gt; the open 
&gt; &gt; source can compete based on the fact that it is a better solution.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but if you get landed with an open source product which 
&gt; isn't standards compliant at least you can either:
&gt; 
&gt;  (1) Fix it; or
&gt;  (2) Know precisely what it is doing

You can, yes. But for the most part, the users of software don't
particularly want to do either of those things.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We shouldn't need our own lock-in mechanism, we should only need a 
&gt; &gt; level playing field. The ISC/M$ argument is that they shouldn't be 
&gt; &gt; descriminated against.
&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't is a subjective word.

and?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I propose doesn't - mandating open source does. I fail 
&gt; to see why 
&gt; &gt; forcing the government to use software that could well be 
&gt; inferior is 
&gt; &gt; a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; Agree.

So what are you arguing about then? This thread doesn't make sense.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Set up a level playing field and then the benefits of
&gt; &gt; OSS should supply the better solution. If it isn't better 
&gt; what is the 
&gt; &gt; point of using it?
&gt; 
&gt; A bill which mandated that a full, public explanation with 
&gt; public review of all costs and benefits [much like the 
&gt; development process for a category 3 development] and review 
&gt; by an independent technologically savvy board for the use of 
&gt; ANY large proprietary software purchase might satisfy your concerns.
&gt; 
&gt; [if you can understand that paragraph, good on you ;-P]

I can neither understand it nor understand the point of your writing it.

&gt; 
&gt; This is to say, if the Government wants to purchase 1000 
&gt; Apple Mac's and use Aqua [which is not open source], it would need to:
&gt; 
&gt;  1) Gazette what it's about to do
&gt;  2) Wait for a public review
&gt;  3) Wait for a review from an independent board [2 + 3 could 
&gt; be combined]
&gt;  4) Expose all financial details as is practicable to the public
&gt;  5) Then work out what to do

Is this a plan to increase innefficiency and sluggishness in the government?
It would certainly be effective in doing that.
