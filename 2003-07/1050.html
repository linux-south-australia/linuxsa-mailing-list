I can't figure out which thread I hate more.  Evolution vs Creationism 
or BSD vs GPL.

&gt;&gt;You can hardly call it philanthorpy when you're saying, "Sure, use
&gt;&gt;this, but if you carry out certain behaviours you'll be obligated
&gt;&gt;to give some of your stuff back to me."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; GPL says, "if you give this, modified or not, to anyone else you have
&gt; to let them give it to me under the same terms that I gave it to you."
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I've never heard of anyone in a park funded by a philanthropist 
&gt;&gt;being required to share their picnic with the millionaire;  Have
&gt;&gt;you?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've never heard of anyone running Linux being required to give CPU time
&gt; to Linus.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;This is part of the intellectual dishonesty I'm talking about:  GPL
&gt;&gt;proponents claim to be so high-and-mighty about their free gift,
&gt;&gt;but it isn't free and it isn't a gift.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To say it isn't a gift is insulting to the thousands of people who donate
&gt; fine software to the world.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  It is a
&gt; gift because it is given with no expectation of any reward being returned.
&gt; Were _you_ epected to give back anything when you were given Linux?  No,
&gt; of course you weren't.
&gt; 
&gt; To say GPL software isn't free is splitting the most technical of hairs,
&gt; and the BSD licence suffers from that same technicality.  The difference
&gt; isn't that one carries obligations and the other doesn't.  The difference
&gt; is that one requires you to include certain copyright notices and
&gt; liability disclaimers with all copies that you distribute to third
&gt; parties, and the other requires that you distribute the whole licence,
&gt; not just specific parts of it.  Technically the two licences are very,
&gt; very similar.  As I said before, one promotes the welfare of people who
&gt; will use the software; the other promotes the welfare of those who will
&gt; sell to the people who use the software.
&gt; 
&gt; It's intellectually dishonest to claim that GPL is less free than BSD.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;It's guarranteed "free-speech" permanently, even for derived works,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The "even for derived works" bit is what grates.  A developer needs to
&gt;&gt;make a choice between "compelled-speech" (which isn't free!) or no speech
&gt;&gt;at all.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Rubbish!  You aren't compelled to derive your work from a GPLed origin.
&gt; And you aren't excluded from writing a work that is functionally superior
&gt; to a GPLed work.  What you are excluded from doing is taking a GPL work,
&gt; enhancing it, and then redistributing it on different conditions than
&gt; the base work.  GPL forces you to do nothing at all.  It *permits*
&gt; you to do some things, if you so choose.  In fact it permits you to do
&gt; almost anything you like (with GPLed software.)
