Richard,
I noticed in your first email you said they created 'a user called bash
with uid 0'. If this is the case then perhaps the 'root' account has
been renumbered and hence is no longer the true superuser. As far as I
can recall the superuser is determined by the uid of 0 not necessarily
the name of the account.
This would explain the issue below.
Neil.

&gt; &gt; Su to root before you run netstat.  The process name may be
helpful.
&gt;
&gt; I was root.
&gt;
&gt; Strangely enough, it gave me the usual message about not being
root...
&gt; doesn't sound good.

Sounds like netstat has been replaced.
