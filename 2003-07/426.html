Matthew,

&gt; Are you intentionally trying to be an annoying prick David?

The only person who knows won't grace your question with an answer.

&gt; Or is that just how you are?

See above.

&gt; Twice in two days you've been picking
&gt; needlessly at things I've posted or done.  WHat's the issue?  

I can hardly see how pointing out that one should include a disclaimer
if one is going to GPL something is "picking".

&gt; Yes.  Since the DLink PCI card got a rev there hasn't been a cheap PCI
&gt; one available - this has been discussed quite a few times on this very
&gt; list.  Have you missed those?

Getting anything "cheap" is always an issue.

&gt; Tell you what, if you want to be a smartarse about it - you download it
&gt; and see if you can tell.  It's a series of binary objects (a binary
&gt; driver currently) with no documentation.  I'm a competent programmer and
&gt; integrator but without the actual hardware I do find it a tad more
&gt; involved ... Heck, I've only got an honours computer science degree and
&gt; almost 10 years of industry experience, but hell, I must be a moron.

Now that you've elaborated, the problem is obviousl7y 15" in front of the
screen. If the person sitting in front of the screen doesn't have the
hardware to test it then it's NOT the hardware's problem.

I'm not about to make it my problem - I don't particularly care whether it
works or not but it is good there are companies out there who are making
an effort to support the open source community.


&gt; And what?  I thought that people on "linuxsa" would be please about a 
&gt; company saying that YES they were going to support linux on a cheap and 
&gt; useful piece of kit.  I could be wrong.

Yes, you could be. Or you could be not wrong too.
