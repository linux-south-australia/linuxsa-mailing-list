Question Time

OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE

The Hon. IAN GILFILLAN:

   I seek leave to ask the minister representing the Minister for Urban
   Development and Planning a question relating to open source
   software.

Leave granted.

The Hon. IAN GILFILLAN:

   In this morning's Australian, in the IT section, there is a very
   interesting article entitled `Rann's man slams open source.' Rann's
   man in this case is the Minister for Administrative Services, the
   Hon. Jay Weatherill. However, although he got stuck into open
   source, on 28 April in Hansard he is quoted as saying:

     Open source software is a relatively recent phenomenon which is
     gaining more and more attention. For the benefit of the member for
     Unley, I will explain that the difference, of course, is that
     ordinary proprietary software comes with a licensing regime, and
     it means that, once you purchase it, it is impossible to sell or
     pass on to someone else without having to pay a further licence
     fee. Open source software is, in fact, accessible more
     generally. One of the obvious benefits is that, because Microsoft
     has a particular place in the market (as we are well aware), it
     can lead to other organisations -- indeed, both within an
     organisation or other proprietary organisations -- essentially
     establishing a beachhead in the application software market. So,
     it can provide a basis for the increase in competition.

   Further, in July, in the Australian, Mr Weatherill was quoted as
   saying that the government was looking enthusiastically at the
   opportunities presented by the open source movement and was keen to
   introduce it. However, this morning, in a letter signed on behalf of
   the Rann government by administrative services minister Jay
   Weatherill, he was scathing about the quality of open source
   software and stated:

     Our research to date shows that generally open source software is
     not yet seen by the marketplace to be suitable for fundamental
     business functions.

   He goes on to slam it in various ways. The other ally in slamming
   open source software is an organisation called `The Initiative for
   Software Choice'. I believe honourable members have all received a
   letter from this eminent organisation, which happens to be a
   lobbyist organisation that counts both Microsoft and Intel as among
   its financial supporters.

   It is a dramatic change of position on behalf of the Rann
   government, assuming that minister Weatherill is speaking on behalf
   of the government, and it does beg the question of why they should
   have changed their mind so dramatically on this. The article also
   says, which is good <A HREF="news:">news:</A>

      The ISC [the lobby group representing Microsoft and probably
      other significant proprietary members] is fighting an uphill
      battle to keep software preference policies from being passed
      into law. Mr Kramer, speaking on this matter, said that some 70
      such policies were being discussed around the world and even
      three US states -- Oregon, Texas and Delaware -- were considering
      bills.

   Members realise that I have a bill which would in fact promote open
   source software and it is very disappointing to read the report in
   the paper this morning. I ask the minister:

   1. In the time that has passed since 1 July and 14 July what has
      changed the minister's, and presumably the government's, mind about
      the value of open source software?

   2. Is he aware that companies are running software developed right
      here in South Australia, fully competent to contract for government
      orders? One particular company is named Groundhog.

   3. Has there been any pressure or inducement offered to the
      government or the minister in respect of government tendering and
      offering contracts for their software contracts?

The Hon. T.G. ROBERTS (Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation):

   Certainly the member asks a question that is a real live issue and
   one that is uppermost in the minds of some government ministers at
   the moment. The honourable member modestly quoted from the article;
   I understand that he got a mention in the aforementioned article
   from which he quoted. The honourable member is certainly operational
   at a contemporary level within this debate. More information will be
   made available tomorrow. I think the honourable member's bill is
   being discussed tomorrow and fresh information will be made
   available in the debate that will continue the movement of the
   honourable member's bill. But I will refer the question to the
   minister in another place and bring back a reply.
