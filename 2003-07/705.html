&gt; Question Time
&gt;
&gt; OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
&gt;
&gt; The Hon. IAN GILFILLAN:
&gt;
&gt;   I seek leave to ask the minister representing the Minister for Urban
&gt;   Development and Planning a question relating to open source
&gt;   software.
&gt;
&gt; Leave granted.
&gt;
&gt; The Hon. T.G. ROBERTS (Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and 
&gt; Reconciliation):
&gt;
&gt;   Certainly the member asks a question that is a real live issue and
&gt;   one that is uppermost in the minds of some government ministers at
&gt;   the moment. The honourable member modestly quoted from the article;
&gt;   I understand that he got a mention in the aforementioned article
&gt;   from which he quoted. The honourable member is certainly operational
&gt;   at a contemporary level within this debate. More information will be
&gt;   made available tomorrow. I think the honourable member's bill is
&gt;   being discussed tomorrow and fresh information will be made
&gt;   available in the debate that will continue the movement of the
&gt;   honourable member's bill. But I will refer the question to the
&gt;   minister in another place and bring back a reply.
&gt;
This looks like the Deputy Prime Minister answering Questions while the 
Prime Minister was absent. Is that correct?
