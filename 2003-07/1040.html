&gt; You can hardly call it philanthorpy when you're saying, "Sure, use
&gt; this, but if you carry out certain behaviours you'll be obligated
&gt; to give some of your stuff back to me."

GPL says, "if you give this, modified or not, to anyone else you have
to let them give it to me under the same terms that I gave it to you."

&gt; I've never heard of anyone in a park funded by a philanthropist 
&gt; being required to share their picnic with the millionaire;  Have
&gt; you?

I've never heard of anyone running Linux being required to give CPU time
to Linus.

&gt; This is part of the intellectual dishonesty I'm talking about:  GPL
&gt; proponents claim to be so high-and-mighty about their free gift,
&gt; but it isn't free and it isn't a gift.

To say it isn't a gift is insulting to the thousands of people who donate
fine software to the world.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  It is a
gift because it is given with no expectation of any reward being returned.
Were _you_ epected to give back anything when you were given Linux?  No,
of course you weren't.

To say GPL software isn't free is splitting the most technical of hairs,
and the BSD licence suffers from that same technicality.  The difference
isn't that one carries obligations and the other doesn't.  The difference
is that one requires you to include certain copyright notices and
liability disclaimers with all copies that you distribute to third
parties, and the other requires that you distribute the whole licence,
not just specific parts of it.  Technically the two licences are very,
very similar.  As I said before, one promotes the welfare of people who
will use the software; the other promotes the welfare of those who will
sell to the people who use the software.

It's intellectually dishonest to claim that GPL is less free than BSD.


&gt;&gt; It's guarranteed "free-speech" permanently, even for derived works,
&gt;
&gt; The "even for derived works" bit is what grates.  A developer needs to
&gt; make a choice between "compelled-speech" (which isn't free!) or no speech
&gt; at all.

Rubbish!  You aren't compelled to derive your work from a GPLed origin.
And you aren't excluded from writing a work that is functionally superior
to a GPLed work.  What you are excluded from doing is taking a GPL work,
enhancing it, and then redistributing it on different conditions than
the base work.  GPL forces you to do nothing at all.  It *permits*
you to do some things, if you so choose.  In fact it permits you to do
almost anything you like (with GPLed software.)
