&gt; Whilst I have to agree that Safari is a great browser, I still think it
&gt; has a little way to go before it comes up to the level of some other
&gt; browsers...
&gt;
&gt; There's still quite a few little glitches, even in Safari 1.0
&gt;
&gt; I've noticed several layout issues that are apparent in Safari but not in
&gt; other browsers on the MAC such as IE and Mozilla.
&gt;
&gt; But considering that Safari really hasnt been around anywhere near as long
&gt; as some of these others, Apple have done a really great job with it so
&gt; far.
&gt;
&gt; I also love the fact that they include a very easy to use Bug Report
&gt; system so that one can report any bugs or layout issues to Apple.
&gt;
&gt; It seems that Apple is doing such a good job with it that Microsoft has
&gt; decided to stop further development of Internet Explorer for MAC,
&gt; admitting that Safari is a far better browser, or something akin to that.
&gt;
&gt; p.s. I use both Mac's and PC's, when in Windows I choose IE, *nix I choose
&gt; Mozilla, and OS X, I choose Safari.
&gt;
&gt; It'd be great one day to see a port of Safari for Linux/FreeBSD and also
&gt; for Windows. If there was a port of Safari for Windows, I'd definitely use
&gt; it.
&gt;

It's called Konqueror. Both Safari and Konqueror use the same HTML rendering 
engine, the difference between them is just the user interfaces. There are 
still a lot of fixes that Apple have made to the HTML engine that haven't 
made it back to KDE, but all those should be merged by the time KDE 3.2 is 
released.

As far as Windows ports goes, I read that the GPL version of QT is being 
ported to Windows and the KDE libraries are also being ported. Not sure how 
much interest there is in that so it may take some time or get abandoned, who 
knows.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If we're going to get into browser wars I'm going to vote for:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Apple's newly-released Safari. Best damn browser I've ever used. I
&gt; &gt; believe it draws some of its functionality from something in the KDE
&gt; &gt; realms (the details escape me). Where that leaves Apple in regard to
&gt; &gt; releasing the code is an interesting point.
