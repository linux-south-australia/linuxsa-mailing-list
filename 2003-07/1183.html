Quoting Greg 'groggy' Lehey &lt;<A HREF="mailto:grog@lemis.com">grog@lemis.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; A lot of people who say "it's not user friendly" mean "it's not enough
&gt; like Microsoft".  Don't confuse the two.  Once people get beyond the
&gt; stage of rank beginners with computers, the definition of user
&gt; friendliness changes to the advantage of UNIX-like systems.

I don't think that they're mutually exclusive terms. While my mother was quite 
happy with Open Office, and even found some features more usable than Word, it 
didn't take long for her well-meaning friends to come over and install MS-
Office. This was so that they could be more comfortable when helping her out 
with her PC or emailing documents.

In a vacuum, open source definately has the goods where user-friendliness is 
concerned. In a human network, it's still defeated by groupthink and lack of 
adherence to open standards in one of the key areas that makes personal 
computers useful to most people. If there was a open document format as 
uniformly accepted as JPEG (for example) then Open Source would have no 
problems in the perceived 'user friendly' department.

PDF comes close but it's still not the same format that the end user saves 
their document in while they're working on it, keeping it out of the path of 
least resistance - "I have to save as what now? I have trouble just remembering 
how to find the file again when I want to email it!".

Hmm, since PDF allows embedded data, maybe someone can come up with a way of 
saving normal word-processing layout in the PDF file so that it can be edited 
later, or viewed in a standard viewer. For bonus points, it could be done as a  
word macro :)
