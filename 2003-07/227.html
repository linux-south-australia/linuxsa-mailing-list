Ian,

If you had been some sort of dweeb who wouldn't have known an easter egg
from a buffer overrun I wouldn't have wasted my time making a comment.
But you are not that dweeb.

Words are very important, and the first words you use have the most
impact.  When you start by saying, "It's an easter egg," that's what A
disclaimer at the bottom of your message saying that it's not an easter
egg doesn't much change what people remember.  So yes, you said it was
an easter egg, which it wasn't, which you knew, and it was foolish of you
to knowingly confuse people.  I only make such critique because you *do*
know better.

Other than that, thank you, I had a great weekend! :-)

David
