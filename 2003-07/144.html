&gt; Arg... Spam :S
&gt;
&gt; I got this email, looks like David Lloyd also received it... Looks like
&gt; spammers are scavenging the LinuxSA archives?
&gt;
&gt; Is it possible we can have email addresses masked in the archives?

&lt;SPAM Snipped&gt;

But what's to stop a die-hard spammer subscribing to the list and

a. spamming the list
b. grabbing the email addresses of everyone who posts?

The archives are searchable from the web, so they can be found easily by these 
scum and their automated mass email harvesting tools.

I agree the archives should have the addresses removed or masked.  That's 
probably a fair amount of work for the maintainters though. Often messages 
don't just go to the list - there's other recipients as well.  All this makes 
it into the archives and would need to be changed.

I haven't noticed much problem with Spam on LinuxSA however.  I get the 
occasional spam at uni, but not to my subscribed LinuxSA address.  

If it bothers you, set up a second account (www.softhome.net has free 
POP3/SMTP accounts to use) and get all of you mailing lists through that.  
The amount of Spam I get on my two softhome addresses is unbelievable (about 
100 messages/day on each account offering me a bigger dick, free cable tv or 
instant millions for just $5 investment).  I just gave up using them... 
they're free and disposable.

Spam is a problem, but if you're wise to it, you can at least avoid it messing 
up accounts that you use for serious stuff (both work and personal).
