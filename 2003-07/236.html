&gt; According to a report released recently the State has done very well from
&gt; its 9 year contract with EDS.

You mean the report paid for by EDS and conducted by the
South Australian Centre for Economic Studies.  To be fair
EDS was required to fund the report as part of the outsourcing
deal.

Bottom line is that 2002 costs of IT were less than 1996
costs of IT.  By about $2-3m per annum of the contract.
All of these savings came from mainframe and wide-area
network efficiencies -- that is, not PC support or LANs,
etc.

None of these savings were beyond the SA government's own
initiative, but the report made it plain that EDS had the
government backing to apply the necessary bastardry to get
the results, whereas the previous government bodies weren't
so fortunate.

The savings look like small beer to me.  I haven't done the
math but it's likely that they are so small that IT spend
is now a greater proportion of departmental budgets than
before the EDS contract.  Whether that would have happened
anyway is an interesting question.

There's also the question of if the same results could have
been achieved by only outsourcing mainframe and WAN services.

What the report shows magnificently is how to manage the
government and media.
