&gt; &gt; It presently appears that we are heading back to the 50s 
&gt; with public 
&gt; &gt; attitudes to media censorship. Banning films like this 
&gt; means that if 
&gt; &gt; you want to see them, you are forced into breaking 
&gt; copyright law to do 
&gt; &gt; so
&gt; 
&gt; Banning films doesn't force anyone to break copyright laws. 

No, but if you read my sentence, you'd notice that that wasn't what I said
:)

&gt; That's not the point of censorship. The point of censorship 
&gt; is just to stop you from seeing whatever it is that they have 
&gt; censored. They really don't want you to see this material.

And my objection is that I don't think that they should be able to make that
decision for me. I don't intend to make it for anyone else (until I have
children, whereupon I shall ban Disney cartoons). I am quite happy for them
to warn me that I may not like some movie for whatever reason, but I see no
reason for me to respect the decisions that they make for me.

&gt; I guess if you have censorship then there is always going to 
&gt; be an overlap of opinion as to what is acceptable. It's a 
&gt; strange idea really... is mock child sex scene more or less 
&gt; acceptable than any other rape scene, or a murder or torture?

Exactly. Which is one reason why it should be fought. One day, someone's
going to decide that showing something you want to watch is illegal. In the
USA it's worse, particularly when it comes to religion -- some schools ban
teaching about creationism, while others ban teaching about evolution...
Bizzare, but true. If that attitude comes here, it's all over. We will no
longer be allowed to think for ourselves. This David Irving one is perhaps
the most poignant example, because it's rated G, but can't be shown. Surely
the appropriate response is debate and open discussion, not censorship?

&gt; 
&gt; If we really censored out what was unacceptable (according to 
&gt; the law or our "common morals"--whatever they are) then we'd 
&gt; have very little to watch.
&gt; 
&gt; Especially from Hollywood.

Isn't the hypocrisy wonderful? The subjects that Ken Park discusses
(powerfully) are ones that should be discussed in our society. They are
real, and genuine issues, but the discussion is silenced by the censors. The
subjects that most Hollywood movies discuss are of little relevance to
anyone, and don't really need discussing in the first place (ok,
generalisation, but you get the point).
