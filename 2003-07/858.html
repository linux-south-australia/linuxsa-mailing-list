Richard,

&gt; &gt; (which of course leads onto the question, why bother? Just 
&gt; &gt; use Microsoft/SCO etc)
&gt; 
&gt; ... or just "why bother?" ... do you need to prove that it conforms to
&gt; all the standards?

If one were to argue that one should use open standards AS WELL AS open
source then I'd tender that open standards is the more difficult to prove.
I guess that it would be possible to write a protocol handler but still
require a licence to use the protocol but I'm not *sure*.

&gt; &gt; Maybe the Government has more people than simple office 
&gt; &gt; workers and high level managers who don't know or don't want 
&gt; &gt; to know about the source. Maybe the Government employs some 
&gt; &gt; technically competent people...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure they do. But don't they have better things to do than fix
&gt; tools?

The Government are there to serve the people. If the people decide that it
is important that their information is kept in a format that is an open
standard (for whatever reason) then this is a valid thing to do.

Not necessarily any better than any other valid Governmental function.

&gt; OK. I fail to see why anyone needs to prove that something conforms to
&gt; open standards though

Then I'll sell you my "doober-whaccky ACME standards based internet
appliance" which is only compatible with Internet Explorer.

&gt; certainly find the whole maritime union thing entirely irrelevant.

No, it's not. Compulsory unionism is to freedom of choice, as freedom to
discriminate is to postive discrimination. Giving people the freedome to
discriminate does not bode a good outcome...

&gt; If you are disagreeing with his claim that we don't need positive
&gt; discrimination, why not just say that, and argue that case, rather than
&gt; wander all over the dock?

Oh, but I have been ;-)))
