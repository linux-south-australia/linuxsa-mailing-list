Dear All,
    It SUCKS! BADLY! But surprises me not one bit. People told me that
living in Adelaide was like living in a country town in the 1970s, but
Brisbane is like the same country town in the 1950s. No footpaths, no street
lights, no idea. When driving you take your life in your hands, and
Roundabouts.........Don't get me started. The most progressive thing they
have up here are traffic lights, and there are alot of people up here who
are about as bright as the orange one. One of these days they will be
dragged kicking and screaming into the 1960s - that'll show 'em.
    If I didn't have to work here, I wouldn't be here - believe me.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; Read it and weep ;-)

&gt;
&gt;  The Queensland  government is reserving judgement on open-source software
&gt;
&gt;  and maintaining its use of Microsoft technology instead.
&gt;
&gt;  ...
&gt;
&gt;  Microsoft is one of the state's key technology partners following a
&gt;  whole-of-government licensing deal that continues through to the middle
&gt;  of next year.
&gt;
&gt;  "We've saved a lot of money by entering into the Microsoft agreement as
&gt;  well as eliminating licensing risks," Mr Lucas said.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; - - - -
&gt;
&gt; If anyone knows how these whole-of-government regimes works, you will know
&gt; that there's no point in trying to get anything bar the status-quo into a
&gt; department. It's too much of an up-hill battle. Therefore, the idea of
&gt; 'Sure, we aren't against Open Source; departments are free choose it if it
&gt; has merits.' is junk. There may be a handful of instantiations here and
&gt; there, but not hundreds, nor thousands. And the sheer fact that it's such
&gt; an uphill battle will eventually allow those in power to claim 'look, we
&gt; let them decide to select Open Source, and they didn't. Obviously it's
&gt; just not good enough, and there's no demand amongst the departments.'
&gt;
&gt; It's also good to see the Minister state, in effect, 'don't look how much
&gt; we've spent on Microsoft software, look how much of a discount they gave
&gt; us!'
&gt;
&gt; Nauseating. Simply nauseating.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any QLD'ers around? What's your take on all this?
