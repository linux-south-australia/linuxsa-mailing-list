Adam,

I've got one of those Seagates.  My motherboard is an Epox socket 7 with AMD 
K6.  My BIOS has the problem that you describe.  

When I first came across it, I Googled for "large disk" or some such thing 
and discovered that there is a list of points at which BIOSes and OSes have 
difficulty.  In the case of the Barracuda, it falls foul of the 32G barrier - 
actually some combo of C/H/S which comes close to 32G.  

Then I surfed to the Epox site for a BIOS update but they have long since 
stopped updates, same for the AWARD site who sell to motherboard makers.

Eventually Google put me onto a group of sites that specialise in hacking 
BIOSes.  Yes it is possible to patch flashable BIOSes to ignore the C/H/S 
check which causes the problem.  However, it is risky and my particular BIOS 
didn't have a contributed patch on a rather comprehensive database so I 
explored some more mundane options.

The Seagate offers a partial solution in that one of the jumper settings 
limits its size to 32G.  It actually works, my motherboard would talk to it.  
Problem is that it works too well, the remaining disk space is inaccessible 
even to Linux.  You should explore this even if only to confirm or deny that 
these words of wisdom are applicable to your case.

I tried to lie to my BIOS by telling it bogus C/H/S values but that screwed 
both lilo and grub which actually use the BIOS.  It would have been OK if 
these did like Linux does and went direct to the hardware.

I mucked around with raw, large and LBA settings with no luck.

Finally, I told my BIOS to completely ignore the 80G drive, just boot from my 
older 4G which I was going to retain for another OS.  This worked for me.  My 
machine will happily boot from /dev/hda (which contains just MBR and /boot 
elements of Linux) then it mounts partitions from /dev/hdb including the root 
directory - even though the BIOS doesn't know about hdb.  Good 'ol Linux!

Hope this helps,

&gt; Hey all...
&gt;
&gt; I have a Seagate Barracuda 80gb 7200rpm drive. I have a Biostar M6TWG
&gt; motherboard and I am unable to get it to work with my BIOS. I have tried
&gt; every single BIOS upgrade I can find, including those from Biostar's
&gt; website. Do any of you have any alternative methods for repairing this
&gt; problem. I really want to make this work, preferably without having to
&gt; upgrade the PC I want to put it in.
&gt;
&gt; Alternatively, does anyone know where I can purchase an equivalent board
&gt; which has the required support? Or is anyone willing to swap me a Socket
&gt; 370 board with the required support for my existing board?
