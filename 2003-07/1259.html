Mutt

Although I was able to get Mutt to work I just have to figure out how to get 
emacs to wrap at 75 characters. In the meantime, I am using Kmail.

Upgrade to KDE.

I am not surprised this didn't work, SuSE was chucking wobblies with QT as 
well.

Basically I ran this command and received this output:

&gt;FreeBSD# cd /usr/ports/x11/kde3/
&gt;FreeBSD# make install clean
&gt;===&gt;  Configuring for kdepim-3.1.2
&gt;checking for Qt... configure: error: Qt (&gt;= Qt 3.1.0) (library qt-mt) not 
&gt;found. Please check your installation!
&gt;For more details about this problem, look at the end of config.log.
&gt;Make sure that you have compiled Qt with thread support!
&gt;===&gt;  Script "configure" failed unexpectedly.
&gt;      Please report the problem to <A HREF="mailto:kde@FreeBSD.org">kde@FreeBSD.org</A> [maintainer] and attach
&gt;      the "/usr/ports/deskutils/kdepim3/work/kdepim-3.1.2/config.log" 
&gt;including
&gt;      the output of the failure of your make command. Also, it might be a
&gt;      good idea to provide an overview of all packages installed on your
&gt;      system (e.g. an `ls /var/db/pkg`).
&gt;*** Error code 1
&gt;
&gt;Stop in /usr/ports/deskutils/kdepim3.
&gt;*** Error code 1
&gt;Stop in /usr/ports/x11/kde3.

I wrote the maintainer <A HREF="mailto:kde@FreeBSD">kde@FreeBSD</A> and he told me to run:"pkg_info | grep -i 
qt" to find out what version of QT I had. He also said that I may have to add 
packages manually. When I ran the command I got back: qt-3.0.5_5, so I tried 
to do what I did with SuSE, remove the package. I looked in Grog's book and I 
found package_delete, so I tried to remove it and I got this:

&gt;FreeBSD# pkg_delete qt-3.0.5_5
&gt;pkg_delete: package 'qt-3.0.5_5' is required by these other packages
&gt;and may not be deinstalled:
&gt;KSubeditor-0.13.r1
&gt;arts-1.0.4,1
&gt;es-kde-i18n-3.0.4
&gt;kde-3.0.5
&gt;kdebase-3.0.5
&gt;kdegames-3.0.4
&gt;kdegraphics-3.0.4
&gt;kdelibs-3.0.5_1
&gt;kdemultimedia-3.0.4
&gt;kdenetwork-3.0.5
&gt;kdeutils-3.0.4_1
&gt;koffice-1.2,1
&gt;kwatch-2.3.0_1
&gt;mkultra-0.2.1
&gt;qinx-0.4
&gt;qt-bluecurve-theme-0.47

Then I looked up information on forcing the removal of the packages:

FreeBSD# man pkg_delete

     -f      Force removal of the package, even if a dependency is recorded or
             the deinstall or require script fails.

Ok, time to force:

&gt;FreeBSD# pkg_delete -f qt-3.0.5_5
&gt;pkg_delete: package 'qt-3.0.5_5' is required by these other packages
&gt;and may not be deinstalled (but I'll delete it anyway):
&gt;KSubeditor-0.13.r1
&gt;arts-1.0.4,1
&gt;es-kde-i18n-3.0.4
&gt;kde-3.0.5
&gt;kdebase-3.0.5
&gt;kdegames-3.0.4
&gt;kdegraphics-3.0.4
&gt;kdelibs-3.0.5_1
&gt;kdemultimedia-3.0.4
&gt;kdenetwork-3.0.5
&gt;kdeutils-3.0.4_1
&gt;koffice-1.2,1
&gt;kwatch-2.3.0_1
&gt;mkultra-0.2.1
&gt;qinx-0.4
&gt;qt-bluecurve-theme-0.47
&gt;pkg_delete: unable to completely remove directory '/usr/X11R6/plugins'
&gt;pkg_delete: couldn't entirely delete package (perhaps the packing list is
&gt;incorrectly specified?)

There was an error, but I have seen errors like this before and its usually 
not a problem in Linux, so I went back to trying the upgrade:

Hmmmm. Looks like that isn't going to work. I don't know much about compilers. 
I decideed to reinstall QT3.0.5 from the FTP site, and it went smoothly. I 
retried the upgrade same error.

So far, here is what happened:

1. The set up program on the cd showed a message indicating that the 
Xconfiguration failed in the setup screen. I picked the most conservative 
settings, rebooted my machine and copied over my Linux Xf86config file, and 
went with the syntax that looked native to FreeBSD if there was a difference. 
Although I am happy with the resolution, the color is definitely off and the 
graphics are fuzzy.

2. I didn't have an option during setup to choose KDE and its window manager, 
as my default login environment. As a result, I had to go into Linux to use 
my web browser to research and set up KDE as my window manager.

3. Sendmail had a strange sleeping error that has gone away but I don't know 
how

4. After changing my settings to use KDM to log in with, I could not log in at 
all, and was forced to simply shut the machine off. I went back into Linux 
and found a command to let me back in, and then I had to run fsck. After 
that, my printer settings had gone vanilla and I no longer was required to 
supply a root password. (Security Anyone?)

5. I don't know how to add Reiser file sysyem support

6. I can't set up the cups printers because I am not authorized even though I 
am logged into the web page as root. In Netscape it just does a Netscape 7 
search when I press on anything and I get 997000 search results.

7. I am hopeful about the Netware Client but I haven't tried that yet.

8. Samba Client, I have to look up syntax of /etc/fstab entries

9. I have not tried a WineX or cross over office installations.

10. The command I run in Linux to mount the FreeBSD partition does not work. 
My source is Red Hat verified by the LDP:

<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+FreeBSD-5.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+FreeBSD-5.html</A>#ss5.1

11. Mutt's word wrap is not behaving
12. I have no sound, nothing in the book about it, so I will search the web.
