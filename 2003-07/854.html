&gt;Barney,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It's called an acceptance test. If you have a requirement, test that it 
&gt;&gt;is met before accepting the software.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;One could; but if you get landed with an open source product that passes
&gt;an acceptance test but for some subtle reason then fails to live up to
&gt;standards, you have a chance to fix it.
&gt;
&gt;If it's closed source, then there's not much one can do apart from work
&gt;with the closed source creators. Who may want to fix it for you for a
&gt;price or not at all.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;You are missing the point here, yes OS is better in some ways -
&gt;&gt;and these should be taken into account when assessing a bid, _but_ OS
&gt;&gt;should not be a critical requirement, it should be weighted according to
&gt;&gt;the needs you have and how it helps you meet those needs.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe what I'm arguing is that open source is better in general and closed
&gt;source is a total pain. I am sounding like the leader of the FSF ;(
&gt;  
&gt;
I agree with this, but if that is the reason that this bill is being 
introduced, then use those arguments. Don't hide behind arguments that 
say you are trying to level the playing field.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Mandating OSS _is_ descriminatory - so why use the argument that 
&gt;&gt;descrimination needs to be abolished as an argument _for_ it?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For the same reason why there are positive discriminatory laws for women,
&gt;aboriginals, non-whites...and various other minority groups...
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
Just 'cause they exist doesn't make 'em right. It would be a lot better 
if we simply removed the hurdles that cause discrimination, rather than 
reinforcing the divisions through positive discrimination.

Barney
