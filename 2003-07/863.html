Hi

Ok Ok. I have to say something about this :)

* David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dlloyd@microbits.com.au">dlloyd@microbits.com.au</A>&gt; [2003-07-22 16:35]:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just 'cause they exist doesn't make 'em right. It would be a lot better 
&gt; &gt; if we simply removed the hurdles that cause discrimination, rather than 
&gt; &gt; reinforcing the divisions through positive discrimination.
&gt; 
&gt; *hmmm*
&gt; 
&gt; In an ideal world, yes. I don't live in an ideal world. Given half the
&gt; chance, I think the majority of Australians over the past 27 years since
&gt; I've been living here would have either:
&gt; 
&gt;  * deported me
&gt;  * burned me at the stake
&gt;  * sent me to a psychiatric hospital

* No Comment * :)

&gt; 
&gt; ..because of the various minority groups I happen to be a member of.
&gt; 
&gt; Positive discrimination, abomination that it is, is necessary. The tyranny
&gt; of the free masses is not...

BUT. Positive discrimination is applied in recognised cases where a return to the
'ideal' situation would take a long time otherwise. For example, that hallowed
educucatiol institution that I see Microbits vans sniffing around at (is that
you in the van David?), Scotch college. They apparently had approval for postive
discrimination by sex in the junior school a few years back. (they were allowed to
dicriminate against boys) There were supportable reasons for doing it, mostly to
do with the move to co-ed and the existing culture in the school community that
meant that they might never get near 50-50 if they let the old scholars continue
to decide.

I can't see a similar scenario in the open/closed software in governement debate.
Please point it out to me.

The failed bill was never going to get up IMHO because it was asking to set up a
situation like we have now, but reversed. Even if they cared about open source,
who would vote for that? Perhaps the standards compliance approach is better
because it does not hold up either group as better.

Regards,

Michael
