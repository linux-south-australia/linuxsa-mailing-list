Hi all,

Anyone here know much about CB radios? I don't.

I'd like to set one up as a wireless mobile intercom system, with a publicly
accessible (statically located) station and multiple handsets. The publicly
accessible one needs to be dead simple -- press this button to get
attention, and then talk to the voice. If someone needed to hold down a
button to talk, that would also be ok, but less than ideal. I don't want
them to have the ability to change channel, volume, turn it off, or anything
like that. The handsets should also be simple, but simplicity isn't as high
a priority, as they would have regular users who would know not to touch the
other buttons :)

The range would only need to be a few hundred metres, but would have to go
through buildings (three-four stories, multiple brick/stone/besserblock
walls, steel door and window frames, etc). The public station would need to
run on mains power, and the others should be chargable while switched on.
Lastly, we don't want to have to get a license of any sort, and nor do we
want to pay more than $500 or so for 5 nodes. (node seems the wrong word for
this technology...)

The purpose for this system is like a combination intercom/doorbell system
for a residential college. We want visitors to be able to press a button to
get attention, and then immediately be able to talk to some staff member who
can help them. We want the staff member to be able to move freely around the
college, yet remain contactable. We don't need it for regular communications
between staff or residents -- we have an internal phone system for that. We
also don't need to be able to initiate contact with the public station from
the handsets.

Anyway, my questions to those who know stuff (please reply offlist):

1) Can you get equipment that would suit a publicly accessible application
like the above? All the equipment I've seen appears to have a separate
microphone, and would be suited to in-car or on-desk installation for
someone who knows how to use it, but not for J Random Visitor. It would be
possible, I suppose, for us to custom-fabricate an enclosure of sorts,
perhaps even for a handheld device, but it would be better if there was
something like this ready-made.

2) What happens when there's someone else on your channel? We don't really
want to find ourselves being called by couriers every five minutes, but need
to be able to tell if someone's at the publicly accessible station easily
(we're in North Adelaide, so I suspect there'd be likely to be more activity
than you'd find in your average suburb).

3) Has anyone implemented anything like this?

TIA
