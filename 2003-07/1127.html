First make a backup of the file (eg cp /etc/X11/XF86Config
/etc/X11/XF86Config.bak)

I think RH has some utility called Xconfigurator or something, you could
try that.

Otherwise, you could also try deleting the config file, and creating a
new one fromscratch, using xf86config (having made the backup first
ofcourse). After the new one is created, you can start tweaking it, and
maybe even find out what caused the problem to begin with.

Assuming that it is your XF86Config file that is at fault though....

Goodluck,
Daniel.

&gt; I have been running RH 9.0 happily for months, but have struck an
&gt; insurmountable problem for which I'm seeking help in utter
&gt; frustration!
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what I changed, but suddenly (some time ago now) my
&gt; keyboard& mouse stopped working in X.  (At that stage they were a USB
&gt; Logitech wireless keyboard & Mouse-woman mouse, which had been working
&gt; fine for months.)
&gt; 
&gt; The keyboard still works in the shell, but simply beeps at me in X. 
&gt; (As root or me)  After I tweaked the XF86Config, I managed to get the
&gt; mouse working but not the keyboard.  I can't remember the magic words
&gt; to reconfigure XF86config - kudzu doesn't do anything spectacular at
&gt; all. The log of messages doesn't tell me anything meaningful to me,
&gt; but then I'm thick!  I also don't know how to 'export' the XF86config
&gt; file to insert into this email in Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; I've since tried changing the keyboard/mouse dongle to the PS2 port,
&gt; installed a different PS2 mouse & PS2 keyboard & am still getting
&gt; nowhere. The mouse now works, but the keyboard is being stubborn. 
&gt; I've done an'upgrade' to my RH & am too fed up to RFTM any more.  I'm
&gt; badly missing my Linux, but am st....d if I'm going to do what I
&gt; usually do, ie.- reformat& re-install from scratch.  I know I'll get
&gt; into trouble from DSL for not searching archives etc, but I'm sick of
&gt; switching to/from Windows to seach the 'net trying to get RH working. 
&gt; If I only knew how to get to the Internet from the shell I'd be miles
&gt; ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to be a pain, but I feel like a big whinge tonight!  Any
&gt; suggestions greatly appreciated! (pls don't flame me too much!)
&gt;
