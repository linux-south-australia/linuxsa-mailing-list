&gt;Barney,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I understand the example David, what I don't understand is how it
&gt;&gt;relates to the topic at hand. I am talking about putting _greater_
&gt;&gt;restrictions on proprietary solutions so that the opportunity to use
&gt;&gt;anti-competitive behaviour (lock-in software) is removed. What you are
&gt;&gt;describing in your analogy is the current state of play, not what I am
&gt;&gt;proposing.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You're proposing open standards as opposed to open source. If you simply
&gt;promote open standards but do not mandate open source at the same
&gt;time--unless there is a justifiable reason to use a closed source
&gt;solution--then you land in my maritime union example.
&gt;  
&gt;
I don't see why the source must be open. If someone has a better product 
that is closed, why not use it? The problem ATM is that you can get 
stuck with a closed solution because they lock you in. If you eliminate 
this possibility the open source can compete based on the fact that it 
is a better solution. We shouldn't need our own lock-in mechanism, we 
should only need a level playing field. The ISC/M$ argument is that they 
shouldn't be descriminated against. What I propose doesn't - mandating 
open source does. I fail to see why forcing the government to use 
software that could well be inferior is a good thing. Set up a level 
playing field and then the benefits of OSS should supply the better 
solution. If it isn't better what is the point of using it?

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I fail to see why backing up your argument logically is detrimental to 
&gt;&gt;getting your point across.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Because noone wants to hear the truth, especially if it's ugly.
&gt;  
&gt;
The point I am making here is that the democrats state the following 
argument for mandating open source:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Chesterfield-Evans said his legislation - modelled on that of Mr 
Gilfillan - would encourage competition.

"I've linked it to the idea of open market competition," he said. "Under 
the National Competition Policy, governments should follow procedures 
that allow competition."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This argument clearly is invalid in respect to mandating open source - 
you are favouring OSS instead of  closed software. Demanding open 
standards is a much better match for this argument - because it doesn't 
descriminate against closed source, and yet opens the market to competition.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I understand this cynical view of politics, I am also a cynic, but the 
&gt;&gt;fact remains, if you make an argument for doing something, it should 
&gt;&gt;actually achieve your aims - or somebody will rightfully point this out 
&gt;&gt;and use it against you.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Unless you happen to have a better marketing machine than them. Microsoft
&gt;et al have a better marketing machine than us.
&gt;  
&gt;
This changes the argument how?  We don't have the marketing, so we 
should at least make sense.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you are in the minority, ie. you don't have  much political sway -
&gt;&gt;you will need to convince others to support you.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Trust me, 10% of the population can change laws. The Christian Churches,
&gt;in  a country where Christians are becoming more of a minority, still hold
&gt;greater sway than their ostensible per cent of the population should.
&gt;
&gt;[side swipe: it's the CHURCHES who tend to support censorship bills and
&gt;such]
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;If your argument is full of holes, I would suggest you would have less
&gt;&gt;chance than if it wasn't.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Quite likley.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;reasons _easier_ to meet, not harder. Play the game to your advantage -
&gt;&gt;yes. Give your opponents unecessary ammunition to shoot you down with -
&gt;&gt;no.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Feed the stuff to shoot at you and quietly go in via the back door. It's
&gt;highly effective if you can do it right...
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;On top of all this, going by your examples, how is asking for open 
&gt;&gt;source anymore likely to succeed than asking for open-standards? At 
&gt;&gt;least by asking for open standards you aren't taking on those big money 
&gt;&gt;companies head on - they won't be forced to open their code just to be 
&gt;&gt;considered.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;LOL
&gt;
&gt;No, they'll just write the standards...
&gt;  
&gt;
Which, if they are open, can be implemented by whoever wants to do so - 
that is the whole point of the argument. If they are not open, or not 
standard, or not adequate - then don't accept the bid.

Barney.
