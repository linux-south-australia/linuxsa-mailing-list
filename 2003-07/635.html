Hi Ryan,

Like Michael, I'd reccommend looking at your power supply. Just buy a new
high quality one (Enermax tend to be around $100), and be done with it.
Also, check the temperature. You could monitor it with lmsensors, or buy a
digital thermometer and have the users occasionally check it to see if it
ever goes above (say) 50 degrees. Even without doing that, it may be worth
getting them to feel the case to see if it feels warm... The only other
things I can think of are water or even insect/rodent caused damage, or a
faulty cable. They sound unlikely though :)

Hmm... actually, re-reading your post, I can't quite tell if you're saying
that you've replaced the nth drive in a single machine in one month, or if
you've had n separate machines with similar WD drive failures. If they are
separate machines, then that's looking remarkably odd. Are they
geographically close? Likely to be using the same mains power circuit? Any
other machines nearby that haven't failed? Are they all the same model and
age of drive? Any other common components? Weird...

&gt; Subject: [OT] WD Hard Drive Failures?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody remember my post a month or so back about my 13G 
&gt; Western Digital drive randomly failing?
&gt; 
&gt; I must have just replaced the (other people's machines) 7th 
&gt; or 8th Western Digital drive since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Same symptoms as my drive - all of a sudden, something dies 
&gt; on it (controller board? - only way to replace it is to hack 
&gt; off the controller off a simular hard drive, which was 
&gt; available in one instance), and the BIOS no longer will 
&gt; reconise it.  Each person says that before the hard drive 
&gt; died, they were getting blue screens in Windows about not 
&gt; being able to write files properly...
&gt; 
&gt; I've noticed other people reporting that their WD drives have 
&gt; failed recently, too (other posts, some offlist emails I got 
&gt; when I had my problem...)
&gt; 
&gt; This all seems a bit odd...
