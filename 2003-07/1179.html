&gt; That's easy to answer:  We're suppose to be developing FREE software here.

Depends on your definition and view on free.  Again, I think it's somewhere 
where there's a bit of room for different definitions.

The FSF defintion is "The software has freedom and the software's freedom 
can't be removed" (ie. "free/libre" is from the software's point of view)

The BSD (and I guess your view) is that "free" is about people's freedom to 
do what they want with the software (ie. the developers view)

And there are no doubt more definitions which are equally valid, but they 
are all valid views.  They maybe incompatible but they're no less valid and 
I would disagree with anyone saying that one was superior to the other(s).

&gt; The FSF's aim is to develop software which can be used by anyone and fixed
&gt; by anyone and extended by anyone;  It's pretty plain from this discussion
&gt; that they've failed in that aim, because there are types of applications
&gt; which will never be served by FSF software ("Pantone GIMP") and there are
&gt; groups of people who, for one reason or another, find that the GPL is just
&gt; as restrictive as a commercial software license when it comes to fixing
&gt; and extending software.

Indeed, and I won't disagree with you on this point.  However, I see it as a 
plus and a minus.  In this case (GIMP) maybe a dual license or BSD license 
would have allowed it to be taken in ways it can't be under the GPL.

However, on the other hand, maybe it wouldn't be where it is today if it had
been under a different/dual license as I personally feel that the GPL is a
good thing for companies to work under as it prevents their IP be used
against them by their competitors as it ensure that any derived works remain
public.

&gt; I don't mind if you license software in a way which insists that my rights
&gt; to do certain things with it are subordinated.  Just don't call it "Free
&gt; Software" when you do, because it obviously -isn't-, and trying to
&gt; convince the world that you believe strongly in free software when you're
&gt; pulling that kind of trick is hypocritical.

(see above about my view on definitions).  I believe that your view is
valid.  I believe that RMS's views in this case are valid.  I do not
subscribe to your view that only your point of view on what is free 
software is valid.  

I believe that in a perfect world there would be a license that could have 
the benefits of both the BSD and GPL points of view on "free" and that no 
one would abuse the freedoms given, however, we know that in this imperfect 
world this cannot happen.  Which is sad, but is the nature of the world in 
which we all live/work/code.
