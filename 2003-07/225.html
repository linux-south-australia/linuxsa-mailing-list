Interesting interview with EDS on the ABC drive program last night with
Kevin Norton.
 
According to a report released recently the State has done very well from
its 9 year contract with EDS. 

There was some discussion about the length of contracts with EDS saying 
a minimum of 5 years was necessary. Just imagine the state being 
contracted to EDS for 14 yrs ! 

(Says he thinking back to the interview)The Govt has started a review of its IT 
plans/contracts although there is two years to run. 

The Treasury will be looking for cost savings and breaking up the IT contract 
may be considered to that end.

Others may be able to fill in the gaps.

The interview caused me to reflect again about LinuxSA and the discussion a
few weeks ago about Linux in business. We still lack anyone to speak for
us. We are just a disparate group of Admins, users and enthusiasts, without
much likelihood of influencing IT policy. 

What would constitute a representative Linux group in South Australia? I
would suggest some Linux Admins from each Uni, LinuxSA members, Unix users
group members, someone from the Govt and also business representation. It
would need to be headed by someone with some media skills.

The object of the group would be to determine the extent of Linux usage in
public and educational institutions, to coordinate future expansion, offer
expertise to institutions wanting to move to opens source, to provide
leadership in explaining the benefits of Open Source in Govt and business,
to seek funding for a part-time (initially) position to employ someone to 
further these objectives.

Even this may be too late for the current round of negotiations.
