&gt; &gt; This claim is interesting for a couple of reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   1. The scientific theory of evolution does not deal with how the
&gt; &gt;      universe began or how the solar system got here or how the
&gt; &gt;      very first thing that could be called life arose. Those are
&gt; &gt;      the subjects of other areas of study, including abiogenesis.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I guess we could argue definitions here.  We are talking evolution
&gt; aren't we??  Does that not include the evolution of the universe?  Which
&gt; encompasses the big bang theory??  I never said "Charles Darwin's Theory
&gt; of Evolution". 

At best, you have made a category mistake by conflating the two. They use 
different explanations and are only united by the term 'evolution' itself.

At worst, it is an attempt to conflate the two so that one or the other 
can be rejected by applying arguments or conslusions from one area to 
another in an erroneous manner.

In addition, there is good experimental evidence for the big-bang, and 
theories of the evolution of the universe, as far as I am aware, deal with 
events from after the big-bang to current times.
 
&gt; &gt;   2. A number of popular explanations for how things began posit that
&gt; &gt;      one or more gods were involved. These explanations (sometimes
&gt; &gt;      called myths) leave out all the interesting details, which, to 
&gt; &gt;      any sentient entity, is just totally unsatisfactory.
&gt; 
&gt; The point I'm trying to make here is that accepting the "big bang"
&gt; theory is as much a belief as Christianity is, to the extent that it
&gt; relies on the unexplained.  My objection stems from the fact that the
&gt; Big Bang is often used as the scientific answer to the creation of the
&gt; universe when in fact it does not address that question.

Except that there is evidence that the big-bang happened.

&gt; &gt; So, where did this 'creator' come from. Please explain why we must posit a 
&gt; &gt; creator, who was not itself created?
&gt; 
&gt; Well indeed.. I'll ask him when I die :)

But you haven't answered the question. What logical necessity is there to 
multiply entities beyond need?

However, the response was humourous :-)

&gt; &gt; Ahhhh, now I understand. You don't actually know much about the theory of 
&gt; &gt; evolution.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I think that's a bit harsh.  

I am sorry, but when you start referring to 'macroevolution' the way that 
creationists do with no understanding of what the term means in biology, 
then the statement is accurate.

Macroevolution has nothing to do with the appearange of eyes out of 
nothing, or the jump from an amoeba to a human through a number of 
generations. All of that is the accumulation of microevolution.

In addition, the significant amounts of evidence for evolution just has to 
be dealt with.

&gt;                                  Whilst I don't have a degree in the
&gt; matter, I do have a good basic understanding and I have done a
&gt; reasonable amount of my own research into the matter.  I was surprised
&gt; to find how many text books contain "findings" that have since been
&gt; found to be wild speculation and largely unsubstantiated claims.

Please be specific. Peer-reviewed journals submit articles to people who 
just love to rip speculation and unsubstatiated claims to shreds.

Those articles that get through are of high quality.

However, text books that are lower than university level often simplify 
things or contain out-right mistakes.
