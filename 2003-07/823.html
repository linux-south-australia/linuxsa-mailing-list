&gt;&gt;There is always cgiwrap, although it's probably not the most

&gt;Seems absolutely incredible that there doesn't seem to be anything like this
&gt;*for* php, though.   There's many disadvantages to running php as a cgi
&gt;module; including having to put the usual hash bang (#!/usr/local/bin/php) at
&gt;the top of every script.  People don't like doing that.
&gt;

What would be the benefit of integrating it into mod_php though? It 
would probably need to run a seperate process for each user/group's 
security access, defeating the value of any persistant functions and 
making it into a bloated and buggy alternative to cgiwrap.

Do a search for mod_perl + suexec for more information.

There's always PHP with safe mode - I guess you could write an exec'd  
setuid program that would allow users to run arbitrary code with the 
same privileges as the script that called it. Maybe you could go all-out 
and write a generic include file or Pear module that uses that method to 
eval slabs of code in a function call.
