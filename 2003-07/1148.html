&gt; However, the point Mark was making was that he thinks it wouldn't affect any

I think it would affect Linux.  I could forsee, were Linux BSD'ed, that
a company, probably not Microsoft but one like them, would take Linux
and corporatise it.  They'd start by making big aesthetic improvements
to their Linux, perhaps giving back, perhaps not.  Later they'd stop
giving improvements, because that would be their strategic advantage,
and hey, it's all Linux, isn't it, so how does it hurt?

Of course, it would hurt when that company started making incompatible
changes to their Linux.  They'd do that, at their convenience, once
they'd picked up a commanding market share.  Then  we'd have Linux and
Linux, and they wouldn't interoperate, and one would be a lovely, shining
system that 'everybody' uses, and the other would be this old system,
which fewer and fewer developers used as a primary development platform,
and hence fewer and fewer applications would run on.

This happened with gated.
