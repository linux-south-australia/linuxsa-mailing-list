&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Just wondering if there is a simple/quick way to change the identity of my 
&gt; browser to IE version 5.5 ?  Not my choice . ..I'm using Galeon 1.3.3 and 
&gt; Mozilla 1.3 but when I access the Workcover site to complete a reconciliation 
&gt; statement, all I get is a 'Browser unsupported' type of message and 
&gt; directions that I need at least IE 5.5 ...  Grrrrrr. . . . !
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see WorkCover changing their website in the next few hours (today is 
&gt; the last day to complete online reconciliations) so I'm wondering if there is 
&gt; a simple way to change the identity and version number of my installed G / M 
&gt; browsers & thereby complete the reconciliation ? . . . or is this an idea not 
&gt; worth pursuing ?
&gt; 

It is against the law (Disability Dicrimination Act) to have a public
website in Australia that is inaccessible to some. A blind person using
lynx must be able to access it.

Sorry for the pasted unwrapped lines.

2.2 Equal Access is Required by Law

The provision of information and online services through the Worldwide Web is a service covered by the DDA. Equal access for people with a disability in this area is required by the DDA where it can reasonably be provided. This requirement applies to any individual or organisation developing a Worldwide Web page in Australia, or placing or maintaining a Web page on an Australian server. This includes pages developed or maintained for purposes relating to employment; education; provision of services including professional services, banking, insurance or financial services, entertainment or recreation, telecommunications services, public transport services, or government services; sale or rental of real estate; sport; activities of voluntary associations; or administration of Commonwealth laws or programs. All these are areas specifically covered by the DDA.

In addition to these specific areas, provision of any other information or other goods, services or facilities through the Internet is in itself a service, and as such, discrimination in the provision of this service is covered by the DDA. The DDA applies to services whether provided for payment or not.
