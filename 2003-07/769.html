&gt; 
&gt; I am considering setting up a network solution for outback communities
&gt; and perhaps isolated overseas communities that will provide email using
&gt; donated hardware, a local power source (eg solar, hydro) and radio. I
&gt; know it is possible and can currently be done for a price. However I am
&gt; looking at a very cheap solution.


Go to an amateur radio meeting.  See the links page at
<A HREF="http://www.wia.org.au/">http://www.wia.org.au/</A> for Adelaide groups.

This is better than asking in the mailing list as you'll need to drum
up helpers as well as information.  The mailing list you need is
linux-hams.

It's also a good time to talk with the ACA.  They have "band plans"
that allocate spectrum and licensing conditions for various uses of
radio.  You need to know what bands and licensing apply to your
project.

These are likely to be stricter than you expect.  A 5W HF transmitter
can cause world-wide interference, so use of the long-haul HF
frequencies is very tightly controlled.

Your project also partly replicates the work of School of the Air and
Royal Flying Doctor Service, so you should also chat with those
organisations.  People won't regard as cheap an option that involves
the purchase of a second HF transceiver.

Codan and Barrett make most of the HF transceivers used for SOTA and
RFDS.  Their top-end kit offers a e-mail option.  So an alternative
strategy might be to work with manufacturers to get e-mail as
inexpensive option across their HF product range.

In the US, Volunteers in Technical Assistance have already got a
field-deployable HF Internet solution, see "Low-Cost Digital and
Packet Radio Techniques: Operation and Applications" which is a USTTI
training course and a PACT book.  Try and find the person that wrote
these -- you can't write either without learning a lot and making a
lot of contacts.

It's not clear what fixed installation HF Internet is useful for in
the long run if satelite costs keep dropping. You'll need an answer to
that before you get too much further.

Best of luck,
Glen
