&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Well Hi there!

/me nods at Adam and Damien...

&gt; &gt; The separation of Administrator-modified configuration 
&gt; files and the 
&gt; &gt; default
&gt; &gt; files installed by the system makes sense to me. But having 
&gt; it in two totally 
&gt; &gt; different locations doesn't, e.g. "/etc and 
&gt; /usr/local/etc". Forgetting about 
&gt; &gt; Unix history for a moment and stepping outside of the box, 
&gt; if you were to 
&gt; &gt; design the filestructure from scratch, where would you 
&gt; place these two 
&gt; &gt; directories?

Well, really, the config files are there because the programs are there...
ie: /etc refers to programs that are based in / or /usr (that is, /bin and
/usr/bin) -- ie the OS's programs; whereas /usr/local/etc refers to programs
that are based in /usr/local (such as those in /usr/local/bin) ... That
makes sense -- particularly if you want the flexibility of having a shared
/usr/local (or even /usr) over multiple machines (which is common). I guess
it depends whether you think it's important to differentiate between the
OS's files and the additional files...

&gt; 
&gt; Because it's the history of Unix that has held it together as 
&gt; a scalable operating system for so long.

... which is a very good point, but doesn't mean there isn't a better way,
just that the better way is going to have to be significantly better before
it is trusted.

&gt; 
&gt; And it makes logical sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; /etc for your basic system config files that come with your 
&gt; operating system,
&gt; 
&gt; /usr/local/etc for all the additional stuff you've added to 
&gt; the system that doesn't come as part of the underlying model. 
&gt;  'man hier' and look up /usr/local.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that it can be sometimes confusing, for example:
&gt; 
&gt; /etc/named/named.conf
&gt; /usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf
&gt; 
&gt; (Yes -- both services are fundamental to most networks, and 
&gt; while named.conf is a file and a service included with a 
&gt; generic install, dhcpd.conf is not, because it's installed, 
&gt; in freebsd's case, from the ports.

IMHO, as much as possible in FreeBSD's case should be moved to ports. To my
way of thinking, whenever there is a choice of ways of doing something, even
if it's essential to the operating system, it should be in /usr/local... eg
sendmail shouldn't be part of the base install, even though you do need an
MTA for a proper OS. That's just me though... :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So here are my revised goals:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Design a logical directory structure within the /etc directory.
&gt; &gt;    - it must be fairly simple for somebody to look through that 
&gt; &gt; directory to
&gt; &gt; find something without resorting to "locate" or "find".
&gt; 
&gt; How?
&gt; 
&gt; Any sort of mixing together of basic configuration files and 
&gt; configs for additional modules would take away the principles 
&gt; of the logical structure that Unix has today.  The same 
&gt; principle exists right now for /bin and /usr/local/bin.  
&gt; Should we change that aswell?  /bin is for programs that need 
&gt; to be run in multi or single user mode, and /usr/local/bin is 
&gt; used for binaries for added on programs (because that's 
&gt; generally what your /usr partition is for.)

Here's some samples from debian's man hier (re-ordered to suit me...):

       /      This is the root  directory.   This  is  where  the
              whole tree starts.

       /bin   This  directory  contains executable programs which
              are needed in single user mode  and  to  bring  the
              system up or repair it.

       /sbin  Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed  to
              boot the system, but which are usually not executed
              by normal users.

       /etc   Contains configuration files which are local to the
              machine.  Some larger software packages, like  X11,
              can  have  their  own  subdirectories  below  /etc.
              Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or
              in  /usr/etc.  Nevertheless, programs should always
              look for these files in /etc and you may have links
              for these files to /usr/etc.

       /usr   This directory is usually mounted from  a  seperate
              partition.  It should hold only sharable, read-only
              data, so that it can be mounted by various machines
              running Linux.

       /usr/bin
              This is the primary directory for  executable  pro-
              grams.   Most  programs  executed  by  normal users
              which are not needed for booting or  for  repairing
              the  system  and  which  are  not installed locally
              should be placed in this directory.

       /usr/sbin
              This directory contains program binaries for system
              admininstration which are  not  essential  for  the
              boot  process,  for  mounting  /usr,  or for system
              repair.

       /usr/etc
              Site-wide configuration files to be shared  between
              several  machines  may be stored in this directory.
              However, commands  should  always  reference  those
              files  using  the /etc directory.  Links from files
              in /etc should point to the  appropriate  files  in
              /usr/etc.

       /usr/local
              This  is where programs which are local to the site
              typically go.

This is actually quite logical. In practice, it doesn't always work this
way, but in theory, it's good. I note that on my debian box, there is almost
nothing in /usr/local at all (76k, in fact -- and only one file, the rest
directories)... FreeBSD, of course, has a different policy...

Note the stated purpose of most of these distinctions is not so much so that
people can make distinctions between different programs and their
configurations, but so that they can be network mounted, and shared between
multiple machines quite easily. The idea is that you could have a bunch of
different machines with /, /boot, /var and /tmp local, and mount /usr from a
server somewhere. /usr could be read-only, and would have programs installed
(in this case) from the debian repository on it. You could share this
between a number of similar machines. /usr/local is the same, but contains
programs that are not part of the base OS, and instead are compiled locally
by the sysadmin. Again, you would often share this between multiple
machines. /usr/share is even more shareable, as it is read-only and
platform-independant. This means that /etc would hold config for that
machine, and /usr/etc (which is rarely used, and doesn't even exist on my
machine) and /usr/local/etc would hold configs for multiple machines, to
ease administration.

Basically, this whole thing, which is somewhat ugly and complex, is designed
to make life easy for large installations. It's less of an issue now that
there are package managers and large hard drives, but there is some real
sense behind it, and the advantages of this setup need to be fully
understood before changing it... The thing is, that these advantages don't
mean a thing in the home user or even small office setup. When you have 30
servers (or even 30 linux desktops), this system becomes a valuable
management tool. It certainly takes some time to get your head around it,
and perhaps the value of it isn't obvious until you've been in a situation
where it is valuable...

&gt; 
&gt; It is only poor coding by some developers that make things 
&gt; inconsistent, or a user's customized personal preference (for 
&gt; example, some users like to store their applications in 
&gt; completely seperatated directories, including all data, 
&gt; config files and libraries.)

... combined with the fact that different OS's tend to have different
systems. Solaris, Debian, RedHat and FreeBSD are all significantly
different, as James Leone pointed out.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 2. Design a unified configuration file format.
&gt; &gt;   - This format must be simple enough to be easily understood by 
&gt; &gt; somebody
&gt; &gt; without them having to refer to a manual

&lt;snip&gt;

Of course, the reason why things are the way they are is historic. I'm sure
may of these files could be significantly redesigned, with great benefits in
readability. However, the problem would be the legacy -- of software using
the old syntax, of configurations in the old syntax, and of people used to
the old syntax. I, for one, wouldn't want to be using any new syntax for
(say) httpd.conf, unless it was going to be shared by all the Apaches that I
use on different platforms... Some files (eg zone files for named) are
actually part of a protocol standard. These files need to be that way
because that's how they get transported over the internet to many different
OS's...

&gt; &gt;   - All configuration files will have a common extension so 
&gt; they can 
&gt; &gt; easily be
&gt; &gt; seen as such (e.g: .conf).
&gt; 
&gt; There are a few exceptions to this, but you'll probably find 
&gt; that most programs already use a .conf extension, and of 
&gt; those that aren't -- sloppy programming, most likely.

I thought they were easily seen as configuration files because they were in
/etc ...

Also, what happens when you have multiple config files for the same
program... eg cups has mime.types and mime.convs ... I guess you could
rename them all to mime.types.conf etc... but that looks klumsy to me.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; I believe something like this could be done if it is managed in 
&gt; &gt; stages:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1) Discourage hard-coding paths to configuration files so that 
&gt; &gt; configuration
&gt; &gt; files can be placed wherever the user pleases.
&gt; 
&gt; Above, you wanted a logical and consistent system that 
&gt; allowed us to not have to use tools like find and locate.  
&gt; Now you say you want us to be able to put our configuration 
&gt; files anywhere we choose?

I'm not sure I follow what Damien is saying here either...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Application accesses these files through a library "say libetc, or 
&gt; &gt; libconfig".
&gt; 
&gt; So that when we're on a slow link we have to use annoying 
&gt; tools that slow us down.

I think he's talking about when the application wants to read the config
programatically. The link speed woulnd't affect this. You could still use
the same text editor when you are editing them.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3) Create layout file format and sample application that 
&gt; can parse the 
&gt; &gt; etc
&gt; &gt; tree and provide a GUI for config files that have an 
&gt; accompanying layout 
&gt; &gt; file.
&gt; 
&gt; I think Microsoft have tried this a few times, and they got 
&gt; their Registry Editor which is a most friendly application to 
&gt; get your head around, not to mention navigate.

And then there's linuxconf... :)

I think what Damien's suggesting is similar to Regedit, but rather than
using a single binary database, use a structured set of text files in a
human-readable format.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; 4) ???
&gt; 
&gt; ???
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 5) Profit!! :)
&gt; 
&gt; !

It's based on the underpants gnomes' business plan:

<A HREF="http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm">http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm</A>


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Somewhere in those stages the layout of the /etc directory and the 
&gt; &gt; format of
&gt; &gt; the configuration/layout files should be attempted to be 
&gt; made a standard 
&gt; &gt; (LSB) so as to encourage people to follow it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For all those that say "the current system is fine once you 
&gt; know it", 
&gt; &gt; I say
&gt; &gt; how does that make the current system the best possible? 
&gt; How can we make 
&gt; &gt; progress if we stay stationary? (and if you say "if it aint 
&gt; broke don't fix 
&gt; &gt; it", I'm going to scream :) It *IS* broke :)
&gt; 
&gt; Because it is scalable, and it makes logical sense.  Of all 
&gt; of the things you've described, it seems that it's only the 
&gt; application developers who are breaking the rules of where 
&gt; files should belong, and how they are laid out. Maybe you 
&gt; should explain to them the importance of a logical file system?
&gt; 
&gt; I agree to some of what you have said, but certainly not all of it.

I'm with you both!

Perhaps... there are two things going on here. There's the sysadmin's *nix,
and there's the home user and small office *nix... For sysadmins, the
complexity of the config system is an advantage, and worth the price of
learning. For the home user, it's a disavantage, and a PITA.
