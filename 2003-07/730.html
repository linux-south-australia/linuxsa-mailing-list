&gt;&gt;I understand the main difference between Ken Park and other 
&gt;&gt;movies is that real instead of simulated sex is shown.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the OFLC says it was because of "child sexual abuse, actual sex by
&gt; people depicted as minors and sexualised violence."
&gt; 
&gt; If you watched the movie, you'd realise it's not anywhere near as bad as
&gt; that sounds.

just one comment: the media reported that "real sex" bit,
leaving people with the conclusion that it was underage
real sex.  However I believe all the sex was faked (as in most
films) except for the only "real sex" was the guy wanking.
(which is not quite the same thing!)

But more generally, if you can't tell whether the sex was
real or faked, why does it matter which it was?
(isn't that the point of acting?)

Regarding censorship, it's a crock the way it's done now.
I'd rather the violence was cut.

Dave.
