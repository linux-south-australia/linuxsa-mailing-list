&gt; Care to explain?  I can still download BSD-licensed gated source and

Glen example is better than my Ingres example.  Yes, you could download
the BSD gated source and extend it, and then you'd only be a decade
behind the commercial one.  You might even choose to do it, and good
on you.  In the mean time, all those people who've were using (free)
gated before, maybe even contributed bug fixes and other improvements,
now find it no longer really useful.  As standards evolve, it might even
come to the point where they are no longer *allowed* to use the obsolete
gated on an exterior gateway.

Would it have hurt gated to have been released under GPL instead of BSD?
Unlikely.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been developed to the extent that
it otherwise has, but then again, looking at what does get developed and
released freely, I think gated would be functionally the same either way.
The difference is: the BSD gated is now dead; you really have to buy
the commercial one.  A GPL gated would not have died.
