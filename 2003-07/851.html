&gt; &gt; Everytime I come across a 'legacy' application which still requires a

&gt; &gt; those words, but it's true..)
&gt; 
&gt; You silly, twisted boy.  You ought not to be saying such a thing because
&gt; it may be slanderous.  You certainly should not be admitting it in a
&gt; public forum because, if SCO hear about it they almost certainly will
&gt; sue, and you just make their case so much easier.  You can give your
&gt; opinion *if* your customer asks you about SCO, or particularly about
&gt; SCO and their suit against IBM; otherwise you risk losing your first
&gt; born, or worse.

As much as I'd like to say you're flat out wrong, having thought about
it, I probably should clarify exactly what my point was. I'm clearly
expressing opinion here, and being playfully obnoxious - I've never told
anyone that SCO has gone crazy, or that they'll be out of business soon.
And it's obviously NOT true. I don't recommend that anyone take this
angle to convince people to switch to linux. It's about the technology. 

If a client asks me about which direction their IT should take, I
recommend Linux over SCO. It's better technology and it's got a more
stable future *In my opinion as an IT professional*.

There, that ought to do it :-) As to the current state of SCO, I
generally won't comment unless I'm asked - most normal people will just
stare blankly anyhow. Of course I'm sure my previous message will be
interpreted in the spirit in which it was intended, but it's an
interesting subtext that it's easy to forget that LinuxSA isn't just
shooting the breeze with a bunch of Linux folk and say stuff that's
probably better left off list. 

So, anyway, the point of my previous message was that I think there's no
political solution to a technical problem. We're at the coal face here
and I think we should work from that angle.

Cheers,
Chris.

P.S. You 'ave deadded me again. I do not like this game.
