What do you see as the deficiency in the BSD license which doesn't 
allow "... others to benefit from [your] gift"?

Once you've released it under the BSD license, it stays released.  
It's not like a company can suddenly grab it all and restrict it
and tell everyone else they can't have it anymore.

I'd have thought that the benefits to the licensor (author) of code
are more or less the same whether they use a BSD license or a GPL
license:  either way, the code they've written is available for the
world.

The difference is on the side of the licensee, who gets to choose
whether to use software which comes with distribution restrictions (GPL)
or software which doesn't come with distribution restrictions (BSD). 
Note that both types of license don't impose any USE restrictions.

That's why I'm inflicted with insurmountable cynicism whenever I 
hear RMS prattle about "Free-as-in-speech" GPL software.  It's 
free-as-in-speech to use, free-as-in-speech to write, but terribly
expensive to redistribute afterwards.

It's also why I distribute my own software under a BSD license:  I
want it to be as useful as possible for the recipient, and it's likely
to be more useful if it can be incorporated freely into other software
(regardless of that other software's origin or eventual distribution
channel) and redistributed without loading the licensee with
obligations.

FSF propaganda is at least as virulent as Microsoft propaganda.
They're just arguing from diametrically opposite sides of the same
fence, while the rest of us don't really give too much of a damn
either way.
