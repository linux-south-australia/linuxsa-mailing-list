&gt; That's what the salt does - make the hash different for the 
&gt; same password.

I just read in Tannenbaum's Modern Operating Systems (yes, I still have that
from CS III...) that the salt is also used so that an attacker can't
pregenerate a list of likely passwords to check against...

eg: suppose someone made a list of (say) 100,000,000 likely passwords, and
hashed them all using the normal hash. This could take them quite some time
(though less time now than it would have once). They store them in a file or
database, indexed by the hash. Then, if they find unsalted password hashes
somewhere, they can simply look up the hash in their list, and get the
password. When you salt the password, even with a small salt like two
characters, you increase the number of keys that need to be stored by a
factor of 4096. When you use md5 passwords, the salt is 8 characters, and
the increase in salted keyspace is 64^8, rather than 64^2 (4096).


&gt; I think you guys are over thinking the problem.  

hmmm...

&gt; Assume I'm a normal user .. everytime I change my password I 
&gt; have to enter 
&gt; my old one.  So passwd always have the previous old password 
&gt; in clear text.

yes...

&gt; All you need to do is encrypt the old plaintext password with the new 
&gt; password and store that as well.  If you do this and store 
&gt; the OLD hash and 
&gt; salt then you can recurse through the list back to the oldest 
&gt; password 
&gt; you've kept.  Risk is low if you think about it.

so somewhere, there would be a file that stores jbloggs' last ten passwords,
each encrypted using the more recent password as the key? Hmm... possible...
... anyone actually know?
