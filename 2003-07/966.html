What I find strange about these such conversations, is why so many
people think there has to be a specific time of creation? Why cant the
universe have existed for ever, and in a similar way why do people
ponder the edge of the universe, and also that there is a finite amount
of matter in it. 

Ive actually already come to an (uneducated) conclusion here, so I just
thought I'd throw it in. I think this is because since birth everything
tangible to us humans has had a distinct start and end. Every object,
and every nameable period of time. Therefore us humans find the idea
that something does not have a start or and end rather odd. But really,
this seems the simplest explination to me. 

I do belive in the big bang, but rather than the traditional way that
most people seem to think of it - as a one off - I think its a cycle,
and that eventually after everything spreads out gravity starts pulling
it all back together again, an it all eventually sucks in together until
you've got the biggest atomic (or beyond) explosion as every particle of
matter around is crushed under the overwhelming combined gravity of
everything. Then thats another big bang, everything is destroyed, and so
the cycle goes. Ive never studied philosophy or anything related to
this. I've just talked about this in pubs and wandering around drinking
beer, so theres probably plenty of people on this list who can shoot
this theory down, but eh. This mail is too long already, and will be my
only on list one for this subject.
