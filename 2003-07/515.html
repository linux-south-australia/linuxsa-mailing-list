This was interesting too.
"SuSE Linux

On the other end of the spectrum is the latest SuSE Linux 8.2 for AMD 
Athlon 64, the beta of which was released last week and, unlike SuSE's 
ix86 branch, it is freely downloadable. Out of curiosity - are these 64 
bit systems getting deployed? Anybody has any experience with them? 
Most importantly, would you like to see future release announcements 
about them on the front page? Let us know...

"
But why would this distro be so hot? Wonder if anybody in CSDN has a 
copy yet?

"DeLi Linux

One of the more interesting distributions released last week was DeLi 
Linux. Immediately after the announcement on the front page, the page 
hit count on the DeLi Linux page soared spectacularly, approaching 
levels that Mandrake or Red Hat pages get shortly after new releases. 
This makes me wonder - is the old PC a neglected market? How many of us 
have an old computer lying idly in the cupboard? Unfortunately, Red Hat 
9 won't even install on anything with less than 64MB of RAM (double 
that for a graphical install) and many other distributions no longer 
bother with these low-end systems. Has anybody tried DeLi Linux 0.3? 
Any opinions are welcome.
