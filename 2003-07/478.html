&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone here care about censorship? Is anyone here involved in
&gt; actively
&gt; &gt; doing anything about it? Are there any half-decent groups 
&gt; around the 
&gt; &gt; place dedicated to fighting for our freedom of choice in 
&gt; what we see? 
&gt; &gt; Is it
&gt; worth
&gt; &gt; trying to arrange a screening of (say) Ken Park in 
&gt; Adelaide, like the 
&gt; &gt; Free Cinema people attempted in Sydney? Not that I'm 
&gt; prepared to get 
&gt; &gt; arrested like Margaret Pomeranz did...
&gt; 
&gt; Question is, is the film worthy as a movie in itself or was 
&gt; the real sex added as a cheap publicity stunt to 
&gt; (predictably) get the movie wide ranging free publicity?

It varies. Ken Park is definitely worthy as a film, though it's not for
everyone. It perhaps is guilty of having more explicit sex than it needed
to, but what Hollywood movie isn't? In fact, given the subject matter, the
sexually explicit scenes are more essential to this movie than they were to
(say) Titanic...

&gt; 
&gt; My concern is that should this film be successful more 
&gt; directors may push for real intercourse in their features.  
&gt; It may become a race to the bottom to see who can add more 
&gt; nudity/violence/sex/drugs/etc to gain the publicity that 
&gt; follows the making of a movie with the status quo +10%.

But why would that be a concern? If you don't like it, don't see it.
Besides, it's already a race to see who can add more
nudity/violence/sex/drugs/etc in movies, but the mainstream companies do it
in a way that removes the impact from the audience, hence bluntening the
blow of whatever the movie is about. For the most part, the publicity is
generated by the efforts at banning the movie. If there was no effort to ban
Baise Moi or Ken Park, I would probably never have heard about them, let
alone seen them.

&gt; Without seeing it myself I can't judge, but if the movie 
&gt; turns out to be trash the director has already won anyway, as 
&gt; my money would have been spent.  It's a Catch 22.

That's the problem! Most of the people calling for the banning of movies
haven't seen them... While I have no problem with them not seeing them, I
don't see how they can have anything intelligent to say about the value of
such a move without having seen it. Thing is, if it wasn't banned, then you
could read reviews by your favourite reviewer, perhaps watch the trailer,
and make the decision for yourself, just as you do with every other film you
ever see. Sometimes, you'd decide it sucked, and sometimes you'd like it.
But it's your decision. Right now, you can't make that decision for
yourself. You can, however, read reviews...
