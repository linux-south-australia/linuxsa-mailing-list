Hi Trevor,

Yes, a few tips (the two machines will be called A and B, and you are trying
to connect from A to B):

1) use ssh instead -- it's more secure, and more functional.

2) check that rsh/ssh is actually listening on B -- run `netstat -anp --inet
| grep LISTEN` and look for something listening on either the ssh or rsh
port -- it may be that inetd or xinetd are doing the listening, which is ok.
Bear in mind that something listening on localhost (or 127.0.0.1) is not
going to be visible to anything else. You'll need it listening on either
0.0.0.0 or the specific IP you're trying to connect to.

3) if nothing is listening, check /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.d/rsh to
get rsh running, or run `/etc/init.d/ssh start` to get ssh running (all this
is on B). You may need to install ssh (on both machines), and it's quite
possible that the files are in different locations to what I listed.

4) once netstat shows something listening on B, try connecting locally -- do
the same as if you were connecting from A, but on B. Make sure you specify
the external IP address and not localhost though.

5) if that doesn't work, check your iptables/ipchains config on B, and
perhaps your tcp_wrappers (/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny), also on B.

6) if it does work, try from A. If that doesn't work, you may find that A's
iptables/ipchains config is blocking outgoing connections. You may also find
that there is some other network issue. Try pinging from A to B, and then
back the other way.

7) If none of those works, check /var/log/messages and friends on B, and
experiment using verbose options to rsh/ssh on A.

8) If still no joy, send another email with more detail, using plaintext,
not HTML, and with a subject line! :)

HTH
