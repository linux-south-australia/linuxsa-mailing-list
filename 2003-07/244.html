&gt; I wouldn't expect many people to have them, but was wondering if anyone had
&gt; any experience with Billion's gear in general ? cheap and nasty ? anyone
&gt; using their normal DSL modem (without the wireless) ?

Hi,

I have a friend who has a Billion ADSL modem/router.  I can't remember which 
model.  He's pretty happy with it.  The modem crashes occasionally and he 
loses his connection.  Although, as a Windows user he expects that his 
computing equipment should crash regularly.  When it doesn't crash he 
worries.

The DSL modem he has does NAT, DHCP (for the internal machines), etc.  It has 
a webserver built into it for configuration.  The NAT has pinholes that can 
be configured (you're limited to something like 10 holes) so you can accept 
direct connects into your local network too.  NAT can also be turned off and 
it will act as a simple USB/ethernet modem as well.

The main gripe I have with his modem (apart from it crashing) is that the 
ports for the services it runs are available to the outside world and he 
hasn't found a way of disabling that.  I can connect to the modem's web 
server across the Internet.  Admittedly, the webserver is password protected, 
but it is still sort of a security problem.

Adam
