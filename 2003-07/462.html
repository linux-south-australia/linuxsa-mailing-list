While sneaking around The Register site I spotted a story about the 
island of Niue and their efforts to provide a quality Internet service 
to their tiny island/atoll in the Pacific.
<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/69/31411.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/69/31411.html</A>

A full White Paper detailing the island's Internet Network and how they 
are resolving the unique problems of living on a coal atoll can found 
in <A HREF="http://www.nunames.nu/about/Niuepaper2.pdf">http://www.nunames.nu/about/Niuepaper2.pdf</A>
eg. How can you ground your phone network when there isn't an earth 
ground? They are on a coral atoll growing out of the Pacific.

For those working with the problems of distributing Internet and Wi-Fi 
it should be very interesting reading.

In particular I am interested in finding out about this system they are 
building up. Sounds the exact thing I might need for our NTN network.
"
 Also under current development with the first of three
 prototypes under construction is a small solar powered
 completely selfcontained WiFi unit that can be installed in
 virtually any location to fill in dead spots or extend
 service distances. The unit consists of a sealed box
 containing a WiFi access Point that can be run in the
 client, WAP/Client, Bridge, or Peer to Peer Mode, together
 with a small sealed deep cycle battery, and a solar panel
 mounted on the top. Essentially hang it from a coconut tree,
 and it is certainly Coconut Wireless in every sense of the  word!

 THESE SPECIAL SOLAR UNITS, when placed in service, will most
 likely develop into an extremely useful piece of equipment
 that can be used in just about any environment (and
 certainly anywhere in the Pacific) where coverage needs to
 be extended or enhanced. Part of the development procedure
 has been to design and trial units, which can be as cheap
 and reliable, given the hostile conditions of heat, and humidity.
"

Now, who knows anything about this kind of gear? Could I put it on top 
of something tall such as a 100 foot football ground light tower?

Cheers,  Ian
