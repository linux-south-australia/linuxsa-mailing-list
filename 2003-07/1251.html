Hi all,

I've recently started working on a Cobalt Raq550, and am having some
puzzling experiences. When I set up a site, it asks me a whole bunch o'
stuff, about web, mail, and so on. Because I am more familiar with the files
than the GUI, I check what is going on by looking at the relevant files.
However, for some reason, it's not acting in the way I'd expect with regards
to MX records...

Here's the situation:

1) I set up an account for www.domain.com
2) I add domain.com as a web alias, and both domain.com and mail.domain.com
as an email alias. My understanding of these is that it adds the web aliases
to httpd.conf, and the email aliases to the sendmail config as local
hostnames, with virtusertable entries to redirect messages to the
appropriate address. I had hoped it would ifx up the DNS, but it doesn't...

The problem here is the DNS. The zone file looks like this:

...
domain.com.       IN      NS      &lt;other name for server&gt;.

mail.domain.com.  in mx 20 www.domain.com.
mail.domain.com.  in a x.x.x.x
www.domain.com.   in a x.x.x.x
...

Unless I've misunderstood something about zone files here, it would appear
to me that resolving domain.com won't work, and worse, mail to @domain.com
won't work. If I had done this manually, it would look like:

...
domain.com.       IN      NS      &lt;other name for server&gt;.

domain.com.		in mx 20 mail.domain.com.
mail.domain.com.	in a x.x.x.x
domain.com.		in cname www
www.domain.com.	in a x.x.x.x
...

ie the MX record would be for mail.domain.com, and there would be a CNAME
for domain.com.

I've tried to use the GUI to add the extra records as above, trying with "@"
or "" in the hostname field, but it gives an error. I (eventually)
successfully added the following MX record using the GUI:

candyspencer.com.       in mx 20 mail.candyspencer.com.

But I can't add the CNAME (or an equivalent A) because it wants to see a
hostname. I could add it manually, but that seems to defeat the purpose
(which is to allow my client to do this himself without learning about unix
text editing or zone files).

It appears to me as if the cobalt GUI has set apache and sendmail up
correctly, so if I connect to the relevant ports, and send the correct
request, it should work as expected. I just can't get the DNS right while
staying within the bounds of the rules...

Anyone got any relevant experience that they can elinghten me with?

Cheers

rr
