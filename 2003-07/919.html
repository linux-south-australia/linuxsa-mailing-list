&gt;    &gt;  FreeBSD is a different beast from Linux ...
&gt;    &gt;  
&gt;    &gt;  In many ways, FreeBSD is better for commercial organizations wanting to
&gt;    &gt;  build a product that Linux is.
&gt;    &gt;  
&gt;    &gt;  FreeBSD, in a number of ways, is better than Linux. Perhaps the most
&gt;    &gt;  important is that it is not encumbered with the GPL.
&gt; 
&gt; Which exactly is the same reason why Linux is better than FreeBSD :-)
&gt; i.e. one of Linux's main strength is that it *is* encumbered by the GPL.

I didn't finish my thought, and indeed, as you say below, it is a case of 
horses for courses.

&gt; I'm not advocating one over the over, but rather "horses for courses".
&gt; 
&gt; The GPL means that developers wanting their hard efforts to remain an 
&gt; on-going gift to the community have an avenue to achieve that.  But I 
&gt; also recognise that (kernel) developers wanting their code to go into 
&gt; embedded devices may choose to go the BSD route to make it easier for 
&gt; the suits in commerical companies to feel warm and fuzzy.

Oh, I am comfortable with the GPL, as I have worked on a number of GPL'd 
projects. However, I have also had to deal with getting modified GPL'd 
source ready for release, and that is a pain. 

&gt; If I'm developing something myself, I'm more likely to use the GPL, so 
&gt; others can benefit from my gift.  If I'm developing on behalf of a 
&gt; commercial organisation, I might (if I had the choice) use a BSD licence 
&gt; so that the company can build upon my work and not have to release the 
&gt; source[1].
&gt; 
&gt; [1] but even then there's a strong dissentive (from a company's 
&gt; perspective) for source to be released (even if it is "infrastructural" 
&gt; and not where the "value-add" is).  I can't see many companies seeing 
&gt; very much benefit of releasing code under a BSD licence as their 
&gt; competitors could freely use it, enhance it, and keep the enhancements 
&gt; "closed".  A great counter example to my own footnote is Apple's 
&gt; "Darwin", but what about "higher-level" layers of software?

The biggest problems tend to be:

1. Getting the source ready for release
2. Getting approval from within the organization
3. Finding the time to work on non-core activities.

There are changes I have made to FreeBSD, to wit, a recvfile analog to 
sendfile (along with changes to Samba) that will not likely see the light 
of day simply because of the effort involved in getting it ready for 
release.
