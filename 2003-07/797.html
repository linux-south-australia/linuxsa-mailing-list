&gt; Does anyone have experience with using radio (hf, vhf, etc) to send and
&gt; receive email using Opensource software ?
&gt;
&gt; I am considering setting up a network solution for outback communities
&gt; and perhaps isolated overseas communities that will provide email using
&gt; donated hardware, a local power source (eg solar, hydro) and radio. I
&gt; know it is possible and can currently be done for a price. However I am
&gt; looking at a very cheap solution.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has some information, links or experience, please email me.

Hi Shaun,
I hate to poop your party, but if your considering packet radio and HF, 
take it from someone ( and 1000's of other hams) who has been there, don't 
bother! As a licenced Ham, I heve had LOTS of experience with HF packet - 
all bad!
It's VERY s-l-o-w and very unreliable, you will only be frustrated.
HF Packet went out with the covered wagon! it was never successful and has 
all but disappeared from HF frequencies. PACTOR & CLOVER are the good ways 
to go on HF (commercial proprietry protocols as well)
The trouble with these is you need a modem (about $700)

VHF-UHF is a different story, there are many people ham and non ham using 
packet radio over
both UHF CB and amateur allocations. Connecting packet to the internet is 
still a very grey area and i'm still reasonably certain you can't do it 
legally via ham radio.
UHF-CB packet and internet connectivity might be a different story.
Yor local ham radio club will more than likely shun you if your not 
interested in obtaining a licence.
Please feel free to contact me of list for any further info...
Contact the ACA (Australia Communications Authority) for more info 
regarding legalities etc.etc.
Cheers!
