&lt;angry rant&gt;

I don't think much would change really. America bends over and Australia 
kisses its arse. Look at how John Howard bows to pressure from the US. Look 
at how the South Australian government just bowed to the ISC and practically 
denounced Open Source as "crap", or more accurately (and I quote) "[not] 
suitable for fundamental business functions" -- i.e. they are just towing the 
US Corporate lines. Look at the American Pop Culture plastered all over TV 
Sets/Radio Stations and whatever else human eyes/ears manage to go near. Look 
at the US-based multinational corporations setting up shop all over the place 
like a plague -- you can't walk 2 metres without bumping into a McDonalds, 
KFC or Pizza Hut.

Looking at the various bills being introduced there it looks like there's a 
good chance of America becoming (even more of) a police state. This is a 
country where legislation (and politicians) is bought, where money speaks 
louder than *anything* else. A country where elections are rigged, and where 
the media is a mouthpiece for corporate interests -- i.e. to spread fear and 
to induce ridiculous spending sprees. Where legislation is labelled as 
something like PATRIOT, when the true meaning of the legislation is intended 
to fly under the radar.

As I said, considering our spineless politicians and their track record, I 
don't think much will change. We're becoming more like America everyday; 
assimilated into their culture. 

I've already started rehearsing star spangled banner and clutching my chest 
like a true patriot, what about you?

&lt;/angry rant&gt;

&gt;  And American-born historian Dr David Mosler told a Brisbane

&gt;  Australia becoming an American state in the next 50 years.
&gt;
&gt;  The visiting research fellow at Adelaide University, who has
&gt;  lived in Australia since 1971, said the chances would
&gt;  increase significantly in the event of a major Al-Qaeda
