 &gt; 
 &gt; How does that work?
 
&lt;sigh&gt;  We've gone over this before, David:  From the point of view of
the licensor, the end result is more or less the same regardless of which
license they use.  The code is released, it's free, anyone can get it.

Is there something special about the GPL that makes it more likely that
the GPL-licensed .tar.gz archive I release today will continue to be
available on the Internet, whereas the BSD-licensed .tar.gz archive I
release tomorrow will disappear and become unavailable to others?
I claim there isn't.  The "freedom of my own hard work" is unrelated
to the choice of license.

 &gt; &gt; useful to the graphic design industry) and sell the result -- because
 &gt; &gt; the Pantone system is patented, and I wouldn't be able to include source.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Is that a fault with GPL or a criticism of conditions of licensing the
 &gt; Pantone patent?  Would a BSD licence (for GIMP) help?  What about if
 &gt; you didn't quite understand how to do Pantone, and neither did I, but
 &gt; between us we both did; but sadly we didn't know each other?

Of course a BSD license for the GIMP would help -- It'd then permit me to
release "Pantone GIMP" as a binary-only distribution.  

This is so stunningly obvious that it's getting frustrating to talk about
it.  Software vendors have been doing this kind of thing with BSD licensed
code for *DECADES*.  Start at SunOS and work your way forward from there...

As for your challenge about individual knowledge: If neither of us knew
individually how to do Pantone but we both had the skills between us then
we'd still be in a better position than we're in with the GIMP GPL-licensed,
because at least there'd be the POTENTIAL for software which does what
I've described if we ever got together in email to thrash it out.

In the present environment, with the GIMP covered by the GPL, it makes
absolutely no difference whether we know how to do Pantone or not:  We
still can't incorporate it.  Even if it's stunningly obvious to every
single GIMP developer on the planet, it is literally and absolutey 
-impossible- to produce a version of the GIMP which understands Pantone
color separations, because the technology would need to be licensed from
Adobe and they're not going to license it to anyone who intends to release
their proprietary source.

As a result, the GIMP will never do Pantone color separations, and will
remain essentially useless to the graphic design industry, and will never
be a serious competitor to Photoshop.  

Why and how is that a good outcome?

If The GIMP was BSD-licensed, then we'd be able to download exactly the 
same source code we can download now, but we'd *ALSO* have the potential
to go to a commercial software vendor and pay some dollars for a closed-
source "Pantone GIMP".  Surely that's a better outcome by just about 
any metric you'd care to measure it by...?


 &gt; &gt; You own and run a business.  You know how important competitive
 &gt; &gt; advantage is.  I don't understand why you'd have issue with this.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I have no issue with BSD licences.  I was responding to a question about
 &gt; how BSD denies you access to your own gift.  I think, were I contemplating
 &gt; writing free software, I'd do it under a GPL licence rather than a BSD
 &gt; licence.  That would have nothing to do with denying others the right
 &gt; to make money from my work (which we have both agreed they can do under
 &gt; GPL), rather it would be to ensure that I didn't end up having to buy
 &gt; my own work.  See my later comments on Ingres to explain this.

You wouldn't have to buy your own work -- the fact that someone else has
incorporated it into their commercial product doesn't magically make the
original software project you've released inaccessible!

Can we please stop talking along those lines?  It's getting tiresome,
considering that I covered this in my very first email message on the 
subject.  The people who are spending money aren't doing it because
they want access to your own work ('cos they can download that for free),
they're paying their money for someone else's enhancements.

 &gt; &gt; Generally speaking, the only people who really, really care are software
 &gt; &gt; authors who use the GPL to prevent a company from making a buck from
 &gt; &gt; their work
 &gt; 
 &gt; No, I think the ones who mostly care are software authors who are denied
 &gt; access to improvements to their work.

Ahhhh...!  So now it's not *your* gift, and *your* work you're worried 
about.  The selfishness I described a couple of messages ago is coming
out;  You want forced access to *someone else's* work.  It's not your 
gift you care about, it someone else's improvements to it.

Go back and read what you wrote above, and explain to me why I shouldn't
see it as the standard kind of GPL-based intellectual dishonesty which
always plagues these kinds of discussions.

Access to your own work is 100% guaranteed whether you release under the
GPL, BSD, Artistic, or some commercial license.  You don't have to worry
about that;  You wrote the code, you can always decide who can access it
and under what terms.

... but you're interested in *other peoples'* work.  

That's the major reason why developers use the GPL:  They're selfish.
Yet they claim they're making a wonderous, no-strings-attached, *FREE* 
gift to humanity.  Hypocrites.

 &gt; &gt;&gt; The BSD is what you use to
 &gt; &gt;&gt; deny someone else the right to make a buck.
 &gt; &gt; &lt;boggle&gt;  How?
 &gt; 
 &gt; BSD lets someone improve a product such that the original becomes
 &gt; worthless, and deny others the right to make a buck from (or even use)
 &gt; that improved version.
 &gt; Let's take the case of Ingres. 

Ah, yes -- I love this example, it backs up everything I've been talking
about :-)

[ how, pray tell, does releasing a piece of commercial software instantly
  make inferior open-source niche-fillers "worthless"?  Ah, that's right,
  you've acknowledged below that it doesn't. ]

 &gt; It was free, under a BSD licence, and
 &gt; became stale.  Then it became commercialised, refreshed and proprietary.
 &gt; You couldn't do anything with Ingres because, frankly, the BSD version
 &gt; wasn't good enough to compete.  The people who ran with it had what
 &gt; amounted to a free leg up on Oracle, Informix and IBM.  Of course, the
 &gt; Ingres story has a happy ending, being Postgres, but that easily could
 &gt; have been different.

How could it have been different?  You've picked a really bad example
here, David!

The ending wasn't "different" precisely because of what I've been saying
for ages:  The original Ingres source remained available, even though a 
commercial organization picked it up and ran with it.  People who were
interested in extending it took that original source (which, incidentally,
remains available to this day, just in case you want to start another
database project!), and extended it in ways the original authors never
dreamed of.

So we've ended up with a very high quality open source database which
anyone can download, extend, bugfix, etc... *AND* we've ended up with
an opportunity for commercial exploitation, with the inclusion of features
which would never have made it into the open source version if Ingres
hasn't been commercialized.

The state of the software art is richer for that outcome than it would
have been otherwise, wouldn't you agree?

We've seen exactly the same story come and go for 30 years.  SunOS, 
HP-UX, Ultrix and U/Max didn't affect the availability of Berkley's
Net/2 and Net/3 UNIX distributions, did they?  And when Microsoft and
SCO put Berkeley TCP/IP code into their OSs, we don't suddenly stop
using it everywhere else because it has been commercialized, do we? 
The Ingres story you've described is so mundanely routine that I can't
think why you'd even mention it (other than to back up my point --
Thanks! :-)

Just to labor the point a bit more:  The Ingres story turned out the 
way it did because that's the way BSD-licensed software *ALWAYS* 
turns out when it is commercially exploited;  It wasn't some kind of
happy accident.  Commercially-exploited BSD licensed software will,
generally speaking, advance the state-of-the-art of free and non-free
software simply because it exists and provides a target to aim for,
an ideal which the free software world can try to achieve.  I can't
think of an example which -hasn't- turned out the way you've described.

Amazing, isn't it?
