Hmm... 

Maybe a crackdown on the piracy of Microsoft products would gently pursuade 
the home user to make the move to Linux!

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; A lot of people who say "it's not user friendly" mean "it's not enough
&gt;&gt; like Microsoft".  Don't confuse the two.  Once people get beyond the
&gt;&gt; stage of rank beginners with computers, the definition of user
&gt;&gt; friendliness changes to the advantage of UNIX-like systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that they're mutually exclusive terms. While my mother was quite 
&gt; happy with Open Office, and even found some features more usable than Word, it 
&gt; didn't take long for her well-meaning friends to come over and install MS-
&gt; Office. This was so that they could be more comfortable when helping her out 
&gt; with her PC or emailing documents. 
&gt; 
&gt; In a vacuum, open source definately has the goods where user-friendliness is 
&gt; concerned. In a human network, it's still defeated by groupthink and lack of 
&gt; adherence to open standards in one of the key areas that makes personal 
&gt; computers useful to most people. If there was a open document format as 
&gt; uniformly accepted as JPEG (for example) then Open Source would have no 
&gt; problems in the perceived 'user friendly' department. 
&gt; 
&gt; PDF comes close but it's still not the same format that the end user saves 
&gt; their document in while they're working on it, keeping it out of the path of 
&gt; least resistance - "I have to save as what now? I have trouble just remembering 
&gt; how to find the file again when I want to email it!". 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, since PDF allows embedded data, maybe someone can come up with a way of 
&gt; saving normal word-processing layout in the PDF file so that it can be edited 
&gt; later, or viewed in a standard viewer. For bonus points, it could be done as a  
&gt; word macro :)
