Being something of a film geek, this sort of topic is extremely interesting 
to me. A Clockwork Orange, one of Stanley Kubrick's classics, is one of my 
all-time favorite films, along with The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Fight 
Club, The Matrix, Natural Born Killers, The Shining, and numerous other 
films. Strangely enough, the weird ones tend to appeal to me more. I would 
be very interested to hear of people's opinions of the aforementioned films, 
or any others of similar genres or styles. 

I am a strong believer that people should be able to see, read or hear what 
they want to. It promotes responsible decisionmaking, especially amongst 
young adults, and also gives a person a chance to take in everything that is 
made available to them, which places them in the position of being able to 
make an unbiased judgement upon what they have seen, heard or read. 

I have an extremely impressionable younger brother - he is 14 years old, and 
responds extremely well to the influences forced upon him by his peers, by 
social expectations, and especially by the media. I should point out here 
that his peers the social expectations directed at him are basically 
reciprocating the message of the media. Consequently, my brother dresses 
incredibly strangely (I don't quite know how to describe it), speaks in a 
language of colloquialisms, is extremely interested in guns, drugs, alcohol, 
illegal activity, and a variety of other similar things. He can't keep his 
mind off of sex, he smokes regularly, and drinks semi-regularly. His 
favorite film at the moment is 8 Mile, and artists like Eminem, Dr Dre, 
Snoop Dogg, and most recently, 50 Cent feature strongly in his musical 
palette. While I actually quite like some of their music (Eminem has 
improved with his most recent singles), some of their content can be less 
than appropriate, not so much for people his age, but for those who are too 
easily influenced, or take the messages of this and other forms of media too 
seriously. Their somewhat uncontrolled exposure to what could be referred to 
as bad influences has resulted in a generation of youth who are far too 
impressionable, interested in the wrong things, spending time on the wrong 
pursuits and are without almost all the quality of life that myself and many 
of my friends enjoyed at their age. Most of their lives are on a downward 
spiral, and are in urgent need of correction. 

To avoid sounding like an old bloke doing the "back in my days..." speech, I 
should point out that I am 19. There is only 5 years difference between 
myself and my brother and the sociopathic little brats that he "hangs" with. 

While people who are mature enough to interpret and understand what goes 
into their mind (and who are capable of throwing out the bullshit) should 
not be restricted from doing so, the impressionable young people among us 
need to given the right message. The redirection of their attention into 
alternative pursuits, such as sports and other hobbies, or even their own 
education would be far more useful than what many of them waste their time 
on at present. One of the most popular things to do at the moment is to go 
to Rundle Mall, or any of the many shopping malls scattered around the 
suburbs, and just stand around. I cannot imagine anything more 
uninteresting! 

Anyhow, I would be extremely interested in hearing from any others amongst 
you who have something to add to on this issue. Any solutions for 
single-handedly revamping our misdirected youth? 

Thanks for listening...

&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; This is completely off-topic, but i thought some people here may have
&gt; something to say about this, with the common interest in Free Software, and
&gt; often free speech. How do people feel about the recent censorship debate in
&gt; Australia? I'm thinking of three films in particular: "Baise Moi", "Ken
&gt; Park", and David Irving's "The Search for Truth in History". The first two
&gt; were censored by the OFLC mostly for mixing violence and sex (and Ken Park
&gt; depicted underage sex -- using adult actors though). The third (rated G) was
&gt; either banned by a court decision, or pulled from a film festival because of
&gt; pressure and the threat of violence (I'm not sure quite what happened,
&gt; actually), because it is said to promote holocaust-denial and anti-semitic
&gt; views. See <A HREF="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/03/1057179081670.html">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/03/1057179081670.html</A>
&gt; for some info on that movie. I personally have little interest in what David
&gt; Irving has to say -- I've seen his website, and he seems to be something of
&gt; a nutcase. However, given the recent controversy, I now want to see the
&gt; film, so I know what all the fuss was about. 
&gt; 
&gt; Other films that have recently aroused controversy are Romance, Intimacy,
&gt; Salo (which was made in 1975, but recently re-banned) and Lolita (both the
&gt; original and the remake). If we look back into the 70s, there are others too
&gt; (A Clockwork Orange springs to mind). Some go unnoticed, resumably because
&gt; no-one really wanted to see them in the first place. Some, however, were
&gt; planned to be screen at film festivals or special screenings at arthouse
&gt; cinemas. Rarely are these films intended for widespread distribution, and
&gt; they are often not even worth watching (eg Baise Moi and Romance were quite
&gt; forgettable). However, sometimes they are actually quite good (eg Intimacy,
&gt; the original Lolita, and A Clockwork Orange are all worth seeing -- Ken Park
&gt; less so, but it's still a good movie if you're interested in it and don't
&gt; mind being challenged). 
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I ask is because I believe in personal freedom (regarding what we
&gt; choose to say, hear and see, as well as what we do with our software and
&gt; hardware), and I suspect many others on this list do too. It presently
&gt; appears that we are heading back to the 50s with public attitudes to media
&gt; censorship. Banning films like this means that if you want to see them, you
&gt; are forced into breaking copyright law to do so (eg by using KaZaA or
&gt; eDonkey or some other peer-to-peer filesharing network). I don't think
&gt; that's right, particularly as it only hurts the small-time filmmakers who
&gt; have the courage to make something like this, not the truly damaging tripe
&gt; (IMHO) that the mainstream hollywood groups put out. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone here care about censorship? Is anyone here involved in actively
&gt; doing anything about it? Are there any half-decent groups around the place
&gt; dedicated to fighting for our freedom of choice in what we see? Is it worth
&gt; trying to arrange a screening of (say) Ken Park in Adelaide, like the Free
&gt; Cinema people attempted in Sydney? Not that I'm prepared to get arrested
&gt; like Margaret Pomeranz did...
