Hi Sue

Don't know if anyone's said anything yet. Do you use Gnome or KDE? In
KDE it's the .kde directory and Gnome is the .gnome and .gnome2 etc
directories. The .gtk* files don't seem to do much, I looked in
/usr/share/themes/Blue..... and gtkrc only seems to do foreground and
background colours and some widget stuff. You could try renaming these
directories (to something you can restore from later) & restarting X and
the login screen and these directories will be recreated for you.

Lets know how you get on.

&gt; the keyboard just beeps at me when I try to type in X, but works fine in
&gt; the shell.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to copy all of the files from my original home directory
&gt; across, or even better, find out which file in it is causing the problem
&gt; so that I can revert to using the original ID
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone suggest which directory/file I should investigate pls?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
