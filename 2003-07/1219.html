&gt; &gt; &gt; gated is the obvious example.

&gt; Kim Hawtin continued:
&gt; &gt; maybe another example is Smoothwall.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; version 1 was GPL version 2+ will be fully close.

&gt; ... which would mean that it's GPL licensing and not BSD 
&gt; licensing, which would make it irrelevant to Mark Newton's
&gt; original challenge.

if you look at this as a GPL bashing fest, but my point is
that its the person or group who manage a software project
that make the differnce in this case.

the project manager in this case wants to entirely close the
project and make a fortune from it.

the issue is control and financial greed so to speak.

if the project had have been licenced under a BSD
style licence it would have been a bit more stright
forward, i agree, but the Smoothwall project built itself
from GPL componemts, to leverage itseld in the markey place.
not in the GPL or OSS community.

The manager now wants to make scads of money and wants 
to close out the competition. but at the expense of the 
programmers who have given loads of their time for no 
reward. hw still wants all the programmers to contribute 
to his project, still without reward...
