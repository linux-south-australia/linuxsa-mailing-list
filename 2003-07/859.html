&gt;And practically speaking, how are you going to prove that a large open

&gt;other programs? It's pretty much the same in practice. All this bullshit
&gt;about you can fix it yourself is unrealistic when it comes to large-scale
&gt;software. No consumer of software in their right mind is going to take on
&gt;software planning to maintain it themselves! The ability to get into the
&gt;source code simply isn't a draw card for most people -- myself included --
&gt;because most people don't have the time or interest to be working on their
&gt;tools. 
&gt;

Who says you need to fix it yourself to benefit from being able to see 
how it works?

If I make yet another analogy &lt;fx: groan from the audience&gt; a closed 
source car would have a locked bonnet, and when it leaks oil on your 
driveway, you take it back to the manufacturer and they charge you for 
parts + labour to fix it. They charge twice as much as the mechanic down 
the street, because only they have the right keys to open the bonnet.

With the open source car, you can lift the bonnet and see exactly which 
gasket is leaking, or that the supplier forgot to put the oil cap on 
altogether. Not being a car person you take it back to where you got it 
from, where they fix it for free and promise it will never happen again.

With a closed source software model, bugs and faults can be attributed 
to user error, solar winds or bad feng shui without the supplier being 
held accountable. If the source is available, it can be reviewed by 
someone who can keep the supplier honest. If it's available as open 
source, then the reviewer doesn't have to sign any NDA's, and the 
supplier can't claim a conflict of interest or stall the review process.

With the issues of tainting raised by the SCO case, I wonder if any 
(competent && sane) programmer would even agree to sign an NDA to look 
at closed source related to their area of experience. This in turn may 
limit the value of non-free 'source available' policies, since less 
competent programmers may be used for review.
