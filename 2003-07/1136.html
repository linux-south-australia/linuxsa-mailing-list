All,

So what we're saying here is that your GPL code is a free gift to be used by
everyone, and added to by anyone who wants to give their additions away,
whereas your BSD code is a free gift to be used by everyone, and added to by
anyone, whether they give their additions away or not. Forks from GPL code
will always remain freely usable by anyone, whereas forks from BSD code
could be restricted in whatever way the forker wants. Because the Berkley
License is freer in the first instance, it's possible that restricted code
could be built from it, whereas because the GPL is more restrictive in the
first instance, it's guaranteed that any code built from it will remain
equally free (and equally restricted). The GPL is inherently viral (in that
you ask for equal access to improvements in return for access to your
existing codebase), and the Berkley License is inherently generous (in that
you don't ask anything in return for access to your existing codebase).

It seems that the GPL is part of an idealogical war against proprietry
software, and the Berkley License is about making free software. There are
coherent arguments (which may or may not have been expounded coherently on
this forum) for and against each. A developer who wants to see something in
return for effort that is given away, would lean towards the GPL, whereas a
developer who wanted to write software that was used by many, regardless of
how they use it, would lean towards the Berkley License.

It would also appear to me that BSD software could be relicensed under the
GPL, but not vice versa. I believe it could be possible to take the entire
FreeBSD 5 tree, relicense it under the GPL and call it GnuBSD. Any
contributions made to GnuBSD would not be able to be used in FreeBSD (unless
the contributor agreed to license their contributions under the Berkley
License), but any contributions made to FreeBSD would be able to be used in
GnuBSD. Effectively, GnuBSD would be, in many respects, identical to a
commercial, proprietry offshoot of FreeBSD (like Mac OS X), at least from
the point of view of the FreeBSD folk. I have no doubt that Mr Newton will
correct me vociferously if I'm wrong here :)
