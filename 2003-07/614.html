&gt; &gt;  "Though Microsoft underbid IBM and SuSE by $11.9 million in
&gt; &gt;  Munich, city officials were concerned about the
&gt; &gt;  unpredictable long-run cost of Microsoft upgrades..."
&gt; 
&gt; No disagreement there.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  "Microsoft's philosophy is to change our software every five
&gt; &gt;  years," Strobl says. "With open-source, it is possible for
&gt; &gt;  us to make our own decision as to when to change our
&gt; &gt;  software."
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;devils advocate mode&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Is this really true?  

i think so. maybe less, every 36 months.

&gt; Although the cost of PAYING for the software isn't as 
&gt; great and although the POTENTIAL exists for people to 
&gt; maintain a particular release of OSS beyond the original 
&gt; develops, I'd put forward that OSS often leads to 
&gt; upgrading MORE often because developers only ever 
&gt; work on the latest or near latest release to fix 
&gt; bugs or introduce new features.  

i dont run bleeding edge OSS software. i would rather not use these
funky new buggy features if i don;t have to and run older software
that works.
 
&gt; &lt;/devils advocate mode&gt;

we have three development servers that were built about
three years ago. they are running redhat 6.x.

we have not upraged any software, save security fixes
in that time.

now, we need to upgrade the hardware. we will move the 
uw-scsi disks into a new server with faster cpus, more
memory and add more disks. and power it up and keep going.

as these machines are only compile servers, this really isn't
a problem. even our other servers run samba, web server, mail,
ldap are in the same arena. 

the features on these services dont really change that often 
and appart from the fact that we are hitting the end of life
of the hardware doent mean we need to upgrade the software...

we are not a common business model, but our actual software 
requirements haven't really changed in four years. we do
specialised/embedded software development... but we still are
on the pace.

there is a point that business will need to update their
software and hardware. but more often than not, most don't
really need to, if it works in the first place.

and thats the point really. if it worked, there wouldn't be
much need to upgrade... if all the relases maintained 
file version compatibility there would be the need to upgrade
all the other old licences either.

cheers,

Kim
