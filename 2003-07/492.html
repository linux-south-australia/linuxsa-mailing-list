&gt; I understand the main difference between Ken Park and other 
&gt; movies is that real instead of simulated sex is shown.

Well, the OFLC says it was because of "child sexual abuse, actual sex by
people depicted as minors and sexualised violence."

If you watched the movie, you'd realise it's not anywhere near as bad as
that sounds.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; If I don't like it I can refuse to see it, true, but my 
&gt; original email eluded to the fact that other directors could 
&gt; chase the easy money (nothing is easier or cheaper to do than 
&gt; sex) instead of making plot driven, well acted, thought 
&gt; provoking movies.  It may leave few movies worth watching.  I 

Heh, sure. Do you not think that there is demand for good, plot-driven, well
acted, thought provoking movies? Do you not think that there are many
actors, directors and studios who *want* to make such movies? The sex movie
market already exists, and it hasn't destroyed the real movie market,
despite it being profitable.

&gt; shudder to think action movies may be heading towards 
&gt; Charlie's Angels II quality for example, especially with the 
&gt; proliferation of cheap CGI.

That's a concern I share, but I don't think censorship of CGI is the
appropriate response.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt;yourself. You can, however, read reviews...
&gt; 
&gt; Reviews aren't a problem as the Internet is littered with 
&gt; both personal and professional reviews for Ken Park.

Yes.

&gt; 
&gt; The only reason why this movie was banned is because of the 
&gt; real sex.  It ceases to be a movie fit for cinemas and 

Well, that reason along with other reasons....

&gt; becomes pornography sold at sex shops.  Overall this 

No, it doesn't. It ceases to be a movie that you can make a choice about,
because legally, you can't get see it anywhere. It's also *not* pornography.

&gt; shouldn't be a debate about one movie that will probably be 
&gt; forgotten next year, but a broader look at whether real 
&gt; versus simulated should be allowed in cinemas, and what age 
&gt; groups should be allowed to view it.  What do I think of 
&gt; that?  Well, I hope we don't end up turning the local Greater 
&gt; Union into a porn flick theatre.

Yes, that's the debate we're really talking about here. However, the fact is
that movies with that high impact are never going to be mainstream. They are
never going to change the Hollywood format. They will get played at the
Nova, Palace, and maybe in a small screen at a Megaplex. Why? People vote
with their dollars, and people like low-impact films, ones that don't
challenge them. No-one wants to force films like this on anyone, we just
want to be able to make our own decisions legally.
