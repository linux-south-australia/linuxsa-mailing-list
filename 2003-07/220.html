&gt; O mighty gurus of the arcane mail systems, any ideas on this one?

I'm not that mighty, nor am I a guru, and [E]SMTP is not that arcane, but
this might be an idea... For the sake of sheer fun, I'll put comments
throughout the headers...


&gt; Return-Path: &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ilox@pacbell.net">ilox@pacbell.net</A>&gt;

I assume this is one of your addresses? Doesn't neccessarily mean that it
came from that account -- this could have been spoofed...

&gt; Delivered-To: <A HREF="mailto:ilox@airnet.com.au">ilox@airnet.com.au</A>

This is added when the mail is delivered to your mailbox.

&gt; Received: (qmail 2652 invoked from network); 7 Jul 2003 02:33:12 -0000
&gt; Received: from mta02bw.bigpond.com (144.135.24.138)
&gt;   by mail.airnet.com.au with SMTP; 7 Jul 2003 02:33:12 -0000

The above two lines were added by mail.airnet.com.au when it received the
message from bigpond...

&gt; Received: from My Computer ([144.135.24.69]) by 
&gt; mta02bw.email.bigpond.com  (iPlanet Messaging Server 5.2 
&gt; HotFix 1.14 (built Mar 18 2003))  with SMTP id 
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:0HHM007KOUZNSB@mta02bw.email.bigpond.com">0HHM007KOUZNSB@mta02bw.email.bigpond.com</A>&gt; for  
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:ilox@airnet.com.au">ilox@airnet.com.au</A>; Mon, 07 Jul 2003 12:31:23 +1000 (EST)

The above line (it's all one line) was added by a bigpond server when it
recieved the message from another bigpond server (which appears to be
calling itself My Computer, which seems somewhat odd).

&gt; Received: from cpe-144-137-199-162.sa.bigpond.net.au 
&gt; ([144.137.199.162])  by bwmam01bpa.bigpond.com(MAM REL_3_3_2c 
&gt; 8/11184621); Mon,  07 Jul 2003 12:31:02 +0000

Here's where we see where the message actually came from.
cpe-144-137-199-162.sa.bigpond.net.au is probably an SA bigpond dialup
account. At 12:31:02 +0000 (which is the time that the server recorded -- it
appears to be running with GMT time set to local time, which indicates to me
that it's probably an MS machine), this dialup account sent the mail...
So... if someone was connected to bigpond at that time, and is subscribed to
this list, and they can check to see what their IP address was at that point
in time, then they may discover that it was actually them...

&gt; Date-warning: Date header was inserted by mta02bw.email.bigpond.com

These two lines were added in transit, because the sender's email client
didn't add them.

All this is usually added by the MUA, and below is the message, which is
inexplicably cut short. Then again, if one were to view the actual content
of the message in the mailbox, one may find that it's not actually cut
short, but has malformed MIME, which confused either the MUA or the IMAP/Pop
server... Still, it does look remarkably as if it intentionally stops
mid-word...
