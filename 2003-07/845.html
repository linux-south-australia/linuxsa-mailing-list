&gt;Barney,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't see why the source must be open. If someone has a better product
&gt;&gt;that is closed, why not use it?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Because how can you prove that a closed source program conforms to all the
&gt;standards, doesn't act differently to other programs? And what happens if
&gt;it ACCIDENTALLY doesn't conform but the company making it just goes
&gt;"You'll have to wait until the next release."
&gt;  
&gt;
It's called an acceptance test. If you have a requirement, test that it 
is met before accepting the software.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The problem ATM is that you can get  stuck with a closed solution
&gt;&gt;because they lock you in. If you eliminate this possibility the open
&gt;&gt;source can compete based on the fact that it is a better solution.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, but if you get landed with an open source product which isn't
&gt;standards compliant at least you can either:
&gt;
&gt; (1) Fix it; or
&gt; (2) Know precisely what it is doing
&gt;  
&gt;
If it is mandated that it conforms to the standard, then how will you 
get landed with one that doesn't? If you accept something that doesn't 
do what you asked for, you are a fool. You are missing the point here, 
yes OS is better in some ways - and these should be taken into account 
when assessing a bid, _but_ OS should not be a critical requirement, it 
should be weighted according to the needs you have and how it helps you 
meet those needs. (maintenance, future improvement etc.)

&gt;&gt;We shouldn't need our own lock-in mechanism, we should only need a
&gt;&gt;level playing field. The ISC/M$ argument is that they 
&gt;&gt;shouldn't be descriminated against.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Shouldn't is a subjective word.
&gt;
English is a subjective language. What has that got to do with anything? 
Mandating OSS _is_ descriminatory - so why use the argument that 
descrimination needs to be abolished as an argument _for_ it?

&gt;&gt;What I propose doesn't - mandating open source does. I fail to see
&gt;&gt;why forcing the government to use software that could well be inferior
&gt;&gt;is a good thing.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Agree.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Set up a level playing field and then the benefits of
&gt;&gt;OSS should supply the better solution. If it isn't better what is the
&gt;&gt;point of using it?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A bill which mandated that a full, public explanation with public review
&gt;of all costs and benefits [much like the development process for a
&gt;category 3 development] and review by an independent technologically savvy
&gt;board for the use of ANY large proprietary software purchase might satisfy
&gt;your concerns.
&gt;  
&gt;
why only for proprietary purchases? It should always be able to justify 
any purchasing decision.

&gt;[if you can understand that paragraph, good on you ;-P]
&gt;
&gt;This is to say, if the Government wants to purchase 1000 Apple Mac's and
&gt;use Aqua [which is not open source], it would need to:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Gazette what it's about to do
&gt; 2) Wait for a public review
&gt; 3) Wait for a review from an independent board [2 + 3 could be combined]
&gt; 4) Expose all financial details as is practicable to the public
&gt; 5) Then work out what to do
&gt;
&gt;;-)
&gt;
&gt;Difficult, but possible.
