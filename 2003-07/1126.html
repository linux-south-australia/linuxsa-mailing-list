I have been running RH 9.0 happily for months, but have struck an
insurmountable problem for which I'm seeking help in utter frustration!

I don't know what I changed, but suddenly (some time ago now) my keyboard
& mouse stopped working in X.  (At that stage they were a USB Logitech
wireless keyboard & Mouse-woman mouse, which had been working fine for
months.)

The keyboard still works in the shell, but simply beeps at me in X.  (As
root or me)  After I tweaked the XF86Config, I managed to get the mouse
working but not the keyboard.  I can't remember the magic words to
reconfigure XF86config - kudzu doesn't do anything spectacular at all. 
The log of messages doesn't tell me anything meaningful to me, but then
I'm thick!  I also don't know how to 'export' the XF86config file to
insert into this email in Windows.

I've since tried changing the keyboard/mouse dongle to the PS2 port,
installed a different PS2 mouse & PS2 keyboard & am still getting nowhere.
The mouse now works, but the keyboard is being stubborn.  I've done an
'upgrade' to my RH & am too fed up to RFTM any more.  I'm badly missing my
Linux, but am st....d if I'm going to do what I usually do, ie.- reformat
& re-install from scratch.  I know I'll get into trouble from DSL for not
searching archives etc, but I'm sick of switching to/from Windows to seach
the 'net trying to get RH working.  If I only knew how to get to the
Internet from the shell I'd be miles ahead.

Sorry to be a pain, but I feel like a big whinge tonight!  Any suggestions
greatly appreciated! (pls don't flame me too much!)

Sue
