&gt;This whole SCO business is an example of how linux is becoming a bigger and
&gt;bigger target for attacks by bad people as it becomes more popular.
&gt;This is why it would be best to keep linux adoption under 5%.
&gt;Otherwise I foresee a progressive deterioration of linux "freedom".

yes your right.  and SCO is hoping for a cash cow.

&gt;Remember that the mammals survived until about 62 million years ago
&gt;by being too small to be worth eating by the dinosaurs.
&gt;The advantage of being small is that no one wants to eat you.

I find it interesting that evolution is taken as fact when it's quite the
reverse.  it's a theory with a lot of holes....   but that's an entire
different issue.  :)

interesting reading at:

&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't be surprised at all if during the next year or two there will
&gt;be attacks against all kinds of hardware and protocol support in linux
&gt;on the basis of "sleeping patents". Remember that there are bad people
&gt;out there with dodgy patent portfolios out there who are looking for small
&gt;fry to toast first so as to get together a fighting fund to toast bigger
fry.
&gt;Nowadays, even if you invent something yourself and implement it yourself
&gt;from scratch, you can still find 10 years later that someone else "owns"
&gt;your invention and you have to pay a licence for freely distributing your
&gt;own invention. Until IP law is cured of its current pathologies, linux and
&gt;other open source should keep their collective heads down. Why bite the
&gt;dinosaurs where it hurts while they're leaving us alone? Learn from SBS TV
&gt;and keep below 5% - then we can do what we like!
&gt;Open source should try to survive, not "prevail" [1].

like MP3 you mean?  it makes sense from their perspective.  now the whole
world is using MP3, the inventors change the license to include a very small
fee.  i think it's very clever.  even if only the hardware manufacturers
have to pay the fee, they'd be raking it in methinks....
