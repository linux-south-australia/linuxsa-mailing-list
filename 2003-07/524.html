&gt; Hahaha - it looks like somebody making up complete utter bullshit, using
&gt; buzzwords and misunderstood technologies to make themselves sound smarter. 
&gt; Ignore it.  They're trying to apply analog techniques to data; doesn't work as
&gt; far as I'm aware (perhaps somebody like Ant who knows their radio stuff [I
&gt; don't] can elaborate?).

It sounds a bit odd to me. Digital is usually encrypted rather than
scrambled! The days of analogue encryption are over. Desktop computers
are typically fast enough to brute force the algorithms[1]. Plus, where
do you plug a scrambler in to a wireless card? Its not like they have an
audio line in or out on them! 

You certainly can encrypt the data with software over the wireless link
though, if your looking for tighter security. I used FreeSWAN once, but
I think it might be a bit out of date these days not sure if there is a
more prefered way.

Ant

[1] Heres an example for one scrambled Australian analogue system thats
soon to be replaced with digital.

The system was never cracked, but if you read the docs you'll see they
are just using about 800mhz of pc power to brute force it.
