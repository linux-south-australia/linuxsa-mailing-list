Whilst I havent seen the film (a decent screening of the film would be 
ex), there is no real debate that adding a bit of contentious sex and 
violence to a film has been an effective way for directors to get 
attention for their films, however an interesting question is, can 
australian national cinema be considered art if it repeatedly sinks to 
cheap porno tactics? and is Ken Parks use of sex appropraite to the 
context of the story and not just porn?

It is definatly a pity that any film could be censored, thus preventing 
many film goers (as apposed to internet regulars)  from making up their 
own mind, and being more well rounded human beings for the experience. 
After all isnt that one of the benefits of art?

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Question is, is the film worthy as a movie in itself or was
&gt;&gt;&gt;the real sex added as a cheap publicity stunt to
&gt;&gt;&gt;(predictably) get the movie wide ranging free publicity?
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It varies. Ken Park is definitely worthy as a film, though it's not for
&gt;&gt;everyone. It perhaps is guilty of having more explicit sex than it needed
&gt;&gt;to, but what Hollywood movie isn't? In fact, given the subject matter, the
&gt;&gt;sexually explicit scenes are more essential to this movie than they were to
&gt;&gt;(say) Titanic...
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I understand the main difference between Ken Park and other movies is that
&gt;real instead of simulated sex is shown.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;My concern is that should this film be successful more
&gt;&gt;&gt;directors may push for real intercourse in their features.
&gt;&gt;&gt;It may become a race to the bottom to see who can add more
&gt;&gt;&gt;nudity/violence/sex/drugs/etc to gain the publicity that
&gt;&gt;&gt;follows the making of a movie with the status quo +10%.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But why would that be a concern? If you don't like it, don't see it.
&gt;&gt;Besides, it's already a race to see who can add more
&gt;&gt;nudity/violence/sex/drugs/etc in movies, but the mainstream companies do it
&gt;&gt;in a way that removes the impact from the audience, hence bluntening the
&gt;&gt;blow of whatever the movie is about. For the most part, the publicity is
&gt;&gt;generated by the efforts at banning the movie. If there was no effort to
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;ban
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Baise Moi or Ken Park, I would probably never have heard about them, let
&gt;&gt;alone seen them.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If I don't like it I can refuse to see it, true, but my original email
&gt;eluded to the fact that other directors could chase the easy money (nothing
&gt;is easier or cheaper to do than sex) instead of making plot driven, well
&gt;acted, thought provoking movies.  It may leave few movies worth watching.  I
&gt;shudder to think action movies may be heading towards Charlie's Angels II
&gt;quality for example, especially with the proliferation of cheap CGI.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Without seeing it myself I can't judge, but if the movie
&gt;&gt;&gt;turns out to be trash the director has already won anyway, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;my money would have been spent.  It's a Catch 22.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's the problem! Most of the people calling for the banning of movies
&gt;&gt;haven't seen them... While I have no problem with them not seeing them, I
&gt;&gt;don't see how they can have anything intelligent to say about the value of
&gt;&gt;such a move without having seen it. Thing is, if it wasn't banned, then you
&gt;&gt;could read reviews by your favourite reviewer, perhaps watch the trailer,
&gt;&gt;and make the decision for yourself, just as you do with every other film
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;you
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;ever see. Sometimes, you'd decide it sucked, and sometimes you'd like it.
&gt;&gt;But it's your decision. Right now, you can't make that decision for
&gt;&gt;yourself. You can, however, read reviews...
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Reviews aren't a problem as the Internet is littered with both personal and
&gt;professional reviews for Ken Park.
&gt;
&gt;The only reason why this movie was banned is because of the real sex.  It
&gt;ceases to be a movie fit for cinemas and becomes pornography sold at sex
&gt;shops.  Overall this shouldn't be a debate about one movie that will
&gt;probably be forgotten next year, but a broader look at whether real versus
&gt;simulated should be allowed in cinemas, and what age groups should be
&gt;allowed to view it.  What do I think of that?  Well, I hope we don't end up
&gt;turning the local Greater Union into a porn flick theatre.
