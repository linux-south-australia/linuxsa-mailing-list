Hi lists,
I'm trying to setup a basic web hosting server for use with 200+ sites.
 I've done the usual setup of mail+ftp+apache+mysql, with proftpd configured
with chroots to each "virtual site"'s root, so users can't browse through
to other people's hosted sites.

Directory structure is /home/hosting/www.sitehere.com/www
Every site has its own group, every user is part of this group

Problem though -- apache runs as user 'httpd', which requires every site
to have read-all access.  Even though every user on the system has a
false shell set, so they can't ssh/telnet in, it means anybody who has
a reasonably basic knowledge of php or perl to write a simple script
to list and show files in other directories they have read access to
- which are other people's sites!

Seeing as most sites these days are database driven it potentionally
means that they could view another site's php/perl source, where the
username, password, and database are defined.  They could then write
their own script to modify that database directly!

Surely there's some way to stop users in an apache 'virtual host' from
being able to view other hosted site's files?

Ideas?

Thanks
