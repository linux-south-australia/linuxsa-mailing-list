Hi List.

This isn't specifically Linux related (in fact, I think I'm yet to ask a
question that is...?), but I figured I'd ask anyhow :

My Dad recently gave me a spare cable which he had in a drawer, and didn't
require any more, and what's more didn't know where he'd acquired it in the
first place.  I had a quick look at the end and noted it was a DB9
extenstion cable, which you could use in a serial port.  I figured I'd stick
it in a drawer until I needed such a thing.

Last night, a fried of mine picked it up and said "Why do you need a VGA
extension lead ?", and I said it was a serial lead.  Upon looking at the end
he'd grabbed, it had a monitor type plug.

So yeah, it's a DB9 toa VGA (or whatever it's called) adapter lead - thingy.
It's manufactured (i.e. there's no cut/tape marks on it.

My question is - what in the hell would one use such a thing for ?

Cheers,

Jason =)
