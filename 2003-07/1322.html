Hi Damien,

I got 2.6.0test2 the first day of release and have been trying it out on
my Mandrake 9.1 system. 

I've got a running kernel and it boots into KDE, my main problem is that
kernel autoloading isn't working. I've actually had to manually insmod
or list  USB, mouse, Ethernet, CPUFreq etc.. in /etc/module. Auto module
loading is compiled int he kernel but doesn't appear to be working.

In fact if I leave /etc/modules blank, NO kernel module gets loaded in
on boot up. If I didn't compile RieserFS, keyboard input support in I
wouldn't of had a very usable kernel.

Would you mind emailing me these files offlist?

/etc/modules
/etc/modules.conf
/etc/modprobe.conf
/etc/modprobe.devfs

I want to see how Knoppix differs to Mandrake.

As for your responsiveness problem did you catch the mention of the
scheduler patch on Slashdot? I downloaded it in case I needed it - I'll
send it to you off list.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt; I have recently installed kernel 2.6.0-test2 on my knoppix 3.2 hdd install. 
&gt; Here is some general advice on getting it going, followed by my first 
&gt; impressions:
&gt; 
&gt; Unpack the tarball (tar -xjvf linux-2.6.0-test2.tar.bz2), enter the directory 
&gt; and type "make xconfig" (make sure you have qt devel libraries installed). 
&gt; Choose only the drivers that you need for your system, you will find that 
&gt; many don't compile yet. Check 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt">http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt</A> for things to expect 
&gt; (make sure to enable Virtual Terminal support!).
&gt; 
&gt; Save this, then type:
&gt; 
&gt; $ make
&gt; $ make modules_install
&gt; $ make install
&gt; 
&gt; Configure lilo to point to the new kernel and run lilo. Reboot into the new 
&gt; kernel (hopefully it'll work, it took me 5 or 6 goes to get it going).
&gt; 
&gt; Impressions:
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't seem that much different to 2.4 to me so far. The scheduler seems like 
&gt; it's on it's way to becoming better than 2.4 (it seems to handle high loads 
&gt; better), however it seems to have some serious problems for me. I performed 
&gt; the following test:
&gt; 
&gt; cd to linux kernel source directory
&gt; $ make clean
&gt; $ make -j3
&gt; 
&gt; I also ran "find /usr -name '*'" and managed to get the load up around 3-5. I 
&gt; then grabbed the Mozilla window and swirled it around in circles -- all 
&gt; seemed well for a few seconds, but it then started intermittently pausing 
&gt; (pausing the mouse as well). I've also experienced this in other programs 
&gt; whilst moving its window around. I've even had mouse lag when Mozilla 
&gt; refreshed it's page.
&gt; 
&gt; Other problems: Some apps seem to go to sleep and never wake up, or take 
&gt; extroadinarily long times to complete their tasks. Openoffice died once under 
&gt; this new kernel (just sat there, not taking up any CPU, just hanging around). 
&gt; Whilst the load was still high I opened LyX and did view-&gt;DVI on a document 
&gt; after a few minutes I checked the process list and latex was just sitting 
&gt; there doing nothing. Strange...
&gt; 
&gt; Another simple test is when an mp3/ogg just starts playing in xmms, I click 
&gt; the KDE task bar of a maximised app a few times (thereby sending it to the 
&gt; taskbar and then redrawing it maximised several times fairly rapidly) and I 
&gt; get sound skips in xmms for the first few times -- no such problems under 
&gt; 2.4.
&gt; 
&gt; Launch speeds under high load seems to be better. Apart from the strange 
&gt; pauses, responsiveness is quite good under high load too.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else tested the 2.6 series yet? Any comments?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Damien
