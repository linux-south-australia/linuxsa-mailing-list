Personally, I don't understand why there are problems. I see what they are, 
but not why they're there. for me, religion and science exist side by side, 
each dealing with what they should, without trying to deal with issues of the 
other. I have equal problem with people who try to push science into the 
realms of religion, as those who push religion into realms of science.
on another note, I'm somewhat dissapointed that people have mostly used 
christianity in examples of religious matters. but since the big fights here 
are often with the religious side arguing strict creationism (it _was_ 7 
days, and no, it's not symbolic of 7 era on earth). generally, when I find 
myself in a discussion, and I find that the other side takes this view, I 
just walk away. if they beleive in creationism, and can accept that the 7 
days is symbolic (as are a great number of things in religion), then I'll 
hang around, as I like the odd philosophical debate.
of course, the reaction of many other christians when they find out that I'm a 
witch means that I can't debate with them either. sad, really.
anyway, I've babbled long enough for this thread, especially since I didn't 
intend on posting on it at all 8^)

if anyone does want to discuss with me more on the topic, you have my email 
addy 8^)

(but if you send to the list, there's no point sending to me as well, I _do_ 
get both)

cheerio, Adam
