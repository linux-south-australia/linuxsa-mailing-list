&gt;No, there's a fundamental difference between belief in Chistianity and
&gt;belief in big bang.  Douglas Adams said it neatly, when he wrote, the
&gt;proof of God's non-existance:

&gt;  ``"I refuse to prove I exist", said God, "for proof denies faith
&gt; and without faith I am nothing."''
&gt;     -- Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe

&gt;When you start proving God it ceases to be religion and becomes science;
&gt;and religion is the antithesis of science.  That is no argument against
&gt;Christianity, and it is not my intent to argue along those lines.
&gt;My point, which I hope is now clear, is that Christendom's belief is
&gt;intrinsic (you are not allowed to question the dogma), whereas science
&gt;has no belief, merely unproven theories.  And science expects you to
&gt;question everything.


that's an interesting thought.  the thought about proving there is a God.

but can you prove there isn't one?   i believe there are two ways of proving
something to be true.

1. scientifially.   the proof that a set of experiments or procedures that
can be repeated to come to the conclusion drawn.

2.  historically.  proof which is gained by listening to people that were at
the event and drawing a conclusion.  ie, in a court of law.

to 'prove' there is a God as you say it quite ludacrous because it's not in
the scientific realm.  you can't repeat or recreate God.

as far as proof of evolution.  does this fall under the historical or can we
scientifically re-create millions of years in the lab?  is it based on
repeatable scientific fact, or is it based on the experts looking at the
evidence and saying this must have taken millions of years....

things like sedimentry layers put down over a long time is seen in current
time by the action of a volcano, and hearing reports about stalagmites and
stalagtites taking a million years to make when an equally big one is
created in a number of years.

having said that i don't know if that effects the evolution/creation
auguemtn or even if that is current theory as it seems to change so much.
funny how the theory of evolution has changed so many times since good old
charles darwin first put out his origin of species or whatever.   the basics
of creation 'theory' has not changed once nor been disproven as was written
in the Bible.

anyway, i got sidetracked.  to prove or disprove God scientifically is not
going to happen, nor is it possible...

and may i ask why are we not allowed to question 'dogma' as you call it.
creation and the Bible is there to be questioned.    the Roman Catholic
church and those lot are up the creek when only the elect or the upper
echelons are allowed to tell the everyday people what it means.  that's
complete and utter rubbish.    God expects us to believe on him with a
complete understanding of what he has told us in the Bible...

anyway i'll bag up now as it's time to go home.....
