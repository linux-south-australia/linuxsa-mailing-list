Hi all,

This is completely off-topic, but i thought some people here may have
something to say about this, with the common interest in Free Software, and
often free speech. How do people feel about the recent censorship debate in
Australia? I'm thinking of three films in particular: "Baise Moi", "Ken
Park", and David Irving's "The Search for Truth in History". The first two
were censored by the OFLC mostly for mixing violence and sex (and Ken Park
depicted underage sex -- using adult actors though). The third (rated G) was
either banned by a court decision, or pulled from a film festival because of
pressure and the threat of violence (I'm not sure quite what happened,
actually), because it is said to promote holocaust-denial and anti-semitic
views. See <A HREF="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/03/1057179081670.html">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/03/1057179081670.html</A>
for some info on that movie. I personally have little interest in what David
Irving has to say -- I've seen his website, and he seems to be something of
a nutcase. However, given the recent controversy, I now want to see the
film, so I know what all the fuss was about.

Other films that have recently aroused controversy are Romance, Intimacy,
Salo (which was made in 1975, but recently re-banned) and Lolita (both the
original and the remake). If we look back into the 70s, there are others too
(A Clockwork Orange springs to mind). Some go unnoticed, resumably because
no-one really wanted to see them in the first place. Some, however, were
planned to be screen at film festivals or special screenings at arthouse
cinemas. Rarely are these films intended for widespread distribution, and
they are often not even worth watching (eg Baise Moi and Romance were quite
forgettable). However, sometimes they are actually quite good (eg Intimacy,
the original Lolita, and A Clockwork Orange are all worth seeing -- Ken Park
less so, but it's still a good movie if you're interested in it and don't
mind being challenged).

The reason I ask is because I believe in personal freedom (regarding what we
choose to say, hear and see, as well as what we do with our software and
hardware), and I suspect many others on this list do too. It presently
appears that we are heading back to the 50s with public attitudes to media
censorship. Banning films like this means that if you want to see them, you
are forced into breaking copyright law to do so (eg by using KaZaA or
eDonkey or some other peer-to-peer filesharing network). I don't think
that's right, particularly as it only hurts the small-time filmmakers who
have the courage to make something like this, not the truly damaging tripe
(IMHO) that the mainstream hollywood groups put out.

Does anyone here care about censorship? Is anyone here involved in actively
doing anything about it? Are there any half-decent groups around the place
dedicated to fighting for our freedom of choice in what we see? Is it worth
trying to arrange a screening of (say) Ken Park in Adelaide, like the Free
Cinema people attempted in Sydney? Not that I'm prepared to get arrested
like Margaret Pomeranz did...
