&gt; After browsing this mornings diatribe from SCO I am
&gt; wondering if the time is approaching when the Open Source 
&gt; movement starts to go on the offensive. 
&gt; How long can this concerted attack from SCO be ignored ? 
&gt; 
&gt; The coordinated power of Linux users and Open Source 
&gt; movement is considerable. Maybe some of it should be
&gt; brought to bear on SCO. I am not sure what form this
&gt; should take. Others better qualified may have some
&gt; ideas. It would need to be carefully thought out.
&gt; World Wide protest action has been done before,
&gt; but it should take to form of something unique to Linux. 

Slowly but surely.. I think that we can do more technically than
politically.

Everytime I come across a 'legacy' application which still requires a
SCO box, I simply tell it's owner that SCO has gone crazy and will be
out of business soon leaving their platform unsupported (possibly not in
those words, but it's true..) . Then I replace the OS with RedHat 7.3
which has excellent SCO binary support and most applications will
continue running with only minor system (language and /dev entries
mostly) changes.

Note that Redhat 9 seems not to have the SCO binary emulation, not sure
about 8. Modprobe abi-sco, and modprobe binfmt-coff are your friends!

Of course many applications have both SCO and Linux versions, so if
there's a Linux version available, try to get the owner to consider
switching. Even the license cost of adding an extra 5 users to a 
SCO system should cover the installation. Then they can add as many
users as they want! Of course, this doesn't take in to account the cost
of the application itself, but usually there's not much of a difference,
and in some instances, if you're using the SCO version, you also have
the right to use the Linux version.

Together we can rid the world of this substandard, crufty, recompile my
kernel and reboot for just about any minor setting change, using the GUI
causes IO throughput to drop, so called 'Operating System'. Can you tell
I think SCO sucks ? :-)

Cheers,
Chris.
