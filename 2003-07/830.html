Barney,

&gt; I don't see why the source must be open. If someone has a better product
&gt; that is closed, why not use it?

Because how can you prove that a closed source program conforms to all the
standards, doesn't act differently to other programs? And what happens if
it ACCIDENTALLY doesn't conform but the company making it just goes
"You'll have to wait until the next release."

&gt; The problem ATM is that you can get  stuck with a closed solution
&gt; because they lock you in. If you eliminate this possibility the open
&gt; source can compete based on the fact that it is a better solution.

Yes, but if you get landed with an open source product which isn't
standards compliant at least you can either:

 (1) Fix it; or
 (2) Know precisely what it is doing

&gt; We shouldn't need our own lock-in mechanism, we should only need a
&gt; level playing field. The ISC/M$ argument is that they 
&gt; shouldn't be descriminated against.

Shouldn't is a subjective word.

&gt; What I propose doesn't - mandating open source does. I fail to see
&gt; why forcing the government to use software that could well be inferior
&gt; is a good thing.

Agree.

&gt; Set up a level playing field and then the benefits of
&gt; OSS should supply the better solution. If it isn't better what is the
&gt; point of using it?

A bill which mandated that a full, public explanation with public review
of all costs and benefits [much like the development process for a
category 3 development] and review by an independent technologically savvy
board for the use of ANY large proprietary software purchase might satisfy
your concerns.

[if you can understand that paragraph, good on you ;-P]

This is to say, if the Government wants to purchase 1000 Apple Mac's and
use Aqua [which is not open source], it would need to:

 1) Gazette what it's about to do
 2) Wait for a public review
 3) Wait for a review from an independent board [2 + 3 could be combined]
 4) Expose all financial details as is practicable to the public
 5) Then work out what to do

;-)

Difficult, but possible.
