&gt; Rann's man slams open source
&gt; John Sterlicchi
&gt; July 15, 2003
&gt; 
&gt; MIKE Rann's South Australian Government has moved to demonstrate there
&gt; is little chance of it mandating open source software in state departments.
&gt; 
&gt; Governments around the world are being asked to vote on open source
&gt; preference laws, which are viewed by opponents as anti-Windows and
&gt; anti-Microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft lobbyists are labelling such laws as protectionist and anti-US
&gt; and the timing of the latest brouhaha comes just before US and
&gt; Australian negotiators are due to meet to discuss a free trade agreement.
&gt; 

As someone already pointed out in an earlier thread, the obvious choice
for an open source operating system alternative is Redhat, which is also
an American Software Company. However, there are other American
distributions too. How can their arguments be maintained as valid in
light of the the facts?
It's really just another example of M$'s ability to successfully use FUD
tactics at every opportunity to maintain their stranglehold monopoly on
the markets, and their determination to twist the truth to futher their
own ends.

It also demonstrates our politicians inability to think for themselves
and how they merely spend our tax dollars to already M$ corrupted
"experts" to do their thinking for them. The answer is simple. Stop
voting for them.
