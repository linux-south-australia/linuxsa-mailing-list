&gt; &gt; However, the beauty of human existence is that we have free thought and

&gt; &gt; idea, good on them, but it doesn't mean that other people who want to

&gt; &gt; proof either way.
&gt; 
&gt; If you go back far enough, evolution doesn't provide any answers.  It
&gt; provides a questionable theory for in between "The beginning" and
&gt; present day and thats it.

This claim is interesting for a couple of reasons:

  1. The scientific theory of evolution does not deal with how the
     universe began or how the solar system got here or how the
     very first thing that could be called life arose. Those are
     the subjects of other areas of study, including abiogenesis.

  2. A number of popular explanations for how things began posit that
     one or more gods were involved. These explanations (sometimes
     called myths) leave out all the interesting details, which, to 
     any sentient entity, is just totally unsatisfactory.

&gt; The thing I find most ironic about the theory of evolution is that
&gt; ultimately evolution relies on creation anyway.  Even the "big bang"
&gt; theory relies on the existence of material and energy, in order for it
&gt; to take place.  Where, might I ask, did all this "stuff" come from.  To
&gt; date I haven't heard a single theory on the matter because ultimately it
&gt; involves a question that can only be answered with something being
&gt; created.

So, where did this 'creator' come from. Please explain why we must posit a 
creator, who was not itself created?

Also, please explain how we are to recognize the results of 'creation' and 
deal with the expistemological issues.

&gt; Just to clear things up, I believe in evolution, but let's define
&gt; evolution here.  Micro evolution or macro evolution??  I believe in
&gt; micro evolution, that is the ability for a species to adapt to it's
&gt; surroundings/environment at a micro level. This has been observed in
&gt; nature today.  
&gt; 
&gt; What I don't accept, and this is the quantum leap evolutionists want you
&gt; to take, is macro evolution. I DON'T believe my great, great, great,
&gt; great, great, great, great, (you get the idea) grandfather was an
&gt; amoeba!!  I'm sorry, I don't care how many millions of years you put in
&gt; between!  The sad thing is, that evolutionists try to extrapolate micro
&gt; evolution to macro evolution.  If you have a decent dig into the
&gt; arguments for evolution, you will find there is not a single shred of
&gt; evidence to support macro evolution.

Ahhhh, now I understand. You don't actually know much about the theory of 
evolution.

As to the 'problems of evolution', please see: 

The Problems of Evolution, Mark Ridley, Oxford University Press, 1985. 
However, much progress has been made since 1985.
