   evolution is, at least, a scientific theory, and a work in progress.
   religion claims to be the truth and the way. (and i notice yr links are
   for
   chritstian genesis. i do LOVE the way fundamentalists dont even consider
   other religious explanations).

It is only a theory and one that takes more faith than any religion ... you
do the math.

   one is subject to scientific evaluation, empirical evidence, and
   incorporation
   of new facts and knowledge.

You claim its one of scientific evaluation and empirical evidence? How can
you say that... The fossil history is so incomplete it cannot be said to be
scientifically proven.

   one is stagnant, absolute, and does not allow for scientific evaluation.

funny how scientific evidence can more easily validate some scripture than
(evidence of the flood etc noahs ark) than even one intermediary fossil.

   one can be rightly taught in science. one is best relegated to religious
   or
   mythological study.

I agree lets pursue the truth, teach scientific method, teach math. I am
not saying you should get religious or anything like that. I am just
pointing out that there are some serious flaws in some widely believed
theories. I am not having a "go" at anyone either. I would like to point
out that evolution is far from scientific.

   and kind of not linuxy anyway - shall we move holy wars back to vi vs
   emacs or
   bsd vs linux, as is proper?:)))

Now that I have said my $0.02 I agree.
