Quoting Andrew Pullin &lt;<A HREF="mailto:andrew@hotspurbgc.com.au">andrew@hotspurbgc.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; each hop. This sounded a bit Irish to me, as I would have thought that once
&gt; the packets left the sending network in an IPv4 network, they would start
&gt; out at 1500 byte packets (being the MTU for normal Ethernet) and gradually
&gt; collapse into larger packets as they were processed by bigger faster routers
&gt; before being shrunk back to 1500 byte packets for delivery on the
&gt; destination network. 

It's an interesting thought, but I imagine that coalescing packets in this 
manner might be more work for the routers than simply passing them along a 
cached path. Fragment re-assembly may also introduce additional serialisation 
latency that defeats the efficiency gains of having larger packets.

&gt; On routing, if the path is worked out prior to
&gt; transmission, what happens if the path changes enroute for different packets
&gt; to that the calculation was done on? 

Routers only ever pick the path to the next router based on available 
information, they don't map out a path for data to follow. If the path changes 
enroute, the router at each hop will make an independent decision as to the 
best way to send it.

&gt; If the new path had a route with an MTU
&gt; too small, would the data transfer fail automatically? 

In IPv6, 'do-not-fragment' is assumed, so I guess it would. The router 
connected to the skinny path should send back a 'packet-too-big' message so 
that your host can resend the data with a smaller packet size. This is known as 
PMTU discovery.
