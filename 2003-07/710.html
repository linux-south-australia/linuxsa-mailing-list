&gt; James,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Seems as though he is saying...if this stuff is so good, why do we
&gt; &gt; need a law to make people buy it...
&gt;
&gt; It is a reasonable argument in a perfect world. But then
&gt; again we really
&gt; do need positive discrimination laws for some
&gt; minorities...try looking
&gt; Asian in a predominantly white country...

its also partly to do with education.

most government departments have sales reps drop in from time to time
to do the hard sell. Dell, IBM, Oracle, Peoplesoft are just a couple
that i remember assulting us with their sales pitches are various
times...
i still get endless steams of telemarketers who dont even know that
our
company does trying to sell us various tech stuff =/

maybe there needs to be a proactive "education" arm of LinuxSA or
similar
group to do the hard sell to government departments around SA...

they understand that approach. they are used to it. we need to expoilt
their lazyness and take it to them... convert them from within. =P

they can spend their budgets on jobs, not anual licence fees to
microsoft.
im sure they can see the benifits from that. OSS creates jobs, and
right
now they need that to turn the economy around.

like someone said on another thread, using OSS packages in training at
tafe would make better use of money that students have to spend on
education and reduce piracy. what more could they want?

pah ... must be dreamen'

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
