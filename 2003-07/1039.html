 &gt; Would it have hurt gated to have been released under GPL instead of BSD?
 &gt; Unlikely.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been developed to the extent that
 &gt; it otherwise has, but then again, looking at what does get developed and
 &gt; released freely, I think gated would be functionally the same either way.
 &gt; The difference is: the BSD gated is now dead; you really have to buy
 &gt; the commercial one.  A GPL gated would not have died.

The BSD gated isn't dead;  I found it with ten seconds of googling
(in RPM form, no less - great for installing on your GPL OS distribution
:-).

The functionality that's missing from the free one is the functionality
that nobody has bothered implementing.  

gated has forked.  That's a perfectly normal part of the evolution of
open-source software projects.  It just so happens that nobody cares
enough to maintain the old fork anymore, and that the new fork is 
commercial.  But that doesn't stop someone from picking up the old
one and developing with it today.

(just like Ingres 10 years ago)

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
