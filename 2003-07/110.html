&gt;&gt; I know Internode people contribute to the list, but their silence on 
&gt;&gt; whether Internode do offer DSL wirless may be taken to mean that 
&gt;&gt; contrary to what Simon has stated, they don't do DSL wireless?
&gt;&gt; Can anyone confirm that they do or they don't. There seems to be 
&gt;&gt; conflicting statements and I would really like to explore it further if 
&gt;&gt; they do.

&gt; Steve,
&gt;
&gt; What is DSL wireless? DSL is Digital Subscriber Line, which would 
&gt; indicate a
&gt; physical line... wireless would indicate the opposite. I assume that some
&gt; people are marketing broadband wireless as DSL wireless, but that would 
&gt; be
&gt; just marketing terminology...
&gt;
&gt; If it's broadband wireless you're after, then yes, Internode will do high
&gt; speed wireless links (as Simon Hackett said: "Internode/Agile offers
&gt; wireless DSL equivalents along that strip to spots that don't have ADSL
&gt; coverage on Greenhill Rd").  I would imagine that this connectivity is
&gt; provided either by microwave or 802.11b, but there may be other options.
&gt;
&gt; Certainly Adam are able to provide a similar service, though it is my
&gt; understanding that usually they would rather lease roof space and an
&gt; ethernet port, and have you manage your own microwave link (John Edwards
&gt; will likely correct me if I have this wrong). That would mean you could 
&gt; use
&gt; whatever technology you chose, within reason (provided it's legal, 
&gt; doesn't
&gt; interfere with other equipment, and isn't so heavy that the roof can't
&gt; support it... though I can't think what you'd be doing with something 
&gt; that
&gt; heavy anyway).
&gt;
&gt; There are, of course, others, but I suspect that unless you want cheap 
&gt; and
&gt; nasty, most needs would be satisfied by one of this lists two favourite
&gt; ISPs... :)
