&gt; The GPL isn't "free-as-in-speech".  It's "free-as-in-beer"; 

Many years ago that whole point was that it provided both.

&gt; And it's selfish, motivated by greed.  

It may be self, but it not greed, at first, its control.

&gt; The fact that it's greed for source code instead 

which is all about control...

&gt; of greed for money doesn't make it any more morally pure
&gt; than a commercial software license.

=)

&gt; I've described a relevent example of the GPL holding-back
&gt; an open source project (i.e., it has made adoption of 
&gt; the GIMP by professional graphic designers essentially impossible).

So, the answer is not (from a GPL perspective) how do we get
a Pantone(C)(R)(TM) system, but how do we get something
that provides what Pantone(C)(R)(TM) provides but better? =)

&gt; Can you, or anyone else, provide even *one* example, real 
&gt; or hypothetical, of BSD licensing resulting in similar 
&gt; damage to an open source project's potential?

I think that there are several issues, that aren't quite what
you are pointing to here, but are close; a lot of these projects
stagnate. SunOS, Irix and others had a quite time where there
was little development and few feature improvements. This is
not the same as you describe, but commericial enterprise will
try to wring as much out of a given investment as they can.

It was only when there was real pain in the land of UNIX
did the UNIX vendors pick up their game and invest more in
order to keep up...

&gt; I claim you can't, because the BSD license gives you every 
&gt; real-world advantage that the GPL gives, with less restrictions.
&gt; I.e., the BSD license is a superset of the GPL.

these restrictions you mention are always on business fredoms?
it does not appear to be on people?
