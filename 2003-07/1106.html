&gt;  &gt; The BSD is what you use to
&gt;  &gt; deny someone else the right to make a buck.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;boggle&gt;  How?  If someone wants to take my BSD-licensed code, whack
&gt; their name all over it, and sell it for a million dollars,
&gt; that's their
&gt; perogative.
&gt;
&gt; How does the BSD license stop anyone from making a buck?
&gt;
&gt; And can you explain your reasoning to Sun, HP, etc...?

I think you missed one. SGI. Where are they now?

They made a *lot* of very inovitive software. Some
very good software. But, they droped the ball and
did not make the right kinds of partnerships with
other groups to push their software forwards.

I am not saying that any amount of GPL based code or IP
would have helped, but the BSD licence 'headspace' is
what makes or brakes the way work and develop...

Sun are barely still here. There are ploding along slowly,
mostly by shipping 'tin'. The dot com boom made them
a lot of money, they sold lots'o'hardware and gave away
their software for no money. But, they failed to help
themselves with external development of their products.
Sun are quite keen to help you use their software, and
are giving away Java and all the tools to go with it,
because it goes like a shower of shite on an UltraSparc...
And the good people will notice this and make the right
decission and buy one, or two...

Pah! Why is it always about money =(

Kim
