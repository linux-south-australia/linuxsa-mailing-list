&gt; care to explain to this little doofus how you got it to work???

No doofuslry required.  This isn't a "step by step" guide as such,
just a list of notes that I used to get it up and running.  Probably
the biggest issue is that when I wrote this, there wasn't an RPM
for Squid 2.5, and if there were one now, you would probably still
need to recompile it to add in the NTLM authentication.  Most of
what follows is cut 'n' pasting.

We have:
.  A neat proxy server (Squid2.5-STABLE1)
.  An NT domain network
.  A desire to have the users of the proxy server authenticated
   against the NT domain, so that we can apply access control
   lists to authenticated users

The Access Policy
.  Allow selected IP addresses unrestricted access (typically servers,
   whose IP addresses don't change and can't authenticate as the
   processes are not "logged in" to the desktop).
.  Allow all users access to a selected subset of domains.  This
   allows all users to access, for example, www.whitepages.com.au
.  Allow selected users unrestricted access to the Internet
.  Otherwise, reject access to the Internet.

Overview
Squid version 2.5-STABLE1 is compiled with specific options to enable
the NTLM helper processes.  Squid 2.5-STABLE1 is the minimum version
required that natively supports both transparent NTLM authentication
to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, as well as providing the backend
processes that enable NTLM authentication to the NT Domain Controllers
(without using winbind, which I'm loathe to use on a firewall type
appliance).

Compiling and Configuring Squid
Configure options used on Squid 2.5 (matches RedHat's directory
structure as much as possible).

# ./configure --exec=/usr --bindir=/usr/sbin \
    --libexecdir=/usr/lib/squid --localstatedir=/var \
    --sysconfdir=/etc/squid -enable -gnuregex --disable-icmp \
    --disable-snmp --disable-http-violations \
    --disable-ident-lookups --enable-underscores \
    --enable-ntlm-fail-open --enable-ntlm-auth-helpers="SMB" \
    --enable-auth=ntlm

# make
# make install


Squid Configuration
The following configuration file achieves the policy outlined above.
Please note that
.  No modifications were made to the NT domain (e.g. no adding of
   workstation accounts) - the authentication technique used by
   Squid appears to be attempting to connect to the Domain Controller
   using the supplied credentials, transparently passing the NT
   Challenges and Responses between the browser and DC.
.  The file /etc/squid/server.access contains a list of client IP
   addresses that are allowed unrestricted access (server processes
   are typically unable to provide authentication details).
.  The file /etc/squid/all.domains.access contains a list of domains
   that all users are allowed access to (e.g. www.whitepages.com.au).
   If access is required to an entire sub-domain, for example *.ibm.com,
   then use the shortened version of the domain name with the full stop
   in place, .ibm.com, to allow access to any server under ibm.com.
.  The file /etc/squid/all.users.access contains a list of NT account
   names that are allowed unrestricted access to the Internet.  The
   names must be fully qualified, i.e. domain-name\username, and must
   be listed in lowercase.  NTLM authentication only takes place if the
   above checks fail, to reduce the delay experienced by the users if
   they are browsing domains listed in all.domains.access.  The
   downside of this method is that the logs will not list the authorised
   usernames when accessing the above "all users access" domains.
