Andrew,

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:andrew@test">andrew@test</A> ~]$ echo "linux" | md5sum
&gt; 5bb062356cddb5d2c0ef41eb2660cb06  -
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:andrew@test">andrew@test</A> ~]$ echo "LiNuX" | md5sum
&gt; c8d58815b7960cf9519f1e2cd59c04d6  -
&gt; 
&gt; They don't look similar to me :P

That's beside the point - you've missed it totally.

&gt; &gt; it against the
&gt; &gt; current password. It's most likely a horrid, mathematical 
&gt; &gt; probability algorithm.
&gt; 
&gt; Fair enough- it could remember some strange maths result of the password last
&gt; used...?

The point is that the md5sum of linux will always be what you wrote. As will
LiNuX. There is a definite mathematical relation between the two of them. The
point of "md5sums" and other signature algorithms is that it's difficult to make
another md5sum that is exactly the same.

So, if you were presented with:

5bb062356cddb5d2c0ef41eb2660cb06

It would take a lot of searching to come up with an md5sum that was exactly the
same.

This property doesn't imply that it's not difficult to mathematically find out
if a particular md5sum is similar to another md5sum. The mathematics are horrid,
they go through matrices and probably involve a heap of calculus too.

Let me make another analogy: a professional forgerer could forge a picasso and I
wouldn't know the difference. But this doesn't mean that a professional fraud
detecter couldn't spot the dissimilarities.
