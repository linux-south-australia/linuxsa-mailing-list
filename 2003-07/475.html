&gt; It presently appears that we are heading back to the 50s with public
&gt; attitudes to media censorship. Banning films like this means that if you
&gt; want to see them, you are forced into breaking copyright law to do so

Banning films doesn't force anyone to break copyright laws. That's not the
point of censorship. The point of censorship is just to stop you from
seeing whatever it is that they have censored. They really don't want you
to see this material.

I guess if you have censorship then there is always going to be an overlap
of opinion as to what is acceptable. It's a strange idea really... is mock
child sex scene more or less acceptable than any other rape scene, or a
murder or torture?

If we really censored out what was unacceptable (according to the law or
our "common morals"--whatever they are) then we'd have very little to
watch.

Especially from Hollywood.
