&gt;  &gt; &gt; What you've just said is more like the BSD license:  You're free to
&gt;  &gt; &gt; do whatever you like, up to and including selling the fruits of my
&gt;  &gt; &gt; labour without paying me, as long as you're honest about where you got
&gt;  &gt; &gt; the code from.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; How, preceisely, does the GPL provide more freedom than that?
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; I think it comes down to who's freedom is being protected.  Allow that
&gt;  &gt; the world is divided into those who make software and those who use it.
&gt;  &gt; GNU protects freedom for the people who use software.  BSD doesn't.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not?  Individual users don't care about the license.  The only 
&gt; people who give a shit are developers;  Who, incidentally, are 
&gt; hampered by the GPL.
&gt; 
&gt; "The people who use software" can continue to use it whether it's GPL
&gt; or BSD.  Why do they need to care?

Actually, I don't think that this last claim is true any more, since SCO 
has started making stupid noises like it can sue people for using software 
that has been supplied by a developer who breached copyright law.

At least here in the US, as a result, more and more companies are asking 
for indemnities and are asking about the provenance of the software they 
are being sold. Up on /. is an article about one software development 
house being asked to certify that their product contains no "Free 
Software." I wonder if they asked MS that also :-)

Now, here is my personal experience with both the GPL and BSD licences. We 
use both in our product. While there is a lot of crap running around about 
the GPL being viral, it is true that the GPL places an extra burden on 
developers that the BSD licence does not.

To ensure that we can avoid making life easy for competitors (which is a 
real imperitive in business and VC look increasingly nervious when they 
see business plans that are totally based on GPL'd software) we have to:

1. Avoid using any of our libraries in GPL'd code. That means re-writing 
any functions that we want to use and adding them to the GPL'd code.

2, Spend effort in getting the source ready for release so that when we 
release the product, the source is available to our customers as well.

3. Invest brain power in coming up with ways to keep stuff out of the 
reach of the GPL, and look at re-writing the GPL'd stuff, possibly in a 
clean-room environment.
