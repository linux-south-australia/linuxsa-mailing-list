&gt; I was thinking along those lines, but wanted to see what other people 
&gt; thought before I did anything rash.

I guess the other thing, which is a bit harder, is to expect rejection. As
he says, you're not a journalist or writer, you're a CPA. While this doesn't
mean you can't write (you can), it certainly means that you're likely to
meet with less immediate success than someone who does this for a living.
You may find that you get more ready acceptance in a "lesser" magazine, or
even one with a different focus -- perhaps a linux mag. I don't mean for
that to be an insult, it's just that the top magazines can afford to pay
full time writers to write spectacular articles, and you can't expect to
compete with them, even if you put heaps of effort into it (just the same
way as a full time journo couldn't expect to get a CPA firm to pay them to
do a computer upgrade...). I think _especially_ with things like writing,
it's very hit and miss to begin with, and people starting out almost
invariably receive huge numbers of rejections before they begin to get
accepted by editors...
