Hi Robyn (and All),
    Are you certain that they are the OFFICIAL 2003 Darwin Awards? The
reason I ask is that certainly your winner and probably some others of those
stories are in the Darwin Awards Books (there are two of them) and I have
owned both of them for at least a year. Now I haven't checked the Darwin
Awards site, but I am sure that they are old ones. I also know that there
have been at least three Darwin Awards sites running concurrently at one
time or another, and there has been some confusion in the past. I am not
saying that those stories aren't Darwin Awards or don't deserve them, but I
am a little dubious about that they are for THIS year. Might be worth
checking out.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; The 2003 Darwin Awards
&gt; In case you have been waiting breathlessly for this year's Darwin Awards,
&gt; here they are. The awards this year are, once again, truly classic. These
&gt; awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains of) that
individual,
&gt; who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove
&gt; undesirable elements from the human gene pool.
&gt; Just think...until these events, these same people were walking the
streets
&gt; like normal people.
&gt;
&gt; 5th RUNNER-UP:
&gt; Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower
&gt; at the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam
&gt; pad. The 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth
&gt; Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's
&gt; department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run
&gt; called Stump alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift
&gt; towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The
&gt; pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently
&gt; used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed
&gt; into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower
&gt; he hit was the one with its pad removed.
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 4th RUNNER-UP:
&gt;
&gt; Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St.Louis
&gt; market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot
&gt; dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found
&gt; him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch
&gt; wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death.
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 3rd RUNNER-UP:
&gt;
&gt; Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above
him
&gt; on a n overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him.
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 2nd RUNNER-UP:
&gt;
&gt; "Man loses face at party." A man at a West Virginia party (probably
related
&gt; to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used the .22bullet to
replace
&gt; the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his
&gt; mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth,
&gt; and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a
prank
&gt; during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. "Another man
had
&gt; it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it." "It
&gt; wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off." He put
&gt; it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and
&gt; tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday
&gt; with extensive Facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston
&gt; Area Medical Division. "I just can't imagine anyone doing something like
&gt; that," Payne said.
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 1st RUNNER-UP:
&gt;
&gt; Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through
&gt; the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released
soon
&gt; from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last
&gt; weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men
&gt; Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants
&gt; Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the
arrow
&gt; entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1
&gt; millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and
Roberts
&gt; would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at the
&gt; University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches
&gt; of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow
&gt; managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had
Roberts
&gt; tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed
himself.
&gt; Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that
&gt; afternoon. Said Roberts, I feel so dumb about this." No charges have been
&gt; filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the
&gt; initiation stunt is under investigation.
&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Now, THIS YEAR'S WINNER:
&gt;
&gt; (The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the
&gt; great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert
&gt; at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had
18
&gt; beers between them), they thought it would be easy to "hop" over
&gt; the nine foot fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup
truck
&gt; over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds
&gt; heavier than Mr. Hawkins) to hop the fence and then assist his
&gt; friend over. Unfortunate for (the late) Mr.Pernicky, there was a 30-foot
&gt; drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found
&gt; himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken,
&gt; along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts.
&gt; Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some
bushes
&gt; below him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed
his
&gt; pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the
&gt; tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp
leaves
&gt; scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the
&gt; protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make
&gt; matters worse, on landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh.
&gt; Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a
rope
&gt; and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and
&gt; slowly driving away.
&gt; However, in his drunken haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and
&gt; crashed through the fence landing on his friend and killing him. Police
&gt; arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from
the
&gt; truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries. Upon moving
the
&gt; truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly
&gt; stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a
&gt; tree branch 25 feet in the air.
&gt; Congratulations gentlemen, you win...
