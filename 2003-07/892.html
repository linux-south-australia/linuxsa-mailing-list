&gt;Yes, evolution has holes, but then so does every other theory. However,
&gt;the bulk of evidence does in fact fit the evolutionary model quite well
&gt;(note I didn't say ALL the evidence), and as such, it's currently the
&gt;best model we have.

&gt;Having said that, if we just accepted it as the only model, science
&gt;would not progress. The way of science is to postulate a theory and at
&gt;some later stage when more facts are known, change that theory or throw
&gt;it out and postulate a new theory that better fits the known evidence.

that's a good way of looking at it.  if one we're to consider an intelligent
designer that would mean that we have to answer to the designer for our
actions.  it seems that evolution is an attempt to explain how we got here
with having to answer to a 'higher being' as you so nicely put it.

&gt;However, the beauty of human existence is that we have free thought and
&gt;the ability to choose what we believe.  Thus, if some people want to
&gt;believe we exist because a higher being thought it would be a good
&gt;idea, good on them, but it doesn't mean that other people who want to
&gt;believe something else are wrong, after all, there is no definitive
&gt;proof either way.

so following that train of thought, nobody is right and nobody is wrong,
it's what you believe for yourself that matters?  fair enough.  so why is it
wrong for Martin Bryant to go and mow down a stack of people in cold blood?
if everyones belief is neither right nor wrong, surely there are no
absolutes.  it's all relative to what i believe or what Martin Bryant
believes is right for him to do.  (he's just a name i picked for auguments
sake, btw).

anyway i seem to have gotten way off topic on this list, and i apologize.
we'll continue it off list if your interested....

back to linux.....

Regards
Matthew
