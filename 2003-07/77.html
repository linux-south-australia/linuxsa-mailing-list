Hmm i must have missed that in the original conversation.  i do apologize,
but i still don't believe you explained how you do it?    i just re-read all
the posts from

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/thread_2.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/thread_2.html</A>

you and managed to understand that it was doing 'Basic Authentication' from
the post
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/822.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/822.html</A>

this was good but i didn't fathom a solution.

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/894.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/894.html</A> said don't do name
lookups after.  good good.  i agree  :)


<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/841.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-06/841.html</A> was the post which
you sent me but i still can't see how to do it?    should i be RTFM or what?
i've been doing that until i'm blue in the face.  :)

If the answer is somewhere there i missed it.  or perhaps the transparant
auth only works with win9x and we run 2k/XP (only a guess from that ident
software thing)

care to explain to this little doofus how you got it to work???

thanks
Matthew
