I missed your original message, but I must object to your claim that BSD
licence imposes no obligations on licensees who which to redistribute.
BSD imposes obligations (inclusion of a notice), but different ones
to GPL.

&gt; But what about the licensor...?  After having gone into the detail
&gt; you've expressed above, what, exactly, is the GPL doing for YOU, as
&gt; the author of the code?

It encourages joint development in a way that the BSD licence doesn't.
I can build a half-arsed widget, and if someone else wants to build the
other half, and to make it freely available, then it doesn't really make
any difference what free licence is used.  However if they're not quite
decided whether or not they want to make their effort freely available
then GPL nudges them in one way and BSD doesn't.

&gt; I think
&gt; there's a lot of dishonesty in the "free software" and "open source"
&gt; world.  Just about everyone runs around talking about how selfless they
&gt; are by creating all this software off the sweat of their brows, 
&gt; pouring blood, sweat and tears into it for little or no financial
&gt; reward.

Perhaps the claim of selflessness might sometimes be exaggerated, but
there's no question that they put in effort for little or no financial
reward.  There are many projects started where the original developers
obviously don't have the skill to pull off the end result.  I suppose
at least some of them were GPLed because those same original developers
just wanted the final result; and that's not entirely selfless.  But
I think the majority of GPL their projects to guarantee the freedom.
Is that selfish?


&gt; if they were *REALLY* selfless they wouldn't have a problem
&gt; with someone else taking those "gifts" and making a buck off them if
&gt; they thought it was worth making a go of it.

The GPL doesn't stop you making a buck off someone else's gifts.  You
and I are both perfectly entitled to demand any amount we like for
passing, say, GIMP, to a third person.  The BSD is what you use to
deny someone else the right to make a buck.
