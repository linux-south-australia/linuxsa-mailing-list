&gt; 
&gt; This is better than asking in the mailing list as you'll need to drum
&gt; up helpers as well as information.  The mailing list you need is
&gt; linux-hams.
&gt; 
&gt; It's also a good time to talk with the ACA.  They have "band plans"
&gt; that allocate spectrum and licensing conditions for various uses of
&gt; radio.  You need to know what bands and licensing apply to your
&gt; project.
&gt; 
&gt; These are likely to be stricter than you expect.  A 5W HF transmitter
&gt; can cause world-wide interference, so use of the long-haul HF
&gt; frequencies is very tightly controlled.
&gt; 
&gt; Your project also partly replicates the work of School of the Air and
&gt; Royal Flying Doctor Service, so you should also chat with those
&gt; organisations.  People won't regard as cheap an option that involves
&gt; the purchase of a second HF transceiver.
&gt; 
&gt; Codan and Barrett make most of the HF transceivers used for SOTA and
&gt; RFDS.  Their top-end kit offers a e-mail option.  So an alternative
&gt; strategy might be to work with manufacturers to get e-mail as
&gt; inexpensive option across their HF product range.
&gt; 
&gt; In the US, Volunteers in Technical Assistance have already got a
&gt; field-deployable HF Internet solution, see "Low-Cost Digital and
&gt; Packet Radio Techniques: Operation and Applications" which is a USTTI
&gt; training course and a PACT book.  Try and find the person that wrote
&gt; these -- you can't write either without learning a lot and making a
&gt; lot of contacts.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not clear what fixed installation HF Internet is useful for in
&gt; the long run if satelite costs keep dropping. You'll need an answer to
&gt; that before you get too much further.

Thanks Glen

For a rough idea of what I am thinking about, please see:
<A HREF="http://www.wetlandecosystems.com.au/index.php?page">http://www.wetlandecosystems.com.au/index.php?page</A>=48

It is an article in the current renew magazine describing how they have
provided email to areas without phone lines. It is an interesting
project, but the costs are around US$7k, which seems over the top. I
instantly thought of how OSS, donated hardware and some interested
people could bring this down to reasonable levels.

Thanks again

Shaun Branden
