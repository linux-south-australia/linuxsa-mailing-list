&gt;&lt;angry rant&gt;
&gt;
Yesterday was my day to drive home from Los Angeles and back to work 
today.  Its a 5 hour drive, and I usually feel that its a waste of time 
unless I can learn someything during the trip. In doing so, I usually 
pick up an audio version of a book, and this time I picked up the audio 
version of "Sunburned Country" by Bill Bryson.

Before I heard this tape, I had a great admiration of Australia, and I 
have even more now. Believe me, it would be an honor to be countrymen 
with you all. But at the same time, I have too much faith in the people 
I exchange emails with every day, to believe that the situation could 
ever become as David Mosler describes.

&gt;Look at how the South Australian government just bowed
&gt;
Ah, but look at how America's State of Oregon just bowed down to America....

doh!

I really truely believed that the bill would fail because of its 
wording.  It mandated open source.  I think it's failing has little to 
do with Australia's supposed bowing down.

&gt;to the ISC and practically denounced Open Source as "crap", or more accurately (and I quote) "[not] 
&gt;suitable for fundamental business functions" -- i.e. they are just towing the 
&gt;US Corporate lines.
&gt;
The ISC will use whatever tactic they feel appropriate for the political 
situation. I say throw the "South Australian government just bowed" 
belief in with the rest of the rubbish, and it will never be heard of 
again. Embrase it and it will haunt you.

When I first heard of the ISC's strategy for South Australia, I thought 
that it was pretty damn weak. Australians have fought against harsh 
weather and an unfamiliar environment to create one of the best 
countries to live on Earth, including Brittian.

Given that impresssive track record, I wonder why AU needs US trade at all.

&gt;Looking at the various bills being introduced there it looks like there's a 
&gt;good chance of America becoming (even more of) a police state. 
&gt;
Yes, and this is awful in my book.  If we had Bill Clinton back, I think 
this would be less of an issue.

&gt; P.S: No offence intended to American citizens reading :)


You know none is. :-)

BTW - Do you shop at Bullocks? :-D

&gt;&gt; AUSTRALIA has been urged to seriously consider becoming the

&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
I wonder _who_ urged this?

&gt;&gt; And American-born historian Dr David Mosler told a Brisbane
&gt;&gt; audience yesterday there was a 20 per cent chance of
&gt;&gt; Australia becoming an American state in the next 50 years.
&gt;&gt;
He sounds like Howard Stern, a radio star that makes ratings by being a 
"shock jock." He says a great many outrageous things just to get a rise 
out of people.

&gt;&gt; The visiting research fellow at Adelaide University, who has
&gt;&gt; lived in Australia since 1971, said the chances would
&gt;&gt; increase significantly in the event of a major Al-Qaeda
&gt;&gt; attack on Australia or if Indonesia became a fundamentalist
&gt;&gt; Islamic republic.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
I believe that Al-Quada's attack was one of theatrics, and probably the 
most that they could muster. Surely they could have rented out an office 
or two in the World Trade Center and done as much damage.

In my book, Al-Quada are not impressive. In fact, I feel that we have 
dome more damage to ourselves in responding to the attack, than was done 
by the September 11 attackers.  They probably were hoping for us to self 
destruct, expecting that we would not hold true to the beliefs of our 
founding fathers:

"Those willing to give up a little liberty for a little security deserve 
neither security nor liberty. " Ben Franklin

"Give me liberty or give me death" - Patrick Henry

Instead we traded away our freedoms in the U.S. instead of insisting 
that the airports be kept open, and that a steel door should be placed 
between an airplane pilot and its passengers.

There is no reason why Australia should overreact as we did.
