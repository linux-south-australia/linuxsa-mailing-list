I have not been using linux for that long, still quite a newbie in many areas, 
and I've run into something odd.
I have two partitions in ext3 for linux (as well as a linux swap, and several 
FAT partitions)
df appears to show that space I should have on the linux partitions is missing

<A HREF="mailto:root@littleone">root@littleone</A>:~# df
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda7              1416040   1280996     61952  96% /
/dev/hdb2               904120    852208      5244 100% /usr/local

there's about 70Mb missing from root, and about 50 from /usr/local. obviously, 
I dont have a lot of space space, so that 120Mb would be quite useful.

I first noticed this after trying to compile kopete, it failed and locked the 
system, I had to hit reset. as I suspected, it had used up all the space, and 
not liked running out. when I reloaded, I had a number of messages about 
inodes being freed, which I suspect is what's happened, I have tried, 
es2fsck, but since the system loads programs from /usr/local, I can't umount, 
and es2fsck complains about it being mounted. I considered cfdisk, which I 
figure the expert option might allow me to get space back, but I dont want to 
mess around without knowing what I'm doing.

any suggestions or pointers would be appreciated
Adam
