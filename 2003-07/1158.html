 &gt; 
 &gt; I think you're quite free to release the value you add to a GPL program
 &gt; under any licence you want, just so long as you don't try to change the
 &gt; licence conditions of the original GPL base.  By all means, take a GPL
 &gt; program, make some changes, and release just those lines of code under a
 &gt; BSD or proprietary or public domain licence, as you want. 

No, David, that's just bullshit.  Have a read of section 2(b) of the GPL
to see what's *really* permitted under that license.  Any work which "... in
whole or part [...] is derived from the Program or any part thereof [is] to
be licensed [...] under the terms of this License."

If I come up with (say) a bugfix for the Linux kernel, that bugfix may
not be distributed under any license except the GPL.

Section 2(b) is invoked if I "distribute or publish" my work - which 
includes emailing my patch to Linus.

 &gt; But why would
 &gt; you think it's okay for you to release the lines you didn't change under
 &gt; any new licence?  That's just theft, isn't it?

We're speaking ENGLISH here, aren't we David?

 &gt; &gt; Nothing on god's green earth can restrict access to the original
 &gt; &gt; un-enhanced code, whether it's BSD or GPL.  So no part of this argument
 &gt; &gt; is about "restricting access", despite your rather unfortunate misuse
 &gt; &gt; of words above.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Many examples have been described of how a commercial fork can kill off
 &gt; the original free source,

Sorry, that's just more bullshit David.  The only examples provided have
been of software which has been forked, and the fork has been sufficiently
good that nobody has been bothered to maintain the original code base
anymore.

Maybe I'm nuts, but I can't see a problem with that.  If nobody *cares*
and the open-source codebase falls into disrepair, doesn't that just mean
it's a dead project, like all the countless other dead projects out there
that are covered by all manner of licenses (including the GPL)?

Furthermore, doesn't the example shown by PostgreSQL and BSD itself show
that when the non-free fork stops suiting peoples' needs, the free codebase
resurrects itself as a renewed project and continues anew?  Let's face
it, how much 4.3BSD development was carried out while SunOS 4.x was king?
But as soon as it lost its shine, we got FreeBSD.  Do you think that was
coincidence?

So I'm not "brushing off" your many examples (both of 'em!  Count 'em, TWO!).
I'm dismissing them as irrelevent.  Big difference.

 &gt; &gt; That's why the only people on the planet which the GPL inhibits are
 &gt; &gt; software developers.
 &gt; 
 &gt; ... are commercial software developers.

&lt;shrug&gt;  Say what you want, but I'm not a commercial software developer, 
and I won't contribute to a GPL project.  You've heard other non-commercial
developers in this thread say the same thing.

(oh yeah, while you're dissing commercial software developers, spend a 
moment thinking about the number of FreeBSD contributors which Apple
employs on their staff...)
