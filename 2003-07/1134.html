About a month ago I went out and bought an 80 gig HD for my desktop computer 
and partitioned it with SuSE Linux during the installation.

I ended up with this configuration:

/dev/hda1 Windows 2000 (10GB) FAT32
/dev/hda2 FreeBSD 5 (10GB) FreeBSD native
/dev/hda3  [1]Plan9 (10GB) Plan9 file system
/dev/hda4 (Extended, includes all of the below)
/dev/hda5 SuSE LInux 8.2 (10GB) - Reiser
/dev/hda6 Red Hat Linux 9 (10GB) - Reiser
/dev/hda7 Mandrake 9.1 (10GB) - Reiser
/dev/hda8 Lindows 4, beta 3 (10GB) - Reiser
/dev/hda9 Linux swap (314MB) - Swap
/dev/hda10 - used for storage (6.3GB) - FAT32

I have a list of things I want to do in FreeBSD:

1. Run startx automatically before I log in
2. Upgrade to kde3
3. Add Reiser support
4. Get the lpd to start automatically
5. "Port" over my Netwhere IPX client
6. Run a Samba client
7. Install Winex
8. Install Cross Over Office
9. Figure out what's wrong with my screen colors - they are slightly off
10. Set up a network printer
11. Set up cups & autostart
12. Learn how to easily upgrade without having to download a CD
13. Replace vi with emacs for an editor - I am a horrible typist.

# 1 - I'll google search, but the answers are not clear and perhaps 
conflicting
# 2 - I went to <A HREF="http://freebsd.kde.org/instructions.php">http://freebsd.kde.org/instructions.php</A>#upgrade3 but 
portupgrade did not work. It says that it can't find a directory called 
/usr/ports/portupgrade. I know its not there, because I looked.  What am I 
missing here?
So I went to <A HREF="http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/">http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/</A> and tried to type in the command  
"PACKAGESITE: 
<A HREF="http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/">http://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/</A> 
<A HREF="ftp://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/">ftp://rabarber.fruitsalad.org/packages/3.1.2_rc5/4-STABLE/Latest/</A> "and it 
said "PACKAGESITE command not found.
# 3 - Seems like Reiser is a GPL file system and therefore not supported ?
# 4 - I am probably going to edit rc.local
# 5 - Looks like there is a mature level of IPX support in FreeBSD. Of course 
the commands are different than in Linux, but it looks like shell commands 
could be used to set this up. It seems that kernel support needs to be in 
there, but I don't know how to determine this easily. Next I would need ncpfs 
for FreeBSD, [perhaps ncplogin(?)] but I can't find that package in the 
Freebsd ftp site from sysinstall. I haven't tried pkg_add ncpfs yet. I have 
Mars-nwe installed.  There were some emails I found on the internet that said 
that ipx and ncp options had to be added to the kernel. I could probably use 
Grog's book to figure out how to build a custom kernel. Hard to sort out what 
is needed and what isn't. The man page for mount_nwfs that I found on the 
Internet doesn't say what packages have to be installed for it to actually 
work. That's my main gripe about man pages in general. It refers to an 
ncplogin command.
# 6 - I am going to try to set up NFS or search for a samba client for BSD
# 7 - I am going to try to compile winex from source
# 8 - I think I have an ice's chance in hades of doing this
# 9 - I will probably just copy over my xfree86config-4 file from SuSE on a 
floppy, and modify it so it smells like a bsd file.
#10 - Maybe Grog's new book will have an answer
#11 - I think I have an ice's chance in hades of doing this
#12 - I think I have an ice's chance in hades of doing this
#13 - I found a reference to setenv EDITOR ee. I modified this and typed 
setenv EDITOR emacs at the shell but Mutt still comes up with vi.
