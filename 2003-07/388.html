Michael,

&gt; You will find at everything will be less laggy if you set your 
&gt; maximum bandwidth to just below your ADSL's bandwidth, this prevents 
&gt; your routers HUUUUGE buffers from having to be used. It makes your 

Yeah, the wondershaper documentation states this.  The main problem I was
having was that **no** QoS or iptables marking rules seemed to be doing
anything under my newly compiled 2.4.21 kernel (heh, I typo'ed 2.2.21, d'oh).
 Once I got that working, I could instantly see the result from running the
default wondershaper script, and what I have now is essentially a hacked
wondershaper script, with some of mmc's stuff in there as well, with my own
additions (mainly shaping every other IP on my network, apart from mine, to
128/32 &lt;big evil grin&gt;).

(I've found the best option for me for the wondershaper stuff was 3/4 my real
bandwidth - I'm on 512/128, so it's set to 385/96 off memory.  If I download
one file at once, the download speed is about 5-10kb/sec slower - however,
pings aren't really affected, and interactive traffic is snappy as hell.  I
can also download multiple files at once, where the total added download rates
are almost twice as high as they could be before! [previously, one download
would drown out the rest]).

&gt; BTW was this thread previously Re: more wireless talk ...sec: unclassified.
&gt; 
&gt; Because I posted about lartc.org a couple of days ago... Kratzy, the 
&gt; default Wondershaper will speed your ssh right up.

Didn't see that, and it was a seperate thread I started.  I've known about
wondershaper for quite sometime, but I've always used OpenBSD for QoS boxes
(QoS machines I've built in the past have been dedicated machines, only doing
routing & QoS, and I generally always use BSD for this task).

(QoS rocks!)

&gt; Cheers - yeah, I will also packet shape based on IP; it's the way 
&gt; I've done things in the past on openbsd.  Still, making ssh less 
&gt; laggy regardless would be A Good Thing.
&gt; 
&gt; I came across "dsl_qos_queue" as well 
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.sonicspike.net/software/">http://www.sonicspike.net/software/</A>), which looks quite interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; Thing is, I'm running 2.4.21 - and random strange things were happening
&gt; (i.e.
&gt; some of my ipfilter lines were listed, but didn't actually seem to be
&gt; working).  I just rebooted back into an older 2.4.19 without all the 
&gt; QoS stuff I need, and I'm not experiencing these problems.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm.
&gt; 
&gt; A bug in 2.4.21 or the version of iproute in Debian (which is dated 
&gt; 2001, oddly) perhaps?  (Or more likely, I kludged the 2.2.21 compile).
