&gt;
&gt; &gt; what I'd like is a license where my work, as code, is made
&gt; &gt; available in
&gt; &gt; projects that use it (or more than a certain percent, maybe,
&gt; &gt; if someone
&gt; &gt; copies a dozen lines from my 50MB project, I doubt I'd care),
&gt; &gt; but whatever
&gt; &gt; anyone else adds, they can distribute as they like, for
&gt; &gt; however much money
&gt; &gt; they like. provided they don't limit accesss to my work.
&gt;
&gt; sounds like BSD to me... or Artistic...

I went to look, and Artistic may offer what I want, I'm going to do the 
research now, and read (or at least skim) a whole bunch of different ones, to 
see what might do me

&gt; BTW: if you want, you can multiply licence it... No matter what, as
&gt; copyright holder, you retain full rights to your own work. You can GPL it,
&gt; and also add to it and sell for $ as closed source if you want, as long as
&gt; you don't take other people's GPL code and sell that as part of your closed
&gt; source. The complication comes when you have more than one copyright
&gt; holder.

no matter what, unless I sell the rights, or I'm working for some company that 
demands the rights to all of your work while you're there...
but multiple licenses may help out too, I'll look at that. 

&gt; &gt; I haven't really looked at all the licenses out there, but
&gt; &gt; none of the ones
&gt; &gt; I've read about seem to come close.
&gt;
&gt; I can't see where the BSD license fails you here?

Preferably, my code should all be available as source, or reference given to 
where one can obtain the source, as I read the BSD, people can compile it how 
they like and distribute that, without making the original code available.
Also, even if it is in source, anyone else can distribute a modified version, 
with the same name as my project, which I'm cautious about.
