&gt;... but you're interested in *other peoples'* work.  
&gt;
&gt;That's the major reason why developers use the GPL:  They're selfish.
&gt;Yet they claim they're making a wonderous, no-strings-attached, *FREE* 
&gt;gift to humanity.  Hypocrites.

But what of the synergy (the whole is greater than the sum of it's 
parts) between the two contributions - this is subjective property that 
is set up between the contributions that would logically belong to both 
contributors.

The problem here is that with the BSD style of licensing, the original 
author, while not losing ownership of his original code, gives up any 
claim to the synergy created between the two contributions - which is 
derived from both. It is biased towards the second contributor. They can 
charge a price that is acceptable for the whole of the product, while 
only developing one of the parts of it.

What the GPL allows is for you to say is; any synergy created between 
mine and others contributions should remain available to me, and anyone 
else who wants to use or contribute to it. Granted, it also forces the 
second contributor into the same license, but that is hardly an issue - 
if you don't like the idea, don't "accept the license" and develop your 
own application from scratch and license it how you want. It at least 
gives equal rights to both contributors.
