&gt; &gt; When you start proving God it ceases to be religion and becomes science;

&gt; &gt; My point, which I hope is now clear, is that Christendom's belief is
&gt; &gt; intrinsic (you are not allowed to question the dogma), whereas science
&gt; &gt; has no belief, merely unproven theories.  And science expects you to
&gt; &gt; question everything.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is wildly inaccurate to say that Christian belief is
&gt; "intrinsic" and "you are not allowed to question the dogma".  That might
&gt; be the case for some Churches and denominations (or perhaps your
&gt; experience with "religion"?), however that has nothing to do with
&gt; Christianity or my faith.  My faith has been largely strengthened by
&gt; evidence, mainly archaeological and historical in nature and by
&gt; analyzing, questioning, seeking, exploring and investigating.

This is very good. Please continue to do this ...
 
&gt; In fact I know of two authors off the top of my head, that went from
&gt; being staunch Atheists to committed Christians through the process of
&gt; trying to disprove the resurrection of Jesus, (Look up Josh McDowell or
&gt; Lee Strobel if you want to know specifics).  There is an insurmountable
&gt; pile of evidence to support the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus
&gt; Christ.

As a teenager, I was a Catholic Alter Boy. For the last 20 years I have 
been a non-theist. Will you accept my personal experiences as evidence 
that Evolution is the one and only true way(tm)?

I certainly hope not. I can only hope that you will develop higher 
standards of evidence that those you have offered so far.

Moreover, the 'insurmountable pile of evidence' you have offered is, when 
looked at dispassionately, worse that the evidence we have for the 
existence of Caesar, and in his case, the whole Roman Senate attested that 
he ascended to heaven on his death. What better evidence could you have?

&gt; The great thing about Truth is that it will stand up to scrutiny.

To bring this back to Open Source and Linux, is the fact that I used to 
work a lot with Linux, and I now work professionaly on FreeBSD (although 
our file system client also works under Linux) good evidence that FreeBSD 
is better?
