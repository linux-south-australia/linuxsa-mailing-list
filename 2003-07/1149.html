&gt; &gt; However, the point Mark was making was that he thinks it wouldn't 
&gt; &gt; affect any non-developers at all if Linux was relicensed under the 
&gt; &gt; Berkley license. This would not change who owns the copyright, only 
&gt; &gt; the terms under which the source may be used by 
&gt; non-copyright holders.

David Newall replied:
&gt; I think it would affect Linux.  I could forsee, were Linux 
&gt; BSD'ed, that a company, probably not Microsoft but one like 
&gt; them, would take Linux and corporatise it.  They'd start by 
&gt; making big aesthetic improvements to their Linux, perhaps 
&gt; giving back, perhaps not.  Later they'd stop giving 
&gt; improvements, because that would be their strategic 
&gt; advantage, and hey, it's all Linux, isn't it, so how does it hurt?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, it would hurt when that company started making 
&gt; incompatible changes to their Linux.  They'd do that, at 
&gt; their convenience, once they'd picked up a commanding market 
&gt; share.  Then  we'd have Linux and Linux, and they wouldn't 
&gt; interoperate, and one would be a lovely, shining system that 
&gt; 'everybody' uses, and the other would be this old system, 
&gt; which fewer and fewer developers used as a primary 
&gt; development platform, and hence fewer and fewer applications 
&gt; would run on.
&gt; 
&gt; This happened with gated.

So this would be almost the same as what Apple is doing to FreeBSD, right?
