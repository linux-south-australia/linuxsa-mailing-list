Hi All.

I have encountered a strange problem recently with my RH9.0 installation
and I'm wondering if anybody might be able to point me in the right
direction.

I recently changed over to a vanilla kernel (2.4.21) from Redhat's
kernel (2.4.20-18.9), so that I could patch the kernel with the ACPI
diff's, to get ACPI going with my mainboard.

Anyway, that all went swimmingly and all was well until I tried to
launch Gimp.  For some reason the Gimp startup box stalled with
half-drawn text in it and failed to go any further.  If I killed gimp
and then started it again, it would get a little further along the
startup process and stop again.  If I repeated this process another 2
times, it would eventually load OK.  I could then close down Gimp and
reload it and it would come straight up OK.  However if I closed down
the X-Windows session and restarted it, I would need to go through this
process again in order to get Gimp to run.  Very strange!!

Anyway, I ran strace on gimp and below is the last few lines of output
from strace when it freezes up on loading the first time:

gettimeofday({1059292239, 875342}, NULL) = 0
gettimeofday({1059292239, 875392}, NULL) = 0
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN}, {fd=4, events=POLLIN}], 2, 0) = 0
gettimeofday({1059292239, 875540}, NULL) = 0
gettimeofday({1059292239, 875585}, NULL) = 0
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN}, {fd=4, events=POLLIN}], 2, 0) = 0
write(3, "8\0\4\0\7\0\200\2\0@\0\0\271\0\200\2Ke\5\0j\0\200\2\7\0"...,

ioctl(3, FIONREAD, [0])                 = 0
poll([{fd=3, events=POLLIN}, {fd=4, events=POLLIN}], 2, 0) = 0
write(3, "+\0\1\0", 4)                  = 4
read(3, 0xbffff730, 32)                 = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL)        = 1 (in [3])
read(3, "\n\3O\2\5\0\200\2\0\0\0\0\0\0@\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\310\365"...,
32) = 32
read(3, 0xbffff730, 32)                 = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL

I'm no programmer and I don't know enough about the inner workings of
the code to be able to interpret this into anything meaningful.

Anyway, the really odd thing is that if I go back to the Redhat
2.4.20-18.9 kernel, all is well.  This problem only occurs if I run the
vanilla kernel.  I should point out that I used Redhat's config files as
the basis of the configuration for the vanilla kernel, so the kernel
config is identical to the Redhat one, barring the extra ACPI stuff.  So
I tried turning the ACPI related options off, to see if that was the
cause, but the problem with Gimp still occurred.  I even tried
downloading and installing the vanilla 2.4.20 kernel, in case it was a
2.4.20 -&gt; 2.4.21 oddity.. still no go.  The only way I can get Gimp to
load first time is to run the Redhat kernel.

I should also note I can customise the Redhat kernel using Redhat's
source, and this works fine also.  The problem seems to be caused by
something Redhat have done to their kernel source that I'm not doing to
the vanilla kernel.  I thought it was strange, however, that this would
effect the running of X Windows apps.  I have also noticed certain
operations in Open Office now causes it to freeze, which again doesn't
happen under the Redhat kernel, so Gimp is really just an convenient way
of replicating the fault.  However I believe that whatever is causing
this problem is effecting other XWindows apps other than Gimp.

The only other bit of information that I came across (having no idea if
it's relevant) was I noticed this difference in the XFree86 log files,
when booting between the two Kernels:

Under Redhat's 2.4.20-18.9 Kernel:
(II) PCI: stages = 0x03, oldVal1 = 0x8000fb40, mode1Res1 = 0x80000000

Under Vanilla 2.4.21 Kernel:
(II) PCI: stages = 0x03, oldVal1 = 0x00000000, mode1Res1 = 0x80000000

I'm not sure, again, if this could be the cause of the trouble but it
was the only difference I could detect in the XFree86 side of things.

I have done extensive searching on all of the above issues on the Net
and turned up nothing.  I guess not too many folk use vanilla kernels
with Redhat distro's.  It would be OK if I could apply the ACPI patch to
the Redhat kernel but it fails, I assume, thanks to other patches/mods
Redhat must apply.

If anybody has any ideas about how I could troubleshoot this further, I
would be most grateful.  I really don't want to have to run Redhat's own
"Doctored" kernel in order to get apps to start up/operate cleanly but I
just don't possess enough programming oriented skills to be able to
start troubleshooting the problem using the strace output I'm getting.

Many thanks,

Cheers,
Graham
