Initial Assessment: Fact
Current Assessment: Hype
Threat: Medium-Low ( There is a near constant level of defacement 
activity on the Internet. A marginal contest is unlikely to influence 
this activity significantly. ) 
Vulnerability Prevalence: Medium ( There are many vulnerable, poorly 
maintained web servers on the Net that represent "low hanging fruit" 
who become defacement victims. Sites with a comprehensive security 
program are at very low risk and a contest to deface web sites is 
unlikely to change their risk profile. ) 
Cost: Medium ( The chief cost of a defacement is damage to image and 
reputation. ) 

Summary:
A single source in the hacker underground announced "The Defacement 
Challenge" to be held on July 6, 2003. Unfortunately, one security 
services provider and today, the Department of Homeland Security have 
seized upon this marginal, fringe effort and given it far more 
publicity than it deservers. Attackers who deface websites have their 
own motivation for committing computer crime. Security professionals 
promoting a contest among these criminals only provides additional 
impetus for their actions and is counterproductive to a goal of 
reducing risks on the Internet. 

TruSecure's IS/Recon has been monitoring the hacker underground for 
nearly ten years. This contest was invisible in the underground. No one 
cared. "Chatter" in the underground for the contest picked up only in 
the last 36 hours, after "responsible" security officials began 
promoting this contest. Those who are responsible for promoting 
security have instead contributed to increased risk for some web sites 
by drawing media attention to what would otherwise have been an 
insignificant, fringe effort, probably by one person. 


Cheers,  Ian
