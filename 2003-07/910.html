&gt; This claim is interesting for a couple of reasons:

&gt;   1. The scientific theory of evolution does not deal with how the
&gt;      universe began or how the solar system got here or how the
&gt;      very first thing that could be called life arose. Those are
&gt;      the subjects of other areas of study, including abiogenesis.

Well I guess we could argue definitions here.  We are talking evolution
aren't we??  Does that not include the evolution of the universe?  Which
encompasses the big bang theory??  I never said "Charles Darwin's Theory
of Evolution". 

&gt;   2. A number of popular explanations for how things began posit that
&gt;      one or more gods were involved. These explanations (sometimes
&gt;      called myths) leave out all the interesting details, which, to 
&gt;      any sentient entity, is just totally unsatisfactory.

The point I'm trying to make here is that accepting the "big bang"
theory is as much a belief as Christianity is, to the extent that it
relies on the unexplained.  My objection stems from the fact that the
Big Bang is often used as the scientific answer to the creation of the
universe when in fact it does not address that question.

&gt; So, where did this 'creator' come from. Please explain why we must posit a 
&gt; creator, who was not itself created?

Well indeed.. I'll ask him when I die :)

&gt; Ahhhh, now I understand. You don't actually know much about the theory of 
&gt; evolution.

Well I think that's a bit harsh.  Whilst I don't have a degree in the
matter, I do have a good basic understanding and I have done a
reasonable amount of my own research into the matter.  I was surprised
to find how many text books contain "findings" that have since been
found to be wild speculation and largely unsubstantiated claims.

Cheers,
Graham
