Disk smith make a small UHF cb which has extra channels that allow you to
talk between the units on which are not normally used by others. They are
low wattage so would have a small range.
Pressing a combination of 2 buttons produces a tone to the other units on
the same channel, and pressing the talk of course allows you to talk...
Put this in a case with an external mic and a label press to talk and
another wired to the key combo labelled push to page.. And it should all
work sweet

I have one some where if ya need the model and there is a web site for it...
It might be a uniden but not sure

Subject: [OT] two way radios


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Anyone here know much about CB radios? I don't.
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to set one up as a wireless mobile intercom system, with a
publicly
&gt; accessible (statically located) station and multiple handsets. The
publicly
&gt; accessible one needs to be dead simple -- press this button to get
&gt; attention, and then talk to the voice. If someone needed to hold down a
&gt; button to talk, that would also be ok, but less than ideal. I don't want
&gt; them to have the ability to change channel, volume, turn it off, or
anything
&gt; like that. The handsets should also be simple, but simplicity isn't as
high
&gt; a priority, as they would have regular users who would know not to touch
the
&gt; other buttons :)
&gt;
&gt; The range would only need to be a few hundred metres, but would have to go
&gt; through buildings (three-four stories, multiple brick/stone/besserblock
&gt; walls, steel door and window frames, etc). The public station would need
to
&gt; run on mains power, and the others should be chargable while switched on.
&gt; Lastly, we don't want to have to get a license of any sort, and nor do we
&gt; want to pay more than $500 or so for 5 nodes. (node seems the wrong word
for
&gt; this technology...)
&gt;
&gt; The purpose for this system is like a combination intercom/doorbell system
&gt; for a residential college. We want visitors to be able to press a button
to
&gt; get attention, and then immediately be able to talk to some staff member
who
&gt; can help them. We want the staff member to be able to move freely around
the
&gt; college, yet remain contactable. We don't need it for regular
communications
&gt; between staff or residents -- we have an internal phone system for that.
We
&gt; also don't need to be able to initiate contact with the public station
from
&gt; the handsets.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, my questions to those who know stuff (please reply offlist):
&gt;
&gt; 1) Can you get equipment that would suit a publicly accessible application
&gt; like the above? All the equipment I've seen appears to have a separate
&gt; microphone, and would be suited to in-car or on-desk installation for
&gt; someone who knows how to use it, but not for J Random Visitor. It would be
&gt; possible, I suppose, for us to custom-fabricate an enclosure of sorts,
&gt; perhaps even for a handheld device, but it would be better if there was
&gt; something like this ready-made.
&gt;
&gt; 2) What happens when there's someone else on your channel? We don't really
&gt; want to find ourselves being called by couriers every five minutes, but
need
&gt; to be able to tell if someone's at the publicly accessible station easily
&gt; (we're in North Adelaide, so I suspect there'd be likely to be more
activity
&gt; than you'd find in your average suburb).
&gt;
&gt; 3) Has anyone implemented anything like this?
&gt;
&gt; TIA
&gt;
