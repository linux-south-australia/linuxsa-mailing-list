List,
Someone has asked me for help - in truth it's beyond me so im asking here
on his behalf.

A friend is having the following problem and would love to get it fixed if
possible, heres the details :) 

He is running the following on the webserver: red hat 6.3 / clark connect
1.3 (the product is called clark connect 1.3)
His LAN Boxes are all windows machines.

This guy is running a LAN cafe place, and has a box setup that hosts email.
He has a domain ( www.iplay.co.nz ) which talks to his webserver at the cafe.

At the cafe the IP is 192.168.1.x. He wants it so ANY request (either
coming from the LAN NIC or the WAN NIC of the server ON PORT 3000, the
webmail port)
will be redirected to a specific IP and PORT (another server, the webmail
server as opposed to the website server).

Requests comming from the www on www.iplay.co.nz:3000 DO redirect as
needed. Requests comming the LAN on the domain www.iplay.co.nz:3000 do NOT
redirect, which is the problem. 
Using the LAN IP of the server however (192.168.1.x:3000) DOES work, the
problem is, he just wants the one "loing to webmail" 
link on his homepage, not two separate links depending on if you are
in/outside of the LAN cafe. 

Please also note that LAN users *CAN* visit www.iplay.co.nz by typing that
domain in on the LAN (and visit the website), however, visiting the site
with :3000 appended to the end does not work.

In summary, he wants www.iplay.co.nz:3000 to redirect to the appropriate
server, reguardless if the request is comming from INSIDE or OUTSIDE the
LAN (the server has 2 NIC cards, one for www/WAN and one for LAN 
communication).

Can you ask your tech buds/yourself how to setup this redirection? He had
it working originally, but is now broken after he removed the old redirect
stuff because the 
server changed IP, he added new ones and now its broken.

Please if you can find out whats wrong it will be much appreciated. 

Any suggestions welcom
I suggested the host entyr etc but I dont know if it helped.

regards
evan
