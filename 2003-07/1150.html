I think you're quite free to release the value you add to a GPL program
under any licence you want, just so long as you don't try to change the
licence conditions of the original GPL base.  By all means, take a GPL
program, make some changes, and release just those lines of code under a
BSD or proprietary or public domain licence, as you want.  But why would
you think it's okay for you to release the lines you didn't change under
any new licence?  That's just theft, isn't it?


&gt; We're only talking about enhancements here (i.e., new gifts), not
&gt; the original code.

We're not talking about new gifts.  We're talking about stealing someone
else's gift.



&gt; Nothing on god's green earth can restrict access to the original
&gt; un-enhanced code, whether it's BSD or GPL.  So no part of this argument
&gt; is about "restricting access", despite your rather unfortunate misuse
&gt; of words above.

Many examples have been described of how a commercial fork can kill off
the original free source, and you brush that off as, well, you call it
advancing the state of art, or providing an improved gift, or commercial
advantage.  In fact it's none of those.  It's stealing a base and then
killing it off.  It's happened before, it'll happen again.  That isn't
necessarily an evil thing to do, but don't pretend that it's in any way
a gift or free because that result is clearly and undisputably not free.


&gt; That's why the only people on the planet which the GPL inhibits are
&gt; software developers.

... are commercial software developers.


&gt; Sorry, but the Great Socialist Experiment has failed, and it has been
&gt; proved throughout the world that "everyone" doesn't in fact benefit 
&gt; from what you're talking about.

More people benefit from GPL than from BSD.


&gt;&gt; why? only because you also are releasing that software under the GPL?
&gt;&gt; how is that expensive? surely it is the same as releasing the same
&gt;&gt; code under a BSD style licence?
&gt;
&gt; Only if your view of "expensive" is restricted to money.

Most people in this world, the very vast majority of them, are so poor
that their view of expensive is restricted to money.  The have to use
obsolete old computers that were given to them by rich people, and
there's no way they can afford software "gifts" that cost money.


&gt;&gt; i do think that the "freedoms" the BSD style licences give you
&gt;&gt; are quite overrated.
&gt;
&gt; They're the freedoms which have allowed hundreds of products to be
&gt; built on the FreeBSD platform which haven't been built on the Linux
&gt; platform

Surely more software is available for Linux than for BSD.
