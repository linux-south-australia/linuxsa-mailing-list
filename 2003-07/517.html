When I put this report up on several of the CompuServe Forums I got 
back some interesting responses, many more than I got from this list 
;-)

This comment from one gent was interesting both for the chance to see 
how other communities are adopting WiFi (of interest to Airstream 
folks) as well as interest in the software solutions that might be 
about.

Cheers,  Ian

" I looked at your Web report and it looks quite similar to
 work being done here on the Isle of Wight. We have a problem
 in that ADSL and satellite will not reach many for several
 years (or more), so groups are setting up satellite
 broadband internet access connected in turn to WiFi base
 stations that can then serve a neighbourhood. Details are at
 <A HREF="http://broadbandwight.com/">http://broadbandwight.com/</A>

 It can and does work, but I would recommend anyone doing
 this to talk with someone who knows about radio propagation
 in these low microwave bands. In order to use no-licence
 equipment, you are working at low power that is designed to
 limit the range. You also have to overlap cells, and can
 have problems near areas of overlap. Propagation is not as
 simple as it may seem - in urban areas in particular you can
 easily get areas that are total dead spots, and some that
 get strong connections with 2 or more base stations. Both of
 these are a serious problem! Propagation modelling software
 can predict these, and help you choose just where (and how
 high) to site base stations to minimise problems.
"

Now, where is the OpenSource propogation modelling software? Any ideas?

Ian
