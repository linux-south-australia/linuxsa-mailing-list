Barney,

&gt; &gt;This is just like saying that we should introduce non-compulsory
&gt; &gt;unionism in the interests of "freedom".

The shipwrights will say: "Introduce freedome of choice" with respect to
the maritime unions. They will then offer non-union labour about 25-50%
more than union labour. Eventually though, they'll drop EVERYONE's
conditions.

It's NOT freedom of choice - it's freedom for those with the most
resources and MONEY to do what they want.

&gt; If you want to put something in that will get amended to what you want, 
&gt; you obviously would need to start asking for something more than your 
&gt; aim, not less - as is the case here. Regardless I disagree with the 
&gt; thought anyway - ask for what you want and back it up with good logical 
&gt; arguments.

You wouldn't make a good politician would you? We're talking politics
here, not computers. It's NOT logical. The things that matter here are:

 * who has the most money?
   [I would suggest Microsoft, SCO, IBM et al by a long shot]

 * who has the most political sway?
   [hell, we can't even agree on whether the bill is good or not]

 * who's sexier in the public eye?
   [seen those Windows XP ads? They're cool. Now, what open source ads do
    you remember seeing on TV? If Howard/Rann stomps on the open source
    community, who cares - you can do it all with XP anyway]

Bend the mind, think out of the square. Don't attempt to argue logic in a
public forum against the politicians. Play them at their own game ;-)
