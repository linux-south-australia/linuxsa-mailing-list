&gt;That bit which you say is "hardly an issue" happens to be 100% of the
&gt;friction and tension between the open-source world and the commercial
&gt;software world.  If it wasn't for that "hardly an issue" datapoint,
&gt;we wouldn't be having this discussion.  Finally, by *forcing* behaviour
&gt;on third parties, it makes any claim to "freedom" from GPL proponents
&gt;frankly laughable.
&gt;  
&gt;
No, the friction is that the _closed source_ world doesn't want to open 
it's source. I would expect there to be just as little, if not less 
commercial software companies that would release using BSD license as 
ones that would release using the GPL. RH is a commercial software 
company - and they haven't got a problem with the GPL.
It is complete and utter FUD to say that the GPL is being forced on any 
one - noone is forcing you to use my code, it is simply a condition 
that, if you choose to do so, you release your changes in the same 
manner. It is not your *right* to build on my work, it is something I am 
offering under certain conditions. ANY license is there to enforce 
certain behaviour on the licensee, it is just that the GPL is more 
restrictive than BSD. MS source licensing terms would be even more 
restrictive, and simply releasing something into the public domain is 
the least restrictive. If you want to be really altruistic, why not just 
release the code with no strings attached?

To give an analogy, am I _forcing_ you to buy my product when I say you 
must give me $X before I give it to you? No I am simply forcing you to 
pay me if you want it. If you don't like those terms - don't pay me 
anything and I won't give you my product. I haven't forced any money out 
of you and you are free to find another solution to your problem of 
wanting something that does what my product does. (Make your own, find 
another vendor that has different terms etc.)

&gt;The GPL isn't "free-as-in-speech".  It's "free-as-in-beer";  And it's
&gt;selfish, motivated by greed.  The fact that it's greed for source 
&gt;code instead of greed for money doesn't make it any more morally pure
&gt;than a commercial software license.
&gt;  
&gt;
Every motive can be traced to some desire of the person who is 
performing the act. It makes no sense that someone would do something 
for nothing. Whether that desire is for recognition, the feeling you get 
from being "selfless" whatever it is ultimately done for the result that 
you percieve. Some people beleive that using the GPL will allow more 
people to benefit from their original work, which sounds similar to the 
motive you claim drives people to use the BSD license.

&gt;I've described a relevent example of the GPL holding-back an open
&gt;source project (i.e., it has made adoption of the GIMP by professional
&gt;graphic designers essentially impossible).
&gt;
&gt;Can you, or anyone else, provide even *one* example, real or hypothetical,
&gt;of BSD licensing resulting in similar damage to an open source project's
&gt;potential?
&gt;  
&gt;
How much better than MacOS 9 is MacOS X? (I haven't used it but 
anecdotal evidence suggests that it is significantly so) I think you 
would be hard pressed to say that Apple haven't benefitted from basing 
their product on a BSD OS. Has the associated BSD gained as much from 
the relationship as Apple has?
Regardless I am not trying to take sides - I am simple supplying arguments.

&gt;I claim you can't, because the BSD license gives you every real-world
&gt;advantage that the GPL gives, with less restrictions.  I.e., the BSD
&gt;license is a superset of the GPL.
&gt;  
&gt;
I have already pointed out that it doesn't give the same advantages to 
the original developer - obviously from the second developers side of 
things it offers more rights. From the original developers POV it offers 
a _subset_ of the rights.
