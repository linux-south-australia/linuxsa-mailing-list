No Idea, I'm going to start writing some code anyway. Hopefully most programs 
are written modularly enough that the config file access code is separated 
out from the rest of the program. If I could get something like samba to work 
under the new system, that'd be sweet. Then I'd try to see if the Samba guys 
liked it. Grass roots stuff, get people over one by one :)

I still want to talk with more system administrators so I can work out any 
potential problems in implementing this on a large network (i.e. being able 
to have some configs on a different server shared via nfs or some other 
means).

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; Would one...

&gt; ... start a project at sourceforge, set up a framework, invite over the
