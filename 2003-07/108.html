Hi Simon, my apolgies I had no intention of using the list as an informal 
sales contact.
What I as getting at was that I had indeed been in contact with Internode 
and was told the service was not available.
So when you mentioned that it was I thought I'd prompt the Internode people 
to clarify the situation, they are usually quick for other issues and 
normally don't let an opportunity like this to passw ithout comment.

So now we are clear from you message below, that it is not avaiable now but 
all things going well it will be this year and thats good enough for me. 
Thnx for taking the time to clarify it.

On a side issue I had every intention of connecting to a friends house but 
when we got onto the roof tops with lights, low and behold trees that you 
dont pay much attention to in the daylight cover most of the skyline in the 
dark :(

&gt; Its never fair to construe a failure to treat a public mailing list as a 
&gt; sales channel to mean ANYTHING about what a company sells. They might 
&gt; just not have noticed your indirect request in lieu of simply asking 
&gt; directly. There are 68 people here, pick up the phone and call 1300 788 
&gt; 233 during office hours :)
&gt;
&gt; That said, since I -have-just noticed this message from you (I'm a busy 
&gt; person - I don't read LinuxSA all the time), the answer to your question 
&gt; is simple:
&gt;
&gt; We have offered wireless Internet links for around four years now, at 
&gt; pricing substantially higher than ADSL (and pre-dating the existence of 
&gt; ADSL in this country), in the greater Adelaide metro area. We still do.
&gt;
&gt; We are also in beta test on something explicitly called 'Internode 
&gt; Wireless DSL'. That beta test process is working very smoothly, and we do 
&gt; expect to release a product offering along those lines later this year.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon

&gt;&gt; I know Internode people contribute to the list, but their silence on 
&gt;&gt; whether Internode do offer DSL wirless may be taken to mean that 
&gt;&gt; contrary to what Simon has stated, they don't do DSL wireless?
&gt;&gt; Can anyone confirm that they do or they don't. There seems to be 
&gt;&gt; conflicting statements and I would really like to explore it further if 
&gt;&gt; they do.
