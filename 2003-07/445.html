&gt;&gt;I was thinking along those lines, but wanted to see what other people 
&gt;&gt;thought before I did anything rash.

&gt;I guess the other thing, which is a bit harder, is to expect rejection. As
&gt;he says, you're not a journalist or writer, you're a CPA. While this doesn't
&gt;mean you can't write (you can), it certainly means that you're likely to
&gt;meet with less immediate success than someone who does this for a living.
&gt;
When I first received the message,  I was going to write him back and 
say this:

Can you write the article instead? :-)   I don't care if I am even 
listed as a contributor, I just think that this information is important 
for CPA's to know.

That's honestly what I feel about his opinion on the "article 
worthiness" of the paper.

But the 'premature' part worries me.  My main reason for writing the 
article was to get CPA's interested in using Linux. I wanted CPA's to 
realize that they can get Linux to do most everything they do in 
Windows, and if our profession just made a small push, it could be a 
viable choice for us.  And that's all I really want.

Who knows maybe one or two companies that make accounting software might 
decide to give the Wine thing a shot. Ultimately more and more people 
would have a choice of operating systems, and that's what I want to do.

I am amazed that one application is 95% functional without the original 
software company, or the Wine project having put any thought into 
getting it to run in Linux, but yet I have been able to prepare a tax 
return on it just this week. Tax software in Linux is a major hill to 
climb over, and it has been climbed 95% of the way by pure chance.  And 
not because I actually added much to what codeweavers has done with Wine 
already, I was just curious to try it out. Oh well it says you need 
command.com, so I made a blank text file and called it command.com and 
put it in the Wine directory.

So when he says 'premature' I worry because it quashes my main purpose 
for writing the article in the first place. Its silly that Linux should 
have to run the applications 100% instead of 95% perfectly in order for 
this information to be newsworthy.

Cheers,

James Leone
