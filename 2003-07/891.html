Hi Adam,

Just to nit pick on another post, it is 2 devices per channel, not 2 per
controller.
If you want lots of drives look at a products by a company called 3ware,
they make THE best IDE RAID controllers, they have models with up to 12 IDE
Channels (but they only let you run 1 device per channel) it is true
hardware RAID 5 (if you want it) it also has onboard cache for parity
bit/write caching.
You can then stick your CD-RW's etc on your standard IDE controllers, and
then all your HDD's onto the 3ware controller. You can then RAID 0 2 drives
for a squid cache (squid loves high I/O)

Sounds like fun.

how hard is it to have multiple HDDs hooked up in a box? I know that between
HDDs and CDs and whichever else, you have primary and secondary master and
slaves... so does that limit you to four? or can you hook up more?

another thought that comes is RAID, but my understanding of that (which
isn't that great) is that it uses a bunch of HDDs together, which isn't
quite what I want...
say, a CD/DVD writer, CD -ROM, a HDD for swap, a HDD or two for squid cache
(from what I remember in squid docs, it'd like several drives for a major
site, which I wouldn't be doing, but a squid dedicated drive would boost
performance still), a HDD for data (movies and music, maybe), a HDD or two
for linux... is it doable on x86 hardware? without jumping through too many
hoops?
would I need certain mobo/bios/other hardware? (I haven't bought anything
yet, and probably wont for a while yet, so if I need to get something
special, it's not ruled out, it can go on the considerations list)

TIA, Adam
