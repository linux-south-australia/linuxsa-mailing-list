&gt; Its installer is a little too swiss knife like for one thing. It is a good

&gt; ports collection?

Not sure, I have never found the need to use one.
Want to find say lynx in the ports: whereis lynx
Want to install it: cd /usr/ports/www/lynx; make install clean
Want to remove it: cd /usr/ports/www/lynx; make deinstall
Want to make it even easier:
Install portupgrade (from the ports) and then portinstall &lt;app name&gt;
To upgrade portupgrade &lt;port name&gt;

Want to keep the ports tree updated, run cvsup -g ports-supfile.
Want to see which installed ports have newer versions in the tree:
pkg_version -v

You can use a browser to look around the ports tree, or you can do
searches with: cd /usr/ports; make search key=&lt;search_keyword&gt;

If ports aren't your thing, you can always use packages:
pkg_add -r lynx
pkg_delete -x lynx

Copy a few of these commands into a text file so you don't forget them
and take a look around the man pages. I am sure there are better ways of
doing everything above, but this all works well enough for me.

The real fun is when you use cvsup to upgrade your operating system and
it only has to download cvs patches instead of complete binaries.


&gt; &gt; I can't think of anything scary about it at all. Perhaps you couldn't
&gt; &gt; work out how to install bash, or how to edit .xinitrc ?
&gt; 
&gt; That's what end users who can't even work out how to log on don't *want*
&gt; to do though;-)

It is a shame that so many people have to be told what their computer
should look and act like. I much prefer to have it MY way.

I wonder how many potential FreeBSD users logon, see twm and bail.

The documentation is amazing and the community is really helpful (even
#freebsd on freenode is reasonably helpful)
