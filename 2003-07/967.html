as a coder trying to decide on a license for a project I'm working on, I'd 
like to offer my opinions, maybe someone can give me feedback that will help 
me out too 8^)
while I dont want to restrict people from using my work, and I dont really 
mind if I dont get credit or whatever, and if people make money off of my 
work, well, good for them. but by the same token, I dotn want other people 
from accessing my work... while I want my work to always be available in 
source, I don't see why I should force that on anyone who extends my work... 
what I'd like is a license where my work, as code, is made available in 
projects that use it (or more than a certain percent, maybe, if someone 
copies a dozen lines from my 50MB project, I doubt I'd care), but whatever 
anyone else adds, they can distribute as they like, for however much money 
they like. provided they don't limit accesss to my work.
I haven't really looked at all the licenses out there, but none of the ones 
I've read about seem to come close.
anyway, that's my $0.022, and any pointers to licenses to check out would be 
appreciated
Adam
