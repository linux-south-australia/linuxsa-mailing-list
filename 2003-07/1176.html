 &gt; shouldn't I be able to license it under any terms I see fit, including ones 
 &gt; that restrict how you can distribute modifications?  Why do YOUR rights

That's easy to answer:  We're suppose to be developing FREE software here.

The FSF's aim is to develop software which can be used by anyone and fixed
by anyone and extended by anyone;  It's pretty plain from this discussion
that they've failed in that aim, because there are types of applications
which will never be served by FSF software ("Pantone GIMP") and there are
groups of people who, for one reason or another, find that the GPL is just
as restrictive as a commercial software license when it comes to fixing
and extending software.

I don't mind if you license software in a way which insists that my
rights to do certain things with it are subordinated.  Just don't call
it "Free Software" when you do, because it obviously -isn't-, and
trying to convince the world that you believe strongly in free software
when you're pulling that kind of trick is hypocritical.
