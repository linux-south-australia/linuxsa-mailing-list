Thanks muchly for this, man tunefs wasn't there, but a quick look around found 
man tune2fs, which worked a charm, I now have the count I was expecting.
however, when working on the system, I am logged in as root (and no-one else 
uses this computer while it's running linux), so reserved space isn't really 
as useful on this box.
with it now set to 0% on both ext3 partitions, I'll be able to use that left 
over space 8^)
however, apart from the kernel and a half dozen apps, all the software I have 
for linux is what came in the slack packages, so I could only clean up by 
removing them, or carefully pruning from stuff I installed, eg some of the 
docs that aren't appropriate to me, or storing source away. 

cheers,
Adam

&gt; &gt; Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
&gt; &gt; /dev/hda7              1416040   1280996     61952  96% /

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; there's about 70Mb missing from root, and about 50 from /usr/local.
&gt;
&gt; ext2fs/ext3fs feature "reserved" space which is available only to root.
&gt; This is designed (at least in part) to prevent ordinary users from
&gt; exhausting all available disk space which can lead to difficulties in
&gt; continued operation of the system. This reserved space is not included in
&gt; the df listing of Available blocks and Use% and appears to typically
&gt; default to 5% (as your experience demonstrates, around 70M out of 1416M and
&gt; 45M out of 904M).
&gt;
&gt; As you're running very low on available space you probably will need to
&gt; consider doing a bit of cleaning up and/or pruning, especially if you're
&gt; wanting to compile.
&gt;
&gt; See fs utilities, e.g. man tunefs
