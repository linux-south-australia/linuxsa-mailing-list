&gt; My point, which I hope is now clear, is that Christendom's belief is
&gt; intrinsic (you are not allowed to question the dogma), whereas science
&gt; has no belief, merely unproven theories.  And science expects you to
&gt; question everything.

I think it is wildly inaccurate to say that Christian belief is
"intrinsic" and "you are not allowed to question the dogma".  That might
be the case for some Churches and denominations (or perhaps your
experience with "religion"?), however that has nothing to do with
Christianity or my faith.  My faith has been largely strengthened by
evidence, mainly archaeological and historical in nature and by
analyzing, questioning, seeking, exploring and investigating.

In fact I know of two authors off the top of my head, that went from
being staunch Atheists to committed Christians through the process of
trying to disprove the resurrection of Jesus, (Look up Josh McDowell or
Lee Strobel if you want to know specifics).  There is an insurmountable
pile of evidence to support the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ.

The great thing about Truth is that it will stand up to scrutiny.
