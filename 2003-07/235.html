Richard,

Some modern viruses get both To and From addresses from address books,
browser caches, etc stored on the victim's system.  Obviously this has the
effect of hiding the real source of the virus from email scanners and the
like, helping the virus propagate for longer before anyone can warn the
victim that they even have it.  

So, chances are that the victim is a LinuxSA subscriber, or has visited the
mailing list archives, or some other page with both Ian's and your email
addresses.  Further, its likely that the victim's email client is configured
to use randalflagg.net as their SMTP server, hence the warning to you as the
recipient rather than the source.

If I was a betting man, I'd be tipping that a user of randalflagg.net has a
virus, and its unlikely that the email actually came from Ian.

Jim.

Hi all, Ian,

OK, this is weird. I got this message early this morning, and it confused
me. Why does this Randal Flagg character want to send me an email about an
email? How is he supposed to have known about it? I've checked out his web
page, and it's just a personal page... I'm seriously confused as to what's
going on here...

Anyone got any light they can shed, or know Randal Flagg, or got any
questions they can ask to help follow this up?

Cheers

rr
