&gt; The main gripe I have with his modem (apart from it crashing) is that the
&gt; ports for the services it runs are available to the outside world and he
&gt; hasn't found a way of disabling that.  I can connect to the modem's web
&gt; server across the Internet.  Admittedly, the webserver is password
protected,
&gt; but it is still sort of a security problem.

Eeep! What's to stop some persistant malicious user from dictionary
attacking the web interface until they get in?  I assume the router has a
default password... what if some users never change it?  On most routers
(including my Netgear MR814) it's possible to disable outside access to the
web interface.  I think this alone should disqualify the Billion from
selection as a good router.

My MR814 (version 1) has been disappointing in that it has no packet logging
(first router I've seen without this crucial feature) and more importantly,
every time *any* setting is changed the router resets itself, dropping the
connection.  No bridging capability for the 802.11b AP makes the wireless
feature somewhat limited.  The latest firmware (4.11) spams the whole
network with syslog entries, and there's nothing I can do to stop it doing
so.  Great for security.....

I have just ordered a Netgear RT314.  It's old but I used to have this
router and it was pretty much flawless.  Very stable, feature packed, and
only has one security hole (cross site browser vulnerability, easily solved
by blocking access to the web interface).  It runs ZynOS and you can log
into the router and get a real shell.  Not bad for a $105 router!

Netgear has chosen some poor OEMs recently, but their older hardware is
excellent.

See ya
