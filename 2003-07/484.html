&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;This is completely off-topic, but i thought some people here may have
&gt;something to say about this, with the common interest in Free Software, and
&gt;often free speech. How do people feel about the recent censorship debate in
&gt;Australia? I'm thinking of three films in particular: "Baise Moi", "Ken
&gt;Park", and David Irving's "The Search for Truth in History". 
&gt;
Sometime more fuss than necessary is made.  Those who make an issue out 
of Irving and the likes tend to do more harm to their cause than the 
individuals themselves.  We can see for ourselves that Irving is a 
nutter and his presentation of  history is flawed.  His crusade would 
fizzle out if some of these people would just ignore him.
As for films, content must be relevant and not gratuitous for it to be 
considered art.  As for censorship, that can be difficult.  As for 
censorship of the internet, that was a bloody laugh!  We knew where that 
was going to go.  As for politicians,  we seem to have all the dimwits 
at the same time.
