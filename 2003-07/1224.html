Howdy

I have now also tried out RedHat and Mandrake and would be interested to 
know what Debian is like. I do use knoppix quite frequently and find 
that it configures more accuratly with my hardware without me haveing to 
do anything, however because of this I have never actually had any 
experience trying to do anything like package managment. It is the only 
distro to automatically set up my onboard sound card.

The biggest thing that I could say about Knoppix is that it allows me to 
have a full time broadband connection through a Netgear home internet 
router, which for some reason gave me enourmous grief in RH 9.

good luck

mike james

&gt;Hi ,
&gt;   I have used both Mandrake 7 to 9.1 , redhat 7 to 9.0 for a couple of years now on and off for the last few months I have used Mandrake 9.1 consistantly . I personally prefer Mandrake to redhat more because that is what i am used to i think more than any other reason. I have also thought installing Debian. 
&gt;
&gt;I dont know a lot about Debian although I have read on its greater stability.
&gt; 
&gt;I would like to know any thoughts please and also how many users use what distro and why. I do like the rpm format of install so that does influence me to stay with either redhat or mandrake but i would like other opinions.   
&gt;
&gt;Regards
