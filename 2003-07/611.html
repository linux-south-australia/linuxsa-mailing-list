&lt;political&gt;

The other advantage that I see to becoming an American State (or, more
likely, seven or so American States) is that we would then be able to vote
in US elections. As it is, the US Government is more important in our daily
lives than our own, so I would expect this to be a good thing. For that
matter, I would really like to see Canada and NZ join with us in becoming
part of the USA -- Between us, we would make up almost 20% of the population
of the joined countries, and would probably be more likely to vote. It would
be likely that combined, we'd be 25% of the vote. Think of the effect that
that would have on American (and hence, world) politics. All three nations
are far more cautious than the USA, and, I would claim, saner. We'd see a
whole lot of good things coming out of that situation, and hence, despite
(or perhaps because of) the fact that America is one of my least favourite
countries, I'm honestly and seriously in favour of joining them.

&lt;even more political&gt;

That said, I can't help but poke fun at the reasons that Dr Mosler gave in
his article:

* Access to the world's best higher education system. 

Depends how you define "Access" -- but then again, the Australian Government
seems intent on removing access to our damned fine higher education system.


* Large savings on embassies. 

Oh, hoorah. I'm sure that's a major component of the budget.


* Being part of the world's most effective defence system. 

... And part of the world's most agressive attack force...


* Merger with the world's strongest currency. 

... which are all the same colour so you can't tell them apart easily,
particularly if you're blind... Also, I wonder what effect merging with that
currency would actually have -- it would mean we couldn't control interest
rates, and would probably suffer from that.


* Being part of the world's biggest economy. 

... which is currently in recession while ours is performing well (at least,
so they tell us). Besides, how would we be confident that we would actually
benefit from that involvement, and not become the new backwater for the
wealthier states?


* A constitution bringing a republic and a Bill of Rights. 

Fat lot of good that does Americans. I'd rather live in our country and be
relatively safe than be "protected" by their bill of rights, and fear for my
life.


* Fielding teams in the US national basketball, baseball and gridiron
competitions. 

Oh. Yay. While I've heard basketball has something of a following here, I
think the number of people who care about baseball, gridiron or any other
American sports (eg NASCAR, WWF, Ice Hockey, CART) is about the same as the
number of people who care about synchronised swimming. Besides, for the most
part, aren't all these American sports "World Championships" anyway?
(strange definition of "World" they've got, but hey) ...

&lt;/rant&gt;
