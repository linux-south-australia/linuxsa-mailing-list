I am not really a coder, so I can only speak theoretically...

To me, software availability is a social issue. I for one,  do not want 
to give an ounce of help to a company that holds $40 billion dollars in 
the bank, yet still strangles its competition. Microsoft has already 
taken too much, I would not even take a chance that there would be any 
way I could help them.

So, to me, the GPL helps to ensure that the non proprietary David's have 
a chance against the proprietary Goliath's.  By not allowing Microsoft 
to use partially developed code, I know that I have not made the 
situation worse, by spoonfeeding desireable features to a company that 
will drain wealth from the community at large like vampires.  It is in 
this light, that I see the GPL as a social contract between members of 
the "Linux" Community at large, forming a framework to encourage people 
to work together with the understanding that their work won't work 
against them, or end up as a zero gain.
