&gt; Being something of a film geek, this sort of topic is 
&gt; extremely interesting 
&gt; to me. A Clockwork Orange, one of Stanley Kubrick's classics, 
&gt; is one of my 
&gt; all-time favorite films, along with The Rocky Horror Picture 
&gt; Show, Fight 
&gt; Club, The Matrix, Natural Born Killers, The Shining, and 
&gt; numerous other 
&gt; films. Strangely enough, the weird ones tend to appeal to me 
&gt; more. I would 
&gt; be very interested to hear of people's opinions of the 
&gt; aforementioned films, 
&gt; or any others of similar genres or styles. 

:)

A Clockwork Orange -- Excellent...
Rocky Horror -- can't remember it...
Fight Club -- Excellent...
Matrix -- Good...
Natural Born Killers -- haven't seen it yet...
The Shining (Kubrick Version) -- Good...

Eyes Wide Shut -- Excellent...
Intimacy -- Confronting but excellent...
Romance -- Average...
Baise Moi -- B-Grade
Ken Park -- Good...
Memento -- Excellent...
Vanilla Sky -- Excellent (but I missed the first and last 5 mins... when I
saw them, it was crap)
The Game -- Excellent

... :)

&gt; 
&gt; I am a strong believer that people should be able to see, 
&gt; read or hear what 
&gt; they want to. It promotes responsible decisionmaking, 
&gt; especially amongst 
&gt; young adults, and also gives a person a chance to take in 
&gt; everything that is 
&gt; made available to them, which places them in the position of 
&gt; being able to 
&gt; make an unbiased judgement upon what they have seen, heard or read. 

yes...

&gt; 
&gt; I have an extremely impressionable younger brother - he is 14 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; of my friends enjoyed at their age. Most of their lives are 
&gt; on a downward 
&gt; spiral, and are in urgent need of correction. 

No-one's suggesting classifying it G... :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; While people who are mature enough to interpret and 
&gt; understand what goes 
&gt; into their mind (and who are capable of throwing out the 
&gt; bullshit) should 
&gt; not be restricted from doing so, the impressionable young 
&gt; people among us 
&gt; need to given the right message. The redirection of their 
&gt; attention into 
&gt; alternative pursuits, such as sports and other hobbies, or 
&gt; even their own 
&gt; education would be far more useful than what many of them 
&gt; waste their time 
&gt; on at present. One of the most popular things to do at the 
&gt; moment is to go 
&gt; to Rundle Mall, or any of the many shopping malls scattered 
&gt; around the 
&gt; suburbs, and just stand around. I cannot imagine anything more 
&gt; uninteresting! 

Indeed. Should we ban "Mall Rats"? :)

&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, I would be extremely interested in hearing from any 
&gt; others amongst 
&gt; you who have something to add to on this issue. Any solutions for 
&gt; single-handedly revamping our misdirected youth? 

Well, I don't think censorship is the appropriate tool to do that with... :)
