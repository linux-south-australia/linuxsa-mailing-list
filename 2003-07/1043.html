&gt; If The GIMP was BSD-licensed, then we'd be able to download exactly the 
&gt; same source code we can download now, but we'd *ALSO* have the potential
&gt; to go to a commercial software vendor and pay some dollars for a closed-
&gt; source "Pantone GIMP".  Surely that's a better outcome by just about 
&gt; any metric you'd care to measure it by...?

You *can* pay dollars for a closed-source "Pantone GIMP".  It's called
"Photoshop."

&gt;&gt; No, I think the ones who mostly care are software authors who are denied
&gt;&gt; access to improvements to their work.
&gt;
&gt; Ahhhh...!  So now it's not *your* gift, and *your* work you're worried 
&gt; about.  The selfishness I described a couple of messages ago is coming
&gt; out;  You want forced access to *someone else's* work.  It's not your 
&gt; gift you care about, it someone else's improvements to it.

You keep ignoring the truth that no developer is *forced* to use a GPL
base.  GPL doesn't force anyone to give away their improvements.  You
tell me how it does?


&gt; Just to labor the point a bit more:  The Ingres story turned out the 
&gt; way it did because that's the way BSD-licensed software *ALWAYS* 
&gt; turns out when it is commercially exploited;  It wasn't some kind of
&gt; happy accident.

Not really.  It was a happy accident that the people who improved on
Ingres didn't patent their improvements.  That's an accident that's
being repeated less and less.
