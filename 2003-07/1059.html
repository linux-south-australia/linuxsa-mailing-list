Got this from a post on slashdot:

Addicted To vi 
(with apologies to Robert Palmer) 
 
You press the keys with no effect, 
Your mode is not correct. 
The screen blurs, your fingers shake; 
You forgot to press escape. 
Can't insert, can't delete, 
Cursor keys won't repeat. 
You try to quit, but can't leave, 
An extra "bang" is all you need. 
 
You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"-- 
Oh yeah? 
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die 
You know you're gonna have to face it; 
You're addicted to vi! 
 
You edit files one at a time; 
That doesn't seem too out of line? 
You don't think of keys to bind-- 
A meta key would blow your mind. 
H, J, K, L? You're not annoyed? 
Expressions must be a Joy! 
Just press "f", or is it "t"? 
Maybe "n", or just "g"? 
 
Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"-- 
Oh yeah? 
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die 
You know you're gonna have to face it; 
You're addicted to vi! 
 
Might as well face it, 
You're addicted to vi! 
 
You press the keys without effect, 
Your life is now a wreck. 
What a waste! Such a shame! 
And all you have is vi to blame. 
 
Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"-- 
Oh yeah? 
You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die 
You know you're gonna have to face it; 
You're addicted to vi! 
 
Might as well face it, 
You're addicted to vi!

&gt; I like vi. It's much better than emacs. Emacs sucks. Emacs stands for
&gt; Esc-meta-alt-ctrl-shift, because you need to have seventeen fingers on the
&gt; keyboard at once to use it. Emacs users are all undereducated nutcases who,
&gt; if they were intelligent enough to work out how to do it, would replace
&gt; init with emacs. I guess emacs is a great operating system, but it's a
&gt; lousy text editor. Vi is so cool. You can tell a real guru because they use
&gt; vi to edit source code. Or ed to edit machine code. Or even cat &gt;&gt; file to
&gt; edit binaries. I'm so glad I'm not an emacs user.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, sorry, we were having the evolution/creation and the BSD/GPL wars?
&gt; Oops... wrong religious war.

&gt; PPS mutt is to pine as vi is to pico... Mutt is so much better than your
&gt; mail client. Even if you use mutt. My mutt setup is better than your mutt
&gt; setup.
&gt;
&gt; PPPS csh and derivatives are all evil and should be shot. Bourne-derived
&gt; shells are the only way to go...
&gt;
&gt; PPPPS Apple make really good desk ornaments. Here's a dollar -- go buy
&gt; yourself a PC.
&gt;
&gt; PPPPPS GNOME is a joke. KDE is hardcore. Just give up with your toy desktop
&gt; environment and come to the land of good software that is K.
