The 2003 Darwin Awards
In case you have been waiting breathlessly for this year's Darwin Awards,
here they are. The awards this year are, once again, truly classic. These
awards are given each year to bestow upon (the remains of) that individual,
who through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove
undesirable elements from the human gene pool.
Just think...until these events, these same people were walking the streets
like normal people.

5th RUNNER-UP:
Goes to a San Anselmo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower
at the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam
pad. The 22-year old David Hubal was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth
Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's
department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run
called Stump alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift
towers, said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The
pads are used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently
used the pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed
into a tower. It has since been investigated and determined the tower
he hit was the one with its pad removed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4th RUNNER-UP:

Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, was apparently being disorderly in a St.Louis
market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a hot
dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police found
him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the six-inch
wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3rd RUNNER-UP:

Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him
on a n overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd RUNNER-UP:

"Man loses face at party." A man at a West Virginia party (probably related
to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas who used the .22bullet to replace
the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a blasting cap into his
mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew off his lips, teeth,
and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the blasting cap as a prank
during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. Payne. "Another man had
it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was trying to explode it." "It
wouldn't go off and this guy said I'll show you how to set it off." He put
it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his teeth out and his lips and
tongue off, Payne said. Stromyer was listed in guarded condition Wednesday
with extensive Facial injuries, according to a spokesperson at Charleston
Area Medical Division. "I just can't imagine anyone doing something like
that," Payne said.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1st RUNNER-UP:

Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through
the skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon
from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last
weekend during an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men
Anonymous (probably known now as Stupid Mountain Men Anonymous) in Grants
Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the arrow
entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1
millimeter to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and Roberts
would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at the
University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 inches
of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet somehow
managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that had Roberts
tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have killed himself.
Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had been drinking that
afternoon. Said Roberts, I feel so dumb about this." No charges have been
filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's office said the
initiation stunt is under investigation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, THIS YEAR'S WINNER:

(The late) John Pernicky and his friend, (the late) Sal Hawkins, of the
great state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert
at the George Washington amphitheater. Having no tickets (but having had 18
beers between them), they thought it would be easy to "hop" over
the nine foot fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup truck
over to the fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100 pounds
heavier than Mr. Hawkins) to hop the fence and then assist his
friend over. Unfortunate for (the late) Mr.Pernicky, there was a 30-foot
drop on the other side of the fence. Having heaved himself over, he found
himself crashing through a tree. His fall was abruptly halted (and broken,
along with his arm) by a large branch that snagged him by his shorts.
Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, he looked down and saw some bushes
below him. Possibly figuring the bushes would break his fall, he removed his
pocket knife and proceeded to cut away his shorts to free himself from the
tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves
scratched his ENTIRE body and now, without the
protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his rectum. To make
matters worse, on landing his pocket knife penetrated his thigh.
Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain and agony, threw him a rope
and tried to pull him to safety by tying the rope to the pickup truck and
slowly driving away. 
However, in his drunken haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and
crashed through the fence landing on his friend and killing him. Police
arrived to find the crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100 feet from the
truck and dead at the scene from massive internal injuries. Upon moving the
truck, they found John under it half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly
stick in his rectum, a knife in his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a
tree branch 25 feet in the air.
Congratulations gentlemen, you win...
