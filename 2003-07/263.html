&gt;Hi James (and All),
&gt;    I will probably have a look at your article, but just on conversions
&gt;from X to word, did you know that Star Office, and I believe Open Office,
&gt;can save in M$ Word format? 
&gt;
Yes, I knew.   :-)   And I would be willing to bet that my audience may 
eventually try Open Office, and to me, that's the way to do it. Welcome 
new Linux users into the community with open arms, keep as many around 
as possible and teach them in a friendly way.  Eventually, they will 
wake up one day and suddenly realize that they are using Open Office.[1]

I left Open Office out of the article more as a consideration of the 
audience I was writing to: boring stick in the mud accountants that 
think change is a bad word.

In fact, there is a saying that just about every new staff learns in 
training: "SALY" - 'same as last year'.  Just copy the pattern, do the 
job like it looks in last year's workpapers.

Accounting work is all about maximizing billable time relative to their 
non billable time in a work week.  As a result, software changes are 
seen as risky, and buying MSOffice makes more sense to them than 
downloading Open Office for gratis. Because if they use Office, there 
will be no surprises, and they know the program works.

I am not saying they are correct or incorrect, only that I understand my 
audience's point of view, and have chosen to play by them. Anything else 
is talking to a brick wall.

&gt;It might have saved you a heap of problems, but
&gt;at least you will know for next time. 
&gt;
MS Office is officially supported by Codeweavers, and it isn't a problem 
at all really. Plain old Wine will be a problem, but Codeweavers wine 
works almost perfectly.

Using Codeweavers Cross Over office for MSOffice actually saves me time, 
because I don't have to reinstall an operating system and applications 
if the fake windows directory happens to chuck a wobbley, and that is rare.

Codeweavers put a significant amount of time into running Office with 
Wine, and there are other people using it, etc, so that lightens my 
load, I am not my only resource.

Lacerte, which is a professional income tax preparation program, is 
another story.  I don't know of anybody besides myself that uses it in 
Linux, yet it is the #1 or #2 income tax preparation software used by 
accountants in the US. I'd say I have put 10 hours into simply trying 
out the available tools to see if they could be used with Lacerte to get 
it to work.  If that was time during work hours, it would be 10 hours 
too much.


&gt;I have actually tried to do this on a
&gt;fair size document, both saving initially in Word and doing a Save As in
&gt;Star/Open Office, and then opening and Save As back to Word. When I then
&gt;went to Word and opened the document up there didn't appear to be any
&gt;problems or loss of formatting or anything.
&gt;
I have seen a lot of MS word documents that come in from a misselany of 
gov't agencies,  and if they have tables, or complex formatting, the 
compatability is deteriorated.

&gt;    The main problem I have with Word is that the files are bloated with
&gt;hidden formatting and are relatively huge compared to say pdf or Postscript.
&gt;
It all boils down to what is important to the end user, accountant's 
don't care much about file sizes.  They care about being able to easily 
create and send documents that others can read. They don't want to muck 
with anything.

Compiling or configuring much of anything is completely out of the 
question, and will not be accepted by my audience.
If I said, just download this text file and put it in 
/etc/samba/samba.conf and you have yourself a server, they will listen 
intently.

Mucking around is fine for IT professionals, and there are a lot of 
Linux users that are IT professionals. However, there are a lot of 
people out there that don't want to know much of anything about their 
operating system. They just want it to work, so they can focus on their 
jobs.

&gt;I was a bit surprised at the size of your pdf file, not having looked at it
&gt;yet - why is it so big? 
&gt;
It professional....right? ;-)

With this article, it is as if I am claiming that there is life on Mars. 
As a result, there are _a lot_ of screen shots in the PDF file. Good 
time to take some pictures.

Its going to take a lot of effort to convince people that its true; 
Linux can be used exactly the way they want it to be.  But the more 
people that buy Linux, the more people will need help from y'all.

[1] But that won't happen so long as Open Office is not clearly better 
than Microsoft Office.

Cheers,

James Leone
