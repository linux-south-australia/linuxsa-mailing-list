In the immortal words of "Jason B. Standing"
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:jason@jasonbstanding.com">jason@jasonbstanding.com</A>&gt;...
&gt; I'm trying to get FreeBSD 5.1 to work on my PC @ home, and I'm finding
&gt; it a little frustrating, because it strikes me that unless you know
&gt; what it is you're trying to achieve, then the installer doesn't really
&gt; help you out much.  As it is, I just want to plug it in and explore a
&gt; bit.

I admit the freeBSD installer isn't for the faint of heart, or the weak
of stomach, however all is not lost.  The idea of the installer is to
get the basic parts onto a system and to use the ports collection and
associated tools to get the rest up and running.

&gt; The MAIN thing which is giving me the heebie jeebies is that I've got
&gt; 2 video cards in my machine: a Cirrus one of some sort which drives my
&gt; 12.1" LCD screen, and a GeForceII MX400 AGP card, driving the 17" CRT.
&gt;  Using it
&gt; with Windoze works a treat, because it figures it all out for me...
&gt; and even when I installed Mandrake on there it seemed to be able to
&gt; figure things out to a certain extent...  but BSD is finding it a bit
&gt; difficult.  What I'd PREFER to do as a minimum is to make it work
&gt; using the AGP card, and ignore the other one all together... but I'm
&gt; not finding the installer exactly intuitive.

I assume you mean getting this working under X.  Have you tried using 
XFree86 -configure
to set up a default XF86Config file?

This worked fine for picking up my NVidia TNT2 and S3 Virge cards (dual
head poor man style) but I've since gained possession of a Matrox dual
head card.

It also helps if you have a bit of an understanding of the XF86Config
file in case your refresh rates are a bit off.  I know mine always
seemed to be.

&gt; Also, I'm guessing that bash isn't the default shell you get - how
&gt; would one go about setting that up ?

Nope, default shell is csh or tcsh.  Bash is available in the ports
collection 
cd /usr/ports/shells/bash2 && make install

&gt; Are these the kind of questions I can get understandable answers from
&gt; here, or would I be better off giving someone a 6 pack to come over
&gt; and show me ?

I hope so.

If you are still stuck, I can give you a hand, but since I don't drink,
make it a coke and you've got a deal.

Cheers

Tim
