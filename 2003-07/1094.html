&gt;
&gt; What do you see as the deficiency in the BSD license which doesn't
&gt; allow "... others to benefit from [your] gift"?

Quite simply the BSD licence allows the holder of the code or software
to restrict access, distribution, etc to they changes or the whole
of the code or software the distribute.

Thats the whole point of the licence. The holder *may* choose to
distribute the code or the IP, with the software.

The BSD licence give you the right to restrict access to the IP.

The GPL does not. That is the key difference.

&gt; Once you've released it under the BSD license, it stays released.
&gt; It's not like a company can suddenly grab it all and restrict it
&gt; and tell everyone else they can't have it anymore.

they can restrict access to the changes they have made, as you can
with any modifications to any GPL software you use. if you choose.

&gt; I'd have thought that the benefits to the licensor (author) of code
&gt; are more or less the same whether they use a BSD license or a GPL
&gt; license:  either way, the code they've written is available for the
&gt; world.

as long as you actually distribute it.

&gt; The difference is on the side of the licensee, who gets to
&gt; choose whether to use software which comes with distribution
&gt; restrictions (GPL) or software which doesn't come with
&gt; distribution restrictions (BSD).
&gt; Note that both types of license don't impose any USE restrictions.

i don't understand the distributions restrictions you talk about here
for the GPL?

is that only you must distribute the changes of code with any
software you distribute?

and the potential that any commercial competitor can compete
with you using *your* code and IP?

isn't that kinda the whole point of the GPL and FSF to
level the playing field and to learn from each others works?
then everyone benifits from the sharing of code and IP?
instead of forming IP monopolies?

&gt; That's why I'm inflicted with insurmountable cynicism whenever I
&gt; hear RMS prattle about "Free-as-in-speech" GPL software.  It's
&gt; free-as-in-speech to use, free-as-in-speech to write, but terribly
&gt; expensive to redistribute afterwards.

why? only because you also are releasing that software under the GPL?

how is that expensive? surely it is the same as releasing the same
code under a BSD style licence?

&gt; It's also why I distribute my own software under a BSD license:
&gt; I want it to be as useful as possible for the recipient, and
&gt; it's likely to be more useful if it can be incorporated freely
&gt; into other software
&gt; (regardless of that other software's origin or eventual
&gt; distribution channel) and redistributed without loading the
&gt; licensee with obligations.

I always wonder if FreeBSD was released under a GPL style licence
if Microsoft would have a stable network stack and tools in NT5+ =P

&gt; FSF propaganda is at least as virulent as Microsoft propaganda.
&gt; They're just arguing from diametrically opposite sides of the same
&gt; fence, while the rest of us don't really give too much of a damn
&gt; either way.

I agree here entirely. A perspective to put on this is that Microsoft
will want to restrict any use, to thier conditions. Restrict any
access
to their IP, (and any they bought, licenced or stole =)[1]

The FSF reason for the GPL is explicitly not to restrict access to
the code. For its the IP that is of value. They ability to learn from
others, their good fortunes *and* their mistakes.

i do think that the "freedoms" the BSD style licences give you
are quite overrated. but that said i don't understand the
'restrictions' that the GPL limits you to?[2] maybe i have over
looked something, but surely someone can explain it clearly without
comparing it to the BSD licence... or perhaps provide a URL to a
good source.

cheers,

Kim Hawtin

[1] if you are to believe some of the camps around the traps...
[2] these are always raised by hardcore BSD types.
