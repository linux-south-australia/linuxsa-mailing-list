&gt;  &gt; Well, it might also mean that seriously ambitious 
&gt;  &gt; projects don't get started or don't attract the
&gt;  &gt; investment they need because of the risk that 
&gt;  &gt; others will be able to rip off all your hard 
&gt;  &gt; work before you get to recover your investment
&gt;  &gt; and make a profit. 
&gt; Let's also not forget that, generally speaking, the only 
&gt; reason Governments ever fund software research is because
&gt; they think it'll stimulate the private software industry.

thats a good point.

the UK government has been quietly funding research into Linux
in fast routing arena, throught Unis and companies like 3Com
who got tax breaks.

and OpenBSD who got research dollars, from the US government,
but that funding was recently cut on sugestions of the ISC(?)

&gt; Let's be serious here, how many Government funded software projects
&gt; can you think of which -aren't- supposed to make a buck?

all the ones i can think of where to put less expensive 
infrastructure towards Unis and Gov depts.

not sure about others.
 
&gt; So it'd be a bit insane of them to say, "Sure, do all this 
&gt; research, but do it in a way which makes it impossible for
&gt; private software companies to exploit it commercially."

think of all those poor hosting companies in the UK, US and
europe who used;
 [Linux|FreeBSD]+Apache+[MySQL|PostgreSQL]+[Perl|PHP+Python]
there has to be hundreds of thousands of servers about that
didn't have to pay for licences. 

its not about making money, OSS is about saving money.
