&gt; You keep complaining that GPL developers are hypocrites, and that they
&gt; really are only interested in money.  Yet your expression of the idea
&gt; makes it clear that what bothers you is that GPL makes it hard for you
&gt; to get money.

Sorry, Mark, I didn't mean to ascribe that motivation to you.  What I
meant was that GPL makes it hard for commercial exploiters to get money.

&gt; If I develop code, with my knowledge, my skill, my art, and my time
&gt; and effort, I cannot see why I should not be able to license it under
&gt; any terms I see fit.

If you develop code then you can.  If you develop code in collaberation
with someone else, even if they didn't realise that was what was going
to happen, then they get to have a say in licence conditions, too.


&gt; RMS's ideal world, the thing that he and the FSF would dearly love to
&gt; see, is a world where -all- software is GPL licensed.  In that world,
&gt; I would never be able to work on anyone's software project without
&gt; allowing them to force their terms and conditions on me.

Hence what I said before: GPL protects users' rights, not developers'.
