??

&gt; Your sentiments are correct, but there's a
&gt;school of thought which goes "All bills WILL be amended - give them a full
&gt;on one first and get the bill you actually want.".
&gt;
&gt;DSL
&gt;  
&gt;
How is it beneficial to put forward a bill that doesn't achieve your 
stated aims? You are hardly going to get people interested in a debate 
that you can't even start logically. On the other hand what if it does 
get through?

If you want to put something in that will get amended to what you want, 
you obviously would need to start asking for something more than your 
aim, not less - as is the case here. Regardless I disagree with the 
thought anyway - ask for what you want and back it up with good logical 
arguments.
