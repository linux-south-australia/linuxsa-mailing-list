I dont mind at all if my computer hangs, I boot with the kernel on a floppy 
anyway, and have a spare, so I wouldn't be bothered by that... worst case 
would be that I loose a few minutes typing, and have to dial the 'net up 
again, which I can live with. but what sort of risk is there that it could 
cause more permenant problems, like corrupting a filesystem? if it's not much 
chance, well, I'd like to play around with a new kernel... any advice/info?

ta,
Adam.
