Michael,

I'm trying to see how you come to that interpretation. Could you explain 
that more. The clause seems to directly contradict you.

The licence seems to be saying that the author must somewhere explicitly
restrict the licence to a particular version.
Therefore the licence, as it is, permits any version.
Most authors do not do so. Therefore my statement seems to be true.

This is the insert that programmers are asked to put in their software:

----------------------------------------

modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</A>#SEC1

I've just looked at the last piece of software I downloaded. It's got this:

----------------------------------------
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 * modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
 * as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
 * of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
----------------------------------------

I've checked lots of linux kernel modules too. They almost all seem to
do the "later version" thing too.

So I think that my point was completely valid.
Most GPL programmers are writing a "blank cheque" for the FSF.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
