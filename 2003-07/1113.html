&gt; &gt; What GNU -actually- says is that you're free to do
&gt; &gt; whatever you like, as long as you restrict everyone
&gt; &gt; else's freedom in the same way that the FSF restricts it.
&gt;
&gt; I might repeat that BSD and GNU licences are the same in
&gt; that regard, except that I don't agree with you.  GPL says I'm free
to
&gt; do whatever I like with the software except give it away.  In fact
it
&gt; doesn't even  quite say that: I can even give it away, so long as I
do so
&gt; on the same terms that it was given to me.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What you've just said is more like the BSD license:
&gt; &gt; You're free to do whatever you like, up to and
&gt; &gt; including selling the fruits of my
&gt; &gt; labour without paying me, as long as you're honest about
&gt; &gt; where you got the code from.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How, preceisely, does the GPL provide more freedom than that?
&gt;
&gt; I think it comes down to who's freedom is being protected.

The benifit of the BSD licence is that you *can*[1] screw the user for
every dollar they have =) surely =P and they have to pay you to fix it
too! =P

&gt; Allow that the world is divided into those who make software and
those
&gt; who use it. GNU protects freedom for the people who use software.
BSD doesn't.

=) simple isn't it.
