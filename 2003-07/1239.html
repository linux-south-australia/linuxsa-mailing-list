Grr! 

I got a similar one to this the other day! Directed to my email address and 
nobody else. He asked me to keep it secret, but a quick search of his name 
on Google revealed several other copies that had made it onto email list 
archives. 

I disapprove of the fact that people have access to *my* email address and 
can do what they want with it!

&gt;&gt; SUBJECT: URGENT ASSISTANCE REQUIRED 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; DEAR SIR/MADAM: 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I AM MR. DARL MCBRIDE CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
&gt;&gt; EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SCO GROUP, FORMERLY KNOWN AS CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt;&gt; INTERNATIONAL, IN LINDON, UTAH, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I KNOW THIS
&gt;&gt; LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOUR BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD NO PREVIOUS
&gt;&gt; COMMUNICATIONS OR BUSINESS DEALINGS BEFORE NOW. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; MY ASSOCIATES HAVE RECENTLY MADE CLAIM TO COMPUTER SOFTWARES WORTH AN
&gt;&gt; ESTIMATED $1 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS.  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN CONFIDENCE
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE URGENTLY REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE TO OBTAIN THESE FUNDS. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; IN THE EARLY 1970S THE AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION
&gt;&gt; DEVELOPED AT GREAT EXPENSE THE COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE KNOWN
&gt;&gt; AS UNIX. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAWS OF MY COUNTRY PROHIBITED THEM FROM
&gt;&gt; SELLING THESE SOFTWARES AND SO THEIR VALUABLE SOURCE CODES REMAINED
&gt;&gt; PRIVATELY HELD. UNDER A SPECIAL ARRANGMENT SOME PROGRAMMERS FROM THE
&gt;&gt; CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF BERKELEY DID ADD MORE CODES TO THIS OPERATING
&gt;&gt; SYSTEM, INCREASING ITS VALUE, BUT NOT IN ANY WAY TO DILUTE OR DISPARAGE
&gt;&gt; OUR FULL AND RIGHTFUL OWNERSHIP OF THESE CODES, DESPITE ANY AGREEMENT
&gt;&gt; BETWEEN AMERICAN TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH AND THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY
&gt;&gt; OF BERKELEY, WHICH AGREEMENT WE DENY AND DISAVOW. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; IN THE YEAR 1984 A CHANGE OF REGIME IN MY COUNTRY ALLOWED THE AMERICAN
&gt;&gt; TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH CORPORATION TO MAKE PROFITS FROM THESE
&gt;&gt; SOFTWARES.  IN THE YEAR 1990 OWNERSHIP OF THESE SOFTWARES WAS
&gt;&gt; TRANSFERRED TO THE CORPORATION UNIX SYSTEM LABORATORIES.  IN THE YEAR
&gt;&gt; 1993 THIS CORPORATION WAS SOLD TO THE CORPORATION NOVELL.  IN THE YEAR
&gt;&gt; 1994 SOME EMPLOYEES OF NOVELL FORMED THE CORPORATION CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt;&gt; INTERNATIONAL, WHICH BEGAN TO DISTRIBUTE AN UPSTART OPERATING SYSTEM
&gt;&gt; KNOWN AS LINUX.  IN THE YEAR 1995 NOVELL SOLD THE UNIX SOFTWARE CODES
&gt;&gt; TO SCO.  IN THE YEAR 2001 OCCURRED A SEPARATION OF SCO, AND THE SCO
&gt;&gt; BRAND NAME AND UNIX CODES WERE ACQUIRED BY THE CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt;&gt; INTERNATIONAL, AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE CALDERA SYSTEMS
&gt;&gt; INTERNATIONAL WAS RENAMED SCO GROUP, OF WHICH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS
&gt;&gt; CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.
