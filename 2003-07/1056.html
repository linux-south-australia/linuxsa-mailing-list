And here is the beauty in all of this.

There's choice.

You can choose to enhance a GPL'ed software package, you can choose not 
to.  You can choose to use a GPL package, you can choose not to.

You can choose to take a BSD licensed package and enhance it and make 
money out of it.  You can choose to purchase that software, you can 
choose to choose something else.

If you don't want to do it, don't.  There's no right or wrong.  But 
there is a choice and really, that's what we're all here for.  We don't 
really want any side to "win", we want a harmonious balance so that we 
can all choose from the fruits of every option according to our own needs.

I choose Beer.  I'm going to choose a Crown Lager, because that's what's 
in my fridge.  It's a closed source beer as I do not know the receipe, 
but it fits my current needs (wet, beer, close).  Some choose BSD beer 
where they take an existing receipe and enhance it but don't tell others 
how, but get great delight from feeding to other people.  Others choose 
  GPL beer where they'll quite happily tell YOU how to make it and even 
invite you around to show you (and even share one).

Beer - because people have been drinking it for thousands of years.
Beer - because you can argue about it just like religion and licenses
Beer - because it makes the world look fuzzy
Beer - because it's cold and chilled not hot and angsty
Beer - just because
Beer
