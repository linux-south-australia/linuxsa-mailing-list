INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES

The Hon. IAN GILFILLAN:

   It is my pleasure to announce to members who may not know that two
   quite significant international conferences will take place in
   Adelaide, the natural home of well-run conferences -- national or
   international. Next year there will be an Australian Linux
   conference. Linux is the identification in the computer world with
   open source software, and members know how vigorously the Democrats
   have been promoting its use by the government and others. It will be
   held at the university in January next year. It is one of three
   major international grassroots open source conferences
   worldwide. The other two are at Ottawa and major developers and
   spokespeople for open source around the world will be in
   attendance. It is therefore doubly a shame that the government,
   certainly the Minister for Administration, has paid scant regard to
   open source software for government use. I hope the fact that the
   international conference is being held here will jolt them into a
   much more favourable approach to open source software.

   The other international conference is in fundraising. An
   international fundraising conference will be held in South Australia
   quite soon -- in August. The hosting entity in South Australia is
   the Fundraising Institute, Chapter 4, South Australia and Northern
   Territory. Charitable and not-for-profit organisations have
   increased in number over the past several decades and one of the
   main reasons is the partial outsourcing of many services that
   governments have historically provided, such as emergency shelter,
   disability education and health care for the aged. The Fundraising
   Institute is in fact a professional organisation which trains people
   as professional and competent fundraisers.

   As well as organising the international conference next month, the
   organisation wishes to have closer involvement with the state
   government. It needs to be recognised by the state government so it
   can have membership on advisory committees involved with decisions
   regarding the various forms of fundraising. They request
   consultation on matters relating to fundraising and volunteers, as
   the organisation is made up of fundraisers dealing with these issues
   daily.

   It is important that the parliament recognises the value of the
   fundraising industry, in that it raises so many funds for essential
   services in South Australia. The mission statement of the
   Fundraising Institute is: `Through education and training develop
   excellence in professional and ethical fundraising to advance
   philanthropy in the Australian community.' As the fundraising
   profession continues to expand, the expectation is that fundraising
   staff hold qualifications in fundraising and business
   management. The FIA is the only nationally accredited training
   authority for fundraising in Australia and offers a diploma of
   fundraising management.

   It is involved with a wide range of services and activities and I
   will identify a few of them. Members in the Fundraising Institute
   work for fundraising for community services, accommodation, food and
   clothing services, aged care in homes, blood transfusion services,
   drug referral, employment and training services, specialist
   education, counselling, legal justice services, emergency services,
   environmental, educational, religious, cultural, arts, recreational
   and, not to be ignored, development assistance overseas.

   The membership is vast and of high repute. To mention a few: the
   Adelaide Central Mission; Australian Red Cross; Royal Adelaide
   Hospital Research Fund; Royal Flying Doctor Service; Save the
   Children; the Mary Potter Foundation; and, Wetland Care. That is
   selecting a few from the list, but we can see that these
   organisations are of prime importance in South Australia, providing
   essential services to a caring community. The people in charge of
   fundraising are trained by the Fundraising Institute, South
   Australia. We should be proud of them and of the international
   conference to be held next month.
