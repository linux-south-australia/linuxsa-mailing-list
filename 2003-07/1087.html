&gt; Nobody is stopping you making your own brand of beer.  

The government might take issue if I distribute it though,
even at no cost! 

&gt; &gt; We should refuse to purchase any more of this
&gt; &gt; "proprietary" beer and make our own!
&gt; 
&gt; There are some good closed source beers around the place.  
&gt; Take for example Guinness and Coopers Pale/Sparkling.  

Couldn't I argue the same for software?  :)

&gt; Freedom when it comes to beer refers to only two things; 
&gt; choice and price. We have choice.  Just walk into any half 
&gt; reasonable trendy bar and look at the offerings.  They are 
&gt; as varied as the people on this list.   

You may be surprised to discover that they aren't as varied
as you might think. (the beer that is, not the people!)

&gt; Free as in price :-p Free I tell you. That's a whole other 
&gt; matter.  If the great (and utterly terrible) beer makers of 
&gt; the world were to give their product away for free... 
&gt; well that'd spell the end of beer as we know it.  

Why don't they make their money from services and ancillary
products? free beer can be the loss leader product. If enough
people brewed their own beer then they'd have to reduce prices.
The death of the multi-national beer barons might even go by 
un-noticed?

-Rob.

BTW, I'm joking about free (as in freedom) beer, as I'm sure you
know.
