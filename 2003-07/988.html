 &gt; The problem here is that with the BSD style of licensing, the original

If the only ongoing development of a BSD licensed project was carried
out by commercial software vendors who locked up their source, that'd
definitely be a factor.

But it isn't.  Worthwhile projects get continued as open source (with
all the synergies you've mentioned) even in an environment which features
commercial competitors.

... unless, of course, anyone is seriously going to posit that SunOS is
better than FreeBSD :-)

 &gt; What the GPL allows is for you to say is; any synergy created between 
 &gt; mine and others contributions should remain available to me, and anyone 
 &gt; else who wants to use or contribute to it. Granted, it also forces the 
 &gt; second contributor into the same license, but that is hardly an issue - 
 &gt; if you don't like the idea, don't "accept the license" and develop your 
 &gt; own application from scratch and license it how you want. It at least 
 &gt; gives equal rights to both contributors.

That bit which you say is "hardly an issue" happens to be 100% of the
friction and tension between the open-source world and the commercial
software world.  If it wasn't for that "hardly an issue" datapoint,
we wouldn't be having this discussion.  Finally, by *forcing* behaviour
on third parties, it makes any claim to "freedom" from GPL proponents
frankly laughable.

The GPL isn't "free-as-in-speech".  It's "free-as-in-beer";  And it's
selfish, motivated by greed.  The fact that it's greed for source 
code instead of greed for money doesn't make it any more morally pure
than a commercial software license.

I've described a relevent example of the GPL holding-back an open
source project (i.e., it has made adoption of the GIMP by professional
graphic designers essentially impossible).

Can you, or anyone else, provide even *one* example, real or hypothetical,
of BSD licensing resulting in similar damage to an open source project's
potential?

I claim you can't, because the BSD license gives you every real-world
advantage that the GPL gives, with less restrictions.  I.e., the BSD
license is a superset of the GPL.
