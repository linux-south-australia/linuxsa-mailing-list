&gt; &gt; After browsing this mornings diatribe from SCO I am
&gt; &gt; wondering if the time is approaching when the Open Source
&gt; &gt; movement starts to go on the offensive.
&gt; &gt; How long can this concerted attack from SCO be ignored ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The coordinated power of Linux users and Open Source
&gt; &gt; movement is considerable. Maybe some of it should be
&gt; &gt; brought to bear on SCO. I am not sure what form this
&gt; &gt; should take. Others better qualified may have some
&gt; &gt; ideas. It would need to be carefully thought out.
&gt; &gt; World Wide protest action has been done before,
&gt; &gt; but it should take to form of something unique to Linux.

&gt; Together we can rid the world of this substandard, crufty,
&gt; recompile my kernel and reboot for just about any minor
&gt; setting change, using the GUI causes IO throughput to drop,
&gt; so called 'Operating System'. Can you tell I think SCO sucks ? :-)

I'd like to thank SCO for opening my eyes in 1994-5 when
I was doing free tech support[4] for a couple of small businesses.

It was at that time that I reaslised is was on the right
ticket with Linux and FreeBSD and other OSS.

What troubled me most was that SCO something[1] UNIX was very
inflexible and without a compiler not very useful in the
context the systems were being used[2]. and it only had csh,
IIRR =/ so we had to rewrite all of our shell scripts =(
