&gt; &gt; I guess it depends on your point of view.  Personally I'd be delighted
&gt; &gt; if someone found something I'd written good enough to incorporate it
&gt; &gt; into one of their products.  Some people are offended at the fact that
&gt; &gt; other people might make a profit out of their hard work.  I guess it
&gt; &gt; all depends on how self-centered you are, doesn't it?  &lt;g,d,r&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well there's also this scenario:
&gt; 
&gt;   - taxpayer funds software development as research.
&gt;   - company takes research and productises it.
&gt;   - taxpayer buys result, which it 90% owns but pays full price for.

Well, the original code is often a small part of any product. There is a 
huge amount of work that goes into a product over and above writing the 
original code. Testing, making sure that it is usable, figuring out what 
UI customers want and so on.

For example, at Panasas we use FreeBSD as the basis of our NAS. It runs on 
the metadata servers, and it runs on the object based storage devices, and 
we use other open source software including Samba, Kerberos, and etc. 

However, to turn it into a product that can deliver a number of gigabytes 
a second (larger than three) of read and write bandwidth to a Linux 
cluster has taken an enormous amount of work, and is arguably more 
valuable than the other pieces of the puzzle. Of course, that has involved 
writing a lot of software ourselves, and extremely tricky parallel IO 
software at that. [1]

&gt; which the GPL avoids.

Well, it might also mean that seriously ambitious projects don't get 
started or don't attract the investment they need because of the risk that 
others will be able to rip off all your hard work before you get to 
recover your investment and make a profit. 

[1] Yes, I am aware of Lustre :-)
