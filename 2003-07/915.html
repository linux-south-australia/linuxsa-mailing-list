&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't think of anything scary about it at all. Perhaps you couldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;work out how to install bash, or how to edit .xinitrc ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's what end users who can't even work out how to log on don't *want*
&gt;&gt;to do though;-)

&gt;It is a shame that so many people have to be told what their computer
&gt;should look and act like. I much prefer to have it MY way.

&gt;
[1]  Does FreeBSD install with no assumptions made as to drivers or 
Xwindoing system  to use as default? My guess is that some decisions had 
to be made to allow it to be minimally useable, and I think that the 
same should be done by making a GUI available.

&gt;I wonder how many potential FreeBSD users logon, see twm and bail.
&gt;  
&gt;
I think more than anyone wants to admit.

&gt;The documentation is amazing and the community is really helpful (even
&gt;#freebsd on freenode is reasonably helpful)

[1]  (Ok, we have Evolution in one thread, politics in another, a few 
references to Unix wars, maybe religion and abortion coming up in two 
more....ah what the heck, I'll respond to this! :-D ) I have to say 
this, mostly in self interest as I would love a an easier way to get a 
GUI configured in the FreeBSD installation ....
