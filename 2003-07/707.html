&gt;
&gt; Legislative Council
&gt; Wednesday 16 July 2003
&gt; Matters of Interest
&gt;
&gt; STATE SUPPLY (PROCUREMENT OF SOFTWARE) AMENDMENT BILL
&gt;
&gt; Adjourned debate on second reading. (Continued from 9 July.)
&gt;
&gt; The Hon. J. GAZZOLA:
&gt;
&gt;   I indicate that the government does not support this bill. While the
&gt;   government does not object to the aim of the amendment, it believes
&gt;   that there are more effective mechanisms for ensuring that the
&gt;   government can use all available effective technology including open
&gt;   source software. 

I remember that an arguement like this was made by the ISC in Oregon....

&gt;   Where open source products have reached sufficient maturity, they
&gt;   can provide an alternative option to proprietary software, provided
&gt;   they meet the business requirements of government. 

&gt; It is not necessary to legislate for specific products or services 
&gt; that can or should be used by government nor is legislation deemed 
&gt; appropriate or a  practical mechanism to mandate their particular 
&gt; goods or services. 

Seems as though he is saying...if this stuff is so good, why do we need 
a law to make people buy it...

&gt; The policy approach has several advantages over the legislative 
&gt; solution proposed. They are:
&gt;
&gt;   1. It enables the board to support the policies of the government
&gt;      of the day; and
&gt;
&gt;   2. Policy can be more easily and quickly developed and/or modified
&gt;      to accommodate changes to procurement practices and/or strategies. 

Same arguement used in Oregon.

&gt; The PRESIDENT:
&gt;
&gt;   I am getting very disturbed. I have asked a number of times today
&gt;   that decorum and dignity be maintained in the house. There are
&gt;   people standing around talking everywhere. I have raised this matter
&gt;   on a number of occasions. I am going to start dropping the
&gt;   hammer. Members will conduct themselves in a dignified manner, as
&gt;   befits Her Majesty's Legislative Council. I ask those members who
&gt;   are not debating to return to their seats. If they need to talk to
&gt;   other members, they should utilise the lobbies.

Linuxsa in the balcony?   :-D

&gt; The Hon. J. GAZZOLA:
&gt; the  ability and capacity to react quickly to market forces is an
&gt;   important asset in the armory of the modern procurement business
&gt;   strategist. Legislating of product usage is not seen as a practical
&gt;   solution in such an environment.
&gt;
&gt;   The Hon. Ian Gilfillan implies that his proposed amendments to the
&gt;   current legislation will realise a value outcome in the expenditure
&gt;   of public money for one particular commodity group only.

Same arguement as in Oregon
