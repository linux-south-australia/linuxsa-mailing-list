 &gt; &gt; What do you see as the deficiency in the BSD license which doesn't
 &gt; &gt; allow "... others to benefit from [your] gift"?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Quite simply the BSD licence allows the holder of the code or software
 &gt; to restrict access, distribution, etc to they changes or the whole
 &gt; of the code or software the distribute.

But that's not "your" gift -- that's the new developer's gift!

What the GPL does is to remove my right to license my own code in the
manner that I see fit, if that code happens to add value to a GPL 
program.

Think carefully about that statement.

The original author has said, "You are only allowed to make a gift under
the following conditions... If you fail to meet those conditions,
your gift is prohibited."

We're only talking about enhancements here (i.e., new gifts), not
the original code.  Nothing on god's green earth can restrict access
to the original un-enhanced code, whether it's BSD or GPL.  So no 
part of this argument is about "restricting access", despite your
rather unfortunate misuse of words above.

In the GPL world, the only person who has the right to *choose* the
license terms of their own creative output is the original programmer
who wrote the very first public release.  All further development 
after that point has license terms imposed on it.  It's *not*
free-as-in-speech, it's free-as-in-beer.

We're outraged when we hear about record companies dictating license
terms to artists in discussions about the MP3-wars;  Yet the very same
people talking about software licenses routinely fail to bat eyelids
when the same thing happens in the open-source software community.

 &gt; &gt; The difference is on the side of the licensee, who gets to
 &gt; &gt; choose whether to use software which comes with distribution
 &gt; &gt; restrictions (GPL) or software which doesn't come with
 &gt; &gt; distribution restrictions (BSD).
 &gt; &gt; Note that both types of license don't impose any USE restrictions.
 &gt; 
 &gt; i don't understand the distributions restrictions you talk about here
 &gt; for the GPL?

Then you don't understand the GPL, because the GPL is all about
distribution restriction!

The GPL distribution restrictions are the bits which say that you're
not permitted to distribute any changes/modifications/enhancements to
a GPL-licensed program unless you also distribute source code to those
modifications.

If you're not altering the code, then the GPL functions just like any
other open-source license.  

That's why the only people on the planet which the GPL inhibits are
software developers.

 &gt; and the potential that any commercial competitor can compete
 &gt; with you using *your* code and IP?
 
Basically, yes -- It's not possible to gain a competitive advantage 
with GPL software.  It's not possible to integrate a new feature without
supplying source code;  Refer back to earlier parts of this conversation
where we were talking about the utter impossiblity of a GPL-licensed
software package ever being used seriously by the graphic design industry
to see a real-world effect of this imposition.

 &gt; isn't that kinda the whole point of the GPL and FSF to
 &gt; level the playing field and to learn from each others works?
 &gt; then everyone benifits from the sharing of code and IP?

Sorry, but the Great Socialist Experiment has failed, and it has been
proved throughout the world that "everyone" doesn't in fact benefit 
from what you're talking about.

 &gt; instead of forming IP monopolies?

There is nothing inherently bad about a monopoly.  Abuse of a monopoly
is bad;  Inefficiencies created by monopoly complacency are bad;  But
when you look at the big picture, virtually every social and economic
advance humanity has made since industrialization has had a monopoly
somewhere behind it.

So I fail to see why forming IP monopolies is automatically bad.

 &gt; &gt; That's why I'm inflicted with insurmountable cynicism whenever I
 &gt; &gt; hear RMS prattle about "Free-as-in-speech" GPL software.  It's
 &gt; &gt; free-as-in-speech to use, free-as-in-speech to write, but terribly
 &gt; &gt; expensive to redistribute afterwards.
 &gt; 
 &gt; why? only because you also are releasing that software under the GPL?
 &gt; how is that expensive? surely it is the same as releasing the same
 &gt; code under a BSD style licence?
 
Only if your view of "expensive" is restricted to money.

 &gt; i do think that the "freedoms" the BSD style licences give you
 &gt; are quite overrated.

They're the freedoms which have allowed hundreds of products to be
built on the FreeBSD platform which haven't been built on the Linux
platform :-)  Embedded systems from Intel, IBM, Cisco; Companies like
Whistle Communications;  Operating systems like Mac OS/X.

 &gt; but that said i don't understand the
 &gt; 'restrictions' that the GPL limits you to?[2] maybe i have over
 &gt; looked something, but surely someone can explain it clearly without
 &gt; comparing it to the BSD licence... or perhaps provide a URL to a
 &gt; good source.

Here it is in a nutshell:

If you are an end user:

   BSD LICENSE:  You can download the code for free and use it in any
     way you see fit.

   GPL LICENSE:  You can download the code for free and use it in any
     way you see fit.


If you want to supply the software to someone else:

   BSD LICENSE:  Give it freely;  No worries!

   GPL LICENSE:  Give it freely;  No worries!


If you want to incorporate the software, unchanged, into your own product:

   BSD LICENSE:  Go for it!  Put something in your manual's fine-print to
      say that you've done it.

   GPL LICENSE:  Go for it!


If you want to add a feature to the software;  Or fix a bug;  Or make
some other change:

   BSD LICENSE:  Go for it!  Keep a private version of the software with
     as many changes as you like.

   GPL LICENSE:  Go for it!  Keep a private version of the software with
     as many changes as you like.


If you want to give your private version of the software to someone else:

   BSD LICENSE:  Do what you want.

   GPL LICENSE:  You may only do this if you *also* provide source code
      for your bugfix, change, or feature addition.


If you've been distributing bugfixes, changes, or feature additions for the
purpose of differentiating your product from your competitors:

   BSD LICENSE:  No worries!

   GPL LICENSE:  We'll see you in court.

Hope that helps to summarize the differences;  At the end of the day,
end users and original authors are treated the same by both licenses;
Developers are penalized by the GPL, because they are not permitted
to choose the license terms for the code they've written if that code
is part of a GPL software project.
