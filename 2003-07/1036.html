I might repeat that BSD and GNU licences are the same in that regard,
except that I don't agree with you.  GPL says I'm free to do whatever
I like with the software except give it away.  In fact it doesn't even
quite say that: I can even give it away, so long as I do so on the same
terms that it was given to me.


&gt; What you've just said is more like the BSD license:  You're free to
&gt; do whatever you like, up to and including selling the fruits of my
&gt; labour without paying me, as long as you're honest about where you got
&gt; the code from.
&gt;
&gt; How, preceisely, does the GPL provide more freedom than that?

I think it comes down to who's freedom is being protected.  Allow that
the world is divided into those who make software and those who use it.
GNU protects freedom for the people who use software.  BSD doesn't.
