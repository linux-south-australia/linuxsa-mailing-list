Continuing on from a couple of wireless threads that have been on the list
of late....

Someone (can't remember who) suggested using a D-Link DWL-604+
[<A HREF="http://www.dlink.com.au/products/broadband/dsl604+/">http://www.dlink.com.au/products/broadband/dsl604+/</A>]. Which is a DSL
modem/gateway/router all-in-one, seems like a good idea if you want wireless
and have a ADSL connection. 

But Billion also make a similar piece of kit, which is available from a
local supplier, and is quite a bit cheaper (almost half the price).
[<A HREF="http://www.pcrange.biz">http://www.pcrange.biz</A>]. Apparently these are fairly new to Australia, so I
wouldn't expect many people to have them, but was wondering if anyone had
any experience with Billion's gear in general ? cheap and nasty ? anyone
using their normal DSL modem (without the wireless) ? 

They also seem to be packaging 2 (either PCI or PCMCIA) cards with these
Billion AP's for an additional $70. These cards are from a company called
Minatar [<A HREF="http://www.pcrange.biz/index.php?page">http://www.pcrange.biz/index.php?page</A>=w_wireless_cardbus&id=1],
anyone had any experience using these ? 

With regards to linux compatibility for wireless cards, a  few people
suggested using a PCMCIA card and a cradle. But surely there are some
wireless PCI cards out there which have linux drivers ? anyone know of any
which are known to work ?

thanks
Andrew
