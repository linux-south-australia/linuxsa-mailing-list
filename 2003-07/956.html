 &gt; Perhaps the claim of selflessness might sometimes be exaggerated, but
 &gt; there's no question that they put in effort for little or no financial
 &gt; reward.  There are many projects started where the original developers
 &gt; obviously don't have the skill to pull off the end result.  I suppose
 &gt; at least some of them were GPLed because those same original developers
 &gt; just wanted the final result; and that's not entirely selfless.  But
 &gt; I think the majority of GPL their projects to guarantee the freedom.
 &gt; Is that selfish?
 
Yes, because the GPL doesn't guarantee the freedom of their own hard
work any more than the BSD license does.

What it does do, however, is to guarantee the freedom of someone else's
hard work -- Which is a pretty selfish act, given the reasoning and
justifications you've included elsewhere in this discussion.

 &gt; &gt; if they were *REALLY* selfless they wouldn't have a problem
 &gt; &gt; with someone else taking those "gifts" and making a buck off them if
 &gt; &gt; they thought it was worth making a go of it.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The GPL doesn't stop you making a buck off someone else's gifts.  You
 &gt; and I are both perfectly entitled to demand any amount we like for
 &gt; passing, say, GIMP, to a third person. 

Yes, you're right:  I can charge a copying and media fee for the act
of passing the GIMP.  As long as I don't charge it for the GIMP itself,
and as long as I haven't made any extensions to the GIMP which I 
haven't provided source code for.

The GPL denies me the right to express a competitive advantage by
using openly available code as the basis for a product that's better
than anyone else's.  I can't take the GIMP, mix it together with 
(say) a Pantone color package (to turn it into something that's genuinely
useful to the graphic design industry) and sell the result -- because
the Pantone system is patented, and I wouldn't be able to include source.

So I can't build a product that competes with Photoshop in the graphic
design industry;  And I'm limited in the ways that I can "make GIMP
better".

You own and run a business.  You know how important competitive
advantage is.  I don't understand why you'd have issue with this.

*MOST* people don't actually give a shit about any of this.  Generally
speaking, the only people who really, really care are software authors
who use the GPL to prevent a company from making a buck from their
work (which, as I've said, is a perfectly fine attitude, until those
very same authors try to portray themselves as selfless heroes when 
they're talking about how great free software is).

 &gt; The BSD is what you use to
 &gt; deny someone else the right to make a buck.

&lt;boggle&gt;  How?  If someone wants to take my BSD-licensed code, whack
their name all over it, and sell it for a million dollars, that's their
perogative.

How does the BSD license stop anyone from making a buck?  

And can you explain your reasoning to Sun, HP, etc...?
