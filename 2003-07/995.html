   &gt;  &gt; What the GPL allows is for you to say is; any synergy created between
   &gt;  &gt; mine and others contributions should remain available to me, and anyone
   &gt;  &gt; else who wants to use or contribute to it. Granted, it also forces the
   &gt;  &gt; second contributor into the same license, but that is hardly an issue -
   &gt;  &gt; if you don't like the idea, don't "accept the license" and develop your
   &gt;  &gt; own application from scratch and license it how you want. It at least
   &gt;  &gt; gives equal rights to both contributors.
   &gt;  
   &gt;  That bit which you say is "hardly an issue" happens to be 100% of the
   &gt;  friction and tension between the open-source world and the commercial
   &gt;  software world.  If it wasn't for that "hardly an issue" datapoint,
   &gt;  we wouldn't be having this discussion.  Finally, by *forcing* behaviour
   &gt;  on third parties, it makes any claim to "freedom" from GPL proponents
   &gt;  frankly laughable.
   &gt;  
   &gt;  The GPL isn't "free-as-in-speech".  It's "free-as-in-beer";  And it's
   &gt;  selfish, motivated by greed.  The fact that it's greed for source
   &gt;  code instead of greed for money doesn't make it any more morally pure
   &gt;  than a commercial software license.

lol.

GPL source code is a philanthropic gift to be enjoyed in the future.  It's guarranteed "free-speech" permanently, even for derived works, to be built upon by others, for the continued enjoyment of all.

Source code freedom is just that, freedom.  The BSD provides that, but in a way that's only a subset of what the GPL provides.

I think it's a bit rich to say that it's "selfish, motivated by greed".  It would be equally wrong for me to say that people developing software under the BSD licence do so because they like being exploited by big companies :-)

   &gt;  I've described a relevent example of the GPL holding-back an open
   &gt;  source project (i.e., it has made adoption of the GIMP by professional
   &gt;  graphic designers essentially impossible).
   &gt;  
   &gt;  Can you, or anyone else, provide even *one* example, real or hypothetical,
   &gt;  of BSD licensing resulting in similar damage to an open source project's
   &gt;  potential?

Sure, ok.  What about ArgoUML and Poseidon for UML.  ArgoUML is a BSD developed UML design tool written in Java.  It doesn't seem to have moved along very much (last release Oct 7, 2002).  It's nice - but it suffers from "write once crawl everywhere".  Poseidon seems to have taken over from ArgoUML - releases occuring this year, and playing with it, it's a much nicer product.  Will ArgoUML continue to be developed?  Time will tell, but that's the first example of thought of.

Can you name even *one* example, real or hypothetical, of a non-infrastructure piece of software developed under a BSD licence that is a killer-application? Something Aunt-Nelly would use? [1]

Of course not, if there's a buck to be made, people will throw away any community-minded intentions and not give back to the community upon which their work has been built upon.  "We stand upon the shoulders of giants, unless we cut the legs out from under them".

   &gt;  I claim you can't, because the BSD license gives you every real-world
   &gt;  advantage that the GPL gives, with less restrictions.  I.e., the BSD
   &gt;  license is a superset of the GPL.

Except no-one will develop any user-level or desktop software under a BSD licence.  BSD software is great, but it won't get out of the back-office because of the greed of individuals.  That's not a bad thing - again I say "horses for courses"[2] - but it will affect where it gets adopted.

It seems you agree with Bill Gates' letter to Hobbyists which said (something like), "who can afford to professional work for nothing?".  The answer is of course those who develop under the GPL.

Michael...

[1] Silly of me to draw the line here.  Oh well, let's see if the google-ities can prove me wrong.
[2] I'm not arguing an anti-BSD line.  I'm arguing along an anti-anti-GPL line.
