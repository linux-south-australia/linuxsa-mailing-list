STATE SUPPLY (PROCUREMENT OF SOFTWARE) AMENDMENT BILL

Adjourned debate on second reading. (Continued from 9 July.)

The Hon. J. GAZZOLA:

   I indicate that the government does not support this bill. While the
   government does not object to the aim of the amendment, it believes
   that there are more effective mechanisms for ensuring that the
   government can use all available effective technology including open
   source software. Open source software, or OSS, is not generally
   owned by its users but is licensed. The licence defines the terms
   and conditions for use of the software. The distinguishing features
   of OSS are that the software source code is openly published, is
   frequently available at no charge and is often developed by
   voluntary effort.

   However, under the open source model, developers sometimes can and
   do charge for their software but cannot claim exclusive ownership or
   intellectual property to the code, thereby allowing others to
   further develop and distribute the code. There are several areas of
   software development where open source software is available, such
   as operating systems, desktop software, databases and web
   servers. In the South Australian government, there are a number of
   open source web site implementations. SA Central is one such
   example. The Department for Administrative and Information Services
   is actively observing the software market in Australia and overseas
   and communicating with other jurisdictions on open source
   applications as well as considering the long-term implications,
   performance and value to be obtained from open source software
   compared to proprietary software.

   Where open source products have reached sufficient maturity, they
   can provide an alternative option to proprietary software, provided
   they meet the business requirements of government. The outcome that
   the Hon. Ian Gilfillan is trying to achieve, the government
   believes, would be better achieved through changes to procurement
   policy which are currently underway. Cabinet has approved the
   drafting of a bill to replace the State Supply Act 1985 with a state
   procurement act and envisages that the new legislation will be
   general to allow greater flexibility for government policy to
   implement procurement practices. In particular, the State Supply
   Board is seeking, through a legislative framework, to broaden the
   act to provide leadership in all procurement activities. This will
   be achieved by the streamlining of accountability frameworks and,
   where appropriate, encouraging procurement activities to support
   local business, reflect environmentally sustainable strategies and
   support the remedy of social injustice.

   A key objective of the proposed new legislation is that it will
   remain general rather than be specific, so as to provide greater
   flexibility for government policy to influence government
   procurement policies and practices. The changes proposed by the
   Hon. Ian Gilfillan can be facilitated through procurement policy
   rather than through legislation. The outcome will be the same as
   that proposed by the Hon. Ian Gilfillan. It is not necessary to
   legislate for specific products or services that can or should be
   used by government nor is legislation deemed appropriate or a
   practical mechanism to mandate their particular goods or
   services. The policy approach has several advantages over the
   legislative solution proposed. They are:

   1. It enables the board to support the policies of the government
      of the day; and

   2. Policy can be more easily and quickly developed and/or modified
      to accommodate changes to procurement practices and/or strategies.

The PRESIDENT:

   I am getting very disturbed. I have asked a number of times today
   that decorum and dignity be maintained in the house. There are
   people standing around talking everywhere. I have raised this matter
   on a number of occasions. I am going to start dropping the
   hammer. Members will conduct themselves in a dignified manner, as
   befits Her Majesty's Legislative Council. I ask those members who
   are not debating to return to their seats. If they need to talk to
   other members, they should utilise the lobbies.

The Hon. J. GAZZOLA:

   Thank you, Mr President. Policy tends to be more flexible, and it is
   seen as a vehicle or mechanism that can facilitate and respond to
   change. In particular, when dealing in a marketplace such as the
   information technology field, where change is the only constant, the
   ability and capacity to react quickly to market forces is an
   important asset in the armory of the modern procurement business
   strategist. Legislating of product usage is not seen as a practical
   solution in such an environment.

   The Hon. Ian Gilfillan implies that his proposed amendments to the
   current legislation will realise a value outcome in the expenditure
   of public money for one particular commodity group only. As part of
   the review process of current legislation, it is proposed that
   obtaining value in the expenditure of public money for all goods and
   services will be a key objective of any new procurement
   legislation. This will provide the flexibility required to include
   OSS as a procurement option by policy. An administrative, rather
   than a legislative, approach is preferred because the IT field
   changes rapidly, and it is difficult to change legislation quickly
   to keep up with the developments in IT.

The Hon. KATE REYNOLDS secured the adjournment of the debate.
