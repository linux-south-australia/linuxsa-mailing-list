I watched Ken park last weekend and i didnt think it was a great movie. It
was plugged to be a movie that was supposed to be confronting of shocking
but it never really carried a good strong story. The Sex scenes were not
too over the top, but there was a scene showing a male masterbation scene
whilst he was asphyxiating himself which i beleive would have been the
strongest point for censorship. As far as movies go i beleive that it is
not as strong or confronting as Requiem for a dream.

&gt; Whilst I havent seen the film (a decent screening of the film would be
&gt; ex), there is no real debate that adding a bit of contentious sex and
&gt; violence to a film has been an effective way for directors to get
&gt; attention for their films, however an interesting question is, can
&gt; australian national cinema be considered art if it repeatedly sinks to
&gt; cheap porno tactics? and is Ken Parks use of sex appropraite to the
&gt; context of the story and not just porn?
&gt;
&gt; It is definatly a pity that any film could be censored, thus preventing
&gt; many film goers (as apposed to internet regulars)  from making up their
&gt; own mind, and being more well rounded human beings for the experience.
&gt; After all isnt that one of the benefits of art?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Question is, is the film worthy as a movie in itself or was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the real sex added as a cheap publicity stunt to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(predictably) get the movie wide ranging free publicity?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;It varies. Ken Park is definitely worthy as a film, though it's not for
&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone. It perhaps is guilty of having more explicit sex than it
&gt;&gt;&gt; needed
&gt;&gt;&gt;to, but what Hollywood movie isn't? In fact, given the subject matter,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;sexually explicit scenes are more essential to this movie than they were
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;(say) Titanic...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I understand the main difference between Ken Park and other movies is
&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;real instead of simulated sex is shown.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My concern is that should this film be successful more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;directors may push for real intercourse in their features.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may become a race to the bottom to see who can add more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nudity/violence/sex/drugs/etc to gain the publicity that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;follows the making of a movie with the status quo +10%.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;But why would that be a concern? If you don't like it, don't see it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Besides, it's already a race to see who can add more
&gt;&gt;&gt;nudity/violence/sex/drugs/etc in movies, but the mainstream companies do
&gt;&gt;&gt; it
&gt;&gt;&gt;in a way that removes the impact from the audience, hence bluntening the
&gt;&gt;&gt;blow of whatever the movie is about. For the most part, the publicity is
&gt;&gt;&gt;generated by the efforts at banning the movie. If there was no effort to
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;ban
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Baise Moi or Ken Park, I would probably never have heard about them, let
&gt;&gt;&gt;alone seen them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If I don't like it I can refuse to see it, true, but my original email
&gt;&gt;eluded to the fact that other directors could chase the easy money
&gt;&gt; (nothing
&gt;&gt;is easier or cheaper to do than sex) instead of making plot driven, well
&gt;&gt;acted, thought provoking movies.  It may leave few movies worth watching.
&gt;&gt;  I
&gt;&gt;shudder to think action movies may be heading towards Charlie's Angels II
&gt;&gt;quality for example, especially with the proliferation of cheap CGI.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Without seeing it myself I can't judge, but if the movie
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;turns out to be trash the director has already won anyway, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;my money would have been spent.  It's a Catch 22.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;That's the problem! Most of the people calling for the banning of movies
&gt;&gt;&gt;haven't seen them... While I have no problem with them not seeing them,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt;&gt;don't see how they can have anything intelligent to say about the value
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt;such a move without having seen it. Thing is, if it wasn't banned, then
&gt;&gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;could read reviews by your favourite reviewer, perhaps watch the
&gt;&gt;&gt; trailer,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and make the decision for yourself, just as you do with every other film
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;you
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;ever see. Sometimes, you'd decide it sucked, and sometimes you'd like
&gt;&gt;&gt; it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;But it's your decision. Right now, you can't make that decision for
&gt;&gt;&gt;yourself. You can, however, read reviews...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Reviews aren't a problem as the Internet is littered with both personal
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;professional reviews for Ken Park.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The only reason why this movie was banned is because of the real sex.  It
&gt;&gt;ceases to be a movie fit for cinemas and becomes pornography sold at sex
&gt;&gt;shops.  Overall this shouldn't be a debate about one movie that will
&gt;&gt;probably be forgotten next year, but a broader look at whether real
&gt;&gt; versus
&gt;&gt;simulated should be allowed in cinemas, and what age groups should be
&gt;&gt;allowed to view it.  What do I think of that?  Well, I hope we don't end
&gt;&gt; up
&gt;&gt;turning the local Greater Union into a porn flick theatre.
