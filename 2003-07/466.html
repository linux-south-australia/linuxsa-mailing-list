Matt I would be very interested to see how it goes.
Given the cost and limited options I am keen to keep in touch with this PCI 
cards performance.

&gt; Are you intentionally trying to be an annoying prick David?   Or is that 
&gt; just how you are?  Twice in two days you've been picking needlessly at 
&gt; things I've posted or done.  WHat's the issue?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; a) getting PCI cards that work with wireless is the issue
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is it?
&gt;
&gt; Yes.  Since the DLink PCI card got a rev there hasn't been a cheap PCI 
&gt; one available - this has been discussed quite a few times on this very 
&gt; list.  Have you missed those?
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; b) I've d/led the driver tar ball but I cannot tell 100% if indeed it
&gt;&gt; &gt; does work with the PCI card
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well the problem there is 15" in front of the screen isn't it?
&gt;
&gt; Tell you what, if you want to be a smartarse about it - you download it 
&gt; and see if you can tell.  It's a series of binary objects (a binary 
&gt; driver currently) with no documentation.  I'm a competent programmer and 
&gt; integrator but without the actual hardware I do find it a tad more 
&gt; involved ... Heck, I've only got an honours computer science degree and 
&gt; almost 10 years of industry experience, but hell, I must be a moron.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; c) the email from pcrange is at least saying they'll be supporting it
&gt;&gt; &gt; under linux and it'll be getting better (and hopefully oss not a 
&gt;&gt; binary
&gt;&gt; &gt; driver)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And?
&gt;
&gt; And what?  I thought that people on "linuxsa" would be please about a 
&gt; company saying that YES they were going to support linux on a cheap and 
&gt; useful piece of kit.  I could be wrong.
