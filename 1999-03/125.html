&gt; Now for a really stupid question... How do I get the modem to listen to what

No.  The commas would never be correct.  You could do

    (echo -n "+++"; sleep 1; echo "ATO1") &gt; /dev/cua2

however you need to ensure the appropriate period of silence.  I
think you will find that the +++ sequence could be sufficient to
cause a flurry of PPP control messages to go back and forth, which
would defeat your purpose.

When you configure your modem for dial-out, one of the commands
strings you are likely to use is AT&Dx, where x indicates what you
want to occur when you lower DTR.  Commonly you would use an x
which instructs the modem to hang up (e.g. AT&D2 or AT&D3 for many
brands of modem.)  You could use AT&D1 (it works for my modems) to
cause the modem to drop to online command mode.  Thus you would
lower and then raise DTR on /dev/cua2, then issue echo AT01 &gt; /dev/cua2.
I don't know how you lower DTR.  Read up on your serial port,
particularly looking at ioctl or termio.
