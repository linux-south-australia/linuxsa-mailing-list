&gt; &gt; Please note this is not stated in a mean or nasty way, so no flame wars,

&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I would be happy to do it if:
&gt; 
&gt; a) I had the time
&gt; b) I was any good at writing scripts
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, neither of those is true, so I won't be writing one. :)
&gt; 
&gt; On a related note, I'd be interested to know which (if any) of the HTML
&gt; editors (the WYSIWYG ones) create case-sensitive web pages... Anyone
&gt; know? Is this something that should be brought to the attention of the
&gt; tool-makers?
I believe that creating case-sensitive links is the 'correct' way as far
as WWW and html go.
The problem occurs when you have different interpretations of the
filesystem.
(And I believe that the win95 method of automatically showing filenames
as always having a capital first letter is probably the party in the
wrong. Gee, that was unexpected ;)
However, a bit of manipulation with the file mounting options might help
you out.
If that fails, it shouldn't be too hard to modify the joliet/vfat
modules to have an extra option to convert Aaaaaaaaaa filenames to
aaaaaaaaaaa. (if it doesn't already exist.)

Failing that, or if it's too much effort, you could always make a script
that goes thru and makes a copy of the cd tree, and populates with
symbolic links, giving the symbolic links all lowercase names where
appropriate.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey There,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I have got it up and running. The first thing I noticed about the CD is
&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the directory and file names are all lowercase, while the HTML files on
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; CD they have put capital letters in for the first characters. Not a
&gt; &gt; problem
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in Win95, but it *is* in Linux. When you click on the link, and the
&gt; &gt; address
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bar thingo shows the new address, if there is any capitals in the name,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; change them to lowercase letters and it should work fine.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;the APC CD has had this problem for a long time -- I have emailed them
&gt; &gt; &gt;about it previously, but got no response, and saw no change. Surely it
&gt; &gt; &gt;can't be hard for them to sort this out... I assume they are using some
&gt; &gt; &gt;sort of WYSIWYG editor, and not editing source code manually, and their
&gt; &gt; &gt;tool is probably designed for Windows, so it is probably causing the
&gt; &gt; &gt;problems, but even so, I'm sure that they could write a script to change
&gt; &gt; &gt;all links to lowercase, or even do some actual cross-checking with the
&gt; &gt; &gt;filesystem... Maybe if we all wrote to them, they'd fix it...  Anyway,
&gt; &gt; &gt;that's my grumble for today... :)
