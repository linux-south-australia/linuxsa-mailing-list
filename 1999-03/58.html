Hi Richard
re:
&gt; Hmmm, every time a user logs on, or when they access a particular drive?
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't think there was anything that could be run when logon processing
&gt; was happening, but you certainly can run preexec scripts for users when
&gt; they access a particular drive, like say, netlogon.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually, I think all this can be done with roaming profiles as well.
&gt; 


If you use a preexec statement in the [netlogon] section
it will execute at login time every time, because this share is
always accessed. 
It happens before the netlogon is offered (PREexec) so it can create the
login batch file that is about to be read via the netlogon share.
This is one of the things we generate on the fly from a template.

It also less conveniently fires a second time a bit latter in the
process so the script has to accomodate this.

Here is a snip from a real life smb.conf calling the script
I mentioned.

&gt;  [netlogon]
&gt;    root preexec = /root/scripts/smb pre %u %m %I
&gt;    comment = Network Logon Service
&gt;    path = /home/%u/.smb/netlogon/
&gt;    guest ok = yes
&gt;    writable = yes
&gt;    share modes = no
&gt;    write list = brian

When called with "pre" as the first param this script does all the
setup stuff I was mentioning. (It also does otherthings when
called with other params for example when people log out)

The sharing of the home directories if used is a nice point to do
general login & logout processing such as firewall adjustments
because the preexec & postexec are called only once each. Unfortunately
this is too late in the process to use to create the batch file. 

and yes we use all this stuff in conjunction with roving
profiles/desktops where the client machines are 95/98.

all in all pretty cool way to get linux into win/nt sites
and its rock solid.

Regards
Adrian
