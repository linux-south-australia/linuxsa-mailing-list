I have installed RedHat 5.2 and "all is well in the garden"

I even mounted my C drive as a dos drive and can access it . However when I
try to mount my D drive the RedHat diskmanager pops up an error dialogue and
says "aren't you trying to mount a logical drive in an extended dos
partition" . Of course it is absolutely correct and you would think it would
go on to tell me how it should be done, but it doesn't .  So how's it done.?
I keep all my data on D:, so it's the drive I really want to access.

Then there is my Jazz drive. If I boot my computer with the Jazz drive
switched on, Linux will not boot. It reports  some kind of PANIC. I have had
a thought that it might be due to SCSI IDs. My external Jazz drive has a
SCSI ID  = 1 and my internal Linux boot drive has ID = 6 . I have to (or
want to) leave the Jazz set to 1 so that I can plug it into another device
that is totally intolerant towards SCSI IDs and will only accept 1.  Can it
be done?

Finally. My Linux is set as a dual boot with Win 98. My Win 98 is running
two graphics cards. All works well. I was just wondering if anyone has seen
any info on getting Linux to support both cards. Just a wish here.

So . Any help will be greatly appreciated.

&gt;Hi.
&gt;
&gt;I'm pretty sure that you can set the mount options for the cdrom in the
&gt;/etc/fstab to allow browsers to accept mangled case filenames. Take a peek
&gt;at the man page for mount, (I will too, race ya!) Its something like
&gt;sloppy or slack, and it allows you to use windows generated web pages with
&gt;windows generated filenames. (Actually, I think the problem is in the way
&gt;windows capitalises the first letter of every filename, and it being out
&gt;of sync with the html editor's idea of how the world works)
&gt;
&gt;Hmm. no, it isn't sloppy, it's   check=relaxed  have a look under man
&gt;mount and scroll down to the options for iso9660 filesystems...
&gt;
&gt;       check=r[elaxed] / check=s[trict]
&gt;              With  check=relaxed,  a filename is first converted
&gt;              to lower case before doing  the  lookup.   This  is
&gt;              probably  only  meaningful together with norock and
&gt;              map=normal.  (Default: check=strict.)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Hey There,
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I have got it up and running. The first thing I noticed about the CD is
that
&gt;&gt; &gt; the directory and file names are all lowercase, while the HTML files on
the
&gt;&gt; &gt; CD they have put capital letters in for the first characters. Not a
problem
&gt;&gt; &gt; in Win95, but it *is* in Linux. When you click on the link, and the
address
&gt;&gt; &gt; bar thingo shows the new address, if there is any capitals in the name,
&gt;&gt; &gt; change them to lowercase letters and it should work fine.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; the APC CD has had this problem for a long time -- I have emailed them
&gt;&gt; about it previously, but got no response, and saw no change. Surely it
&gt;&gt; can't be hard for them to sort this out... I assume they are using some
&gt;&gt; sort of WYSIWYG editor, and not editing source code manually, and their
&gt;&gt; tool is probably designed for Windows, so it is probably causing the
&gt;&gt; problems, but even so, I'm sure that they could write a script to change
&gt;&gt; all links to lowercase, or even do some actual cross-checking with the
&gt;&gt; filesystem... Maybe if we all wrote to them, they'd fix it...  Anyway,
&gt;&gt; that's my grumble for today... :)

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; As to getting Word Perfect going. I did:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; cd ~
&gt;&gt; &gt; cp /mnt/cdrom/bandbust/wplinux/guilg/guilg00.gz .
&gt;&gt; &gt; tar zxf guilg00.gz
&gt;&gt; &gt; cd guilg00
&gt;&gt; &gt; ./Runme
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Obvisously, you'll have to double check that I've got the file names
and
&gt;&gt; &gt; thing correct, as I only did them from memory. Word Perfect runs
perfectly
&gt;&gt; &gt; on my Slackware machine.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Cheers.

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I tried reading my April APC mag disc with Netscape RH 5.2. on a PC
which
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;also has Win98/IE4. CD is Hitachi 24X. Windows/IE4 reads the disc
&gt;&gt; &gt; perfectly,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;with Linux selecting many items returned an error message "Netscape is
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;unable to find the file or directory named
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;"mnt/cdrom/bandbuster/default.htm, - or the same file in "New&Hot,
&gt;&gt; &gt; Workshop,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;ISP kits etc. Just to annoy me , however, if I select file - open and
the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;appropriate file name it magically finds them. Can anyone offer any
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;suggestions as to what might be wrong.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Part two.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I got guilg00.gz on to my hard drive to install WP, then followed the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;instructions . Entering "gunzip gui00.gz; tar -xvf gui00 as per
&gt;&gt; &gt; instructions
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;returns message:
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;gui00.gz: No such file or directory
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;tar: Cannot open gui00:No such file or directory
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;tar :Error is not recoverable: Exiting now
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I have tried any other combination of names etc with no result. Has
anyone
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;succeeded in getting it up and running? And if so how?
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks.
