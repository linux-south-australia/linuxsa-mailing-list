Hello People,

At this/next month's LinuxSA meeting we will have a representative from
the Playford Centre (<A HREF="http://www.playford.com.au/">http://www.playford.com.au/</A>) doing a small presentation.
In short the Playford Centre is a group that can provide Venture
Capital to companies that fulfill their criteria.

Included is a forward from the Playford Centre giving a bit of information.

Regards,

Matt

WHERE TO GET WORKING CAPITAL AND BUSINESS GUIDANCE TO COMMERCIALISE  
			IT & T  PRODUCTS


Do you have a new IT & T product which has the potential to be commercially 
viable? Then why not talk to the Playford Centre about how we can help with 
providing working capital and business guidance to develop the full 
potential of your product. 

Playford Centre is an initiative of the South Australian Government 
and EDS Australia to promote the development of the State's innovative 
and dynamic information technology sector. Its specific role is to assist 
individual IT & T companies plan and fund their national and international 
growth.  

Launched in September 1997, Playford Centre provides assistance to 
organisations ranging from seed entities, with only a vision for 
their future product through to well established growth companies 
expanding into export markets. A balanced range of services are offered 
to assist clients with their specific needs.  The Centre's fundamental 
objective is industry development. This is undertaken in a commercial 
manner that supports the Centre's requirement to become self- sufficient.  

Initial funding and in-kind services have been provided by the SA 
Government and commercial partners; EDS, Microsoft, Oracle and Sun 
Microsystems.  

WHAT BENEFITS CAN THE PLAYFORD CENTRE OFFER YOU?
================================================

The Playford Centre combines two critical components necessary for 
company and product development.

	o Working capital  
	o Business consultation.

All Playford Centre applicants receive business and technical advice 
related to their business, potentially saving them time and money.  

The prime benefits are:

	o Access to working capital with minimal risk via a success 
		sharing model

	o Alliance and partnership opportunities that optimise your 
		company growth

	o Readily available expert services for business development


Examples of how Playford Centre has supported IT & T companies: 

	o The PULSE Warehouse Management System (WMS), produced by 
		Pulse Logistics, is a prime example of how Playford 
		Centre produces results.  Working capital was provided 
		for product development that allowed re-engineering the 
		Pulse system to provide the latest tools and standards 
		whilst also enhancing the product to be double-byte 
		enabled for foreign markets.

		This progress has assisted PULSE to enter into the EDS, 
		Channels to Asia Pacific (CHAP) program that will pave 
		the way for international business opportunities for its 
		product.

	o Maxamine International is set for takeoff with their range of 
		Web visualisation and management software products. The 
		products allows a manager to gain an overview of the 
		structure of a complete website, and also produces an 
		array of automatic reports that catalogue problems and 
		issues with quality. 

		The breadth of Maxamine capabilities is vast. Whilst using 
		Playford Centre incubator facilities they have accessed 
		working capital to finance interstate sales travel, capital 
		raising consultation and international market research. 

	o Practical Programs is now at the forefront of CAD, imaging and 
		document management. Assisted by the Playford Centre with 
		international market research and access to an export 
		program that helped open doors in the US market.

		Utilising Playford Center's in-kind services offered by 
		Microsoft, Practical Programs has produced two 
		internationally competitive products.


Why not enquire how Playford Centre can help you develop your IT & T 
product and join these budding entrepreneurs.
