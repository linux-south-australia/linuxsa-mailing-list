&gt; Andrew,

&gt; That's almost certainly the right answer.
Yes, and to FIX the problem, which is probably what he want's to know,
you need to do this:
boot up your PC, as per usual, and when you get the lilo prompt, enter
linux single

instead of hitting enter for the default, or just typing linux&lt;enter&gt;./
If you call linux something else, obviously type that instead.
(newlinux, linux223, or whatever. linux is the default though from a new
install)

This will now boot up and place you into a root shell.
type
passwd root
and enter a new root passwd in.
type reboot or shutdown to restart the PC, and this time load linux as
normal.
Now, you should be able to log in as root with the new password.
In the future, to adjust a users password, type "passwd username" as
root, instead of su-ing to them. If you do need to su to a user to do
sometihng, I reccommend using the -l option to do a full login. man su
for more information.
Alan kennington seems to have forgotten about this.
When su-ing to root, you retain your local real user ID, unless you su -
or su root -l, which does a full root login.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have installed Red Hat Linux 5.2 on my computer, all was fine. I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; using the login of root and the password. I created a user and gave them a
&gt; &gt; &gt; password. I shut down the computer and restarted Linux. I can no longer
&gt; &gt; &gt; login to Linux with either login. I get the message invalid login.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Did you accidently change the root password instead of the user's?

&gt; Under linux, the "real" user ID, not the "effective" user ID is used
&gt; for the passwd command. So when root does "su" to a user,
&gt; the "real" user ID "root" is used instead of the user ID that
&gt; is more logical.
See above. Linux always gives you options. It's up to you to read the
manual and discover them though. Linux's only flaw is that is doesn't
always let you know about these options.
But how hard is "man su" ?
&gt; 
&gt; This is pretty much so on other unixes also.
&gt; But....
&gt; 
&gt; I think that linux does this crazy sort of thing also
&gt; for shells (i.e. if you type "csh" as root, your "real" ID
&gt; is still "root" etc. etc.).
if you are really root, and you run a shell, i'd expect i'd still really
be root. What were you expecting, to become real user goldilox?
&gt; 
&gt; But then if you try to become "really" root from an ordina5ry
&gt; account using "rsh", you can fall foul of the "PAM" configuration.
Umm.....Are you saying that denying people from trying to login remotely
as root and avoiding entering a password is a bad thing?
It's not that much of a hassle to login as a normal user, possibly by
rsh, and then doing a su -. If you really need to be able to get in as
root immediately, have a look as ssh at least. (secure shell)

&gt; 
&gt; This has the very sad consequence that if you log in
&gt; habitually as an ordinary user and execute "startx" etc.,
&gt; then you can't become "really" root wihtout fiddling with the
&gt; PAM configuration. Adn that means that you can't
&gt; do backups to the "ftape" device, which looks at the
&gt; "real" user ID only.
Ummm..._I_ always log in as a non-priveledged user. I don't think I ever
log in as root at the console here. If needs be, I can su to root to do
stuff, or if I really have to, su - to root.
I don't understand this PAM conflict you are talking about. How can I
replicate it?
Isn't the idea of an 'effective' UID that it is what 'effects' what you
are doing?
I'll go look at ftape later on, I don't know much about it myself.
However, I'd suspect that as a /device it doesn't get a say in the
matter about uid vs eid.
I've been wrong before though ;)

&gt; 
&gt; This is one of the complaints that I ahve about linux.
&gt; Just one of the many reasons why people who think that linux
&gt; will be the dominant desktop OS in 12 months will be
Well, a lot can change in 12 months. Look 12 months ago, and keep in
mind development is accelerating.
&gt; disappointed. The "su" and "csh" behaviour, combined with
&gt; the overuse of the "real user ID" by applications software,
&gt; results in incomprehensible behaviour, which should be
&gt; fixed, in my opinion.
Maybe not 'fixed', but 'explained' better?
Most lose95 (l)users don't understand the concept of multiple users,
permissions, etc. at all, and they're going to get a real shock on
linux. (or NT even, for that matter)

&gt; 
&gt; The original idea of keeping track fo the "real" user ID was
&gt; to increase security. But in my opinion, too much
&gt; functionality has been sacrificed.
&gt; (In all systems, there's a security/functionality trade-off,
&gt; I believe.)
Oh, indeed. But would u rather have a system where anyone could hack
into it remotely, and do whatever they liked? If you've got a non-online
system, maybe it's not a problem, but these days more and more computers
are being hooked up to LANs or the internet.
Security is a good thing to get into a habit about. Maybe not extremes,
but hey, an analogy:
Do you ever forget your PIN number for a
bankcard/keycard/securitysystem/etc ?
Now, wouldn't it be much easier if you could just walk up to an ATM and
put your card in and get your money?
Do you ever get locked out of your house? Ever locked your keys in your
car?
Wouldn't it be soo much easier if you just didn't have any locks?
"All this 'security' stuff has traded off the functionality of my
car/house/bankaccount!"

But, what happens when you get home, and find someone has stolen your
lockless car, and entered your lockless house, and taken your PC, with
full access to all your precious data? THey could even drive away up to
the local nuclear power plant, walk right in, and meltdown the core,
without ever needing any of those bothersome keys or PINs or security
badges, that just get in the way of everyday 'functionality'. 

Now, sure, there's a balance between the two extremes. But even if you
have a good lock n bolt on your front door, it's no good if you've left
a window wide open around the back, and have your four digit PIN numbers
the same on all your bankcards, and left written on a scribbled piece of
paper in your wallet.

but hey, go on, leave your root password as &lt;enter&gt;, because life and
linux is all about options.

&gt; 
&gt; To be just a bit controversial, I think that linux is not
&gt; yet ready to take over from other unixes, let alone the
&gt; MS and Mac OSs.
For a desktop UI, I agree.
For a server, or other unixes, I think linux is ready, provided the
administrator isn't some kid who's just learnt how to use NT4.

&gt; And this bizarre "passwd" behaviour is
&gt; just the ant at the top of the iceberg.
Linux isn't an unsinkable ship. It's still got bugs (no pun intended),
but it's 'getting there' a lot faster than most products, and it's
already overtaken a lot of other competitors in the fields that are
important: Compatibility, stability, speed, diversity, OSS, etc.
Someone once said that a sufficiently advanced technology will seem like
incomprehensible magic. For some people switching operating systems,
linux tasks seem to require magic to complete or comprehend, but it's
merely just a higher level of learning and understanding.
(Go the religious analogies ;)

&gt; Cheerio,
