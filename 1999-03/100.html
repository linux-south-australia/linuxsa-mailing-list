&gt;  Hi Gurus, I have a 3GB Hdd fully utilise for Windows 95. Since I know
&gt; that LINUX is a powerful tools to venture...I would like to slowly
&gt; migrate to LINUX. My question here is :- 1) Can I format my 3GB HDD
&gt; and repartition it again for LINUX ? Any advise from the experts how
&gt; to go about it. I would like to know how much space that I required
&gt; for windows and Linux ? But for LINUX Installation I would like to
&gt; install  RedHat 5.1,XWindows and all the utilities and also all the
&gt; packages that is available in RedHat.

ok - i am not a guru, but i have doen a few installs lately for ppl as
well as our systems, so here goes:)
(READ THE HOWTOS AND ANY OTHER INFO YOU CAN FIND)
1) if you can, get a copy of ACP mags linux pocketbook. contains redhat
5.2, lots of apps, and a wonderful new users guide, which seems to be
targetting windows users...(ie ppl who have never had a real o/s b4)
it is A$14.00, and can be ordered thru their web site - the link to it
is:
<A HREF="http://apcmag.com/shop/">http://apcmag.com/shop/</A>
i imagine that you can order it  to be shipped wherever you are globally
(well, just about anywhere:)  )
2) do you really want ALL the utilities? if yours is a standalone pc, do
you need samba and other networking utilities? are you going to be a web
server in the near future?if not, apache may not be necessary. these
things can be installed as you need them. but, in the meantime, you are
still doing a reasonably large install.
(READ THE HOWTOS AGAIN)
3) half and half could work. the big questions are (besides (2) ), what
do you want on yr windows partition,and how much room that will take.
that pretty well decides linux partition(s) size - but be aware, ppl who
use linux usually end up using it so much more than windows, thus
needing more room than they thought originally. plan for that
possibility.
(READ THE HOWTOS AGAIN)
4) do you want to lose all yr current windows info? you can move yr
windows partitions using fips, but that is not attempted lightly . read
all of the fips docs on the redhat disk. judge for yourself whether you
feel up to it. back up yr data anyway:)))
(READ THE HOWTOS AGAIN)
5) alternatively, back up your windows stuff, and format yr hdd. install
primary dos partition for windows. install windows. start linux install.
install into remaining space. run it. be happy. wonder why you bothered
with windows.
(READ THE HOWTOS AGAIN)



&gt; 2) I'm going to install all this on my home computer. So do i need to
&gt; setup TCP/IP and Domain names? I will be the single user of the
&gt; system. Any other suggestion and solutions are welcome from u all.
&gt; Since I'm an alien in the world of LINUX. Thank You.
