Thanks for those who helped with this, I now have both mouse and modem
port working under W98 and Linux, the problem was that the cables that
came with the motherboard were the wrong ones, luckily I had 2 other
sets of connectors and the last set I tried :-)  which incidently didnt
fit the motherboard as one of the pin holes was covered/blocked up (had
to melt a hole through it) I guess so that it can not be confused as to
the way round it is sposed to go, worked marvelously.  Goes to show,
dont deal with pcrecyclers in Melbourne, first it took a week to receive
a part which they advertised would be overnight delivery same day
dispatch, then it arrived with out the cables and manual like they also
advertised so I had to phone them to ask for these parts, then it seems
they supply the wrong format cables.

Anyway thanks for the help everyone

Matt
