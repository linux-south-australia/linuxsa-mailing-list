Hi,

I recently changed the roles of two of my computers, one of which was my
linux server. Everything worked properly then, and now after installing
linux on the other computer, samba isn't working properly. The only thing I
can think of that is different is that this time I installed the bare
minimum stuff, then manually installed packages I needed, whereas last time
I installed everything, then removed what I didn't want.

Anyway, I'm using a 2.2 kernel, so I also downloaded all the kernel-2.2
updates, including samba. As it is now, sharing under linux and opening the
shared directories on the win98 machine works fine, however, trying to
mount a share does not work. If I use smbclient, I can connect and do
whatever I like. If I try to mount, I get the following:

&gt; smbmount <A HREF="file://pii/c">file://pii/c</A> /mnt/pii
Added interface ip=10.0.1.1 bcast=10.0.1.255 nmask=255.255.255.0
Server time is Fri Mar 26 20:17:24 1999
Timezone is UTC+10.5
security=share
smb: \&gt;


at the smb: \&gt; prompt, no commands work (well, things like ls, dir or cd). I
can only control-c to get out. BTW, I have pii defined in /etc/hosts.

Now, is it my imagination, or when you smbmount, isn't there suppose to be
no output? it just mounts it? Also, it normally asks you for a password,
doesn't it? I did I leave something out when compiling the kernel? I
included the smb network filesystem with the win95 fix, but I didn't include
the DOS filesystems. is that perhaps it?

Thanks,
Andy

PS. I just got a fax for my permanent connection config,my phone line hasn't
been installed yet. Anyway, there are a few things I'm a little unsure
about. Is there anyone that would like to help me? :)  Please reply
privately, as it's not linux specific. thanks again.
