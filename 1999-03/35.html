&gt; Hey All,
&gt;
&gt; I've got the same problem Alan K was having with his modems. IE, it seems to
&gt; be buffering the data for 8 seconds, and then sending, or receiving it all
&gt; at once. The modem is one I bought off Alan that he had only used for one
&gt; day. While it was "stuffing up" I pinged the gateway machine for my ppp link
&gt; at my ISP, and here's the results I got:
&gt;

Also check out your phone lines. You can get good ones and bad ones these days
and noone tells you when they are working on the lines. Its the only
explanation I have sometimes when things like this happen. A bit of noise for a
while which slows down the modems (they're trying to do all sorts of
compression tricks in a hostile environment) an dthen a day or two later the
technicians put the lid back on the pillar and everything's ok.

I have times when I get a good line great  performance for days or weeks and
then for no apparent reason I get the kind of ping pattern you're seeing. I'm
happy to blame the modems or ppp but I don't think that would be right.

Rick
