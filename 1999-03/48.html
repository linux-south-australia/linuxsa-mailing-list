Heyas,
I've got a new twist on this subject.
I was trying to install a modem in a linux box for a friend.
First of all we were trying with a 486dx-33, which just plain would not
recognize the modem.
Well, it would recognize that a UART was present (since it was an
internal modem), and the IRQ could be configured (com3, irq 5), but no
data could be passed to or from the modem.
I gave up and transfer the harddrive with linux into a different
486dx-33 (although very similar), and the modem worked first try. 

However, we then got exactly the same problem as some of you have been
describing - it would sometimes pause and buffer packets for a long
time. Only, where you are finding about 8 seconds, this one would get to
40-50 seconds!
It was an internal 33.6 KTX modem (not my modem!), but apparently it
"used to work fine" in a different windows-installed 486.

I agree that the problem seems to be retraining-related, and I vaguely
recall having some problem with my 28.8 when I bought it years ago. At
the time I think I solved it by adjusting the fallforward/back
parameters. Some modems I connected to wouldn't try and retrain when my
modem demanded it. Thus, I disabled retraining altogether for a while. 
This was in my days of BBSing, when my modem had to talk to all kinds of
wierd & wonderful other modems, and now that I'm internet based and only
really talking to 1 type of modem, I've reset it back since.
However, I reccommend giving that a try (see your manual for details,
they vary). 
Oh, and if anyone's got an internal ktx 33.6 (or 28.8) and they've got a
manual for it, could you pass on the relevant commands to me too?
Thanks,
Toby

&gt; &gt;&gt; Rick,

&gt; &gt;&gt; I agree that noise could be triggering the modem problems,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but it's unlikely to be the reason it stays around.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The nature of the problem is that the line is perfect for
&gt; &gt;&gt; about 2 to 30 days, and then it goes wrong until the modem is
&gt; &gt;&gt; reset. I kept it in the pathological state for
&gt; &gt;&gt; about 8 hours last time, logging every single packet.
&gt; &gt;&gt; And when I re-start pppd, the problem goes away for
&gt; &gt;&gt; many more days.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It's unlikely that the noise would just stop when I
&gt; &gt;&gt; restart pppd.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Correct (trivially) but i fthe modem has tracked down to a slow baud
&gt; &gt;rate to cope with the line then resetting will provide a magic fix.
&gt; 
&gt; So, the modem is slowing down when there is noise on the line, but not
&gt; realising that the noise has gone away, and so not speeding up again?
&gt; Reading through the manual for the modem, there is a swtich to "enable line
&gt; quality monitor and fallback/fall forward". If this is the problem, setting
&gt; this option would solve the problem? The option is %E2, so I need to at that
&gt; to my initialisation string?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Dazz
