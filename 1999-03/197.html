I have this nasty little problem. I have everything basically working
with a few bugs here and there. One of these is I can't get X to work
at all. I have gone through the setup (Xconfigurator) several times
and it just refuses to work. I have an ATI 3D Rage Pro w/4meg video
card. I have used the Xconfigurator and no matter what I get the same
thing... NOTHING... A blank screen! I press alt-F2 and then back to
alt-F1, the screen then returns to normal... What I can remember it
said was there was too little memory for this mode. If there is 4meg
then why? Says Fatal Server Error: No valid modes found. I get an
errno:111... This is what I see _X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't
connect: errno = 111 giving up.

What am I doing wrong or not doing? I can't get this to work to save
my soul! Any ideas out there??? Ask me any questions if you have to
and I will answer! I want X running...

TIA,
Frank

You will not believe this, but the last place I looked,
I found what I was looking for!!! Maybe I should have
looked there first...

I don't think it is as bad as you think!
BUT, it CAN get worse!!!
