Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone out there has had success running Xwindows with a
Diamond Viper550?  Version 3.3.3.1 of XFree86 is supposed to support it but
as yet I have had no luck.

As far as I am aware the Viper550 requires the SVGA Xserver so this is what
I have been using.  I am currently running Redhat 5.2 and therefore am
having to upgrade XFree86 from 3.3.2 to 3.3.3.1 .

After downloading all the required binaries I am able to follow the
installation procedure and get no reported errors. When setting up my
config file however (by using  XF86Setup, xf86config or Xconfigurator) I
get no listing for the Viper 550. 

There is a readme file in XF85Setup that suggests using the "Diamond Edge
3D" card for those using RIVA128 or Nvidia chipset so I have tried this.
When trying to start Xwindows it defaults to a terrible resolution (300x200
or something similar)..  The server reports that it has found an unknown
chipset and sets it to generic.

Has anyone had a similar experience?

Regards,

-Cal S.
