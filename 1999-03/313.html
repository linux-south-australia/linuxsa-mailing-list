Hi,

I recently downloaded the 2.2.3 kernel and compiled it, etc (I did download
and upgrade to all the kernel-2.2 rpms). Anyway, I use the linux machine
primarily as a gateway, so it's important that forwarding and masquerading
works.

Once I set it all up and booted it, I briefly say that there was some error
when it said enabling ip forwarding. I looked to make sure that
/proc/sys/net/ip-forwarding was 1, but the /proc/sys directory didn't even
exist (/proc did). Was there something I stuffed up when making the kernel,
or is the 2.2.3 kernel bugged? I have successfully make 2.0.x kernels
before, and I tried the 2.2.2 kernel (which I'm using now) and it works as I
would expect. i did get all the masquerading modules under
/lib/modules/2.2.3/ipv4, so I would think it's not my fault ;)

Also, I read that it's possible to forward all requests to the linux machine
to another machine, using ipportfw. Can ipchains do this, or will I need to
get ipportfw? If I need to get it, does anyone know if I can get it in rpm
format (easier to upgrade)? :)

thanks,
Andy

PS. I figure there's probably not much difference (or advantage) of 2.2.3
over 2.2.2, but I also wanted to ask about ipportfw. ;)
