Hey There,

I have got it up and running. The first thing I noticed about the CD is that
the directory and file names are all lowercase, while the HTML files on the
CD they have put capital letters in for the first characters. Not a problem
in Win95, but it *is* in Linux. When you click on the link, and the address
bar thingo shows the new address, if there is any capitals in the name,
change them to lowercase letters and it should work fine.

As to getting Word Perfect going. I did:

cd ~
cp /mnt/cdrom/bandbust/wplinux/guilg/guilg00.gz .
tar zxf guilg00.gz
cd guilg00
./Runme

Obvisously, you'll have to double check that I've got the file names and
thing correct, as I only did them from memory. Word Perfect runs perfectly
on my Slackware machine.

Cheers.
Dazz

Subject: Corel WP and APC Mag.


&gt;I tried reading my April APC mag disc with Netscape RH 5.2. on a PC which
&gt;also has Win98/IE4. CD is Hitachi 24X. Windows/IE4 reads the disc
perfectly,
&gt;with Linux selecting many items returned an error message "Netscape is
&gt;unable to find the file or directory named
&gt;"mnt/cdrom/bandbuster/default.htm, - or the same file in "New&Hot,
Workshop,
&gt;ISP kits etc. Just to annoy me , however, if I select file - open and the
&gt;appropriate file name it magically finds them. Can anyone offer any
&gt;suggestions as to what might be wrong.
&gt;Part two.
&gt;I got guilg00.gz on to my hard drive to install WP, then followed the
&gt;instructions . Entering "gunzip gui00.gz; tar -xvf gui00 as per
instructions
&gt;returns message:
&gt;gui00.gz: No such file or directory
&gt;tar: Cannot open gui00:No such file or directory
&gt;tar :Error is not recoverable: Exiting now
&gt;I have tried any other combination of names etc with no result. Has anyone
&gt;succeeded in getting it up and running? And if so how?
&gt;Thanks.
&gt;Neil Kent.
