Hi.

I'm pretty sure that you can set the mount options for the cdrom in the
/etc/fstab to allow browsers to accept mangled case filenames. Take a peek
at the man page for mount, (I will too, race ya!) Its something like
sloppy or slack, and it allows you to use windows generated web pages with
windows generated filenames. (Actually, I think the problem is in the way
windows capitalises the first letter of every filename, and it being out
of sync with the html editor's idea of how the world works)

Hmm. no, it isn't sloppy, it's   check=relaxed  have a look under man
mount and scroll down to the options for iso9660 filesystems...

       check=r[elaxed] / check=s[trict]
              With  check=relaxed,  a filename is first converted
              to lower case before doing  the  lookup.   This  is
              probably  only  meaningful together with norock and
              map=normal.  (Default: check=strict.)

&gt; &gt; Hey There,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have got it up and running. The first thing I noticed about the CD is that
&gt; &gt; the directory and file names are all lowercase, while the HTML files on the
&gt; &gt; CD they have put capital letters in for the first characters. Not a problem
&gt; &gt; in Win95, but it *is* in Linux. When you click on the link, and the address
&gt; &gt; bar thingo shows the new address, if there is any capitals in the name,
&gt; &gt; change them to lowercase letters and it should work fine.
&gt; 
&gt; the APC CD has had this problem for a long time -- I have emailed them
&gt; about it previously, but got no response, and saw no change. Surely it
&gt; can't be hard for them to sort this out... I assume they are using some
&gt; sort of WYSIWYG editor, and not editing source code manually, and their
&gt; tool is probably designed for Windows, so it is probably causing the
&gt; problems, but even so, I'm sure that they could write a script to change
&gt; all links to lowercase, or even do some actual cross-checking with the
&gt; filesystem... Maybe if we all wrote to them, they'd fix it...  Anyway,
&gt; that's my grumble for today... :)

&gt; &gt; As to getting Word Perfect going. I did:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; cd ~
&gt; &gt; cp /mnt/cdrom/bandbust/wplinux/guilg/guilg00.gz .
&gt; &gt; tar zxf guilg00.gz
&gt; &gt; cd guilg00
&gt; &gt; ./Runme
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Obvisously, you'll have to double check that I've got the file names and
&gt; &gt; thing correct, as I only did them from memory. Word Perfect runs perfectly
&gt; &gt; on my Slackware machine.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers.

&gt; &gt; Subject: Corel WP and APC Mag.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;I tried reading my April APC mag disc with Netscape RH 5.2. on a PC which
&gt; &gt; &gt;also has Win98/IE4. CD is Hitachi 24X. Windows/IE4 reads the disc
&gt; &gt; perfectly,
&gt; &gt; &gt;with Linux selecting many items returned an error message "Netscape is
&gt; &gt; &gt;unable to find the file or directory named
&gt; &gt; &gt;"mnt/cdrom/bandbuster/default.htm, - or the same file in "New&Hot,
&gt; &gt; Workshop,
&gt; &gt; &gt;ISP kits etc. Just to annoy me , however, if I select file - open and the
&gt; &gt; &gt;appropriate file name it magically finds them. Can anyone offer any
&gt; &gt; &gt;suggestions as to what might be wrong.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Part two.
&gt; &gt; &gt;I got guilg00.gz on to my hard drive to install WP, then followed the
&gt; &gt; &gt;instructions . Entering "gunzip gui00.gz; tar -xvf gui00 as per
&gt; &gt; instructions
&gt; &gt; &gt;returns message:
&gt; &gt; &gt;gui00.gz: No such file or directory
&gt; &gt; &gt;tar: Cannot open gui00:No such file or directory
&gt; &gt; &gt;tar :Error is not recoverable: Exiting now
&gt; &gt; &gt;I have tried any other combination of names etc with no result. Has anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt;succeeded in getting it up and running? And if so how?
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thanks.
&gt; &gt; &gt;Neil Kent.
