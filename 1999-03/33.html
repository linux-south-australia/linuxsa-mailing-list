Hey All,

I've got the same problem Alan K was having with his modems. IE, it seems to
be buffering the data for 8 seconds, and then sending, or receiving it all
at once. The modem is one I bought off Alan that he had only used for one
day. While it was "stuffing up" I pinged the gateway machine for my ppp link
at my ISP, and here's the results I got:


PING 210.8.138.7 (210.8.138.7): 56 data bytes

As you can see, it seems to be 'holding' the data for 8 seconds before
sending it back. As I was pinging the actual machine on the other end of my
phone call, I think that I can rule out any routing problems, etc, etc, as
there is only the two machines, and modems between, to cause the problem,
and I haven't had this problem before. The only thing I have done is put the
new modem in. It was only connected for 2½ days before the problem showed
up.

Incidently, 64 bytes per second for 8 seconds makes 512 bytes of data.
What's the buffer on the modems? I'm wondering if it can be a problem with
this model? Alan said to me when I bought it off him that they were all
pretty much identical modems. The particular modem I bought off Alan is a
non-PnP Internal Discovery 33.6K modem, with voice support and SAVD. Anyone
else had a problem with this model, or very similar models?

Now that I think I have tracked the problem down some more, does anyone know
what we can do about it?

Cheers,
Dazz
