&gt;Question: Is this a word virus or an exe? As if it is a word virus it should
&gt;be reasonably easy to trace.

[Snip]
Melissa is a word Macro virus, you'e probably getting confused with the
Happy99 that spread by similar method but was an exe.

It could be easy enough to trace if the orginal word document was written
on a leg'it installation as it would contain the author's name and
organisation.

However if the hacker has done it right, he would've remove all instances
of infomation about himself. However he didn't remove the mac address of
the computer. Windows can't get anything right!!

Note: Regarding the last statements, I make not aplogises for not being ps
but have you heard for a young woman being busted for hacking. There is a
difference in personality between males and females.
