&gt; I probably know much less about real-time OSs than most people, but...
&gt;
&gt; When I talked about real-time software, I meant in the sense of
&gt; kernel modules being able to completely take control of the CPU.
&gt;

Realtime is generally taken as meaning the system will guarantee that a
signal (e.g. interrupt, state change, etc) can be responded to within a
nominated amount of time. e.g. on  a plane a sensor indicating a change in
air direction must be responded to in "n" milliseconds. This doesn't
preclude multitasking or require exclusive CPU usage. But it does normally
require pre-emptive process scheduling.

FWIW

Rick

&gt; I.e. linux does not provide real-time functionality at the process
&gt; level, but like most OSs, real-time can be achieved in device drivers
&gt; (i.e. kernel modules).
&gt; Of course, if you want _two_ kernel modules to achieve real-time
&gt; functionality, then one is in trouble.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore I was only referring to the fact that linux is ideal for
&gt; kernel module writing, and that the kernel can do what it likes
&gt; with the CPU. This is a much more limited meaning of "real-time"
&gt; than in the context of real-time OSs.
&gt;
&gt; Also I should mention that I was not talking about microsecond-level
&gt; real-time. I only meant down to a few milliseconds.
&gt; I assume that the _real_ real-time will be done on
&gt; dedicated microcontrollers which are connected by various buses to
&gt; the main CPU, being a sort of x86 or something.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore in the sorts of projects that I was talking about,
&gt; I envisage there being a box containing a board or two, which have
&gt; a CPU + RAM + 1 or more microcontrollers.
&gt; Then I was asserting that linux would be good for the CPU -- but
&gt; probably not for the _real_ real-time processors, which are the
&gt; uC chips (e.g. microchip PIC, philips XA, coldfire etc. etc.).
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
