Be very careful that you do not set your machine up to accept mail
from anyone and delivery it to anyone else.  This is what is known
as an "open relay".  There is almost no reason for an open relay
other than to take the blame for someone else's spam.  Spammers
look for open relays, and then send their nasty and obnoxious spam
through that site.  Anyone following the spam backwards would quite
rightly blame the administrator of the open relay for sending the
spam ... after all, the spam provably came from that machine.

In almost every case, sendmail should be set up to accept mail from
anywhere, for delivery to the local machine or machines; and to
accept mail from the local machine or machines, for delivery anywhere.

Regards,

David
