Lynx also hangs in the same way as Netscape.

I can ping remote sites once my ppp connection is up.

What this says to me is:
 - It's not a browsing software problem (since 2 independent packages 
exhibit the same behaviour)
 - It's not a ppp connection problem (since DNS works, I can FTP from the 
command line and ping remote sites and the /var/log/messages shows a 
successful log-on and ppp connection established)
 - It's not a problem with my ISP (ditto)
 - It's not a problem with the remote site (I can ping it and also browse 
in Windoze)

It does seem to be some kind of problem with HTTP requests in my system.

Does this seem right? Any ideas on what the problem might be would be most 
appreciated.

Thanks,
Michael.

Hi

I'm having problems with Netscape Navigator 4.05 installed in RedHat 5.1

I had it installed and working. I then played around with some of my setup 
-
most notably installing a printer, some other software and changing window
managers.

Now when I start Netscape, it just hangs in a "Site Contacted, Waiting for
Reply" state. No data comes through (except when the DNS is happening) - 
the
modem lights are not flashing. DNS is working and I can FTP no problem.
Also, it's not my ISP, since I can browse in Windows.

The only thing I can think of is that a port setting or something has been
changed. (I'm dialing directly to my ISP (no proxy / firewall). However, I
don't have any idea where that setting might take place.

I have also tried unistalling and reinstalling Netscape (twice). And been
through the ISP_Hookup-HOWTO in exactly the same way as I got it running
before.

Any help or ideas would be most appreciated.

Thanks,
Michael.
