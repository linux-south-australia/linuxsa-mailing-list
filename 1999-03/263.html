&gt; &gt; Heh, I live in the hills, but have Line of sight of most of Adelaide. I
&gt; &gt; just miss out on seeing the santos building, is it really LOS or does it
&gt; &gt; just not work when your 10 - 15km away.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This would be very nice with a laptop!

Oops just read my post  - sorry for the million and 1 typos in it :(  I didnt answer your question completely either.  The best
thing you can do for radio range is get more height.  This makes the biggest difference to distance coverable.  However those line
of sight things are so low powered you wouldn't get most of adealide.  You would get more range than anyone else would however.  The
next best thing is a good aerial, and good co-ax cable, and amount of power only makes minimal difference.   Eg I know of someone
else on this list who can toggle their radio between 5 watts and 25 watts and doing so only adds about 15-20% extra range.
