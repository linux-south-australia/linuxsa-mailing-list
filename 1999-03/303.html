&gt; Yeah i was on ozemail, im finding someone else to join. The *unlimited* plan
&gt; they now have is a joke..
&gt; 150 hours is not nearly enuff for what im using it for.. I was a VERY high
&gt; end user.. about 18 hours a day so its out for me.
Well, the thing is though, people who want to use the 'unlimited' plans
to in effect have a permanent leech account, who download continously,
cost the ISP more money than you are worth, so do you really blame them
for trying to throttle back those users?
For the common user who wants a lot of time online, but certainly won't
be on all day every day, it's an even better deal now it's cheaper. 

It's true that internet rates are cheaper in those countries, but they
also have a much higher population as well, as well as different tax and
general utility pricing. People living in Sydney could look at Adelaide
and say "It's not fair, all our accomodation costs way more than theirs!
Why do we have to pay more?" But it doesn't change the way laisez faire
capitalist businesses work.

There's currently free internet access in Britain. However, it's worth
noting they have timed local calls. You can't just look at one single
facet of an economy, and judge them on that.

&gt; 
&gt; Ok, true you get what you pay for.. but why do we have to pay in AU?
&gt; US, Canada, Asia, etc all have VERY cheap internet.. they also have cheap
&gt; celluar rates..
&gt; What gives? Its telstra's nazism... what would these guys be like sold?
Wasn't there some deal they had while govt-owned that said they had to
more expensive, so as to give competitors a chance?

&gt; Hmmmmmm...
&gt; 
&gt; I say email ziggy and tell him that he is running a bunch of criminals. Post
&gt; a reply if you agree :)
Just because I'm replying doesn't neccessarily mean I'm agreeing. ;P
However, I agree that telstra makes rediculous amounts of profit, and
could easily lower rates, thus lowering the costs of all ISPs and phone
users. But it's not criminal to make hoards of money - we'd all do it if
we could ;)
