Hi people... I have a problem and I don't know how to fix this one.
Everytime I try and start X up my monitor goes totally crazy! I have
used the Xconfigutor and answered all the questions. I have even
edited the /etc/X11/XF86config file to no avail... So far the best I
can get is to see 2 pointers on the screen. I have tried to change
modes and I have even gotten a clean 2 screens. Now this to me seems
to be a timing thing going on here. I haven't been able to get the
right frequencies for the horz or vert... Here is what I have:

Monitor - Generic (Digital SVGA)
Video card - ATI Rage IIc Pro with 8meg

I don't know if it is the monitor or the video card, but I can not get
it to work. I used the XF86Setup program and it works, but when the
server comes up it doesn't. I have tried 5 different Mach64 chip
settings and none of them have worked.

Does anyone have any ideas that I may not have covered? The only thing
I have left is to change the monitor, but the monitor I am using works
in Windows9x fine from 640x480 to 1024x768...

TIA
Frank

You will not believe this, but the last place I looked,
I found what I was looking for!!! Maybe I should have
looked there first...

I don't think it is as bad as you think!
BUT, it CAN get worse!!!
