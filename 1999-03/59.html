Hey,

If the problem you are talking about only occurs with kernel 2.2.x, then it
can't be the same as the problem I am having as I am only running kernel
2.0.36 on my server. I was told to leave off upgrading the kernel to 2.2.x
for a while. I think it more likely that the problem is that when there is a
bit of noise on the line, then the modem is slowing down to compensate, then
not speeding up again when the line clears, and then later, maybe that day,
or a week down the track, there is another burst if noise on the line, so
the modem slows down to compensate, but doesn't speed up again when the
noise clears, and so on, until it gets to the point where it has to buffer
it for a long period like its been doing to mine.

Also, that might kind of explain what someone was saying about it seems to
occur more when there is more traffic on the link. If there is no traffic it
doesn't have to worry too much about falling back. Its when it has traffic
it has to pass and it can't that it starts to fallback. Yes? No?

I have not had this problem until I put in the modem I got off of Alan, and
all I changed was the modem. Nothing else. (BTW, I don't want a refund on it
Alan, I would prefer to work out what the problem is and fix it). I have
tried what I posted to the list earlier, about the AT command to set it to
fallback *and* fall forward. In a few days I'll be able to tell everyone if
the problem has recurred or not.

Cheers,
Dazz

&gt;Hi All,
&gt; This may help solve the problems you guys are having with your
&gt;modems. Add the following to /etc/conf.modules
&gt;
&gt;alias ppp-compress-21 off
&gt;
&gt;and see if it helps,
&gt;Read below for more details as to why this should work.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
