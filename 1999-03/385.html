&gt; Please note this is not stated in a mean or nasty way, so no flame wars,
&gt; pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaase!
&gt; 

I would be happy to do it if:

a) I had the time
b) I was any good at writing scripts

Unfortunately, neither of those is true, so I won't be writing one. :)

On a related note, I'd be interested to know which (if any) of the HTML
editors (the WYSIWYG ones) create case-sensitive web pages... Anyone
know? Is this something that should be brought to the attention of the
tool-makers?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Hey There,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I have got it up and running. The first thing I noticed about the CD is
&gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; the directory and file names are all lowercase, while the HTML files on
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; CD they have put capital letters in for the first characters. Not a
&gt; problem
&gt; &gt;&gt; in Win95, but it *is* in Linux. When you click on the link, and the
&gt; address
&gt; &gt;&gt; bar thingo shows the new address, if there is any capitals in the name,
&gt; &gt;&gt; change them to lowercase letters and it should work fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;the APC CD has had this problem for a long time -- I have emailed them
&gt; &gt;about it previously, but got no response, and saw no change. Surely it
&gt; &gt;can't be hard for them to sort this out... I assume they are using some
&gt; &gt;sort of WYSIWYG editor, and not editing source code manually, and their
&gt; &gt;tool is probably designed for Windows, so it is probably causing the
&gt; &gt;problems, but even so, I'm sure that they could write a script to change
&gt; &gt;all links to lowercase, or even do some actual cross-checking with the
&gt; &gt;filesystem... Maybe if we all wrote to them, they'd fix it...  Anyway,
&gt; &gt;that's my grumble for today... :)

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question and the answer is
no.
