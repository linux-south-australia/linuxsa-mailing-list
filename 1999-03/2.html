Have you installed a local proxy cache, like squid?
Have you enabled any transparent proxying in the kernel?
Is your default route correct? (ie. pointing to your ppp interface, with
a gateway?)

&gt; I can ping remote sites once my ppp connection is up.
&gt; 
&gt; What this says to me is:
&gt;  - It's not a browsing software problem (since 2 independent packages
&gt; exhibit the same behaviour)
&gt;  - It's not a ppp connection problem (since DNS works, I can FTP from the
&gt; command line and ping remote sites and the /var/log/messages shows a
&gt; successful log-on and ppp connection established)
&gt;  - It's not a problem with my ISP (ditto)
&gt;  - It's not a problem with the remote site (I can ping it and also browse
&gt; in Windoze)
&gt; 
&gt; It does seem to be some kind of problem with HTTP requests in my system.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this seem right? Any ideas on what the problem might be would be most
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Michael.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having problems with Netscape Navigator 4.05 installed in RedHat 5.1
&gt; 
&gt; I had it installed and working. I then played around with some of my setup
&gt; -
&gt; most notably installing a printer, some other software and changing window
&gt; managers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now when I start Netscape, it just hangs in a "Site Contacted, Waiting for
&gt; Reply" state. No data comes through (except when the DNS is happening) -
&gt; the
&gt; modem lights are not flashing. DNS is working and I can FTP no problem.
&gt; Also, it's not my ISP, since I can browse in Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; The only thing I can think of is that a port setting or something has been
&gt; changed. (I'm dialing directly to my ISP (no proxy / firewall). However, I
&gt; don't have any idea where that setting might take place.
&gt; 
&gt; I have also tried unistalling and reinstalling Netscape (twice). And been
&gt; through the ISP_Hookup-HOWTO in exactly the same way as I got it running
&gt; before.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help or ideas would be most appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Michael.
