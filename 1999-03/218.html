i have an old 486 computer with an old BIOS. well i had one. dunno whrere
it is now.... Anyhow...


I put a 2gig drive in it, and the BIOS didn't work. I played around with
LILO and got it working eventually. In the meantime however, I used a
floppy to boot from.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm
&gt; &gt; Maybe someone should tell all this to one of my PCs at home.
&gt; &gt; I've got a 10.4 Gb drive in it, which is in LBA mode because I've got a
&gt; &gt; windows partition on it as well.
&gt; &gt; Contrary to what someone said earlier, the IDE drive does NOT do the LBA
&gt; &gt; mapping/unmapping - this is purely a BIOS thing.
&gt; &gt; Now, this 10gb drive definately has way more than 64 heads reported in
&gt; &gt; BIOS, under LBA. (Yes, I know they're not 'real' heads, but the point is
&gt; &gt; that there's more than 64 (2^6), which Mark is saying is the limit.) It
&gt; &gt; also has more than 1023 cylinders as well.
&gt; &gt; I've seen old BIOS's loop back large harddrives such that they report
&gt; &gt; them as incorrect sizes, but mine works fine. I don't believe that the
&gt; &gt; BIOS itself imposes a limit on the cylinder/head amounts. This drive has
&gt; &gt; more than 1023 cylinders, and more than 64 heads, and works fine in LBA
&gt; &gt; mode.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I think that you will find that if the BIOS is old (as it might be on a 486)
&gt; it is possible that it will not support LBA or be unable to address the large
&gt; HDD. On newer 486s the BIOS is often able to handle large drives, if not, the
&gt; drive will sometimes come with a DOS or Windows TSR that will intercept calls
&gt; to the BIOS and therefore enable access to large drives.Sam Silvester.
