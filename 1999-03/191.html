Mark,

Thanks for the details on Linux boot. As you probably gathered I did a lot of
support work with Unixware, SCO, and Solaris (System V Unix) in the old days. I
guess I had naively expected Linux to be at least as smart about ignoring the
BIOS as the older products. I know... never assume.

The 1023 limit is because the BIOS uses only 10 bits for cylinder address. The
other 6 are used for something else. Its sort of the BIOS equivalent of the Y2K
problem. Who could possibly need a disk with more than 1024 cylinders? or a
computer with more than 640K RAM? What was I saying about assuming things....
I think Intel made some sort of similar assumptions when designing the segmented
architecure.

Don't forget too that real Unix can sub partition a disk partition which is why
/stand can work. This would make a good holiday project. ;-)

&gt;  &gt; Can't speak for Linux because I haven't tried it, but in the old days SCO,
&gt;  &gt; Interactive, and Solaris could boot any size disk irrespective of the
&gt;  &gt; BIOS. This is because Unix and (I presume) Linux store the disk config in
&gt;  &gt; the boot sector. All you should need is any BIOS def to get going. We used
&gt;  &gt; to use type 1 and let Unix take over from there.
&gt;
&gt; Linux is rather different from most other UNIXes in the way it boots.
&gt;
&gt;

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Linux could benefit from that third approach: Rather than using LILO
&gt; to boot /vmLinuz or whatever, it should be possible to write a tertiary
&gt; bootstrap and have LILO boot that instead.  This would have the benefit
&gt; of introducing significant extra functionality, usability and
&gt; configurability without having any impact whatsoever on the existing
&gt; boot-time infrastructure employed by Linux.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone want to take on a holiday project? :-)
&gt;
&gt; In the short term, you need to make sure that the disk you're booting
&gt; from features a boot partition which falls entirely within the first
&gt; 1024 cylinders.
