&gt; Heh, I live in the hills, but have Line of sight of most of Adelaide. I
&gt; just miss out on seeing the santos building, is it really LOS or does it
&gt; just not work when your 10 - 15km away.
&gt;
&gt; This would be very nice with a laptop!

Yeah thats what i've been thinking. Linux box at home and me up in the hills with a nice view and a laptop :) I was trying to
set it up with Toby C on this list (he has allready mentioned it) and i'd
be interested in doing it.  Its not too hard to build a bigger/better aerial and/or put it in a better location, but the biggest
problem is all the legalitys. You can't use CB as I belive data is illegal on there, and you can't use any where else without a
licence.  Legally you can't use more than 5 watts on CB anyway.  I like Toby's idea of going in an official licence as I think
this is what we'd have to do with the number of people interested.  I also like the sound modem drivers as I allready have a 25
watt commercial radio modified to take a line in and line out and also a tx line (from out previous attempts). This only goes up
to 9600baud half duplex however, and the more people who use it there more collisions there would be slowing it down further
again.  There is hardware available however.  The ones I'm thinking of are just little modules that do line of site type stuff
but I can't see why it wouldnt be so to rip the signal out of them and then into a real radio.  Range is still a bit unknow
however.

This place sells these modules.  But even if we get that far we'd have to work out what frequency to use as we'd all need radios
that can do it.  I can transmit between about 450mhz - 510mhz with my radio (oops I didnt say that) so i'd be interested in
getting a frequency there somewhere... Any other interest?
