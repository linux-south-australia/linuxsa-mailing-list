hey all, im having some problems connecting to my new isp ...
im connected with primus ..
and after ringing up support they tell me they are using
just plain PAP not PAP-secrets   

anyway what i try to do i always end up getting disconected
because i dont get authorised

ive tried using comms programs to see if theres a login and password
prompts
after connection but there arent ...

if anyone has any ideas or has had a similar experiance, i be keen to
hear about it

ps ive attached a wordy reply from <A HREF="mailto:support@primus.com.au">support@primus.com.au</A>
draw your own conclusions

Regarding the question sent to us on 8 Mar, 1999:

&gt; firstly whats the ftp site address so i can directly log in and upload 
&gt; files for a homepage.... secondly .... im running linux redhat 5.2 and 
&gt; under the advice of one of your tech support was told you are using PAP not 
&gt; PAP-secrets ... i was using ppp-2_3 but it looks like this didnt support 
&gt; just plain ol' PAP so ive downgraded this to ppp-2_2 and still no luck .... 
&gt; could someone at support give me a step by step account of configuring my 
&gt; redhat dist so im able to connect on it. I cant be the only one..... surely 
&gt; .. perhaps a section on your home page about connecting with linux would be 
&gt; to your advantage with the newfound interest in the o/s thanks steve 

Our response is:

The ftp adderss is home.primus.com.au Sorry, we do not support Linux,
and 
therefore have no step by step information. 

Thankyou.
