&gt; &gt; I find ozemail are pretty good.  Price recently went down to
&gt; &gt; $35 per month for semi-unlimited access.  Its 56k, damn fast
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, this is the OzMegaSaver thing.  It recently went from fully unlimited
&gt; to 150 hours with $3 per hour for anything more.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why I am looking for somewhere else, but the connection and speed
&gt; was good.
&gt; 
&gt; I think they only did this temproarily to boost the user numbers to make
&gt; their share price go up while they were being bought out.
&gt;
I heard somewhere that they did it because they were worried that AOL were
going to do their unlimited thing over here, and didn't want to lose too
many potential customers to them. AFAIK, AOL doesn't offer unlimited over
here (thank god - the less AOLamers are on the better), so they cut the
plan.

This was all at some anti-ozemail activist site, can't remember the URL
offhand.

Personally, I think I can live with 150 hours a month. It just means I
might actually get some work done.  :)

 &gt; Jamz.
