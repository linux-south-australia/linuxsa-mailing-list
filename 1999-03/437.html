Thanks Paul.

You were spot on. hdc5 did the trick.

I looked for a description of these assignments in the online =
documentation
but couldn't find any. Do you know where the description of all these =
hdc
types is hidden.

Also ...I sent the following to <A HREF="mailto:geoffrey@netcraft.com.au">geoffrey@netcraft.com.au</A> before I =
figured out how to send mail to the group. (The NET is new in PNG)

" I run the computer systems at Airlink in PNG where we have both SCO =
Unix and NT servers (Compaq) and the end users use Telnet to run our =
Unix accounting system from PC's running Win 95. Nothing new here. I =
have just installed RedHat Linux on one box on a trial basis and so far =
so good. In fact it's so easy to install I think I would rather have =
Linux than SCO, and may change over in the near future.
=20
Now my problem is this. I want to be able to launch apps on the Linux or =
SCO boxes from the windows environment. To achieve this I would like to =
have my Win app create a Telnet session on the server and then issue the =
required commands to initiate reports etc. I have tried to use the =
Winsock control that comes with Visual Basic but when I connect to port =
23 on the server, it responds with hieroglyphics. Of course if I knew =
what to expect and what Linux expected in return, I could solve the =
problem.=20
=20
So, if you know a systems programmer who has an in-depth knowledge of =
the Telnet protocol, I would be grateful if you could put me in touch. I =
should add that I am not trying to write a complete terminal =
emulator..just a simple logon ...issue command and logoff. =20

The main reason for all this is that I use ODBC links via AcuODBC and =
AcuServer to access very large data files on the server and the whole =
thing is far too slow. If I could run a native AcuCobol application =
under Unix to filter the data and create a temporary table with the =
result set, and then use the ODBC connection on the smaller table, the =
system would be far more responsive. I develop quite a lot of =
specialised Windows software for the firm but have no experience in =
developing under Unix.=20
=20
Any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated."=20

=20
PS : Our AcuCobol system was developed by TABS Computer Systems in =
Adelaide. They are very good at Cobol but unable to help with the =
underlying systems.
=20
AND For those of you who love to slate Windows. I have a dual boot =
system at home with Win 98 and Linux installed. There is no doubt that =
Linux is fast, but when you run X on Linux, the performance is =
miserable. Ok .You say "Linux is a server operating system and you can't =
compare oranges with bananas", Well... That's just the point I am =
making. Linux is a server system and should not be compared with end =
user systems. Attempts to do so display a lack of understanding or =
appreciation of the reasons why we have different operating systems. I =
expect that the global end-users community will all switch to Linux when =
X is faster than Win 9x and when they can get WinfaxPro, Word, Kai's =
Power Goo, and all the other creature comforts they now enjoy under =
Windows. It must be said, in it's favour, that Linux has gone much =
further than any other Unix in giving people what they want, and will =
probably ultimately succeed. Having cut my teeth on macro and Fortran, =
25 years ago, I am only too happy to use Visual Basic or any other =
integrated visual development environment and will take the plunge when =
such tools are available on Linux.

Standing by for the onslaught.
