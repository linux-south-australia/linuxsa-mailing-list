&gt; Hi Gurus,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 3GB Hdd fully utilise for Windows 95. Since I know that LINUX
&gt; is a powerful tools to venture...I would like to slowly migrate to
&gt; LINUX. My question here is :-
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Can I format my 3GB HDD and repartition it again for LINUX ? Any
&gt; advise from the experts how to go about it. I would like to know how
&gt; much space that I required for windows and Linux ? But for LINUX
&gt; Installation I would like to install  RedHat 5.1,XWindows and all the
&gt; utilities and also all the packages that is available in RedHat.
Yes, you can repartition your drive for linux.
In fact, you can even have both dos/lose95 and linux installed on their
at the same time, in their own seperate space, and choose which one you
want to load at startup. This is probably a better idea until you've
become used to Linux.
Why do you want to install RH 5.1 linux though? 5.2++ has been out for a
while now.
(www.redhat.com)

&gt; 
&gt; 2) I'm going to install all this on my home computer. So do i need to
&gt; setup TCP/IP and Domain names? I will be the single user of the
&gt; system.
No, not really.
&gt; 
&gt; Any other suggestion and solutions are welcome from u all. Since I'm
&gt; an alien in the world of LINUX.
&gt; 
Have a look at some of the Linux installation and general Linux FAQ's
before you start.
There's little point in giving individual instructions to every person
who installs linux, when it's all been said and done before, and
recorded for posterity.

Toby

&gt; Thank You.
&gt;
