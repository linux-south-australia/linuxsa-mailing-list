&gt;Hi all.
&gt;    I have been trying to set up X windows on a friend's computer and at
&gt;the moment when I do startx, I get the usual x windows screen but it
&gt;only takes up a third of the screen. It is like it is squashed from the
&gt;top and bottom. I can see the whole thing if I use the mouse to scroll
&gt;around. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can get it to sort
&gt;itself out?

Hi Sam,

I had a similar problem when I first plugged in the monitor that I'm
using now.  I tried adjusting the horizontal and vertical timing
settings in the XFConfig file for a couple of hours.  Unlike my older
pot adjusted monitor, my Optiquest is digital and all its screen
settings were set at arbitary points.  Just to confuse me, this
monitor has several factory modes plus additional user defined modes,
the factory ones worked just fine with MS Windoze but it didn't catch
on to the X11 ones.  My symptoms were "squashed" image just like you
described, the solution (don't laugh) ... adjust the picture from the
front panel.
