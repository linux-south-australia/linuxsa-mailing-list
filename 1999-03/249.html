&gt; Paul,

&gt; Where do you live?  I've just left a message with a guy from
&gt; Integrity Data (which is a South Austrlain firm)
&gt; and will find out more information about the cards..
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else within cooo-ee distance of Technology park/Marsom lakes
&gt; and interested?  Th only problem that I can see is that it is
&gt; line of sight..
&gt; 

A friend and I have been experimenting with AX.25 over UHF CB
occaisionally.
We've been hindered by the fact that we've mainly been building our own
hardware out of standard CBs, and modifying the kernel soundmodem
drivers. We'd got as far as getting unfiltered waveforms in and out of
the radio finals, and had a working soundmodem driver that pulled the
right pins high and low on the parrallel port to manipulate the hardware
in half-duplex. Routing and ax25/ip was about right, but
transmit/receive levels weren't quite right due to not having  fully
functional mixer in the soundmodem driver. While experimenting further
we managed to blow up some expensive bits of the radio hardware, and so
this set us back and we forgot about it for a while.

If this project worked, the anticipated range would have been much
better than line of sight. Basically any distance over which a clear
signal could be received. Theoretical speed would be decent, but we
never got as far as speed testing to find out.
One problem which would need to be solved was that transmission of
continous data over CB is illegal. However, if a group of people wanted
to be in the project, then we could buy our own single frequency for a
fairly low price-per-person.

While I know that there are various hardware solutions that would have
made our job a lot easier, the point was that we were trying to do it
using only what we had lying around, since we had no spare money. ;)
A 486dx2-66, a $20 ESS soundcard, $20 netcard, and a 200 Mb harddrive,
should have been enough, coupled with a spare uhf cb with some spare
parts and some info.

Anyway, I'm sure we'd be interested in any potential radio/data
projects, so keep me posted!
While we're not near your area, we might be able to work with people in
the Adelaide City area.
