&gt; hey all, im having some problems connecting to my new isp ...
&gt; im connected with primus ..
&gt; and after ringing up support they tell me they are using
&gt; just plain PAP not PAP-secrets
&gt; 
&gt; anyway what i try to do i always end up getting disconected
&gt; because i dont get authorised
&gt; 
&gt; ive tried using comms programs to see if theres a login and password
&gt; prompts
&gt; after connection but there arent ...
&gt; 
&gt; if anyone has any ideas or has had a similar experiance, i be keen to
&gt; hear about it
Well, firstly, harrass them a bit about their lack of knowledge etc, and
then explain to them that PAP and PAP-secrets is the same thing.
PAP-secrets is just the file you need to store the passwords in, under
linux, for use with PAP. If you've only got the 1 ISP you dial, you'll
just need an entry like * * * yOUrPaSSword inside the file.
then make sure theres a 
user yourusername
in the options or appropriate peers file.
Once you've done that, just dial up as per normal and it should work for
you.
With PAP you don't need to get a manual login/password, so your chat
script just needs to initialise the modem and dial in.
If you read either the PPP HOWTO (see /usr/doc/HOWTO) or the pppd manual
page (`man pppd`), it can explain in more detail and give you accurate
examples.

&gt; ps ive attached a wordy reply from <A HREF="mailto:support@primus.com.au">support@primus.com.au</A>
&gt; draw your own conclusions
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding the question sent to us on 8 Mar, 1999:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; firstly whats the ftp site address so i can directly log in and upload
&gt; &gt; files for a homepage.... secondly .... im running linux redhat 5.2 and
&gt; &gt; under the advice of one of your tech support was told you are using PAP not
&gt; &gt; PAP-secrets ... i was using ppp-2_3 but it looks like this didnt support
&gt; &gt; just plain ol' PAP so ive downgraded this to ppp-2_2 and still no luck ....
&gt; &gt; could someone at support give me a step by step account of configuring my
&gt; &gt; redhat dist so im able to connect on it. I cant be the only one..... surely
&gt; &gt; .. perhaps a section on your home page about connecting with linux would be
&gt; &gt; to your advantage with the newfound interest in the o/s thanks steve
&gt; 
&gt; Our response is:
&gt; 
&gt; The ftp adderss is home.primus.com.au Sorry, we do not support Linux,
&gt; and
&gt; therefore have no step by step information.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou.
