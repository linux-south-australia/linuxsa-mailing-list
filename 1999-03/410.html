Andrew,

That's almost certainly the right answer.

Under linux, the "real" user ID, not the "effective" user ID is used
for the passwd command. So when root does "su" to a user,
the "real" user ID "root" is used instead of the user ID that
is more logical.

This is pretty much so on other unixes also.
But....

I think that linux does this crazy sort of thing also 
for shells (i.e. if you type "csh" as root, your "real" ID
is still "root" etc. etc.).

But then if you try to become "really" root from an ordina5ry
account using "rsh", you can fall foul of the "PAM" configuration.

This has the very sad consequence that if you log in
habitually as an ordinary user and execute "startx" etc.,
then you can't become "really" root wihtout fiddling with the
PAM configuration. Adn that means that you can't
do backups to the "ftape" device, which looks at the
"real" user ID only.

This is one of the complaints that I ahve about linux.
Just one of the many reasons why people who think that linux
will be the dominant desktop OS in 12 months will be
disappointed. The "su" and "csh" behaviour, combined with
the overuse of the "real user ID" by applications software,
results in incomprehensible behaviour, which should be
fixed, in my opinion.

The original idea of keeping track fo the "real" user ID was
to increase security. But in my opinion, too much
functionality has been sacrificed.
(In all systems, there's a security/functionality trade-off,
I believe.)

To be just a bit controversial, I think that linux is not
yet ready to take over from other unixes, let alone the
MS and Mac OSs.
And this bizarre "passwd" behaviour is
just the ant at the top of the iceberg.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
