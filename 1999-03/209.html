&gt;OK strike one on any info for sound programming. How
&gt;about graphics? Any good links for this? All I need to
&gt;know is how I can designate a pixels colour in (x,y)
&gt;format or a line in (x,y)(x',y') if possible, and then
&gt;wipe the screen.

There are two main ways to do graphics in linux, the svgalib, svgagl way, and
X. The svgagl way is quite a lot simpler, and resembles the classic dos way
of doing graphics ( loop -&gt; copy everything to buffer, then blit between vsync's),
but the trouble is it only runs on limited hardware, and you must run as root
to use it. Svgalib is quite fast (quake for example)

X windows is quite a bit more complicated, because you have to accomodate factors
like other windows, windows managers and other problems. X also uses event based
programming, which takes a bit of getting used to. X is also somewhat slow for
games and demo's. The benifits of X are portablity, and available libraries
(mesa for instance)

My own path was Allegro (in dos), Svgalib, and now X. You could probably skip
the allegro part (though I think it's available now for linux) and go straight
into svgalib. Alternatively you could download the gtk libraries and use them
instead, but I'm not sure if they are good for what you are doing (sound + pixel
plotting makes me think games :)

If you still want to go straight to X, I've been toying with some games programming,
so if you're interested in having a look give me a mail. It's a top down scrolling
game called xtux, starring a familiar penguin : ) I've also written a preliminary
sound daemon you may want to look at.
