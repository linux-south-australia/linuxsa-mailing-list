Linux persons who came to my talk this evening,

You may be interested to know, as a postscript to that talk,
that I just received a reply to my attack notification
regarding the activity at 5:15 a.m. this morning.
I'll remove the identifying info to protect
their anonymity. But here is their reply.

================================================================
Alan,

Thanks for the heads up.  You and about 20 other people complained of the
same thing.  Im not sure if you are familiar with our company.  We
basically lease dedicated servers.  We arent the administrators or anything
like that...We provide the hardware and the bandwidth.  As soon as this
matter was brought to our attention the problem was dealt with.  THe client has
been terminated.

Cheers,
Brad
===============================================================

This gives you some idea of the kind of result that
you can get by notifying the admin contacts of an attack.
Therefore there is no need to think that nothing is ever done.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  If you are good guys, you may read

or just go straight to the slashdot-recommended

PPS. Who has the pointer to the O'Reilly porn parody front cover?
