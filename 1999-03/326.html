&gt; Hi people... I have a problem and I don't know how to fix this one.
&gt; Everytime I try and start X up my monitor goes totally crazy! I have
&gt; used the Xconfigutor and answered all the questions. I have even
&gt; edited the /etc/X11/XF86config file to no avail... So far the best I
&gt; can get is to see 2 pointers on the screen. I have tried to change
&gt; modes and I have even gotten a clean 2 screens. Now this to me seems
&gt; to be a timing thing going on here. I haven't been able to get the
&gt; right frequencies for the horz or vert... Here is what I have:
&gt; 
&gt; Monitor - Generic (Digital SVGA)
&gt; Video card - ATI Rage IIc Pro with 8meg
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know if it is the monitor or the video card, but I can not get
&gt; it to work. I used the XF86Setup program and it works, but when the
&gt; server comes up it doesn't. I have tried 5 different Mach64 chip
&gt; settings and none of them have worked.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas that I may not have covered? The only thing
&gt; I have left is to change the monitor, but the monitor I am using works
&gt; in Windows9x fine from 640x480 to 1024x768...
&gt; 

You definately have a refresh/timing problem.

There is a way to fix it as well :)

We must delve into XF86Config...

First and VERY important are the VerticalRefresh & Horizontal refresh
rates. Dig out that old monitor manual, blow off the dust and find the
correct settings. 

Now in XF86Config there is many lines starting with: 
Modeline "somerezhere"
Workout what rez you want to run at the comment out ALL modelines execpt
one. Preferably one with a low refresh rate

Ie:
Modeline "800x600"   50 800 600 .....
                     ^Refreshrate 

Now start X - you should get a working X setup. 
Time to fine tune it - xvidtune will help here.

At this stage it is VERY VERY VERY VERY important you have you
Hor/Vertical refresh rate correct - if you don't do the following steps!

Click auto,
Now adjust the screen how you like it - ie strech it, pull it, flatten it
Once you are happy - try changing consoles CTRL+ALT+F1 the do CTRL+F7 if
the screen hasn't jumped on you click SHOW.

This will put the modeline in the console. Copy this in to XF86Config,
comment out the other line and your done!

Cheers,
