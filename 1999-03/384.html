Instead on grumbling, someone write them a script, send it to them, maybe
they will use it and put your name in the magazine.

Give it the Linux touch, that is everyone helps everyone.

Please note this is not stated in a mean or nasty way, so no flame wars,
pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaase!

&gt;&gt; Hey There,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have got it up and running. The first thing I noticed about the CD is
that
&gt;&gt; the directory and file names are all lowercase, while the HTML files on
the
&gt;&gt; CD they have put capital letters in for the first characters. Not a
problem
&gt;&gt; in Win95, but it *is* in Linux. When you click on the link, and the
address
&gt;&gt; bar thingo shows the new address, if there is any capitals in the name,
&gt;&gt; change them to lowercase letters and it should work fine.
&gt;
&gt;the APC CD has had this problem for a long time -- I have emailed them
&gt;about it previously, but got no response, and saw no change. Surely it
&gt;can't be hard for them to sort this out... I assume they are using some
&gt;sort of WYSIWYG editor, and not editing source code manually, and their
&gt;tool is probably designed for Windows, so it is probably causing the
&gt;problems, but even so, I'm sure that they could write a script to change
&gt;all links to lowercase, or even do some actual cross-checking with the
&gt;filesystem... Maybe if we all wrote to them, they'd fix it...  Anyway,
&gt;that's my grumble for today... :)
