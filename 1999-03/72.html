You'll need to get hold of XFree86-3.3.3 or newer.  I've got the same video
card (onboard SiS 6326 w/ 8M) and xfree works perfectly using the SVGA server,
but with  OPTION "noaccel" in the XF86Config file to disable acceleration,
otherwise it don't work.

The key thing is to get the NEW version of XFree86.  Chances are you'll
currently have 3.3.1 or so, which is the one that comes with redhat
5.2/pocketbook.

You can probably get the new version from <A HREF="ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/">ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/</A>, which
is my online resource for pretty much anything :)  There are a number of files
to download, so read the readme file.

Good luck :)   If you need any more info, give me a hoy, because I was exactly
where you are several weeks ago (ie at a loss) and now have a gorgeously
working 1024x768 X.

Yum.

&gt; Subject: X windows & video card
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; hello everyone, short time reader, first time submitter.
&gt;
&gt; I have just (alsmost) successfully installed red-hat linux, but I cannot get
&gt; Xconfigurator to recognise my video card, it won't probe it, it is not on
&gt; the list, I have read the docs on the CD, I have tried to set it up as a
&gt; standard SVGA.
&gt; My configuration is:
&gt; brand: SiS    chipset: 6326 AGP Rev #0 8MB on RAMDAC with direct draw.
&gt;
&gt; when I try to 'startX' I get a fatal server error - no screens found and
&gt; (**) SVGA: 16bpp not supported for this chipset
&gt; *** A configured device found, but display modes could not be resolved ***
&gt;
&gt; Am I simply getting my configuration all wrong or do I have the wrong sort
&gt; of video card. When I asked at the store where I bought the computer they
&gt; told me they do not support Linux in any form at all!!
&gt;
&gt; Can someone please help me so that I can finally start to use this obviously
&gt; superior OS.
&gt; Thank you for your time everyone,
&gt;
