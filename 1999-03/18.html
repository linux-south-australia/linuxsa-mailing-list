&gt; Hello,. i have a 8019 Realtek ethernet pnp card.
&gt; i made it jumperless instead of pnp and Slackware recognizes it at boot. but
&gt; i cant do anytrhing network related, unless its on my network. I cant use
&gt; Netscape or lynx or telnet. it just desn't work. wuts going on? i dont have
&gt; an io line in conf.modules file. im not sre about the exact suntax i am to
&gt; use. heres the specs:
&gt; irq = 10, io address = 300xH
Well, it's probably successfully being autodetected on boot by linux, as
you just said, so you wouldn't need to tell it the addy. If you do
though, the format is
options ne io=0x300
(add line to conf.modules.)

However, you haven't quite explained what your problem is.
You say you can't access anything except on your LAN, right?
Where abouts is the gateway from your LAN to the internet?
If it's on your local machine, check that your default route goes to
ppp0 and a specific net route for your LAN goes to the ethernet card.

If it's elsewhere on the LAN, check that the gateway server is
configured to forward packets from you, and proxy for your IP in return.
&gt; 
&gt; can someone tell me wuts up???
The number of excessive exclamation marks and question marks, maybe?

"what" is not spelt "wut", syntax isn't spelt "suntax" and your real
name isn't spelt sdsf either. If it's all intentional, don't bother, it
doesn't make you look cool, only like an irc dropout or an extremely bad
typist.

Anyway, in the future, or in reply to this email, could you try and
quote a little more information? Saying "it just desn't work. wuts going
on??" doesn't enable us to magically solve your problem. Try to explain
in detail how your network is set up - where relevant gateways are,
whether the LAN has 'real' internet IPs or whether it's a local private
network only.
It often doesn't hurt to append the output of such programs as `route
-n`, ifconfig, and maybe an attempted traceroute to ns1.telstra.net.au
or somewhere.

Above all - have you tried having a quick read of the informative HOWTO
guides?
/usr/doc/HOWTO often, or available on the internet. Try reading the
ethernet and ppp/isp-dialup HOWTOs, and the IP-Masquerading one may be
appropriate - you'll know after reading the net-3-howto.

-Toby
