&gt; Toby - Thanks for your reply. It's kind of hard to know where to begin
&gt; reading when you're a beginner, you don't get any error messages and the
&gt; problem is that the application just doesn't do anything!!!
There often are error messages - it's just that they are stored in a
messages area rather than popping up automatically all the time.
Have a look at the files in the /var/log/ directory, in particular
'messages'.
Try using tail -f /var/log/messages, as this will display the last 10
lines of the file, but then keep monitoring it for more details. I
usually edit the /etc/syslogd.conf file so that the same info that goes
to messages also gets pasted to /dev/tty12. (ie. hitting Alt-F12 allows
me to view what's going on)
You may find something in there that helps, but in this case probably
not.

&gt; 
&gt; Have you installed a local proxy cache, like squid?
&gt; 
&gt; No
Okay. How about routed?
Try typing "ntsysv" and it'll give you a thing that lets you choose what
is being started in your current mode. Check that the 'squid' and
'routed' options are disabled. (ie, no [*])

&gt; 
&gt; Have you enabled any transparent proxying in the kernel?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think so - but I'm not sure to be honest ..... Should I have? The
&gt; only change I've made to the kernel since browsing was working before is to
&gt; compile in parallel printer support. The only software I have installed
&gt; since everything was working is some small (network unrelated) x-apps, and
&gt; staroffice5.0
Well, you're probably safe - it'd be fairly hard to "accidentally"
configure in a transparent redirect for WWW. ;)
Although, you'd be surprised at some of the things I've seen people
accidentally come up with!
&gt; 
&gt; Is your default route correct? (ie. pointing to your ppp interface, with
&gt; a gateway?)
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds promising ... How would I check / fix that? (Sorry, I'm not at
&gt; the machine in question at the moment so can't play around myself ....)
Okay, type "route" while dialled up, and see what comes up.
Things ending with pppx as the interface are what you are looking for.
There will definately be one there, as a static route to the gateway
machine that you are dialled up to. However, there should also be a
default route at the bottom of the list. This should be pointing to
ppp0. If it is absent, or if it set to eth0 or something, then you will
need to change it. `man route` will help, but essentially it's 
route del default; route add default ppp0
See if that helps.

If things are still broken for WWW, then can you see if you can telnet
or ftp or ping outside hosts?
try `ftp ftp.redhat.com` or something - see if you get anywhere.
try `ping -c 16 139.130.4.5` and see what you get.

If you CAN use ftp and ping to get out, but not WWW, then I'm at a loss
as to what is going on.
However, I think you'll find that the default route might be your
problem. If so, to correct it add a line saying 'defaultroute' to your
appropriate ppp options file

&gt; Thanks again for you help -
&gt; Michael.
