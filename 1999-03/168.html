&gt; Subject: Re: Still going on about that modem
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; So, the modem is ignoring the +++ command I am sending to it? And then
&gt; &gt;&gt; complaining when I try put it back in data mode because it already is in
&gt; &gt;&gt; data mode?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;That may be because it is expecting a delay between the characters try
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;echo "+" &gt;/dev/cua2; sleep 1; echo "+" &gt;/dev/cua2; sleep 1;echo "+"
&gt; &gt;/dev/cua2
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks Benjamin, but still no luck there.
On the contrary, the modem is expecting no delays between characters. If
you read the manual, I believe some say that some modems require a 3
second delay both before and after the +++, and the +s themselves must
be entered within one second. This applied to my 14.4 modem anyway, when
I was still using BBSs, and I don't know if it applies to newer ones,
because I've never checked.
So, the above line should be
sleep 3; echo "+++" &gt; /dev/modem; sleep 3;
except that the sleep afterwards is perhaps unneccessary, and possibly
the one before is as well. IE&gt; you're back where you started ;)

I beleive that the locking problem is more likely what is stopping you.
The actual .lock file is only there to indicate that the file is locked,
rather than to make the locking itself. I think that's handled at a
kernel level. Are you trying all this as the root user, by the way?

&gt; 
&gt; Its acting like there is a lock on the serial port, but I've taken the
&gt; "lock" out of the /etc/ppp/options file, and it doesn't give an error
&gt; message, like permission denied or anything. Could it be possible it (pppd)
&gt; is locking the serial port??
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
