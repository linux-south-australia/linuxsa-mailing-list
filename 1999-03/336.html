&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;netbios-ssn/tcp: bind: Address already in use
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm pretty sure that it has something to do with the following line in
&gt; &gt;inetd.conf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/smbd smbd
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, this seems reasonable. Under Linux, Samba is usually started from
&gt; /etc/init.d/smb. If that entry was also in inetd.conf, inetd is trying to
&gt; listen on port 139 (netbios-ssn) which is already open ...
&gt; 
Now that would make sense...

&gt; &gt;I have commented this line out for now (my updated understanding is that
&gt; &gt;I don't actually need it) and done a KILLALL, but I'm still getting the
&gt; &gt;error message.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, did you do a killall -HUP inetd?

Yes, I did do a killall -HUP inetd ...
&gt; &gt;Any SAMBA gurus like to explain what's going on?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; What does Process 9 do?

Process 9 Communications sells hardware and small office "solutions"....
I took over the name from someone else - not really sure what it means,
but it "feels" right... *grin*
&gt; 
A Samba team member is more than likely a samba guru - you don't seem to
give yourself enough credit.

Anyway, I haven't been getting the messages for about 24 hours now, so I
believe it's sorted.

Thank you to all those who gave a helping hand. I really appreciate
it...
