Hi Daniel

Looks like you're leaning more to the practical side of things. Make an
appointment with your local TAFE that teaches IT courses and complete
your high school education. You may be able to get credits for what you
already know in your TAFE courses. They call it Recognition of Current
Competancy, you show them you can do it and they give you credit.

Find some volunteer work, even go down to the local computer shop and
ask if you can help out on Saturdays, you may only get paid in computer
parts but don't knock the experience. If you can show TAFE that you know
your way around Windows and can install it etc that's a whole subject.

Good luck

Robyn

&gt; Thanks for all your responses, they have been quite helpful (before this
&gt; I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but not how to get there). I knew
&gt; I wanted to go to TAFE but had quite a bit of worrying that it would not
&gt; get me as far as UNI would.
&gt; 
&gt; Some replies to some replies:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; While at TAFE, see if you can find some Open Source projects to become
&gt; &gt; involved in. Even if you're not a programmer type, try writing
&gt; &gt; documentation, acting as a tester, spend some time in mailing lists
&gt; &gt; doing support, that sort of thing.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not the programmer type yet (still learning, can write basic
&gt; programs but never got past the tutorial introduction programming
&gt; stage.. I keep a kind of journal of everything I do to my linux box
&gt; (mainly because I was forgetting how I did some things, and having to
&gt; learn it all over again) and recently started compiling this into more
&gt; readable guides. I haven't done much in the way of testing, but have
&gt; talked to developers on IRC while trying to get apt-proxy working, and
&gt; uncovered a few bugs (I guess this counts in a way).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Forget crap like MCSE's and CCNA'a. Learn the principles first. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; principles are taught at universities.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's not necessarily true. These days, if you put your mind to it
&gt; &gt; you could do a university degree just be constantly reading and
&gt; &gt; learning from the millions of resources available on the Internet.
&gt; &gt; It's all the same, just not "recognized" as a certification.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree, I have learned a ton of stuff from the Internet, and still have
&gt; a long list of resources in the "to-read" pile. I have taught myself
&gt; just about everything I know (about computers) from the Internet, all
&gt; school ever did for me was give me a chance to show my skills in Visual
&gt; Basic.. (I got an A+ that term, even though I think VB is one of the
&gt; ugliest languages I have ever used..)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When you say network administrator, do you mean
&gt; &gt; switching/routing/comms, or do you mean a more generic rold
&gt; &gt; administrating servers and making sure that an organisations IT stuff
&gt; &gt; works?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If it's the latter then there are lots of good people out there who
&gt; &gt; have simply completed TAFE course to become formally qualified in what
&gt; &gt; they already know from years of tinkering.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Either way, the best network administrator tends to be someone who is
&gt; &gt; enthusiastic wants to be there, and shows some intuition and lateral
&gt; &gt; thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; Definately the latter, I think.. Actually, I am not 100% sure on this. I
&gt; have set several home networks, my home LAN with a Linux server and
&gt; messed around with it, tried to make it secure, etc. and I enjoy this
&gt; type of thing.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier, I was thinking of a career in simple computer manufacturing and
&gt; repair, this was the type of thing I did in my two seperate weeks work
&gt; experience a few years back. I also enjoy this, and feel reasonably
&gt; competant.. but I enjoy the network/systems side of things a lot more.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I agree with the TAFE idea, and if your lucky you may get into a
&gt; &gt; trainee-ship, like the two young men I have working here, both were
&gt; &gt; doing year 12 the year before starting here. One is finishing cert. #2
&gt; &gt; and the other is starting cert. #3, both get a low weekly wage that
&gt; &gt; increments every year, but their TAFE fees are taken care of by us
&gt; &gt; (the employer) and they get paid to study, rather than paying us to
&gt; &gt; study.
&gt; 
&gt; Wow this sounds great, if I could get myself into such a situation I
&gt; would I would be loving it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Get an MCSE and bluff your way into a high paying job...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; DSL
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; [yes, I'm being absolutely and horridly serious]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sad really................
&gt; &gt; The poor guy would want to enjoy his job, the only thing he'd enjoy
&gt; &gt; about the "MCSE high paying job" would be the pay cheque, work would
&gt; &gt; suck majorly....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My advice would be, if you enjoy *nix, stick with it and learn enough
&gt; &gt; of MS to be able to find your way around it etc, don't make a career
&gt; &gt; out of it...... (Alongside that, don't become a *nix bigot who's
&gt; &gt; hardly touched a MS system in their life yet swear that MS is **** and
&gt; &gt; *nix is the only solution to the world's problems ;) I may sound like
&gt; &gt; I'm contradicting myself, but this is the real world, and in most
&gt; &gt; cases it is a MS world, facts suck I know...........
&gt; 
&gt; I know many companies only see MS as a serious solution, and so I think
&gt; that an MCSE would definatly be a good thing to get (if only to impress
&gt; employers). I have no problem with Windows, I use WinXP on my main
&gt; desktop (dual booted with Debian, but XP is what I use mostly.. although
&gt; my serious work is done over SSH on my other debian box). All help I
&gt; have given friends (and friends of friends) has been involving Windows,
&gt; so my knowledge and experience of both OS's I think is a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; So.. now that I have more of an idea about this, I think the best option
&gt; for me will be TAFE (although I'm not actually sure which course will
&gt; help me.. my friend is doing a course but learning a ton of electronic
&gt; componetry stuff (which I can understand but is definately not what I
&gt; want to be doing for a living ) and a little bit of computer stuff (they
&gt; actually learned *how to install* redhat linux (!)) I definately will be
&gt; looking into the other courses such as MCSE CCNA etc, and will of course
&gt; keep up the Internet reading, as that is what has taught me the most and
&gt; probably will always remain so. Thanks everybody.
