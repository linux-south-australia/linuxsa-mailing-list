<H1>VPNs over wireless?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

Hello, list:

I administer a rather diverse network, and part of it is a wireless WAN.
I am a bit worried about the traffic that's flowing over the aether and
so I would like to encrypt all data going over wireless as well as deny
all non-encrypted data. This seems to be the best solution, as you can
basically take it for granted that a determined script-kiddy can
participate on your Wi-Fi network after 1 hour of determined sniffing,
but the worst they can then do is play Quake with a mate bouncing off
the same transceiver. I think. ;)

1)	Does anyone have any recommendations for GPL or similar products that
can do this? Hardware requirements for (say) 30 remote users at 5 sites?
2)	Does anyone know of online references for such a setup?
3)	Does anyone have any comments to make on this topic of network
security, given that the service is in place, I did not set it up, and
all I can do is try to improve it without a budget? :)

Thanks,
--
