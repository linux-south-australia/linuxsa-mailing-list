&gt; &gt; So it appears on the surface that debian is miles behind the others
&gt; &gt; but the fact is that in debian, official releases don't matter as you
&gt; &gt; continuously (or whenever you feel like it) upgrade any packages
&gt; &gt; that have new versions ('apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade').
&gt; 
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you get many package updates
&gt; between releases. Many bugfixes are back-ported though, and I presume
&gt; some features... and some packages are updated with new versions...  but
&gt; I haven't seen many...

yeah sorry - I was referring to Woody at the moment.  Once a release has
been "released" it is called the stable release so yes only security
fixes are back ported (my firewall/gw runs potato still so only has
security updates).  It goes unstable -&gt; testing -&gt; stable in decreasing
order of "bleeding edginess" which is currently sid -&gt; woody -&gt; potato.

BTW kde is a kinda special case, there's a guy in debian who packages
the latest kde "in advance" of it being officially incorporated into
debian so you can get download from him.  This happens a bit where
there's interest in something, use the search on packages.debian.org
to find things like this (or maybe google).

Dave.
