&gt; So,
&gt; 
&gt; If I was to install debian woody once it is released, and decide that I
&gt; need to upgrade a major piece of it, say KDE, what is involved? Do I
&gt; have to go off-world (away from debian for those packages)? Is that
&gt; difficult? Or would I likely find them in unstable, and if so, does
&gt; using unstable somehow muck up the installation? 

Well, you have four realistic options, IMHO:

1) wait.

2) go to testing, hope it's there. unstable is just that -- unstable.
testing is at least 2 weeks behind unstable. You can use packages from
testing without a problem, but I'd be careful about putting testing in
your sources.list -- you'll end up upgrading the whole thing to testing
if you're not careful. There are mechanisms for combining distros though
-- I saw a package for that purpose today. Bear in mind though, that
testing packages may be built with different libraries than stable.

3) hope someone else has unnofficially packaged it up. This happened
with Ximian and Kernel 2.4, among other things...

4) go upstream. Manually remove the debian packages, download the
source, compile away (trying to keep things the same as standard debian
config), and then you may need to re-install packages that depend on
those packages, with --force or something...

I suppose the other option (which, now that I think about it, is my
preferred one) is to d/l the source package, which I *think* has all the
extra debian stuff, d/l the upstream source, and try building your own
updated package with it. Could be non-trivial with some packages, but
trivial with others. At least this way, you remain within apt etc  :)

FreeBSD is very cool with this -- it searches for the actual files it's
missing...

&gt; 
&gt; Does apt know or care that I have some compiled from source software
&gt; installed that is a later version than what is offered at debian and may
&gt; have been installed originally?

No. I *think* that if you compile from source, it will be relatively
easy to install debs over it, though it won't automatically happen...

May want to be certain before you try though.

&gt; &gt; &gt; So it appears on the surface that debian is miles behind the others
&gt; &gt; &gt; but the fact is that in debian, official releases don't matter as you
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuously (or whenever you feel like it) upgrade any packages
&gt; &gt; &gt; that have new versions ('apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade').
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you get many package updates
&gt; &gt; between releases. Many bugfixes are back-ported though, and I presume
&gt; &gt; some features... and some packages are updated with new versions...  but
&gt; &gt; I haven't seen many...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Checking the Developers Reference explains this policy:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html">http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html</A>#s-upload-stable
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Specifically:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ----
&gt; &gt; Uploading to stable means that the package will be placed into the
&gt; &gt; proposed-updates directory of the Debian archive for further testing
&gt; &gt; before it is actually included in stable.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Extra care should be taken when uploading to stable. Basically, a
&gt; &gt; package should only be uploaded to stable if one of the following
&gt; &gt; happens:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     * a security problem (e.g. a Debian security advisory)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     * a truely critical functionality problem
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     * the package becomes uninstallable
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;     * a released architecture lacks the package
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is discouraged to change anything else in the package that isn't
&gt; &gt; important, because even trivial fixes can cause bugs later on. Uploading
&gt; &gt; new upstream versions to fix security problems is deprecated; applying
&gt; &gt; the specific patch from the new upstream version to the old one
&gt; &gt; ("backporting" the patch) is the right thing to do in most cases.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Packages uploaded to stable need to be compiled on systems running
&gt; &gt; stable, so that their dependencies are limited to the libraries (and
&gt; &gt; other packages) available in stable; for example, a package uploaded to
&gt; &gt; stable that depends on a library package that only exists in unstable
&gt; &gt; will be rejected. Making changes to dependencies of other packages (by
&gt; &gt; messing with Provides or shlibs files), possibly making those other
&gt; &gt; packages uninstallable, is strongly discouraged.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Release Team (which can be reached at
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="mailto:debian-release@lists.debian.org">debian-release@lists.debian.org</A>) will regularly evaluate the uploads in
&gt; &gt; proposed-updates and decide if your package can be included in stable.
&gt; &gt; Please be clear (and verbose, if necessary) in your changelog entries
&gt; &gt; for uploads to stable, because otherwise the package won't be considered
&gt; &gt; for inclusion. 
&gt; &gt; -----
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So every Debian distro is a static set of package versions, with ongoing
&gt; &gt; security updates. FreeBSD does this better IMHO...
