So,

If I was to install debian woody once it is released, and decide that I
need to upgrade a major piece of it, say KDE, what is involved? Do I
have to go off-world (away from debian for those packages)? Is that
difficult? Or would I likely find them in unstable, and if so, does
using unstable somehow muck up the installation? 

Does apt know or care that I have some compiled from source software
installed that is a later version than what is offered at debian and may
have been installed originally?

Regards,

&gt; &gt; So it appears on the surface that debian is miles behind the others
&gt; &gt; but the fact is that in debian, official releases don't matter as you
&gt; &gt; continuously (or whenever you feel like it) upgrade any packages
&gt; &gt; that have new versions ('apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade').
&gt; 
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you get many package updates
&gt; between releases. Many bugfixes are back-ported though, and I presume
&gt; some features... and some packages are updated with new versions...  but
&gt; I haven't seen many...
&gt; 
&gt; Checking the Developers Reference explains this policy:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html">http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html</A>#s-upload-stable
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically:
&gt; 
&gt; ----
&gt; Uploading to stable means that the package will be placed into the
&gt; proposed-updates directory of the Debian archive for further testing
&gt; before it is actually included in stable.
&gt; 
&gt; Extra care should be taken when uploading to stable. Basically, a
&gt; package should only be uploaded to stable if one of the following
&gt; happens:
&gt; 
&gt;     * a security problem (e.g. a Debian security advisory)
&gt; 
&gt;     * a truely critical functionality problem
&gt; 
&gt;     * the package becomes uninstallable
&gt; 
&gt;     * a released architecture lacks the package
&gt; 
&gt; It is discouraged to change anything else in the package that isn't
&gt; important, because even trivial fixes can cause bugs later on. Uploading
&gt; new upstream versions to fix security problems is deprecated; applying
&gt; the specific patch from the new upstream version to the old one
&gt; ("backporting" the patch) is the right thing to do in most cases.
&gt; 
&gt; Packages uploaded to stable need to be compiled on systems running
&gt; stable, so that their dependencies are limited to the libraries (and
&gt; other packages) available in stable; for example, a package uploaded to
&gt; stable that depends on a library package that only exists in unstable
&gt; will be rejected. Making changes to dependencies of other packages (by
&gt; messing with Provides or shlibs files), possibly making those other
&gt; packages uninstallable, is strongly discouraged.
&gt; 
&gt; The Release Team (which can be reached at
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:debian-release@lists.debian.org">debian-release@lists.debian.org</A>) will regularly evaluate the uploads in
&gt; proposed-updates and decide if your package can be included in stable.
&gt; Please be clear (and verbose, if necessary) in your changelog entries
&gt; for uploads to stable, because otherwise the package won't be considered
&gt; for inclusion. 
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; So every Debian distro is a static set of package versions, with ongoing
&gt; security updates. FreeBSD does this better IMHO...
