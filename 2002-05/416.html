Hello,

I've been scouring the internet for a knowledgebase (preferably
PHP/MySQL) to run locally on our Intranet.  The main requirements for it
are that it be EASY TO USE -- so easy that a Primary School student
could use it -- and that users are able to bring it up, search for
articles, or browse by category.

They would be able to create subcategories and would be able to add
articles to these subcategories.  Adding articles would be simplistic,
by just by answering questions in a form, which then gets added to the
appropriate subcategory.

I have been looking around at what's available, and nothing I've found
matches this criteria, because everything's either too complicated to
use, or not appropriate.  The closest product available appears to be
the Zope WikiWikiWeb.  I've browsed around the Internet many many times
before and found some reasonably good-looking front-ends of
knowledgebases before, and so am interested in any input and
recommendations anyone may have for what products I should be looking
at.

As I said above, ease of use is the most important thing, because it is
a system that will be open to everyone to use; and in the past it's been
proven that if it's too complicated, it just won't get used.

The only other option is to have one custom-written, and that may yet
still be the way to go.

Does anyone have any good suggestions?
