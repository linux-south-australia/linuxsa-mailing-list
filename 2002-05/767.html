&gt;&gt;&gt; yes, debian is definitely more of an "internet" distro than redhat
&gt;&gt;&gt; and others (which is why I use apt-proxy).  I guess it comes from 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the philosophy of install it once then continuously upgrade bit by 
&gt;&gt;&gt; bit rather than redhat's re-install from scratch all the time approach.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I thin the re-install thing is a fallacy.  Have you actually tried 
&gt;&gt; upgrading Red Hat in the last 3 versions?  I've had no problems on 
&gt;&gt; any of the boxen I deal with.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Last I checked it wasn't possible to do a live upgrade from CD unless 
&gt; you could mount all CDs simultaneously, as packages installed on CD 1 
&gt; often needed packages from CD 2. 

Last several versions of Mandrake allow cross CD upgrades, ejecting one 
Cd and promting for the required CD 
Started implememtation in 7.2 but had a few problems with some library 
files and cross dependancies, works fairly well now in migrating 8.1 to 
8.2. (glitch with NVidia drivers) but I tend to expect this with NVidia.

&gt; It's my experience that Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD are both much 
&gt; more easily upgraded.  I guess we'll see when Debian Woody (3.0) comes 
&gt; out and somebody tries upgrading from 2.2.
