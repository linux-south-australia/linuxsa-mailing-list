Thanks....

sounds good, but I'll probably try the karun option -- want to get RH
7.3 and a couple of others as well...

Hmm... looking forward to trying it, by the sounds of your review... :)

&gt; &gt; OK, it's so close to release that it's funny... Anyone have 
&gt; CDs of the 
&gt; &gt; current images? I'm ready to try it, even if it's not quite 
&gt; released 
&gt; &gt; yet...
&gt; 
&gt; Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; I've got the April02 snapshot of Woody.  It comes on 8 CDs 
&gt; (yes eight!) but 
&gt; comparing this set with the 3 that came with Debian 2.2, this set has 
&gt; contrib, non-free and non-US so that would explain the 
&gt; apparent bloat factor.
&gt; 
&gt; I had been looking at the bug graph on the Debian WWW site and had 
&gt; extrapolated the slope to intersect with zero sometime 
&gt; between April and 
&gt; mid-year.  Then one day it jumped from 59 to 65 which threw 
&gt; my assumptions 
&gt; out the window.  Got sick of waiting and ordered the current 
&gt; snapshot from 
&gt; LSL (about $50).
&gt; 
&gt; In case you're thinking about borrowing my CDs, I'm way up 
&gt; north (just beyond 
&gt; Elizabeth).
&gt; 
&gt; Well now that I've admitted to a recent install of Woody, I 
&gt; suppose you want 
&gt; to know what I think of it....
&gt; 
&gt; _Highlights_
&gt; Ooooh I just luv KDE!  Normally I wouldn't be impressed by 
&gt; eye candy, but KDE 
&gt; can be user-configured in so many ways that one must be able 
&gt; to find a 
&gt; pleasing front end.  I've only had time to get to know the 
&gt; mail and news 
&gt; readers and the amount of settings available are a pleasure 
&gt; for someone 
&gt; accustomed to otherwise fiddling with control files.  A quick 
&gt; look at the KDE 
&gt; Office suite reveals all the features associated with that 
&gt; other Office 
&gt; package that I'm forced to use at work (I work for the 
&gt; Government, LOL ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Xfree86 version 4 is great for three reasons.  1. It finally 
&gt; enabled me to 
&gt; take advantage of my S3 video card (Trio3D chipset). 2. It 
&gt; hasn't locked up 
&gt; and forced me to reboot like the v3 Xfree would do.  3. My 
&gt; wheel mouse works 
&gt; perfectly under v4 whereas it wouldn't do the repeat thing 
&gt; with gpm under v3. 
&gt; As a consequence of "1." my monitor is now running at 
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:1024x768@85Hz">1024x768@85Hz</A> (slightly 
&gt; overclocked), so I can have lotsa detail but without eye 
&gt; strain. I'm not sure 
&gt; which fonts are anti-aliased but they all seem nicer than v3.
&gt; 
&gt; Having contrib and non-free on the CD set is a big plus 
&gt; because I don't have 
&gt; to PPP in order to collect bits and pieces like MySQL.  (this 
&gt; may be good 
&gt; reason to get the latest snapshot from LSL rather than wait 
&gt; for the release 
&gt; which MAY strictly follow the GNU policy like 2.2 did).
&gt; 
&gt; Nice new LILO front end.  Uses the cursor keys to select 
&gt; which disk to boot!
&gt; 
&gt; Many packages respect the command "dpkg-reconfigure 
&gt; package_name" which 
&gt; enables the sysadmin to reconfigure instantly rather than 
&gt; poke around looking 
&gt; for the right script to call.
&gt; 
&gt; _Lowlights_
&gt; The install is still not ready to put into the hands of 
&gt; newbies.  It has a 
&gt; new feature called "Task Select" which enables the operator 
&gt; to grab a bunch 
&gt; of packages based on options like "games machine", "web server", 
&gt; "development" etc.  This is great.  But it has a very nasty 
&gt; interface: I 
&gt; accidently hit return when the cursor had jumped from the 
&gt; selection region to 
&gt; the finish field and ended up installing just a few trivial 
&gt; packages, not 
&gt; once but twice!  I was able to restart it and get back on 
&gt; track, but as I 
&gt; said, this is not for newbies.
&gt; 
&gt; When LILO was run from the install sequence, it failed to 
&gt; understand that my 
&gt; Linux was on hdb and that I wanted to boot from hda.  Fixed 
&gt; manually.  I may 
&gt; submit a bug report about this and delay 3.0 even further.
&gt; 
&gt; There are at least 3 ways to configure XFree86 but only one 
&gt; actually worked 
&gt; (dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86).
&gt; 
&gt; wvdial failed to live up to its promise of a quick 
&gt; configuration (the install 
&gt; actually recommends it). I ended going back to my chatscript.  
&gt; 
&gt; After following the install instructions, some very important 
&gt; loose ends 
&gt; remain to be tied up.  For instance: my CD burner is not 
&gt; ready because I 
&gt; still need to activate the SCSI emulation, my SB Live sound 
&gt; card is still 
&gt; quite silent for want of activating the ALSA drivers, XFree needed 
&gt; persistence to get working, my HP DeskJet 930c still doesn't 
&gt; have its driver 
&gt; (other than plain text) and a kernel compile will be 
&gt; necessary to get APM 
&gt; working (one of my reasons for the upgrade - still haven't 
&gt; got that power off 
&gt; problem sorted)
&gt; 
&gt; _Rant_
&gt; One of Debian's big selling points is stability.  That is 
&gt; only right if one 
&gt; is prepared to live in the past.  If you get seduced by this 
&gt; eye candy thing, 
&gt; KDE, then you have to go to the unstable release.  If you are 
&gt; a real sucker, 
&gt; install Sid and live on the bleeding edge; but then Debian is 
&gt; no better wrt 
&gt; stability than most other distros.
&gt; 
&gt; LOL, I've just run the Kmail spell checker for the first time 
&gt; and it didn't 
&gt; recognise the word Debian!
