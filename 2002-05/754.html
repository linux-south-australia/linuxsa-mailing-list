Hi Desiree,

Thanks for your comments, we'll have agree to disagree on this one.

All the sort of stuff you mention below belongs in the appendix/footer,
thats the Standard way of doing it.

Good point about information overload.

Let David have a few gripes, if he doesn't he'll soon be walking around
the streets of Adelaide with a sandwich-board & a bell. Now, we
wouldn't want that would we!

&gt;Daryl,
&gt;
&gt;I am not talking about pages of crap.
&gt;
&gt;I am talking about one line with a link to unsubscribe at the top of the
&gt;mail message.
&gt;
&gt;As for reading, I, like thousands of other Australians, am suffering from
&gt;information overload.
&gt;
&gt;I do not have the time to read all the details at the bottom of an email
&gt;which includes a person's personal signature (yes I noticed yours too
&gt;Daryl), the standard disclaimer on confidentiality, half a dozen ads, some
&gt;garbage about all the different parent companies who bought you this
&gt;wonderful stuff, and please visit our sponsors at sites abc, def, xyz, etc.
&gt;
&gt;I would welcome to see unsubscribe info in one line at the top of a mail
&gt;message, so I don't have to wade through all the crap at the end to get at
&gt;the unsubscribe instructions - which often aren't at the exact end of the
&gt;message but somewhere among the crap at the end of the message, in the hope
&gt;you wont find it and wont unsubscribe from this site - which of course does
&gt;not support spam.
&gt;
&gt;I am talking standards, I am talking commonsense, I am talking, I am
&gt;talking, I am talking - someone please turn off the tape recording, leave
&gt;out the gratuitous garbage at the end of the message, and simplify how to
&gt;unsubscribe please, so David has one less gripe for his day.
&gt;

Regards,

Daryl  Pilkington
