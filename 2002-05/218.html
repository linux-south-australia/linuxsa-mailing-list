&gt;Get an MCSE and bluff your way into a high paying job...
&gt;
&gt;DSL
&gt;
&gt;[yes, I'm being absolutely and horridly serious]

sad really................
The poor guy would want to enjoy his job, the only thing he'd enjoy about
the "MCSE high paying job" would be the pay cheque, work would suck
majorly....

Speaking from experience, tho i'm not MCSE qualified, only have a couple of
the modules, which are out of date now thanks to M$, *nix systems kick butt
over
MS, primarily because there aren't many problems in *nix where u can't find
a 
**logical** solution.  
In the MS world too often the only solution is reformat C: and start again. 
Too many times I've come across glitches in MS systems where all you can do 
is throw your install cd or ghost boot disk and blow it all away.  Unix is
logical,
MS in general (there are exceptions) is irrational.

My advice would be, if you enjoy *nix, stick with it and learn enough of MS
to be able to find your way around etc, don't make a career out of it......
(Alongside that, don't become a *nix bigot who's hardly touched a MS system
in their
life yet swear that MS is **** and *nix is the only solution to the world's
problems ;)
I may sound like I'm contradicting myself, but this is the real world, and
in most cases
it is a MS world, facts suck I know.............
