&gt; &gt;&gt;yes, debian is definitely more of an "internet" distro than redhat
&gt; &gt;&gt;and others (which is why I use apt-proxy).  I guess it comes from the 
&gt; &gt;&gt;philosophy of install it once then continuously upgrade bit by bit 
&gt; &gt;&gt;rather than redhat's re-install from scratch all the time approach.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I thin the re-install thing is a fallacy.  Have you actually tried upgrading Red 
&gt; &gt; Hat in the last 3 versions?  I've had no problems on any of the boxen I deal 
&gt; &gt; with.
&gt; 
&gt; Last I checked it wasn't possible to do a live upgrade from CD unless 
&gt; you could mount all CDs simultaneously, as packages installed on CD 1 
&gt; often needed packages from CD 2.

That is a big inconvenience, however with sufficiently rigid policies in
place (ie "don't change anything, ever") the frozen in time approach does
allow for more predictable support, depending what the machine is being
used for.

&gt; It's my experience that Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD are both much more 
&gt; easily upgraded.

Add Conectiva to the list, back to 6.0 it is a smooth upgrade path. And I
agree that FreeBSD upgrades seem to work pretty well.

&gt; I guess we'll see when Debian Woody (3.0) comes out and somebody tries
&gt; upgrading from 2.2.

Done it, it does work. I have also upgraded from Corel Linux 1.0 to Woody.
