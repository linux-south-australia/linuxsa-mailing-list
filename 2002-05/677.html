&gt;What does everyone thing about haveing a script that says if a 
&gt;port scan is
&gt;detected from a number, completely block that number for a 
&gt;given period of
&gt;time.  Hour, day whatever...  does this sound heavy handed?
&gt;thanks

Heavy handed??  in a word.....NO!

If it's illegit access (most likely), then who cares if they're 
blocked forever and a day.....of course if theyre on dialup & dynamic
IP then other users may have problems later, so a time limit on the 
blocking is a fairer idea.

(If its legit access then they'll complain they can't get in, of
course if you get a phone call from someone who can't get in to 
your system from that IP then you can have a word about the port
scans...............)


Incidentally, I had a guy ring me a couple days ago who wanted to know
more info about a couple IP addresses that were hammering his Zonealarm
on a Windows box, he sent me the logs and it definitely was a heap of
port scanning.  Funnily enough the addresses were 139.134.5.51 &
139.134.2.190,
these are both Telstra nameservers.  Either someone was spoofing addresses,
or Telstra's nameservers are doing some rogue scanning.

Has anyone else come across this sort of activity from nameservers??
