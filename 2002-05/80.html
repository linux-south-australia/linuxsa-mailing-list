The first thing I want to say is - thank you very much for your help David
Lloyd, Peter Gossner, Richard Sharpe, Richard Russell, David Fitch...and
anyone else that replied... :)

The second thing is I hope that all will turn out for the best for David
Lloyd in the near future.

I know I am still not done yet and am trying to get a useable format on my
web site but have had some "mechanical issues" trying to upload it.

I first, converted my huge file to RTF and then loaded that up into ABIWORD.
That went well, and I even saved it as an separate ABI file. I uploaded both
of those files.

morton2001.org/example.html.

I saved another file as a Docbook, but it took so long for the RTF file to
upload, I didn't think I would be home in time for cornflakes if I continued
today.

I also hope to familiarize myself with Docbook soon.

How to handle changes? That's probably why docbook has been recommended.
Anyway, for now, you can just email me back the portion of the book with any
corrections.

Tommarrow I will work on making a slimmed down version that does not have
pictures so I can the book in an easily transportable and changable format
so I can focus on the content.

Anyway, its late here, and I have to go home as soon as the DSL modem on our
lan stops flashing heavily. Its been going for quite some time now.

&gt;
&gt; I've lost your e-mail because it went to another account I have no
&gt; access to.
&gt;
&gt; To use docbook under RedHat:
&gt;
&gt; 1) write the docbook
&gt; 2) type "docbook2pdf"
&gt;
&gt; Try:
&gt;
&gt; man jw
&gt; man docbook2pdf
&gt;
&gt; Also try:
&gt;
&gt; docbook2[tab]
&gt;
&gt; (i.e. type docbook2 then press tab one or two times)
&gt;
&gt; Goto:
&gt;
&gt; * <A HREF="http://www.docbook.org/">http://www.docbook.org/</A>
&gt;
&gt; ..and download The Definitive Guide. It's a difficult book to learn
&gt; DocBook from but it's a start.
&gt;
&gt; Docbook is a DTD (in XML or SGML).
&gt;
&gt; DSL
&gt;
&gt; (1) Although everyone claims that XML is the supported versin, as far as
&gt; I'm concerned the XML tools in general suck and the DSSSL tools are more
&gt; mature and most likely to render things the way you want.
