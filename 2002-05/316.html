Yeah, thats exactly the way it was. Postgres has always (in the past)
handled larger loading than MySQL but MySQL was faster with straight
queries. However all that has changed Postgres is much faster and MySQL has
added locking. The are much of the same now a days. However I personally
would use Postgres over MySQL.

I always thought that used to be MySQL's problem.. It crawled to a halt
under many simultaneous queries. Postgres apparently had finer locking and
did not have this problem.

This was several years ago and many things have changed; all bets are off.

I'd still put my money on postgres for major installations though.

&gt; hi all,

&gt; i'm after opinions on postgresql. i've heard rumours (unconfirmed) that
&gt; it flakes out under load (&gt; 100 simultaneous queries). i haven't found
&gt; anything about major problems with postgres in my googling. does anyone
&gt; have any stories about their experiences, or can confirm any issues with
&gt; postgres?
&gt;
&gt; thanks in advance,
