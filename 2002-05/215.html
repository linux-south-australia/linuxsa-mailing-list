I agree with the TAFE idea,
and if your lucky you may get into a trainee-ship, like two young men I have
working here,
both were doing year 12 the year before starting here.
one is finishing cert. #2 and the other is starting cert. #3,
both get a low weekly wage that increments each year,
but their tafe fees are taken care of by us (the employer) and they get paid
to study, rather than paying to study.

I have had to teach them heaps, but both have become assets to us very
quickly.

cheers
Tom

&gt; &gt; I am hoping to work towards a career as a network administrator (or
&gt; &gt; some other job in a similar area), and was wondering what exactly I need
&gt; &gt; in order to get the qualifications I would need. I am very interested in
&gt; &gt; Linux and networking, setting up systems and trying to make them run the
&gt; &gt; best I can. I also enjoy learning programming languages.
&gt;
&gt; When you say network administrator, do you mean switching/routing/comms,
&gt; or do you mean a more generic role administrating servers and making
&gt; sure that an organisations IT stuff works?
&gt;
&gt; If it's the former, at least some University education will be useful to
&gt; you. The subject matter of a degree might not be relevant to your career
&gt; path, but the university experience will fine-tune your problem solving
&gt; skills.
&gt;
&gt; If it's the latter then there are lots of good people out there who have
&gt; simply completed Tafe course to become formally qualified in what they
&gt; already know from years of tinkering.
&gt;
&gt; Either way, the best network administrator tends to be someone who is
&gt; enthusiastic wants to be there, and shows some intuition and lateral
&gt; thinking.
