Hmmmmm...

I've just been doing some work on Squid and helping to secure a system
(1) so I thought, I'll run Squid at home. Now, every week I generally
download about 80Mb of data from the Internet, or so my ISP tells me, so
I thought that haing a Squid cache of about 200Mb would be ample.

Therefore, I decided to setup /var/spool/squid (2) and got squid going.
I don't use my ISP's squid as a parent because I'm reasonably certain
that they're running Squid transparently and, hmmmm, ummmm...anyway.
Now, as a user I tend to visit a small number of sites (about 10) which
have lots of changing pieces (3). These sites inevitably insist on using
the most graphics they could possibly find and I swear they all use
graphic expanders (the concept is the same as gzip but it BLOATS the
graphics whilst adding no real value).

I run Mozilla and Netscape with 32Mb of disk cache and 32Mb of memory
cache each.

Interestingly enough, when I started to use Squid it actually has made a
really, really noticable difference...strange. There's only about 1Mb of
cached stuff in .netscape/cache .mozilla/.../Cache and about 2Mb in
/var/spool/squid...

Maybe Squid is managing to find pages more efficiently that Netscape or
Mozilla (I wouldn't put it past it).

DSL

(1) In fact, I made it so damned secure that noone could log onto the
system including root. Nonetheless, Squid would continue to authenticate
users and was working like a charm...

(2) In a fit of brilliance, I decided to repartion /var and make
/var/spool/squid reiserfs because XFS is really crappy at deleting lots
of little files. And you can fit more little files in reiserfs than XFS
because of the packing algorithm (a). However, I discovered that I had
three primary partitions and an extended partition and of course, /var
was on a primary partition killing that idea. Well, not killing it just
making it painful to implement. Therefore I restored my partitions and
of course, /var got corrupted. But my backup of /var was in /var/tmp
because I didn't check that /usr/tmp was actually in /usr --&gt; it was a
symlink to /var/tmp :-( So, anyway, I lost this and that and all my logs
and my cron job for fetchmail (b).

(3) Yes, changing pieces. I wonder what those pieces would be of :-P

(a) I know, the techo word is wrong but you should get the gist (i)...

(b) I only found out because I thought that the Linux C Programming
(<A HREF="http://lists.linux.org.au/listinfo/linuxcprogramming">http://lists.linux.org.au/listinfo/linuxcprogramming</A>) list had gone
really quiet, so I sent it a test e-mail, decided it had died
(linux.org.au's computers are undergoing upgrades and they've killed the
lists accidentally at least once to my knowledge). So I send a message
to the mailman administrator only to discover that I wasn't running
fetchmail and the messages were getting through.

(i) But we're not pedant, right (*)?
