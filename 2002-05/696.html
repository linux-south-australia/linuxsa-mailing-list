Well Actually,

I installed RedHat 7.3 on my desktop Celery400 last weekend, and I
must say that it is now at the stage that it is boring. So far the
only thing I've had to do is install a CSS plugin so that Xine can
play encrypted DVDs. (Just an off note, if you want to play DVDs on an
IDE drive, turning on DMA **REALLLY** helps!)

Load up Xawtv and the USB webcam works without doing anything. XFree
was installed and configured without any intervention. Network was
configured automatically. Haven't had to log in as root yet to do
anything except that Xine plugin. KDE 3 looks pretty good.

Oh, there was one other thing I had to do... Point Evolution to my
IMAP server... For some unknown reason it couldn't guess my password
all by itself!

&gt; wish i could say the same about redhat 7.3..  the first machine i
&gt; installed it on i thought i'll try the x window GUI wizards etc etc
&gt; that look nice. setting up the network / dial up settings went all
&gt; nicely until i got to the last stage that said 'Finish' which was
&gt; very windozy i thought.  crunch! Please send this dump to redhat
&gt; yadadad etc.  hmm, how is a clueless user (like me if you like)
&gt; going to send this to redhat when i can't even get the wizard to
&gt; talk to the network....
&gt;
&gt; i must confess that it wasn't a nice new machine i installed it on
&gt; it was a crusty dual P200 with a fair chunk of RAM and a bog video
&gt; card.....  but still i wouldn't have thought it'd do that to me.
&gt; how wude!
&gt;
&gt; my turn to ramble :)

&gt; well the guys at mandrake have done such a good job that there is
&gt; nothing left to fiddle with in MDK 8.2. So simply put 'Linux has
&gt; become boring' I'll just have to go and do some work for a change
&gt;
&gt; cheers Darrin
