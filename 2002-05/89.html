So we had a consultant come in and he did exactly as I had predicted.

The consultant was called in mainly because we are using an old server and
people are blaming the workstations for it.

Although we have a Super Micro Server with dual PIII 850 megahertz
processors and 30 gigabytes HD. It runs Mandrake 8.2 Samba 2.2.3, our
consultant suggested that we but a $4,500 snap box. Our old server, the
Novell 4.11 server, is a HP Netserver E45  - 233 megahertz.

Most of the workstations are running PIII's ranging from 500 - 800
megahertz. They are all having problems browsing the network, only when we
save files, not when they click on my computer.

The consultant said that we would be much happier if we got new PIV 1.4
Gigahertz workstations running cloned Windows 98 drives at each workstation.
That's another $6,300.

All of these costs plus his labor, just so Caseview/Caseware will run
faster.   However, I already showed my boss that it takes one third of the
time to use Caseware when we run it off of the Samba server.

Any opinions?

Can anyone help me stop the twenty second delay that pops up when we try to
save files in Windows 2000?

Help!

Subject: Samba delay in Netware network


&gt; My boss had a consultant come in and he says that if I use guest accounts
in
&gt; Samba, Windows will delay being able to browse the network shares each
time
&gt; we save.
&gt;
&gt; I want to know if this is true.
&gt;
&gt; If it is not could anyone let me know how to fix it. Our use of Samba may
be
&gt; threatened.
&gt;
&gt; Also, Richard, do you think you could ever come in to our Office in Palo
&gt; Alto to help out?
&gt;
&gt; What are your rates?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; James Leone
