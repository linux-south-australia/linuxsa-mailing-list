Hi everybody,

Well, I guess it is common knowledge that if one of your coworkers on a 
Windows machine gets an obscene email - it probably has a virus attached.

Anyway, we have an older lady in the office and she didn't tell me she 
was getting these emails.

Turns out she had received the Klez and elcorn virus/worm. And we 
finally noticed we had been hit on Friday.

Ok, so our company had a discussion and I basically convinced the boss 
to have that person reboot the machine and go into Linux to check her email.

So I set her up and put in her email settings into netscape. Being that 
her computer was the only computer attached to the network and more 
importantly that I was in Linux, I got a bit bold and checked her email 
and opened one of the obscene messages she receives on a daily basis.

So what do I see  - but a WEB SITE called - sharethefun.com. With links 
matching the obscene titles our employee had received as well as a pop 
up message asking for an email address of a friend to share the fun with.

I went to netsol.com and saw that the domain name is registered to 
"VIRAL MARKETING INC." in New York City.

Ok, so the first thing I did was check netstat.

Up comes 100 or so connections to three ip addresses using ports with 
just as many names. One name that caught my eye was Novell Zen.

So, to me this is some really scary stuff. Comments anyone?
