Adam,

I used ISDN DOV to Internode as my main Internet connection for several 
years. I only recently stopped, as I upgraded to ADSL. It seemed to work well 
for me, and the Telstra bills dropped dramatically from when I was paying 
ISDN data rate costs.

What do you need ?

1 .. Well ... An ISDN connection helps ! Telstra Home Highway seemed good 
value to me, you get a TA (Terminal Adapter) that supports an S bus (Digital) 
connection (ie connects to card below) and a POTS (normal phone) connector. 
You can plug your analog phone into the POTS connecter and use it as a normal 
phone, and it will ring on incoming calls (don't laugh, some TA's did not 
support this).


2 .. An ISDN card supported by Linux. See <A HREF="http://www.isdn4linux.de/faq/">http://www.isdn4linux.de/faq/</A> for a 
list of supported cards. I used the AVM A1 (Fritz!) cards with good results, 
but the Australia made Netjet card is supposed to work well also, available 
from:
 
<A HREF="http://www.everythinglinux.com.au/item/NetJetPCI">http://www.everythinglinux.com.au/item/NetJetPCI</A>

I think Adam sell them locally also (They might pipe up and also say they do 
DOV .. ) . Plug .. If you want I can help you out with an AVM A1 Fritz card 
(ISA only) for $50.


3 .. You will need a recent kernel, and to patch it with the DOV code, 
available from Traverse technologies:

<A HREF="http://www.traverse.com.au/Australia/html/dov.html">http://www.traverse.com.au/Australia/html/dov.html</A>

The DOV patch is not specific to their card, it patches the ISDN code so that 
DOV works with all the passive ISDN cards (that is my understanding, it did 
work for me on my AVM card).


That should be about it. As far as I am aware (I am sure the several 
Internode staffers on the list will correct me if I am wrong) Internode 
support ISDN DOV on normal accounts. They did used to have a special number 
for DOV, but I am not sure if that is still the case. I have to shoot off 
now, but feel free to ask for more info if needed.

Andrew
