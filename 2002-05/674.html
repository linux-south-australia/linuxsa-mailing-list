Hi all, 

aass you may noticee when I type withouutt ccorrectting everyy other
letter, I gett a lot oof repeated letters. This is very frustrating,
bboth for me,  and for aanyoone tryying to read...

and now, meticulously corrected:

This seems to happen on my Toshiba Tecra TE2000 laptop under both Debian
3.0 (beta) and RedHat 7.2, but only within X (in both cases). It is not
affected much by my typing speed -- I can type fast or slow, and I get
about the same number of repeats. I fixed it by setting a KDE
accessibility setting "BounceKeys" on (in the Control Panel), and that
worked, but my typing is faster than the fastest setting, so rather than
getting repeated keys, I was getting missing ones instead. 

I've also tried using kbdrate as well, but it's not actually doing a
normal keyboard repeat, so this didn't work. It would appear that the
linux keyboard scanner is too sensitive somehow, and actually picks up
two separate key events rather than one. 

Anyone experienced this?  Anyone got any clues?  It quite literally
makes linux unusable. 

The second problem is because I'm using the framebuffer device for X, as
well as for the booting console. For some reason, the console drops the
last few lines off the bottom off the screen when running on the LCD
display. This is irritating. I can fix it by hitting the laptop's Change
Screen button, which toggles between the LCD, the VGA out, and both. I
think it also toggles between fb and non-fb as well... Does anyone know
how to fix this? I don't think I need FB for the console, but I do need
it for X (the video card isn't supported -- Trident CyberBlade XP
Mobility ALi).

TIA
