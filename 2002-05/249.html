&gt; So.. now that I have more of an idea about this, I think the best option
&gt; for me will be TAFE (although I'm not actually sure which course will
&gt; help me.. my friend is doing a course but learning a ton of electronic
&gt; componetry stuff (which I can understand but is definately not what I
&gt; want to be doing for a living ) and a little bit of computer stuff (they
&gt; actually learned *how to install* redhat linux (!)) I definately will be
&gt; looking into the other courses such as MCSE CCNA etc, and will of course
&gt; keep up the Internet reading, as that is what has taught me the most and
&gt; probably will always remain so. Thanks everybody.

I am currently doing the "old" diploma in IT at Torrens Valley TAFE and am
impressed with
the course content. Now they offer the "new" training package Diploma in
IT which includes
basic linux operating system admin/network admin, the CISCO coursware,
CNA courseware
and a lot of win2k stuff as well. That looks like the way to go for a lot of
hands on type experience
in a lot of different environments.
Best of luck with the hunting.

BTW anyone out there I will finish my diploma end of term 2 this year ( July)
and would appreciate any
offers of employment   8-)
