I wouldn't pay Tech Pacific for support, but that's opinion i guess. I had
to ring them once about our new gigabit switch..  we bought the chasis but
the gigabit module came later.  it didn't plug in (red lights, not green),
and it turned out to need a firmware update.

what annoys me is if you pay for a $40k switch you only get three months
service.  after that you pay if it's not broken.  this seems to include
flash updates...  i rang them and the guy i spoke to tried to get rid of me
saying i don't have a personal support number or something, but we got there
in the end...  i asked could he simply point me to a place to download a new
update, and was pretty much fobbed off.

had to setup an FTP server for him to upload to as he told me it's too big
to mail.  4 whole megabytes worth.  huge...

just my 2 cents worth....

&gt;I don't know where they cover, and I can't offer any personal experience.
