&gt;Did you know Microsoft was convicted of software piracy last year by a French court? Not many people do. 
&gt;The Commercial Court of Nanterre fined Microsoft 3 million francs because it illegally included another 
&gt;company's proprietary source code in SoftImage 3D, a top-of-the-line animation package. 
&gt;
&gt;The only authoritative report on the event was written by Lionel Berthomier and first published in 
&gt;the French paper, Le Monde Informatique. An English version was reprinted at PCWorldMalta on 
&gt;November 28, 2001 -- about two months after the court's decision. Both Le Monde Informatique and 
&gt;PCWorldMalta are affiliated with IDG, the parent of InfoWorld and LinuxWorld. Yet, neither of these 
&gt;sites published a word about Microsoft's conviction on September 27, 2001.
&gt;
&gt;And nobody else in the segment of the tech media that's traditionally anti-Microsoft picked up the story, 
&gt;either -- not Slashdot, nor LinuxToday, nor NewsForge. Neither did any of the mainstream tech outlets. 
&gt;Nobody noticed this news. Nobody except Peruvian congressman Edgar David Villanueva Nuñez. He's the man 
&gt;who is being hailed by some as Free Software's version of St. Thomas Aquinas because of his 
&gt;"Summa Compulogica" reply to a recent letter sent by Microsoft's Peru general manager, Juan 
&gt;Alberto González. That letter was deemed necessary by Microsoft because of a Peruvian bill that if 
&gt;passed would require its government to buy and use only Free Software.
