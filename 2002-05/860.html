&gt;&gt; Hmmm, why use mount_smbfs when you can simply use NFS and the mount

&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I don't know anything at all about NFS. Is it possible to mount
&gt; a Samba share with NFS? It sounds like something I would like to
&gt; learn.
&gt; 
&gt; All of our worksations are partitioned, so Linux uses the same shares
&gt; that our Windows 2000 workstations do.

Are these shares exported from a Linux machine or a Windows machine?

If they are exported from a Linux machine, I am not aware of anything
that would prevent you from also exporting them as NFS mounts.  You
could have a look at the NFS-HOWTO at <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org">http://www.tldp.org</A>

Alternatively, if you do not care too much about who can read/write
from/to files, then you might like to look at the man page for smbmount,
in particular the "fmask" and "dmask" options, which will allow you to
mount as root, but have the files readable/writable by all.  You might
try something like:

# smbmount //server/service directory -ousername=guest,fmask=0666,dmask=0777

and see if this is what you want.  Be aware that this means that all
users on the client machine will potentially be able to read, write and
delete files at will (subject to the "guest" permissions on the server),
but perhaps this does not matter much to you on a single user machine in
a closed network.
