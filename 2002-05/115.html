&gt; I'm investigating the idea of attaching a mobile phone to our box
&gt; running NetSaint, and sending SMS messages directly from our server...  
&gt; The Internode Email to SMS gateway is cool, but it (obviously) doesn't
&gt; work when our ISDN link fails!  Gnokii (<A HREF="http://gnokii.org">http://gnokii.org</A>) looks like it
&gt; would fit the bill, has anyone used it for this purpose? 

Yes.

&gt; How well does it work?

Pretty well, it took a day to configure.

&gt; Any problems with it?

You may need the version from CVS for some phones.

Your monitoring system needs an understanding of network topology so you
are not flooded with messages on a major failure.  Also, the ability to
'acknowledge' an outage so you are not continually nagged about it is
nice.

You need to tailor the error messages to be short but containing enough
info to determine the severity of the fault.

On the receiving end you want a mobile phone with a fair amount of message
memory.  Some only remember 10, which isn't enough to keep all the
messages assocaited with a major outage.

You need to be rigorous about network monitoring for it to detect all
faults.  So you end up configuring every port, every CPU, every disk, etc
into your monitoring system.  However this is really worthwhile.

We used an exterior GSM antenna designed for a truck.  I'd suggest doing
the same.  You may need to be a bit careful -- some phones won't drive
long serial cables, but you don't want the antenna cable too long either.

Similarly, you don't want the phone too close to the computer.  In an
extreme circumstance you may need to re-case the phone.

The best outcome is to get a phone with a long serial port drive, put this
outside the computer room, close to the antenna.  You don't need a
UPS-protected point, as the phone has a battery.
