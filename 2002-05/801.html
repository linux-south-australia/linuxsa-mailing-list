Yup.

&gt; So I've tried both FreeS/WAN (IPSec) and PoPToP (PPTP), and so far, have
&gt; failed on each one.

PoPToP has got to be one of the most annoying, disgusting,
unmaintained beasts that I have ever had to play with. I've lost count
of the number of hours that I (and colleagues) have spent trying to
get it going.

&gt; Anyone successfully got this running in a similar config -- either ipsec
&gt; or pptp? I'd love to have a chat...

It seems to me that the best way of actually going about this is to
buy a device (or use some software) that is *specifically designed* to
do this kind of thing. Whilst it's obviously possible to get an
inter-OS VPN happening, the amount of time that you sometimes have to
spend seems to be ridiculous.

Having said that, I'm lead to believe that mpd[1] under FreeBSD is
significantly easier to setup than PoPToP. I can't vouch for that with
my own experiences, but FreeBSD *is* generally easier than Linux.
