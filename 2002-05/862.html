&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm struggling with a VPN setup here...

Struggling no longer...

&lt;snip&gt;


&gt; PoPToP looked easier, but it seems to require kernel patches that aren't
&gt; available for my kernel (2.4.18), as well as pppd patches that aren't
&gt; available for my version of pppd (2.4.1)... at least, I can't find
&gt; them...

OK, this turned out to be much easier than I expected. Debian's
kernel-package is brilliant. It's so simple to make your own kernel .deb
package, which will install just as nicely as a real one... I even did
it again on my laptop, and applied a keyboard patch that I found. Great
stuff. The PPTP patch for kernel 2.4.16 worked a treat, and I eventually
found the right version of the pppd patch, which worked on my apparently
debianised pppd no worries -- again, using debian's tools, I was able to
create a real live .deb ... This is why I like Debian (still, I prefer
FreeBSD's way of keeping things up to date)

IPSec turned out to be a complete bastard to configure. I think I could
have got it working ok if I had two linux machines, and no NAT, but with
one Windows, it becomes all but impossible, at least in a reasonable
amount of time. Of course, I'm aware of the NAT issue with either PPTP
or IPSec, and when testing, I removed the NAT, but it's just another
issue I don't want to have to deal with when configuring IPSec -- with
PPTP, as there was less other problems, NAT wasn't as much of a
concern...
