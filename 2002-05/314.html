Don't forget that Postgres decended from Ingres which has a long history as 
a database product (both as commercial and non-commercial versions).

&gt; Slashdot's kinda like mainstream australian newspapers:
&gt; I'll look at one while i'm waiting in a take-away-food joint, and there's
&gt; stuff there thats interesting to read, but its definately not where I look
&gt; for accurate, unbiased, and professional information.
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, and you've agreed, MySQL definately was the inferior product for
&gt; serious databases, several years ago. And we also agree it's been improving
&gt; since.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Postgres started out ahead, and has been developing continually
&gt; too.
&gt; 
&gt; MySQL is good for lightweight apps, personal DBs, etc... it has less
&gt; overhead, smaller footprint, etc. and is simpler to use.
&gt; 
&gt; Postgres, on the other hand, is comparable to professional databases in
&gt; terms of high availability, live backup, replication, high user numbers,
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; If those terms don't mean anything to you, go for MySQL, otherwise... ;)

&gt; &gt; There was an article on slashdot which complained that:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * mysql was technically inferior but more widely used
&gt; &gt; * postgres was technically superior but less widely used
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it was slashdot, it could have been Linux Weekly News.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lately, MySQL has started to introduce finer locking, transactions and
&gt; &gt; so forth. In addition the MySQL team have been working on general
&gt; &gt; optimisations within the actual database.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you happen to be using something like Perl's DBI::modules or PHP's
&gt; &gt; "PEAR" classes you could do a dummy site using both database systems and
&gt; &gt; put both under some form of artificial stress.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Personally, I think both systems have merit and that there's less reason
&gt; &gt; to technically dislike MySQL than there was before. Think about the
&gt; &gt; skills you (or your company's employees) have with each system as well
&gt; &gt; and the support you can get for each one...
