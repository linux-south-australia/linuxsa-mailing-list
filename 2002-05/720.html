Hi,
    I've, been doing my upgrading from the auctions (Physically) lately, 
if your not in a desperate hurry and can spend the time to go to a 
couple. Often a box, no monitor goes for very cheap.

Evens and clarke have one coming up Thursday 30th 6pm 
www.evansclarke.com.au catalogues usually come out wednesday highlights 
are photographed and on display already.

If your strictly looking for new Hardware, I've been putting a few 
systems together for friends, and found the MSI motherboards with either 
DDR or SDRAM are pretty good. Plus the built in ability to overclock is 
extremely nice. I currently have my AMD XP 1700+ running at 1638mhz 
(P2000+ )very comfortably with out warming up, If I push it further it 
still operates OK but starts to warm up.
Pricing MB at sub $250 and CPU's at sub $300  
I have a Riva TNT2 M200 64mb graphics card which runs but is a pain with 
3d, it still haven't got the 3d nvidia drivers to install in contrast I 
have been putting Gigabyte ATI Rage 128 32mb cards in friends machine 
where the 3d sets up and runs straight up.
Tempting me to look at a ATI Radeon 64mb DDR VIVO card next time round 
(anybody tried one of these?)

Note I do use mandrake 8.2 and the system has no problem with running 
however while it does recognise several of the VIA chips and run them OK 
it still sticks them in the unknown basket.

&gt;Hi list,
&gt;
&gt;my main desktop is going belly up slowly, parity errors and kernel panics on 
&gt;boot up, around 50% of the time. I am looking to upgrade MoBo, CPU and RAM 
&gt;only if possible and keep the rest of the box and peripherals intact. I would 
&gt;love advice from list members.
&gt;
&gt;The machine is currently running a Cyrix PR200 (Pentium 150 clone) CPU in a 
&gt;Rhino 12 MoBo. I have a variety of hard drives attached including scsi, in an 
&gt;old desktop box (not tower). I have not upgraded HW for a long time hence 
&gt;have lost touch with what is available/reasonable/worthy in the market. I 
&gt;intend at some stage to wire up the house and use this box as a gateway, 
&gt;print server and file server for the ever-growing list of laptops and PCs.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has trashed something or upgraded and has spare bits along these 
&gt;lines and wants to offload some HW I would be interested in doing a deal.
&gt;
&gt;Bruce
