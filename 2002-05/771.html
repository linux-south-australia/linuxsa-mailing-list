&gt; Well, I'm using Mandrake because it is the most painless and effective
&gt; distro I have found for my hardware (dual celeron + voodoo) that is

&gt; debian doesn't include the later libs etc that I might need if I wanted
&gt; to dl the latest gee-whiz stuff from freshmeat or sourceforge and
&gt; compile it successfully. Actually, some of this stuff is not so
&gt; gee-whiz, it amazes me how quickly many of the libraries are rendered
&gt; out-of-date, esp the gui stuff (can you spell gnome and gtk)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm happy to be edumacated otherwise, please feel free to elucidate.

yes you are wrong.  Mandrake (and redhat) release a lot more often
so if you're only talking formal releases then yes Mandrake 8.2 is
much later (and therefore supports much newer hardware) than debian
potato (2.2 - the last official release).  But debian is a completely
different philosophy, for a start it's a community of volunteers not
a company, they release when it's good and ready and bugger artificial
deadlines driven by marketing or such things as competing with "rivals".

So it appears on the surface that debian is miles behind the others
but the fact is that in debian, official releases don't matter as you
continuously (or whenever you feel like it) upgrade any packages
that have new versions ('apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade').

This is why I said it's more of an "internet" distro.  However I like
to get a CD to install from to start with then from there on do the
upgrade thing.  BTW if you can't wait for official releases you can
get CDs of a snapshot of Woody (debian 3.0) - which is expected to
be officially released "any day now" (tm).  <A HREF="http://cdimage.debian.org">http://cdimage.debian.org</A>
is the place to start from if you want to download an iso - and unlike
redhat you only need the first CD - all the essential bits are on that,
you can apt-get from the internet only the other bits you actually want.

&gt; I do like the principles upon which debian is based, but I do not have
&gt; an unlimited pipe connected to the 'net however.

neither do I!  My last complete upgrade from potato (2.2) to woody (3.0)
was approx 150Mb download - not insignificant but nowhere near 2 or 3
CDs worth if that's what you were thinking.

And you don't have to apt-get from the internet, if you start with the
complete CD set you can apt-get from the CDs as you want to try a
package.  Of course you won't be able to upgrade packages this way
but apart from downloading or getting more CDs there's not much you
can do about that.

Dave.
