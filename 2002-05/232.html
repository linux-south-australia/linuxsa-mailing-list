You could always do a TAFE course in IT that will give you the accreditation to
get into uni -this is far better than a year of maths and pyhsics and high
school IT. 

The best option: A friend of mine didn't have high enough marks, did the UniSA
bridging program (very little cost) and got into uni 6 months later.

Subject: Seeking advice about employment paths


Hi,

I am hoping to work towards a career as a network administrator (or
some other job in a similar area), and was wondering what exactly I need
in order to get the qualifications I would need. I am very interested in
Linux and networking, setting up systems and trying to make them run the
best I can. I also enjoy learning programming languages.

I am doing year 13 so that I can get my SACE certificate, but
unfortunately have not chosen the right subjects to actually get a TER
that I need to get into Uni. I was thinking maybe of doing some courses
in TAFE.

What I was hoping is for advice by people involved in this area of
employment as to what courses I should be looking at, and really any
useful information you may have.

Thank you very much for this, I really appreciate it.

Regards,
Daniel Mundy
