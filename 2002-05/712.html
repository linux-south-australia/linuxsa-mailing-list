&gt; What they are doing is using Windows's Secure Attention Key.  This is
&gt; a key (sequence) which is guaranteed to elicit a response from the

&gt; that linux doesn't use one for logon (I guess you can't be above C
&gt; level secure, maybe even C1, without SAK.)  If you were going to be
&gt; clever you would replace init's ctlaltdel handler with one that
&gt; presented a login/out prompt.

Windows NT, in various forms has earned a Orange Book C2 security
rating.  Trusted path stuff (ie a Secure Attention Sequence, implemented
on NT as a Secure Attention Key) is a B-level requirement.

Orange Book criteria applies only to stand alone machines.  So if you
have your NT machine plugged into a network it is (by definition) not
Orange book C2 compliant.

The TCSEC criteria that applies to networked machines is the Red Book
criteria.  To the best of my knowledge NT has not been successfully
evaluated against these criteria, although this could have changed
because it has been a little while since I've been involved in this kind
of thing.  If they have been granted red book security, then I am
flushing my red book down the toilet now, given the number of issues
Microsoft has had with their networking :)

It would not be infeasible to implement a functional and correct Secure
Attention Sequence on Linux machines.  The kernel hooks are already
there (see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/SAK.txt).  The current
implementation just kills all the tasks that have the current tty open,
which is not quite right, but this could be fixed.

Regards,
Martin
