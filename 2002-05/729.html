We've not bought cards for a hundred years cos the old Cycaldes ones we have
continue to work fine, got a Cyclom-Y board working as our dialup server at
the moment (thanks to a few friends on the list  :))

Looks like they're still selling the Y model as well as as new Z model which
looks like a lot more ports.  ours is the 8 port one.  we're quite happy
with them....  email their support and get an answer within a day as well,
at least the one time i tried to get onto them...

not sure when you say RAS card, you mean all the modems on the board??  or
just a plain old serial board....

&gt;Hi all

&gt;Just pricing up some RAS cards, we're wanting to increase
&gt;our dialin capacity on a Linux box.

&gt;From my brief googling research it seems that Digi's Acceleport
&gt;cards work fine with *nix, however on pricing them I nearly
&gt;choked on my coffee.  Theyre talking around 4 grand for the 8-port
&gt;card, and not a whole lot less for the 4-port version.

&gt;Surely there's a better/cheaper option out there, what does everyone
&gt;out there use, and more to the point, what did you pay for the cards??

&gt;TIA
