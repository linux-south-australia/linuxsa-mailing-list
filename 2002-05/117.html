Hi everybody,

Thanks for all of the support and help.  Things are much better.

I also want to thank people for helping me with my guide. It has been a 
learning process.
Some of you helped me by just encouraging me and others have given me 
technical help, the kind a newbie like me needs.


Acknowledging others for improving the quality of the guide

I don't know how to acknowledge other people in the guide because on the 
one hand it could quite possibly end up not having been completed 
without particular people's help or support. But, at the same time,there 
may be people that are really more technical and deserve to be known for 
more technical writings. Most of the entire group I suppose.

So, if you modify the guide, you can add yourself, say anonymous, use an 
alias, whatever if you want to. That way, I stay out of it but stick to 
the GDL. 


Patches

Someone had an idea on a means to make changes to the guide - they sent 
a tar.gz file with changes to me. I should then be able to unzip it.

Anyway, I am going to take a look at it now.


Also, please let me know if I am going about this wrong, or if there is 
a better way.


Thank you!


James Leone
