Hmm,

University is not primarily about learning facts, but about learning how 
to think.  

A University degree (arts, maths, engineering, whatever) is about learning 
the skills of thinking.  Taking a problem, breaking it down, analyzing it, 
understanding it, learning about it etc.  Sure, if you do a Maths degree you 
become better at understanding maths problems and if you do an arts degree 
you become better at analyzing literature etc.

Training your mind to think and analyze is vastly more important and will 
help you with your entire life.  Part of that training is the ability to 
remember certain facts and to be able to reason about new facts that you 
come across and to be able to put those facts into context.

Facts come and go.  Thinking is still the most important thing.

&gt; &gt; The priciples are taught at universities.
&gt; 
&gt; That's not necessarily true.  These days, if you put your mind to it you
&gt; could do a university degree just be constantly reading and learning
&gt; from the millions of resources available on the Internet.  It's all the
&gt; same, it's just not "recognized" as a certification.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you've got the fundamentals under your belt the CCNA and the RHCE
&gt; and the CNE and the MCSE and all the others -- they all mean something
&gt; (well maybe except for the MCSE, that just proves you know how to use a
&gt; GUI and click some buttons,) but they all give you the ability to focus
&gt; toward the type of work you want to do within your industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe that's what you're saying, when you say "forget" -- learn the
&gt; principles first and then do the rest later, but what I have never liked
&gt; about a university is that you go in and learn a whole lot of stuff for
&gt; many years, and then spend several more years learning how to apply that
&gt; knowledge to every-day applications.  While you're off studying you're
&gt; not learning about the real world in IT, you're "preparing" for it.  Who
&gt; wants to wait years and years and finally begin your working career at
&gt; 26 years old, after making some money on the side at McDonalds while
&gt; studying for your degree?
&gt; 
&gt; Once you've been to University, you're not so great.  You can't just go
&gt; in and learn the fundamentals of networking at uni and then go
&gt; somewhere, get hired, and instantly be able to install Hylafax with your
&gt; eyes closed.  There's a whole new world to learn now that you've
&gt; graduated.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a choice of either years of study and then years of learning to put
&gt; that knowledge to use every day, or working as much as you can now
&gt; toward your career, learning as much as you can, and then putting the
&gt; knowledge and the work together at the same time.  I think real-world
&gt; experience is a far greater asset to your education than any university
&gt; class, because you're doing it hands-on and it means something.
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't employers also agree that if you sat a university student down
&gt; who'd just graduated next to some HaXX0r teenager and told them both to
&gt; write a program which accomplished a certain function, wouldn't you
&gt; agree that at this point you still wouldn't know which of the two will
&gt; write the better program?  That's the thing about Information
&gt; Technology... It's about people with aptitude and people with brains,
&gt; not necessarily people with diplomas.
&gt; 
&gt; However -- I might point out you can't just walk up to a place and say
&gt; "Hire me, I'm good!" but DON'T stop trying.  Get in and do work
&gt; experience with your peers, and you might find that once you've come in
&gt; on "temporary work experience" that you've become an asset and the
&gt; company won't let you go.  But hey, enough of my life story lol
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh wow I sound like an old man.
