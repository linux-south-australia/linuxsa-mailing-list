&gt; What they are doing is using Windows's Secure Attention Key.  This is
&gt; a key (sequence) which is guaranteed to elicit a response from the
&gt; operating system, and not from any random program which happens to be
&gt; mimicking the login prompt.  SAK's are a good idea and it's surprising
&gt; that linux doesn't use one for logon (I guess you can't be above C level
&gt; secure, maybe even C1, without SAK.)  If you were going to be clever
&gt; you would replace init's ctlaltdel handler with one that presented a
&gt; login/out prompt.

Which would be all too easy to do if you looked up the documention of
inittab. I'm not sure if the KDB sysrq key sequence would qualify as a
SAK but it *probably* would and as it's a *kernel* service you'd
probably have to hijack the kernel itself to hijack its behaviour...

But I'm tempted to think you're being facetious in which case I'm going
to unilaterally decide you're a NORTI boi.
