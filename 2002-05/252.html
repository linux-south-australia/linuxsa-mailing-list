Hi Daniel,
/* Start Soapbox Here */
Uni may be an option further down the track.

Uni generally, (!), has reasonably smart people, but outside Uni, its a
mixed bag, & you have to work with the mixed bag, which is always
interesting.

Graduates who have had a working life before Uni are much more balanced
& capable of dealing with the real-world much better.

I learnt a lot a Uni, but I've learnt heaps running my own business &
helping run other peoples. I never completed my degree as it wasn't
taking me were I wanted to go. Now, I'd have no problems going back to
Uni, because I know what I want to do I what I want out of being there,
however professional certification, (RedHat, Lotus, IBM), would be more
of an advantage than Uni.

It is becoming more common to go back to Uni in your 20s & 30s.
Many of my peers at Uni had families, were studying
part-time/full-time.
There backgrounds were roadies, army...
Hell, the head of my engineering school was an electrician.

Later in professional life, not having the Uni degree is Not Good from
a prospective employers view, but perhaps you might be interested in
running your own business, so having skills you can market to customers
is more important than the degree, so certification is more important.

Its 3-4 years of you life, so you'd better know that is *really* what
you want to do.

Its easier to find out the things you don't like than the things you
do.
So armed with differing professional experiences, you'll start to
understand the fundamental things that turn you on, like: "Hey, I like
problem solving, dealing with people, the buzz of working on something
new, good design..."

/* End Soapbox Here */

Keeping a professional journal is A Good Idea.
I've got 27 of them for the last 3 years :)

Regards,

Daryl  Pilkington
