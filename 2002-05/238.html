&gt;The best option: A friend of mine didn't have high enough marks, did the
UniSA
&gt;bridging program (very little cost) and got into uni 6 months later.

If you are *very serious* about doing computing then make an appointment to
see the dean of the relevant school of *most* universities (forget
Adelaide, they are not friendly).   Speak to the dean direct about your
problem and what you would like to achieve, they have the ability to open
doors that many do not know are there.

He may suggest you do a bridging course or allow you to demonstrate your
abilities in a first year trial, pass all subjects and go on to second
year, basically bypass the SACE system.   Works if you are able to justify
the cost of going to Uni, not sure how HECS copes with this you might end
up a fee paying student (uni's love these students !)

Also look into doing it via correspondance, Charles Sturt Uni et al have
very good IT courses, only have to spend 2 weeks at Res School per semester
but allows you to work at the same time and earn money.

&lt;rant&gt;

I wish I new there was this option when I was going through school, I would
have dropped high school at year 10 and got a jump on my Eng Degree
(*sigh*)... Instead of procrastinating for 2 years at High School because
you cant finish before you are 16 and spending a further 5 years waiting to
serve my time at Uni ?:(

&lt;/rant&gt;

Matthew.
