A result of a conversation at work, and I see from the archives something
like this has come up a few times before... I have just replicated the
problem in laboratory conditions, and thought I'd share the solution.

Sometimes you can get in a situation with CPAN where it wants to upgrade
Perl just because one single module you have pulled in thinks it might
perhaps want a later version (or maybe an author specified it in a fit of
absent-mindedness.) This can be really bad, because CPAN doesn't know
anything about your OSs packaging or layout, and if you are running the
CPAN make as root - I try not to except for installation but sometimes
you have to - it can make a real mess. 

In fact, this is no longer a CPAN fault. If you are experiencing such
problems, try this:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install CPAN'

and then try the CPAN make again. Chances are it won't try to upgrade Perl
on you any more even if you are running something less than Perl 5.6.1.
