Simple:

- typically unix admins don't want people to know they're out of the office 
because they want other people to think they're really busy and important 
because they alone hold the whole company together.  And thus they are too 
busy to reply to an email.

- NT administrators want people to KNOW they're out of the office because 
obviously they're important enough to spend their lives lunching and at 
Microsoft "Mindcontrol^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HSeminars" and not actually doing 
something distasteful like touching a computer.  

- Network engineers believe email is a layer7 thing and so isn't really part 
of their job description.

(It was _sooo_ hard not to say something _really really really_ nasty)

&gt; Ugh,
&gt; 
&gt; What is it about.. people?
&gt; 
&gt; I am subscribed to two major OS-platform discussion lists.  One is this
&gt; one, and one is a Windows NT discussion list.  I have posted to both.
&gt; 
&gt; When I post to the NT list, I usually receive at least one automated
&gt; reply from someone on the list saying they are out of the office, and
&gt; that all enquiries should be directed to such-and-such a person until
&gt; they get back.  I often respond to these inquiries, telling the person
&gt; who idiotic it is that they are posting an "Out of office" reply to
&gt; someone who posted to a mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; There are extremely regular posters to that list, and I can imagine the
&gt; amount of "Out of office" junk they receive in their email EVERY DAY.
&gt; It would totally suck.
&gt; 
&gt; These people are in a Sysadmin position, and as such should *realize*
&gt; what is going on.  But they don't.  The interesting thing about it is
&gt; that I would never ever receive an email like that from this list, but I
&gt; receive them every time from 'the other' list.  Let it be known, that
&gt; the topic has been brought up on the *other* list and nothing you can do
&gt; seems to stop it!
&gt; 
&gt; Does a simple thing like that show anything about difference in quality
&gt; of service, or quality of software between the NT and Linux platforms?
&gt; Simply that the people on the NT list are limited by their own brains to
&gt; not set up auto-responders correctly, or is it that they simply can't
&gt; customize it, because they're using a crappy piece of software?  And if
&gt; that were the case, wouldn't they think about it an unsubscribe?  It
&gt; drives me insane, it really does.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Why is this so?  Does it separate the man from the monkey?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Or am I being totally unreasonable?? :)
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm going to post an email to the -other- list aswell.
