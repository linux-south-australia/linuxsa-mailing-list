There was an article on slashdot which complained that:

* mysql was technically inferior but more widely used
* postgres was technically superior but less widely used

I think it was slashdot, it could have been Linux Weekly News.

Lately, MySQL has started to introduce finer locking, transactions and
so forth. In addition the MySQL team have been working on general
optimisations within the actual database.

If you happen to be using something like Perl's DBI::modules or PHP's
"PEAR" classes you could do a dummy site using both database systems and
put both under some form of artificial stress.

Personally, I think both systems have merit and that there's less reason
to technically dislike MySQL than there was before. Think about the
skills you (or your company's employees) have with each system as well
and the support you can get for each one...
