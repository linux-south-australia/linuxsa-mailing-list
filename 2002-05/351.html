there's a reasonable bit of info on their website, search for
ISDN Home or Onramp Home Highway.  Of course they don't mention
DoV at all, see www.traverse.com.au for details on that.
Telstra want you to pay a timed data call of 30c/hour to the
bigpuddle or $1.10/hour to other ISPs.
 
&gt; How well does it work, and what's required to do DOV to an ISP?

very well, you get the equivalent of 2 normal phone lines, ie
the telstra NT1 box they supply has 2 ports on it for the 2 lines
plus a 'data' port.  To do DoV to an ISP you need an ISDN card or
external TA (terminal adaptor - sort of equivalent to a modem)
and an ISP that supports it.  I use an AVM card cos it was cheaper
but lots of people use NetJets.  You just plug the card into the data
port of the NT1 (standard RJ45).  

Patching the kernel (patch from Traverse) for DoV is a bit of a pain 
in the arse and I also needed Traverse's isdn4linux utils too.
It was a fair bit of messing around but the benefits are worth it.
(I'm using the 2.2.19 kernel BTW, Traverse had a patch for the 2.4
kernels too but I got the impression it was more 'beta' quality
than the 2.2 one).

One 'catch' or something to be aware of anyway, is that the ISDN Home
service does not count under the ACA rules as a "standard telephone
service" which means the normal fault response/repair times and
things like the customer service guarantee don't apply.
