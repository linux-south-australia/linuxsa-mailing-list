<H1>[OT] Rant about NSI/Verisign</H1>

Hi all,

I apologise for the public rant, but (a) I need to vent, and (b) this 
may be of interest.

Remember the days when Network Solutions Inc. (NSI, now owned by 
Verisign, AFAIK) was *the* place to buy domain names? Remember thinking 
that it was going to be chaos when others joined the game, and vowing 
that you'd stick with NSI because you knew what they did, and they did 
it well?

I approved the transfer of a domain name (not mine) away from NSI 
yesterday - the company that owns it [the domain] wants all their 
domains in the one place, and for some reason, I'm still the technical 
contact (from way back).

So, after already responding to the email from NSI (telling me that if I 
don't approve the transfer in 6 days, the request will become null and 
void) they send me another email today, asking for the request to be 
approved again!

Only this time, I have 96 hours to do it (hmmm, a day seems to have gone 
missing!) and, what's more, the request is in an email that's got a 
subject nothing to do with the transfer, at the bottom of a whole pile 
of messages about NSI's services and how much they value me!

If I hadn't read the whole email to try and figure out why SpamAssasin 
hadn't automatically forwarded the email to SpamCop for resporting, I'd 
never have even looked at it.

Despicable.

Grrrrr.

Damn. I don't even feel any better about it!
