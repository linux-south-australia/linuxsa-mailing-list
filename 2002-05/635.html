&gt; Older versions of GNU-TAR (most notably those shipping with RedHat 6.X)

Yes, and there are other problems of this category too. I probably should
have said "given known-good versions of gnutar, dump-for-your-OS and
Amanda, which should be used and when?"

I was expecting (and still do :-) that the answer to my question will talk
about things like Irix or Solaris. I have tested 64-bitness which doesn't
seem to swing it one way or another.

&gt; The amanda user's mailing list appears to agree that xfsdump works
&gt; reasonably well with amanda.

Well whatever the mailing list says I can tell you that it works for me,
but you have to do special stuff.

&gt; I have a sneaking suspicion that's actually a religious war, although it
&gt; should be reasonably clear that a tar archive is probably more portable
&gt; than a dump archive. That is to say, you're more likely to see GNU-TAR
&gt; about the place than dump.

I'm not so sure about that which is why I asked.

&gt; I seem to recall that Linus doesn't like dump but I can't quite remember
&gt; where I heard that.

Well, it is a pretty nasty thing to have filesystem-specific tools. Not
all dump/restores are like this, but most of the modern ones seem to
be. I can't go dump on ext3fs and restore on Tru64, it just doesn't work.
