Volunteer work also looks good on a resume.
Computerbank is always looing for volunteers that we are happy to train!
But there are plenty of groups around you could be involved with.

Thats good practical stuff, but there is demand for uni graduates with pretty 
comp sci/IT degrees too. Lots of theory there!

However, nothing beats experience:)

Good luck with it!

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am hoping to work towards a career as a network administrator (or
&gt; some other job in a similar area), and was wondering what exactly I need
&gt; in order to get the qualifications I would need. I am very interested in
&gt; Linux and networking, setting up systems and trying to make them run the
&gt; best I can. I also enjoy learning programming languages.
&gt;
&gt; I am doing year 13 so that I can get my SACE certificate, but
&gt; unfortunately have not chosen the right subjects to actually get a TER
&gt; that I need to get into Uni. I was thinking maybe of doing some courses
&gt; in TAFE.
&gt;
&gt; What I was hoping is for advice by people involved in this area of
&gt; employment as to what courses I should be looking at, and really any
&gt; useful information you may have.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much for this, I really appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Daniel Mundy
