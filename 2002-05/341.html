Ive done some comparisons with build 641d on windows and with doc files.
I dont have the specs, but I noticed that with a several mb doc file
word was quicker to load, but it hadn't loaded all the graphics, and
when you scrolled to a page you had to wait a second for the graphics to
apprear. 

OO seemed to load the lot up front, and so even while holding down page
down all the graphics where there as you flew past. Which method is
better is probably debatable, but similar reasons can probably explain
the speed difference between excel and scalc (?).

&gt; &gt;Just opened a 5mb spreadsheet, 13500 rows with formulas, took around
&gt; &gt;8 seconds and works/looks exactly the same as the same spreadsheet in
&gt; &gt;Excel (Excel takes around 3-4 seconds for the same spreadsheet, haven't
&gt; &gt;tried saving it in native OO format yet).
&gt; 
&gt; OS: Win2000
&gt; Software: Excel 2000 / Openoffice 1.0
&gt; 
&gt; Spreadsheet, 13500 rows, fairly simple formulas.
&gt; 
&gt; Filesizes:
&gt; Excel 2000 (.xls) format: 5.3mb
&gt; Openoffice (.sxc) format: 524kb
&gt; 
&gt; Time to open xls format:
&gt; Excel: 4 sec
&gt; OO: 8 sec
&gt; 
&gt; Time to open sxc format:
&gt; Excel: n/a
&gt; OO: 34 sec
&gt; 
&gt; Go figure.....................maybe they've done more work on
&gt; MS Office compatibility than its own native format, fair enough
&gt; I guess seeing as most of the business world operates in .doc & .xls.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be interested to know anyone else's mileage with similar files.
