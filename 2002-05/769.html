&gt; The other and more likely solution is to filter out anything that has
&gt; "unsubscribe" in the subject.  My email client (sylpheed) dumps anything
&gt; like that straight into trash and I don't have to see it.  Takes about
&gt; 30 seconds to set up.

That may be true, however sometimes people do have legitimate reasons
for having unsubscribe in their subject. Besides which, contrary to
popular opinion, I've rarely (if ever) actually been unhelpful to anyone
who has:

* posted e-mails in HTML;
* posted unsubscribe messages incorrectly

...people conveniently pass over the fact that I do answer the contents
of HTML e-mails and I do point out how to unsubscribe.

LOL

;-P

(ps: The guy who was trying to unsubscribe sent me a thank you note and
we continued a short, off-list discussion about the follies of drinking
beer and attempting to unsubscribe from mailing lists late at night. I
assure you, he wasn't upset by me e-mail at all ;-P)
