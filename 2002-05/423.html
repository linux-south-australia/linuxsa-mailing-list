Ugh,

What is it about.. people?

I am subscribed to two major OS-platform discussion lists.  One is this
one, and one is a Windows NT discussion list.  I have posted to both.

When I post to the NT list, I usually receive at least one automated
reply from someone on the list saying they are out of the office, and
that all enquiries should be directed to such-and-such a person until
they get back.  I often respond to these inquiries, telling the person
who idiotic it is that they are posting an "Out of office" reply to
someone who posted to a mailing list.

There are extremely regular posters to that list, and I can imagine the
amount of "Out of office" junk they receive in their email EVERY DAY.
It would totally suck.

These people are in a Sysadmin position, and as such should *realize*
what is going on.  But they don't.  The interesting thing about it is
that I would never ever receive an email like that from this list, but I
receive them every time from 'the other' list.  Let it be known, that
the topic has been brought up on the *other* list and nothing you can do
seems to stop it!

Does a simple thing like that show anything about difference in quality
of service, or quality of software between the NT and Linux platforms?
Simply that the people on the NT list are limited by their own brains to
not set up auto-responders correctly, or is it that they simply can't
customize it, because they're using a crappy piece of software?  And if
that were the case, wouldn't they think about it an unsubscribe?  It
drives me insane, it really does.


Why is this so?  Does it separate the man from the monkey?


Or am I being totally unreasonable?? :)

I think I'm going to post an email to the -other- list aswell.
