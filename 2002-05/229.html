&gt; While I agree with what you're saying, a diploma/degree mostly
&gt; pre-qualifies brains and aptitude. Without them it would have been hard
&gt; to a) get into university in the first place, and b) stay motivated and
&gt; committed to studies while all your friends are out earning money.
&gt; 
&gt; When someone sees your resume, they have to take your word for it that
&gt; you have brains and aptitude. With a degree or diploma as well, it's not
&gt; as hard to sell :)

Thats why my 2 mates who did CS now work on a help desk, and myself who
did Richard Sharpes "hands on linux" over 1 week has a linux admin job
[1]. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

However, I think it depends on the company, and to a certain extent
luck. I think degrees help more with larger companys. Of course
experiance is always highly regarded, and you could do some volunteer
work or something like someone else suggested.

Ant

[1] and the fact I had been running linux 2 years at home and could
demonstrate skill and knowledge helped ;)
