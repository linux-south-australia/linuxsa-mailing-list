DEC tulips are good by design it just sounds like some faulty
implementations are around. Personally, I have found them to be very
repliable, including the DLink ones which have 4 chips on 1 card (which
we are now putting in machines to use as routers). The Dlink one had a
picture on the box with real tulip chips, but on the card they were an
intel chipset. Still no probs though - they show up as 4 tulips. Ive
also used some really old netcards with old genuine tulips and they
worked fine as well. Having said that I use the rtl-8139 chips at home,
and have never had a problem with any of those either. I guess you just
have to be unlucky.
