Heeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllpppppppppppppp,

I am inbetween a really really really big rock and the very deeeeeeeeeeep
ocean.

For political reasons I cannot upgrade my samba but I need to be able to get
Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Servers, Windows NT 4 Service Pack 6a
Workstations, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Workstations, My Tru64Unix v4.0D
Servers and my Linux 6.2 servers to talk to one another without going
balistic but I have at least two problems I can't resolve and really need
some help if anyone has run across them before:

1.	The NT Workstation can sometimes map drives to the Unix/Linux boxes
but then the next time someone tries the same thing it wont work for no
apparent reason.  Note:  I had an election problem on my servers which I
fixed by setting the Tru64Unix v4.0D servers being the SAMBA Workgroup
Masters for the two SAMBA domains.

2.	The Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Workstations can map drives but as
soon as they do, their Windows logon accounts are locked immediately.

I've checked the Samba website and have found people have these problems and
the only solutions rendered are change the registry for plain text passwords
(which is already done on both types of Workstation) and ensure Windows 2000
doesn't use the wrong sort of transmission protocol and, of course, upgrade
to the next version of Samba.

At this point, some workstations are mapped and are very happy but non of
the Windows 2000 workstations are mapped because of the problem I've got.
