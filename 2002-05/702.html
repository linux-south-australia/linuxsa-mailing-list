To clarify, running the VBS script the way I did mapped the drives when 
Windows 2000 was ready. The result was a Samba client that mapped the 
drives properly with nothing unusual noticed by the user.

There are some other "tweaks" that can make Win2k fit better into the 
network. I posted my references about a day ago.

&gt; I had a similar problem with Windows 2000, where my drives wouldn't

&gt; net view at the DOS shell and then mapped the drive - I realized that 
&gt; the drives were trying to map "too soon." I automated this process by 
&gt; maping the drives with a VBS script:

&gt;&gt; Heeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllpppppppppppppp,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am inbetween a really really really big rock and the very 
&gt;&gt; deeeeeeeeeeep ocean.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; For political reasons I cannot upgrade my samba but I need to be able 
&gt;&gt; to get Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Servers, Windows NT 4 Service Pack 
&gt;&gt; 6a Workstations, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Workstations, My 
&gt;&gt; Tru64Unix v4.0D Servers and my Linux 6.2 servers to talk to one 
&gt;&gt; another without going balistic but I have at least two problems I 
&gt;&gt; can't resolve and really need some help if anyone has run across them 
&gt;&gt; before:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1.      The NT Workstation can sometimes map drives to the Unix/Linux 
&gt;&gt; boxes but then the next time someone tries the same thing it wont 
&gt;&gt; work for no apparent reason.  Note:  I had an election problem on my 
&gt;&gt; servers which I fixed by setting the Tru64Unix v4.0D servers being 
&gt;&gt; the SAMBA Workgroup Masters for the two SAMBA domains.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2.      The Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Workstations can map drives 
&gt;&gt; but as soon as they do, their Windows logon accounts are locked 
&gt;&gt; immediately.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've checked the Samba website and have found people have these 
&gt;&gt; problems and the only solutions rendered are change the registry for 
&gt;&gt; plain text passwords (which is already done on both types of 
&gt;&gt; Workstation) and ensure Windows 2000 doesn't use the wrong sort of 
&gt;&gt; transmission protocol and, of course, upgrade to the next version of 
&gt;&gt; Samba.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; At this point, some workstations are mapped and are very happy but 
&gt;&gt; non of the Windows 2000 workstations are mapped because of the 
&gt;&gt; problem I've got.
