Quoting "nik [tm]" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tmcruisin@sond.com.au">tmcruisin@sond.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am really just after opinions, I am currently setting up a web which will
&gt; have user/pass access. I have looked into .htaccess and find that easy to
&gt; use, but I am thinking of a good way to add/remove users into the
&gt; flat-file.
&gt; we will be adding these users and their passwords into a mydql db, which we
&gt; will set whether they are valid or not and using php to get the valid users
&gt; list.
&gt; 
&gt; what I am wondering is if its possible to use php directly in the password
&gt; file used for htaccess
&gt; so when mod_auth goes to access the flat-file to authenticate the login, it
&gt; really just runs the php which will open the db, get the valid users (and
&gt; shadow passwords) and return the results
&gt; 
&gt; anyone know if this would be possible? or have any similar suggestions

I've implemeted a scheme where a cron job nightly extacts users/passwords from 
an htpassword file and placed them into another file referenced by .htaccess

The reason I didn't reference the htpassword file direct is because I was 
implmenting a poor man's ACL list that way, and the htpassword file was 
organisation-wide.

I don't see any reson why a similar scheme of extracting usernames and 
htpassword-encoded passwords from an SQL database, using php from a cron job, 
and using that output from .htaccess wouldn't work.

Of course there is a delay if a password changes (up to a day), but we live with 
that.  You could run the php script manually on password change anyway if you 
needed the results to be immediate.

HTH,

Michael...
