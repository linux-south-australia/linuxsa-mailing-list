&gt; Daniel,

&gt; I did year 12, with reasonable results, and went on to TAFE.  Back when I
&gt; did it, the TAFE course was an excellent general introduction to IT.  Its
&gt; more practical than Uni courses, which means that you won't necessarily
&gt; understand the deep theory behind stuff, but you'll know how to make it work
&gt; (which is more important anyway).  

Well, its all just 0's and 1's, so there can't be much deep theory, eh :-)

However, knowing how to make it work is not always better than knowing 
things to a deeper level. You will always be able to debug things quicker 
if you know more about how things work.

&gt; The TAFE course structure can be confusing, but they made it all pretty
&gt; clear to me at the information session I went to before I started.  There's
&gt; probably info sessions happening very soon for the mid year enrolments, so
&gt; its probably worth getting hold of TAFE and getting the details if that's
&gt; the way you're leaning.  The course structure has changed a lot since I did
&gt; it (I finished 5 years ago now), but the graduates of the new course are
&gt; still well trained.
&gt; 
&gt; While at TAFE, see if you can find some Open Source projects to become
&gt; involved in.  Even if you're not a programmer type, try writing
&gt; documentation, acting as a tester, spend time in mailing lists doing
&gt; support, that sort of thing.  This does a few things for you... 1) It gives
&gt; you some "experience" you can put on your resume, 2) it gets your name known
&gt; in the community, which might help you get a job, and 3) it gives you some
&gt; experience dealing with users, programmers, etc which will give you an idea
&gt; of what to expect in the "real world", and 4) it gives you knowledge of some
&gt; tools, techniques, etc which you might not otherwise be taught at TAFE.

This is a good recommendation :-)
