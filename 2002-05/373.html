Hi,
Smoothwall GPL has served people well, & over time Richard, the lead
developer, has probably seen GPL no-longer suits his business model,
although this was probably not his intention when he started the
project.

Smoothwall GPL speed still out-performs IPCop, so I continue to use
SmoothWall.
However, I look forward to changing to IPCop when its better so I can
post to the ListServ & not get abused.

Unfortunately the arrogance of Richard, is now legendary.
I just hope David Lloyd doesn't use Richard as a role model!!!

I received an nasty email from Richard this morning, saying:
"Ummm why are you filching free support when you should be using
Corpserv?"
This comment was completely out-of-the-blue & GPL *is* the best
solution for me in the case in question.

I'm guessing Richard is getting a bit frustrated that users are trying
to extend GPL where his CorpServ product would be better suited, but
sorry, the fellow really needs to learn some people skills.

There is an excellent Netiquitte manual he can read at:

&gt;GPL or no, the attitude of the lead developer will eventually kill the
&gt;project IMHO.
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't do another Smoothwall install. period. I promote IPCop as a
&gt;worthwile and active alternative. So does just about anyone else I have
&gt;come across that used to run/install SW.
&gt;
&gt;Interestingly, the IPCop team have a big handicap: Ex-Smoothwall users
&gt;wishing to vent their ire over the smoothwall support! (or abuse!)
&gt;
