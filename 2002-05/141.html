Hiya Sam,

&gt; I'm also looking at getting a similar beast to replace my desktop machine
&gt; (putting Linux as well as XP on it). Laptops nowadays are powerful enough
&gt; for anything you can throw at them including games (especially now with the
&gt; GF4). Good luck getting everything working with Linux. Let us know how you
&gt; get on.

Being somewhat of a tech junkie and game player, I would have to say
that a notebook does have its purpose. If you're a traveler, it's
perfect.

But as really as a desktop replacement it's going to cost around 2x-3x
of a similar desktop and it excludes major upgrades in the future. With
the kind of games coming out this year, a GeForce 4 MX will not provide
the kind of features necessary for Doom III and the like.

Currently now a high-end desktop replacement notebook costs around
$5000-$8000. For that kind of money you could be buying a brand name
server-class dual-CPU 2Ghz+ Pentium 4 Xeon or Athlon MP, 1Gb+ RAM, a lot
of hard drive room, and room for more expansion. A full GeForce 4 Ti
would easily outclass the GeForce 4 Go by a large margin in higher
resolutions, since the notebook variety is a GeForce 4 MX.

Again, I don't know if you require a full desktop on the go.. if you do
then a laptop would be perfect.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; 
&gt; I have come across a number of howtos on getting Debian set up on a Dell
&gt; laptop. One is located at <A HREF="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid">http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid</A>=5656.
&gt; There should be others around as well. They don't tell you everything you
&gt; want to know but it would be a good start.
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck,
