Thanks for all your responses, they have been quite helpful (before this
I had an idea of what I wanted to do, but not how to get there). I knew
I wanted to go to TAFE but had quite a bit of worrying that it would not
get me as far as UNI would.

Some replies to some replies:

&gt; While at TAFE, see if you can find some Open Source projects to become
&gt; involved in. Even if you're not a programmer type, try writing
&gt; documentation, acting as a tester, spend some time in mailing lists
&gt; doing support, that sort of thing.

I am not the programmer type yet (still learning, can write basic
programs but never got past the tutorial introduction programming
stage.. I keep a kind of journal of everything I do to my linux box
(mainly because I was forgetting how I did some things, and having to
learn it all over again) and recently started compiling this into more
readable guides. I haven't done much in the way of testing, but have
talked to developers on IRC while trying to get apt-proxy working, and
uncovered a few bugs (I guess this counts in a way).

&gt; &gt; Forget crap like MCSE's and CCNA'a. Learn the principles first. The
&gt; &gt; principles are taught at universities.
&gt;
&gt; That's not necessarily true. These days, if you put your mind to it
&gt; you could do a university degree just be constantly reading and
&gt; learning from the millions of resources available on the Internet.
&gt; It's all the same, just not "recognized" as a certification.

I agree, I have learned a ton of stuff from the Internet, and still have
a long list of resources in the "to-read" pile. I have taught myself
just about everything I know (about computers) from the Internet, all
school ever did for me was give me a chance to show my skills in Visual
Basic.. (I got an A+ that term, even though I think VB is one of the
ugliest languages I have ever used..)

&gt; When you say network administrator, do you mean
&gt; switching/routing/comms, or do you mean a more generic rold
&gt; administrating servers and making sure that an organisations IT stuff
&gt; works?
&gt;
&gt; If it's the latter then there are lots of good people out there who
&gt; have simply completed TAFE course to become formally qualified in what
&gt; they already know from years of tinkering.
&gt;
&gt; Either way, the best network administrator tends to be someone who is
&gt; enthusiastic wants to be there, and shows some intuition and lateral
&gt; thinking.

Definately the latter, I think.. Actually, I am not 100% sure on this. I
have set several home networks, my home LAN with a Linux server and
messed around with it, tried to make it secure, etc. and I enjoy this
type of thing.

Earlier, I was thinking of a career in simple computer manufacturing and
repair, this was the type of thing I did in my two seperate weeks work
experience a few years back. I also enjoy this, and feel reasonably
competant.. but I enjoy the network/systems side of things a lot more.

&gt; I agree with the TAFE idea, and if your lucky you may get into a
&gt; trainee-ship, like the two young men I have working here, both were
&gt; doing year 12 the year before starting here. One is finishing cert. #2
&gt; and the other is starting cert. #3, both get a low weekly wage that
&gt; increments every year, but their TAFE fees are taken care of by us
&gt; (the employer) and they get paid to study, rather than paying us to
&gt; study.

Wow this sounds great, if I could get myself into such a situation I
would I would be loving it.

&gt; &gt; Get an MCSE and bluff your way into a high paying job...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; DSL
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [yes, I'm being absolutely and horridly serious]
&gt;
&gt; Sad really................
&gt; The poor guy would want to enjoy his job, the only thing he'd enjoy
&gt; about the "MCSE high paying job" would be the pay cheque, work would
&gt; suck majorly....
&gt;
&gt; My advice would be, if you enjoy *nix, stick with it and learn enough
&gt; of MS to be able to find your way around it etc, don't make a career
&gt; out of it...... (Alongside that, don't become a *nix bigot who's
&gt; hardly touched a MS system in their life yet swear that MS is **** and
&gt; *nix is the only solution to the world's problems ;) I may sound like
&gt; I'm contradicting myself, but this is the real world, and in most
&gt; cases it is a MS world, facts suck I know...........

I know many companies only see MS as a serious solution, and so I think
that an MCSE would definatly be a good thing to get (if only to impress
employers). I have no problem with Windows, I use WinXP on my main
desktop (dual booted with Debian, but XP is what I use mostly.. although
my serious work is done over SSH on my other debian box). All help I
have given friends (and friends of friends) has been involving Windows,
so my knowledge and experience of both OS's I think is a good thing.

So.. now that I have more of an idea about this, I think the best option
for me will be TAFE (although I'm not actually sure which course will
help me.. my friend is doing a course but learning a ton of electronic
componetry stuff (which I can understand but is definately not what I
want to be doing for a living ) and a little bit of computer stuff (they
actually learned *how to install* redhat linux (!)) I definately will be
looking into the other courses such as MCSE CCNA etc, and will of course
keep up the Internet reading, as that is what has taught me the most and
probably will always remain so. Thanks everybody.

Regards,
Daniel Mundy
