Hi all,

I have done quite a few laptop installs over a few years, but I am having 
troubles today and not getting any progress happening. Any advice welcome.

System: 
- Toshiba satellite pro 1550 CDS, Mandrake 8.2, with boot floppy and 4 CDs.

Problems: 
- partitioning existing drive. 4Gb drive with windows 98. This is a very new 
drive in a two+ year old laptop, drive recently went belly up and was 
replaced. Defrag has been done to move all windows content down one end. 
Tried fips.exe to split the drive into two x 2Gb partitions. Fips reads the 
drive, reports the stats, then barfs with an error that the disk geometry 
reported does not match the physical geometry found, difference of four 
sectors reported.

- also tried booting to the install image to use the partitioning tools there, 
system hangs at detecting IDE devices, looking for PCMCIA devices. Total 
system freeze at this point, no keyboard response, no mouse response, 
requires forced reset to recover.

Has anyone else had similar and can shed light? This is my daughter's laptop, 
she uses the windows stuff for school, and is now suffering linux withdrawal 
symptoms.

TIA

Bruce
