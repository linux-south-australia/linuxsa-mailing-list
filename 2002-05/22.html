When I used to work as a tech for a hardware company, we were told that
it meant the hard drive, and we could sell a hard disk and an OEM
windows together legally. However, Im not a lawyer and Its kinda
irrelevant to me :)

&gt; Hmm,
&gt; Does kind of beg the question:
&gt; 
&gt; What exactly defines the "hardware" as THE hardware?
&gt; 
&gt; The CPU?  
&gt; The Harddisk?
&gt; The motherboard?
&gt; The case?
&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean if I upgrade the CPU I'm no longer licensed?  If I use the 
&gt; CPU in another machine is it licensed or not?
&gt; 
&gt; What if I change the MB or Harddisk?  Heck, what if I change the case that 
&gt; the little evil "windows license tag" is attached to?
&gt; 
&gt; What if in fact I install a second harddrive and put linux on that?  
&gt; 
&gt; What if I attach a case badge that says "Linux Inside"?  The hardware 
&gt; changes, is that an issue????
&gt; 
&gt; If I buy a computer without a license (a Naked PC Rated R) and then glue the 
&gt; P133 from a machine that was licensed for Windows onto the top of the case, 
&gt; is it licensed?  Or is it now just a hedgehog?
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I think Microsoft owe me.  I had countless days of my life 
&gt; wasted by their crap (not as many days as some poor people, but enough
&gt; all the same).

&gt; &gt; I think you'll find what that is supposed to mean is that if you buy a PC with Windowz then the licence for Windowz must stay with the PC for life ie it cannot be transfered to another machine(s). I beleive they are saying this in the context that a donated PC should have a Windows licence as the pc was most likely sold with Windows. This doesnt mean you cant wipe the PCs and put Linux on - you'd just have a windows licence attatched to that PC which was not being used and could not be transfered.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If a PC shipped with Windows preinstalled, can you remove the OS and install 
&gt; &gt; Linux instead? Well, no, according to Microsoft. A somewhat obscure Microsoft 
&gt; &gt; site aimed at helping schools deal with donated computers flatly states: "It 
&gt; &gt; is a legal requirement that pre-installed operating systems remain with a 
&gt; &gt; machine for the life of the machine." 
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the implications of this are, well, scary!
&gt; &gt; if anyone can't get the rest of the article, let me know, i'll post it...
