&gt; Can anyone tell me if they know of any differneces between the way amanda
&gt; does backups for tar based backups and dump based backups.

One uses tar and the other uses dump [this isn't being facetious but
that actually _is_ the difference]; at the end of the day amanda simply
pipes data at a program as though it were coming in via standard input.

&gt; If I revert that disk to root-tar in the disklist it all runs fine again.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW when I say runs fine or doesnt run fine above I mean amcheck
&gt; &lt;configuration&gt; runs fine or not, NOT the actaul dumps ruin fine or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestons would be very wlecome, I'm afraid Im rather stumped.

Amanda is particularly cantankerous but one gets used to it.

Have you tried:

1) logging in as the amanda user
2) running dump

In addition, what does /tmp/amanda/* say? I would do an ls -alt and take
a look at the newest ones after running amcheck and/or amdump.

Also older versions of dump and tar should be avoided like the plague.
Problems with older versions of both programs could cause the symptoms
you're seeing.
 
&gt; The amanda user is in a group which has full read/write access to the
&gt; directroy in question and also the amanda user is ameber of the disk
&gt; group.

You should probably also check whether the operating system has managed
to clobber one of the setuid programs that amanda uses. I distinctly
remember setting up amanda on an older RedHat 6.2 system where the
sticky bits wouldn't stick...

Don't forget to check the amanda mailing list archives (which can be
found following links from <A HREF="http://www.amanda.org/">http://www.amanda.org/</A>); if you do subscribe
to the list itself you should be aware it's extremely chatty although
user friendly.
