Huh?

&gt; SMH alert does this, so you have to scroll through a page of
&gt; rarely-used stuff to get to the good stuff, its a PITA & have told them
&gt; so.
&gt;
&gt; It is not acceptable that many people will be disadvantaged purely
&gt; because a few folks are too lazy/ignorant/sloppy to *read*.
&gt;
&gt; Just like a technical report which has an appendix, it can be referred
&gt; to, if necessary.
&gt;
&gt; Reading *comprehension* seems to be spiralling downward, perhaps its
&gt; because the Aussie Education budget is poor & targeting fee-paying
&gt; overseas students.
&gt;
&gt; We need more $ on education, encourage skilled Asian immigrants who
&gt; want to make babies with Aussies. Solve a lot of problems...

&gt;&gt; I've often wondered why the Linux SA group hasn't done what hundreds of
&gt;&gt; other mailing lists do and that is put the unsubscribe instructions at the
&gt;&gt; top of the body of the mail message rather than at the bottom.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This would then fix your continued gripe about people being unable to read
&gt;&gt; the bottom of the mail message.

The real problem I see is that so many people put so much mess in
their mail messages, and sequence it so badly, that people don't
bother reading to the end.  There should be a message there.  Take
this one, for example.  mutt tells me that it was 51 lines, including
the unsubscribe info.  I'd have found it a lot more intelligible if it
were written like this:

That's only 36 lines, and it also makes it clear what you're talking
about.  At the end, you're at the bottom of the page, where you should
be.
