&gt; I am hoping to work towards a career as a network administrator (or

When you say network administrator, do you mean switching/routing/comms,
or do you mean a more generic role administrating servers and making
sure that an organisations IT stuff works?

If it's the former, at least some University education will be useful to
you. The subject matter of a degree might not be relevant to your career
path, but the university experience will fine-tune your problem solving
skills.

If it's the latter then there are lots of good people out there who have
simply completed Tafe course to become formally qualified in what they
already know from years of tinkering.

Either way, the best network administrator tends to be someone who is
enthusiastic wants to be there, and shows some intuition and lateral
thinking.
