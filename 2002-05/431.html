Out of interest, you can turn off the Sending of OOOs to the internet in
exchange server (which most of the people on the M$ list would be using i'd
be guessing)....
i've got a rule that deletes OOOs that seems to work most times....


&gt;Does a simple thing like that show anything about difference in quality
&gt;of service, or quality of software between the NT and Linux platforms?
&gt;Simply that the people on the NT list are limited by their own
&gt;brains to
&gt;not set up auto-responders correctly, or is it that they simply can't
&gt;customize it, because they're using a crappy piece of software?  And if
&gt;that were the case, wouldn't they think about it an unsubscribe?  It
&gt;drives me insane, it really does.

Crappy piece of software is the correct assumption.

I'm using Outlook 2000 (at work), and have just checked out the out of
office
setup.  When you turn it on,it will reply to each and every email that
arrives
in your inbox.  You can also apply rules (filters) to the incoming mail but
there
doesn't appear to be any way to selectively reply to incoming mail with the
out of office "assistant" [1]

(personally i've never used it (out of office), I'm surprised there are
sysadmins
who use it too, normally I prefer ppl not to know when I'll be back in the
office ;)


[1] Possibly you may be able to configure it more at the server side, like
most of the
nicer Exchange functions, rules/filters are like that too, you can have
client-side
and/or server-side rules
