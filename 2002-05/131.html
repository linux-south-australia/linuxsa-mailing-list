Hi,

I am buying the ultimate (well ultimate for 6 months anyhow) geek toy -
a new laptop - and I want to run the ultimate geek OS - Linux!!!

Dell are now giving me a $200 discount for a hardware only laptop (in
Micro$oft Lingo (TM) - 'Naked PC') so I am happy - so I am getting the
internal TrueMobile wireless LAN card - what is this useful?  I have
heard it is only good for a very short range and is easily obstructed by
walls and furniture!  I know of one guy who has a wireless router in his
house to cope with this short range.

I am also getting the UXGA screen and Nvidia GeForce 4 Go (should be no
challenge to get going)

The Lucent internal modem / ethernet combo (should also work) 

Silicon Labs (Cyrus Logic?) sound chip (can't remember chipset ID) - not
sure if this will work even though it is listed as SB compatible

DVD ROM drive / CD burner combination drive (this is my main concern for
Linux) - no idea of hardware make / model yet.

Second battery (will power management work in Linux?)

Firewire port (will this work?)

Infrared port (will this work?)

SPDIF output on sound card (will this give at least 5.1 surround sound
with the appropriate equipment under M$ if not Linux?)

Super Video / Video output (will this work in Linux?)

If anyone can help with compatibility information on the above I will be
very happy.  I have already chased this up with the Dell Linux
discussion group and others.  Because this is new hardware - many people
are not able to offer advice from experience.  So even presumptions are
welcome!

Thanks!
