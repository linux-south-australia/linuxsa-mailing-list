[Standard Disclaimer - Sorry about the embedded html]

Daryl,

I am not talking about pages of crap.

I am talking about one line with a link to unsubscribe at the top of the
mail message.

As for reading, I, like thousands of other Australians, am suffering from
information overload.

I do not have the time to read all the details at the bottom of an email
which includes a person's personal signature (yes I noticed yours too
Daryl), the standard disclaimer on confidentiality, half a dozen ads, some
garbage about all the different parent companies who bought you this
wonderful stuff, and please visit our sponsors at sites abc, def, xyz, etc.

I would welcome to see unsubscribe info in one line at the top of a mail
message, so I don't have to wade through all the crap at the end to get at
the unsubscribe instructions - which often aren't at the exact end of the
message but somewhere among the crap at the end of the message, in the hope
you wont find it and wont unsubscribe from this site - which of course does
not support spam.

I am talking standards, I am talking commonsense, I am talking, I am
talking, I am talking - someone please turn off the tape recording, leave
out the gratuitous garbage at the end of the message, and simplify how to
unsubscribe please, so David has one less gripe for his day.

Regards,
Desiree M. de Fluiter
