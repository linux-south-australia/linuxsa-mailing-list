&gt; I agree, I'd also rather support a company that officially supports Linux and

&gt; interested. 

Is it possible that Sony are only using 'the current perceived rage' 
(ie: Linux) to further their 'grand scheme' and market penetration? And 
then ultimately not honour the 'Linux spirit', by not allowing any 
useful development for PS2 Linux? That is, using it as just a marketing 
ploy with no real delivery. Ultimately, OSS games on Linux would 
potentially impair the market for commercial DMCA copy protected 
software. Is it possible to have both an open platform run in a useful 
manner on the PS2 (or Xbox etc...) AND control the market and restrict 
copying and piracy?

Just a few thoughts.

Dale.

&gt; PS. When I first brought up the subject of Linux on Playstation someone brought
&gt; up this interesting idea!

&gt; I agree,
&gt; 
&gt;     I'd prefer to pay Sony, for the PS/2 who are prepared to officially 
&gt; support linux than Microsoft for another xbox to support their sales. ie 
&gt; Every sale to one side, is one less for the other.
&gt; Why else do you think their prepared to support a loss?
&gt; 
&gt; For someone who is into games and has a P/S already the $499 AU is a 
&gt; fairly cheap way of getting a  reasonable starting computer, the fact 
&gt; that they then start with linux, instead of having to be enlightened 
&gt; (substitute any other suitable word ),  is a major bonus in favour of this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What's more interesting are some of the mod chips coming out for the
&gt;&gt;&gt;microsoft Xbox. It already has hard drive and Ethernet for something
&gt;&gt;&gt;like $399, and one of the xbox hacker groups has discovered a backdoor
&gt;&gt;&gt;bios hook to allow it to load arbitrary x86 code.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;In English, that means there's a strong possibility that it will be able
&gt;&gt;&gt;to run Linux, despite all the crypto requirements for booting the OS.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hmm. Paying microsoft for hardware to run linux on? Even if it does save
&gt;&gt;you money Im not sure if I like that idea :(
