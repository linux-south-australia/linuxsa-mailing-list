	[Standard Disclaimer: Sorry about the HTML embedding] 

	Thanks for reply Dan. 

	Sorry about the missing bit - try number 2:

	The error with the NT 4.0 problem is that user's passwords and
userlogons were not being recognised when the day before or the hour before,
etc., they were being recognised.  The Workstation keeps saying that the
password or userlogon were invalid or does not exist or a combination of
these depending on what mood it was in but more often than not it says the
password was not valid and this did not make sense as the user had logged in
previously with the same username and password.

	As for the Windows 2000 problem, I found out that from at least
2.2.1a onwards, if you are not using windbind, you should set "nt acl
support" to "no" and this should fix the problem.  We have tried this and so
far so good....

	Addendum to the Windows 2000 fix:  You cannot use the cacls command
from the dos prompt on the workstation to alter the permissions on the
unix/linux files and you can no longer see the permissions tab when looking
at the file via the Windows Properties screen.

	Regards, 
	Dez
