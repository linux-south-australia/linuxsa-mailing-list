&gt; University is not primarily about learning facts, but about learning how
&gt; to think.

However, I'm not entirely certain that the pressure under university
funding these days allows them to do this.

&gt; A University degree (arts, maths, engineering, whatever) is about learning
&gt; the skills of thinking.  Taking a problem, breaking it down, analyzing it,
&gt; understanding it, learning about it etc.  Sure, if you do a Maths degree you
&gt; become better at understanding maths problems and if you do an arts degree
&gt; you become better at analyzing literature etc.

Actually, the guy could take a degree in anything he wants althgough I'd
tend to say that a degree in science, mathematics or psychology might be
more useful.

&gt; Facts come and go.  Thinking is still the most important thing.

Yes.
