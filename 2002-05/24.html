(not having a go Ant, just taking this to it's next logical step ..)

So, if it's linked to the HD, then why can I buy HDs without a windows tax?
Heck, blank tapes and CDs come with a pirating tax, why not HDs?
Why don't they stick the windows license on the HD and on the case?

I can only assume that since most PCs come with the license number on the 
case that in fact it's merely sheetmetal that's licensed.

In which case watchout when you sell your filing cabinet without it's proper 
licensing details ...

channel my anger).

&gt; &gt; Hmm,
&gt; &gt; Does kind of beg the question:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What exactly defines the "hardware" as THE hardware?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The CPU?  
&gt; &gt; The Harddisk?
&gt; &gt; The motherboard?
&gt; &gt; The case?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does this mean if I upgrade the CPU I'm no longer licensed?  If I use the 
&gt; &gt; CPU in another machine is it licensed or not?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What if I change the MB or Harddisk?  Heck, what if I change the case that 
&gt; &gt; the little evil "windows license tag" is attached to?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What if in fact I install a second harddrive and put linux on that?  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What if I attach a case badge that says "Linux Inside"?  The hardware 
&gt; &gt; changes, is that an issue????
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I buy a computer without a license (a Naked PC Rated R) and then glue the 
&gt; &gt; P133 from a machine that was licensed for Windows onto the top of the case, 
&gt; &gt; is it licensed?  Or is it now just a hedgehog?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally, I think Microsoft owe me.  I had countless days of my life 
&gt; &gt; wasted by their crap (not as many days as some poor people, but enough
&gt; &gt; all the same).

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you'll find what that is supposed to mean is that if you buy a PC with Windowz then the licence for Windowz must stay with the PC for life ie it cannot be transfered to another machine(s). I beleive they are saying this in the context that a donated PC should have a Windows licence as the pc was most likely sold with Windows. This doesnt mean you cant wipe the PCs and put Linux on - you'd just have a windows licence attatched to that PC which was not being used and could not be transfered.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If a PC shipped with Windows preinstalled, can you remove the OS and install 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Linux instead? Well, no, according to Microsoft. A somewhat obscure Microsoft 
&gt; &gt; &gt; site aimed at helping schools deal with donated computers flatly states: "It 
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a legal requirement that pre-installed operating systems remain with a 
&gt; &gt; &gt; machine for the life of the machine." 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the implications of this are, well, scary!
&gt; &gt; &gt; if anyone can't get the rest of the article, let me know, i'll post it...
