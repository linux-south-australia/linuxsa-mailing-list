James,

I was involved with a site of 500+ users having slow network response with
Windows 2000 clients and an NT server.  I spent a good week there to
analyse with a packet sniffer what was happening.  After some investigation
on th client side, it was found that the "My Network Places" was being used
with a whole bunch of short cuts.
This compared with two other possible ways to use the network gave some
very interesting results. Network Neighbourhood or mapped drives.
Mapped drives were the fastest. (Even faster if you turn off that View as
Web page crap ie half the amount of data is transfered)
Network Neighbourhood was slower by about half.
My network Places short cuts where about 10-20 times slower!!!!!
Transfering on average 10 times as much traffic.

We (CSC) raised a case with Microsoft and found out that it had been
reported to them by companies like DuPont (read 20,000 desktops with the
problem) and still M$ wasn't going to fix it.

So Windows2000 has issues with browsing the network full stop if using the
new My Network Places. The advice from the M$ engineer was to upgrade to
XP.

Make sure other things that cause delays like name resolution are working
well too.

So we had a consultant come in and he did exactly as I had predicted.

The consultant was called in mainly because we are using an old server and
people are blaming the workstations for it.

Although we have a Super Micro Server with dual PIII 850 megahertz
processors and 30 gigabytes HD. It runs Mandrake 8.2 Samba 2.2.3, our
consultant suggested that we but a $4,500 snap box. Our old server, the
Novell 4.11 server, is a HP Netserver E45  - 233 megahertz.

Most of the workstations are running PIII's ranging from 500 - 800
megahertz. They are all having problems browsing the network, only when we
save files, not when they click on my computer.

The consultant said that we would be much happier if we got new PIV 1.4
Gigahertz workstations running cloned Windows 98 drives at each
workstation.
That's another $6,300.

All of these costs plus his labor, just so Caseview/Caseware will run
faster.   However, I already showed my boss that it takes one third of the
time to use Caseware when we run it off of the Samba server.

Any opinions?

Can anyone help me stop the twenty second delay that pops up when we try to
save files in Windows 2000?

Help!

James Leone

Subject: Samba delay in Netware network


&gt; My boss had a consultant come in and he says that if I use guest accounts
in
&gt; Samba, Windows will delay being able to browse the network shares each
time
&gt; we save.
&gt;
&gt; I want to know if this is true.
&gt;
&gt; If it is not could anyone let me know how to fix it. Our use of Samba may
be
&gt; threatened.
&gt;
&gt; Also, Richard, do you think you could ever come in to our Office in Palo
&gt; Alto to help out?
&gt;
&gt; What are your rates?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; James Leone
