Daniel,

I did year 12, with reasonable results, and went on to TAFE.  Back when I
did it, the TAFE course was an excellent general introduction to IT.  Its
more practical than Uni courses, which means that you won't necessarily
understand the deep theory behind stuff, but you'll know how to make it work
(which is more important anyway).  

The TAFE course structure can be confusing, but they made it all pretty
clear to me at the information session I went to before I started.  There's
probably info sessions happening very soon for the mid year enrolments, so
its probably worth getting hold of TAFE and getting the details if that's
the way you're leaning.  The course structure has changed a lot since I did
it (I finished 5 years ago now), but the graduates of the new course are
still well trained.

While at TAFE, see if you can find some Open Source projects to become
involved in.  Even if you're not a programmer type, try writing
documentation, acting as a tester, spend time in mailing lists doing
support, that sort of thing.  This does a few things for you... 1) It gives
you some "experience" you can put on your resume, 2) it gets your name known
in the community, which might help you get a job, and 3) it gives you some
experience dealing with users, programmers, etc which will give you an idea
of what to expect in the "real world", and 4) it gives you knowledge of some
tools, techniques, etc which you might not otherwise be taught at TAFE.

After TAFE, look for a job as a Help Desk/Support person, as most companies
wouldn't let a new graduate play with their servers/network straight off.
If you do this in a small company (like I did) you'll pretty soon be
involved in network administration, and just about everything else anyway.
If you're hired by a bigger company, spend some time there, get some
experience under your belt and then look to move into your chosen field.

Once you've got some generalised training and experience, you might want to
then look at some more specific training through one of the private training
providers (such as Dimension Data (formerly ComTech)), its expensive but can
be useful to fill in the gaps in your knowledge (and if you're lucky your
employer might pay for it too).  In my experience you'll get more out of
this sort of training once you've had some exposure in the area they're
training you in.  At this stage you might also want to look at some of the
industry certifications such as RHCE, or MCSE, CNE, etc.  In real terms they
might not mean much, but they look good on your resume (i.e.. HR types go
"Gee Whiz" over them, real IT people ignore them), and might make that move
up to Network Administration a little easier.

Hope that helps.

Jim.

Subject: Seeking advice about employment paths


Hi,

I am hoping to work towards a career as a network administrator (or
some other job in a similar area), and was wondering what exactly I need
in order to get the qualifications I would need. I am very interested in
Linux and networking, setting up systems and trying to make them run the
best I can. I also enjoy learning programming languages.

I am doing year 13 so that I can get my SACE certificate, but
unfortunately have not chosen the right subjects to actually get a TER
that I need to get into Uni. I was thinking maybe of doing some courses
in TAFE.

What I was hoping is for advice by people involved in this area of
employment as to what courses I should be looking at, and really any
useful information you may have.

Thank you very much for this, I really appreciate it.

Regards,
Daniel Mundy
