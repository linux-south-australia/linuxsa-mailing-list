&gt; Can anyone tell me if they know of any differneces between the way amanda

&gt; 
&gt; I had a test config I was using and it was all fine and dandy while I used
&gt; tar based backups (FYI root-tar backups) from the standard
&gt; amanda.conf file - the only change was a change in the global section
&gt; which  specifed an excludes-file.

I'm afraid I can't help, but what I would like to learn more about is
where comp-user should be used. So far I've only found a few reasons
(funny platform without gtar, academic interest or really slow hardware)
where dump/comp-user makes sense? I haven't much experience with Amanda at
all, but the bit I have done taught me not to rely on any form of dump
except for ext2fs (there is xfsdump, but you have to jiggle things,
nothing for reiserfs.) Two useful features GNU tar has are
--atime-preserve (once upon a time GNU tar modified the atime, oops) and
--listed-incremental. I am sure the ext2-specific dump has to be faster,
but I haven't seen the speed difference matter. Maybe I just don't back up
real amounts of data :-)

Can anyone enlighten me about when to use which?
