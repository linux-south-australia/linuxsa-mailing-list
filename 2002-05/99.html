&gt;&gt; I reckon the consultant:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a) has no idea about Samba
&gt;&gt; b) gets paid commission from Microsoft for selling Microsoft products
&gt;
&gt;We don't know. He may just be miss-informed.

Sorry if I step on anyone toes but I generally find that Dogbert summed up
consultants just nicely...

"They like to CON people and inSULT people that is why they are
CONSULTANTS" ?:)

There was an interesting post just recently on this list which suggested
that to persuade managers one needs to highlight a problem and offer an
instant solution for $0.

So run your own experiements with the Samba server, prove to yourself that
your idea/prinicple works effectively.   Organise a meeting with your
manager and any other friendly manager or higher boss, demonstrate the
current problem on one machine and then demonstrate the effectiveness of
changing to samba on another machine.  Then make the statement "we have
this already and the changes can be implemented over the next couple of
days solving our problem for minimal costs".

You might find it easier to convince your manager under this situation than
any other.

I have found from past experience you can berate a manager over the
technical merits of linux and samba until the cows come home, they wont
listen until it is demonstrated in front of them and their bosses.   Says
he with a Bootleg samba server running a PDC /intranet webserver and MP3
share (*ROFL*).

Regards

Matthew.
