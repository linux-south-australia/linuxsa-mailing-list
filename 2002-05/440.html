&gt; ** ALERNATIVE ENDING **
&gt; 
&gt; - People who admin Unix and NT think they're important and hold the company
&gt;   together but aren't really sure.  They prefer to lunch and goto Seminars 
&gt;   but don't want to admit that to their geeky friends. They tend to randomly
&gt;   ignore emails and answer other ones in a loud fashion after long liquid 
&gt;   lunches.  Really they want to be managers and sign purchase orders.

Thats a bit harsh! I have Unix & Nt machines here. No NT servers though,
they are all linux and there is one hpux server. There are mostly NT
workstations, but some linux. Most admins who are in this situation are
probably there because users know windows, and there are a lot of
problems with lack of apps on linux (although, having said that, I run
linux full time, and rarely have compatability problems these days.)
