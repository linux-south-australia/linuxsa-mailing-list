I haven't had a look at your actual documents yet James, as I've been
fairly busy the last week, but I'll try to have a look soon. :)
Gzipping the documents is fairly easy and straight forward. I just use
a couple of switches to the tar command. For the following, I'll
assume your website directory is in /var/www/html and the html
documents you want to gzip are in /var/www/html/sambaguide. From the
/var/www/html folder:
[<A HREF="mailto:james@server">james@server</A> html]$ tar fcz sambaguide.tar.gz sambaguide
[<A HREF="mailto:james@server">james@server</A> html]$

What those switches do:

'z' tells it to use gzip to compress the tar file.
'c' says to create an archive (as opposed to expand one)
'f' tells it to work with a file (instead of stdin/stdout)
'sambaguide.tar.gz' is the name of the archive to create
'sambaguide' is what you want to include in the archive. Note that you
can also use a list of files to include if you want.
The reason I suggest creating the archive from the parent folder
instead of within the actual sambaguide folder itself is that when
people ungzip it, it will create a folder and put all the documents
into it, instead of just putting them in the current folder. Can you
imagine what would happen if someone ran `tar fxz sambaguide.tar.gz`
from within their /etc folder? (Don't laugh, it happens!). If you do
it the way above, they will end up with a /etc/sambaguide folder with
all the contents in it. Easy to realise and move to where it should
be. If you do it from within the folder, it will put all the .html in
/etc. Pain to work out which files were there beforehand and which
ones are the new ones from the archive!
Anyways, `man tar` should be able to give you the full listing of what
you can do with tar.
Cheers
Darryl
