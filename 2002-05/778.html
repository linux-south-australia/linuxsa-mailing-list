:&gt; So,
:&gt; 
:&gt; If I was to install debian woody once it is released, and decide that I
:&gt; need to upgrade a major piece of it, say KDE, what is involved? Do I
:&gt; have to go off-world (away from debian for those packages)?

well you may if you like but generally you don't need to.

 :&gt;Is that
:&gt; difficult? Or would I likely find them in unstable, and if so, does
:&gt; using unstable somehow muck up the installation?
Nope. But it's no longer the "stable" branch.



You have a few (actually lots of of) options.
1/ You only want to run "KDE" and a few things at cutting edge.
	install from source + deps  (/usr/local)
	install a prebuilt late version .deb(s) using dpkg - i  (which will look after / warn about dependancies for you)
	(/usr/)

2/ add the unstable branch (or even a single package / site) to your /etc/apt/sources.list.

3/ Just run testing which generally is not unstable. i.e. a nice compromise.


:&gt; 
:&gt; Does apt know or care that I have some compiled from source software
:&gt; installed that is a later version than what is offered at debian and may
:&gt; have been installed originally?
Apt does not know (or care) what you do in /usr/local.
Remember apt is a front end to dpkg.

Generally ----
dpkg will try very hard to make sure you don't bugger up stuff under /usr.
the higher / newer you go up the distribution tree the less stable things become. (well I s'pose tht's self evident)
However the hoops you have to go through to even get a package into unstable mean that depend' s / docs etc end up in the correct place. Even things like alternative libraries are catered for.

You can even build your own mirror and or proxy.

You may be as bleeding edge as your last compile or run stable or place yourself somewhere along that line.
If a package is an OFFICIAL DEB it should either go in first time or give you a bloody good reason why not.
(well thats usually the experience)
If you have to upgrade many libraries you may as well run stable or unstable.

Note:
APT doesn't rewrite conf files unless you tell it to or the package maintainer (debian maintainer, not the developer) decides it's high priority. Only trivial stuff gets altered. (and then backed up)

Lot's of people run latest unstable and are perfectly happy.

It's the combination of automation and human touch that makes it work so well not staying behind with old packages.

:&gt; &gt; &gt; So it appears on the surface that debian is miles behind the others
:&gt; &gt; &gt; but the fact is that in debian, official releases don't matter as you
:&gt; &gt; &gt; continuously (or whenever you feel like it) upgrade any packages
:&gt; &gt; &gt; that have new versions ('apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade').
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you get many package updates
:&gt; &gt; between releases. Many bugfixes are back-ported though, and I presume
:&gt; &gt; some features... and some packages are updated with new versions...  but
:&gt; &gt; I haven't seen many...
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; Checking the Developers Reference explains this policy:
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html">http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html</A>#s-upload-stable
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; Specifically:
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; ----
:&gt; &gt; Uploading to stable means that the package will be placed into the
:&gt; &gt; proposed-updates directory of the Debian archive for further testing
:&gt; &gt; before it is actually included in stable.
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; Extra care should be taken when uploading to stable. Basically, a
:&gt; &gt; package should only be uploaded to stable if one of the following
:&gt; &gt; happens:
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt;     * a security problem (e.g. a Debian security advisory)
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt;     * a truely critical functionality problem
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt;     * the package becomes uninstallable
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt;     * a released architecture lacks the package
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; It is discouraged to change anything else in the package that isn't
:&gt; &gt; important, because even trivial fixes can cause bugs later on. Uploading
:&gt; &gt; new upstream versions to fix security problems is deprecated; applying
:&gt; &gt; the specific patch from the new upstream version to the old one
:&gt; &gt; ("backporting" the patch) is the right thing to do in most cases.
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; Packages uploaded to stable need to be compiled on systems running
:&gt; &gt; stable, so that their dependencies are limited to the libraries (and
:&gt; &gt; other packages) available in stable; for example, a package uploaded to
:&gt; &gt; stable that depends on a library package that only exists in unstable
:&gt; &gt; will be rejected. Making changes to dependencies of other packages (by
:&gt; &gt; messing with Provides or shlibs files), possibly making those other
:&gt; &gt; packages uninstallable, is strongly discouraged.
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; The Release Team (which can be reached at
:&gt; &gt; <A HREF="mailto:debian-release@lists.debian.org">debian-release@lists.debian.org</A>) will regularly evaluate the uploads in
:&gt; &gt; proposed-updates and decide if your package can be included in stable.
:&gt; &gt; Please be clear (and verbose, if necessary) in your changelog entries
:&gt; &gt; for uploads to stable, because otherwise the package won't be considered
:&gt; &gt; for inclusion.
:&gt; &gt; -----
:&gt; &gt;
:&gt; &gt; So every Debian distro is a static set of package versions, with ongoing
:&gt; &gt; security updates. FreeBSD does this better IMHO...
