&gt; OPENOFFICE.ORG COMMUNITY ANNOUNCES OPENOFFICE.ORG 1.O: FREE OFFICE
&gt; PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE
&gt;
&gt; Global Community Builds Full-Featured Office Suite With Revolutionary
&gt; Momentum
&gt;
&gt; May 1, 2002 - The OpenOffice.org community (www.openoffice.org) today
&gt; announced the availability of OpenOffice.org 1.0, the open source,
&gt; multi-platform, multi-lingual office productivity suite available as a
&gt; free download at the OpenOffice.org community website. OpenOffice.org
&gt; 1.0 is the culmination of more than 18 months of collaborative effort by
&gt; members of the OpenOffice.org community, which is comprised of Sun
&gt; employees, volunteer developers, marketers, and end users working to
&gt; create an international office suite that will run on all major
&gt; platforms.
&gt;
&gt; OpenOffice.org 1.0, which shares the same code base as Sun's StarOffice
&gt; [tm] 6.0 software is - like StarOffice 6.0 software - a full-featured
&gt; office suite that provides a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft
&gt; Office. OpenOffice.org 1.0 offers software freedom, enabling a free
&gt; market for service and support, while the Sun-branded product,
&gt; StarOffice 6.0 software, offers 24x7 fee-based support and training for
&gt; consumers and businesses, along with deployment and migration services.
&gt; StarOffice software also offers additional features, such as a database,
&gt; special fonts and Sun quality and assurance testing. The two office
&gt; suites complement each other, meeting the varying needs of consumers,
&gt; open source advocates and enterprise customers.
&gt;
&gt; "OpenOffice.org 1.0 may be the single best hope for consumers fed-up
&gt; with Microsoft's desktop monopoly," said Eric Raymond, co-founder of the
&gt; Open Source Initiative (OSI). "With Sun moving to a full service and
&gt; support business model for StarOffice software, users around the globe
&gt; will continue to have a free office productivity software tool through
&gt; the OpenOffice.org open source community."
&gt;
&gt; The OpenOffice.org 1.0 office suite features key desktop applications -
&gt; including word processor, spreadsheet, presentation and drawing
&gt; programs - in more than 25 languages. In addition, OpenOffice.org 1.0
&gt; works transparently with a variety of file formats, enabling users
&gt; familiar with other office suites, such as Microsoft Office and
&gt; StarOffice software, to work seamlessly in the application. The
&gt; OpenOffice.org 1.0 software runs stably and natively on multiple
&gt; platforms, including Linux, PPC Linux, Solaris [tm], Windows and many
&gt; other flavors of Unix.
&gt;
&gt; OpenOffice.org is the largest open source project with more than 7.5
&gt; million lines of code. To date, more than 4.5 million downloads of
&gt; earlier versions of OpenOffice.org 1.0 have taken place. With the
&gt; release of the 1.0 version, the OpenOffice.org community expects that
&gt; number to grow significantly as businesses and individuals around the
&gt; world explore the free alternative to proprietary office suites.
&gt; The OpenOffice.org Community
&gt; In less than two years, the OpenOffice.org community has grown to more
&gt; than 10,000 volunteers, working together to build the leading
&gt; international office suite that will run on all major platforms and
&gt; provide access to all functionality and data through open-component
&gt; based APIs and an XML-based file format. Sun initiated this effort by
&gt; donating the StarOffice software source code and engineering to the
&gt; OpenOffice.org community. One of the major benefits of community-based
&gt; development is peer review, which has resulted in a stable, secure and
&gt; flexible software package.
&gt;
&gt; Participants in the Community work on projects ranging from code
&gt; development to porting and localization, to bug reporting,
&gt; documentation, product marketing, local language sites and mirror
&gt; sites for software download.
&gt; "There are many important roles that volunteer developers can play to
&gt; shape the future functionality of OpenOffice.org (OOo) so if you are
&gt; looking for someplace to contribute, OOo can use you," said Kevin
&gt; Hendricks, a key contributor to the OpenOffice.org community since its
&gt; inception nearly two years ago. Hendricks has lead volunteer development
&gt; teams for both the OpenOffice.org 1.0 spellchecker and PPC Linux port
&gt; projects.
&gt;
&gt; "When OpenOffice.org was released, it was a tremendous amount of code
&gt; with a very deep history, and thus we knew it would take a lot of time
&gt; and effort to reach a critical mass of community participation," said
&gt; Brian Behlendorf, CTO and co-founder, CollabNet. "The project has now
&gt; attracted a significant amount of outside involvement, some of it in
&gt; pretty interesting areas like marketing and quality assurance. With the
&gt; release of 1.0, it's clear those efforts are bearing real fruit.
&gt; Congratulations to the community -- and to Sun -- for making this
&gt; happen."
&gt;
&gt; CollabNet's SourceCast application enables both centralized and
&gt; geographically distributed software development teams to collaborate on
&gt; OpenOffice.org projects and to track them accurately. SourceCast is the
&gt; premier Web-based collaboration environment, which includes an
&gt; integrated set of software development applications. CollabNet also
&gt; provides strategic advice on open source issues and the growth of
&gt; OpenOffice.org, and offers analysis on current trends within the
&gt; community.
&gt;
&gt; "OpenOffice.org may be the most important open source project right
&gt; now," said Miguel de Icaza, founder of the GNOME project. "Because
&gt; people will try it and see they can get everyday work done without
&gt; giving more money to Microsoft, they'll see -- in a low-risk way -- that
&gt; open source software can work for them and be an even better solution."
&gt;
&gt; About OpenOffice.org
&gt; OpenOffice.org is the home of the open source project and its community

&gt; OS X are in various stages of completion by developers and end-users in
&gt; the OpenOffice.org community. OpenOffice.org 1.0 is written in C++ and
&gt; has documented API's licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
&gt; License (LGPL) and Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL) open
