Deiter,

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I've done some rough calculations and it looks like we need 
&gt; 40 Gb or so of RAID to store volatile images until they are 
&gt; safely written to backup, maybe 200 Gb or so of flat storage 
&gt; to cache recently accessed images, and some 0.5 to 1.0 Tb of 
&gt; "random access" backup storage.  I was thinking in terms of a 
&gt; CD Jukebox with a DVD-R drive, maybe with a drive upgrade in 
&gt; a few years time to increase capacity.

For the hardware, you may wish to consider hardware IDE RAID to SCSI
devices... They look like a normal SCSI drive to the computer, but
actually consist of a collection of IDE drives set up transparently as a
RAID -- there is no driver or special software needed at all, just a
SCSI interface.

eg, this one <A HREF="http://www.positiveesolutions.com/Araid/12000/index.html">http://www.positiveesolutions.com/Araid/12000/index.html</A>
seems to have dual Ultra3/160 interfaces, and will take up to 12
UDMA/100 drives... If you were to use drives over the 100G mark, you
could easily reach 1Tb... and it would be fast random access to boot. I
don't think these are that expensive -- I beleive this model is around
$A10K...

Of course, a file system that size may be fun to fsck, but ... :)

&gt; 
&gt; They need some sort of software to manage the images: user 
&gt; level security, thumbnails, backup management, and a SQL 
&gt; database of image-related data.  A browser-based interface 
&gt; would be desirable.  We'd expect to write some "glue" scripts 
&gt; but are after a reasonable software starting point - we don't 
&gt; want to build it up from bits.

Sorry, I personally have little experience with that kind of thing.
Tried looking at freshmeat or googling or something?

doesn't sound particularly complex though ...

Actually, I just remembered something that a friend mentioned to me one
-- www.medialibrary.com.au ... I don't know much about it, but it could
be close to what you are looking for...
