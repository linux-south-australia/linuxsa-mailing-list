Hi Folks,

I've been asked to investigate the options for a largeish image
server with suitable management software.  The client is pro-MS,
but willing to consider Linux, and I'd think this sort of application
would be an excellent fit.

The images will be a variety of scans and digital camera images,
although in time I'm sure we'll need to support video and so on.

I've done some rough calculations and it looks like we need 40
Gb or so of RAID to store volatile images until they are safely
written to backup, maybe 200 Gb or so of flat storage to cache
recently accessed images, and some 0.5 to 1.0 Tb of "random
access" backup storage.  I was thinking in terms of a CD
Jukebox with a DVD-R drive, maybe with a drive upgrade in a
few years time to increase capacity.

They need some sort of software to manage the images: user
level security, thumbnails, backup management, and a SQL
database of image-related data.  A browser-based interface
would be desirable.  We'd expect to write some "glue" scripts
but are after a reasonable software starting point - we don't 
want to build it up from bits.

Anyone played with Linux-based software that might fit the bill?

Cheers, Dieter.
