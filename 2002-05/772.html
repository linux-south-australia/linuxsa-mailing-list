&gt; So it appears on the surface that debian is miles behind the others
&gt; but the fact is that in debian, official releases don't matter as you
&gt; continuously (or whenever you feel like it) upgrade any packages
&gt; that have new versions ('apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade').

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you get many package updates
between releases. Many bugfixes are back-ported though, and I presume
some features... and some packages are updated with new versions...  but
I haven't seen many...

Checking the Developers Reference explains this policy:

<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html">http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/ch-upload.en.html</A>#s-upload-stable

Specifically:

----
Uploading to stable means that the package will be placed into the
proposed-updates directory of the Debian archive for further testing
before it is actually included in stable.

Extra care should be taken when uploading to stable. Basically, a
package should only be uploaded to stable if one of the following
happens:

    * a security problem (e.g. a Debian security advisory)

    * a truely critical functionality problem

    * the package becomes uninstallable

    * a released architecture lacks the package

It is discouraged to change anything else in the package that isn't
important, because even trivial fixes can cause bugs later on. Uploading
new upstream versions to fix security problems is deprecated; applying
the specific patch from the new upstream version to the old one
("backporting" the patch) is the right thing to do in most cases.

Packages uploaded to stable need to be compiled on systems running
stable, so that their dependencies are limited to the libraries (and
other packages) available in stable; for example, a package uploaded to
stable that depends on a library package that only exists in unstable
will be rejected. Making changes to dependencies of other packages (by
messing with Provides or shlibs files), possibly making those other
packages uninstallable, is strongly discouraged.

The Release Team (which can be reached at
<A HREF="mailto:debian-release@lists.debian.org">debian-release@lists.debian.org</A>) will regularly evaluate the uploads in
proposed-updates and decide if your package can be included in stable.
Please be clear (and verbose, if necessary) in your changelog entries
for uploads to stable, because otherwise the package won't be considered
for inclusion. 
-----

So every Debian distro is a static set of package versions, with ongoing
security updates. FreeBSD does this better IMHO...
