&gt; What I was hoping is for advice by people involved in this area of
&gt; employment as to what courses I should be looking at, and really any
&gt; useful information you may have.

David,
You are getting conflicting advice, depending on whether the person offering 
it values Training, or Education.
Training - just about any "trade" certificate or diploma and just about all 
job experience - will tell you how to do that which is already known.  It 
will get you "up and running" quickly, but your view of the possible will 
necessarily be coloured by the scope of what you have been taught.
You might also be encouraged to "learn how to learn" - how to make enquiries 
in your field, and might be encouraged to learn things outside your immediate 
work requirement, but such encouragement will be incidental.

Education is basically training turned on its head.  University education at 
its best it provides you with many basic skills and ideas which can apply in 
many environments, introduces you to a wide range of possibilities and 
opportunities where those basic skills and ideas might be applied, and 
teaches you virtually nothing about specific applications in specific 
environments.  The idea is that you as a generalist should be able to narrow 
your focus to any particular area you need at the time whereas it is much 
more difficult to move from one narrow focus into another.  

If you WANT to go to Uni, then follow Alex advice and qualify to enter.  You 
SHOULD become a multi-skilled generalist, able quickly to adapt to most 
environments.

OTOH if you prefer to earn money and obtain more specific job skills, enter 
the workforce where you can, and do TAFE or similar courses.

Above all, you should follow Alex' second bit of advice.  Do what you WANT to 
do.  Be happy.
