&gt; Um, no batteries? How'm I going to check my e-mail on the patio (i.e.,
&gt; outside) during dinner if it doesn't have batteries?
&gt;
&gt; If it doesn't have PCMCIA, that means that everything has to be shoved
&gt; into it via USB, including wireless adapters, which would suck, as
&gt; you'd have this silly (not so) little thing dangling around the place.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Not seen one so no idea about suitability for Linux but
&gt; hey, they look
&gt; &gt; good and are considerably cheaper than most.
&gt;
&gt; It's no wonder they're cheaper.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.ecs.com.tw/">http://www.ecs.com.tw/</A> has some info though you would need to check
&gt; &gt; with your dealer to be sure just what the imported model includes.

&gt;
&gt; It's reasonably impressive for an iBook clone without batteries. I
&gt; still find that stupid to say the least. It *does* seem to have an
&gt; option of an external battery pack, but it's going to be bulky and
&gt; inconvenient.

ahh, but therein lies the rub. according to anandtech[1] this wasn't
designed as a take-anywhere-use-on-the-porch notebook; it was designed
simply for office users to take home and plug into the power supply at
home and continue to work the same as in the office. it's kind of a
cross between a laptop and a desktop. no battery means higher performing
components (no power supply, heat etc hassles), but with limited
portability. for it's intended use, it's actually not too bad an idea,
IMO.

finished a wonderful meal and were sitting around plotting our next move
over coffee. The waitress came up and asked, "More Coffee?" Decartes
replied, "I think not." And just disappeared right before my eyes."
