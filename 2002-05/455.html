Looks like a successful attempt to animate the list...
BTW, there are air conditioning systems (AKA evaporative) who only work
Windows are opened.

&gt; Ugh,
&gt; 
&gt; What is it about.. people?
&gt; 
&gt; I am subscribed to two major OS-platform discussion lists.  One is this
&gt; one, and one is a Windows NT discussion list.  I have posted to both.
&gt; 
&gt; When I post to the NT list, I usually receive at least one automated
&gt; reply from someone on the list saying they are out of the office, and
&gt; that all enquiries should be directed to such-and-such a person until
&gt; they get back.  I often respond to these inquiries, telling the person
&gt; who idiotic it is that they are posting an "Out of office" reply to
&gt; someone who posted to a mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; There are extremely regular posters to that list, and I can imagine the
&gt; amount of "Out of office" junk they receive in their email EVERY DAY.
&gt; It would totally suck.
&gt; 
&gt; These people are in a Sysadmin position, and as such should *realize*
&gt; what is going on.  But they don't.  The interesting thing about it is
&gt; that I would never ever receive an email like that from this list, but I
&gt; receive them every time from 'the other' list.  Let it be known, that
&gt; the topic has been brought up on the *other* list and nothing you can do
&gt; seems to stop it!
&gt; 
&gt; Does a simple thing like that show anything about difference in quality
&gt; of service, or quality of software between the NT and Linux platforms?
&gt; Simply that the people on the NT list are limited by their own brains to
&gt; not set up auto-responders correctly, or is it that they simply can't
&gt; customize it, because they're using a crappy piece of software?  And if
&gt; that were the case, wouldn't they think about it an unsubscribe?  It
&gt; drives me insane, it really does.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Why is this so?  Does it separate the man from the monkey?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Or am I being totally unreasonable?? :)
&gt; 
&gt; I think I'm going to post an email to the -other- list aswell.
