I'd avoid Intel NICs if possible.. I've had all kinds of trouble with them
over the years. 3COM have proved to be very nice though.

When I am given a choice, and the system actually matters to someone, I go
for 3com, or DEC Tulip as a 2nd choice.

If its just helping out a friend who wants to do gaming or something, a
sub-$20 Realtek does the trick.

Horses for courses, but 3com, dec, and 3com, are all well supported under
Linux. I can't say the same for Intel.

&gt; I've never *EVER* had those sort of problems with 3Com or Intel
&gt; cards. Sure, they're $90, but what's $70 when you're building a
&gt; machine?
