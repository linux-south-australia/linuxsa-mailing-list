&gt; what you've described doing is setting up an apt-proxy (as you

&gt; we keep upgrading all the machines to the latest woody packages
&gt; we don't have to download them multiple times. 

Hmm, up to a point, in my experience. An ordinary proxy will work just as
well for many purposes if you tweak it to be good at large binaries, and
may be more stable and faster.

apt-proxy does more stuff because it knows about Debian archive internals,
but its greatest gains won't be realised until the Debian archives are
rsyncable. apt-proxy is also a shell script with the limitations that
shell scripts tend to have. (hint: http daemons are not usually written in
sh :-) I'm not aware of any apt-get clones/equivalents which are really
ready for production.

About rsync in Debian archives: this is technically feasible but requies
some will to get done, see
<A HREF="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/rsync-and-debian/rsync-and-debian.html">http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/rsync-and-debian/rsync-and-debian.html</A>

&gt; But of course using debian I just did: apt-get install apt-proxy edit
&gt; it's config file appropriately edit the other machines
&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the apt-proxy and that's it.

Regardless of the tool used, Debian is currently capable of clocking up a
substantial bandwidth bill, perhaps without a good reason (depending on
the user and how sources.list is set up.)

Incidentally it would be extremely nice if the apt-get maintainers
included the -s parameter that Conectiva developed for their port, which
gives the reason for every proposed upgrade. I don't think there is much
communication between the two groups.
