Hi DSL,
    Just FYI, concerning multipartitions
    I came accross this problem with the umpteen partition scheme just 
recently putting Mandrake 8.1onto someone elses system
I use

/
/boot
/usr
/home/user1 etc
swap
/var

as my basics and found that auto mount fell in a heap on this system 
because it(Mandrake) also mounts win partitions for ease of use as

/mnt/win_c
/mnt/win_d
..... etc

then add floppy,cdrom,cdburner system all goes together fine but when 
you put a cdrom in the system protests and will not mount the cd

After much searching, I finally found that automount will only take up 
to 9 items at once
ie 6 linux partitions and 4 winblows partition  allows no room for cd's 
to mount.
(Not a problem on my system (no winblows to access) ) but a pain for 
Newer users who want to access data of winblows disks

I don't know if this has or can be fixed, but it certainly makes me look 
first at what partitions I create and/or allow to mount in setting up 
Mandrake.

&gt;&gt;&gt;together as soon as possible.  Please write me back as soon
&gt;&gt;&gt;as possible, only if
&gt;&gt;&gt;you're a chick and you're hot though.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[Ben Wrote:]
&gt;
&gt;&gt;...which is pretty amusing, as i went to school with hilary for a while
&gt;&gt;in high school (g'day mate) and he's definitely not a chick[1]. hot is
&gt;&gt;debatable tho ;-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hilary is definitely male; I'm not going to make any comments about
&gt;whether he's "hot" or "not hot". Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, the following events had occured:
&gt;
&gt;1) RedHat 6.1 was installed on one single, large partition
&gt;2) Default runlevel was 5
&gt;3) /tmp filled up
&gt; - and the X Font Server wouldn't start
&gt; - and XDM wouldn't start
&gt;
&gt;Now the symptoms that occured here were extraordinarily annoying. XDM
&gt;would respawn and hijack the console BEFORE you could do ctrl+alt+F2.
&gt;
&gt;Bringing oneself into runlevel 1 (i.e. single user) made all of / (the
&gt;only partition) read-only and it was difficult [to say the least] to
&gt;delete anything from /tmp. I couldn't remember the major/minor numbers
&gt;for the second hard disk (classically called /dev/hdb) or any of its
&gt;partitions and RedHat 6.1's rescue mode refused to automagically find
&gt;any linux installation and automagically mount them somewhere.
&gt;
&gt;Besides which, fsck run manually reported so many errors that I wasn't
&gt;confident the system was stable anyway.
&gt;
&gt;Therefore, given that Hilary wanted to install IBM's JDK, and X and
&gt;other stuff, I advised him that 1Gb was probably pushing one's luck and
&gt;therefore we should free some more space and do a reinstall. Which we
&gt;did.
&gt;
&gt;Hence, I split the partitions into my preferred partition scheme which
&gt;runs something like:
&gt;
&gt;/boot [25Mb]
&gt;/ [300Mb]
&gt;/home [1Gb]
&gt;[swap] [2XRAM]
&gt;/var [1Gb]
&gt;/usr [The Rest]
&gt;
&gt;On a production server I'd generally have:
&gt;
&gt;/boot [25Mb]
&gt;/ [300Mb]
&gt;/tmp [1Gb]
&gt;/home [1Gb or more]
&gt;/var [1Gb or more]
&gt;/usr [At Least 2.5Gb]
&gt;/usr/local [At Least 2.5Gb]
&gt;
&gt;...which of course puts me in the lots and lots of partitions camp.
&gt;
&gt;In any case, we got the JDK and most of the stuff Hilary wanted working.
&gt;The only thing that I couldn't work out how to get working was the
&gt;mysterious internal modem which I think is a WinModem.
&gt;
&gt;The funniest thing was that it appears that the JDK for Windows was
&gt;installed and was actually working but Hilary didn't know how to use it
&gt;;-P
