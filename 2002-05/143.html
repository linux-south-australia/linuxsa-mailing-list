Hi Joseph,

&gt; Currently now a high-end desktop replacement notebook costs around
&gt; $5000-$8000. For that kind of money you could be buying a brand name
&gt; server-class dual-CPU 2Ghz+ Pentium 4 Xeon or Athlon MP, 1Gb+ RAM, a lot
&gt; of hard drive room, and room for more expansion.

This is true but laptops also hold their value slightly better than desktop
machines do. They also become cheaper if you are able to salary sacrifice.

&gt; Again, I don't know if you require a full desktop on the go.. if you do
&gt; then a laptop would be perfect.

A laptop makes it much easier to attend LAN parties, although you do see
very few laptops at LANs (most likely because of the cost factor).

&gt; Hiya Sam,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm also looking at getting a similar beast to replace my desktop
machine
&gt; &gt; (putting Linux as well as XP on it). Laptops nowadays are powerful
enough
&gt; &gt; for anything you can throw at them including games (especially now with
the
&gt; &gt; GF4). Good luck getting everything working with Linux. Let us know how
you
&gt; &gt; get on.
&gt;
&gt; Being somewhat of a tech junkie and game player, I would have to say
&gt; that a notebook does have its purpose. If you're a traveler, it's
&gt; perfect.
&gt;
&gt; But as really as a desktop replacement it's going to cost around 2x-3x
&gt; of a similar desktop and it excludes major upgrades in the future. With
&gt; the kind of games coming out this year, a GeForce 4 MX will not provide
&gt; the kind of features necessary for Doom III and the like.
&gt;
&gt; Currently now a high-end desktop replacement notebook costs around
&gt; $5000-$8000. For that kind of money you could be buying a brand name
&gt; server-class dual-CPU 2Ghz+ Pentium 4 Xeon or Athlon MP, 1Gb+ RAM, a lot
&gt; of hard drive room, and room for more expansion. A full GeForce 4 Ti
&gt; would easily outclass the GeForce 4 Go by a large margin in higher
&gt; resolutions, since the notebook variety is a GeForce 4 MX.
&gt;
&gt; Again, I don't know if you require a full desktop on the go.. if you do
&gt; then a laptop would be perfect.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Joseph Tan
