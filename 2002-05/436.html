Subject: [LINK] Witnesses needed for spam lawsuit (Sydney)


It looks like I may need to round up witnesses for the lawsuit against 
Margarets Forest Pty Ltd. Margarets Forest and its parent company are 
customers of T3 Direct.

Can anybody who received a spam in mid January (It appears to have been 
sent mostly or entirely in the week of 7th January to 11th January) from

"<A HREF="mailto:forestgetawayNN@yahoo.com.au">forestgetawayNN@yahoo.com.au</A>" where NN is a two digit number, contact
me, 
particularly people in Sydney?

If you run a mail server and have logs dating back that far, it would be

helpful to save those logs and let me know of any relevant messages.

If you called the phone number in the spam and got relevant information
out 
of them (like admitting to the spam, identifying themselves as the 
defendant), and you're in Sydney or within convenient travelling
distance, 
such evidence is especially valuable. So far I have two people who can
give 
this evidence, but one is me and the other is located in Queensland.

If you know of anybody who took up the offer in the spam, I'd like to
hear 
from them too.

I'll also need expert witnesses in Sydney. People who can quantify the
cost 
of spam, and tell the Court of the damage it does (I'd use myself, but 
having somebody else do this is more persuasive).

Any other relevant evidence would be welcomed.

We're seeking for a ruling by the Court that not only is spam illegal,
but 
that it does so much damage that the Courts will award large damages to 
discourage it.
