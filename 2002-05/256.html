&gt; I'm thinking of joining Uni when I hit 21, which I beleive is 
&gt; the minimum adult entry age. I've been doing systems 
&gt; administration and programming professionally for the last 
&gt; two years, but I really want to get involved in something a 
&gt; bit more interesting than setting up Apache or writing a .JSP 
&gt; or .pl for J. Random Client.
&gt; 
&gt; Is a University degree the right way to go, or will it just 
&gt; mean that I'm more likely to be employed doing the same thing 
&gt; that I'm doing now? Staying on after graduation as a 
&gt; researcher is what I'm aiming for, I think.

You just need to figure out what it is that you want to do (which is not
easy), and then go do it. If you want to do more than web programming,
take what you have (this experience, that education), package it up, and
try to sell it to an employer -- remember than the main part of the
package is the person. Some jobs have certain specific requirements --
eg you won't get into the military unless you're fit and pass a security
clearance etc, and you won't get into academia without higher education
(Masters or PhD for serious stuff) or a serious independant contribution
that convinces them of your worth. Most jobs, however, require simply
that you are the right person. How that is defined is up to the
employer, but don't let your lack of university education stop you from
trying to better your lot -- just start learning, doing, and applying
for positions doing the interesting things you want to do...
