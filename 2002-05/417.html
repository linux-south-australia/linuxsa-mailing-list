Take a look at phpWiki <A HREF="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/">http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/</A>

It's very easy to setup (you have to guess a little with the mysql dsn
connection, but if you know mysql, then it won't be a drama).

Out of all of the Wiki clones, it's probably the simplest to use. 
However, it's not a very complicated clone and in my own experiences
with it, I've become very frustrated.  Probably the most frustrating
aspect is that I couldn't make it a virtual host.

I'm now looking at Twiki, which is a perl-based clone.  It's a lot more
feature full and complicated to setup to a usable point, but it does
handle being a virtual host and this is important for me...

We will be using Twiki to share ideas and the like so it's not quite a
knowledge base, but Twiki comes with example schemes to use it as such.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been scouring the internet for a knowledgebase (preferably
&gt; PHP/MySQL) to run locally on our Intranet.  The main requirements for it
&gt; are that it be EASY TO USE -- so easy that a Primary School student
&gt; could use it -- and that users are able to bring it up, search for
&gt; articles, or browse by category.
&gt; 
&gt; They would be able to create subcategories and would be able to add
&gt; articles to these subcategories.  Adding articles would be simplistic,
&gt; by just by answering questions in a form, which then gets added to the
&gt; appropriate subcategory.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been looking around at what's available, and nothing I've found
&gt; matches this criteria, because everything's either too complicated to
&gt; use, or not appropriate.  The closest product available appears to be
&gt; the Zope WikiWikiWeb.  I've browsed around the Internet many many times
&gt; before and found some reasonably good-looking front-ends of
&gt; knowledgebases before, and so am interested in any input and
&gt; recommendations anyone may have for what products I should be looking
&gt; at.
&gt; 
&gt; As I said above, ease of use is the most important thing, because it is
&gt; a system that will be open to everyone to use; and in the past it's been
&gt; proven that if it's too complicated, it just won't get used.
&gt; 
&gt; The only other option is to have one custom-written, and that may yet
&gt; still be the way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any good suggestions?
