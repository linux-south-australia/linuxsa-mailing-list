&gt; there is a new laptop out from ECS (distributed in SA by Leader) that

Apple do. Then, the rest of the computing world rushes around and
copies ideas off of them and varies the name ever so slightly, selling
it as their own product.

&gt; It is cheaper than most because it doesn't have batteries, works off 
&gt; 12v from Mains adapter. Also doesn't have PCMICIA, has 4 USB, LAN, 
&gt; Modem etc built in.

Um, no batteries? How'm I going to check my e-mail on the patio (i.e.,
outside) during dinner if it doesn't have batteries?

If it doesn't have PCMCIA, that means that everything has to be shoved
into it via USB, including wireless adapters, which would suck, as
you'd have this silly (not so) little thing dangling around the place.

&gt; Not seen one so no idea about suitability for Linux but hey, they look 
&gt; good and are considerably cheaper than most.

It's no wonder they're cheaper.

&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ecs.com.tw/">http://www.ecs.com.tw/</A> has some info though you would need to check 
&gt; with your dealer to be sure just what the imported model includes.

It's reasonably impressive for an iBook clone without batteries. I
still find that stupid to say the least. It *does* seem to have an
option of an external battery pack, but it's going to be bulky and
inconvenient.

I still fail to see why people insist on buying rubbish-quality
laptops when decent brand-name equivalents are out there. For God's
sake, just buy a Toshiba, HP, IBM, NEC or Compaq (i.e., something
good).
