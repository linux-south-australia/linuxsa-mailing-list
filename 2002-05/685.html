&gt;Consider a port scan initiated from a forged IP address - how
&gt;would you detect that?

&gt;I demonstrated this to a customer once - the forged IP address
&gt;I picked was their upstream provider, whom they funnel all their
&gt;DNS requests through.  After the scan, their firewall obligingly
&gt;blocked the IP address, and their DNS queries no longer resolved.

Darn, not a good idea then.  ok two more questions.

1.  I'm noticing an internal number that is doing port scans (according to
snort) out.  this number is definly not used, is looks to me like spoofing
as well except that someone is spoofing as us.  surely linux shouldnt' allow
spoofed packets to bounce off it?  obviously i need to change something to
stop this.

2.  how do i do this packet spoofing so i can try all avenues to test my own
setup ??  ...

hmm, i just seached google (after typing this) and found some stuff about
iptables and spoofing so i'll go read.  seems a waste to delete this message
so i'll send it anyway (much to the disgust of the purists i'm sure  :)

regards
Matthew
