Hi.

Having 2 Mandrake 8.2 machines (a notebook and a desktop) at home, and
wanting to sync them for packages and updates, I delved into the wonders
of rpmdrake and was soon immersed in urpmi and friends.

What I found was a system that mostly works for 1 workstation, but was a
bit lacking in documentation and flexibility for local rpm repositories.
I also found that rpmdrake was touchy about adding 'sources' and liked
to give me an error 'failed with error 2' and would occasionally stop
responding with no indication as to what was happening. 

Spending time in the man pages and various scripts on the system, I
gained the impression that I was working with a lesser cousin of apt. It
was also apparent that there is no man pages that specifically address
the local repository issue for urpmi or rpmdrake. On the other hand, apt
is well documented and I have had cause to use it with fink on Mac OS
10. Remembering the exchange between Dan and Geoffrey regarding apt and
rpm for the netcraft RedHat 7.3 mirror, I started hunting around and
turned up an article in the June 2000 PC Authority Mag on apt and rpm.

Using the article as a guide, I grabbed the apt src.rpm from
www.freshrpms.net and built and installed it on my system. I built my
existing repository into an apt source by symlinking the RPM directories
from my existing rpmdrake style repository into an apt tree so that it
looked thus:

/var/www/html/install
--&gt; apt/
    ---&gt; 8.2/
         ---&gt; base/
         ---&gt; RPMS.install1/
         ---&gt; RPMS.install2/
         ---&gt; RPMS.install3/
         ---&gt; RPMS.install4/
         ---&gt; RPMS.kde3/
         ---&gt; RPMS.updates/
    ---&gt; SRPMS.install1/
    ---&gt; SRPMS.install2/
    ---&gt; SRPMS.install3/
    ---&gt; SRPMS.install4/
    ---&gt; SRPMS.kde3/
    ---&gt; SRPMS.updates/

Then I ran a command to generate the hdlists etc:

genbasedir --topdir=/var/www/html/install/apt --bloat --progress 8.2
updates install1 install2 install3 install4 kde3

This completed without error. Now over to the notebook, install apt, and
change the redhat config in /etc/apt/sources.list so that it reflects my
local repository by adding:

rpm <A HREF="http://my_local_repository_host/">http://my_local_repository_host/</A>  install/apt/8.2 install1 install2
install3 install4 kdes updates

And commenting out the RH7.3 stuff.

Now to run 'apt-get update'

Initially there were some complaints about missing directories in
/var/cache/apt and /var/state which I created by hand until the tree was
filled. Then the command completed, connecting to the repository and
processing the data from the repository. I installed a package requiring
dependencies and it completed without error. This is good! Very good.Now
I can sync the updates to one box, and update both at will, as well as
install anything I need from the install rpms.

Question: Are there any local mirrors of the Mandrake updates, esp. the
security updates? Rpmdrake does not show any Australian sites.

Regards,

Michael
