Hi.

GPL or no, the attitude of the lead developer will eventually kill the
project IMHO.

I wouldn't do another Smoothwall install. period. I promote IPCop as a
worthwile and active alternative. So does just about anyone else I have
come across that used to run/install SW.

Interestingly, the IPCop team have a big handicap: Ex-Smoothwall users
wishing to vent their ire over the smoothwall support! (or abuse!)

Regards,

Michael

&gt; It appears that Smoothwall are moving as far away from the GPL as 
&gt; possible and will supply a 'lite version'  rather than a GPL'd version when

&gt; 
&gt; If you look at their page they seem to indicate that their closed version 
&gt; will be better if developed in house and appear to have taken up the 
&gt; mantra of 'closed is better'.
&gt; 
&gt; With IPCOP, a fork of Smoothwall (that really upset them) still under the 
&gt; GPL will Smoothwall's change of license make you support alternatives, 
&gt; or does the GPL license have little bearing on your decision to promote 
&gt; one product over another?
&gt; 
&gt; As someone who has installed many copies of Smoothwall for private 
&gt; people and businesses and promoted them because they were GPL'd 
&gt; products, I'm not sure how I feel about Smoothwall now, I can't help 
&gt; getting the feeling that they were never really in favour of GPL's code, 
&gt; and that I have spent time and energy promoting a 'con-trick'
&gt; 
&gt; If they had used BSD from the start and told the community that closed 
&gt; would be the future, would they have been as successful as they are 
&gt; now?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, off the soap box :-)
&gt; As a Linux group I was wondering what others felt about this move?

&gt; As per normal with this multi-cultural group :-) BSD/MAC/Linux/flame-
