I've been playing around with SARG (which seems to be sqmgrlog, just
with various bits adjusted) lately to get per-user logs happening
again.[1]

access.log is about 490MB -- not particularly large. The size of my
access.log has been as high as been &gt; 1GB and was handled reasonably
gracefully by sqmgrlog.

It's been running for about 40-odd minutes now, and it's still not
doing anything that remotely resembles producing HTML.

The machine's a dual PIII-450, 512MB RAM, SCSI hard drives. I don't
think that the machine's performance is an issue.

D'z anyone with SARG experience have any inclination to give an
opinion here? I'm a little puzzled as to why it's still not produced
any output.

Thanks in advance,

   - andrew

[1] They *were* happening nightly, 'cept I deciced to pull out the
    server that was generating them and centralise the
    operation. Several weeks later, it's still not happening :-/
