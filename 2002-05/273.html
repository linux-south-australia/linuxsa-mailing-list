Hi all...

remember this?

&gt; Regarding the BIOS issue, here's a list of things people 
&gt; suggested (just in case anyone else ever needs a list of 
&gt; ideas to try to attempt to get into the BIOS of an unknown 
&gt; PC). I haven't tried all of them yet, as I haven't had 
&gt; opportunity to take the machine down again... I'll try that 
&gt; on the weekend, I think.

Well, it's been a few weeks, but I finally got to trying things, and
it's even stupider than I thought possible. Thanks to Matthew
Moyle-Croft for suggesting looking at Jumpers -- I had discounted them
as being irrelevant, as every computer I have used since the early 90s
barely uses them. Anyway, it was much worse than his suggestion (which
was to check if there's a jumper that hides or locks out the BIOS)...
This machine actually had a 3-pin jumper that you set to 1-2 for
"CONFIG", 2-3 for "NORMAL", and open for "RECOVERY". Insane. To get to
the BIOS, you actually have to take the lid off, get out the
pointy-nosed pliers, and swap the jumper, then boot up, and do the
reverse to test it. I can't beleive they actually did that. ... Anyway,
I'm sure they had their reason... (????)
