&gt; The first thing I want to say is - thank you very much for your help David
&gt; Lloyd, Peter Gossner, Richard Sharpe, Richard Russell, David Fitch...and
&gt; anyone else that replied... :)
&gt;
&gt; The second thing is I hope that all will turn out for the best for David
&gt; Lloyd in the near future.
&gt;
&gt; I know I am still not done yet and am trying to get a useable format on my
&gt; web site but have had some "mechanical issues" trying to upload it.
&gt;
&gt; I first, converted my huge file to RTF and then loaded that up into
ABIWORD.
&gt; That went well, and I even saved it as an separate ABI file. I uploaded
both
&gt; of those files.
&gt;
&gt; morton2001.org/example.html.
&gt;
&gt; I saved another file as a Docbook, but it took so long for the RTF file to
&gt; upload, I didn't think I would be home in time for cornflakes if I
continued
&gt; today.
&gt;
&gt; I also hope to familiarize myself with Docbook soon.
&gt;
&gt; How to handle changes? That's probably why docbook has been recommended.
&gt; Anyway, for now, you can just email me back the portion of the book with
any
&gt; corrections.
&gt;
&gt; Tommarrow I will work on making a slimmed down version that does not have
&gt; pictures so I can the book in an easily transportable and changable format
&gt; so I can focus on the content.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, its late here, and I have to go home as soon as the DSL modem on
our
&gt; lan stops flashing heavily. Its been going for quite some time now.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've lost your e-mail because it went to another account I have no
&gt; &gt; access to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To use docbook under RedHat:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) write the docbook
&gt; &gt; 2) type "docbook2pdf"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Try:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; man jw
&gt; &gt; man docbook2pdf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also try:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; docbook2[tab]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (i.e. type docbook2 then press tab one or two times)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Goto:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * <A HREF="http://www.docbook.org/">http://www.docbook.org/</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ..and download The Definitive Guide. It's a difficult book to learn
&gt; &gt; DocBook from but it's a start.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Docbook is a DTD (in XML or SGML).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; DSL
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (1) Although everyone claims that XML is the supported versin, as far as
&gt; &gt; I'm concerned the XML tools in general suck and the DSSSL tools are more
&gt; &gt; mature and most likely to render things the way you want.
