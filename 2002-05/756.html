&gt; &gt;&gt;yes, debian is definitely more of an "internet" distro than redhat
&gt; &gt;&gt;and others (which is why I use apt-proxy).  I guess it comes from the 
&gt; &gt;&gt;philosophy of install it once then continuously upgrade bit by bit 
&gt; &gt;&gt;rather than redhat's re-install from scratch all the time approach.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I thin the re-install thing is a fallacy.  Have you actually tried upgrading Red 
&gt; &gt; Hat in the last 3 versions?  I've had no problems on any of the boxen I deal 
&gt; &gt; with.
&gt; 
&gt; Last I checked it wasn't possible to do a live upgrade from CD unless 
&gt; you could mount all CDs simultaneously, as packages installed on CD 1 
&gt; often needed packages from CD 2.
&gt; 
&gt; It's my experience that Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD are both much more 
&gt; easily upgraded.  I guess we'll see when Debian Woody (3.0) comes out 
&gt; and somebody tries upgrading from 2.2.

Done that -- worked a treat.

Only complaint I have is that it would be nice if there was a more
intelligent way of dealing with changed config files. Same with FreeBSD,
though it's a bit different.

Debian's problem is that if a config file was script-generated, or
modified by you at all (ie, it differs from the old installed one at
all), then you have to manually check it. It's frustrating when it's
been a long time, and you have to go through each line of say
squid.conf... especially if something's changed about the format...

FreeBSD is more irritating, in that it doesn't know if you've changed it
or not, it just knows it's a config file, so asks you if you want to
install the new or keep the old, or edit... very frustrating when
there's 200 files, most of which you haven't seen before, and it's an
older machine, so you don't know what might have been changed earlier.
At least much of the configuration is kept in one file as shell
variables, and each config file uses this info in its' own format.
