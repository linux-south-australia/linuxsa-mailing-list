I've been using OpenOffoce on Win2K at work for about 3 months now, 
unofficially of course as we're supposed to be in the M$ trap, and having 
OfficeXP installed as well it's been interesting to compare the results.
The only complaint I've really had about OO (and it's a minor one) has been 
the time to initiate the application, even on a 2 X 1Ghz P3 with 2Gig RAM HP 
CAD design station it takes about 7 seconds to start OO compared to roughly 2 
for M$Office.
The good part is I've received some badly formatted M$ word files and they've 
actually looked better on OpenOfFice than on M$ Office  :)  go figure

&gt; If it makes you feel any better, I'm using OO v1.0 instead
&gt; of Office2k on my machine, figured I may as well trial it in
&gt; a real world situation (not that I'm a heavy office user anyway),
&gt; but i've been opening random docs/spreadsheets etc off our network,
&gt; and have been very impressed with the conversion.
&gt;
&gt; Just opened a 5mb spreadsheet, 13500 rows with formulas, took around
&gt; 8 seconds and works/looks exactly the same as the same spreadsheet in
&gt; Excel (Excel takes around 3-4 seconds for the same spreadsheet, haven't
&gt; tried saving it in native OO format yet).
&gt;
&gt; (Only hassles I've had so far are with some messy table docs created in
&gt; Word, some of the cell formatting didn't come across 100%, but that was
&gt; a couple second job to fix, unfortunately Joe Average might not want to
&gt; fix up the odd doc that doesn't convert correctly, but anyway)
