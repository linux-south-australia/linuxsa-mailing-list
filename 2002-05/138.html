&gt; I am buying the ultimate (well ultimate for 6 months anyhow) geek toy -
&gt; a new laptop - and I want to run the ultimate geek OS - Linux!!!

Well, after seeing Luke Mewburn's laptop (of NetBSD fame), I'd have to
say that BSD is a lot more geeky than Linux -- Linux has become to
icky and GUI :-)

&gt; I am also getting the UXGA screen and Nvidia GeForce 4 Go (should be no
&gt; challenge to get going)
&gt; 
&gt; The Lucent internal modem / ethernet combo (should also work) 

Certainly should.

&gt; Silicon Labs (Cyrus Logic?) sound chip (can't remember chipset ID) - not
&gt; sure if this will work even though it is listed as SB compatible

Find out the exact chipset name and have a Google for it.

&gt; DVD ROM drive / CD burner combination drive (this is my main concern for
&gt; Linux) - no idea of hardware make / model yet.

Well, if it's a normal IDE device, I can't see why it wouldn't work.

&gt; Second battery (will power management work in Linux?)

Usually -- what kind of power management skit does it have in it?

&gt; Firewire port (will this work?)

Have a look at the IEEE 1394 for Linux HCL, which lists both devices
and adapters -- <A HREF="http://linux1394.sourceforge.net/hcl.php">http://linux1394.sourceforge.net/hcl.php</A>

&gt; Infrared port (will this work?)

Will what work? You need to know exactly what you're investigating.

&gt; SPDIF output on sound card (will this give at least 5.1 surround sound
&gt; with the appropriate equipment under M$ if not Linux?)

Some of that may be software, but I don't really have the knowledge to
comment here.

&gt; Super Video / Video output (will this work in Linux?)

All of my laptops that have had VGA/S-Video output just plugged
straight into the TV. Of the recent Dell's with TV out that I've
worked on, most of them appeared to have this as a hardware function,
and didn't have any drivers requirement.

Have a look at <A HREF="http://www.linux-laptop.net/.">http://www.linux-laptop.net/.</A> Whilst it doesn't appear
to be carrying the 8200, it definitely has the 8100, which seems to
have the odd similarity.

Perhaps you'd be better off finding laptops that have similar
componentry and having a read of their pages on the aforementioned
site.
