&gt; Hello, list:
&gt; 
&gt; I administer a rather diverse network, and part of it is a wireless WAN.
&gt; I am a bit worried about the traffic that's flowing over the aether and
&gt; so I would like to encrypt all data going over wireless as well as deny
&gt; all non-encrypted data. This seems to be the best solution, as you can
&gt; basically take it for granted that a determined script-kiddy can
&gt; participate on your Wi-Fi network after 1 hour of determined sniffing,
&gt; but the worst they can then do is play Quake with a mate bouncing off
&gt; the same transceiver. I think. ;)

Well, they can probably do it in less time than that, and with little
determination too. Be carefull of your usage costs of your high
bandwidth internet link too if they can access that. Thats what they
want. I know of at least 2 groups of people who have done this in
adelaide, so they are out there.... And no - Im not involved.
 
&gt; 1)	Does anyone have any recommendations for GPL or similar products that
&gt; can do this? Hardware requirements for (say) 30 remote users at 5 sites?
&gt; 2)	Does anyone know of online references for such a setup?
&gt; 3)	Does anyone have any comments to make on this topic of network
&gt; security, given that the service is in place, I did not set it up, and
&gt; all I can do is try to improve it without a budget? :)

Check out free s/wan [1]  You can probably find all the info you need
there.
