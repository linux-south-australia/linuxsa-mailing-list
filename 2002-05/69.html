&gt;&gt; I think its a silly domain, why didn't they make something 
&gt;&gt; like email.sa.gov.au or mail.sa.gov.au?
&gt;
&gt;I once asked them this, and apparrently the .sa.gov.au domain (which
&gt;would make more sense) was already taken by the people who run the
&gt;.sa.gov.au domain, and someone decided on saugov, for some unknown
&gt;reason (like someone decided on lastname.firstname in a organisation
&gt;with tens of thousands of people... yay.)

Probably the same &lt;insert whatever you like&gt; people who signed lengthy
contracts with a certain large international company..................

(Just on the govvy mail system, there's over 27,000 users running on a 
"farm" of 30 or so Exchange boxen costing the taxpayer roughly the number
of users with several more zeros on the end (possibly more).  Methinks
that decision was made by the same people too........................sigh)

These opinions are my own & in no way represent the opinions of my 
employers, though I wish my employers would get their heads out of their
proverbials and see how much theyre being screwed
