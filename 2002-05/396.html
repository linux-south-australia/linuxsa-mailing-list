Oh yeah, at that time the firewall log shows a probable FIN scan, and we 
have been scanned periodically.

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt;
&gt; Well, I guess it is common knowledge that if one of your coworkers on 
&gt; a Windows machine gets an obscene email - it probably has a virus 
&gt; attached.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, we have an older lady in the office and she didn't tell me she 
&gt; was getting these emails.
&gt;
&gt; Turns out she had received the Klez and elcorn virus/worm. And we 
&gt; finally noticed we had been hit on Friday.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, so our company had a discussion and I basically convinced the boss 
&gt; to have that person reboot the machine and go into Linux to check her 
&gt; email.
&gt;
&gt; So I set her up and put in her email settings into netscape. Being 
&gt; that her computer was the only computer attached to the network and 
&gt; more importantly that I was in Linux, I got a bit bold and checked her 
&gt; email and opened one of the obscene messages she receives on a daily 
&gt; basis.
&gt;
&gt; So what do I see  - but a WEB SITE called - sharethefun.com. With 
&gt; links matching the obscene titles our employee had received as well as 
&gt; a pop up message asking for an email address of a friend to share the 
&gt; fun with.
&gt;
&gt; I went to netsol.com and saw that the domain name is registered to 
&gt; "VIRAL MARKETING INC." in New York City.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, so the first thing I did was check netstat.
&gt;
&gt; Up comes 100 or so connections to three ip addresses using ports with 
&gt; just as many names. One name that caught my eye was Novell Zen.
&gt;
&gt; So, to me this is some really scary stuff. Comments anyone?
