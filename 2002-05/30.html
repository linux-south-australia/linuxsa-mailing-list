&gt; Last time I spoke to someone I was advised that you can legally buy a Hard

&gt; would want to pay good $$ for a M$ O/S is beyond me.
&gt;
&gt; An OEM license has to stay with that PC ( Hard disk / Motherboard ) for its
&gt; life, so you cant just wipe the system clean install Windows on another PC
&gt; and claim you are still licensed.  There is nothing stopping you from wiping
&gt; Windows and installing Linux or whatever - You cant then legally go and sell
&gt; your Windows OEM license to someone else.

No.. There's certain basic trade practices laws in Australia that say
Microsoft can't do that. As an Australian Consumer you have a few more
rights than the American Lusers who seem to have given all their rights
away.

You know the fine print at the bottom of lots of licenses and contracts and
so on, that says something like "Local laws and regulations may vary and
provide extra rights"? It's worth checking up upon, because Microsoft
doesn't set the country's laws.. yet.
