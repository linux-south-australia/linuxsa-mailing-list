Hi.

Well, I'm using Mandrake because it is the most painless and effective
distro I have found for my hardware (dual celeron + voodoo) that is
reasonably up to date. I might be wrong, but my impression is that
debian doesn't include the later libs etc that I might need if I wanted
to dl the latest gee-whiz stuff from freshmeat or sourceforge and
compile it successfully. Actually, some of this stuff is not so
gee-whiz, it amazes me how quickly many of the libraries are rendered
out-of-date, esp the gui stuff (can you spell gnome and gtk)

I'm happy to be edumacated otherwise, please feel free to elucidate.

I do like the principles upon which debian is based, but I do not have
an unlimited pipe connected to the 'net however.

Regards

Michael

&gt; indeed.  You must really want to use Mandrake!
&gt; what you've described doing is setting up an apt-proxy (as you
&gt; may already know).  I have done the same thing at home for when
&gt; we keep upgrading all the machines to the latest woody packages
&gt; we don't have to download them multiple times.  But of course
&gt; using debian I just did:
&gt; apt-get install apt-proxy
&gt; edit it's config file appropriately
&gt; edit the other machines /etc/apt/sources.list to point to the apt-proxy
&gt; and that's it.
&gt; 
&gt; Dave.
