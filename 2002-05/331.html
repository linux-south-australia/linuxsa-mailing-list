Hi Daniel M, 

What Daniel P has said here is good advice.

If you want to learn hands on, go to TAFE. I am at Adelaide TAFE 
studying towards a diploma in network engineering.

The old TAFE IT stuff used to be all in one, but not they stream
the IT subjects so that you can specialise in networking, programming,
and systems (management, databasing)

It sounds like you would want to do the networking stream like I am. 
While the course is based on networking there are still other components
included into the course. Some of the subjects that you do between Cert
3 and
Diploma are as follows. This list is by no means complete, and you do
not
have to do all of these either.

Cert 3.
Applications (Word, Access, Excel)
Novell Netware
Windows 2000 basic administration
Basic networking concepts. 
Windows 2000 Advanced server administration
Software Documentation

Cert 4.
Basic Linux
Advanced Linux
Systems (MS Project)
CISCO 1
CISCO 2
Basic VB Programming
Basic Java Programming

Diploma.
Build internet infrastructure
more systems management subjects...

A UNI degree is not the most important thing at all, 
sure it is good but you can always study at TAFE now, 
and get adult entry to UNI later without having to worry 
about your year 12 score.

But most of all get work experience. Contact a local
ISP and see if they take on work experience students. 
Contact schools or even the TAFE near you. You never know,
you may also get lucky if they think you are good enough 
they may offer you a part time job at the end of it.

Many people that I know or have worked with in the IT
industry do not have UNI degrees, they just have a burning
urge to learn and grasp new concepts as fast as they can.

Most of all I hope you like reading really FAT books. :)

Hope this has helped somewhat.

&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; /* Start Soapbox Here */
&gt; Uni may be an option further down the track.
&gt; 
&gt; Uni generally, (!), has reasonably smart people, but outside Uni, its a
&gt; mixed bag, & you have to work with the mixed bag, which is always
&gt; interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; Graduates who have had a working life before Uni are much more balanced
&gt; & capable of dealing with the real-world much better.
&gt; 
&gt; I learnt a lot a Uni, but I've learnt heaps running my own business &
&gt; helping run other peoples. I never completed my degree as it wasn't
&gt; taking me were I wanted to go. Now, I'd have no problems going back to
&gt; Uni, because I know what I want to do I what I want out of being there,
&gt; however professional certification, (RedHat, Lotus, IBM), would be more
&gt; of an advantage than Uni.
&gt; 
&gt; It is becoming more common to go back to Uni in your 20s & 30s.
&gt; Many of my peers at Uni had families, were studying
&gt; part-time/full-time.
&gt; There backgrounds were roadies, army...
&gt; Hell, the head of my engineering school was an electrician.
&gt; 
&gt; Later in professional life, not having the Uni degree is Not Good from
&gt; a prospective employers view, but perhaps you might be interested in
&gt; running your own business, so having skills you can market to customers
&gt; is more important than the degree, so certification is more important.
&gt; 
&gt; Its 3-4 years of you life, so you'd better know that is *really* what
&gt; you want to do.
&gt; 
&gt; Its easier to find out the things you don't like than the things you
&gt; do.
&gt; So armed with differing professional experiences, you'll start to
&gt; understand the fundamental things that turn you on, like: "Hey, I like
&gt; problem solving, dealing with people, the buzz of working on something
&gt; new, good design..."
&gt; 
&gt; /* End Soapbox Here */
&gt; 
&gt; Keeping a professional journal is A Good Idea.
&gt; I've got 27 of them for the last 3 years :)
&gt;

&gt;
