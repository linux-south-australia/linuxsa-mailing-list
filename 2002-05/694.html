LOL...if you were on a 3 gig per month plan you would use your months
allowance in 1 minute.

Internet2 speed record
May 23 2002

An international team has set a new record for Internet performance by
transferring the equivalent of an entire CD's contents across more than
12,272km of network in 13 seconds.

The rate of 401 megabits per second achieved in transferring 625 megabytes
of data from Fairbanks, Alaska to Amsterdam in the Netherlands is over 8000
times greater than the fastest dial-up modem.

The team consisted of the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, the Faculty of
Science of the University of Amsterdam, and SURFnet, the national computer
network for higher education and research in the Netherlands. At both ends,
standard PC-like hardware running Debian GNU/Linux was used.

With an Internet connection of this size transferring all six CDs of Woody,
the soon-to-be released version 3.0 of Debian, from Fairbanks to Amsterdam
would only require 78 seconds. Faster CD burners are needed, it would seem.

"This shows that geography is no barrier to advanced network applications,"
said Kerry Digou, the systems programmer who headed the University of Alaska
team. "Using standard equipment and infrastructure developed in the
Internet2 community, we've pushed the boundaries to the edges."
