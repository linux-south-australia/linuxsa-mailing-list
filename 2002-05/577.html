&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am running VMWare with Windows 2000 as the guest OS under Mandrake 8.2
&gt; as the host OS - and it works PERFECTLY!
&gt; 
&gt; I still have to work out how to share the host filesystem and Internet
&gt; connection with the guest OS - can anyone give me any pointers?
&gt; 
&gt; I have Samba running - and the 'localhost' or 'hostname' server appears
&gt; under the Windows 2000 network neighbourhood thing except it can't
&gt; connect (invalid path).  The local (guest machine) shows up under the
&gt; network fine (for printers only though).
&gt;
I use VMware at work for a number of other OSes on a Linux workstation. 
We have a WinNT Domain set-up so I authenticate off of that to access my
localhost files.  If you don't have a domain set-up, then you'll need to
authenticate directly with the samba server.  Are you using the VMware
samba or the "native" samba?

Basically, you need to set-up samba in a standard way and have a way to
authenticate... man smbpasswd.

As far as Internet access goes, this should be really easy (well, it was
in my case in that it just worked).  I installed the virtual machines as
separate network entities with the correct gateways and so on and so
forth and everything worked well.  I also set the virtual machines so
that they used a dhcp server and most of the work was done for me by the
dhcp server.  In fact, the only thing I had to read up a bit on was how
to keep the same MAC address between boots and it was all as per usual
with setting up another machine on the network.
 
&gt; I need to install graphics and sound drivers - I presume they will work
&gt; and then I will have a full blown secondary OS for legacy (Windows)
&gt; applications!
&gt;
No, you don't.  you may be talking about the VMware Tools Install...
option in the Settings menu.

VMware is very, very cool - I want to ban dual-boots altogether at work
because of some of the major headaches in managing these machines -
don't believe that will ever completely happen, but VMware certainly
provides a valid alternative worth investigating and pushing....

Have fun!
