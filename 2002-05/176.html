Thanks Anthony,

As it was in a PC I was repairing for my father in law
I am going to be buying another board to replace it,
its just that I have an empty case here waiting to be a Linux
file server and I was hoping that I could possibly salvage it and
use it for that. If it wasn't for the fact that my wife and I are
still full time students I wouldn't bother. 

Just trying to make the best of a bad situation and save some
cash where I can :)

Oh and to all those people (who don't exist on this list)
who think Windows is the best, I'd like to see them come up with 
a Microsoft solution to use a 486 or Pentium with no graphics card, 
36MB of RAM, no keyboard or mouse attached from installation to finish.

(Just felt like having a public whinge about MS,
it's been a while. Very therapeutic as well I might add)

As to your offer of a free board thank you very much I may take you
up on the offer but I have already had another offer from someone on 
this list for a replacement. I will wait to see if the one they have
suits.

Regards,
Nathan Millhouse

&gt; I would have thought that with the price of such a board (second hand)
&gt; being so cheap, you would just replace it and not bother! Hell if you
&gt; want to come to my place I'll give you a replacement board. :-)

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I just had the luck to short the keyboard controller on a P120
&gt; &gt; motherboard while replacing a PCI cover. :(
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Everything else still works fine but I now have now keyboard input.
&gt; &gt; Is it still possible to get linux (most likey Redhat 7.2) onto this
&gt; &gt; PC doing a kickstart installation?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will have to boot from a floppy initially as the motherboard
&gt; &gt; does not support cd boots. If I am correct the installer
&gt; &gt; times out and automatically begins the installation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have never done a kickstart installation before so I don't
&gt; &gt; know if you have to input any keystrokes at all.
&gt; &gt; If I have to, I can click on something that is ok as the mouse
&gt; &gt; works fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If all of this is good and it will work, can someone please
&gt; &gt; point me to a site that has examples of kickstart files
&gt; &gt; as I have never seen one, and cannot do an identical install on
&gt; &gt; another system and then save the config for a kickstart installation
&gt; &gt; to disk.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks heaps,
&gt; &gt;
