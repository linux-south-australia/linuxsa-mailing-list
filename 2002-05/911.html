Sony japan released the yaroze which was a similar home brew kit, but
with slightly limited librarys and slower code than the official dev
kit. They released yaroze only to the japanese market. Home brew gurus
then first came out with the ez-o-ray (read backwards) flash chip
replacement for the action replay to use the high speed link rather than
the default yaroze serial link. People also hacked the dongle off the
yaroze boot cd, and the whole scene flourished. Sony watched, but didnt
act. Some people even got hold of the official psyq development library
and compiler, while others used the yaroze one which was a mips gcc
cross compiler with libs. However, the ez-o-ray guys got a cease and
desist (I think they had something to do with the official yaroze, and
presumably breached and NDA). A better replacement was then released
called caelta, and sony continued to leave the scene alone. People still
use caetla this day. Despite all this sony then made linux the official
development platform for PS2, and came up with the linux kit as well, so
they seem to be legit, and taking it all quite well really. Its not a
short term thing since it stems back to yaroze useing gcc a few years
ago on ps1.....

&gt; 	If this is true they could have thought of worse ways to further
&gt; their market
&gt; 	penetration!  
&gt; 
&gt; 	Looking at these sites
&gt; 	-<A HREF="http://www.technology.scee.net/cgi-bin/scee/scee.pl?ps2linux,">http://www.technology.scee.net/cgi-bin/scee/scee.pl?ps2linux,</A>
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://au.playstation.com/technology/linuxkit.jhtml">http://au.playstation.com/technology/linuxkit.jhtml</A> I am optamistic
&gt; and believe
&gt; 	that they (Sony) do truely wish to encourage open source
&gt; developement.  They
&gt; 	seem to have really put some effort in to allowing full open source
&gt; use of the
&gt; 	PS2 hardware.  It also seems that there is no way that the kit can
&gt; be used to
&gt; 	facilitate piracy (is this what you were talking about impairing the
&gt; market?).
&gt; 	I am sure that they don't feel the developers (who the $500 kit is
&gt; aimed at)
&gt; 	represent a substantial market for propietry games.  Even if the
&gt; kits did
&gt; 	result in some top games (which would be great), Sony would either
&gt; profit from
&gt; 	increased development kit sales (which could be just as profitable
&gt; as propietry
&gt; 	games sales) or from sales of a port to the original system.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Either way they are promoting open source and providing some decent
&gt; hardware to
&gt; 	play with.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Good to hear your thoughts,
&gt; 
&gt; 	Nick

&gt; 	&gt; I agree, I'd also rather support a company that officially

&gt; 	&gt; get a Linux kit let us know how you find it, I am sure everyone

&gt; 	&gt; interested. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	Is it possible that Sony are only using 'the current perceived rage'
&gt; 
&gt; 	(ie: Linux) to further their 'grand scheme' and market penetration?
&gt; And 
&gt; 	then ultimately not honour the 'Linux spirit', by not allowing any

&gt; marketing 
&gt; 	ploy with no real delivery. Ultimately, OSS games on Linux would 
&gt; 	potentially impair the market for commercial DMCA copy protected

&gt; useful 
&gt; 	manner on the PS2 (or Xbox etc...) AND control the market and
&gt; restrict

&gt; 
&gt; 	Just a few thoughts.

&gt; 	&gt; I agree,
&gt; 	&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;     I'd prefer to pay Sony, for the PS/2 who are prepared to
&gt; officially 
&gt; 	&gt; support linux than Microsoft for another xbox to support their
&gt; sales. ie 
&gt; 	&gt; Every sale to one side, is one less for the other.
&gt; 	&gt; Why else do you think their prepared to support a loss?
&gt; 	&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt; For someone who is into games and has a P/S already the $499 AU is
&gt; a 
&gt; 	&gt; fairly cheap way of getting a  reasonable starting computer, the
&gt; fact 
&gt; 	&gt; that they then start with linux, instead of having to be
&gt; enlightened 
&gt; 	&gt; (substitute any other suitable word ),  is a major bonus in favour
&gt; of this.

&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;What's more interesting are some of the mod chips coming out for
&gt; the
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;microsoft Xbox. It already has hard drive and Ethernet for
&gt; something
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;like $399, and one of the xbox hacker groups has discovered a
&gt; backdoor
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;bios hook to allow it to load arbitrary x86 code.
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;In English, that means there's a strong possibility that it will
&gt; be able
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;to run Linux, despite all the crypto requirements for booting the
&gt; OS.
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;Hmm. Paying microsoft for hardware to run linux on? Even if it
&gt; does save
&gt; 	&gt;&gt;you money Im not sure if I like that idea :(
