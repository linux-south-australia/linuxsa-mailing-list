&gt;Just thought I would share with you the wonderful (!) 
&gt;experiences I have had with M$ today.

If it makes you feel any better, I'm using OO v1.0 instead
of Office2k on my machine, figured I may as well trial it in
a real world situation (not that I'm a heavy office user anyway),
but i've been opening random docs/spreadsheets etc off our network,
and have been very impressed with the conversion.

Just opened a 5mb spreadsheet, 13500 rows with formulas, took around
8 seconds and works/looks exactly the same as the same spreadsheet in
Excel (Excel takes around 3-4 seconds for the same spreadsheet, haven't
tried saving it in native OO format yet).

(Only hassles I've had so far are with some messy table docs created in
Word, some of the cell formatting didn't come across 100%, but that was
a couple second job to fix, unfortunately Joe Average might not want to
fix up the odd doc that doesn't convert correctly, but anyway)
