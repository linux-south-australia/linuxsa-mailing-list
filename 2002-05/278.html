Hi all,

And the other half of that thread... (remember this also?):

There is a moral to this story (which was going to be a question, but I
think it's ended up as a story... it's quite long, so don't bother
reading it if you aren't interested in my problems :)  ...

&gt; Some time ago, I had an issue where a freeBSD box wouldn't 
&gt; auto-detect two identical drives as being the same geometry. 
&gt; Well, it's happenning again, but this time, I think I know 
&gt; what's causing it... The drives, in this case, are on 
&gt; separate IDE channels, both as slaves. On the primary 
&gt; channel, the master is an older (ATA66 or ATA33) HDD, and on 
&gt; the secondary channel, the master is a CDROM drive. The one 
&gt; on the secondary is being detected with a massively reduced 
&gt; number of cylinders, which ends up restricting the capacity 
&gt; to about 6G (should be ~40G). The one on the primary gets 
&gt; detected with heaps more cylinders, and a filesystem there 
&gt; has 35G capacity (which I assume is about right, given HDD 
&gt; manufacturer's interpretation of powers of 2, and filesystem 
&gt; overhead). This is approximately the same as I experienced on 
&gt; the FreeBSD machine, though I seem to recall it detecting the 
&gt; correct size, but wrong geometry in that case (it was a newer 
&gt; machine, and a newer HDD).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, does anyone know (or have a reference that can tell 
&gt; me) what kind of interference one can get on IDE channels? 
&gt; for eg, I'm pretty sure that the fact that I'm mixing an 
&gt; ATA33 and an ATA100 drive on an ATA33 channel shouldn't 
&gt; matter (though the ATA100 drive will just run at ATA33 speed, 
&gt; right?)... I'm using an ATA66 80-core ribbon... Then there's 
&gt; the whole variety of PIO and UDMA modes and so on... I'd 
&gt; really like to know what I should be seeing on this machine 
&gt; given the combination of IDE devices...


OK, here's the situation. The BIOS in this machine is crap. It's also
reasonably old (it's an Intel SR440BX board, I believe). It only does
ATA33. No worries, thinks I.

It's set up as follows:

hda: Old ATA33 Quantum Fireball ~4G
hdb: New ATA100 Seagate Barracuda 40G
hdc: Old CDROM of some description
hdd: New ATA100 Seagate Barracuda 40G

RedHat 6.0 (I think) is installed on hda -- hdb and hdd are blank.

Everything is connected with 80 core IDE ribbon. The BIOS seems to
autodetect hdb no worries. It's a slightly unconventional BIOS though,
and all it says is:

	[AUTO]
Size	36xxxMb

Which seems good enough to me.

However, hdd does this:

	[AUTO]
Size	0Mb

Which seems wrong. I've tried this with and without the CDROM connected,
so there's no interference from that on the IDE channel.

I've tried the [USER] setting, but it doesn't give me options for
setting the geometry, as far as I can tell, just the access method (LBA
mode, no of sectors to be read at once, PIO/DMA mode, etc)

Now, when I boot up, and look at /proc/ide/hd[bd]/geometry, I get some
interesting results...

It's approximately:

hdb:
physical  4683/255/63
logical   4683/255/63

hdd:
physical  4683/255/63
logical   753/255/63


(IIRC).

OK, great. I can use cfdisk on hdb no worries, but on hdd, it spits. so
I use the -c and -h options to manually set the geometry. This appears
to work ok, and as fat as cfdisk is concerned, as long as I use those
options on hdd, it's happy.

mke2fs on each -- takes forever (like half an hour or so)... no errors.

Mount each -- decides it wasn't unmounted cleanly, and wants me to
fsck... but it mounts it anyway (eventually), and appears to work, but
doesn't give me much confidence.

fsck each -- takes forever (half and hour or so again), heaps of errors,
yes to fix them all...

mount again -- same errors...

Interestingly, the errors are identical down to the digit.

OK, at this point I'm confused. The fact that hdd doesn't seem happy
isn't _that_ surprising, as I forced its geometry. But hdb? huh? 

Is there anything else I can try short of a BIOS Flash? I'm a little
reluctant to flash the BIOS, as it appears to be somewhat customised (go
LODIN -- though it's most likely just a splash image), and flashing
BIOSes is irritating (where do I get a DOS boot floppy from?)

At this stage, after writing all this email, I've downloaded the PDF
manual from intel.com, and have read half of it, and notice the text
"NOTE: do not connect an ATA device as a slave on the same IDE cable as
an ATAPI master device" hidden in the section on BIOS features.
Thrills... Well, tonight, I shall return, and make hdd hdc and hdc hdd,
and see what happens. Moral: RTFM. Sub-moral: get more sleep.
