Hi Barbara,

You can use C-u C-h i, which will prompt for an info file to load.  You
might find this easier than your method as it will allow filename
completion (tab /et al/).

I think there are quite a few people here using Emacs on a day to day
basis, so I am surprised that you didn't receive more responses.
Perhaps you might have received more responses if you had worded the
question like this:

    "Can I load a stand-alone info file into Emacs, or should I switch
    to vi, as I have heard that it has a better info file browser than
    Emacs."

This phrasing is guaranteed more responses for the following reasons:

1. It invokes the Emacs vs vi holy war.  If you are not familiar with
this, uh, phenomenon, then the article below[1] might be interesting.  I
have seen threads in newsgroups more than 100 messages long over this
topic.  Sometimes these threads don't stop until either a) someone is
compared unfavourably to Adolf Hitler, or b) someone posts fairly
complete instructions for rebinding keys to make vi behave like Emacs or
vice versa.  Some of these messages may have useful information in them.

2. It contains factual errors.  This is important, and sometime
necessary.  If your messages contain factual errors, especially obvious
ones, then many people will feel an obligation to write to you,
correcting these errors.  Occasionally they will also let some useful
information slip into these messages that may answer your question.

Regards,
Martin

&gt; For the record the answer is:
&gt; in "info" mode type "g(/fullpath/filename.info)Top"
&gt; this works a treat!
&gt; 
&gt; I eventually gleaned this from info.info node "info for experts" then
&gt; node "Expert".
&gt; 
&gt; (gee its great to be an "expert")
&gt; 
&gt; I take it from the replies that there are relatively few accually
&gt; using emacs? Myself I'm working on a hobby project (yes; I program as
&gt; a hobby!!)  involving writting a 3D FPS game for the kids. I'm using
&gt; the excellent "Crystal Space" 3D library. Anyone else into this sort
&gt; of thing??
