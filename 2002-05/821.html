i found that the playstation outlived my pc by years, it was initially
cheaper to buy, and over the time that i had both, the playstation cost me
no where near as much as the pc as it requiered no upgrades(although the
graphics were better on the pc). It was also easy enough to use that my
family managed to figure it out. it was also unbeatable for driving and
fighting games, which are great fun when drinking. The lounge is more
comfortable than the computer chair, the TV is bigger than the monitor. And
gran turismo and tekken are much more social than quake and red alert.

Both have their place, not everyone understand's linux, or even windows. but
anyone can boot a playstation.

This is the reason I REFUSE to indulge my kids with a consoles.
It is much cheaper long term to outfit them with p3 based systems (both of
which) have gef2/dvd's and 40gb drives.
IT gives daddy plenty of offsite storage ALL run Linux and the kids enjoy
the ability to play the hired ps/1 (ps/2 will be out soon too no doubt)
games via emulators or simply wait for the $20 versions a year later.

Most kids get sick of the game long term anyway.

&gt;&gt; &gt; loosing $100 on every box sold?  I know they have had to cut costs to
compete
&gt;&gt; &gt; with Sony and Nintendo but I am sure this means the portion of the
development
&gt;&gt; &gt; costs per unit that they haven't regained -rather than the difference
in
&gt;&gt; &gt; hardware manufacturing cost compared to retail price.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; P3 CPU, 40G hard drive, dvd player, Nvidia GPU, all outsourced
&gt;&gt; manufacturing, price initially set around $600, and even then extremely
&gt;&gt; slim margins for retailers. Maybe they're breaking even on the hardware,
&gt;&gt; but what's paying for the massive marketing campaign?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;There have been various articles around about Microsoft losing money on
&gt;each console they sell (eg <A HREF="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-818798.html">http://news.com.com/2100-1040-818798.html</A> -
&gt;and this was before the recent price cuts).
&gt;
&gt;Historically it hasn't been unusual for console manufacturers to sell
&gt;the playing unit at a loss and make up for it by selling games. And I
&gt;imagine at the moment getting market share in the console market is
&gt;more important for Microsoft than actually making a profit from it
&gt;(remember - get monopoly first and _then_ you can raise prices :-)
