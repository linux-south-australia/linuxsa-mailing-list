&gt; In their defense, I've known a couple of NT admins have been able to take a look
&gt; at a badly broken production system and bring it up to scratch without once
&gt; touching the "reboot" button, and without the verbose debugging information
&gt; usually available to *nix administrators. When things break and rebooting the
&gt; system doesn't work, their job is usually much harder and more frustrating than
&gt; ours.

Yeah, but thats usually only 'till they discover unix. I used to run
dos, and code in C, then when I got older I worked on NT systems, and
could usually make them do what I wanted. Then, however, I discovered
linux and through that unix, and jumped ship from the micro$oft
certified solution provider where I worked, and now try to avoid windows
as much as possible. People who have a clue generally prefer unix, and
if they arnt using it it's usually because they havnt discovered it yet.
Most the old dos gurus I used to know now run linux.
