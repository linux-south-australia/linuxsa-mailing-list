&gt; &gt; Currently now a high-end desktop replacement notebook costs around
&gt; &gt; $5000-$8000. For that kind of money you could be buying a brand name
&gt; &gt; server-class dual-CPU 2Ghz+ Pentium 4 Xeon or Athlon MP, 1Gb+ RAM, a lot
&gt; &gt; of hard drive room, and room for more expansion.

Unless you're a network engineer like me and cannot function workwise
without one.  Although I don't want the absolute in powerful notebooks, just
a laptop that's light, quick to boot, runs Visio quickly, has good battery 
life and is durable.

I have a Gateway Solo 3450 (I think I was their last Australian customer 
...) which is pretty much all of the above, except maybe battery life.

Alas, I wish there was a decent OpenSrc Visio replacement that could r/w 
Visio files.  I have yet to find one.

Only thing that bugs me about notebooks is the fact that notebook HDs on the 
whole are sloooooow.

&gt; &gt; Hiya Sam,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm also looking at getting a similar beast to replace my desktop
&gt; machine
&gt; &gt; &gt; (putting Linux as well as XP on it). Laptops nowadays are powerful
&gt; enough
&gt; &gt; &gt; for anything you can throw at them including games (especially now with
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; GF4). Good luck getting everything working with Linux. Let us know how
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; get on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Being somewhat of a tech junkie and game player, I would have to say
&gt; &gt; that a notebook does have its purpose. If you're a traveler, it's
&gt; &gt; perfect.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But as really as a desktop replacement it's going to cost around 2x-3x
&gt; &gt; of a similar desktop and it excludes major upgrades in the future. With
&gt; &gt; the kind of games coming out this year, a GeForce 4 MX will not provide
&gt; &gt; the kind of features necessary for Doom III and the like.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Currently now a high-end desktop replacement notebook costs around
&gt; &gt; $5000-$8000. For that kind of money you could be buying a brand name
&gt; &gt; server-class dual-CPU 2Ghz+ Pentium 4 Xeon or Athlon MP, 1Gb+ RAM, a lot
&gt; &gt; of hard drive room, and room for more expansion. A full GeForce 4 Ti
&gt; &gt; would easily outclass the GeForce 4 Go by a large margin in higher
&gt; &gt; resolutions, since the notebook variety is a GeForce 4 MX.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, I don't know if you require a full desktop on the go.. if you do
&gt; &gt; then a laptop would be perfect.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Joseph Tan
&gt; &gt;
