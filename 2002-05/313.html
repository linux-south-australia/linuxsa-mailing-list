Slashdot's kinda like mainstream australian newspapers:
I'll look at one while i'm waiting in a take-away-food joint, and there's
stuff there thats interesting to read, but its definately not where I look
for accurate, unbiased, and professional information.

As I said, and you've agreed, MySQL definately was the inferior product for
serious databases, several years ago. And we also agree it's been improving
since.

However, Postgres started out ahead, and has been developing continually
too.

MySQL is good for lightweight apps, personal DBs, etc... it has less
overhead, smaller footprint, etc. and is simpler to use.

Postgres, on the other hand, is comparable to professional databases in
terms of high availability, live backup, replication, high user numbers,
etc.

If those terms don't mean anything to you, go for MySQL, otherwise... ;)

&gt; * mysql was technically inferior but more widely used

&gt;
&gt; I think it was slashdot, it could have been Linux Weekly News.
&gt;
&gt; Lately, MySQL has started to introduce finer locking, transactions and
&gt; so forth. In addition the MySQL team have been working on general
&gt; optimisations within the actual database.
&gt;
&gt; If you happen to be using something like Perl's DBI::modules or PHP's
&gt; "PEAR" classes you could do a dummy site using both database systems and
&gt; put both under some form of artificial stress.
&gt;
&gt; Personally, I think both systems have merit and that there's less reason
&gt; to technically dislike MySQL than there was before. Think about the
&gt; skills you (or your company's employees) have with each system as well
&gt; and the support you can get for each one...
