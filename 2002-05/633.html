Hmmmm...

&gt; ...which is pretty amusing, as i went to school with hilary for a while
&gt; in high school (g'day mate) and he's definitely not a chick[1]. hot is
&gt; debatable tho ;-)

Hilary is definitely male; I'm not going to make any comments about
whether he's "hot" or "not hot". Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Anyway, the following events had occured:

1) RedHat 6.1 was installed on one single, large partition
2) Default runlevel was 5
3) /tmp filled up
 - and the X Font Server wouldn't start
 - and XDM wouldn't start

Now the symptoms that occured here were extraordinarily annoying. XDM
would respawn and hijack the console BEFORE you could do ctrl+alt+F2.

Bringing oneself into runlevel 1 (i.e. single user) made all of / (the
only partition) read-only and it was difficult [to say the least] to
delete anything from /tmp. I couldn't remember the major/minor numbers
for the second hard disk (classically called /dev/hdb) or any of its
partitions and RedHat 6.1's rescue mode refused to automagically find
any linux installation and automagically mount them somewhere.

Besides which, fsck run manually reported so many errors that I wasn't
confident the system was stable anyway.

Therefore, given that Hilary wanted to install IBM's JDK, and X and
other stuff, I advised him that 1Gb was probably pushing one's luck and
therefore we should free some more space and do a reinstall. Which we
did.

Hence, I split the partitions into my preferred partition scheme which
runs something like:

/boot [25Mb]
/ [300Mb]
/home [1Gb]
[swap] [2XRAM]
/var [1Gb]
/usr [The Rest]

On a production server I'd generally have:

/boot [25Mb]
/ [300Mb]
/tmp [1Gb]
/home [1Gb or more]
/var [1Gb or more]
/usr [At Least 2.5Gb]
/usr/local [At Least 2.5Gb]

...which of course puts me in the lots and lots of partitions camp.

In any case, we got the JDK and most of the stuff Hilary wanted working.
The only thing that I couldn't work out how to get working was the
mysterious internal modem which I think is a WinModem.

The funniest thing was that it appears that the JDK for Windows was
installed and was actually working but Hilary didn't know how to use it
;-P
