&gt; Thanks David,
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried the following and this is what I get:
&gt; 
&gt; [linh]% dd if=/dev/nst0 of=tape.dd
&gt; dd: /dev/nst0 device or resource busy

Oh boy, you have come across one of the hardest areas of UNIX. Tape 
handling :-)

It is not clear what sequence of operations you have tried up to this 
point, so it might be better to rewind the tape, which you should be able 
to do with:

   mt -f /dev/st0 rewind

Then you should wait for the tape to finish rewindning, and try to check 
the type of files on there.

How many tar archives do you think are on each tape?

If they were labelled, there will be a small label file at the front of 
each tape.

You can dd them off with the non-rewinding device, /dev/nst0, as david 
suggested. The non-rewinding device does not rewind the tape when you 
finish: it leaves the tape where it is. However, /dev/st0 always rewinds 
when you close the device, so doing multiple tar commands or dd commands 
will always get the same first file.
 
You will also find that there is a zero-length file mark at the end of 
each file.

So, the following commands might help:

  dd if=/dev/nst0 of=tape.1

dd will tell you how big the file was (in blocks) as well with those two 
funny numbers.

  dd if=/dev/nst0 of=tape.2

  dd if=/dev/nst0 of=tape.3

and so on. At some point you will get an error since you will go past the 
last file on the device.

Then look at the sizes of the files, and issue the file command on the 
larger of them:

   file tape.3

If it tells you that it is a gzip'd tar file or a tar file, you can use 
the appropriate command on that <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

   tar ztvf tape.3

if the file is a gzip'd tar file, or

   tar tvf tape.3

if it is an ordinary tar file.

&gt; [linh]% file tape.dd
&gt; tape.dd: can't stat 'tape.dd' (No such file or directory)
&gt; 
&gt; [linh]% tar tf tape.dd
&gt; tar: tape.dd: No such file or directory
&gt; tar: error is not recoverable: exiting now
&gt; 
&gt; What does all this mean ? Sorry, I am very new to Linux, so you really have
&gt; to hold my hand. Thanks for your quick reply.
