I had a similar problem with Windows 2000, where my drives wouldn't 
remap upon reboot, but I could access the share after reboot if I did 
net view at the DOS shell and then mapped the drive - I realized that 
the drives were trying to map "too soon." I automated this process by 
maping the drives with a VBS script:

There is the section, licensed under the GPL (Free documentation)

Hopefully this will help and allow the you to not disable  - nt acl

&gt; Heeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllpppppppppppppp,
&gt;
&gt; I am inbetween a really really really big rock and the very 
&gt; deeeeeeeeeeep ocean.
&gt;
&gt; For political reasons I cannot upgrade my samba but I need to be able 
&gt; to get Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Servers, Windows NT 4 Service Pack 
&gt; 6a Workstations, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Workstations, My 
&gt; Tru64Unix v4.0D Servers and my Linux 6.2 servers to talk to one 
&gt; another without going balistic but I have at least two problems I 
&gt; can't resolve and really need some help if anyone has run across them 
&gt; before:
&gt;
&gt; 1.      The NT Workstation can sometimes map drives to the Unix/Linux 
&gt; boxes but then the next time someone tries the same thing it wont work 
&gt; for no apparent reason.  Note:  I had an election problem on my 
&gt; servers which I fixed by setting the Tru64Unix v4.0D servers being the 
&gt; SAMBA Workgroup Masters for the two SAMBA domains.
&gt;
&gt; 2.      The Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 Workstations can map drives 
&gt; but as soon as they do, their Windows logon accounts are locked 
&gt; immediately.
&gt;
&gt; I've checked the Samba website and have found people have these 
&gt; problems and the only solutions rendered are change the registry for 
&gt; plain text passwords (which is already done on both types of 
&gt; Workstation) and ensure Windows 2000 doesn't use the wrong sort of 
&gt; transmission protocol and, of course, upgrade to the next version of 
&gt; Samba.
&gt;
&gt; At this point, some workstations are mapped and are very happy but non 
&gt; of the Windows 2000 workstations are mapped because of the problem 
&gt; I've got.
