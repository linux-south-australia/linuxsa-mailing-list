It appears that Smoothwall are moving as far away from the GPL as 
possible and will supply a 'lite version'  rather than a GPL'd version when 
it is available. (GPL'd parts that have to be available will be so)

If you look at their page they seem to indicate that their closed version 
will be better if developed in house and appear to have taken up the 
mantra of 'closed is better'.

With IPCOP, a fork of Smoothwall (that really upset them) still under the 
GPL will Smoothwall's change of license make you support alternatives, 
or does the GPL license have little bearing on your decision to promote 
one product over another?

As someone who has installed many copies of Smoothwall for private 
people and businesses and promoted them because they were GPL'd 
products, I'm not sure how I feel about Smoothwall now, I can't help 
getting the feeling that they were never really in favour of GPL's code, 
and that I have spent time and energy promoting a 'con-trick'

If they had used BSD from the start and told the community that closed 
would be the future, would they have been as successful as they are 
now?

Anyways, off the soap box :-)
As a Linux group I was wondering what others felt about this move?

As per normal with this multi-cultural group :-) BSD/MAC/Linux/flame-
masters/spell-nazi's/etal - flame jacket is on
