&gt; &gt; Older versions of GNU-TAR (most notably those shipping with RedHat 6.X)

&gt; Yes, and there are other problems of this category too. I probably should
&gt; have said "given known-good versions of gnutar, dump-for-your-OS and
&gt; Amanda, which should be used and when?"
&gt; 
&gt; I was expecting (and still do :-) that the answer to my question will talk
&gt; about things like Irix or Solaris. I have tested 64-bitness which doesn't
&gt; seem to swing it one way or another.

Maybe it is more a matter of understanding when various operating systems
stopped being compatible by default with BSD dump/restore.

Or, from another poiint of view, when (if ever) did GNU tar become good
enough to move a BSD root filesystem and get it right? I have moved root
filesystems on BSD but only by using the recommended dump/restore method.
