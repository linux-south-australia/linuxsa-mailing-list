Quoting Daryl Pilkington &lt;<A HREF="mailto:u3232@home.dialix.com">u3232@home.dialix.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; Graduates who have had a working life before Uni are much more balanced
&gt; & capable of dealing with the real-world much better.
&gt; 
&gt; It is becoming more common to go back to Uni in your 20s & 30s.
&gt; Many of my peers at Uni had families, were studying
&gt; part-time/full-time.
&gt; There backgrounds were roadies, army...
&gt; Hell, the head of my engineering school was an electrician.

That sounds promising..

I'm thinking of joining Uni when I hit 21, which I beleive is the minimum adult
entry age. I've been doing systems administration and programming professionally
for the last two years, but I really want to get involved in something a bit
more interesting than setting up Apache or writing a .JSP or .pl for J. Random
Client.

Is a University degree the right way to go, or will it just mean that I'm more
likely to be employed doing the same thing that I'm doing now? Staying on after
graduation as a researcher is what I'm aiming for, I think.
