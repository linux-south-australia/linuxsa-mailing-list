Michael!

&gt; My appologies if this message comes in HTML, hotmail have changed a
&gt; whole heap of things with their interface and reset all of my prefs...

Ah, it did. Your apologies are accepted on the following basis:

1) Hotmail Interface

The interface has become so difficult to use that working out how to
send text messages is just too much for these poor people who only using
command lines. In fact, it's so difficult that it took me 5 minutes to
work out that there doesn't appear to be a way to stop one's self from
sending HTML e-mail.

2) Microsoft Patronage

You are excused, also, because you are supporting the MSN by viewing the
banner ads and other garbage that comes with using
<A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com/.">http://www.hotmail.com/.</A> We know how much you support Microsoft and that
this really is the Microsoft Users Group [TM] in disguise.

3) Past History

You seem to enjoy talking about Telstra and ADSL. Given that we are the
"bash Telstra, decry Microsoft and talk about HTML e-mail" Linux Users
Group in SA formed solely for the purpose of supporting Microsoft Based
VPNS (MBVPNS [TM]) this is perfectly acceptable behaviour.

;-p

DSL

PS:

&gt; It seems that Telstra are using a bit of everything, some of their
&gt; servers are running Netscape Enterprise, others IIS, and most of TI
&gt; (BPD) is using FreeBSD and Linux with Apache believe it or not... I am
&gt; talking purely webservers here, looking through netcraft.com...

Oooerrr...they use various different operating systems.

That has me so excited that my pants would be on fire if I hadn't pissed
myself with unfulfilled, random abandon at about the same time.
