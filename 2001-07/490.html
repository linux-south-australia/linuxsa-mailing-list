David!

&gt; Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
&gt; Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
&gt; these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
&gt; or else switch camps and take me with you.

1) Bandwidth

I can send you a text only message containing:

---
Hi David!

Let's meet outside the Thai Restaurant on the corner of Gouger St and
King William Rd.

DSL
---

Which, if it is placed into HTML renders as:

---
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;E-Mail Message&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hi David!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's meet outside the Thai Restaurant on the corner of Gouger St and
King William Rd.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
---

It could contain the W3C Doctype as well (in fact, most mailers
correctly add it).

Both these messages say the same thing yet there are about 103
characters in text only, and 206 in the latter. Furthermore, as you
would be aware, HTML tends to be style-less so many automatic HTML
renderers will add &lt;font...&gt;&lt;/font&gt; sections often containing up to 20
characters each.

In addition, I've also seen HTML e-mails which contain backgrounds
(wallpaper is what Microsoft calls them) which add a "gif" or "jpeg"
image to the whole payload. Given the above message I could easily hike
my HTML message to many 100% times the size of the original.

At 300 e-mails per day, with an average size of 2kb, makes an average
monthly e-mail download of 17mB.

At 0.19c/mb that's close to $39 per year.

Let's simply double that average, which makes $78.

Rebel Internet charges $30 setup plus $25 maximum per month. $78 is 3
months of access gone; and that's without user download costs.

Now, if you account that to my fair share, that's 17mB off. Which
happens to be about the size of a kernel RPM download and so forth.

Did I mention that some MUA's also MIME encode a text message WITH the
HTML message. Let's say that half of my e-mails include this extra
bandwidth. We then have close to $100 per year wasted in HTML e-mail
compred to $39 for just plain.

Might I remind you that Rebel has many users, let's just say 80 for
argument's sake, and that could be $8000 per year compared to $3120.
It's not high, but why lose profits when you can avoid it? Why waste
bandwidth on HTML e-mail when I'd be better served using it to get what
I really want more efficiently?

2) Poor Implementations

There are poor implementations on both mail readers and mail composers.

If the mail composer uses styles, then Netscape 4.X under Linux (or
Windows) is likely to do very odd things, crash or simply not work. If
the mail composer specifies fonts - which they inevitably do - it can
render especially funny if you don't have those fonts.

If the reader is not able to read HTML you may see junk. Take the output
of Outlook, or Netscape Messenger's HTML e-mail and it's difficult to
find out the message. If the reader is set to execute JavaScript or
other scripting languages in e-mails by default then you're liable to
get bugs.

Naturally, this is not an argument against HTML e-mail per se - you
could fix these implementation issues up.
