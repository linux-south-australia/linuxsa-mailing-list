&gt; A very good question. I value the exam that has several elements to it. 
&gt; If the job requires practical and theoretical knowledge then the exam 
&gt; must reflect both those elements. I have researched the MSCE equivalent 
&gt; Red Hat exams. They require demonstration of practical knowledge as 
&gt; well as knowledge of the theory. This is a far better evaluation for 
&gt; accreditation.


While this is a very good form of assessment, it is hard to do. 
Especially with Linux where you do not have many organizations that can 
administer the tests. In addition, the RHCE is expensive to sit.


&gt; If MS were to adopt this standard then their evaluation would tend to 
&gt; weed out the 'book-learned' as they would not have built up the 
&gt; analytical and practical skills required for the task.


I think one can write teste that help weed out the 'book-learned' people 
as well.

 
&gt; I would be honoured to be able to have the skills and knowledge to pass 
&gt; the Red Hat testing. I believe that it would be achieved only after 
&gt; hard work and considerable hands-on experience.


Indeed.


&gt; Cheers,
