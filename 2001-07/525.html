 - 1.33% (approx) of the total list volume

Let's deduce some conclusions, mixed with some personal thoughts:

1) David Lloyd and David Newall
 - are both adept at eliciting huge responses from the mailing list
 - speaking only for myself, sometimes I do it unwittingly

PROOF:
 - My SINGLE supposed flame started almost 20% of the last 11 days'
discussion

2) Richard Russell
 - a lone voice of reason, in the wilderness
 - I've seen him there before

PROOF:
 - Neither Davd Newall or myself appear to be attempting to seriously
stop the debate, yet I would suspect Richard is

Greg Lehey
 - a known malformed e-mail hater
 - has been surprisingly quiet on this subject

PROOF:
 - in the pudding; he's found third from the most prolific poster on
this subject

Dale Long
 - speaks the second longest on our favourite topic
 - actually proposes a solution

PROOF:
 - again view the figures
 - and he's been proposing a solution for ages

Andrew Reid
 - has produced a humungous document which, in online readability terms,
is about as readable as the "House of Representative Practice", which is
written in at most 8 point font, at least 1/2 the size again of A4 and
many thousands of pages long
 - is obviously dedicated to making this list a better place but lost in
the wilderness

PROOF:
 - well, the discussion centers mainly around his posts
 - his God has definitely forsaken him


What have I proven?

* that it is possible in a mailing list for one, or two person
deliberately or inadvertently working in tandem, to create 20% of total
traffic
* it is possible, if you look at the content, that discussing matters
such as group norms is not the best thing to do via e-mail; such
discussions happen much more efficiently face to face

In addition, I hope to not have to release a second edition of this
e-mail, entitled "absurd statistics"...
