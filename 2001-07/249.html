&gt; &gt; Hi, I currently have an LT Winmodem and am thinking of upgrading to a
&gt; &gt; hardware modem. I am aware of a c code to use which will enable the
&gt; &gt; Winmodem
&gt; &gt; to become a near working Linmodem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also I wish to upgrade to a 32 MB video card. I was going for a TNT Riva
&gt; &gt; 32
&gt; &gt; AGP or thereabouts for $100.00
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone care to make some cost effective suggestions of the above two
&gt; &gt; mentioned hardware items that operate under RH Linux 7?
&gt; 
&gt; The drivers from the nvidia site work really well for the TNT2 card, and
&gt; XFree86 4.x also supports it. Don't know about RH, but Mandrake 8 supports
&gt; it with no problems. For the money, it's a pretty good card.

Mandrake 8 only supports the 2d out the box, although that does work
well and fast. If you want the openGL then you need to compile and
install the actual nvidia drivers, which funnily enough also work well
in both 2d and 3d. Anoying bit is having to recompile them each time you
upgrade kernel though. Im running a tnt2 ultra.
