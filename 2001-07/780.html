Hi Dale,

Thanks for the response.

I downloaded a distro called Peanut Linux but it came down as a tar.gz. 
When opened it is showing an 'out' file. Now from my uni days I think I 
need to make that into something but I am still not sure.

When I grabbed it from ZDnet they mentioned that an ISO was available 
but I have not yet found that.

The reason I was interested in it was the claimed space required of 
only 148 Meg. That may be too low to provide the simple usability we 
need. Usability costs programming outside of the basic no-frills 
service.

Another problem with various distros would be the ability to fix things 
when it goes wrong. We need to be able to lock onto a distro that 
provides simple tools for repair as well as tools for simple and stable 
operation. All our IT Support staff (including me) are volunteers and 
some of them are still learning about computers and support.

I don't envisage committing big resources of the project to supporting 
new users ad infitum. That would detract the volunteers from the main 
thrust of the project which is getting computers into houses and 
getting the public to be accessing those systems on a regular basis. 

Putting a computer into a house where only the immediate family 
accesses it is a lesser result for us in the short term. Eventually we 
hope to be able to leave a computer with a volunteer family for 12 
months then find a way to help them purchase it so the skills remain in 
the community.


BTW, are you part of CBSA?

&gt; CBSA are considering what CBVic are using, a custom version of Debian.
&gt; I am looing at several mini distros such as LRP and Freesco for 
&gt; gatewayboxes and mini servers.
