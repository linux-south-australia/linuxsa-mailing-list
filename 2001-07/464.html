&gt;  &gt; You also don't have to end up with a soul-destroying contract and you can

&gt;
&gt;true, you can choose a 3 month contract though even with the higher
&gt;install fee (by the time you include and ORHH install and buying
&gt;a NetJet card it's about the same as the ORHH startup costs).
&gt;I agree no contract at all is better but it's a relatively minor
&gt;point.

For the sake of accuracy, I would like to point out that some ADSL 
providers don't insist on a 'soul destroying' (or any other form of 
long term) contract.

&gt;  &gt;Having Telstra ADSL on a line now may
&gt;  &gt; make it difficult to use a different providers DSL offering in the future
&gt;  &gt; once the market becomes competitive.

Only if you undertake a service with a long contract term in it  - 
see above. Other choices already exist.

&gt;
&gt;I wish ORHH was a better deal than adsl but no matter how I look at
&gt;it I keep coming to the conclusion that adsl is the better deal.
&gt;

That isn't necessarily the case; The answer  depends on your own 
personal combination of answers to the following questions:

- What speed is 'fast enough' for you? (i.e. of 64k or 128k is fast 
enough, ORHH is probably cheaper, if you want to go faster, ORHH 
can't get you there)

- How many megs per month do you expect to download? (very small 
amounts can often be included in some form of 'deal' by your ISP, 
very large amounts attract volume discounts. In the middle, the cost 
tends to be a bit higher)

Cheers,
Simon
