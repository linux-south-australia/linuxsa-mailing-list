&gt;&gt; Wrong.  Completely wrong.  And by the way, SCSI disks DO support
&gt;&gt; low level formatting.
&gt;
&gt; "The Format Unit command (operation code x'04') writes zeros to
&gt; all sectors of the Logical Unit."  - One of IBM's SCSI storage
&gt; PDF books, and not dissimilar to the dd command I gave above.

I haven't read your particular, "One of IBM's SCSI storage PDF books,"
but if I accept your interpretation then it is interesting that IBM would
have a SCSI drive that doesn't do a low level format.  The SCSI standard
says that the "FORMAT UNIT command formats the media into addressable
logical blocks," which I have never heard of as meaning anything other
than a low-level format.  The command is optional; but if it's going to
be implemented it seems wrong to do something other than format the media.

I could imagine a technical writer describing a low-level format as
"writing zeroes to all sectors of the drive."  Perhaps your IBM drive
really does do a low-level format.  Even assuming it doesn't, which
I'm prepared to do, finding an example, or even a lot more, is not the
same as, "Most drives don't support the concept of a "low level format"
these days" (your original claim.)  SCSI drives traditionally have,
and in my experience still do, support low level formatting.


&gt; And I'm still curious as to how RAID data could be stored that
&gt; you can't get at.

Simple, Daryl, in fact obvious in hindsight: The SCSI controller is
intelligent, and it remaps block oriented commands, reserving one or
more blocks for it's own private use.
