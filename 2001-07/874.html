&gt; &gt; I've been making some modifications to a tool called protopkg, which
&gt; &gt; takes source code and makes a slackware package from it.  My first job
&gt; &gt; has been to make it read from one build file, instead of three.
&gt; 
&gt; first question: why? I would have thought that there may be a reason why
&gt; it's in three files (perhaps because putting it in one simply won't work..
&gt; but more likely because you want to share some of these files around, but
&gt; not all of them -- three files may be the most logical way to arrange the
&gt; code.)

I am extending protopkg to make it into a tool which will be used in the
situation of a ports system.  The reason I want one file instead of
three is becuase that way it is very easy to have multiple versions (ie.
multuple files) of a port in its directory - better to have three files
for three versions instead of nine.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Previously, it had a 'prototype' file, in which there was certain
&gt; &gt; variables, as well as package specific compile() and install()
&gt; &gt; functions.  The other files it could use were 'sources' and 'rules.'  In
&gt; &gt; each of these files, there were various lines of text in between two
&gt; &gt; flags, in the following format:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; flag:
&gt; &gt; text
&gt; &gt; text
&gt; &gt; text
&gt; &gt; :flag
&gt; 
&gt; what type of text? Is this bash commands, environment variable settings, or
&gt; some other config settings?

In the case of the files which were separate from the prototype file
originally, there was just text - for one, a URI and an MD5 checksum per
line, and for the other, a keyword and a path to a file.  The text
between the flags is handled by other functions in the protopkg script.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is a read_rules() function that extracts the information between
&gt; &gt; the flag name passed to it as an argument.  This is it below:
&gt; 
&gt; where? in the prototype file?

No.  The read_rules() function is in the protopkg script/program.  The
prototype file itself is never run, its functions are called by
protopkg.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; read_rules() {
&gt; &gt;    sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^$/d' | sed -n "/^${1}:/,/^:${1}$/p" |
&gt; &gt;    grep -Fv "${1}:" | grep -Fv ":${1}" | sed -e "s/^[ \t]*//"
&gt; &gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; ok, in playing around with this, I think that the read_rules() function just
&gt; reads the stuff between the flags, and prints it to stdout, right?
&gt; 

That's the one.

&gt; &gt; So, in order to combine all three files into one, I made another set of
&gt; &gt; flags to encapsulate that which was originally alone in the 'protopkg'
&gt; &gt; file (flag name is 'package') and then appended the other two files to
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; ok, so it (the (new, modified) prototype file?) looks like:
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------
&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;bash program with read_rules function defined&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; package:
&gt; flag:
&gt; text
&gt; text
&gt; :flag
&gt; 
&gt; anotherflag:
&gt; text
&gt; text
&gt; :anotherflag
&gt; :package
&gt; 
&gt; -------------
&gt; 
&gt; right?

No - read_rules() and the other functions are contained withing the
`protopkg` script.  Essentially, the prototype file contains information
on how to build the source code tarball in question, along with some
other things.

An example would look like this:

------

package:
VERSION=2.0
PROGNAME=xmms-$VERSION-$ARCH-$BUILD
BUILD=1
ARCH=`/bin/arch`

DESC="\
Info about \n \
the package"

STRIPBIN=y
STIRPLIB=y
SETATTR=y

compile() {
 tar zxvf $CWD/xmms-$VERSION
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
 make
}

install() {
 make install
}

:package

sources:
 <A HREF="http://www.xmms.org/xmms-2.0.tar.gz">http://www.xmms.org/xmms-2.0.tar.gz</A>
:sources

conf:
 /etc/xmms.conf
:conf

---------

The text between the 'package' flags is the stuff called by protopkg to
compile and install the package. 100% bash.  The rest is not bash code,
just lines of data that the protpkg scrip interprets.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem starts here.  Originally, the entire prototype file was
&gt; &gt; sourced, which was OK since it contained only Bash stuff.  However, now
&gt; &gt; it doesn't, so I want to use the read_rules() function to just source
&gt; &gt; the stuff in between the 'package' flags.  My failed attempt is below.
&gt; 
&gt; This code (below) is from the new prototype file, right? or are you running
&gt; it in your interactive shell (afaik, there's no reason to source something
&gt; in a script...)?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
