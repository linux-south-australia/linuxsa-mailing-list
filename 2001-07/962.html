Hi All,
    It sounds to me that what you need is the O'Reilly book
on Linux and Lego Mindstorms. For the cost of a not very
cheap Mindstorms set and a book, you should have enough to
get started. There are also some very good books at Dick
Smith Electronics on Robots at the moment that include
software clips in Visual Basic which should point you in the
right direction, and then all you have to do is port them to
Linux. There are several HOWTOs available also on
Mindstorms, and Device Drivers that would come in handy. If
you are already into electronics, I know that there are
communication boards that plug into your PC that you build
as a kit that are aimed at just what you want and are also
available at DSE and other places. Pretty much it should
cost you about A$250 for a mindstorms kit, a com card kit,
and a couple of books, and then you should have everything
that you need. If you want to do it on the cheap, then I
would recommend a book from DSE and an old computer of some
description and some parts and away you go. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Hardware programming newbie


&gt; Hello List Members,
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if someone could point me in the right
direction...
&gt;
&gt; What I am interested in doing is building a basic remote
controlled computer
&gt; / robot / thingy.
&gt; Mainly for fun and the thrill of learning at the moment,
but eventually it
&gt; may have usefull applications around the home.
&gt; Where do I start? I have basic experience in electronics,
like making
&gt; circuit boards and soldering etc and I'm willing to put
extra effort into
&gt; studying and reading relevent texts, once I know where to
find them d;-j
&gt;
&gt; Basically I would like to be able to control servo's,
motors and switches
&gt; from a host computer, while getting signals back from
various sensors for
&gt; light, water levels, sound levels etc. Where should I
start investigating
&gt; the kinds of electronic componants I need, how to connect
them to my
&gt; computer etc.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any assistance you can offer.
&gt;
&gt; Jay
