Hi all,

&gt; &gt;    owner
&gt; &gt; This  module  attempts to match various characteristics of
&gt; &gt; the packet creator, for locally-generated packets.  It  is
&gt; &gt; only valid in the OUTPUT chain, and even this some packets
&gt; &gt; (such as ICMP ping responses) may have no owner, and hence
&gt; &gt; never match.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that it's only valid on the output chain though.  I suspect that
&gt; this means you can only account for outgoing packets - can anyone
&gt; confirm this?  (I've been planning to test this, but haven't had a
&gt; chance yet)

The output chain in IPTables is only for locally generated packets as
opposed to IPChains/IPFWADM where both locally generated packets and
forwarded packets hit the output chain (ie. anything going to an
interface).  Therefore when it says "some packets" it is not refering
to packets passing thru the box (ie being forwared) as they don't hit
the output chain anyway.  It is referring to those special cases like
ICMP, as it mentioned.  

Interestingly you can't do a similar thing in the input chain as the
there may be multiple processes listening (think tcpdump).  You could
list all processes I guess.

Regards,
Michael

PS. Sorry I didn't pick up on this earlier.  My laptop has been a little
flakey ..  seg fault here, bus error there :-(
