&gt; I agree, this will always be done no matter what happens.
&gt; What I would like to see, well not see, is other list users also posting
&gt; to the HTML offender (and on list). Because the list server has already
&gt; done it.

That's got some merrit. However, I can't see the problem with 5
responses, each containing "Read <A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html</A>" if
they're all answering the question.

&gt; I would say that the stripping of HTML can be questionable in the sense
&gt; that it might make the LinuxSA list look more of a dictatorship because it
&gt; uses an automated potentially information corrupting method to enforce the
&gt; desire of some of its users to have a HTML free list.

Mmmm...

&gt; I don't think it is David as such, I get the impression that many of the
&gt; people on this list come from a unix culture based that for both asthetic,
&gt; security and bandwidth reasons, do not like HTML.

It's not just David. David just seems to be one of those that objects to
the HTML as well as answering the question. Some of the other "UNIX
People" out there just hit the delete key (or have a Procmail filter set
up to send the HTML mails to /dev/null) when they receive HTML mail.

&gt; I would use my code, and test it full else where before even contemplating
&gt; placing on the list, if we (as a list group) ever decided to actuall want
&gt; to use it.

I'd hope so! The problem is, no matter how well you test it, there will
almost -always- be something that causes an interuption to the service.
It may not always be something that takes the list out for a
day-at-a-time, but the point is that there would most likely be an
interuption.

&gt; I  agree with what you say here. I think a short friendly
&gt; reminder that is welcoming to new people and a nice reminder for regular
&gt; users who somehow accidentally send HTML is good. And it can make 
&gt; reference the list 'policy'. I think policy to too harsh a word, we really
&gt; want a 'list of suggestions on how to happily coexist in the LinuxSA
&gt; list'. It would be good to see these on the LinuxSA site.

Spot on. There is not anybody that I can think of that is going to be
too draconian about the whole issue of HTML mail. People don't like it,
but most of us are fairly resonable people when we're peeled away from
our computers :-)

Whatsmore, the word "Policy" makes us look like another Users-Group that
gets overly caught up in paperwork and corporate red-tape.

&gt; And you might want to append to it something about the list currently
&gt; reminding users about users who send HTML will be notified. So other
&gt; experienced users who are new to the list wont flame the sender.

Does the Introduction cover this satisfactorily? It doesn't speak of
HTML mail specifically, but does talk of incorrectly formatted messages.

&gt; I do not want to dictate how the list should be run or how the maintainers
&gt; do their work. 

Neither do I. We need to set some reasonable expectations for the list,
though.
