This is kinda hmm-ing..

use.gov

I'd heard the whitehouse.gov website had changed their IP addressing due
to the latest IIS security hole, but I didn't realize they had changed
their hosting body altogether.  They were originally using Netscape
Enterprise Server.. But have since moved to what Netcraft.com/whats is
detecting as Linux.

Their website seems all well and good, and working :-)  I'm sure a large
group of people running insignificant IIS webservers would not have
patched their IIS's.  Securityfocus.com recently sent out a major email
about this exploit too :)

The amount of exploits that focus around "Unchecked Buffers", is beyond
me.  I'm no programmer, but how could you not realize that after hole
after hole after hole in your "unchecked buffers" that it might be time
to start "checking" them?
