Hi John,
I don't know about ejecting Cd's from a slot drive but I do know that 
ejecting Cd's from a normal tray drive can be dangerous.

My boss in Wellington (NZ) had his desktop unit close to him while he 
was working on something. He made a mistake and clicked a button which 
ejected the CD tray. It ejected fine, straight into his fresh cup of 
coffe he had just made and sat in front of the 'puter!

The opening CD tray knocked the full cup of coffee straight over and 
into both the under-desk file drawers which he had also only just 
opened.

Don't ask just how many important company files he had to wash down 
that day. Just believe me when I say that he is now very particular in 
just where on the desk he places his coffee &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,

Ian
