Hmmm...

&gt;  &gt; There's a teency-weency problem with this.
&gt;  &gt; It's a good idea if you always have the same monitor on each machine,
&gt;  &gt; but in my case, I often either remove the monitor or swap monitors.
&gt;  &gt; In that case, there's a danger of not being able to control
&gt;  &gt; my machine on boot-up.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't follow -- Why is there a problem with that?

I have a Titan Graphics Reactor with a 119-3916 workstation fixed
frequency monitor. The TTR, under Windows, appears to intercept the
screen signals, mangle them to work with the monitor and it functions
correctly. Unfortunately, I can't work out how to convince (stupid) X to
run the monitor so I am stuck running an X Server remotely on my older
computer.

Now, if I startx on my main computer with the work station monitor and X
crashes (which it inevitably does) I cannot retrieve my system _at all_.
It's called hard reboot. Hence, after starting X the only control I have
is ctrl-alt-del which is a total pain.

There are some situations where startx can bomb you out...

DSL

&gt; If you boot a machine up with an X configuration which doesn't work with
&gt; the timings appropriate for whatever monitor you have plugged in, you
&gt; hit CTRL-ALT-F1 and login on a console, frob the modelines, and
&gt; kill the X server (xdm will then restart it for you).

PS:

That is if your X configuration doesn't pull your whole video rendering
out from underneath your feet. I should add that I can still SSH or
telnet into said machine but I can't get a console (rendered as you'd
expect as opposed to a badly horizontal synced set of lines) without a
reboot.

So if we want to be pedantic - and I am on the PendanticSA List - I
still have some resemblance of control over a part of my computer but
otherwise I don't.

&gt;  &gt; I've foudn that the options on xdm, gdm and kdm are often
&gt;  &gt; quite restrictive too. Like all "user friendly" systems,
&gt;  &gt; they make things easier if you want to do what's in the menus,
&gt;  &gt; but not if you're an individual.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no menus in xdm.  xdm's sole and only job is to manage your
&gt; display for the purposes of session management.
&gt; 
&gt; It gives you a login window, with a username field and a password field
&gt; and nothing else.  When you login it runs .xsession in your home directory
&gt; (if it's executable), or a system .xsession.  So you can configure it as
&gt; much or as little as you want.
