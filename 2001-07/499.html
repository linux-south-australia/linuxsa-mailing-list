Rendering HTML in a text-only terminal isn't very satisfactory.
For those of us with shell accounts, there no alternative to text-based
terminals -- well, not unless hellstra & co want to offer up mega-fast adsl
with no bandwidth limits.. *grin*

Also, HTML has become associated with cluebies and gits. I have at least two
retailers who have me on a mailling list and spam me with absolutely
horrendous html emails.. we're talking about 10 (windows) fonts on a page,
all huge, with bold, underline, and colours changing every second word.

Needless to say i now filter them straight into my spam folder since its
almost easier to read the html source than their mess, but the point is that
i believe the message is more important than the medium.

If you have something to say, you can say it perfectly well in text without
requiring the ability to put annoying backgrounds and a variety of garish
colours. I believe things like that are mainly used by people who have a
poor grasp of language skills and need to distract the reader from realising
this.

&gt;
&gt; Okay.  This rather boils down to, "we don't want to receive HTML mail
&gt; but can't give a cogent reason why not."  Personal taste, I suppose,
&gt; is a reason nobody can argue with, but it hardly advances a reasoned
&gt; debate on the pros and cons of HTML.
&gt;
&gt; It's obvious that I have been rethinking my antipathy towards HTML email,
&gt; and that I'm finding it hard to continue to justify it.  Frankly you
&gt; pointing out issues such as mailing list trailers, and then saying,
&gt; "yes you could fix that easily but doing so would be counter-productive,"
&gt; doesn't really help.  (I don't mean that in a nasty way, you understand.)
&gt;
&gt; Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
&gt; Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
&gt; these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
&gt; or else switch camps and take me with you.
