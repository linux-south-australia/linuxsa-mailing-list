&gt; Right now I'm getting a very nasty hacker attack from this address:
&gt; resentment.trinity.sa.edu.au (203.87.98.27)
&gt; Does anyone on this mailing list happen to know anything about this?

Do you ever get the feeling that people don't like you, Mr Kennington?

Perhaps one of our users couldn't wait for another gut-busting installment of
"The Gospel According to Alan", and so launched an overt 'attack' in the hope
that you might post to the list yet again?

You are a recognised computer security expert.  As such, I am surprised that you
posted this 'attack' to the list without first bothering to check with the
people responsible for the domain.  We might well have been in the middle of our
own investigation.  Your post to a public list might have sent this 'very nasty
hacker' on the run.  This is not the case, but may well have been.

The logfile you posted to this list appears to be nothing more than a port-scan
of a single machine of yours.  On its own it means absolutely nothing.  It
should be noted that port-scanning is NOT a crime.  It should also be noted that
without the logs from EVERY router betwixt trinity.sa.edu.au and topology.org,
you have no way of knowing that the 'attack' did infact come from Trinity
College.

The words 'Alan Kennington' and 'fuckwit' are quite often used in the same
sentence by members of the IT department here.
