&gt; &gt; WHY are you bothering with M$?  Linux or FreeBSD
&gt; &gt; I wish that was the case 
&gt; 
&gt; It IS the case!
&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt; So you accept the standard of the LOWEST common
&gt; denominator (because it
&gt; is common?).  Sorry, I don't understand the logic.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are trying to help the community gain computer
&gt; skills. 
&gt; 
&gt; Then give them the richest experience you can, not
&gt; the most
&gt; impoverished.

Many of the end users this of project would be most
interested in having the PC for the use of their
children so they dont get left behind at school, or to
learn about IT etc. So proably many will be either
schoolkids or students.

Most schools are, by choice or not, tied to Microsoft
due to government stupidity, lack of resources, etc,
e,etc.

For older people who wish to learn, most TAFE or WEA
courses are focussed on M$ and other commercial
packages.

You and I know that much of Linux is so much better
technically, but the reality is that the rest of the
world doesnt/wont/cant know/care and we have to adapt
to that at the moment.

Unlike most of us IT folk the average punter just
wants to use the computer to get something done.

&lt;snipped&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; For goodness sake!  Have you not used Linux since
&gt; RedHat 5.2 or earlier?
&gt; Like many others I use the Gnome GUI/Redhat 6.2.  I
&gt; can't think of
&gt; anything simpler to operate.  Double-click on a .wav
&gt; file in the File
&gt; manager and the music plays!  Insert a CD and it
&gt; either commences
&gt; playing (audio) or a file manager is automatically
&gt; invoked to show
&gt; you the CD contents (data).  Can you think of
&gt; anything less daunting?

As much as it pains me to say it I get more GPFs using
Gnome or KDE or Mozilla than Windows :-( The upside at
least is they dont take the whole system with them...

Even the latest RedHat 7.1... it detects your USB
mouse but you still need to manually edit gpm.conf to
get it working properly after a reboot; the fonts suck
unless you are capable of deciphering info from
multiple sources on getting TTF to work properly; my
digital camera doesnt work properly with it because no
one has written a driver yet...; I cant fax from Linux
using my MFC; and I still get word documents that
_crash_ KWord and just wont load on SO5.2. I cant
print colour graphics to my BJC4000.

This doesnt mean the above are not cabable of being
fixed in Linux. I just dont have time to bother fixing
these things at the moment, it is easier to use
Win4Lin or reboot.

I can cope with these kinds of problems, but its a bit
much to expect a newbie or a person whose life doesnt
revolve around a PC to do so.

Hence the need to try and set up a Linux system, which
will provide robustness and zero-licensing problems,
that is also capable of providing an extremely user
friendly environment for learning and actual
usefulness. 

At least we can run SO on both Windows and Linux
platforms, providing some commonality across all of
our systems making training easier. 
Then when Joe Blogs has a Linux PC and his mate has a
Windows PC, at least they have the same software and
can help each other learn
