&gt; Is any one running Linux on a laptop on this list?
&gt; I'm thinking of buying one, but being poor I'll be
&gt; stuck with a choice of
&gt; generic model runing an AMD k6-2 450 MHz.
&gt; There isnt any issues with Linux running on AMD
&gt; chips is there?

I'm running both Debian 2.2r0 & RedHat7.1 fine on an
AMD K6-2-500 no problems. (Not on a laptop, however.)
This includes kernel 2.2.18 built with 6x86
optimizations.

&gt; As far as my (limited) understanding goes, as long
&gt; as it's an x86 it will
&gt; go, right???
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of any computer shops in Adelaide
&gt; offering Linux
&gt; pre-installed?
&gt; Or what about Linux friendly (or at least aware)
&gt; computer shops.

I_hope_this_wont_start_another_endless_flame_war=1&gt;

I can quote to custom-build you a system with Linux
pre-installed if you want. It'll have a reset switch
as well.

&lt;shameless_plug&gt;


&gt; My experience has been hearing how my zip drive,
&gt; buzz card and cd burner
&gt; would never work with linux!

Funny, they all work with mine. 

I use the buz to watch TV while on my PC (bit of a
waste but I somehow never seem to have the time to do
video production :-()

The buz took a bit of fiddling, but when I upgraded to
kernel 2.2.17 it all got a lot easier (or so it seemed
to me.) Let us know if you have any problems with it.

My parallel port zip drive (ppa module) actually runs
very significantly faster under Linux than under
Windows 98SE.

&gt; Then there's the "how is your computer going to turn
&gt; off" senario with a
&gt; King William Street retailer.

??? If he was selling you a
[Compaq/IBM/HP/Dell/Packard], I hope you asked him
where the reset button was for when it crashes ...

&lt;rant&gt;
(If I had $1 for the number of times a new Windows
Compaq/IBM/HP/Packard PC has crashed and I have had to
teach someone that they have to hold the power button
down for 6 seconds, instead of just pressing the reset
switch... )
&lt;/rant&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Do we have many options for training / certification
&gt; in Adelaide?
&gt; I'd like to do a RHCE course and maybe even get LPI
&gt; or SAIR certification in
&gt; the future.
&gt; What are my options in Adelaide? So far I've been
&gt; relying on the net,
&gt; HOWTO's manpages, luck etc.
&gt; But none of those things has offered me any
&gt; certification d;-)

I cant help you there. I have been thinking of doing
this myself at some stage.. probably someone else on
the list will know.


&gt; 
&gt; And finally, are there any people working on a local
&gt; (Australian) version of
&gt; linux?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your time everyone.
&gt;
