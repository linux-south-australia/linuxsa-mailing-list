&gt; OK, I would suggest IMAP...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't believe the two ISPs in question (SENet and iPrimus) support
IMAP.
&gt;
&gt; but in that case, I suspect you are stuck with your present situation...
&gt; IIRC, your main issue with the current situation is that messages get
&gt; downloaded once per OS, which is a pain, particularly for big messages...
&gt; I'd suggest manually deleting big messages (or perhaps, try looking into
&gt; selectively removing them from the server...)

Unfortunately, it's not only the big messages that are a problem, it's also
the large number of messages I have to multiply-delete, such as from
LinuxSA, which is overly tedious and time-consuming (as much as I enjoy
reading the entertaining and informative banter, once is generally enough!).

It really seems to only come down to the fact that the
last-message-downloaded tracking aspect is what's standing between me and my
idyllic (well, satisfactory) mail management. I'd rather hoped that, given
the must-run-under-Linux-too requirement, that the odds would have been in
my favour (in as much as that the tracking would be done in a shareable way,
i.e. stored in a file rather than tucked away inaccessibly in a registry
hive somewhere). Sadly this doesn't appear to be the case.

I can't be the first person to face this dilemma? However, since the
prospects are not looking good of finding a solution using POP servers,
would anyone care to recommend an ISP that supports IMAP?
