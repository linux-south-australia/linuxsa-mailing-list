&gt; "Principle of Least Surprise" is a well-known principle, and in general,
&gt; should be adhered to, as it is sensible. It's one reason why the Mac
&gt; interface has historically been seen as better than most others -- there are
&gt; consistent behaviours, and once you know the interface, almost every program
&gt; acts in the same manner...

"and once you know the interface"

Well  surely  you  can  treat a list as the same. ie once you know the
interface, you get consistent behaviour from every message you send to
it.  And  before  you  go  saying  that  another  list  might treat it
differently, you could say that another list is a different object and
has  a  different  interface,  which, once learned will respond in the
same manner within it's own realm.

The  human  brain (well ok, some human brains) are incredibly adept at
coping with change and treating similar objects as separate entities.

But  anyway,  enough  of this pointless banter, I've had my say, which
was on  my personal preference for how mailing lists should work, and I
can see that the majority of respondents don't feel the same way about
it  (not  that  there's  anything  wrong with that). We've pretty much
covered  the  topic thoroughly, so I don't see the point in continuing
this  thread (some might say I shouldn't have said anything else, they
may be right, but a discussion has got to have a proper ending... ;)
