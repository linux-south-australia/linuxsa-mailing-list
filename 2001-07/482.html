&gt; It's counterproductive because we (most of us) don't want to receive
&gt; HTML mail.

Okay.  This rather boils down to, "we don't want to receive HTML mail
but can't give a cogent reason why not."  Personal taste, I suppose,
is a reason nobody can argue with, but it hardly advances a reasoned
debate on the pros and cons of HTML.

It's obvious that I have been rethinking my antipathy towards HTML email,
and that I'm finding it hard to continue to justify it.  Frankly you
pointing out issues such as mailing list trailers, and then saying,
"yes you could fix that easily but doing so would be counter-productive,"
doesn't really help.  (I don't mean that in a nasty way, you understand.)

Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
or else switch camps and take me with you.
