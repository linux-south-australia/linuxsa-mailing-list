&gt; That happens a lot in the computing industry. How would it feel if you

How would I feel? Probably pretty annoyed with whoever got upset about
it, seeing as I do try my best not to do such things.

What you say is correct, though. It -does- happen, especially as many of
us are still hammering away at keyboards into the wee hours of the
night.

&gt; Especially when you are a newbie. I do know that you know.
&gt; I guess I am reiterating it for the list at large, all of whom know too.

Oh, I know. However, you must conceed that these "newbies" aren't
generally known around here, thus it's hard to gauge whether or not they
need "telling".

As a footnote, I don't think "newbies" get flamed around here. It's a
misinturpretation by some that they are.
