Dammit, you can't say "please stop" a flame war before I even see it.
I'm entitled to my flame^H^H^H^H^Hopinion too.  I'll say it now and
hope that nobody follows up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe we could have a 'linuxSAadmin' list for discussing how the list is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; discussions and technical related flame wars.
&gt;&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any reason or opinion, or do you just feel like saying no today?
&gt;
&gt; Every possible reason or opinion to support that statement has already
&gt; been canvassed, at length, several times.  Read the archives, or ask
&gt; him privately for further explanations, or go stick your head in a pig,
&gt; or do *anything*, but please don't offer further encouragement to people
&gt; who, given the opportunity, will repeat the same points they've been
&gt; repeating during this thread since it started.
&gt;
&gt; The whole topic is excruciatingly boring.

At a certain level, yes.

Obviously we have a number of misunderstandings here:

1.  Nobody's trying to segregate newbies.  But we are trying to teach
    them, and explaining the evilness of HTML is one of them.
    Explaining that it may also piss off the only person who is
    capable of answering the message should also help.

2.  Starting additional mailing lists will reduce the traffic, but it
    will also reduce the effectiveness of the lists.  FreeBSD has both
    a questions@ and a newbies@ mailing list; they tend to get used
    for the same thing by different people.  I'd really like to can
    the newbies@ mailing list and migrate the people to questions@,
    and maybe find a non-intrusive way of explaining that you need a
    certain amount of intelligence to perform certain functions, such
    as running a computer or sending a mail message, but we're
    prepared to help with lack of experience.

And now I'll get back to the "how to get best results" thread.  Please
don't answer this message unless you have something Very Important to
say.
