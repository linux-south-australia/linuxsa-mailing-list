The redhat kickstart program can be tailored for a custom install. Select the
packages and make the kickstart file.  Once made the rest of your installs can
be identical.  Spend the time learning kickstart with redhat and there is no
need to even have CDROMs. All the installs can be done over a network if
desired.

There is also graphical program called ksconfig,  it might need installed
(RPM'd) that will get you going with ease. It's a matter of a few hours
reading and then saving tens/hundreds of hours, on future installs.

I think Suse has a good install program too,

Good luck

&gt; I think that Debian suits that well. Redhat, while trimable can be too
&gt; big.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Another problem with various distros would be the ability to fix things
&gt; &gt; when it goes wrong. We need to be able to lock onto a distro that
&gt; &gt; provides simple tools for repair as well as tools for simple and stable
&gt; &gt; operation. All our IT Support staff (including me) are volunteers and
&gt; &gt; some of them are still learning about computers and support.
&gt;
&gt; Debian provides a good automated package update system.
&gt;
&gt; You can then put things like KOffice or Star Office on top of that
&gt; distibution on teh machines that can handle them. Or mini-RTF editors on
&gt; smaller machines.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; BTW, are you part of CBSA?
&gt;
&gt; Sort of.
