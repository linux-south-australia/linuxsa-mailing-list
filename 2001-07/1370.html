Keep a list of offending IPs and drop the connection as soon
as you hear from them.  When this is all over, you can delete
them from the list.

I use the Indy components in Delphi/Kylix to write web servers,
and you can do the same thing.  Using Apache limits you to the
standard line of connection methods, which means you have
more risk of 'DoS' attacks, as you put it.  Using your own
server methods lets you respond by blocking IPs again the
next time a new virus/worm screws up your system.

By the way, I'm not responding directly to you because
I don't want to be put into your address book!

&gt; In case you have been holidaying on Planet Zed this month:
&gt;
&gt;  - SirCam is yet another Outlook / Outlook Express virus which
&gt; repeatedly auto-mails itself to every address it can find. Along with
&gt; a file randomly selected from the victim's computer.
&gt;
&gt;  - Code Red targets a known NT4/Win2000 Internet Information Server
&gt; hole to take total control of the target machine. It then spawns 100
&gt; instances of itself to scan "random" IP addresses for more victims;
&gt; and does a few other things too. The original Code Red generated the
&gt; same "random" list every time. There seems to be a variant which is
&gt; nastier.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; And now to their effects:
&gt;
&gt; So far my Procmail mangler has intercepted over 1,000 SirCam-generated
&gt; mails totalling 340MB from over 300 different addresses. Undoubtedly
&gt; there was some good blackmail material in that lot; but I'm now
&gt; running a cronjob to stop my mail filling its partition.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, the IP of _my_ webserver is on the original Code Red's
&gt; list; so Apache dutifully adds about 500 bytes to its error log every
&gt; time it gets probed. I estimate that my Apache wasted about two thirds
&gt; of its process time dealing with Code Red connections last week. I'm
&gt; sorely tempted to run another cronjob which adds those IPs to the
&gt; firewall.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Between them these two viruses are using a significant fraction of my
&gt; bandwidth (no ADSL out here...). I've come to the depressing
&gt; conclusion that they will cost me a bundle in data charges (and disk
&gt; space, CPU time, etc) as well as having a noticeable DoS effect;
&gt; because the actual transmission of this crap to my end cannot be
&gt; prevented.
&gt;
&gt; Any thoughts on solving this dilemma? Apart from disconnecting my
&gt; server from the Net?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt; Fraser Farrell
&gt;
&gt; ps - another 7 SirCam messages have arrived while I typed this!
&gt; Grrr....
