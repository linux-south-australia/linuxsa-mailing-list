Yes, in theory.

But now go to <A HREF="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/">http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/</A> and calculate
how much that patent opposition is going to cost you.
Oh, and if you win you pay your costs but you lose you
pay your and *their* costs.

&gt; Of all the recently discussed legal issues the DMCA/PDF one worries me
&gt; the most. I believe that sort of reverse engineering is ok here, but
&gt; does anyone know if any proposed legislation is going to change the
&gt; situation?

 Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) 
 47D Reproducing computer programs to make interoperable products 

     (1) Subject to this Division, the copyright in a literary
         work that is a computer program is not infringed by the
         making of a reproduction or adaptation of the work if:

         (a) the reproduction or adaptation is made by, or on
             behalf of, the owner or licensee of the copy of
             the program (the original program) used for making
             the reproduction or adaptation; and 

         (b) the reproduction or adaptation is made for the purpose
             of obtaining information necessary to enable the owner
             or licensee, or a person acting on behalf of the owner
             or licensee, to make independently another program (the
             new program), or an article, to connect to and be used
             together with, or otherwise to interoperate with, the
             original program or any other program; and

         (c) the reproduction or adaptation is made only to the extent
             reasonably necessary to obtain the information referred
             to in paragraph (b); and 

         (d) to the extent that the new program reproduces or adapts
             the original program, it does so only to the extent
             necessary to enable the new program to connect to and be
             used together with, or otherwise to interoperate with, the
             original program or the other program; and 

         (e) the information referred to in paragraph (b) is not readily
             available to the owner or licensee from another source when
             the reproduction or adaptation is made. 

     (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to the making of a reproduction or
         adaptation of a computer program from an infringing copy of the
         computer program.
