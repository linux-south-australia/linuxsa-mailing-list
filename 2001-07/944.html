&gt; Does anyone know what Im talking about.

Do you? :-)

When you want to find the IP address for a given hostname you use a DNS
resolver.  Often these resolvers have a list of recursive nameservers
to query.  The first recursive nameserver should be able to resolve
any name, but if it fails, or fails to answer within a certain time,
the resolver queries the next, and so, until it's exhausted it's list
of nameservers.  Often nameservers have a built-in cache, which they
use to satisfy recently obtained addresses without having to go to the
wire again.  There's no reason why resolvers can't also have a cache,
just as there's no reason why resolvers can't also do recursive queries,
but for simplicity, at least on unix, the resolver does the least work,
and leaves the most work for the nameserver.

Nameservers don't have to do recursive queries, nor do they have to
cache results.  If they do neither of these then their only use is
to answer queries about domains they control.  I suppose a nameserver
might have so many records to manage that it needs some sort of on-
disk database, in which case it might also cache (in memory) commonly
requested names.  That would be an awful lot of names.  I don't know
of any that do that.

Bind, which is probably still the most commonly used nameserver, performs
caching, and recursive lookups, and primary or secondary zone resolution.
That is, when you query bind it looks in its cache for the result, and
returns it quickly, if it has it.  If it hasn't got the result in cache,
and if it's configured for recursive queries, it does all of that and
caches the result.  If the query happens to be for a zone for which it
is a primary or secondary server, it returns the result from it's in-
memory table.

Djbdns, another popular unix nameserver, comes with separate caching
servers and (what DB calls) external servers.  The caching server does
recursive lookups, and is generally configured to only accept queries
from the local network; and the external server is used for domains
for which it is the primary or secondary server.  If you don't "own"
any domains you don't run the external server; but you do always run
the caching server.
