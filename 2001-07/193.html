OK, Jason. This comes back to "How to get best results from LinuxSA"
type-things. They didn't know they were not to post in HTML. The
aforementioned document aims (amongst other things) to relieve the
community of that problem.

It's not an unreasonable request. It's not like we're asking people to
chew their left-arm off while hopping only on their big toes, is it? I
mean, seriously. They want free support. We say "Sure, just make sure
you don't send bastardized emails in HTML". Not a bad deal if you ask
me.

&gt; Unless it doenst wrap propoerly.

"How to get best results from LinuxSA" suggests that those who post
messages wrap outgoing text at 72 characters. I'll conceed that it's not
a guarantee, but it's better than nothing.

&gt; But speak for yourself.
&gt; I will answer any question I think I can, that I read.

That's the angle I'm comming at this from. I can't help people if I
can't read/respond to their messages properly.

&gt; So dont make it seprate.
&gt; 
&gt; Auto copy all stuff fromt eh newbie list ot eh amin list.

No, please. Let's not subscribe mailing lists to each other. That's just
a pain. There are ways that you can identify the two lists from each
other, but that'd be bad.

&gt; That wat y newbies ahve access to techinical knowldge, without having to
&gt; put up with the stiuff they dont want ot hear, or dont ahve time to hear.

No. See above.

&gt; See above.

See above.

&gt; Noa concsiou effort.

I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark here and assume that that line
was meant to read "Not a conscious effort".

&gt; But if you ask a quesiton you might not get an attempt at an answer, but
&gt; if you do it in the wrong format you will almost certianly get a gruff
&gt; reply.

Interesting. You're refering to David Lloyd here, I'm sure. One thing
that you've discounted here is the fact that when David complains about
the HTML in the message, he also answers the question. I can't see the
problem, especially as David's posts are in no way able to be classed as
a flame or otherwise offensive.

&gt; If the questionis considred to basic you will get a gruff reply.

No. Maybe blunt. Ie:

	&gt; How do I use 'ls'

	'man ls'

&gt; We may not consiously push people away, but if you wnet into a shop and
&gt; said "to buy a fish I'd like to" and the saleman said. "I wont sell to you
&gt; until you can speak proper english", whould you buy from that shop?

Completely different. When you go to a shop, you're about to hand over
your money and expect a certain level of service in return. LinuxSA is a
bunch of volunteers doing their best to teach and learn in an informal,
non-financially driven environment.

&gt; If you asked the salesman "what sort of car has 4 wheel drive" and he said
&gt; "go read a car buyers guide" (ie rtfm) woudl you wnat to buy from him?

Dear me -- we have lost the point, haven't we. RTFM simply means "Read
this: It'll explain it all for you". Why on earth would anyone waste
their time helping someone who's not prepared to help themselves?

&gt; Would you return to those shops?

Those shops aren't really relevant in this thread.

&gt; Hmmm... I dispute that.
&gt; Peopel do get flameds for merely asking simple questions, that they _dont
&gt; know_ how to find the answer for.
&gt; Let alone for posting html.

You can dispute that, Jason. To be completely blunt and frank, you're
being "sissy" about it. I suppose it all comes down to what you define a
flame as. It seems that some have a particularly low level of tolerance
in this department.

&gt; Why?
&gt; Anything can work if we want to to work.

Yeah, right-o. I'd really like for my laptop to grow another couple of
processors, my dog to come back to life and the fire to stay running all
by itslef. I want it to work. But for some strange reason, it doesn't.
Perhaps you've got some pointers you'd like to share with me that can
help.

Seriously, now. Read bellow.

&gt; It will fail if people dont want it to succeded though.

Well there's your stumbling block. I for one do not want it to succeed.
I have my reasons, as do the other advocates of "leaving it as it is".
