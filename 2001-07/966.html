<H1>Vanishing Post Variables in PHP</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Here's the situation:

1) User submits information via POST

2) Request is accepted by a "super script"

3) The super script requires its configuration

4) The super script requires another file

5) Eventually, a value, NAV, is gathered and a require is built similar
to this:
  
 &lt;?php include ("$VALUE.php"); ?&gt;

6) However, $VALUE.php does not receive the post variables

This strikes me as odd.

Documentation (i.e. the manual from <A HREF="http://www.php.net/">http://www.php.net/</A>) says:

"When a file is include()ed, the code it contains inherits the variable
scope of the line on which the include() occurs."
 - quoting fromfunctions.include.html if you have the thing handy

I have rolled a script that walks through $HTTP_POST_VARS and echo'ed
each variable to screen and error_log; $HTTP_POST_VARS exist at the line
I'm talking about, they are in scope. Other evidence that my super
script can see these variables in its scope at this point is that I do
something like:

--
if (isset $HTTP_POST_VARS['NAV']) {
	$VALUE=$HTTP_POST_VARS['NAV'];
} else {
	$VALUE= /* some default value */;
}
--

$VALUE is set. The include("$VALUE.php") pulls up the file, but then
when I run:

--
if (isset ($HTTP_POST_VARS)) {
	reset $HTTP_POST_VARS;
	/* iterate using list and each and echo to screen */
}
--

There are no set variables. Hence, my database query that relies on a
number of these user submissions falls flat on its face.

A few questions, then:

1) includes and requires

Reading the documentation implies that the included or required blocks
should inherit the same scope as the line they're called from. In the
scope I perform this require/include (I have tried both) I have iterated
over $HTTP_POST_VARS and echo'ed the variables automatically imported
into my global scope by PHP.

Given that there is only one blank space between that and the line that
contains the include I would presume the scope is the same.

So where do these variables go? 

2) forms

Sort of related, but a hunch tells me that pressing the submit button
will create a new request. Hence, unless you are using frames, your
whole window will need to be recreated. I'm almost certain I'm right,
can someone just say I am, or set me on the correct path if I'm wrong?
