Hi all,

I've been making some modifications to a tool called protopkg, which
takes source code and makes a slackware package from it.  My first job
has been to make it read from one build file, instead of three.

Previously, it had a 'prototype' file, in which there was certain
variables, as well as package specific compile() and install()
functions.  The other files it could use were 'sources' and 'rules.'  In
each of these files, there were various lines of text in between two
flags, in the following format:

flag:
text
text
text
:flag

There is a read_rules() function that extracts the information between
the flag name passed to it as an argument.  This is it below:

read_rules() {
   sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^$/d' | sed -n "/^${1}:/,/^:${1}$/p" |
   grep -Fv "${1}:" | grep -Fv ":${1}" | sed -e "s/^[ \t]*//"
}

So, in order to combine all three files into one, I made another set of
flags to encapsulate that which was originally alone in the 'protopkg'
file (flag name is 'package') and then appended the other two files to
it.

The problem starts here.  Originally, the entire prototype file was
sourced, which was OK since it contained only Bash stuff.  However, now
it doesn't, so I want to use the read_rules() function to just source
the stuff in between the 'package' flags.  My failed attempt is below.

     # This dumps it to a file called source.  So close!  But I want it
     # read *internally*
 
     read_rules "package" &lt; prototype &gt; source
     . ./source
     rm source
     
     # WHAT A CRUDDY HACK.
     # Originally, it just used `. ./prototype` to source the whole
     # file.
               
Every other attempt I have made, I cannot get it to do anything but dump
the stuff between the package flags to stdout.

So, all you bash wizards out there, am I missing something?  Or is there
a better way of approaching the whole situation?

Thankyou for your time and help.

Cheers,

Tim Riley
