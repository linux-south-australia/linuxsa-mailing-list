&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt; 
&gt; I wish that was the case but we are having all sorts of 
&gt; bother getting 
&gt; enough of a system on the 1.2 Gig drive and still have enough room to 
&gt; run Star Office.
&gt; 
&gt; While it would be nice to think that Linux is the standard 
&gt; out there it 
&gt; isn't and isn't going to be for some time. The community standard is 
&gt; Microsoft and so putting a machine out into the community requires it 
&gt; to be either Microsoft or as close as we can so that Microsoft files 
&gt; can still be used on it. 
&gt; 
&gt; We are trying to help the community gain computer skills. There isn't 
&gt; any point in selling people a system that is not compatible with the 
&gt; majority of other computers out there. 
&gt; 
&gt; Star Office is the key to providing a level of compatibility. Without 
&gt; running Star Office we don't have compatibility with the MS files and 
&gt; that means we don't have Linux as an alternative.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know of any other alternative-Office product that is 
&gt; as closely 
&gt; compatible to the Microsoft Office Package and that comes with the 
&gt; support and features of Star Office for the cost of burning a CD. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please tell me if you know of something that can do all that Star 
&gt; Office does for only the cost of a CD and I will check it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Brian, I have been into computers since '68. I can tolerate the 
&gt; differences, the frustrations, the difficulties that come 
&gt; with a Linux 
&gt; system. I can learn and I can get much better using and tweaking the 
&gt; Linux system. This is fun to me and I am enjoying the challlenge.
&gt; 
&gt; The people that we provide these computers to are either newbies to 
&gt; computing or else still trying to understand about a file and a 
&gt; directory. Linux for them would have to be a stable system running as 
&gt; close to the Windows look and feel as we can get it simply so 
&gt; they can 
&gt; work on it from that point.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think that Linux is not an appropriate path for us to folllow 
&gt; with our requirments then please let me know dso I can start looking 
&gt; for other solutions to our problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Ian

Ian, I am a volunteer for Computerbank, we have been donating PC's with
Linux,
and applications such as AbiWord, Gnumeric for many years now. We mainly
deal
with new or very inexperienced users and these systems work fine. At times
we
have systems capable of running SO, but a typical system is pentium 100ish,
1.2Gb HDD, 32mb ram. These systems are wonderful for teaching computer
skills
and providing communication and other tools to the recipients. If you are
able
to provide some training and some ongoing support (as Computerbank does)
then
I think that Linux and open source software will meet all your software
needs.
