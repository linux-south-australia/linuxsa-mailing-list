Hi Andrew, thanks for the good response,
 
&gt; Honestly, a 1.2GB HDD should be buckets of space for
&gt; what you are trying to achieve.
 
Glad of that, I was beginning to wonder if it is doable at that size.

&gt; One thing you can do with the Distros, is just not
&gt; install eveything. The trick is knowing what to leave
&gt; out. 
 
I have tried the Custom install but it was not a success. Am going to 
try again later today and see what we can do by selecting packages. 
Previously I had spent ages trying to do a Yes/No on the programs but 
the final install crashed so that was a waste of several hours &lt;sigh&gt;
 
&gt; If you can work out what to put on, which I would
&gt; assume would be the core system, X/Windows, KDE or
&gt; Gnome (but only the bare bones), StarOffice and some
&gt; internet connectivity, you may be able to choose the
&gt; custom install selecting individual packages. 

That is why I was asking for help on this list. Who better than Linux 
users to advise on what to leave in and what to leave out. 

&gt; The less stuff on there, the less stuff a newbie can
&gt; mess up (at least until they get more experienced).
&gt; You can still ship a CD of other apps, just dont have
&gt; them installed to start with. Your average user in
&gt; this scenario will be able to achieve most things with
&gt; Star Office.

That is what I was hoping. I am still waiting to hear back from 
Computer Bank but hopefully we can compare notes on what they install 
and how they support the newbie.

&gt; One area you may have problems with is printing, esp.
&gt; if the printers are InkJets that dont have LInux
&gt; drivers avail.

Our own systems all use the Canon BJ 2000 SP or the 2001 model. I cant 
speak for what our potential customers might use.
 
&gt; Please contact me offlist, I live in Pooraka area and
&gt; would like to help but amount of time I can donate is
&gt; limited

Thankyou, watch this space &lt;G&gt;
