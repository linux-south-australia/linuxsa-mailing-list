&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have a problem with html email. I prefer text, because it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; usually more readable, and I dont care about formatting/fonts and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; really hate stupid colours (I just got one html email with black quotes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; blue text and a purple background!). But the main reason I havnt said
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything in this html debate, is I dont really care, and my mailer
&gt;&gt;&gt; handles html fine. I think it is preferable to try an avoid it, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is no biggie to me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, but you use Mozilla, and it shows.  You've left the entire text
&gt;&gt; in place, including unsubscribe instructions, and put your reply out
&gt;&gt; of sequence with the original messages, which were laid out in the
&gt;&gt; opposite sense.  I've done the same this time to illustrate the issue.
&gt;&gt; A couple more up and down replies like this and nobody will be able to
&gt;&gt; read it.  The chronological sequence of this message is currently 3 4
&gt;&gt; 1 2.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can understand why you do this: it's painful to use Mozilla as an
&gt;&gt; MUA.  But that doesn't make it right.
&gt;
&gt; I do not believe that it is fair to blame the MUA for this, altho some
&gt; of
&gt; the default Mozilla Mail-News settings do encourage this.

It's very difficult to get Mozilla to do things right.  I'm sure you
didn't intend the previous paragraph to be on 3 lines, for example.
And quite probably you didn't notice the fact before the message went
out.

&gt;
&gt; As I see it, good mail etiquette includes:
&gt; * including a meaningful subject
&gt; * sending mail as plain text
&gt; * quoting the relevant portions of the previous message, then adding
&gt;   your reply beneath it
&gt; * begining your signature with "--" then a new line
&gt;
&gt; This is what I would do to configure Mozilla to default to sending
&gt; well written (as perceived by most knowledgeable Unix users) mail:
&gt;
&gt; Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Mail and Newsgroups
&gt; MESSAGE DISPLAY
&gt; * Use this font when displaying plain text messages: Fixed width font
&gt;
&gt; MESSAGE COMPOSITION
&gt; * Forward messages: As Attachment
&gt; * Automatically quote the original message when replying.
&gt;   Then,: start my reply below the quoted text
&gt;
&gt; SEND FORMAT
&gt; * When sending messages in HTML format...:
&gt;   Ask me what to do OR Convert the message to plain text
&gt;   (according to tase)
&gt; * Add "*" to Plain Text Domains
&gt;   (not sure if this has the desired effect)
&gt;
&gt; Someone may wish to compile similar instructions for other MUAs,
&gt; altho there's probably already something like this somewhere.

There's already a lot of this stuff at
