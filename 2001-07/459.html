&gt; &gt;kind of.  I've heard that said a lot but when I work out
&gt; &gt;the total costs, ADSL is a better deal (assuming you use it).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From a connection point of view, ORHH is still the cheaper option. It's the
&gt; bandwidth costs on Telstra ADSL that are skewing your comparison. If regular
&gt; DOV-supporting ISP's could sell 3G of data for $5 per month, you'd be
&gt; finding the ORHH a lot more attractive. Unfortunately, they can't - they
&gt; don't have dumb shareholders footing the bill for someone else's download
&gt; habit.

I agree, but even ignoring the download limits, go back to my
comparison, the adsl still beats ISDN/ORHH on the permanent vs
non-permanent and 256/64 vs 64k for the same price.

&gt; ISDN still has a few things going for it, you get a second phone line, that
&gt; you can still receive calls on even if you're tying up a channel with a
&gt; semi-permanent internet connection.

yes but you get a phone line with adsl that is available for normal calls
all the time too.  In both cases the extra line rental for this
voice line wasn't included in my comparison (on the basis that you'd
have a voice line anyway).
 
&gt; You also don't have to end up with a soul-destroying contract and you can
&gt; still have a choice of ISP's to dial. 

true, you can choose a 3 month contract though even with the higher
install fee (by the time you include and ORHH install and buying
a NetJet card it's about the same as the ORHH startup costs).
I agree no contract at all is better but it's a relatively minor
point.

&gt;Having Telstra ADSL on a line now may
&gt; make it difficult to use a different providers DSL offering in the future
&gt; once the market becomes competitive. 

really? how? like any service on the line, you cancel, stop paying
for it, the carrier removes the service, I would've thought.

&gt;If your ISP goes down with ORHH (which
&gt; is much less likely than with ADSL right now) you can dial another one. If
&gt; you go away for a month, Telstra will still charge you for the month of ADSL
&gt; use .. a local ISP probably wouldn't.

true
 
&gt; If you want to run servers or have a fixed IP, ADSL will require that you go
&gt; on some sort of premium plan where the bandwidth is valued much like the $50
&gt; account you mentioned earlier.

true, but you're talking more business use, for home use a dynamic
ip running a web/mail server works fine (eg. www.dyndns.org works
great for me).
 
&gt; A lot of people are getting ORHH installed just so they can get a clean line
&gt; to run their modem on .. if you're already paying for a 2nd phone line, ISDN
&gt; isn't going to make a difference to your monthly bill once you have it
&gt; installed.

true but there are some disadvantages, eg. you can't have some of the
"easycall" type functions on ISDN, it's not a "normal" basic phone
service (under the SFOA, ACA rules etc) so telstra can change the
price, rules, etc anytime and you're back to square one.  And if the 
ORHH box requires mains power (does it? most ISDN I've seen does, 
except for some onramp2's?) then it's out during a power failure 
whereas your old PSTN line will still work (not such an issue these 
days when nearly everyone has mobiles anyway I guess).

I wish ORHH was a better deal than adsl but no matter how I look at
it I keep coming to the conclusion that adsl is the better deal.

Dave.
