&gt; I think we're nearly there on this thread. The number of participants is
&gt; somewhat limited which worries me slightly.

I think this thread is the first one on the topic that has seemingly
reached a positive conclusion. I guess it will be forgotten in a year or
two and those with a sense for history will ignore future discussions.

I want something that is good for all users of this list.
If the conclusion is to do nothing about HTML that is good.
I have never been bothered by it.
I guess it annoys me that some people just ignore a mail from the list if
it is in HTML. How many people do that? 

I am in no way aiming this at David Lloyd. There is just a general
impression that the list does not like HTML. Perhaps it would be better
for individuals to block it themselves which I am sure they do. If they
delete HTML messages are they only penalising themselves?

On that note, if people dont like this thread, then they dont have to read
it. Is that too hard? 

It is not good to flame newbies for making mistakes that seem easy to
avoid for knowledgable people, but uknown to them.

Dale.
