Adobe's legal attack dogs savage open source KIllustrator
By our special correspondent
Posted: 16/07/2001 at 16:57 GMT

Adobe's carefully cultivated 'nice guy' image has been found lacking in 
Germany. This is thanks to its law firm which is charging people on 
Adobe's behalf for the privilege of getting a stiff legal letter, 
writes Paul Nesbitt. 

Adobe is demanding that a German professor and part time open source 
programmer stop using the name KIllustrator as the brand for his Linux-
based drawing program. 

KIllustrator was written by Dr Kai-Uwe Sattler, as part of a project at 
the University of Magdeburg, which employs him. As its name suggests, 
KIllustrator is similar to Adobe's famous Illustrator program, but it 
has been developed as part of K Office, an Office-like suite of 
programs for KDE user interface running over Linux. 



Now I can use Photoshop but I much prefer to use PhotoImpact on my W 
system or GIMP on my Linux. KIllustrator sounds like a great program if 
it is like its namesake and it could be a valuable tool in the Linux 
stable. It won't cost anywhere near the thousands you have to pay for 
the Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator products and may just work as well 
as them.

Have the nice Adobe folks been visiting Redmond to learn about 
protecting your products?


Cheers,
Ian
