John,

This probably wont help much, but a while ago I had severe troubles
installing Mandrake 7.2.
I was sometimes getting to the software selection stage, but many times it
ended in a kernel panic after the second stage install started. Drove me
crazy, I eventually found out that my RAM was fsckd.
(After a few days of drive swapping and partitioning maddness d;-)

Jay

Subject: Mandrake 7.2 installation problem


&gt; Some months ago (mid April I think) I asked David Lloyd for some advice
&gt; on installing Mandrake 7.2 as he had helped somebody else previously.  I
&gt; tried his suggestions without success and decided to drop the whole
&gt; thing for the time being and perhaps come back to it when I had more
&gt; time.  Now with some spare time, I thought I'd put the problem before
&gt; the group and see if anybody could suggest anything.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried three separate CDs of Mandrake, from three separate
&gt; sources, with the same result so I am fairly confident that the problem
&gt; is more than just a dud disc.  First, the symptoms:
&gt;
&gt; After re-booting with the CD in the drive, what I assume to be a
&gt; standard Mandrake header graphic appears, followed by lines of text
&gt; messages which scroll down the screen to a certain point and then stop.
&gt; At this point only a re-boot will achieve anything.  The screen messages
&gt; (not counting parts which have scrolled off the top too fast to read)
&gt; are:
&gt;
&gt; Split FIFO Configuration: 8 Primary buffers, threshold = 1/2
&gt; 8 Second. buffers, threshold = 1/2
&gt; ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
&gt; ide0: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
&gt; ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe008-0xe00f, BIOS settings: hdc: DMA, hdd:DMA
&gt; ide1: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
&gt; hda: WDC AC26400R, ATA DISK drive
&gt; hdb: LS-120 VER5 00 UHD Floppy, ATAPI FLOPPY drive
&gt; Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
&gt; 00000014
&gt; current-&gt;tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
&gt; #pde = 00000000
&gt; Ooops: 0000
&gt; CPU: 0
&gt; EIP: 0010:[&lt;c0108c59&gt;]
&gt; EFLAGS: 000100002
&gt; ......
&gt; ......  (register dump etc)
&gt;
&gt; My system:
&gt;
&gt; AMD K6-2 cpu running at 400MHz
&gt; 6.4 Gbyte hard disc drive
&gt; LS-120 (120 Mbyte) super-floppy disc drive (this doubles as a standard
&gt; 1.4 Mbyte floppy drive when necessary)
&gt; 40x ATAPI CF-ROM drive
&gt; Redback 336E external modem
&gt; Acer Vuego Brisa 320P scanner on the parallel port
&gt; Canon BJC4200 printer piggy-backed on the back of the scanner
&gt; Philips 107S monitor
&gt; 128 Mbytes of memory
&gt; Windows98 and Caldera eDesktop 2.4 dual booting with Bootmagic.
&gt;
&gt; The hard disc is partitioned as follows:
&gt; hda1: primary partition holding Windows (drive C 1019 Mbytes)
&gt; hda2: extended partition
&gt; hda5: logical partition - Linux /boot (15 Mbytes)
&gt; hda6: logical partition - Linux Swap (250 Mbytes)
&gt; hda7: logical partition - Linux /home (1576 Mbytes)
&gt; hda8: logical partition - Linux / (3286 Mbytes)
&gt;
&gt; Other devices are:
&gt; hdb: LS-120 drive
&gt; hdc: CD-ROM drive
&gt;
&gt; My interrupts are (from /proc/interrupts):
&gt; 0 timer
&gt; 1 keyboard
&gt; 2 cascade
&gt; 4 serial
&gt; 8 rtc
&gt; 12 cmpci
&gt; 13 fpu
&gt; 14 ide0
&gt; 15 ide1
&gt;
&gt; I have been running Caldera OpenLinux since mid-1999, moving up through
&gt; versions 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, with no trouble.  The only installation
&gt; glitch is that I can't make a boot floppy because I don't have a floppy
&gt; drive - I had to do this manually after installation.  I have also
&gt; installed Red Hat 7.0 with no trouble, and SuSE 7.1 within the Windows
&gt; partition.
&gt;
&gt; Can somebody help me please - while I am fairly happy with Caldera 2.4,
&gt; I would like to try Mandrake.
