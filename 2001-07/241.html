&gt;&gt; Yes, Alan Kenington alerted me to that fact seconds after it reached the

&gt;&gt; seconds after spending an age telling people how to format their
&gt;&gt; messages :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ahhh, ptew! It was late and my head was hurting :-)

&gt; That happens a lot in the computing industry. How would it feel if
&gt; you were flamed for it, or were indirectly flamed with some passive
&gt; sarcasm, or comments that were joking but you cold not be sure if
&gt; there were a joke or a put-down?  Especially when you are a
&gt; newbie. I do know that you know.  I guess I am reiterating it for
&gt; the list at large, all of whom know too.

I think we've all done it from time to time.  That doesn't mean we
shouldn't draw attention to it, just that we shouldn't flame people
unnecessarily for it.  A couple of true stories:

1.  10 years ago, when I was working at Tandem, a girl sent out a
    broadcast message to the company containing a rather weak joke.
    Unwittingly she left attached an attachment which was by no means
    weak: it was from an admirer who had left no doubts about what he
    intended to do next time he saw her.  I think the whole thing
    might still be at <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/whale.html">http://www.lemis.com/whale.html</A> or whale.txt or
    some such.  There's no link to it, so you may have to experiment.  

    The result of this was that both got fired, causing an uproar
    amongst the employees who thought that they had been treated
    unfairly, and that the real culprit was the emetic mail software.

2.  5 months ago I was negotiating a licence agreement for a book.  I
    got a reply (written with Microsoft) which unwittingly included an
    extremely confidential document about future plans of the company
    in question.  This proved to be rather useful: in return for
    keeping quiet (which I would have done anyway, but they weren't
    convinced :-) we were able to conclude the negotiations in my
    favour.
