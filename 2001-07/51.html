GIMP
from <A HREF="http://gimp.org">http://gimp.org</A>

lay down your line markers over the image, then select the plugin, and it
outputs an html file and a bunch of files into a directory of your choosing.

It doesn't have much support for automatic rollovers, etc. though. But it
does do the image editting part extremely well. I prefer GIMP over
photoshop easily.

You mentioned you already use the gimp, but perhaps you just haven't
discovered this function? It's under Filters/Perl-o-tine in my copy, but i'm
running a rather ancient cvs version, so its possible it has been relocated
or renamed.

&gt; does anyone know of an open-source program that does an equivalent to what

&gt; (for those who haven't seen it: imageready is a component of photoshop that
&gt; basically lets you take an image and cut it up into "slices", then output
&gt; those slices to html/images (it makes all the table html and stuff, and cuts
&gt; up the big image into slices nicely). it also does other stuff like
&gt; rollovers (html+javascript) and animated gifs, and probably lots more stuff
&gt; that i don't know about.)
&gt;
&gt; the question comes from the issue of seeing if we could move to a linux-only
&gt; desktop. we've got most of the tools we need under linux - office-type tools
&gt; (word processors, spreadsheets etc), mail readers, browsers, database tools,
&gt; nice text editors, the gimp, etc - but nothing to cover this app. we could
&gt; go back to doing it manually, but it's a pain in the bum ;-)
