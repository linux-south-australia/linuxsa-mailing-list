&gt; Does anyone have any experience with IDE RAID and Linux?


Yep.

&gt; Specifically, how
&gt; do the built-in Promise RAIDs on motherboards like ASUS A7V133 and MSI Turbo
&gt; K7 SE RAID compare to dedicated RAID cards like Promis FastTrak? Do they
&gt; both work as seamlessly with Linux?


Well, I have an MSI Athlon Motherboard with the Promise PDC20265R 
chipset. By default, this only supports RAID 1 and 5 (I think) and only 
supports 1x RAID 1 on the drives. However, with a bit of BIOS patching, 
you can make it do 2x RAID 1. If you are interested, I can write this 
process up, as I've been meaning to....

The 2.4.6 kernel has support for this chipset now, which is *much* 
simpler than messing about with the Promise drivers. It also supports 
the "hardware" RAID features of the Promise chipset as IDE devices, 
unlike the Promise drivers which give you "SCSI" drives, which is handy 
if you want to boot a VMware RAW partition off one of your Promise RAID 
devices.

 
&gt; Finally, which is more transparent -- hardware RAID (as above) or software
&gt; RAID?


They are pretty much both transparent, once they are set up. Admitedly, 
I have not tested drive failure recovery on the Promise controller yet, 
while I have with software RAID under Linux, and the software RAID 
recovery is very simple.

&gt; Ideally, I would be able to mirror the entire filesystem, and gain the
&gt; benefit of surviving a disk crash only needing to physically replace the
&gt; drive, not losing any data (preferably not crashing the machine also...)...
&gt; This would include swap and /, for consistency's sake...

Should be easy to do, but I've never bothered with RAIDing boot drives 
and swap to date - just the data.

Cheers,
