&gt;&gt;  Be aware that there are regulations that apply to the usage of Wireless
&gt;&gt;  gear. For example, if you plan to charge for data or service provision,
&gt;&gt;  you're going to be breaking Federal Telecomunications law (unless you're
&gt;&gt;  a registered telco, of course).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I spoke to the ACA (or was it the ABA, I can't remember) about the laws
&gt;&gt;  etc regarding this. Basically, you can run a long range wireless link
&gt;  &gt; without breaking the law, as long as you're not charging anyone for it.

The definitions have been the subject of some previous debate in 
other fora, the real test will come the day someone gets sued over 
the issue (which I don't believe has yet happened).

Something near-enough to the real definition of 'legal' is that if 
the link carries traffic for third parties, then you need a carrier 
license if that link is longer than certain limits (500 metres point 
to point or 5000 m aggregate via multiple point to point links).

The ACA web site has the full gory details. Pragmatic answer is that 
links for your own point to point needs are fine, but as soon as you 
carry third party traffic on it (regardless of whether you charge for 
it), you need a carrier license to do that legally (again over 
certain length limits).

Carrying Internet data (even to yourself) via such links without a 
carrier license is a very gray area in this respect. But it gets very 
black and while as soon as you carry  it for someone else.
