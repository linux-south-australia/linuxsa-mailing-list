ROFL

&gt; Mainly for fun and the thrill of learning at the moment, but eventually it
&gt; may have usefull applications around the home.

Bull&lt;shit&gt;. You want to get out of doing the dishes, mopping the floors
and cleaning baby vomit. Admit it ;-P

&gt; Where do I start? 

This is a multiple choice answer with red herrings intended to create a
seriously long, boring discussion by people who have no sense of humour
and/or react to those said people:

a) On Earth
b) By Reading "Linux Device Drivers" by O'Reilly (currently stocked at
The Bookshelf in town, and Netcraft would probably have access to it
too)
 - if my memory serves me correctly, they develop an example device
driver that drives some small servo motor in the book
c) By reading the device driver HOWTO
d) Consulting the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
e) Going to Dick Smiths
f) At the beginning

&gt; I have basic experience in electronics, like making
&gt; circuit boards and soldering etc and I'm willing to put extra effort into
&gt; studying and reading relevent texts, once I know where to find them d;-j

At a bookshop, or library. I would suggest the rubbish dump as well, but
I couldn't guarantee the books' condition if obtained from that place.

&gt; Basically I would like to be able to control servo's, motors and switches
&gt; from a host computer, while getting signals back from various sensors for
&gt; light, water levels, sound levels etc. Where should I start investigating
&gt; the kinds of electronic componants I need, how to connect them to my
&gt; computer etc.

At home will do. Then progress to Rundle Mall and become a busker.
