&gt; Really - which bits? There are people out there who set their Reply-To
&gt; field.  If the mailing list overwrites it, this information is lost.

True.  This is a situation where there is no one-true-way. However, in
general, I can't abide by the link you originally posted as the author
is  in  general,  ranting because *his* MUA can't handle it (there are
plenty out there that do, in fact, on another list I'm on that does do
Reply-To  munging,  I  can still reply to the author of the message by
doing a reply-all and removing the list address - which I admit is not
that  different  from  doing  a  reply-all  to  a  non-munged list and
removing  the  original  senders  address,  but  the principle is that
you're  on  a mailing list, and as such most replies would be going to
the list)

He  states that "I'm not schooled in the science of human factors, but
I suspect surprise is not an element of a robust user interface. " So,
from  his  lack  of  human  usability  knowledge,  he purports to make
assumptions as to what a robust user interface is???

&gt; I have been subscribed to a few mailing lists where the Reply-To field
&gt; is overwritten and you do get quite responses needlessly or
&gt; accidentally going to the list (though these can be the source of some
&gt; amusement too :-)

As on non-munged lists where you get missing posts because people have
accidently  posted  to  the  original  sender  instead of the list. It
swings both ways.

&gt;&gt; I see your unicom, and raise you a:
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.metasystema.org/essays/reply-to-useful.mhtml">http://www.metasystema.org/essays/reply-to-useful.mhtml</A>

&gt; Some  mailing  lists  (like  the debian ones) have a policy of users
&gt; only cc'ing the sender if they explicitly ask for it.

So isn't this somewhat similar to Reply-To munging?

And  as  a  final note: RFC-822 does in fact (as the above link points
out) condone Reply-To munging.  ;)
