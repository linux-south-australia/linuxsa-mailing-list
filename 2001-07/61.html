Paul!

&gt; From recent MSI mb experience I am guessing the sticker means 'use linux(or bsd or win9x) since 
&gt; this board will crash repeatedly under w2k with anything less than SP2 and the latest drivers and
&gt; even then it will run like a 486'.

My three MSI boards run Linux/BSD like a charm, however:

1) The Riva TNT2 Ultra
 - will stuff Windows 98 (whichever version) requiring about 15 reboots
to get the settings right

2) The AMD-K6II
 - is likely to cause Windows (whatever version it was that buggered up
with them) to just crash

3) The MSI6167 K7 Irongate Board
 - is, although it's not MSI's fault, as buggy as hell
 - takes about 10 reboots to get it to behave if you're installing Win
98
 - make that 20 if you're using the Riva TNT2 Ultra (there's a bug in
the drivers/board BIOS that causes Windows to not recognise the AGP bus
correctly, thereby forcing my [then] state of the art, fantastically
expensive video card to run at 640x480 with 256 colours; I'm lucky I
didn't get confounded green and black mono)

On the other hand, I've found MSI boards to be inexpensive. Or should I
say cheap?

PS
Could you try to convince your mail user agent (the thing you write mail
with) to wrap your e-mails at about 70-75 characters? Trying to read
mail that kinda goes way past pixel 1280 with a 6 point font face makes
me ALMOST as cranky as HTML e-mail ;-P
