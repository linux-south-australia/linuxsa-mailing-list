Hi Everyone,

please take the time to look at <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/attacks/trinity1.html">http://www.topology.org/attacks/trinity1.html</A>

Near the end of the page, Alan implies that I was responsible for the attack.
I would like to say that I find this offensive. While I find Alan's 
postings rather verbose and occasionally inaccurate, I would hardly go on 
to a public forum and call him a fuckwit. It is even less likely that I 
personally would initiate an attack (I will use Alan's term here) given the 
my last posting to the list regarding Alan's lack of knowledge about kernel 
compilation.

I have posted offlist to several people with an explanation. Yes Luke 
Warmwater is an alias for the particular ex-student (yes, he is an 
ex-student). I have continued to call him Luke in any correspondence as I 
do not wish to harm any future career he may have (yes suitable employers 
are often on this list). No "Luke" is not a member of the IT Dept. at 
Trinity College. Yes, "Luke's" rather special privileges have been removed. 
His account has been disabled and his machine is rather more restricted now.

Now lets look at some specifics of the web page ( I will pick 3 at random 
as I have wasted too much time already)
1) SYN-flood attack? The log you posted looked like it was a simple 
port-scan to me. This is different to a SYN-flood attack which usually 
floods the same port a number of times. Having said that I haven't 
downloaded the full log of the activities.
2) You will note that the table at the end of the page has a somewhat 
biased chronological summary. In it, my emails are sarcastic and offensive 
while Alan's are sarcastic and inoffensive. Hmmmmmmmmm.
3) I have no idea who Charles Williams', apparently from Germany is but he 
will probably be disappointed to find out that people don't think he exists.

Alan,
do yourself a favour (and me) and remove the page.
