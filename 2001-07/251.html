That's right - I'm giving a computer away.  A real speed daemon (pun intended).

It's a MicroVAX in a pedestal configuration, with an external 500Mb hard disk.

Features:
o The computer itself is approximately the size of an old oil heater like you 
see in the movies, ie. 1m long x 80cm high x 20cm wide, approx.
o The hard disk is IDE, which draws ~8A at startup and drops down to under 1A 
running.  It measures about 1m long by 20cm wide by 20cm deep, approx.  Ready 
for rack mounting or sitting on the floor as a foot rest.
o It has an AUI connector on back (waiting for a transciever so you can network 
it on 10M/bit ethernet) and 5 serial ports (incl console).
o The current OS is Ultrix 4.2 I think.
o Last time it was used is about 3 years ago, so I don't even know if it boots 
now.
o The boot medium is those 10cm square low-density DEC tapes (which I've 
forgotten the name of).  It comes with about 20 tapes, contents unknown.
o 1984 vintage.  Approx 1 MIPS.
o No monitor or graphics card.  You just need a spare dumb terminal or serial 
port and off you go.
o Manuals:  There is definately a hardware manual, and maybe a near complete 
set of Ultrix 4.2(?) manuals as well (if I can find them).
o You need to come and pick it up.  It's heavy.
o There is a Linux port to MicroVAX, and I don't know if it'll work with this 
hardware.

Looking for a good home.  Will accept bribes of any $$$/equipment if you want 
to be the successful applicant.  If it doesn't find acceptance it goes into 
storage until it becomes a "classic" in 3 years when I bring it back out and 
sell it to a computer museum somewhere.

No, I am dumb, most of the time I'm playing smart.
