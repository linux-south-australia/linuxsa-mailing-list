Hi,
My film-maker housemate is keen to use Linux as an Video-editing
platform, perhaps using WINE.
He has an ASUS A7V133 mobo with Promise RAID controller with 2 HDDs, & a
removable OS HDD with Windoze 98.

Just made the Redhat 7.1 CDs from ISO images using CDRECORD/2, on an
OS/2 box on the LAN, worked great.

Put another HDD in the removable bay, but the RAID HDDs were still
active when we booted RH 7.1.
Think we have torched the MBR using Disk Druid for the RAID HDDs.

We stopped after this point, & was going to physically *disconnect* the
RAID HDDs, 
in case something went wrong :)

What do we need to do to recreate the MBR for the hardware RAID HDDs?
Remember this is RAID 0, (striping), are things different with this
arrangement?
What commands/ utilities under Win98 will recreate the MBR?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any experience with IDE RAID and Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; Yep.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Specifically, how
&gt; &gt; do the built-in Promise RAIDs on motherboards like ASUS A7V133 and MSI Turbo
&gt; &gt; K7 SE RAID compare to dedicated RAID cards like Promis FastTrak? Do they
&gt; &gt; both work as seamlessly with Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I have an MSI Athlon Motherboard with the Promise PDC20265R
&gt; chipset. By default, this only supports RAID 1 and 5 (I think) and only
&gt; supports 1x RAID 1 on the drives. However, with a bit of BIOS patching,
&gt; you can make it do 2x RAID 1. If you are interested, I can write this
&gt; process up, as I've been meaning to....
&gt; 
&gt; The 2.4.6 kernel has support for this chipset now, which is *much*
&gt; simpler than messing about with the Promise drivers. It also supports
&gt; the "hardware" RAID features of the Promise chipset as IDE devices,
&gt; unlike the Promise drivers which give you "SCSI" drives, which is handy
&gt; if you want to boot a VMware RAW partition off one of your Promise RAID
&gt; devices.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Finally, which is more transparent -- hardware RAID (as above) or software
&gt; &gt; RAID?
&gt; 
&gt; They are pretty much both transparent, once they are set up. Admitedly,
&gt; I have not tested drive failure recovery on the Promise controller yet,
&gt; while I have with software RAID under Linux, and the software RAID
&gt; recovery is very simple.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ideally, I would be able to mirror the entire filesystem, and gain the
&gt; &gt; benefit of surviving a disk crash only needing to physically replace the
&gt; &gt; drive, not losing any data (preferably not crashing the machine also...)...
&gt; &gt; This would include swap and /, for consistency's sake...
&gt; 
&gt; Should be easy to do, but I've never bothered with RAIDing boot drives
&gt; and swap to date - just the data.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
