&gt; I don't think anyone has asked Geoffrey about whether it's ok to put these
&gt; words into his mouth yet...

Totally agree. I only used Geoffrey because he was the
convenor and thus the logical spokesperson.  Given the reaction
of the list I'm now regretting that and wish that I'd e-mailed
Geoffrey directly.  Sorry about that Geoffrey.

I'm a tad sick of the bush lawyer stuff on this list, so
I called a real one, costing me real money.  Basically
anyone issuing a media release as the spokesperson of an
unincorporated body would be acting unwisely.  Although
not for the reasons that you'd think (I didn't pursue
that point much, not at $10 per minute).

[ Don't take this as an excuse to start that
  incorporation thread again, there are pros
  and cons.  And some other list member can
  pay for that legal advice. ]

Given the above, the ball really rests with AUUG.  They
can, and I think should, issue something to make the
point about Code Red being on Microsoft products
only.

Regards,
Glen
