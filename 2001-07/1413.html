&gt;&gt; WHY are you bothering with M$?  Linux or FreeBSD will do

It may be the case for you, Brian, but it really is NOT the case for
most people.  The unarguable fact is that neither Linux nor FreeBSD will
run Microsoft Office without purchase of additional software (for example
VMware and Windows.) Nobody disputes that there are great alternatives,
however they are NOT fully compatible and 97% compatible has never been
good enough for PC users.  Hell, even early model Microsoft Word is not
compatible enough (with a later model), which sounds to me like a good
reason to not use it; but never-the-less people do; and it's entrenched;
and it is a serious impediment to conducting business if you cannot
use it.

You can minimise the problem with the great alternatives, but you can't
eliminate it.  Most people want to think about their computer about
as much as they think about their toaster, which is to say not much,
and the great alternatives require more thought, which is far too much
effort for most people.  Add to this the obvious truth that most software
titles only run on Windows (for some definition of run) and there seems
to be no contest to the claim that neither Linux nor FreeBSD will do
all that Windows does.

Having made that point, I do think that if we are to win the war of the
desktop we have to unseat Office in particular and Windows in general.
We need more people using unix and have to grasp opportunities where
we can.  Microsoft use the strategy of placing Windows in education
institutions, so that everybody becomes acclimatised to it.  We can
put unix in places that they don't, such as community computer centres,
childcare centres, public libraries and such, and thus improve public
awareness of alternatives to Microsoft.
