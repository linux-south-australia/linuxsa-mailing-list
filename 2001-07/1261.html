&gt; The Janitor and Email
&gt; 
&gt; An unemployed man goes to apply for a job with Microsoft as a
&gt; janitor.
&gt; 
&gt; The manager there arranges for him to take an aptitude test
&gt; (Section: floors, sweeping, and cleaning). After the test, the
&gt; manager says, "You will be employed at minimum wage, $5.15 an
&gt; hour.  Let me have your e-mail address, so that I can send you a
&gt; form to complete and tell you where to report for work on your
&gt; first day."
&gt; 
&gt; Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor
&gt; an e-mail address. To this the MS manager replies, "Well, then,
&gt; that means that you virtually don't exist and can therefore
&gt; hardly expect to be employed."
&gt; 
&gt; Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having
&gt; only $10 in his wallet, he decides to buy a 25-pound flat of
&gt; tomatoes at the supermarket. Within less than two hours, he sells
&gt; all the tomatoes individually at 100 percent profit. Repeating
&gt; the process several times     more that day, he ends up with
&gt; almost $100 before going to sleep that night.
&gt; 
&gt; And thus it dawns on him that he could quite easily make a living
&gt; selling tomatoes. Getting up early every day and going to bed
&gt; late, he multiplies his profits quickly. After a short time he
&gt; acquires a cart to transport several dozen boxes of tomatoes,
&gt; only to have to trade it in again so that he can buy a pickup
&gt; truck to support his expanding business. By the end of the second
&gt; year, he is the owner of a fleet of pickup trucks and manages a
&gt; staff of 100 formerly unemployed people, all selling tomatoes.
&gt; 
&gt; Planning for the future of his wife and children, he decides to
&gt; buy some life insurance. Consulting with an insurance adviser, he
&gt; picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. At the end
&gt; of the telephone conversation, the adviser asks him for his e-
&gt; mail address in order to send the final documents electronically.
&gt; 
&gt; When the man replies that he has no e-mail, the adviser is
&gt; stunned,  "What, you don't have e-mail? How on earth have you
&gt; managed to amass such wealth without the Internet, e-mail, and e-
&gt; commerce? Just imagine where you would be now, if you had been
&gt; connected to the Internet from the very start!"
&gt; 
&gt; After a moment of thought, the tomato millionaire replied, "Why,
&gt; of course! I would be a floor cleaner at Microsoft!"
&gt; 
&gt; Moral of this story: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. The Internet, e-mail, and e-commerce do not need to rule your
&gt; life.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. If you don't have e-mail, but work hard, you can still become
&gt; a millionaire.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Since you got this story via e-mail, you're probably closer to
&gt; becoming a janitor than you are to becoming a millionaire.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. If you do have a computer and e-mail, you have already been
&gt; taken to the cleaners by Microsoft.
