&gt; &gt; I wonder if what we percieve as vitality (in the

&gt; &gt; I suggest that a seperate mailing list is a very good
&gt; &gt; idea or we could scare people off with hundreds of 
&gt; &gt; emails a day.
&gt; 
&gt; I may be wrong, but:
&gt; If there are two seperate lists; who will be reading the newbie list to
&gt; answer questions? The kinds of people who like to chatter are often the
&gt; ones who have answers to questions as well. Would the newbie list be a
&gt; "read, only reply to questions list?", with general conversation to occur
&gt; on the regular list? What is the difference between and answer and a
&gt; conversation. For example, the recent GPL discussion. One question can
&gt; raise multple threads of interest. How can these be seperated among the
&gt; two lists? There are days on LinuxSA when hardly any messages are mailed.

Simple pass all posts to the "newbie" list to teh "main" list.

That way newbies can get info and answer questions with the benefit of all
knowledge(collected amongst main list user knowledge anyway) without
having to endure the obscure and often not really linux related threads.

Instead of a newbie list you might call it linuxsa-techinical or similar.

That way you can have people who are only interested in tech/newbie stuff
subscrbed to that lisy and people interested in the catfaights can have
the catfights, yet still have the optionof contirbuting to the tech/newbie
list, without inundating it with all the non technical/newbie stuff.

I think this would make the list much more usable for people who want
support or to ask newbie questions.
