And this has just proved what?

You can incite more flameage via the list? Keep the thread going? Bring other
people who couldnt give a rats into this.

How about just dropping it!

&gt;
&gt; Let's deduce some conclusions, mixed with some personal thoughts:
&gt;
&gt; 1) David Lloyd and David Newall
&gt;  - are both adept at eliciting huge responses from the mailing list
&gt;  - speaking only for myself, sometimes I do it unwittingly
&gt;
&gt; PROOF:
&gt;  - My SINGLE supposed flame started almost 20% of the last 11 days'
&gt; discussion
&gt;
&gt; 2) Richard Russell
&gt;  - a lone voice of reason, in the wilderness
&gt;  - I've seen him there before
&gt;
&gt; PROOF:
&gt;  - Neither Davd Newall or myself appear to be attempting to seriously
&gt; stop the debate, yet I would suspect Richard is
&gt;
&gt; Greg Lehey
&gt;  - a known malformed e-mail hater
&gt;  - has been surprisingly quiet on this subject
&gt;
&gt; PROOF:
&gt;  - in the pudding; he's found third from the most prolific poster on
&gt; this subject
&gt;
&gt; Dale Long
&gt;  - speaks the second longest on our favourite topic
&gt;  - actually proposes a solution
&gt;
&gt; PROOF:
&gt;  - again view the figures
&gt;  - and he's been proposing a solution for ages
&gt;
&gt; Andrew Reid
&gt;  - has produced a humungous document which, in online readability terms,
&gt; is about as readable as the "House of Representative Practice", which is
&gt; written in at most 8 point font, at least 1/2 the size again of A4 and
&gt; many thousands of pages long
&gt;  - is obviously dedicated to making this list a better place but lost in
&gt; the wilderness
&gt;
&gt; PROOF:
&gt;  - well, the discussion centers mainly around his posts
&gt;  - his God has definitely forsaken him
&gt;
&gt; What have I proven?
&gt;
&gt; * that it is possible in a mailing list for one, or two person
&gt; deliberately or inadvertently working in tandem, to create 20% of total
&gt; traffic
&gt; * it is possible, if you look at the content, that discussing matters
&gt; such as group norms is not the best thing to do via e-mail; such
&gt; discussions happen much more efficiently face to face
&gt;
&gt; In addition, I hope to not have to release a second edition of this
&gt; e-mail, entitled "absurd statistics"...
