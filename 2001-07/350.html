It depends on their system(s) obviously, and what they want to do.

12 months ago we purchased an Intel Storage Station (now discontinued)
to supplement our NT server.
On the face of it, the St. Stn. was great, but implementation let it down.
The short of the story is that it provided only basic file security & it 
had a couple annoying hassles with our NT box, which we were unable to solve
thru a lot of contact with Intel, they didnt want to know basically.

So we replaced it with a dedicated Samba box sharing 30g.  The Samba box is
part of the NT domain, & while it is still a little messy in that we synch
passwords between the two using cron jobs, its been rock-solid for the past
12
months.  At some stage I want to reconfigure it using Winbind in the Samba 
setup & also implement ACLs so as to make file security a bit better.
Also the other advantage of us running Linux as opposed to a NAS is that we
can run other stuff on there as well.  Currently we have Teamware Office set
up on the same box for their calendar system, plus Arcserve to take care of 
backup.  Backup is usually another issue with NAS, the Intel box had
mirrored
drives, but thats useless if the box goes up in smoke..........

I'm unsure what the current range of NASes provide in the way of user auth.
&
security, but if there's any out there running Linux/BSD & a Winbind version
of Samba, I'd probably go with a NAS, depending on the tech support
available
at their site (tho Linux won't fall over much so this shouldn't be an issue 
either way :o)

Bottom line is, what do they want to achieve?  Fit the solution to the
problem.

Subject: NAS vs Linux


Anyone got any opinions on NAS vs Linux? A client of mine wants to do
something about their storage situation, and my natural solution is Linux
(they already have a linux server doing this, but it's full and messy). They
suspect that a NAS device would be easier to manage... anyone got any
opinions?
