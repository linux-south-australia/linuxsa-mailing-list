Prakash!

&gt; i have installes ucd-snmp from the tar.gz module now i want to upgrade
&gt; it.

I see.

You could try starting the configure EXACTLY as you did before, then
doing "make uninstall".

[root]# ./configure INSERT_FLAGS_YOU_USED_HERE_IF_ANY
...
[root]# make uninstall

That would get rid of what it installed at the start, but it may not get
rid of old configuration files or it may not even work. Many makefiles
don't include the uninstall option.

&gt; i need to know how to uninstall this installed module.

You could also do similar to the above, but instead of make uninstall:

[root]# make install &gt;& make.log

Then read the "make.log" and work out what it's installed (it should say
so).

&gt; i know rpm -u command,but it works only if the module is installed
&gt; from the rpm package.

That's true.

&gt; it is risky to directly upgrade the existing version since i am not
&gt; sure the new version will put its files

What is the new version?

If it's an RPM package, you can do:

[root]# rpm -qlp [the rpm file name]

You may want to pipe that to less or more.

That tells you what files the RPM installs.

If the thing has a home page, you could try visiting the home
page...they may have a discussion there about upgrading.

DSL

(ps:

Whatever you did then with your settings stopped whatever you use from
sending totally incomprehensible e-mails to an e-mail that displays as
HTML. Hence, it's easier for me to read but much more irritating.

Nonetheless, I think we've started to help you find a solution for your
problem.

As a side note, if you have a development system, you could test it on
that...that way you're not blowing your main system out of the water.

I'm in a good mood at the moment - [I've had a big lunch and I'm too
tired to argue].
