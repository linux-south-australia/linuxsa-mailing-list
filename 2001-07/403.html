&gt; a dead end? i have no problems - as such. i have heard about this mdk 8 not
&gt; being very ... complete/stable. either way, im a mandrake fan and wont to
&gt; give it a go. Is there anyone in the city who has this on cd, which i could
&gt; borrow?

The official word from Linus & Alan is that all new development should be
done with the new kernel. They also said they wouldn't accept new drivers
and stuff for 2.2 unless they are also produced for 2.4.
Plus, 2.2 just doesn't scale up as well, with filesystem, process, threads,
memory, etc. limits. 2.4 is faster too, has more features, better design,
better support for new hardware, and has been nice and stable for me.

Check out the various webpages detailing the differences between the two
kernel branches, and you'll see what i mean ;)

basically, if 2.2 works for you, you may as well stick with it, but as soon
as you need something nifty, just swap to 2.4 -- you'll want to do it
eventually  anyway.

&gt;
&gt; just upgrade to mandrake 8 and you'll get the 2.4.x kernel, usb support and
&gt; apps, etc. etc. easily. Stick with mandrake, don't go to redhat.
&gt;
&gt; You could just upgrade the kernel + utils manually, but if you've never
&gt; compiled something before, it'll probably take you a week of trial and error
&gt; before you get anywhere.
&gt;
&gt; 2.4 kernels are just simply much better.. 2.2 is a dead end..

&gt; &gt; Andrew,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; right now i have my usb mouse (with an adaptor) going into the ps2
&gt; &gt; &gt; port.
&gt; &gt; &gt; what do i need to do to use USB?
&gt; &gt; Why would you want to use a mouse with USB? Sure USB is cool, but i dont
&gt; see
&gt; &gt; how a mouse can make any use of it, it only needs PS/2. The PS/2 port was
&gt; made
&gt; &gt; for the mouse/kbd so use it. Sure having a USB scanner with no external
&gt; power
&gt; &gt; is good, so save the USB port for that!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; i am using Mandrake 7.2 with no modification to the kernel.
&gt; &gt; More than likely check if you have 2.2.18 (or did manduckshit 7.2 have a
&gt; 2.4.xx
&gt; &gt; kernel??)
&gt; &gt; you will need to RTFM then recomple and RTFM again.
