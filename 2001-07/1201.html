Hi Ian,

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;Remember, the exam was supposedly to evaluate Administration
&lt;level skills in a Windoes 2000 Server environment.
Well...to be exact...it focuses on the candidates ability to
install, configure, and administer Windows 2000 member servers
...and not domain servers.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;I never insinuated cheating. Those are your words.
Ok...let me make it clear then...anyone who relies solely on
cramsessions and braindumps to pass exams is a CHEAT...they
are cheating themselves...and more importantly...others out of
the respect that they deserve.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;Basically they worked through the brain dumps and fed the
&lt;answers back into the machine to gain high scores.
Like I said before...these people are soon found out.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;Some who had actual practical experience in administering large
&lt;networks failed...I am talking factual information gathered by
&lt;experience.
Well my experience with these exams makes me wonder how anyone
could fail them if they studied the appropriate course notes and
practiced the skills taught...relying purely on practical experience
is not enough as quite often less common features are tested.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;None of them had a job. None of them had ever had a job in IT.
How did you expect them to get "real" experience then?

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;What I am saying is that the experience and work that genuine students
&lt;have put into gaining a qualification that really means something is
&lt;watered down by others who have only learned how to give the right
&lt;answers to the set questions on a screen. The big difference will come
&lt;when these people get into a position on the basis of their MCP.  Then
&lt;their employer will be wondering just how they managed to get their MCP
&lt;with minimal knowledge. What this does is lessen the value of the MCP.
&lt;It tarnishes the expectation of a level, a standard to measure ability
&lt;by.
Amen...brother.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;If MS were to adopt this standard then their evaluation would tend to
&lt;weed out the 'book-learned' as they would not have built up the
&lt;analytical and practical skills required for the task.
Disagree...the exam format is fine and has been improved since the NT4
exams...the problem here is that some people have no self-respect and
are prepared to do anything...including being dishonest to pass...this
is not just a MCP/MCSE issue...but all certifications...even University
degrees.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;I would be honoured to be able to have the skills and knowledge to pass
&lt;the Red Hat testing.
Yep...me too...don't forget time.

Regards,
Richard Watkins

P.S. Are you still looking for volunteers...I live in Brahma Lodge and
may be able to assist...as long as you don't refer to me as a nerd. :oP
