Could you please qualify this? Are you just making a blanket comment based
on general unix bias opinion?

&gt; &gt; Intercept, as in meet mid-way between sender and list server, then do
&gt; &gt; whatever it wants with the message, such as notify sender and allow the
&gt; &gt; message to continue to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, you've invented your own definition. I took mine from the dictionary

There are more contextual usages than that. Intercept can imply meeting,
but not always stoppping.
 
&gt; &gt; A quick pass throught something like a perl script takes hardly any time
&gt; &gt; at all. Especially if you examine the mime types, identify that there is a
&gt; &gt; compund message, remove the html mime sub block and and rebuild remove the
&gt; &gt; reference to it.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, Why? Just let the poster know and answer their question.

Because it may be of benefit to list users, while at the same time not
acting like a neo-nazi controller of information. The message gets to the
list either way and the HTML sender is always sent a short polite and
helpful reminder either way.

&gt; &gt; I am not advocating removal of HTML, but it seems to crash other people's
&gt; &gt; browsers and cause them to become nastly etc... It might just be 'a better
&gt; &gt; service' to list users. I have personally had no problems with HTML mail.
&gt; 
&gt; Crash other browsers? Even the ones which don't render properly in David
&gt; Lloyd's mail client seem to be 'replyable'.

I meant email client. I agree. On the _joking_ side, we could have a "How
to reply to HTML senders" 

&gt; &gt; Read above. The stripper would most likely take not much more extra CPU
&gt; &gt; than it does for procmail or similar tools. It could even be made a
&gt; &gt; resident process so you don't get the process startup overhead.
&gt; 
&gt; Why? It's a waste of time. BTW, there is a product called demime which
&gt; is used by OpenBSD's mailing lists to remove bits which may be better
&gt; than a home-grown script.

All products start as a home-grown-something. The choice is; do we
evaluate and use what other people have already written, or do we write
our own?

&gt; &gt; I agree. But I have also done some work that does this sort reading in and
&gt; &gt; processing email including slicing of HTML mime and leaving the text. I am
&gt; &gt; sure a regular expression or two could convert &lt;XXX&gt; etc.. to nothing or
&gt; &gt; [XX] so that a mail client can read the text and not interpret the HTML or
&gt; &gt; embeded scripts.
&gt; 
&gt; That's not going to work every time. You'll end up with some messages
&gt; comming through looking like they've had a bad run in with a savage dog.

And HTML mail does not already look mangled in a plain text mail client?

There are two types of mail.

Those with a MIME component that is clearly market and removed. There is
usually a text compnent that is paired with the HTML part.

The other instance and the only time where the actual tags would have to
be removed would be when there is no plain text or plain text part, or
when the whole message is HTML.

Dale.
