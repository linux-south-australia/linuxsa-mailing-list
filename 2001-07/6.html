&gt; OK, I'll work on that paragraph to make it sound a little less
&gt; obligitory. Netscape was listed in the document as one of the mailers

That is my point. Thing can behave just as badly under 'unix' as they do
under Windows.

&gt; OK, you've changed your tone a bit. I got the impression from your last
&gt; post that we should "For example intercepting HTML".
&gt; 
&gt; The dictionary.com definition of intercepting:
&gt; 
&gt; 	tr.v. in·ter·cept·ed, in·ter·cept·ing, in·ter·cepts
&gt; 
&gt; 	"To stop, deflect, or interrupt the progress or intended course
&gt; 	 of: intercepted me with a message as I was leaving."

Intercept, as in meet mid-way between sender and list server, then do
whatever it wants with the message, such as notify sender and allow the
message to continue to the list.

&gt; Indeed I did. You did imply that by your use of the word "intercepting".
&gt; I have to say that I've not seen your other posts when you "...have
&gt; incidcated that the messages gets through...".
&gt; 
&gt; Now, stripping the message of HTML would be a bit of a pain in the neck,
&gt; so why not just let it through and let someone tell them when they
&gt; answer the question.

A quick pass throught something like a perl script takes hardly any time
at all. Especially if you examine the mime types, identify that there is a
compund message, remove the html mime sub block and and rebuild remove the
reference to it.

I am not advocating removal of HTML, but it seems to crash other people's
browsers and cause them to become nastly etc... It might just be 'a better
service' to list users. I have personally had no problems with HTML mail.

&gt; There's not that much traffic on LinuxSA, but I'm sure a HTML stripper
&gt; would take up unnecessary amounts of CPU time. Just let it through. The
&gt; document "How to get best results from LinuxSA" explains how one should
&gt; go about letting "offenders" know about their "crime".

Read above. The stripper would most likely take not much more extra CPU
than it does for procmail or similar tools. It could even be made a
resident process so you don't get the process startup overhead.

&gt; Perhaps, as an example, the responder would write something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt; Posters HTML message here.
&gt; 
&gt; 	Your message was sent in HTML. LinuxSA does not appreciate the
&gt; 	use of HTML email. Please use plain text. See 
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html</A> for more information.
&gt; 
&gt; 	[ Question answered here ]
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And that simple change would solve a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. It'd take less effort to use the method detailed above.

I agree. But I have also done some work that does this sort reading in and
processing email including slicing of HTML mime and leaving the text. I am
sure a regular expression or two could convert &lt;XXX&gt; etc.. to nothing or
[XX] so that a mail client can read the text and not interpret the HTML or
embeded scripts.

But we should start with your suggestions.

&gt; &gt; You need to both communicate the 'policy' and 'ways to meet the policy',
&gt; &gt; and if you can have a machine do the work for you in a positive way that
&gt; &gt; doesn't interfere, to meet this policy, then it makes things easier for
&gt; &gt; everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; The method detailed above does both those things. Whatsmore, it gets the
&gt; question answered in one simple message.

&gt; Filtering/stripping HTML mail before it hits the list is unnecessary.

But it will give some list member less to complain about. :-)
They won't know the original message was ever HTML.

Dale.
