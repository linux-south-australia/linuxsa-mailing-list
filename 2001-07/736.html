&gt;&gt; Have you looked into SYN cookies?

&gt; Syn cookies is ok but only after 3 or more connections from the same client

SYN cookies do not drop connections; SYN cookies, for want of a better
explanation, maintain state without using memory during the initial
handshake via a (crypto) hashing function.  Its reason for existence is
to prevent resource starvation issues under SYN flood attacks, forged or
otherwise.

&gt; Thus the need to verify the SYN before a port is opened.

Doesn't this just shift the problem to the machine in front of
the firewall?  How does it stop having its SYN queue from
being flooded, whether in kernel or user space?  More to the
point, why isn't the firewall capable of handling this?

&gt; However, you must first catch the SYN as it leaves TCP and
&gt; before it hits the firewall.  Otherwise you will have an
&gt; open port on a firewall until it times out.

No, the "port doesn't open" until you receive the final ACK back from
the client, at least at the application level - this is the point
where accept() unblocks (for normal blocking listening sockets) and
returns the new file descriptor.  What is most likely happening is
that your firewall is maintaining data between SYN (SYN-ACK) and ACK,
which is where the DoS is coming in.

&gt; Whereas if you can catch it
&gt; before it hits the firewall and verify that the connection is established
&gt; you can pass the session to the firewall without losing performance as the
&gt; time the port is open without connection and until timeout coupled with the
&gt; magnatude of the attack is what kills the server.

Is your firewall and server one and the same?

&gt; Once the attack is underway and the syn proxy sees that it is recieving
&gt; constant incomplete syns from client it is added to the bad IP DB and ALL
&gt; connections are refused to that client for approx. 24-48 hours (when the DB
&gt; is cleared of old IP's) thus dialin IP's are open again inside of 24 hours
&gt; for use.

Cool - so someone could start a forged SYN flood of, say, some large ISP's
proxy cache farm, and this software would obligingly block it?  That
smells of DoS too.

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
