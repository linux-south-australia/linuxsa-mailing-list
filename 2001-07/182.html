&gt; You will have a list of people who need help mailling one or two people who
&gt; have the time and desire to help. The thing I have noticed
&gt; is how many people are saying "ill cc both", "ill read both lists" etc etc.
&gt; Ill be blunt, thats crap. If you were happy to do that, you would

The point isnt t reduce email in for people like us(whatever people like
us are like), the point is to reduce it so that people who want help, but
dont want the eternal flame wars(which I and I a sure many others enjoy) ,
can get help wiothout having to deal wth a huge philospophical devabre
consuming megabytes of data, hours of time and thousands of words, every
time someone inadvertantly doesnt live up to the (non written) standards
of the list(eg sedns gasp...html).



&gt; have just as much email as you do now, you wouldnt have to manually sort it
&gt; however but you would still have to deal with HTML email
&gt; and "newbie" posts therefore you might read it one month or so when you
&gt; feel with it.
&gt; 
&gt; I know there are a lot of people are out there who do help on this list. I
&gt; know that from first hand knowledge. But its the old story,
&gt; "out of sight, out of mind".
&gt; 
&gt; You break a community up into a "newbie" and a "geek" group. What do you
&gt; end up with, you end up with a few scenarios. People will
&gt; get sick of posting to the "newbies" list because no one replies and you
&gt; end up with the same problem we have now. People are
&gt; too scared to post to the "geek" list in the fear of being flammed to
&gt; death. People start posting to the "geek" list thinking they are "all
&gt; that".
&gt; What do you gain? Makes your life easier? Is that worth breaking up a
&gt; community?

Well you cna only end up with one scenario.

But anyway, th e community will be exactly as it is now. Thsi list will
still exist.

Some peopel might leave this list and move tot eh help/tech/newbie list,
which woudl really be quite telling. Thena gain they might not.

But this community woudl stil exist and it woudl allow other people to
particpate in a subset of this community, who otherwise might jsut leave
after a day or two  because of techinical intimidation or not being able
to live up to teh email format nazis(no soup for you!)

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; .....and yes, I have to manually sort every email every morning... Im happy
&gt; with that, because I'll actually read the email now and might
&gt; be able to help the user now, not in a month when I get board.

Thast great for you but it might not suit everyone.
Especially if they need to get osmetign done.

It can sometimes take half an hour to find areply in this eamil, even if
you know what hte subject line is.

SOme people will just give up rather than deal with the hassle.

If you  want linux to be everywehere and accessable to everyone, you have
to allow for people who dont ahve the time, inclinaiton or intestinal
fortitude to deal with alist like this, but still might need help.

A tech list which is atuo cc'd to this list would be ideal imo.
