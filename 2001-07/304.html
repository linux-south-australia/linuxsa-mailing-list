&gt; I think that the GNU/BSD debate is a good one. It helps to develop
&gt; and understanding of what could be seen as important issues in
&gt; today's world.

*sigh*  It's bad enough having to put up with this on FreeBSD-chat.

&gt; I personally think that the GNU license makes a better world given
&gt; there are those who would not give back.

It depends a lot on what you want to achieve.  The fact is that most
people in the computer industry need to make money.  So far the only
proven way to make money out of software is to sell or license it,
both of which are impossible with the GPL.  This makes the GPL a
somewhat idealistic licensing mechanism.  I also don't give it much of
a hope when somebody finally challenges it in court.

The BSD license doesn't have these disadvantages.  It doesn't have
much in the way of advantages either, unfortunately.  IBM has
repeatedly stated that if they release free source code, it will be
under a variant of the GPL called the IPL (no prizes for guessing what
that is).  The BSD license would allow competitors to subsume the code
and use it to their own advantage.

But let's not talk about licenses.  There are much more interesting
topics for flam^H^H^H^Hdiscussion.
