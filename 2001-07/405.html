David,

Thanks for your reply!

&gt; yes a toshiba tecra 530CDT (it's a relatively old one, P166
&gt; and 32Mb RAM but runs debian quite nicely)

Dont worry, I heard running Linux can take years off a machine's age d;-)
Something about less stress on the hardware due to better uptimes and less
crashing?

&gt; I test drove a few before buying the toshiba (second hand) and
&gt; this one with a P166 felt much faster than higher power no-name
&gt; brands (eg. a P233 in one case).  I'd stick with toshiba, ibm
&gt; etc personally.  I've heard new Dell's can come with linux pre-installed.

I'd love to get a brand name, but my generic centerlink income says no.
Both my boxes are generic celeron 600's hand made with love. Well, I couldnt
afford a pre built system (or the microsoft tax) so I built my own.
Which is why I dont like computer shops much, I found out how easy it was!

&gt; yes, my gateway machine is an AMD duron 700, it runs great
&gt; (debian again)

I thought I was being silly!

&gt; my favourite is one place (in sydney) who couldn't understand
&gt; why I wanted a scsi cd burner ("but ide is much cheaper").
&gt; When I explained one reason was so I could move it between my linux
&gt; pc and a Sun, he didn't know what a Sun was and hadn't heard
&gt; of Sun Microsystems.  I left.

As you do, it only took me a few months to realize that most stuff worked
regardless of what the "experts" think. They still refuse to believe that my
Iomega buz card and zip drive Work Without Windows.

I would love to see a shop that sells only linux computers and harware know
to run on linux. You know, somewhere you can have a chat to the staff and
talk about linux and they will not only know what it is, but they would be
running it themselves. Let alone knowing that what you see will work and the
staff will help if it needs a bit of twaeking to make it so.

Thanks again for your reassurance re the AMD chip!
I now realize how silly that question was.

Jay
