OK, no sense argueing this with you guys as you are not willing to help.
I'll just let the tests speak for themselves.

Thanks anyway,

&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; SYN cookies do not drop connections;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Who said anything about syncookies dropping a connection?
&gt;
&gt; OK, maybe I read more intent into your statement than was intended -
&gt; would you mind clarifying that statement?  What exactly is being
&gt; "dropped", or who is doing the dropping?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; More to the point, why isn't the firewall capable of handling this?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; NO. Read it again. this is not the firewalls responsibility.  This is a
TCP
&gt; &gt; issue only.
&gt;
&gt; The firewall runs TCP, so it does fall within the baliwick of the
&gt; firewall.  Any modern, decent (read: "corporate class") firewall
&gt; should be able to cope robustly under such conditions.  If it doesn't,
&gt; then I would like the name of it to add to my "Products to avoid at
&gt; all costs" list.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However, you must first catch the SYN as it leaves TCP and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; before it hits the firewall.  Otherwise you will have an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; open port on a firewall until it times out.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; No, the "port doesn't open" until you receive the final ACK back from
&gt; &gt;&gt; the client, at least at the application level - this is the point
&gt; &gt;&gt; where accept() unblocks (for normal blocking listening sockets) and
&gt; &gt;&gt; returns the new file descriptor.  What is most likely happening is
&gt; &gt;&gt; that your firewall is maintaining data between SYN (SYN-ACK) and ACK,
&gt; &gt;&gt; which is where the DoS is coming in.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Which part is wrong, or is the entire paragraph wrong?  I said the
&gt; "port doesn't open at the application level".  I said that your
&gt; firewall is maintaining state, which it must be in order to have
&gt; "have an open port on a firewall".  Ports don't open until the
&gt; three way handshake is complete.  What you have here is the
&gt; "half-open" situation.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; read the rfc.
&gt;
&gt; Any in particular, or will 793 do?  And if you are referring to 793,
&gt; don't confuse specification with implementation - it merely suggests
&gt; how TCP may be implemented, not mandates it.  TCP stacks, in real life,
&gt; can and are implemented differently without violating 793 (one of
&gt; the funkiest I can remember is Douglas Comer's implementation for
&gt; Xinu, which used multiple cooperating user space processes ).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; the port that the connection comes in on is the one
&gt; &gt; that is open and awaiting info.
&gt;
&gt; Correct - a _single_ TCB.  One socket in a listening state, one "network
&gt; structure".  That in and of itself can not cause a DoS under a SYN flood.
&gt; Under "traditional" TCP implementations, when a SYN is received for a
&gt; socket that is passively open, another TCB structure is allocated (to
&gt; record sequence numbers, connection details etc.) and SYN-ACK is then
&gt; sent back.  This allocation of a TCB structure is the resource that gets
&gt; consumed in a DoS situation.  SYN cookies circumvents this by doing away
&gt; with the need to allocate the TCB to record the details in and encoding
&gt; it in the SYN-ACK packet that gets sent back in acknowledgement to the
&gt; SYN, thus removing the resource that gets starved in a SYN flood attack.
&gt; This does not violate 793 either (well, slightly - because it can't
&gt; encode all the attributes, from memory[1] things like certain TCP
&gt; options can't be used).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Is your firewall and server one and the same?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; could be.  depends on how it's set up.
&gt;
&gt; You stated that you were servicing a "100 MBp connection" - I would
&gt; hope that they were separate machines, otherwise you are going to
&gt; suffer performance problems when under attack.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cool - so someone could start a forged SYN flood of, say, some large
ISP's
&gt; &gt;&gt; proxy cache farm, and this software would obligingly block it?  That
&gt; &gt;&gt; smells of DoS too.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; How?  DoS is external to internal and unwanted.
&gt;
&gt; I'm talking about _forged_ external DoS.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, the packets from the
&gt; &gt; cache farm would be out of sync anyway and not work.  All that would
happen
&gt; &gt; is a bunch of resets are generated and the IP is eventually blocked as a
Bad
&gt; &gt; IP.
&gt;
&gt; OK, maybe I didn't spell it out in enough detail.  The large ISP's proxy
&gt; cache is external to the resource you're protecting, and the attack
&gt; launched from a third IP address (using a forged source IP address,
&gt; coincidently matching the cache's IP address) has just successfully
&gt; caused the software protecting that resource to block that IP address.
&gt; Now no-one from the large ISP is able to connect to the protected
&gt; resource, despite being purely incidental to the attack scenario.
&gt; Validating the IP source address relies (roughly) on getting ACK back
&gt; with the correct details (eg, ACK = SEQ + 1), which can be easy when
&gt; used against a TCP stack with predicitable sequence numbers (something
&gt; nmap reports on, btw), but as you've already stated that you're blocking
&gt; half-open connections, the above attack could work without modification
&gt; (with one caveat - if you process RSTs back from the legitimate source
&gt; forged IP host, saying WTF to the SYN-ACK's you've been sending it).
&gt;
&gt;

&gt; [1]  I use the expression "from memory" a lot - people who read this
&gt;      in my posts can append "and likely to be incorrect" without
&gt;      affecting the statement in any way.
