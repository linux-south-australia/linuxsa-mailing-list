Hi David,

First, I started the conversation as I was not impressed with the 
situation that developed on behalf of Adobe, though now we find that it 
was not initiated by Adobe.

While I see merit in your argument it is not the complete picture. To 
claim that only MS could produce a Word Processor means that Word 
Processing should have stopped at WordStar and yes, I am that old.

Maybe we should have stopped spreadsheets with VisiCalc and SuperCalc, 
and yes I am that old too &lt;G&gt;

Maybe we should have stopped automobile development with Henry Ford's 
Model T, and I am nowhere near that old &lt;G&gt;

In many cases the K'ware and other products are not the mere clones 
that may have been the suggestion. They have incorporated other 
features or made the similar functions work in a different and maybe 
improved fashion. This is not limited to free-ware. Innovation is open 
to all and any stifling of that innovation in not in the best interests 
of society. Cloning a product is not innovative nor is it creative and 
I do not agree with that path.

While it is fine for MS to produce an updated version of Word it is 
just as fine for WordPro to be updated. Same for KWord and the Word 
processor in StarOffice. They may be similar but they approach the 
problem in a different fashion. This is healthy for the industry, 
healthy for the users and consumers of these products.

Every producer of products is entitled to be recompensed for their 
innovation and development of a product. To then use that as an 
argument for preventing others from following down that path to produce 
their own competing product is an argument I feel uncomfortable with. I 
agree with copyrights, I agree with trademarks and registrations and in 
some respects even licensing. I am unhappy when those legal tools are 
used to stifle innovation and prevent competition.

Maybe we see the same coin but from different sides.

Cheers,

Ian

Just because we want to make a free program doesn't excuse us from 
stealing other people's ideas.  They spent good effort coming up with 
ideas, proving the market, creating a product, and convincing you and 
me of the need.  It's easy for us to breeze in afterwards, with a free 
equivalent, but that doesn't really benefit society.  It discourages 
people from research, and if we're only going to immitate then 
ultimately society loses big time.
