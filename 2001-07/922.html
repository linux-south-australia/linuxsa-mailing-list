&gt; Also bear in mind the type of nmap you run - if you're only blocking (for
&gt; instance) initial TCP packets with SYN set, and you're running something
&gt; other than a "connect" (SYN) type scan, it will report accurately
&gt; the ports
&gt; that are open from RSTs sent back (but there are ways around this too).

Hmm... I'll have to find out what RST means (/me furthers his TCP/IP
education)

&gt; &gt; (I always wondered why 3128 is the standard -- is that a pre-squid,
&gt; &gt; cache-standard thing?)
&gt;
&gt; I think that's just a squid thing - 8080 was traditionally used
&gt; for non-root
&gt; owned web servers (back when running web servers was less fashionable).

hmm... how odd...

&gt; &gt; On the box in question, I had ipchained it so that external IP addresses
&gt; &gt; couldn't connect to squid at all. I could nmap it from a remote
&gt; host, and
&gt; &gt; would find that 8080 was closed. However, when my friend nmapped, he got
&gt; &gt; 8080 open, and could seemingly get anywhere using that proxy...
&gt;
&gt; Same problem here - our provider transparently proxies port 80, so any
&gt; scans I conduct against clients (hey, _legitimately_  :-) always show as
&gt; port 80 being open.  I'm wondering if you can still get an IP feed that
&gt; doesn't have transparent proxying of some sort on it.

mmm, or if there's some way that ISPs who transparently proxy can give you a
way around it when you want to do something like that...

&gt; &gt; actually interacting with that proxy, and not mine... To be
&gt; honest, I'm not
&gt; &gt; 100% sure that this is the case, but I have no better explanation...
&gt;
&gt; Easy to check - use the logs, Luke! (er, I meant Richard).

Yeah... Next time I'm there, I shall :)
