Hi.

Look, I like a whole lot about Macs and use them extensively, but this
whole PowerPC is twice as fast as same speed Pentium is a load of old
washing. Marketing smokescreen. I have had a 233 mhz G3 running LinuxPPC
sitting next to a 233mhz Pentium with equivalent memory and disk, and the
pentium is just plain faster. I am sure that the Photoshop tests that
Apple proudly displays with each release are correct, but they are not
translatable to your daily computer use unless you spend all day doing
unsharp masks on large image files.

Sure the new powerbooks are seriously cool appliances, and not too bad
value compared to the price differences we saw only a few years ago
between 'equivalent' Mac and PC Laptops. They just don't 'feel' as fast
as a current PC. Load OSX on them and they take a speed hit from that as
well, hopefully Apple will get into optimising OSX and give us back the
speed we had on OS9...

Oh yea, don't pick that Titanium Powerbook up by the corner, aparently the
frame twists and the battery loses contact with it's connectors resulting
in an immediate power-off (oops)

&gt; &gt; Are you kidding?  The new Dells are great.  For about $AUS3000 you get a 
&gt; &gt; 1400x1152 display, PIII800, 128Mb RAM, 20Gb disk, ethernet, modem and DVD that 
&gt; &gt; is reliable, and very Linux friendly.  Titanium may by nice, but I'd rather 
&gt; &gt; have $AUS4000 change in my pocket.  You can up spec the Dells to go the 
&gt; &gt; CDRW/DVD-ROM route, as well as having up to 3 &gt;25GB drives and 1Gb RAM if you 
&gt; &gt; want a super grunty.
&gt; 
&gt; Ick. I don't like those "great" new Dell laptops. 
&gt; 
&gt; For $5495 you get a 400MHz G4, 15.2" XGA Display, 128MB SDRAM, 10GB Hard
&gt; DIsk, DVD, Ethernet, Modem, 2 USB Ports, 1 FireWire Port, Inbuilt
&gt; Antenna for Wireless networking, OS9, iMovie 2 and QuickTime. Whatsmore,
&gt; it's only 2.45cm thick and 2.4kg heavy.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;drewl&gt; There's a bit of a price difference, but I'd say that the
&gt; PowerBook would come out in front. I saw a 500MHz PowerBook beat a
&gt; 1.2GHz P4 at a whole bunch of stuff (including PhotoShop). Mind you,
&gt; that was a test done by Apple, but it seemed fairly believable.
