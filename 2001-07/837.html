&gt; &gt; I've never had any problems with swat, I find it very good.
&gt; 
&gt; The only problem I have with swat is that it blasts away the comments
&gt; you put in there when hand editing the file.

I've found SWAT useful mainly for the status page for viewing current
connections.  It's not absolutely ideal, but works ok.  I've hacked a
couple of basic scripts to grep out users and/or files using Webmin's
custom command page as the frontend, this seems to work better, not so
much info on one page.


&gt;You have to know what each
&gt;option is likely to do before you go doing things, in which case, you
&gt;would be better off editing the default smb.conf and using the comments
&gt;in that for guidelines.

In some respects its almost the same with manually editing smb.conf.
At least with manual editing you have to know what you want b4 putting it
in, with SWAT it can be a bit easy to change something without really
knowing what it does, maybe that was your point.
One handy thing with SWAT is that it takes you directly to a man page for 
each parameter from a help button next to each entry.

Having said that, now that I'm relatively familiar with setting up Samba,
I usually revert to manual editing if I ever need to change something :o)
(which is very rarely these days, it just works! ;o)
