&gt; &gt; Also, I dont know how far you'd get without paying
&gt; any
&gt; &gt; money, if you rang up Compaq or IBM or whatever 10
&gt; &gt; months down the track and it wasn't a warrantied
&gt; dead
&gt; &gt; piece of hardware you wanted fixed...
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, not far. But, by the same token, if a PC
&gt; was taken to you
&gt; with "FIXME" written on it (and it was outside of
&gt; its warranty), surely
&gt; you're going to charge for your time.

agreed. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; To keep it relevant to Linux, if you installed
&gt; Linux
&gt; &gt; ontoa Compaq I dont know how much help you would
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; from them either if something broke...
&gt; 
&gt; That applies to most computer retailers. 

agreed.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A bank absolutely needs no downtime. 
&gt; 
&gt; And they feel they can get this through purchasing
&gt; brand-name.

Agreed; and given they probably purchase the expensive
service agreements as well, they would almost
certainly get fast turnaround as well.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was on a job where we had IBM servers, and a
&gt; disk
&gt; &gt; interface failed, and we were in the middle of the
&gt; &gt; bush, and we still managed to get replacements
&gt; inside
&gt; &gt; a couple of days, this was pretty impressive given
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; environment, but then these beastys cost $10k+, so
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; get what you pay for.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'll take it that your "Sleazy Joes" is not
&gt; tarring
&gt; &gt; all independant computer servicepeople with the
&gt; same
&gt; &gt; brush...
&gt; 
&gt; Heh. Not all of the independant computer
&gt; servicepeople are dodgy. I'm
&gt; just saying that there are a lot of undesirables out
&gt; there.

Agreed.

&gt; &gt; Are you contradicting youself here? Or were you in
&gt; &gt; shock because the price was so low?
&gt; 
&gt; I was in shock as Compaq told me I was going to have
&gt; to pay $260 for
&gt; 64MB of standard, SODIM SDRAM. The fact that the RAM
&gt; had a Compaq
&gt; sticker on it apparently increases its value by a
&gt; couple-hundred
&gt; dollars.

Well, that was exactly my point. Why pay a price
premium unnecessarily if you are Joe Home User?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ;-) Who is this "Leader" anyway ?
&gt; 
&gt; Leader are probably the biggest wholesaler in South
&gt; Australia. You buy
&gt; from them when you purchase lots of computer goods
&gt; 'coz it's cheaper :-)

uh huh. There are other wholesalers, this Leader is
one I havent bothered to find to about; I am quite
happy with the ones I use.

it seems we agree on most things here... I think I'll
get back to posting on Linux related issues now ;-)
