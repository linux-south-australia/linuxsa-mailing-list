&gt; While I see merit in your argument it is not the complete picture. To
&gt; claim that only MS could produce a Word Processor means that Word
&gt; Processing should have stopped at WordStar and yes, I am that old.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Every producer of products is entitled to be recompensed for their
&gt; innovation and development of a product. To then use that as an
&gt; argument for preventing others from following down that path to produce
&gt; their own competing product is an argument I feel uncomfortable with. I
&gt; agree with copyrights, I agree with trademarks and registrations and in
&gt; some respects even licensing. I am unhappy when those legal tools are
&gt; used to stifle innovation and prevent competition.

IMHO, short-lived patents and copyrights are the solution. Patents (at least
in software) should be harder to get (as in harder to prove, not more
expensive), cheaper, better enforced, but shorter lived (five years
maximum). Copyrights should be 20 years max.

Both Patents and Copyrights were primarily invented to protect small
inventors from being ripped off by imitators, whether large or small... The
bigger companies barely need the protection, yet they benefit the most from
it.

I kinda think it could be worth making Patents far more expensive for big
companies -- perhaps link their cost to the revenue of the company
concerned, or to the revenue from products covered by the patent... Also
allow them to be cancellable by said companies if they become too expensive
(there's no point in having a product that is very profitable if 50% of
revenues are going to Patent fees....)

And IMHO, OS software needs to be respectful of copyrights and patents, and
attempt to prove the value of the GPL (etc) through real original
innovation. There is little honour in innovating in minor ways, and basing
99% of your product on someone else's innovation... ie I'd expect
KIllustrator to be as different to Illustrator as Corel Draw is...

PS dammit -- I wasn't ever going to send another non-technical mail to this
list... :)
