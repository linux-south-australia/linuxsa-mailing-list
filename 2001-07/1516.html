Hi There!

&gt; i wanted acls. and there were acls. it works fine under linux. 

Hmmm...

&gt; so if you
&gt; ssh to my host, you can set acls to your files. but how can i ask samba
&gt; to set acls? 

Why don't you visit <A HREF="http://www.samba.org/">http://www.samba.org/</A> and look it up?

&gt; so how can a windows user set acls on a linux share?

Why don't you visit <A HREF="http://www.samba.org/">http://www.samba.org/</A> and look it up? A book such as
Inside Windows 2000 by New Rider might come in handy  (but I notice your
country, and I think it may not be available; perhaps Microsoft's
support site _might_ help. My understanding is you can almost get Samba
running the over the right file system to look as though it actually is
NTFS/Win2KFS so you'll need to understand what you're doing on Windows
_first_).

I know that ACL's work with Samba 2.2.1 and XFS, and that others have
gotten it working (without having to ask the XFS or Samba list) so my
suggestion would be to start having a look at the documentation, read
up, make sure you know how to turn on verbose debugging and logging and
wait for the first problem for us to diagnose.

If you do have a problem that has occured you might want to post a more
detailed explanation.

Now, if you mean how do I set and use the permissions on my ext2 (linux)
file system and how do these permissions interact with Samba then a
default smb.conf will help with all its comments. Look up things like
read only, write only, guest = no for a start.
