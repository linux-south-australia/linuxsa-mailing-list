Your XML is not well-formed. It should look something more like:

&lt;shameless_plug I_hope_this_wont_start_another_endless_flame_war="1"&gt;
                                                                 ^ ^
[ ... ]

&lt;/shameless_plug&gt;
 ^
&gt; &lt;shameless_plug&gt;

See above. You've opened another &lt;shameless_plug&gt; tag, and haven't
closed eiher of them.

&gt; ??? If he was selling you a
&gt; [Compaq/IBM/HP/Dell/Packard], I hope you asked him
&gt; where the reset button was for when it crashes ...

I've found that the brand-name PCs have less hardware-related faults
than the generic "Leader PC".

&gt; &lt;rant&gt;
&gt; (If I had $1 for the number of times a new Windows
&gt; Compaq/IBM/HP/Packard PC has crashed and I have had to
&gt; teach someone that they have to hold the power button
&gt; down for 6 seconds, instead of just pressing the reset
&gt; switch... )
&gt; &lt;/rant&gt;

Ah, well done. You've written the XML properly :-) The brand-name PCs
that I've worked with have been extremely reliable, well built and easy
to work on, which is more than what can be said about the crud that
comes out of a certain South Australian computer
wholesaler/manufacturer.

&gt; I cant help you there. I have been thinking of doing
&gt; this myself at some stage.. probably someone else on
&gt; the list will know.

Bear in mind that a RedHat qualification on its own isn't going to be
much use to you. You need to combine the piece of paper with experience
and other knowledge. For example, a reasonably solid understanding of
TCP/IP networking will make you a lot more useful than if you were to
have only the RedHat Qualification.
