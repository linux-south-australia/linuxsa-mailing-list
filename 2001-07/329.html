You'll find good stuff at www.t10.org.


&gt; My recollection is that it isn't defined either way (i.e. low level or
&gt; "high" level, for want of a better term).

No, it says what I quoted: "FORMAT UNIT command formats the media into
addressable logical blocks."  I have not looked to see what "format" is
defined to mean, but my experience is that it means a low-level format.
Does "high level format" have any meaning if all you plan to do is write
zeroes?  In what sense is that formatting?

&gt;&gt; not the same as, "Most drives don't support the concept of a "low level
&gt;&gt; format" these days"
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps not, but it does put the kibosh on your "Wrong.  Completely wrong."

Without really wanting to engage in semantic debate (he said as he engaged
in semantic debate), no, "wrong" must be taken in the context of "most."
You are indeed wrong unless most drives (and it's understood we mean
specifically SCSI drives, otherwise there's no argument) really don't
support the concept of a low level format.
