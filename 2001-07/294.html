&gt; I haven't read your particular, "One of IBM's SCSI storage PDF books,"

It was an attempt to back up my assertion.  As I can't post any more of
it (it's not for redistribution), a similar online version is at
<A HREF="http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/products/vss/books/vsscmst.htm">http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/products/vss/books/vsscmst.htm</A>
(for a different product).  IBM are at least consistently wrong, eh?
(I did search for other documents outside of IBM - they just appear
to be the most prolofic on the subject).

&gt; The SCSI standard
&gt; says that the "FORMAT UNIT command formats the media into addressable
&gt; logical blocks,"

I actually went looking for the standard previously, as my SCSI
documentation has been lost down the passage of time, and couldn't
find any online references to it.  My recollection is that it isn't
defined either way (i.e. low level or "high" level, for want of a
better term).

&gt; which I have never heard of as meaning anything other
&gt; than a low-level format.

Yet I have.  I once spoke to (from memory) a Maxtor engineer when
trying to resolve an issue who stated that it wasn't a low level
format, hence the need to supply the bad block list (which had
been determined during an in factory format process).  This,
however, was 10+ years ago, and I'm willing to conceed that he
may have been feeding me bull or that times have changed.  This,
however, maps to my current line of thinking regarding hard disk
media in general, and goes back to your earlier statement regarding
IDE's not able to be low level formatted: that most drives are
factory formatted, and the format command (for either SCSI or IDE)
only reinitialises the sectors back to a known value.  Another
factor would be my presumption that between the drive controller
and the physical mechanism, the electronics would be similar whether
it was SCSI or IDE - if the reasons for non-formatting were electrical
(as opposed to microcode), then it would prevent low level formatting
for both (as stated, it's a presumption, and it is going out on a limb;
I've never had the opportunity to look at the electricals on a comparable
IDE/SCSI drive from the same manufacturer).  It's a pity that Seagate
don't have the equivalent of
<A HREF="http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/low_level_ata.html">http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/low_level_ata.html</A> for SCSI.

&gt; The command is optional;

Is it?  I thought it was mandatory for devices that used formattable
media (disks, tape drives, not (scanners or cdroms)).  Certainly,
for want of better specifications, 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/SCSI-Programming-HOWTO-23.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/SCSI-Programming-HOWTO-23.html</A>
lists it mandatory for direct access devices.

&gt; Even assuming it doesn't, which
&gt; I'm prepared to do, finding an example, or even a lot more, is not the
&gt; same as, "Most drives don't support the concept of a "low level format"
&gt; these days"

Perhaps not, but it does put the kibosh on your "Wrong.  Completely wrong."

&gt; Simple, Daryl, in fact obvious in hindsight: The SCSI controller is
&gt; intelligent, and it remaps block oriented commands, reserving one or
&gt; more blocks for it's own private use.

I missed the "hardware RAID controller" part in the original message
(bugger, I admitted a mistake - best not let that happen again).

  Daryl Tester
