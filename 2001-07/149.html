I don't mean to be the devils advocate here, however, I have been on this
mailling list for on 2 years I would think now (on and off).
I seem to have re-subscribed in the middle of a huge flame war where people
dont like HTML/newbies on "the linuxsa" mail list.
Which on a side note, seems to happen atleast once every 3 months.

Dare I say it, What makes us (me included) better than the newbies out
there who don't know how to use "elm" or "pine" for example
and post HTML based email? Or the user who asks how to login as root? No
offence, I understand that there is a wealth of knowledge
out there, we have SAMBA programmers, Im sure there are kernel hackers and
who knows what else.

The whole idea behind "OpenSource" software is the joint sharing of
knowledge. Seperate this list into four or even two, what will you get?
You will have a list of people who need help mailling one or two people who
have the time and desire to help. The thing I have noticed
is how many people are saying "ill cc both", "ill read both lists" etc etc.
Ill be blunt, thats crap. If you were happy to do that, you would
have just as much email as you do now, you wouldnt have to manually sort it
however but you would still have to deal with HTML email
and "newbie" posts therefore you might read it one month or so when you
feel with it.

I know there are a lot of people are out there who do help on this list. I
know that from first hand knowledge. But its the old story,
"out of sight, out of mind".

You break a community up into a "newbie" and a "geek" group. What do you
end up with, you end up with a few scenarios. People will
get sick of posting to the "newbies" list because no one replies and you
end up with the same problem we have now. People are
too scared to post to the "geek" list in the fear of being flammed to
death. People start posting to the "geek" list thinking they are "all
that".
What do you gain? Makes your life easier? Is that worth breaking up a
community?

I personally completely support this mailling list and organisation in its
current form. I believe its the best way of sharing knowledge,
sharing ideas and projects.

.....and yes, I have to manually sort every email every morning... Im happy
with that, because I'll actually read the email now and might
be able to help the user now, not in a month when I get board.

(if this ends up as a HTML email blame Lotus Notes and my employer, not me,
id use mutt)
