&gt; Richard's suggestion is a lame arse attempt at getting rid of someone who

Heh. Calm down, Stephen. We're not trying to make you go away. Contrary
to what you believe, we're actually here to help people and not to stuff
you around. I'm sorry you feel that way, but I cannot help that.

We're not victimising you because you've got a conflicting opinion to
us. We're simply telling you that treating "newbies" like shit doesn't
help anyone. It's gives Linux and UNIX user-groups a bad name.

&gt; I resent the fact that I'm being directed off the list because I expressed
&gt; an opinion. Who are you to tell me where to go? I don't know you.

Ah, an opinion. They're quite convenient words, don't you think? I'm
telling you to stop wasting everyone's time telling us about how this
list shouldn't have "newbies". I'm not interested in hearing that, 'coz
it's crap.

You're most welcome here (as far as I'm concerned), but don't expect to
be greeted with open arms every time you make a controversial comment.

&gt; You guys have voted for a more newbie friendly list. In great detail.
&gt; With many many messages. Tedious, overflowing, brain numbing excess
&gt; of messages. Day after day after day of beep after beep of new mail
&gt; cascading down my mailbox screen.

Look, I'm really sorry about the inconvenience, but it's a discussion
that (apparently) had to take place.

We've "voted for a more newbie friendly list" in the sense that we've
defined the "boundaries". It's not unreasonable. Even some of the more
established LinuxSA-ites are guilty of posting in unreadable,
unreplyable formats.

Defining what's acceptable and what's not isn't a bad thing, it's
actually a step in the right direction.

&gt; I have voted for this list remaining the same. With one message.

Great. I'm fairly happy with the list too, apart from the fact that
"newbies" don't really know what the generality deem acceptable.

Initiatives such as "How to get the best results from LinuxSA" are an
attempt at doing just that.

So, I suppose what you've said is right (in a way). We are making this
list a more friendly place for "newbies".

&gt; Everything since then has been knocking back the pressure to shut me up.

I'm going to stop tippy-toeing around the issue here and be blunt. I
don't think what you've stated in this thread has been at all helpful,
nor has it been constructive.

You've essentially said "No newbies, please". We're trying to encourage
people to use Linux, not discourage them. In fact, I was of the opinion
that doing so was one of the goals of LinuxSA.

If you're not interested in answering questions from "newbies", please
hit the delete key.

&gt; Or I can just say it in here and have some people think I'm an idiot.
&gt; I might have to shrug indifferently if it really hurt, but I'll live.

You're not an idiot. You've proven that (hey - you've even helped me at
some stage) you're not. A post such as this does seem a little, er, "out
of character".

&gt; Still, you had better back up that insult there. Tell me why I'm stupid.
&gt; Demonstrate the logic that makes you so sure of your world view that you
&gt; can freely call someone else 'stupid'.

I'm not backing up on anything. I'll stand by that statement and I'll
say it again. Your antics in telling us that the list should be
essentially a "techies"-only list is stupid. That's my opinion, however.
(Can you see just how convenient that word is? :-)

&gt; Make a new list and I'll join you there if you're so anxious to make new
&gt; lists for inappropriate reasons like "does not agree with me".

Heh. I'm not shunting you off anywhere. I'm simply telling you (in
fairly clear terms) that I'm not interested in hearing your suggestions
of a "newbie"-free list. If you've got something constructive to say or
a question to ask, I'll read it and quite possibly reply.

&gt; Mark may have a different opinion in this context. This isn't really about
&gt; newbies anymore. That was one message. This is about RR and you thinking
&gt; you have editoral rights on my free speech.

Who am I to suggest what Mark thinks? I simply quoted a passage from one
of his previous posts to illustrate what I thought was as clear as day. 

Your suggestion was rather extreme, to say the least. I'll stand by my
feelings that the suggestion was in no way helpful, constructive or
otherwise useful to me, Richard Russell or anyone else on this list.

&gt; Let Mark speak for himself, and start speaking for yourselves.

I didn't say "Mark would have said this, so you get back in your box", I
used his words as a way of saying "Use your brains, Pal". If you cannot,
honest-to-god understand that, I'm not sure that I'm going to bother
continuing the thread.

&gt; Nope. I have no idea why you think I'm wrong when I say that viewing
&gt; Linux from the business perspective is inaccurate. I have no inkling
&gt; as to how you could think that marketing Linux to Grannies is the
&gt; appropriate thing to do.

You implied much more than "Linux isn't for Grannies" in your original
post. I'm sure that marketing Linux directly to "Grannies" isn't the
best thing to do from a business perspective. However, I'm completely
certain that marketing Linux to the uninitiated is the "way of the
future". I've said it many times before that Linux -is- a real
alternative for the desktop. That's generally where "newbies" like to
hibernate.


&gt; It's a complete waste of space to say "I disagree" without saying why.

I was hoping that you'd have the nouse to work that out for yourself.
Seeing as you're a bright kind of person, I'll refrain from explaining
as I think you -DO- know what I meant.

&gt; You may as well click a little button on a web site poll since we'd
&gt; be able to collect thousands and thousands of your irrelevant little
&gt; opinions with just a couple of numbers.

I'm having trouble understanding the "hard" part about understanding
-my- reply. Quite clearly, I was saying "No, you're wrong. Newbies do
have a place on this list.". Stop suggesting stupid time-wasting
nonsense such as a web poll. Seriously, that's just a complete waste of
time.

&gt; Try following Christopher Yeoh's example - he posted a good response
&gt; and I agreed with his observations.

Chris Yeoh's example didn't really talk too much about "newbies" and
their place in LinuxSA. You've said that "We don't want newbies", and
twisted a bit of Linux-in-business/Linux marketting strategies in with
it.

Linux can work in business. It can work in large enterprises. It can
work in schools, homes and Internet Cafè's too. People who are new to
Linux will inevitably need some support. That's what this list is for
(amongst other things).
