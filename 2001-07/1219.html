Hmmm...

&gt; &gt;Granted, but most people can use windows and it's a bit easier to talk
&gt; &gt;people through it than with linux.

Windows 98, as someone else pointed out, isn't the right operating
system for the job. You should know that already.

&gt; That depends.  Even with joe average computer users I still find it easier
&gt; to talk them through doing stuff at a dos prompt than point & click.
&gt; (I've worked in Windows desktop support environments for the last 4 yrs)
&gt; With any phone support, depending on the problem of course, it depends
&gt; more on the skills of the support person, not the client. (of course there
&gt; are some exceptions :o)

Agreed. Attempting to describe a GUI can be toturous especially if it's
X and they're using a fantastically configurable Window Manager like
Sawfish (generally users leave the settings alone but I've seen some
systems and bombed myself out when the middle mouse button did something
totally unexpected).

&gt; Any remote admin for a Linux/BSD box isnt going to cost them a red cent, so
&gt; cost for remote admin isn't an issue.

Incidentally, I should quietly say that posting a Windows ONLY question
on the LINUXsa (note: I have deliberately reversed the usual
capitalisation because somebody obviously didn't see the LINUX in this
group's name before) probably reflects on the original poster more than
this list.

I could be uncharitable and state how I think it reflects on the poster
but I don't like to create flame wars. Really...

&gt; &gt;What I am trying to do here is give the customer what they want for the
&gt; &gt;smallest outlay possible as they are a community service and don't have a
&gt; &gt;lot of money to spend.
&gt; 
&gt; More reason to use an opensource solution.  There's 2 other alternatives,
&gt; they could buy a bigger box put W2K server on it, or buy a "plug n play"
&gt; VPN box for each network, both alternatives won't be cheap.

Umm, forgive me for asking, but wouldn't a monitorless ancient 266 MHZ
Pentium, or a new 500MHZ K6-II (which wouldn't cost that much money in
my opinion) run a Linux based VPN?
