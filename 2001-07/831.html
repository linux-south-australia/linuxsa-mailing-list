It seems that you are mostly interested in protecting yourself against DoS
and DDoS attacks.  Good luck.  If someone wants to bring down your 100mbit
connection, they will.  'kiddies' have huge 'packet nets' - mini-networks
of compromised boxes that can generate tremendous amounts of packets.
Recently the IRC network EFNet was attacked

from <A HREF="http://www.efnet.org/news.html?p">http://www.efnet.org/news.html?p</A>=10&n=20
irc.solidstreaming.net has been hit with a 3+ gig/sec DDoS attack
throughout the last couple of days. Due to this the servers open I:Line
&lt;snip&gt;

Can your single firewall's firewall and 100mbit connection handle a 3gig
per second DDoS?  Not many things can - solidstreaming.net ended up null
routing its servers.

Steve Gibson of GRC has a story about his DDoS experiences

&gt; That's how you rebutt the claim that forged source addresses could deny
&gt; you access to third parties is it?  "No sense argueing [sic]" and "not
&gt; willing to help."  Chucky, you have to understand that when people think
&gt; about your idea, and say, "hey, what about this?" they are trying to help.
&gt; You can lead a Norse to water but you can't make him sink.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck, and better not let anybody know which sites are "protected"
&gt; using your idea; there are only a few root DNS server addresses to spoof
&gt; before your sites DOS themself off the net.
&gt;
&gt; Do you get it yet?
