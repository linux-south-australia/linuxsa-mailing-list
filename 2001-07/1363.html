In case you have been holidaying on Planet Zed this month:

 - SirCam is yet another Outlook / Outlook Express virus which
repeatedly auto-mails itself to every address it can find. Along with
a file randomly selected from the victim's computer.

 - Code Red targets a known NT4/Win2000 Internet Information Server
hole to take total control of the target machine. It then spawns 100
instances of itself to scan "random" IP addresses for more victims;
and does a few other things too. The original Code Red generated the
same "random" list every time. There seems to be a variant which is
nastier.


And now to their effects:

So far my Procmail mangler has intercepted over 1,000 SirCam-generated
mails totalling 340MB from over 300 different addresses. Undoubtedly
there was some good blackmail material in that lot; but I'm now
running a cronjob to stop my mail filling its partition.

Unfortunately, the IP of _my_ webserver is on the original Code Red's
list; so Apache dutifully adds about 500 bytes to its error log every
time it gets probed. I estimate that my Apache wasted about two thirds
of its process time dealing with Code Red connections last week. I'm
sorely tempted to run another cronjob which adds those IPs to the
firewall.


Between them these two viruses are using a significant fraction of my
bandwidth (no ADSL out here...). I've come to the depressing
conclusion that they will cost me a bundle in data charges (and disk
space, CPU time, etc) as well as having a noticeable DoS effect;
because the actual transmission of this crap to my end cannot be
prevented.

Any thoughts on solving this dilemma? Apart from disconnecting my
server from the Net?


cheers,
Fraser Farrell

ps - another 7 SirCam messages have arrived while I typed this!
Grrr....
