Richard,

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; On the box in question, I had ipchained it so that external 
&gt; IP addresses couldn't connect to squid at all. I could nmap 
&gt; it from a remote host, and would find that 8080 was closed. 
&gt; However, when my friend nmapped, he got 8080 open, and could 
&gt; seemingly get anywhere using that proxy...
&gt; 
&gt; We messed about with this for a while, and came to the 
&gt; conclusion that there must be a transparent proxy, capturing 
&gt; port 8080 for him, and he was actually interacting with that 
&gt; proxy, and not mine... To be honest, I'm not 100% sure that 
&gt; this is the case, but I have no better explanation...
&gt; 
&gt; Could anyone shed some more light on this, or perhaps confirm 
&gt; that this certainly could be happenning?
&lt;snip&gt;

I have this problem with nmap all the time. I occurs when my ISP
has WWW traffic (port 80) redirected automagically through their
proxy/cache engines (can you say WCCP on Cisco ? :-P ). In this
particular case you probably have an ISP that has been a little
clever and made sure that they have covered all of the bases for
possible WWW traffic (port 80, 3128 & 8080).

Has your box got a Web server running and available (ie not hidden
by ipchains ?) If not try the same test "telnet &lt;host ip&gt; 80".
If you end up with the same result you can be reasonably sure
that it's just a cache redirection that is causing false positives
for nmap.

Cheers

Matt.....
