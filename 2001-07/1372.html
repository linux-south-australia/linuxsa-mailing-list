&gt;&gt; Right now I'm getting a very nasty hacker attack from this address:
&gt;&gt; resentment.trinity.sa.edu.au (203.87.98.27)
&gt;&gt; Does anyone on this mailing list happen to know anything about this?
&gt;
&gt; Do you ever get the feeling that people don't like you, Mr Kennington?
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps one of our users couldn't wait for another gut-busting installment of
&gt; "The Gospel According to Alan", and so launched an overt 'attack' in the hope
&gt; that you might post to the list yet again?
&gt;
&gt; You are a recognised computer security expert.  As such, I am surprised that you
&gt; posted this 'attack' to the list without first bothering to check with the
&gt; people responsible for the domain.  We might well have been in the middle of our
&gt; own investigation.  Your post to a public list might have sent this 'very nasty
&gt; hacker' on the run.  This is not the case, but may well have been.
&gt;
&gt; The logfile you posted to this list appears to be nothing more than a port-scan
&gt; of a single machine of yours.  On its own it means absolutely nothing.  It
&gt; should be noted that port-scanning is NOT a crime.  It should also be noted that
&gt; without the logs from EVERY router betwixt trinity.sa.edu.au and topology.org,
&gt; you have no way of knowing that the 'attack' did infact come from Trinity
&gt; College.
&gt;
&gt; The words 'Alan Kennington' and 'fuckwit' are quite often used in the same
&gt; sentence by members of the IT department here.

Well, since you're from the assumed originating site, the name of the
machine seems to imply some hostility, and you've described a motive,
how about some more investigation?  I don't think your message serves
any useful purpose.
