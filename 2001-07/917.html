&gt; I know it can be done, and be done better than using the syncookies.

But you haven't actually stated what _your_ problem with SYN cookies is,
except to point to a web page that mentions nothing about SYN
cookies and instead appears to be more of a bake off between two
firewall products (mmmm, cookie bakeoff).  I know one problem with
it straight off the bat - it's more computationally expensive to calculate
the hash, so you need some CPU grunt behind it.  Another (although my
knowledge here is out of date) is that the atypical kernel doesn't support
a combination of cookies and NAT, but there is a set of patches to
support this.  But you've not mentioned as to what you perceive the
problems to be, except to say it's a non-solution, when it's designed
particularly for the problem that you're trying to solve.

&gt; However,  I
&gt; am sure that there are some experts out there that are more than willing to
&gt; not just criticize an idea but contribute possible solutions as well.

I raised problems that I saw with your idea, as well as contributed a
known solution thought up by a brain much wider than mine, and I
suspect yours as well.  As David Newall point out, we are trying to
help by considering other angles, which you possibly may have already
solved without stating it in your original email.  "OK, no sense argueing
this with you guys" is not contributing possible solutions either.  This is
not about one-upmanship or ego, yet I suspect that you think it is.
