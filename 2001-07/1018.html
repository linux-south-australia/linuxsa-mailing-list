Craig, 
	it is most certainly NOT illegal to sell a PC without an OS.
That's how I got my shiny new Linux system. Most dealers will do 
this for you, (after a bit of a grumble) but from what I know Gateway
cannot legally sell PC's without an OS because of some deal they have
signed 
with Microsoft. It's all part of the same deal that allowed Gateway to
have copies of Win ME before the actual release date of the software.

If you want a PC without an OS you will have to go somewhere else.
When buying a PC tell the assistant that you will go elsewhere if you 
have to buy the PC with an OS on it and see if they change their mind.
They may give you some crap about 'Oh we cant do that because we have to 
install an OS to test it and then it would be illegal!' but don't let
that
bother you.

When I went shopping for my $2600 system the sales guy decided that
'We don't deal with AMD' should suddenly change to 'we COULD get an AMD
if you really want it' when I headed straight for the door after being 
told it was Intel or nothing cause AMD processors were 'An inferior
technology'. 

Trust me it works.

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Slightly off topic, but I was just chatting to a Gateway sales droid
&gt; about buying a laptop without an OS or that Works garbage on it.(to
&gt; put linux on it of course)
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing said was about a bunding contract with microsoft, at
&gt; which I grumbled. So he then mumbled something about it being *illegal*
&gt; to sell a computer without an operating system! Then I got a story
&gt; about him knowing someone (a friend?) who got done for it inadvertently.
&gt; The urban legend bells started ringing then.
&gt; 
&gt; Does any of this ring true in the real world? Are naked PCs really
&gt; illegal? Or are they just trying to cover their arses w/o looking too
&gt; bad.
&gt; 
&gt; Not that I've looked, but I'm sure the EULAs have changed since the
&gt; episode with Geoffrey.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Craig
