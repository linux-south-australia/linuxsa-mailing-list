Brian!

&gt; &gt; I wish that was the case
&gt; 
&gt; It IS the case!

It depends. I make a reasonable living out of Linux/PHP and other
non-specifically Microsoft based tools and products. Nonetheless I'm yet
to find a Linux System that can outdo Microsoft Word, a GUI DBMS that is
as easy to use as Access or Paradox or an open source browser that is as
good as Internet Explorer.

Before everyone jumps up and down at me, Mozilla is far too slow and
trying to get Java running with it is like playing russian roulette.
Opera is nice but Java doesn't work (and yes, I want Java
functionality). Netscape 4.7X series tends to be buggy and its
synchronous DNS is woeful and can actually kill ALL open Netscape
sessions. And its rendering is !@#$ed.

Incidentally, Gecko under Mozilla renders reasonably nicely but Mozilla
wouldn't know what a nice font looks like if you programmed it to use
one and Gecko is just so SLOW :-(

&gt; I know SO is demanding of resources - so don't use it if it wants more
&gt; room than you can spare.

With 1.2Gb I don't think disk space is the issue. But speed will be.

&gt; So you accept the standard of the LOWEST common denominator (because it
&gt; is common?).  Sorry, I don't understand the logic.

We accept what the majority thinks. I wish that would apply to paying
taxes...

&gt; &gt; We are trying to help the community gain computer skills.
&gt; 
&gt; Then give them the richest experience you can, not the most
&gt; impoverished.

Teach them something they can work in. Not everyone ends up using a
computer as a word processor etc. There's a good many people who work
administering them, setting them up and so forth. And people will pay
you to setup and support open source software.

&gt; reads/writes .xls files.  Netscape will read HTML mail if that is what
&gt; you want.  Graphics editors are .....   but you aren't listening, are
&gt; you?

Netscape only sort of reads HTML e-mail as I've pointed out in the past.

&gt; &gt; Please tell me if you know of something that can do all that Star
&gt; &gt; Office does for only the cost of a CD and I will check it out.

PEN, PAPER AND IMAGINATION

&gt; For goodness sake!  Have you not used Linux since RedHat 5.2 or earlier?
&gt; Like many others I use the Gnome GUI/Redhat 6.2.  I can't think of
&gt; anything simpler to operate.  Double-click on a .wav file in the File
&gt; manager and the music plays!  Insert a CD and it either commences
&gt; playing (audio) or a file manager is automatically invoked to show
&gt; you the CD contents (data).  Can you think of anything less daunting?
