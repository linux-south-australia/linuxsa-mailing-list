Hi Adam,

&lt;&lt;Yes this is a problem with the whole UAI/TER system. I could not know 
a thing about computers and get into computer science, pass the courses 
and still know nothing about how to put a PC together and yada yada.&gt;&gt;

Same with the MCP.

/SOAPBOX MODE ON/

I can speak with painful experience. Recently several nerds with very 
little experience, one had only used Windows 3.11 until he started the 
course, passed the MCP with flying colours. I mean 800+ and one even 
winged a 980 out 1000 for his effort. The exam they did was 70-215 
Administration of 2000 Servers. 

Anybody can learn how to answer questions. To actually do the work 
requires knowledge, not only skill in passing exams.


As for the work on Help Desk at Optus etc. If you only knew just how 
many of them do not know much at all about computers but they have the 
right attitude which means they can piss off the customer and get the 
next call answered while the honest staff are still helping out the 
customer solve their problem. The management do not want the customers 
to be helped, they just need them answered and then off the line so the 
next can be answered.

Ok, apologise for the good ones out there, I do appreciate your job is 
awful. It is the rude people that staff desks without any intention of 
providing help that really get my hackles rising.

Customer Service to a number of companies simply means answering their 
calls, it doesn't mean that you actually have to help them.
