Andrew!

&gt; There is a reason why one could consider Postfix more secure than
&gt; Sendmail. Firstly, the default configuration for Postfix is pretty
&gt; secure. It doesn't need blood, sweat and tears to get it going, which is
&gt; more than what can be said for Sendmail.

Admittedly you might need to consult the documentation to setup
Sendmail.

&gt; Secondly, configuring Postfix is considerably easier for the newcommer.

A few minor adjustments in the actual m4 configuration file is all it
takes. RedHat's default SendMail configuration is, in my opinion, quite
secure and the few parts where it is not, it is clearly documented.

(it's difficult to misunderstand a comment that goes "We recommend you
disable this feature...")

&gt; I'm not going to get into a "Which is the best MTA" debate. I think my
&gt; opinion (and reasons to support that opinion) have been quite clearly
&gt; canvased here.

Personally, in a production envrionment I wouldn't let a "new"
administrator adminster any e-mail system until he/she could prove
they'd understood the documentation and what he/she was doing [or there
was a total emergency and he/she were the only one around].

I'm still at a loss to understand why fiddling with a few m4 macros,
which are quite well documented at <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/,">http://www.sendmail.org/,</A> in the
source and in books is so difficult for some peole.

(ps: isn't it spelled "d'oh"?)
