&gt; (yeah, great) all components are on board (all or nothing style) I could

the implication here is that on board is bad... While this has been true in
the past, as on-board has been a means of reducing cost by bundling second
rate peripherals, it's changing fast... If your board is high-end, and comes
with brand-name onboard chips for LAN, IDE (what board these days
doesn't? -- that used to be uncommon), Audio, Video and so on, then it can
be a good thing. It depends on your demands and the particular architecture
it's done with. Certainly in the near future, there will be the nVidia
nForce chipset, which will have integrated high quality (GeForce2MX level, I
beleive) graphics, complete with pretty much the highest memory bandwidth in
the market, soem top notch sound, and so on...

My reading of the current state of technology is:

Cheap-arse: on-board everything.
mid-range: on-board LAN, Sound (if basic AC97 type sound is ok), Modem
(AMR), IDE (obviously)... AGP graphics and maybe PCI sound. This is quickly
changing, and soon you will be choosing onboard graphics and probably
sound...
high-end: PCI/AGP everything but IDE. More often though, SCSI and IDE RAID
are going onboard, as are Modem and Basic sound. Give it another year or so,
and you will be pining for the latest nVidia chipset with integrated
graphics to get the most performance...

Theoretically, it's possible to get higher performance from onboard
components, particularly on-chip ones, as there can be faster communication
buses... you'll also start to see the traditional northbridge and
southbridge chips being replaced by a single package...

A bit of speculation, but there are some good articles on some hardware type
sites to back up my theories.
