&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;true, you can choose a 3 month contract though even with the higher
&gt; &gt;install fee (by the time you include and ORHH install and buying
&gt; &gt;a NetJet card it's about the same as the ORHH startup costs).
&gt; &gt;I agree no contract at all is better but it's a relatively minor
&gt; &gt;point.
&gt; 
&gt; For the sake of accuracy, I would like to point out that some ADSL 
&gt; providers don't insist on a 'soul destroying' (or any other form of 
&gt; long term) contract.

I know (internode being one surprise surprise!) but I'm sorry to
say everyone else is significantly more expensive than telstra
(I know it's telstra's wholesale pricing etc to blame but that
doesn't change the facts)
 
&gt; &gt;I wish ORHH was a better deal than adsl but no matter how I look at
&gt; &gt;it I keep coming to the conclusion that adsl is the better deal.
&gt; 
&gt; That isn't necessarily the case; The answer  depends on your own 
&gt; personal combination of answers to the following questions:
&gt; 
&gt; - What speed is 'fast enough' for you? (i.e. of 64k or 128k is fast 
&gt; enough, ORHH is probably cheaper, if you want to go faster, ORHH 
&gt; can't get you there)

128k is probably fast enough, 64k I'm not so sure about.
But... if I want ORHH at 128k that means I need another PSTN
line for voice calls which adds roughly another $20pm to the
cost of the ORHH option - making adsl even more attractive.
(since my original comparison assumed 64k ORHH)
 
&gt; - How many megs per month do you expect to download? (very small 
&gt; amounts can often be included in some form of 'deal' by your ISP, 
&gt; very large amounts attract volume discounts. In the middle, the cost 
&gt; tends to be a bit higher)

and that's the problem.  I doubt we can stick to under 1Gb per
month (especially if the service is faster than 56k modem and
we want to try out streaming audio/video etc - all the stuff
broadband is supposed to be for).

Basically I want to be able to run napster a bit, grab a linux
iso image etc if I want to and "normal" browsing.  I can live with 
the fact that the month I get an iso we might have to limit other 
stuff but I want it to be possible (without paying 20 odd c per Mb 
for the rest of the image over 160Mb for example) if I so desire.

Dave.
