&gt; You just have to be aware when you buy, the problem is not with "crappy
&gt; Leader PC's", but the price point you are buying at. 
&gt; 
&gt; That Leader machine starts at what? - is it $800 or $900 dollars?, and you
&gt; are seriously comparing it to a mass produced, factory assembled Compaq? I
&gt; don't think we are being entirely fair here. There are benefits both ways.
&gt; In my opinion, the best of both worlds is to specify what you want in your
&gt; PC, and order the parts from Leader (or wherever) and build it yourself or
&gt; have them build it for you. Just dont expect to get a $2k Compaq for $1k. 

A low-end HP can be had for less than $1500. The thing is, giving
"Sleezy Joe's Computers" more money (for a more powerful machine)
doesn't increase the build quality, nor does it give you better
after-sales support. It just means you get faster, shinier components.

&gt; For the record, I wouldn't buy a Compaq desktop at any price - too much
&gt; non-standard gear in there like special memory chips that cost a bomb to
&gt; upgrade. If I were to be building a PC today, I'd be off to Toms' Hardware
&gt; guide and be choosing up an Asus/Abit mobo with quality accessories for
&gt; the same price or less as the Compaq and better servicable quality in my
&gt; hands. Ive built many of these over the last decade and most of them run
&gt; linux ( a couple of MS boxes snuck in, sorry), and none of them have
&gt; failed - I think I have had warranty on one HD and a power supply.

Really? I've got to say that the new Compaq Workstations are truley
gorgeous. They take the standard SDRAM, as well as having a supported
SCSI controller, video card and sound. I'd buy one tomorrow if they
weren't so damn expensive (Actually, I'd save and buy an Ultra 10).

&gt; Whilst Compaq will probably be still in business tomorrow, I doubt that
&gt; LG, Asus, AMD, Hitachi and Seagate are any different - these are large and
&gt; successful businesses, and they'll be here tomorrow too, tragedies
&gt; notwithstanding.

One thing that's always got me about LG in particular is their inability
to produce enough of their monitors. For example, we purchased about 50
17" LG Flatron monitors, but when some died, we could not get them fixed
for several months as no one had the parts.

The example I gave of my experience with HP is the difference.
