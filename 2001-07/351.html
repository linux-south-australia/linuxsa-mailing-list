{and sharing it from the DSLAM to the Shasta unit as well}

The trouble is that Telstra are routinely failing to meet even their 
contractually committed targets on ADSL, let alone reaching a higher 
standard than that.

So the answer is that it isn't possible to predict the medium term 
reliability of Telstra-wholesaled ADSL in this country at this time. 
Current indications I have are that it might get worse before it gets 
better.

Having said all of that, the practical outcome for real humans is 
pretty smooth with ADSL, the issue is just the one you're indicating 
- whether to bet your business on it.

My suggested compromise to consider is to get the best of both 
worlds. That can be done in a few ways:

- put your business critical Internet servers into a co-location 
facility with a good ISP, and use ADSL to connect to the Internet for 
your own office requirements only; That means that if the ADSL is 
down, your online business is not (and your performance to the 
Internet for your own servers, i.e. the performance your own 
customers will see, becomes stellar)

or

- talk to an ISP about the potential to have ISDN as a backup path 
along with ADSL as a primary path.
[ISDN can be set up to dial out 'on-demand' if another link fails. It 
is not trivial, you should expect to pay someone to get it to work 
right, but it can be made to work right if you need it to, with the 
ISDN costing circa $50 per month for the socket rental plus timed 
local calls during any ADSL outages].

Simplest (Cisco) based hardware to do that trick with at your end 
would probably be a 2600 or 1700 series Cisco with an ADSL WIC and an 
ISDN WIC in the same unit (though it can be done with multiple boxes, 
at a higher consulting/head-scratching expense).

or

- use something else again - there are other offerings available from 
other carriers, depending on where your office is (especially if it 
is in the CBD), such as two megabit full duplex (and ten, and 100 and 
1000 megabit) services, with decent reliability and real SLA's.

Yes, they will cost a bit more than ADSL. Did you want 'good and 
fast', or 'cheap' ? :)

&gt;Anyone got any info on the relative availability of ISDN connections vs

&gt;business... Also, the lack of garanteed bandwidth could be an issue (as you
&gt;are sharing the connection from the Shasta to the ISP...)
