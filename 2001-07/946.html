Geez!

&gt; MICROSOFT CLOSES A WINDOW ON CHARITY

It stops people from acting illegally. Maybe we should rob the rich to
give to the poor. Perhaps that's legal too.

*remembers to become a bank robber in the next life*

&gt; Microsoft, the world's richest software company, has told a Geelong
&gt; charity group, PCs for kids, that it must stop distributing the second
&gt; hand computers it recycles and gives to poor children until it can
&gt; obtain licenses for the software they carry.

Does that software contain licences? What would we be saying if it read:

"Richard Stallman, founder of the GPL, wins successful lawsuit against
Microsoft for distributing GNU Emacs for Windows under the Microsoft
E.U.L.A".

We'd post that up and say hurrah! Wouldn't we?

&gt; PCs for Kids has admitted that what it does is a breach of copyright but
&gt; is upset that Microsoft refuses to recognise the financial impossibility
&gt; of its requirements.

Just because it's financially impossible to meet one's legal
requirements doesn't in any way waive them. If that were not the case, I
could gain credit and never pay it. Eventually bringing the whole credit
system into disrepute and removing that method of finance from the
general population. That, to my mind, is an absolutely absurd argument.

&gt; In a letter this week to Colin Bayes, the founder and president of PCs
&gt; for Kids, Vanessa Hutley, Microsoft's corporate attorney in Sydney, said
&gt; "You have acknowledged that your practices... of hard-loading the
&gt; software on to PCs is an infringement of Microsoft's copyright...
&gt; Microsoft must insist that you find some other source of software..."

So they should. It's tough. It's life. We expect people to follow the
[GPL|BSD LICENCE|PERL LICENCE|ARTISTIC LICENCE]. So we'll just suddenly
expect people to not follow the Microsoft EULA because it suits us.

a) That's stupid
b) That's dumb
c) It's idiotic
d) It's mentally retarded

I'm prepared to make a truce. Let me do "reductio ad absurdum". Let
Microsoft take ALL the GNU/Linux code and make it Microsoft Linux,
enhance it and add the "Windows 2000 Windows Manager, Control Panel and
File Manger etc etc) and release the new product (Microsoft Advanaced
Linux??) under the Microsoft EULA.

If we're allowed to pick on them because they enforce what some
[possibly stupid] people have signed an agreement with, then we may as
well forget about licences at all. They mean nothing.

Just because noone has taken the GPL to court (to my knowledge, or to
such a spectacular extent as this) does not imply that it shouldn't
exist.

&gt; "That would cost us up to $600 per machine.  We don't have that kind of
&gt; money," said Mr Bayes.  "I think this is a case of greed and
&gt; double-dipping.  These are old, secondhand machines, donated to us for
&gt; charitable purposes."

Bull.

If it were Stallman champiniong the GPL or the FreeBSD champoning the
BSD Licence then it would be a different story.

Now, maybe if these [people|imbeciles] had actually spoken to Microsoft
in the first place (which, by inference from the story they did NOT)
they may have gotten further. 

And yes, I can cite at least one case where Microsoft have thrown a
whole bundle of LICENCED software at a charitable organisation...
