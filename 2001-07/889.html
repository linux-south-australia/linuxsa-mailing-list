Hi Geoffrey and all,

I would like to say thankyou to you and the members for making Paul, 
Malcolm and myself welcome tonight and allowing me to spread the word 
about our project. 

The night was great and the help afterwards was really a good start to 
getting our Linux box working.


While I was talking about the initiatives of the City of Salisbury I 
forgot to say how any of the members can contact them for more info.

For the IT Scholarships - get the MCP qualification for $500 - contact 
Martha Adams at the City of Salisbury, 8406 8222. You or the person who 
is nominating need to live in and around Salisbury council area for 
this one. They are taking about 20 people for the course which starts 
sometime in August. Includes the Microsoft books (70-210 and 70-215) 
and TAFE level training plus one shot at the 2000 Server exam, 70-215, 
for the MCP accreditation.

For the Youth and IT project, it is still getting underway but expect 
the ad for the Project Coordinator in this (or next) Saturday's 'Tizer 
(good job if you have the coordination knowledge). The call for 
participants will be a couple of weeks after the Coordinator is on 
board. This project will add Trainer (level 1) qualifications to young 
people 25 and under who already have some good IT skills. Again the 
applicants should live in or close to the Salisbury council area. Keep 
in touch with me for more details. 


For any business thinking about providing a quote on the 5 or 6 PC 
systems that I mentioned contact Kevin Armstrong at the City of 
Salisbury, 8406 8222, and ask him about the criteria. Mention that you 
have been talking to me about it. 
Be quick to contact him and don't forget to give us a good price &lt;GGG&gt;


Cheers and again, thanks to all for the help,

 Ian Loxton,
 on behalf of the, 
 Salisbury North Neighbourhood Network
