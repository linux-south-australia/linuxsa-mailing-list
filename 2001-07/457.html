&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; For most SMEs, I'd say it'd just be easier (and cheaper) to drop a Linux
&gt; box in, instead of a Cisco. I'd not use the Cisco unless I had a reason
&gt; to. In the case of most SMEs, I can't see one.

Apart from the eg below, I can't see many either -- does anyone have any,
given a pretty standard SME setup with one upstream link
(modem/ADSL/ISDN/whatever) or perhaps even two of those (Linux could handle
this, and is programmable), and not a huge quantity of data to route --
upstream is say  &lt;&lt;&lt; 10Mbit, and _maybe_ you have a little bit of internal
routing to do also...

The advantages I see are:

1) uptime (I assume cisco are better here, but that's mainly due to the
nature of PC hardware)
2) support
3) speed (which wouldn't be an issue in this case)
4) security perhaps (I have seen more Linux compromises than Cisco, but that
could be because I spend more time with Linux)

Are there more? Are any of these of more value than I see?

Advantages of Linux:

1) flexibility (the box could be multifunction, and can do all sorts of
things, like account for data and provide a web page summarising costs)
2) price (gotta be cheaper, at least, when considering the extra
functionality)
3) could be simpler... I'm not experienced in Cisco personally so I really
don't know about this...
4) remote admin -- you can either ssh to it or you can't... how would you
get to a Cisco box remotely?

hmmm...

&gt; Simon provided a good example of where a small Cisco can be used (see
&gt; the thread "[OT] ISDN vs ADSL and Cisco vs Linux".
