I saw a star-wars-related mindstorms kit in a store window last weekend..
was only $90 or so i think.. whats the difference between that and a full
mindstorms kit?

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     It sounds to me that what you need is the O'Reilly book
&gt; on Linux and Lego Mindstorms. For the cost of a not very
&gt; cheap Mindstorms set and a book, you should have enough to
&gt; get started. There are also some very good books at Dick
&gt; Smith Electronics on Robots at the moment that include
&gt; software clips in Visual Basic which should point you in the
&gt; right direction, and then all you have to do is port them to
&gt; Linux. There are several HOWTOs available also on
&gt; Mindstorms, and Device Drivers that would come in handy. If
&gt; you are already into electronics, I know that there are
&gt; communication boards that plug into your PC that you build
&gt; as a kit that are aimed at just what you want and are also
&gt; available at DSE and other places. Pretty much it should
&gt; cost you about A$250 for a mindstorms kit, a com card kit,
&gt; and a couple of books, and then you should have everything
&gt; that you need. If you want to do it on the cheap, then I
&gt; would recommend a book from DSE and an old computer of some
&gt; description and some parts and away you go. Hope this helps.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
