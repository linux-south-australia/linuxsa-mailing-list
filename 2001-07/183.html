&gt; Nobody is saying that they are better than everyone else because they
&gt; don't post in HTML. They are saying "Don't post in HTML or I'm not going
&gt; to help you". That's not an unreasonable request at all.

Like MS says dont ask for help unless you have a credit card. Not
unreaosnable. all you ahve to do is comply iwtha request you may nto be
able to(in the ms case cos you dont have the card or the $100 per half
hour, in the linuxsa case, because you dont ahve the requisite knowledge).


&gt; 
&gt; Those of us who make up the "wealth of knowledge" don't have time for
&gt; messages that don't display, wrap or quote properly. Ask in plain-text
&gt; and you'll almost always get a response.

Unless it doenst wrap propoerly.

But speak for yourself.
I will answer any question I think I can, that I read.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The whole idea behind "OpenSource" software is the joint sharing of
&gt; &gt; knowledge. Seperate this list into four or even two, what will you get?
&gt; 
&gt; For a start, you're not going to have as many knowledgable people on
&gt; each list. The whole idea of a seperate list for "newbies" is obsurd.
&gt; Possibly a "LinuxSA-chat" mailing list would be of some benefit, but
&gt; even that I'd question.


So dont make it seprate.

Auto copy all stuff fromt eh newbie list ot eh amin list.

That wat y newbies ahve access to techinical knowldge, without having to
put up with the stiuff they dont want ot hear, or dont ahve time to hear.

&gt; Yup. That's the main issue. I just can't see there being an array of
&gt; "experts" with knowledge diverse enough to cater for the needs of the
&gt; "newbies". You're most likely to end up with a bunch of "newbies"
&gt; sitting all alone in the "LinuxSA-newbies" list with no support.

See above.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know there are a lot of people are out there who do help on this list. I
&gt; &gt; know that from first hand knowledge. But its the old story,
&gt; &gt; "out of sight, out of mind".
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think their is any attempt to push "newbies" away from LinuxSA,
&gt; I think it's the opposite. I just can't see the majority of the
&gt; knowledgable people being bothered subscribing to a "newbies" list.

Noa concsiou effort.

But if you ask a quesiton you might not get an attempt at an answer, but
if you do it in the wrong format you will almost certianly get a gruff
reply.

If the questionis considred to basic you will get a gruff reply.

We may not consiously push people away, but if you wnet into a shop and
said "to buy a fish I'd like to" and the saleman said. "I wont sell to you
until you can speak proper english", whould you buy from that shop?

If you asked the salesman "what sort of car has 4 wheel drive" and he said
"go read a car buyers guide" (ie rtfm) woudl you wnat to buy from him?

Would you return to those shops?

&gt; Um, no. "newbies" DO NOT get flamed to death here. Certain members of
&gt; the community have been misinturpreted and branded "flamers". The
&gt; majority of "newbies" on this list are helped and not flamed.

Hmmm... I dispute that.
Peopel do get flameds for merely asking simple questions, that they _dont
know_ how to find the answer for.
Let alone for posting html.

&gt; 
&gt; I think you've picked up the wrong end of the stick. The idea of a
&gt; seperate list (as pointless as it is) is not to prevent "newbies" from
&gt; bothering the "gurus". It's a concept designed to provide better help
&gt; for "newbies". Unfortunately, it wouldn't work.

Why?
Anything can work if we want to to work.
It will fail if people dont want it to succeded though.
