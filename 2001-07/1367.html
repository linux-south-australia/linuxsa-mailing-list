&gt; I wish that was the case but we are having all sorts of bother getting

If you want a machine for developement or server, then it might take some 
space, but you should easily get a basic desktop system up on a 1.2 gig drive 
with SO included. I've had quite usable systems running on 700-800 meg  Add 
200 meg for SO. I've skimmed a lot smaller than that as well, but these days 
with 20 gig drives I don't bother. 

Heck. ME takes a huge chunk of drive these days for a basic intall - and yet 
it does nothing. No real apps or anything.

&gt; While it would be nice to think that Linux is the standard out there it
&gt; isn't and isn't going to be for some time. The community standard is
&gt; Microsoft and so putting a machine out into the community requires it
&gt; to be either Microsoft or as close as we can so that Microsoft files
&gt; can still be used on it.

Not sure the average person needs to be standard? I don't. I just type up 
stuff and print it. Use spreadsheets, etc. If someone sends docs, most load 
up with abiword or gnumeric or SO

&gt; We are trying to help the community gain computer skills. There isn't
&gt; any point in selling people a system that is not compatible with the
&gt; majority of other computers out there.

I still don't see why you need a 'standard' to teach computer skills. I sit 
people in front of linux boxes and they click away same as a win box. They 
can get on the net, do email, write stuff, and the important things. Much of 
the rest is crap and if they want fancy then maybe they want to spend lots of 
money. Linux does the basics well and cheap and reliably. 

Compatibility is great for games. I have MS boxes here - and I'm practically 
legal. But I don't trust important stuff on the MS OS's. The real stuff is 
all done nice and safe in linux. So providing linux rather than MS is doing 
people a favour. If they don't realize that, the TS...

&gt; Star Office is the key to providing a level of compatibility. Without
&gt; running Star Office we don't have compatibility with the MS files and
&gt; that means we don't have Linux as an alternative.

Run SO... I'll have to try, but should be able to get SO on a 1.2 system. 
Does need a decent system to run tho... By the same token, you ain't going to 
get Office on these systems either if it's that tight...

And hey, there's a point. Your talking about OS licenses, but what about 
Office licenses. Are you talking about using Office or SO on the win boxes. 
If your talking MS Office then your talking big bucks, and if your talking SO 
on win then you have the same compatibility probs  - and there are other 
free, non-compatible office-apps for win. 

To set up a win box with MS software etcto the same sort of standard as a 
linux box would cost quite a bit, I'd think.
