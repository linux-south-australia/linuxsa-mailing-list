Hi Brian,

&lt;&lt;
WHY are you bothering with M$?  Linux or FreeBSD will do
all that WinDOZE will do, and much much more - FREE!
&gt;&gt;

I wish that was the case but we are having all sorts of bother getting 
enough of a system on the 1.2 Gig drive and still have enough room to 
run Star Office.

While it would be nice to think that Linux is the standard out there it 
isn't and isn't going to be for some time. The community standard is 
Microsoft and so putting a machine out into the community requires it 
to be either Microsoft or as close as we can so that Microsoft files 
can still be used on it. 

We are trying to help the community gain computer skills. There isn't 
any point in selling people a system that is not compatible with the 
majority of other computers out there. 

Star Office is the key to providing a level of compatibility. Without 
running Star Office we don't have compatibility with the MS files and 
that means we don't have Linux as an alternative.

I don't know of any other alternative-Office product that is as closely 
compatible to the Microsoft Office Package and that comes with the 
support and features of Star Office for the cost of burning a CD. 

Please tell me if you know of something that can do all that Star 
Office does for only the cost of a CD and I will check it out.

Brian, I have been into computers since '68. I can tolerate the 
differences, the frustrations, the difficulties that come with a Linux 
system. I can learn and I can get much better using and tweaking the 
Linux system. This is fun to me and I am enjoying the challlenge.

The people that we provide these computers to are either newbies to 
computing or else still trying to understand about a file and a 
directory. Linux for them would have to be a stable system running as 
close to the Windows look and feel as we can get it simply so they can 
work on it from that point.

If you think that Linux is not an appropriate path for us to folllow 
with our requirments then please let me know dso I can start looking 
for other solutions to our problem.

Cheers,

Ian
