&gt; &gt; They run Netscape for their mail server, which is a PoS.
&gt; 
&gt; Nah, they run a custom variant of NTMail, which is an even
&gt; worse PoS (I still have the scars from that administration
&gt; experience), although they have announced that they're moving
&gt; to Netscape.  I frequently get authentication errors polling
&gt; their POP server, to which BP help desk have responded that
&gt; "you must be using a different password", despite the fact
&gt; that it's hardwired into a fetchmail config.  Mind you, these
&gt; are the same guys that tried to pass off their NT server as
&gt; "a supercomputer".

ROFL. I'm easily amused but I found your reply very funny. I've been on
the end of ridiculous telephone conversations with the BPA tech support
before. It's a bit insulting to ring up and ask if there is a problem with
the authentication server to be told to check your DNS settings.

Telstra seem to think (and many other ISPs) hiring a robot to search the
already available documentation and merely repeating that back to the user
is tech support!?

What happened to the days when a techie was just that, someone who knew at
least how to build a computer and have a mental repository of known
problems and fixes? Not to forget the hacker mentality, which is hard to
find these days. It seems anyone can get a degree in I.T. but it doesn't
mean they will be any good at it.
