OK, this has been answered well already by martin (re the port being open
according to nmap but not when actually connecting)... however, a friend and
I came across a similar situation that was somewhat weirder... read on...

&gt; cos I ran nmap to check what ports are open, it reported a

(note of course, that running `nmap localhost` is completely different to
running `nmap &lt;hostname&gt;`, as localhost refers to the lo (127.0.0.1)
interface, whereas &lt;hostname&gt; is (usually) your eth0. There's a number of
places that programs can be told to listen to one but not the other of these
ports -- one being ipchains (and friends)...)

&gt; pile of them, some are "protected" by tcp wrappers though
&gt; which it still lists as open but for squid (8080 - I prefer
&gt; that to 3128) I ssh'ed to an external host then telneted

(I always wondered why 3128 is the standard -- is that a pre-squid,
cache-standard thing?)

&gt; back in to port 8080 and did a GET.....blah.. and it
&gt; returned html.

OK, our situation was interesting...

On the box in question, I had ipchained it so that external IP addresses
couldn't connect to squid at all. I could nmap it from a remote host, and
would find that 8080 was closed. However, when my friend nmapped, he got
8080 open, and could seemingly get anywhere using that proxy...

We messed about with this for a while, and came to the conclusion that there
must be a transparent proxy, capturing port 8080 for him, and he was
actually interacting with that proxy, and not mine... To be honest, I'm not
100% sure that this is the case, but I have no better explanation...

Could anyone shed some more light on this, or perhaps confirm that this
certainly could be happenning?

Thanks
