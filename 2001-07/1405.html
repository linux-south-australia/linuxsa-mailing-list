&gt; Changing all routes that usually went on the SCC to an alternate route is
&gt; definately going to plug the alternate route. Yes your connection will
&gt; still be fine, but it definately won't be as fast and reliable as before.

As I said in my previous post, I'm not seeing any significant problems.
People still have web access, mail is still comming and going and I'm
yet to hear a complaint.

&gt; Then what happens when that pipe gets cut?

You'd want to hope the ISP has another link. I hope you realise that
ISPs that provide the level of service that you apparently want acutally
take what they do seriously, and as such, provision their network in
such a way that it can withstand problems such as upstream outages.

&gt; Possibly, but with a lower response time and available bandwidth.

While I'm not seeing any significant performance problems, remember that
half the country is probably on the same link as you. If you're seeing
slower ping times because of this, that's why. You've still got
conectivity, though. You're still sending and receiving that
oh-so-important email.

&gt; p.s. Thanks for the copy but just send your reply to the list.

No.
