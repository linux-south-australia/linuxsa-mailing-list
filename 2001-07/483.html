&gt; The brand-name PCs almost always come preconfigured
&gt; and ready to do,
&gt; with an emergency recovery CD for a rainy day. I've
&gt; not seen one
&gt; Adelaide shop that does this. If it breaks, you're
&gt; either on your own or
&gt; paying them $40/hour for assistance.

I guess this is one reason I started building PCs for
people... I knew too many people that had been bitten
by both shops _and_ brand names. I get 95% of my work
by word of mouth, which you dont get if you do a crap
job.

Also, I dont know how far you'd get without paying any
money, if you rang up Compaq or IBM or whatever 10
months down the track and it wasn't a warrantied dead
piece of hardware you wanted fixed...

To keep it relevant to Linux, if you installed Linux
ontoa Compaq I dont know how much help you would get
from them either if something broke...

A lot of it comes down to the level of experience of
the user, and their individual requirements, budget,
etc

&gt; When you're in an environment where a broken
&gt; workstation means lost
&gt; money, and your time is just too valuable, the
&gt; brand-name PCs are almost
&gt; guaranteed to be more reliable. Why do banks -only-
&gt; have Compaq, HP or
&gt; IBM machines at the teller's desk? Because they just
&gt; -cannot- have any
&gt; down time and they can depend on the brand name.

As I said, a lot of it comes down to the level of
experience of the user, and their individual
requirements, budget, etc. 

A bank absolutely needs no downtime. 
A home user _may_ just want to play games, or send
photos to grandma ;-), and can find other things to do
with the difference in price.

I was on a job where we had IBM servers, and a disk
interface failed, and we were in the middle of the
bush, and we still managed to get replacements inside
a couple of days, this was pretty impressive given our
environment, but then these beastys cost $10k+, so you
get what you pay for.

&gt; 
&gt; I've picked up 7-year old Compaq 486 boxes from an
&gt; Auction which still
&gt; run without hiccup. They're built well, reall well.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course, then you get some brand name PCs which
&gt; &gt; require "star" shaped screw drivers to open the
&gt; back
&gt; &gt; of the case, and others with hidden "secret
&gt; catches"
&gt; &gt; that require a degree in lateral thinking and the
&gt; &gt; ability to think of new uses for tools to get
&gt; open...
&gt; 
&gt; They can be a pain, but they've got a purpose. Apart
&gt; from the obvious
&gt; ("I can't open this darn thing... Time to pay
&gt; someone to do it"), it's
&gt; also to prevent "Sleezy Joe's Computers" from
&gt; "servicing" it. The hope

I'll take it that your "Sleazy Joes" is not tarring
all independant computer servicepeople with the same
brush...

&gt; is that the owner will send it back to the vendor
&gt; and have a qualified
&gt; technician look it over.

I guess this is the same prinicple with a lot of
smaller-scale electrical equipment, except they hope
you toss it & buy another one. I had a battery charger
from DSE fro about $35 that stopped working after
about 12 months. To pull it apart I needed a special
screw driver, one that was like a flathead with a bite
taken out of it. Turned out was just a couple of
dry-joints, saved myself another $35.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And of course they try and get you to buy brand
&gt; name
&gt; &gt; memory upgrades when you can purchase standard
&gt; SDRAM
&gt; &gt; from anywhere at half the price
&gt; 
&gt; That's just wrong. I found a laptop in the cupboard
&gt; the other day.
&gt; Asking compaq for the price of 64MB SODIM SDRAM left
&gt; me in shock. Of
&gt; course, generic stuff from Leader can be picked up
&gt; for a fraction of the
&gt; price.

Are you contradicting youself here? Or were you in
shock because the price was so low?

&lt;snipped&gt;

;-) Who is this "Leader" anyway ?
