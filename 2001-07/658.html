I hate to add to this horrendous series of threads, but I just found
(thanks to Geoff's latest Perl Journal) a very nice module called
Text::Autoformat. You can see the documentation at
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/doc/DCONWAY/Text-Autoformat-1.04/lib/Text/Autoformat.pm">http://search.cpan.org/doc/DCONWAY/Text-Autoformat-1.04/lib/Text/Autoformat.pm</A>

It does a very good job at reformatting paragraphs munged by bad quoting,
including rewrapping them, handling lists and bullet points in them, and
lots of other stuff.

I used it on the text quoted above, though I reduced the right margin to
make it obvious what it's doing:

At any rate, this is a partial solution for one of the problems that has
been done to death in recent days, at least for those that a) grok enough
perl to get it going, and b) can actually use perl on their OS without
jumping through too many hoops. Actually it's not that hard to get it
going, fairly minimalistic perl skills are needed.

No, LinuxSA is not likely to be automatically running Text::Autoformat
over incoming posts. Don't even ask. This is a personal solution for those
that want it. Anyone else can live with it.
