No, it's not true either.  I'm bothered by it.

On the FreeBSD lists we're thinking of blocking HTML mail, but the
alternative of filtering it is a good one.  There's another
disadvantage to HTML, as well:

LinuxSA WWW: <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/</A>  IRC: #linuxsa on irc.linux.org.au
To unsubscribe from the LinuxSA list:
  mail <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au</A> with "unsubscribe" as the subject

This comes after the &lt;/html&gt; tag on an HTML message, so HTML users
don't see it.  They're probably the ones who send unsubscribe messages
to the list.

&gt; I suggest a committee-based approabh to list filtering.

Ah, that's a good way to kill the discussion.

&gt; Emails to Linuxsa should be automatically forwarded to a select
&gt; group of individuals (mainly consisting of David Lloyds[1]), who
&gt; collectively vote through an automated system as to whether the mail
&gt; is ok or not. If more than half[2] of this group respond positively
&gt; within a reasonable time limit[3], then the mail message is entered
&gt; into a CVS repository.

Ah, you mean moderation.  That'll kill the list instead.

&gt; [4] of course, if the email was written by Jason Tan, it will have to be
&gt; sent through ispell with a custom dictionary (or should that be ditconiayr?)
&gt; to correct the typos (actually, perhaps a perl script that swaps every third
&gt; character would work...)

I'd like to see that spelling corrector.  I'm sure you could get
millions for the DWIM module.

&gt; [7] That is, those from David Lloyd or David Newall.

You've really got it in for David Lloyd today, don't you?  IIRC he was
hardly active on this thread.
