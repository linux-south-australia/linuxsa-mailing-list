&gt; &gt; &gt; My offer was one of processing a HTML email into one that was text
only,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so not rejecting the content of the message, and indicating that
this
&gt; &gt; &gt; had been done. The sender would also be sent a short polite note with
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; reference to a bigger list on a web site, and an appology for anyone
who
&gt; &gt; &gt; knew this already.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think I was thinking of something else :-)
&gt;
&gt; I wish I had explained it this clearly in the begining.

I think my point was why after all this time are people saying lets change
the whole structure of linuxsa to overcome this small problem...??

I mean different list and the like.. c'mon!!??!!

Dale had what I heard as the best solution right at the beginning...
the other points in regards to the instructions that could be sent using the
X-Mailer: tag to identify the mail client (after the mail had been
identified as html - andrew) were to be more in the spirit of a mailing list
and the linux 'community' which helps each other out and doesnt assume you
know it all already...
but Dale covered that too with links to a website with further details...

so I shall now retreat back to whence I came and let you guys nut out the
details as I am in way over my head already... :)
