&gt; &gt; MICROSOFT CLOSES A WINDOW ON CHARITY
&gt;
&gt; It stops people from acting illegally. Maybe we should rob the rich to
&gt; give to the poor. Perhaps that's legal too.

Worked for that Robin fellow, you know the English chap...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *remembers to become a bank robber in the next life*
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Microsoft, the world's richest software company, has told a Geelong
&gt; &gt; charity group, PCs for kids, that it must stop distributing the second
&gt; &gt; hand computers it recycles and gives to poor children until it can
&gt; &gt; obtain licenses for the software they carry.
&gt;
&gt; Does that software contain licences? What would we be saying if it read:
&gt;
&gt; "Richard Stallman, founder of the GPL, wins successful lawsuit against
&gt; Microsoft for distributing GNU Emacs for Windows under the Microsoft
&gt; E.U.L.A".

? ( I need more coffee)

&gt;
&gt; We'd post that up and say hurrah! Wouldn't we?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; PCs for Kids has admitted that what it does is a breach of copyright but
&gt; &gt; is upset that Microsoft refuses to recognise the financial impossibility
&gt; &gt; of its requirements.
&gt;
&gt; Just because it's financially impossible to meet one's legal
&gt; requirements doesn't in any way waive them. If that were not the case, I
&gt; could gain credit and never pay it. Eventually bringing the whole credit
&gt; system into disrepute and removing that method of finance from the
&gt; general population. That, to my mind, is an absolutely absurd argument.

I thought the credit system was doing a grand job brining itself into
disrepute :-)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; In a letter this week to Colin Bayes, the founder and president of PCs
&gt; &gt; for Kids, Vanessa Hutley, Microsoft's corporate attorney in Sydney, said
&gt; &gt; "You have acknowledged that your practices... of hard-loading the
&gt; &gt; software on to PCs is an infringement of Microsoft's copyright...
&gt; &gt; Microsoft must insist that you find some other source of software..."
&gt;
&gt; So they should. It's tough. It's life. We expect people to follow the
&gt; [GPL|BSD LICENCE|PERL LICENCE|ARTISTIC LICENCE]. So we'll just suddenly
&gt; expect people to not follow the Microsoft EULA because it suits us.

This one is really good, its so nice to see law abiding MS acting in a ROLE
model position for people, even though as a corporation they can treat the law
with contempt. In fact that one deserves a ROFL...
Read Judge Jackson words regarding MS...

&gt;
&gt; a) That's stupid
&gt; b) That's dumb
&gt; c) It's idiotic
&gt; d) It's mentally retarded

Ahh but only if you are an individual, emm consumer, emm money pit, emm a dumb
ass thinking ameba  If your a monopoly, it's

a) intelligent
b) smart
c) clever
d) Superior Intellect

&gt;
&gt; I'm prepared to make a truce. Let me do "reductio ad absurdum". Let
&gt; Microsoft take ALL the GNU/Linux code and make it Microsoft Linux,
&gt; enhance it and add the "Windows 2000 Windows Manager, Control Panel and
&gt; File Manger etc etc) and release the new product (Microsoft Advanaced
&gt; Linux??) under the Microsoft EULA.

we_dont_need_no_stinkingg_truce ;-)

&gt;
&gt; If we're allowed to pick on them because they enforce what some
&gt; [possibly stupid] people have signed an agreement with, then we may as
&gt; well forget about licences at all. They mean nothing.

Wow, did I mention superior intellect a few lines ago :-)

&gt;
&gt; Just because noone has taken the GPL to court (to my knowledge, or to
&gt; such a spectacular extent as this) does not imply that it shouldn't
&gt; exist.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; "That would cost us up to $600 per machine.  We don't have that kind of
&gt; &gt; money," said Mr Bayes.  "I think this is a case of greed and
&gt; &gt; double-dipping.  These are old, secondhand machines, donated to us for
&gt; &gt; charitable purposes."

&gt; Bull.

Scrooge, eat your heart out,  LinuxSA is proud to present our very own, yes
our very own , come on down DSL ;-)

&gt;
&gt; If it were Stallman champiniong the GPL or the FreeBSD champoning the
&gt; BSD Licence then it would be a different story.
&gt;
&gt; Now, maybe if these [people|imbeciles] had actually spoken to Microsoft
&gt; in the first place (which, by inference from the story they did NOT)
&gt; they may have gotten further.

Steve bows down to a Human-Demi-God who has actually managed to speak to a
biological being instead of an answering system.  (humbled beyond words) Did
they impart wisdom oh wise one?

&gt;
&gt; And yes, I can cite at least one case where Microsoft have thrown a
&gt; whole bundle of LICENCED software at a charitable organisation...

Geeza a miracle, come on Jesus, geeze one oh them yon miracle things, come on,
come on...

:-)
