Hello all,

A few questions...

Is any one running Linux on a laptop on this list?
I'm thinking of buying one, but being poor I'll be stuck with a choice of
generic model runing an AMD k6-2 450 MHz.
There isnt any issues with Linux running on AMD chips is there?
As far as my (limited) understanding goes, as long as it's an x86 it will
go, right???

Does anyone know of any computer shops in Adelaide offering Linux
pre-installed?
Or what about Linux friendly (or at least aware) computer shops.
My experience has been hearing how my zip drive, buzz card and cd burner
would never work with linux!
Then there's the "how is your computer going to turn off" senario with a
King William Street retailer.

Do we have many options for training / certification in Adelaide?
I'd like to do a RHCE course and maybe even get LPI or SAIR certification in
the future.
What are my options in Adelaide? So far I've been relying on the net,
HOWTO's manpages, luck etc.
But none of those things has offered me any certification d;-)

And finally, are there any people working on a local (Australian) version of
linux?

Thanks for your time everyone.

Jay
