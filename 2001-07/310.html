&gt; Well, as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery :-)

&gt; We've decided that this is probably a rather abrupt way of saying
&gt; things.  If I had the time, I'd rework this particular part of the
&gt; message.  Instead I have an Emacs macro which adds the text you see at
&gt; the top of this reply.

I had a think about it and ending up sitting there trying to think up a
way which would:

i  ) Address the issues that the current revision does.
ii ) Do that in the same if not less number of lines.

I'll have to admit that I found that rather difficult. Personally, I
don't think it's too much of an issue, esdpecially as the email
specifically mentions that it's being sent out automagically.

[ ... ]

&gt; Again, all the stuff between my last comment and this needs rework,
&gt; not just here but in the original.

Yeah? I suppose that's really a matter of personal opinion. I think that
it addresses the main issues in a clear, concise manner which is most
appropriate for an introcuction.

[ ... ]

&gt; This is really a history of FreeBSD-questions.  Are you sure it
&gt; applies to LinuxSA?  It could do, but it's not as pronounced as the
&gt; issues which prompted me to write this document.

I thought about that for a while, then decided to agree with you. It's
not really that bad at all on LinuxSA. The latest revision reflects this
decision.

[ ... ]

&gt; Well, no, I explain how to unsubscribe.  This sounds like a bug in my
&gt; document which you missed :-)

It appears to be so :-) The version on <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org">http://www.freebsd.org</A> also
sports this, er, feature :-)

[ ... ]

&gt; Note also that you'll have to handle the case of current members who
&gt; received no such message.  I've just checked, and I didn't get
&gt; anything.  This will require a bit of explanation.

Ammended in the latest revision. Note that the FIXME still exists, and
I'm open to suggesetions/recommendations to replace it with.

[ ... ]

&gt; I think it looks tidier to indent the way it is in my document (that's
&gt; why it's that way :-)

So (do|did) I when I typed it out. My beta-version MUA (Evolution)
managed to coax the indents from going out the wire :-)

[ ... ]

&gt; This is probably less the case for LinuxSA.  On FreeBSD-questions, I
&gt; frequently see people who really have difficulty with English, who
&gt; nevertheless try their best to make themselves understood.  I haven't
&gt; seen this particular problem on LinuxSA, though I'm sure we have a few
&gt; non-native English speakers.

While it is less the case for LinuxSA, I can't see any harm in including
it, even if it is only for the purpose of letting people know that we're
not completely unreasonable and are perfectly open to helping those with
less than perfect English skills.
&gt; &gt; but it is really painful to try and read a message written full of
&gt; &gt; typos or without line breaks.
&gt; 
&gt; We've got them :-)

I'm not going to mention names, but... [1] :-)

[ ... ]

&gt; Given that a number of people think of Linux as distinct from UNIX,
&gt; it's probably worth clarifying this issue.

This has been reflected in the latest revision of the document.

[ ... ]

&gt; Specifically, to set SA time, do:
&gt; 
&gt;  # cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Adelaide /etc/localtime

This has been included in the latest revision as a "Note" to Linux/BSD
users.

&gt; If there are any distros of Linux which don't handle exactly this
&gt; command, please let me know.  All versions of BSD (Free, Net, Open,
&gt; /OS) handle it that way as well.

Hrm, not sure. I daresay it'd be fairly standard amongst the major
distributions. If anyone can provide evidence to the contrary, I'm most
eager to hear of it so I can update the document to reflect it.

[ ... ]

&gt; &gt;  If you get error messages, don't say "I get error messages",
&gt; &gt;  say (for example), "I get the error message 'No route to
&gt; &gt;  host'".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  If your system panics, don't say "My system panicked", say
&gt; &gt;  (for example) "My system panicked with the message "free vnode
&gt; &gt;  isn't".
&gt; 
&gt; This is rather BSD-specific.  Can somebody come up with a good Linux
&gt; alternative?

I know :-( I've not had a system panic in a while, so I've not had
anything recent to base a quote on :-) Community input, please.

&gt; &gt;  If you have difficulty getting PPP to run, describe the
&gt; &gt;  configuration. Which version of PPP do you use?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there more than one in Linux?  FreeBSD has both kernel (Mackerras)
&gt; and userland (awfulhak).

There are pppd's sporting different version numbers, generally
corresponding to the version of the Kernel that you are running.

[ ... ]

&gt; &gt;  8. If you do all this, and you still get no answer, there could be
&gt; &gt; other reasons. For example, the problem is so compilcated 
&gt;                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; Oops.  Is that my typo?

Nope, mine :-) I decided that I'd retype rather than copy/paste as a
typing exercise. My speed has dropped bellow 60WPM of late, and I'm
trying my best to increase it again :-) Evidently my accuracy needs some
working on, too.

[ ... ]

&gt; *sigh* The silly thing is, people do ask about mobile phones, and
&gt; judging by the response, the question isn't that unwelcome.  In the
&gt; FreeBSD lists we have a different issue: we have something like 50
&gt; lists, of which 30 are moribund (we just can't be bothered to bury
&gt; them), but we have another list (FreeBSD-chat) for questions of this
&gt; nature.  LinuxSA only has one list, so it's probably a matter of
&gt; discussion as to whether these questions are admissible or not.  I
&gt; strongly suspect that it also depends on who asks the question.  If
&gt; it's a well-known and well-respected person, they'll get away with
&gt; it.  If a newbie asks the same question, he'll be scampering for his
&gt; asbestos underwear.

I'd like to grab a can of Krylon and draw a big fat underline beneath
the word "silly". I fail to see how anyone can justify a question of
"Which mobile phone is the best" on a _Linux_ list.

I agree that those who are established and recognised in the community
can almost get away with anything. By defining for everyone what is and
isn't acceptable, "newbies" won't have to ware such unconfortable
undergarments :-)[2]

&gt; &gt;  - "Microsoft is saying evil things about the way the Linux
&gt; &gt;     world works. Do they have any factual basis for such
&gt; &gt;     comments?"
&gt; 
&gt; Reject this one.  Everybody knows they don't have any valid reasons.

Reflected in the latest revision. I was trying to think up an example
that could be related to Microsoft vs. Linux (The term vs. used as a
replacement for a more elaborate explanation of my point. You get it
though, don't you?) in the real world.

That one wasn't really that crash-hot, so I've removed it.

[ ... ]

&gt; In the original, this was all on one line.  Yes, I know it's
&gt; difficult, but if an idiot can do it, we should find a way too.

That now happens in the latest revision. It seems my nice MUA was too
nice and wouldn't let me put it on one line. That's why we've got emacs
for document editing, though :-)

[ ... ]

&gt; Which (mea culpa) I haven't done this time.  This looks like a real
&gt; bikeshed.

Hmm. I've said it before and I'll reitterate it here. I'm concerned by
the lack of participation in this thread. Not in numbers of messages,
but in the range of different people giving input. It seems that the
thread has reached a stage where it's no longer a pointless debate like
others we've had recently.

[ ... ]

&gt; Since I wrote this, I've learnt a thing or two:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  Not everybody wants to be copied on the reply.  Some people
&gt;     specifically put Reply-To: headers in their mail excluding them,
&gt;     so that they don't get two copies.  I think we should respect
&gt;     these wishes.  I'm personally of the opposite opinion: mutt and
&gt;     other MUAs flag things addressed specifically to me, so I can pick
&gt;     them out of my 1500 odd mail messages per day more easily.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  It's possible to avoid multiple copies of a single mail message
&gt;     with procmail.  I've got the incantations at home (I'm currently
&gt;     in Adelaide's sister city, Austin TX), but will produce on
&gt;     request.
&gt; 
&gt; The document should reflect these issues.  When you're done, I'll
&gt; filter them back into the FreeBSD version.

I've not yet addressed this. The next revision will cover these issues.

[ ... ]

&gt; &gt;  9. Put your response in the correct place (after the text to which
&gt; &gt; it replies). It's very difficult to read a thread of responses
&gt; &gt; where each reply comes before the text to which it replies.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if we should make this stronger.  I've seen so many
&gt; conflicting techniques that it might be worth explaining how confusing
&gt; it can be if each correspondent uses a different quoting method.

Made stronger, as well as including an example which should make it
fairly clear how to and how NOT to respond.

[ ... ]

&gt; Hmm.  I don't see any particular hurry.  Looking at my thread tree,
&gt; this seems to have generated a considerable amount of, um, interest.

Yeah, there isn't a rush, I suppose. I initially thought that by setting
a 'deadline' more people would take notice :-) How silly of me.

[ ... ]

&gt; I'd recommend weekly.

OK. Easy.

[1] Be a bit creative and put what you like in there :-)

[2] That one was a classic that I'll treasure for ever :-)
