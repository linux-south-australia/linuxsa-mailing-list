Hi Jeremy,

&gt; I have a dell notebook PIII

Are you trying to make me jelous d;-)

&gt; and I run linux on it quite well. Previously to that, I ran linux on a
compaq Pentium 166
&gt; notebook with 48mb ram and that ran beautifully !

Great to see there are a few of us carrying tux around with us.

&gt; I work for a company in Camden Park, and we are linux / microsoft
&gt; network specialists, however if you are interested we are able to supply
&gt; hardware for you at wholesale pricing, and we can set it up with linux
&gt; for you too !

I appreciate that, please send me a mail off-list and we can discuss it.

&gt; Like David said, Richard Sharpe's courses are very good. I've done both
&gt; his Samba/Advanced Samba and 5 day linux courses and all of them were
&gt; great. I believe that his courses will teach you a hell of a lot more
&gt; than a Redhat qualification. Richard's courses don't "count" for
&gt; anything if you want to be another "qualified" person and flash around
&gt; another certificate, but they give an incredible understanding of the
&gt; underlying technologies behind linux which is far more valuable if you
&gt; really want to be in the IT systems administrative field ... (all the
&gt; sys admins I know don't have ANY official qualifications !)

I would love to take Richards course over a Red Hat course. I believe we
should support local bussines over a global corporation any day, but I must
think clearly about this. My situation is that I have been unemployed long
enough to require intensive assistance to get a job. This means I can get a
$5-7k wages subsidy over six months, or suitable training payed for. For
centerlink to pay for training it must result in qualifications that will
help me to get a job. I want to study localy and not nessecarily a red hat
course (id prefer vendor nuetral as well, i like mandrake and debian)

&gt; Many distributions of linux already offer Australian language support,
&gt; but in reality it is really of useless value. Providing your running a
&gt; good kernel built for your system, and you've secured the system and set
&gt; it up for your application it doesn't really matter what distribution or
&gt; "version" you run.

Again, I believe we should support local business over a global corporation
any day.
Is there no value in doing this?

Jay
