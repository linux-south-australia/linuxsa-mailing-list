Thanks for the correction (and it's even worse than I thought). This 
explains why my users are also getting this crap from people they don't 
know. So the list of potential sources now includes:

 - Anyone who has any of my users in their email address books.

 - Anyone who has recently visited any web page here that has a "mailto" 
in it, AND has not cleared their Internet Explorer cache. 4 out of 5 
visitors to this site use IE.

Did I miss anything else?

&gt; This sort of argues in favour of just not using the mailto:
&gt; construction in HTML, because anyone who really
&gt; wants to make contact can do a copy/paste anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; But even if SirCam isn't currently able to parse e-mail addresses
&gt; without the mailto: anchor prefix, a later variant _may_ be able
&gt; to do so.

We already HAVE this problem with spam harvesters! Ways to confound these 
include

 - Mangle the address in the link eg:
   "mailto:<A HREF="mailto:someREMOVE-THISone@example.com">someREMOVE-THISone@example.com</A>"&gt;<A HREF="mailto:someone@example.com">someone@example.com</A>&lt;

 - Build the address from character codes eg:
   "mailto:&#071;&#072;&#100;...

 - Build the address with Javascript eg:
   document.write('mailto:someone')
   document.write('@')
   document.write('example.com')

Unfortunately there are shortcomings with all of these methods. And 
cut-&-paste immediately imposes a convenience problem. People have got 
used to the "click on an address and your emailer automatically appears" 
paradigm...

I'm going to do this for Code Red connections, because it's reasonable to 
assume that a Windows NT/2000 webserver has a static IP. I still have to 
permit the first connection from an infected machine so that I can grab 
its IP.

Unfortunately a lot of the SirCam-related IPs resolve back to modem pools 
at various ISPs. Blocking the whole of Senet or Bigpond or whoever isn't 
an option :(


&gt; By the way, I'm not responding directly to you because
&gt; I don't want to be put into your address book!

Only people who bribe me get put into my address book. Please transfer 
twelve trillion slabechniks, at your earliest convenience, to Account 
#A6783466 at the 14th Bank of the People's Autonomous Monarchy of North 
Antarctica  ;-)


Anyway, back to the bookkeeping...which I still have to do in Windows 
because there's no MYOB for Linux yet.


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
