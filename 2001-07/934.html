&gt; &gt; Hmm... I'll have to find out what RST means (/me furthers his TCP/IP
&gt; &gt; education)
&gt;
&gt; It's the packet a TCP connection sends when something is amiss (amongst
&gt; other reasons).  One of the scan techniques is to send odd packets
&gt; without the SYN bit set which circumvents most firewall rules for
&gt; blocking TCP connections, and watch what comes back.  Such a scan can
&gt; determine what services you're running, but still can't get at you.

hmmm -- I read rfc739 and the ipchains howto, and think I will have to
revisit those rules one day to see how this all interacts...

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think that's just a squid thing - 8080 was traditionally used
&gt; &gt;&gt; for non-root owned web servers (back when running web servers
&gt; &gt;&gt; was less fashionable).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; hmm... how odd...
&gt;
&gt; Not particularly - you can't bind to port &lt; 1024 on Unix servers
&gt; unless you're root, and "8080" was fairly easy to remember, being
&gt; an extraordinarily powerful processor of the 70's (OK, I'm lying
&gt; about that bit ... :-).

Nah, I know that (the &gt;1024 etc)... I was commenting on how odd it was that
squid chose 3128...

&gt; &gt; mmm, or if there's some way that ISPs who transparently proxy
&gt; can give you a
&gt; &gt; way around it when you want to do something like that...
&gt;
&gt; It would be difficult - something like that isn't selective switched on
&gt; for a single IP address, but usually on a router/access server basis.

yeah, I suspect it would be nigh impossible, but it would be nice if you
could do it somehow...
