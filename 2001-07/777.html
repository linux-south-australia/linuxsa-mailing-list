&gt; Admittedly you might need to consult the documentation to setup

Of course. Sendmail's documentation may be a bit scary for people not
used to it. It took me a while to understand some of the peculiarities
of the web-based documentation.

&gt; A few minor adjustments in the actual m4 configuration file is all it
&gt; takes. RedHat's default SendMail configuration is, in my opinion, quite
&gt; secure and the few parts where it is not, it is clearly documented.

Oh, for sure. I feel that Postfix does a better job at it (being
configured).

Stuffing around with the m4 file is a pain. The Postfix main
configuration file (main.cf) is clearly documented every step of the way
(through both comments and web-based documentation).

&gt; (it's difficult to misunderstand a comment that goes "We recommend you
&gt; disable this feature...")

That's something I've always found interesting about RedHat's Sendmail
defaults. "We recommend you disable this feature unless...", yet they
don't disable it. That's pretty stupid if you ask me. Disable it and say
"If you really need to, enable this feature but be aware that X, Y and Z
may happen.

&gt; Personally, in a production envrionment I wouldn't let a "new"
&gt; administrator adminster any e-mail system until he/she could prove
&gt; they'd understood the documentation and what he/she was doing [or there
&gt; was a total emergency and he/she were the only one around].

What about the SME that uses Linux on their Firewall/Mail server? Not
all of the "Linux Administrators" are as competent as you or I at doing
what they do.

As far as I'm concerned, if it's easier to understand and configure,
they'll be less likely to stuff something up.

&gt; I'm still at a loss to understand why fiddling with a few m4 macros,
&gt; which are quite well documented at <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/,">http://www.sendmail.org/,</A> in the
&gt; source and in books is so difficult for some peole.

Look, David, I really don't mind stuffing around with configuration
files when I have to, but I prefer not to. I'd rather not waste my time
on doing such things when a better alternative exists.

If you prefer to do that, that's great. The people who pay me require me
to use my time as efficiently as possible, so I've tried to do that in
using a "decent" MTA.

&gt; (ps: isn't it spelled "d'oh"?)

No, it's not. "Well, duh" meaning "Of course", not "Damn, that hurt" or
whatever. Pronounced similarly to the way one says "Da" in Russian.
