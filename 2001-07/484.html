I don't have a problem with html email. I prefer text, because it is
usually more readable, and I dont care about formatting/fonts and I
really hate stupid colours (I just got one html email with black quotes,
blue text and a purple background!). But the main reason I havnt said
anything in this html debate, is I dont really care, and my mailer
handles html fine. I think it is preferable to try an avoid it, but it
is no biggie to me.

&gt; 
&gt; Okay.  This rather boils down to, "we don't want to receive HTML mail
&gt; but can't give a cogent reason why not."  Personal taste, I suppose,
&gt; is a reason nobody can argue with, but it hardly advances a reasoned
&gt; debate on the pros and cons of HTML.
&gt; 
&gt; It's obvious that I have been rethinking my antipathy towards HTML email,
&gt; and that I'm finding it hard to continue to justify it.  Frankly you
&gt; pointing out issues such as mailing list trailers, and then saying,
&gt; "yes you could fix that easily but doing so would be counter-productive,"
&gt; doesn't really help.  (I don't mean that in a nasty way, you understand.)
&gt; 
&gt; Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
&gt; Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
&gt; these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
&gt; or else switch camps and take me with you.
