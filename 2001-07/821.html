&gt; &gt; I propose putting this in NFS, not in user programs...
&gt;
&gt; Ah.  That's a much better idea than what I originally thought you meant.
&gt; And yet... If you change the date on the NFS server, suddenly all the
&gt; files on it have different modification times.

yeah... but which is the greater evil? I would assume that servers (by their
nature as servers) should normally keep better time than clients... (present
case excluded)...

My reasoning is as follows:

Assume: Severs keep better, more linear time than clients.

Assume: Accuracy in "how long ago" something happened is more important then
exactly when it happened... (and if the when is important, then you'd better
have your clock right...)

Hence, get the server to tell you how long ago an event occured, and then
calculate when this was according to your own time system... Hence, relative
times should always be pretty accurate...

This will be good for things like Make. However, it will be bad for things
like "I created that file last wednesday"... but then again, if your client
clock is wrong (or was wrong when you created said file), then you have
little hope of that anyway...  hmm: a table would be good here...

Possibilities:

1. Client slow, Server slow
	Not much hope of any sense here... although if Server time is at least
linear, relative times will remain correct. Files will look the right age to
the software, but old to the user.

2. Client slow, Server correct
	Make would normally die in this situation, but in this case, would work
perfectly. However, files will all look like they are older than they are,
as opposed to looking like they were created in the future to the client,
whilst looking correct to the user

3. Client slow, Server fast
	same as 2 above, but files will look even older than they are...

4. Client correct, server slow
	Make would normally succeed here, but may do more work thna it needs...
Files will look (to the user) to be created at the correct time, although
the server will be out of sync.

5. Client correct, server correct
	woohoo

6. Client correct, server fast
	to the user, files will appear the correct age, and also to tools...
Normally, make would fail here...

7. Client fast, server slow
	the user would see files that looked to be in the future, although tools
would be fine. Normally, make would succeed here, but may do more work than
needed.

8. Client fast, server correct
	as above, but times on server would at least be correct.

9. Client fast, server fast
	not much hope here...

Hmmm

I think the main issue I see here is that users may make assumptions about
files -- I cna imagine someone saying "I created that file on monday,
therefore it should be on monday's backup of the server" and looking there
and not finding it becasue it was actually tuesday or something. Ideally,
there would be some sort of user-space flag to change this behaviour for
each program run, without modifying that program whatsoever... (kinda like
making it dynamically link with a differnt file access library, but I can't
see that as being practical at all...) I'd suspect it would have to be an
admin decision, per-server/client pairing, and I can't see that happening
either... too hard to change perhaps? Are there any file sharing protocols
out there that deal in time deltas and not absolute times? IMHO, time deltas
are more sensible when talking about networks, but yeah, I know that it's
impossible to absolutely ensure clock synchronisation -- I did physics, you
know :)
