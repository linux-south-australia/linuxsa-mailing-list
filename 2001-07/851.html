&gt; You can, but its a Fairly Bad Idea(tm) unless you implement the login
&gt; procedure in a very strict, limited, way.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember all those statistics about how many web pages per second
&gt; Apache/Linux can serve? Remember the stats about how many possible tries it
&gt; takes to brute force common passwords? Now, do the math ;)
&gt; 
&gt; There is a reason why scp/telnet/su/etc have delays in them, to prevent
&gt; brute force attacks.

I was under the impression that you could put a delay in for any service
you like (isn't it just another pam module?).

&gt; For a second reason, remember you're probably sending these logins and
&gt; passwords over an insecure network, possibly allowing someone to snoop and
&gt; snaffle them. Also, there are various ways you could fool someone into
&gt; entering the data into a trojan page.
&gt; 
&gt; Although these are true regardless of your password source, the exploit is
&gt; made worse when you could follow up by impa/sshing into the box using what
&gt; you obtained. Generally its a bad idea to teach your users to use a single
&gt; password for all accounts

SSL goes a way to getting around that stuff doesn't it?

One problem, is that you need to be root to be able to use PAM for
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow accounts. Given that apache runs as 'nobody'
(or 'apache', etc, etc), you will have problems with authentication.

Hope it helps,
Matt
