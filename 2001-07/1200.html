Hi Richard,

&gt;This is an interesting discussion, not!
With all due respect...I clearly marked my email as "off topic"
and gave it an appropriate subject heading...you were not forced
to read it...nor respond to it.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;I found that there were questions in the LPI102 exam that were
&lt;possible to finesse. As long as one knew enough about the general
&lt;area, one could often get the right answer without knowing the
&lt;exact answer.
And so it is in real life...if I am given a problem that I do not
know the exact answer to...using my general knowledge in that area
will often assist in finding the correct solution...however those
that only memorize exam questions would be less likely to get the
correct answer as they lack the required general knowledge.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;In setting questions, I found myself preffering those where two
&lt;pieces of information had to be given.
I believe scenario questions is a good way of determining if the
candidate understands the required concepts...eg: describe the
scenario...list the required and optional outcomes...provide a
possible solution...which of the required and optional outcomes
are achieved with the stated solution.

&lt;snip&gt;
&lt;As to these bozos with certification, an MCP is not all that good.
&lt;An MCSE is better.
True...although an MCP may have completed all required subjects for
MCSE minus one elective...hardly a big difference.

&lt;But one does hear of 2 year olds who have passed their MCSE's.
Hmmm...I haven't...maybe I need to get out more.

&lt;All I can say is that prospecive employers should insist on the
&lt;shaving test. If they don't cut themselves shaving, they can probably
&lt;be trusted near a computer :-)
LOL

Regards,
Richard Watkins
