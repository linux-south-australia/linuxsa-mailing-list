&gt;
&gt; &gt; It sounds to me that what you need is the O'Reilly book
&gt; &gt; on Linux and Lego Mindstorms.
&gt;
&gt; Cool, I'll have a look into that one as well as the Device Drivers book
&gt;
&gt; &gt; cheap Mindstorms set and a book, you should have enough to
&gt; &gt; get started. There are also some very good books at Dick
&gt; &gt; Smith Electronics on Robots at the moment that include
&gt; &gt; software clips in Visual Basic which should point you in the
&gt; &gt; right direction, and then all you have to do is port them
&gt;
&gt; Also looking into that, thanks.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There are several HOWTOs available also on
&gt; &gt; Mindstorms, and Device Drivers that would come in handy.
&gt;
&gt; I found a heap on LDP last night, but didn't know about the Mindstorms
one.
&gt; Do now...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you are already into electronics,
&gt;
&gt; Not quite! This is the beggining of it d;-j
&gt;
&gt; &gt; communication boards that plug into your PC that you build
&gt; &gt; as a kit that are aimed at just what you want and are also
&gt; &gt; available at DSE and other places. Pretty much it should
&gt; &gt; cost you about A$250 for a mindstorms kit, a com card kit,
&gt; &gt; and a couple of books, and then you should have everything
&gt; &gt; that you need. If you want to do it on the cheap, then I
&gt; &gt; would recommend a book from DSE and an old computer of some
&gt; &gt; description and some parts and away you go. Hope this helps.
&gt;
&gt; It did, thanks.
