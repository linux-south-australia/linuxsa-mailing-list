&gt; 
&gt; OK, Jason. This comes back to "How to get best results from LinuxSA"
&gt; type-things. They didn't know they were not to post in HTML. The
&gt; aforementioned document aims (amongst other things) to relieve the
&gt; community of that problem.

Yes it does come down to exactly taht.


&gt; 
&gt; It's not an unreasonable request. It's not like we're asking people to
&gt; chew their left-arm off while hopping only on their big toes, is it? I
&gt; mean, seriously. They want free support. We say "Sure, just make sure
&gt; you don't send bastardized emails in HTML". Not a bad deal if you ask
&gt; me.

It not unreasonable assumign peopel know what rtfm is and they cna find
the manual.

Chances are in many cases that they dont know what rtfm is, anor where ot
find/access the manual.
In which case it is unreasonable.

Smae with html mail.
If peopel a knew that it was poor form to psot it,a nd b knew how to turn
it off, they probalby would.
They wnat answers not lectures on ettiquette.

I susepct they woudl do whatever it takes to get answers, if they knwew
what to do.

Newbies by definiton dont know what to do.

&gt; &gt; Auto copy all stuff fromt eh newbie list ot eh amin list.
&gt; 
&gt; No, please. Let's not subscribe mailing lists to each other. That's just
&gt; a pain. There are ways that you can identify the two lists from each
&gt; other, but that'd be bad.

Whyis it a pain?

It is going to affect me as much as you.
I dont think it will be painfull.
After all the gurus on the "normal" list will all know how to ue procmail
or whtatever, how does it effect them.

The traffic level will be the same. Or at least it will be if you
genuienly believe tha tthe current form of the list doenst discourage
newbies/shy people form psosting newby questions.
If you dont believe that then that is why the second list is required.

In short I cnat see how it hurts but I cna see how it might help some
people.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That wat y newbies ahve access to techinical knowldge, without having to
&gt; &gt; put up with the stiuff they dont want ot hear, or dont ahve time to hear.
&gt; 
&gt; No. See above.

Above just says you dont like it, it doesnt say why.

&gt; I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark here and assume that that line
&gt; was meant to read "Not a conscious effort".
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But if you ask a quesiton you might not get an attempt at an answer, but
&gt; &gt; if you do it in the wrong format you will almost certianly get a gruff
&gt; &gt; reply.
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting. You're refering to David Lloyd here, I'm sure. One thing
&gt; that you've discounted here is the fact that when David complains about
&gt; the HTML in the message, he also answers the question. I can't see the
&gt; problem, especially as David's posts are in no way able to be classed as
&gt; a flame or otherwise offensive.

Bad assumption.
Lots of peopel ahve made gruff replies at times to people who have not
presneted their message inthe way that person likes.

I ahve on numerous occaison seen replies which criticise the format of the
reply without offering any help.

This annoys me personally. I feel it makes peopel feel unwlecome and makes
us look like peopel who are more concrended with foorm than substance.
It also makes us looka little pretenious and unaccessable, I feel.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If the questionis considred to basic you will get a gruff reply.
&gt; 
&gt; No. Maybe blunt. Ie:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt; How do I use 'ls'
&gt; 
&gt; 	'man ls'
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; We may not consiously push people away, but if you wnet into a shop and
&gt; &gt; said "to buy a fish I'd like to" and the saleman said. "I wont sell to you
&gt; &gt; until you can speak proper english", whould you buy from that shop?
&gt; 
&gt; Completely different. When you go to a shop, you're about to hand over
&gt; your money and expect a certain level of service in return. LinuxSA is a
&gt; bunch of volunteers doing their best to teach and learn in an informal,
&gt; non-financially driven environment.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you asked the salesman "what sort of car has 4 wheel drive" and he said
&gt; &gt; "go read a car buyers guide" (ie rtfm) woudl you wnat to buy from him?
&gt; 
&gt; Dear me -- we have lost the point, haven't we. RTFM simply means "Read
&gt; this: It'll explain it all for you". Why on earth would anyone waste
&gt; their time helping someone who's not prepared to help themselves?

RTFM means "read the fucking manual".
If a total stranger used that sort of profanity to me after i asked a
simple question, perhaps badly phrased or in poor english(but as polite
as I _knew_ how acording to my cultuural norms and what I knew of their
culture - the relvant cultrues here likely being a win culture or a
newby culture and the linux sa culture where html is bad and aksing
stuff covered in man pages is bad), I would be offended and not talk to
them again.

The fact the profanituy is encapslated in an acronym doenst make it any
less profane.

Of course a newbie may not know what rtfm actually means, in which case
they simly would not understand what was being said, and probalby give up
and assume this list was aimed ata diffferent audience to them - perhaps
correctly.

 &gt; &gt; Would you return to those shops?
&gt; 
&gt; Those shops aren't really relevant in this thread.

This was an analogy. Most analogies break down at some point.
No we dont expect money, but we constantly talk about increasing the
linux/opensource userbase.
And that presumably is our reward, along with the statisfaction of helping
people.

The point was as soemone esle pointed out, that the idea of courtesy and
repsect for people even if they are nto as experienced as you is usuallya
good thing.

It certianly is if you want to encourage them to try somethign new.

&gt; You can dispute that, Jason. To be completely blunt and frank, you're
&gt; being "sissy" about it. I suppose it all comes down to what you define a
&gt; flame as. It seems that some have a particularly low level of tolerance
&gt; in this department.

Sissy. You mean trying to be considerate of other people who are different
to me, who dont have the same level of experienve, knowledge or teim spent
in a given culture?

That is sissy?

Then I am a sissy.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why?
&gt; &gt; Anything can work if we want to to work.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, right-o. I'd really like for my laptop to grow another couple of
&gt; processors, my dog to come back to life and the fire to stay running all
&gt; by itslef. I want it to work. But for some strange reason, it doesn't.
&gt; Perhaps you've got some pointers you'd like to share with me that can
&gt; help.

If you really wnat two cpus in your laptop you cn have them.
you have to wnat them bad enough and you will expend the tiem and effort
to get them.

I am sure a dog with the same genes as your dog coudl be produced if you
want it bad enough.

There is cetrwinly no reason why this proposal cant owrk either.

&gt; Seriously, now. Read bellow.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It will fail if people dont want it to succeded though.
&gt; 
&gt; Well there's your stumbling block. I for one do not want it to succeed.
&gt; I have my reasons, as do the other advocates of "leaving it as it is".

Good.

Then make it fail.
Dont change the status quo it is very comfortable.
