Hi Shaun,

We have made contact several times with Computerbank SA and I am still 
waiting for a reply on setting up a meeting to discuss how that project 
and ours can work together on this aspect. Especially we would ike to 
discuss the distro and setup that you use and what level of training 
and followup support that you offer your clients.

We believe that Linux and Star Office are the way we would like to 
nudge the community sector away from the commercial MS-dominated path 
and we would like to do all we can to make that happen. 

That is why I am so appreciative of the help and advice that I am 
getting back from the LinuxSA members. 

I am sure that with this level of support that we will soon have a 
simple and stable Linux system running with SO that can help us drive 
more people over to the way of the Penguin.

Cheers, Ian

Ian, I am a volunteer for Computerbank, we have been donating PC's with 
Linux, and applications such as AbiWord, Gnumeric for many years now. 

We mainly deal with new or very inexperienced users and these systems 
work fine. At times we have systems capable of running SO, but a 
typical system is pentium 100ish, 1.2Gb HDD, 32mb ram. 

These systems are wonderful for teaching computer skills and providing 
communication and other tools to the recipients. If you are able to 
provide some training and some ongoing support (as Computerbank does) 
then I think that Linux and open source software will meet all your 
software needs.
