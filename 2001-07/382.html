Hi There!

&gt; Is any one running Linux on a laptop on this list?

Not personally but I've got it running on a few Toshiba top-end laptops.

&gt; I'm thinking of buying one, but being poor I'll be stuck with a choice of
&gt; generic model runing an AMD k6-2 450 MHz.

What's wrong with that? Linux, with a reasonable amount of memory, will
run quite nicely on it.

&gt; There isnt any issues with Linux running on AMD chips is there?

No. In fact, Windows 95 totally bombs on my AMD K6-II's and K6-III's
whereas Linux and FreeBSD go on a treat.

&gt; As far as my (limited) understanding goes, as long as it's an x86 it will
&gt; go, right???

It could also be a Sparc, a DEC Alpha (well, Compaq), the thing that
runs IBM 370's, a PowerPC, possible a G4 notebook...the short answer is
yes. The long answer is that Linux has been ported to many architectures
some of which have been put into laptop form.

&gt; Does anyone know of any computer shops in Adelaide offering Linux
&gt; pre-installed?

No, however I think IBM make laptops with Linux installed and it's
possible - but don't quote me - that Compaq do too.

&gt; Or what about Linux friendly (or at least aware) computer shops.

Contact me off list and I can put you onto a number of people I know who
can sell you hardware who also use Linux themselves.

&gt; My experience has been hearing how my zip drive, buzz card and cd burner
&gt; would never work with linux!

Excuse me for being so blunt, but that's crap. Tell the list the model
and we'll give you much better answers and somebody will probably help
you find the documentation to help yourself.

&gt; Then there's the "how is your computer going to turn off" senario with a
&gt; King William Street retailer.

Pull out da plug, James.

&gt; Do we have many options for training / certification in Adelaide?

Richard Sharpe runs Hands On Linux Courses:

* <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/">http://www.iit-training.com.au/</A>

His course is very good and a number of people on this list have taken
it.

Robyn Manning has mentioned a Linux course on the lists. You can contact
her at (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:rmanning@micronet.net.au">rmanning@micronet.net.au</A>).

&gt; I'd like to do a RHCE course and maybe even get LPI or SAIR certification in
&gt; the future.

Contact Netcraft (goto <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com.au/">http://www.netcraft.com.au/</A>). Last time I spoke
to them, they said that they run certification courses interstate but
there hasn't been enough interest in SA (i.e. there's been interest but
not enough people willing to actually pay).

&gt; What are my options in Adelaide? So far I've been relying on the net,
&gt; HOWTO's manpages, luck etc.

Please, keep on relying on them. And talk to us - LinuxSA will help you
if you try to help yourself :-)

&gt; But none of those things has offered me any certification d;-)

Bah! Experience counts too. I've worked with a number of "college
graduates" and they know very little. System administration,  in my
opinion, is something that is augmented by qualifications...

&gt; And finally, are there any people working on a local (Australian) version of
&gt; linux?

Why would we do that?
