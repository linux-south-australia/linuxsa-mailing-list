Hi Ben,

Firstly an apology. I was under the impression that KIllustrator was 
under development. I failed to recognise the term as applying most of 
the Open-Source software. It is all under development &lt;G&gt;

It was discussed at a European Linux Conference in 99 and probably goes 
back further than that.

I found the page describing the product and the source code so 
according to their info it has made it up to a 0.6 project so it is 
well on the way.

<A HREF="http://www.rarf.riken.go.jp/archives/X11/KDE-">http://www.rarf.riken.go.jp/archives/X11/KDE-</A>
contrib/killustrator/killustrator.html

Index of /archives/X11/KDE-contrib/killustrator
<A HREF="http://www.rarf.riken.go.jp/archives/X11/KDE-contrib/killustrator/">http://www.rarf.riken.go.jp/archives/X11/KDE-contrib/killustrator/</A>

The list of features on the first-named page indicates that this is a 
very powerful prgram and if it lives up to the claims it will be a 
killer ap for all graphics designers.

I also noted the claim that the interface follows the Corel interface 
not the Adobe interface so perhaps the claim of the lawyers really is 
only about the program's name similarity?

Whatever, it is a program that interests me and once I get these 
project computers out of the way and Linux-ed to the max I can then 
look around and maybe have a try at this program. I want it &lt;G&gt;

The comment about the lawyers acting on their own behalf in the hope of 
gaining patronage from the company they wish to represent is 
interesting. I dread the day such a travesty might show its ugly head 
in Australian law.

Cheers,

Ian
