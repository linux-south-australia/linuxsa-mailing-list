<H1>Mandrake 7.2 installation problem</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Some months ago (mid April I think) I asked David Lloyd for some advice
on installing Mandrake 7.2 as he had helped somebody else previously.  I
tried his suggestions without success and decided to drop the whole
thing for the time being and perhaps come back to it when I had more
time.  Now with some spare time, I thought I'd put the problem before
the group and see if anybody could suggest anything.

I have tried three separate CDs of Mandrake, from three separate
sources, with the same result so I am fairly confident that the problem
is more than just a dud disc.  First, the symptoms:

After re-booting with the CD in the drive, what I assume to be a
standard Mandrake header graphic appears, followed by lines of text
messages which scroll down the screen to a certain point and then stop. 
At this point only a re-boot will achieve anything.  The screen messages
(not counting parts which have scrolled off the top too fast to read)
are:

Split FIFO Configuration: 8 Primary buffers, threshold = 1/2
		8 Second. buffers, threshold = 1/2
	ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
ide0: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
	ide1: BM-DMA at 0xe008-0xe00f, BIOS settings: hdc: DMA, hdd:DMA
ide1: VIA Bus-Master (U)DMA Timing Config Success
hda: WDC AC26400R, ATA DISK drive
hdb: LS-120 VER5 00 UHD Floppy, ATAPI FLOPPY drive
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000014
current-&gt;tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000
#pde = 00000000
Ooops: 0000
CPU:	0
EIP:	0010:[&lt;c0108c59&gt;]
EFLAGS:	000100002
......
......  (register dump etc)

My system:

AMD K6-2 cpu running at 400MHz
6.4 Gbyte hard disc drive
LS-120 (120 Mbyte) super-floppy disc drive (this doubles as a standard
1.4 Mbyte floppy drive when necessary)
40x ATAPI CF-ROM drive
Redback 336E external modem
Acer Vuego Brisa 320P scanner on the parallel port
Canon BJC4200 printer piggy-backed on the back of the scanner
Philips 107S monitor
128 Mbytes of memory
Windows98 and Caldera eDesktop 2.4 dual booting with Bootmagic.

The hard disc is partitioned as follows:
	hda1:	primary partition holding Windows (drive C 1019 Mbytes)
	hda2:	extended partition
	hda5:	logical partition - Linux /boot (15 Mbytes)
	hda6:	logical partition - Linux Swap (250 Mbytes)
	hda7:	logical partition - Linux /home (1576 Mbytes)
	hda8:	logical partition - Linux / (3286 Mbytes)

Other devices are:
	hdb:	LS-120 drive
	hdc:	CD-ROM drive

My interrupts are (from /proc/interrupts):
	0	timer
	1	keyboard
	2	cascade
	4	serial
	8	rtc
	12	cmpci
	13	fpu
	14	ide0
	15	ide1

I have been running Caldera OpenLinux since mid-1999, moving up through
versions 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, with no trouble.  The only installation
glitch is that I can't make a boot floppy because I don't have a floppy
drive - I had to do this manually after installation.  I have also
installed Red Hat 7.0 with no trouble, and SuSE 7.1 within the Windows
partition.

Can somebody help me please - while I am fairly happy with Caldera 2.4,
I would like to try Mandrake.
