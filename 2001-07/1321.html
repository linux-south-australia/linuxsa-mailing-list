Hi All

Please stop reading the message if you do not seeing product advertising.

Over the last 6 month or so I have seen request's for information about rack
mounted server chassis, and have not really seen many responses, so I have
been looking for a supplier of these and have found a great product.

I have put together a high end bare bones products, which comes in a 1U or
2U rack mount chassis. I'm still getting together the technical and sales
documentation for these product, but I looking for a show of interest.

The really nice things about these cases is they have a 2 by 20 Char LCD
display which monitors 4 Fan's and 2 Temp. devices, plus doing external
watchdog. The internal Alarm board has a serial port which is connect to one
of the serial ports of the CPU card. All the documentation on how to display
custom information and use the watchdog system comes with the chassis.

1U Rack Chassis: $2250
    2 Free PCI Slots
    2 SCSI SCA-2 Hot Swap Bays (A cheaper model of the case has 2 ATA 66
Bays)

2U Rack Chassis: $2550
    4 Free PCI Slots
    4 SCSI SCA-2 Hot Swap Bays (A cheaper model of the case has 4 ATA 66
Bays)

Common
        1 Dual Pentium 3 CPU Card, with Dual 100/10 LAN, Dual Ultra 160 SCSI
ports, Dual ATA 100, Video, 2 Serial, 1 Parallel
    2 Low Profile Copper Heatsink and Blower Fans
    Slim CD-ROM
    Floppy

CPU's, Memory and Hard drives would need to be added to this above cost.

I can lower the specifications to the point that you could build a 1U
Chassis for about $2500 with everything. (IDE only) Just a note one of the
CPU cards is a single board Socket-370 with RAID 0,1, 0/1 support (which is
supported by Linux)

Again to any one upset please accept my apologies, and to those interested
please contact my off list.


Cheers
    Mike O'Connor
