Hi David,

Agree completely with your comments. If it was a perfect world then 
they would have heard about Linux from their schools and peers. 
Unfortunately that is just not going to happen in the foreseeable years 
so we have to do the work where we can.

Our project reaches out into the community and if we can get the 
backing we hope to take it across Salisbury City. With over 115,000 
residents in the City we have a potential audience worth reaching with 
the Linux message. 

&gt;
Having made that point, I do think that if we are to win the war of the
desktop we have to unseat Office in particular and Windows in general.
We need more people using unix and have to grasp opportunities where
we can.  Microsoft use the strategy of placing Windows in education
institutions, so that everybody becomes acclimatised to it.  We can
put unix in places that they don't, such as community computer centres,
childcare centres, public libraries and such, and thus improve public
awareness of alternatives to Microsoft.
&gt;

That is how we hope to be able to spread the word therefore we need 
good commercial-looking programs and stable platforms that can show off 
Linux to the best of it's potential.

That is also why it is important to not ignore the entrenched support 
there is for the MS way of doing things and using that to our 
advantage. If we can build compatibility while still going down the 
Linux path then we have the chance to affect the way many people think 
of their computers and the costs involved.

Thanks for the interesting post.

Cheers,

Ian
