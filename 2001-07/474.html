It was Wed, Jul 11, 2001 at 10:01:56AM +0930.  David Rowlands spake:
&gt; Yes I've worked out how to bridge 2 networks together, I guess what
&gt; I'm really asking is if it's possible to have 2 nics in the same
&gt; machine belonging to the same network (in my case,
&gt; 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0) and have the data flowing across the 2.

Ok:

&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to add another pc to my network, but my hub is full and
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't really want to buy another hub just for 1 pc.  I have plenty
&gt; &gt; &gt; of network cards and could put the other pc on it's own network
&gt; &gt; &gt; and use one of the linux boxes as a bridge using ipchains.

I think you mean, in the above paragraph, that you could use the linux
box as a router.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I instead use the linux as a hub and have the new pc on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same network?

Yes.  To do this, you use bridging.

&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, could I have eth0 as 192.168.0.1 (which is plugged in
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the existing hub) and eth1 as 192.168.0.2 and the new pc as
&gt; &gt; &gt; 192.168.0.10 (cross over cable between the new pc and eth1), with
&gt; &gt; &gt; packets from and to the new pc going through eth1 and then out to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the rest of the network on eth0?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You should check out linux's 'bridging' features.  Do a google
&gt; &gt; search, or maybe there's a HOWTO?

You should check out linux's bridging features ;)
