 &gt; &gt; The question you should be asking is, "Why do I have an X session *AND*
 &gt; &gt; a console session, when the only thing I use the console session for is
 &gt; &gt; to start my X server?"  Don't do this, use xdm.  That's what it's for,
 &gt; &gt; that's what it has always been for, that's what you're supposed to use.
 &gt; 
 &gt; There's a teency-weency problem with this.
 &gt; It's a good idea if you always have the same monitor on each machine,
 &gt; but in my case, I often either remove the monitor or swap monitors.
 &gt; In that case, there's a danger of not being able to control
 &gt; my machine on boot-up. 

I don't follow -- Why is there a problem with that?

If you boot a machine up with an X configuration which doesn't work with
the timings appropriate for whatever monitor you have plugged in, you
hit CTRL-ALT-F1 and login on a console, frob the modelines, and 
kill the X server (xdm will then restart it for you).

 &gt; I've foudn that the options on xdm, gdm and kdm are often
 &gt; quite restrictive too. Like all "user friendly" systems,
 &gt; they make things easier if you want to do what's in the menus,
 &gt; but not if you're an individual.

There are no menus in xdm.  xdm's sole and only job is to manage your
display for the purposes of session management.

It gives you a login window, with a username field and a password field
and nothing else.  When you login it runs .xsession in your home directory
(if it's executable), or a system .xsession.  So you can configure it as
much or as little as you want.

 &gt; But I take your point.
 &gt; I can run xdm/gdm/kdm on a machine which always has
 &gt; the same monitor, and control all other machines from that -
 &gt; and forgo the flexibility of being able to start up from
 &gt; a getty-style login prompt.
 
I'm still missing something here, because it seems like you're syaing
there's a problem with xdm which logging in on a text console and typing
"startx" solves.

That's not the case.  If you login on a text console and type "startx", 
you end up with nothing more or less than a less-secure version of what
xdm offers.

 &gt; Having the ability to go back to the getty consoles is
 &gt; often _essential_ to get back control of my computer when the
 &gt; windows system (e.g. KDE) hangs totally.

That's what CTRL-ALT-F1 is for.

 &gt; &gt;From what you're saying, these getty consoles are still
 &gt; available with the xdm etc. in the inittab.
 &gt; (This is one of the first things I _remove_ when I install
 &gt; and configure a new system, using the management tools.)
 
Well there's your problem :-)
