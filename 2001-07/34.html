&gt; &gt; Sometimes clicking on an icon, or dragging a icons can be faster or
&gt; &gt; provide details of a system or its structure.
&gt; 
&gt; Providing system details or its structure can be achieved by using the
&gt; CLI. The GUI tools out there (that do this sort of thing) generally just
&gt; pull a heap of system information together and spit it out on your
&gt; screen. It's nothing that couldn't be easilly achieved by using a shell
&gt; script.

GUI tools do not always call shell scripts etc... Some GUI tools are
better written and more informative than the command line and vice versa.

What we havent clarified is if CLI means tools like midnight commander,
that are a text based display. Yes, it does have a CLI built in, but I
mean the directory pannels. When I say CLI, I mean using ifconfig, as
opposed to linuxconf (I don't know how good that example is. :-) )

&gt; &gt; Other times the command line produces a clearer picture, and is faster for
&gt; &gt; doing things like pipes.
&gt; 
&gt; Or changing network interface settings, managing routing, sending an
&gt; email, checking to see if a host is alive, listing the contents of a
&gt; directory, deleting files, moving files, creating compressed archives...

Sometimes I type 'ping' or 'nmap' to see if a host is alive, other times
is is nice to have 'nessus' output into a chart, while choosing the
multitude of functions and attacks with the GUI buttons. Sometimes in
nessus it is easier to edit the config file. But unless you use sed,
editing a text file is not truely CLI, it is either a text mode 'GUI' or a
full GUI. Well, you can use 'cat &gt; configfile' as well. But I cant
remember the entire file or its format.
There are other GUI tools that display a chart of hosts in a network
diagram, and you can see at a glance which ones are alive and how good the
network trafic is. I do not want to do that on a command line. Unless it
was a script, but then I would have to read the output.

There is also a blur between using CLI to run one command, and using a
script, which becomes a new command or GUI tool.

Dale.
