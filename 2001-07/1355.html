Evidently you've not worked with Wireless gear much, then.

&gt; Phone lines would be ur closest bet - without getting too expensive

Or ADSL or Cable, depending on your location.

&gt; Wireless lans that reach about 20-30 m cost over a 1000 dollars for the
&gt; station and 300 for the cards!

Er, yeah. So? It's an 11Mbps[1] connection. It's the cheapest "fat-pipe"
bandwidth available to date. We run our Internet connection off
(straight into Internode's network :-) Cisco AiroNet gear.

Be aware that there are regulations that apply to the usage of Wireless
gear. For example, if you plan to charge for data or service provision,
you're going to be breaking Federal Telecomunications law (unless you're
a registered telco, of course).

I spoke to the ACA (or was it the ABA, I can't remember) about the laws
etc regarding this. Basically, you can run a long range wireless link
without breaking the law, as long as you're not charging anyone for it.

The Lucent stuff may be quite OK for what you need. Make sure you don't
waste your time with the shitty Lucent AP/Bridge things -- they're an
incredible waste of money. Simply purchase an ISA PCMCIA bridge thingo
and a Lucent card. 

I'd not expect you to be able to get away with it for any less than
about $1700-1800, seeing as the Lucent cards are about $350 each, plus
an antenna ($400), cabling ($100), pigtail ($150) and two ISA cards @
$180 each ($360).

You'll need a direct line of sight between the two antennas, as well as
rooftop access to the two buildings.

It's fast though, and damn cheap. It's worth it if you've got a couple
of grand to spear.

[1] Well, 11Mbps is what the card is theoretically capable of.
Realistically, probably a couple of Mbps is realistic. That's probably
going to translate into several hundred kilobytes per second, which is
nothing to sneeze at.
