&gt; I don't have a problem with html email. I prefer text, because it is

&gt; really hate stupid colours (I just got one html email with black quotes,
&gt; blue text and a purple background!). But the main reason I havnt said
&gt; anything in this html debate, is I dont really care, and my mailer
&gt; handles html fine. I think it is preferable to try an avoid it, but it
&gt; is no biggie to me.

Yes, but you use Mozilla, and it shows.  You've left the entire text
in place, including unsubscribe instructions, and put your reply out
of sequence with the original messages, which were laid out in the
opposite sense.  I've done the same this time to illustrate the issue.
A couple more up and down replies like this and nobody will be able to
read it.  The chronological sequence of this message is currently 3 4
1 2.

I can understand why you do this: it's painful to use Mozilla as an
MUA.  But that doesn't make it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's counterproductive because we (most of us) don't want to receive

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Okay.  This rather boils down to, "we don't want to receive HTML mail
&gt;&gt; but can't give a cogent reason why not."  Personal taste, I suppose,
&gt;&gt; is a reason nobody can argue with, but it hardly advances a reasoned
&gt;&gt; debate on the pros and cons of HTML.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's obvious that I have been rethinking my antipathy towards HTML email,
&gt;&gt; and that I'm finding it hard to continue to justify it.  Frankly you
&gt;&gt; pointing out issues such as mailing list trailers, and then saying,
&gt;&gt; "yes you could fix that easily but doing so would be counter-productive,"
&gt;&gt; doesn't really help.  (I don't mean that in a nasty way, you understand.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
&gt;&gt; Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
&gt;&gt; these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
&gt;&gt; or else switch camps and take me with you.
