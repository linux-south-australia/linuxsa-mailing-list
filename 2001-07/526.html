Rather than give umpteen replies, I'll make a few comments to messages
posted elsewhere in this thread:

This is not a troll.  The issue of HTML mail causes regular angst, yet
we haven't really discussed whether or not we are a HTML hostile list.
Everybody has assumed that we are, but no reason has been given.  The
comment about 1E9 flies is quite glib, but is a poor simile because
HTML *is* an improvement and does appear to be the emerging standard
for marked up mail.

It's true that HTML mail can be much larger, particularly when pointless
images are attached.  The actual text expansion is not really an issue.
I don't want to look at percentage expansion of two line messages (thank
you very much David Lloyd), but prefer to consider a more sensible and
common size.  The overhead on a non-trivial message is trivial.

Maybe that's true, maybe not.  There are plenty of HTML viewers and I
think it's a given that there is a sufficient choice of "good" ones.
Perhaps the problem is a lack of HTML editors?  Yet there are choices
here, too.  Do you truly think there is none which is satisfactory?
Personally I find vi works well.  Without wishing to be contraversial,
I think Outlook Express does quite a reasonable job, too.


&gt; There's no effective way of quoting text.

You said that before, and I was unconvinced, so I took it upon myself
to work through the problem using the GIF that you attached.

By the way there's no reason to believe that the mail in your GIF comes
from an HTML mailer.  The inserted line breaks (which is what you appear
to be criticising) could come from any number of plain text editors.
(Pico springs quickly to mind.)  I'd say that's compelling evidence that
the quoting problem is format neutral.

There are two common ways of continuing a dialogue.  One has the
original message appearing below the new commentary; the other has
inline commentary.  I discover that adding commentary above the original
message is trivial.  See the attachment, above.html, which is based upon
the mail in your GIF.  (I added an ongoing dialogue because otherwise
the problem was trivially easy however you look at it.)

The inline commentary is certainly a lot harder.  See inline.html.
The issue, I discovered, is that you need to consider the way in which
the original text has already been quoted, and the level of nesting.
For a given dialogue there might be N levels of quoting.  When you want to
insert your comments you need to end all of the quoting mechanism at the
point of your comment, and you need to start it again after your comment.
That can require you to think rather carefully.

Yet I think that an HTML can do that for you.  Breaking a table, so that
the continuation contains the same style features as the preceeding part
doesn't seem hard.


&gt; People who use HTML mail also tend to write badly laid-out messages

I must be misunderstanding you.  The point appears hysterical, or
prejudiced, or both.  Shall we pretend you never said it, or do you
want to explain it a bit more carefully? :-)


&gt; HTML does not specify the appearance of the text.

That's the point of it.  It's also true that plain text does not
completely specify the appearance of the text.  For example, it's silent
on issues such as line-width, wrapping, and tabs (both horizontal and
vertical).  More importantly, HTML adds valuable markup which is missing
from plain text.  Quite frankly I do sometimes need to vary my voice,
and asterisks and underlines are inadequate and inferior to the most
basic of HTML facilities.



&gt; Specifically, I get a lot of technical questions.  I expect text to
&gt; be laid out in a reasonable width, about 80 characters wide.  I expect
&gt; log file output to be included exactly as it came from the machine,
&gt; which could be several hundred characters wide.

The two expectations are contradictory; however HTML does support both
requirements.  If you are writing prose you use the basic features
such as &lt;P&gt;, and allow the browser to render the text in the way that
best suits the output medium.  This is HTML's strength and plain text's
weakness.  Debates about 72, 70 or 74 character line lengths are one
the best criticisms of plain text over HTML.

Log files are also catered for in HTML.  That's what &lt;PRE&gt; is about.
Again, the display agent does the best job of rendering that it can.

&gt; To help read it, I use
&gt; a wide screen (120 characters in mutt; with HTML I'd use a full
&gt; screen.  The sender can't know this, and there's no way under
&gt; these circumstances that I can stop HTML from using the full width
&gt; of the screen for the text as well.

It doesn't matter if the browser reformats the non-log text when you
widen your browser window.  Sure you might get "thin" paragraphs, but
presumably you went full-screen because you were looking at the log
extract, not the accompanying text.  By the way, you also get horizontal
scrolling, so you don't really need to go full-screen.
