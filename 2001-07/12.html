I'd written a big long reply late yesterday, but somehow managed to kill
it :-( Here's what I think I wrote.

&gt; That is my point. Thing can behave just as badly under 'unix' as they do

But are more likely to behave badly under Windows. The majority of UNIX
mailers are fairly well behaved.

&gt; Intercept, as in meet mid-way between sender and list server, then do
&gt; whatever it wants with the message, such as notify sender and allow the
&gt; message to continue to the list.

OK, you've invented your own definition. I took mine from the dictionary
:-)

&gt; A quick pass throught something like a perl script takes hardly any time
&gt; at all. Especially if you examine the mime types, identify that there is a
&gt; compund message, remove the html mime sub block and and rebuild remove the
&gt; reference to it.

Again, Why? Just let the poster know and answer their question.

&gt; I am not advocating removal of HTML, but it seems to crash other people's
&gt; browsers and cause them to become nastly etc... It might just be 'a better
&gt; service' to list users. I have personally had no problems with HTML mail.

Crash other browsers? Even the ones which don't render properly in David
Lloyd's mail client seem to be 'replyable'.

&gt; Read above. The stripper would most likely take not much more extra CPU
&gt; than it does for procmail or similar tools. It could even be made a
&gt; resident process so you don't get the process startup overhead.

Why? It's a waste of time. BTW, there is a product called demime which
is used by OpenBSD's mailing lists to remove bits which may be better
than a home-grown script.

&gt; I agree. But I have also done some work that does this sort reading in and
&gt; processing email including slicing of HTML mime and leaving the text. I am
&gt; sure a regular expression or two could convert &lt;XXX&gt; etc.. to nothing or
&gt; [XX] so that a mail client can read the text and not interpret the HTML or
&gt; embeded scripts.

That's not going to work every time. You'll end up with some messages
comming through looking like they've had a bad run in with a savage dog.

Content filtering doesn't work. We all know that.

&gt; But we should start with your suggestions.

Thanks, I think they're a good start.

&gt; They won't know the original message was ever HTML.

Yes they will. Especially when they're completely mangled and barely
readble.
