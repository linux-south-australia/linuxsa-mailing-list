&gt; &gt; I don't have a problem with html email. I prefer text, because it is

&gt; &gt; blue text and a purple background!). But the main reason I havnt said
&gt; &gt; anything in this html debate, is I dont really care, and my mailer
&gt; &gt; handles html fine. I think it is preferable to try an avoid it, but it
&gt; &gt; is no biggie to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, but you use Mozilla, and it shows.  You've left the entire text
&gt; in place, including unsubscribe instructions, and put your reply out
&gt; of sequence with the original messages, which were laid out in the
&gt; opposite sense.  I've done the same this time to illustrate the issue.
&gt; A couple more up and down replies like this and nobody will be able to
&gt; read it.  The chronological sequence of this message is currently 3 4
&gt; 1 2.
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand why you do this: it's painful to use Mozilla as an
&gt; MUA.  But that doesn't make it right.

I do not believe that it is fair to blame the MUA for this, altho some
of
the default Mozilla Mail-News settings do encourage this.

As I see it, good mail etiquette includes:
* including a meaningful subject
* sending mail as plain text
* quoting the relevant portions of the previous message, then adding
  your reply beneath it
* begining your signature with "--" then a new line

This is what I would do to configure Mozilla to default to sending
well written (as perceived by most knowledgeable Unix users) mail:

Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Mail and Newsgroups
MESSAGE DISPLAY
* Use this font when displaying plain text messages: Fixed width font

MESSAGE COMPOSITION
* Forward messages: As Attachment
* Automatically quote the original message when replying.
  Then,: start my reply below the quoted text

SEND FORMAT
* When sending messages in HTML format...:
  Ask me what to do OR Convert the message to plain text
  (according to tase)
* Add "*" to Plain Text Domains
  (not sure if this has the desired effect)

Someone may wish to compile similar instructions for other MUAs,
altho there's probably already something like this somewhere.

On a side note:
Whilst it's just visual candy, Mozilla Mail-News has some nice
features, including graphical smileys, handling quoted text (for
instance replacing the greater than symbols with a neat vertical bar)
and signatures (greying out the signature), treating characters such
as asterisks as mark-up characters (intervening text is displayed in
bold typeface), and some nice replacement features such as 10^3
appearing as 10(superscript)3.

I am now using Mozilla Mail-News as my default mail client, since
it has a good set of base features, and is becoming more stable.
