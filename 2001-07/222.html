&gt; &gt;Is that like saying you'd rather keep the list content relevant to
&gt; &gt;linux/opensource matters?
&gt; 
&gt; Well that is what it's for isn't it...

No its not for that apparently, by charter or by actual usage.

It certainly incldues thsoe things but also includes a much broader
charter.

Which is one of my points.
The other is the only thing that woudl be hurt by implemtning the
suggestion of another list is the status quo.
Another list doesnt need to affect anyones usage or enjoyment(or non
enjoyment) of this list.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You could start another list... maybe one with a more techinal bent and
&gt; &gt;then you could unsubscribe from this one which you dont seem to like in
&gt; &gt;its current form.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Try egroups...
&gt; 
&gt; That is probably the most stupid paragraph of text I have ever read on this 
&gt; list... exactly what do you think this list is for if it's not for technical 
&gt; matters?

Well amongst other things it is for general chit chat, announcments...see
Dale's post or the web site if you wnat to knwo what the list is for.


&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Personally I suspect the rash of unsubscribes today are probably related,
&gt; &gt;so your probably not the only one who hates these endless threads and
&gt; &gt;would prefer a more focussed list.
&gt; 
&gt; So.... have you noticed that most of those that unsubscribed almost never 
&gt; post to this list.. and the only reason that you saw those unsubscribes was 
&gt; because they stuffed up and didn't send the message correctly........

That could be interpreted as  "they were people who were too intimdated to
post" (ie taht may be a reason they did nto post) and "and not interested
in the non techinical stuff" (ie got sick of threads like this)


&gt; What you fail to see Jason is that say someone like Mark does unsubscribe, 
&gt; and say all the tech people unsubscribe, then what becomes of this list... 
&gt; &lt;generalisation&gt; absent minded people that continually fuel constant flame 
&gt; wars and never ever answer any questions or answer very few 
&gt;

It takses two to tango.
All it takes to stop a flame war is for one person to stop responding.

&gt; &lt;/generalisation&gt; After all if all the tech minded people leave who is going 
&gt; to answer the questions, personally I believe that people like Mark are an 
&gt; asset to this list...

I think Mark is an asset to the list.
I think every subsciber is an asset to the list.
Even those I dont agree with.

But the point I was trying to make is Mark was presumably saying he is
sick of this thread, and presuambly other threads like it.

So sick of it he doesnt want it in his inbox anymore.

Presumably those people who did not have the savvy to unsubscribe also got
sick of it.

Which would seem tobe a pretty good indicator that some peopel would
prefer a less general chit caht lsiot nd amore linux/opensource one.

&gt; 
&gt; Having been the receiver of flames before and having been the accidental 
&gt; starter of some flame wars in the past I have had my fair share but what you 
&gt; said in this email is downright STUPID so how about you listen to Mark and 
&gt; SHUT UP AND STOP FUELING THE FIRE.

How 'bout you shut up and stop fuelling the fire?

Why should I be the one to shut up?

Because you disagree with me?  
Well I disagree with you.  
You shut up. 
I wouldnt be replying to you now if you didn't reply to me.  
You can stop this as easily as I can.  
You can take it off list.
Why should you have the last word?
Why should I?
Circular argument.
The thread will die when every one stops responding to it.
You are jsut as guilty of prolongn it as I.

How 'bout instead of demanding me to agree with you or shut up, you
respect(not necesrily agree with) my views and i'll repsect
yours?  
And perhaps each others rights to express opinions. 

Please note I express this as a request not a demand or an order.

If you want me to do something ask me.
Order me and you will get exactly nowhere.

&gt; Oh and while I am at it, either fix your typing skills or remap your 
&gt; keyboard, your spelling is absolutely stupifying sometimes... now how do you 
&gt; like being on the end of a flame... Mark's message was not personal, he sent 
&gt; it as a generalised request... YOU made it personal.

I am often at the end of "flames". Particularly those related to my
typing. I know exactly what it is like.

I wasnt attacking Mark personally, and if I were, or he thought I were I
am sure he'd stand up for himself. 

I was merely using his mail as a vehicle to reinforce the point I was
trying to make.

It seemed particularly apt as his mail seemd to be saying he was
sick of the thread, and the suggestion of a less general more tehcnical
list would make it easier to opt out of the more general discussions such
as this one.
