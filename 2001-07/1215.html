&gt; &gt;I would love to be able to put a linux box out there but it's a bit far
to
&gt; &gt;go to fix it if it breaks.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to state the obvious, but wouldn't you be up the same creek
&gt; in the same barbed wire canoe if it was a Windows box and it broke??
&gt;
Granted, but most people can use windows and it's a bit easier to talk
people through it than with linux.

I am also looking at remote admin for them to remove the need for me to go
anywhere and they already have licences for pcAnywhere which they have paid
good money for and they would still like to have some use for it.

I came across a similar situation in my last job where we had replaced a
Novell server with NT4 and the backup program that the client had bought
specifically for Novell was no longer required, nearly $1000 worth of
software gone because of an OS change. Customers tend to get a little shirty
about those sorts of things.

What I am trying to do here is give the customer what they want for the
smallest outlay possible as they are a community service and don't have a
lot of money to spend.

Damien
