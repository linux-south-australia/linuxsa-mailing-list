&gt; I would love to see a shop that sells only linux computers and harware know

&gt; talk about linux and they will not only know what it is, but they would be
&gt; running it themselves. Let alone knowing that what you see will work and the
&gt; staff will help if it needs a bit of twaeking to make it so.

I have been buying hardware from an Adelaide company called
"Global Link".  They don't have a flashy shop front or anything,
but the guy there, Allen Bolderoff, has a fairly good knowledge
of Linux and what hardware works with it.  I recently bought a
machine from him with Progeny Linux preinstalled --- no
problems so far.  I have found Allen to be quite helpful.  His
prices are not "rock bottom", but they're not too bad --- and
you are getting Linux related service with that.

You  can contact him at <A HREF="mailto:allen@gist.net.au">allen@gist.net.au</A> .

Cheers,

Mark.
