&gt; &gt; IMHO, short-lived patents and copyrights are the solution.
&gt;
&gt; Australia has an "Innovation Patent" that is pretty much this.
&gt; The level of scrutiny is low before an Innovation Patent is
&gt; issued, this is a reflection of the need to keep the filing
&gt; fees low.

I suppose I was suggesting that the fees are kept low, or linked to profits,
and the patents are checked thoroughly but subsidised somehow... maybe
that's a dumb idea though... I don't think there's a silver bullet here...

&gt;
&gt; One unfortunate consequence is that it now costs significantly
&gt; more to oppose such a patent than to register one.  Thus by
&gt; applying for Innovation Patents for software 'innovations'
&gt; companies can effectively gazump a lot of endevour that would
&gt; otherwise be ruled out by prior art or lack of originality.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And IMHO, OS software needs to be respectful of copyrights and
&gt; patents, and
&gt; &gt; attempt to prove the value of the GPL (etc) through real original
&gt; &gt; innovation.
&gt;
&gt; It is difficult to be respectful of software patents when
&gt; so many of them should not have been granted.  What's worse,
&gt; there are cases where prior art exists in free software,
&gt; a patent has been issued to another party, and the free
&gt; software author has been denied access to their original
&gt; work.

true.

&gt;
&gt; Applying patents to software is suss in any case.  Because
&gt; the cost of implementing ideas is low, there is much more
&gt; concurrent discovery in software than in other fields.
&gt; Yet patents award only the person that does the paperwork
&gt; first.

hence they should be much much shorter in software...
