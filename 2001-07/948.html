David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@rebel.net.au">lloy0076@rebel.net.au</A>&gt; said;
&lt;&lt; And yes, I can cite at least one case where Microsoft have thrown a
whole bundle of LICENCED software at a charitable organisation... &gt;&gt;

Ok David. I can back that up with the experience we had with Microsoft 
Australia and others.

We had 10 machines donated to us, P166's, 32 M RAM, 1.2 g drives, 
Windows 95. We wrote nicely to MS Australia asking permission to BUY 
licenses for Office 97 at the academic discount (well we had to ask). 
Under their Community Access Initiative (don't forget that name if you 
want to ask them for help) they responded with a box containing FIVE 
boxed sets of Office 2000 Professional (fully licensed) to do with as 
we wished, sell, raffle, use etc. So although we had to upgrade 5 
machines to 64 Meg minimum we took advantage of their generosity. We 
also thanked them very much and promised to tell people about their 
help.

Symantec came to the party when we asked for help with Licenses for 
Norton AntiVirus. We could not get help with Licenses so they 
compensated us for that with 4 licensed copies of Norton Utilities 
2000. I guess that was how they saw it. We thanked them very much too.

There are a great many businesses out there who are willing to help in 
some way with genuine causes. A nice letter and a clear outline of your 
need is essential as is a proper response should they assist you. The 
way they help is their choice and their sole decision. Never bitch 
about the way the help is given or knocked back, that makes it harder 
for others seeking help.

There are other very big organisations out there who won't do a damn 
thing for you and some of them won't even acknowledge your letter of 
request. Don't be surprised at that as after all it does cost serious 
money and time to process all the requests for help and to account for 
the help given. Donating goods means that GST has to be paid for on the 
value of the goods. That just adds 10% to the cost of being charitable, 
if the company doesn't pay it then the charity has to &lt;sigh&gt;

Volunteering in the community has shown me a whole different picture 
than many folks might see. If you find you have some time on your hands 
share it with your community. The satisfaction that comes from helping 
others is a damn good feeling that you can't get elsewhere.

Cheers,
Ian
