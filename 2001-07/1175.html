Ok. That is your POV. Fair enough.

Yes you picked me up on the generalisation aspect and no I did not want 
to insinuate that all who did the MCP test were cheating or otherwise.

The people I referred to worked in a tutorial-type situation that I and 
a couple of others had set up with network and 2000 laid on. To my 
knowledge only 3 of the people had access to a network outside of the 
tutorial. Remember, the exam was supposedly to evaluate Administration 
level skills in a Windoes 2000 Server environment. There is supposedly 
a pretty serious level of responsibility an skill required to carry out 
that role. 

The person that had only used 3.1 before the course, he studied the 
exam dumps which are freely available. He only had a 95 machine at home 
and he worked through the dumps/cheats/tutes etc on that machine. He 
had no access to any network other than in the tutes that I provided.

I never insinuated cheating. Those are your words.

I said that my personal experience was that a number of people with 
very little in practical skills managed to not just pass an exam but 
pass it well with no percievable change in their skill level. Basically 
they worked through the brain dumps and fed the answers back into the 
machine to gain high scores. To me that says that the evaluation 
methodology is faulty. It was supposed to be able to be completed by 
people who have had around a year's experience as a network 
administrator. Those who actually had some experience tended to do 
worse than those who simply studied up the sheets and fed it back.

Some who had actual practical experience in administering large 
networks failed. Don't talk to me about insinuations and sensible 
words. I am talking factual information gathered by experience. Maybe 
it is a different experience to yours but that does not give the lie to 
what I experienced. 

"did they get experience for the exam on the job?...did you bother 
asking?..."

Did I bother to ask? None of them had a job. None of them had ever had 
a job in IT. I and others helped many of them do their study. I and 
others coached some of them through the rough spots. I helped set up 
machines for them when they had troubles. Yes I knew what level of 
experience they were at. Yes I knew how much they had learned the 
BrainBuzz etc stuff by rote.

Richard,
my suggestion has nothing to do with your comment that "all those
that are prepared to work towards gaining recognised qualifications
are just...assignment swapping...brain-dumping...nerds".

What I am saying is that the experience and work that genuine students 
have put into gaining a qualification that really means something is 
watered down by others who have only learned how to give the right 
answers to the set questions on a screen. The big difference will come 
when these people get into a position on the basis of their MCP.  Then 
their employer will be wondering just how they managed to get their MCP 
with minimal knowledge. What this does is lessen the value of the MCP. 
It tarnishes the expectation of a level, a standard to measure ability 
by. 

This is where the harm is being done to all those who have passed by 
hard work and all those that follow.

"would you say the same for those studying a Linux certification that
uses a similar format for testing?..."

A very good question. I value the exam that has several elements to it. 
If the job requires practical and theoretical knowledge then the exam 
must reflect both those elements. I have researched the MSCE equivalent 
Red Hat exams. They require demonstration of practical knowledge as 
well as knowledge of the theory. This is a far better evaluation for 
accreditation.

If MS were to adopt this standard then their evaluation would tend to 
weed out the 'book-learned' as they would not have built up the 
analytical and practical skills required for the task.

I would be honoured to be able to have the skills and knowledge to pass 
the Red Hat testing. I believe that it would be achieved only after 
hard work and considerable hands-on experience.

Cheers,

Ian
