The point that -I- was trying to make in saying that the shops are not
relevant was that Jason picked the wrong example.

As for your (shouted) question of common courtesy, well, I suppose
that's for the masses to decide.

Perhaps the following facts will be of interest to you:

	* I didn't flame Jason. If I did, you'd know about it.
	* I responded to Jason in a rather blunt and up-front manner.
	  Beating around the bush doesn't help anyone.

The line between "telling it how it is" and "rudeness" seems a little
blured. In the eyes of some, I've been blatently rude and abusive.
However, others would see it differently.

If you're looking for an apology, look elsewhere. There's not available
in this situtation.

&gt; You know like 
&gt; "Do unto others as you have do unto you"
&gt; "Karma - what goes around, comes around"
&gt; "(insert other similar similar quotes here) "
&gt; etc.

Indeed. I'd expect others to do the same to me if they had thought that
I'd been unreasonable or if I'd been talking utter giberish. I'm not
going to be subservient to the ideals of "politeness" for the sake of
it. I'll let you know when I disagree with what you're saying, though.

&gt; Not that I am being religious but this list is here to help
&gt; people not to flame them then when they're not sure how to
&gt; ask the question.

	Just in passing, I'd be very worried if you (or anyone) felt
	they would get themselves flamed for making reference to
	religious material. There's enough problems in the world
	stemming from religious disagreements without feelings of
	contempt towards religion on this list.

Why on earth are so many people (you included, apparently) so sensitive
to a bit of frank, upfront writing? I think a flame would have looked
more like:

"Jason you REPUGNANT GIT! JUST HOW MANY INCHES OF CRAP ARE THERE
SURROUNDING THAT SKULL OF YOURS PREVENTING YOU FROM GETTING THE POINT?!"

I specificaly did NOT write in such a style as that's what I'd call
rude. I do try not to be so, but sometimes that's not enough to satisfy
the somewhat dubious standards held by others.

&gt; Let's all take a chill pill, relaxe a little and try to calm
&gt; down.

I'm still in my seat. I'm quite calm. There was never a situation here
that required hosing-down.

&gt; Just my 2 cents worth.

Whatever...
