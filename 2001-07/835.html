&gt; &gt; I've never had any problems with swat, I find it very good.

&gt; The only problem I have with swat is that it blasts away the comments
&gt; you put in there when hand editing the file.

There was also a security problem found with it a while ago. I'm not
sure if it ever got fixed, but given that it's never really been high on
the list of the samba team's priorities, it's quite likely that it's an
accident waiting to happen. It's interface leaves quite a bit to be
desired (unless it's changed recently). You have to know what each
option is likely to do before you go doing things, in which case, you
would be better off editing the default smb.conf and using the comments
in that for guidelines.

Lars Kneschke was writing something called KSamba (I think that's what
it was called) a while back. I think it was designed to be a KDE-based
replacement for SWAT. Perhaps that is better. His home page should still
be <A HREF="http://www.kneschke.de/projetke/.">http://www.kneschke.de/projetke/.</A>

Hope it helps,
Matt
