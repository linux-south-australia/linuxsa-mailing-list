Hi Alan,

Hmm. You certainly experience more unreliability than most people I come
across. Have you thought about one of those watchdog type systems that
maintains your various services in an 'up' state? I'm sorry I don't know
any examples, but I'm sure there would be some on freshmeat, or you could
roll your own - a script that runs ps against a vital set of components
and restarts them if they are not present.

Regards,

Michael

PS. How is the Skiing in NZ this winter?

&gt; In recent weeks, I reported that BIND 9.1.0 failed in
&gt; the sense of apparently getting corrupted translation
&gt; tables or something:

&gt; 
&gt; While I was in NZ for the last 2 weeks, I tried to read the
&gt; incoming mail from linuxSA and noticed that there were no
&gt; items for over 24 hours. Since this was clearly impossible (!),
&gt; I knew that there must be a software problem somewhere.
&gt; It quickly became clear that my name server daemon (BIND 9.1.0)
&gt; had simply died, with no messages at all in the log files.
&gt; 
&gt; The motto of this story is that even if you spend a couple of weeks
&gt; fixing causes of intermittent failure in your system, you still
&gt; can't assume that you can leave your system unattended for a whole
&gt; 2 weeks while you take a holiday. 
&gt; Consequently, about 16 domains went off the net for a couple of days,
&gt; which must mean that my own name daemon failed for more than
&gt; 2 days, because the secondary name servers would have held out for
&gt; a day or two. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the solution to my problem is to do yet another BIND version
&gt; update and hope that the problem has been fixed.
&gt; After all, that's what happened with some serious ReiserFS bugs in
&gt; kernels 2.4.0 to about 2.4.5, and with some serious iptables bugs
&gt; in kernel 2.4.3.
&gt; 
&gt; My system with the unfortunate BIND 9.1.0 bug is as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; uname -a: Linux dog 2.4.6 #2 Thu Jul 5 03:30:18 CST 2001 i586 unknown
&gt; named -v: BIND 9.1.0
&gt;      cpu: AMD K6/3-500, stepping 12
&gt;      ram: 128 MBytes
&gt;     disk: 30 GBytes, ReiserFS except for /boot (ext2fs)
&gt;   distro: SuSE 7.1
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; By the way, I just heard on 729 kHz AM radio that at 1:00 p.m. today,
&gt; there will be a programme with items on "the ner from the north"
&gt; (Linux Torvalds), some advanced successor to the Internet invented by CERN
&gt; (called the "GRID" apparently) and other such things.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, now I have to download and install/configure the latest
&gt; BIND version.
&gt; See you later,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
