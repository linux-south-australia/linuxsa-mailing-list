kind of.  I've heard that said a lot but when I work out
the total costs, ADSL is a better deal (assuming you use it).

Ignoring install fees, ORHH is $42.90pm incl $5.50 of calls.
So round numbers $20pm (same as a PSTN line - approx).
(And I haven't included call costs in this calculation).

This is working on just using a single 64k B channel.
Plan with ISP, approx $50pm for a "lots of hours but not
permanent" plan and with a bandwidth limit between around
650Mb - 1Gb depending on ISP (according to my recent
investigations!).  So around $70pm assuming you don't go
over your bandwidth limit (and pay extra per Mb), and
this is for not-permanently-on 64k ISDN.

ADSL is $78pm for 3Gb bandwidth (up and down) on the 256/64
plan with telstra (dropping to $73pm after your contract ends).
Or $89pm for 512/128k (dropping to $84pm after contract).
This is a permanently-on (barring outages!!) connection.

So comparing 64k ISDN vs 256/64k ADSL, 1Gb download limit
(assuming generous ISP plan) vs 3Gb up and down limit, 
non-permanent vs permanent, $70pm vs $78pm.  Not much contest!!
Especially if you include call charges for the ORHH,
makes the $ figure pretty much equal.
For ADSL you get a permanent connection, higher bandwidth 
limit, and faster service.

The figures will vary slightly depending on the individual
circumstances, eg. converting a PSTN line to ORHH.
ADSL has a higher install fee unless you go for the long
18 month contract, but for ORHH ISDN you've got to buy a
NetJet card (around $270).  I've also assumed for ADSL that
you preselect the phone line to telstra cos if you don't
the monthly fee shoots up a ridiculous amount.

In short, unless you own an ISP, or can't get ADSL, the
OnRamp Home Highway isn't worth it (unfortunately!).

Dave.
