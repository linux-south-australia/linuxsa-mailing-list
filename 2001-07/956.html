&gt; IMHO, short-lived patents and copyrights are the solution.

Australia has an "Innovation Patent" that is pretty much this.
The level of scrutiny is low before an Innovation Patent is
issued, this is a reflection of the need to keep the filing
fees low.

One unfortunate consequence is that it now costs significantly
more to oppose such a patent than to register one.  Thus by
applying for Innovation Patents for software 'innovations'
companies can effectively gazump a lot of endevour that would
otherwise be ruled out by prior art or lack of originality.

&gt; And IMHO, OS software needs to be respectful of copyrights and patents, and
&gt; attempt to prove the value of the GPL (etc) through real original
&gt; innovation.

It is difficult to be respectful of software patents when
so many of them should not have been granted.  What's worse,
there are cases where prior art exists in free software,
a patent has been issued to another party, and the free
software author has been denied access to their original
work.

Applying patents to software is suss in any case.  Because
the cost of implementing ideas is low, there is much more
concurrent discovery in software than in other fields.
Yet patents award only the person that does the paperwork
first.
