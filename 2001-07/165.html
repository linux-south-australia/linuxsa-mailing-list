One warning about 2.4.6 - I was running 2.4.5, and had it set to drop all
unclean packets that hit the input and forward rules in iptables.
After upgrading to 2.4.6 it seemed to decide that almost everything was
unclean! I'm now running with that rule disabled, but if you were upgrading
the box remotely, you could be in for a nasty surprise.


We signed up for Telstra Cable, btw.. I have to say it was extremely easy to
setup on Linux.. Plug cable modem into ethernet card, edit the config file
for the netcard to say 'use dhcp', and then run bpalogin with the right
username and password.


Does anyone else here on Telstra cable find they get BULK unrelated traffic
hitting their box? I'm dropping it all, of course, but there's multicast
stuff and other wierd things like this:
Eg:
Firewalled packet:IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:00:04:28:22:ec:70:08:00
SRC=10.64.4.1 DST=255.255.255.255 LEN=372 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=255
ID=35010 PROTO=UDP SPT=67 DPT=68 LEN=352
Firewalled packet:IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=01:00:5e:00:00:01:00:04:28:22:ec:70:08:00
SRC=10.64.4.1 DST=224.0.0.1 LEN=28 TOS=0x00 PREC=0xC0 TTL=1 ID=63329 PROTO=2

What worries me is that we're probably paying for this data?
It adds up to a meg or two per day.
Do you think i'll be able to post the log files and accounting data to
telstra at the end of the month and say "we want a refund on this s***!"

(UNLIKELY)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, that's history now.
&gt; I've just built a new linux kernel 2.4.6, and the old
&gt; "untracked packet" problem has mysteriously disappeared,
&gt; as far as my initial tests indicate.
&gt;
&gt; By the way, if anyone wants to use the new kernel,
&gt; beware of some compilation problems with files like
&gt; drivers/mtd/amd_flash.c  line 642
&gt; drivers/mtd/cfi.h        line 387
&gt; (These are relevant to flash memory devices only.)
&gt;
&gt; These both had include-file errors which caused the
&gt; function do_softirq() to not be defined when I compiled the
&gt; kernel on my Toshiba Portégé 3020CT, although the problem
&gt; did not arise on my AMD K6-2/500.
&gt;
&gt; Apart from that, I would say that the 2.4.6 kernel is
&gt; a good idea to compile and use right now, because
&gt; it fixes ReiserFS problems and iptables problems.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, and good compilage,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
