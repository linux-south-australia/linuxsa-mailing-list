Hi again,
    No idea what the difference is. All I know is that there
is a selection of kits available, and that there are Linux
Books available supporting them. My advice is simple - do
some research and let us all know.
    Cheers!
        A.

&gt; I saw a star-wars-related mindstorms kit in a store window
last weekend..
&gt; was only $90 or so i think.. whats the difference between
that and a full
&gt; mindstorms kit?

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;     It sounds to me that what you need is the O'Reilly
book
&gt; &gt; on Linux and Lego Mindstorms. For the cost of a not very
&gt; &gt; cheap Mindstorms set and a book, you should have enough
to
&gt; &gt; get started. There are also some very good books at Dick
&gt; &gt; Smith Electronics on Robots at the moment that include
&gt; &gt; software clips in Visual Basic which should point you in
the
&gt; &gt; right direction, and then all you have to do is port
them to
&gt; &gt; Linux. There are several HOWTOs available also on
&gt; &gt; Mindstorms, and Device Drivers that would come in handy.
If
&gt; &gt; you are already into electronics, I know that there are
&gt; &gt; communication boards that plug into your PC that you
build
&gt; &gt; as a kit that are aimed at just what you want and are
also
&gt; &gt; available at DSE and other places. Pretty much it should
&gt; &gt; cost you about A$250 for a mindstorms kit, a com card
kit,
&gt; &gt; and a couple of books, and then you should have
everything
&gt; &gt; that you need. If you want to do it on the cheap, then I
&gt; &gt; would recommend a book from DSE and an old computer of
some
&gt; &gt; description and some parts and away you go. Hope this
helps.
&gt; &gt;     Cheers!
&gt; &gt;         Andrew.
