cop this from W2K magazine, so much for Microsoft's "enterprise" software!!

No More Than 1000 Users In Cluster? 
This item was contributed by Steve Bink. His web site is at the end. 
"As earlier discussed in Exchange forums, Microsoft is likely going to
advise not to have more then 1000 users connected to a node in an
active/active cluster. This was first mentioned in Win2k magazine's exchange
newsletter by Jerry Cochran. When I read that, I was just finished designing
a 3000 users per node active/active cluster based on MS and Compaq docs. I
never saw anything on this limitation in the Docs. I tried to contact Jerry
Cochran, but he didn't reply. 
So I posted questions in forums and someone contacted me and said it was
true, he was in MS "non disclosure agreement" so couldn't say to much. It
seems that there were concerns in fail-over when using more than 1000 users
a node. He also said when SP1 is released the Docs will be updated with this
new limit advisory. I was disappointed in the Scalability and
"Enterprise"-ness of Exchange 2000 and was still hoping in some way it was a
misunderstanding. I contacted Microsoft Engineers in Holland, they didn't
know anything about this, but when they contacted US engineers I got the
truth: 
The Bug: 
When MAPI clients (Outlook) connect to Exchange 2000 box it fragments the
memory, when a lot MAPI clients do this all memory is claimed. So in an
active/active cluster, when a node fails over to the other active node, the
STORE.EXE fails to start because there is no memory available. 
The workaround: 
*	Use no more then 1000 users per node 
*	Use an active/passive cluster 
*	Manually restart STORE.EXE on the working node, so memory will be
freed and start unfragmented, then fail over. (Yeah right, so much for High
Availability) 
The Fix: 
Maybe in sp1 (small chance it will be released in July) Maybe as pre- sp2
hotfix Maybe never cause the problem is deep in Exchange. More at:
