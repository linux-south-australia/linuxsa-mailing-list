It was a genuine vote in favour of keeping this list the way it is, but
I did phrase it in an amusing (to me) fashion.

I like the way "Grandmas trying to use Linux to send photos to their
grand-kids" sounds. It so horribly, and yet so accurately, depicts the
seething hoardes of normal people breathing just outside those doors.

  "Be4 i culdnt speel linux now my po0ta R wun!"

Ergh! &lt;shudder!&gt; Lock the doors!

If I were to be polite and write in a measured, well-balanced, way
then I could have said:

  "People who wish to use a computer with a very simple interface as they
   have no real desire to know anything about the computer and would be
   resistant to learning anything about it and would not benefit as they'll
   be dead soon anyway."

instead...

But I do enough of that for work documents and emails. Sometimes I just
want to say what I really think in a terribly phrased message - as rough
as possible, piled on with the bait, written to be annoying, and to stir
up people who should know better.

I need a bit of fibre in my output to overcompensate for the hours I spend
puree'ing my writing into ISO9001 acceptable formats.
