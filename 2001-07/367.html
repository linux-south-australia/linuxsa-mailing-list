Hmmm,
but for TCP connections, there is only one process that is involved with the
packets - whoever opened the socket. tcpdump and other sniffers are really a
bit of a hack, and don't accept or make any connections themselves.

The question is, if a user makes an outbound TCP connection (eg. connects to
the http/ftp/irc port on a remote server) and sends and receives traffic
over this link, then will only outward-bound packets match this rule, or
will the received traffic show up as well?


Also,
I'm still at a total loss as to how to account for inward-bound logins.. Eg.
if someone ssh's into the box, sshd is not running as the user who proceeds
to login.

Any thoughts on eitehr?

Thanks

Toby

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; &gt; &gt;    owner
&gt; &gt; &gt; This  module  attempts to match various characteristics of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the packet creator, for locally-generated packets.  It  is
&gt; &gt; &gt; only valid in the OUTPUT chain, and even this some packets
&gt; &gt; &gt; (such as ICMP ping responses) may have no owner, and hence
&gt; &gt; &gt; never match.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note that it's only valid on the output chain though.  I suspect that
&gt; &gt; this means you can only account for outgoing packets - can anyone
&gt; &gt; confirm this?  (I've been planning to test this, but haven't had a
&gt; &gt; chance yet)
&gt;
&gt; The output chain in IPTables is only for locally generated packets as
&gt; opposed to IPChains/IPFWADM where both locally generated packets and
&gt; forwarded packets hit the output chain (ie. anything going to an
&gt; interface).  Therefore when it says "some packets" it is not refering
&gt; to packets passing thru the box (ie being forwared) as they don't hit
&gt; the output chain anyway.  It is referring to those special cases like
&gt; ICMP, as it mentioned.
&gt;
&gt; Interestingly you can't do a similar thing in the input chain as the
&gt; there may be multiple processes listening (think tcpdump).  You could
&gt; list all processes I guess.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Michael
&gt;
&gt; PS. Sorry I didn't pick up on this earlier.  My laptop has been a little
&gt; flakey ..  seg fault here, bus error there :-(
