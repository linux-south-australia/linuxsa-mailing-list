&gt; How?   You're still going to have to maintain some sort of connection
&gt; state, which leads to resource exhaustion which leads to a DoS attack.

Daryl,

The only reason a connection would need to be maintained is because of the
sequence number of the packets.  That was stated near the end of the
paragraph you quoted.  That is one of the 2 main reasons I would rather do
it the second way.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; The easier method would be for TCP to handle ALL initial SYN requests
and
&gt; &gt; then have all passed to syn proxy.  Once all is good then have the
session
&gt; &gt; passed to firewall.
&gt;
&gt; Have you looked into SYN cookies?

Syn cookies is ok but only after 3 or more connections from the same client
is dropped.

A server with a 100 Mbp connection can handle 140,000+ connections per
second.  A standard visitor can produce 14,000 + packets to a server per
second.  With 100's or 1,000's of infected clients you do the math.  Syn
cookies just wont cut it.  The numbers givin above are just approximations.

Thus the need to verify the SYN before a port is opened.  Which can be done
as the second diagram illustrates.  However, you must first catch the SYN as
it leaves TCP and before it hits the firewall.  Otherwise you will have an
open port on a firewall until it times out.  Whereas if you can catch it
before it hits the firewall and verify that the connection is established
you can pass the session to the firewall without losing performance as the
time the port is open without connection and until timeout coupled with the
magnatude of the attack is what kills the server.

Once the attack is underway and the syn proxy sees that it is recieving
constant incomplete syns from client it is added to the bad IP DB and ALL
connections are refused to that client for approx. 24-48 hours (when the DB
is cleared of old IP's) thus dialin IP's are open again inside of 24 hours
for use.

This coupled with the fact that NO ports are open until the SYN is complete
takes a huge load off the system, thus, increasing performance while under
attack.
