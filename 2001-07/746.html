&gt; Who said anything about syncookies dropping a connection?

OK, maybe I read more intent into your statement than was intended -
would you mind clarifying that statement?  What exactly is being
"dropped", or who is doing the dropping?

&gt;&gt; More to the point, why isn't the firewall capable of handling this?

&gt; NO. Read it again. this is not the firewalls responsibility.  This is a TCP
&gt; issue only.

The firewall runs TCP, so it does fall within the baliwick of the
firewall.  Any modern, decent (read: "corporate class") firewall
should be able to cope robustly under such conditions.  If it doesn't,
then I would like the name of it to add to my "Products to avoid at
all costs" list.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, you must first catch the SYN as it leaves TCP and
&gt;&gt;&gt; before it hits the firewall.  Otherwise you will have an
&gt;&gt;&gt; open port on a firewall until it times out.

&gt;&gt; No, the "port doesn't open" until you receive the final ACK back from
&gt;&gt; the client, at least at the application level - this is the point
&gt;&gt; where accept() unblocks (for normal blocking listening sockets) and
&gt;&gt; returns the new file descriptor.  What is most likely happening is
&gt;&gt; that your firewall is maintaining data between SYN (SYN-ACK) and ACK,
&gt;&gt; which is where the DoS is coming in.

&gt; wrong.

Which part is wrong, or is the entire paragraph wrong?  I said the
"port doesn't open at the application level".  I said that your
firewall is maintaining state, which it must be in order to have
"have an open port on a firewall".  Ports don't open until the
three way handshake is complete.  What you have here is the
"half-open" situation.

&gt; read the rfc.

Any in particular, or will 793 do?  And if you are referring to 793,
don't confuse specification with implementation - it merely suggests
how TCP may be implemented, not mandates it.  TCP stacks, in real life,
can and are implemented differently without violating 793 (one of
the funkiest I can remember is Douglas Comer's implementation for
Xinu, which used multiple cooperating user space processes ).

&gt; the port that the connection comes in on is the one
&gt; that is open and awaiting info.

Correct - a _single_ TCB.  One socket in a listening state, one "network
structure".  That in and of itself can not cause a DoS under a SYN flood.
Under "traditional" TCP implementations, when a SYN is received for a
socket that is passively open, another TCB structure is allocated (to
record sequence numbers, connection details etc.) and SYN-ACK is then
sent back.  This allocation of a TCB structure is the resource that gets
consumed in a DoS situation.  SYN cookies circumvents this by doing away
with the need to allocate the TCB to record the details in and encoding
it in the SYN-ACK packet that gets sent back in acknowledgement to the
SYN, thus removing the resource that gets starved in a SYN flood attack.
This does not violate 793 either (well, slightly - because it can't
encode all the attributes, from memory[1] things like certain TCP
options can't be used).

&gt;&gt; Is your firewall and server one and the same?

&gt; could be.  depends on how it's set up.

You stated that you were servicing a "100 MBp connection" - I would
hope that they were separate machines, otherwise you are going to
suffer performance problems when under attack.

&gt;&gt; Cool - so someone could start a forged SYN flood of, say, some large ISP's
&gt;&gt; proxy cache farm, and this software would obligingly block it?  That
&gt;&gt; smells of DoS too.

&gt; How?  DoS is external to internal and unwanted.

I'm talking about _forged_ external DoS.

&gt; Also, the packets from the
&gt; cache farm would be out of sync anyway and not work.  All that would happen
&gt; is a bunch of resets are generated and the IP is eventually blocked as a Bad
&gt; IP.

OK, maybe I didn't spell it out in enough detail.  The large ISP's proxy
cache is external to the resource you're protecting, and the attack
launched from a third IP address (using a forged source IP address,
coincidently matching the cache's IP address) has just successfully
caused the software protecting that resource to block that IP address.
Now no-one from the large ISP is able to connect to the protected
resource, despite being purely incidental to the attack scenario.
Validating the IP source address relies (roughly) on getting ACK back
with the correct details (eg, ACK = SEQ + 1), which can be easy when
used against a TCP stack with predicitable sequence numbers (something
nmap reports on, btw), but as you've already stated that you're blocking
half-open connections, the above attack could work without modification
(with one caveat - if you process RSTs back from the legitimate source
forged IP host, saying WTF to the SYN-ACK's you've been sending it).

     in my posts can append "and likely to be incorrect" without
     affecting the statement in any way.
