&gt; &gt; Why do some people on this list reply to 3+ people as well as the
list 
&gt; &gt; which the people you are replying to are on anyhow?!?!?!

Followed by an excruciatingly aggrovating reply by Greg Lehey:

&gt; Sorry, who are you talking to?  You've managed to strip all 
&gt; context from what appears to be a reply.

Responded in swift fashion by Adam Smith:


That's just anal.

He replied to this thread in a general context directed at no specific
person and therefore had no reason to quote anyone's previous text.
Had this thread been about anything else other than the standards of
email etiquette, nobody would have questioned a message of this type.

This whole thread is anal.  All of it.

&lt;META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="annoying thread, get over it, anal"&gt;


David Newall: I knew, as soon as I read the first message in this thread
that this would happen :-)  It's your fault! :P
