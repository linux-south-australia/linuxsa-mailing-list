a dead end? i have no problems - as such. i have heard about this mdk 8 not
being very ... complete/stable. either way, im a mandrake fan and wont to
give it a go. Is there anyone in the city who has this on cd, which i could
borrow?

-----

just upgrade to mandrake 8 and you'll get the 2.4.x kernel, usb support and
apps, etc. etc. easily. Stick with mandrake, don't go to redhat.

You could just upgrade the kernel + utils manually, but if you've never
compiled something before, it'll probably take you a week of trial and error
before you get anywhere.

2.4 kernels are just simply much better.. 2.2 is a dead end..

&gt; &gt; right now i have my usb mouse (with an adaptor) going into the ps2
&gt; &gt; port.
&gt; &gt; what do i need to do to use USB?
&gt; Why would you want to use a mouse with USB? Sure USB is cool, but i dont
see
&gt; how a mouse can make any use of it, it only needs PS/2. The PS/2 port was
made
&gt; for the mouse/kbd so use it. Sure having a USB scanner with no external
power
&gt; is good, so save the USB port for that!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; i am using Mandrake 7.2 with no modification to the kernel.
&gt; More than likely check if you have 2.2.18 (or did manduckshit 7.2 have a
2.4.xx
&gt; kernel??)
&gt; you will need to RTFM then recomple and RTFM again.
