When will we realise that choosing an operating system or computer
platform is a MARKETING decision, and not a TECHNICAL one?

????

Wake up LINUS.

You're not waging a technical war. You're waging a marketing war.

PROOF:

The masses use a horrid, useless operating system called Windows despite
its defects. They don't sue Microsoft though they would if their house
malfunctioned so seriously; or they would certainly complain if they had
to demolish their house and rebuild it after any minor change (such as
where the front pathway went [for the dolts: changing ip addresses or
routing tables]).

All this crap about G4's being better is besides the point.

I'm a user.

Is it a G4 based system cheaper?

No.

Do I understand any of the OS'es that come with it?

No.

I could understand Linux but I don't know. For sure. I don't know
whether Linux PPC has been ported yet.

Do I understand OS/X or Apple OS 9?

No.

Apples' OSes are unfamiliar to me. In fact, I think the Mac OS
GUI/Windows war is crap. I absolutely fail to see how Apple Ox 8.x or
9.x is intuitive. It takes me about 15 seconds to work out what to do
under it; Unix commandline---1 second at the most.

Can I easily change parts, like the motherboard, upgrade sound?

Yes. But it comes out easily and that's about it.

My point????

PC's might be crap. But I have a choice. And they work for me.

What more can I say?
