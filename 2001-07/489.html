But what has that got to do with mozilla? That was my own bad practice.
Is this better? ;)

Ant

&gt; Yes, but you use Mozilla, and it shows.  You've left the entire text
&gt; in place, including unsubscribe instructions, and put your reply out
&gt; of sequence with the original messages, which were laid out in the
&gt; opposite sense.  I've done the same this time to illustrate the issue.
&gt; A couple more up and down replies like this and nobody will be able to
&gt; read it.  The chronological sequence of this message is currently 3 4
&gt; 1 2.
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand why you do this: it's painful to use Mozilla as an
&gt; MUA.  But that doesn't make it right.

&gt; &gt; I don't have a problem with html email. I prefer text, because it is

&gt; &gt; blue text and a purple background!). But the main reason I havnt said
&gt; &gt; anything in this html debate, is I dont really care, and my mailer
&gt; &gt; handles html fine. I think it is preferable to try an avoid it, but it
&gt; &gt; is no biggie to me.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It's counterproductive because we (most of us) don't want to receive

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Okay.  This rather boils down to, "we don't want to receive HTML mail
&gt; &gt;&gt; but can't give a cogent reason why not."  Personal taste, I suppose,
&gt; &gt;&gt; is a reason nobody can argue with, but it hardly advances a reasoned
&gt; &gt;&gt; debate on the pros and cons of HTML.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It's obvious that I have been rethinking my antipathy towards HTML email,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and that I'm finding it hard to continue to justify it.  Frankly you
&gt; &gt;&gt; pointing out issues such as mailing list trailers, and then saying,
&gt; &gt;&gt; "yes you could fix that easily but doing so would be counter-productive,"
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't really help.  (I don't mean that in a nasty way, you understand.)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
&gt; &gt;&gt; Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
&gt; &gt;&gt; these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
&gt; &gt;&gt; or else switch camps and take me with you.
