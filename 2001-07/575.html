&gt;and there's the first problem, you're now talking more
&gt;$$ than just a NetJet card!  The second problem, or
&gt;consideration at least, is it'll add quite a few more
&gt;$$ still to the call costs.
&gt;

Yes, though I suspect it can also be done just by plugging the phone 
into the ORHH box (which has two analog ports in it) as an 
alternative. Or by making do with 64K, at which point you can 
definitely use the analog port(s) along with a NetJet card as the DoV 
frobbing thingy.

&gt;  &gt; Our effective $ per mb for the first 1500 megs downloaded per month
&gt;  &gt; is about $0.11 per Mb. Almost half the price you've noted above. I
&gt;  &gt; find at my place (and I am a heavy, but non-Mp3 downloading, user)
&gt;  &gt; that I use about 1gb per month - which fits into the 1500 mb plan
&gt;  &gt; that we offer with that effective $ per Mb rate in it.
&gt;
&gt;is this an adsl plan or ORHH/modem one?

ADSL.

&gt;your cheapest adsl is $89pm for 500Mb cap (or $199pm for 1.5Gb)
&gt;your modem plan is $50pm for 1Gb cap but has a session limit
&gt;and you can't redial straight away (as I recall) so that
&gt;bumps up the costs with all the redials.

The session limit is quite high. No there is no limitation on 
immediate redial if you really want to live your life that way.

&gt;  &gt; You either want it bad enough, or you don't. That's the bottom line :)
&gt;
&gt;no I want it all, for nothing, haven't you realised yet!
&gt;But failing that, I'd like a reasonable speed, permanent
&gt;connection and min of 1Gb limit for as little as possible
&gt;(and at the moment telstra is the cheapest at $78pm, more's
&gt;the pity cos I'd really rather not go with them!)
&gt;
&gt;(the other option is stick with dingoblue for $25pm plus line
&gt;rental $20pm for a non-permanent connection (400hrs per month
&gt;so basically average 12 hours per day) with 1.5Gb limit.)

Yep. Its a free country. Feel free to keep hitting up on them if a 
modem is fast enough for your, until they get tired of continuing to 
loose money and drop the cap below 1.5 gb. In the mean time, make 
hay, for sure.
