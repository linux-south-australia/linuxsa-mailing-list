 &gt; I've just got in the _habit_ now of setting up all

 &gt; It just saves me having to think about anything else.
 &gt; At least I get a guaranteed minimum level of access.

The problem is that it also gives a guaranteed minimum level of access
to anyone who can hit CTRL-ALT-F1 while you're running xlock :-)

 &gt; If I get into the _habit_ of using these modern-fangled xdm 
 &gt; things, then I'll have to study how to get rid of it when
 &gt; I need to.
 &gt; Having xdm in inittab obviously makes it more difficult to
 &gt; get rid of than running out of startx.

Not really.  There are two runlevels defined:  multi-user, and 
multiuser + xdm.  If you don't want X, you type "init N" (where
"N" is the number for the runlevel without xdm;  can't remember
what it is, look it up).  If you do want X, you type "init Y" and
xdm will start.

 &gt; On my latest machine (a Toshiba portégé 3020CT), I experimented
 &gt; with xdm, gdm and kdm for start up for a few days, and finally
 &gt; just dumped them all in favour of the getty console.
 &gt; The reason in that case was that the mouse was so awful.
 &gt; Sometimes even the mouse doesn't work at all or I don't have a mouse.
 &gt; And sometimes I don't have the RAM required for using graphics.
 &gt; The plain xdm does not give me the options to use gnome or afterstep

This is not true.  Plain xdm executes a shell script in your home
directory called ".xsession".  If you want gnome, put "gnome-session"
into that script.  If you want kde, put "startkde" into it.  If
you want afterstep, put "afterstep" into it.  If you want to put a
case statement into it which gives you a different environment depending
on some external event, you can do that too.  You can also tell 
xdm to run different .xsession scripts depending on which key is
pressed instead of "ENTER" after you type your password (for example,
typing F1 instead of ENTER after your password will invoke a "safe mode"
session, in case you've broken your .xsession file).

stderr for that script is redirected to ~/.xsession-errors, so if 
it doesn't work have a look at the file to find out why.

 &gt; The "sans mouse" problem can sometimes be solved by the
 &gt; control-shift-numberlock trick. But my latest notebook PC
 &gt; doesn't have the numberlock key!!

If you get mouse problems with xdm, and don't get mouse problems with
startx, something is seriously wrong.  xdm and startx both invoke
/usr/X11R6/bin/X, which is the actual X server which watches for the
mouse.  There really should be no difference whatsoever between the
behaviour of your input devices in the two cases.
