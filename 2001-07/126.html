&gt; Just out of curiosity, does anyone know how to set up
&gt; a private Usenet-news style newsgroup system?

It's just a normal news system with restrictions on who it
feeds its newsgroups to (eg, "none").

&gt; I have often thought about the usefulness of a local
&gt; Usent system. In fact, I'm sure I've seen it in action
&gt; at a previous workplace of mine.

Some people quite often set up gateways between local
NNTP servers and mailing lists.  Public IMAP folders
are another way to achieve the same thing (almost - for
read only it's equivalent, but for sending there are issues).

&gt; A useful application of this could be to linuxSA,

How?  Or Why?

&gt; although
&gt; I wonder if people with non-unix systems would be able
&gt; to access it easily. (I have seen facilities for this in
&gt; Netscape though.)

Netscape and Outlook Express support connecting to
NNTP servers.  Newbies are more likely to use email
than news ("What's a news server?  Where's the news
server?"), however (although from reading Usenet, the
reverse could easily be true).

&gt; without
&gt; losing old posts if you want to go back to them,

_ONLY_ if you don't expire articles, and have the disk
capacity for it.  I grant you that LinuxSA isn't a high
bandwidth mailing list, but that isn't how news servers
are configured by default.

The Cyrus guys have all of their mailing list archived
on a publically accessible IMAP server; I've often
wondered how much use it actually gets.

&gt; and most important of all ---- if someone posts to
&gt; more than one group, then you only get to read it once,
&gt; because the system only sends one copy of each post,
&gt; no matter how many groups it is linked to.

I get that now, mostly, thanks to duplicate message
suppression (I say mostly, because whatever mailing
list software that LinuxSA runs rewrites the message
ID's, which is bloody annoying - it seems to be the
only list that I'm subscribed to that does).

&gt; That would solve many linuxSA "split the group" problems.

Except that newbies are more likely to use email than
news - if you restrict the newsgroups distribution, then
they will only be able to post to one or two servers,
whereas email they can send from anywhere.

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
