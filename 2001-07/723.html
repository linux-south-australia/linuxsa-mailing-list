&gt; Did this, all the open ports were on different pids, and owned by the
&gt; program "rmserver"
&gt; killall rmserver, and all the mysterious open ports dissapear...
&gt; So this a trojan then...?

depends what rmserver is...

`locate rmserver` or `find / -name "rmserver" -ls`

(if locate doens't find it and rmserver does, you may wish to try running
`updatedb`... (note: do all this as root, otherwise you may not be able to
see it even though it is there...)

also try google...

Seems to me that rmserver could be a Real Media Server... sure you didn't
install that -- do and rpm/dpkg query on the specific file you found above,
and if it's not in a package (and you only ever install packages), then it's
likely not to be something you want...

as for how it started, you could check through your rc directories, also
with find (with `-exec grep rmserver {} \;`), through /etc, and specifically
through inetd.conf (or xinetd.conf)

&gt; Short of a complete re-install whats the best way to recover from this?

depends what it really is, and what it does... given that it's already
there, and is unlikely to be doing any more damage than it already has, you
_could_ try running it with strace (man strace) or running it and checking
(using netstat and/or lsof) what else it's really doing, but you'd want to
be pretty enthusiastic to try this... :)
