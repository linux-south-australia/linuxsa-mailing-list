Hi Rob,
You already will have seen the answer on how to get things back into 
order using boot: linux rescue.

This will answer your other question about not having a boot disk and 
how to create one.

In the ReadMe on CD 1 of RH 7.1 is this information:
-----------------&gt;
There are three separate boot images for booting your system; you will 
need one of them to boot your system into the Red Hat installation and 
upgrade process.  For CDROM and hard drive installs, use the boot.img 
file (most Red Hat boxed sets include this floppy already; just boot 
it!). NFS, ftp, and http installations requires the bootnet.img floppy, 
which is available in the images directory. Installs through PCMCIA 
adapters (such as for PCMCIA CDROM or networking cards) need the 
pcmcia.img floppy.

If you did not receive the necessary floppy disks with this product, 
the images for these disks are in the images directory. Either the 
rawrite program in the dosutils directory or 'dd' under any Unix like 
system can be used to transfer the image to physical floppies. Once the 
diskette has been made, insert the boot disk and boot your machine.
&lt;----------------

So, to make a Red Hat Linux floppy boot disk from a Windows system 
(which many will be doing), place a floppy in your drive, it doesn't 
matter if anything is on it, this overwrites the disk, run RAWRITE.exe 
which is in the dosutils directory, pointing it to BOOT.IMG which is in 
the images directory. 
Allowing for my CD to be drive D: (amend this to point to your install 
CD) here is the command line for you.
D:\dosutils\rawrite D:\images\boot.img

I don't have the Debian distro but I guess that it would be similar. 
AFAIK you need to create a boot floppy for each distro, the RH Boot 
floppy wont boot up Mandrake for example.

Hope this helps.
Ian

Subject: lilo
&gt; I have a dual boot system with redhat and windows, and upon 
reinstalling windows - i wrote over lilo and now I cant boot linux, and 
no I dont have a boot disk . Is there any way I can get around this 
small problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I also have a lappy with debian on it, so could i create a boot disk 
on this machine and use it on the other.?
&gt; any help would be appreciated.
&gt; Rob.
