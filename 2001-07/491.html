Sure, but mozilla and other similar MUAs are so hard to use that they
encourage it.

&gt; Is this better? ;)

No, you're still out of sequence, and we now have two copies of your
"PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL" message.  I'll send another reply
reorganized to be the way I would consider correct.

Greg

&gt;&gt; Yes, but you use Mozilla, and it shows.  You've left the entire text
&gt;&gt; in place, including unsubscribe instructions, and put your reply out
&gt;&gt; of sequence with the original messages, which were laid out in the
&gt;&gt; opposite sense.  I've done the same this time to illustrate the issue.
&gt;&gt; A couple more up and down replies like this and nobody will be able to
&gt;&gt; read it.  The chronological sequence of this message is currently 3 4
&gt;&gt; 1 2.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I can understand why you do this: it's painful to use Mozilla as an
&gt;&gt; MUA.  But that doesn't make it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have a problem with html email. I prefer text, because it is
&gt;&gt;&gt; usually more readable, and I dont care about formatting/fonts and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; really hate stupid colours (I just got one html email with black quotes,
&gt;&gt;&gt; blue text and a purple background!). But the main reason I havnt said
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything in this html debate, is I dont really care, and my mailer
&gt;&gt;&gt; handles html fine. I think it is preferable to try an avoid it, but it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is no biggie to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.  This rather boils down to, "we don't want to receive HTML mail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but can't give a cogent reason why not."  Personal taste, I suppose,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is a reason nobody can argue with, but it hardly advances a reasoned
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; debate on the pros and cons of HTML.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's obvious that I have been rethinking my antipathy towards HTML email,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and that I'm finding it hard to continue to justify it.  Frankly you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pointing out issues such as mailing list trailers, and then saying,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "yes you could fix that easily but doing so would be counter-productive,"
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't really help.  (I don't mean that in a nasty way, you understand.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do we hate HTML?  Is it simply because our hair is turning grey?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it because most HTML mailers are made by Microsoft?  Neither of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; these arguments satisfies me.  Come on, help refresh my antagonism,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or else switch camps and take me with you.
