You know, you'd be far better off spending your time just putting a correct
setup on the firewall. Note that there is more to do than just enabling syn
cookies. This suggested firewall's-firewall stinks - tell me when it's setup
and i'm sure some of us will be happy to demonstrate ;)

(perhaps a few spoofed connects from the assorted proxy caches around
australia.. see how many clients can get to your website then?)

With SYN-cookies enabled, and a very wide port range set, a linux box should
be able to deal with a huge number of attempted connections per second,
without using huge amounts of memory for state information, and whilst still
accepting genuine connections.

Do you really think that you can create a better solution to the SYN-flood
attack than the entire world of TCP/IP developers?
Firstly, could you describe what your problem with the existing solutions
is? Whereabouts does it fail to meet your demands?

Consider that you may be better off to improve existing TCP/IP
infrastructure, rather than try to offload part of the tcp/ip system onto a
separate box.. by the way, have you realised that it isn't as trivial to do
this as you think? Even if you do manage to keep the two boxes in sync,
you're going to find that you'll take a nasty performance hit, and mind add
some instability to the systems due to your meddling with the kernel.
(you WON'T be able to do what you want in user-space)

Compare your system, which needs to do a database lookup per packet, to the
kernel syncookies, which just check a few bytes of kernel memory. Which one
is going to have problems under a synflood attack first?

So, you have to weigh up the downsides.. in return for getting what it
basically a similar result to syn cookies (except that can be exploited to
create an even worse DoS), you are getting a permanent increased load, a
permanent increase in network latency, and increased downtime due to bugs.

ie. overall network performance is worse, and if someone does attack you,
you're screwed anyway.

If you spend a lot of time working on it, maybe eventually remove those DB
lookups, debug your kernel hooks and inter-box communication for TCP/IP
state info, etc. then you'll eventually get something which works and
prevents synfloods. But it sounds like it isn't going to be any better than
syncookies already is, and you will never, ever, reach the same level of
performance as you would get with having the tcp/ip stack and server on the
same box.

Is it really worth re-inventing the wheel?

&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I recently asked a question about capturing a SYN packet.
&gt;
&gt; That was actually an incorrect dirscription (almost) of what I want to do.
&gt;
&gt; According to RFC-793: After a SYN-SENT state from client to server the
&gt; server responds with a SYN-RECEIVED event that includes (SEQ, ACK, and CTL)
&gt; and then awaits ESTABLISHMENT from client containing (SEQ, ACK, and CTL).
&gt;
&gt; The thing is I want to be able to Enter wait state and accept ALL
&gt; SYN-SENT(s) to a server from client.  Then I need to do the following:
&gt;
&gt; 1) grab and log origin IP to cache upon SYN-SENT reception.
&gt; 2) Hold SYN packet.
&gt; 3) Transmit SYN-RECEIVED.
&gt; 4) Close connection and Enter wait state.
&gt; 5) If SYN-RECEIVED/ESTABLISHED received from client then match to IP and
&gt; held SYN Packet
&gt; 6) If all is good then pass session to FIREWALL and close connection.
&gt;         else
&gt;                 add IP to bad IP DB (to refuse future connections) drop and
&gt; flush all packet info and close connection.
&gt;
&gt; This would probably all need to be done prior to TCP connection (thus more
&gt; difficult to implement) and could be accomplised in a proxy fashion in that
&gt; once the SYN is complete the proxy could do a SYN to TCP using the original
&gt; packets from client (the only problem here is the sequence numbers need to
&gt; be matched in some way).
&gt;
&gt; In this fashion TCP would be buffered from un-acknowledged SYN(s) (used
&gt; mostly in DOS attacks) and thus speed the function of TCP while reducing
&gt; uncompleted connection attempts.
&gt;
&gt; The easier method would be for TCP to handle ALL initial SYN requests and
&gt; then have all passed to syn proxy.  Once all is good then have the session
&gt; passed to firewall.  This way TCP would not need to be circumvented.  I
&gt; believe this would work better as the initial SYN would be handled by TCP
&gt; thus taking a load off the proxy.
&gt;
&gt; Below is a diagram of what I am looking to do compared to present situation.
&gt;
&gt; Present:
&gt;
&gt;       client
&gt; server/deamon
&gt;
&gt;   1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN/httpd
&gt;
&gt;   2.  SYN-SENT    --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;               --&gt;
&gt; SYN-RECEIVED/httpd
&gt;
&gt;   3.  ESTABLISHED &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;ACK=101&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt;  &lt;--
&gt; SYN-RECEIVED/httpd(open and waiting)
&gt;
&gt;   4.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;       --&gt;
&gt; ESTABLISHED/httpd(open port)
&gt;
&gt;   5.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;&lt;DATA&gt; --&gt;
&gt; ESTABLISHED/httpd(open port)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; with proxy
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;        client
&gt; server/deamon
&gt;
&gt;   1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN/proxy
&gt;
&gt;   2.  SYN-SENT    --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;               --&gt;
&gt; SYN-RECEIVED/proxy
&gt;
&gt;   3.  ESTABLISHED &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;ACK=101&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt;  &lt;--
&gt; SYN-RECEIVED/proxy (no open port)
&gt;
&gt;   4.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;       --&gt;
&gt; ESTABLISHED/proxy-&gt;firewall(open port)
&gt;
&gt;   5.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;&lt;DATA&gt; --&gt;
&gt; ESTABLISHED/firewall(open port)
&gt;
&gt; If you notice in the first diagram the port is open as soon as the SYN-ACK
&gt; (step 3) is sent by the server (start of DOS attack).  If no recieve is sent
&gt; back from client that port is open until it times out.  Multiply this by all
&gt; the infected systems used to attack a server and that is a lot of open ports
&gt; that will swamp a server.
&gt;
&gt; In the second diagram the ports remain free due to the use of the proxy.
&gt; There are NO open ports until the SYN is completed (step 4) and then all
&gt; session info is passed to the firewall using the original session info.
&gt; Thus any ports opened through the firewall a KNOWN good sessions (unless the
&gt; client issues a SYN-RST) and all DOS attempts have the IP logged and the
&gt; session drop and purged.
&gt;
&gt; SO, I have the initial proxy done.  I just need to get it to accept the SYN
&gt; packets and then log or throw away as necessary and then pass the connection
&gt; upon completion of SYN.
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
