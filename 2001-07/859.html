&gt; &gt; yeah... but which is the greater evil? I would assume that
&gt; servers (by their
&gt; &gt; nature as servers) should normally keep better time than
&gt; clients... (present
&gt; &gt; case excluded)...
&gt;
&gt; There's no reason to assume that.  Servers have a heavy disk
&gt; I/O load, so the timer interrupt is subject to more jitter.
&gt; The disks produce heat, so the timer crystal will have more
&gt; wander.

_true_, but they have someone looking after them, and usually tend to have
better quality crystals etc...

&gt; There are essentially two solutions to the `make' issue:
&gt;
&gt;  1. Put all the targets on the same filesystem.  Then the
&gt;     time skew is consistent between files and make works
&gt;     fine as it can decide which file is older than another
&gt;     (it will pump out a warning if the file timestamp is
&gt;     ahead of the current time).

These warnings are annoying, even if there is no actual error... However, I
suppose that really, that just tells you to fix your damn clock (or to tell
the admin to fix theirs)

&gt;  2. Run Network Time Protocol to syncronise all the clocks.
&gt;     This doesn't need to be from a stratum 1 Internet source.
&gt;     Peering a few differnt manufacturer machines and using one
&gt;     of those as a stratum 15 NTP server gives consistent time,
&gt;     which is all that is needed.

true...

&gt; Suggestions like `puting network time into the filesystem'
&gt; go again the UNIX philospohy -- each program should do one
&gt; thing well.  And this allows NTP to run one *all* machines,
&gt; with the benefits of comparable syslog dates, etc.

true... ... ... ...

ok, you've convinced me. Thanks! :)
