Subject: Help for Community Project


&gt; Hi list,
&gt;
&gt; I am the volunteer IT Support for the Salisbury North Neighbourhood
&gt; Network. We are a community group working under the auspices of the
&gt; City of Salisbury. We run a unique program to refurbish computers,
&gt; train volunteers in their use, provide them with a system / MS Office /
&gt; Internet / Printer etc and then allow registered members of the public
&gt; to access the systems in the volunteer's home or in a couple of public
&gt; places such as a Footy Club or Neighbourhood House.
&gt;
&gt; The aim of the Project is to break down the serious digital divide in
&gt; our community. Latest survey shows about 7% of the 12.5K residents in
&gt; our suburb have access to the Internet either through work or at home.
&gt;
&gt; OK, enough background. Up until now we have been working with older
&gt; systems and have had enough copies of the MS 95 OS to install and run
&gt; with. That source of licensed OS's is drying up faster than we can fit
&gt; them to computers so we are looking to use Linux as the OS as well as
&gt; Star Office as the application package. We hope to be able to sell off
&gt; some of the lower spec donated computers to fund the rest of the
&gt; Project.
&gt;
&gt; Our average system is a P166 with usually 64 or 32 M RAM, 1.2 G drive
&gt; and floppy/CD/keyboard/mouse etc. Some of the systems are P133's, a few
&gt; are P100's
&gt;
&gt; So far I have tried Red Hat 7.1 and Mandrake 8.0 with limited success.
&gt; Shortly (once it dl's) I will be trying the Peanut distro to see if
&gt; their claimed 148M space is enough to work the rest in. Fitting the OS
&gt; onto the small space as well as leaving enough room for Star Office is
&gt; the major problem.
&gt;
&gt; The other biggie is that the users are in many cases going to be
&gt; computer illiterate and will need to get basic computer training as
&gt; well as training in Linux and Star Office. We can do that but the
&gt; systems will still need to be stable and dead simple in operation.
&gt;
&gt; Any constructive advice is welcomed and appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; If there are any experienced Linux users in the vicinity of Salisbury
&gt; North reading this your physical help to get this project under way
&gt; would be much appreciated. I can offer free coffee and loads of 'fun'
&gt; with old computers &lt;G&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am also on the lookout for 2nd hand 72pin EDO RAM to fit into these
&gt; machines so they can all have a minimal level of 64M RAM.
&gt;

&gt;  on behalf of the
&gt;  Salisbury North Neighbourhood Network

Ian,

Hello,  I have just recently closed a Computer shop and have some leftover
parts and maybe 1 or 2 licensed win95 distros laying around gathering dust.
If you can cut me a recept for the goods I would be more than happy to
donate.
