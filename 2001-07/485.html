&gt; Also, I dont know how far you'd get without paying any
&gt; money, if you rang up Compaq or IBM or whatever 10
&gt; months down the track and it wasn't a warrantied dead
&gt; piece of hardware you wanted fixed...

Of course, not far. But, by the same token, if a PC was taken to you
with "FIXME" written on it (and it was outside of its warranty), surely
you're going to charge for your time.

&gt; To keep it relevant to Linux, if you installed Linux
&gt; ontoa Compaq I dont know how much help you would get
&gt; from them either if something broke...

That applies to most computer retailers. 

&gt; A bank absolutely needs no downtime. 

And they feel they can get this through purchasing brand-name.

&gt; I was on a job where we had IBM servers, and a disk
&gt; interface failed, and we were in the middle of the
&gt; bush, and we still managed to get replacements inside
&gt; a couple of days, this was pretty impressive given our
&gt; environment, but then these beastys cost $10k+, so you
&gt; get what you pay for.

Exactly.

&gt; I'll take it that your "Sleazy Joes" is not tarring
&gt; all independant computer servicepeople with the same
&gt; brush...

Heh. Not all of the independant computer servicepeople are dodgy. I'm
just saying that there are a lot of undesirables out there.

&gt; Are you contradicting youself here? Or were you in
&gt; shock because the price was so low?

I was in shock as Compaq told me I was going to have to pay $260 for
64MB of standard, SODIM SDRAM. The fact that the RAM had a Compaq
sticker on it apparently increases its value by a couple-hundred
dollars.

&gt; ;-) Who is this "Leader" anyway ?

Leader are probably the biggest wholesaler in South Australia. You buy
from them when you purchase lots of computer goods 'coz it's cheaper :-)
