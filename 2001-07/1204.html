&gt; ...and you're asking this on the LINUX mailling list, why?
&gt; You know it's off-topic, you even politely put [OT] in the topic, but you
&gt; ask anyway, on a list thats generally pretty hostile.
&gt;
&gt; Did you try the pre-requisite google search first, perhaps followed by
some
&gt; posts to windows-user-group lists, beforehand?

(sigh...)

_Generally_ I find this list quite good for finding out this kind of
information as there are usually several people on it that have had the same
experience or they know of someone who has.

I have been looking around for about a week now and I cannot find anything
decent out there so I thought I would put the feelers out to a larger group
of people as several hundred heads are better than one...

Also, the WUG's that I have dealt with in the past seem to be just
auto-responders saying "look at download.com" or "have you tried searching?"
and I would much rather get responses from people that I actually _know_
exist.

I would love to be able to put a linux box out there but it's a bit far to
go to fix it if it breaks.

So, if anyone has any constructive comments or can help me out it would be
much appreciated.

Damien
