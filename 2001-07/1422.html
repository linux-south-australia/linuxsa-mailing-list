&gt; Hey Group. Im Looking for some info to do with Wireless Lan Cards reaching a
&gt; distance of about 3.7kms and more for linux.
&gt; I am wanting to use this for admining my box @ Morphett Vale.
&gt; 
&gt; What would you's recommend for such a situation.
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I would like it to be wireless .

Hi, it should be easy to set up, but there are other issues that nobody
has mentioned. The cards use the public 2.4gz range, so its shared
bandwidth. There are also power/output limitations, and you wouldnt want
to breach these and then knock out someone else's network and get busted
by the ACA. I was checking this out on the wireless list, and got some
answers. Note that I was talking power amps, and havnt done the maths
for low power with large DB, but heres the info:

Ant:
&gt;&gt; I have just been talking to a HAM which I know about wireless 
&gt;&gt; and using
&gt;&gt; power amps to extend range. He seems to think that the use of 
&gt;&gt; poweramps
&gt;&gt; (like the 250mw and 400mw that some company who recently advertised on
&gt;&gt; this list have) are illegal to use in Australia. 

Tony Langdon:
&gt; If the power amps are designed for wireless service and are type approved,
&gt; they are legal... BUT, only as long as the total effected radiated power
&gt; (EIRP) is less than 4 watts.  So, if you have a 24dBi dish fed from one of
&gt; these amps, you're well into illegal territory, but if instead, you're
&gt; feeding a 10dBi omnidirectional, a 400mW amp would put you at maximum legal
&gt; power.

Then he explained how to calculate it:

&gt; EIRP (dBW) = Tx power (dBW) + antenna gain (dBi) - coax losses (dB)
&gt; Simple as that


&gt; So, if you have a 1 watt transmitter into a 20dBi gain antenna and 3dB of
&gt; antenna loss, then the EIRP is...

&gt; 0 + 20 - 3, = 17 dBW, or 50W.
&gt; FYP, 4W = +6 dBW, to save having to convert back to linear values.

&gt; Also, if antenna gain happens to be expressed in dBd, add 2.14 to get dBi
&gt; (doubt you'll see this, but it can happen).
