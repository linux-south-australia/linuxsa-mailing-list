Hi - its been quite some time since I've been on this great list. I
unsubscribed ages ago when I shelved Linux for a while because I had far too
much else to do but on the weekend I built a PC from parts I had lying
around and loaded Linux - my first solely Linux box :-)

I used an old 1.2GB drive I had in my first 486, back in the days when the
BIOS wouldn't recognise more than about 528MB so the drive came with EZDrive
(also went by the name of OnTrack Manager in later releases and I think
Western Digital had aversion as well) from Micro House to manipulate the MBR
and BIOS to think it was something else. 

EZDrive was a program that provides software logical-block addressing (LBA)
support for systems having BIOSs that do not support LBA. The trouble is
that Linux doesn't like this (which I confirmed from a SUSE list) and
EZDrive, parts of which still reside in the MBR falls over on it (wrong OS
it says) because I think its expecting to see DOS or WIN 3.x or NT or one of
those types of OS's. But after all these years I can't locate my EZDrive
disk which would allow me to eradicate EZDrive. Micro House have since gone
by the way side and you can buy EZDrive but I figured I'd try some other
options first. 

One suggestion is to boot the machine in DOS and issue an FDISK /MBR to
re-write the MBR. 

Has anyone had any exposure to this problem? Will the above measure cure it?

TIA?
