&gt; It can still feels like an obligation. It should read "If at all possible

&gt; beter for email than the Windows version?

OK, I'll work on that paragraph to make it sound a little less
obligitory. Netscape was listed in the document as one of the mailers
that will behave badly if not properly setup. The fact that it was
compiled for UNIX is neither here nor there.

&gt; It is the solution. The server intercepts the email detects HTML embeded
&gt; messages. Lets it onto the list. And sends the sender a reminder about
&gt; HTML. I would rather that, than install a new mailer, and during a busy
&gt; day forget to set to plain text or have a network policy or profile reset
&gt; my choices, to then mail to LinuxSA and get a mouthfull directed at me
&gt; (and the list aas well).

OK, you've changed your tone a bit. I got the impression from your last
post that we should "For example intercepting HTML".

The dictionary.com definition of intercepting:

	tr.v. in·ter·cept·ed, in·ter·cept·ing, in·ter·cepts

	"To stop, deflect, or interrupt the progress or intended course
	 of: intercepted me with a message as I was leaving."

&gt; You assumed that the server side just blocked HTML etc... I never implied
&gt; that. The many times I have made suggestions on this list regarding HTML
&gt; 'filtering' on a mailing list server I have indicated that the messages
&gt; gets through (as is, or stripped of HTML).

Indeed I did. You did imply that by your use of the word "intercepting".
I have to say that I've not seen your other posts when you "...have
incidcated that the messages gets through...".

Now, stripping the message of HTML would be a bit of a pain in the neck,
so why not just let it through and let someone tell them when they
answer the question.

There's not that much traffic on LinuxSA, but I'm sure a HTML stripper
would take up unnecessary amounts of CPU time. Just let it through. The
document "How to get best results from LinuxSA" explains how one should
go about letting "offenders" know about their "crime".

Perhaps, as an example, the responder would write something like this:

	&gt; Posters HTML message here.

	Your message was sent in HTML. LinuxSA does not appreciate the
	use of HTML email. Please use plain text. See 
	<A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html</A> for more information.

	[ Question answered here ]

&gt; And that simple change would solve a lot.

Possibly. It'd take less effort to use the method detailed above.

&gt; You need to both communicate the 'policy' and 'ways to meet the policy',
&gt; and if you can have a machine do the work for you in a positive way that
&gt; doesn't interfere, to meet this policy, then it makes things easier for
&gt; everyone.

The method detailed above does both those things. Whatsmore, it gets the
question answered in one simple message.

Filtering/stripping HTML mail before it hits the list is unnecessary.
