&gt; &gt; ISDN still has a few things going for it, you get a second phone line, that

&gt; yes but you get a phone line with adsl that is available for normal calls
&gt; all the time too.  In both cases the extra line rental for this
&gt; voice line wasn't included in my comparison (on the basis that you'd
&gt; have a voice line anyway).

Trivial point, but you can do a lot more with a single ISDN line than
you can with a normal analogue line. The signalling system can let you
know who's calling and what number they dialled even if you're currently
on the phone and tying up both channels. Because it's all digital, it's
a lot easier for a Computer or VoIP gateway to deal with.

&gt; &gt; You also don't have to end up with a soul-destroying contract and you can
&gt; &gt; still have a choice of ISP's to dial.
&gt; 
&gt; true, you can choose a 3 month contract though even with the higher
&gt; install fee (by the time you include and ORHH install and buying
&gt; a NetJet card it's about the same as the ORHH startup costs).

If you order an ORHH through a Telstra dealer instead of Telstra,
they're often in a position to give you a better price than Telstra
would.

&gt; &gt;Having Telstra ADSL on a line now may
&gt; &gt; make it difficult to use a different providers DSL offering in the future
&gt; &gt; once the market becomes competitive.
&gt; 
&gt; really? how? like any service on the line, you cancel, stop paying
&gt; for it, the carrier removes the service, I would've thought.

The copper is still patched into their DSLAM at some point. If the
service is in dispute, or an ADSL supplier that doesn't use Telstra
wholesale wants to give you a service, there may be months of delays in
decommissioning the line and filing the relevant paperwork. It's taken
10 years to get mobile phone numbers portable..

&gt; &gt;If your ISP goes down with ORHH (which
&gt; &gt; is much less likely than with ADSL right now) you can dial another one. If
&gt; &gt; you go away for a month, Telstra will still charge you for the month of ADSL
&gt; &gt; use .. a local ISP probably wouldn't.
&gt; 
&gt; true

Even local ISP's that offer ADSL will need to charge for the time you're
away, because of their contractual obligations to Telstra for the line
you're using.
 
&gt; true, but you're talking more business use, for home use a dynamic
&gt; ip running a web/mail server works fine (eg. www.dyndns.org works
&gt; great for me).

If you go with Telstra ADSL, your contract does not permit you to run
servers.

&gt; true but there are some disadvantages, eg. you can't have some of the
&gt; "easycall" type functions on ISDN, 

Because the ISDN signalling moves some of the exchange function into
your home, it's not really practical to have ALL of the easycall
options, like messagebank. This is unfortunate. A netjet card in a linux
box can emulate the missing functionality.

&gt; it's not a "normal" basic phone
&gt; service (under the SFOA, ACA rules etc) so telstra can change the
&gt; price, rules, etc anytime and you're back to square one.  

The ACA are aware of this and are keeping an eye on it.

&gt; And if the
&gt; ORHH box requires mains power (does it? most ISDN I've seen does,
&gt; except for some onramp2's?) then it's out during a power failure
&gt; whereas your old PSTN line will still work (not such an issue these
&gt; days when nearly everyone has mobiles anyway I guess).

What BRI ISDN have you seen that requires mains power?
The home highway box comes with a power supply that the technician will
plug in. You can unplug it, roll up the cable and put it back in the
box, and it will continue to work. It's meant to provide power for
additional extensions on the analogue ports, but I have 4 extensions
that work fine without it. If it doesn't work without power, there may
be something wrong at the Telstra exchange (it's happened to a few of
them). 

&gt; I wish ORHH was a better deal than adsl but no matter how I look at
&gt; it I keep coming to the conclusion that adsl is the better deal.

Then go for it. Enjoy the outages :)
