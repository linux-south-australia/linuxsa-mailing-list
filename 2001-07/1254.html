&gt;The interface has become so difficult to use that working out how to
&gt;send text messages is just too much for these poor people who only using
&gt;command lines. In fact, it's so difficult that it took me 5 minutes to
&gt;work out that there doesn't appear to be a way to stop one's self from
&gt;sending HTML e-mail.

Ahhhh, try this...



&gt;
&gt;2) Microsoft Patronage
&gt;
&gt;You are excused, also, because you are supporting the MSN by viewing the
&gt;banner ads and other garbage that comes with using
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com/.">http://www.hotmail.com/.</A> We know how much you support Microsoft and that
&gt;this really is the Microsoft Users Group [TM] in disguise.
&gt;
&gt;3) Past History
&gt;
&gt;You seem to enjoy talking about Telstra and ADSL. Given that we are the
&gt;"bash Telstra, decry Microsoft and talk about HTML e-mail" Linux Users
&gt;Group in SA formed solely for the purpose of supporting Microsoft Based
&gt;VPNS (MBVPNS [TM]) this is perfectly acceptable behaviour.


Yes and your point is.......

&gt;
&gt;;-p
&gt;
&gt;DSL
&gt;
&gt;PS:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems that Telstra are using a bit of everything, some of their
&gt; &gt; servers are running Netscape Enterprise, others IIS, and most of TI
&gt; &gt; (BPD) is using FreeBSD and Linux with Apache believe it or not... I am
&gt; &gt; talking purely webservers here, looking through netcraft.com...
&gt;
&gt;Oooerrr...they use various different operating systems.
&gt;
&gt;That has me so excited that my pants would be on fire if I hadn't pissed
&gt;myself with unfulfilled, random abandon at about the same time.


and what are we going to call you now..... the LinuxSA Jester!!!!

Well now, it appears that Mr. Lloyd has decided to become rather comical 
lately hasn't he. Nothing like a little comic relief to this rather highly 
strung list!!!! he he he!!!! :)
