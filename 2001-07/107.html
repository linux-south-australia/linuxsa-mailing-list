This is about as far as I got before my eyes glazed over, so I'll try
to add some useful comments.

&gt;&gt; It can still feels like an obligation. It should read "If at all possible
&gt;&gt; use a recommended email client (such as...)". Just because it is a unix
&gt;&gt; email client does not make it perfect. There is a slightly higher chance
&gt;&gt; of it playing nicely if it is a unix client. Is netscape under a unix
&gt;&gt; beter for email than the Windows version?
&gt;
&gt; OK, I'll work on that paragraph to make it sound a little less
&gt; obligitory. Netscape was listed in the document as one of the mailers
&gt; that will behave badly if not properly setup. The fact that it was
&gt; compiled for UNIX is neither here nor there.

In fact, I think that Netscrape for UNIX is even buggier than
Netscrape for Microsoft.  Yes, we should probably be more specific
about what constitutes an acceptable MUA.  

&gt;&gt; It is the solution. The server intercepts the email detects HTML
&gt;&gt; embeded messages. Lets it onto the list. And sends the sender a
&gt;&gt; reminder about HTML. I would rather that, than install a new
&gt;&gt; mailer, and during a busy day forget to set to plain text or have a
&gt;&gt; network policy or profile reset my choices, to then mail to LinuxSA
&gt;&gt; and get a mouthfull directed at me (and the list aas well).

Well, no, the list shouldn't get it.  In fact, nobody should get it.
But the scenario you describe is exactly what we want to help people
avoid.  You shouldn't be using MUAs which do things behind your back.

&gt;&gt; You assumed that the server side just blocked HTML etc... I never implied
&gt;&gt; that. The many times I have made suggestions on this list regarding HTML
&gt;&gt; 'filtering' on a mailing list server I have indicated that the messages
&gt;&gt; gets through (as is, or stripped of HTML).
&gt;
&gt; Indeed I did. You did imply that by your use of the word "intercepting".
&gt; I have to say that I've not seen your other posts when you "...have
&gt; incidcated that the messages gets through...".
&gt;
&gt; Now, stripping the message of HTML would be a bit of a pain in the neck,
&gt; so why not just let it through and let someone tell them when they
&gt; answer the question.
&gt;
&gt; There's not that much traffic on LinuxSA, but I'm sure a HTML stripper
&gt; would take up unnecessary amounts of CPU time. Just let it through. The
&gt; document "How to get best results from LinuxSA" explains how one should
&gt; go about letting "offenders" know about their "crime".
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps, as an example, the responder would write something like this:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Posters HTML message here.
&gt;
&gt; 	Your message was sent in HTML. LinuxSA does not appreciate the
&gt; 	use of HTML email. Please use plain text. See
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html</A> for more information.

s/does not appreciate/discourages/

The real issue is, most people who send mail in HTML won't understand
this message.  "Huh?  What's HTML?  What have these blokes been
smoking?".  And what do we do with multipart/alternative?

We've discussed filtering HTML on the FreeBSD mailing list.  The
biggest issue we have is that messages like this get lost:

&gt; LinuxSA WWW: <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/</A>  IRC: #linuxsa on irc.linux.org.au
&gt; To unsubscribe from the LinuxSA list:
&gt;   mail <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au</A> with "unsubscribe" as the subject

As a result, these are the idiots who also send unsubscribe messages
to the list.  We've finally given in on this issue: we now process
empty messages with the subject "unsubscribe" as the sender presumably
intended.
