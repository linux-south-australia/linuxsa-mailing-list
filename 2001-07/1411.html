&gt; Hi Brian,

&gt; &lt;&lt;
&gt; WHY are you bothering with M$?  Linux or FreeBSD will do
&gt; all that WinDOZE will do, and much much more - FREE!
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I wish that was the case 

It IS the case!

&gt; but we are having all sorts of bother getting 
&gt; enough of a system on the 1.2 Gig drive and still have enough room to 
&gt; run Star Office.

I know SO is demanding of resources - so don't use it if it wants more
room than you can spare.

&gt; While it would be nice to think that Linux is the standard out there it 
&gt; isn't and isn't going to be for some time. The community standard is 
&gt; Microsoft and so putting a machine out into the community requires it 
&gt; to be either Microsoft or as close as we can so that Microsoft files 
&gt; can still be used on it.

So you accept the standard of the LOWEST common denominator (because it
is common?).  Sorry, I don't understand the logic.

&gt; We are trying to help the community gain computer skills. 

Then give them the richest experience you can, not the most
impoverished.


&gt; There isn't 
&gt; any point in selling people a system that is not compatible with the 
&gt; majority of other computers out there. 
&gt; Star Office is the key to providing a level of compatibility. 

Not so.   Abiword reads .doc files and will write .rtf files.  Gnumeric
reads/writes .xls files.  Netscape will read HTML mail if that is what
you want.  Graphics editors are .....   but you aren't listening, are
you?

&gt; Please tell me if you know of something that can do all that Star 
&gt; Office does for only the cost of a CD and I will check it out.

Sorry, I don't do Star Office.

&gt; Brian, I have been into computers since '68. I can tolerate the 
&gt; differences, the frustrations, the difficulties that come with a Linux 
&gt; system. I can learn and I can get much better using and tweaking the 
&gt; Linux system. This is fun to me and I am enjoying the challlenge.
 
&gt; The people that we provide these computers to are either newbies to 
&gt; computing or else still trying to understand about a file and a 
&gt; directory. Linux for them would have to be a stable system running as 
&gt; close to the Windows look and feel as we can get it simply so they can 
&gt; work on it from that point.

For goodness sake!  Have you not used Linux since RedHat 5.2 or earlier?
Like many others I use the Gnome GUI/Redhat 6.2.  I can't think of
anything simpler to operate.  Double-click on a .wav file in the File
manager and the music plays!  Insert a CD and it either commences
playing (audio) or a file manager is automatically invoked to show
you the CD contents (data).  Can you think of anything less daunting?

Look.  How about you bring one of  your machines to the Installfest on
26th August at Magill Campus of UniSA and have one of us install Linux
or FreeBSD for you?
