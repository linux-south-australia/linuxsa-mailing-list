&gt;&gt; Reply-To  munging,  I  can still reply to the author of the message by
&gt;&gt; doing a reply-all and removing the list address - which I admit is not

&gt; Not necessarily - if the original Reply-To header is different from
&gt; the From header then you will send it to the wrong place.

But  let's  face  it,  although  a  common  occurance in the past, the
number  of  people  who  find  themselves  in  situations  where their
reply-to  is  different  from  their From field is somewhat small, and
generally,  not  that  much  of  an  issue  on a mailing list (where I
maintain  that  the  majority  of  traffic  is  for  the list, if it's
necessary  to  mail offlist, ask the person onlist to mail you offlist
to continue the discussion  -- that did too make sense :P~~~ ) *grin*

&gt;&gt; &gt; Some  mailing  lists  (like  the debian ones) have a policy of users
&gt;&gt; &gt; only cc'ing the sender if they explicitly ask for it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So isn't this somewhat similar to Reply-To munging?

&gt; No, because the original reply-to field is preserved meaning
&gt; that if someone wants to reply directly (and only to) the original
&gt; author they can.

Fair enough.
