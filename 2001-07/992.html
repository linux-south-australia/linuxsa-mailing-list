Hi,

&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; Slightly off topic, but I was just chatting to a Gateway sales droid
&gt; about buying a laptop without an OS or that Works garbage on it.(to
&gt; put linux on it of course)
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing said was about a bunding contract with microsoft, at
&gt; which I grumbled. So he then mumbled something about it being *illegal*
&gt; to sell a computer without an operating system! Then I got a story
&gt; about him knowing someone (a friend?) who got done for it inadvertently.
&gt; The urban legend bells started ringing then.
&gt; 
&gt; Does any of this ring true in the real world? Are naked PCs really
&gt; illegal? 


No, it is not illegal to sell PCs without an OS. I buy them all the time.

 &gt; Or are they just trying to cover their arses w/o looking too
 &gt; bad.

They have probably signed an agreement with MS that commits them to 
selling a copy of MS Windows of some sort with every machine they sell. 
Don't buy their shit if you don't like the terms. Vote with your feet.

As far as LapTops are concerned, you will probably have to give up on a 
brand-name if you want it sans OS. Perhaps you should buy an Acer or 
other lesser known brand of LapTop. They look to be just as good.


&gt; Not that I've looked, but I'm sure the EULAs have changed since the 
&gt; episode with Geoffrey.


Frankly, EULA's have nothing to do with it.


&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Craig
