Hi Ian,

No it wasn't us and I have not heard of it before.

Most of our licenses were used on systems for a corporate body, the 
books and disks were still in their shrink wrap. Therefore I guess we 
could not be classed as the original licensee. I am assuming that it 
would be on the basis of not being 'authorised' to sell Windows that MS 
would be basing their claim on.

Just another good reason why Computer Bank provide only Linux on the 
systems they sell and why we are now considering doing the same with 
any of our machines we might sell. Perhaps I should clarify that 
selling off older computers is something we are still investigating as 
a way of improving the computer skills in our community. For those that 
gained the impression we were the same as Computer Bank perhaps that 
might be one area where we are different &lt;G&gt;

Ian,
I am still trying to work out which distro gives us the best results 
for ease of installation, minimal space consumption and simplicity for 
the newbie to computing. Perhaps you have some idea you might wish to 
offer us.

Of course if your company wants to help a local group we would be very 
open to receiving older computers or other support.

Cheers,

 Ian Loxton,
 on behalf of the, 
 Salisbury North Neighbourhood Network,

&gt; Hi Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; I heard half a news item on ABC radio Sunday morning about microsoft
&gt; threatening an Australian
&gt; charity about refurbishing old pc's and re-installing windows.  
&gt; Apparentlyms think that a new copy of
&gt; windows should be purchased for each pc (even though undoubtedly a 
&gt; licensewas purchased with 
&gt; the pc when new)
&gt; 
&gt; Was this you guys, or do you know who the charity concerned is?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Ian Graham
