Actually, Mandrake comes with all those groups pre-configured.. If you want
to let your housemate use the cdburner, just add him to the cdburner group.
If you want to let someone use sound, add them to the sound group.

But, point taken, yes, you could develop some new problems for some people..
but I'd say people who are worried about the vty-switching-and-ctrl-z-ing
are probably people who are able to deal with those.

&gt; &gt; Perhaps, like me, he likes to be able to use CDROMs, sound, etc.

&gt;
&gt; Fair enough. I will retract my statement and replace it with...
&gt;
&gt; "...or until you want to use sound, cdroms, floppy etc, then you'll
&gt; have to run programmes as root! (Unless of course you have manually
&gt; adjusted the permissions, or your console.perms configuration, or...)"
&gt;
&gt; The reason I even made the comment was to highlight the fact that
&gt; although there are two different solutions to the same problem, one of
&gt; them has less chance of creating new problems.
&gt;
&gt; That was my point. Apologies if it was not clear.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
