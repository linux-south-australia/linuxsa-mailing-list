David,

I wasn't replying to the question as it is not going anywhere.  I never
claimed to have all the answers either.  All I am wanting to do is start to
get this going.  There will be answers out there for the problem.  However,
it is just like any other problem.  You have to find the answers first.  I'm
a programmer that likes Linux and would like to help is all.

I know it can be done, and be done better than using the syncookies.  My
problem is that I am not a total expert as far as Linux goes.  However,  I
am sure that there are some experts out there that are more than willing to
not just criticize an idea but contribute possible solutions as well.

As I stated in the last response. Thanks anyway.

chuck

&gt; &gt; OK, no sense argueing this with you guys as you are not willing to help.
&gt;
&gt; That's how you rebutt the claim that forged source addresses could deny
&gt; you access to third parties is it?  "No sense argueing [sic]" and "not
&gt; willing to help."  Chucky, you have to understand that when people think
&gt; about your idea, and say, "hey, what about this?" they are trying to help.
&gt; You can lead a Norse to water but you can't make him sink.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck, and better not let anybody know which sites are "protected"
&gt; using your idea; there are only a few root DNS server addresses to spoof
&gt; before your sites DOS themself off the net.
&gt;
&gt; Do you get it yet?
