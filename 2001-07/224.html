Mark,
My understanding for different lists under the LinuxSA banner is so that
you can have people under the same banner and same user group who go to
the same meetings belong to that group and at the same time have areas of
different focus. Someone could create a new list elsewhere, but then it
would not be directly related to LinuxSA. It seems that this has not been
clearly expressed by others. I will see what the LinuxSA site mainainers
think.

I do not see that as an unreasonable request. Especially if there is
demand for it. The LinuxSA pages would list these. The list we currently
use now would be the main one. If there is no demand, then the other lists 
will not be used, the list maintainers would not have expended much effort
to add the lists in the first place, and you can say "I told you so".

I see multiple factions using the one list, those who want to spread the
use of Linux and help people, and those who want to sit on the list and
talk shop in very unix/engineer cultured kind way.

Given the room for things to grown, things can develop and people can
choose for themselves.

Is that unreasonable?

Dale.
