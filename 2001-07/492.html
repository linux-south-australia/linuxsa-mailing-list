&gt; 1) uptime (I assume cisco are better here, but that's mainly due to the
&gt; nature of PC hardware)

They are roughly similar for the same engineering.  A PC
with a flash memory disk will have about the same uptime
as a 2500.  The Cisco 7200 router uses PCMCIA disk and
you need to run mirroring if the contents of the disk matter
to you.

The Cisco image is statically-linked, so it will keep running
if the filesystems underneath come and go.  Linux spits the
dummy badly if root or swap go AWOL.

&gt; 2) support

Depends.  You can't change the Cisco code yourself, so
if the bug doesn't matter to Cisco you can be waiting
a long time.

Having said that, Cisco's support is the best in the
industry and puts other large suppliers to shame.
Some smaller suppliers have better support (eg Juniper,
Barr Systems) but this is most probably a benefit
from their smaller size.

&gt; 3) speed (which wouldn't be an issue in this case)

Speeds are roughly the same for the same hardware.

The trick to watch here is the use of static RAM for
packet buffering on some Cisco routers.  This makes
them significantly faster than a PC with a much
higher clocked CPU.  If it matters to you, you can get
static RAM for PCs that can be accessed down the
AGP bus -- Linux supports this as part of the NUMA
memory support.

The 7500 series can have cards that run routing
code on the card.  These communiticate down a PCI bus,
so performance is roughly equivalent to using
network interface cards that contain network processors.
Support is an issue here, as the network processor
code is new and generally written by hardware suppliers
like Intel.

The Cisco GSR uses a cross-bar switch rather than a
bus.  There is no equivalent PC technology.

&gt; 4) security perhaps (I have seen more Linux compromises
&gt; than Cisco, but that could be because I spend more time
&gt; with Linux)

About the same.  Both are written in C and both are
plagued by buffer overruns.  Being statically-linked
the Cisco code is more difficult to wrap.

&gt; Availability of more obscure interfaces, like high-speed serial and E1.

Synchronous serial interfaces such as E1 are well supported
by Linux.  Channelised E1 isn't, a hardware availability
issue.

Some interfaces you might think of as obscure, such
as 1.2Gbps Packet over SONET/SDH actually have excellent
Linux support.

The obscure interfaces argument runs both ways.  Generally
the Cisco routers support more long-haul obscure interfaces
and Linux support more short-haul obscure interfaces.

WHat Cisco does have all over Linux is excellent
obscure software features.  You don't know how much
you need these until you do.  The Linux solution is
usually to patch the kernel and recompile.  This
makes kernel upgrades a nightmare.  My PC runs

  linux
  MPLS patches
  VLAN patches
  IP/USB patches
  NetFlow patches
  WCCP patches

Arrgh!

&gt; Consistent interface across versions and platforms.

Linux is consistent.  The Cisco advantage is really having
all of the configuration in one file.  It *is* a big advantage,
as you can see by Juniper using FreeBSD but altering the
user interface to present the router config as a single file.

&gt; Packet switching software (faster, packets don't need to be checked
&gt; against the routing table).

All forwarded packets need to be checked against a forwarding
table.  Except in the GSR and some combined switch/routers
Cisco has no specialised hardware to do a forwarding table
lookup.

Only in the Cisco 7500 with VIP2 or VIP4 interface cards
running Distributed Cisco Express Forwarding is the forwarding
decision made by the interface CPU rather than the main CPU.
dCEF isn't exactly stable code yet.

&gt; Traffic accounting, ie: netflow. (I think Netramet does something
&gt; similar on linux, but havn't tried it)

Linux uses BSD traffic accounting.  This isn't as good as NetFlow.
NetFlow also does some nifty routing table lookups to grab the
Autonomous System number.  This can save a lot of post-processing.
NetFlow will also do some pre-defined aggregations which are fine
for ISPs but no pre-defined aggregation matches customer bill
reconciliation requirements.  NetFlow will also sample traffic,
but the statistical model for this is broken in the current
implementation.

Cisco are reworking NetFlow into a more generic format, so a
lack of support by Linux at the moment isn't a great loss

&gt; WCCP - a cheap way (relative to layer 4 switches) to do transparent
&gt; proxying with a failover mechanism.

Linux with Squid does WCCPv1, v2 with patches, v3 not yet.  WCCP v2
is the most widely deployed version.

Really, it's horses for courses.  For exmaple, the PNG
academic network is planning to run a Cisco 7500-series
router at the core and Linux PCs at the other ends of
those links.  The links are synchronous PPP.

Footnote: you can run Linux on a c2500 is you want to be
at the cutting edge.  Looks good for cheap, high-uptime
DHCP servers in campus networks.
