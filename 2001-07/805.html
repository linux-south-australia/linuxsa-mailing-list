&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have recently arranged for my home directory
&gt; to be nfs mounted from another machine.

yep... :)

&gt; Unfortunately this machine doesn't have its
&gt; time correct --- it is about 20 minutes fast.
&gt; This means that whenever I make any changes
&gt; to a file, its time stamp is wrong --- out by
&gt; 20 minutes.  This causes problems when I
&gt; try to use "make".

indeed -- that problem is a common one...

&gt; What I would like to have happen, is for my
&gt; local machine to determine the time stamp
&gt; on files when they are created or modified.
&gt; Unfortunately none of the nfs options for
&gt; mount seem to allow this.

I've always wanted to see relative time used, so rather than saying when a
file was created, it would say how long ago it was created. This way, your
NFS server could think it's last year, and it would still say the files were
last touched 3 minutes ago, and make would work as expected... I wonder how
hard this would be to implement, and also, if there's a good reason why it's
a dumb idea -- anyone?

&gt; Does anyone have a solution to this problem.
&gt; (Other than asking for time to be fixed on
&gt; the nfs server; or setting my machine's time
&gt; 20 minutes fast.)

I shall be fixing the time on said server in the coming weeks -- it's on my
list of things to do :)
