Hi Richard et al...

A few points...

&gt; The advantages I see are:
&gt;
&gt; 1) uptime (I assume cisco are better here, but that's mainly due to the
&gt; nature of PC hardware)

We use all Cisco routers in our system and to be honest we have had better
uptime from our NT servers (failed modem cards, ISDN interface cards etc)...

&gt; 2) support

This is really good, I spent about 2 hours on the phone to a tech in San
Jose resolving an issue with our IP Phone setup at about 11pm California
time

&gt; 3) speed (which wouldn't be an issue in this case)

As long as you get recent hardware. We have some stuff here that is a couple
of years old and any config changes that we need to make take a long time to
happen (ie type, type, type, wait, wait, wait)

&gt; 4) security perhaps (I have seen more Linux compromises than Cisco, but
that
&gt; could be because I spend more time with Linux)

None of our Cisco hardware has been compromised yet, they use something
something called aaa authentication which could be the Cisco equivalent of
ssh but I'm not sure

&gt; Are there more? Are any of these of more value than I see?

It's cool to say "hey, I have a Cisco router at my place, where's yours?"...

&gt; Advantages of Linux:
&gt;
&gt; 1) flexibility (the box could be multifunction, and can do all sorts of
&gt; things, like account for data and provide a web page summarising costs)

Yep

&gt; 2) price (gotta be cheaper, at least, when considering the extra
&gt; functionality)

Very much so yes

&gt; 3) could be simpler... I'm not experienced in Cisco personally so I really
&gt; don't know about this...

Well, I've only been playing with Cisco stuff for the last couple of months
and I would have to say the Cisco learning curve was a lot easier than my
linux learning curve but that may have been because of my linux experience

&gt; 4) remote admin -- you can either ssh to it or you can't... how would you
&gt; get to a Cisco box remotely?

Richard, Richard, Richard........

_Most_ Cisco equipment has a built in telnet server and you can even give
your Cisco switch an IP address (which is really cool). If you network does
go down and you have no remote access through normal methods, again _most_
Cisco equip has an auxilliary port that you can whack a modem on to and dial
in to the affected hardware (or at least somthing on the same ether)

Anyway, just my thoughts on this.
