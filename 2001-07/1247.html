&gt; cool, thanks. That does what I need for the text based stuff.

actually, that's one command I had been subconsciously looking for for a
long time... :)

However, I almost always want to do this after the fact... ie I run some
command, find it takes longer than I want, don't want to kill it, but really
want to  move to another machine or something. Often I want to pipe the
output to less, or just make it run in the background while I log out... I
suspect that while Unix is flexible enough to let you do anything, you need
to plan ahead more than I do, right? :)

&gt; Now, is there a way of bringing X stuff from one display to
&gt; another. screen
&gt; brings the control of the actual process across but doesnt move
&gt; the actuall
&gt; graphics across.

This also is one thing that I want -- in fact, for some reason, I seem to
want to change a lot of things after it's too late ... changing which
terminal I'm doing something on, which display a process is displaying on,
which user I'm running as (how many times have I edited a config file as
myself, forgetting to type 'sudo', and then not wanted to lose my changes by
restarting?)...

Maybe planning is the answer, but I'd really like to change some of these
things at runtime... :)
