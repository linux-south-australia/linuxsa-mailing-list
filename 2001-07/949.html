Steve!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Microsoft, the world's richest software company, has told a Geelong
&gt; &gt; &gt; charity group, PCs for kids, that it must stop distributing the second
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand computers it recycles and gives to poor children until it can
&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain licenses for the software they carry.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does that software contain licences? What would we be saying if it read:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Richard Stallman, founder of the GPL, wins successful lawsuit against
&gt; &gt; Microsoft for distributing GNU Emacs for Windows under the Microsoft
&gt; &gt; E.U.L.A".
&gt; 
&gt; ? ( I need more coffee)

They're bitching because a company is enforcing a binding contract. Some
people claim that the GPL created by Stallman is a binding contract.
Hence, Microsoft would clearly be in breach if they took GNU Emacs (I
believe the first GPL'ed program but I may be proven wrong) and
relicenced it under the Microsoft EULA.

Now, read that quote in that light; you should see my point.

&gt; &gt; So they should. It's tough. It's life. We expect people to follow the
&gt; &gt; [GPL|BSD LICENCE|PERL LICENCE|ARTISTIC LICENCE]. So we'll just suddenly
&gt; &gt; expect people to not follow the Microsoft EULA because it suits us.
&gt; 
&gt; This one is really good, its so nice to see law abiding MS acting in a ROLE
&gt; model position for people, even though as a corporation they can treat the law
&gt; with contempt. In fact that one deserves a ROFL...
&gt; Read Judge Jackson words regarding MS...

That's beside the point. You are not legally allowed to bring a person's
prior actions into consideration when considering a verdict. You can use
it to discredit witnesses, but the verdict must rest on legal
principles' alone. The Microsoft EULA is a legally binding document.
There is little question of that.

Are you suggesting that we treat people we believe to have acted against
the law in the past as non-citizens, that is citizens not granted the
protection of the law? You put criminals in gaol because they have
committed crimes. But you should not let crimes be committed against
criminals lest you be accused of hypocrisy.

&gt; &gt; a) That's stupid
&gt; &gt; b) That's dumb
&gt; &gt; c) It's idiotic
&gt; &gt; d) It's mentally retarded
&gt; 
&gt; Ahh but only if you are an individual, emm consumer, emm money pit, emm a dumb
&gt; ass thinking ameba 

Huh?

&gt; If your a monopoly, it's
&gt; 
&gt; a) intelligent
&gt; b) smart
&gt; c) clever
&gt; d) Superior Intellect

If you have a licence which people willingly consent to, then enforcing
it is your legal right.
 
&gt; &gt; If we're allowed to pick on them because they enforce what some
&gt; &gt; [possibly stupid] people have signed an agreement with, then we may as
&gt; &gt; well forget about licences at all. They mean nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; Wow, did I mention superior intellect a few lines ago :-)

You did. I presume you were referring to me.

&gt; &gt; &gt; "That would cost us up to $600 per machine.  We don't have that kind of
&gt; &gt; &gt; money," said Mr Bayes.  "I think this is a case of greed and
&gt; &gt; &gt; double-dipping.  These are old, secondhand machines, donated to us for
&gt; &gt; &gt; charitable purposes."
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Bull.
&gt; 
&gt; Scrooge, eat your heart out,  LinuxSA is proud to present our very own, yes
&gt; our very own , come on down DSL ;-)

Who will install any legal operating system he is capable of for no cost
if you ask him nicely. You've taken that totally out of context. To
reduce this argument to absurdity, you could allow any group claiming to
be a charity to steal computer equipment from a computer store for the
needy. And when the compute store sends the police after you, turn
around and say "they're bastards because they aren't willing to donate
to the community".

&gt; Steve bows down to a Human-Demi-God who has actually managed to speak to a
&gt; biological being instead of an answering system.  (humbled beyond words) Did
&gt; they impart wisdom oh wise one?

Wisdom. No. Licences. Yes. I was after licences. Seeing I am, as you
claim, a "Human-Demi-God" why would I need wisdom?

&gt; Geeza a miracle, come on Jesus, geeze one oh them yon miracle things, come on,
&gt; come on...

I'm sure my Son would, but you should stop making your replies so bloody
funny. Miracles are far too difficult to perform when you're lying on
the ground laughing your tits off.
