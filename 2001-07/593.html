&gt; &gt; a co-incidence.  Now you tell me that they're putting RAM on an AGP bus?
&gt; 
&gt; I've always wondered why the AGP bus was for graphics only... I guess that

I belive its was intened for 3d accellerators, and the idea was that its
gets its own dedicated bus to the main ram, and the video card is
supposed to be able to use system ram for textures. However, in reality
it turned out video card ram went more than 250% faster than your system
ram, and so a bottleneck appeared and now most video cards have enough
ram that they dont need system ram (and have a noticable performance hit
if they use it). However you can only have 1 agp slot due to your
chipset only having 1 spare memory bus to use with the AGP. Thus, you
can only have 1 agp slot, which is what made it different from vesa.
With vesa they could just add a few more slots, and it was faster, and
you could have 1 for video and a couple of other cards in the others.
Not so with agp! 

I missed the origianal post, something about ram on AGP? Can someone
confirm that they were plugging ram in to the agp, and not using the agp
to access system ram? (which would make more sense with that extra
system ram bus).
