Been there done that... new Compaq E500.  Was told it was "illegal to sell
computer" without operating system. TRUE I really was ;-) . I asked for a
letter from said company about it being illegal. I RECEIVED THE LETTER and
guess what, oops compaq have an agreement with MS to ship the OS no mention of
law. Dam, was I unhappy, I almost had some ammunition ;-)

Seems though, what was being told in staff training from "MS peeps?" to the
sales staff is simply not true and only a written reply forced them to check
on the validity of the statement.

The rep did say she was sorry, but that was what she had been told and so
passed it on in good faith.

I keep the letter for PR ;-)

&gt; Hey all,

&gt; Slightly off topic, but I was just chatting to a Gateway sales droid
&gt; about buying a laptop without an OS or that Works garbage on it.(to
&gt; put linux on it of course)
&gt;
&gt; The first thing said was about a bunding contract with microsoft, at
&gt; which I grumbled. So he then mumbled something about it being *illegal*
&gt; to sell a computer without an operating system! Then I got a story
&gt; about him knowing someone (a friend?) who got done for it inadvertently.
&gt; The urban legend bells started ringing then.
&gt;
&gt; Does any of this ring true in the real world? Are naked PCs really
&gt; illegal? Or are they just trying to cover their arses w/o looking too
&gt; bad.
&gt;
&gt; Not that I've looked, but I'm sure the EULAs have changed since the
&gt; episode with Geoffrey.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
