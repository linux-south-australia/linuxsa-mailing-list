&gt; means?  For example - what is sync()?

Well, I couldn't find the man page for sync() under Linux, but reading
the man pages for the two userland programs that call them, the FreeBSD
version of sync seems to be the same.

man 2 sync:

	"The sync() function forces a write of dirty (modified) buffers 	in the
block buffer cache out to disk.  The kernel keeps this 	information in
core to reduce the number of disk I/O transfers 	required by the system.
As information in the cache is lost after 	a system crash a sync() call
is issued frequently by the user 	process syncer(4) (about every 30
seconds)."

The times that sync() is may be different under Linux, but they very
well may be the same.

&gt; Should the 2.4 kernel have been released before these
&gt; bugs were worked out?  Are they worked out?

Heh. The problem with Kernel releases such as 2.4 is that there are so
many new features. When do you freeze the code branch and say "OK,
That's a release"?. It's a bit hard. Often you just have to bite the
bullet and release the software even when it's not 100% bullet-proof.

An indication of the number of bugs getting patched up in 2.4 is the
number of new minor releases they've had in the past few months.

In regard to your question, it's probably worth noting that a lot of the
stuff in this (awefully long) changelog is under a -pre branch, meaning
it's not for production, anyway.
