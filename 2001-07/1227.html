<PRE>
The other day an animated fish, fairly small,
moved from the left side of my screen to
the right side, wiggling its way over the
top of my windows.  Then it disappeared,
never to be seen again.

The strange thing is that, to my knowledge, I
didn't do anything to cause this strange
happening.

I am guessing there is some "amusement"
application that does this, but I have never
seen it before, and I did not run it (unless
I somehow did so by accident).

I have a few theories:

1. Someone sent it to my xserver as a joke.
Except that xhost shows that access
control is enabled.

2. My system has been hacked and an
intruder ran it.  But my machine is not
directly  accessible via the internet so this
seems unlikely.

3. I somehow accidentally ran it myself.


None of these theories fit very well.
Anyone with another theory?  Also,
does anyone recognize the "fish" application
I am talking about?


Thanks,

Mark.
