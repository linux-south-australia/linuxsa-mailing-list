&gt; I think the one you are referring to was the orriginal one I suggested prior to the Easter break (which
&gt; did not eventuate as the Easter break was bad timing for many people).

Im referring to the one where someone (sorry forget names) at the
Iptables talk got up and showed a section of the linux-sa web site,
showed us where to sign up as an installer or and installee, and
discussed a t-shirt competition for the event etc... 
 
&gt; Lets just go ahead and see what happens!

yeah sounds good to me :) 
 
&gt; We really need to secure the attendance of at least one guru if possible.  I am similar in that Linux
&gt; is a hobby and not a proffesion for me and there is much yet that I need to learn.

David Lloyd has said he'll attend if he can. I think it should be good!
Possibly a small event might be better than a large event anyway. I have
interest from 8 people, (although 2 are installers and one of them is me
:) So provided we fit in my house it should be good. I'm planning for
saturday the 7th july.  If anyone else is interested send me an email,
and mention if you want to bring your pc, and also what you want to
learn/install.

Cheers,
Ant
