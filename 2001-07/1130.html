&gt; Okay, I'm stuck, I need help.

&gt; I want to use mutt for a mail client, on my slow(er) home machine. Mutt
&gt; works fine, but it has one drawback - it seems (as far as I can tell) to
&gt; send mail by connecting to the SMTP port on the local machine, and I
&gt; can't get Sendmail to talk coherently to the outside world.

yep I recently went through this myself.  It would be much
easier if mutt just supported sending to another machine like
pine or netscape mail etc, but according to the mutt faq
(www.mutt.org) they've made a decision not to do that.
 
&gt; It breaks (as far as I can tell) because it doesn't present a registered
&gt; machine name to the outside world, and then gets it's mail rejected as
&gt; spam.

yep same as me.  I fiddled with sendmail for a bit then gave up
and removed sendmail and installed postfix.  I then got it
working in about 15 mins.  The postfix docs at www.postfix.org
explain how to do it.
