&gt; Could you please qualify this? Are you just making a blanket comment based

Certainly. I've used several UNIX mailers, as well as several
Windows/Mac mailers. The UNIX ones are a lot less likely to send HTML
mail.

Let's take a few that I can think of off the top of my head. Evolution,
Mutt, Pine, XFMail, Xmail, Elm... I could go on. They're all fairly
standard UNIX mailers that either not capable of sending HTML mail or
don't send it by default.

&gt; There are more contextual usages than that. Intercept can imply meeting,
&gt; but not always stoppping.

OK, you've got a different understanding of the word than I (had). I'll
leave out the millions of analogies, as they're not relevant.

&gt; Because it may be of benefit to list users, while at the same time not
&gt; acting like a neo-nazi controller of information. The message gets to the
&gt; list either way and the HTML sender is always sent a short polite and
&gt; helpful reminder either way.

I'm still have reservations about the concept and the success of the
implementation.

I'm still having a hard time getting my head around the reasons. Why is
it so hard to write a reply looking something like:

	&gt; HTML Message and question here

	Please refrain from using HTML email on this list. Please read
	<A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html</A> for more information on propper
	formatting style.

	In regard to your question, try...

&gt; I meant email client. I agree. On the _joking_ side, we could have a "How
&gt; to reply to HTML senders"

:-) My point is, even the messages that David Lloyd has specifically
said don't render properly in his browser have been granted a reply
(from him). What does it mean? Essentially, even the worst messages seem
to be able to be responded to in some shape or form.

&gt; All products start as a home-grown-something. The choice is; do we
&gt; evaluate and use what other people have already written, or do we write
&gt; our own?

All products start out as a solution to a problem. I don't know the
history behind demime, but it seems to work quite well (in removing
MIME). I suppose we could write our own, but I'd be inclined to think
that it would cause too many interuptions during the bug cleaning
process.

Which leads me to another point. You can be assured that installing this
software will lead to a distruption of service. That's to be expected.
Nearly any change you make will result in a service disruption. Letting
the user know about the unwanted HTML email doesn't have that
side-effect.

&gt; And HTML mail does not already look mangled in a plain text mail client?

Netscape renders them OK sometimes, Evolution renders them fine (apart
from the fact that the text appears on one giant line when you go to
reply ;-(, Mutt can be setup to call lynx when HTML is detected. I'm not
sure about others.

It doesn't look pretty most of the time, I'll conceed. It's not as bad
as you make it out to be, though.

Another thing that just dawned on me is the trivial amount of HTML mail
that actually makes it to us. I've counted 8 since mid-May. It seems
that it's not exactly in plague proportions.

&gt; Those with a MIME component that is clearly market and removed. There is
&gt; usually a text compnent that is paired with the HTML part.

That's the slightly easier type.

&gt; The other instance and the only time where the actual tags would have to
&gt; be removed would be when there is no plain text or plain text part, or
&gt; when the whole message is HTML.

That's when it starts to get really messy. Stripping off HTML tags is
not worth the effort.

After a bit of thinking, I've changed my opinion. I now question the
need for a HTML mail filter at all. Why? The amount of HTML mail comming
through is truely miniscule.

That's not to say that the "How to get best results from LinuxSA"
document no longer has a purpose -- it talks about many other things
that have little to do with HTML.
