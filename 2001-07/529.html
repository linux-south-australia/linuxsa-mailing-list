Heh!

&gt; And this has just proved what?

It depends on your point of view what it has proved. I was leaving it up
to everyone else to conclude that I thought that discussion was going
around in circles.

&gt; You can incite more flameage via the list?

I don't need to prove that. Besides, I never intended to create a
flamewar in the first place.

&gt; Keep the thread going?

This has got nothing to do with that thread, whatsover. If I wanted to
keep that thread going I would have posted far more than 7 posts about
it...

&gt; Bring other
&gt; people who couldnt give a rats into this.

The subject contains the word "STUPID" and "Statistics". One occurence
of them should be enough for the astute, technical only reader, or
lurker, that the content is probably STUPID and contains that which the
saying "there are lies, big lies, gigantic lies and statistics". You
will generally find that I do generally keep my subject lines to the
point of the content unless someone has buggered the subject lines up
and I don't want to cause everyone else's thread mechanisms to keel
over.

I should point out that the content of the message to which you replied,
which incidentally you said:

&gt; How about just dropping it!

was both STUPID and STATISTICS.

;-P
