&gt; hmmm -- I never knew that links wouldn't link dirs... interesting... why is

The way the unix manuals used to explain this was that
if you accidentally linked directories in a cyclic fashion - i.e.
not as a directed acyclic graph - then you would get very nasty
outcomes from recursive actions such as a "find" command.

Therefore, in the olden days at least,  only root was allowed
to make a hard link to a directory, and this was not at all
encouraged.

Where symbolic links and NFS become interesting is where you
make a symbolic link outside a file system on the _exporting_
side of the NFS relation. Then can the importing side follow
that link into the file system which is _not_ mounted
by the importing host and _not_ exported by the exporting side?

I think that this is in fact allowed under some circumstance,
but I don't remember the details.

But making a symbolic link from system to system on the
importing side is without "issues".

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
