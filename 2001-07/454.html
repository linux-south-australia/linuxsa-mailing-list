Andrew,

&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt; I'm running both Debian 2.2r0 & RedHat7.1 fine on an
&gt; AMD K6-2-500 no problems. (Not on a laptop, however.)
&gt; This includes kernel 2.2.18 built with 6x86
&gt; optimizations.

That question should never have been asked! d;-)
I knew the answer but was suffering from some left over F.U.D.ge

&gt; &lt;shameless_plug
&gt; I_hope_this_wont_start_another_endless_flame_war=1&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I can quote to custom-build you a system with Linux
&gt; pre-installed if you want. It'll have a reset switch
&gt; as well.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;shameless_plug&gt;

I'm not personally after a new computer (besided the laptop, dependant on
approval from bank of mum..) I'm more trying to find out what options are
out there in Adelaide.

&gt; Funny, they all work with mine.

Mine too although the experts told me otherwise.
I was more commenting on the experts I have spoken to in the shops I used to
visit.

&gt; I use the buz to watch TV while on my PC (bit of a
&gt; waste but I somehow never seem to have the time to do
&gt; video production :-()

If you do look at main actor, I was knocked over by its maturity and would
love to use it again in the future, but my time is spread thin enough too.

&gt; The buz took a bit of fiddling, but when I upgraded to
&gt; kernel 2.2.17 it all got a lot easier (or so it seemed
&gt; to me.) Let us know if you have any problems with it.

I use the same kernel ;-) The zoran modules weren't hard to find once I knew
what I had to look for, I took care of the ppa modules and the 'fool tux
into believing I got scsi' modules at the same time. I found some great
sites with some software for the buz, but none that showed a picture on the
screen (preview like). What software do you use to do that? I can use my buz
for capturing
video / images to disk or outputing to video tape and I was happy with that.

&gt; My parallel port zip drive (ppa module) actually runs
&gt; very significantly faster under Linux than under
&gt; Windows 98SE.

I can agree wholeheartedly! I had my zip drive mounted as a samba share
holding MP3's and could connect two computers and listen to different songs
without too many skips. But trying to listen to an mp3 when the zip is
connected to windows is painfull.

&gt; ??? If he was selling you a
&gt; [Compaq/IBM/HP/Dell/Packard], I hope you asked him
&gt; where the reset button was for when it crashes ...

I would not buy a whole computer, let alone a mouse from that particualr
shop.
Selling seconhand celeron chips at new prices is not nice. Once burnt...

&gt;&gt; Education question
&gt; I cant help you there. I have been thinking of doing
&gt; this myself at some stage.. probably someone else on
&gt; the list will know.

I have been informaed that Richard Sharpe runs some Linux courses
The details are at <A HREF="http://www.iit-training.com.au/">http://www.iit-training.com.au/</A>
If I wasn't saving for a laptop...
