If we had to believe what Adam has just written then me and most of my
colleagues would be out on the street looking for somewhere else to go and
play :)

It is quite easy to oversimplify things, however the answer is that you will
find that Telstra is running just about everything everywhere, and just when
you thought they didn't you'd be proven wrong !.

Adam seems to have made the mainframe class machinery in Telstra's Sydney
and Melbourne data centres redundant by placing dome of their biggest
mainframe applications onto a MidRange platform :)  FlexCAB under Unix - I'd
like to see that :)

Telstra has an internal central data network (or WAN).  This integrated
network spans the entire continent, and more than likely extends over the
entire planet and even into space.  It is comprised of thousands of
fileservers, many thousands of workstations (&gt; 40,000), hundreds of
mid-ranges, and a few mainframes.  This WAN is integrated into the
communications network that Telstra makes it's bread and butter from.  Now
consider Telstra's entire network of literally millions of devices, diverse
exchange technologies, network switches and routers, and then just for a
moment come to the conclusion that Telstra is running alot of different
stuff !!!

And Yes, Telstra whether they know it or not is running Linux boxes
somewhere in the organisation, umm maybe in a CISCO router or two - or
maybe, just maybe, on an OS/390 Mainframe :)

Finally, consider this - earlier this year a company (the parent company of
the one I work for) announced a greater than one $US billion dollars
investment in Linux, a company that is the major supplier of IT services to
Telstra.

Regards,

Richard

&gt;
&gt; &gt; You'd be unlikely
&gt; &gt; to see Windows running their exchanges. Potentially a variant
&gt; &gt; of unix, but more likely an obscure telco OS (although
&gt; &gt; remember that AT&T invented (or at least owned) Unix...)...
&gt;
&gt; *Reminisces*
&gt;
&gt; The exchanges do run a variant of Unix, however I don't know what
&gt; exactly it is, but it's definitely not a specific Telco OS.
&gt;
&gt; I did some work for Telstra for a short time, and as I pointed out in a
&gt; previous email, changing a customer's system configuration requires
&gt; connecting to the exchange.  They use an text based "DOS" program called
&gt; "NAT CAM" to connect to the unix server.  I think the "DOS" version must
&gt; have grabbed your username from Windows NT because from what I remember
&gt; you didn't have to log in directly - it did it all for you, but we must
&gt; have had an individual user account which was granted specific
&gt; privelages, because I had to call some strange guy in Sydney to have
&gt; mine fixed when it wasn't working.
&gt;
&gt; Then using a text-based program you navigate around these ASCII boxes
&gt; and configure stuff. Then that data gets written back to the exchange.
&gt;
&gt; It was actually pretty cool to watch and I was always fascinated by it,
&gt; because the program let you watch the data get grabbed as it connected.
&gt; I could see all these funky initialization commands go by before it
&gt; executed the "CAM" program.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; of course I don't really *know* any of this, it's all hearsay...
&gt;
&gt; And just out of Interest, Telstra's entire customerbase is all stored
&gt; with Unix based systems, called FlexCAB, Axis, & they used some other
&gt; ones that I can't remember for other information retrieval.
&gt;
&gt; FlexCAB allowed you to query customer details, including billing
&gt; addresses, outstanding bill balances and some other info.  Axis gives
&gt; you information about which products each customer is running, eg
&gt; whether they have a Line Hunt system, ISDN, or PSTN lines, and what the
&gt; numbers for those lines are.
&gt;
&gt; The software used to test connections, line quality and other such
&gt; problems was all Unix based.
&gt;
&gt; They run a Windows-based fault logging service called Service*Plus,
&gt; which fell over repeatedly.
&gt;
&gt; I remember several Service*Plus outages, but never any
&gt; FlexCAB/Axis/anything else outages.  I only ever had that one problem
&gt; with NATCAM.
&gt;
&gt; They also have a really cool status report called the "Wellness Report"
&gt; on the Intranet, which gave you information regarding Telstra service
&gt; statuses, including which exchanges were down, and other such
&gt; information.
&gt; I'm sure regarding Telstra's recent recurring 0419 mobile outages, their
&gt; Wellness report has had a lot of red squares :-)  Shame it didn't report
&gt; any Internet outages because that would also be a big red section :-)
&gt;
&gt; There was a cool utility where if a customer reported an outage, you
&gt; could put their PSTN number in a search box, and it would return some
&gt; information regarding why there is an outage, like if there are
&gt; roadworks in progress or something.
&gt;
&gt; *memories*
&gt;
&gt; I loved my job there :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; or maybe there are people here who know... :)
