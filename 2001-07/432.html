&gt; &gt; Really? I've found that any pc off the self, brand name or not is built
&gt; &gt; cheap to stay competetive (particularly the brand names) but if you
&gt; &gt; order a pc part by part and get them to build it although it may cost a
&gt; &gt; bit more at least you get something decent.
&gt; 
&gt; The only difference between purchasing a "Leader PC" and buying the
&gt; parts yourself is the person assembling it. Leader take the bits and
&gt; pieces from "out back" and glue them together.

yeah, but they use cheap crappy brands at any store to have competetive
prices. If you buy brand name components, rather than a brandname box
then you should be ok.
 
&gt; The Compaq, IBM and HPs that I've worked on are all of excellent build
&gt; quality, as well as using decent parts.

Hmmm. Thats why out of 6 new compaq desktops i've unpacked in the last
week, I have had 1 western digital 10gb hdd (they still sell them?)
crash, and 1 faulty 17" compaq monitor. Cdroms are rebadges lite-ons
(yeah, great) all components are on board (all or nothing style) I could
go on... and then get to response time for repair of ciritcal
servers....
 
&gt; I build my own boxes most of the time, but when it really matters (and
&gt; the client is prepared to pay) I'd recommend a brand-name. There are
&gt; numerous other benefits in buying brand name (For example, Compaq, HP
&gt; and IBM have service centers all over the world.[1]).

&gt; 
&gt; [1] The last HP monitor that I was "working with" died. I wrang up HP,
&gt; who couriered out a new monitor and picked up the broken one, no
&gt; questions asked.

Yeah, that is true...  Just depends on who its for I guess.
