&gt;Granted, but most people can use windows and it's a bit easier to talk
&gt;people through it than with linux.

That depends.  Even with joe average computer users I still find it easier
to talk them through doing stuff at a dos prompt than point & click.
(I've worked in Windows desktop support environments for the last 4 yrs)
With any phone support, depending on the problem of course, it depends 
more on the skills of the support person, not the client. (of course there
are some exceptions :o)

&gt;I am also looking at remote admin for them to remove the need for me to go
&gt;anywhere and they already have licences for pcAnywhere which they have paid
&gt;good money for and they would still like to have some use for it.

The solution they're likely to get based on what you've described is
unlikely
to involve using PcAnywhere, tho you could put it on one of the client PCs
and admin the VPN server thru that, bit pointless, but would satisfy them.
Any remote admin for a Linux/BSD box isnt going to cost them a red cent, so
cost for remote admin isn't an issue.

&gt;I came across a similar situation in my last job where we had replaced a
&gt;Novell server with NT4 and the backup program that the client had bought
&gt;specifically for Novell was no longer required, nearly $1000 worth of
&gt;software gone because of an OS change. Customers tend to get a little
shirty
&gt;about those sorts of things.

People don't tend to like finding out they spent money when they didnt have
too.  Try the above 'solution' :o), known as waving a dead chicken..........

&gt;What I am trying to do here is give the customer what they want for the
&gt;smallest outlay possible as they are a community service and don't have a
&gt;lot of money to spend.

More reason to use an opensource solution.  There's 2 other alternatives,
they could buy a bigger box put W2K server on it, or buy a "plug n play"
VPN box for each network, both alternatives won't be cheap.
