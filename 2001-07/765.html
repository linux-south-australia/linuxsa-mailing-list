&gt; has any one successfully been able to convert old PC's into diskless terminals,

Yes. Both Linux and FreeBSD.

&gt; Ifound an article that was written for Debian but I use Mandrake 7.2. the article is a bit ambiguous in places and I am having trouble undestanding it.

There are heaps of magazine articles around the place. They do tend to
assume a working knowledge with Linux or FreeBSD. The best documentation
I have found would be the vast number of relevant HOWTOs (available from
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A>). The HOWTOs I refer to include any thing about
booting, NFS root, XDCMP or remote X apps.

&gt; I know that it is possible but has anyone done it sccessfully here, in Adelaide

Yep. Using either a boot rom or a 16KB boot image on a floppy. Here's a
quick rundown of the process involved with the machines I did:

* PC boots off floppy/bootrom
* bootrom/floppy request an IP address using bootp (DHCP and RARP also
work).
* as well as the ip address, subnet mask, default gateway, etc,etc, the
pc is given a server and file to download
* pc downloads file over TFTP. The file is a Linux kernel (modified with
the mknbi utility from the netboot package)
* PC boots linux kernel, which grabs an IP address and mounts it's root
filesystem over NFS

I've done this with 100-200MHz pentiums with 16MB of RAM quite
successfully. I set up the root file system to be read only and had
symlinks for /tmp, /var and /dev to /rdisk/*. I then had the machines
mount a 4MB ramdisk to /rdisk. This meant that I could use the one root
filesystem (which was only 6MB) for all of the workstations, rather than
having a seperate one for each.

The server I used during testing 12 workstations was an AMD-K6/2-300
with 128MB of RAM. I used blackbox as the window manager (it's pretty
small).

Hope it helps,
Matt
