&gt; &gt; first question: why? I would have thought that there may be a reason why
&gt; &gt; it's in three files (perhaps because putting it in one simply
&gt; won't work...
&gt; &gt; but more likely because you want to share some of these files
&gt; around, but
&gt; &gt; not all of them -- three files may be the most logical way to
&gt; arrange the
&gt; &gt; code.)
&gt;
&gt; I am extending protopkg to make it into a tool which will be used in the
&gt; situation of a ports system.  The reason I want one file instead of
&gt; three is becuase that way it is very easy to have multiple versions (ie.
&gt; multuple files) of a port in its directory - better to have three files
&gt; for three versions instead of nine.

"ports" as in BSD?

personally, I'd go for either different directories or a revision control
system... :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; In the case of the files which were separate from the prototype file
&gt; originally, there was just text - for one, a URI and an MD5 checksum per
&gt; line, and for the other, a keyword and a path to a file.  The text
&gt; between the flags is handled by other functions in the protopkg script.

Ah, I see...

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a read_rules() function that extracts the information between
&gt; &gt; &gt; the flag name passed to it as an argument.  This is it below:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; where? in the prototype file?
&gt;
&gt; No.  The read_rules() function is in the protopkg script/program.  The
&gt; prototype file itself is never run, its functions are called by
&gt; protopkg.

ah -- so there are four files, and you are merging three into one, and
keeping the generic script... I see...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; No - read_rules() and the other functions are contained withing the
&gt; `protopkg` script.  Essentially, the prototype file contains information
&gt; on how to build the source code tarball in question, along with some
&gt; other things.

ahhhhh....

&gt;
&gt; An example would look like this:
&gt;
&gt; ------
&gt;
&gt; package:
&gt; VERSION=2.0
&gt; PROGNAME=xmms-$VERSION-$ARCH-$BUILD
&gt; BUILD=1
&gt; ARCH=`/bin/arch`
&gt;
&gt; DESC="\
&gt; Info about \n \
&gt; the package"
&gt;
&gt; STRIPBIN=y
&gt; STIRPLIB=y
&gt; SETATTR=y
&gt;
&gt; compile() {
&gt;  tar zxvf $CWD/xmms-$VERSION
&gt;  ./configure --prefix=/usr
&gt;  make
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; install() {
&gt;  make install
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; :package
&gt;
&gt; sources:
&gt;  <A HREF="http://www.xmms.org/xmms-2.0.tar.gz">http://www.xmms.org/xmms-2.0.tar.gz</A>
&gt; :sources
&gt;
&gt; conf:
&gt;  /etc/xmms.conf
&gt; :conf
&gt;
&gt; ---------
&gt;
&gt; The text between the 'package' flags is the stuff called by protopkg to
&gt; compile and install the package. 100% bash.  The rest is not bash code,
&gt; just lines of data that the protpkg scrip interprets.

ok -- I notice that the "lines of data" between the sources and conf flags
look like URLs and files respectively... I assume they could be lists of
URLs/files -- if they are pretty regular data, then it should be easy:

Personally, to provide what looks to me like the same functionality, I'd
consider replacing them with a function like (note my syntax is very rusty):

read_lines()
{
	if [$1 == "sources"]
	then
		cat &lt;&lt; EOF
&lt;sources text&gt;
EOF
	elif [$1 == "conf"]
	then
		cat &lt;&lt; EOF
&lt;sources text&gt;
EOF
	fi
}

...and removing the definition of read_lines() from the original script... I
suppose it depends quite how `read_lines()` is used in the script itself...
if all it does is set an environment variable, then just set that variable
in the prototype <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

$SOURCES = "source1\n\
source2\n\
source3"

etc

perhaps even make `read_lines_conf()` etc...

does this help? I'm now interested in solving your problem, so you'd better
tell me :)
