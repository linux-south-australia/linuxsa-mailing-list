&gt;&gt; It depends a lot on what you want to achieve.  The fact is that most
&gt;&gt; people in the computer industry need to make money.  So far the only
&gt;&gt; proven way to make money out of software is to sell or license it,
&gt;&gt; both of which are impossible with the GPL.  This makes the GPL a
&gt;&gt; somewhat idealistic licensing mechanism.  I also don't give it much of
&gt;&gt; a hope when somebody finally challenges it in court.
&gt;
&gt; It is not clear that this last statement is true.

On the contrary, it's a completely true statement of my opinion :-)

&gt; I think that the fact that MS has chosen to publically attack the
&gt; GPL means that they have checked it out and think that it will stand
&gt; up in court, or that there is a high risk that it will stand up in
&gt; court.

That's a valid point.  More likely, though, I think that Microsoft is
concerned about the adverse publicity, or that possibly other
companies, even larger than Microsoft, might stand up on the side of
the GPL.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the GPL, but I think of it more
as a gentleman's agreement than a legally binding document.  Note also
that even if it does stand up in court, the cost of litigation could
kill it.
