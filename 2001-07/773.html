&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; I am the volunteer IT Support for the Salisbury
&gt; North Neighbourhood 
&gt; Network. We are a community group working under the
&gt; auspices of the 
&gt; City of Salisbury. We run a unique program to
&gt; refurbish computers, 

&lt;snipped&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; So far I have tried Red Hat 7.1 and Mandrake 8.0
&gt; with limited success. 
&gt; Shortly (once it dl's) I will be trying the Peanut
&gt; distro to see if 
&gt; their claimed 148M space is enough to work the rest
&gt; in. Fitting the OS 
&gt; onto the small space as well as leaving enough room
&gt; for Star Office is 
&gt; the major problem.

Honestly, a 1.2GB HDD should be buckets of space for
what you are trying to achieve.

One thing you can do with the Distros, is just not
install eveything. The trick is knowing what to leave
out. The trouble with RedHat et al is the installers
give you some choices between types of systems & then
load tons of stuff a lot of which (esp. in your case)
will never be used. 


If you can work out what to put on, which I would
assume would be the core system, X/Windows, KDE or
Gnome (but only the bare bones), StarOffice and some
internet connectivity, you may be able to choose the
custom install selecting individual packages. This
leads to your next point...

&gt; 
&gt; The other biggie is that the users are in many cases
&gt; going to be 
&gt; computer illiterate and will need to get basic
&gt; computer training as 
&gt; well as training in Linux and Star Office. We can do
&gt; that but the 
&gt; systems will still need to be stable and dead simple
&gt; in operation.

The less stuff on there, the less stuff a newbie can
mess up (at least until they get more experienced).
You can still ship a CD of other apps, just dont have
them installed to start with. Your average user in
this scenario will be able to achieve most things with
Star Office.

One area you may have problems with is printing, esp.
if the printers are InkJets that dont have LInux
drivers avail.

&gt; 
&gt; Any constructive advice is welcomed and appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If there are any experienced Linux users in the
&gt; vicinity of Salisbury 
&gt; North reading this your physical help to get this
&gt; project under way 
&gt; would be much appreciated. I can offer free coffee
&gt; and loads of 'fun' 
&gt; with old computers &lt;G&gt;

Please contact me offlist, I live in Pooraka area and
would like to help but amount of time I can donate is
limited

&gt; 
&gt; I am also on the lookout for 2nd hand 72pin EDO RAM
&gt; to fit into these 
&gt; machines so they can all have a minimal level of 64M
&gt; RAM.
