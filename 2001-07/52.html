I hope that's okay then - as I am thinking of an event
to get together and learn about Linux as well.

There are so many questions I have (although I hope I
will be able to answer a few too!)

&gt;&gt; I think the one you are referring to was the orriginal one I suggested prior to the Easter break (which
&gt;&gt; did not eventuate as the Easter break was bad timing for many people).
&gt;
&gt;Im referring to the one where someone (sorry forget names) at the
&gt;Iptables talk got up and showed a section of the linux-sa web site,
&gt;showed us where to sign up as an installer or and installee, and
&gt;discussed a t-shirt competition for the event etc... 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Lets just go ahead and see what happens!
&gt;
&gt;yeah sounds good to me :) 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We really need to secure the attendance of at least one guru if possible.  I am similar in that Linux
&gt;&gt; is a hobby and not a proffesion for me and there is much yet that I need to learn.
&gt;
&gt;David Lloyd has said he'll attend if he can. I think it should be good!
&gt;Possibly a small event might be better than a large event anyway. I have
&gt;interest from 8 people, (although 2 are installers and one of them is me
&gt;:) So provided we fit in my house it should be good. I'm planning for
&gt;saturday the 7th july.  If anyone else is interested send me an email,
&gt;and mention if you want to bring your pc, and also what you want to
&gt;learn/install.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Ant
