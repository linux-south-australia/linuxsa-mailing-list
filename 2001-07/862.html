&gt; I've been making some modifications to a tool called protopkg, which
&gt; takes source code and makes a slackware package from it.  My first job
&gt; has been to make it read from one build file, instead of three.

first question: why? I would have thought that there may be a reason why
it's in three files (perhaps because putting it in one simply won't work...
but more likely because you want to share some of these files around, but
not all of them -- three files may be the most logical way to arrange the
code.)

&gt; Previously, it had a 'prototype' file, in which there was certain
&gt; variables, as well as package specific compile() and install()
&gt; functions.  The other files it could use were 'sources' and 'rules.'  In
&gt; each of these files, there were various lines of text in between two
&gt; flags, in the following format:
&gt;
&gt; flag:
&gt; text
&gt; text
&gt; text
&gt; :flag

what type of text? Is this bash commands, environment variable settings, or
some other config settings?

&gt; There is a read_rules() function that extracts the information between
&gt; the flag name passed to it as an argument.  This is it below:

where? in the prototype file?

&gt;
&gt; read_rules() {
&gt;    sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^$/d' | sed -n "/^${1}:/,/^:${1}$/p" |
&gt;    grep -Fv "${1}:" | grep -Fv ":${1}" | sed -e "s/^[ \t]*//"
&gt; }

ok, in playing around with this, I think that the read_rules() function just
reads the stuff between the flags, and prints it to stdout, right?

&gt; So, in order to combine all three files into one, I made another set of
&gt; flags to encapsulate that which was originally alone in the 'protopkg'
&gt; file (flag name is 'package') and then appended the other two files to
&gt; it.

ok, so it (the (new, modified) prototype file?) looks like:

---------------
#!/bin/bash

&lt;bash program with read_rules function defined&gt;

...

package:
flag:
text
text
:flag

anotherflag:
text
text
:anotherflag
:package

-------------

right?

&gt; The problem starts here.  Originally, the entire prototype file was
&gt; sourced, which was OK since it contained only Bash stuff.  However, now
&gt; it doesn't, so I want to use the read_rules() function to just source
&gt; the stuff in between the 'package' flags.  My failed attempt is below.

This code (below) is from the new prototype file, right? or are you running
it in your interactive shell (afaik, there's no reason to source something
in a script...)?

&gt;
&gt;      # This dumps it to a file called source.  So close!  But I want it
&gt;      # read *internally*
&gt;
&gt;      read_rules "package" &lt; prototype &gt; source
&gt;      . ./source
&gt;      rm source
&gt;
&gt;      # WHAT A CRUDDY HACK.
&gt;      # Originally, it just used `. ./prototype` to source the whole
&gt;      # file.
&gt;
&gt; Every other attempt I have made, I cannot get it to do anything but dump
&gt; the stuff between the package flags to stdout.

so the above does what you want, but you don't like it?

show us the skeleton of the file you are running, marked with which bits are
from what file...

&gt;
&gt; So, all you bash wizards out there, am I missing something?  Or is there
&gt; a better way of approaching the whole situation?

personally, I'd suggest rethinking your reasons for making it one file -- it
sounds to me as if there are good reasons for it being separate, as one
seems to be config, the other, a script...

However, if you are still wanting to go further down this garden path, try
looking at "here documents" in man bash... I think that they may be better
than the phunky flag mechanism... (although I can't see how you can "source"
a here document, at least not without a fair bit of frobbing about...)
