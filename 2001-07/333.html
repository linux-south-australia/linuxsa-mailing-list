&gt; It -does- seem as though you're complaining about "newbies" presence but
&gt; not wanting to do anything about it. Richard's suggestion isn't at all a

Richard's suggestion is a lame arse attempt at getting rid of someone who
doesn't agree with his pet theory of what should happen to the list. The
fact that you share this pet theory of his doesn't make you right either.

I resent the fact that I'm being directed off the list because I expressed
an opinion. Who are you to tell me where to go? I don't know you.

&gt; No one is denying you the right to express your opinion.

You guys have voted for a more newbie friendly list. In great detail.
With many many messages. Tedious, overflowing, brain numbing excess
of messages. Day after day after day of beep after beep of new mail
cascading down my mailbox screen.

I have voted for this list remaining the same. With one message.

Everything since then has been knocking back the pressure to shut me up.

&gt; If you're going to be blatenty, dare I say it, stupid about what you say
&gt; to the world, make another list and tell it to them. I can say for one

Or I can just say it in here and have some people think I'm an idiot.
I might have to shrug indifferently if it really hurt, but I'll live.

Still, you had better back up that insult there. Tell me why I'm stupid.
Demonstrate the logic that makes you so sure of your world view that you
can freely call someone else 'stupid'.

Make a new list and I'll join you there if you're so anxious to make new
lists for inappropriate reasons like "does not agree with me".

&gt; To quote Mark Newton on the subject of going over and over things:

Mark may have a different opinion in this context. This isn't really about
newbies anymore. That was one message. This is about RR and you thinking
you have editoral rights on my free speech.

Let Mark speak for himself, and start speaking for yourselves.

&gt; I reckon I could put money on the fact that you knew exactly what the
&gt; reasons behind my comments were.

Nope. I have no idea why you think I'm wrong when I say that viewing
Linux from the business perspective is inaccurate. I have no inkling
as to how you could think that marketing Linux to Grannies is the
appropriate thing to do.

&gt; Finally, "... a waste of space..."? Uh huh.

It's a complete waste of space to say "I disagree" without saying why.

You may as well click a little button on a web site poll since we'd
be able to collect thousands and thousands of your irrelevant little
opinions with just a couple of numbers.

Try following Christopher Yeoh's example - he posted a good response
and I agreed with his observations.
