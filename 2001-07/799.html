Hi.

The problem appears to be that you want to use your isp as a mail store.
I'm sure there are a lot of people on this list who collect their mail
from the isp and store it on their own mail server. That way it is
accessible and you only have to delete it once. If you wanted, you could
run imap on your own mail server...

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe the two ISPs in question (SENet and iPrimus) support
&gt; IMAP.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; but in that case, I suspect you are stuck with your present situation...
&gt; &gt; IIRC, your main issue with the current situation is that messages get
&gt; &gt; downloaded once per OS, which is a pain, particularly for big messages...
&gt; &gt; I'd suggest manually deleting big messages (or perhaps, try looking into
&gt; &gt; selectively removing them from the server...)
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, it's not only the big messages that are a problem, it's also
&gt; the large number of messages I have to multiply-delete, such as from
&gt; LinuxSA, which is overly tedious and time-consuming (as much as I enjoy
&gt; reading the entertaining and informative banter, once is generally enough!).
&gt; 
&gt; It really seems to only come down to the fact that the
&gt; last-message-downloaded tracking aspect is what's standing between me and my
&gt; idyllic (well, satisfactory) mail management. I'd rather hoped that, given
&gt; the must-run-under-Linux-too requirement, that the odds would have been in
&gt; my favour (in as much as that the tracking would be done in a shareable way,
&gt; i.e. stored in a file rather than tucked away inaccessibly in a registry
&gt; hive somewhere). Sadly this doesn't appear to be the case.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't be the first person to face this dilemma? However, since the
&gt; prospects are not looking good of finding a solution using POP servers,
&gt; would anyone care to recommend an ISP that supports IMAP?
