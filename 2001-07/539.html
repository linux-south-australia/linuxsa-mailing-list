&gt; Hi Richard et al...

Hi Wilbs :)

/me waves

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; 1) uptime (I assume cisco are better here, but that's mainly due to the
&gt; &gt; nature of PC hardware)
&gt;
&gt; We use all Cisco routers in our system and to be honest we have had better
&gt; uptime from our NT servers (failed modem cards, ISDN interface
&gt; cards etc)...

oh.

buh.

that's dissappointing... ... ...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; 4) remote admin -- you can either ssh to it or you can't... how
&gt; would you
&gt; &gt; get to a Cisco box remotely?
&gt;
&gt; Richard, Richard, Richard........

Wilbs, Wilbs, Wilbs.........

Cisco stuff is new to me...

&gt; _Most_ Cisco equipment has a built in telnet server and you can even give

but you don't want to telnet over the internet to your cisco and allow
anyone to snoop your password and hence change your ACLs...

&gt; your Cisco switch an IP address (which is really cool). If you
&gt; network does
&gt; go down and you have no remote access through normal methods, again _most_
&gt; Cisco equip has an auxilliary port that you can whack a modem on
&gt; to and dial
&gt; in to the affected hardware (or at least somthing on the same ether)

This would be the serial console? yah... I suppose that would work -- in
fact, that would be good...

What I was thinking was:

If the WAN link was up, but the internal routing was stuffed for some
reason, you could get to a Linux gateway through ssh without an issue...
However, if you managed to do the same with a router, I wasn't sure if you
could do it -- I would have assumed that you would normally want to ssh
through the router to a server on the other side, then telnet (or whatever)
back in...

Hmmm...

More research is required :)
