Don't flatter your self Mr. Lloyd. :-)
While one or two of your emails might have been involved, I think that it
has been an issue for other people for a lot longer. I think that people
are looking for a good common ground. The world is changing, there are so
many mail clients out there and so much software that is not-so-compatible
on many levels. This recent debate has been more constructive and mature
than I could have imagined. I think a lot of people are learning a lot
about each other and what are good ways to do things.

It is kind of like an immunisation. :-)
