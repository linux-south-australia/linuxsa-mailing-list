Hi Damien,

We have them where I am working. I don't know about your problem with
putting multiple networks off two Y's but I can give you the wireing diagram
:


Main: 1 - Jack 1 pin 1
	2 - Jack 1 pin 2
	3 - Jack 1 pin 3
	4 - Jack 2 pin 2
	5 - Jack 2 pin 1
	6 - Jack 1 pin 6
	7 - Jack 2 pin 3
	8 - Jack 2 pin 6

Hope this helps.

Brad

Subject: Y-Ethernet cables and multiple networks


Hi all...

I have a bit of a situation ATM where our two financial officers require a
PSTN line in their office that is currently only wired up for two data
points (one computer, one IP phone).

I can patch in a phone line into one of the points but that means they lose
either their computer or their phone.

Also, I cannot cascade the computer off the phone (it has a bypass ethernet
port on it) as they are on separate networks. These two networks each have
their own DHCP server (one for the phones, the other for the PC's) and they
cannot get mixed up otherwise neither machine will work properly.

What I was thinking of was running some Y-Ethernet cables into the patch
panel and out of their points in the wall to give them what they need. My
question is, can I run multiple networks accross a Y cable?

I would really like to avoid having to pull though another line to each
office.

If this would work, can anyone tell me where I can get my hands on some Y
cables or give me a wiring diagram for one?

Many thanks
