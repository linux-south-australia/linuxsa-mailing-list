Hi Kevin

You should be able to get a Western Dig version of Ezdrive off their 
website.

&gt; Hi - its been quite some time since I've been on this great list. I
&gt; unsubscribed ages ago when I shelved Linux for a while because I had far too
&gt; much else to do but on the weekend I built a PC from parts I had lying
&gt; around and loaded Linux - my first solely Linux box :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I used an old 1.2GB drive I had in my first 486, back in the days when the
&gt; BIOS wouldn't recognise more than about 528MB so the drive came with EZDrive
&gt; (also went by the name of OnTrack Manager in later releases and I think
&gt; Western Digital had aversion as well) from Micro House to manipulate the MBR
&gt; and BIOS to think it was something else. 
&gt; 
&gt; EZDrive was a program that provides software logical-block addressing (LBA)
&gt; support for systems having BIOSs that do not support LBA. The trouble is
&gt; that Linux doesn't like this (which I confirmed from a SUSE list) and
&gt; EZDrive, parts of which still reside in the MBR falls over on it (wrong OS
&gt; it says) because I think its expecting to see DOS or WIN 3.x or NT or one of
&gt; those types of OS's. But after all these years I can't locate my EZDrive
&gt; disk which would allow me to eradicate EZDrive. Micro House have since gone
&gt; by the way side and you can buy EZDrive but I figured I'd try some other
&gt; options first. 
&gt; 
&gt; One suggestion is to boot the machine in DOS and issue an FDISK /MBR to
&gt; re-write the MBR. 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any exposure to this problem? Will the above measure cure it?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA?
