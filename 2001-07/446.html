Hi List,

At the moment my main mandrake install is playing up.
The emergency install on the other disk isnt going too well either (doh! see
Q1)

I'm a windows refugee / cross platformer so I like my box to start in
runlevel 5.
It used to do just that, but after giving me some grief.
I would be forced to stop X respawning and login, start xfs manually then
startx.
I finally got around to setting xfs to run at startup and I that may have
started the problems (cant think why?) Anyway, now startx starts x but then
it sits there... doing nothing... with a black screen... till i get annoyed
and press the reset button as no other key combinations get a response.

Where do I look for error logs, messages etc? I really need to
fix it soon as that install also has glade and everything else installed and
I've been bitten by the gui bug again. Running the programs from the other
install doesnt go to plan, and migration / merging of the two install
(seperate disks) proves to be too much of a headache.

&lt;Q3&gt;
I've been stuck using windows and Delphi and it's either going to turn me
soft with all it's pre built goodies or compel me to buy kylix. If kylix can
be used to port my windows delphi code to linux I'm sold. Has anyone
produced any cross platform apps with this or ported windows delphi code?
I remember seeing some kylix posts on the list before, Richard, can you
help? I also read that it may be released gpl and free for download (which
suits my budget) anyone heard more on this?

Although I'm happy enough to stick with glade, perl-gtk the llama and the
camel.
But still, i'll need X to run them anyway...... aaarrrgggghh.

&lt;frustrated&gt;

Jay
