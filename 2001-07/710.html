&gt; I'd like to maintain a single mail store and have it accessible from
&gt; Linux/Win98/Win2k and to be able to download new messages (under whichever
&gt; OS is running at the time) from multiple POP servers while leaving the
&gt; messages on those servers.

you sound like you don't really want to leave them on the servers... if you
do, try running IMAP servers instead of POP -- then you don't need a local
mail store...

&gt; While I've had a degree of success with sharing a common message store
&gt; (using various MUAs available for those Operating Systems), the main
&gt; stumbling block is that the tracking of the most recently downloaded
&gt; messages isn't shared, so whenever I switch OS I'll be
&gt; downloading the same
&gt; messages a second or third time. This is a problem due to the
&gt; combination of
&gt; a large volume of messages and the large size of some of them.

personally, I'd either set your MUAs to remove messages, or, if you want,
have one remove messages, while the others leave them there -- that way you
always have all your messages in one place, yet you can see new messages
when you are on a different OS...

&gt; I've just tried running a multi-platform mail server (CommuniGate
&gt; Pro) which
&gt; has an RPOP facility and connecting to that using IMAP. Unfortunately it
&gt; suffers the same issue (multiple downloads from the POP servers) when
&gt; switching between OSes.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any ideas on how this might be achieved or am I simply asking
&gt; too much? I'm not having much luck finding references to this
&gt; scenario in my
&gt; web searches. Is running a web server on a separate machine the
&gt; only answer?

I think this depends on what you are really trying to acheive here... why do
you want to do this? (not that there aren't any good reasons, in fact there
are a few, but what are _your_ reasons?)
