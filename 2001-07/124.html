Hi All,
    Since I feel partly responsible for prompting a great
deal of the discussions over the past few days over various
topics, I thought I would add my 2c worth.

    In Melbourne, the Linux Users of Victoria (luv) have
several news lists for various sections. In particular they
have a luv-beginners list specifically set up for those RTFM
questions and other newbie questions. They also have on
their web pages rules for posting to each group and also
regularly post those rules to the lists. I thought at first
nobody would answer alot of these questions on the beginner
lists, but it seems that there are a core group of people,
similar to what we have on this list who post to both the
main and beginners lists and answer peoples questions. Most
of these people also cross post to the other group if the
information is particularly relevant to the other list. I
have noticed that a fair amount of flaming and bitching
occurs on the main list as it does from time to time on this
one, but the beginners list tends to be alot more tolerant.
More or less any beginners question can be asked on the
beginners list, but if you post to the main list then you
are fair game to a roasting or screams of RTFM. The other
particularly good thing they have in Melbourne is a FAQ, and
often people are referred to that if their question is
answered there.

    One thing I did find in Melbourne is that they have a
slightly different Linux Community, with different
interests. While they have regional and specific special
interest groups (sigs) that may not work in Adelaide, there
are a few technical minded people who post to the lists, I
discovered that the support base was mainly orientated
towards Linux Gaming and Mac Linux. I think that Adelaide
has a much broader Technical base and is much more helpful
than Melbourne in terms of support, especially people who
are willing to visit people's homes to help out. I also
think that Adelaide could benefit from the best parts of the
Melbourne system and become much greater than the sum of
it's parts. I think it is a very good idea to start a
separate list for beginners, and I don't think it would be
detrimental to LinuxSA. I also think that it would fit in
very nicely with any kind of wide spread advertising of
Linux like that discussed on this list in the last couple of
days.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: seperate Linux-SA mailing list


&gt; I wonder if what we percieve as vitality (in the
&gt; Linux-SA mailing list) may be overwhelming for newbies
&gt; or those that have only the occasional question.
&gt;
&gt; I suggest that a seperate mailing list is a very good
&gt; idea or we could scare people off with hundreds of
&gt; emails a day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - Every PC shop in SA is given an A4 sheet of paper
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with instructions on how to join a mailing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; list called, say, linux-start-SA, or something
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to that effect.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - We set up a new mailing list with the purpose of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; getting people just basically started.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; You are looking at LinuxSA-questions (a la
FreeBSD-questions), I think.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;...or are we looking at LinxSA plus a heavy hand of
tolerance??? My
&gt; &gt;experience of split lists is that the 'cadet' list gets
damn all relevant
&gt; &gt;traffic and the 'older sibling' list gets lots of flick
passes to the 'cadet'
&gt; &gt;list that somehow never get there...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Can I very respectfully suggest that this list works very
well as is, and as
&gt; &gt;with life beyond the list there will always be room for
more tolerance and
&gt; &gt;inclusiveness? Good will is probably the only mandatory
requirement for
&gt; &gt;list-joining IMVHO.
