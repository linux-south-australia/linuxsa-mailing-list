Eeeck!

&gt; [1] I suggest that &gt;50% of the group is made from the many instances of
&gt; David Lloyd... As is rumoured for Shakespeare, one man simply could not
&gt; produce that volume of literature/email (guess who did which!) -- it must be
&gt; a group...

The other person (who would continously go looking at the flowers)
claimed to be more than one person. I assure you that there has only
ever been one me not counting the "Linux Sea Mailing List" which was
allegedly propagated by the OTHER David who creates interesting
discussions from time to time.

&gt; [2] ok, "if the David Lloyds"

Why would you want less than half of the committee comprising of me? In
fact, in order for there to be more than half a committee of just one,
the committee would consist of just one. Given that we should model LEGS
under how LinuxSA is modelled, we should run LEGS as a benevolent
dictatorship that listens to other influential members.

&gt; [5] Any of Alan Kennington's emails should automatically be split into two
&gt; at the "PS". This could be acheived by a simple script.

Perhaps at every paragraph.

&gt; [7] That is, those from David Lloyd or David Newall.

Huh? It's not possible to misinterpret one of my e-mails unless you're
pullin' yerself at the same time :-(

&gt; PS: in case you are a moron, this email is not to be taken seriously, and I
&gt; took digs at individuals who I suspect won't take offence. :)

Ditto...
