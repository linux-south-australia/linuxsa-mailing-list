Subject: Problems retrieving mail from my POP server


&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; I am having lots of problems retrieving mail from my POP server. I
&gt; currently use Mozilla 0.9.2 and the mail client (boy is it slow :-() and
&gt; Mandrake 7.2 on my gateway with the imap 2000 update from Mandrake.
&gt;
&gt; When certain messages get into my mailbox, retrieval stops at that point
&gt; and does not clear out the mailbox either. I then have to go in manually
&gt; and clear the message.
&gt;
&gt; Messages which often cause this problem seems to be security advisories
&gt; from Caldera.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone seen this problem, what do I need to do to fix it?

Richard,

I have seen this on two or three occassions with my POP account at SENet,
the client was Outlook Express.

In my case the problem was tracked down to the terminating period (I'm going
from memory here - the POP protocol requires a single period on a line of
its own after the last line of the message proper i.e. the last five bytes
sent should be 0x0d,0x0a,0x2e,0x0d,0x0a). The messages that were causing the
problem had either a number of spaces before the period, or possibly the cr
from the preceding line was missing, i.e. it sent &lt;last line of
message&gt;,0x0a,0x2e,0x0d,0x0a.

This behaviour was witnessed when telneting to the POP server, and I had to
delete the problem messages manually. It made me curious as to whether those
messages had been so accepted by their server, or whether they had been
stored incorrectly or corrupted. I made a couple of attempts to bring the
issue to SENet's attention, but that only resulted in their tech support
interrogating me about my OS/TCP-IP/Browser/Mail/Breakfast/Phase-of-the-moon
configurations so I let it go. Stlll, I haven't seen it happen again for
probably twelve months or more.

You could verify how that POP server is terminating those messages.


Regards,

Wayne
