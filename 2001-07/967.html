&gt; It sounds to me that what you need is the O'Reilly book
&gt; on Linux and Lego Mindstorms. 

Cool, I'll have a look into that one as well as the Device Drivers book

&gt; cheap Mindstorms set and a book, you should have enough to
&gt; get started. There are also some very good books at Dick
&gt; Smith Electronics on Robots at the moment that include
&gt; software clips in Visual Basic which should point you in the
&gt; right direction, and then all you have to do is port them 

Also looking into that, thanks.

&gt; There are several HOWTOs available also on
&gt; Mindstorms, and Device Drivers that would come in handy.

I found a heap on LDP last night, but didn't know about the Mindstorms one.
Do now...

&gt; If you are already into electronics,

Not quite! This is the beggining of it d;-j

&gt; communication boards that plug into your PC that you build
&gt; as a kit that are aimed at just what you want and are also
&gt; available at DSE and other places. Pretty much it should
&gt; cost you about A$250 for a mindstorms kit, a com card kit,
&gt; and a couple of books, and then you should have everything
&gt; that you need. If you want to do it on the cheap, then I
&gt; would recommend a book from DSE and an old computer of some
&gt; description and some parts and away you go. Hope this helps.

It did, thanks.

Jay
