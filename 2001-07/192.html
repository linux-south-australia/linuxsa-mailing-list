 &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we could have a 'linuxSAadmin' list for discussing how the list is

 &gt; &gt; &gt; discussions and technical related flame wars.
 &gt; &gt; No.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Any reason or opinion, or do you just feel like saying no today?

Every possible reason or opinion to support that statement has already
been canvassed, at length, several times.  Read the archives, or ask
him privately for further explanations, or go stick your head in a pig,
or do *anything*, but please don't offer further encouragement to people
who, given the opportunity, will repeat the same points they've been 
repeating during this thread since it started.

The whole topic is excruciatingly boring.

Here's a relevent datapoint:  Anyone who's capable of reaching Yahoo
Groups is also capable of setting up another mailing list to discuss
whatever the hell they want, whenever the hell they want, without
discussion or approval from this list.  If someone gives enough of a
shit to do that, please go right ahead, and post an announcement here
when the new list is ready.  If nobody here cares enough to do that,
then this whole discussion is a total waste of time, and continuing
it will serve no useful purpose whatsoever.

And no, I don't want to hear about how Yahoo Groups is a piece of shit,
or about how there are lots of other group servers which anyone with
half a neuron can drive, or about how I can configure procmail to nuke
this thread on sight if I don't like it, or anything else.  I just want
this whole issue to get the hell out of my mailbox.

Thank you.
