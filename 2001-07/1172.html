This is an interesting discussion, not!

Having recently sat the LPI102 exam (with LPI101 done over a year ago), 
and then having been involved on the team that constructed the next 
level of exams, it is interesting to think about the exams from the 
point of view of what they are intended to achiev, and how to short 
curcuit them.

I found that there were questions in the LPI102 exam that were possible 
to finesse. As long as one knew enough about the general area, one could 
often get the right answer without knowing the exact answer.

Of course, what one is trying to do is assess the candidate's knowledge 
in an area, and if one only has 60 or so questions to assess it in, a 
lot of care has to be taken. It would be prefferable to do a hands-on 
exam, but this is just not possible in many cases.

In setting questions, I found myself preffering those where two pieces 
of information had to be given. Then I could provide the following sort 
of questions:

   Which of the following frobs are required to fubar a froboz?

    a) Richard Stallman could do it very quickly

    b) X and Y  (correct answer)

    c) Y and Z

    d) X and W

    d) Richard Stallman doesn't know what he is talking about

Clearly, you have to know what you are on about, and be able to ignore 
Richard Stallman, to get the right answer, If you only know half the 
answer, you only have a one in three change of getting it right.

As to these bozos with certification, an MCP is not all that good. An 
MCSE is better. But one does hear of 2 year olds who have passed their 
MCSE's.

All I can say is that prospecive employers should insist on the shaving 
test. If they don't cut themselves shaving, they can probably be trusted 
near a computer :-)

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to briefly comment on remarks made recently by Adam
&gt; and Ian regarding formal education.
&gt; 
&gt; Adam said:
&gt; &lt;Yes this is a problem with the whole UAI/TER system.
&gt; &lt;I could not know a thing about computers and get into computer
&gt; &lt;science,
&gt; So what...sure...previous computer knowledge is an advantage
&gt; ...however it is not...nor should it be...a mandatory requirement
&gt; to be accepted into the Computer Science course...it is far more
&gt; important that the student has a genuine interest in IT...and the
&gt; right attitude to learning.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;pass the courses and still know nothing about how to put a PC
&gt; &lt;together and yada yada.
&gt; Once again...so what...take a good look at the curriculum...it is
&gt; focused mainly on software design and development...although I do
&gt; agree that getting some basic knowledge on hardware components is
&gt; well worth while...IMHO this is not a course designed for those who
&gt; wish to be computer technicians.
&gt; 
&gt; Ian said:
&gt; &lt;Same with the MCP.
&gt; &lt;I can speak with painful experience. Recently several nerds with
&gt; &lt;very little experience,
&gt; IT encompasses a broad range of technical fields...I am yet to meet
&gt; anyone who is competent in all of them...hence I am very careful
&gt; before making judgments...like the above...about others...maybe you
&gt; should be too...or are you that confident in your own ability.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;one had only used Windows 3.11 until he started the course, passed
&gt; &lt;the MCP with flying colours.
&gt; So what...did you know that he only required a pass in one exam to
&gt; get MCP status...hardly a challenge...it should have been obvious to
&gt; someone such as yourself that this qualification only indicates that
&gt; he has demonstrated competence in the topics covered by that exam...
&gt; nothing else!!!
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;I mean 800+ and one even winged a 980 out 1000 for his effort.
&gt; So what...did they genuinely study the material?...did they have a
&gt; network at home to test their skills?...did they get experience for
&gt; the exam on the job?...did you bother asking?...in fairness I want
&gt; to point out that there are those that do formal education that are
&gt; dishonest by cheating...however they are soon found out by their
&gt; peers...what I am annoyed about is the insinuation that all those
&gt; that are prepared to work towards gaining recognised qualifications
&gt; are just...assignment swapping...brain-dumping...nerds...I suggest
&gt; you think again Ian.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;The exam they did was 70-215 Administration of 2000 Servers.
&gt; Hmmm close...#70-215..."Installing, Configuring, and Administering
&gt; Microsoft Windows 2000 Server".
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;Anybody can learn how to answer questions. To actually do the work
&gt; &lt;requires knowledge, not only skill in passing exams.
&gt; Finally a sensible comment...this is true...but how can we ensure
&gt; that a person has the stated knowledge without industry accepted
&gt; qualifications...employers could ask potential employees to take a
&gt; company prepared exam or complete specific tasks under supervision
&gt; ...in the end exams/qualifications are just tools in determining
&gt; whether a person has meet the required competence in the topics
&gt; covered by the exam...or course curriculum.
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO a broad range of IT education and experience is the best...is
&gt; there a problem because the course mentioned above is run by Microsoft?
&gt; ...would you say the same for those studying a Linux certification that
&gt; uses a similar format for testing?...hmmm I wonder...well I suppose
&gt; this is a Linux mailing list. ;o)
