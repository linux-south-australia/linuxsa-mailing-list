&gt; 
&gt;  - SirCam is yet another Outlook / Outlook Express virus which
&gt; repeatedly auto-mails itself to every address it can find. Along with
&gt; a file randomly selected from the victim's computer.
&gt; 

I read up on this virus and i would like to say that this virus doesn't
only effect people who use Outlook. It effects anyone who use Internet
Explorer and anyone who is silly enough to run the attachment.
If you look at documentation on this virus such as
<A HREF="http://vil.nai.com/vil/virusMethodOfInfection.asp?virus_k">http://vil.nai.com/vil/virusMethodOfInfection.asp?virus_k</A>=99141 you will
see that the virus is of the executable sort (not your normal Visual
Basic script) and even speaks SMTP. 
Not only does is scan the windows address book, it also scans all the
HTML files in your Internet Explorer cache. This means that unlike many
other viruses it do not depend on Outlook. Anyone who runs the file can
easily be infected and the virus will then distribute it's self without
even having to use Outlook. You are just as vulnerable if you don't run
Outlook.

As much as i don't like Microsoft, i don't like people blaming them for
ever problem under the sun. Outlook only helps this virus by hiding the
extension, which sadly many mail clients now copy. 

It won't be long (some people believe) before a lot of normal "users"
are running linux. Then these virus will no longer be restricted to the
Windows environment. None of these program require access to root
privileged information they could quite happily infect only the users
folders. 

These current viruses are only primitive compared to others that are out
there. (One for example replaces the windows TCP/IP stack so that it
intercepts all email addresses and email servers information for
example.) I just can't wait for ploymorphic viruses to start becoming
common (New Scientist just had a really good article about ploymorphic
viruses).
