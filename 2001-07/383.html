&gt; {and sharing it from the DSLAM to the Shasta unit as well}

yah :)

&gt; The trouble is that Telstra are routinely failing to meet even their
&gt; contractually committed targets on ADSL, let alone reaching a higher
&gt; standard than that.

Telstra rep called it "teething problems" and suggested it would go for the
first 12 months or so, so they should be sorted out by November or
thereabouts (uhuh...).

&gt; So the answer is that it isn't possible to predict the medium term
&gt; reliability of Telstra-wholesaled ADSL in this country at this time.
&gt; Current indications I have are that it might get worse before it gets
&gt; better.

cool...

&gt; Having said all of that, the practical outcome for real humans is
&gt; pretty smooth with ADSL, the issue is just the one you're indicating
&gt; - whether to bet your business on it.
&gt;
&gt; My suggested compromise to consider is to get the best of both
&gt; worlds. That can be done in a few ways:
&gt;
&gt; - put your business critical Internet servers into a co-location
&gt; facility with a good ISP, and use ADSL to connect to the Internet for
&gt; your own office requirements only; That means that if the ADSL is
&gt; down, your online business is not (and your performance to the
&gt; Internet for your own servers, i.e. the performance your own
&gt; customers will see, becomes stellar)

Hmm... there is little online business -- the main business that the
internet is used for is email and telnet (they don't know about ssh ... yet)
communciation, and perhaps some file transfers.

&gt; or
&gt;
&gt; - talk to an ISP about the potential to have ISDN as a backup path
&gt; along with ADSL as a primary path.
&gt; [ISDN can be set up to dial out 'on-demand' if another link fails. It
&gt; is not trivial, you should expect to pay someone to get it to work
&gt; right, but it can be made to work right if you need it to, with the
&gt; ISDN costing circa $50 per month for the socket rental plus timed
&gt; local calls during any ADSL outages].

Given that some ISPs give out timed modem accounts with their ADSL, wouldn't
it be more sensible just to use that rather than paying $lots for ISDN line,
ISP ISDN account and work to set it all up?

&gt;
&gt; Simplest (Cisco) based hardware to do that trick with at your end
&gt; would probably be a 2600 or 1700 series Cisco with an ADSL WIC and an
&gt; ISDN WIC in the same unit (though it can be done with multiple boxes,
&gt; at a higher consulting/head-scratching expense).

WIC... hmmm (/me googles) ... WAN Interface Card... just as I suspected...

ah... I see... cool...

&gt; or
&gt;
&gt; - use something else again - there are other offerings available from
&gt; other carriers, depending on where your office is (especially if it
&gt; is in the CBD), such as two megabit full duplex (and ten, and 100 and
&gt; 1000 megabit) services, with decent reliability and real SLA's.

yep, I'm talking with "other carriers" (note the plural) at the moment...
There seems to be little relationship between cost and speed ...

kinda...

costwise, it appears to be:

modem &lt; ADSL &lt; ISDN &lt; 256K fibre &lt; 2Mbit microwave

ADSL is in the wrong place here...

hmmm...

&gt; Yes, they will cost a bit more than ADSL. Did you want 'good and
&gt; fast', or 'cheap' ? :)

Good and fast and cheap :)

Tough question to answer -- they won't accept crap, they can't afford to pay
lots, and I think they want fast... I think it's time to talk to them some
more...
