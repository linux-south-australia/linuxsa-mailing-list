Martin,

Just an update on the e-book circus in the US.

Although the Russian programmer has been arrested and Adobe have made 
all sorts of dire claims on the terrible hackers here is an interesting 
POV from one commentator.

<A HREF="http://www.ebookweb.org/opinion/roger.sperberg.20010715.aebpr.htm">http://www.ebookweb.org/opinion/roger.sperberg.20010715.aebpr.htm</A>

Just how secure was the e-book and PDF security in the first place?

"And the Acrobat-certified expert cited above also wrote to me after 
seeing the article: "The eBook security is an absolute joke and is even 
weaker than the standard PDF security. One of the popular third-party 
security handlers being used was actually built using sample code from 
the Acrobat SDK. This is raw source code the whole world has access to. 
How secure is that!!! AEBPR breaks this mechanism so easily that at 
first I said to myself, that file cannot possibly be protected, but it 
was."

For this they got the guy arrested before he could get on the plane to 
go home from the conference? 

"
But there's an interesting propriety observed by the AEBPR software -- 
it won't decrypt keys for eBooks on your system if you didn't obtain 
them legally. That is, you can only make a copy of an Adobe eBook if 
you first paid for it. You can't decrypt an eBook sent to you from 
someone else."

So if it only allows you to make a (normally legal) backup of what you 
have to legally own how is it that they can have this guy arrested 
under all sorts of claims?

Maybe the Adobe family is getting a mite out of touch with the real 
world?

This will be an interesting case to watch. It could set the pattern for 
not just Adobe but other big players in the IT Industry.

Cheers,

Ian
