Hi Tim,

thanks for the speedy reply.

&lt;&lt;SO takes about 170meg as a basic instal AFAIK, so you have to sub 
that off your linux install. ie you want linux in 500meg to get some 
space spare for files and other installs you might want. 

To make the best use of space I'd suggest just the one partition for / 
and some swap. Not sure what sort of swap you can get away with but 
will probably need a minumum of 100-130 meg. depending on the ram you 
have. &gt;&gt;

At present I am only installing SO as Word and Spreadsheet to keep to 
the basic config and give more room for Linux. So far I have RH 7.1 
running GNOME and still have just on 240 M free space. 

I am running this on a P200 MMX with 64 M RAM and a 1.2 G Quantum 
drive. I have 80 Meg siphoned off as Linux Swap, the rest is root /.

So far it is working to an extent but the graphics are giving me grief, 
I get an artifact on the screen whenever I click the mouse. I think I 
prefer the KDE window, that worked fine with the same equipment. It is 
also painfully slow with most of what it does including when I start up 
Star Office.

I have tried using Kickstart but still get too much crap loading up. 
Any idea if I can cut out the garbage from a full install and somehow 
get a listing of that to build a working but thin system? Or is that 
the wrong way to go about this?

Cheers,

Ian
