Well, as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery :-)

&gt; Being a subscriber of FreeBSD Questions, I receive the regular
&gt; mailings from Greg with his suggestions on "how to get the best
&gt; results from LinuxSA". With that in mind, I've taken a lot from that
&gt; message and converted it appropriately. Thanks goes to Greg for his
&gt; efforts in making the FreeBSD Questions list a nicer place[1].

Thanks for the recognition.

&gt; This is still has a few holes the need patching up (in the form of
&gt; FIXME:'s where I didn't have the resources on me to fix them). I'd be
&gt; happy to accept contributions that cover those holes.
&gt;
&gt; How to get the best results from LinuxSA.
&gt; =========================================
&gt;
&gt; Last update 30 June 2001
&gt;
&gt; This is a regular posting to the LinuxSA mailing list. If you received
&gt; it in reply to a message you sent, it probably means the sender thinks
&gt; that at least one of the following things was wrong with your
&gt; message:

We've decided that this is probably a rather abrupt way of saying
things.  If I had the time, I'd rework this particular part of the
message.  Instead I have an Emacs macro which adds the text you see at
the top of this reply.

&gt; - You left out a subject line, or the subject line was not appropriate.
&gt; - You formatted it in such a way that it was difficult to read.
&gt; - You asked more than one unrelated question in one message.
&gt; - You sent out a message with an incorrect date, time or time zone.
&gt; - You sent out the same message more than once.
&gt; - You sent an 'unsubscribe' message to LinuxSA.
&gt;
&gt; If you have done more than one of these things, there is a good chance
&gt; that you will receive more than one copy of this message from different
&gt; people. Read on, and your next message will be more successful.

Again, all the stuff between my last comment and this needs rework,
not just here but in the original.

&gt; This document is maintained by Andrew Reid &lt;<A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>&gt;. It
&gt; was "inspired", and in many sections blatently copied from Greg
&gt; Lehey's "How to get best results from FreeBSD-questions" document,
&gt; available from <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/questions.html.">http://www.lemis.com/questions.html.</A>

&gt; I: Introduction
&gt; II: How to unsubscribe from LinuxSA
&gt; III: How to submit a question to LinuxSA
&gt; IV: How to follow up a question to LinuxSA
&gt; IV: How to answer a question to LinuxSA
&gt;
&gt; I: Introduction
&gt; ===============
&gt;
&gt; This is a regular posting aimed to help both those seeking advice from
&gt; LinuxSA (the "newcommers"), and also those who answer the questions (the
&gt; "hackers").
&gt;
&gt; Note that the term hacker has nothing to do with breaking into
&gt; other people's computers.  The correct term for the latter
&gt; activity is "cracker", but the popular press hasn't found out
&gt; yet.  The LinuxSA hackers disapprove strongly of cracking
&gt; security, and have nothing to do with it.
&gt;
&gt; In the past, there has been some friction which stems from the different
&gt; viewpoints of the two groups.

This is really a history of FreeBSD-questions.  Are you sure it
applies to LinuxSA?  It could do, but it's not as pronounced as the
issues which prompted me to write this document.

&gt; The newcommers accused the hackers of being arrogant, stuck-up, and
&gt; unhelpful, while the hackers accused the newcommers of being stupid,
&gt; unable to read plain English, and expecting everything to be handed
&gt; to them on a silver platter. Of course, there's an element of truth
&gt; in both of these claims, but for the most part these viewpoints come
&gt; from a sense of frustration.
&gt;
&gt; In this document, I'd like to do something to relieve this frustration
&gt; and help everyone get better results from LinuxSA. In the following
&gt; section, I recommend how to submit a question;

Well, no, I explain how to unsubscribe.  This sounds like a bug in my
document which you missed :-)

&gt; after that, we'll look at how to answer one.
&gt;
&gt; II: How to unsubscribe from LinuxSA
&gt; ===================================
&gt;
&gt; When you subscribed to LinuxSA, you got a welcome message from
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au.">linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au.</A>  In this message, amongst other things,
&gt; it told you how to unsubscribe.  Here's a typical message:
&gt;
&gt; FIXME: Find a subscription message and copy the appropriate bits
&gt; here.

Note also that you'll have to handle the case of current members who
received no such message.  I've just checked, and I didn't get
anything.  This will require a bit of explanation.

&gt; Generally, unsubscribing from LinuxSA is a trivial task and takes
&gt; only a few seconds of your time. In fact, the process is so short
&gt; and simple, the instructions are included at the bottom of each
&gt; message sent to <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>:
&gt;
&gt; To unsubscribe from the LinuxSA list:
&gt;  mail <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au</A> with "unsubscribe" as the
&gt;  subject
&gt;
&gt; If SmartList replies and tells you (incorrectly) that you're not on the
&gt; list, this may mean one of two things:
&gt;
&gt;  1. You have changed your mail ID since you subscribed.  That's
&gt; where keeping the original message from SmartList comes in
&gt; handy. For example, the sample message above shows my mail ID as
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx.">andrew@plug.cx.</A> Since then, I have changed it to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx.">andrew.reid@plug.cx.</A> Mail for <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx">andrew@plug.cx</A> gets shunted to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>, so asking SmartList to remove
&gt; "<A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>" from the list is going to fail, seeing as
&gt; it is not subscribed. By changing your "From" address in my mail
&gt; client's configuration to " <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx">andrew@plug.cx</A>" and sending the
&gt; unsubscribe request again, you should be more successful.

I think it looks tidier to indent the way it is in my document (that's
why it's that way :-)

  1. You have changed your mail ID since you subscribed.  That's where
     keeping the original message from SmartList comes in handy. For
     example, the sample message above shows my mail ID as
     <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx.">andrew@plug.cx.</A> Since then, I have changed it to
     <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx.">andrew.reid@plug.cx.</A> Mail for <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx">andrew@plug.cx</A> gets shunted to
     <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>, so asking SmartList to remove
     "<A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>" from the list is going to fail, seeing as
     it is not subscribed. By changing your "From" address in my mail
     client's configuration to " <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx">andrew@plug.cx</A>" and sending the
     unsubscribe request again, you should be more successful.

&gt;  2. You're subscribed to a mailing list which is subscribed to
&gt; LinuxSA. If that's the case, you'll have to figure out which one
&gt; it is and get your name taken off that one. If you're not sure
&gt; which one it might be, check the headers of the messages you
&gt; receive from LinuxSA: maybe there's a clue there.
&gt;
&gt; If you've done all this, and you still can't figure out what's going on,
&gt; send a message to <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@linuxsa.org.au">postmaster@linuxsa.org.au</A>, and he will sort things out
&gt; for you. Don't send a message to LinuxSA: they can't help you.
&gt;
&gt; III: How to submit a question to LinuxSA
&gt; ========================================
&gt;
&gt; When submitting a question to LinuxSA, consider the following points:
&gt;
&gt;  1. Remember that nobody gets paid for answering a Linux question.
&gt; They do it of their own free will. You can influence this free
&gt; will positively by submitting a well-formulated question
&gt; supplying as much relevant information as possible. You can
&gt; influence this free will negatively by submitting an incomplete,
&gt; illegible, or rude question. It's perfectly possible to send a
&gt; message to LinuxSA and not get an answer even if you follow
&gt; these rules. It's much more possible not to get an answer if you
&gt; don't. In the rest of this document, we'll look at how to get
&gt; the most out of your question to LinuxSA.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Not everybody who answers Linux questions reads every message:
&gt; they look at the subject line and decide whether it interests
&gt; them. Clearly, it's in your interest to specify a subject.
&gt; "Linux problem" or "Help" aren't enough. If you provide no
&gt; subject at all, many people won't bother reading it. If your
&gt; subject isn't specific enough, the people who can answer it may
&gt; not read it.
&gt;
&gt;  3. Format your message so that it is legible, and PLEASE DON'T
&gt; SHOUT!!!!!. We appreciate that a lot of people don't speak
&gt; English as their first language, and we try to make allowances
&gt; for that,

This is probably less the case for LinuxSA.  On FreeBSD-questions, I
frequently see people who really have difficulty with English, who
nevertheless try their best to make themselves understood.  I haven't
seen this particular problem on LinuxSA, though I'm sure we have a few
non-native English speakers.

&gt; but it is really painful to try and read a message written full of
&gt; typos or without line breaks.

We've got them :-)

&gt; A lot of badly formatted messages come from bad mailers of badly
&gt; configured mailers. The following mailers are known to send out
&gt; badly formatted messages without you finding out about them:
&gt;
&gt; Eudora
&gt; exmh
&gt; Microsoft Exchange
&gt; Microsoft Internet Mail
&gt; Microsoft Outlook
&gt; Netscape
&gt;
&gt; As you can see, the mailers in the Microsoft world are frequent
&gt; offenders. If at all possible, use a UNIX mailer.

Given that a number of people think of Linux as distinct from UNIX,
it's probably worth clarifying this issue.

&gt; If you must use a mailer under Microsoft environments, make sure its
&gt; set up correctly. Correctly can be defined as:
&gt;
&gt;  - Set to send in PLAIN TEXT and NOT HTML or RICH TEXT.
&gt;  - Set to wrap outgoing text at 72 characters.
&gt;  - Set NOT to use MIME: a lot of people use mailers which don't
&gt;    get on very well with MIME.
&gt;
&gt; For further information on this subject, check out
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/email.html.">http://www.lemis.com/email.html.</A>
&gt;
&gt;  4. Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly. This may
&gt; seem a little silly, since your message still gets there, but
&gt; many of the people who you are trying to reach get several
&gt; hundred messages a day. They frequently sort the incomming
&gt; messages by subject and date, and if your message doesn't come
&gt; before the first answer, they may assume they missed it and not
&gt; bother to look.

Specifically, to set SA time, do:

 # cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Adelaide /etc/localtime

If there are any distros of Linux which don't handle exactly this
command, please let me know.  All versions of BSD (Free, Net, Open,
/OS) handle it that way as well.

&gt;  5. Don't include unrelated questions in the same message. Firstly,
&gt; a long message tends to scare people off, and secondly, it's
&gt; more difficuly to get all the people who can answer all the
&gt; questions to read the message.
&gt;
&gt;  6. Specify as much information as possible. This is a difficult
&gt; area, and we need to expand on what information you need to
&gt; submit, but here's a start:
&gt;
&gt;  If you get error messages, don't say "I get error messages",
&gt;  say (for example), "I get the error message 'No route to
&gt;  host'".
&gt;
&gt;  If your system panics, don't say "My system panicked", say
&gt;  (for example) "My system panicked with the message "free vnode
&gt;  isn't".

This is rather BSD-specific.  Can somebody come up with a good Linux
alternative?

&gt;  If you have difficulty installing Linux, please be sure to
&gt;  tell us the following things:
&gt;
&gt;    - The distribution (ie, RedHat) and the version (ie, 7.1).
&gt;    - The hardware you have. In particular, it's important to
&gt;      know the IRQs and I/O addresses of the boards installed in
&gt;      your machine.
&gt;
&gt;  If you have difficulty getting PPP to run, describe the
&gt;  configuration. Which version of PPP do you use?

Is there more than one in Linux?  FreeBSD has both kernel (Mackerras)
and userland (awfulhak).

&gt;  What kind of authentication do you have? Do you have a static or
&gt;  dynamic IP address? What kind of messages do you get in the log
&gt;  file?  What is the version of the kernel you are running (the
&gt;  command 'uname -a' (without the quotes) will give you that
&gt;  information.
&gt;
&gt;  7. If you don't get an answer immediately, or if you don't even see
&gt; your own message appear on the list immediately, don't resend
&gt; the message. Wait at least 24 hours. The LinuxSA mailer takes a
&gt; little while to distribute the emails to the subscribees. Once
&gt; the message does get through, the person who might know the
&gt; answer may not be at his desk and not able to answer the email.
&gt;
&gt;  8. If you do all this, and you still get no answer, there could be
&gt; other reasons. For example, the problem is so compilcated 

Oops.  Is that my typo?

&gt; that nobody knows the answer, or the person who does know the answer
&gt; is offline. If you don't get an answer after, say, a week, it might
&gt; help to resend the message. If you don't get an answer to your
&gt; second message, though, your're probably not going to get one from
&gt; this forum. Resending the same message again and again will only
&gt; make you unpopular.
&gt;
&gt;  9. Keep your question on-topic. This is a Linux list, so don't go
&gt; asking people what breed of dog you should buy, what mobile
&gt; phone is best or where the cheapeset fuel is today. It's not
&gt; appropriate here. That said, if it can somehow be related to
&gt; Linux, it's probably going to be received well.

*sigh* The silly thing is, people do ask about mobile phones, and
judging by the response, the question isn't that unwelcome.  In the
FreeBSD lists we have a different issue: we have something like 50
lists, of which 30 are moribund (we just can't be bothered to bury
them), but we have another list (FreeBSD-chat) for questions of this
nature.  LinuxSA only has one list, so it's probably a matter of
discussion as to whether these questions are admissible or not.  I
strongly suspect that it also depends on who asks the question.  If
it's a well-known and well-respected person, they'll get away with
it.  If a newbie asks the same question, he'll be scampering for his
asbestos underwear.

&gt; Examples of questions that aren't directly Linux-related but are
&gt; generally accepted as "OK" are:
&gt;
&gt;  - "What hardware should I buy for my Linux machine?"
&gt;  - "Telstra have tried to screw us again, can they do that?"

Always fair game :-)

&gt;  - "XYZ Unix Application isn't working. &lt;!-- Necessary details
&gt;    ommitted --&gt;. Can someone suggest a way to get it working?"
&gt;  - "Microsoft is saying evil things about the way the Linux
&gt;     world works. Do they have any factual basis for such
&gt;     comments?"

Reject this one.  Everybody knows they don't have any valid reasons.

&gt; To summarize, let's assume you know the answer to the following question
&gt; (yes, it's the same on in each case :-). You choose which of these two
&gt; questions you would be more prepared to answer:
&gt;
&gt; Message 1:
&gt; Subject: (none)
&gt;
&gt; I just can't get hits damn silly Kinxu system to workd, amd Im really
&gt; good at tsis stuff, but i have never seen antyhing sho difficult to
&gt; intsll, it jsut wont owrk whateer I try so whty dont y9ou guts tell me
&gt; what i doing wrong.

In the original, this was all on one line.  Yes, I know it's
difficult, but if an idiot can do it, we should find a way too.

&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Message 2:
&gt; Subject: Problems installing RedHat Linux 7.2
&gt;
&gt; I've just got the RedHat Linux 7.2 CD-ROM from NetCraft, and I'm having
&gt; a lot of difficulty installing it. I have a 66 MHz 486 with 16MB of
&gt; memory and an Adaptec 1540A SCSI board, a 1.2GB Quantum Fireball disk
&gt; and a Toshiba 3501XA CD-ROM drive. The installation works just fine, but
&gt; when I try to reboot the system, I get the message "Missing Operating
&gt; System".
&gt;
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; IV: How to follow up a question to LinuxSA
&gt; ==========================================
&gt;
&gt; Often you will want to send in additional information to a question you
&gt; have already sent. The best way to do this is to reply to your original
&gt; message. This has three advantages:
&gt;
&gt;  1. You include the original message text, so people will know what
&gt; you're talking about. Don't forget to trim the unnecessary text
&gt; out though.
&gt;
&gt;  2. The text in the subject line stays the same (you did remember to
&gt; put one in, didn't you?). Many mailers will sort messages by
&gt; subject. This helps group messages together.
&gt;
&gt;  3. The message reference numbers in the header will refer to the
&gt; previous message. Some mailers, such as mutt, can thread
&gt; messages, showing the exact relationships between the messages.
&gt;
&gt; V: How to answer a quetsion to LinuxSA
&gt; ======================================
&gt;
&gt; Before you answer a question to LinuxSA, consider:
&gt;
&gt;  1. A lot of the points on submitting questions also apply to
&gt; answering questions. Read them.
&gt;
&gt;  2. Has somebody already answered the question? The easiest way to
&gt; check this is to sort your incomming mail by subject: then
&gt; (hopefully) you'll see the question followed by any answers, all
&gt; together.
&gt;
&gt; If somebody has already answered it, it doesn't automatically
&gt; mean that you shouldn't send another answer. But it makes sense
&gt; to read all the other answers first.

Which (mea culpa) I haven't done this time.  This looks like a real
bikeshed.

&gt;  3. Do you have something to contribute beyond what has already
&gt; been said? In general, "Yeah, me too" answers don't help much,
&gt; although there are exceptions, like when somebody is describing
&gt; a problem he's having, and he doesn't know whether there's
&gt; something wrong with the hardware or software.  If you do send a
&gt; "me too" answer, you should also include any further relevant
&gt; information.
&gt;
&gt;  4. Are you sure you understand the question? Very frequently, the
&gt; person who asks the question is confused and doesn't express
&gt; himself very well. Even with the best understanding of the
&gt; system, it's easy to send a reply which doesn't answer the
&gt; question. This doesn't help: you'll heave the person who
&gt; submitted the question more frustrated or confused than ever. If
&gt; nobody else answers, and your not too sure either, you can
&gt; always ask for more information.
&gt;
&gt;  5. Are you sure you answer is correct? If not, wait a day or so. If
&gt; nobody else comes up with a better answer, you can still reply
&gt; and say, for example, "I don't know if this is correct, but
&gt; since nobody else has replied, why don't you try replacing your
&gt; ATAPI CD-ROM with a frog?".
&gt;
&gt;  6. Unless there's a good reason to do otherwise, reply to the
&gt; sender and LinuxSA. Many people on the LinuxSA list are
&gt; "lurkers": they learn by reading messages sent and replied to by
&gt; others. If you take a message which is of general interest off
&gt; the list, you're depriving these people of their information. Be
&gt; careful with hundreds of CCs. If this is the case, be sure to
&gt; trim the Cc: lines appropriately.

Since I wrote this, I've learnt a thing or two:

1.  Not everybody wants to be copied on the reply.  Some people
    specifically put Reply-To: headers in their mail excluding them,
    so that they don't get two copies.  I think we should respect
    these wishes.  I'm personally of the opposite opinion: mutt and
    other MUAs flag things addressed specifically to me, so I can pick
    them out of my 1500 odd mail messages per day more easily.

2.  It's possible to avoid multiple copies of a single mail message
    with procmail.  I've got the incantations at home (I'm currently
    in Adelaide's sister city, Austin TX), but will produce on
    request.

The document should reflect these issues.  When you're done, I'll
filter them back into the FreeBSD version.

&gt;  7. Include relevant text from the original message. Trim it to the
&gt; minimum, but don't overdo it. It should still be possible for
&gt; somebody who didn't read the original message to understand what
&gt; your're talking about.
&gt;
&gt;  8. Use some technique to identify which text came from the original
&gt; message, and which text you add. I personally find that
&gt; prepending "&gt; " to the original message works best. Leaving
&gt; whitespace after the "&gt; " and leave empty lines between your
&gt; text and the original text both make the result more readable.
&gt;
&gt;  9. Put your response in the correct place (after the text to which
&gt; it replies). It's very difficult to read a thread of responses
&gt; where each reply comes before the text to which it replies.

I wonder if we should make this stronger.  I've seen so many
conflicting techniques that it might be worth explaining how confusing
it can be if each correspondent uses a different quoting method.

&gt;  10. Most mailers change the subject line on a reply by prepending a
&gt; text such as "Re: ". If you're mailer doesn't do it automatically,
&gt; you should do it manually.
&gt;
&gt;  11. If the submitter didn't abide by formatting conventions (lines
&gt; too long, HTML/RTF, innapropriate subject line), please fix it.
&gt; In the case of an incorrect subject line (such as "HELP!!??"),
&gt; change the subject line to (say) "Re: Difficulties with sync PPP
&gt; (was: HELP!!??)". That way other people trying to follow the
&gt; thread will have less difficulty following it.
&gt;
&gt; In such cases, it's appropriate to say what you did and why you
&gt; did it, but try not to be rude. If you find you can't answer
&gt; without being rude, don't answer.
&gt;
&gt; If you just want to reply to a message because of its bad
&gt; format, just reply to the submitter, not to the list. You can
&gt; just send him this message in reply, if you like.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;---- Snip here.
&gt;
&gt; Please let me know what you think. If there are no objections to the
&gt; principle in general, I'll set a deadline of Wednesday, 5 July 2001 for
&gt; submissions for changes.

Hmm.  I don't see any particular hurry.  Looking at my thread tree,
this seems to have generated a considerable amount of, um, interest.

&gt; As of Thursday, 6 July 2001, this email (in its current or modified
&gt; form) will be sent out on a monthly basis to <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A> by a
