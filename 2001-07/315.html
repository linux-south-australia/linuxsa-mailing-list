Why not? Do we really want this list full of Grandmas trying to use Linux
to send photos to their grand-kids?

I've been using Linux since before distributions existed, and I don't
understand this business driven incentive to advertise Linux to the
unwashed masses. The survival of Linux doesn't depend on anything that
can be measured in business terms.

It doesn't matter if Linux was never advertised. It doesn't matter if
Linux never makes money. It doesn't matter if half the world died and
dropped off the planet. All Linux needs is 100 good people who are
interested in it, and it'll keep on progressing just fine.

Guess what - it already has that 100 people, and lots more besides.

For some reason, slashdot.org and other company owned Linux websites
have managed to convince people to view Linux in business terms. Why?

Probably because they're running in a traditional business model which
measures its own survival by rate of uptake and numbers of new customers.

The people who write the articles pushing the Linux from the business
perspective are the same people who get paid by a traditional business
model. The fact of the matter is that people who are paid to work on
Linux are not part of the model that makes Linux what it is.

Take every business funded Linux venture and close them all down. Put a
bullet through the head of every management type there, and not a great
deal would happen.

Of course there would be endless stories about the demise of the world,
pictures at 11, and all that crap on all the websites as the Rob Malda's
found their Porsche funds disappearing.

Unless we shoot them too. Not a bad idea, really.

Being nice to newbies is advertising. It's an implicit promise that
things will be nice and rosey and all will be sweet. It's a way of
sucking them into buying into the product.

It's a lie. Linux doesn't need these people. The companies do.

So why not dispense with all the business models, all the traditional
advertising ploys, all the company spin, all the lies and deceptions
that form today's common business practices and get back to our real
origins...

  "Show us the code."

And a hearty "FUCK OFF" to all the newbies who can't figure things out
for themselves. Can't figure out HTML mail? This isn't for you, baby.

Linux became what it is today on this basis.

Not the propagandist business shit from the Redhats of the world.

There's no Microsoft vs Linux battle. There's no mighty fight between
two behemoths. Linux isn't an underdog struggling to survive.

Linux companies vs Microsoft... yes.

Linux vs Microsoft... no.
