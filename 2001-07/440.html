&gt; Your XML is not well-formed. It should look
&gt; something more like:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;shameless_plug
&gt;
I_hope_this_wont_start_another_endless_flame_war="1"&gt;
&gt;                                                     

Forgive me, I should be wearing "L" plates :-) (too
many HTML bad habits...)

&lt;snipped&gt;

&gt; I've found that the brand-name PCs have less
&gt; hardware-related faults
&gt; than the generic "Leader PC".

I guess that depends on the quality / ethics of
whoever built it. I personally build about one PC a
month, and am thus able to take the time to hand-craft
them and test them, not to mention the time required
to properly integrate all the Windoze device drivers
(most of my clients require MS on the desktop I'm
afraid) But then I am not competing with 25 clone
shops and 5 multinational companies either.

&gt; The brand-name PCs
&gt; that I've worked with have been extremely reliable,
&gt; well built and easy
&gt; to work on, which is more than what can be said
&gt; about the crud that
&gt; comes out of a certain South Australian computer
&gt; wholesaler/manufacturer.

&lt;snipped&gt;

I cant comment, other than the fact that I have
installed couple of hundred brand name PCs for
PC-newbies in the past, and apart from the shameless
attempt by the manufacturers to lure "nusers" to their
own websites by having unprogrammable Internet
keyboards, dont seem to be any better or worse, unless
you count fancier colour and shape of the casings and
extra USB and audio connectors as a plus.

Of course, then you get some brand name PCs which
require "star" shaped screw drivers to open the back
of the case, and others with hidden "secret catches"
that require a degree in lateral thinking and the
ability to think of new uses for tools to get open...

And of course they try and get you to buy brand name
memory upgrades when you can purchase standard SDRAM
from anywhere at half the price

&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt; For example, a reasonably solid
&gt; understanding of
&gt; TCP/IP networking will make you a lot more useful
&gt; than if you were to
&gt; have only the RedHat Qualification.

Of course, the only way to present that in a CV is to
say "Experienced in internet protocols" and hope the
HR person reading it knows what that means...
