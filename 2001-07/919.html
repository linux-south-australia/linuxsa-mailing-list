&gt; (note of course, that running `nmap localhost` is completely different to
&gt; running `nmap &lt;hostname&gt;`, as localhost refers to the lo (127.0.0.1)
&gt; interface, whereas &lt;hostname&gt; is (usually) your eth0.

Also bear in mind the type of nmap you run - if you're only blocking (for
instance) initial TCP packets with SYN set, and you're running something
other than a "connect" (SYN) type scan, it will report accurately the ports
that are open from RSTs sent back (but there are ways around this too).

&gt; (I always wondered why 3128 is the standard -- is that a pre-squid,
&gt; cache-standard thing?)

I think that's just a squid thing - 8080 was traditionally used for non-root
owned web servers (back when running web servers was less fashionable).

&gt; On the box in question, I had ipchained it so that external IP addresses
&gt; couldn't connect to squid at all. I could nmap it from a remote host, and
&gt; would find that 8080 was closed. However, when my friend nmapped, he got
&gt; 8080 open, and could seemingly get anywhere using that proxy...

Same problem here - our provider transparently proxies port 80, so any
scans I conduct against clients (hey, _legitimately_  :-) always show as
port 80 being open.  I'm wondering if you can still get an IP feed that
doesn't have transparent proxying of some sort on it.

&gt; actually interacting with that proxy, and not mine... To be honest, I'm not
&gt; 100% sure that this is the case, but I have no better explanation...

Easy to check - use the logs, Luke! (er, I meant Richard).
