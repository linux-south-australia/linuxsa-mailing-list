Hello,

I recently asked a question about capturing a SYN packet.

That was actually an incorrect dirscription (almost) of what I want to do.

According to RFC-793: After a SYN-SENT state from client to server the
server responds with a SYN-RECEIVED event that includes (SEQ, ACK, and CTL)
and then awaits ESTABLISHMENT from client containing (SEQ, ACK, and CTL).

The thing is I want to be able to Enter wait state and accept ALL
SYN-SENT(s) to a server from client.  Then I need to do the following:

1) grab and log origin IP to cache upon SYN-SENT reception.
2) Hold SYN packet.
3) Transmit SYN-RECEIVED.
4) Close connection and Enter wait state.
5) If SYN-RECEIVED/ESTABLISHED received from client then match to IP and
held SYN Packet
6) If all is good then pass session to FIREWALL and close connection.
        else
                add IP to bad IP DB (to refuse future connections) drop and
flush all packet info and close connection.

This would probably all need to be done prior to TCP connection (thus more
difficult to implement) and could be accomplised in a proxy fashion in that
once the SYN is complete the proxy could do a SYN to TCP using the original
packets from client (the only problem here is the sequence numbers need to
be matched in some way).

In this fashion TCP would be buffered from un-acknowledged SYN(s) (used
mostly in DOS attacks) and thus speed the function of TCP while reducing
uncompleted connection attempts.

The easier method would be for TCP to handle ALL initial SYN requests and
then have all passed to syn proxy.  Once all is good then have the session
passed to firewall.  This way TCP would not need to be circumvented.  I
believe this would work better as the initial SYN would be handled by TCP
thus taking a load off the proxy.

Below is a diagram of what I am looking to do compared to present situation.

Present:

      client
server/deamon

  1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN/httpd

  2.  SYN-SENT    --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;               --&gt;
SYN-RECEIVED/httpd

  3.  ESTABLISHED &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;ACK=101&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt;  &lt;--
SYN-RECEIVED/httpd(open and waiting)

  4.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;       --&gt;
ESTABLISHED/httpd(open port)

  5.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;&lt;DATA&gt; --&gt;
ESTABLISHED/httpd(open port)


with proxy


       client
server/deamon

  1.  CLOSED                                               LISTEN/proxy

  2.  SYN-SENT    --&gt; &lt;SEQ=100&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN&gt;               --&gt;
SYN-RECEIVED/proxy

  3.  ESTABLISHED &lt;-- &lt;SEQ=300&gt;&lt;ACK=101&gt;&lt;CTL=SYN,ACK&gt;  &lt;--
SYN-RECEIVED/proxy (no open port)

  4.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;       --&gt;
ESTABLISHED/proxy-&gt;firewall(open port)

  5.  ESTABLISHED --&gt; &lt;SEQ=101&gt;&lt;ACK=301&gt;&lt;CTL=ACK&gt;&lt;DATA&gt; --&gt;
ESTABLISHED/firewall(open port)

If you notice in the first diagram the port is open as soon as the SYN-ACK
(step 3) is sent by the server (start of DOS attack).  If no recieve is sent
back from client that port is open until it times out.  Multiply this by all
the infected systems used to attack a server and that is a lot of open ports
that will swamp a server.

In the second diagram the ports remain free due to the use of the proxy.
There are NO open ports until the SYN is completed (step 4) and then all
session info is passed to the firewall using the original session info.
Thus any ports opened through the firewall a KNOWN good sessions (unless the
client issues a SYN-RST) and all DOS attempts have the IP logged and the
session drop and purged.

SO, I have the initial proxy done.  I just need to get it to accept the SYN
packets and then log or throw away as necessary and then pass the connection
upon completion of SYN.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
