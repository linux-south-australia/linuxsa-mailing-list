&gt; Jul 18 17:37:20 linux-pdc kernel: memory : 00000000
&gt; Jul 18 17:37:20 linux-pdc kernel: memory : c3115da0

I can't find what these refer to, but they surely are significant...


&gt; Jul 18 17:54:08 linux-pdc kernel: eth0: Too much work at interrupt, IntrStatus=0x0001.

This shows that your machine was flooded with packets.



&gt; Jul 18 19:20:30 linux-pdc login: FAILED LOGIN 1 FROM /dev/tty1 FOR root, Authentication failure

This would normally indicate that somebody was sitting at the machine, trying
to log in as root.  Later, though:

&gt; Jul 18 19:22:53 linux-pdc init: Id "2" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes

This says that the getty on the second console screen keeps exiting,
and there's nothing in the log (that you showed us) to indicate why.
Most curious.


I did hear an unsubstantiated rumour, from somebody who has a reputation
for being less than truthful, of a kernel bug in Red Hat systems, which
would let people gain root access via the network.  Let me repeat that
this was (supposedly) a kernel level bug, affecting Red Hat systems only.
The person refused to divulge any further details and probably was lying,
except that somebody else, admittedly from a rival linux distribution, did
tell me something about Red Hat systems which sounded slightly similar.


Do you think it's possible somebody really was sitting at your machine
at those times?  It is the immediate conclusion, but given the network
link I would count on it.
