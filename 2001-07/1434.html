Dale!

&gt; What areas have you used XFS in?

I am currently using it exclusively on my home machines, especially for
my second machine which has an elusive kernel bug that every now and
then just causes it to hard freeze. Worldwide, though, there are a
significant number of people using it in production and I am probably
going to install it onto one site that I work for.

Others have reported that it works well with Samba 2.2.1 ACL's, that it
doesn't fall over NFS (which, by the way, it doesn't) and that it is an
all-round good file system except for doing mass deletes of little
files. It does currently have a very slight issue with software RAID-5
but there are bug fixes/patches already in existence to fix that.

&gt; Is the dump program a part of the XFS package, or is it a project which is
&gt; similar to the ext2 dump on sourceforge?

It's integrated closely with the XFS file system itself but is bundled
as a separate package. It seems to have the same team of developers.

Essentially, during  a recent discussion the XFS Linux File System on
disk is _almost_ the same as the XFS Irix File System, that is to say
the structures it uses aren't at all different. Naturally, calls to get
the VFS working with it are different as you'd expect and there'd be
lower level differences but the actual storage format is the same.

I seem to recall reading in an FAQ that if you ran Linux on an SGI box
and you got the settings for XFS correct on Linux you could literally
plug the two drives from one operating system to the other without
loading any extra modules and so forth.

&gt; Could you let me know the URL of the main XFS (for Linux) site?

It's worth a look :-)
