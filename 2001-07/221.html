&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;Is that like saying you'd rather keep the list content relevant to
&gt;linux/opensource matters?

Well that is what it's for isn't it...

&gt;
&gt;You could start another list... maybe one with a more techinal bent and
&gt;then you could unsubscribe from this one which you dont seem to like in
&gt;its current form.
&gt;
&gt;Try egroups...

That is probably the most stupid paragraph of text I have ever read on this 
list... exactly what do you think this list is for if it's not for technical 
matters?
&gt;
&gt;Personally I suspect the rash of unsubscribes today are probably related,
&gt;so your probably not the only one who hates these endless threads and
&gt;would prefer a more focussed list.

So.... have you noticed that most of those that unsubscribed almost never 
post to this list.. and the only reason that you saw those unsubscribes was 
because they stuffed up and didn't send the message correctly........

What you fail to see Jason is that say someone like Mark does unsubscribe, 
and say all the tech people unsubscribe, then what becomes of this list... 
&lt;generalisation&gt; absent minded people that continually fuel constant flame 
wars and never ever answer any questions or answer very few 
&lt;/generalisation&gt; After all if all the tech minded people leave who is going 
to answer the questions, personally I believe that people like Mark are an 
asset to this list...

Having been the receiver of flames before and having been the accidental 
starter of some flame wars in the past I have had my fair share but what you 
said in this email is downright STUPID so how about you listen to Mark and 
SHUT UP AND STOP FUELING THE FIRE.

Oh and while I am at it, either fix your typing skills or remap your 
keyboard, your spelling is absolutely stupifying sometimes... now how do you 
like being on the end of a flame... Mark's message was not personal, he sent 
it as a generalised request... YOU made it personal.

Feel free to flame away but TAKE IT OFF LIST or redirect it to /dev/null

- Michael
