&gt; 72 is the standard. Why you have to have your mailer set to be two
&gt; characters outside that standard is beyond me.

Blame Redhat. Which RFC defines that standard?

&gt; That's like Microsoft inventing compatibility between "&lt;gtml&gt;" and
&gt; "&lt;html&gt;" and claiming that anyone that can't live with "&lt;gtml&gt;" has got
&gt; a problem.

&gt; Standards are there for a reason. I'd appreciate it if you used them.

Well duh. Just don't mouth off like a prima donna. HTML is one thing.
Wrapping at 74 or 72 is another.

&gt; &gt; It seems to be an issue to some.
&gt; 
&gt; If they'd all like to step forward, I'm happy to talk to them. There's
&gt; only a handful of participants in this thread. Last I heard, we've got
&gt; over 600 subscribers. That's not a large percentage.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is hardly any effort. Others have their opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; But, Dale. Honestly. Why? Why on earth do you see it as necessary? There
&gt; is precious-little HTML mail ariving at the doorstep of LinuxSA. How do
&gt; you justify the need?
&gt; 
&gt; Answers like "Because we can" don't count. You know that.

Because it will help the list. It is a nice little programming challenge.
We can see how well it can be done. Other may have a use for it.
Even if it works with one mail per month it has done its job.
It will be a fun bit of code to work with. It will give this list
something else to flame about. It will hopefully  stop the boring carry
ons over HTML email.

Dale.
