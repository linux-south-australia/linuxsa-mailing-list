&gt; I don't mean to be the devils advocate here, however, I have been on this
&gt; mailling list for on 2 years I would think now (on and off).
&gt; I seem to have re-subscribed in the middle of a huge flame war where people
&gt; dont like HTML/newbies on "the linuxsa" mail list.
&gt; Which on a side note, seems to happen atleast once every 3 months.

I don't think it's what you'd call a flame war. People don't have a
problem with "newbies", but they -do- have a problem with HTML. It just
happens to be that the two go "hand in hand". 

&gt; Dare I say it, What makes us (me included) better than the newbies out
&gt; there who don't know how to use "elm" or "pine" for example
&gt; and post HTML based email? Or the user who asks how to login as root? No
&gt; offence, I understand that there is a wealth of knowledge
&gt; out there, we have SAMBA programmers, Im sure there are kernel hackers and
&gt; who knows what else.

Nobody is saying that they are better than everyone else because they
don't post in HTML. They are saying "Don't post in HTML or I'm not going
to help you". That's not an unreasonable request at all.

Those of us who make up the "wealth of knowledge" don't have time for
messages that don't display, wrap or quote properly. Ask in plain-text
and you'll almost always get a response.

&gt; The whole idea behind "OpenSource" software is the joint sharing of
&gt; knowledge. Seperate this list into four or even two, what will you get?

For a start, you're not going to have as many knowledgable people on
each list. The whole idea of a seperate list for "newbies" is obsurd.
Possibly a "LinuxSA-chat" mailing list would be of some benefit, but
even that I'd question.

&gt; You will have a list of people who need help mailling one or two people who
&gt; have the time and desire to help. The thing I have noticed
&gt; is how many people are saying "ill cc both", "ill read both lists" etc etc.
&gt; Ill be blunt, thats crap. If you were happy to do that, you would
&gt; have just as much email as you do now, you wouldnt have to manually sort it
&gt; however but you would still have to deal with HTML email
&gt; and "newbie" posts therefore you might read it one month or so when you
&gt; feel with it.

Yup. That's the main issue. I just can't see there being an array of
"experts" with knowledge diverse enough to cater for the needs of the
"newbies". You're most likely to end up with a bunch of "newbies"
sitting all alone in the "LinuxSA-newbies" list with no support.

&gt; I know there are a lot of people are out there who do help on this list. I
&gt; know that from first hand knowledge. But its the old story,
&gt; "out of sight, out of mind".

I don't think their is any attempt to push "newbies" away from LinuxSA,
I think it's the opposite. I just can't see the majority of the
knowledgable people being bothered subscribing to a "newbies" list.

&gt; You break a community up into a "newbie" and a "geek" group. What do you
&gt; end up with, you end up with a few scenarios. People will
&gt; get sick of posting to the "newbies" list because no one replies and you
&gt; end up with the same problem we have now. People are
&gt; too scared to post to the "geek" list in the fear of being flammed to
&gt; death. People start posting to the "geek" list thinking they are "all
&gt; that".

Um, no. "newbies" DO NOT get flamed to death here. Certain members of
the community have been misinturpreted and branded "flamers". The
majority of "newbies" on this list are helped and not flamed.

&gt; What do you gain? Makes your life easier? Is that worth breaking up a
&gt; community?

I think you've picked up the wrong end of the stick. The idea of a
seperate list (as pointless as it is) is not to prevent "newbies" from
bothering the "gurus". It's a concept designed to provide better help
for "newbies". Unfortunately, it wouldn't work.

&gt; I personally completely support this mailling list and organisation in its
&gt; current form. I believe its the best way of sharing knowledge,
&gt; sharing ideas and projects.

Me too. The structure of this list is fine.

&gt; .....and yes, I have to manually sort every email every morning... Im happy
&gt; with that, because I'll actually read the email now and might
&gt; be able to help the user now, not in a month when I get board.

Er, OK. Personally, I sort my mail automatically into folders, making
dealing with 600 messages a day a lot easier. I still manage to read
LinuxSA posts within the hour, most of the time.
