&gt; Excuse my ignorance, but what's static RAM?

DRAM is dynamic RAM.  It loses it's value after a relatively short time,
and so needs to be refreshed by regular reading and writing.  Refresh
cycles do slow it down.  I haven't looked closely enough since the late
70's, at which time CPU bus access was interleaved with on-board refresh
circuits, which scanned through RAM reading and writing every location.
That's probably now done on chip.

Static RAM does not require refresh.  It maintains value for as long
as power is supplied, and it uses more gates than DRAM.  I don't
know why DRAM is slower than SRAM.  Maybe because of the capacitor.
(Just a guess.)

&gt; Is it faster/slower then the stuff they stick on video cards at the
&gt; moment...

Actually it's slower, but that's because (high end) video cards use
dual port ram, which makes a big impact.  One port is used by the video
display circuit and the other is used by the CPU, and both ports work
independantly and concurrently.  Regular RAM has only one port which
is shared by the CPU and video circuits.

There are issues relating to the way RAM is accessed that can make single
port RAM even slower than you might expect: DRAM is internally organised
into rows and columns, and to access a cell you specify the column,
and then the row.  Old DRAM required a wait between the two addresses
(precharge time); then it was changed so that you could keep a page open
and avoid the precharge time (but only access cells in that column); then
you could open two pages; which I think is current state of the art for
DRAM.  If you only have one port, and the video circuit is sequentially
reading all of it 70 times per second, obviously the CPU is going to
have a hard time keeping the page open that it's trying to write to.

The latest in RAM is an IP fight between Rambus, who invented RDRAM,
and other chip makers who use DDO DRAM.  RDRAM uses a packet format,
and achieves very high performance by transferring much more than a
single byte per packet, and also by transferring on rising as well
as falling clock edges.  DDO DRAM apparently violates Rambus's IP, by
also transferring on the rising and falling edges of the clock, but I
believe DDO is otherwise fairly conventional.  Intel support Rambus, and
P4 systems are likely to use it.  I don't know who will win; there's a
lot at stake since current systems are very much held back by relatively
slow RAM speeds.  (Ever wondered what the BIOS choice, of two or three
wait states for RAM access, means in terms of performance?  *Zero* is
what you really want.)
