Hi All,

I would like to briefly comment on remarks made recently by Adam
and Ian regarding formal education.

Adam said:
&lt;Yes this is a problem with the whole UAI/TER system.
&lt;I could not know a thing about computers and get into computer
&lt;science,
So what...sure...previous computer knowledge is an advantage
...however it is not...nor should it be...a mandatory requirement
to be accepted into the Computer Science course...it is far more
important that the student has a genuine interest in IT...and the
right attitude to learning.

&lt;pass the courses and still know nothing about how to put a PC
&lt;together and yada yada.
Once again...so what...take a good look at the curriculum...it is
focused mainly on software design and development...although I do
agree that getting some basic knowledge on hardware components is
well worth while...IMHO this is not a course designed for those who
wish to be computer technicians.

Ian said:
&lt;Same with the MCP.
&lt;I can speak with painful experience. Recently several nerds with
&lt;very little experience,
IT encompasses a broad range of technical fields...I am yet to meet
anyone who is competent in all of them...hence I am very careful
before making judgments...like the above...about others...maybe you
should be too...or are you that confident in your own ability.

&lt;one had only used Windows 3.11 until he started the course, passed
&lt;the MCP with flying colours.
So what...did you know that he only required a pass in one exam to
get MCP status...hardly a challenge...it should have been obvious to
someone such as yourself that this qualification only indicates that
he has demonstrated competence in the topics covered by that exam...
nothing else!!!

&lt;I mean 800+ and one even winged a 980 out 1000 for his effort.
So what...did they genuinely study the material?...did they have a
network at home to test their skills?...did they get experience for
the exam on the job?...did you bother asking?...in fairness I want
to point out that there are those that do formal education that are
dishonest by cheating...however they are soon found out by their
peers...what I am annoyed about is the insinuation that all those
that are prepared to work towards gaining recognised qualifications
are just...assignment swapping...brain-dumping...nerds...I suggest
you think again Ian.

&lt;The exam they did was 70-215 Administration of 2000 Servers.
Hmmm close...#70-215..."Installing, Configuring, and Administering
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server".

&lt;Anybody can learn how to answer questions. To actually do the work
&lt;requires knowledge, not only skill in passing exams.
Finally a sensible comment...this is true...but how can we ensure
that a person has the stated knowledge without industry accepted
qualifications...employers could ask potential employees to take a
company prepared exam or complete specific tasks under supervision
...in the end exams/qualifications are just tools in determining
whether a person has meet the required competence in the topics
covered by the exam...or course curriculum.

IMHO a broad range of IT education and experience is the best...is
there a problem because the course mentioned above is run by Microsoft?
...would you say the same for those studying a Linux certification that
uses a similar format for testing?...hmmm I wonder...well I suppose
this is a Linux mailing list. ;o)

Regards,
Richard Watkins
