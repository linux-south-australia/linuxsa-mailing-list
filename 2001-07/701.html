Hi list,

I am the volunteer IT Support for the Salisbury North Neighbourhood 
Network. We are a community group working under the auspices of the 
City of Salisbury. We run a unique program to refurbish computers, 
train volunteers in their use, provide them with a system / MS Office / 
Internet / Printer etc and then allow registered members of the public 
to access the systems in the volunteer's home or in a couple of public 
places such as a Footy Club or Neighbourhood House. 

The aim of the Project is to break down the serious digital divide in 
our community. Latest survey shows about 7% of the 12.5K residents in 
our suburb have access to the Internet either through work or at home.

OK, enough background. Up until now we have been working with older 
systems and have had enough copies of the MS 95 OS to install and run 
with. That source of licensed OS's is drying up faster than we can fit 
them to computers so we are looking to use Linux as the OS as well as 
Star Office as the application package. We hope to be able to sell off 
some of the lower spec donated computers to fund the rest of the 
Project.

Our average system is a P166 with usually 64 or 32 M RAM, 1.2 G drive 
and floppy/CD/keyboard/mouse etc. Some of the systems are P133's, a few 
are P100's

So far I have tried Red Hat 7.1 and Mandrake 8.0 with limited success. 
Shortly (once it dl's) I will be trying the Peanut distro to see if 
their claimed 148M space is enough to work the rest in. Fitting the OS 
onto the small space as well as leaving enough room for Star Office is 
the major problem.

The other biggie is that the users are in many cases going to be 
computer illiterate and will need to get basic computer training as 
well as training in Linux and Star Office. We can do that but the 
systems will still need to be stable and dead simple in operation.

Any constructive advice is welcomed and appreciated. 

If there are any experienced Linux users in the vicinity of Salisbury 
North reading this your physical help to get this project under way 
would be much appreciated. I can offer free coffee and loads of 'fun' 
with old computers &lt;G&gt;

I am also on the lookout for 2nd hand 72pin EDO RAM to fit into these 
machines so they can all have a minimal level of 64M RAM.

 Ian Loxton,
 on behalf of the
 Salisbury North Neighbourhood Network
