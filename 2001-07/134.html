&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;Except that newbies are more likely to use email than
&gt;news - if you restrict the newsgroups distribution, then
&gt;they will only be able to post to one or two servers,
&gt;whereas email they can send from anywhere.

That is unless you use a dual webnews/NNTP service, one of the "closed" news 
groups that I am subscribed to does this and it is really good... When one 
has access to say netscape or IE then one can use the NNTP, and when one is 
unable to use that, the newsgroups can be accessed through a webpage, 
postings can also be made through the webpage. Its really good.

I was thinking about this kind of thing for linuxsa a while back when like 
40-50 mails were coming in in one day, I don't mind it because I use this 
hotmail account just for linuxsa, so it does not interfere with my other 
email, however some of you poor sods must get sick of getting that many 
emails in a day to your primary mail box.

A news server could solve that problem for the 'advanced list' as most 
likely [generalisation] everyone here knows how and what 'news' is 
[/generalisation] so if we have a 'new to linuxsa' list then maybe that 
could be email based, and the 'advanced linuxsa' we could move to a news 
service or something!!!! just my thoughts anyway......
