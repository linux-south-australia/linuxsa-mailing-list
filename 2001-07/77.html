Richard!

&gt; surely trying this would be trivial, David... (unless you have no NFS
&gt; mounted directories)...

Yes, I now realise what was actually wrong. I have a BSD box which I run
as my X Server. I decided that it would be "funky" although "pointless"
to use its Netscape instead of my main machines (1). I had made a
symlink to /mnt/home/lloy0076/.netscape and couldn't cd into it or
anything.

It turns out that after reading the man pages multiple times that I have
to either have the same *ID's as the main machine or somehow squash my
effective *ID to my main machines. FreeBSD has lloy0076 as UID 1000
whilst Linux starts at 500; hence I was being mapped as the nobody user
who, for reasons obvious, couldn't cd into mnt/home/lloy0076.

However, I could symlink to the directory (crazy; I can create symlinks
that I clearly was not permitted to use).

Hence, a reconfiguration of my NFS server to squash the anonymous user
to lloy0076, UID 500 fixed my apparent problem.

&gt; ABAS (a bit about symlinks): they are just textual references to other files
&gt; on the filesystem. Hard links are not, hence you couldn't do that with
&gt; hardlinks.

Thanks!

I'm just a beginner with this NFS thing, and all I have is a set of man
pages which I can understand and I'm getting there...
