&gt;&gt; Just for something to do.
&gt;&gt; I guess the list users are all grown up and can deal with HTML. :-)
&gt;&gt; One of the points I raised earlier was, like it or not, right or wrong,
&gt;&gt; HTML mail seems to be the 'trend'.
&gt;
&gt; That is, trend of the corporate, business world, normal home user etc...

This statement is in the same category as "eat shit, 1E9 flies can't
be wrong".  Yes, lots of people use HTML mail.  Lots of people are
functionally illiterate when it comes to computers.  We don't need to
rub their noses in it, but we can try to educate them.

If you're prepared to do the work, I think that the HTML conversion
isn't a bad idea.  It should include something like the "Format
recovered" message at the top of this message body (included for
example only; there was nothing wrong with the format of this
message), and warn that the conversion can't be 100%.  It could also
point to an explanation about why HTML mail is bad (in my book:
there's no portable way to reply to it and quote the original text).
