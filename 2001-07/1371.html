Dear Friends -

LPI is in the final stages of preparing the Level 2 tests, and I have
been guaranteed that we will have
delivery of the Level 2 beta by September 4 at the very latest.

In order to best accommodate your needs as members of the Linux
Community, we are creating and implementing a flexible plan that will
help us deliver the Level 2 beta tests to at least 300 qualified**
candidates in less than six weeks while maintaining the strict security
measures necessary to successfuly maintain the validity of the tests.

Deployment of the beta tests will involve two types of tests:

- VUE testing centers around the world will offer a single, extended
exam which will be divided into two exams upon final publishing.  This
allows us to keep costs as low as possible in beta deployment while
offering you the opportunity to take the test in one sitting, with only
one fee of $84 due to VUE testing centers.  Plese note that there will
be two tests once the final exams are published in November, so this
offer is limited to the beta period ONLY.

- Also, we will be offering proctored testing sites around the world
where there are 20 or more qualified** individuals who are interested in
taking the beta exams using low cost "paper" tests.  If you are a member
of a group interested in hosting a proctored exam site during the month
of September, please get in touch with me immediately.  We have a
limited number of LPI staff who are willing to assist in various areas
around the world.

Test Results:

Beta test results will be available in November via a secure website
interface, so there will not be a lengthy waiting period for exam
results.

Getting Certified:

If you are a qualified** beta test candidate, start studying NOW to
prepare for the Level 2 extended beta exams.  Test objectives are on the
LPI website at <A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/p-L2-obj-pre.html">http://www.lpi.org/p-L2-obj-pre.html</A>


Finally, on behalf of all of the many volunteers around the world who
have contributed their time and the 600+ LPIC-1 Alumni -  THANK YOU  -
for your contributions of time, support, prayers, and advice as we
approach the end of our second test development program.  LPI is proud
to work with our many volunteers, and we are grateful for your
contributions.

** A qualified Level 2 beta test candidate is one who:
- Is a professional Linux Systems Administrator
- Has about 3-4 years of UNIX/Linux sysadmin experience
- Has successfully passed both of the LPIC-1 tests (optional to take the
test, but mandatory to recieve certification as LPIC-2)

Please note that you are not subscribed to any lists, and that we have
no intention of spamming you.  Quite the opposite!  We are sending this
message only to people who have registered an interest in LPI through
VUE so that you are aware of our Level 2 test publishing schedule and to
offer you the opportunity to take advantage of the low cost beta exam.
