Hi.

A workable solution is already available, and has been suggested. It would
seem that Netcraft do not have the conviction or will to carry it out,
regardless of the repetitive and newbie-zapping nature of the discussion.

Perhaps it's a $ thing, Netcraft is a business after all. Would it help if
we collectively funded the administration of the change?, I personally
would give some of my hard-earned to rid the list of the HTML problem and
(maybe worse), the continual nuisance discussion it raises)

What would it cost? Would any one else be prepared to contribute?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;On the FreeBSD lists we're thinking of blocking HTML mail, but the
&gt; &gt;alternative of filtering it is a good one.  There's another
&gt; &gt;disadvantage to HTML, as well:
&gt; .au with "unsubscribe" as the subject
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What I don't see is that with all the brains of linuxsa, someone could not 
&gt; write a script or something that could filter the mail on 
&gt; jessica.netcraft.com.au for the linuxsa address and if it contains html it 
&gt; bounces and sends a message to the person instructing them to turn html off 
&gt; before reposting to the list, the responder message could also include 
&gt; instructions for the most common email clients or something like this.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortuantely I do not have the expertise or the knowledge to do this kinda 
&gt; thing, I am still trying to work out normal configurations of sendmail let 
&gt; alone stuff like that, that is if sendmail is what handles it!!! I am not 
&gt; even sure of that!!!. I am sure however that someone could come up with 
&gt; something smart like that to alleviate this problem..
&gt;
