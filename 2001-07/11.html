Hi David,

Point 1. This is a marketing war.

Very true. Apple lost that war, and is now operating more like Monty
Python's black night than a computer supplier capable of taking on their
competitor in the mainstream. MS has it's sights on Linux which is telling
of the threat it percieves from Apple. Personally, I don't care anymore,
but I do hope that Apple continues to survive in the interests of
continuing creative alternatives to the mainstream PC.

Point 2. Commandline is easier than the GUI.

I'm surprised at you for bringing up this old chestnut, there is nothing I
can add to the already thousands of discussions on the subject. All I can
say is that you should use whatever you are comfortable with and accept
that others may prefer something different. The argument that you are
unable to use an interface that you are unfamiliar with as well as the one
you are familiar with is not about the quality of either.

Regards,

Michael.

(using my preferred interface: commandline inside a GUI window)

&gt; 
&gt; Wake up LINUS.
&gt; 
&gt; You're not waging a technical war. You're waging a marketing war.
&gt; 
&gt; PROOF:
&gt; 
&gt; The masses use a horrid, useless operating system called Windows despite
&gt; its defects. They don't sue Microsoft though they would if their house
&gt; malfunctioned so seriously; or they would certainly complain if they had
&gt; to demolish their house and rebuild it after any minor change (such as
&gt; where the front pathway went [for the dolts: changing ip addresses or
&gt; routing tables]).
&gt; 
&gt; All this crap about G4's being better is besides the point.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a user.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it a G4 based system cheaper?
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I understand any of the OS'es that come with it?
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; I could understand Linux but I don't know. For sure. I don't know
&gt; whether Linux PPC has been ported yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I understand OS/X or Apple OS 9?
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; Apples' OSes are unfamiliar to me. In fact, I think the Mac OS
&gt; GUI/Windows war is crap. I absolutely fail to see how Apple Ox 8.x or
&gt; 9.x is intuitive. It takes me about 15 seconds to work out what to do
&gt; under it; Unix commandline---1 second at the most.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I easily change parts, like the motherboard, upgrade sound?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. But it comes out easily and that's about it.
&gt; 
&gt; My point????
&gt; 
&gt; PC's might be crap. But I have a choice. And they work for me.
&gt; 
&gt; What more can I say?
