Obviously you guys do not pay COMPAQ enough money..

same day / same hour support is a regular thing for the company I work
for... of course we do have about 30 ALPHA servers :)

&gt; yeah, but they use cheap crappy brands at any store to have competetive

I suppose that depends on your definition of "brand name components".
Some would have you believe MSI is a brand-name component.

&gt; Hmmm. Thats why out of 6 new compaq desktops i've unpacked in the last
&gt; week, I have had 1 western digital 10gb hdd (they still sell them?)
&gt; crash, and 1 faulty 17" compaq monitor. Cdroms are rebadges lite-ons
&gt; (yeah, great) all components are on board (all or nothing style) I could
&gt; go on... and then get to response time for repair of ciritcal
&gt; servers....

Heh. All of the brand-name manufacturers have that problem. Friends in
the states have unpacked Sun E450s and found them DOA.

Compaq's response time for -anything-, let alone mission-critical
servers is enough to make you reach for a bucket.

Another thing to consider with brand-name equipment is the assurance
that your manufacturer will be there tomorrow. For example, when that
monitor dies, you can take it back to the vendor and be sure that
they'll not say "Who's Compaq?".

As I said, they've also got the advantage of having service centers all
over the world, meaning when the "Leader PC" dies, it doesn't have to be
toed back to Percy Court, Adelaide.

&gt; Yeah, that is true...  Just depends on who its for I guess.

And who you bought it from. I've got to say that Sun have the best
support in the competition, though. You have to pay for it, but the help
is unbelievable.

I think Compaq are a bad example when it comes to after-sales service.
They -do- make gear build like a brick shithouse, though.
