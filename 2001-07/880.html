&gt; Yes, ports as in BSD, but for Slackware Linux :)  I will be using a
&gt; directory tree:
&gt;
&gt; ie. portsroot/x11-apps/xmms/prototype-xmms-1.2.0
&gt;
&gt; Something like that, I may change the name of the build file though -
&gt; prototype is odd.  The need for havinf only one file instead of three
&gt; was for having prototype files for multiple versions of xmms in the
&gt; directory.

fair enough... I spoeak neiterh BSD nor Slackware, so I'll assume this is
sensible :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; ah -- so there are four files, and you are merging three into one, and
&gt; &gt; keeping the generic script... I see...
&gt;
&gt; There were three files initially - protopkg, sources, and rules.  I am
&gt; merging those three into one, which will be taken and used by the
&gt; protopkg script itself.  I think we are on the same page here.

if you call the script a file, which it is, then yeah :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; Personally, to provide what looks to me like the same functionality, I'd
&gt; &gt; consider replacing them with a function like (note my syntax is
&gt; very rusty):
&gt; &gt;

corrections follow:

&gt; &gt; read_lines()
&gt; &gt; {
&gt; &gt; 	if [$1 == "sources"]

  if [ $1 = "sources" ]

&gt; &gt; 	then
&gt; &gt; 		cat &lt;&lt; EOF
&gt; &gt; &lt;sources text&gt;
&gt; &gt; EOF
&gt; &gt; 	elif [$1 == "conf"]

  elif [ $1 = "conf" ]

&gt; &gt; 	then
&gt; &gt; 		cat &lt;&lt; EOF
&gt; &gt; &lt;sources text&gt;

&lt;conf text&gt;

&gt; &gt; EOF
&gt; &gt; 	fi
&gt; &gt; }
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I don't entirely understand that which this script does.  How does this
&gt; function know what text it is catting?  Is the text piped to it from
&gt; read_rules()?

if I call `read_lines sources`, the if statement looks at the paramter
given, and if it's "sources", it does the first thing, which is:

----
cat &lt;&lt; EOF
&lt;sources text&gt;
EOF
----

This is a "Here Document"

man bash says:
----
  Here Documents
     This type of redirection instructs the shell to  read  input
     from  the  current  source until a line containing only word
     (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up
     to that point are then used as the standard input for a com-
     mand.
:
:
----

The input read is piped to the command given (ie cat).

hence, this acts exaclty as if I had a file called "sources" containing
&lt;sources text&gt; and I said `cat sources`. Handy, eh?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; ...and removing the definition of read_lines() from the
&gt; original script... I
&gt; &gt; suppose it depends quite how `read_lines()` is used in the
&gt; script itself...
&gt; &gt; if all it does is set an environment variable, then just set
&gt; that variable
&gt; &gt; in the prototype <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $SOURCES = "source1\n\
&gt; &gt; source2\n\
&gt; &gt; source3"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; etc
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I had considered that - it might just be easier to parse a
&gt; multi-line variable, for both the sources, and the config file rules.
&gt; The problem is, however, that for each of these, there may be two
&gt; "words" per line, or only one...

That should be ok in the solution above:

$SOURCES = "source1.1 source1.2\n\
source2\n\
etc"

&gt;
&gt; &gt; perhaps even make `read_lines_conf()` etc...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; does this help? I'm now interested in solving your problem, so
&gt; you'd better
&gt; &gt; tell me :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; You've lost me a little here, unfortunately - just with regard to the
&gt; use of the read_line() function...  could you explain it a little more?

hopefully I understood your misunderstanding, and my explanation explains
sufficiently :)
