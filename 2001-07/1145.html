I was asking around the CompuServe Forums for info on getting Licenses 
for our older machines and getting help with Linux matters too. This 
response came up (from the USA) which I thought might be of interest to 
others trying to refurbish older machines.

Cheers,  Ian

&gt;Yep. Imagine asking them to sell you a License for Windows 95. It is 
the right size and features for a low spec machine. Would they license 
it to you? Not a chance, you have to use 98 SE or ME to get licenses.
&lt;

Actually, I discovered that Microsoft does have an open licensing 
procedure for this situation.  I stumbled across this at www.cdw.com, 
which is showing MS Windows 3.11 as an available product.

Digging deeper, I find that this product cannot be ordered online, only 
by calling CDW, but there is an explanation that this is a "Charitable 
Open License" product.  

Over on the www.microsoft.com site, I learn that there is a list of 
products available with the Charitable Open License.  The purchaser has 
to buy one actual copy with media of the product, and then gets a 
license to make additional copies legally.  There is another catch, 
too, the product list says for Windows 95 only the upgrade is 
available, and to legally use the upgrade the purchaser must have legal 
copies of MS DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.11.  

All this sounds to me like Microsoft wants to provide a legal means to 
license these products to meet the very objections that you and I have 
been discussing, but they want to make it difficult to actually 
accomplish the goal of legally licensed older machines running Windows 
95.  Formatting the machines for DOS, installing Windows 3.11 (so the 
upgrade checking can find it), and then upgrading to Windows 95 is the 
long and difficult way. 

Do a search on the MS site for "Charitable Open License" and you will 
find what I have found.  The dates on the pages indicate May and July 
of this year.  There is the added distinction between IRS 501c3 
organizations which are educational and those which are not, a 
distinction that may also reappear in Australian legal terms.
