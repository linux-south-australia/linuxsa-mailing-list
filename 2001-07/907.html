&gt; Basically all drives are mapped to the Samba machine during logon.
&gt; At present all workstations run Win95 & we're about to u/g to W2K.
&gt; As part of that I'm implementing roaming profiles, and for space reasons,
&gt; they need to be stored on the Samba box.  The profile path is set in
&gt; the user properties on the NT server & points to \\SambaPC\profiles\username
&gt; 
&gt; Everything goes ok until the profile is cached locally on the W2K
&gt; workstation.  It then denies access to the C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;
&gt; directory, spits out an error, then loads the default profile.
&gt; Interestingly, when you view the security on the local profile, instead
&gt; of a username listed, the user's SID is there.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that somewhere in the profile download process that the userid
&gt; gets trashed & the W2K client has no idea who owns the directory, therefore
&gt; the profile fails.

Do you have any specific errors from the Samba logs at the time of this?
Try setting the debug level to around 3.

&gt; The ideal situation would be logging into Samba as the PDC, but that won't
&gt; be
&gt; happening for obvious reasons, most of which i don't agree with but life's
&gt; like
&gt; that.
&gt; 
&gt; I was under the impression that the W2K/Samba problems only occurred if
&gt; Samba
&gt; was the PDC, which isnt the case here.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

I believe that Samba 2.0.x works OK as a file server for Win2K SP2
machines. Samba 2.2.1a is able to act as a PDC for Win2K SP2 boxen.

Hope it helps,
Matt
