&gt; Does anyone have any experience with IDE RAID and Linux? Specifically, how
&gt; do the built-in Promise RAIDs on motherboards like ASUS A7V133 and MSI Turbo
&gt; K7 SE RAID compare to dedicated RAID cards like Promis FastTrak? Do they
&gt; both work as seamlessly with Linux?

I just built 3 systems using A7V133 from Asus. Using Mandrake 8.0 the promise
card was detected and worked excellently. There is only striping capability
with the onboard promise controller.

&gt; Finally, which is more transparent -- hardware RAID (as above) or software
&gt; RAID? Ideally, I would be able to mirror the entire filesystem, and gain the
&gt; benefit of surviving a disk crash only needing to physically replace the
&gt; drive, not losing any data (preferably not crashing the machine also...)...
&gt; This would include swap and /, for consistency's sake...

I am using software raid at the moment. Raid 1.

2 x 60 GB 7200rpm IBM

Check that article out, it's a piece of cake to get software raid working.

After a disk crash there is a little bit of configuration involved to
initialise and format the replacement drive. Which would be done away with
if you were using hardware raid.

I've got another test machine running 2 x 8 GB Quantum SCSI drives. Very nice,
I flogged it for a week or so copying a large amount of files and large files
as well. I can't seem to fault it. The only other thing I would like to do
is get a nice tape backup system which would complete the setup.

The only problem I have is that the raid software sources seem to be very
old. It's either very good code or they've stopped development on it.
