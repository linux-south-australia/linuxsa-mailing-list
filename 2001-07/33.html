&gt; OK, you've got a different understanding of the word than I (had). I'll
&gt; leave out the millions of analogies, as they're not relevant.

I know what you mean. 

&gt; &gt; Because it may be of benefit to list users, while at the same time not
&gt; &gt; acting like a neo-nazi controller of information. The message gets to the
&gt; &gt; list either way and the HTML sender is always sent a short polite and
&gt; &gt; helpful reminder either way.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still have reservations about the concept and the success of the
&gt; implementation.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still having a hard time getting my head around the reasons. Why is
&gt; it so hard to write a reply looking something like:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt; HTML Message and question here
&gt; 
&gt; 	Please refrain from using HTML email on this list. Please read
&gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.html</A> for more information on propper
&gt; 	formatting style.
&gt; 
&gt; 	In regard to your question, try...

I agree, this will always be done no matter what happens.
What I would like to see, well not see, is other list users also posting
to the HTML offender (and on list). Because the list server has already
done it.

I would say that the stripping of HTML can be questionable in the sense
that it might make the LinuxSA list look more of a dictatorship because it
uses an automated potentially information corrupting method to enforce the
desire of some of its users to have a HTML free list.

&gt; &gt; I meant email client. I agree. On the _joking_ side, we could have a "How
&gt; &gt; to reply to HTML senders"
&gt; 
&gt; :-) My point is, even the messages that David Lloyd has specifically
&gt; said don't render properly in his browser have been granted a reply
&gt; (from him). What does it mean? Essentially, even the worst messages seem
&gt; to be able to be responded to in some shape or form.

I don't think it is David as such, I get the impression that many of the
people on this list come from a unix culture based that for both asthetic,
security and bandwidth reasons, do not like HTML.

&gt; All products start out as a solution to a problem. I don't know the
&gt; history behind demime, but it seems to work quite well (in removing
&gt; MIME). I suppose we could write our own, but I'd be inclined to think
&gt; that it would cause too many interuptions during the bug cleaning
&gt; process.

I would use my code, and test it full else where before even contemplating
placing on the list, if we (as a list group) ever decided to actuall want
to use it.

&gt; Another thing that just dawned on me is the trivial amount of HTML mail
&gt; that actually makes it to us. I've counted 8 since mid-May. It seems
&gt; that it's not exactly in plague proportions.
&gt; 
&gt; After a bit of thinking, I've changed my opinion. I now question the
&gt; need for a HTML mail filter at all. Why? The amount of HTML mail comming
&gt; through is truely miniscule.

I  agree with what you say here. I think a short friendly
reminder that is welcoming to new people and a nice reminder for regular
users who somehow accidentally send HTML is good. And it can make 
reference the list 'policy'. I think policy to too harsh a word, we really
want a 'list of suggestions on how to happily coexist in the LinuxSA
list'. It would be good to see these on the LinuxSA site.

And you might want to append to it something about the list currently
reminding users about users who send HTML will be notified. So other
experienced users who are new to the list wont flame the sender.

I do not want to dictate how the list should be run or how the maintainers
do their work. 

&gt; That's not to say that the "How to get best results from LinuxSA"
&gt; document no longer has a purpose -- it talks about many other things
&gt; that have little to do with HTML.

I agree.

Dale.
