Roger and Andrew,
thanks for the help with installing Linux on the project computer today.

What a blast. Well it was. Do you recall the talk about the CD 
exploding in a mate's computer? Well the damn thing did for us too!!

I had CD 1 (install disk for RH 7.1) running nicely. It finally 
installed without a problem (3rd or 4th try). I put in CD 2 - the 
original from APC Magazine (CD 3 from June 2001) - and set it running. 
I went downstairs to the other computer I had set up in the office. I 
went back up after about 5 mins and the others in the office said that 
the computer had made a very loud BANG!! a couple of minutes ago.

I checked and the drive was locked, and very tinkly, lots of little 
bits could be heard inside the CD drive.

I took it back to Cherry to open as I didn't want to break warranty. 
Bad luck. It was out of warranty as we got it back in May last year. 
They got the tray open and pulled out a number of broken bits of CD. I 
brought it back. Packed up the system and brought it home. 

My son got the CD drive opened and cleaned out the rest of the shiny 
bits. CD Drive works fine. Monday I will ring APC and ask about the 
prevalence of exploding CD's amongst their issues.

You may not believe it but this is true! Cd's can go bang!

Again guys, your help is appreciated.
