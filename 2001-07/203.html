&gt; &gt; We may not consiously push people away, but if you wnet into a shop and
&gt; &gt; said "to buy a fish I'd like to" and the saleman said. "I wont sell to you
&gt; &gt; until you can speak proper english", whould you buy from that shop?
&gt; 
&gt; Completely different. When you go to a shop, you're about to hand over
&gt; your money and expect a certain level of service in return. LinuxSA is a
&gt; bunch of volunteers doing their best to teach and learn in an informal,
&gt; non-financially driven environment.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you asked the salesman "what sort of car has 4 wheel drive" and he said
&gt; &gt; "go read a car buyers guide" (ie rtfm) woudl you wnat to buy from him?
&gt; 
&gt; Dear me -- we have lost the point, haven't we. RTFM simply means "Read
&gt; this: It'll explain it all for you". Why on earth would anyone waste
&gt; their time helping someone who's not prepared to help themselves?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Would you return to those shops?
&gt; 
&gt; Those shops aren't really relevant in this thread.

The shops might not be, but the point is. WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO COMMON COURTESY.

You know like 
"Do unto others as you have do unto you"
"Karma - what goes around, comes around"
"(insert other similar similar quotes here) "
etc.

Not that I am being religious but this list is here to help
people not to flame them then when they're not sure how to
ask the question.

Let's all take a chill pill, relaxe a little and try to calm
down.

Just my 2 cents worth.

(ducks for cover)
