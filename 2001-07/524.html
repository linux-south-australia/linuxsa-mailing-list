&gt;I know (internode being one surprise surprise!) but I'm sorry to
&gt;say everyone else is significantly more expensive than telstra
&gt;(I know it's telstra's wholesale pricing etc to blame but that
&gt;doesn't change the facts)

Absolutely right. Believe me, we are, actively, doing everything we 
can to assist the ACCC with their very current enquiries in this 
matter. So I do hold out just a little bit of hope that this may 
change in the future.

All that does is create another entry point on the graph of options. 
There's ORHH, Telstra ADSL, other ADSL offerings, and each of them 
have certain plus and minus points to them. Our (more expensive) 
option has more features (no PPPoE; Static IP's). Their (less 
expensive) option has a contract lockin and no static IP's. Its a 
free market at the retail level  :)

&gt;128k is probably fast enough, 64k I'm not so sure about.
&gt;But... if I want ORHH at 128k that means I need another PSTN
&gt;line for voice calls which adds roughly another $20pm to the
&gt;cost of the ORHH option - making adsl even more attractive.
&gt;(since my original comparison assumed 64k ORHH)

Actually it doesn't have to mean that at all.

First, you can configure your router to run 64k with a dynamic 
decision (based on sustained traffic load) to punch up the second 
channel.

Second, a good ISDN router with voice ports can let you run a phone 
and a fax and your net link on the pair of ISDN channels, with 
dynamic setup and teardown of channels as required.

e.g.:

- you are on the net at 128k and a call comes in. The router drops 
one ISDN channel to let the voice call in, and you are at 64k to the 
Internet until you hang up the phone, when your router either 
immediately or when you pull more than 64k worth of traffic (your 
choice) punches the second channel back up to your ISP.

- you pick up the phone and dial an outgoing call while on the net at 
128k . Again, the router drops one 64K channel out to let you place 
the call, and you hang up and the same scenario happens as noted 
above.

Non theoretical, there are boggins of ISDN routers with analog voice 
ports in them for -exactly this reason-.

So you can get what you want without paying an extra $20pm, at the 
expense of a few more local calls to re-establish the second ISDN 
channel.

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; - How many megs per month do you expect to download? (very small
&gt;  &gt; amounts can often be included in some form of 'deal' by your ISP,
&gt;  &gt; very large amounts attract volume discounts. In the middle, the cost
&gt;  &gt; tends to be a bit higher)
&gt;
&gt;and that's the problem.  I doubt we can stick to under 1Gb per
&gt;month (especially if the service is faster than 56k modem and
&gt;we want to try out streaming audio/video etc - all the stuff
&gt;broadband is supposed to be for).
&gt;
&gt;Basically I want to be able to run napster a bit, grab a linux
&gt;iso image etc if I want to and "normal" browsing.  I can live with
&gt;the fact that the month I get an iso we might have to limit other
&gt;stuff but I want it to be possible (without paying 20 odd c per Mb
&gt;for the rest of the image over 160Mb for example) if I so desire.

Our effective $ per mb for the first 1500 megs downloaded per month 
is about $0.11 per Mb. Almost half the price you've noted above. I 
find at my place (and I am a heavy, but non-Mp3 downloading, user) 
that I use about 1gb per month - which fits into the 1500 mb plan 
that we offer with that effective $ per Mb rate in it.

You either want it bad enough, or you don't. That's the bottom line :)

Cheers,
Simon
