Ricky,

&gt; Of course, this doesn't apply when you get seriously high data
&gt; rates, where you need dedicated (usually cisco) hardware. Or does
&gt; it? I remember this coming up some time ago, but is there any recent
&gt; performance comparisons for serious big-arse enterprise
&gt; installations of Linux firewalls vs dedicated hardware?

I'm talking about the sort of bandwidth requiremetn by an SME's with
resonable internet requirements.  

If you want serious bandwidth you're gonna have to route your packets
on silicon... of course, I'm not gonna backup this up with any real
numbers ;-)

&gt; Or am I missing the point of what a firewall is... I've always
&gt; assumed it to mean effectively an IP filter, but as I think now, I
&gt; do wonder... Would I be right in saying that in such an application,
&gt; you would have a router to route packets and a separate firewall to
&gt; block access, or would you just have a router with lots of ACLs?

A packet filter is only part of a firewall.  It's a really good tool
to have but you need other things like application proxies.  Depends
on what you want to get out of your firewall.  Security, Control and
watchfulness are the main things that should be considered.  Security
that fits in with the overall security policy of your organisation
(ie. don't spend a million $ on you firewall and have no physical
security).  Control so that people inside can only do what you want
them to [1].  Watchfulness so you can see if you have any
misconfigured internal machines [2] or if someone has broken into your
network etc.

Router == firewall..... maybe...  again, depends on what your
requirements are.  If you're a typical SME then merging the two is
probably OK.  

Regards,
Michael

[1] OK, so if you offer any sort of service to internal users there
    will be some geek out there who can circumvent it.  DNS tunnel,
    email tunnel blah blah.

[2] This is also useful for finding machines with viruses.  I've found
    a number of viruses by quickly looking thru firewall logs for
    machines sending out packets they shouldn't.
