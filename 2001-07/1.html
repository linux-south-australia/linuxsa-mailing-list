&gt; &gt; While the following suggestions are sound, i think that a new comer will

&gt; &gt; client.", and then decides to leave the list and looses interest in
&gt; &gt; Linux/Unix. The fact that this was an administrator from a major collage
&gt; &gt; or school has set Linux acceptence back.
&gt; 
&gt; "If at all possible, use a UNIX mailer" NOT "Only use a UNIX mailer when
&gt; posting to this list.

It can still feels like an obligation. It should read "If at all possible
use a recommended email client (such as...)". Just because it is a unix
email client does not make it perfect. There is a slightly higher chance
of it playing nicely if it is a unix client. Is netscape under a unix
beter for email than the Windows version?

&gt; &gt; On a different note, sure, educate the user, but the server side needs to
&gt; &gt; be robust as well. For example intercepting HTML.
&gt; 
&gt; No. That's not the solution. Let them know about it and answer their
&gt; question rather than making them wait for the news that it's in HTML and
&gt; have them resend it. Just get on with it.

It is the solution. The server intercepts the email detects HTML embeded
messages. Lets it onto the list. And sends the sender a reminder about
HTML. I would rather that, than install a new mailer, and during a busy
day forget to set to plain text or have a network policy or profile reset
my choices, to then mail to LinuxSA and get a mouthfull directed at me
(and the list aas well).

&gt; &gt; Of all the HTML posts I have seen to the list, none of them have seemed to
&gt; &gt; be deliberate or overly careless.
&gt; 
&gt; Does that get their problem solved? Nope. Let them know they've used
&gt; HTML (and we don't like it) and get on with answering their question.

You assumed that the server side just blocked HTML etc... I never implied
that. The many times I have made suggestions on this list regarding HTML
'filtering' on a mailing list server I have indicated that the messages
gets through (as is, or stripped of HTML).

And that simple change would solve a lot.

You need to both communicate the 'policy' and 'ways to meet the policy',
and if you can have a machine do the work for you in a positive way that
doesn't interfere, to meet this policy, then it makes things easier for
everyone.
