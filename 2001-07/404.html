to be honest, the mdk 8 has a really cool "control panel" (if you like)
which is the atractive feature im looking at. im sure you've seen it. i have
only seen it on their www.mandrake.com web site.

so do you (or anyone in adelaide - cbd) have a copy of mbk 8???

would be really good!

&gt; &gt; a dead end? i have no problems - as such. i have heard 
&gt; about this mdk 8 not
&gt; &gt; being very ... complete/stable. either way, im a mandrake 
&gt; fan and wont to
&gt; &gt; give it a go. Is there anyone in the city who has this on 
&gt; cd, which i could
&gt; &gt; borrow?
&gt; 
&gt; The official word from Linus & Alan is that all new 
&gt; development should be
&gt; done with the new kernel. They also said they wouldn't accept 
&gt; new drivers
&gt; and stuff for 2.2 unless they are also produced for 2.4.
&gt; Plus, 2.2 just doesn't scale up as well, with filesystem, 
&gt; process, threads,
&gt; memory, etc. limits. 2.4 is faster too, has more features, 
&gt; better design,
&gt; better support for new hardware, and has been nice and stable for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out the various webpages detailing the differences 
&gt; between the two
&gt; kernel branches, and you'll see what i mean ;)
&gt; 
&gt; basically, if 2.2 works for you, you may as well stick with 
&gt; it, but as soon
&gt; as you need something nifty, just swap to 2.4 -- you'll want to do it
&gt; eventually  anyway.

&gt; &gt; just upgrade to mandrake 8 and you'll get the 2.4.x kernel, 
&gt; usb support and
&gt; &gt; apps, etc. etc. easily. Stick with mandrake, don't go to redhat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You could just upgrade the kernel + utils manually, but if 
&gt; you've never
&gt; &gt; compiled something before, it'll probably take you a week 
&gt; of trial and error
&gt; &gt; before you get anywhere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.4 kernels are just simply much better.. 2.2 is a dead end..

&gt; &gt; &gt; Andrew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right now i have my usb mouse (with an adaptor) going 
&gt; into the ps2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; port.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what do i need to do to use USB?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would you want to use a mouse with USB? Sure USB is 
&gt; cool, but i dont
&gt; &gt; see
&gt; &gt; &gt; how a mouse can make any use of it, it only needs PS/2. 
&gt; The PS/2 port was
&gt; &gt; made
&gt; &gt; &gt; for the mouse/kbd so use it. Sure having a USB scanner 
&gt; with no external
&gt; &gt; power
&gt; &gt; &gt; is good, so save the USB port for that!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i am using Mandrake 7.2 with no modification to the kernel.
&gt; &gt; &gt; More than likely check if you have 2.2.18 (or did 
&gt; manduckshit 7.2 have a
&gt; &gt; 2.4.xx
&gt; &gt; &gt; kernel??)
&gt; &gt; &gt; you will need to RTFM then recomple and RTFM again.
