&gt; I think it's interesting that linux is doing well
&gt; out there in the money-making market.
&gt; US$60m/year sounds pretty good to me.

Good indeed but.... IMHO if you can't make money selling firewalls
based on Linux to SME's, then we may aswell give up the whole thing.
Linux is just ideal for this type of application.

&gt; Is this by any chance related to the company that
&gt; Rusty did some work for in the area of a firewall-in-a-box?
&gt; Just curious...

Yes it is, but it was more of a sponsorship of his work.  Actually,
his discussions with them significantly influenced the design of
Netfilter.  They wanted to do some reasonably funky things with Linux 
which, at the time, was impossible (they were using closed source
binary kernel modules.  Not sure what they're doing now).

Regards,
Michael
