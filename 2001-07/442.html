&gt;&gt; yeah, but they use cheap crappy brands at any store
to have competetive
&gt;&gt; prices. If you buy brand name components, rather
than a brandname box
&gt;&gt; then you should be ok. 
&gt;I suppose that depends on your definition of "brand
name components".
&gt;Some would have you believe MSI is a brand-name
component.

Its always a case of what one is willing to pay. After
all, if a client of mine wants a PC & printer &c but
only has $1500 to spend, then I have to explain that
whats inside will certainly do the job but wont
necesarily be top notch. Then they have a decision to
make.

I dont know of too many major brands that manufacture
their own hard disks (IBM excepted), motherboards,
CDROM drives or monitors, they are for the most part
just rebadged. SO just because you buy a brand name PC
doesnt mean you'll have brand quality parts inside.

&lt;snipped&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Another thing to consider with brand-name equipment
&gt; is the assurance
&gt; that your manufacturer will be there tomorrow. For
&gt; example, when that
&gt; monitor dies, you can take it back to the vendor and
&gt; be sure that
&gt; they'll not say "Who's Compaq?".
&gt; 
&gt; As I said, they've also got the advantage of having
&gt; service centers all
&gt; over the world, meaning when the "Leader PC" dies,
&gt; it doesn't have to be
&gt; toed back to Percy Court, Adelaide.
&gt; 

One alternative to this, and you'll need to ask the
supplier if they do it, is to spend about $200 (which
is less than the equivalent at the brand name
suppliers) and purchase the three-year extended
warranty, _provided_ this is provided by one of the
third-party warranty providers such as Forton or
United Electrical. (This works kind of like the
second-hand car warranty most honest dealers provide.)

This means if the original company you bought the PC
off dies, you are still covered for warranty. 

I dont know how far I'd trust any extended warranty
that wasnt underwritten, however.
