I am sick of the thread.  Not because it's non-technical, but because
it's totally, completely, abysmally, pathetically, ridiculously, 
comprehensively FREAKIN' STUPID!

Look, people:  If you care enough about this to create another mailing
list, stop arguing about it and create another mailing list.

If you don't care enough about it to create another mailing list, it
obviously isn't a big deal for you, so stop arguing about it.

Either way, you'll notice that "stop arguing about it" is a prominent
theme.

I'm staggered at the abject stupidity of the protagonists here:  Every
single person who is arguing in favour of another list HAS THE ABILITY
TO CREATE ANOTHER LIST TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEM.  But are these people
solving their problem?  No!  They've just spent an entire week polluting
this list by arguing about it, thereby (a) not creating what they perceive
to be a more useful alternative list, and (b) diminishing the usefulness
of this one for the other 620 list subscribers who really don't give a 
shit.

I don't give a rat's arse about whether the content of this list is 
technical or non-technical, except for the fact that spending a week
arguing about a problem you have WHEN YOU ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF SOLVING
THAT PROBLEM, PERMANENTLY, BY YOURSELF strikes me as an inane and stupid
waste of time.

Enough!
