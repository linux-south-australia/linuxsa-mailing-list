&gt; Anyway, when the PCs for kids buy was asked about linux,

This is both true and false. At some time in their time in school, kids 
will come into contact with MS software.

My kids have used Mac's and PCs. The Macs have mostly used Claris 
software. They have used them for wordprocessing and dealing with 
spreadsheets and so on.

&gt; He said that 
&gt; loading linux and StarOffice on the PCs would cost
&gt; a huge amount in heartache and money.


This is just false. Linux and OpenOffice are both free and capable 
enough to be usable to teach how to do wordprocessing, spreadsheets, 
presentations, and so on.

However, there is a learning curve, but given that the initial cost is 
low, and they can run on lower powered equipment, I think that the cost 
of the learning curve in countries where wages are low makes them more 
worth-while that using people who are skilled in MS products, who would 
command a premium and in short supply in third-world countries.
