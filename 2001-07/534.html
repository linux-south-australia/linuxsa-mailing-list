&gt; Absolutely right. Believe me, we are, actively, doing everything we

well good luck, I hope it does!
 
&gt; &gt;128k is probably fast enough, 64k I'm not so sure about.
&gt; &gt;But... if I want ORHH at 128k that means I need another PSTN
&gt; &gt;line for voice calls which adds roughly another $20pm to the
&gt; &gt;cost of the ORHH option - making adsl even more attractive.
&gt; &gt;(since my original comparison assumed 64k ORHH)
&gt; 
&gt; Actually it doesn't have to mean that at all.
&gt; 
&gt; First, you can configure your router to run 64k with a dynamic 
&gt; decision (based on sustained traffic load) to punch up the second 
&gt; channel.

[snip]
and there's the first problem, you're now talking more
$$ than just a NetJet card!  The second problem, or
consideration at least, is it'll add quite a few more
$$ still to the call costs.

&gt; Our effective $ per mb for the first 1500 megs downloaded per month 
&gt; is about $0.11 per Mb. Almost half the price you've noted above. I 
&gt; find at my place (and I am a heavy, but non-Mp3 downloading, user) 
&gt; that I use about 1gb per month - which fits into the 1500 mb plan 
&gt; that we offer with that effective $ per Mb rate in it.

is this an adsl plan or ORHH/modem one?
your cheapest adsl is $89pm for 500Mb cap (or $199pm for 1.5Gb)
your modem plan is $50pm for 1Gb cap but has a session limit
and you can't redial straight away (as I recall) so that
bumps up the costs with all the redials.

&gt; You either want it bad enough, or you don't. That's the bottom line :)

no I want it all, for nothing, haven't you realised yet!
But failing that, I'd like a reasonable speed, permanent
connection and min of 1Gb limit for as little as possible
(and at the moment telstra is the cheapest at $78pm, more's
the pity cos I'd really rather not go with them!)

(the other option is stick with dingoblue for $25pm plus line
rental $20pm for a non-permanent connection (400hrs per month
so basically average 12 hours per day) with 1.5Gb limit.)

Dave.
