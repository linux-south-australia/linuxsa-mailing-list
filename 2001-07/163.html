I am a newbie-ish but do agree this is now a saga (I noted the change in
subject..) so thought I should be a part of it..

&gt; I think you've picked up the wrong end of the stick. The idea of a
&gt; seperate list (as pointless as it is) is not to prevent "newbies" from
&gt; bothering the "gurus". It's a concept designed to provide better help
&gt; for "newbies". Unfortunately, it wouldn't work.
&gt;

so why cant the "gurus" write scripts that filter the mail?? I beleive
someone offered to do the work in a earlier email.
maybe it could be accepted so the mail isnt lost and unanswered but then
replies a warning to the sender to use plain text next time?
and what may be useful is from reading the X-Mailer tag reply with the
relevant instructions to show the "newbie" how to change their mail client
to send plain text...

&gt; &gt; I personally completely support this mailling list and organisation in
its
&gt; &gt; current form. I believe its the best way of sharing knowledge,
&gt; &gt; sharing ideas and projects.
&gt;
&gt; Me too. The structure of this list is fine.

here, here..

&gt;
&gt; &gt; .....and yes, I have to manually sort every email every morning... Im
happy
&gt; &gt; with that, because I'll actually read the email now and might
&gt; &gt; be able to help the user now, not in a month when I get board.
&gt;
&gt; Er, OK. Personally, I sort my mail automatically into folders, making
&gt; dealing with 600 messages a day a lot easier. I still manage to read
&gt; LinuxSA posts within the hour, most of the time.
&gt;

so as I said earlier, make the computers do the work with filtering
scripts.. I always thought thats what we use computers for, to make our
lives easier... or would that leave the  "gurus" with nothing to complain
about ?!?  ;)

(tm)
