&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello guys,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have managed to get a dual headed display working under Red Hat
&gt;&gt;&gt; linux 7.1 (matrox g450). Matrox supplies excellent doco regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt; the setup.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I would like to know is, is it possible to have a three display
&gt;&gt;&gt; system, where two of the monitors get their output from the matrox
&gt;&gt;&gt; card (agp) and the thrid from a pci graphics adapeter?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anyone know if this can be done and if so the how (NOTE: The
&gt;&gt;&gt; second graphics card is not a matrox).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I am currently running 3 graphics cards (an AGP card, by coincidence
&gt;&gt; an M400 double-head, and two PCI cards, both older Matrox, I think
&gt;&gt; Millennium II) on my main machine with XFree86 4.0.&lt;mumble&gt;.  In
&gt;&gt; addition I have two further displays linked with x2x from two other
&gt;&gt; machines, making a total of 5 displays.  I'm not using the second
&gt;&gt; output of the M400, since the resolution is too low.  I suppose I
&gt;&gt; could add it too, but I wouldn't know where to put the monitor.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've described how to do this in my diary, I think in January this
&gt;&gt; year.  Unfortunately I'm not online right now, but you'll find your
&gt;&gt; way via <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary.html.">http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary.html.</A>
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your response Greg.
&gt;
&gt; I checked out your site. The exact date was January 26.
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately though the link was broken to your XF86Config file, so
&gt; I could not peruse it.

*sigh*  Fixed.

&gt; In you diary you mention five different displays that appear to be
&gt; running across three different machines. Is this correct?

Yes.

&gt; If so then your three display environment is fairly homogenous,
&gt; which the XFree site says should work fine. Unfortunately I have a
&gt; Matrox G450 (AGP) and a Phantom (somethingarutha) PCI.

That's not an issue.  I have never set up a Matrox 4?0 for dual
monitors, but many people have.  If nobody else gets there first, I'll
research it when I get back to Oz.

&gt; If you know a way to force theis configuration to work it would be
&gt; great to hear from you; if you have the time, your diary seems to
&gt; indicate a very active life!!!.

Indeed.

Greg
