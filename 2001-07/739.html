&gt;&gt; Compaq's response time for -anything-, let alone mission-critical
&gt;&gt; servers is enough to make you reach for a bucket.
&gt;
&gt; Obviously you guys do not pay COMPAQ enough money..

Please don't leave the whole message floating underneath your reply. It
forces me to read it again to find out what you're talking about. If you
quote snippets, like I have above, then they're inline memory triggers.

&gt; same day / same hour support is a regular thing for the company I work
&gt; for... of course we do have about 30 ALPHA servers :)

I would advise not paying Compaq the extra money, and use it to buy
spare machines instead. This way, in the event of failure, you can
immediately swap in a functional machine and be back on your feet.

Then Compaq can waddle out slowly and provide their regular service
on the defective machine. On the last project I was on, this saved us
several million in support fees as we had lots of Compaq gear.

The Compaq guy wasn't very happy with me when I pointed out this cost
cutting measure shortly before it was implemented. He spent the rest of
the project refusing to look at me, ignored my greetings and if he was
forced to make a reply, he'd look at someone else while speaking. Very
rude and strange, actually.

In any event, we kept operations going 24 hours with more computers, more
critical uptime requirements and quicker recovery from outages than the
other IT group who chose to rely on Compaq support. We ended up with three
times more equipment than we expected, with no problems and no budget
increase.

It's hard to over-rate the smug feeling of security that you get from
looking into a room full of brand spanking new computers, just waiting to
bail you out of trouble. They sit there, bright, new and eager to please.

The only caveat is to make sure they stay that way - they were paid for
from the support budget. They're not available for use by anyone. Also
be sure to keep testing that the spare machines are functional.

We used them as a sysadmin testbed for proposed changes or upgrades, with
the mirroring tricks I've mentioned before. Extremely useful.
