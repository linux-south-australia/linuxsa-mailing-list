&gt; Maybe that's true, maybe not.  There are plenty of HTML viewers and
&gt; I think it's a given that there is a sufficient choice of "good"
&gt; ones.

I disagree.  I don't know *any* good HTML viewer.

&gt; Perhaps the problem is a lack of HTML editors?

That too.

&gt; Yet there are choices here, too.  Do you truly think there is none
&gt; which is satisfactory?  Personally I find vi works well.  Without
&gt; wishing to be contraversial, I think Outlook Express does quite a
&gt; reasonable job, too.

As I've said in the past, I think Outlook (Express or not) does a
bloody awful job.

&gt;&gt; There's no effective way of quoting text.
&gt;
&gt; You said that before, and I was unconvinced, so I took it upon myself
&gt; to work through the problem using the GIF that you attached.
&gt;
&gt; By the way there's no reason to believe that the mail in your GIF comes
&gt; from an HTML mailer.

No, it doesn't.  The display came from a web browser, showing
reasonable size images and far-too-wide text.  It was illustrating a
different point.  It has nothing to do with your point.

&gt; There are two common ways of continuing a dialogue.  One has the
&gt; original message appearing below the new commentary; the other has
&gt; inline commentary.  I discover that adding commentary above the original
&gt; message is trivial.  See the attachment, above.html, which is based upon
&gt; the mail in your GIF.  (I added an ongoing dialogue because otherwise
&gt; the problem was trivially easy however you look at it.)
&gt;
&gt; The inline commentary is certainly a lot harder.  See inline.html.
&gt; The issue, I discovered, is that you need to consider the way in which
&gt; the original text has already been quoted, and the level of nesting.
&gt; For a given dialogue there might be N levels of quoting.  When you want to
&gt; insert your comments you need to end all of the quoting mechanism at the
&gt; point of your comment, and you need to start it again after your comment.
&gt; That can require you to think rather carefully.

Depending on how good your tools are.

&gt; Yet I think that an HTML can do that for you.

An HTML?  Editor?

It *should* be able to do it.  I have never seen one which does so
easily.

&gt;&gt; People who use HTML mail also tend to write badly laid-out messages
&gt;
&gt; I must be misunderstanding you.  The point appears hysterical, or
&gt; prejudiced, or both.  Shall we pretend you never said it, or do you
&gt; want to explain it a bit more carefully? :-)

No.  It's based on my observations.

&gt;&gt; HTML does not specify the appearance of the text.
&gt;
&gt; That's the point of it.  It's also true that plain text does not
&gt; completely specify the appearance of the text.  For example, it's silent
&gt; on issues such as line-width, wrapping, and tabs (both horizontal and
&gt; vertical).

No, it specifies them exactly (if somewhat inflexibly).  It's MUAs
which ignore this information that cause half the problem.

&gt; More importantly, HTML adds valuable

For some definition of ~valuable"

&gt; markup which is missing from plain text.  Quite frankly I do
&gt; sometimes need to vary my voice, and asterisks and underlines are
&gt; inadequate and inferior to the most basic of HTML facilities.

Agreed on that point.  I don't think that the disadvantages make up
for them, though.  Note that there are also other formats which are as
far superior to HTML in this area as HTML is to plain text.

&gt;&gt; Specifically, I get a lot of technical questions.  I expect text to
&gt;&gt; be laid out in a reasonable width, about 80 characters wide.  I expect
&gt;&gt; log file output to be included exactly as it came from the machine,
&gt;&gt; which could be several hundred characters wide.
&gt;
&gt; The two expectations are contradictory;

Not really.  We're looking at different things.

&gt; however HTML does support both requirements.  If you are writing
&gt; prose you use the basic features such as &lt;P&gt;, and allow the browser
&gt; to render the text in the way that best suits the output medium.

No, I want control over what it looks like.

&gt; This is HTML's strength and plain text's weakness.

This is HTML's weakness and plain text's strength.

&gt; Debates about 72, 70 or 74 character line lengths are one the best
&gt; criticisms of plain text over HTML.

I think they're just out of place.

&gt; Log files are also catered for in HTML.  That's what &lt;PRE&gt; is about.
&gt; Again, the display agent does the best job of rendering that it can.

It tries to be cleverer than I am.  It fails.

&gt;&gt; To help read it, I use a wide screen (120 characters in mutt; with
&gt;&gt; HTML I'd use a full screen.  The sender can't know this, and
&gt;&gt; there's no way under these circumstances that I can stop HTML from
&gt;&gt; using the full width of the screen for the text as well.
&gt;
&gt; It doesn't matter if the browser reformats the non-log text when you
&gt; widen your browser window.

Not to you, maybe.  It matters a lot to me.

&gt; Sure you might get "thin" paragraphs, but presumably you went
&gt; full-screen because you were looking at the log extract, not the
&gt; accompanying text.

Exactly.

&gt; By the way, you also get horizontal scrolling, so you don't really
&gt; need to go full-screen.

I *hate* horizontal scrolling.  It drives me up the wall.  It's also
extremely difficult to use.
