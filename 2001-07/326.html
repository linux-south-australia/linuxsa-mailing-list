&gt; In return I help when I can and even consider myself beyond the newbie

&gt; Linux / *BSD's are alive to day and that is knowledge sharing.

I'm all for welcoming newbies and resurrecting the days where the oldbies
helped the newbies. Linux wouldn't have become what it is if people had a
hostile or elitist attitude (something the BSD camp suffered from).

What I'm ranting about are the number of people who have bought into the
business aspects of Linux. Shrink wraps, End user targets, Percentage of
market share, Linux versus Microsoft, IPOs, marketing to CTOs, FUD...

The list is endless. And it's all irrelevant. Linux is not something that
comes from the current business models, so it can't be viewed in business
terms, no matter how 'comprehensible' it is to management types.

Making Linux look so attractive that it convinces Grannies to use it to
send photos to their grandkids is an act of advertising deception. Linux
just isn't that easy.

It isn't elitist to avoid inappropriate target markets.
