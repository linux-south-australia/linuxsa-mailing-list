I hate the font that site uses (at least on my Mac under Netscape :) )

As someone in that thread points out, the DSLAM network operates as a 
layer 2 ATM network, connecting PVC's from customer sites to 'the 
middle'.

In 'the middle' Telstra impose a rather failure prone Layer 2 to 
Layer 3 concentrating box (those who were at my talk at the last 
LinuxSA meeting will have got the gory details on that :) )

That latter box is probably the one being 'taken out' by the stream 
of fragmented packets. It seems to be vulnerable to all sorts of 
things, so much so that Telstra have been refunding people's money 
lately (really quite a serious admission on their part of just how 
seriously their servers are breaking).

Those at the LinuxSA talk will also know about my preferred fix - 
forcing Telstra to stop making us use their failure prone 
concentrator box and being able to use our own instead. I remain 
moderately optimistic that Telstra, via the tender proddings of the 
ACCC, will ultimately see sense and offer us that option.

Meantime, our own use of the Telstra ADSL 'wholesale' 'network' in 
South Australia is done in such a way that we minimise our dependence 
on the Telstra servers that seem to be so failure prone. So that 
while we're not able to completely avoid using them, some of the 
servers that have tended to go south on T$ lately (mostly related to 
their PPPoE and Radius handling) are servers that our own 
configuration for ADSL manages to completely avoid using.

As a result, the really major ADSL outages in the eastern states in 
the last few weeks have had zero effect on us here in SA. I'm sure of 
this, I've been happily using my own ADSL service right through those 
outages :)

However, this does NOT guarantee that some other more peverse failure 
mode will affect our customers in the future. We live in interesting 
times...

[speaking of which, a Southern Cross Cable Network fibre cut today 
means that Internet performance from Australia to the USA is likely 
to be severely degraded for many people tomorrow onwards. Our own 
networks are multihomed enough that we should be able to work around 
it for our own customers, but others may not be so  lucky... Southern 
Cross is supposed to be a path-diverse, protected network. 
Unfortunately it looks like the 'backup path' hasn't quite been 
completed yet - and they just lost their primary path, 21km's 
offshore from Sydney. Oops]

Cheers,
Simon
