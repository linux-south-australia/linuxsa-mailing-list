<H1>W2K & Samba issues</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I'm having some hassles with Windows 2000 at present which I cant
nail to a specific cause, my gut feeling is that it's related to
the W2K SP2 & Samba hassles, but not convinced until I upgrade to 
Samba 2.2. (this weekend's project :o)
Just running the scenario past the list to see if any ideas come up.

W2K is the workstation OS, running with SP2.
Single PDC is NT 4, SP6a
Separate server running Samba 2.0.7 (slap fingers for not upgrading yet, i
know)
The Samba machine is a member of the NT domain etc etc (see smb.conf)

Basically all drives are mapped to the Samba machine during logon.
At present all workstations run Win95 & we're about to u/g to W2K.
As part of that I'm implementing roaming profiles, and for space reasons,
they need to be stored on the Samba box.  The profile path is set in 
the user properties on the NT server & points to \\SambaPC\profiles\username

Everything goes ok until the profile is cached locally on the W2K 
workstation.  It then denies access to the C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;
directory, spits out an error, then loads the default profile.
Interestingly, when you view the security on the local profile, instead
of a username listed, the user's SID is there.

It seems that somewhere in the profile download process that the userid
gets trashed & the W2K client has no idea who owns the directory, therefore
the profile fails.

The ideal situation would be logging into Samba as the PDC, but that won't
be
happening for obvious reasons, most of which i don't agree with but life's
like
that.

I was under the impression that the W2K/Samba problems only occurred if
Samba
was the PDC, which isnt the case here.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks


Here's the relevant bits of smb.conf, never mind the 777 mask on the
profile share, i was trying everything ;o)
