Hi David,

&gt;However you may want to consult with these people and
see if _they_ want Linux installed onto their systems; in the end
they're the ones who will get the experience and jobs from them.
&gt;

If they want MS gear on their computer then they buy a computer from a 
retailer. Unless we can resolve the issue of licenses with MS then we 
wont be participating in any distribution of MS software or Operating 
Systems.

&gt;I wouldn't admit that on this list.&lt;

This is using their free webmail account. It has worked like a charm 
for many months and not 1 drop of spam from them or anybody else.

Compare that to Hotmail and you can understand why I am using this free 
site. Sign up to them at <A HREF="http://telstra.com">http://telstra.com</A>

&gt; I've never seen anyone quote like this either

I have been online sinc 93 and since 95 have worked almost continuously 
in the CompuServe Network managing Forums for them. I would have read 
and written countless messages. Often I will read over 400 messages a 
night and send off about 20 to 50 responses.

I believe that an email is not just a note dashed off but a method of 
communication so I take care to make it readable, clear and concise. 
Perhaps I am not as concise as many readers would like :-)

The method I use is common on most of the Compuserve network and as 
they predate much of the Internet and Web they were here first &lt;VBG&gt; 
&lt;G,D&RVF&gt;

Cheers,

Ian
