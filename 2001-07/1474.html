Hi Alan,

Agree completely with you. There is a world of difference between 
education and training.

Our project aims to educate those that have never used a computer and 
those that have some knowledge but not enough for employment. In this 
case we are talking perhaps weeks with the goal being helping the 
learner reach a state of being employable with added IT skills.

It would be great to be able to go into the schools and teach the 
basics of computing with a Linux focus. To be able to gladly say, sure, 
you can have a copy of the program, no need to hack or pirate it. It 
would alos be great to say that no year 10 hacker can break into the 
school's network.

Unfortunately none of that is  going to happen in the foreseeable 
future and as long as MS courts the right people in the government and 
the education departments it is not likely to happen. Universities are 
also swinging over to the MS way of thinking so perhaps there is a need 
to reverse that trend and bring the programmers and developers of 
tomorrow up in a world where there are viable alternatives to following 
MS.

When I wake up from this nice dream I will be back into reality and I 
really don't want to be part of it &lt;VBG&gt;


Cheers, Ian
