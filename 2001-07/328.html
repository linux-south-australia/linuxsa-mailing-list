&gt; No. You.

It -does- seem as though you're complaining about "newbies" presence but
not wanting to do anything about it. Richard's suggestion isn't at all a
bad one.

&gt; It's one thing to disagree with me, but it's another thing to deny me
&gt; my right to express my opinion.

No one is denying you the right to express your opinion. Understand and
accept though, that if you decide to make a rather loaded and
controversial comment, you're going to be faced with a lot of
disagreeing faces.

If you're going to be blatenty, dare I say it, stupid about what you say
to the world, make another list and tell it to them. I can say for one

&gt; Andrew Reid posting "you're wrong" was a waste of space too. Don't
&gt; just disagree. Explain why.

I'm sick to death of people continually demanding reasons when they know
perfectly well why I (and others) feel the way they do. To quote Mark
Newton on the subject of going over and over things:

"Every possible reason or opinion to support that statement has already
been canvassed, at length, several times.  Read the archives, or ask
him privately for further explanations, or go stick your head in a pig,
or do *anything*, but please don't offer further encouragement to people
who, given the opportunity, will repeat the same points they've been 
repeating during this thread since it started."

I reckon I could put money on the fact that you knew exactly what the
reasons behind my comments were.

Finally, "... a waste of space..."? Uh huh. You've just made a statement
that I violently object to, and now you're saying that me stating that
is a complete waste of space. Don't feed me shit here, you know
-exactly- why I (and others) disagree with you.

&gt; I liked the Internet better before people got modems for Christmas.

Deal with it. I don't care.
