It would appear that noone on this thread is actually bothered by HTML mail.
Isn't that ironic?

I suggest a committee-based approabh to list filtering. Emails to Linuxsa
should be automatically forwarded to a select group of individuals (mainly
consisting of David Lloyds[1]), who collectively vote through an automated
system as to whether the mail is ok or not. If more than half[2] of this
group respond positively within a reasonable time limit[3], then the mail
message is entered into a CVS repository.

The LinuxSA Email Guru Squad (LEGS) then have half an hour to edit the mail
collectively to be correctly formatted[4][5] and then forwarded of to QA[6].
At this point, emails that have potential to be misintepreted[7] should have
a lenthy disclaimer attached to the top.

Finally, emails should be sent to a beta group of list users (selected for
their long-standing usage of the list) and comments received back to the
LEGS. If this group of beta users provides mostly positive feedback after a
one day beta cycle, the email can enter the full circulation of the user
group.

rr

[1] I suggest that &gt;50% of the group is made from the many instances of
David Lloyd... As is rumoured for Shakespeare, one man simply could not
produce that volume of literature/email (guess who did which!) -- it must be
a group...

[2] ok, "if the David Lloyds"

[3] for practical reasons, I would suggest this is kept to under 10 minutes

[4] of course, if the email was written by Jason Tan, it will have to be
sent through ispell with a custom dictionary (or should that be ditconiayr?)
to correct the typos (actually, perhaps a perl script that swaps every third
character would work...)

[5] Any of Alan Kennington's emails should automatically be split into two
at the "PS". This could be acheived by a simple script.

[6] Quality Assurance would be carried out solely by Greg Lehey.

[7] That is, those from David Lloyd or David Newall.


PS: in case you are a moron, this email is not to be taken seriously, and I
took digs at individuals who I suspect won't take offence. :)
