&gt;On the weekend I had to rebuild a home system due to a hdd about to crash.
&gt;After installing W98 on a 2.4 Gb partition, creating a D: partition of about
&gt;1 GB, I then proceeded to re-install SuSE 6.2 on the remaining ~3Gb (plus
&gt;swap partition).

Gottit (I think)

I had similar trouble with both RH 5.2 and SuSE 6.0

Problem is that you have created 1 logical partition (C:) 1 extended
partition (D:) and are now attempting to install to free space which will
require a further extended partition (for your Linux progs) and a further
logical partition (for the swap file).  NOT ALLOWED (by DOS, nor by RH, and
from your experience not by SuSE, either).
I solved the problem by buying a second HD & putting Linux on that :-).

You might solve your problem by installing your WinDOS OS on C: then Linux
on D: (partitioned, not formatted) the remainder, E: will probably work OK
as a second WinDOS partition - if that's what you want.

You must be using NT4 on Drive C: ?  Otherwise why not put all that WinDOS
rubbish on C: (using as little space as possible for this unworthy purpose)
and 
use all the remaining free space for SuSE Linux to do with as it wills?
