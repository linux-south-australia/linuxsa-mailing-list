Yep, 

I installed Manduck 6.1 on my Cyrix 6x82 PR200 MX based system Monday
night/Tuesday morning. The install interface looks just like the RedHat
6.0 interface, which it would. Everything went in with no hassles,
printing, PPP, sound (SB AWE 64 PnP), X (s3 Trio64) all set up nicely
thank you very much. I am still wading through the apps and KDE themes
and stuff, and this is just the GPL version.I am tempted to buy the
boxed set, it's around $75.00 plus p&h (if anyone has better prices
please email me).

My first impressions are good. It's too early to be definitive, but my 4
users are very happy thanks. Nothing is obviously broken, although I
remember reading something about lpr needing to be updated.

If you have specific questions, email me. The GPL cd cost $9.00
including p&h from LSL Aust.

Cheers,

Bruce
