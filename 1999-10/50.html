Phill,
	I work with Steve (GUNS) at BankSA and the St. George mail administrators
have got their copy of mimesweeper implementing thier own personal power
trips.  It is a cause of major embarresment to most of us when people send
us stuff with a dictionary word that is used cleanly, but is in mimesweepers
black list.  Although to avoid trouble they don't implement the filter for
the upper echelon of executives.

It doesn't let through images.
It doesn't let through executables.
It doesn't let through office docs containing macros
This is fair so far,
It doesn't let through any content that has been encrypted *GRIPE*
It unzips all zip files and applies the above rules
If it cant unzip the zip file because it has a password it declares it
encrypted.
Understands most compression formats ever known.

** I have found one file format that gets through **
ARJ files, encrypted and made SFX.  The people that wrote ARJ must have hand
coded their EXE header because Mimesweeper doesn't recognise it as a PE,
Portable Executable.

On the whole, it makes the mail gateway pretty infuriating for somebody like
me to use, but thats is living in corporate-land for you.  Hats off to the
Mimesweeper people for making such a good product.

Jamz.

   &gt;I have to confess that I nearly wet myself with laughter at the content
   &gt;of the following email I received.
   &gt;It was sent to me in response to my "EMAIL DISCLAIMER" when I did a
   &gt;"Reply to ALL" which included GUNS from BANKSA.
   &gt;
   &gt;Here it is:

&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   &gt;Subject: A message from <A HREF="mailto:vk5ham@seol.net.au">vk5ham@seol.net.au</A> contained material consistent

   &gt;
   &gt;A mail message with subject Re: Truths. appears to contain material
   &gt;consistent with spam mail.
   &gt;
   &gt;The message was sent from <A HREF="mailto:vk5ham@seol.net.au">vk5ham@seol.net.au</A> to the following:

   &gt;Obviously the BankSA(St Georges Bank) MailBot does not have a sense of
   &gt;humour!!
   &gt;
