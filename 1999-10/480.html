&gt; Independent analysts at the Gartner Group say Linux won't gain broad

&gt; Linux Face-Off."

I wouldn't get upset.

Firstly, why are they mentioning Linux?  Well, it's got lots
of press and its sexy.  So if we put it in the title then people
will read our article.

If Linux wasn't getting press, they would have listed it
amoungst the other OSs and noted it potential.

Secondly, Gartner are bad at noticing seachanges.  The
year I did my first networked database project, Gartner
dammed the idea that you would put "enterprise data" on
toy computers.  When I worked on Sun UNIX machines they
said Oracle would never compete with CICS or DB2.  Gartner
also advised against rolling out corporate IP networks,
IP was only for universities its connectionless packets
weren't robust enough for corporate data.

Linux is causing some seachanges, and as usual, Gartner
are missing them, distracted by the Linux v Windows press.

 1. Linux is becoming the reference Unix.  The way Linux
    does things will set the standard for other UNIXen.
    No one will ask "is it UNIX(TM) System V" but "does it
    run Linux programs".

 2. Small Unix players are adopting Linux as their Unix.
    SGI is the best example of this.  Why maintain your
    own OS when your core business is shipping innovative
    hardware?  We are also seeing this with turnkey systems.

 3. The next generation of computer programmers will know
    Linux.  Not UNIX(TM).  Maybe they have written some
    Windows programs, but they certainly will have written
    some Linux programs.  Unix has always had a shortage
    of experienced administrators.  That is about to change.

 4. Linux will be ready at IA64 launch.  Windows will
    only have a 32bit port available, and be unable to
    exploit the 64-bitness of the new chip.

The emergence of a new OS will lead to competition for
ancillary companies that miss the boat.  Training and
hardware are excellent examples of this right now.

All these hardware people aren't supporting Linux
to get sales.  They are supporting Linux because
a mandatory criteria of large companies' PC acquisitions
is "runs current version of RedHat Linux without
modification".  They might be selling 5000 PCs running
Windows and 50 PCs running Linux, but unless they
can supply those 50 they are out of the running.

Also interesting is that Linux is much more amenable to
centralised support than Windows.  This allows interesting
possibilities: for example, an ISP or datacentre could
outsource the hardware and OS maintenance of its machines
quiet cheaply.
