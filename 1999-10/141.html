Hi ppl....

&gt; Do you want a 3 page essay describing the efforts made by a newbie before a

------------snipped ---------------------

Firstly. I am NOT having a go at David for what he said regarding
modems...this diatribe has actually been prompted by  various comments
made by other ppl abt what he said.

Let's face it .... IF I ask a question, or, IF any other known
NON-NEWBIE asks a question, we usually get a CIVIL and relatively
functional answer! So, why is that????? Hmmmm, an educated guess.....
many of us have "EARNED" at least quasi_guru_status so we are
"respected" to a degree! Whereas, an obvious "newbie" has not earned
respect etc etc.

So, what does that really mean.... in a word (2 actually) ELITIST
BULLSHIT!  

It is an unfortunate fact that LINUX is not overly user-friendly and
that even getting a basic linux system running CAN be a nightmare! As
far as I am concerned, anyone who attempts to get linux up & running is
worthy of some respect for having the brains/guts/determination to try! 

Yes, I taught myself linux with little assistance, and then once I had
it working I found a guru & got occassional help/advice....and YES, I am
now somewhat of a "guru" myself (at times) BUT I DO NOT KNOW
EVERYTHING...hell, until i read a message 10 minutes ago I never knew
that "tr" was a linux command and its on my system!! I have never ever
noticed "tr" and I have run slackware/redhat/suse/caldera & debian- some
guru hey!! ;))

Those of us who have a modicum of intelligence are well aware that if we
treat "newbies" in a patronising manner they will say "stuffit" and
probably give up linux as a waste of time... I believe that the whole
POINT is to allow the LINUX "movement" to gain momentum by assisting
more ppl to get into linux..by offering encouragement and the benefit of
our knowledge..not by being rude and at best, vaguely helpful and doing
the "I had to do it the hard way so you can too!" bullshit!! Responding
in that manner merely confirms that the sender really is an anal
retentive prick!

NEWBIES... PAY ATTENTION.... just because you cant figure IT out doesnt
make linux CRAP! LINUX is DIFFERENT to windoze/dos & requires, at times,
a degree of lateral thinking.... AND, just because you dont get a 17
page explanation revealing "everything" doesnt make us RUDE or
PATRONISING.... The ONLY Way to learn linux is HANDS ON... you have to
do it yourself....YES, it is at times very frustrating BUT you learn
that way.... when someone says "RTFM = 'man pppd'" or "try looking in
/usr/doc/howto/serial.howto" they (generally) do it because that IS the
place to go to give you the answer you need... they are not going to
email you the entire manual...SO, whilst some non-newbies need to show
patience & tolerance, likewise, some newbies need to realise that RTFM
and "hands-on" IS how to learn & understand linux and NOT necessarily a
patronising response!


Phil's Helpful Hint#1455, for Newbies ;)
----------------------------------------
IF you type   help  on any linux system, you will get a somewhat
confusing & unhelpful screen containing numerous commands, command line
options etc etc. On SUSE Linux, the german word for help (hilfe) is a
valid command & links you to the SUSE-Help system. Its html & allows you
to view howto's, faqs, whatis stuff & a whole lot more!
So,If you run SUSE-6.2 (or earlier) do this...

ln -s /usr/bin/hilfe  /usr/bin/RTFM

NOW... when you have a problem, type  RTFM   and then hit enter! ;)
Now... you can say with total honesty that you did RTFM!
(AND, there is every chance that you WILL learn stuff & perhaps figure
out your problem on your own.)

Phil.
