&gt; [I'm] mystified as to why sed is such a recalcitrant editor.

Good point.  Time to explain *why* sed doesn't do the job.

Simply put, escape sequences like \n and \r are not regular expressions.
These have their origin in the C printf routines.  The \ is widely used as
an escape character in unix, and it is important to realise the distinction
between "escape character" and "regular expression."  In a printf string \1
escapes the 1 to give it special meaning (ie ASCII SOH)  In an ex, vi or sed
expression the same string escapes the 1 to give it special meaning, but
only in the replacement part of a substitute command (ie the first
"remembered" expression from the find part.)  In the shell \1 escapes the 1
to remove any special meaning.  It so happens that 1 has no special meaning
in the shell and so \1 is logically equivalent to 1.  These are all examples
of \ as an escape; and none of them are examples of a regular expression.

Now turning our attention to sed, I am once again going to be unfashionable
(apparently) and quote from the manual.

  ``s /regular expression/replacement/flags  (2)
         Substitute the replacement for instances of the regular
         expression in  the  current  text  buffer.   Any
         character  may  be used instead of `/'.  For a fuller
         description see ed (1).''

Perusal of ed's man page will reveal no special meaning for \n.  To the
contrary, the ed page denies special meaning for \n:

  ``\c     A backslash-escaped character c  other  than  `{',
            '}',  `(', `)', `&lt;', `&gt;', `b', 'B', `w', `W', `+', and `?'
            matches itself.''

Annoyingly, sed does extend a RE by treating \t as tab, but has no other
character escapes.  This is not surprising if you consider that \b, which is
commonly understood as a character escape for backspace, is already used
(indeed by ed) as a regular expression.

It's notable how many questions that are asked here are answered quite
nicely in the manual.
