&gt;&gt; I have to agree with you totally too, Don! It is the end result
&gt;&gt; stability along with flexibility and security that is wanted. So it is
&gt;&gt; slick as a greased pig to install, but nothing works properly (Am I
&gt;&gt; suggesting Microsoft? hmmm) doesn't make it... In most cases the
&gt;&gt; average person isn't going to use Linux. As it stands now, Linux has
&gt;&gt;
&gt;	Why? This is the big question. Why is the average person not
&gt;	going to use Linux? I mean, a lot of people (myself included)
&gt;	tend to just blurt out the line "Of course, your average person
&gt;	won't use Linux..."
&gt;
&gt;	Why not?
&gt;
&gt;	We have stability, a huge range of apps, so many cutesy graphical
&gt;	config tools it makes me wanna hurl, three tonne of documentation...
&gt;	(Heck, we even have distributions that people pay for...So it isn't
&gt;	the "no such thing as a free lunch" mentality).
&gt;
&gt;	What else is there? Do we need marketing hype? Maybe that's it...?
&gt;	Why? Why does the average Joe still (presumably) not want to use
&gt;	Linux?
&gt;	
&gt;	Anyone got any ideas?

&lt;soapbox groans&gt;
Time for my 2 cents worth. If, and correct my if I'm wrong, the average
computer user is still the average home user then Linux ain't ready for them
yet.
Sure a lot of people use systems at work but generally they don't have a say
in what hardware/software they use. With that already decided for them at
work, the Linux community will only make inroads there via the IT staff in
their company.
