Hi...

&gt; Does anyone have experience monitoring modem usage (like Clobberd from
&gt; Jason) while using a freeware version of radius for authentication? I
&gt; need to monitor for long logins and multiple logins. I understand this
&gt; is built in to commercial radius software but, as we are a non-profit
&gt; group, i'm trying to use as much freeware as possible. Maybe there is a
&gt; freeware version of radius that will do this?

According to Freshmeat, Lucent (formerly Livingston) Radius has been
released under the BSD license.  Check out
<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/appindex/1999/06/24/930203212.html">http://freshmeat.net/appindex/1999/06/24/930203212.html</A>

Lucent radius certainly supports sending a "Port-Limit" reply item,
which lets you specify the maximum number of ports that a user can be
logged into at any time.  There's also the "Session-Timeout" reply item,
which specifies the time limit for the session.  The problem is that the
terminal server has to support the Port-Limit and Session-Timeout
items.  Which terminal server are you using?  Port-Limit certainly works
on a Lucent Portmaster, but if you're using something like portslave on
a Linux box you may have more trouble.

The other option is Cistron radius.  I'm not sure if it's happy about
sending Port-Limit or Session-Timeout.

If you send me more details about what you're using I'd be happy to take
a look at them and see what else I can remember for you.

Awd, Phil, are you guys still using Port-Limit on your Portmasters? 
Does it work on the portslave box as well?

Phil Hutton.
