LRP is pretty neat.  Especially if you use ROM and Compact Flash
as the boot device -- the only moving part is then the fan
in the power supply.

I'm a bit confused by the high ethernet interface count.

The usual small office router looks like this:

   WAN link          VLAN fast ethernet
  ----------- Router ----------------- Switch --- Client PCs
                                              --- Servers
                                              --- Other switches

You'll get much better performance out of this in the
long run, as the switch software will be upgradable
to do cut-through routing in a year or so.  The Linux
router will then only see the WAN traffic and the
start of every TCP/UDP flow.  All the established
flows will be "routed" by the switch.

With only two PCI cards you should be able to run
on a small fan-less system designed for embedded
systems.  A few large US ISPs are experiementing with
LRP and these PCs to replace Cisco 2500s as customer
premises equipment.  This allows significant value-add
services, such as Squid web caches running out of RAM,
that router vendors can't support (as router hardware
designs typically accept only 16MB of RAM).


In my day job I'm looking for someone to build a IP
forwarding engine for the PCI bus.  This would then
allow wire-speed PC routers to be built.  The main
reason for doing this is that it allows the construction
of a high-speed research network independently of Cisco
and Nortel.  This is desirable if Australian high speed
network research is going to become more than just testing
the latest vendor beta code.

So if there is an elec eng student out there looking for a
thesis topic...
