&gt; I noticed this while I was nosying round the EDS maintained southern

Not by a long shot.  The maximum pipe size is 155Mbps.
Brazil is running synchronous gigabit ethernet to most
of its city high schools.

My figures suggest that mirror.aarnet.edu.au serves more
bytes than NineMSN.  Of course, the hit rate is somewhat
lower :-)


&gt; What was amusing as I walked through the rows and rows of
&gt; compaq proliant rack mounted 4-way ppro's was a couple of
&gt; machines off in one corner.

What I found amazing was the huge amount of Intel hardware
serving quantities that could easily be done by much fewer
higher-spec machines.


&gt; When I asked about them I found that they were solaris boxen doing
&gt; the DNS!

When I looked last year they also had a Sun box for e-mail
(sendmail).  This is even more embarrassing, given that
the Exchange product manager was trying to tell me that it
was more reliable than sendmail.  I tried not to laugh when
she said that 20 minutes was an acceptable time for delivery
of an e-mail message -- I told her our users get really upset
if they can't send an e-mail to someone whilst chatting to
them on the phone.

I am being somewhat hypocritical, considering I've been using
MS Word of recent.
