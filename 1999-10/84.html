Hi Group:

I've assisted and been assisted by this mailing list for a little while now,
and I'd like to share an idea that's been bouncing around in my head for a
while. Perhaps we can use this as a basis for a discussion exercise...

I like games, as do many people. The games I enjoy most are real
terrain-type games, like Quake, Duke Nukem, F22 Lightning, Flight Sim 98,
and so on.

Nothing beats a good network game with a couple of friends, dogfighting in
the sky, or deathmatching on the ground. One limitation that I lament is
that, for the most part, everyone is limited to the same game.

Let me explain: [None of the games I am about to describe have quite these
capabilities. I will use real game names to give you the feel of what these
games would "look and feel" like under this concept.]:

Picture the ability to have Player A and Player B playing "Quake" against
computer enemies in an "enemy headquarters" compound. On the same network,
Player C and Player D are dogfighting in "Longbow", in attack helicopters.
What if Player A and B were pinned down and requested air support from C and
D? Player C flys over, and attacks the ground target as requested by the
"Quake" players.

What has just happened in the above example does not happen in currently
available games: two different games have the ability to interact with each
other, using a common "world".

Another example: Perhaps an larger group of 20 people are gathering to play
in a large outdoor world. They divide into two opposing sides of 10 each. 6
persons on each side choose to fight it out in "Duke Nukem 3d", 2 persons
fly helicopters (for example), and 1 person on each side runs a "Command And
Conquer" session. The C&C persons have the ability to see all units in the
area, and can direct (verbally, or by click and drag) each unit. Obviously
the combat players would have agreed to this beforehand. No restrictions
would exist in the game to enforce the movements, however (like in real
life, soldiers can make mistakes, go AWOL, etc).

Some currently available games are designed to work with other games on the
same "world". Werewolf and Comanche are two examples. No games yet are
designed to interface with a common third party "world". Allowing games from
many manufacturers.

Linux would be ideally suited to maintain a "server side" to this concept,
to which new games supporting the concept would be able to join in.

The idea would be to create a virtual "world" on the server (or multiple
worlds?):
	- 3 dimensional coordinate system
	- basic rules for both fixed items (ie, the ground) and variable
items (ie characters).
	- read from client and publish for other clients info about
character units (color, shape, location, direction, heading, etc)

The game software (client) would:
	- provide the user interface (cockpit, weapons control, etc)
	- provide the movement characteristics of the unit (up, down, left,
right, rotation, etc)
	- transmit the movement to the server so that it may be sent to and
seen by other clients 

Anyway, that's it for my bandwidth. If any programmers were to be
interested, I am sure that the group members here could hammer out the
technical specs (I have a more in-depth specification that could be used).
Or, if nothing else, it'd make for a nice chat.

(Author's Copyright): If ever this concept should be developed, I would have
to insist that the specs owned and governed by a committee of users and
developers from the Linux community, and published under GNU, with hooks
made available to any commercial or private entity who wished to develop
clients around it. That would make it freely accessible to anyone who wanted
to work with it.
