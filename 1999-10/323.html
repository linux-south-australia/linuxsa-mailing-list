;-) has LinuxSA really turned into such a mine field?


&gt; I ALWAYS worrying about accidently stuffing up. This is called human nature.
&gt; If you do not worry, then you are over confident. Over confident people
&gt; don't screw up often, but when they do, God help them, cause no-one else
&gt; will.

True.  I think some of the feeling expressed in posts about aliases
like alias rm='rm -i' is really a reflection of how poor an insurance
policy they are.  In the Windows example, the point was that the
rotten thing asks the question over and over in a totally predictable
way.

The problem is that given a _very_ predictable challenge the
temptation is to preempt it, i.e., type the command, hit enter, and
then immediately hit 'y'.  I know that I have stuffed up while such a
scheme has been in place, and probably even mistakenly preempted
non-existent confirmations!

So perhaps the real issue is about the right level of confirmation,
its timing, and its delivery.  Once upon a time the smell they added
to natural gas caused immediate revulsion and alarm, these days most
of us find it vaguely comforting ...
