Hi all,

	Thought some Linux SA people might be interested:

New Support Positions with Linuxcare
------------------------------------

October 1999

<A HREF="http://linuxcare.com.au/">http://linuxcare.com.au/</A>

Have you ever thought of working for Linuxcare? We are:

  o Independant - we deal with Intel, PowerPC, Sparc, ARM and others
    running Debian, SuSE, Red Hat, TurboLinux, Mandrake and more. Our
    only leaning is to prefer open source in everything we do

  o Global - headquartered in San Francisco but running our R&D and
    global support escalation centre out of Australia, with operations
    in Japan and Europe besides

  o Comprehensive - we offer support from individual incidents through to
    24x7, and a range of related services such as certification and
    training

  o Community supporters - we strongly back numerous community projects,
    and give back as much as we can. We know where Linux came from
 
Linuxcare is expanding its local support operation in Australia and is
looking for a support engineer and a senior support engineer to join our
Canberra office. We are seeking people with a broad base of Linux
experience and the ability to solve problems quickly. Experience in the
development or deployment of open source software will be a significant
advantage.
 
The support engineer position has a salary range of $45k-$55k depending on
experience and qualifications. The successful applicant will be expected
to handle email, phone and fax support calls of moderate complexity,
passing on more complex calls to a senior support engineer as needed.
 
The senior support engineer position has a salary range of $55k-$65k
depending on experience and qualifications. The successful applicant will
be expected to handle more complex support problems and liase with
Linuxcare in San Francisco as needed. Some professional services duties
will be required from time to time (that is, supporting customers in a
less real-time manner, perhaps by developing some new code or redesigning
some system that isn't working properly.)
 
Linuxcare has a policy of encouraging employees to contribute to the
development of open source software and documentation and to take an
active role in the open source community. Evidence of current
contributions to the open source community will be highly regarded in your
application.
 
If you want further details on either of these positions then please
contact Andrew Tridgell by email at <A HREF="mailto:tridge@linuxcare.com">tridge@linuxcare.com</A> or by phone
at (02) 6262 8990. 
 
Resumes should be sent to <A HREF="mailto:jobs@linuxcare.com.au">jobs@linuxcare.com.au</A>

Rusty.
