I pass an option in lilo to recognise a 1505 at boot as its the easiest way
to get it to work for me. The guts of it is 

append="aha152x=0x340,12,7,1"   

Use the part inside the quotes to recognise the card for installation then
add it &lt;ALL&gt; into your /etc/lilo.conf once your installation is done (unless
you get asked if you want to pass options at boot, if so, insert it there -
If that makes no sense ask the list if someone can explain it better. Sorry,
I haven't done a RH install for a while.)
You'll have to change the settings to suit your hardware as mine is
obviously set to i/o 340 and irq 12. The 1505 has jumpers to set it all so
check the 1520 carefully just in case it has too.

The SCSI Howto (should be on any distribution or at
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/SCSI-HOWTO">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/unmaintained/SCSI-HOWTO</A> )
talks about the 1502/1505/1520 series cards quite a bit and is worth a read.
Infact it is a definite MUST if you want to get the card running and you
don't know where to start. Sorry but it is one of those docs that is bloody
long so search for '152' and read all the hits you get.

If any of that makes any sense, it was purely accidental.

HI

I'm having some trouble installing Redhat 6.0 on an old 486 with a
Adaptec-1520B SCSI card and a 3 gig IBM scsi. The machine does not have a
cd-rom, so I'm trying to do an FTP install.

When ask I select the correct module from the list and set autoprobe. (The
'specify option' does not ask for irq or base address so I think it's not
needed) If I switch to the F3 screen I see the ata152x.0 modules trying to
install, but it comes back as a fail.

Has anyone has any experience with installing one of these card in an
already running system ?

Any other helpful comments would be great. :)

The card is set to irq '11' and base io unknown DMA '0'

This system was running windows with this card a one stage.

Cheers
    Mike
