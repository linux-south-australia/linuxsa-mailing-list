Hi, I have been following this thread with great interest. Being a "newbie"
to linux and having just thrown it off my system in disgust, I thought I
might add my 2 penneth to the discussion. Some background- I have been an
electronics tech for 24yrs, a ham for 21yrs, and have worked with computers
since before pc's came on the scene (although paul bloody keating took care
of that career!). I have done a lot of work with 6809, z80 and pic assembler
and a little with 80x86 assembler, also a lot with various flavours of basic
but I have had no exposure to unix of any sort (which probably accounts for
my current difficulties?).

After re-partitioning my h/d with fips and installing red hat 6 I had the
problem of my video card not being "known" to X (many thanks to all those
who replied to my request for help).   I eventually got it running after a
fashion in vga @640x480 and figured out the "larger than my screen" desktop-
a nice touch. However in the quest to get a decent resolution I downloaded
and installed the latest Xfree (3.3.3.5 I think) and the real troubles
started. The system would boot straight into Xwindows and nothing I could do
would get me out and back to the command prompt. When I logged out I was
merely returned to  the log-in prompt! I eventually figured out how to start
a terminal window in X, but every time the window would start flashing after
a few seconds and then eventually stop with a message about x respawning
continually. If I tried to then continue to use the terminal window, the
procedure started all over again. I used quite a number of very choice words
at this behaviour as well as every key combination that the book that came
with the cd's said would get me out of these windows- all with the same
(negligible) effect.

It is all well and good to say RTFM but when the M is in a file in the OS
that you can't get running to be able to read said M, it is all a bit
frustrating. In another life (pre-paul keating) I was a tech for a large
computer firm (also pre-pc) and a lot of my job involved acting as a
"translator" between the manuals and the non-technical customers who were
responsible for the day-to-day running of their systems. The little I have
so far seen of linux documentation is woeful- to know what the manual is
talking about, first you have to know what the manual is talking about!
That is where this list (and probably others I don't yet know about) really
come into their own if you let them- they can act as "translator" for
newbies to linux such as myself and help us get to grips with the geek-speak
of linux- BUT if we get flamed for asking what to the cognoscenti are dumb
questions but to us are very real problems, we will retire back to the
relative comfort (??) of microsloth windo$e and linux loses another
potential devotee.

I have been fortunate that my first query met with patient and helpful
replies- I have seen others that were not. Have I given up on linux- no way,
but it will be a little while before I work up the courage to have another
go- and I won't be installing Xwindows until I am sure it has a driver for
my video card...

Cheers, Ken,vk7krj
