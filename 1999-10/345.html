In the next few weeks, I'll be trying to install an Acer 610s (horrors) on a
2940 at home. I'll post results here. Brandon Johnson, in an earlier email
about digital cameras, suggested that SANE may work with TWAIN compliant
devices. Scanners may be a stretch from cameras, but that may be the
direction I head first.

&gt; Subject: 	luck with scanners, anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any luck with scanners with linux?
&gt; 
&gt; After 11 months of trying to get any scanner going
&gt; with linux, I'm very close to going back to wind95.
&gt; I've wasted an awesome amount of time and energy on this.
&gt; 
&gt; Scanner 3
&gt; ---------
&gt; In particular, has anyone managed to get this scanner going:
&gt; 
&gt; Umax Astra 1220S
&gt; ----------------
&gt; 
&gt; This is the latest scanner I've tried.
&gt; It comes with an el kludgo 25-pin pseudo-SCSI interface,
&gt; instead of the standard SCSI which I had expected.
&gt; It also has an el kludgo ISA card with a 25-pin pseudo-SCSI
&gt; interface, and a 25 to 25 pin cable.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't even get "pnpdump" to recognize the existence of the
&gt; ISA card, let alone get the SCSI functionality up or
&gt; get "scanimage" running. 
&gt; 
&gt; I thought that since this scanner is mentioned in both
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-backends.html">http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-backends.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://cdb.suse.de/cgi-bin/scdb?ID">http://cdb.suse.de/cgi-bin/scdb?ID</A>=94041825691&HTML=ENGLISH%2Fcdb_listtemp
&gt; lates%2Fshow_a.htm&INDEX=7368
&gt; 
&gt; then it should be a safe bet. Obviously not.
&gt; 
&gt; Scanner 2
&gt; ---------
&gt; Previously I tried this:
&gt; 
&gt; Epson Perfection 1200S
&gt; ----------------------
&gt; 
&gt; This had at least a standard SCSI-II 50-pin interface,
&gt; but came with some card (PCI, I think) with a 25-pin
&gt; el kludgo plug.
&gt; I didn't even try to get the card going.
&gt; I just bought a SCSI-II to SCSI-II cable for it, and
&gt; plugged it into a Tekram SCSI card, and found that
&gt; at least it did show up as a SCSI device.
&gt; 
&gt; But then I ran the SANE "scanimage" program and found
&gt; that the scanner "hung". I.e. the scanner just showed a red
&gt; light and "scanimage --listdevices" gave up and gave no helpful
&gt; message at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Scanner 1
&gt; ---------
&gt; The scanner before this was the:
&gt; 
&gt; Dexxa 4800 (probably really an Artec AS6E).
&gt; ----------
&gt; 
&gt; I tried the Artec AS6E software on this parallel port device, and
&gt; it gave up after a while with a core dump. "gdb" showed that
&gt; it had a divide-by-zero error.
&gt; I contacted the author about this, but he was not working
&gt; on this software any more.
&gt; 
&gt; ====================================
&gt; Thanks in advance for any useful info.
&gt; If I can't work out how to get a serious scanner going 
&gt; under linux, I'm going to have to unwrap the bundled
&gt; el kludgo software that came with the Umax scanner for wind95.
&gt; I think that ability to support peripheral devices is the
&gt; really major thing which linux is terrible at.
&gt; Every additional peripheral device causes me really
&gt; major stress with linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; ================================
&gt; PS. About the previous enquiry about using linux to
&gt; fix up my old Atari ST SCSI drive, yes, everyone who
&gt; suggested that putting a linxu-file-system SCSI drive
&gt; at /dev/sda to keep the OS happy was right.
&gt; If the first SCSI device has a good FS, then the OS doesn't care
&gt; what the rest have, even though the first SCSI device
&gt; may not even be mentioned in /etc/fstab.
&gt; But now the old SCSI disk (with also an old ACSI interface)
&gt; seems to have no data on it. I'm pretty sure the
&gt; data _is_ there. Looks like to solve this problem, I'm going to
&gt; have to write SCSI software in old C on the Atari.
&gt; I had been hoping that linux SCSI software was going to help
&gt; me here.
