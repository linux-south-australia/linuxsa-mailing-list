Where can I get a SCSI disk doctor for linux, please?

In the old days, when I had a corrupt floppy disk on
the Atari ST, I had a choice of several "disk doctors" to
read any sector on the disk, modify any byte, write it back,
and so forth and so forth.

But now I need one for a SCSI disk which does _not_ have a Unix
file system on it. It's a 110 MB ACSI/SCSI disk for the Atari,
but the Atari software was not able to do anything without
the file system being mounted.
Similarly, I found tools on the Sun SLC which would read
the SCSI disk drive -- but only if it had a Sun-style boot sector.

So now 7 years after my disk drive apparently got a
corrupted boot sector, which I plan to fix, I'm hoping
that the linux repertoire of tools will help me.

I've checked some of the linux software repositories, and have
tried "sformat" and "scsiformat" and "scsiinfo" and "scsi-config".
But all of these either require a valid linux file system
or else only tell me about configuration stuff.
None of them allow me to read/write raw sectors like
a floppy disk doctor.

So, does anyone know of such a tool?
I suppose I could write the software from scratch myself,
using the SCSI spec and the linux SCSI source.
But I was hoping to re-use the common heritage of linux humanity
to solve this problem.

Regards,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Regarding the previous request for info on
SCSI scanners, it turns out that the Epson is generally 
regarded as rather good, and the GT-12000 at $685
is an A3 scanner, which is why it's a bit more costly.
And an author of sane-epson reckons the current epson scanner
back-end should work fine.
Now I just have to work out how to fit an A3 scanner on
my desk, and why anyone in their right mind would want to
scan an A3 document at 800x1600 dpi.
