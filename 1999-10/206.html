Yup - The hotmail folks are, believe it or not, fairly active FreeBSD
contributors, and have funded a number of development projects assocated
with high performance disk I/O (logical volumes, drivers for SCSI 
controllers, etc).  Same goes for Yahoo - Over 3000 FreeBSD boxen 
distributed all over the world.

The really exciting technology for server replication at the moment seems
to be Akamai (<A HREF="http://www.akamai.com">http://www.akamai.com</A>).  Their customers are big-name
content-heavy websites (such as CNN, apple.com, Yahoo, and others)
who wish to make their web sites go very fast.  They install server
farms at well-connected ISPs all over the world (over 1000 servers to
date) which chatter amongst themselves using custom-built protocols to
anticipate and pre-cache bandwidth requirements for their customers.  

If you have a look at cnn.com, you'll see that lots of the images
and movies have URLs that look like
<A HREF="http://a388.g.akamaitech.net/7/388/21/c7c8272db45981/cnn.com/images/9908/swatch.logo.gif.">http://a388.g.akamaitech.net/7/388/21/c7c8272db45981/cnn.com/images/9908/swatch.logo.gif.</A>  
When a user's web browser (or proxy) attempts to do a DNS lookup 
on a388.g.akamaitech.net, the akamaitech.net nameservers return an
IP address from an Akamai server farm which is geographically close
to whichever DNS client originated the request.  The result is that
the content comes from the fastest, closest source available.

For streaming media it's even more fun:  the Akamai servers can
forge UDP packets to make a stream appear as if it has originated from
whichever host is mentioned in the URL;  the user goes to the same
URLs they've always gone too, the content just arrives on their 
screen much faster than it used to and without transnational bottlenecks.

We have the servers for SA/NT in our computer room at work.
Physically they're a group of five 2RU rack-mounted Linux boxes with a
pair of 1RU 100Mbps switches (one for their "external" network
connectivity, another for a private interface they all use for
chattering amongst each other for load distribution purposes).  We
have two sets for reasons which are too complicated to describe here,
and they make the Star Wars trailers on apple.com download VERY fast
(i.e., a couple of megabytes per second -- 100 Mbps clear between my
desktop and our Akamai servers :-) They'll be told about the SAIX
BGP tables RealSoonNow, so most SA ISPs will very shortly be receiving
a benefit from them (we have 100 Mbps into SAIX, so it'll effectively
shift the bottleneck for Akamai-hosted content from the transpacific
links to the SAIX links used by individual ISPs).

So how is this relevent to the thread about Microsoft?  Simple:  
MS invested $25 million in Akamai last week.  Cisco had previously 
invested $50 million in exchange for a 5% stake in the company about
three months ago (the NetAid concert you would have seen in the news
on TV on Sunday night streamed video via Akamai servers all over the
world, with sponsorship by Cisco).  Akamai looks to be a very serious
company with some very serious backing, and a *MUCH* smarter way of
handling load-balanced web serving than the Microsoft alternative
of installing 150 PC's behind a single 100 Mbps link on the other
side of the world somewhere.
