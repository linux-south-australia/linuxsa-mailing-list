Hello Paul.

&gt; &gt; I have had a total of two negative messages about that
&gt; &gt; ridiculous post, and tonnes of positive ones.
&gt;
&gt; I find it hard to believe; you're lying, or people on LinuxSA are
&gt; complete idiots.  The post had `I am an attention-craving child'
&gt; written all over the last half.

You're a bit of a rude bastard, aren't you.

I posted that message to you, personally, not to the list.  Perhaps your
subsequent forwarding of the message to the list suggests a little
attention-craving of your own?

&gt; &gt; It's shit, I know, but hey.  It got some conversation happening.  Then
&gt; &gt; again, as you say, better no traffic than crap traffic.  *shrug*
&gt;
&gt; Some people actually try to use the list to get help.

Do you know how to use the mailing list archive at www.linuxsa.org.au ?  If
you don't, get someone to help you.  Have a look and see how many posts I've
made, and how [hopefully] useful and helpful they've been.

You've made two posts recently - the one I'm replying to publically, and the
one I replied to privately - and surprisingly few in the past.

Now can we stop clogging the list with bullsh*t and start talking about
linux again?  I think I've paid my dues for the 'Truths' post.

&gt; Go away,
&gt; Rusty.
&gt; --
&gt; Hacking time.

Happy hacking, Rusty.  Have a good weekend.

:)
