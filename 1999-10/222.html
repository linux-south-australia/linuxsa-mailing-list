&gt; To give them their due, they have taken an all-MS solution

&gt; UNIX people assume that the lack of scripting administration
&gt; tools, the sheer box count, the poor subsystem modularisation
&gt; and the like should make this sort of installation extremely
&gt; costly to manage.  It would be interesting to see if that is
&gt; actually so.

&gt; If people could put aside their biases and act politely
&gt; to our hosts then it would be a worthwhile few hours.
