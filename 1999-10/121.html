&gt;The function of a good mail distribution list.

This was a fine analogy

&gt;Please don't reply to this message on the distribution list.

Que?

&gt; With SuSE 6.2 linux, I got about 1300
&gt;applications. If I spend 30 minutes reading the manual of
&gt;each one, that's 16 weeks of full-time study.

And by the time you reached the end you would have forgotten what you read
in the beginning :-(
Reading alone doesn't help much with a practical application like
computing, anyway.  Remember the good old days (5yrs ago? Less?) when each
piece of software came with a comprehensive manual, and this manual had a
Tutorial as its first chapter (with helpful cross referencing to detail
explained in later chapters)?  &lt;sigh&gt;

&gt;Too many people just say "X doesn't work. Does anyone know
&gt;what the problem is?" Questions must have _detail_!!

Hmmm ...
Linux doesn't recognise my Printer (says it isn't ready - suggests it is
offline).  It also doesn't recognise my modem.  Both were OK on SuSe 6.0 on
2.2.6, neither works with SuSe 6.2 on 2.2.10.  What "_detail_!!" would you
expect me to know you need in order to help me?  Would it be impossible for
anyone to point me to the right documentation, or suggest a config file
(and location) I might examine, without the "_detail_!!" ?
Have you any idea just how many configuration files there are, and how
widely scattered they are, in Linux?  I guess some gurus might, but I
don't.  I'm just confused.

However, generally, I agree with what you have said.

&gt;Anyway, now I have a question:

I don't even understand your question :-(
