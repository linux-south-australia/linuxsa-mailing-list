As the subject states.... it's just MY opinion.
Each to their own. I only had the PC World "freebie" SuSE6.2 but as to
_why_ I think it's "much nicer" than Redhat...

I've been running an old 486dx33 with a slackware 3.1 installation for
about 4 years now, upgrading kernels along the way. I currently have the
2.2.12 kernel running happily on an obviously out-of-date distribution.
I played about with other machines and installs in that time including
Redhat 4.2, 5.0, and 5.2 but I admit not the latest Redhat 6.0 or 6.1
Now agreed redhat is pretty slick, and pretty well works out of the box.
But SuSE worked fine for me, AND had several "full install" options, so
the installer could choose between a KDE install, Gnome, or any
combination of packages he/she wishes. But this is also true of redhat I
know. 
The yast tool also provides a comprehensive range of options for not only
managing software package installs/uninstalls, (from .rpm's or .tgz's or
even .deb's) but also hardware devices, and even system configurations.
All from a nice "user friendly" curses interface for the uninitiated
newbie.
Now I doubt whether a "true" linux user would actually just start using
their new installation without 'tweaking' it to suit themselves, but for
newbies I believe SuSE has more control than redhat without the need for
comprehensive reading of the HOWTO's and man pages. In fact nearly
everything can be setup before you boot your new linux system for the
first time. Other distributions do this too you say? No doubt they do.
But for the "newbie" to linux on an SuSE system, "yast" is about the only
command they need to know!
And anyway, if you want a true unix-like linux everyone knows slackware is
closer to the mark, and forces the user to learn more about how their
system is configured since almost nothing works straight "out of the box".

But as far as fancy GUI interfaces go, I "like" SuSE. I still "prefer"
slackware as far as linux's go. But c'est la unix!
