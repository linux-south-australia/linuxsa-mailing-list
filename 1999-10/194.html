Hello Folks,
      I work in an environment where WINDOWS NT 4.0 is the only plattform 
for development which is extremely the contrary to my previous positions.  
However, my network for my private business is based on Linux.  I don't want 
to claim to have the answers to all of the points pointed or claimed by 
Microsoft against Linux.. For some things in that article, I was sure the 
claims were inaccurate and for others, I didn't have an answer.
      The deal is that I would like to hear the defense from whoever has any 
against those claims.  Simply for the fact that I would like to know how to 
recommend my system.  But please, don't make statements like "Microsoft is 
trying to scare people away from Linux" and all that.. We all know that.. I 
like direct technical feedback if possible.  Pointing me to a link will also 
be acceptable..
I appreciate your patience
Nour Douchi

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;Microsloth has finally decided to recognise Linux in their own way.
