&gt; How do you fix it?  Load the file into vi and type:

As you mentioned later in your post, it's probably preferable to
use binary mode, where the carriage-return sticks out like the
proverbials ...

    :set binary

or stick that in your .exrc (or equivalent).

&gt; Ultimately, this is a vi bug.

The vi that ships with RedHat is some trimmed down version of vim,
as they supply both (my vi and vim are substantially different in
size, but I seem to recall that I did recompile vim at some stage
for some added functionality).

&gt; The CR characters *are* in the file, 
&gt; and vi should bloody-well show them.  To bury a "dos mode" annunciation
&gt; away briefly at the bottom of the screen and then let you carry on 
&gt; editing what is essentially a corrupted file without giving you any
&gt; hint about the bogus data it contains (and will continue to contain,
&gt; even though visual inspection suggests otherwise) is bad behaviour.

I'd say probably bad RedHat behaviour in their attempt to be "DOS migration"
friendly; a bit like aliasing "rm" to "rm -i" in root's profile.

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
