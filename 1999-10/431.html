Yeah....All those inputs would need to be converted from voltage levels
to bytes, and you'd probably need dedicated hardware for that and the
output too...
My car has a plug near the glovebox that apparently does 8192 baud
serial and provides a stream of information about the ECM. Doesn't allow
adjustment of parameters though, because as you say, that's stored on
EPROM. It's a 16k EPROM I think, and I was thinking it would be nice to
replace it with a 32k EPROM and just wire the highest bit of the address
line up to a switch on the dash...And then just toggle between 'economy'
and 'performance' banks of data. (Probably requiring engine to be turned
off inbetween of course.)

However that Haltech thing sounds like an easy way to fiddle with the
running parameters - I've heard that they're relatively easy to fit,
just dropping in basically - but are they expensive?
There's always WINE for emulating windows I guess, and their protocol
might be easy to figure out..We've done it before ,)

&gt; Hi...
&gt; 
&gt; Yeh... ECM's in cars do run relitivly slow, but they are very very well
&gt; programmed. It would be possible but very difficult to get a linux box to
&gt; replace a standard ECM. The hardest bit would be getting timing and IRQ's
&gt; acting the way the ECM would.
&gt; As far as i know, its not possible to control a standard ECM via PC because
&gt; the memory maps it uses are normaly in EPROM. Some people have come up with
&gt; replacements for the EPROM which are actualy flash ram that can then be
&gt; changed on the fly via a PC.
&gt; 
&gt; If you wish to do this, the best way would be to get somthing like a Haltech
&gt; ECM installed. They have an external RS232 port for monitoring and changing
&gt; of parameters. As far as i know, Haltech only have software for windows9x
&gt; machines and may not be willing to release info on thier RS232 interface
&gt; coding.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW... Haltech are an Adelaide based company.

&gt; &gt; Heyas
&gt; &gt; I was reading up on car engine management computers last nite - and I
&gt; &gt; wondered how hard it would be to hook up a laptop running linux to
&gt; &gt; control an engine... Engine computers are dedicated microprocessors
&gt; &gt; running at just a few Mhz, so surely a 486 running at 33MHz with a
&gt; &gt; minimal linux kernel would be able to keep up?
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm not imagining a laptop running it fulltime, everyday of the week,
&gt; &gt; but it'd be handy for doing diagnosis, testing, and tweaking though.
&gt; &gt; Then when you've solved the problem swap back to the normal ECM. Or if
&gt; &gt; you find better performance statistics adjust the settings of the
&gt; &gt; standard ECM to them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What kind of hardware is available to provide the fairly low speed, but
&gt; &gt; accurate, I/O?
