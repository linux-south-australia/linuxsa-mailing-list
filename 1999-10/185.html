<H1>Can't format ext2 partition with SuSE</H1>

On the weekend I had to rebuild a home system due to a hdd about to crash.
After installing W98 on a 2.4 Gb partition, creating a D: partition of about
1 GB, I then proceeded to re-install SuSE 6.2 on the remaining ~3Gb (plus
swap partition).
The process happily creates a swap and formats it but when it attempts to
format the ext2 partition (~3 Gb), it falls over very quickly and returns
saying their was an error formatting the partition. Maybe SuSE has a limit
on partition size but I doubt it.

I attempted to install Redhat 6 APC version and all goes well during the
format of the same partition. That kinda stumped me. I have successfully
installed SuSE from these CDs before so the install media is OK. 

The hdd is a brand new 6.5 Gb Quantum IDE. The only thing I can think of is
low-level formatting the drive and starting again but that involves a lot of
repeat pain installing all the Win98 stuff again.

Has anyone got any ideas??

&lt;general comment section&gt;
I highly recommend SuSE to anyone. It thinks differently but if you have
installed RH before then you should be able to guess your way and YAST (yet
another setup tool) is very smooth. You can install or remove X, Kde,
Staroffice (or anyone of the 1300 apps that comes on the 6 CDs) with ease.
You can even test X config changes if you are having trouble finding the
right settings for your hardware. Kinda takes all the pain out of it.
