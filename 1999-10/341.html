&gt; Has anyone on here tried out the Mandrake version 6.1 installs yet? I
&gt; was thinking of upgrading from RH5.2... I have heard they have ALL the
&gt; nice X goodies already on the CD's and is slicker than a whistle to
&gt; install...
&gt;
&gt; Any and all advise taken (well atleast like a month old snack
&gt; cake)=[;^)

I've just peformed install (from scratch not upgrade) of both RH6.1 and 
mandrake 6.1.

My experiens is that it was unessesary difficult to get X working under 
RH6.1 (My videocard is as Matrox G200 AGP, 8MB RAM) Under RH6.0 it got 
detected and installed imideately but under 6.1 i had to give up (did not 
put too much effort in resolving troubles though...) The problem with 6.1 
was really setting up the monitor. I never managed to get a stabel picture. 
So my conclusion of RH6.1 is that it is a step taken in the right direction 
but resulting in a tumble due to RH being a bit to eager toget 6.1 out. 
Laks som consistens in the setup prosess. Needs to be more dynamick. Where 
did network setup go??? Why cna't you go back on your choise of monitor ? 
Where did the custom monitor choiche go? etc...

Mandrake is a whole other story. Install prosedure like RH6.0 but with KDE 
as standard desktop with differnet goodies. Just a litle bit of tuning of 
the install prosess and I will starting to recomend Linux to non-technical 
WIN users.

Regards Jo
