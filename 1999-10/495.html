Morgan & Banks Technology News for October 1999

.........BIG SNIP.......


Intel announces gigabit network adapter for Linux
-------------------------------------------------
Intel Corporation has released the driver source code to allow its Gigabit
Ethernet Network Adapter to work with the Linux operating system. This
will allow companies to configure Linux-based servers for more widespread
use by allowing more users to attach to a Linux server. According to this
story, more than 90% of Linux installations are presently run on
Intel-based computers. The Linux source code is available from Intel's Web
site. Companies will be able to customize the driver to suit their own
needs. 


Adaptec ReZoom
--------------
Adaptec Inc. has introduced a new software tool that allows a user to
mirror a hard disk drive without needing a RAID (Redundant Array of
Inexpensive Disks) controller. ReZoom works with a second hard disk drive
to constantly mirror the contents of a PCs primary disk drive. If the
primary drive fails, the secondary drive immediately takes over to run the
PC. When this happens, a wizard in the package attempts to repair the
primary disk drive. Unlike RAID solutions, ReZoom works with drives of
different sizes. The secondary drive can be programmed to mirror only part
of the primary drive. ReZoom also works with both IDE and SCSI drives. The
product will be available in November and is priced at USD 79.95. 


More varieties of Melissa
-------------------------
According to PC Week, several more varieties of the computer virus
"Melissa" have been identified. Given the ease of writing a Microsoft
macro virus, it is likely that dozens of new Melissa varieties will emerge
in the near future. PC Week suggests that companies take the following
five actions to protect against this virus:

1 - Install anti-virus software on the e-mail server, the file server and
on each desktop or laptop PC
2 - Update virus definitions once a day
3 - Check DLL files for viruses
4 - Establish a company policy warning employees not to run executables
that arrive via e-mail
5 - Warn employees not to download holiday greeting cards.


E-mail with a use-by date
-------------------------
A start-up company named Disappearing Inc. has developed a way to limit
the lifetime of e-mail messages. Once opened, they remain readable only
for the timespan set by the sender. The e-mail system involves a public
key which is sent to the receiver separately. The key will un-encrypt the
message only for the time determined by the sender. Once the key
self-destructs, the message becomes unreadable. The service will be
available early in 2000. 

Regards,
Neville Skinner.
