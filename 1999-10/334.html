&gt; The article mentions that if PostgreSQL is used for storing

&gt; corrupts the database because of fields over-writing other fields.

It doesn't, however, mention what data type they were using (except
that they weren't using BLOBs).  It also doesn't mention what version
of Postgres they were running, sans a comment "a commercial site I
deployed some months ago", which would most like predate 6.5 and
possibly 6.4.2 as well.  From reading the article, the errors only
occured with entering data through the JDBC interface, which may
(I can't remember, been a while since I've looked at the JDBC
stuff for Postgres) be taking a different access path than via libpq.

&gt; If postgreSQL has such obvious serious bugs in it,
&gt; then I wonder if it is really suitable for 
&gt; serious applications where people stand to lose money
&gt; if data is corrupted or lost.

I (IMHO) can't see why people store large amounts of text data
(or binary data, for that matter - what was that pointless map web
site that Microsoft used to go on about?) in relational databases
in the first place.  I still have enough faith in Postgres that
I will leave my home/business accounting system (such as it is)
based on it, and enough faith in systems in general to do regular
backups.

&gt; Maybe this is why slashdot uses mySQL!

Maybe they use mySQL because it suits their purposes better.
There is no one best database (although there probably is
at least one worst).
