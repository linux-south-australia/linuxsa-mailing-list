THIS IS A FICTITIOUS LETTER TO A WELL-KNOWN CHARACTER:
------------------------------------------------------
Dear Mr Gates:

As you are aware there is an open source and essentially free operating
system called Linux. It has existed for a number of years now and many
ISP's prefer to use it and its free web server, Apache, above your own
products NT. The linux community of users support a number of companies.
A non=exhaustive list could be: RedHat, Caldera and SuSe. Furthermore
these companies, and linux, have neither made themselves open to
anti-competition litigation or for that matter even had to produce a
user-friendly product.

What linux provides is stability, configurability and speed. Windows on
the other hand is relatively easy to use (for a new comer), not so
stable, certainly not configurable and slow. The linux community
embraces competition. Therefore its aim is certainly not to wipe out
your product line Windows, but to help Windows AND Linux become better
products through Adam Smith's `invisible hand'. Nonethless we are
pragmatic and we realise the benefits of becoming partners with your
current line of products, Window. The linux community has found the
perfect solution to our dilemma. It is a solution which is legal and
which would still allow you and your company, Microsoft, to make huge
profits out of your Windows product lines.

Our suggestion is this: either construct your own version of linux
(Microsoft Linux), or use an existing distribution such as SuSe, and
bundle it with every Windows product you sell. That way for those who
want a really widely used system such as Windows they have it.They will
still buy Microsoft Office, Visual Basic and the plethora of other
programs your company makes. For those who want something which is
considerably more stable, configurable and fast, Linux is there and you
haven't lost a sale. For those who want both, they can dual boot. You
could even have an option in the original setup scripts to handle all of
these situations; this could all be achieved for the price of one CD-ROM
and the time taken to burn it!

Please contact us at your earliest possible opportunity so we can
discuss this further.

THE LINUX COMMUNITY
[whoever we are]
