&gt;Hi ppl....

&lt;HUGE snip&gt;

Thanks for yours and David's (and others) empathetic posts on this issue.
Could I just emphasise something which has been touched-on but not amplified?
Ken Johnson describes his situation, which is fairly typical - he has HEAPS
of knowledge and experience with PCs - but NONE of Unix.  Obviously going
back to baby from expert involves its own problems.

Guess #1 Every subscriber to this list started with a book in one hand and
a computer in the other, trying to work out how to use the system.
Production was not the issue in this early stage, learning was.
Guess #2 Every subscriber to this list now relies on their PC for some
activity which is important to them, and they are thoroughly familiar with
the system which provides that activity.
Guess #3 It is ludicrous to transfer from Linux to Windoze or other OS, so
all transfers are TO Linux.

Issue A: the transferee MUST continue to be productive - ie use the other
OS - until such time as an appropriate Linux alternative can be employed.
Issue B: Linux is VERY difficult and time-consuming to configure, and the
documentation is woefully complex.  Finding that Linux alternative might
involve more time and energy than can be spared if the demands for
production in the other OS are to be met.

Hence my suggestion for a 'newbie night'.

Enough on this thread, I guess.
