I am glad, David, that you have now established that you know more about Linux and modems than me.  I got 2 replies to my post; one was helpful and pointed me in the right direction, the other one was sarcastic. In a couple of paragraphs you managed to tell me nothing. 

As a suggestion to you and the entire list (and one which I am sure has been voiced here before), could everyone who thinks that a question is stupid or uneducated please restrain before hitting the &lt;RTFM&gt; macro they seem to have automatically set in their mail tools. Fine, if you want to chastise someone for not reading enough, put that at the beginning of your mail, and I am sure it will make you feel better. But really, do you think all us newbies have not bothered to at least attempt to solve the problem? Usually, posting to the list means we don't know where to go from here. 


regards,
Andrew O'C

&gt; How curious.  This question just came up on another list.  There is only
&gt; one satisfactory answer, which is that you have to read the manual for
&gt; *your* modem.
&gt; 
&gt; Just as putting a thick AC power cord on your computer doesn't make it
&gt; run faster, so talking to your modem using a faster serial speed doesn't
&gt; make it talk to the remote modem any faster.
