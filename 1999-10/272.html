&gt; Hi... I logged into ORACLE's site 
[snip]
&gt; 
&gt; So, has anyone tried this ORACLE version.. is it any good etc etc????
&gt;
I have the developer licensed CD of Oracle 8i for Linux. I have stooged
around with Oracle 8.0.5 on a TurboLinux box, it ran ok but was
obviously an early pre-production environment. When I got 8i and saw the
requirements for disk and RAM just to install the darn thing I decided
to play at work instead, on the AIX boxes. We are on Oracle 8.0.4,
hopefully going to 8i sometime next millenium.

At home I use mySQL, and have also run up postgreSQL. Both fine
databases. A full Oracle server environment is beyond scope on my
resources. I think from memory 128Mb RAM to even install it, and 256 to
do any meaningful work. I can check those out if you want.

By the way you could subscribe to the Oracle Technology Network for free
Oracle CDs if you want developer license access to new Oracle products,
including Oracle on Linux products. You subscribe on their OTN page and
keep watch for new product announcements. It's a bit nerdy, but you get
the CDs no drama. They have a discussion group dedicated to
Oracle/Linux.

email me off-line if you want me to look up any of the details on the 8i
CD.

Bruce
