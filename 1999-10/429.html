Hi...

Yeh... ECM's in cars do run relitivly slow, but they are very very well
programmed. It would be possible but very difficult to get a linux box to
replace a standard ECM. The hardest bit would be getting timing and IRQ's
acting the way the ECM would.
As far as i know, its not possible to control a standard ECM via PC because
the memory maps it uses are normaly in EPROM. Some people have come up with
replacements for the EPROM which are actualy flash ram that can then be
changed on the fly via a PC.

If you wish to do this, the best way would be to get somthing like a Haltech
ECM installed. They have an external RS232 port for monitoring and changing
of parameters. As far as i know, Haltech only have software for windows9x
machines and may not be willing to release info on thier RS232 interface
coding.

BTW... Haltech are an Adelaide based company.

&gt; Heyas
&gt; I was reading up on car engine management computers last nite - and I
&gt; wondered how hard it would be to hook up a laptop running linux to
&gt; control an engine... Engine computers are dedicated microprocessors
&gt; running at just a few Mhz, so surely a 486 running at 33MHz with a
&gt; minimal linux kernel would be able to keep up?
&gt; Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt; I'm not imagining a laptop running it fulltime, everyday of the week,
&gt; but it'd be handy for doing diagnosis, testing, and tweaking though.
&gt; Then when you've solved the problem swap back to the normal ECM. Or if
&gt; you find better performance statistics adjust the settings of the
&gt; standard ECM to them.
&gt;
&gt; What kind of hardware is available to provide the fairly low speed, but
&gt; accurate, I/O?
