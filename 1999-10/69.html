RED HAT LINUX 6.1 SHIPS
by Dave Murphy, <A HREF="mailto:member@itrain.org">member@itrain.org</A>

Red Hat released today the latest version of their top-notch 
Linux operating system, version 6.1. I'm running version 
6.0 at our offices, and it's been rock solid and much faster 
than our Novell NetWare servers. I'm looking forward to 
installing the version 6.1 upgrade.

Here's some information from Red Hat's press release 
today...

The latest release of the Red Hat Linux operating system 
incorporates easy installation, software update 
information and access, and improved system 
management capabilities. These new features enable 
users to harness the power of open source software in the 
demanding enterprise and Internet applications that run 
the day-to-day business of companies worldwide. 

Red Hat Linux 6.1 extends Red Hat's commitment to 
customer service and the strength of [true] open source 
development by incorporating improvements that make it 
easier to install, maintain and manage Linux-based 
computing environments. Users can move quickly through 
installation with graphic-based directions, choosing from 
GNOME, KDE, server or custom interface settings, with 
seamless integration of software RAID configurations to 
safeguard critical data and application availability. 
Additionally, the PXE 2.0 technology (part of the Wired for 
Management Baseline 2.0) enables Red Hat Linux 6.1 
installations to be done across the network, with no need 
for local media.

Red Hat Linux 6.1 also provides customers with fast 
access to the latest software technology from Red Hat 
through the Red Hat Update Agent, an online customer 
service application for retrieval and management of 
software updates. Red Hat has combined the RPM 
package management technology with the Internet  
capabilities of Red Hat Linux to seamlessly enable 
customers to take advantage of the continuous technology 
improvements offered from the open software 
development community.

"We expect that the improvements in installation, service, 
support and performance built into Red Hat Linux 6.1 
make it an asset to enterprise networks," said Bob Young, 
CEO of Red Hat. "Red Hat Linux 6.1 combines the power, 
stability and flexibility of Linux-based open source 
operating systems with tools and services to handle 
critical business applications that ensure the peace of 
mind for corporate users."

Red Hat Linux 6.1 applies many advances in the 2.2.12 
Linux kernel and the collaboration of the open source 
community, including improvements for high availability 
Internet server clustering and new Web or email-based 
configuration support for the Apache Web server. 

"Open source continues to make great advances and 
delivers innovation to enterprise users worldwide. We see 
rapid advances in Linux-based operating systems as a 
result of the open source development model," said 
Young.  

"Red Hat Linux 6.1 will be an attractive option to the 
businesses, Internet service providers, government 
agencies and universities that make up nearly three-
fourths of our customer base." said Michael Lambert, 
senior vice president, Dell Enterprise Systems Group. "We 
plan to offer this OS on selected products throughout our 
entire product line, from notebooks to servers, in the 
months ahead."

Additional features of Red Hat Linux 6.1 Include:

  - The first distributed English version of Sun 
Microsystems' office suite Star Office 5.1a, a complete 
office platform featuring word processing, spreadsheets, e-
mail, graphics, web publishing, scheduling, database and 
management applications.

  - Full LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) 
integration, enabling administrators of large networks to 
manage distributed computing by authenticating and 
maintaining information about users and network 
services. 

  - 128-bit secure signature technology, Red Hat public key 
verification of the source of Red Hat Linux 6.1 updates. 
Available in the US and Canada only.

Through collaboration with Intel Corporation, Red Hat has 
also included PXE server support, optimizations for the 
Intel Pentium III processor, and remote management 
enhancements through support for the Wired for 
Management Baseline 2.0 specification as part of Red Hat 
Linux 6.1. 

"Intel continues to work closely with Red Hat and the open 
source community to make Linux run best on Intel 
Architecture," said Michael Fister, Vice President and 
General Manager of Intel's Enterprise Server Group. "Red 
Hat's new release of the Linux operating system has been 
optimized for the Pentium III Xeon processor and this 
combination offers customers the performance that is 
required in today's Internet economy."

Pricing and Availability

Open Source Momentum
International Data Corp. (IDC) research states that Linux-
based operating systems were the fastest-growing server 
operating environment in 1998, growing more than 190 
percent in that year alone and capturing more than 15.8 
percent of the 4.4 million revenue shipment server 
operating environment market.

Red Hat's numerous alliances with industry leaders and 
the demand for Linux-based applications have created 
open source support from many of the industry's leading 
software and hardware manufacturers, including Compaq, 
Computer Associates, Corel, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, Intel, Netscape, Novell, Oracle and SAP. 
Red Hat Linux runs on Intel, Alpha and Sun SPARC 
platforms.
