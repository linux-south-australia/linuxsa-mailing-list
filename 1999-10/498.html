Hi Michael,
    I am *into* Linux Games. I have played CivCTP and Civ
for that matter for a number of years, and I am very
impressed. I deliberately purchased CivCTP from Loki to
encourage this kind of thing. The game is a REAL
strategy/Management game, not just a shoot em up arcade game
and it has ported from the other OS quite well. I am quite
well into Games of all kinds, I am a part time Game
designer, and I have recently started up a board game
company with a friend to sell some of our creations. We are
mainly into Strategy Management style games.

    As far as other Linux games, I recently beta tested
RailRoad Tycoon for Loki, and found the port to be very high
quality (in fact there were very few problems, so we wish
listed features and corrected spelling errors more than
anything.) Linux has proved with Doom, Quake, and CivCTP
etc. that it is more than capable of porting high quality
games, and I would encourage it, as the spin offs in other
areas would really help Linux along. An example of spin offs
would be hardware and software development as has occurred
with the other operating system. A few years ago, some
people struggled with 16Mb of Main Board memory, let alone a
16Mb Video card.

    I bought CivCTP from Netcraft, and I am waiting for Loki
to send my cheaper copy of RRT. At present I am not
interested in Network Gaming as such.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Civilisation and Linux games


&gt;Hi all
&gt;
&gt;I would love to know how many of you are interested in
&gt;Linux gaming.  Is there anyone who believes that Linux
&gt;is only for servers, or that Linux is not good enough
&gt;for high performance Windows style games?
&gt;
&gt;Also, has anyone bought CivCTP, or any other
&gt;commercial linux games?
&gt;
&gt;Would anyone like to play multiplayer Linux games
&gt;online or in a LAN environment?
&gt;
&gt;
