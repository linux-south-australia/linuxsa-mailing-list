Would one or more Linux SA subscribers care to help me get up and
running in Linux?

Aim:  To initially install a dual boot system that will accommodate both
my existing WIN 98 operation and Linux based on Red Hat 5.2 (It's all
I've got at the moment).

Resources:  CPU  166 MHz Pentium
                      RAM  32 mb
                      HARD-DRIVE  2,1 Gb; 1.4 Gb available
                      The Linux Pocketbook & CD - Red Hat Linux 5.2

Progress so far:  Have created a Linux boot disk containing FIPS /
RESTORRB / FIPSDOC\ERRORS, which functions satisfactorily insofar as it
boots successfully and FIPS brings the partition table onto the screen.

Problem: FIPS will go no further after announcing an 'error' - &lt;Unknown
file system: OEh&gt;
followed by &lt;System indicator byte must be 4 or6&gt;

Any assistance that can be offered will be most gratefully received.
Please keep in mind that I am not a computer 'whiz' and have very little
prospect of becoming one.  Indeed I probably would not even be
attempting this were it not for Microsoft's megalomaniacal indifference
to what Jo User wants in a PC.

(I must respectfully suggest to Don Collins, that historically, in any
field of human behaviour, the most dangerous threats have been posed by
those who proposed to know what was best for other people, and to
enforce it on them)

I look forward to the renowned generosity of the Linux community in SA,
Graeme Moyse
