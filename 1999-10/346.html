Justin,

=====================================================
&gt; You seem to be very much against PostgresSQL.
&gt; Have you tried it?
&gt;
&gt; I would be interested in hearing your experiences.
&gt;
&gt; Justin.
=====================================================

Yes I have tried PostgreSQL.
And that's why I'm against it.
I couldn't find any documentation of the "Oid" enumerator
in the C API, and that meant that I couldn't work out
what I was being sent in native format.

In fact, I'm against just about all software in linux, and
in all other operating systems that I have tried.

I think that we are in a medieval age of the computer.
People in 50 years will gasp when they learn in school what
primitive conditions we worked under, what chaos reigned,
what wilful cussedness, etc. etc.
What kind of mentality can be happy with computers which have

5 kinds of SCSI connector
30 different linux distributions
4 kinds of mainboard slot
50 kinds of CPU
10 kinds of disk interface
500 kinds of monitor
50 kinds of mainboard
100 kinds of ethernet card
20 linux window managers
20 file systems
200 kinds of graphics card
100 kinds of webcam camera
50 kinds of printers
100 kinds of scanners
40 programming languages
20 document formats
20 web server/client protocols
20 kinds of LAN
20 kinds of connection to the Internet
30 kinds of text editor
20 kinds of database
500 kinds of microcontroller
20 kinds of RAM
20 kinds of cache
20 kinds of software licence
100 kinds of keyboard
50 kinds of mouse
50 kinds of e-mail client

...and so forth and so forth...

No wonder Macs are so popular.
No options. No stress.
No wonder the East Germans want to go back to communism.
(Computing teachers used to plead with the authorities to send
them photos of computers so that the students would know
what they looked like.)

So really, no, I'm not very much against PostgreSQL.
Not relative to the rest of the IT mess.

PostgreSQL just needs a hexadecimal floating point
transfer syntax, and that would fix up my main problems.
E.g. 0x8x-1 would mean hexadecimal 8 times 16^(-1).

When I went to the MySQL site, I got 2.1 kilograms of
documentation which all looks neat.
The PostgreSQL documentation all seemed incomplete
and was full of comments like "Would someone like to
write this section?" in about half of the sections.

But if we discuss which of the above things is best in
its category, all of them would be superseded by the time
the conversation is over.

In 50 years, I predict that there will be only

one operating system
one programming langauge
one text editor
one kind of SCSI connector !!!
one kind of database !

and so forth.
Standards make your life comprehensible -- if only
there weren't so many!

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

========================================================
PS. The file
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/postgres.html">http://www.topology.org/postgres.html</A>
documents my first experiences with PostgreSQL.
I gave up on it in July 1999, when I realised that I had
to read the source to find out how to use it.

PPS. If you want to hear any more about my experiences, I can tell
you what's wrong with everything else in the world too, if you like.
Things were much better in the antediluvian...
