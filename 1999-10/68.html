&gt; I am curious though...did it just flag my message or did it kill it &
&gt; then tell the intended recipient(GUNS) that he had an email but wasnt
&gt; allowed to read it?!?!?!? :)

Yes, it does kill it, and I get a notification much like your received. If I really want it, I can ask for it to be forwarded - which I don't do, as I get a couple of these every day from various mailing lists. Curiously, though, I still get more spam than is blocked.

Speaking of flagging mail, though, do you suppose that with the word "GUNS" appearing in all my email that NSA like agencies read all my email? Or is that just paranoid?
