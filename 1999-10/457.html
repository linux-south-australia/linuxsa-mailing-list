This is what I was getting at earlier.
I know that car ECMs are extremely efficient, but even given the
massively (relatively) worse efficiency of a fullblown O/S, you'd think
that a 200+ MHz processor could handle a mere 8000rpm. (Which is only
133 revs per second. Isnt a 200MHz processor doing 2 million things per
second? Sure, some instructions take more than 1 Hz to execute, but
still, you've got way, way more than you need..You'd think.)

What someone else said though was that the standard kernel just doesn't
allow you to usleep with enough accuracy. You can ask the processor to
wake you up in 5 ms, but you're not guaranteed that it will be 5ms or
5+ms.. Does anyone know how the rtlinux kernel goes at this though?
If it can get accurate enough, you'd be okay. 

One thought - use the timer interrupt, and write your own device driver
that hooks on it.
Thus, the kernel has a  /dev/ecm0 device. You can access it to read
information, and write to it to set parameters, but the actual
continual-engine-management process is done within the kernel.

The thing is - what is the resolution of the timer interrupt?
It goes without saying that of course you'd have to alter the
block-interrupts function call used by other device drivers so that they
didn't block the timer interrupt. And you'd have to make sure that your
timer interrupt function was pretty quick to execute, and DID have the
ability to block all other interrupts.

You'd probably want a simple hardware board that did the
analog-to-digital conversions for you, too. And then by the time you
start building dedicated hardware, why not make that board do the engine
management itself and just be configurable from the PC?
And if you've done that, why bother to put it in a PC in the first place
- just put it in a box in a car with a serial port on it, and call it a
real ECM. hehe. Go back to step 1.

&gt; Some car ECMs use 2Mhz motorola processors.... you cant tell me that a
&gt; 200Mhz pentium couldnt do the job.
&gt; 
&gt; With a bit of dedicated hardware that efficently uses IRQ's and software
&gt; that is well programed, the PC could act as an ECM.
&gt; I wouldnt want the job of doing it though.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Heyas
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was reading up on car engine management computers last nite - and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; wondered how hard it would be to hook up a laptop running linux to
&gt; &gt; &gt; control an engine... Engine computers are dedicated microprocessors
&gt; &gt; &gt; running at just a few Mhz, so surely a 486 running at 33MHz with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; minimal linux kernel would be able to keep up?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The December 1996 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal had an article
&gt; &gt; about embedded microcontrollers used in engine management
&gt; &gt; systems, and the brief summary of that article is that it's
&gt; &gt; quite hairy, even when you've got a completely dedicated
&gt; &gt; microcontroller right on the scene.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The hard real-time constraints are very tricky to schedule
&gt; &gt; successfully.  You need to compute spark positioning to 0.5
&gt; &gt; crankshaft degrees, or 10 microseconds at 8000 RPM.  This is
&gt; &gt; so demanding that the hard real-time stuff is usually
&gt; &gt; offloaded to a dedicated coprocessor, usually on the same
&gt; &gt; chip as the CPU.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Linux interfacing to the EMS?  Maybe.  Performing the
&gt; &gt; real-time control?  No way -- the hardware (e.g. Intel
&gt; &gt; or Alpha) simply isn't built to support it.
