Hi,
    Try "make clean" in the directory you did the "make
install". This is supposed to clean up the mess you might
have made, ie delete all of the binaries and object files
etc, and also leave you with just the source. If this
doesn't work, then you have a very badly written make file,
and so you will have to print it out and manually delete all
of the files that were created in the make.

&lt;inane drivel&gt;
    The last alternative is the Micro$loth method. First
back up your data, (this step is optional). Then go into dos
mode and type "format c: /u" don't worry Windoze won't
delete itself as any good virus knows that this is suicide.
Then do a full install of Windoze from scratch, (necessary
because even though it works all of your drivers are not
there since they are not critical for operation). Spend the
next week reinstalling your applications and recreating any
critical data (insert month instead of week if you have to
configure NT). Finally replace frustrated grimace on your
face with a big knowing smile and claim that the above
method is "normal for a modern advanced operating system"
when you run into problems and that it was "no major drama
and that you hardly lost any productivity at all". Pray to
your god (or Bill), it doesn't happen for at least another
week.
&lt;/drivel&gt;

    If neither of these methods work then "Operating Systems
: Design & Implementation" by Andrew Tannenbaum has a copy
of Minix II included on CD so you could write your very own
operating system like Linus did and then you won't have to
complain.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Uninstalling Compiled Packages


&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of any good programs which can
automatically remove a
&gt;"make install"ed package? Every now and then I build
something and it
&gt;just refuses to work or I just get rid of it and sniffing
all the
&gt;installed packages manually is time consuming and prone to
error.
