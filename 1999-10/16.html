&gt;Hi Richard et. al.,

Well, I am also concerned about what can be achieved during an install and
after an install as well.

I noticed that Caldera still supports Alt-F2 etc (actually, Cntl-Alt-F2 :-)
where you get a shell and can fix things up.

Since I have an ability to find my way around the shell and the file system
and configure things manually, I do so when it will save time, but I can
also appreciate the slick install scripts etc as well.  Certainly one that
allows you to do all your configuration while the RPM's are installing is
great.

&gt;little concerned that there is way too much emphasis applied to install
&gt;routines of late by users and the press (PC mags etc.).  I for one would
&gt;greatly welcome improvements to most of the Linux installation routines,
&gt;but would hate to think that this is indicative of a shift in mentality
&gt;from performance/practicality based thinking to an emphasis on aesthetic
&gt;issues.  The M$ way of 'getting a larger user base' is almost certainly at
&gt;work amongst the Linux community due to that old evil ... business
&gt;competition ie. Give the people what they want and what we want them to
&gt;want...not what is actually best.  ~shrug~

Well, what I want is software that is easy to use, and has pretty GUI front
ends, but also has all the source available and allows you to drive it from
the command line and get into the guts if you need to.

MS software is seriously lacking in so many respects, and is often
seriously non-intuitive that it is a pain. For example, in Word 97, how do
you turn off those damn autoconverts to hyperlinks of URLs and network
names, like \\samba\public? Well, I know now, but it was impossible to find
... 

Linux can do it better, and open ...

&gt;Anyone else got the same concerns?
&gt;Don.
