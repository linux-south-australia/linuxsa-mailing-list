&gt; &gt; Im sure many people run gigabit ethernet around their organisations, but
as
&gt; &gt; an internet connection the Kidman Park building has 410MBits made up of
a
&gt; &gt; combination of Telstra and Optus links.  I don't have very extensive
&gt; &gt; knowledge, but its the most connected place I've ever been to.

&gt; I was there a while back, and I can't quite remember what they said, but I
&gt; reckon that they have a couple of 155mbps connections to each of telstra
and
&gt; optus, with some other stuff as well for backups.
My question is why do they have such highspeed links to telstra and optus,
when telstra and optus only have a few  not so fast links out of adelaide ?

Or am i wrong again hhehe.
