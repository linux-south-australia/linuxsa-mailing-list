Hi!

Isn't the question of whether or not it's harassment somewhat academic, since
using your systems to send spam is a breach of whatever agreement you get
people to agree to before using SMUG and therefore grounds for suspension of
access?  (I'm not yet a SMUG member, but I'm assuming there's a fairly decent
set of terms.) 

I mean, sure, spam may be exciting and interesting to some people, and
merely an annoyance to others - however, it causes mayhem for those operating
the systems it's relayed through in the form of messages to abuse@, wastage of
otherwise perfectly useful bandwidth, etc. Your spammer may be a net
crusader, out to provide free entertainment and gloriously personalised
advertisement for each and every person with an AOL address, but if he uses
resources he's not allowed to to do it, you should be able to nail his 'ead to
the floor without any qualms whatsoever. I certainly would. &lt;grin&gt;

Perhaps you should allow him to keep his account and ask him to pay for the
having his spam propagated. :)
