Nuts.  That'll learn me to muck with distribution binaries.

&gt; Emacs does slighty better if set up to edit
&gt; DOS files: at least the "DOS" mode indicator is always visible.

I do get the [dos format] indication in the status line, but only
until it's been cleared (as I think Mark pointed out).

&gt; The use of "rm -i" under root is more good practice, rather than
&gt; any DOSism (a DOSism would be "alias del rm -i").

Maybe it's me.  I don't swan about as root unless it's for a good
reason, and it's been a _long_ time (probably before epoch :-) since
I've accidently deleted/copied-over-the-top-of something.  What right
has /bin/rm that it queries my deletion of /etc/passwd?

&gt; Surely people don't start Netscape as root unless they are looking for
&gt; JavaScript bugs?

:-)

  Daryl Tester
