I ALWAYS worrying about accidently stuffing up. This is called human nature.
If you do not worry, then you are over confident. Over confident people
don't screw up often, but when they do, God help them, cause no-one else
will.

Does this mean I shouldn't have root access on my own box ?

I have heard of companies that enforce this alias regardless of how
competent an administrator you are, accidents happen, this is why we have
insurance companies and backups...

If you want a good example of when you should be asked, fsck -Y this can
destroy  multiple disks easily without even asking. Because you said yes fix
every type of error you come across, some errors shouldn't be fixed in this
manner.

This is my HO.

Your HO also alludes to the point that people learning who are genuinely
worried that they will remove files (accidentally), should not have root
access. How do they learn ? They don't turn on the set uid bit, most don't
know how..

A little Paranoia is healthy, a little over confidence is down-right
dangerous.

&lt;/noflame&gt;

Rob.

Okay a long winded way to say I disagree with you on this one point.

&gt; However, I know what I'm doing, and I know that if i'm root I need to be
&gt; extra careful when doing anything. Anyone who is genuinely worried that
&gt; they might accidentally remove files probably shouldn't be allowed to
&gt; have root access anyway, IMHO.
