&gt; Anyway, I'm over that now, and the mystery goes on...what on earth is it??
&gt; Another look at the IBM home-page has revealed concentrator boxes for ATM,

It sounds like a hub for RS232 multidrop serial links.

&lt;setting time machine back to the era of IBM mainframes and SDLC&gt;

Let's say you have an mainframe at a central site and
lots of branch offices.

You put a terminal controller and terminals into each branch
office (in IBM-speak these were called an 3174 cluster controller
and 3270 terminals).

You then have a leased line connecting the terminal controller
into the mainframe's intelligent serial line interface processor
(IBM-speak: front-end processor).

The ports on the front-end processor were expensive -- 10Mhz 8-bit
CPUs were not cheap.  So you want each port on the front-end processor
to drive multiple branch offices.

If you control access to the synchronous serial line using
the RTS and CTS signals, then only one branch office can be
using the serial link at any one time and the FEP port can be
shared.

I suggest that the box you have attaches to a FEP and a number
of serial links, and redistributes the CTS and RTS signals
from one of the links to all the other links.

&lt;historical aside&gt;

The National Library used to do exactly this.  IBM mainframe screen
updates are typically 1-2KB in size.  The links were 4800bps.  So
two to four seconds for a screen refresh on a good day.  When you
were sharing the link with seven other sites then the response time
blew out hugely.

Then one day the NLA was attached to AARNet with a 48Kbps link.
IBM licensed my mainframe TCP/IP implementation that was running at
the Bureau of Statistics and ran it on the NLA's IBM mainframe.
The 3270 version of telnet could then be run to access the mainframe.
Libraries were very, very happy: screen updates were 10-100 times faster.

All of a sudden, 3270 terminals with serial line interfaces
were dumped on the second hand market.  You could even read
the NLA logon screen burned into some of the screens.
