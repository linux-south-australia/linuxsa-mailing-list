&gt; Hi, I have been following this thread with great interest. Being a "newbie"
&gt; to linux and having just thrown it off my system in disgust,

Ahh the first signs of Linux passion... it took me at least 10, no, make that
15 installs on different machines before I felt I had mastered the beast...
(grin)
However, when I think back on my win95 (pre OSR2 days shudder please don't make
me mention that again) I can only say that linux is certainly not in that
category.. At least when you get it on it STAYS on.  I have put linux on at
least 7 different machines now and only one has stumped me.  Could not get it to
find the network card at all or set up sound due to internal problems.  The rest
has been fine, and when I say fine I mean rock steady fine with KDE looking
superb and Netscape taking care of Internet stuff.  Oh my,  if only I could do
without MS Office although I did see VM ware run word just great so maybe I'm
saved.

&gt; I used quite a number of very choice words
&gt; at this behaviour as well as every key combination that the book that came
&gt; with the cd's said would get me out of these windows- all with the same
&gt; (negligible) effect.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; BUT if we get flamed for asking what to the cognoscenti are dumb

Na, we don't get flamed, we just get a gentle push, emm err kick?... in the
right direction and so what!  some of these guys probably live and breath linux
all day every day and sometimes when they are on line,... well who's to say what
type of day they have had.

Just think about something you are good at!  and all the questions that come to
you on that subject, even from the ppl you have told at least 623 times the same
answer to the same question?  I'm guilty of doing the very same thing on
occasion.

&gt; questions but to us are very real problems, we will retire back to the
&gt; relative comfort (??) of microsloth windo$e and linux loses another
&gt; potential devotee.

Sure that's the OK, time and the next blue screen will make you think again and
eventually you'll give it another go, nothing wrong with that at all.

&gt; I have been fortunate that my first query met with patient and helpful
&gt; replies- I have seen others that were not. Have I given up on linux- no way,
&gt; but it will be a little while before I work up the courage to have another
&gt; go- and I won't be installing Xwindows until I am sure it has a driver for
&gt; my video card...

Nice to hear, it took me 2 years to retry Linux after similar probs and the
diffference is incredible from then until now.

Can't wait for KDE2 to arrive, its looking quite stunning, if only they had K
Office at a good level. If only I could code in C++   Oh well, time to step down
from the box.

Check the screen shots for KDE2 from www.kde.org site.

Best wishes

Steve
