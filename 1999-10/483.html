Yes i agree with you 100 per cent, but Gartner is in the position of 
influencing business. I used to work for a company in Adelaide  developing 
Enterprise Database software and were in the fighting ring with Baan and 
Peoplesoft et al.

We were chosen by Gartner to have their experts go over our software. 
People actually dropped contracts at huge expenses after a not so glowing 
report.

How does this affect linux, in general it does not, but it affects how the 
business world ( which IMHO is the last hurdle for linux ) see's and reacts 
to linux.

Look at and observe your enemy but don't ignore them, listen to what they 
have to say.

&gt; &gt; Independent analysts at the Gartner Group say Linux won't gain broad
&gt; &gt; acceptance as a substitute for UNIX and Windows in the enterprise in the
&gt; &gt; near future. IT professionals should read Gartner's "1999 OS Forecast: The
&gt; &gt; Linux Face-Off."
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't get upset.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly, why are they mentioning Linux?  Well, it's got lots
&gt;of press and its sexy.  So if we put it in the title then people
&gt;will read our article.
&gt;
&gt;If Linux wasn't getting press, they would have listed it
&gt;amoungst the other OSs and noted it potential.
&gt;
&gt;Secondly, Gartner are bad at noticing seachanges.  The
&gt;year I did my first networked database project, Gartner
&gt;dammed the idea that you would put "enterprise data" on
&gt;toy computers.  When I worked on Sun UNIX machines they
&gt;said Oracle would never compete with CICS or DB2.  Gartner
&gt;also advised against rolling out corporate IP networks,
&gt;IP was only for universities its connectionless packets
&gt;weren't robust enough for corporate data.
&gt;
&gt;Linux is causing some seachanges, and as usual, Gartner
&gt;are missing them, distracted by the Linux v Windows press.
&gt;
&gt;  1. Linux is becoming the reference Unix.  The way Linux
&gt;     does things will set the standard for other UNIXen.
&gt;     No one will ask "is it UNIX(TM) System V" but "does it
&gt;     run Linux programs".
&gt;
&gt;  2. Small Unix players are adopting Linux as their Unix.
&gt;     SGI is the best example of this.  Why maintain your
&gt;     own OS when your core business is shipping innovative
&gt;     hardware?  We are also seeing this with turnkey systems.
&gt;
&gt;  3. The next generation of computer programmers will know
&gt;     Linux.  Not UNIX(TM).  Maybe they have written some
&gt;     Windows programs, but they certainly will have written
&gt;     some Linux programs.  Unix has always had a shortage
&gt;     of experienced administrators.  That is about to change.
&gt;
&gt;  4. Linux will be ready at IA64 launch.  Windows will
&gt;     only have a 32bit port available, and be unable to
&gt;     exploit the 64-bitness of the new chip.
&gt;
&gt;The emergence of a new OS will lead to competition for
&gt;ancillary companies that miss the boat.  Training and
&gt;hardware are excellent examples of this right now.
&gt;
&gt;All these hardware people aren't supporting Linux
&gt;to get sales.  They are supporting Linux because
&gt;a mandatory criteria of large companies' PC acquisitions
&gt;is "runs current version of RedHat Linux without
&gt;modification".  They might be selling 5000 PCs running
&gt;Windows and 50 PCs running Linux, but unless they
&gt;can supply those 50 they are out of the running.
&gt;
&gt;Also interesting is that Linux is much more amenable to
&gt;centralised support than Windows.  This allows interesting
&gt;possibilities: for example, an ISP or datacentre could
&gt;outsource the hardware and OS maintenance of its machines
&gt;quiet cheaply.
