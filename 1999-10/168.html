Hi everyone!

I wish to show all that helped fix the LILO problem my great
appreciation and thank you heaps!
To my understanding the problem for LILO was the LBA mode for both
windows hdd and Linux hdd!
I am not very technical myself regarding computer terminology, but I
will do my best to put it in such way that anyone encountering same
problem as mine might have a chance to help himself. Of course the
outcome is thanks to all those nice people that were willing to help and
I will only describe my own observations.

Someone  suggested the "cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry" command  with the
outcome:

    physical     3148/16/63
    logical        3148/16/63

- the above in not in LBA mode, but once changed to mode LBA in bios
becomes:

    physical      3148/16/63
    logical            747/64/63

"cat /proc/ide/hdb/geometry"'s command outcome now:

    physical   3876/16/63
    logical         969/64/63

- looks OK, but is not (  Linux hdd's mode in bios is not LBA at this
stage ) Some people might ask, So why didn't you? The answer is, because
once: it supposed to be OK, second I didn't even look at it, then later
on I realised it wasn't in LBA,  I was afraid to touch it had many
problems using Linux and I was worried that I might cause more damage!
It supposed to be OK, according to the
"cat /proc/ide/hdb/geometry" command above.

*** At this stage LILO should work. Enter lilo at root prompt,  re-boot
but to no avail!

I took a bit of courage and changed Linuxs' hdd to LBA mode, logged in
as root and typed lilo, re-booted and now thanks to you gentlemen, your
time wasn't in vain, I thank you!

##### Sorry for this lengthy e-mail is meant for other newbies like
myself, you never know perhaps the above will eventually one day help
them to solve a LILO problem.

Best wishes,

Nick
