Thanks for your interest Adam,

Since I've first written, I have bought a brand new hub and this one worked 
first time.
I have held onto one concentrator box as it has me intrigued.

Dis-assembling it fully has revealed DS14C88 and -C89 interface chips to 
the RJ-45's
These are Quad RS-232 Line Drivers and Receivers respectively. There is 
almost a pair for each of the 16 ports.

So it aint Ethernet!  and I'm a little disappointed in the shop keepers 
assurances that this concentrator box is an Ethernet hub and that he 
himself has used it as such. I'll give him one thing tho, he did gladly 
offer to take both units back, so he keeps my custom.

Anyway, I'm over that now, and the mystery goes on...what on earth is it??
Another look at the IBM home-page has revealed concentrator boxes for ATM, 
could this be one?

No signs of Token Ring for which you listed (or any DB jacks either), 
perhaps no real surprise to you now? I'm not sure. But I appreciate your 
interest and will keep the group posted.

Dave

There are a few other hints that may tell if it is token ring or not:
- Perhaps if there is an indication anywhere that may hint to speed, either
4 or 16, instead of ethernet's 10 or 100.
- The presence of "ring in" and "ring out" ports (one on each end)
- If you're really keen, the RJ-45 jacks soldered to the mainboard will 
only
have use for pins 1,2,3,and 6 if ethernet.
- Any reference to MAU (multistation access unit) would indicate TR.
- Any db-15 jack on the box would indicate ethernet
- any 9-pin female jack would indicate either TR or an RS-232 programmable
(do not use, either way)

&gt; Subject: 	Concentrator Box
&gt;
&gt; Hi,
&gt; I have bought second hand, 2 IBM Concentrator Boxes and have been unable
&gt; to
&gt; get connectivity with my Ethernet Interface cards.
&gt; Joining the PC's together (directly) with a crossover cable works fine,
&gt; but
&gt; different configurations using the Concentrator Box hasn't worked at all.
&gt;
&gt; I was assured that these Concentrator boxes are equivalent to 10Mbs
&gt; Ethernet Hubs.
&gt; Other than the RJ-45 connectors, there is nothing to suggest that they 
are
&gt;
&gt; Ethernet, a look around IBM's home page suggests they may be Token Ring,
&gt; something I'm not familiar with.
&gt;
&gt; The units did not come with any transformers, I supplied my own, which is
&gt; a
&gt; risky business, but all looks ok inside with the regulators outputting
&gt; correct voltages. The only indicator, an amber LED, flickers briefly on
&gt; power up.
&gt;
&gt; Any advice is most welcome, model numbers are:
&gt; 	16 port Concentrator Box FRU # 91F0817
&gt; 	Suitable Transformers 53F3369, 70F9937, 70F9938, -39, -40
&gt;
&gt; I used a 24V CT (12+12) secondary winding in lieu of the IBM transformer.
&gt;
&gt; TIA
