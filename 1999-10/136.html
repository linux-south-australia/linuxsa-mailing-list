As the community grows and more new comers who do not have our
experience in unix or computers this will cause better docummentation to
be written. Some possible causes are:

1) They will eventually work out what they are doing and write the
documentation themselves
2) They will ask so many "newbie" questions that someone wakes up,
realises the current documentation is lacking and rewrites it
3) They'll hope onto a list like linuxSA and accidentally start a flame
war, the result of which is a rewritten man or HOWTO so it doesn't
happen again

Naturally there are more possible causes. The documentation is, as I
have said before, oriented towards a computer (especially unix) literate
community. More and more people are not computer literate or have only
ever experienced other operating systems. Most of the manuals in linux
are quite valuable if you understand what they are saying, however a
significant number of them presume quite a detailed knowledge of
computing, operating systems and unix.

So, remembering that there are very successful books whose title starts
"The Idiot's Guide to....", it's not really nice to bash someone over
the head for not reading any manual until a similar document exists....
