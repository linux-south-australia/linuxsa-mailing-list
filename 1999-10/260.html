Mark,

Thanks for that.

How do you get instruct the Linux kernel
to reprobe for SCSI devices after boot time?
I've looked around for this.

Actually, I've been trying to salvage this disk
for 7 years, when it ceased to work.
I'm pretty sure the disk surface is perfect, because
I ran a disk utility over it on my Atari ST.

It's quite likely that the file system is
almost identical to some MS-DOS file format.
I know that it used to have about 7 partitions
on a 105 MB disk -- because the 105 MB was too big
for the old Atari ST file system format!

This disk contains a lot of useful info.
And I had been thinking that a Linux machine would
be ideal for getting back the data.

Surely there must be some primitive at API
level which just goes and fetches bytes off the
disk for me. 
If I get desperate, I'll have to write my own
software to talk down the SCSI bus myself.
But the info isn't _that_ important.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  I don't think that re-jumpering the disks would be
the way to go.
Ideally, I'd just like to stop the boot sequence
from forcing me to have a recognized file system on
the disk before allowing the boot to proceed.
Even SunOS 4.1.3 allows this.
If I do a swap of the disks or something,
then all of the info will be wrong -- and
the OS will write all over my other disk.
