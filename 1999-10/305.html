Wayne Simes posted a message to the list this morning about CGI scripts
not working on an RH6 system.  I directed his attention to the #! line
at the beginning of each script and thought nothing more of it.

Unfortunately, though, Wayne still couldn't get the scripts working,
and he asked me to login to his system to have a look at
it for him.  I thought that what I found was interesting enough to
share it with the rest of this list, a note of warning as it were.

As it turned out, the problem was caused by a malformed #! line
at the start of each script, but in a very subtle way.  Visual 
examination of the scripts didn't uncover any problems at all,
and even the three line perl-script Wayne was using was failing; 
it said something like this:

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    print "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n";
    print "Hello\n";
    exit 0;

... which looks fair enough, so what's the problem?

It turns out it's a problem with RH's "vi" (Vim).

Wayne had installed the script on his RH box by copying it from
a Windows server.  When the script was last edited on the Windows
box, it had been saved with the Windows line termination convention,
with "CR/LF" suffixed to each line.  Every "vi" implementation I've
seen on every version of UNIX I've ever worked with would display
such a file like this:

    #!/usr/bin/perl^M
    ^M
    print "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n";^M
    print "Hello\n";^M
    exit 0;^M

... but not RH's.  Instead, it puts a small annotation on the bottom
of the screen about the fact that the file is in "dos mode", then 
presents it to the user looking like the first example above, the one
without the ^M's.  When you save the file, the "dos mode" semantics
dictate that it should write the file back with ^M's at the end of
each line, so hey presto, you end up with CR's everywhere, even though
you've had no clue on your screen to hint at their existance.

What's wrong with this picture?  Well, ^M is a legal character in a 
filename, so the script above is instructing the Linux kernel to 
look for an interpreter called /usr/bin/perl^M to run the script...
which, of course, it is doomed to never find.

So how do you work out that this has happened?  "cat -v" will display
a file with unprintable characters rendered in ^-style notation, so
it'll show the ^M's all over the place.  If you have a script that 
obviously exists but which announces "no such file or directory" when
you run it, "cat -v" might be a good place to start.

How do you fix it?  Load the file into vi and type:

     :set fileformat=unix

... then save the file again.  That'll switch the vi kludge from one
which silently inserts ^M's into a file into one which silently removes
them (is this better?  Go figure...), and will fix the problem at hand.

Ultimately, this is a vi bug.  The CR characters *are* in the file, 
and vi should bloody-well show them.  To bury a "dos mode" annunciation
away briefly at the bottom of the screen and then let you carry on 
editing what is essentially a corrupted file without giving you any
hint about the bogus data it contains (and will continue to contain,
even though visual inspection suggests otherwise) is bad behaviour.

In the meantime, calling vi with a "-b" parameter might be recommended,
because that makes it assume it's editing binary files and stops it 
from doing stupid sneaky conversions on the data it's touching.
