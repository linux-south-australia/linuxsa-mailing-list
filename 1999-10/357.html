Thanks for that, Alan, and may I be the first to say "Bugger"[1].
It didn't work, but the way in which it didn't work highlighted
the problem.  It produced exactly the same results as I was already
getting, right down to the Monitor identifier.  WTFudge?  I added
some bogus sections, and it still ran with no errors.  To cut a long
story lengthwise, I had made a backup copy of XF86Config in root's
home directory before touching anything, and this was the file the
server had decided to read (this is not mentioned in the X man pages
- it should be getting it from /etc/ or &lt;XRoot&gt;/lib/X11/).

strace(1) is your friend.  I just wish I'd only used it a few hours
earlier :-(

&gt; PS.  I run this X server confi g file in either
&gt; 8-bit or 16-bit mode.

According to the docs for 3.3.5 and NVidia, it should be capable
of running in 32-bit mode (but no 24, which is odd).  Something I
can probably cope with now that I've had a cup of Bex and a good
lie in.

Cheers,
  Daryl Tester.

[1]  Which was an understatement; if I had a budgie, I don't think it
     would recover from the trauma of what I really said.
