Hi.

Well, this might not be the most elegant solution, but i have tested it
and it works:

call this rmspace or something, chmod+x and put in your path someplace,

Then rmspace /home/MWP/problemfiledir/  and your problemfiles are no
more with spaces replaced with underscores.

-------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
cd $1
for file in *; do
  mv  "$file" `echo $file | sed 's/ /_/g'`
done 
--------------------------------------------

that ` next to echo and at the end are backquotes, up under the tilde(~)

This stuff is all in the man pages, I read them but only found the
answer by experimentation, asking others, and peeking into other shell
scripts around the system. Once you get to understand the system really
well those man pages are enormously useful, but until then they provide
hints as to where and how you might find the answers to any particular
problem. I'm still at the hints stage and glad to be of assistance when
I can.

&gt; Hi....
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that this doesnt work:
&gt; for i in `ls`; do mpg123 $i -w `echo $i | tr ".mp3" ".wav"`; done
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that the files im trying to play with here have spaces in
&gt; thier files names and "for" keeps splitting up each word in a file name into
&gt; a separate command.
&gt; Also " for i in `ls -Q`; do ........ ;done " doesnt seem to do the job
&gt; either.
&gt; 
&gt; Ive tried everything i can think of to try and work around this problem, but
&gt; have had no luck :(
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt;
