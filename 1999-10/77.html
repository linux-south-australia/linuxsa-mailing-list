&gt; Heyas
&gt; This is only partially Linux related, but I thought some people here
&gt; might have some thoughts on the matter anyway..
&gt; I have a couple of computer books I want to buy, but the couple of major
&gt; bookstores in the city that I visited last weekend quoted prices of
&gt; around $119.95 for what I wanted!
&gt; I can probably get the books slightly cheaper via the uni bookshop, but
&gt; I was wondering if anyone knew of any mailorder or websites that might
&gt; have technical books at a significantly cheaper price?
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that amazon.com could get a book in for $49.95 US - anyone
&gt; here had any experience ordering from them?
&gt; Are there any australian equivelents?

I have discussed with Woodslane (distributors for Orielly, IDG and a couple
of others) about a discount for user groups.

So if someone wants to stand up and start co-ordinating getting some
orders together (and an appropriate model so the risk is spread) we can
get something going.

Contact me for more information (and also how you would want to do it).

If people from other LUGs (I know you are on here) want to do something with
us, then by all means email me too.

Regards,

Matt
