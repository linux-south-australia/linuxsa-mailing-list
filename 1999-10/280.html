G'day,

Rod and I went to the WiredUp expo yesterday and while there was lots
of interesting stuff there, we didn't see much support for Linux, as
it was mostly Win9x and Mac O/S's, although one of the book stores
there carried a couple of Linux/Unix related O'reily books.  

Is there any possibility of seeing maybe something LinuxSA there or
even possibly Netcraft having a stall there next year?

Next.....  

Have you ever walked up to someone you *thought* you knew and have it
turn out you were mistaken?  It's so embarrassing.  &lt;sigh&gt; 

Well, I did that yesterday at the Expo, and the fellow who's shoulder
I patted is a LinuxSA member --  so......

If you were at the Expo yesterday, and are a regular attendee at
LinuxSA meetings and the dinner last February, I'm the woman in the
leather jacket that walked up and said hello yesterday. You look very
much like one of my former system admins (a friend of Mark Newton's)
and I honestly thought you were him.  If you're reading this, first of
all, please accept my apologies for causing a bit of confusion, and
could you send me Email so next time we bump into each other at a
LinuxSA meeting we'll at least know each other's names?  


Cheers,
Gaelyne
