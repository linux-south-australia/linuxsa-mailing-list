&gt; Whilst an improved installation procedure is a bonus, it seems to me that
&gt; what can be achieved AFTER the install is what really matters.  I'm a
&gt; little concerned that there is way too much emphasis applied to install
&gt; routines of late by users and the press (PC mags etc.).  I for one would
&gt; greatly welcome improvements to most of the Linux installation routines,
&gt; but would hate to think that this is indicative of a shift in mentality
&gt; from performance/practicality based thinking to an emphasis on aesthetic
&gt; issues.  The M$ way of 'getting a larger user base' is almost certainly at
&gt; work amongst the Linux community due to that old evil ... business
&gt; competition ie. Give the people what they want and what we want them to
&gt; want...not what is actually best.  ~shrug~

It really comes down to what you want out of it.  Due to the very nature of
Linux and Open Source Software, it doesn't matter what the shrink wrap
container has on it, you still get the same software.  No distribution can
say 'I have apache and they don't'.  I won't start getting into commercial
or pseudo-free software, but almost all the software I use is Free and so
it doesn't matter to me about some of the other software.

Distributions can only differentiate between themselves in a small number of
ways.  It comes down to bundled non-free software, installation procedure,
configuration tools and bundled support.  

According to non-hacker types these of course are what are important to them
the turn-key solution that they want.  To hacker types it doesn't make much
of a difference at all.  I know that myself and a lot of people aren't afraid
of a good ./configure;make;make install.  The Open Source Community is working
on other areas such as consistency in configuration and file location and all.

The transparency of the the entire systems means if you don't want to you
don't have to worry about the 'value-added' versions of the distributions
and just go for a GPLed or freely distributable versions.

Remember that in reality the Open Source Community is really in it's true
infancy, we are no longer embryonic, but we have a long way to go and we
are going have some fun getting there.

But anyway enough of my rants..  If people want to continue this discussion
feel free to join #linuxsa on irc.linux.org.au.  I will be on and off through
out the day as 'Meep'.

Regards,

Matt
