Others have suggested caller-id, which can only hurt by as much as Telstra
hose you for that feature (it's not free.)  There is no guarantee that CID
will be presented, and you only need to dial a prefix to the number you
want to ensure that no CID is displayed; never the less it's not expensive
and you might just as well pay for that service.  I understand it costs
only a few dollars per month (and maybe you need to buy new modems,
obviously I don't know about that.)

Finding out where they are calling from and who they are trying to log in
as is largely a matter of checking your configuration and your log files.
To record the CID you need to know what program you use to answer the call.
(I assume you already paying to have CID presented to your line, and that
your modem is capable of decoding this information.)  Many people prefer
mgetty, which I'm not familiar with.  (I use getty_ps which I find much
more simple.)  Assuming mgetty is more-or-less similar to getty_ps in this
regard, you need to add init strings to make your modem display CID, and
you need to adjust the configuration file so that CID is recorded
somewhere.  I hear that mgetty already knows about this, so it should be
easy.  Remember to read *your* modem manual (pointed stare) to find out the
init string applicable to your modem.

There are (at least) two parts to answering how to find out who they are
trying to log in as.  Mgetty has an AutoPPP option, which makes it
recognise PPP frames and automatically invoke pppd.  (Getty_ps + my patch
has the same feature.) If they are trying to log on using a PPP
authentication then read up about whatever pppd uses to record invalid log
in attempts.  If you use a PAM enabled unix, and on this list that's highly
likely, and if you have pppd setup to use "unix login authentication" then
useful information will be logged using syslogd.  Authentication failure
from PAM looks somewhat like:

   "authentication failure; (uid=0) -&gt; joeuser for ppp service"

This indicates that they tried to log in as joeuser.  Mind you pppd can
also use it's own secrets or chap-secrets file, and not use PAM.

If they are not sending PPP frames, whatever getty you use will ask them
for a username and then exec /bin/login, which will ask for a password and
authenticate them.  The comments about PAM apply here, too.  Login does not
have to use PAM and maybe you have one which doesn't, but it will surely
log using syslog either way.

You need to find out what syslog messages to keep, and the answer to that
can be gleaned from manual pages for getty, login, pppd and pam.  Don't
forget to read syslogd man page, too.  Finally, a word of advise that is
always timely -- no, not RTFM, it's UTSL.  Use the source, Luke.
