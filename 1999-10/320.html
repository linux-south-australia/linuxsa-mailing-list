G'day,

Hats off to Geoffrey for the PHP3 presentation tonight.  As I was just 
looking up some info online I thought I'd share my two favourite
places to get info about PHP3:


PHP Knowledge Base
<A HREF="http://www.e-gineer.com/e-gineer/phpkb/">http://www.e-gineer.com/e-gineer/phpkb/</A>

This site has a mailing list for PHP developers, and the knowledge base 
is based on questions that have been asked/answered on the mailing
list. 


PHP Manual 
<A HREF="http://www.php.net/manual/">http://www.php.net/manual/</A>

This manual is a little nicer than my local version - it's two best
points are a side-bar to show you other topics in the section, and it
has comments that have been added by other people... sort of like being
able to have a manual that someone's scribbled cool notes in -- but
much tidier. &lt;g&gt; 


A comment on my question about server side includes vs PHP includes:

I've found there's at least one subtle difference between how PHP
parses the path used for a file that's to be included within a web
page, and this is where I've found the most frustration.

For instance, within my Apache conf file, I have a directory,
"/path-to-httpd-stuff/global/" that's set as an alias: ("/global/"). 

This is similar to how the /cgi-bin/ directory is aliased in Apache.

The /global/ directory allows me to have files that are available to
all web pages anywhere on the server - from any of the hosts. This is
extremely useful for adding footers and such - and could be equally
wonderful with PHP for common.inc type files. 

Unfortunately, PHP doesn't seem to "know" about the /global/ alias. Is
there a way to set the directory as a variable in PHP so I could have
the same functionality?


Cheers,
Gaelyne
