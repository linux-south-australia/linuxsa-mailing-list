1. ========== FROM THE EDITOR ==========

Hello all,

As I mentioned last week, Microsoft's Linux Myths Web site
(<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/msnw/LinuxMyths.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/news/msnw/LinuxMyths.asp</A>) tries
hard to please. Right off the bat, Microsoft tells us that Linux
"cannot deliver on the hype" because it "relies on 30-year-old OS
technology and architecture [UNIX]" that is "not designed to support
symmetrical multiprocessing, graphical user interfaces, asynchronous
I/O, fine-grained security," and other features we've come to expect in
modern OSs. In other words, it's not Windows NT.
   Well, duh. Some statements are simply incorrect, but the most
debatable part of this diatribe concerns Microsoft's comments about the
age of Linux/UNIX. UNIX has been implementing TCP/IP, the native
protocol suite of the Internet, for decades. As such, it's been battle-
tested in ways that you can't reproduce in test environments or in the
limited amount of time that NT has been generally available. There's no
contest. But Microsoft's comments about the age of Linux are curious
because this OS has been in existence for less than a decade, and in
widespread use for only a year or so. Linux is not UNIX; it simply
looks, feels, and acts like UNIX. Linux is far too young and untested
to be used in crucial networking environments. On that note, NT
suddenly looks like the battle-scarred veteran. So, although I disagree
with Microsoft's comments regarding the age of UNIX, I don't feel that
the comments apply to Linux. It seems curious that Microsoft would
confuse experience with dotage.
   Let's take a look at the so-called myths Microsoft writes about
Linux on this site, and examine them one at a time. The first myth,
"Linux performs better than Windows NT," is torn down with a list of
third-party tests that seem to show that NT outperforms Linux in
various capacities, such as when you use NT as a file, print, or Web
server. Ignoring for a moment that other tests show opposite results,
most of the Linux advocates I've talked to claim that Linux runs more
efficiently on less hardware. In other words, you can break out an old
Pentium with minimal RAM and run Linux in an environment that NT would
choke on. I've witnessed this first hand, so there's some truth to the
statement. However, it's likewise true that NT scales more efficiently
than Linux and outperforms Linux on modern (especially SMP-based)
hardware. Furthermore, I'd argue that outright performance is moot
(witness the demise of Compaq's Alpha, whose performance gains over
Intel couldn't save it from an untimely death on NT). Most enterprises
are looking for total solutions, not whether an OS can outperform
another OS on a seemingly relevant benchmark.
   As an NT fan, the second myth, "Linux is more reliable than Windows
NT" is harder for me to contradict. Like most of you, I've administered
NT 4.0 in a production environment. I've seen servers that needed to be
rebooted on a regular basis and servers that were rendered unbootable
because of software installations. I've had to fly cross-country to
repair fallen NT servers in collocation facilities. And, like many of
you, I've heard the stories about years of continuous uptime for Linux
boxes, though I suspect that most of the boxes aren't found in heavy-
usage scenarios. My thoughts on this are a bit more clouded, but I will
say this: Microsoft is fixing the biggest NT reliability concerns in
Windows 2000 (Win2K). Fewer reboots, system file checking, and other
reliability and uptime concerns will take Win2K closer to the 24/7/356
goals we all have. However, NT is not at that stage today and, I
suspect, neither is Linux. The reliability debate is probably one for
the ages.
   Next week, I'll look at the final three points Microsoft makes on
this Web site. It's important for any NT user to understand the Linux
threat. Even if you fully intend to use and administer NT for the rest
of your professional career, it's likely that Linux will affect you in
some way, somewhere down the line. As Windows users, you might find it
easy to ignore the competition, which so often represents no
competition at all (OS/2, MacOS). Let's not make the same mistake with
Linux. Only through understanding Linux can we hope to ensure that NT
remains ahead of this challenger.

2. ========== HOT OFF THE PRESS ==========
(contributed by Paul Thurrott, <A HREF="mailto:updatenews@winntmag.com">updatenews@winntmag.com</A>)

* MICROSOFT TESTING WINDOWS UPDATE FOR CORPORATIONS
Microsoft is testing a new version of its Windows Update Web site that
will let corporations keep their computers up-to-date with the latest
OS updates. Dubbed Windows Update Corporate, the new site will support
a variety of Microsoft OSs and related products, including Windows 2000
(Win2K), Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 (Alpha and Intel), and
Internet Explorer (IE) 5.0.
   Windows Update Corporate is notable in that it brings legacy OSs
such as Win95 and NT 4.0 into the automatic update realm that Win98 and
Win2K users enjoy. Users will be able to search the site by OS,
component type (e.g., audio, display driver), and manufacturer. This
search capability provides a powerful range of functionality. Extensive
filtering and sorting of search results makes using this site more
intuitive.
   An integrated product catalog will offer an extensive set of
Microsoft logo device drivers and updates to Microsoft Windows and
related software components. Users can download items from the catalog,
save them to any location on a network, and test and validate these
components before distributing them to users.
   Microsoft Windows Update Corporate is currently in beta. Microsoft
expects to publicly release the site concurrently with Win2K.

* MICROSOFT BLOWS PAST EARNINGS ESTIMATES
Microsoft announced net income of $2.19 billion on revenues of $5.38
billion for the quarter ending September 30, a healthy 37 percent
increase over the same quarter a year before, when the company made
$4.19 billion. The company attributed the gains to strong demand for
personal computers. In fact, this is the first quarter in recent memory
where the software giant didn't warn investors of possible future
problems.
   "We had a really big quarter driven by strong corporate demand for
Office 2000, Windows NT Server, and BackOffice applications," said Greg
Maffei, Microsoft CFO. "It does not appear that Y2K had a significant
impact on results. During the quarter, we also saw excellent PC unit
growth, particularly in Asia, and we expect that trend to continue in
the December quarter."
   Microsoft released Windows 2000 (Win2K) Release Candidate 2 (RC2) to
750,000 testers during the quarter and expects to release the product
to manufacturing by the end of 1999. In fact, Microsoft's mention of a
late 1999 RTM date is interesting, giving all the speculation in the
press that Win2K has somehow been delayed.
   The most incredible news about Microsoft's quarterly results wasn't
in the numbers, but in the mood of Greg Maffei, who has historically
had little good to say about upcoming quarters. Although typically
reserved, Maffei was almost exuberant in a conference call with
reporters.
   "There might be a little upside to next quarter above the current
estimates," Maffei said. "[Year 2000 is] something that's manageable
and not something that's going to have a dramatic impact on our
business." One-time gains for the company, which were not factored into
the year-to-year growth estimates include the sale of Sidewalk ($156
million) and SoftImage ($160 million).

* BLINK! MICROSOFT DUMPS THEN REINSTATES MVP PROGRAM
It was a bizarre weekend for those people most loyal to Microsoft. Late
last week, the company informed its faithful Most Valuable Professional
(MVP) members that their years of hard work defending the company and
providing free technical support were all for nothing when it suddenly
canceled the MVP program. Microsoft originally designed the MVP program
to reward people who were providing free peer-to-peer technical support
for Microsoft products in Internet newsgroups. However, like similar
groups such as Team OS/2, customers had complained about the quality of
this support and the unprofessional nature of a few MVPs. In a letter
to MVP members, Microsoft's Joseph Lindstrom said that the company was
eliminating the MVP program due to customer feedback--Microsoft's
customers want support from Microsoft.
   MVP members, who receive rewards of approximately $1000 worth of
free Microsoft products and a gift of Microsoft-branded merchandise
every year, universally panned the decision. The problem is that this
reward system began attracting a younger crowd, which isn't necessarily
the group of professionals Microsoft customers were looking for. To
label all MVP members as unprofessional or unqualified is, of course,
unfair and untrue. The vast majority of these people dedicate hours
every week helping Microsoft's customers.
   "The letter is about the rudest one we could have expected," says
MVP member Thomas Lee. "I've been supporting the public newsgroups for
several years. To suggest that I am not a professional is beyond
comment. Yes, we got some goodies. But I did it for the love of the
product, not for the money."
   Fortunately for MVP members, the company abruptly reversed its
decision Monday night after receiving thousands of complaints from
customers and upset MVP members. Microsoft alerted MVPs of the
turnaround in an email message that the company circulated late Monday.
   "Our objectives have always been to provide the best technical
support in the industry, and a part of that support is the activity
taking place in the newsgroups today," the letter reads. "MVPs make a
significant contribution to our customer satisfaction, and we sincerely
appreciate their efforts. Based on feedback, we will reinstate the MVP
Program effective immediately."
   Needless to say, virtual cheers from the MVP community greeted the
decision. Indeed, if this rapid turnaround proves anything, it's that
an online grass roots movement for common sense can still prevail in a
world dominated by huge corporations.
   "Today, Microsoft made a good decision," MVP Thomas Lee told me
Monday night. "And it will ultimately benefit the customer. The power
of the Internet to influence a big corporation to reconsider something
was again demonstrated today in a big way. This is a good day to be
alive."

* WINDOWS 2000 HARDWARE COMPATIBIITY LIST
I'm getting ready to buy a system to test Windows 2000 (Win2K) Release
Candidate 2 (RC2). I've been burned repeatedly by hardware
incompatibilities over the years, and I now know to research drivers
before I buy. I started by reading several Win2K forums dealing with
installation problems, the most common of which were problems with
video and serial devices and numerous system hangs after the Win2K
installation completed. This information reinforced the importance of
selecting the right components from the start, a scenario strongly
reminiscent of the early days of Windows NT.
   Next, I looked at the Knowledge Base, which now searches for Win2K-
specific problems. Several of the Win2K articles referred me to
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/hcl">http://www.microsoft.com/hcl</A>, so I stopped by this page to research
Win2K drivers for video, audio, and network adapter card components.
Much to my dismay, I couldn't find a Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)
specifically for Win2K. Instead, I had to dig through pages and pages
only to find a few video adapters that had a red check mark in the
Windows 2000 column, but not the official approved logo. In spite of my
desire to build a good system, I don't have the patience to browse
hundreds of pages and components supported by all of Microsoft's
platforms.
   I finally got lucky when I searched the Win2K RC2 CD-ROMs that
showed up last week. Although I didn't check every CD-ROM, I did find a
file called hcl.txt in the Support directory. When I opened the file,
which was dated September 10, 1999, I found 25 pages of components and
systems. While not ideal, it's a start.
   After preparing this story, I learned that Microsoft provides a
Win2K HCL text file on its FTP site at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/services/whql/win2000hcl.txt.">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/services/whql/win2000hcl.txt.</A> Fortunately,
Windows NT Magazine publishes this list in a form that's searchable by
manufacturer name, product name, and product category. You can visit
the Windows 2000 Compatibility Database at
<A HREF="http://www.winntmag.com/techware/HCL/index.cfm.">http://www.winntmag.com/techware/HCL/index.cfm.</A>

* WINDOWS 2000 KNOWLEDGE BASE
The Microsoft TechNet Search page at
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/support/searchkb.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/support/searchkb.htm</A> now searches for
Windows 2000-(Win2K) specific information. Unlike the Windows NT 4.0
Knowledge Base, the Win2K version isn't available for public download
from Microsoft's FTP site, which means we have to rely solely on the
capabilities of the search engine to locate information. Relying on the
search engine frequently translates into conducting multiple queries,
chasing links to information we don't need, and enduring hours of
fruitless digging. To avoid wasted hours, I'd like to see Microsoft
publish the Win2K Knowledge Base at its public FTP site, and I'd like
to hear your opinion on this subject.

* REPAIRING DESKTOP ICONS
Last week, a strange bug added an Eject PC icon to the Start menu on my
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) server, and I stared at this icon
for quite a while before I figured out that it didn't belong there (it
was a late-night session). The Eject PC icon disappeared after I logged
off and back on again, and it never returned. Someone mentioned that
this icon might appear with a docked notebook, but I've never seen it
before--and besides, we're talking about my dual-processor SCSI server.
   I researched this behavior at two common virus sites and came up
empty handed, and a scan with two different virus utilities failed to
turn up a culprit. So, I concluded that an NT bug, not a virus, caused
the problem. After this strange new icon disappeared, I found the
Microsoft flying flag icon overlaying all my desktop icons (although I
could see the correct icons underneath the flying flags), and all
attempts to change the icons back to normal failed. In addition, in the
Windows Explorer view of my local drive, a PowerPoint 2000 icon
replaced the normal folder icon for the C drive and two directories,
one of which was the system root.
   It turns out that a hidden file in the system root called
ShellIconCache holds a copy of desktop icons. When the cache is
corrupt, desktop icons look strange for all users who log on to the
problem system. Although I'm not sure what happened, it appears that
this bug corrupted the icon cache or corrupted the component that adds
icons to the cache file. After I deleted C:\winnt\ShellIconCache, my
desktop returned to normal. (You can safely delete the ShellIconCache
file because NT automatically recreates the file after you log off and
back on again.) But there's still one holdover from this unidentified
culprit--each time I log off, NT scans both the CD-ROM and the diskette
drives. If you've seen this Eject PC icon somewhere, I'm all ears.

* VERITAS BACKUPEXEC UPDATE
A couple of weeks ago, I discussed a bug in Seagate Backup Exec 7.19.
It turns out that Seagate and VERITAS merged in June of this year and
renamed the product VERITAS Backup Exec for Windows NT. VERITAS
contacted us with some new information about its backup software. The
problem I reported from the Microsoft Knowledge Base is specific to the
March 1998 version of Backup Exec (version 7, build 719), and,
according to VERITAS, the company corrected the problem in build 719.2,
which shipped in April 1998. You shouldn't see the Messenger service
problem unless you're running an older version of Backup Exec.

Modem Won't Work in Win2K

I can sign on to an ISP but I can't fully connect. When the ISP tries
to send the password, or right after, the modem doesn't work. Is there
any way I can use my Windows 98 drivers for my modem, or is there an
option I need to check to go online?

* TIP: REGISTER AND UNREGISTER DLLS
(contributed by Charles Comer, <A HREF="mailto:Charles.Comer@thehartford.com">Charles.Comer@thehartford.com</A>)

As a Windows NT Administrator using Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS)
within a 3-tier architecture connecting to Oracle databases, I often
need to register and unregister DLLs. To quicken this procedure I use a
couple of bat files.

"Reg.bat"
:begin
if '%1'=='' go to end
regsvr32 %1
shift
go to begin
:end

"Unreg.bat"
:begin
if '%1'=='' go to end
regsvr32 /u %1
shift
go to begin
:end

I then copy these two scripts to my "Send To" folder (subfolder of
Profiles). All I have to do is right-click a DLL, select Send To, then
select either reg.bat to register or unreg.bat to unregister.

* SHAREWARE: WEBRECORDER
(contributed by Jonathan Chau, <A HREF="mailto:jjc@winntmag.com">jjc@winntmag.com</A>)

Despite today's browsers' high ease-of-use level, most Web browsers
just aren't capable of some of the more advanced features you might
demand from them. To that end, WebRecorder is a companion utility for
your Web browser that adds functions that are otherwise unavailable by
default. With WebRecorder installed, you can schedule batch downloads,
mirror an entire Web site, and resume aborted file transfers. This
product is great for heavy Web surfers.
