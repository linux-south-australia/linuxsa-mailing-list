<H1>luck with scanners, anyone?</H1>

Has anyone had any luck with scanners with linux?

After 11 months of trying to get any scanner going
with linux, I'm very close to going back to wind95.
I've wasted an awesome amount of time and energy on this.

Scanner 3
---------
In particular, has anyone managed to get this scanner going:

Umax Astra 1220S
----------------

This is the latest scanner I've tried.
It comes with an el kludgo 25-pin pseudo-SCSI interface,
instead of the standard SCSI which I had expected.
It also has an el kludgo ISA card with a 25-pin pseudo-SCSI
interface, and a 25 to 25 pin cable.

I can't even get "pnpdump" to recognize the existence of the
ISA card, let alone get the SCSI functionality up or
get "scanimage" running. 

I thought that since this scanner is mentioned in both

<A HREF="http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-backends.html">http://www.mostang.com/sane/sane-backends.html</A>

and

<A HREF="http://cdb.suse.de/cgi-bin/scdb?ID">http://cdb.suse.de/cgi-bin/scdb?ID</A>=94041825691&HTML=ENGLISH%2Fcdb_listtemplates%2Fshow_a.htm&INDEX=7368

then it should be a safe bet. Obviously not.

Scanner 2
---------
Previously I tried this:

Epson Perfection 1200S
----------------------

This had at least a standard SCSI-II 50-pin interface,
but came with some card (PCI, I think) with a 25-pin
el kludgo plug.
I didn't even try to get the card going.
I just bought a SCSI-II to SCSI-II cable for it, and
plugged it into a Tekram SCSI card, and found that
at least it did show up as a SCSI device.

But then I ran the SANE "scanimage" program and found
that the scanner "hung". I.e. the scanner just showed a red
light and "scanimage --listdevices" gave up and gave no helpful
message at all.

Scanner 1
---------
The scanner before this was the:

Dexxa 4800 (probably really an Artec AS6E).
----------

I tried the Artec AS6E software on this parallel port device, and
it gave up after a while with a core dump. "gdb" showed that
it had a divide-by-zero error.
I contacted the author about this, but he was not working
on this software any more.

====================================
Thanks in advance for any useful info.
If I can't work out how to get a serious scanner going 
under linux, I'm going to have to unwrap the bundled
el kludgo software that came with the Umax scanner for wind95.
I think that ability to support peripheral devices is the
really major thing which linux is terrible at.
Every additional peripheral device causes me really
major stress with linux.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

================================
PS. About the previous enquiry about using linux to
fix up my old Atari ST SCSI drive, yes, everyone who
suggested that putting a linxu-file-system SCSI drive
at /dev/sda to keep the OS happy was right.
If the first SCSI device has a good FS, then the OS doesn't care
what the rest have, even though the first SCSI device
may not even be mentioned in /etc/fstab.
But now the old SCSI disk (with also an old ACSI interface)
seems to have no data on it. I'm pretty sure the
data _is_ there. Looks like to solve this problem, I'm going to
have to write SCSI software in old C on the Atari.
I had been hoping that linux SCSI software was going to help
me here.
