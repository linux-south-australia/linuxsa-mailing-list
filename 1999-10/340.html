I'm running X windows (a 3.3.1 or 3.3.2 from memory) at home on a riva
tnt2, with all the GLX/Mesa3D/etc addons as well, works fine.
Which server you using? I'm using the staticly compiled one I downloaded
from nvidia.com that you replace SVGA with, since my elderly Xfree
install didn't support the tnt2 at all natively. (I believe the more
recent versions do, however, I thought I'd go with the one from the
manufacturer at first, until xfree86 4.0 comes out.)

Maybe give that one a go?
If you want I can email you my XF86Config when I get home.

&gt; Sigh.  X.  When it works, it's great.  When it doesn't ...
&gt; 
&gt; Just installed my brand new shiny RedHat 6.1 CD on my brand new
&gt; shiny computer.  After solving the saga of the unbootable SCSI
&gt; CD-ROM (what do you mean, you need a real floppy for that to work
&gt; - damn stupid BIOS), I got stuck into configurin' X (3.3.5) on a
&gt; RIVA TNT2 (BTW, the new install process for 6.1 is rather slick,
&gt; and GUIs don't normally impress me.  But I digress ...).  The
&gt; video card is supported, but the best (in fact, only) mode I can
&gt; get out of both Xconfigurator and xf86setup is 640x480.  Whee.
&gt; (and no, Alt-Shift-&lt;+,-&gt; doesn't cycle through the modes, because
&gt; there are no other modes).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the output of startx, I can see that most, if not all bar
&gt; one, of my modes are getting deleted because they supposedly
&gt; fall outside of the hsync and vsync range of my monitor.  Yet
&gt; in the monitor section, I have HorizSync and VertRefresh rates
&gt; than do cover these ranges, so I'm at a loss as to why these
&gt; modes are being deleted.  Please, someone, give me a clue.  I'm
&gt; all clued out ... :-(
&gt;
