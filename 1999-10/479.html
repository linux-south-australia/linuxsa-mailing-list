Jake,

I've just checked out the ~rtlinux site (again),
to find out what the relation between RT-Linux
and standard linux is. But I could not find out
the relation between them, except in a static sense.

Question:

Is RT-Linux a distinct fork from standard linux
which has gone its won way?

Or is there some way in which standard linux
and RT-linux are continually synchronized?

If it's the latter, then RT-linux would be much more
attractive, and there would be no really good
reason why it shouldn't be part of the
standard linux code.

The most interesting technical point in the
RT-Linux site was the comment that on a 33 MHz
intel CPU, the latency is about 30 uS,
a mere 1000 cycles or so!

By the way, I once worked on a real-time
project that essentially failed to reach its
objective because the latency of response
to hardware interrupts by the philips XA chip was
10 times what it should have been.
It turned out that the monitor software was looking
up tables to hand interrupts to.

To get really fast response, one really has to
have direct control over interrupt vector tables.
Obviously even RT-Linux does not let you do that.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
