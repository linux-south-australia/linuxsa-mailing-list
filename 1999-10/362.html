&gt; I got stuck into configurin' X (3.3.5) on a RIVA
&gt; TNT2.  The video card is supported, but the best
&gt; (in fact, only) mode I can get out of both
&gt; Xconfigurator and xf86setup is 640x480.
		       ^^
		do you mean XF86Setup
		or xf86config?	

I have had this problem with SuSE 6.2 and Red Hat 6.1.
Both of these ship with XFree86 3.3.5. I had a working
installation with 3.3.4 on my Voodoo Banshee, so I
figured it must be possible also to configure my card
under 3.3.5.

Red Hat's install actually probed my video card, and
suggested 1280x1024x32.  This resulted in only a black
screen when attempting to start X, so I set it up at
640x480x8, so that I could get a working X server, and
then started to experiment.

Since I had no joy with the Red Hat configuration 
during installation (which I believe uses
Xconfigurator) obtaining my desired 1024x768, I tried
the two other configuration utilities which ship with
Red Hat 6.1, namely XF86Setup and xf86config.
Unfortunately I can not remember which of these
worked, but nevertheless, one of them did.

Try all of
*Xconfigurator
*XF86Setup
*xf86config

one of them is almost certain to work.

While this does not explain why you are experiencing
these problems, hopefully this will help give you a
working X server.

Hope this helps.
