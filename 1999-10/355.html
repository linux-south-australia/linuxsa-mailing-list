&gt; I (IMHO) can't see why people store large amounts of text data
&gt; (or binary data, for that matter - what was that pointless map web
&gt; site that Microsoft used to go on about?) in relational databases
&gt; in the first place.  I still have enough faith in Postgres that
&gt; I will leave my home/business accounting system (such as it is)
&gt; based on it, and enough faith in systems in general to do regular
&gt; backups.

The reason that you could / would store large things in the database
is that it may be just an efficient file system as your regular file 
system. If you all your data is stored in the Database backups &lt;can&gt;
become much easier. ie you do 1 nightly backup of your database as it 
will hold ANY data that has changed.

The ext2 file system that we all run on our linux boxes isn't too 
different to a relational DB when you think about it.

Although my opinion may have changed the fact that I am right has not.
