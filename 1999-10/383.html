&gt; I would be interested to hear what they were saying to bag Apache  - perhaps
&gt; it is the circles I move in, but i haven't heard anyone bag Apache before..

Perhaps you haven't been to an MS event before.  I was sent to
Tech Ed '97, and during a demonstration of IIS (3.0, I think at
the time) saw the presenter export the entire C:\ drive and say
"Let's call this Unix".  I had to refrain myself from calling out
"Let's ping it, watch it blue screen and call it NT"  (it was
pretty recent after the Ping of Death).  There were several other
swipes at Unix, but that was the most prominent that I remember.
It wasn't until then that I actually began to despise them.

FUD - it's Microsoft's #1 marketing technique.

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
