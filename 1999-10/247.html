&gt; &gt; Im sure many people run gigabit ethernet around their organisations, but as
&gt; &gt; an internet connection the Kidman Park building has 410MBits made up of a
&gt; &gt; combination of Telstra and Optus links.  I don't have very extensive
&gt; &gt; knowledge, but its the most connected place I've ever been to.

&gt; 
&gt; I was there a while back, and I can't quite remember what they said, but I
&gt; reckon that they have a couple of 155mbps connections to each of telstra and
&gt; optus, with some other stuff as well for backups.
&gt; They also have multiple power lines from different power stations, a monster
&gt; generator with about a month's worth of fuel, and two different water supply
&gt; lines.
&gt; Sounds like a pretty secure place to me! (And the room with the servers in it
&gt; is only half full - plenty of room for expansion I guess!)
&gt; Cya,
&gt; Sam.

Yep, that 'warehouse' of theirs is pretty impressive! Have you seen the
size of those Storagetek tape silos in there?

The guys who monitor and administer the place are almost chained to
those consoles :) When they're on call, they must live within a certain
radius of the Kidman Park complex in order to guarantee a minimum
reponse time - and they can't drink for the duration of their stint (~2
weeks I think), cos' they may be called out at *any* time!

Oh, and the guy who manages them (Mark Ferrareto) is a bit of a linux
evangelist too :)

Cheers,
