I have to agree with you totally too, Don! It is the end result
stability along with flexability and security that is wanted. So it is
slick as a greased pig to install, but nothing works properly (Am I
suggesting Microsoft? hmmm) doesn't make it... In most cases the
average person isn't going to use Linux. As it stands now, Linux has
come a long way since version .95 install! I think stability has
gotten to the point where Linux is a very viable product. With more
support from the commercial world M$ has a BIG scrapper in the oppsite
corner.

The only thing that is wrong is now Linux is getting extremely
commercialized. RedHat has done a good thing to make it easier for the
savy 'GEEK' to have a system up and configured is no time. The thing
that does both me is the pricing. It seems to me to be growing into
the Windows market pricing. If this keeps up where is the limit? The
price of NT??

Sometimes there is only so much that can be done to a program to make
it work the way it was intended. This is to say that I have NO
derogatory feelings toward Linux! Security is my main concern!!! Linux
is filling the bill here!

I love the ability to put a server in and office and have it do
everything that is needed AND stay working for a long period of time!
I haven't seen an NT server do this as of yet!!! One *NIX person can
control and service many many Linux machines, while it normally takes
one person to service no more than 2 NT machines. To me this is
negitive productivity and quite positive for a complete Linux
network...

I guess when I compair Linux pricing to Windows 9x pricing I am doing
an apples to oranges comparison and this should not be done. I should
do this to NT, which is still not the same in actuality. Compairing a
big ole Granny Smith apple that is sweet and juicy to a little bitter
crabapple still isn't the same even though they are both apples or
both servers...

Now that I have gotten up on soap box and spewed forth my bubbles of
ranting with the raving, I should step down. This is MY oppinion and
only MY oppinion.

Is there any takers that want to discuss this?

&gt; Hi Richard et. al.,
&gt; Whilst an improved installation procedure is a bonus, it seems to me that
&gt; what can be achieved AFTER the install is what really matters.  I'm a
&gt; little concerned that there is way too much emphasis applied to install
&gt; routines of late by users and the press (PC mags etc.).  I for one would
&gt; greatly welcome improvements to most of the Linux installation routines,
&gt; but would hate to think that this is indicative of a shift in mentality
&gt; from performance/practicality based thinking to an emphasis on aesthetic
&gt; issues.  The M$ way of 'getting a larger user base' is almost certainly at
&gt; work amongst the Linux community due to that old evil ... business
&gt; competition ie. Give the people what they want and what we want them to
&gt; want...not what is actually best.  ~shrug~
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone else got the same concerns?
&gt; Don.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have just installed Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 off of the Linux PocketBook
&gt; CD,
&gt; &gt; and apart from it hanging on one of my machines, it is very impressive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Even lets you play Tetris during the install process while the rest of it
&gt; &gt; goes on in the background.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Much better installation process than that clunky Windows install
&gt; process.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Even lets you try out X setups etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course, the Samba setup is very different :-(
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
