At risk of starting a flame war,
Can I suggest that you might also prefer if the entire human race
consisted of:
1 gender
1 language
1 colour of skin
1 colour of hair
1 colour of eyes
1 standard size, height and weight.
1 standard lifespan
A rigidly defined and conformed to life-plan, occupation, marriage, etc.
etc etc etc




Diversity is the key to continued existence. See Darwin.
Plus, it's a whole lot more fun ;)

call the thread finished.)

&gt; =====================================================
&gt; &gt; You seem to be very much against PostgresSQL.
&gt; &gt; Have you tried it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would be interested in hearing your experiences.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Justin.
&gt; =====================================================
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I have tried PostgreSQL.
&gt; And that's why I'm against it.
&gt; I couldn't find any documentation of the "Oid" enumerator
&gt; in the C API, and that meant that I couldn't work out
&gt; what I was being sent in native format.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, I'm against just about all software in linux, and
&gt; in all other operating systems that I have tried.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that we are in a medieval age of the computer.
&gt; People in 50 years will gasp when they learn in school what
&gt; primitive conditions we worked under, what chaos reigned,
&gt; what wilful cussedness, etc. etc.
&gt; What kind of mentality can be happy with computers which have
&gt; 
&gt; 5 kinds of SCSI connector
&gt; 30 different linux distributions
&gt; 4 kinds of mainboard slot
&gt; 50 kinds of CPU
&gt; 10 kinds of disk interface
&gt; 500 kinds of monitor
&gt; 50 kinds of mainboard
&gt; 100 kinds of ethernet card
&gt; 20 linux window managers
&gt; 20 file systems
&gt; 200 kinds of graphics card
&gt; 100 kinds of webcam camera
&gt; 50 kinds of printers
&gt; 100 kinds of scanners
&gt; 40 programming languages
&gt; 20 document formats
&gt; 20 web server/client protocols
&gt; 20 kinds of LAN
&gt; 20 kinds of connection to the Internet
&gt; 30 kinds of text editor
&gt; 20 kinds of database
&gt; 500 kinds of microcontroller
&gt; 20 kinds of RAM
&gt; 20 kinds of cache
&gt; 20 kinds of software licence
&gt; 100 kinds of keyboard
&gt; 50 kinds of mouse
&gt; 50 kinds of e-mail client
&gt; 
&gt; ...and so forth and so forth...
&gt; 
&gt; No wonder Macs are so popular.
&gt; No options. No stress.
&gt; No wonder the East Germans want to go back to communism.
&gt; (Computing teachers used to plead with the authorities to send
&gt; them photos of computers so that the students would know
&gt; what they looked like.)
&gt; 
&gt; So really, no, I'm not very much against PostgreSQL.
&gt; Not relative to the rest of the IT mess.
&gt; 
&gt; PostgreSQL just needs a hexadecimal floating point
&gt; transfer syntax, and that would fix up my main problems.
&gt; E.g. 0x8x-1 would mean hexadecimal 8 times 16^(-1).
&gt; 
&gt; When I went to the MySQL site, I got 2.1 kilograms of
&gt; documentation which all looks neat.
&gt; The PostgreSQL documentation all seemed incomplete
&gt; and was full of comments like "Would someone like to
&gt; write this section?" in about half of the sections.
&gt; 
&gt; But if we discuss which of the above things is best in
&gt; its category, all of them would be superseded by the time
&gt; the conversation is over.
&gt; 
&gt; In 50 years, I predict that there will be only
&gt; 
&gt; one operating system
&gt; one programming langauge
&gt; one text editor
&gt; one kind of SCSI connector !!!
&gt; one kind of database !
&gt; 
&gt; and so forth.
&gt; Standards make your life comprehensible -- if only
&gt; there weren't so many!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheerio,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; ========================================================
&gt; PS. The file
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/postgres.html">http://www.topology.org/postgres.html</A>
&gt; documents my first experiences with PostgreSQL.
&gt; I gave up on it in July 1999, when I realised that I had
&gt; to read the source to find out how to use it.
&gt; 
&gt; PPS. If you want to hear any more about my experiences, I can tell
&gt; you what's wrong with everything else in the world too, if you like.
&gt; Things were much better in the antediluvian...
