No it hasn't, it's a nice place to read and be informed, but I was just
covering my butt. Somethings are easily misconstrued..

Ahh well, that's just me....

Have fun all..

&gt;
&gt; ;-) has LinuxSA really turned into such a mine field?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I ALWAYS worrying about accidently stuffing up. This is called human
nature.
&gt; &gt; If you do not worry, then you are over confident. Over confident people
&gt; &gt; don't screw up often, but when they do, God help them, cause no-one else
&gt; &gt; will.
&gt;
&gt; True.  I think some of the feeling expressed in posts about aliases
&gt; like alias rm='rm -i' is really a reflection of how poor an insurance
&gt; policy they are.  In the Windows example, the point was that the
&gt; rotten thing asks the question over and over in a totally predictable
&gt; way.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that given a _very_ predictable challenge the
&gt; temptation is to preempt it, i.e., type the command, hit enter, and
&gt; then immediately hit 'y'.  I know that I have stuffed up while such a
&gt; scheme has been in place, and probably even mistakenly preempted
&gt; non-existent confirmations!
&gt;
&gt; So perhaps the real issue is about the right level of confirmation,
&gt; its timing, and its delivery.  Once upon a time the smell they added
&gt; to natural gas caused immediate revulsion and alarm, these days most
&gt; of us find it vaguely comforting ...
