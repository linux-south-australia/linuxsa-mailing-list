	Why? This is the big question. Why is the average person not
	going to use Linux? I mean, a lot of people (myself included)
	tend to just blurt out the line "Of course, yer average person
	won't use linux..."

	Why not?

	We have stability, a huge range of apps, so many cutesy graphical
	config tools it makes me wanna hurl, three tonne of documentation...
	(Heck, we even have distributions that people pay for...So it isn't
	the "no such thing as a free lunch" mentality).

	What else is there? Do we need marketting hype? Maybe that's it...?
	Why? Why does the average Joe still (presumably) not want to use
	linux?
	
	Anyone got any ideas?
