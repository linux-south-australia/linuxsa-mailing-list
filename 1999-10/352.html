&gt; Umax Astra 1220S
&gt; ----------------
&gt; 
&gt; This is the latest scanner I've tried.
&gt; It comes with an el kludgo 25-pin pseudo-SCSI interface,
&gt; instead of the standard SCSI which I had expected.
&gt; It also has an el kludgo ISA card with a 25-pin pseudo-SCSI
&gt; interface, and a 25 to 25 pin cable.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't even get "pnpdump" to recognize the existence of the
&gt; ISA card, let alone get the SCSI functionality up or
&gt; get "scanimage" running.

I have a Umax Astra 610S here (well, my wife has it, it was her last
years xmas pressie), but I have to admit horror of horrors we only use
it under Windoze. I never got around to replacing the cheap/nasty/crappy
so-called scsi card that came with it, and it has been low on the
priority list. I tried to see if the card was recognised under Manduck
6.1, but alas no. If anyone has advice for Alan on this subject, please
CC me as well.
