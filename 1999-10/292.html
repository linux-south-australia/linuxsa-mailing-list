Has anyone had major success with Xcdroast? I've tried it several times with
various SCSI controllers and writers but to no avail. In all cases I've been
able to read using the hardware and Linux detects the writer model
correctly. Windows successfully burns disks but Xcdroast crashes and
disappears from the screen. I can enter 'setup' but as soon as I select any
of the 'copy' screens, it bombs. The ever-so-helpful errorlog notes that you
have gone into whatever 'copy' screen then stops reporting. Current hardware
is 4x Teac writer on an Iwill (Advansys 2930 clone) pci scsi card on a P200
running SuSE 6.2 (RH used to do the same thing). Any ideas peoples???

To all who answered my "RE: Can't format ext2 partition in SuSE...." I had
made a partitioning mistake, amongst other things. DON'T START REBUILDING
YOUR SYSTEM WHEN YOU'VE BEEN AWAKE(?) FOR 27 HOURS, its not a bright thing
to do. I rebuilt the system yesterday (awake) and still got the same error!
This time the error came up on the last 2 extended partitions, /usr and
/opt. The only way I could get past it was by upping the inodes from 4096 to
8192 on a couple of partitions. Didn't think it would have mattered to the
install routine. Such is life.
NB. IMHO sleep is still a poor substitute for caffeine !!
