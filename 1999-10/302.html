hi, i have recently installed rh 6.0 and am trying to get dosemu, the ms-dos
emulator up.

i make it to the C:&gt; prompt, but when i try to lredir the c: (or d:) drive to
a directory i get an error.

can anyone tell me what they did to acheive this?  the howto and other doc
files did not provide a suitable answer to this question, in fact they used
different syntaxes for the lredir command between them !

***

i have just read the linux myths, at a funny time.  at a party on the weekend
i was 'accosted' for raising this dosemu problem up with an Eds. sys.eng.
needless to say he was an avid ms nt4 supporter, and almost abused (no
actually he did get on to abuse) me for thinking that linux was a solution to
my needs.  well it is, a comp sci student is *not* going to pay $x00 for an os
that is of a different flavor to the one at school!

i would like some +ve linux resources, can anyone suggest some?  i think my
'friend' had read the aforementioned ms release.  next time i will be
prepared! (unless i just decide he's a jerk (high prob:) and forget it!)

thanks in advance.

mike lindner (alloy)
