As you can see from below, Nick has done a few things to alleviate the
problem of being unable to boot Linux from hdb using lilo.

This has the smell of geometry problems, and while Nick has checked and it
looks like both drives are in LBA mode at the BIOS, when Linux is running
(using a boot floppy),

   cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry
   physical   3148/16/63
   logical    3148/16/63

While those for hdb show that the logical cylinders is less than 1024.

This seems to suggest that hda is not in LBA mode, while hdb is in LBA mode.

Now, I would not have thought that this matters, but Nick cannot boot.

Can anyone suggest anymore things to check?

&gt;Hi Richard,
&gt;
&gt;I re-installed windows on c drive, not before I went and changed in BIOS to
&gt;LBA mode!
&gt;I deleted the existing  partition, then changed to LBA in BIOS, then
&gt;re-partitioned c: drive, checked to LBA mode is is there, yes. Then I
&gt;formated c as a system drive, checked the mode again was LBA, I installed
&gt;windows.
&gt;Then I booted Linux from the floppy, and as root I ran "lilo" all looked OK.
&gt;Re-booted to see how it worked. Still only LI comes up at boot on the screen.
&gt;Back to Linux after "fdisk /mbr"  and entered the "cat
&gt;/proc/ide/hda/geometry" and the result of the command was same as the one
&gt;below. Just as when I sent you the info some time ago. The physical and
&gt;logical size of the winodws drive is 3148.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Output from cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; physical     3148/16/63
&gt;
&gt;&gt; logical         3148/16/63
&gt;
&gt;No changes have been achieved from the above command's point of view.
&gt;I hope I've done all of your advice the right way. Could it be that Linux
&gt;keep the old information saved some place? I probably asked a stupid
&gt;question.
&gt;
&gt;Best wishes,
&gt;
&gt;Nick
