There are a couple of problems with this.  

Firstly, you're better off saying "for i in *" instead of "for i in `ls`".
Secondly, you should think about replacing your "tr" command with
"sed -e 's/\.mp3$/.wav/'" -- The tr command you've provided will
translate *ALL* the m's in its input into w's, the p's into a's and
the 3's into v's.  I suspect this isn't what you want; it'll translate
a filename like "mark newton's mpeg file.mp3" into
"wark newton's waeg file.wav".  I think you'll agree that this sucks
:-)

 &gt; The problem is that the files im trying to play with here have spaces in
 &gt; thier files names and "for" keeps splitting up each word in a file name into
 &gt; a separate command.

Unlikely.  It's more likely that for is seeing a sequence of random 
words on its command line (deposited there by the `ls`) as per usual,
and it's stepping through the words one by one just like it's supposed
to do.

The difference between "for i in `ls`" and "for i in *" is a bit
subtle.  Suppose I run that command in a directory which contains
filenames called "hard rockin mp3 file.mp3" and "sucky mp3 file.mp3".
The `ls` syntax will cause the output of the ls command to be
deposited on the "for" commandline, so the "for" commandline will
behave as if you'd typed:

     for i in hard rockin mp3 file.mp3 sucky mp3 file.mp3
     do 
       ...
     done

The problem with this is that "hard", "rockin", "mp3", "file.mp3",
"sucky", "mp3", and "file.mp3" are all separate tokens, so $i will
take on the value of each one in turn.  What you really want is to
have the whole lot of them globbed together into the same filename...

... which is precisely what the * syntax does.  On a shell command
line, "*" does wildcard expansion.  Each filename that results from
the * expansion will behave as if it was enclosed in quotes, so 
the "for i in *" expression will behave as if you'd executed:

     for i in 'hard rockin mp3 file.mp3' 'sucky mp3 file.mp3'
     do
       ...
     done

So first time 'round the loop, $i has the value "hard rockin mp3 file.mp3",
which is exactly what you want.

So, to summarise, rewrite your command like this:

    for i in *
    do
        mpg123 $i -w `echo $i | sed -e 's/\.mp3$/.wav/'`
    done

... or perhaps simpler:

    for i in *
    do 
        mpg123 $i -w `basename $i .mp3`.wav
    done

... which uses the basename(1) command, which is intended to do 
filename suffix identification and rewriting.

Hope that helps,
