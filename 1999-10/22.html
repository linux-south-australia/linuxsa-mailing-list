I would have to say John, that most of it is the fact that we have
been lead down the path by that golden ring installed in our noses by
Bill Gates. I have to admit that he has a marketing skill none
surpassed! When he took on Big Blue and literly took the DOS OS market
from them was nothing short of genius. Now what I see it will take is
to fight fire with fire. The same tactics have to be used against him.

Right now I feel that Linux, in whatever flavor, is at the point that
massive hipe has to happen. Which one of the flavors is going to be
advertized in every rag mag out there, with every PC vendor and maker
known. This is where Linux is falling short, not in the stability or
usefulness, just in the flavors that are available from many sources.
Either one or two of these sources have to be pushed to the top and
the others fall where thay may or the struggle to make the OS go to
the top is going to be a long hard push!

The hardest thing to find on the average store shelves is Linux. You
find when Gates puts out his so called 'working' OS that the people,
even the lonely Joe Schmoe off the street has a crack at buying the OS
right now! Not have to wait for 1 or 2 weeks for it to be delivered
via snail mail, but he has the use of it NOW! AND he has the use of it
at a price that he can scrape together in a short period of time.

What is in the breeze now is Windows 2000 is going to come out in
maybe 10 different flavors. Mister average Joe on the street doesn't
know all of this is going on. All he will see is the Windows 2000
label on the store shelves and will reach for it! Having the product
on the shelves with other support software comparable to what support
MS has gotten for its OS is the ONLY way I can see it grow into a
household name. When your product is out of site, then it is out of
mind. This is where the 'average user' will not have the chance to use
a superior OS! 

I have found that a person out shopping doesn't even know what they
want, they just KNOW they want it and have to spend their hard earned
cash on it! It will take salespeople, not store clerks, to hipe the
product and point out its strengths AND its weaknesses. They have to
make it perfectly clear that THIS OS is being worked upon by the WORLD
and not just one company. The pricing has to be so that it would be
really hard for the 'average user' not to want to purchase it on the
spot. This is not taking into consideration the apeal of packaging
too!

Enough of my soap box ramblings! If you like what you are using then
tell your friends and neighbors and their fiends about it. Make an
offer to install Linux on their machine and get it configured for
them. Make the promise to change it back if they don't like what they
see! How did you get your first copy of MSDOS? How did you learn how
to use it? How much did you pay for that first copy??? Answer these in
your own mind and you will see and find the way to make Linux the
number one asked for OS in the world. This WILL drag the other
software companies out of their ditch to take a look at this NEW and
ALL powerfull OS that ALL are talking about. Then and only then will
these companies make the leap to produce more programs for the
'average person' out there to use, hence WORLD DOMINATION IN THE
COMPUTER OS MARKET!

I step down now! Thank you all for listening to my pointless
ramblings...

&gt; &gt; I have to agree with you totally too, Don! It is the end result
&gt; &gt; stability along with flexability and security that is wanted. So it is
&gt; &gt; slick as a greased pig to install, but nothing works properly (Am I
&gt; &gt; suggesting Microsoft? hmmm) doesn't make it... In most cases the
&gt; &gt; average person isn't going to use Linux. As it stands now, Linux has
&gt; 
&gt;         Why? This is the big question. Why is the average person not
&gt;         going to use Linux? I mean, a lot of people (myself included)
&gt;         tend to just blurt out the line "Of course, yer average person
&gt;         won't use linux..."
&gt; 
&gt;         Why not?
&gt; 
&gt;         We have stability, a huge range of apps, so many cutesy graphical
&gt;         config tools it makes me wanna hurl, three tonne of documentation...
&gt;         (Heck, we even have distributions that people pay for...So it isn't
&gt;         the "no such thing as a free lunch" mentality).
&gt; 
&gt;         What else is there? Do we need marketting hype? Maybe that's it...?
&gt;         Why? Why does the average Joe still (presumably) not want to use
&gt;         linux?
&gt; 
&gt;         Anyone got any ideas?
