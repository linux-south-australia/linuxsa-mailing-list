What about hotmail.com.

I believe it kept breaking when they ported to NT. 

It is again running stably on, would you believe it, a *nix platform.

Subject: Microsoft don't use their DNS - was RE: LinuxMyths.asp


&gt;
&gt; I seem to remember looking at a site map about a year ago, and I think
&gt; www.microsft.com main three clusters consist of about 150 NT pentium
&gt; servers. The mind only boggles to think what it would be by now. Quite
&gt; amazing when you think that ftp.cdrom.com is still *one* bsd machine.
&gt;
&gt; Does microsoft use any sort of worldwide distributed server technology
&gt; like yahoo.com et al? I'm assuming by the pathetic performance of
&gt; their web site that they don't
&gt;

Yes they do, they use Microsoft content replication service which is a part
of Windows NT 4 Datacenter.  (Not released to the public).

I noticed this while I was nosying round the EDS maintained southern
hemisphere MSN site (located 340 Findon Rd.)  This is THE most connected
building in the southern hemisphere BTW.  What was amusing as I walked
through the rows and rows of compaq proliant rack mounted 4-way ppro's was a
couple of machines off in one corner.  When I asked about them I found that
they were solaris boxen doing the DNS!  Microsoft choose not to use their
own DNS when it comes to _their_ mission critical sites, and this is the
reason I recommend none of my clients use it either.

Sorry bout the off-topic nature of this post.
