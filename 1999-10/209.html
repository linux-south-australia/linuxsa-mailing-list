<H1>linux scsi scanner recommendations?</H1>

<PRE>
Can anyone suggest to me a reasonably priced (about $500 or less)
SCSI scanner that is supported by linux?
And I want this to have:
1.	Really good, sharp focus.
2.	Really good colour differentiation,
	especially for resolving detail in shadows.

My old Dick Smith Dexxa 4800 parallel port scanner
has poor spatial resolution and poor colour resolution,
despite the nominal specs.
(This scanner is apparently really an Artec As6E in disguise.)

It seems like USB scanners are out, because linux kernel 2.2.10
doesn't support them.
And the Acer SCSI scanners don't seem to be supported by linux.
I've heard that the Umax Astra 1220S is not so good as the
Epson GT-7000 SCSI, which has just been removed from distribution
and replaced by a $200 more costly GT-12000. (Someone suggested
that the latter is the same as the GT-7000, but they changed
the name so that they could put the price up. But I wouldn't know.)

The trouble with SCSI scanners is that most shops don't have them
in stock, and even when they do, they don't have a SCSI card
in a running PC so that I can test it.
So I'll end up having to buy first, and test after.

Therefore if anyone knows of a really good value for money
SCSI scanner for about $500 that is supported by linux software,
I'd appreciate any hints.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

--------------------
PS.
Regarding some queries I made a while back about SCSI adapters,
I've found that the $70 Tekram DC-310 SCSI adapter works fine.
Maybe I missed out on something by not buying the
Adaptec AHA-2940 or whatever for $470. But that's a big price difference!

--------------------
PPS.
Regarding a query I made a while back (or maybe I didn't) about
converting GIF files to PNG, I still can't work out how to
convert animated and transparent GIFs to PNG.
Can anyone suggest a format which:
a.	supports animated and/or transparent images, and
b.	is supported by browsers?
I found that Tiff works, but expands a 10k animated GIF to 70k.
PNG files with transparent background seem to always have a black
background when I view them in browsers.
