I agree.

If I want to delete something, I'm sure I am doing it for a good reason.
I don't need some smart-aleck program asking me if I'm sure. 
When using windows, it continually infuriates me by asking "are you
sure?", often more than once.
(Try deleteing a directory, containing multiple read-only folders, each
containing read-only executeable files, in windows. You'll be there
forever in the GUI clicking 'yes to all', and then 'yes to all', again
and again. Microsoft have a very annoying definition of "all"!)

If I was giving an account to a newbie, sure, I'd alias rm to rm -i. In
fact, I'd probably alias it to move the file to /var/tmp/deleted_files
or something like that too, until they learnt what this 'rm' command
does. ;)

However, I know what I'm doing, and I know that if i'm root I need to be
extra careful when doing anything. Anyone who is genuinely worried that
they might accidentally remove files probably shouldn't be allowed to
have root access anyway, IMHO.

Most stuff can be done without being root, such is the design of unix. 
Learn to create ~/.foorc files rather than su-ing to root and editting
the master /etc/whateverrc file, for instance.

Practice good directory structures, so that a rm * won't annihilate more
than you want it too, etc.

PS. Have you ever noticed that init 0/6, or 'reboot', etc. don't ask for
confirmation?
They're examples of where only root can run them, and it's assumed that
root knows what he or she is doing!

&gt; Nuts.  That'll learn me to muck with distribution binaries.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Emacs does slighty better if set up to edit
&gt; &gt; DOS files: at least the "DOS" mode indicator is always visible.
&gt; 
&gt; I do get the [dos format] indication in the status line, but only
&gt; until it's been cleared (as I think Mark pointed out).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The use of "rm -i" under root is more good practice, rather than
&gt; &gt; any DOSism (a DOSism would be "alias del rm -i").
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it's me.  I don't swan about as root unless it's for a good
&gt; reason, and it's been a _long_ time (probably before epoch :-) since
&gt; I've accidently deleted/copied-over-the-top-of something.  What right
&gt; has /bin/rm that it queries my deletion of /etc/passwd?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Surely people don't start Netscape as root unless they are looking for
&gt; &gt; JavaScript bugs?
&gt; 
&gt; :-)
