 LOL....

 Okay... so is anybody going to have a shot a building on of these stupidly
 expensive dual processor ECMs???

 I think we are starting to prove that for uses like an ECM, a linux machine
 (well not a x86 anyway) is just not right for the job.

 Really, there is no point in using a multiply use kernel (linux) and system
 (x86) for a single use task. It would be much easier to get a slower
 processor like a AVR (atmel) or 68xxx (motorola) to do the job and then
 interface with a linux box.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe some UNIX systems allow a process to get dedicated access to
&gt; &gt; one or more processors in a multi-processor environment. If you could
&gt; &gt; hack the APIC IRQ handler so as to pass "your" interrupt (say IRQ 5) to
&gt; &gt; processor number 2, and have a dedicated process running on it, that'd
&gt; &gt; be cool. Processor number 1 runs everything else, leaving processor 2
&gt; &gt; able to sit in a busy-loop waiting for input.
&gt; &gt; I wonder if that would help.

&gt; &gt; &gt; as far as I'm aware, I dont think there is a gret need to merge
rtlinux
&gt; &gt; &gt; and "normal" linux - they are really just too different.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From what i remember, to "make" rtlinux, you patch the source tree
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; voila. there you go. So I would say that the rtlinux patches would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; slightly behind the latest kernel releases (for obvious reasons) and I
&gt; &gt; &gt; would not be surprised if major kernel jumps take quite a while to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; ported to rtlinux.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; On that note, i'm not even sure if rtlinux patches the 2.2.x
kernel....
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm I also dont know what the status is of rtlinux and smp (or vmware
&gt; &gt; &gt; for that matter ;).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jake,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've just checked out the ~rtlinux site (again),
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to find out what the relation between RT-Linux
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and standard linux is. But I could not find out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the relation between them, except in a static sense.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Question:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is RT-Linux a distinct fork from standard linux
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which has gone its won way?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or is there some way in which standard linux
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and RT-linux are continually synchronized?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it's the latter, then RT-linux would be much more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attractive, and there would be no really good
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason why it shouldn't be part of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard linux code.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most interesting technical point in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; RT-Linux site was the comment that on a 33 MHz
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intel CPU, the latency is about 30 uS,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a mere 1000 cycles or so!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, I once worked on a real-time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; project that essentially failed to reach its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objective because the latency of response
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hardware interrupts by the philips XA chip was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 times what it should have been.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It turned out that the monitor software was looking
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up tables to hand interrupts to.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To get really fast response, one really has to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have direct control over interrupt vector tables.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously even RT-Linux does not let you do that.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alan Kennington.
