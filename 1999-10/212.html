I'll try again then :)

The first thing you have to do is get the card to be recognised.
Boot up windows and get the irq/io address for your card

(right click on my computer and choose properties, find your network card
in device manager and click properties - this should list the irq/address)

Now in linux it's time to get the card to work:

try:  modprobe 3c509 io=0xYYY irq=YYY     (where YYY are the io/irq's from
                                           windows)

If it finds your card then you should get no errors/feedback.
If your card is not at the io address then try withouth the io= bit as it
should autoprobe your card - note this may hang your machine if it fails.

once this is working you can add the options to /etc/conf.modules as
mentioned in the last email I sent.

If you can't get it to find your card let me know. Until it knows where
your card is there is no chance that you'll get your network up.

Once it finds your card you can use netcfg to get your network up. Since
your linking it to windows you probably will use samba to share files.

The as mentioned before the main thing is to get it to recognise your
card.

The kernel has some help on this:

cd /usr/src/linux
make menuconfig

then under networking devices -&gt; ethernet devices you'll find your card
listed. Read the help on it.

It mentions you may need the software to disable plugnplay.

Cheers,
