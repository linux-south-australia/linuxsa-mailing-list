&gt; This is what I was getting at earlier.
&gt; I know that car ECMs are extremely efficient, but even given the
&gt; massively (relatively) worse efficiency of a fullblown O/S, you'd think
&gt; that a 200+ MHz processor could handle a mere 8000rpm. (Which is only
&gt; 133 revs per second. Isnt a 200MHz processor doing 2 million things per
&gt; second? Sure, some instructions take more than 1 Hz to execute, but
&gt; still, you've got way, way more than you need..You'd think.)

200MHz = 200 million cycles per instruction; at around 2-4 cycles 
per instruction (an extremely crude average, and probably ignoring 
the benefits of pipelining), that's 100-50 million instructions per 
second, not 2 million things per second ((grin) unless you define 
"thing" as...).  However, 200MHz on the CPU is not the same as 66MHz 
on the bus.  If you're doing CPU-bound or FPU-bound stuff, the extra 
cycles are good, otherwise, they simply increase the power consumption 
as all those transistors thrash around while you wait for the data to 
come in over the bus.  

You'd need to do things like lock the hard-real-time bits into the 
on-CPU cache, so that there wasn't a cache miss at the wrong moment.  
Waiting for the dynamic memory to load your code or data is very likely 
to be a good way of missing the deadline.  And that's the nub of 
real-time systems: if it's not done within the time limit, you're 
behaving incorrectly, and recovery from missed deadlines is quite 
often impossible.  

You'd even start to sweat if someone added a driver to the kernel 
that locked off interrupts for more than a handful of cycles.
