&gt;Spam is spam; moderating it doesn't change that.  If commercial organisations
&gt;want a mailing list to distribute their commercial announcements, perhaps a
&gt;new list, linuxsa-commercials, might be in order.  On the other hand, genuine
&gt;press releases relevant to linux might not constitute spam.  Anyone who wants
&gt;to 'moderate' such posts will already realise the risks that they take.

LUV (Linux Users of Victoria) announces "freebies" in it's monthly meeting
announcements (things that have been given to us to give away).  When this
happens, we usually type about a paragraph of non-hype about the product,
with a pointer to the company.

Occassionally members will announce discounts available on select products
to LUV members.  My counsel would be to say "we will announce any
discounts that you may offer our members, with specific product details
where appropriate but not pure commercialism or hype".  Pointers to
resources are good (eg. "O'Reilly are having a sale, 10% off, check out
xyz.com" cf. "This week O'Reilly would like you to buy zyx")

But O'Reilly are such a legitimate company I don't think you'd ever get
the feeling you're being spamed by them.

just my opinions,
N
