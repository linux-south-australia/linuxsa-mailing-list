On Mon, 06 Apr 1998, mtippett wrote in reply to my question re lpd:
&gt;
&gt;Is the job being queued? (check with lpq)
&gt;
Yes, all prints end up in their appropriate queues, and the queues all work once
the lpd process is killed and then re-started. I don't have to flush the queues
or lpc up or anything fancy, so I suspect the problem is silly rather than
terminal :)))

&gt;Try starting lpd with the log option. (lpd -l) You might need
&gt;to modify a startup script to get lpd to start with the options.
&gt;This option only works for network requests (but depending on your
&gt;config this might be where the problem lies.
&gt;
&gt;Have you checked your syslogs. (If someone has the source for the lpr
&gt;system handy could you check to see if there is a syslog entry to assist
&gt;with debugging (there is a print.debug entry for the Solaris lp system that
&gt;helped me in the past)).  If someone has got access to the source
&gt;are there any 'undocumented' options that allow more verbose
&gt;debugging?
&gt;
&gt;Where is the job going?  To a networked printer, or locally?
Local printer.
&gt;
&gt;If it is local, is the lp module being loaded? (check with /sbin/lsmod)
&gt;
It's compiled into the kernel. As a rule, I make my kernels with as few modules
as possible. I don't have a need for modularising lp, but will change that if I
get rich enough to buy a zip drive :)

 &gt;If you can't get it going you could lookat lprng (a supposed lpr 
 &gt;replacement).  I haven't used it but it might work a bit better.
 &gt;
 &gt;You might want to also try a strace -p &lt;lpd-pid&gt;.
 &gt;If you redirect stdout +stderr to a file you might be able to see
 &gt;if it is getting into a loop.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, (and good luck).

&gt;Matt

Thanks Matt. I will check the logs, and try strace. I haven't used strace
before, so it will be a new adventure. I don't want to go to lprng, I prefer the
BSD lpr stuff. Funny thing is, it all worked well out-of-the box, but I fear my
sticky fingers may have strayed. I just can't remember what it is I have been
meddling with that could have stopped lpd from working properly. I will report
back when fixed, but if anyone else has any hints in the meantime, please feel
free to offer them.
