&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone out there offer experience with writeable CDs?  I am
&gt; considering purchasing one for data backup on a Redhat 4.2 system.  I
&gt; would be interested to know:
&gt; 
&gt; a. Is a special driver is required, or is the standard /dev/hd* OK?
&gt; b, Is there any particular type of hardware to look for?

There shouldn't be anything special.  Check out the CD-Writing-HOWTO in
/usr/doc for more information.  It seems to only reference SCSI CD-R 
drives.

&gt; c. Will there be any problems having two CDs, i.e. a 20x CD-ROM plus a
&gt; (say, 2xW,6xR) CD-R?

There shouldn't be.  But be aware that writing CD-R is a one shot affair,
if your system gets bogged down then there goes the CD.  But for the
most part 2x Writing should really hick-up.

&gt; 
&gt; d. How does the write speed compare with other backup systems?

Writing, well 300 k/s isn't that crash hot.  But when you have
stamped your CD and need to extract data from it that is where it
comes into usefulness.  

Hope that helps,  I haven't ever done CD-R work before (well except
through an old SUN with an OLD SCSI CD-R, and some really crappy
software.

Cheers,

Matt
