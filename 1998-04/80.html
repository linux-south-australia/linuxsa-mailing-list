Yer yer... this is just another bitch about NT... I do have something
against it, but you've got to love it coz it's so easy to use (okay, i
take that back =])

&gt; I have just spent around 7 hours on two NT boxes.
&gt; One a P100, the other a PII-233. Both had 96 MB of RAM.
&gt; I estimate I spent at least 2-3 of those hours waiting for them to reboot.

I can agree 100% with that statement. At my school we have a P200 with
96 MB and about 6 GB hdd space. Our admin guy spent about 4 weeks
setting it all up and it still crashes quite regularly. The DHCP service
gives us the most trouble because it always stuffs up 'bout once a week.
Grrrrr... (But what's most annoying is our router - extremely
temperamental piece of crap. If you are going to buy a router DON'T get
a TribeWorks!!!)

&gt; A 'Plug and Play' network card decided not to ride that wave and 
plonked
&gt; itself on IRQ 3 over the top of COM2. NT found 1 port missing, so it
&gt; decided it may as well nuke COM1 as well.

Never trust Plug 'n Pray.... Long live jumpers!

&gt; After NT prompts you with a login dialog and you punch in your
&gt; username/password, it takes anothing 3-5 minutes to get to the desktop.

Nothing unusual happening there. It's even worse when you want to log
out and logon as someone else.. 10 mins minimum wait there.

&gt; Why? There's almost no disk activity. It might still be starting services,
&gt; but with no disk activity? The wait is almost identical in length for both
&gt; machines, despite a speed difference factor of roughly two.
 
No disk activity? The disks never stop spinning on ours. All they do is
thrash i've been told they keep going like it at 10pm.

&gt; I installed a second ethernet card. No errors, no crashes, but the card
&gt; simply does not get assigned an interface. Replacing with another card
&gt; fixes instantly. The first card worked in the other NT box.
 
We are having troubles like that right now because we are trying to link
our netware server with it. You wouldn't think it would happen with an
accton or 3com would you? I'd rather be using netware anyway. Reminds me
of linux. =]

&gt; I change some TCP/IP settings. Reboot.
&gt; I install Communicator. Reboot.
&gt; On startup NT detects a logitech mouse. We have no logitech mouse. We have
&gt; added no mice, or indeed any hardware. After detecting it - reboot.
&gt; I change a modem setting. Reboot.
&gt; IP networking not working, even though all the settings look OK. Reboot
&gt; fixes it.
 
Same with win95... bitch when you have 40 odd PC's.

&gt; The P100 tells me to shut down and restart. I try to do so. When I select
&gt; Restart it churns for a while, Dr. Watson crashes (isn't Dr. Watson the
&gt; program that watches when others crash??) and Windows comes back up. Every
&gt; time. I have to press the reset button.
&gt; 
&gt; To any NT advocates out there (not that I'm expecting many in here!), I
&gt; will agree that this is only during the setup stage. But this setup stage
&gt; is 1/3 configuration, 2/3 plain old waiting. That is ridiculous. My
&gt; (fairly limited) experince with established servers is that even once
&gt; setup right they are either prone to crash, or suffer from flakiness after
&gt; a few days uptime that requires a reboot.

Only true for NT =] Our netware server only crashes when the temp gets
over 35 degrees C - and that's only because it's in an unventilated
office. Plus it's a breeze to setup. Isn't netware based on unix or
something? It looks remarkably similar

&gt; I am confident that the PII could have been replaced by a late 486 with 16
&gt; MB of RAM running Linux, doing a better job, with less configuration
&gt; hassles and less maintainence, not to mention at a fraction of the cost.
&gt; In addition, it would be maintained from anywhere in the world, provided
&gt; it's dialup 'net connection works.

That would depend upon the load. I would say if it had 32MB it could
outperform it in our situation. All the NT sever does is act as a proxy
and mail server. The web server is only used internally for publishing
student projects. Our netware server is only a p133 with 64MB and the
most load i've ever seen it under is 4% and whats more amazing (???) is
that it's got twice as many computers connected to it as the NT server.
I'd like to see NT running on an Alpha though... mind you i'd like to
see linux running on one too.

Linux is definantely looking like a better choice every day. We might
set up one and run it for a week to compare them though I see no need to
do that because i already know the result. NT: 0 Linux: 1
