&gt; Gentlepersons,

&gt; Interesting article on NT vs UNIX/Linux

&lt;RANT&gt;

[Before beginning this rant, note that I have not visited the site
 mentioned]

There is no contest.

I have just spent around 7 hours on two NT boxes.

One a P100, the other a PII-233. Both had 96 MB of RAM.

I estimate I spent at least 2-3 of those hours waiting for them to reboot.

A 'Plug and Play' network card decided not to ride that wave and plonked
itself on IRQ 3 over the top of COM2. NT found 1 port missing, so it
decided it may as well nuke COM1 as well.

After NT prompts you with a login dialog and you punch in your
username/password, it takes anothing 3-5 minutes to get to the desktop.
Why? There's almost no disk activity. It might still be starting services,
but with no disk activity? The wait is almost identical in length for both
machines, despite a speed difference factor of roughly two.

I installed a second ethernet card. No errors, no crashes, but the card
simply does not get assigned an interface. Replacing with another card
fixes instantly. The first card worked in the other NT box.

I change some TCP/IP settings. Reboot.

I install Communicator. Reboot.

On startup NT detects a logitech mouse. We have no logitech mouse. We have
added no mice, or indeed any hardware. After detecting it - reboot.

I change a modem setting. Reboot.

IP networking not working, even though all the settings look OK. Reboot
fixes it.

The P100 tells me to shut down and restart. I try to do so. When I select
Restart it churns for a while, Dr. Watson crashes (isn't Dr. Watson the
program that watches when others crash??) and Windows comes back up. Every
time. I have to press the reset button. 

To any NT advocates out there (not that I'm expecting many in here!), I
will agree that this is only during the setup stage. But this setup stage
is 1/3 configuration, 2/3 plain old waiting. That is ridiculous. My
(fairly limited) experince with established servers is that even once
setup right they are either prone to crash, or suffer from flakiness after
a few days uptime that requires a reboot.

NT uptime is stored in a dword. It cycles after 40something days. Funny
about that.

I am confident that the PII could have been replaced by a late 486 with 16
MB of RAM running Linux, doing a better job, with less configuration
hassles and less maintainence, not to mention at a fraction of the cost.
In addition, it would be maintained from anywhere in the world, provided
it's dialup 'net connection works.

Final word - if you ever want a laugh look at the latest MS Exchange
server README. When upgrading from previous versions it must convert the
users mailboxes into a new format. The README has examples of PII's with
large SCSI disks taking tens of *hours*.

For another laugh load a 60MB text file into notepad. Watch as server
grinds to a halt.

&lt;/RANT&gt;

The growth of Linux and the death of MS will make my job much easier. Go
Linux.
