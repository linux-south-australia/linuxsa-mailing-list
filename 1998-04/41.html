&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     Although not all that new to linux I have never done much with
&gt; script files. Hence could the script guru's give me a little help with
&gt; this (probably trivial) question.

I am not saying I am a script GURU either, but here goes.

&gt; If I do the following:
&gt; #!/bin/bash
You might consider using /bin/sh (which is really bash, but is
intended to act the same as the POSIX sh.

&gt; FRED="name1 name2 name3"
&gt; JOE="number1 number2 number3"

&gt; for i in $JOE; do
&gt;     if [ -n `who |grep i` ] then echo NAME fi

I would recommend unrolling all the statements, it makes it
easier to read (But that is just a personal feeling).

Also, try to unobfuscate the code by doing tricky things like
execution-assignements.

I won't try fixing your code, but take the advice above and you should
find it works a bit better and is easier to read.

&gt; Also does anyone know of a place which helps explain scripting files?

There are a whole pile of O'Rielly and Associates books that cover that
sort of thing.

As to web based tutorials, not much.

But what I can say is that if you can code in pseudo-code you should be
able to map things back into bourne shell fairly easily.

Cheers,

Matt
