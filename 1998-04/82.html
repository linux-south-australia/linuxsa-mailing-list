<PRE>
O'Rielly and Associates, through their Australian distributor,
have agreed to supply some Linux related books to LinuxSA as door 
prizes.  

Below is a modified press release from them about a new service that
they are offering.  I have chopped it severely to make it sound a little
less commercial.  

Of course LinuxSA doesn't directly endorse the product, but none the less
I think it would be useful for those struggling students who want to get
those books.

Anyway, here goes.  Remember to support the companies that support Linux and
LinuxSA.

Cheers,

Matt
