&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I'm trying to set up xdm to act as a dumb linux terminal.
&gt; I've set the only entry in the /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess to
&gt; be * CHOOSER BROADCAST.  I thought (after reading
&gt; the man pages) that this should start up X and provide
&gt; a list of all the hosts around which are "willing to manage".
&gt; However, what actually happens, is the normal xlogin
&gt; screen pops up....
&gt; Has anyone had any experience with this?

Hi Ben,

When you start xdm, it will do two things:

- listen for requests from remote displays
- start up local X servers as dictated to by the Xservers file and
  do the xlogin thing

You are seeing what happens when xdm starts up a local X server.  Go
to /etc/X11/xdm (or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm) and comment out this line
from the Xservers <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X

That will prevent xdm from starting the X server itself (you don't
want it to because it will then put the xlogin thing on there).

Taking advantage of the other thing that xdm does (that is, listening
for requests from remote displays), you can then run commands like
this (from anywhere, including your console):

X -query yourhost
- contact yourhost and get it to display its xlogin thing on your
display

X -broadcast
- broadcast on the network for anyone wanting to display their xlogin
thing on your display (the first one to respond gets picked)

X -indirect yourhost
- contact yourhost and get it to broadcast for hosts wanting to
display their xlogin thing on your display, then give you a menu and
let you pick which one you want

The last one seems to be what you're asking for.

I can't see a way to get xdm to start an X server for you and to not
put its xlogin thing there (if you try ":0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X
-indirect yourhost" then you'll end up with both the xlogin screen and
the host selection menu; not good!), but you can do something like
this in your /etc/inittab:

x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon
x1:5:respawn:/usr/X11R6/bin/X -indirect yourhost

This gets init to keep the X server alive and use yourhost for its
chooser.

I hope this helps explain things a bit?  If understand your question
right, you don't actually need to run xdm (just do X -indirect
someotherhostonyournetwork or even give X -indirect 255.255.255.255 a
go).
