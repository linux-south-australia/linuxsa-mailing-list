Hmmmm... LinuxSA seems to be more for individual people. This is not to say
that they will not help others. It just means that it would be nice to get a
name with a message (even if it's just below with a signed name). Having
some Pty. Ltd. Company ask for free help is not really what LinuxSA is about
(at least I didn't think it was, correct me if I'm wrong). We are of course
willing to help you as an individual. Maybe Shingumi Resources Pty Ltd is
some sort of front for ASIO or something and you are not allowed to reveal
your true identity. 

Having said this, I see NO reason why you would have to install Novell to
run Linux. Maybe if you explain in more detail what it is that you are
trying to do (unless of course this is secret as well). Are you accessing a
Novell Server at the other end? Do you just want to connect to the internet?

Let us know.

Horst.

&gt; I would like to install linux on one of these , and wonder if anyone would
&gt; mind heplping at the next meeting maybe?
&gt; 
&gt; I have been networking through win95, but heard I may have to set up a
&gt; client server suchas  Novell if I want to run Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't yet have a permanent connection to the internet, but hoped I could
&gt; connect at least ,connect long enough to test  things out through the dialup
&gt; account. Does anyone know if this is possible?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for reading this.
