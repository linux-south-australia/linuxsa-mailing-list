&gt; Has anyone in LinuxSA land ever tried the StarOffice Package?  Does it
&gt; work with RedHat 5.0?

I downloaded it about a week ago and installed it installed on RedHat 5.0
without any problems. I had already  upgraded the libc5 libraries to
5.4.38 though (according to the README that comes with StarOffice, libc 5.4.22
or higher is required).

&gt; Would it be worth downloading 43.4MB is a large investment of time and
&gt; bandwidth?  Is there any local sites that I could download it from?

I haven't used it much yet but it seems to be fairly stable and the
applications look very similar to the MS applications. It's a bit slow
loading up though (486DX4-100, 32Mb).
I don't think that there were any local sites listed on the download page
but the site I downloaded it from in the US was quite fast. I don't
remember which one it was though.


Hope this helps,


Phil
