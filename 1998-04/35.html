hi all,
I was reading with interest the recent questions about running
Enlightenment, and I decided to download and have a look myself.   From
what I could see it looks like a really good window manager, lots of
features (documented bugs) and plenty of configuration files to play
with and keep a fiddler like myself happy for quite some time.

My question however, is probably something that I've overlooked but I
don't seem to be able to find.  I can compile and install Enlightenment
and it works like a charm, I'm having trouble getting E-term to compile.

it seems to be failing on the final linking phase of the compilation,
and I have no real indication why.  From what I can see, I have
neglected to install some trifling driver/library/brain and I'm not
getting enough information from the compiler as to what's missing.  If
anyone has a list of pre-requisites needed to install E-term I would be
greatly apreciative of any information on this subject.  If anyone else
has had similar problems or even better, knows a solution to mine, I
would also love to hear from you.

I'm running Slackware 96 I have kernel 2.0.33 compiled and running like
a dream, gimp toolkit 0.99.3 all the other libraries I found listed
(grlib, etc) , enlightenment 0.13.3 and a (please, no laughing) 486
DX4-100 to run (crawl) it all on.

thanks in advance for any and all assistance recieved (constructive
criticism welcome too :)  )

Tim Aslat
