&gt;If netscape is in your path, then it should automatically appear on
&gt;your desktop.


Path? You mean there's an autoexec.bat file in there somewhere:-)

When I said I was new to Linux,  I meant absolutely totally virgin, I'm
still having problems remembering to use the "/" instead of the "\" when
navigating through the file structure. I have no idea how to set the path on
my system.

I have bought a couple of books, including "A Practical Guide to Linux" by
Mark Sobell. I've been reading the book as bedtime reading. (My wife thinks
that's really wierd!!!) but havn't reached the section on creating or
editing the Linux equivellent to the MSDOS autoexec.bat file.

&gt;How did you install it?  (you shouldn't need to do it without RPM;
&gt;both communicator and navigator are available on the CD in RPM format)

included installation instructions. What I really wanted was NN3.0 (a
smaller installation) and didn't realise there were other versions of
Communicator or Navigator on the Red Hat CD, will check it out tonight. It
took me a long time to work out that you have to mount the CDROM before you
can use it.

Now what does this funny "vi" thingo, and why doesn't "mount /mnt/floppy"
work, and who's this user called root, and why is he the only bloke who can
install software on my machine, and where is the ..........................

Thanks for the help

Steve
