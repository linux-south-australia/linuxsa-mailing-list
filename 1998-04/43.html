Howdy Ben...

&gt;     Although not all that new to linux I have never done much with
&gt; script files. Hence could the script guru's give me a little help with
&gt; this (probably trivial) question.

I haven't done a great deal with bash (I'm more a tcsh or perl person), but I'll
give it a go.  Anyone else please also feel free to comment!

&gt; If I do the following:
&gt; 
&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt; FRED="name1 name2 name3"
&gt; JOE="number1 number2 number3"
&gt; 
&gt; now with the following
&gt; 
&gt; for i in $JOE; do
&gt;     if [ -n `who |grep i` ] then echo NAME fi
&gt; .
&gt; 
&gt; So I want the corresponding NAME for the number any ideas?

There are a number of doing this, but the way I'd go about this, off the top of
my head, is to do the following:

| .
| .
| .
|
| COUNT=1
| 
| for i in $JOE; do
| 
|   if [ -n "`who | grep $i`" ]; then   # Make sure that $i is unique here!
|     echo $FRED | cut -d" " -f$COUNT
|   fi
| 
|   COUNT=`expr $COUNT + 1`
| 
| done

The cut command is effectively pulling the ith element out of the FRED array.
Of course if "number1" is actually just a number ("1"), then you can dispense
with the COUNT variable and simply use -f$i.

&gt; Also does anyone know of a place which helps explain scripting files?
 
I don't know of any offhand, but a great way to learn to program using shell
scripts is to find as many as you can by other authors, and simply work out how
they've done certain things.  You'll find quite a lot of system utilities are
written using shell scripts (well, they are under Solaris, Linux may be
different... I haven't kept up with the latest versions... hence joining this
list!).  Try and get scripts from as many different sources/authors as possible,
as you'll invariably find one person does something much cleaner/easier/faster
than someone else.

Above all, ask lots of people lots of questions (like you already have)!!!

If you want to be scared (and I mean REALLY scared), take a look at a GNU
configure script that comes with a lot of source code these days.  There's
lots of useful tips and tricks in there if you can be bothered wading through
the thing.

I hope this has been of some use!

Tim.
