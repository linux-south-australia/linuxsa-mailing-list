Thankyou to Ben, Wes, Phil and Matthew who provided replies to my
queries.  Here is a brief summary for anyone interested:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "Jon" == Jon Schutz &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jon@caemrad.com.au">jon@caemrad.com.au</A>&gt; writes:

  Jon&gt; Can anyone out there offer experience with writeable CDs?  I am
  Jon&gt; considering purchasing one for data backup on a Redhat 4.2 system.  I
  Jon&gt; would be interested to know:

  Jon&gt; a. Is a special driver is required, or is the standard /dev/hd* OK?

The standard /dev/hd* is not the way to do it; SCSI CD-R require
/dev/sga.  Special CD writer software is necessary. cdrecord and
cdwrite are the common burner packages, plus there are some user interface
packages (X-CDRoast and create-a-cd, for example) which use one or the
other burner package.  These things can be found at

  Jon&gt; b, Is there any particular type of hardware to look for?

Bottom line is SCSI.  I've seen a couple lines in the description of
one piece of software that suggested you _could_ use IDE, but...
(followed by all sorts of caveats and discouragement).  Everything
else says SCSI, SCSI, SCSI, ...

cdwrite does not support Sony drives.  cdrecord supports a limited
number of Sony models.  Most other major brands appear to be there.

  Jon&gt; c. Will there be any problems having two CDs, i.e. a 20x CD-ROM plus a
  Jon&gt; (say, 2xW,6xR) CD-R?

For data I/O, no problems.  For audio you might only be able to use
one drive for playback, depending on your hardware/software setup.

  Jon&gt; d. How does the write speed compare with other backup systems?

The write speed at 2xW is 300kB/s, which is not particularly quick.
Read speed is excellent compared to serial devices.

Using CDs for backups has some limitations, as all of the data needs
to be pre-formatted (e.g. with an ISO9660 filesystem) in a separate
one-big-file before being written to the CD; this means you need as
much spare disk space as what you're backing up.  There are perhaps
ways around this, but they may not be as reliable.

There is a CD-Writing-HOWTO (it wasn't in /usr/doc/HOWTO on my RedHat
4.2 system, but it is on 5.0).  The HOWTO explains it all.

Thanks again for the help.
