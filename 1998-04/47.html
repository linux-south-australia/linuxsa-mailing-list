Hi everyone,

I'm still looking for people who satisfy the following criteria:

1) They use Linux,
2) They will be at the LinuxSA meeting next Tuesday (the 21st of
   April),
3) They are willing to go a 5 minute talk about what they use Linux
   for.

The current list of people who have put their hand up are:

Geoffrey D. Bennett
Tony Galliford
Bruce Moffatt
David Newall
Franco Principe
Paul Schulz
Matthew Tippett

Here is the original announcement for those who missed it:

-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----
At the last LinuxSA meeting, there seemed to be some interest in
having a 5 minute talk by anyone & everyone on "What I use Linux for".

If everyone at the next meeting (21st April) gave a short talk on how
they use Linux, why they use it, what they've done with it (anything
along those sort of lines), it should end up being a really
interesting meeting.

If you'd like to give a talk (and hopefully that's everyone; even if
you don't think you're a good public speaker, it doesn't need to be
overly fancy or anything), could you please contact me privately
(<A HREF="mailto:geoffrey@netcraft.com.au">geoffrey@netcraft.com.au</A>) so I can keep track of how many people will
be speaking.

Although it'd be good for people to be able to do demos, 30 people
all bringing their computer would probably cause chaos.  How about if
people emailed me screenshots which could be shown all from the one
computer?
