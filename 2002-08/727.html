Really what you want is not just the one Perl book but the 6 perl books on
CD from O'Rielly
I have one and find it invaluable.

&gt; &gt; IMHO if you have a machine with perl installed
&gt; &gt; why do you need to carry around a book when they seem to
&gt; &gt; just be based on the perldoc material anyway, with
&gt; &gt; a few exceptions.
&gt;
&gt; Books are easier to read for people who don't have laptops
&gt; and 21" Sony
&gt; Trinitron monitors :-)

Yep I have several books on perl at home - actually I might
have given them away not sure.  Agreed anyway. These days I
don't use them at all as I prefer perldoc.  But I do realise
that other people prefer books - easier to look at several
pages at once with books.  I do strongly suggest that people
have a look at perldoc first as they may decide that they
don't need a book.  I am sure that most people have a better
way of spending $50-$80 if they don't need to - Coopers
Pale Ale springs to mind pretty quickly :-)

Apologies if I offended anyone
