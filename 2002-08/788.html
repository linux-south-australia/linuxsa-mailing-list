Yeah! Anarchy! :)
 
&gt; Eventually we'll move onto a new format, such as Ogg, but unfortunately it'll
&gt; face competition from other 'secure' formats that the RIAA and so on will be
&gt; pushing. Hardware devices might be purely WMA and SDMI?

I'll have to stay mp3, as I have one of those cheap hardware mp3 cd
diskmans. It works a treat, but has a bad signal to noise ratio. It wont
play oggs though :(

&gt; Out of interest, how does LAME get away without paying the encoder fee? Is it
&gt; because it's done using a new implementaton that isn't patented? Or something
&gt; else? (Sorry, its probably in a FAQ if i went looking)

Primarily non-us project. This is why you wont find binarys of it in
most distros.... The official binary sites are all hosted in countrys
where its OK. I just checked, at the moment the binary link goes to a
site in .au!

&gt; If LAME didn't have to pay the patent royalties, then perhaps some of the free
&gt; decoders (eg. mpg321, mad) won't have to either?

Yeah, depends where you are. I've emailed <A HREF="mailto:info@mp3licensing.com">info@mp3licensing.com</A> and
asked for a definitive answer. I'll post back to the list if I get a
reply. I asked if there was a non-for profit/open source software
decoder clause.

I dare say they were planning this all along, and were just waiting for
mp3 to become a popular enough format they thought they could pull it
off. 

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mp3licensing.com/licensees/index.asp&gt">http://www.mp3licensing.com/licensees/index.asp&gt</A>;

I dare say you'll find a lot of hardware and software around that isnt
on this list. Ive never heard of a bust, they seem to be currently
turning a blind eye to people who arnt conforming and are just going
after those who will. They probably dont want bad publicity and have
obviously been successfull enough so far... Hmmm AOL allready are listed
(someone said winamp?) as well as nullsoft..

If anyone is interested there is a good article on the legalitys here:
