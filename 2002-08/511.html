Hello,

I have a system in my possession at the moment which has a Gigabyte
motherboard with onboard Promise RAID.  As far as I have been able to
determine, Promise RAID controllers are not supported under FreeBSD, so
I disabled the RAID controller and set its two hard drives back to IDE.

Upon trying to install FreeBSD 4.6.2 via installation floppies, FreeBSD
could see the two hard disk drives perfectly well, and allowed me to
partition them accordingly.  I tried using a manual configuration at
first, followed in subsequent attempts by "Autodefaults" just to make
sure everything was okay.  The installation continued after this point
and the system rebooted.

After rebooting, the system boots and the FreeBSD bootloader appears.
If I select [F1] to boot FreeBSD, the computer beeps and does nothing.
If I press it again, it does the same thing over and over.

I tried an installation several times, and once going back to BSD 4.3 on
a CD-ROM just to make sure it wasn't a problem I was experiencing with
version 4.6.2.

Another option I tried was partitioning the disk and installing no
bootloader, but upon booting the system at that point I get "Missing
Operating System".

I tested using a non-FreeBSD OS, Windows 2000, which installed perfectly
seeing two individual IDE disks.  Red Hat 7.3 also installed flawlessly.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I might try next?
