&gt;It's probably time to ask yourself why you got into an rpm battle in the
&gt;first place. I suggest it is because you haven't installed an 'rpm battle
&gt;manager', ie apt. Most users simply don't want to know about these
&gt;details, and I find that programs are much better at managing package
&gt;dependencies than most people. Not all people, but most.

Thanks for the advice - I will pursue apt after I upgrade to RH7.3 (I'm
waiting for the disks to come in the post) -

Hopeful this will help me keep some hair - I'm certainly determined not to
go over to "the dark side" - linux has too many pluses for that and the
kids would spew - even if they could get their Mindstorms stuff* working on
the native platform.

You may be interested to know that the reason why I havn't looked at apt
yet is that we didn't have a modem for the linux box until a few days ago.
That is how "desktop" our system is. To download stuff we have been using
an iMac and atalking it onto the linux box - a pain and a dead cert for
hair loss!! Even so, at least (thanks to this mail group) I knew not to buy
an internal modem.

*PS	You can get a cut down C compiler for lego Mindstorms called NQC.
Its cool. It runs on linux and can communicate with the IR tower via serial
port. I've been able to teach the kids (10 and 12) C and emacs this way.
