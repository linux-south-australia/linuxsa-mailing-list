David,

&gt; Seriously, if they suddenly refuse to do a MOLDS test I'll be
&gt; off to the TIO and seeing they probably get so many complaints it will
&gt; probably cost them money.
&gt;

Now your experience is so different to mine. &lt;Sigh&gt;

If they wont generate a fault call on the line then it won't go through 
to the Techs who do the MOLDS. The initial responder cant do any decent 
sort of test on your line from his/her terminal. That is why they have 
the techs there.

The rest of their questions are just furphies to the real problem, 
Telstra's copper is more than likely crap and they won't admit to it. In 
our case the whole block in question is affected by the pair-gain 
problem yet around the block can expect to get a clean 49 connect. Is 
there any chance of fixing the pair-gain problem? Just after they detect 
snow in Rundle Mall ... In January.

As has been seen in the "AirNet Troubles", Telstra's decisions and 
responses can affect thousands of consumers and big businesses and they 
just don't seem to get it that they could probably have been at fault.

Just personally I don't think putting Telstra into full ownership would 
do anything other than putting Australia into a negative communications 
spiral as they will then do what all privatised corporations have done, 
dropped what services they had and just do the easy stuff but make sure 
that in every way possible the user gets the shaft. 

Hey come to think of it, would we notice any real difference?

Cheers,  Ian
