&gt; apt-get install.  Yep, go and install XYZ and it's dependencies.  What if
&gt; something breaks?  What if there _is_ a problem?  It may be a FANTASTIC
&gt; solution for a home computer, but if the machine is a production machine I
&gt; don't want to have to unroll a bunch of changes that I didn't want made.

thats why you wouldnt use testing - you would use stable...that means stable, 
tested, and none of the problesm you outline..

one of the reasons i moved from redhat to debian is the sheer joy of installs, 
compared to the dependency crap of redhat - goddess it used to irritate me!

&gt; RPM isn't perfect, and you do need to RTFM to know how to resolve
&gt; dependencies, but it gives you plenty of control over what you're
&gt; installing, it allows you to have verified signed packages, and (from my
&gt; experience) is as good as anything else if you know what you're doing.

but the point is that with apt-get, the learning curve is so much less!!

alien *.rpm - turn them into debs. lovely:)

&gt; Stable is stable.  It's also typically ancient.  Ok, use testing, but wait,
&gt; it's not as stable as stable then...

foo, i use unstable - which it isnt, and has never caused me any problems. i 
agree, it takes long time between distros, but the advantages outweigh minor 
irritations - testing is the best middle ground:)

&gt; The new installer is supposedly nice, but not as nice as the commercial
&gt; distros.  As you say, installation should only be a minor point for any
&gt; Linux distro as you shouldn't need to do it often (which is a good thing
&gt; for debian :)

it is - and tis easy:)))

&gt; I've tried Debian, and I'm sticking with Red Hat :)

one day, you'll get better;)))
never &lt;/fanaticism&gt; - wheres the fun in that?
;)

&gt; P.S. troll troll troll your list, gently down the stream...

you would;)
