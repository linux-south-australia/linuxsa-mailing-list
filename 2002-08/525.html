&gt; But what about, for example if you have a primary name server for serveral
&gt; domains, now correct me if I am wrong but aren't the registry records hard
&gt; coded by IP address for the primary and secondary name servers...

An interesting problem, but you'll notice that all current domains use
hostnames for NS records, so the IP address isn't directly related to
delegation. With sufficiently available and robust methods for dynamic
DNS (with roots and tld servers statically configured), your domain
hosting can still work fine.

A dynamic DNS hierarchy also makes the whole topological seperation of
secondary nameservers thing more important.

&gt; So if someone shifts a name server from one ISP to another that means that
&gt; they have to go though and change all the name servers for all the domains
&gt; with the registry, whereas if one could take the IP address range to the new
&gt; ISP, then it would make everyone's life much simpler, because the only thing
&gt; which would have to be changed is routing for the address range.

That's mostly what happens now, except for the priviledged few that have
portable address space of their own.

The need for a scalable and efficient global Internet outweighs the need
for the end user conveniences made available by static IP addressing :)
