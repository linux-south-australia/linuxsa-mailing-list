Haven't seen any tutorials, but there's plenty of documentation around. Whether it's simple enough, I don't know. Here's a quick list:

  <A HREF="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/index.html">http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/index.html</A> (network concepts HOWTO)
  /usr/share/doc/iproute*/*.ps (command line reference)
  <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/index.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/index.html</A>

If these aren't what you're looking for, there is a book published by SAMS (but it's still a good book) called "Linux Policy Routing" or "Policy Routing with Linux" or something. It's not a big book, but it does do quite indepth into iproute2 and policy routing.

&gt; having trouble getting my two linux(7.3) boxes talking to one another
&gt; and it seems that it is a routing problem (viz "no route to host"

If there's only two machines involved, they would/should be on the same subnet, so you probably wouldn't need to worry about iproute2. Check the IP addresses and subnet masks on both machines and make sure that they're on the same subnet.

If you want to be more precise about the problem, I'm sure someone would be able to help you with this.

thx,
Matt
