Quoting Pigeon &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jah.pigeon@ukonline.co.uk">jah.pigeon@ukonline.co.uk</A>&gt;:

&gt; May I take a few minutes of someone's time to ask for a couple of hints?
&gt; I have installed the Debian distro (a couple of years old) and it boots
&gt; horrendously slowly.
&gt; Everything runs smoothly until round about the time it fscks the root. Then
&gt; it sits and does nothing for ages (hard drive light OFF). Finally it gets
&gt; going again and everything works fine; it just took ages to get there.
&gt; Since (a) I switch the machine off when I'm not using it and (b) it is a
&gt; triple-boot Linux/Win98/DOS machine, I can't leave it running to get round
&gt; this. It means that I tend not to use Linux if I can use Win98 instead
&gt; (HORROR!!!)
&gt; I don't think the problem is actually anything to do with fscking the root,
&gt; cos the HD light is off; it just happens round about that time. What I
&gt; _think_ is up, is that the machine is trying to locate external network
&gt; stuff and not finding any (because there isn't any). (I don't use Linux for
&gt; internetting because I connect via a mobile phone and there are no Linux
&gt; drivers for it.)

It /could/ be IDE bus problems. I've seen a few cases (although on machines 
much older than the one you described) where Linux will attempt read/writes 
using DMA, fail in some way, and then revert to PIO or reset the bus. This 
process usually takes a fair amount of time (30 seconds or so). Check 
your 'dmesg' after boot for messages relating to DMA problems.

The machine won't even touch the network until its initialised its network 
interfaces, which won't happen until the rc scripts are read, which won't 
happen until the filesystems have been checked. A different scenario applies 
for network boot machines, of course.
