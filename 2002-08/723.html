Hi Dave (and All),
    Thanks for your reply. I don't think that the problem
with this is the newindex.html file. You should be able to
view ANY html file as long as you tell apache where to look.
If I put the same file into the root apache directory and
call it up using www.server.com.au/newindex.html it works.
The problem seems to be accessing the file through the
subdirectory hanging off this apache root directory. I have
tried moving the default index.html from the apache distro
into this directory and it doesn't work either. So the
problem seems to be looking past the subdirectory. The
subdirectory has "read by all" permissions so it _should_
work, but so far it doesn't. I am not sure if changing the
permissions to "execute by all" will make a difference (as
Martin on this list suggested) but I will try it anyway.
Keep thinking as this must be something trivial I have
missed, but after some fairly heavy research I still haven't
solved it. Thanks for your help.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; Taking what you you have said literally.....
&gt; try renaming the file from "newindex.html" to just
&gt; "index.html".
&gt;
&gt; check out the directives for the default page to be
&gt; displayed.
&gt;
&gt; cheers.....

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;     I am having a few problems getting apache to run a
set
&gt; &gt; of pages and I am not sure exactly why (this is the
first
&gt; &gt; time I have tried to do this and yes I have RTFMed). The
&gt; &gt; error I get is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "403 Forbidden
&gt; &gt; You don't have permission to access
/directory/newindex.html
&gt; &gt; on this server.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Apache/1.3.12 Server at xxx.yyy.com.au Port 80"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The server runs RH7.0 from the Linux Pocketbook 3rd Ed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The /directory/ is hanging off /var/www/html/ and is
owned
&gt; &gt; by a valid user of the system and has permissions of
&gt; &gt; drw-r--r-- and all files within this directory have
similar
&gt; &gt; permissions (without the directory one of course). The
file
&gt; &gt; newindex.html works fine if I put it in /var/www/html/
which
&gt; &gt; is the root directory for apache 1.3.12 and I call it up
by
&gt; &gt; www.server/newindex.html so the permissions are correct
for
&gt; &gt; the file, but I don't understand why I cannot access it
when
&gt; &gt; I put it into the subdirectory. There is nothing
specific I
&gt; &gt; can see in the apache config file I need to change and
&gt; &gt; nothing in the FM (as in RTFM) that gives a clue either.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     What I am trying to achieve is to set up a virtual
&gt; &gt; server based on this directory when I get it to work,
and
&gt; &gt; this seems straight forward to do from the FM and the
config
&gt; &gt; file. Your help would be appreciated.
&gt; &gt;     Thanks,
&gt; &gt;         Andrew.
