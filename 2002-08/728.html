&gt;     Thanks for your reply. I don't think that the problem
&gt; with this is the newindex.html file. You should be able to
&gt; view ANY html file as long as you tell apache where to look.
&gt; If I put the same file into the root apache directory and
&gt; call it up using www.server.com.au/newindex.html it works.
&gt; The problem seems to be accessing the file through the
&gt; subdirectory hanging off this apache root directory. I have
&gt; tried moving the default index.html from the apache distro
&gt; into this directory and it doesn't work either. So the
&gt; problem seems to be looking past the subdirectory. The
&gt; subdirectory has "read by all" permissions so it _should_
&gt; work, but so far it doesn't. I am not sure if changing the
&gt; permissions to "execute by all" will make a difference (as
&gt; Martin on this list suggested) but I will try it anyway.
&gt; Keep thinking as this must be something trivial I have
&gt; missed, but after some fairly heavy research I still haven't
&gt; solved it. Thanks for your help.

change the permissions on the directory!

-------------------------------------------
Permissions on directories

Permissions on directories are different to permissions on files. Here

    * r indicates the contents of the directory can be listed
    * w indicates the contents of the directory can be changed
    * x indicates that users can "cd" to that directory, read, write and
      execute programs in the directory. 
-------------------------------------------

apache can't read any files from the directory until the execute bit is
set....
