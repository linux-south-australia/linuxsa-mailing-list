Hi Shane,

I've been fiddling with these kind of things lately.
Admitedly my disk is slightly larger, at 80 Gb, but its not really key-chain
material either at around half a kilo. :)

The ease of use of the device varies, depending on the age of your
installation and what configuration the kernel and USB stuff was setup as.

On some distros you shouldn't need to do anything more than just plug the
little guy into the port, and then fdisk /dev/sda. (or /dev/scsi/.../disc if
you're on devfs)

Assuming this isn't the case, since you're having trouble, you'll probably
need to download the latest linux kernel, 2.4.19. If that's a big jump up from
what you have now, then there will probably be a few other upgrades required
as well.

When compiling the kernel, you need to enable the usb-storage driver in the
USB section. You *also* have to enable scsi! This caught me out the first time
around. You don't need to compile in any scsi adaptor drivers, but you do need
to enable (probably as a module) the main scsi core, and the scsi disk
support.

If you are using a prebuilt kernel (eg. mandrake, redhat, etc) then they've
probably already included those options by default so you're probably OK.


If you're finding nothing happens when you plug the device in, try manually
loading the appropriate modules.
Eg:
modprobe usb-storage
modprobe sd_mod

type 'dmesg' now should display kernel messages, and hopefully there'll be
something in there now like :
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
usb.c: registered new driver usb-storage
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: ST380021  Model: A                 Rev: 3.19
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
USB Mass Storage device found at 2
USB Mass Storage support registered.
Attached scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
SCSI device sda: 156301488 512-byte hdwr sectors (80026 MB)

If you get the first messages but not the last, then you may need to trigger a
rescan on the scsi bus to get them to appear. However it seems to 'just work'
for me every time, (except on firewire, but thats another driver altogether.)

Once you've reached this stage, you should just be able to use the disc like
you would any other.
Since it's so small, you probably don't want to use fdisk and partitions, so
just create a filesystem directly onto /dev/sda.

I'd reccommend using a lightweight system like cramfs, which is practically
designed for that sort device. Note that it's a ROM FS though, so if you need
writeability, give minix or zisofs a try perhaps. ext2 is better for full
compatibility with Linux permissions etc, or vfat is better for compatibility
with other Windows machines. I don't know how well Windows would handle a
non-partitioned setup though, so you might have to waste space on a partition
table if you really want vfat ;(

Eg:
mkcramfs &lt;source directory&gt; /dev/sda
mount /dev/sda /mnt/portable

or
mkfs.minix /dev/sda

Hope this helps, and let us know how you go,

Toby

&gt; Hi All.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently purchased a 128Mb USB solid state disk.  Neither the box nor the
&gt; device itself carries any markings indicating the manufacturer and so I am
&gt; having difficulties locating drivers.
&gt; 
&gt; The device is about 8-10cm long, 1cm wide and 3/4cm deep.  It is made of a
&gt; dark blue/purple translucent plastic through which I can make out it uses a
&gt; SAMSUNG chip of some description.
&gt; 
&gt; The whole device can be attached to a key chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Any think this sounds familiar and can point me inthe right direction to a
&gt; manufacturers website?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Shane.
