Hey David,

&gt; Hi David,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; would welcome the opportunity to save
&gt;&gt; funds on infrastructure and technology costs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; But how often that welcome is contingent on staying within the MS world
&gt;  &lt;sigh&gt;

If its MS they want runit within Netraverse Win4Lin Terminal Server - we use
it - on the old hardware for the terminals (and a Pentium III 800 for the
server) - works great - some say faster than native Windows on high spec
stand alones. Sound difficult to believe, mail me off-list and you can have
a look at our city office that uses this for clients to write their own
resumes, search the web's Australian Job System for Job Prospects, e-mail
etc.
(We would use a Linux exclusive thin client solution, like I outlined to you
in previous e-mail but our contract with the Commonwealth Govt requires that
we msut use MS! - bit like the Communioty Houses we know.)

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why not suggest a Linux-based thin client solution - you can use
&gt;&gt; 486's/Pentiun 100's (with minimum spec) or thereabouts as the
&gt;&gt; terminals with only one of your high spec machines for the server.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; With latest versions of Redhat or Manduck the systems would run like
&gt; they  were powered by molasses.
&gt;
&gt; I wont demo any Linux on a system not running at least a 400 Pentium.
&gt; The  watchers will simply walk away saying things like "pathetic" etc.
&gt;
Don't think this is so - if you're using Thin Client Terminals (as opposed
to MS networked stand alones) - its the server specs that will largely
determine the 'speed' that the end user sees.

We use Pentiun 100's, 16MB RAM, EtherCards with BootRom as the X-clients and
Pentium 111 800, 512MB RAM for the server and dedicated network 10/100
switch - serves 10 of our Pentium 100 clients - the Windows apps (Office97,
IE etc) run like lightning on the clients and reliability is a dream
compared to MS standalone.

&gt;&gt; perhaps e-mail or you could use Evolution -
&gt;&gt; the Linux clone of Outlook or even install SquirelMail for web-based
&gt;&gt; e-mail
&gt;&gt;
One less thing to deal with!
&gt;
&gt; Wont be ANY emailing. Most of the time this computer suite will be used
&gt; for  teaching basic computer usage to newbies, that is why it has to
&gt; run well and  be user^H^H^H^Hfool proof. Also why it needs to have a
&gt; very good office  suite, even to be able to run MS Office if possible.
&gt;
&gt; What do you think about the CodeWeaver's package?
&gt;
&gt;CodeWeaver's works well I understand - we've never used it but thise who
have seem to think its OK - bit pricey compared to the Win4Lin Terminal
Server  option though.
&gt;
&gt; 10 user licenses are US$500.  That will allow them to keep their Office
&gt; 97  and run it under Linux.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; your software licence fees are NIL.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; If I get Red Hat / Mandrake in boxes I get the printed documentation
&gt; which  makes it easier to train others to maintain the system.
&gt;
True - but have you checked the documentation - might be better to look at
Linux for Dummies type options for newbies - when I started it helped me out
heaps!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the suggestions.
&gt;
Mail me if you want to see what we've done - think you'll see it was worth a
look.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, Ian

Best,
David
