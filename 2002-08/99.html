I am using Version 2.2.3a-64 for both server & client- VMware running on Suse 
8.0. I enclose some results of testparm that I don't understand and a longish
Smb.conf file. I have made a couple of small changes to this. An alteration to 
the TCP_NODELAY line and introduced the 40GB share.

Brian Marr
=================================

Testparm is showing......
 browseable = Yes
        blocking locks = Yes
        fake oplocks = No
        locking = Yes
        oplocks = Yes
        level2 oplocks = Yes
        oplock contention limit = 2
        posix locking = Yes
        strict locking = No
        share modes = Yes
=================================

# /etc/samba/smb.conf ist the main samba configuration file. Cf. the
# manual page of smb.conf and the included documantation in
# /usr/share/doc/packages/samba in order to understand the options
# listed here and many more features.
#
# Lines in this example which starts with ; and # are ignored comment
# ones. # indicates a comment and ; a deactivated example line.
