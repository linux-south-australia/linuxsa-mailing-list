Quoting Barney Wrightson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:barney.wrightson@dsto.defence.gov.au">barney.wrightson@dsto.defence.gov.au</A>&gt;:

At the risk of sounding like a RedHat-bigot, can I suggest staying with what 
you've got, and using this as a learning experience?  You'll find that every 
distro/open-source OS simply has a different set of problems.

&gt; At the risk of sounding like a fanatic, I would suggest installing
&gt; debian rather than redhat. Why?
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;fanaticism&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; - no dependency problems, if you apt-get install &lt;package&gt;, it will
&gt; install all required dependencies automatically. This is a policy
&gt; requirement in Debian for any package in stable or testing.

apt-get install.  Yep, go and install XYZ and it's dependencies.  What if 
something breaks?  What if there _is_ a problem?  It may be a FANTASTIC 
solution for a home computer, but if the machine is a production machine I 
don't want to have to unroll a bunch of changes that I didn't want made.

RPM isn't perfect, and you do need to RTFM to know how to resolve dependencies, 
but it gives you plenty of control over what you're installing, it allows you 
to have verified signed packages, and (from my experience) is as good as 
anything else if you know what you're doing.

&gt; - It is maintained / created by volunteers, and stays as true as
&gt; possible to open source ideals.

All of Red Hat Linux is GPL.  Nothing wrong about that.  Go and see how many 
hackers Red Hat fund to continue their work.  It's a lot.  I don't thing RH 
have anything to answer on this point.
 
&gt; - The stable version is STABLE. Currently this also means reasonably up
&gt; to date as v3.0 (woody) has recently gone stable. If you want a more up
&gt; to date desktop system, testing is stable enough (comparable to other
&gt; distro numbered releases but in more of a state of flux) the only
&gt; problem being that if you don't update often enough you end up with too
&gt; much to download...

Stable is stable.  It's also typically ancient.  Ok, use testing, but wait, 
it's not as stable as stable then...  

I don't see this as being a debian advantage.  Stable only gets released every 
24 months or so.  Too long if you want something stable *and* recent (except 
for the 3 months after stable gets released :)
 
&gt; Don't be scared by rumors of installing problems - it isn't that bad,
&gt; and once it is on you should never have to install again - thanks to the
&gt; effectiveness of the upgrading system.

The new installer is supposedly nice, but not as nice as the commercial 
distros.  As you say, installation should only be a minor point for any Linux 
distro as you shouldn't need to do it often (which is a good thing for debian :)
 
&gt; &lt;/fanaticism&gt;

I've tried Debian, and I'm sticking with Red Hat :)

&lt;/fanaticism&gt;

Michael...

P.S. troll troll troll your list, gently down the stream...
