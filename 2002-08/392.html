Yes, you have to pay fir Lindows, and you get access to a heap of other 
software in the process.

I am told that Lindows participate in the OpenSource movement as well. 
Your argument doesn't change any of the need to support them against MS 
in this case. This is not a call to "MS bashers unite", it is a call 
for those that believe in OpenSource to band together to support one of 
their kind.

They are still the Davids and easily seen to be in this situation. 
Goliath Software have tried to show that the name "Windows" is a 
trademark and nobody has the right to it. If this goes down then expect 
to see anything with a "window" name to be targeted for closure and 
payback.

Do you think it is right that MS can push the system around to 
trademark a word in common use? Do you think that the fight over the 
trademark has nothing to do with the fact that Lindows.com have come up 
with potentially a viable alternative to MS and the potential to siphon 
off some of their monopoly?

I can recall windows being used in early days and in many different 
ways and I hope I can put something together that just might help these 
guys. I hope that others of the older school might also be able to 
assist them with this research. I just hate to think how insufferable 
Bill Co will be if they can win this one and push Lindows and 
OpenSource back a few years.

Cheers,  Ian
