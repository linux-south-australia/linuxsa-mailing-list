They won't. Hence the need for more distros aimed at the entry-level
Windows fugitive. I aren't aware of any really comprehensive solutions.
Xandros in Canada has taken on Corel's distro, which is Debian with some
extras (hopefully the code forks Corel introduced have been reversed.)
Lindows is trying hard to make an entry-level product also based on Debian
with some bits from Corel as well.

I've not seen it. Mandrake have enabled their archives for apt but they
also invest in urpmi.

This is where more than ever the value is not in the tool but in the
processes used to create the packages. Notice that the current crop of
distros target at the most two architectures (IA32 and 64) except Debian
which does this across eleven architectures. Check what I say: SuSE,
RedHat, Mandrake, Conectiva - all of their non-Intel architectures are
either dropped or at least one version behind. I've been told informally
by some of these companies that one of the big reasons for this is the
expense and difficulty of developing and testing security patches for
multiple architectures.

&gt; I haven't tried to roll back with either apt or urpmi, but I have a lot
&gt; less faith in urpmi than apt. It's just been a bit too 'beta' in my
&gt; experience.

Rolling back with apt is something I'd want to do fairly soon after an
upgrade if I had to. Still, the fact that you can do it at all is very
impressive. You pin the version for packages to be the previous release
and then go "apt-get dist-upgrade". See the apt HOWTO.
