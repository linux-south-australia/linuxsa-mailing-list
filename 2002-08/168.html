As a long time user of Debian (since 1999-ish), I disagree with some of these 
points:

&gt; - no dependency problems, if you apt-get install &lt;package&gt;, it will
&gt; install all required dependencies automatically. This is a policy
&gt; requirement in Debian for any package in stable or testing.

Mostly true, yes, and the primary reason I still use Debian. Making the 
migration to FreeBSD RSN, though.

&gt; - It is maintained / created by volunteers, and stays as true as
&gt; possible to open source ideals.

That's not always a good thing. Debian only included KDE a couple of releases 
ago, after much internal licensing wrangling. It still doesn't include a Java 
SDK more recent than 1.1. The idea of running a 'pure' system doesn't really 
appeal to me, and reeks of fanaticism. 

Also, many packages take a while to make it to even the 'unstable' branch in 
any workable form, as their maintainers are busy with their real jobs. IIRC, 
XFree86 v4 took about 4 or 5 months to make it to unstable. I'm not sure when 
it made it to stable, and I don't think testing was around back then.

When they do, there'll sometimes be a dependency messup caused by poor 
communication between package maintainers. Of course, these problems will be 
fixed by the time that the package reaches the stable or testing branch, 
thankfully.

&gt; - The stable version is STABLE. Currently this also means reasonably up
&gt; to date as v3.0 (woody) has recently gone stable. If you want a more up
&gt; to date desktop system, testing is stable enough (comparable to other
&gt; distro numbered releases but in more of a state of flux) the only
&gt; problem being that if you don't update often enough you end up with too
&gt; much to download...

stable becomes stale /very/ quickly. I usually run my system at 'testing', 
also. Everything that I care about I usually need to compile from source or 
install myself, anyway (mysql, postgresql, java, apache, etc).

&gt; Don't be scared by rumors of installing problems - it isn't that bad,
&gt; and once it is on you should never have to install again - thanks to the
&gt; effectiveness of the upgrading system.

True, also. Debian's installer isn't as bad as its detractors make it out to 
be, but having a good knowledge of how Linux systems work helps.
