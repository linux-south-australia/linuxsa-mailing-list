Romana and Ryan,

Fine to feel that way but that isn't the point behind the suggestion.

They are an OpenSource 'friend'. They are introducing a world of 
people, who probably would blindly continue to stumble down the MS 
path, to the world of OpenSource and sooner or later these people will 
learn enough to take advantage of what we know is available to them. 
How can that be bad?

The point is that the Lindows people are under attack from an enemy who 
is quite certain that suffocating them under legalese and red tape may 
well bring them to their knees and out of the way. The Lindows people 
honestly need the help of all who recall those times and can provide 
feedback so the Lindows people can defend their patch of OpenSource 
ground, however they may define it.

If we are to believe that OpenSource can take many forms (Debian, SuSE, 
Red Hat, Mandrake, distros ad infinitum) then we have to also believe 
that supporting their defence is also supporting our belief in the 
rightness of OpenSource.

Let's not get into a pissing contest about how they do business, it 
isn't important, that stuff can get sorted out later if they do 
survive. Lets lend them a hand and show just how strong and resolute 
the OpenSource movement can be.

&lt;/Soapbox off&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
