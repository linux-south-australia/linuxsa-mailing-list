&gt; 
&gt; &gt; IMHO if you have a machine with perl installed
&gt; &gt; why do you need to carry around a book when they seem to
&gt; &gt; just be based on the perldoc material anyway, with
&gt; &gt; a few exceptions.
&gt; 
&gt; Books are easier to read for people who don't have laptops 
&gt; and 21" Sony
&gt; Trinitron monitors :-)

Yep I have several books on perl at home - actually I might 
have given them away not sure.  Agreed anyway. These days I 
don't use them at all as I prefer perldoc.  But I do realise 
that other people prefer books - easier to look at several 
pages at once with books.  I do strongly suggest that people 
have a look at perldoc first as they may decide that they 
don't need a book.  I am sure that most people have a better 
way of spending $50-$80 if they don't need to - Coopers 
Pale Ale springs to mind pretty quickly :-)

Apologies if I offended anyone
