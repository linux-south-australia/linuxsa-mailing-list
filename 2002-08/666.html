Thanks nik,
     But....
         My problem is not with the Java, but rather with the file it's
trying to read. The java program runs well but cannot connect to the
database. I've, through a little "Reverse engineering" of my own
discovered that the jdbc-odbc  driver cannot connect and therefor cannot
find the required Database. (I'm not supposed to tinker with the java
side of this )

In MS you need to set the database engine to utilise ODBC through the
Settings | Control Panel | ODBC driver setup and address the particular
file (ie blabla.mdb) with the ODBC driver.

Reading further I've been able to set up a MySQL odbc dbase from scratch
that it can connect to but cannot find the right tables. Using a text
editor I have now found the tables and field names from the mdb file,
though the field type and settings especially the keys between tables
still evade me in the code. but I'm blowed if I'm going to reconstruct
the  db and all this info into mysql.

What I'd like to do is either import it to mysql or set up the odbc
driver so that the java program can access it.

dcd
(I'd really hate to have to install ms just for this, though I have
wondered about installing msaccess just to transfer the db but I'm not
sure if that would actually fix the odbc problem)

ps the reason I have the files, is to fix some sql queries that someone
"accidently" removed from fields in the java program. So I probably need
to be able to view the tables etc. to check I'm obtaining the correct
data.

 &gt; not exactly sure what you want from your posting but here goes anyway;
 &gt;
 &gt; can you not just install the Java2 runtime environment so you can run
 &gt; the program which views the .m$db  files? (the J2RE should suffice
 &gt; unless you are developing in java (in which case you would already
 &gt; know this):)
 &gt;
 &gt; you can get it from here;
 &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html&gt">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html&gt</A>;
 &gt; I am not sure if mandrake uses redhat rpms, but I would try them anyway
 &gt;
 &gt; oherwise, can you not export the data to another decent format
 &gt; (anything but MDB!!) and maybe use a mysql/postgresql backend with
 &gt; maybe a php/jsp interface?
 &gt;
 &gt; or do both and have the best of both worlds even!
 &gt;
 &gt; cheers

 &gt;&gt; My "current" Problem,
 &gt;&gt;      I have been given a msaccess db  blabla.mdb and a java program
 &gt;&gt; that they normally use to read it.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; What I have worked out is that the java uses the jdbc-obdc interface
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; What I can't seem to find the answer for is setting up the blabla.mdb
 &gt;&gt; to be read as a odbc database in linux.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; No, I haven't had much to do with Databases on linux
 &gt;&gt; Yes I know how to set this up in Windows but I'm rather loathe to
 &gt;&gt; setup windows just for this if there is another way
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; What have I done so far,
 &gt;&gt; Read a fair bit of the mysql stuff, as it's on my mandrake system. So
 &gt;&gt; I think I could probably set up a new Database
 &gt;&gt; but I seem to have missed the relevant points to setup an existing
 &gt;&gt; Database for odbc.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Any help greatly appreciated
