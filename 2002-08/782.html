&gt;&gt;Speaking of which, does anyone have any reccomendations for decent (i.e. 
&gt;&gt;Linux, FreeBSD and MacOSX compatible), portable, USB/Firewire hard disk 
&gt;&gt;enclosures that can accept a standard 3.5" hard disk? I'd prefer one 
&gt;&gt;that looks sexxy, as well. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking at the same thing too, so I can carry around my mp3
&gt; collection with me.  Only ones I've seen were *heavy* as though.

Yeah, that why I want one. I have seen a few portable ones, but they all 
seem to use either built-in notebook hard drives or built-in 3.5" 
drives, neither of which really appeal to me.

These guys &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lacie.com.au/&gt">http://www.lacie.com.au/&gt</A>; have some offerings, a few of 
which look pretty cool, but they all seem to come with drives in the 
cases. Skymaster &lt;<A HREF="http://www.skymaster.com.tw/&gt">http://www.skymaster.com.tw/&gt</A>; do some portable 
enclosures which don't come with a drive already installed, but don't 
look all that great.

&gt; The problem is finding a filesystem that all three OS's can read (in my
&gt; case, Windows too).  It'd be nice if OS X could read FAT32 :(

Doesn't it? Have a look at the manpage for "mount_msdos" from a 
terminal. I don't know if it would work from the GUI, but you might be 
able to get around it using the command line.
