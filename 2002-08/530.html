I saw this today.

On Lindows....

Ok, I didn't speak up a few days ago when Lindows was the topic because 
I was trying to figure out how our program could print.

But I guess I have to say something...mostly as a Linux on the desktop 
user...and secondly as a Lindows customer.

The main reason why I bought Lindows was because I wanted to help fund 
Wine. In effect, this is one way I can pay my "taxes" so to speak.

I guess most of us have heard of the "Windows Tax" and in effect, most 
everybody that has ever bought a computer were given a choice: give 
Microsoft a fair amount of money, or do without a PC.  What this has 
amounted to, is taxation on a mass scale to rival some countries - 
countries that build roads & other types of infrastructure.

And when we talk about operating systems and the applications that run 
in them, we are talking about a different form of infrastructure, 
software infrastructure.

Last time I checked, most everybody has to pay someone money to put food 
on the table, etc.

So if gratis software is going to succeed, one of the following must 
hold true:

a.) The cost of developing the gratis software is less than the savings 
realized.

or

b.) the additional cost of developing it is not painful enough to be 
noticed on an individual level. (This is what Microsoft does, and they 
now have Billions of dollars in the bank.)

c.) The public funds and pays for software development through 
government or charity.

What makes me cross is that some companies out there, like Lindows, are 
trying to sell overpriced services that no one wants, unless they are 
ignorant. They make these sales to make up for their underfunded 
development costs. From my point of view, "click and run" is something 
you sell to the conned.

At the other extreme, there are public service organizations that are 
being run as if they were businesses.  Using Red Hat as an example, 
their financial statements state that, in effect, they have collected 
around $625,000,000 from investors, but have had costs that exceeded 
income by $300,000,000 since its inception. Furthermore, you don't have 
to give them anything to get their product. A sale of Red Hat's software 
meets the accounting definition of a donation.

Most of the money came into the company when it sold its own stock when 
the NASDAQ was booming. So basically what this means to me is that the 
technology behind Red Hat was mostly paid for by people that did not use it.

Sounds like a public charity to me. However, public charities cannot be 
forced into bankruptcy.

So, from my point of view, I am willing to pay an extra $50 of "tax" a 
boxed set, just so that Red Hat can pay for itself. Furthermore, I feel 
that if I can't give something back to the people that made software 
that I use, than I don't feel that I ought to use it. Because sooner or 
later, it will go away, unless something, somewhere is funding it, so 
that the developers can eat and sleep comfortably. I also have no 
problem donating to any of the groups out there.

Ok, I am done philosophisinig. I need to hurry up and download a bunch 
of Red Hat disk images, burn hundreds of CD's and give them all away for 
gratis in front of a very large computer software store that sells a 
significant number of Red Hat boxed sets.
;-)
