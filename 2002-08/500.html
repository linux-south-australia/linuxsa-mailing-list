So then my burning question would be, when the time comes, how much is going
to be charged for the smallest subnet from say APNIC, because if its still
$1250 (for membership and the ability to get a /35) like it is for IPv4,
thats way out of reach for a lot of people, but then you say well get them
from your provider, but then I say, my provider won't let me take them with
me or multihome with addresses I get from them, so I want my own...

With that many addresses do they really need to charge so much for people to
be able to obtain addresses? (I do realise they are not-for-profit, but that
still seems steep)

Why can't it be more like Domain names? if I want to register a domain name,
I can, then I can take that domain and do with as I please... and its not
going to burn a hole in my pocket, even before deregulation com.au domains
were $125 for 2 years that was half reasonable.

With IPv6 having so many addresses shouldn't we be able to do similar?
albiet with reasonable restrictions. Like restrictions on the amount per
person...


Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; I'd say the killer app is having a publically accessable IP address for
&gt; &gt; all of your hosts - no more NAT.
&gt;
&gt; Each subnet, including dialups, gets 16,000 addresses.
&gt;
&gt; The important point being that there is no longer an
&gt; address shortage, so you can think of addresses in
&gt; different ways.
&gt;
&gt; For example, there's enough address space for an allocation
&gt; for every meter on earth.  Packets for that address allocation
&gt; can be routed by GPS coordinates.  This solves a whole stack
&gt; of otherwise-tricky problems, especially for remote locations
&gt; and mobility applications.
