not exactly sure what you want from your posting but here goes anyway;

can you not just install the Java2 runtime environment so you can run 
the program which views the .m$db  files? (the J2RE should suffice 
unless you are developing in java (in which case you would already know 
this):)

you can get it from here;
&lt;<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html&gt">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html&gt</A>;
I am not sure if mandrake uses redhat rpms, but I would try them anyway

oherwise, can you not export the data to another decent format (anything 
but MDB!!) and maybe use a mysql/postgresql backend with maybe a php/jsp 
interface?

or do both and have the best of both worlds even!

&gt; My "current" Problem,
&gt;      I have been given a msaccess db  blabla.mdb and a java program that 
&gt; they normally use to read it.
&gt; 
&gt; What I have worked out is that the java uses the jdbc-obdc interface
&gt; 
&gt; What I can't seem to find the answer for is setting up the blabla.mdb to 
&gt; be read as a odbc database in linux.
&gt; 
&gt; No, I haven't had much to do with Databases on linux
&gt; Yes I know how to set this up in Windows but I'm rather loathe to setup 
&gt; windows just for this if there is another way
&gt; 
&gt; What have I done so far,
&gt; Read a fair bit of the mysql stuff, as it's on my mandrake system. So I 
&gt; think I could probably set up a new Database
&gt; but I seem to have missed the relevant points to setup an existing 
&gt; Database for odbc.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help greatly appreciated
