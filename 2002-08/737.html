&lt;snip&gt;

 &gt; P.S. Why do people insist on sending duplicate emails via CC: when it's
 &gt; obvious we are all subscribed to this mailing list anyway? As if there
 &gt; isn't enough spam already?
 &gt; -
 &gt; Davis's Dictum:
 &gt; 	Problems that go away by themselves, come back by themselves.
 &gt;

It's probably because by default reply-to is to the sender and not the
list, I rememeber a debate about this on the debian-user list a while 
ago (which I have been spamming because I entered the wrong list in the 
to field when I orignally sent this message - another good reson to set 
the to field to the list..), but I can't remember why it was decided 
that this is a "Good Thing".
I would have thought, if the policy was to reply to the list only 
(unless asked) then that hitting reply should give you this behaviour by 
default. &lt;shrugs&gt;
