&gt;AIT's a killer, mate. The media's supposed to last a great deal longer
&gt;too -- 30,000 end-to-end passes is what Sony is claiming on the
&gt;35/91GB tapes. I'm yet to rack up anything near 30,000 end-to-end
&gt;passes, but I'm very happy so far.
&gt;
&gt;The tape reliability seems to be pretty good. Compatibility didn't
&gt;seem to be an issue whatsoever -- it just worked :-)

Ok, anyone out there who is unhappy with their AIT drive? ;)

So far have had 100% positive feedback, maybe Sony did something right,
we had nothing but trouble with their 4/8 DAT drives so was testing the
water a bit with everyone's opinions on their AIT, at this stage the 
decision is the SDX400C, will keep the post happening once we get 
the server in the office to play with.


&gt;Amanda is pretty good, but then you might want to consider how that's
&gt;going to work in with the current backup infrastructure. If it's just
&gt;a stand-alone box, tar is as good as any. I'm sure you don't need to
&gt;be told that there are a few factors in a choosing backup system :-)

We're using Arcserve pretty much across the board, NT & Linux, and using
the client agent for those sites with mixed environments.

At this stage we're hoping to stick with it, presuming someone signs the
cheque for a couple Gs of course, the same couple Gs they'll be saving by
not going with W2Krap and CALs....................
