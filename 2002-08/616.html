&gt; You may be lucky enough to find a bank of DIP switches on the printer

&gt; settings.
&gt; 

No LCD display, No buttons, Nothing

&gt; Otherwise, a lot of serial devices seem to want no parity, 8 bit data, 1
&gt; stop bit: try these settings and ring the changes on the baud rate till
&gt; something works!
&gt; 
It does print out a list of fonts and some interface information if I 
change the emulation setting via a wheel on the side of the printer:
9600 baud, parity ignored

&gt; Also try google searching for lists of connectors, pinouts etc. in case
&gt; you need to make up a cable! There are lots of them and they mostly tell
&gt; you a fair bit about RS232 in the process.

Shouldn't it just use a standard serial cable?

Anyway I managed to find some more information on this printer - it's 
been rebadged (for Australia I guess)  Its real name is QMS (Quality 
Micro Systems) - PS800+ and its a postscript printer with emulation for 
Appletalk, HP Laser Jet and HPGL Plotter(for CAD stuff). Apparently they 
were the bees knees in 1987 when they came on the market.
But I still can't get any of my computers to talk to it either with 
Linux or windows so I'm thinking there's something wrong with the serial 
interface on the printer - guess I'll just keep working at it.

cheers,
michael
