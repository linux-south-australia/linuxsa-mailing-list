   &gt;I'm trying to see if I can get a late (ish) version of wine 20020327-1
   &gt;and
   &gt;KDE 2.2.2 working on my RH7.1 distribution.  I get the usual "Russian
   &gt;Doll"
   &gt;like list of dependancy problems - I've worked these down to a
   &gt;requirement
   &gt;for "libcrypto.so.2" and "libssl.so.2" both of which are provided by
   &gt;"openssl 0.9.6b-8". When I try to install this I get a string of errors
   &gt;of
   &gt;the form:"libcrypto.so.1 is needed by ......." - in other words to
   &gt;install
   &gt;this package I need to uninstall my existing openssl package, which I
   &gt;presume will break the 20 odd other listed installations.
   &gt;
   &gt;Have I got this right?
   &gt;Is my only option to install ADSL and spend the next month downloading
   &gt;and
   &gt;installing packages? - maybe it would be cheaper to pay "Uncle Bill" 
 &gt;his
   &gt;computer tax and install Windoze :-(. This would annoy the kids - they
   &gt;are
   &gt;linux believers - and, besides not withstanding the doubters of the
   &gt;recent
   &gt;"Creator of Enlightenment says..." thread I would prefer to have linux
   &gt;on
   &gt;my desktop.
   &gt;
   &gt;Please help me with this!

At the risk of sounding like a fanatic, I would suggest installing
debian rather than redhat. Why?

&lt;fanaticism&gt;

- no dependency problems, if you apt-get install &lt;package&gt;, it will
install all required dependencies automatically. This is a policy
requirement in Debian for any package in stable or testing.

- It is maintained / created by volunteers, and stays as true as
possible to open source ideals.

- The stable version is STABLE. Currently this also means reasonably up
to date as v3.0 (woody) has recently gone stable. If you want a more up
to date desktop system, testing is stable enough (comparable to other
distro numbered releases but in more of a state of flux) the only
problem being that if you don't update often enough you end up with too
much to download...

Don't be scared by rumors of installing problems - it isn't that bad,
and once it is on you should never have to install again - thanks to the
effectiveness of the upgrading system.

&lt;/fanaticism&gt;

Barney
