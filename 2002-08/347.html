&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Actually, one of the real issues for a new or casual user is the ability
&gt; &gt; &gt;to find packages that do a certain task. If I want an image editing
&gt; &gt; &gt;program, and have not heard of the gimp, (where have I been??) then I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt;going to be futzing around a lot in any of the distro's.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not true, see proof below (and that someone else posted earlier.)

Well, yes and no. You are right, once the new user has been pointed to apt
for rpm (in a RedHat newbie case) their troubles with dependancies are
just about solved. As you suggest, the Synaptic gui on top of that makes
things pretty straight forward.

Trouble is, how are they going to find apt for rpm and synaptic if those
packages aren't in the default install?

If newbie is the classic escapee from Windows, where dependancies are
usually shipped with the software installer (or so ubiquitous that we
probably already have them or know where to get them), this is a major
PITA. Is there any sign that RedHat will adopt apt?

The issue we haven't mentioned here yet, is ease of keeping the system
security patched. Without a RH subscription, this can be a tedious and
manual process that will most likely not be reliably carried out. Apt of
course changes that as well. In fact, apart from the verification of the
authenticity of the package provider (which is missing in apt for rpm from
what I can see, don't know about debian) the process is almost as easy as
the Mac OS X software updater, which is a very clean and smart system.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; As a "new or casual user" I couldn't agree with you more. The most
&gt; &gt; frustruting thing is naming. For example in a recent rpm battle, I got the
&gt; &gt; message "libcrypt.so.2" needed. Now, what package provides this library?
&gt;    :
&gt; &gt; I finally found it with google - on the rpmfind site! - and what is package
&gt; &gt; containing it called? -  "openssl" !!
&gt; 
&gt; 	$ apt-cache search libcrypto
&gt; 	libssl0.9.6 - SSL shared libraries
&gt; 
&gt; It's probably time to ask yourself why you got into an rpm battle in the
&gt; first place. I suggest it is because you haven't installed an 'rpm battle
&gt; manager', ie apt. Most users simply don't want to know about these
&gt; details, and I find that programs are much better at managing package
&gt; dependencies than most people. Not all people, but most.
&gt; 
&gt; And in case anyone wants to propose urpmi, here's an example of why I
&gt; don't think it is mature enough yet to compete with apt: how do I roll
&gt; back a distribution upgrade? Answer: you can't. urpmi has made great
&gt; strides recently though.

I haven't tried to roll back with either apt or urpmi, but I have a lot
less faith in urpmi than apt. It's just been a bit too 'beta' in my
experience.

&gt; 
&gt; And once again: no matter how good the tools, if the dependencies in each
&gt; package haven't been carefully constructed it will all fall in a heap.
