Ian,

&gt; one way is to book a fault call with Telstra and get them to do a MOLDS
&gt; test on your line.

Well, the ever unhelpful Telstra.

&gt; Modem On-Line Diagnostic Service

I asked the person SPECIFICALLY for this and I got the:

* have you got any other things connected to the line
* is the modem external
* have you contacted your ISP

...and then claimed there was nothing wrong with my telephone line.
Which there is...

&gt; No charge and believe me, the techs were very nice guys to deal with
&gt; and very helpful.

I'm yet to find an effective and helpful Telstra technician. They often
attempt to be helpful but they fall over their red tape. 

&gt; Try them out. Oh, ask them for a 4 or 5 minute test in case it shows
&gt; some pattern. Normally they give it a 1 minute test.

I'm currently playing the charades of let them go through their due
process. Seriously, if they suddenly refuse to do a MOLDS test I'll be
off to the TIO and seeing they probably get so many complaints it will
probably cost them money. And if it starts costing them money they might
actually do something about it...

:-(
