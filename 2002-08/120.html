Okay, fair enough, it doesn't bother me either way whether or not an AOL 
client of some sort should or should not exist which works under Linux; 
I just don't care. And I'm sure someone will find this information 
useful in some way, shape or form, so I don't want to belittle the 
efforts you and Tina Gasperson put in, but for the love of $DIETY, why?

It is a hell of a lot of work to go through just to get something up and 
running that already exists on the target platform: namely access to the 
Internet via a modem connection. There's a gazillion ISPs out there that 
provide an equivalent service to AOL's, that uses a standard means of 
connecting to their service, doesn't come encumbered with all the crud 
that AOL inflicts upon it's users, and Just Works under Linux.

It seems like going to all the effort to get the Windows version of 
Quake 1 running under Linux, when there's already a Linux native version 
of Quake 3, or running up the Win3.11 File Manager in a virtual machine 
under OS/2 to do some file management, when you could have done it using 
the WPS. (Heh!)

Anyway, it would seem to me that anyone proficient wnough to get this 
working under Linux would be at a level such that they see through and 
hence don't need AOL's "value-adds", and so wouldn't need the client 
running under Linux in the first place.

So, to satisfy all the pragmaticists in today's audience, or maybe just 
me... why go to all the effort?
