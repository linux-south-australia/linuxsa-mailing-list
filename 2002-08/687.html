As some of you probably know, Internode has all but completed its 
relocation to new premises.

That means we have a computer room at 31 York Street in the Adelaide
CBD which is now completely empty (or will be when NDC finish carting
away the Telstra stuff this afternoon).

Said computer room features a raised floor with a network of cable 
tray underneath for power and network cable distribution.  The floor
is approximately 50 square meters, made out of 600 x 600 tiles.  The 
tiles and stand-offs are rated to carry the weight of whatever equipment
racks you want to place into it.  Some of the tiles are pre-cut with
penetrations for cables and cooling for 19" racks.

The mirror-ball is, sadly, not included, but you may feel free to
install your own if you wish to reenact some great moments in history.

If some company in the Adelaide area wishes to acquire that raised 
floor, they're welcome to have it, provided they can come and carry 
it away before lunch time this Friday.  We're not selling it, we're
giving it away.

We will need to supervise its removal, so we'd ask for some kind of
compensation for our time.  I'm thinking something in the region of a 
few hundred dollars or half a dozen cartons of Coopers Pale Ale or
something similar.

If you only want part of the floor, then sorry, we're not interested.
If you want it but can't pick it up before lunch time on Friday, then
sorry, we're not interested.  But if you are willing to turn up and 
carry it away, then this is an excellent opportunity to pick up something
for free which ordinarily costs thousands, if not tens of thousands to 
buy new.

Please send expressions of interest to John Lindsay &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jlindsay@internode.com.au">jlindsay@internode.com.au</A>&gt;.
Time is of the essence, because demolition of the building is scheduled to
begin at the start of next week.

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
