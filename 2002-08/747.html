&gt;  What really stinks is "free" neat mp3 application development will now

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway such is life, we now move on to something new and fresh  (*sigh*)

or move underground.. DivX and DeCSS are still easy to find, and they both
were illegal at some point. (DeCSS still is I think, at least in america)

Eventually we'll move onto a new format, such as Ogg, but unfortunately it'll
face competition from other 'secure' formats that the RIAA and so on will be
pushing. Hardware devices might be purely WMA and SDMI?

Out of interest, how does LAME get away without paying the encoder fee? Is it
because it's done using a new implementaton that isn't patented? Or something
else? (Sorry, its probably in a FAQ if i went looking)

If LAME didn't have to pay the patent royalties, then perhaps some of the free
decoders (eg. mpg321, mad) won't have to either?
