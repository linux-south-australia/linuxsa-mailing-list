&gt; &gt;Hi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Actually, one of the real issues for a new or casual user is the ability
&gt; &gt;to find packages that do a certain task. If I want an image editing
&gt; &gt;program, and have not heard of the gimp, (where have I been??) then I'm
&gt; &gt;going to be futzing around a lot in any of the distro's.

This is not true, see proof below (and that someone else posted earlier.)

&gt; As a "new or casual user" I couldn't agree with you more. The most
&gt; frustruting thing is naming. For example in a recent rpm battle, I got the
&gt; message "libcrypt.so.2" needed. Now, what package provides this library?
   :
&gt; I finally found it with google - on the rpmfind site! - and what is package
&gt; containing it called? -  "openssl" !!

	$ apt-cache search libcrypto
	libssl0.9.6 - SSL shared libraries

It's probably time to ask yourself why you got into an rpm battle in the
first place. I suggest it is because you haven't installed an 'rpm battle
manager', ie apt. Most users simply don't want to know about these
details, and I find that programs are much better at managing package
dependencies than most people. Not all people, but most.

And in case anyone wants to propose urpmi, here's an example of why I
don't think it is mature enough yet to compete with apt: how do I roll
back a distribution upgrade? Answer: you can't. urpmi has made great
strides recently though.

And once again: no matter how good the tools, if the dependencies in each
package haven't been carefully constructed it will all fall in a heap.
