&gt;&gt; 3. hardware assisted compartmentalization -- CPU can run privileged

&gt;&gt; and can not modify.  (Optionally the software source can be published,
&gt;&gt; but that is not necessary, and if it's not you won't be able to
&gt;&gt; reverse-engineer it as it can be encrypted for the CPU).

Thinking about what I said further down, I can see how the 'sand box' 
mechanism could be used to limit and restrict processes. For example 
look at OpenSSH Privilage seperation, and some of the tricks qmail use.

It just requires that MS, and others, code well and test well in order 
to properly benefit from Palladium (etc...), otherwise, at least in a 
Microsoft-only world, Palladium will be a bigger limitation, risk, 
interference etc... than a world without it.

Taking the rose coloured glasses off, I can see the consumer and 
businesses suffering. A secure machine (in hardware etc...) is a good 
idea in principle, but that assumes a perfect world, where the consumer 
and other businesses are respected, and where due care is taken.

&gt; Imagine an exploit that works its way in via an IIS exploit, and then 
&gt; somehow runs with the privilages of an IIS DLL or something similar 
&gt; (possible?). It then owns your box, and cannot be scanned or removed 
&gt; etc... Or it could use an exploit in the updates mechanism and really 
&gt; own the box.
&gt; 
&gt; The term "root kit" takes on new meaning.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine the adware and spyware and monitoring that you cannot disable.
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine that you want to excersie your choice as a consumer and use 
&gt; another alternative... oh well...
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine that you decide not to complain, and you write your own OS 
&gt; and/or applications... oh well...
&gt; 
&gt; Dale.
