&gt; Have you got a serial break-out box? What may be happening is that your
&gt; cable is set up as DTE and the printer is actually DCE. I've forgotten
&gt; what the standard cable is, but if the interface is ok, and you cannot
&gt; talk with it then this is probably the problem.

Along related lines, quite often these older printers need their control
lines raised high before they will send/receive data correctly (especially
if they use hardware flow control).  For starters, if it is a DTE device
(as they typically are), look at tying CTS (pin 5), DSR (6) and DCD (8)
to DTR (pin 20).

&gt;&gt; Anyway I managed to find some more information on this printer - it's
&gt;&gt; been rebadged (for Australia I guess)  Its real name is QMS (Quality
&gt;&gt; Micro Systems) - PS800+ and its a postscript printer with emulation

I actually think I serviced one or two of these (in a past life, I
did computer peripheral servicing).  I think (but may have the brand
confused) Impact also brought out a laser printer that had a kangaroo
hopping across the LCD as it warmed it (back in the days when laser
warmups took nearly a minute) (breaks out the walking frame ...).
