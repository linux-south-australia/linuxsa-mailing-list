&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that the freezing has to do with a conflict between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; screen savers, monitor power management by KDE, and monitor
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power management by the OS.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I get the freezing with random xscreensavers too even without
&gt; &gt; &gt; running kde which I think sucks imho. The problem is each
&gt; &gt; &gt; screensaver program is individually maintained and not always up
&gt; &gt; &gt; to date with current XFree specs.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does that STILL happen !
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I stopped using the sceen savers during Xfree3.x For exactly that
&gt; &gt; reason. I was better with the curren 4.x series but still a hassle.
&gt; &gt; (run for about 24hours and then bang but not consistant and rarely a
&gt; &gt; chance to get an output/log and too long and resource intensive to
&gt; &gt; bother with debugging. (and what does all that stuff about xcalls
&gt; &gt; and frame buffers mean anyway :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just turn off the xscreensaver or pick one that doesn't freeze
&gt; &gt; &gt; your system.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can make a list of them --- I can't remeber off the top of my
&gt; &gt; head. Just turn the things off. Or pick one or two. (It's a shame
&gt; &gt; though, some of them are excellent , way better than tele !)
&gt; 
&gt; I agree, some of them are excellent and also have a lot of options so
&gt; you can customise them. I stopped using the xscreensavers though as it
&gt; seemed like a waste of resources. I also have a 3 head xinerama
&gt; desktop so I suspected some of them may not have liked the xinerama
&gt; setup I use, as not all of them span the 3 screens (atlantis for
&gt; example only displays on the primary). Not using the xscreensavers
&gt; however cured all my freezing problems completely.
&gt; 
&gt; BTW I rarely (almost never) use mozilla so I doubt it's the cause, and
&gt; I hate kde prefering fvwm and fvwm-themes with gnome. And the freeze
&gt; has been happening on my original RH7.1 install, RH7.2 and now I've
&gt; upgraded to RH7.3 it still happens. I'm quite convinced xscreensaver
&gt; is the culprit. I'm just not sure which of the many screensaver
&gt; choices are guilty of doing it. It's definately several of them
&gt; though, but not all.

The other thing is to check that they are not being called on twice. KDE
and then your Xserver ...  What does xset -q say about the screensaver..
I canot remeber how to change them but I know you can...  man xset ? ...
I hate to say this but it may also be a hardware prob. causing a
segfault or something.. They are quite processor intensive. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Alex
&gt; -
&gt; I've run DOOM more in the last few days than I have the last few
&gt; months.  I just love debugging ;-)
