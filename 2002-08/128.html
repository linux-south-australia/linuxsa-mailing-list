&gt; First, I want to say that I am not "for" or "against" AOL being in
&gt; Linux. This is just information.
&gt;
&gt; I give all of the credit to Tina Gasperson, who posted her article at
&gt; Newsforge on April 19, 2002.
&gt;
&gt; AOL 5 Works fairly well, it will "just die" once in a while, and I
&gt; haven't checked out all of the features within it yet. I just did this
&gt; about an hour ago.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I found this article at NewsForge:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/04/19/0053224.shtml?tid">http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/04/19/0053224.shtml?tid</A>=5
&gt;
&gt; I then found a blue AOL CD labeled "America Online's X-tra 7.0 1000
&gt; Hours Free! For 45 Days. BTW - I have no problem making a copy for
&gt; Lindows.com, or maybe a few people to "spread the burden."
&gt;
&gt; When I mounted the drive, I noticed it had a variety of subdirectories
&gt; labeled AOL30, AOL40, AOL50, AOL50B, AOL50NT, AOL60, AOL70 and AOLTECH.
&gt;
&gt; Seeing that I had AOL 5 in the AOL50 directory, the next thing I did was
&gt; subscribe to Wine X ($5 a month), and I got their RPM file and installed
&gt; Winex.
&gt;
&gt; After that, I went to a Windows 98 Machine and obtained a copy of
&gt; WSOCK32.DLL, and copied it into the /home/james/.transgaming/c_drive
&gt; directory.
&gt;
&gt; I then insterted the blue AOL CDROM drive and went into the shell.
&gt;
&gt; I typed mount /media/cdrom (This is SuSE, others may use /mnt/cdrom)
&gt;
&gt; I then typed the following at the shell:
&gt;
&gt; cd /media/cdrom
&gt;
&gt; cd aol50
&gt;
&gt; winex SETUP32.EXE
&gt;
&gt; After a momentary pause, but some hard drive action, a dialogue box
&gt; comes up and asks you if you are a current member or not.
&gt;
&gt; EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT A MEMBER, I CHOSE CURRENT MEMBER, AND CLICKED ON
&gt; NEXT - SAVES A LOT OF TIME!!
&gt;
&gt; Next I said CREATE AN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR THIS COMPUTER.
&gt;
&gt; The install went fairly fast, and AOL was even nice enough to give me an
&gt; icon that starts AOL. It also put a small AOL symbol on the bottom right
&gt; of my KDE desktop.
&gt;
&gt; The rest is a normal AOL install, so I won't go into too much detail.
