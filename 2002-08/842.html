Hey All,

Just having a little bit of fun with a network booting computer at the
moment. At work we are running the LTSP project in order to run NSSE (the
terminal server edition of Win4Lin) in a thin-client solution. Here at
home I've set up a small server (only a celeron machine) and a single
client so that I can play with it and test things before implementing them
at work.

I have currently got it working if I use an RTL8029 (10Mbps) PCI card. I
don't have a ROM for the card and am using a floppy image of the Etherboot
software. Works ok, except for Gnome occasionally bombs out and I end back
up at the gdm login screen.

If I try the RTL8139 (100Mbps) floppy boot it finds the DHCP server,
downloads the kernel, boots the kernel, but gets stuck mounting the root
filesystem via NFS. The error I get is "nfs: server 172.17.33.250 is not
responding. still trying". Strange, as it worked a few moments ago with
the 8029 card and if I put the 8029 card back in it does work.

Next I try an Intel EtherExpress Pro/100 PCI card. With the Etherboot
floppy (using the correct image) it gives exactly the same symptoms as the
RTL8139 boot. It's almost like the NFS server doesn't like 100Mbps cards!

When I try to use the PXE feature of the Intel card using the pxelinux
program that's part of syslinux it gets a DHCP address and downloads the
kernel. When it boots the kernel it causes the screen to corrupt. Kind of
hard to describe but it basically makes every character position on the
screen a random background colour with a random character in it, with a
fair number of them blinking. Actually looks quite interesting ;) Trouble
is it isn't what I want!

The server is a stock standard RH7.3 machine. I've tried 2 different video
cards, 2 different Intel cards and 3 different RTL8139 cards in the
client, so it would seem to be a configuration problem rather than a
hardware problem.

Anyone set this up before? Any hints would be appreciated!

Darryl
