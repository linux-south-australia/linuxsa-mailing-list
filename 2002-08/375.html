AARNet IPv6 Workshop, Adelaide
29 - 30 October 2002

AARNet will bring it's popular IPv6 workshop to Adelaide on 29-30
October.

This is an opportunity for 12-18 people to assemble and configure an
IPv6 network and its services.  Each participant will work with two or
three others to get hands-on experience configuring Cisco IOS for
IPv6.  We ask that participants bring a notebook computer to configure
IPv6 services (recent Windows, Linux, FreeBSD or MacOS with suitable
patches).  Participants are welcome to bring their own non-Cisco IPv6
routers to be integrated into the network, please let us know if you
wish to do this so we can allow for cabling and power.

The workshop is suitable for network engineers, software engineers
with networking experience, and senior systems administrators.  There
is also room for a small number of computer science academics who
specialise in networking but have no Cisco router configuration
experience.

Topics covered include: architecture, addressing, interface
configuration, OSPF and BGP routing protcool configuration, DNS
configuration, transition strategies, web, e-mail and other services
and their configuration.

The workshop has been developed in conjuction with Internet2 and
parallels that given by the Internet2 IPv6 Working Group.

The workshop will held on the Adelaide Universiy premises at
   Level 2
