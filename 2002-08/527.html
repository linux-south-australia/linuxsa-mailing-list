&gt; Speaking of domains and hostnames..
&gt; A group of people including myself have been using shells on a box hosted
&gt; at an ISP for a few years now. Having a permanently accessible machine with
&gt; your email etc upon it becomes quite valuable after you've got used to
&gt; having it.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, this particular ISP told us, yesterday, that we had until tomorrow
&gt; close of business to either move to a much more expensive plan and pay a
&gt; setup cost on top of this, or else remove the box altogether. We probably
&gt; can't afford the new rates.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't seen any of the other users post to LinuxSA yet, so I thought I'd
&gt; ask here if anyone has any advice about other places (perhaps intl?) that
&gt; might offer good Linux/FreeBSD shell & domain hosting, or else people who
&gt; might be able to offer to either
&gt;
&gt; a) host a few domains and shell accounts on one of their machines, in
&gt; return for a small fee.
&gt; or
&gt; b) host the entire machine, again for some moderate fee.
&gt;
&gt; Katie and Tim know more about the details (eg. average b/w use, etc), and I
&gt; haven't had a chance to get this stuff off them yet, but I thought i'd ask
&gt; around now, since we've only got a day or so to make a decision. &gt;:/
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Toby

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; yes, that's what I've been vaguely wondering in this discussion:
&gt; &gt; who cares about the actual IP address(es)?
&gt; &gt; that's what you have domains and hostnames for.
