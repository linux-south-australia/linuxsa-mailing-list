Aren't the Jpeg "developers" trying to extract a royalty on all Jpeg images
now also. I'm sure I read something about this recently.

Whatever the case it really is not going to stop anyone who wants to
get/create MP3s as there is always an underground market. It's just the
developers of MP3 players that will suffer big time. Given that most are
currently free anyway it's a bit sad but I guess they will possibly have to
take on more Advertising or such to cover the licensing expenses.

Can't really see how they will be able to police the number of decoders and
encoders.

&gt; licensing terms
&gt; &gt; of Thomson and the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, who are the
&gt; owners of the mp3
&gt; &gt; patents, have changed. Now not only mp3 encoders but also
&gt; mp3 decoders
&gt; &gt; require a license. This page lists the
&gt; &gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html&gt">http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html&gt</A>; fees --
&gt; it's $0.75 per
&gt; &gt; decoder. As a consequence, Red Hat has already removed all
&gt; mp3 players from
&gt; &gt; the Rawhide development version."
&gt;
&gt; The FreeBSD core team heard about this earlier today (our time).  So
&gt; far we're taking a "wait and see" attitude.  The FreeBSD project
&gt; doesn't produce any MP3 decoders, so any involvement on our part would
&gt; be pretty indirect.  It's also not clear that it applies to free
&gt; software: the heading is
&gt;
&gt;    This patent-only license is needed in case the mp3 software is
&gt;    developed in-house or licensed from a third party.
&gt;
&gt; That's not quite what free software does.  "Licensing from a third
&gt; party" implies a contract, which isn't the case here.  If it *did*
&gt; apply, I'd be much more upset by the next category:
&gt;
&gt;    Annual minimum royalties are payable upon signature and each
&gt;    following year in January and are fully creditable against annual
&gt;    royalties.
&gt;
&gt;    US$ 15 000.00 per calendar year
&gt;
&gt; You'll recall that something like this happened with the GIF format a
&gt; few years back, resulting, as predicted, in the complete disappearance
&gt; of that format.

&gt;
&gt; No, there's no way for them to be asked to pay.  It could only apply
&gt; to new hardware decoders, and quite honestly, what's $0.75 in such a
&gt; case?
