[snip: the .deb package format is better than the RPM format]

&gt; I don't think this argument is a compelling one for not using the RPM
&gt; format, even though I don't think it is the best.

[shrug]

These days, it probably isn't a compelling one either way. 
Unfortunately, I'm not famililar enough with the modern RPM format to 
make an authoritative call either way, but from what I hear, Debian's 
format is still better.

Out of curosity, can someone tell me precisely how rpm checks its 
dependencies, is is based on the existance of a particular file, or is 
it based on having a particular package installed?

&gt; But this is something which has nothing to do with the RPM format at all.

Yes, that is correct. But this is precisely why programs like "apt for 
RPMs" won't fix a lot of the problems people have with dependencies when 
using a RPM based distro, which is the whole point I was trying to make.

And it still doesn't change the fact that you'll most likely get less 
pain from dependencies when using Debian.

&gt; I think more of this is due to policy standards and a bit of discipline
&gt; than technology.

Which is (effectively) what I said. Nice to see we agree. :)

&gt; And size, perhaps, in the sense that probably no company
&gt; can currently afford to pay as many application packagers as Debian
&gt; has.

Yep, which is another reason to use Debian.

&gt; The quality is high. Dependency breakages in the testing distro are
&gt; rare and easily fixed, and in the stable distribution pretty much never
&gt; occur.

Indeed, which is another reason to use Debian.

&gt; (Incidentally it is possible to run a mixture of testing and
&gt; stable using an apt feature called pinning.)

Yes, a really nice feature, another excellent reason to use Debian.

&gt; If you think that the Debian package management tools are all wonder and
&gt; light, have a look at lists.debian.org where the developers are describe
&gt; their faults in detail and are working out how to improve things.

Hey, after using Debian for a reasonable amount of time (3-4 years), 
after having followed a number of Debian lists for the same number of 
years and having created unofficial .debs myself, I know it isn't all 
fantatstic, believe me.

Note again that I said it's the love[0] that DD's put into their 
packages that make most of the difference, not purely the tools. Thjs is 
something commercial distro company can come close to.

But it's good to see we agree. :)
