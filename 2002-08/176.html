&gt; -u or apt-get upgrade to keep my Redhat system completely up to date

&gt; to convert packages from one format to another without a single problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe this negates the whole argument about debian's perceived
&gt; advantages over other distro's.

A argument based on 'Debian is better than X because RPM is bad'
demonstrates a lack of understanding by the proponent.

By way of example: You won't have to do much digging to discover that
parts of the binary format that gcc generates to create an executeable
program are the height of scrambled design. Nevertheless it fulfills its
function and allows BSD, Linux and plenty of other things to work very
well. Similarly, the rather strange way that a binary RPM is put together
by the rpm tool really doesn't have much relevance to how well
dependencies work.

So leaving that spurious argument aside, try the following demonstration
to see how a purely RPM distribution (that is, a distribution that does
not have a generic dependency-management system in place) can be difficult
to work with. Take the RedHat 7.3 or Mandrake 8.2 CDs and install a
minimal base system. Then try to add just enough prepackaged functionality
to the system so that it is a file/print/web server and nothing else, in
order to minimise risk. You will probably end up doing dozens of "rpm -i
foo" from the CDs, frequently getting messages about failed dependency
"baz" forcing you to do "rpm -i baz", etc etc. This is a real pain and
since it is a very common situation lots of sysadmins feel that there has
to be a better way.

In contrast, doing this same exercise with Conectiva or Debian is very
much easier. You can say 'apt-get install apache-perl', and if perl isn't
installed then it is queued to be installed automatically. Etc.

&gt; And finally the most convincing argument is that Redhat not only has all
&gt; you need and more

For people who typically just install a large subset of what RedHat has
one the CD (or all of it) this is probably true. On the other hand, system
administrators often have reasons for finding RedHat too expensive, and I
just gave you one example.

&gt; but is also more widely known and supported by the linux community and
&gt; support channels everywhere

You might have some trouble supporting this statement. But I think that
has been well covered on this list before.
