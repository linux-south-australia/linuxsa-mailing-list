Hi all,

If anyone is after raised flooring from a Computer room that is being
demolished please contact me off list ASAP. The panels and Steel framing are
being ripped up in the next few days and are being taken to the Dump unless
anyone wants em.
P.S. The site is in Berri ( Country SA ) and you would have to be quick.

Don't bother contacting me after COB Friday 16/8/2002.


Regards
