IPv6 encourages everything to be dynamically allocated, there's even
been suggestion of running smaller ISP's off of dynamically allocated
address blocks. Because it uses your network card's mac address as part
of the dynamic allocation, you still have a static component of the
addressing to work with. By the time ipv6 is in widespread use, dynamic
DNS will probably have much better availability and robustness as well.

If you have your own block of address space, the whole Internet needs to
know where to find it, which means extra ram in routers everywhere. It's
been one of the scalability problems of IPv4, as many high end routers
can only take 128mb of ram, which is barely enough to see all of the
world's routes (currently around 101,000 of them) in a multihomed
configuration.

Each route entry means another decision a router has to make when
forwarding a packet. Fortunately various algorithms make this less
painful than 101,000 if-then-else statements, but it still adds up to
CPU usage, which impacts on the scalability of the Internet as a whole.

ipv6 offers an opportunity to 'do it right' and not have end users
holding /24 equivalents and polluting route tables everywhere.

The only thing I'm not aware of yet is how to multihome properly with
provider-allocated ipv6. I think that will be tonights homework for me
:)
