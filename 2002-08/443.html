&gt; 1.  What are ppl's thoughts on AIT drives, ie: tape reliability,
&gt; support under linux?  DAT looks to be outliving its usefulness for
&gt; us, as our space requirements are increasing exponentially.

AIT's a killer, mate. The media's supposed to last a great deal longer
too -- 30,000 end-to-end passes is what Sony is claiming on the
35/91GB tapes. I'm yet to rack up anything near 30,000 end-to-end
passes, but I'm very happy so far.

The tape reliability seems to be pretty good. Compatibility didn't
seem to be an issue whatsoever -- it just worked :-)

&gt; 2.  Any thoughts on backup software?  
&gt; 
&gt; Currently we're using Arcserve on most of our servers, but it may
&gt; well work out to be too expensive for this particular box.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I like Arcserve, the web based management is very 
&gt; functional etc, and it does everything we need it to do at present.
&gt; (there are a couple things I'd like to change, but that's software
&gt; for u, and we're using older versions so things may have improved)
&gt; 
&gt; We may well have issues down the track with centralised backup for 
&gt; some remote sites also, so trying to think longterm here, whether
&gt; we bite the bullet with short term pain for long term gain etc.

Amanda is pretty good, but then you might want to consider how that's
going to work in with the current backup infrastructure. If it's just
a stand-alone box, tar is as good as any. I'm sure you don't need to
be told that there are a few factors in a choosing backup system :-)
