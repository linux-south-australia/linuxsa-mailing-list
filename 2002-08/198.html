&gt; I get a simular problem - Randomly, for no apparent reason (especially
&gt; during EverQuest, grr...) my "CS" (not sure if its the same as the
&gt; TST?) light goes off, and even though I'm still connected, I can't do
&gt; anything - there's absolutely no modem communications at all.
&gt;
&gt; After 30 seconds or so it'll kick back in, the light will come back on,
&gt; and everything that should have been sent/recieved will suddenly burst.
&gt;
&gt; This happens with both my Linux & FreeBSD router.
&gt;
&gt; I'm completely confused to as why... I guessed possibly it might be my
&gt; modem (Actiontec/Diamond Data 56K), but I've never had the opportunity
&gt; to test another one.
&gt;
&gt; I live about 1km away from the exchange, and the line quality here is
&gt; brilliant - I get &gt;50K/bits connections every time.


It sounds like you might be getting some intermittent noise on your phone
line that is causing you modem to lose carrier signal. The modem will be
unresponsive while it tries to regain carrier signal. Usually a modem will
give up before 30 seconds and hang up, but you can alter that by modifying
the value in the S10 register of the modem.

Lower connect speeds are less sensitive to line noise, so you may want to
try forcing the modem to connect at a lower speed if you value a more
consistent performance from you modem over speed.

Or you can try to find the source of the intermittent noise. Some models
of phones are notorious for making intermittent noise on a phone line when
on hook, so you may want to try unplugging any other phone devices you
have on the same line as the modem.

Cheers.
