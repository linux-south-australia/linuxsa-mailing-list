gday all,

using a gentoo 1.2 distro and just finished seting up cups 1.1.15-r2 
(emerge cups) with an epson 760 (connected via USB)

it works, I can print to it
so whats the problem?

well, should printing an A4 sheet with about 3% coverage (text) and a 
small image (work logo) from Open Office take about 15-20 minutes?

and then should the final result be worst quality than my canon bj10e 
could produce, if it had blocked nozzles, a buggered head and I have 
been using cheap ink refills in the original cartridge its entire life?

I wouldnt have thought so.
so where am I going wrong?

it starts printing nice and quickly (about 1cm width per pass) then 
slows right down after about 4 lines at the faster pace then it prints 
about the width of a pin head every 7-10 passes

the epson prints perfectly well from windoze, fast and good quality but 
as we are currently migrating from windoze to linux workstations at work 
I need to make this work right.

anyone else had any similar experiences?
or maybe offer some advise on the best way to improve quality?

this is the priunters.conf entry, there is nothing in the messages log 
or any of the cups logs other than the fact it can see and then, has 
printed the job

from /etc/cups/printers.conf
