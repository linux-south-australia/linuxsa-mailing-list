&gt; of Thomson and the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, who are the owners of the mp3
&gt; patents, have changed. Now not only mp3 encoders but also mp3 decoders
&gt; require a license. This page lists the
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html&gt">http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html&gt</A>; fees -- it's $0.75 per
&gt; decoder. As a consequence, Red Hat has already removed all mp3 players from
&gt; the Rawhide development version."

The FreeBSD core team heard about this earlier today (our time).  So
far we're taking a "wait and see" attitude.  The FreeBSD project
doesn't produce any MP3 decoders, so any involvement on our part would
be pretty indirect.  It's also not clear that it applies to free
software: the heading is

   This patent-only license is needed in case the mp3 software is
   developed in-house or licensed from a third party.

That's not quite what free software does.  "Licensing from a third
party" implies a contract, which isn't the case here.  If it *did*
apply, I'd be much more upset by the next category:

   Annual minimum royalties are payable upon signature and each
   following year in January and are fully creditable against annual
   royalties.

   US$ 15 000.00 per calendar year

You'll recall that something like this happened with the GIF format a
few years back, resulting, as predicted, in the complete disappearance
of that format.

No, there's no way for them to be asked to pay.  It could only apply
to new hardware decoders, and quite honestly, what's $0.75 in such a
case?
