&gt; You mean, it makes more sense to regard SuSE 7.3 for pSeries or RH7.1 for
&gt; zSeries as the latest version because it is a different product, rather
&gt; than assume it is behind just because the version isn't 8.0 or 7.3
&gt; respectively?

Well in the case of SuSE I'd put their 7.3/8.0 products more into the
desktop or small server category. For the higher end machines they
have SLES (SuSE Linux Enterprise Server) which is released at the same
version (7) for IA32, IA64, zSeries, iSeries, and pSeries.

&gt; But take RH for zSeries for example - if you were motivated you could fix
&gt; some of the bugs by simply porting from RH 7.3 for Intel, which tends to
&gt; give the feeling that the zSeries port has been left behind a bit. 

Yea, thats not something that most people using zSeries boxes would
want to do (I'm not familiar with RH on zSeries).

It appears to me that Linux companies (distro and non distro) are
concentrating a lot more on the separate server offerrings (eg
Advanced Server, SLES) and in those situations there is a much greater
demand (proportionally) for running on non IA32, even non Intel
hardware.

&gt; about SuSE on zSeries. Hmm, yes, with zSeries SuSE I can't think of
&gt; any problems just now that make me feel like it is out of date wrt
&gt; SuSE Intel 8.0 and the security updates have been prompt as far as I
&gt; recall.
&gt; 
&gt; So yes, "don't get sucked in by numerology" is a good point.

Yes, and Debian is way behind in that competition :-)

&gt; PS is it just me that thinks RH on zSeries is rough?

Haven't yet had the opportunity to play on a zSeries box :-(
