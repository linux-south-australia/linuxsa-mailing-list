&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that the freezing has to do with a conflict between screen
&gt; &gt; &gt; savers, monitor power management by KDE, and monitor power
&gt; &gt; &gt; management by the OS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I get the freezing with random xscreensavers too even without running
&gt; &gt; kde which I think sucks imho. The problem is each screensaver program
&gt; &gt; is individually maintained and not always up to date with current
&gt; &gt; XFree specs.
&gt; 
&gt; Does that STILL happen !
&gt; 
&gt; I stopped using the sceen savers during Xfree3.x For exactly that
&gt; reason. I was better with the curren 4.x series but still a hassle. (run
&gt; for about 24hours and then bang but not consistant and rarely a chance
&gt; to get an output/log and too long and resource intensive to bother with
&gt; debugging. (and what does all that stuff about xcalls and frame buffers
&gt; mean anyway :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just turn off the xscreensaver or pick one that doesn't freeze your
&gt; &gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; You can make a list of them --- I can't remeber off the top of my head.
&gt; Just turn the things off. Or pick one or two. (It's a shame though, some
&gt; of them are excellent , way better than tele !)

I agree, some of them are excellent and also have a lot of options so
you can customise them. I stopped using the xscreensavers though as it
seemed like a waste of resources. I also have a 3 head xinerama desktop
so I suspected some of them may not have liked the xinerama setup I use,
as not all of them span the 3 screens (atlantis for example only
displays on the primary). Not using the xscreensavers however cured all
my freezing problems completely.

BTW I rarely (almost never) use mozilla so I doubt it's the cause, and I
hate kde prefering fvwm and fvwm-themes with gnome. And the freeze has
been happening on my original RH7.1 install, RH7.2 and now I've upgraded
to RH7.3 it still happens. I'm quite convinced xscreensaver is the
culprit. I'm just not sure which of the many screensaver choices are
guilty of doing it. It's definately several of them though, but not all.

I've run DOOM more in the last few days than I have the last few
months.  I just love debugging ;-)
