Hi Ian,
Like you, I'd say that most Comunity House's are always on the lookout for
the most cost effective solution and would welcome the opportubity to save
funds on infrastructure and technology costs.

&gt; The machines I am suggesting to them will be running either Intel
&gt; Celeron 1.7 G or AMD XP Palomino 1600+ chips with 40G drives, 17"
&gt; monitors and 256 Meg SDRAM memory.
&gt; I am suggesting they install the XP Pro OS (as they are to be networked
&gt;  with network Internet and printer etc) and running the Office XP Small
&gt;  Business suite.

The Hardware you're proposing is probably the recommended spec for MS XP
etc etc - big $ hardware and then there's the software licences!
Why not suggest a Linux-based thin client solution - you can use
486's/Pentiun 100's (with minimum spec) or thereabouts as the terminals
with only one of your high spec machines for the server.

&gt; Can you help me put up a package of OpenSource software appropriate to
&gt; a community house and teaching complete learners?

Software: Any of the Linux distros, OpenOffice1.0.1 for the Office Package,
Mozilla for the web browser and perhaps e-mail or you could use Evolution -
the Linux clone of Outlook or even install SquirelMail for web-based e-mail
with good admin control. Either way your software licence fees are NIL.

Check out the articles at <A HREF="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-">http://www.linuxworld.com/site-</A>
stories/2001/0823.xterminal.html for a pretty good How-To...

&gt; Installation and teaching is not a problem at this time, just what
&gt; packages might be the best available solutions.

If this is the case, then a Linux thin-client solution would be well worth
consideration - installation and admin support you could teach or
outsource - whatever, the support required for Linux is always less than
than for similar scale MS.

Good luck with the install.

David

&gt; I am quoting on providing 10 new computers to a local neighbourhood
&gt; community house.
&gt;
&gt; While they will more than likely require a Microsoft based solution I
&gt; would like to offer them an OpenSource solution so they can be aware of
&gt;  the money and opportunities they are disregarding.
&gt;
&gt; The machines I am suggesting to them will be running either Intel
&gt; Celeron 1.7 G or AMD XP Palomino 1600+ chips with 40G drives, 17"
&gt; monitors and 256 Meg SDRAM memory.
&gt;
&gt; I am suggesting they install the XP Pro OS (as they are to be networked
&gt;  with network Internet and printer etc) and running the Office XP Small
&gt;  Business suite.
&gt;
&gt; Can you help me put up a package of OpenSource software appropriate to
&gt; a community house and teaching complete learners?
&gt;
&gt; At this stage I was thinking of StarOffice 6, Red Hat 7.3 and anything
&gt; else that might be appropriate.
&gt;
&gt; Installation and teaching is not a problem at this time, just what
&gt; packages might be the best available solutions.
