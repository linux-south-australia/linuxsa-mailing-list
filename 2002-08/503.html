Here is a message I posted in the Linuxforum in Compuserve.

<A HREF="http://go.compuserve.com/linuxforum">http://go.compuserve.com/linuxforum</A>

It appears, and I may be wrong, that customers with more expensive a
Compuserve "classic" account will be able to use compuserve in Linux.
However, compuserve does not advertise this AFAIK. In fact, it appears
that compuserve is tyring to get people to switch from the classic
accounts to the Compuserve 2000 accounts. It also seems that Compuserve
is being closed down in the UK, leaving some Linux users there out to
dry. I don't know about other plavces.

This concerns me, especially since I spend a significant amount of my
free time doing various acrobatics to help Linux desktop users have the
same options as Windblowz users do.

So, it angers me to see that the home page for compuserve appears to be
another dead end for Linux users, when in fact, a mechanism exists for
Linux to use Compuserve as a way to get Internet Access.

Why not offer these classic accounts to linux users?

Anyway, and with that background, here is a post I made in the
compuserve linuxforum I made today:

 &gt; Hi -
 &gt;
 &gt; Thank you for asking.
 &gt;
 &gt; I now realize that there is an issue of internet access.
 &gt;
 &gt; Now that this is more of an issue of basic internet access and not of
 &gt; concept, I should provide some caveats.
 &gt;
 &gt; 1. Access to AOL via dial up/telephone modem has not been tested
 &gt; AFAIK. I have provided a link to the only other documented use of AOL
 &gt; in Linux below, of course, AFAIK
 &gt;
 &gt; 2. I am running AOL from a LAN that already has access to the
 &gt; Internet. I don't know if this is a requirement or not. Anyway, to
 &gt; answer the question specifically, I already have a local IP number
 &gt; that I use to access the Internet before I click on the AOL Icon to
 &gt; use AOL.
 &gt;
 &gt; 3. AOL does not appear to be completely functional or stable. I can't
 &gt; do searches, and there are times when the program will just "die."
 &gt;
