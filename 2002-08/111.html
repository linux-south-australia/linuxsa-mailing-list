&gt;All my M$ Gurus have said, "Oh, that's Unix printing, thats not the way
&gt;to do it in Windoze, we don't know..."

Figures.....kinda goes like "Oh, that's Unix printing, sorry, as far as
we know there's no command line in Windows so you won't be able to 
configure that...."


&gt;O.K. my problem is I wish to share a printer on W2k.
&gt;Using SMB sharing absolutely no-brainer, however, the machine hosting
&gt;the printer wants a userid & password for every client connected to it
&gt;that matches the clients W2k local logon.

What you said, it a PITA for administration.  I'm curious, why are you 
connecting to the printer queue on the workstation?  Do you have an SMB
based 
server (NT or Samba)?  If so, you'd be better off sharing the printers
on the Win2k workstation, then make sure you have Unix Print Services 
running on the workstation, then set up a queue on the server and point
it to the shared printer on the workstation via LPR.

 PRN--W2K Client--&gt;LPR&lt;--QUEUE--PDC


&gt;Q1:
&gt;In W2k, is it possible to make an "unsecured" SMB print share?

You could change the permissions on the printer and give everyone and/or
guest access to print to it.


&gt;Q2:
&gt;If the above is not possible, could I make an "unsecured" network
&gt;printer resource by using lpd on the PC hosting the printer?

See above re: Unix Print Services, you could connect directly to the 
workstation print share via LPR, tho it's an administration nightmare
if all your printer queues are workstation based, much easier in an SMB
network to set them up on the server (depends on how many workstations 
you've got as to which way you go of course)


&gt;Q3:
&gt;Am I correct in saying that lpd does not support multiple incoming
&gt;streams from different clients, whereas SMB does?

You've got me there, I'd be curious to know myself :)


&gt;This could be problem if there are many people trying to print to the
&gt;printer simultaneously. Unless the print-timeout is long, people's
&gt;print jobs may time-out, causing an error message.

We have no problems with multiple print jobs from different clients going 
through our server based queues to the LPR printer on a W2k workstation.
