<H1>AOL 5 Works in Linux</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
A copy of what I posted on the Lindows.com Board:

First, I want to say that I am not "for" or "against" AOL being in 
Linux. This is just information.

I give all of the credit to Tina Gasperson, who posted her article at 
Newsforge on April 19, 2002.

AOL 5 Works fairly well, it will "just die" once in a while, and I 
haven't checked out all of the features within it yet. I just did this 
about an hour ago.

Anyway, I found this article at NewsForge:

<A HREF="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/04/19/0053224.shtml?tid">http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/04/19/0053224.shtml?tid</A>=5

I then found a blue AOL CD labeled "America Online's X-tra 7.0 1000 
Hours Free! For 45 Days. BTW - I have no problem making a copy for 
Lindows.com, or maybe a few people to "spread the burden."

When I mounted the drive, I noticed it had a variety of subdirectories 
labeled AOL30, AOL40, AOL50, AOL50B, AOL50NT, AOL60, AOL70 and AOLTECH.

Seeing that I had AOL 5 in the AOL50 directory, the next thing I did was 
subscribe to Wine X ($5 a month), and I got their RPM file and installed 
Winex.

After that, I went to a Windows 98 Machine and obtained a copy of 
WSOCK32.DLL, and copied it into the /home/james/.transgaming/c_drive 
directory.

I then insterted the blue AOL CDROM drive and went into the shell.

I typed mount /media/cdrom (This is SuSE, others may use /mnt/cdrom)

I then typed the following at the shell:

cd /media/cdrom

cd aol50

winex SETUP32.EXE

After a momentary pause, but some hard drive action, a dialogue box 
comes up and asks you if you are a current member or not.

EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT A MEMBER, I CHOSE CURRENT MEMBER, AND CLICKED ON 
NEXT - SAVES A LOT OF TIME!!

Next I said CREATE AN ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR THIS COMPUTER.

The install went fairly fast, and AOL was even nice enough to give me an 
icon that starts AOL. It also put a small AOL symbol on the bottom right 
of my KDE desktop.

The rest is a normal AOL install, so I won't go into too much detail.

James Leone
