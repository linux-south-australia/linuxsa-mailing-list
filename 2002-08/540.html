James, 

just a clarification.

&gt; It also seems that Compuserve is being closed down in the UK, leaving 
some Linux users there out to dry. I don't know about other places.
&gt;

No. The CompuServe UK Division has only closed down the CompuServe 2000 
accounts, of which there were very few. CompuServe Classic accounts 
(the same accounts available in America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand 
and many other parts of the world) are still available and in wide use 
across the UK (Over 300K at last count).

CompuServe 2000 is basically a rebadged AOL account, latest version is 
CompuServe 7 matching pretty well the AOL version 7 except that it is 
running Gecko as its browser. I should add that CompuServe has been a 
Division of AOL since a couple of years back.

The US is swinging a lot of its weight to the CompuServe 2K accounts as 
it is aimed at "chatter" type users as against the more computer savvy 
Classic users. Very similar to Linux/BSD users as compared to the 
average Fisher-Price (XP) users.

Linux users can access almost every CompuServe Forum through the Public 
Access web view, needing only an AOL/AOL IM/Netscape IM/CompuServe IM  
account to get accepted. The main requirement is that their browser 
MUST be able to handle JavaScript as that is the engine behind all the 
web pages and Forum access. So long as the Linux user's browser can run 
that then they have the potential to access CompuServe.

To those folks wondering why the fuss, CompuServe is one of the oldest 
public access networks around, over 35 years, and still has a great 
deal to offer those looking for decent conversations and honest helpful 
people. Very similar to the membership on this list.

Anybody wanting to know more are welcome to contact me off-list.

Cheers,  Ian
