&gt;K3b is a pretty good program, it's at version 0.7x so not entirely finished, 
&gt;but it's got a lot of potential and works very well at the moment (latest 
&gt;build uses KDE3, looks very nice). The guy has put a lot of effort into CD 
&gt;ripping (and is adding DVD ripping), and it can do burns on the fly etc. The 
&gt;rpm i downloaded for Mandrake doesn't include support for mp3 or ogg (only 
&gt;wav), but i think that's a compile time option mandrake left out (the website 
&gt;says it handles mp3, ogg no probs). It also attempts to set up permissions 
&gt;for cdrecord etc with a nice wizard, which didn't exactly work for me until i 
&gt;logged in as root completely (then i could log in as a user and use it fine).
&gt;Worth a try anyway..

&gt;P.S: The author's aim was a Nero for linux, so he has the same goals as u i 
&gt;guess! :)

&gt;&gt;Hi all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Need some advice here. I'm looking for a nero like replacement for cd
&gt;&gt;burning. X-CD-roast keeps on failing (at the reading stage). Basically i
&gt;&gt;wont to be able to do a simple direct copy of a music cd (backup my cds
&gt;&gt;for use in the car) as well as the usual backup stuff.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It needs to be simple for "non linux" users and preferable stable. Any
&gt;&gt;tools that people use out there. (basically i just want an insert
&gt;&gt;original cd , now insert blank cd solution)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Or isn't linux burning at that stage yet and i should put the burner in
&gt;&gt;my win2k box.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ta
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
