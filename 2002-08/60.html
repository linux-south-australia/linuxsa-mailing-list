James!

&gt; Well now's my time to chime in I guess.  Everybody has their own
&gt; preferences, but here is mine:

They do, however...

&gt; Although most Linux distributions can end up doing the same things with
&gt; some work. Even though Red Hat is mentioned a lot, it doesn't have an
&gt; attractive desktop or the reiser file system by default, and I have
&gt; found that setting up local IP's is pointlessly more difficult than it
&gt; has to be.

What is unattractive about Gnome 1.4? And the latest versions of RedHat
have ext3 as a file system by default; it is a journalling filesystem
and it can ba a full journalling filesystem if you want it to be. I
don't know what is so difficult about setting up local IP addresses or
why it's pointless...

I just setup a whole classroom of 24 RedHat machines with static IP
addresses. The only time I had trouble was when I brought two
192.168.0.14 machines up and couldn't work out what was causing havoc --
user error.

&gt; So, I would definitely give them SuSE Linux for the following reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. It installs fast, and is easy and attractive to use.
&gt; 
&gt; Has a "control center" that allows you to add packages.

RedHat do lack this "control center".

&gt; On my system I had no problem with:
&gt; 
&gt;     * Sound/speakers
&gt;     * Setting up the monitor
&gt;     * Detecting my CDROM burner
&gt;     * Using an Iomega Zip Drive
&gt;     * Setting up the printer

A friend of mine with a LapTop found that RedHat 7.3 behaved itself
better than SuSe 7.X (a modern version, I can't recall which). Mileage
may vary.

&gt; 2. Fast booting file system.
&gt; 
&gt; SuSE's default file system, called "Reiser," can recover from a sudden
&gt; power failure, without a hitch.

So can ext3 and XFS and JFS...

&gt; 3. Availability of Windows applications through Codeweavers Cross Over
&gt; Office
&gt; 
&gt; Available:
&gt; 
&gt;                 Microsoft Office 2000 (Word, Excel & Power Point are
&gt; supported)
&gt;                 Lotus 123 97
&gt;                 Lotus Organizer
&gt;                 Adobe Acrobat 5
&gt;                 Peachtree Complete 8.0 (Fixed Assets & Accounting)
&gt;                 Internet Explorer 5.5
&gt;                 Quicktime
&gt;                 Windows Media Player
&gt;                 An abundance of games from WineX2 (transgaming.com)

Does a licence for that come with the fully paid for SuSe Distribution?

&gt; 5. Native Linux applications - high quality
&gt; 
&gt;                 CDBake Oven
&gt;                 MTV Media Player
&gt;                 LyX - (makes
&gt;                 Bochs (Virtual PC for Linux)
&gt;                 VNC (Remote Desktop Control)
&gt;                  Samba for your server (An easy to use guide is at:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.bigbutton.com.au/~gossner/curriculum/docs/easysamba/easysamba2-db3.1/index.html">http://www.bigbutton.com.au/~gossner/curriculum/docs/easysamba/easysamba2-db3.1/index.html</A>)
&gt;                 Spam Assassin on each local station (I will send you
&gt; instructions)

SuSe used to be known for the distribution with the most packages.

&gt; 6. Immunity to Viruses

Is this because of SuSe or Linux?

&gt; 7. Ability to clone Windows system
&gt; 
&gt;         Create a folder on desktop and call it "my computer" pick an
&gt; icon that looks like a computer. Create a link to URL and
&gt;         call it C:, point the url to the / directory. Cut and paste CD
&gt; and floppy icons and rename them A:/ and D:/
&gt; 
&gt;         Create a link to application on the desktop and call it "my
&gt; network places" and point it to Linneighborhood
&gt; 
&gt;         All of the Wine applications can be run from an icon placed on
&gt; the desktop. Wine applications are started from an icon with the
&gt; following syntax in the execute line in the icon:
&gt; 
&gt; "/home/username/cxoffice/bin/wine"  "C:\Peachw\peachw.exe" --

That is work that one has to do...
 
&gt; 8. A very helpful and knowledgeable Linux Community.

Not SuSe specific...
