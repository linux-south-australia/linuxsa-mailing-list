 &gt;I've managed to get MYOB6 Premier running under Codeweavers Wine
 &gt;Preview
 &gt;6.  The installer wouldn't seem to work, but after playing around with
 &gt;it for a while I can run Myobp.exe (copied from a Windows machine) -
 &gt;unfortunately it seems to need a few proprietary DLLs.
 &gt;
 &gt;There are, of course, still a few glitches.  Is anyone here using or
 &gt;has
 &gt;set up MYOB in an open source environment?

Jordan,

I recently tested it out (v10?) - I don't use it but I am trying to get 
Dad to try linux. Anyway, I also had problems with the installer, but I 
had set up wine to use an existing win partition, so I installed it 
under windows (98se) and then it seemed to run ok under wine - but I 
didn't do an exhaustive test, just started it up and created a new 
account or something. (This was standard wine that was available under 
Woody debian during the freeze I think...). So there is hope (but it is 
tainted by involving a boot into windows :p )

HTH,

Barney
