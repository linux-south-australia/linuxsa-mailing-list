Nah, they don't have 'em.
According to the xfree86.org team, support is present in CVS now, so the 
next release of XF86 will include support.

I managed to get the soundcard working (only 2 out of 6 channels function, 
but thats enuf for stereo MP3s).

Comment out the line like this:

break; /* I think this works, if not ready stop */ 

from i810_audio.c
This bypasses the error check which was triggered.

I know that seems like a bit of a kludgey thing to do, so don't try that 
on anything important and hold me responsible.
The machine hasn't crashed yet though, but its only been playing sound for 
20 minutes so i wouldn't call that a definitive test.

&gt; Have you looked for drivers on the intel site? When the 815 etc came
&gt; out, it was not supported by X and although it was kludge, the offered
&gt; an Xfree 3.3.6 server for it. Most of intels linux drivers are on their
&gt; site, but not in the stock kernel.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; just wondering if anyone has used Linux on a system based on Intel's i845 
&gt; &gt; chipset, and if so, have they managed to get any of the below working 
&gt; &gt; properly:
&gt; &gt; (Listed in descending order of preference)
&gt; &gt; ide
&gt; &gt; agpgart
&gt; &gt; usb
&gt; &gt; sound
&gt; &gt; on-board video
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; IDE and USB kinda work, if you consider 2MB/sec on a 7200 rpm drive to be 
&gt; &gt; "working".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Amusingly, this board is listed as Linux compatible on Intel's site.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The board's been out for a while, so maybe someone has got a patch or some 
&gt; &gt; tweaks to the kernel?
