Hi Ian,

First, I wanted to say that I am glad David Lloyd was there to keep me 
accurate and honest. I appreciate that. Thank you David.

:-) .

He did make some good points.


For me, (and this is just me) I found the SuSE books that came with the 
distribution to be concise, yet comprehensive. However, I am not a 
teacher, so I haven't been "in the trenches" so to speak, so I would 
have to yield to other people's opinions or knowledge about SuSE's 
literature.

All I know is that their is something called the SuSE Press that makes 
books... :-[

&gt;&gt;I would definitely give them SuSE Linux for the following reasons:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Good reasons. What is the printed documentation like? These are 
&gt;community people, many of them newbies to computing let alone to a 
&gt;Linux environment. If ( a really big IF0 I can convince the management 
&gt;committee to go down the OpenSource path I would need to be able to 
&gt;show good resources so they can be sure they can continue their classes 
&gt;and their learning opportunities.
&gt;
&gt;I know I Can get Red Hat books and Mandrake books even third-party 
&gt;books. Can I get similar for the SuSE distro?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ability to clone Windows system
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Very handy info, thanks for that, gives me some good ammo to fire at 
&gt;them &lt;G&gt;
