&gt; &gt; simple.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is nice, but it cannot address:
&gt; 
&gt; a) The inadequacies of the RPM format, but even more so:

I don't think RPM (especially versions &lt; 4.x, which is what the LSB has
stuck with as well as many distributions) has problems that most users
will notice. I think it is much better to be able to use programs like ar
and tar and gzip to look at packages as can be done with Debian .debs, but
in fact this is not much of a problem for most users. Application writers
can use librpm for manipulating the RPMs.

I don't think this argument is a compelling one for not using the RPM
format, even though I don't think it is the best.

&gt; b) The lack of quality control for packages, including package dependencies.

But this is something which has nothing to do with the RPM format at all.
A distribution whose users are used to thinking in terms of dependency
management has every incentive to get things right. As you remark, Debian
does a pretty good job of this. But so does Conectiva, which uses RPM (and
who wrote apt-rpm.) I find that Conectiva 8.0 does a very good job of
handling depenendencies. I can't see any technical reason why other
RPM-using distros shouldn't be able to do as well if only they would use
apt-rpm or something functionally similar, and if only they would state
what their philosophy is for how the packages are put together.

&gt; The latter is the main reason why package management and upgrading under 
&gt; Debian is a joy and why it sucks under the other RPM-using distros. 
&gt; Assisted by the fact that dpkg is a sane, useful packaging system, 
&gt; Debian developers will actually make sure their packages don't suck.

I think more of this is due to policy standards and a bit of discipline
than technology. And size, perhaps, in the sense that probably no company
can currently afford to pay as many application packagers as Debian
has. The quality is high. Dependency breakages in the testing distro are
rare and easily fixed, and in the stable distribution pretty much never
occur. (Incidentally it is possible to run a mixture of testing and
stable using an apt feature called pinning.)

If you think that the Debian package management tools are all wonder and
light, have a look at lists.debian.org where the developers are describe
their faults in detail and are working out how to improve things. And on a
bigger scale, the whole process of how Debian is developed and released is
going to be changed a lot according to the bloke in charge of it, Bdale
Garbee.
