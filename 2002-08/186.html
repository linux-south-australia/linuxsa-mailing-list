Hi.

Actually, one of the real issues for a new or casual user is the ability
to find packages that do a certain task. If I want an image editing
program, and have not heard of the gimp, (where have I been??) then I'm
going to be futzing around a lot in any of the distro's.

Of the distro's I've used, Mandrake has the most acessible tool for this
purpose in rpmdrake, but it's far from perfect, and updates over the net
are painful with it, because there is no progress indication. It also
crashes occasionally, and I'm sure plenty of users kill it off because it
seems to have stopped responding even though it's half way through
downloading a hdlist from the other side of the world or something.
(Hasn't Mandrake heard of rsync? There's a lot of repetitive downloading
of the same info going on with these update tools)

I loaded RedHat 7.3 the other day, and I have to say they have improved
considerably since I last gave up in disgust (7.0) The standard KDE
install works well out of the box without most of the font uglification
that seems to plague my Mandrake installs. There's still problems (USB and
IDE) on my bleeding edge motherboard, but it is way better than Mdk 8.2 on
the same hardware. apt-get for rpm works nicely, and with it, this is the
first RedHat box I have felt that I _could_ reasonably keep up to date.

Is there a local apt-gettable RedHat 7.3 repository?

Woody is next! Just need to get hold of some CD's...

Regards,

Michael

&gt; I last dived into it, and can't remember whether it does the work itself
&gt; or just fires of a series of rpm commands.
