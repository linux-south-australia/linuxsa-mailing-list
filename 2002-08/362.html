&gt; &gt; This is where more than ever the value is not in the tool but in the
&gt; &gt; processes used to create the packages. Notice that the current crop of
&gt; &gt; distros target at the most two architectures (IA32 and 64) except Debian
&gt; &gt; which does this across eleven architectures. Check what I say: SuSE,
&gt; &gt; RedHat, Mandrake, Conectiva - all of their non-Intel architectures are
&gt; &gt; either dropped or at least one version behind. 
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst that may be true for the personal/desktop versions I think
&gt; you'll find that this isn't true for releases aimed at the
&gt; enterprise/server market.

You mean, it makes more sense to regard SuSE 7.3 for pSeries or RH7.1 for
zSeries as the latest version because it is a different product, rather
than assume it is behind just because the version isn't 8.0 or 7.3
respectively?

If so, that's fair. A company server doesn't need to be up-to-the-minute
and often suffers if you try to make it so (I've got a very reliable
server that started off as Corel Linux 1.0 because that's all I happened
to have at the time, but I digress :-)

But take RH for zSeries for example - if you were motivated you could fix
some of the bugs by simply porting from RH 7.3 for Intel, which tends to
give the feeling that the zSeries port has been left behind a bit. I
haven't done much with it but I notice that there is much less packaged
software from RH. Maybe this is a slightly unfair example, because RH on
zSeries is a recent port, maybe I should be thinking about SuSE on
zSeries. Hmm, yes, with zSeries SuSE I can't think of any problems just
now that make me feel like it is out of date wrt SuSE Intel 8.0 and the
security updates have been prompt as far as I recall.

So yes, "don't get sucked in by numerology" is a good point.

PS is it just me that thinks RH on zSeries is rough?
