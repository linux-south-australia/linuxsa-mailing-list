Dial on demand is an option, however I'd like something with a little more
control, particularly so misbehaving software doesn't accidently dial the
modem.

The modem itself is next to the other computers, so it wouldn't be hard to
turn on/off the modem, but I thought that making a web-page to bing up/down
the interface wouldn't be too difficult, so since that would be a nicer (in
my opinion) solution, I'd go for that.

I was planning on trying to write my own script to do it for me if I
couldn't find anything, but I don't have the knowledge to do everything I
would have liked to do, so a pre-made solution would have been easier and
better. At least someone else thinks it is easy, so I hopefully shouldn't
have too many problems if I try myself, but I thought I'd check what's out
there.

thanks for the suggestions,
Andy
