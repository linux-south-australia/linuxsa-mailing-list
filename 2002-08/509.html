&gt; Right now it's cool to have a class C. It's a finite chunk of a finite

&gt; But when IPv6 comes around, this name value drops to near 0:
&gt; 
&gt; 	2A20:0000:0000:0000:C13D:2120:0000:A180
&gt; 
&gt;               or even
&gt; 
&gt; 	2A20::C13D:2120:0:A180
&gt; 
&gt; Hardly 'off the top of your head' material is it?

For the moment, that's the case. I'm sure when IPv4 was first introduced, people complained about memorising those addresses (which may have something to do with the introduction of DNS). After people get the hang of them, they'll start to remember them. It was the same when we went from 6 digit phone numbers to 7 to 8.

I'm sure most people don't just remember The IP Address. I'd suggest that people would look at the IP address in two parts - the prefix, and the suffix[1]. For example, the IP address 192.168.0.1 on a private LAN might be remembered as the prefix (all of the machines on this particular LAN start with 192.168.) and the unique bit on the end (the "0.1" bit).

Anyway, whilst I agree that IPv6 addresses would be more painful to remember, I think most people will eventually get over it :-)

thx,
Matt


[1] I've avoided using the terms 'network address' and 'node address' because they don't necessarily have to be. The subnet mask for the example I gave could easily be either 255.255.0.0, 255.255.128.0 .... you get the idea
