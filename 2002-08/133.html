I am doing all of this hard work for one purpose:

To do the same thing to Microsoft that Mini-Me does to the World Court 
in "Goldmember."

(BTW - Goldmember wasn't that great IMHO)

&gt;&gt; First, I want to say that I am not "for" or "against" AOL being in 
&gt;&gt; Linux. This is just information.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Okay, fair enough, it doesn't bother me either way whether or not an 
&gt; AOL client of some sort should or should not exist which works under 
&gt; Linux; I just don't care. And I'm sure someone will find this 
&gt; information useful in some way, shape or form, so I don't want to 
&gt; belittle the efforts you and Tina Gasperson put in, but for the love 
&gt; of $DIETY, why?
&gt;
&gt; It is a hell of a lot of work to go through just to get something up 
&gt; and running that already exists on the target platform: namely access 
&gt; to the Internet via a modem connection. There's a gazillion ISPs out 
&gt; there that provide an equivalent service to AOL's, that uses a 
&gt; standard means of connecting to their service, doesn't come encumbered 
&gt; with all the crud that AOL inflicts upon it's users, and Just Works 
&gt; under Linux.
&gt;
&gt; It seems like going to all the effort to get the Windows version of 
&gt; Quake 1 running under Linux, when there's already a Linux native 
&gt; version of Quake 3, or running up the Win3.11 File Manager in a 
&gt; virtual machine under OS/2 to do some file management, when you could 
&gt; have done it using the WPS. (Heh!)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, it would seem to me that anyone proficient wnough to get this 
&gt; working under Linux would be at a level such that they see through and 
&gt; hence don't need AOL's "value-adds", and so wouldn't need the client 
&gt; running under Linux in the first place.
&gt;
&gt; So, to satisfy all the pragmaticists in today's audience, or maybe 
&gt; just me... why go to all the effort?
