&gt; From reading the web site, my understanding of this is that the clean
&gt; folks are offering to:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) License clean to you under the LGPL if you are not a commercial
&gt;    entity.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) License clean to you under another undisclosed license if you are a
&gt;    commercial entity.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe that there is anything wrong with this - they are free
&gt; to license their source code under whatever conditions they desire to
&gt; whomever they choose.

If you are correct, then I think they are in the wrong according to
clause 8 of the LGPL ("incompatible sublicensing"). Alternatively, even if
somehow they can get away with such a clause, they cannot impose it on
anyone else, which means that some other website certainly offer Clean
under the LGPL with no other restrictions or addenda.

See <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/licenses/lgpl.html</A> and look at

It might also help to think of it this way: anything published under the
LGPL may be converted to the GPL in a one-time conversion (clause 3 of the
LGPL.) The GPL is well-enough understood that most people can probably see
that limiting users to non-commercial entities is simply not possible. So
I cannot see any way to make this condition stick even if it is allowed in
the first place, which I doubt.
