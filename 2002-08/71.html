Hi David,

&gt; would welcome the opportunity to save
&gt; funds on infrastructure and technology costs.
&gt;
But how often that welcome is contingent on staying within the MS world 
&lt;sigh&gt;

&gt; Why not suggest a Linux-based thin client solution - you can use
&gt; 486's/Pentiun 100's (with minimum spec) or thereabouts as the terminals
&gt; with only one of your high spec machines for the server.
&gt;
With latest versions of Redhat or Manduck the systems would run like they 
were powered by molasses.

I wont demo any Linux on a system not running at least a 400 Pentium. The 
watchers will simply walk away saying things like "pathetic" etc.

&gt; perhaps e-mail or you could use Evolution -
&gt; the Linux clone of Outlook or even install SquirelMail for web-based e-mail
&gt;

Wont be ANY emailing. Most of the time this computer suite will be used for 
teaching basic computer usage to newbies, that is why it has to run well and 
be user^H^H^H^Hfool proof. Also why it needs to have a very good office 
suite, even to be able to run MS Office if possible.

What do you think about the CodeWeaver's package?

10 user licenses are US$500.  That will allow them to keep their Office 97 
and run it under Linux.

&gt; your software licence fees are NIL.
&gt;
If I get Red Hat / Mandrake in boxes I get the printed documentation which 
makes it easier to train others to maintain the system.

Thanks for the suggestions.

Cheers, Ian
