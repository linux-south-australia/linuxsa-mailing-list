&gt; &gt; apt for Redhat.
&gt; &gt; simple.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Which is nice, but it cannot address:
&gt; 
&gt; a) The inadequacies of the RPM format, but even more so:
&gt; b) The lack of quality control for packages, including package dependencies.
&gt; 
&gt; The latter is the main reason why package management and upgrading under
&gt; Debian is a joy and why it sucks under the other RPM-using distros.
&gt; Assisted by the fact that dpkg is a sane, useful packaging system,
&gt; Debian developers will actually make sure their packages don't suck.

First I have to say I learned linux on slackware and was pretty one-eyed
about it for a long time, even though I did try out several other
distro's too. But a little while ago I (for reasons I wont go into) was
forced to install Redhat 7.1 and was very pleasantly surprised at the
increase of usability and user friendliness. 

I have now upgraded this to Redhat 7.2 and then to Redhat 7.3 with total
ease and without the slightest effort or pain using the apt-get for
Redhat available from <A HREF="http://apt.freshrpms.net">http://apt.freshrpms.net</A>
Also installing most of the commonly available software for Redhat linux
is now as simple as apt-get install blah. I regularly run either up2date
-u or apt-get upgrade to keep my Redhat system completely up to date
with ALL the very latest Redhat packages and security fixes. I dont see
why rpm's suck at all. I have no problems whatsoever. I even use alien
to convert packages from one format to another without a single problem.

I believe this negates the whole argument about debian's perceived
advantages over other distro's. Even Mandrake has urpmi which is another
tool for automatically resolving dependancies. In this race at least I
think it is actually slackware that is lagging behind in user
friendliness for upgrading the installed software.

And finally the most convincing argument is that Redhat not only has all
you need and more, but is also more widely known and supported by the
linux community and support channels everywhere, and has very simple
command line or gui admin tools. Of all the distro's Redhat has to be
one of the easiest to use and maintain except for possibly Mandrake.
