Speaking of domains and hostnames..
A group of people including myself have been using shells on a box hosted at
an ISP for a few years now. Having a permanently accessible machine with your
email etc upon it becomes quite valuable after you've got used to having it.

Anyway, this particular ISP told us, yesterday, that we had until tomorrow
close of business to either move to a much more expensive plan and pay a setup
cost on top of this, or else remove the box altogether. We probably can't
afford the new rates.

I haven't seen any of the other users post to LinuxSA yet, so I thought I'd
ask here if anyone has any advice about other places (perhaps intl?) that
might offer good Linux/FreeBSD shell & domain hosting, or else people who
might be able to offer to either

a) host a few domains and shell accounts on one of their machines, in return
   for a small fee.
or
b) host the entire machine, again for some moderate fee.

Katie and Tim know more about the details (eg. average b/w use, etc), and I
haven't had a chance to get this stuff off them yet, but I thought i'd ask
around now, since we've only got a day or so to make a decision. &gt;:/

thanks,
Toby

&gt; yes, that's what I've been vaguely wondering in this discussion:
&gt; who cares about the actual IP address(es)?
&gt; that's what you have domains and hostnames for.
