Trust me, the easiest way to get wine to work is to go straight to the
CVS. I havnt tryed vanilla wine for a while, Ive been doing the cvs
thing with wineX, with the added advantage that you can play a lot of
windows games with it. I just checked the site, and it supports warcraft
3 100% now (among others).

&lt;<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id</A>=17631&gt;

Just go to that link, follow the instructions and do the ./configure ;
make && make install thing.

I have had troubles with one of the openGL header files missing, but
that stuff must just be somewhere else, because I put a // at the start
of the #include and then it all worked great. Ive heard about so many
problems with the pre-packaged versions, I wouldnt bother.

&gt; I'm trying to see if I can get a late (ish) version of wine 20020327-1 and

&gt; like list of dependancy problems - I've worked these down to a requirement
&gt; for "libcrypto.so.2" and "libssl.so.2" both of which are provided by
&gt; "openssl 0.9.6b-8". When I try to install this I get a string of errors of
&gt; the form:"libcrypto.so.1 is needed by ......." - in other words to install
&gt; this package I need to uninstall my existing openssl package, which I
&gt; presume will break the 20 odd other listed installations.
&gt; 
&gt; Have I got this right?
&gt; Is my only option to install ADSL and spend the next month downloading and
&gt; installing packages? - maybe it would be cheaper to pay "Uncle Bill" his
&gt; computer tax and install Windoze :-(. This would annoy the kids - they are
&gt; linux believers - and, besides not withstanding the doubters of the recent
&gt; "Creator of Enlightenment says..." thread I would prefer to have linux on
&gt; my desktop.
&gt; 
&gt; Please help me with this!
