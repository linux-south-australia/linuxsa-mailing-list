&gt;In your research did you find any similar files available to Australian 
&gt;residents (the home of this list and the majority of it's readers)?
&gt;  
&gt;

There are pdf files available at the ATO, but I don't know if they have 
what is called "fill in forms."
When I found these type of forms at the U.S. tax office, it made a big 
difference because we may be able to fill the forms in with the program.

I hope that there are "fill in" forms at the ATO. More on that later.




I will give a try at running the program under wine. I am assuming that 
it won't register me as an electronic filer the moment I execute it.

&gt;I know we can download the free and excellent e-Tax program from 
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.ato.gov.au">http://www.ato.gov.au</A>   but that only runs on a Windows platform. There 
&gt;might also be problems with the authentication module that allows an 
&gt;Australian taxpayer to submit their tax form electronically. It is 
&gt;probably restricted to the same Windows platform.
&gt;  
&gt;

The tenforty project is just starting up, but this is what my hopes are 
for it, despite the fact that I am not doing the programming:

1. The core of the program will be like a kernel, and will include the 
more universal types of calculations. For example, both the U.S. and 
Australia want to know what total wages are.


 2. A "conf" type of file will configure the "kernel" into almost any 
country's tax preraration program that will generate text output for 
automated insertion into the "fill in forms."

What are the rules...

The guy that works on the kernel works for everybody. However, each 
country at a bare bone minimum will have to have its own CPA to 
interpret its country's tax rules to help the programmer to work the 
conf file and tax forms. At full strength, I hope that this project will 
have individual cpa firms maintaining individual forms or parts of them, 
or being responsible for parts of the conf file in each country.  That 
way the project will fall under the "savings is greater than the cost" 
category.

So, if anybody wants to work on this thing, we would be happy to have 
help. :-)

&gt;Wonder if it will run under Wine etc? Anybody tried it?
