K3b is a pretty good program, it's at version 0.7x so not entirely finished, 
but it's got a lot of potential and works very well at the moment (latest 
build uses KDE3, looks very nice). The guy has put a lot of effort into CD 
ripping (and is adding DVD ripping), and it can do burns on the fly etc. The 
rpm i downloaded for Mandrake doesn't include support for mp3 or ogg (only 
wav), but i think that's a compile time option mandrake left out (the website 
says it handles mp3, ogg no probs). It also attempts to set up permissions 
for cdrecord etc with a nice wizard, which didn't exactly work for me until i 
logged in as root completely (then i could log in as a user and use it fine).
Worth a try anyway..

P.S: The author's aim was a Nero for linux, so he has the same goals as u i 
guess! :)

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Need some advice here. I'm looking for a nero like replacement for cd
&gt; burning. X-CD-roast keeps on failing (at the reading stage). Basically i
&gt; wont to be able to do a simple direct copy of a music cd (backup my cds
&gt; for use in the car) as well as the usual backup stuff.
&gt;
&gt; It needs to be simple for "non linux" users and preferable stable. Any
&gt; tools that people use out there. (basically i just want an insert
&gt; original cd , now insert blank cd solution)
&gt;
&gt; Or isn't linux burning at that stage yet and i should put the burner in
&gt; my win2k box.
