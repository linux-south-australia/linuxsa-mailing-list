you can can configure it so that

1. it turns green on all clients
2. it turns green on somme clients but not others
3. only your client turns green

the connection status is connect to a user name that the client uses (this
does not need to be validated but can be). If the clients have the same user
name then they will go up and down together.

the interface (ppp0) will stay up as long as there is a client that is
"green" but can be configured so that a user can overide and disconnect all
clients

&gt; Tell me, with this program does it turn green on all windows clients, and
&gt; what happens if someone is still using the connection and someone
&gt; tries and
&gt; closes it.

&gt; I use a package call alt-connect its based on connectd both can
&gt; be found on
&gt; freshmeat. Alt connect is basically a connection control daemon.
&gt; You send in
&gt; a connection request with a client and it brings up the interface (in your
&gt; case ppp0). The bonus is that it has a great windows client that has a
&gt; pretty little picture in your task bar, red light for off, green light for
&gt; on. To connect you just double click on the red light, to disconnect you
&gt; double click on the green light, my parent have no problemss :-)
&gt;
&gt; You can use protection methods if you want (but you dont)
&gt;
&gt; Great package find it at

&gt; Subject: remote ppp0 control
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm setting up a gateway to control ppp0 (56k modem). It needs to be easy
&gt; enough for my parents to use, so having to ssh in, su to root and
&gt; do a 'ifup
&gt; ppp0' is not really appropriate. I think it's possible to allow users to
&gt; control ppp0, but I'd prefer something even easier.
&gt;
&gt; I was thinking a simple script on a web server would be good.
&gt; It'd obviously
&gt; be simple to make a PHP page to do the ifup/ifdown, but I'd like something
&gt; smarter, if possible. Something that could detect if ppp0 was
&gt; already up and
&gt; if so display connection time and bytes in/out would be fantastic.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of any packages that can do this type of thing? I'd like
&gt; something that isn't password protected (I'll set up iptables
&gt; rules so only
&gt; 10.0.1.x can use it), so I can set up the home page of IE to the web page,
&gt; so it's really, really easy to connect/disconnect.
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Andy
