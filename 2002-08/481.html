Watching this thread, and considering options I have to wonder - in the
case of cd copying is it really that hard to use the command line?
Normally I wouldnt expect "normal" users to use the command line, but
the concepts seem way simper than when you use a non-intuative gui or a
buggy app.

Really, all the user needs to do is ensure cdrdao is installed, then
learn

[<A HREF="mailto:ant@ant">ant@ant</A> ant]$ cdrdao scanbus
Cdrdao version 1.1.5 - (C) Andreas Mueller &lt;<A HREF="mailto:andreas@daneb.de">andreas@daneb.de</A>&gt;
  SCSI interface library - (C) Joerg Schilling
  L-EC encoding library - (C) Heiko Eissfeldt
  Paranoia DAE library - (C) Monty

Check <A HREF="http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html">http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html</A>#dt for current driver
tables.

Using libscg version 'schily-0.5'

0,0,0: PIONEER, DVD-RW  DVR-104, 1.20  &lt;--- Your device is 0,0,0

cdrdao --help explains things including getting more help quite well.

Then:

&lt;insert source cd&gt;
cdrdao read-cd --device 0,0,0 image

&lt;insert blank cd&gt;
cdrdao write --device 0,0,0 image

optionally add:

 --speed 8 (or whatever speed you want)
 --overburn
 --simulate
 -v 1 or 2 (verbosity if interested).

That'll copy most cds OK. 

 --driver generic-mmc-raw

Will do some more copy protected cds.

Then rm image and rm data.bin

Sure, you might need something like this as a cheat sheet, but if you
gave it to an ex-windows user I'd say they'd have a pretty good change
of understanding it and getting it going.

cdrecord isnt too hard for audio either:

cdrecord dev=0,0,0 speed=8 -audio -pad -v *.wav

Can be simpler than compiling programs that dont work properly from cvs
anyway...

&gt; Tried cd bake oven, started off promising but then after it read all of my
&gt; tracks it then wrote them all as a single track!?!? think i need to do some
&gt; more reading on that one. It doesn't handle multi mode cds either, alot of
&gt; music cds now days have a data track for extra "features" (then again i dont
&gt; need the data track for my car).
&gt; 
&gt; Actually that was the only one i have been able to get to work "out of the
&gt; box" so far.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Browsing through Mandrake 9.0 beta3 release logs, kb3 ver
&gt; &gt; &gt;0.7 is now
&gt; &gt; &gt;included in the Mandrake release
&gt; &gt; &gt;actually I wouldnt have known what it was except for your prior mail
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually both cdbakeoven & k3b are part of some extra KDE packages.
&gt; &gt; They're included in the kde-extragear1 package, which I think is why both
&gt; &gt; sourceforge sites have been static for a while.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The extragear packages aren't included in the 3.0.3 release so maybe
&gt; &gt; they'll be releasing them alongside 3.1 whenever that hits the wild (could
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; wrong on this one, I haven't checked).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you're game enough try grabbing the CVS versions, there's a
&gt; &gt; small amount
&gt; &gt; of fiddling required, I managed to compile & run k3b ok, haven't
&gt; &gt; tested much of it yet, the interface is pretty good though, this
&gt; &gt; is the kind
&gt; &gt; of app that will attract some windoze users methinks.
