Hi.

Have you got a serial break-out box? What may be happening is that your
cable is set up as DTE and the printer is actually DCE. I've forgotten
what the standard cable is, but if the interface is ok, and you cannot
talk with it then this is probably the problem. 

With a break out box, you can tinker with the pinouts until the lights
come on - the main culprits are usually pins 2 and 3 - these are the
transmit and receive pins, and they get switched between DTE and DCE.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; You may be lucky enough to find a bank of DIP switches on the printer

&gt; &gt; may be an option hidden in it for displaying/changing the serial port
&gt; &gt; settings.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No LCD display, No buttons, Nothing
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Otherwise, a lot of serial devices seem to want no parity, 8 bit data, 1
&gt; &gt; stop bit: try these settings and ring the changes on the baud rate till
&gt; &gt; something works!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; It does print out a list of fonts and some interface information if I 
&gt; change the emulation setting via a wheel on the side of the printer:
&gt; 9600 baud, parity ignored
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also try google searching for lists of connectors, pinouts etc. in case
&gt; &gt; you need to make up a cable! There are lots of them and they mostly tell
&gt; &gt; you a fair bit about RS232 in the process.
&gt; 
&gt; Shouldn't it just use a standard serial cable?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I managed to find some more information on this printer - it's 
&gt; been rebadged (for Australia I guess)  Its real name is QMS (Quality 
&gt; Micro Systems) - PS800+ and its a postscript printer with emulation for 
&gt; Appletalk, HP Laser Jet and HPGL Plotter(for CAD stuff). Apparently they 
&gt; were the bees knees in 1987 when they came on the market.
&gt; But I still can't get any of my computers to talk to it either with 
&gt; Linux or windows so I'm thinking there's something wrong with the serial 
&gt; interface on the printer - guess I'll just keep working at it.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
