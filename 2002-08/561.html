&gt; Sorry guys for mentioning windows but I thought one of you might know 
&gt; this, as I think I originally found out about it looking for linux 
&gt; info... (but can't reproduce it now :p )
&gt; 
&gt; There is a GUI tool that is apparently part of the standard windows (at 
&gt; least 98se has it) install that lets you see how it's network devices 
&gt; are configured, DHCP etc. I can't for the life of me remember what it is 
&gt; called (not ipconfig). As usual for any useful MS tools, it is not 
&gt; obviously in any MS doco that I can find, and I can't define it narrowly 
&gt; enough for google to help me.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone? Anyone?
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; Barney.

As always, as soon as you ask you find it :)
It's called winipcfg.exe and is only on 95/98 but is available for 
download from M$ if you want it on NT/2000/XP (why wouldn't they include 
it? - because they are M$)

if anyone is interested:

I'll stop polluting the list now.
Barney.

PS it doesn't do what i wanted anyway. (check speed that card is running at)
