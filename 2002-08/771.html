&gt; Out of curosity, what's the quality/size of OGG vs MP3 like?
&gt; 

Well, I can't tell the difference between a CDs and "-q 10" encoded Oggs 
on my relatively phat stereo at home, which is the main reason I bother 
encoding  at -q 10 in the first place. I hate hearing the audiable 
artifacts that creep in to playback of 128kbps encoded MP3's both on my 
stereo, and even through headphones. Like I said previously, this gives 
me a file size of about 20 to 25% of the original unencoded file size, 
so -q 10 oggs are at least twice as large as typical MP3s, but giving 
effectively perfect sound reproduction. The average VBR (variable bit 
rate) of -q 10 oggs is something in the order of 360kbps, but remember, 
like CPUs, that number isn't everything.

For mid-bitrate encoded stuff (around 128kbps) Oggs give you an audio 
quality which is effectively the same, if not better than as equivalent 
encoded MP3s, but for a slightly smaller file size. Maybe an 8-10% 
reduction, instead of a fixed 10% reduction.

Xiph have a useful page up that lets you compare yourself the quality of 
several similar bitrate encoded music formats: 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/listen.html&gt">http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/listen.html&gt</A>;

&gt; I currently rip all my stuff with CDEX under windows, using LAME,
&gt; variable bitrate on a reasonably high setting.  This results in
&gt; brilliant sounding mp3's with a pretty decent file size (albums in under
&gt; 80mb or so).

Using default quality (-q 3), you'll get albums encoded for at between 
50 and 65M. At that quality, the vorbis stream will have an average VBR 
of around 128kbps. With max quality (-q 10), I get entire albums 
weighing in at around 100 to 150M.

I haven't really experimented at other quality settings, but I will say 
that I much prefer listening to Oggs encoded at -q 3 than to MP3s 
encoded at 128kbps.

HTH,
/mike.
