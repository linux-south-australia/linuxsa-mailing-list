&gt; 
&gt; &gt; BTW I rarely (almost never) use mozilla so I doubt it's the cause, and I
&gt; &gt; hate kde prefering fvwm and fvwm-themes with gnome. And the freeze has
&gt; &gt; been happening on my original RH7.1 install, RH7.2 and now I've upgraded
&gt; &gt; to RH7.3 it still happens. I'm quite convinced xscreensaver is the
&gt; &gt; culprit. I'm just not sure which of the many screensaver choices are
&gt; &gt; guilty of doing it. It's definately several of them though, but not all.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure it's not hardware related?!? - I've been hammering each RH release
&gt; since 6.2 and I don't get *any* lockups, *ever*[1].  I've got at least one of
&gt; each nearby and uptimes are in months[2].
&gt; 
&gt; [1] Ok, swap used to get exahusted and a couple of "killall mozilla"
&gt; and/or "killall nautilus" did the trick.
&gt; [2] ...just haven't kept kernel upgrades up to date :-)
&gt; 

No I'm not sure it's not hardware related, but my uptimes are in the
weeks and months when I only use screen blanking and don't use
xscreensaver. And it's only just a few of them that cause a freeze, not
all.

I dont have a problem with it though. And I don't run mozilla or
nautilus either.

P.S. Why do people insist on sending duplicate emails via CC: when it's
obvious we are all subscribed to this mailing list anyway? As if there
isn't enough spam already?
