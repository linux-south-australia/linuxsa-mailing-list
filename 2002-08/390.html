As far as I know (May be wrong) you'll have to pay for Lindows, there will
be no free for use version, and apparently some parts (especially wine)
/aren't/ open source.

They're not exactly "David's" of the opensource world.  Seems to me like the
guy's trying to cash in on the Linux and Wine world's, and not giving
anything back.

(The guy behind Lindows.com reminds me from the TV guy from the movie
"Requiem For A Dream".  I honestly have no idea why, heh.)

Subject: Lindows.com needs your help


&gt; This is an excerpt from the latest newsletter from Lindows.com. I think
&gt; all of us need to help out these guys, these "Davids" of the OpenSource
&gt; world against the "Goliaths" of the corporate absorbers.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,  Ian

&gt; Subject  Lindows.com: Michael's Minute:
&gt;
&gt; Microsoft Corp. v. Lindows.com Update
&gt;
&gt; Some of you have sent me email asking for an update on the battle with
&gt; Microsoft and wanting to know how you can help. In case you missed it,
&gt; Microsoft sued to shut down Lindows.com earlier in the year. It was a
&gt; transparent attempt to stifle the inevitable competition which Linux
&gt; represents. Their allegation was (and is) that they own the trademark
&gt; for the word "windows," maintaining that no other company should be
&gt; allowed to use the word "windows" -- not even the "indows" portion.
&gt;
&gt; Of course, there are hundreds of products and companies that use the
&gt; word "windows" - and Microsoft has never filed suit against any of
&gt; them. That's a huge clue that this suit has little to do with trademark
&gt; confusion. (If you missed any part of the proceedings to date, visit
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lindows.com/opposition">http://www.lindows.com/opposition</A> to read the court papers and
&gt; summaries.)
&gt;
&gt; Many people have congratulated us, prematurely, on our victory. While
&gt; the judicial system did block their request to shut us down, a trial is
&gt; looming for April 2003. At that time, the Judge (or jury) will decide
&gt; whether Microsoft has a valid trademark for the word "windows" and
&gt; whether the Lindows.com name is confusing. In the interim, we're moving
&gt; through the legal process where Microsoft is demanding, as part of the
&gt; discovery process, everything from our business plan to our list of
&gt; partner companies. As you can imagine, it's challenging for a 39-person
&gt; company to compete with a Goliath that has hundreds of people--just in
&gt; the legal department alone. This is where we could use a bit of help
&gt; from our community of Insiders and those on our mailing list.
&gt;
&gt; While Microsoft can outspend us with high-priced lawyers and experts,
&gt; they cannot buy history. We know, of course, that the word "windows"
&gt; had been used in the industry for years before Microsoft adopted it in
&gt; the early 1980s for the name of its windowing interface product,
&gt; Microsoft Windows 1.0. We could, however, use your help in gathering as
&gt; much evidence as possible to show the usage of the words "windows",
&gt; "window" and "windowing" before and after 1983, the date Microsoft
&gt; first filed its trademark application. If you have magazine or
&gt; newspaper articles, academic papers, journal articles, product manuals,
&gt; advertisements, textbooks, dictionaries, or anything else that uses the
&gt; terms, we'd like to hear from you. We'd also like to hear from anyone
&gt; who had personal experience in the industry during those early years
&gt; and can recall the history of the early windowing products such as
&gt; Xerox's Star, VisiCorp's VisiOn, Apple's Lisa, Digital Research's GEM,
&gt; Quarterdeck's DesQ, IBM's TopView, and others. Please email all your
&gt; findings to <A HREF="mailto:legal@lindows.com.">legal@lindows.com.</A>
&gt;
&gt; As always, thanks for all your help.
&gt;
