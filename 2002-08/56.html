Well now's my time to chime in I guess.  Everybody has their own 
preferences, but here is mine:

Although most Linux distributions can end up doing the same things with 
some work. Even though Red Hat is mentioned a lot, it doesn't have an 
attractive desktop or the reiser file system by default, and I have 
found that setting up local IP's is pointlessly more difficult than it 
has to be.

So, I would definitely give them SuSE Linux for the following reasons:


1. It installs fast, and is easy and attractive to use.

Has a "control center" that allows you to add packages.

Desktop and boot up looks attractive.

On my system I had no problem with:

    * Sound/speakers
    * Setting up the monitor
    * Detecting my CDROM burner
    * Using an Iomega Zip Drive
    * Setting up the printer

I did have a problem setting up a web camera.

I have not tried to use a Handspring visor.

2. Fast booting file system. 

SuSE's default file system, called "Reiser," can recover from a sudden 
power failure, without a hitch.


3. Availability of Windows applications through Codeweavers Cross Over 
Office

Available:

                Microsoft Office 2000 (Word, Excel & Power Point are 
supported)
                Lotus 123 97
                Lotus Organizer
                Adobe Acrobat 5
                Peachtree Complete 8.0 (Fixed Assets & Accounting)
                Internet Explorer 5.5
                Quicktime
                Windows Media Player
                An abundance of games from WineX2 (transgaming.com)
               
4. Ported Windows Applications:

                Real One Player for Unix
                Adobe Acrobat Reader 5
                Netscape Navigator 6 *email*instant message*web browse*


America On Line does not work - but I get the feeling from Lindows that 
AOL may end up porting it.


5. Native Linux applications - high quality

                CDBake Oven
                MTV Media Player
                LyX - (makes
                Bochs (Virtual PC for Linux)
                VNC (Remote Desktop Control)
                 Samba for your server (An easy to use guide is at: 
<A HREF="http://www.bigbutton.com.au/~gossner/curriculum/docs/easysamba/easysamba2-db3.1/index.html">http://www.bigbutton.com.au/~gossner/curriculum/docs/easysamba/easysamba2-db3.1/index.html</A>)
                Spam Assassin on each local station (I will send you 
instructions)

6. Immunity to Viruses

7. Ability to clone Windows system

        Create a folder on desktop and call it "my computer" pick an 
icon that looks like a computer. Create a link to URL and             
        call it C:, point the url to the / directory. Cut and paste CD 
and floppy icons and rename them A:/ and D:/

        Create a link to application on the desktop and call it "my 
network places" and point it to Linneighborhood

        All of the Wine applications can be run from an icon placed on 
the desktop. Wine applications are started from an icon with the 
following syntax in the execute line in the icon:  

"/home/username/cxoffice/bin/wine"  "C:\Peachw\peachw.exe" --

8. A very helpful and knowledgeable Linux Community.

9. And last but not least, COST:


        SuSE Linux Professional - $100 US. GPL, use it as much as you 
please. Savings so far - ($200x10)-100 = $1,900 US
        Server Operating System - SuSE Linux ($0 additional)   Savings ? 
$1,000 US ? Running total savings:     $2,900
        Cross Over Office/Plug-In bundle $600 US for 10 seats   Running 
total savings:     $2,300
        WineX $50/Year * 10 = $500                                    
    Running total savings:     $1,800
        DSL Modem - Needed to ensure Linux access to internet without 
hassle (www.cayman.com) $350 US  Running total savings:     $1,450

 10. Time Savings:

            Windows will eventually fragment its files and catch 
viruses, costing time and frustration.


Hope this was "comprehensive"

&gt;While they will more than likely require a Microsoft based solution I 
&gt;would like to offer them an OpenSource solution so they can be aware of 
&gt;the money and opportunities they are disregarding.
&gt;
&gt;The machines I am suggesting to them will be running either Intel 
&gt;Celeron 1.7 G or AMD XP Palomino 1600+ chips with 40G drives, 17" 
&gt;monitors and 256 Meg SDRAM memory.
&gt;
&gt;I am suggesting they install the XP Pro OS (as they are to be networked 
&gt;with network Internet and printer etc) and running the Office XP Small 
&gt;Business suite.
&gt;
&gt;Can you help me put up a package of OpenSource software appropriate to 
&gt;a community house and teaching complete learners?
&gt;
&gt;At this stage I was thinking of StarOffice 6, Red Hat 7.3 and anything 
&gt;else that might be appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;Installation and teaching is not a problem at this time, just what 
&gt;packages might be the best available solutions.
