&gt; I've just read the licencing information for Clean
&gt; (a functional programing language), and it says that it

&gt; purposes only.  Are you allowed to tack on an extra
&gt; condition like this under the LGPL?

You are not allowed to tack on extra conditions which are not compatible
with the [L]GPL. You may tack on conditions which are compatible, because
it then becomes a different-but-compatible license (but the copyright of
the license itself then needs some examination.) See the OpenOffice.org
license as an example, where contributions are automatically
dual-licensed.

However, regardless of the foregoing, I don't think what you quote is the
situation you describe. The words used can be interpreted in a completely
different way to mean "you can get it under the LGPL, but this isn't a
commercial license so you are restricted in what you do" which of course
can be a perfectly justifiable statement of opinion. This is the way it
reads to me, although I can see why the thought crossed your mind. I'd
suggest you contact them and ask, and if they mean what I think they do
you might be able to suggest a clearer wording to them.

Finally, whatever claims might be made on the website I think what counts
is what the license on the software says. So they might have the statement
you query on the website, but if the software has just the LGPL and there
is no other statement of any kind, then that's the situation and nobody
(including the authors) can take it back in the future although they can
stop publishing their own changes to the LGPL version.
