Of course it does! How are you expected to know when your toast is 
ready?? ;)

Seriously, I do really enjoy being able to connect directly to any of my 
machines at home from anywhere in the world. I can also host my domain, 
website and mailserver and those of several friends (using IP-address 
aliases for "real" virtual hosting), from my ADSL connection.

Of course, this is only because I was lucky enough to get a C-class 
before they ran out, but with IPv6, this obviously won't be a problem 
for everyone else.

&gt; ie: it'll probably take another dotcom boom to make it happen quickly.
&gt; 

Either that, or IP addressable mobiles become popular. As G2-1/2 (GPRS) 
and evenually G3-style technology starts becoming widespread and 
affordable, then you're going to start getting millions of new hosts 
which are going to need to be be addressable. Only IPv6 is capable of 
handling that kind of demand.

&gt; ..and I'm still getting codered scans from a year-old virus.. if that's
&gt; any indication of how quickly the entire Internet can be upgraded :)

True, but it *is* slowly happening. Most free and non-free UNIXes have 
been able to do IPv6 for ages. Even Cisco may have finally managed to 
release a production version of IOS that understands it. ;)

&gt; If ipv6 is not likely to come onto my radar for another 4 years, then
&gt; there's not much point learning about it now so I can forget it and
&gt; start again then :)

If I was a network admin for a medium to large-sized organization, I'd 
probably be going, but I'm not, so I can't justify the time or the cost 
of the AARNet workshop. However, if LinuxSA puts on a meeting dealing 
with this subject then I'd be very tempted by that.. For some reason, 
I've always wanted to join the 6Bone, probably so I can *finally* get to 
the IPv6 mirror of www.freebsd.org.
