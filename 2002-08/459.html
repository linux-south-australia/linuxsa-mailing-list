Does my toaster *really* need to be visible to the outside world? :)

I can also imagine being a little upset about having to throw away
switches that cost many thousands of dollars, because their hardware
ASIC's only know about 32 bit addresses :/

ie: it'll probably take another dotcom boom to make it happen quickly.

..and I'm still getting codered scans from a year-old virus.. if that's
any indication of how quickly the entire Internet can be upgraded :)

&gt; &gt; There still seem to be a lot of protocols and software that just don't
&gt; &gt; care about IPv6 (by using things like a 4 byte value for address) and
&gt; &gt; this lack of accomodation makes it look like not many people are taking
&gt; &gt; it seriously.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK most of the common apps and utils out there are IPv6 enabled, it's
&gt; usually the more esoteric ones that can't. For example, Bind (v9?)
&gt; Apache, Sendmail, Cyrus and Mozilla can all do IPv6, so what else do you
&gt; need?

Well, a methodology for accounting IPv6 traffic would be a nice start
from a service provider's point of view. Most radius servers seem to
have ignored the IETF-draft specs for IPv6, and Cisco only just last
month released a spec for netflow v9 that can deal with ipv6 accounting.
I can't see anything that suggests that the V9 netflow is in any
publicly available IOS release either.

I hope I don't come across as too pessimistic, I like the idea of making
life more interesting with IPv6. I'm really fishing for a good reason to
take the time to go to the AARNET workshop :)

If ipv6 is not likely to come onto my radar for another 4 years, then
there's not much point learning about it now so I can forget it and
start again then :)
