Welcome to the list BTW and welcome to Linux.

About pre-installation reading. If you have a copy of RedHat with the
manual, you should have enough to safely install it.  If not, then the
manual will probably be on your Redhat CD.

You can find lots of (in fact too much) documentation at
	<A HREF="http://www.wsc.monash.edu.au/LDP/">http://www.wsc.monash.edu.au/LDP/</A>
which is a mirror of the Linux Documentation Project.

You will find that most of the 'Classic' Linux docs at this site like the
"Installation and Getting Started guide", 
"System's Administrators Guide" and the
"Network Administrators Guide", contain a lot of information.

They won't however be written with your distribution of Linux in mind.

Use your Redhat manual for detailed information about setting up your
system and the other docs as more of an overview. The Installation and
Getting started Guide has a lot to say about installation but it is
written for the Slackware distribution of Linux. It does however contain
lots of other invaluable information to a newcomer to Linux.

There has never been a problem with the amount of linux documentation,
just the ability of the authors to write something that a newcomer can
parse :-)

Redhat has an "install mailing list" too if you're interested. Details
will be at <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">http://www.redhat.com/</A>
 
&gt; Allow me to introduce myself momentarily.  I am a 36 y.o.
&gt; male, living in Adelaide's northern suburbs.  I am currently
&gt; studying for a Bachelor of Computing through Distance
&gt; Education at Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria.  I only
&gt; started last year, although I have previously completed
&gt; quite a bit of the Dip. of IT at TAFE.
