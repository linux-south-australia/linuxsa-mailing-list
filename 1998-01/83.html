Hello all,

Time to start a thread.

Following Netscape's announcement of the GPLish license that
Netscape are going to have with Communicator 5, I thought
I would add some coals to the thinking fire.

I am sure that most people who use Linux and Free Software
have probably encountered themselves or have heard of 
people rejecting software with the words along the
lines of 
	'I can't trust my business on freeware'.

Apart from the problem that Free Software has with
being called freeware, there is a perceived problem with
the legitimacy of Free Software.

Most people who reject free software most likely came
from DOS or Windows circles where free software was 
either freeware or shareware and typically had one person
working on the program.

Trying not to offend any freeware authors a lot of 
freeware is either junk or not of the quality that a lot
of people want to use.  

Now with companies such as Netscape moving towards free 
software and other companies putting back in to free software
the markets the acceptance of Free Software is beginning to 
come of age.

Next time someone gives you the above response you can
turn to them and say...

	'Have you used Netscape Communicator 5.0?'
	
If you get a no (D'OH!) then you can ask them if they
have heard of it.

If you get a yes then you can tell them that that too
is free software.  Should they stop using it because
they can't trust their freeware?  Or if they use Unix
should they not use gzip, emacs or tcsh?  

You would most likely find that they would say that 
it's just different.  Well it is not.

There is high quality free software.  The person hours
put into free software rivals that of some of the
bigger commercial products.  They are typically
tested on a wider audience and bugs are fixed relatively
quickly if you want them.

It is my sincere hope that large software vendors
take notice of the Free Software Paradigm.  The days will
come where free software will an acceptable solution.

Just remember that Free Software is not only monetarily
free.  The true essense of free software is *FREEDOM*,
to do as you want with the software.

That is my little essay, did it get anyone enthused?

Matt
