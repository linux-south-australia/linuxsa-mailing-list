Mael,

I've done a few NFS installs and they can be tricky.  A few things I
learnt the hard way,

Check your network card is actually being recognized and used.  Do this
carefully, sometimes it may look OK but is not correct.

ALWAYS specify the IP address of the computer to mount via NFS.  You can
check if your computers 'see' each other by pinging from the already
installed computer.

Check that you have set your exports file correctly on the 'NFS server'.
simplest way is to set it to allow *anyone* access to that dir/CD
whatever.  I would have to dig up the exact line in the file if you
needed it.

If using a CD, check that you have it mounted ;-)


Hope this helps..


Chris

&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, a very Happy New Year to all of you.
&gt; 
&gt; I spent the best part of New Year's day trying to install RH4.0 onto a
&gt; 
&gt; demothballed 386. I had problems trying to get Linux to recognise the 
&gt; cdrom at boot time (I tried a few cdrom units, from the latest to 
&gt; the old 2X without success), so I'm left with an NFS install from a 
&gt; working Linux machine.
&gt; I read the NFS howto and did everything (how to set up an NFS  
&gt; server)according to the howto.
&gt; I then booted the boot disk on the 386, chose NFS install, (the
&gt; network 
&gt; card was detected allright), entered the network info until I got to
&gt; the 
&gt; dialogue box which asked for the NFS server name and the directory on 
&gt; which the RH cd was mounted. After entering the required info and 
&gt; pressing enter, I got the following dialogue boxes:
&gt; 
&gt; 				Error
&gt; 	Mount failed : Invalid argument
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 				Error
&gt; 	I could not mount that directory from the server
&gt; 
&gt; and on the blue background, I got the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 	rpc.mount : RPC : Timed out
&gt; 
&gt; The log files in ALT F3 showed the following:
&gt; 
&gt; * mounting ('IP of NFS server':/mnt/cdrom on /tmp/rhimage as type nfs
&gt; * creating directory /tmp rc = -1
&gt; * creating directory /tmp/rhimage rc = -1
&gt; * calling nfsmount ('IP of NFS server':/mnt/cdrom, /tmp/rhimage, 
&gt; &morejunk, &junk, &mount_opt
&gt; *	nfsmount returned non-zero
&gt; *calling mount ('IP of NFS server':.mnt/cdrom, /tmp/rhimage, nfs, 
&gt; -158209791, 0x80840d4)
&gt; 
&gt; And the log in ALT F4 showed:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;4&gt; nfs_read_super : not a socket
&gt; 
&gt; There's no mention of any problems for RH4.0 NFS installs on the
&gt; Redhat 
&gt; website. 
&gt; 
&gt; What am I doing wrong? I'd appreciate any help on this problem
