Hi All,
        I have had some discussions with Najar's regarding menu's etc, we
have a number of options

Buffet
Set Menu 
A La Carte

The set menu we can have a choice of 2 Entree, 3 mains and 2 desserts
I have a few samples, we can mix and choose whatever we like from any of the
menu's to narrow it down to suit. Huge choice!

        The same for a buffet, Anti Pasta or Hors' Dovers for entree with a
choice of approx 12 dishes for mains plus dessert.
Price for these will be around $22 to $28 per person depending on what we
decide on for menu.

        The other option is we can simply order A La Carte which might be
the way to go since it might be difficult to book a firm number of people in
this instance.
        A La Carte might give a greater individual choice in price, those
who don't want to spend a lot can order accordingly.

        If we have 15 people or more we can book their upstairs venue which
is great gives us the chance to turn up have a drink and a chat out on their
balcony then when people have arrived we can go in and sit down, very nice
in this sort of weather.

        The food and service at Najjar's is second to none! we will be
getting first class meals and service at standard restaurant prices.

I was going to email a list of some of the choices but there is so much and
I only have a sample anyway.
We can tailor up any menu we want, the difficulty is choice!
        
        Mat Tippet perhaps you have some suggestions?
Cheers
        Paul
