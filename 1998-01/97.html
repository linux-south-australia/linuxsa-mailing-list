&gt; 	Hmm, a couple of things on this thread, firstly what would
&gt; Netscape's motive be for suddenly making its flagship product freeware?
&gt; Obviously a front on attack against Micro$oft.  However, also obviously,
&gt; a heap of developers cannot work on Netscape for free. So, does this
&gt; mean?  Is Netscape going to give its product to the world in the hope of
&gt; delivering MS a 'bewdy' and quietly die?

Although Netscape have come from nowhere and set records for fastest growth
they are still small fry in the grand scheme of software things.  They
don't have the revenue for hiring lots of developers and 'innovating'
the way Microsoft does with it's products.  When Microsoft talk about
450 man year projects they are probably talking about 600 people coding
away for about 9 months.  Netscape can't do this.

One of the other games in the software market is predicting itself, that
is where the software market is going.  If the market is driving the
market, then it will be to an extent self organising.  

If Netscape have got things right, then they should enjoy similar
direction and improvements that Apache has.  Apache is market driven,
when a technophile sees something that needs doing it gets done.  In a
traditional environement a technophile will have to wait for the Vendor
to fill the perceived gap.

Free software developers won't support the bells and whistles that are
good for marketing but don't give much real return.  They will develop
things that need doing.

Watch out for near global strong encryption (through SSLeay) high speed
Java (through free JVMs and JIT compilers).  There is a lot of 
integration that needs to be done, but it will be great to see the
strengths of the free software movement integrated.  

Finally there might be PGP enabled netscape.  Maybe even a gtk-based
netscape instead of motif.  We might be able to get a lot of the
glut out of Netscape too.

&gt; 	Secondly, the newly semi-GPL'd Netscape is going to be in danger
&gt; of losing direction unless it is coordinated and championed much like
&gt; our beloved Linux.  Is Netscape going to do this, and for how long, no
&gt; income = no workers.

As Steve responded in a previous post, Netscape had dwindled their browser
revenue to less than 18 percent of gross revenue as of last quarter.  
This may not have been their intention (although say say they have 
'successfuly' done this).  It no longer their main source of income.

Possibly also the Netscape base product was not performing very well,
they may have been generating limited revenue from the base product
and more revenue from the 'professional' product.  

I am sure they have not shot themselves in the foot on this one.  I 
think they are taking a risk, but I think they might end up with a 
great product in the end.
