Firstly, a very Happy New Year to all of you.

I spent the best part of New Year's day trying to install RH4.0 onto a 
demothballed 386. I had problems trying to get Linux to recognise the 
cdrom at boot time (I tried a few cdrom units, from the latest to 
the old 2X without success), so I'm left with an NFS install from a 
working Linux machine.
I read the NFS howto and did everything (how to set up an NFS  
server)according to the howto.
I then booted the boot disk on the 386, chose NFS install, (the network 
card was detected allright), entered the network info until I got to the 
dialogue box which asked for the NFS server name and the directory on 
which the RH cd was mounted. After entering the required info and 
pressing enter, I got the following dialogue boxes:

				Error
	Mount failed : Invalid argument

and
				Error
	I could not mount that directory from the server

and on the blue background, I got the following:

	rpc.mount : RPC : Timed out

The log files in ALT F3 showed the following:

* mounting ('IP of NFS server':/mnt/cdrom on /tmp/rhimage as type nfs
* creating directory /tmp rc = -1
* creating directory /tmp/rhimage rc = -1
* calling nfsmount ('IP of NFS server':/mnt/cdrom, /tmp/rhimage, 
&morejunk, &junk, &mount_opt
*	nfsmount returned non-zero
*calling mount ('IP of NFS server':.mnt/cdrom, /tmp/rhimage, nfs, 
-158209791, 0x80840d4)

And the log in ALT F4 showed:

&lt;4&gt; nfs_read_super : not a socket

There's no mention of any problems for RH4.0 NFS installs on the Redhat 
website. 

What am I doing wrong? I'd appreciate any help on this problem
