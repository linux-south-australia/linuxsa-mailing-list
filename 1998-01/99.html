The kernel is 2.0.32

This (Freetel) is the only program I'm having problems with. The win
box can use  POP, SMTP, IRC, ICQ, HTTP, FTP, Ping, NNTP and runs
Internet Phone quite well.

A few searches on Deja-news have only turned up people asking the same
question but without answers. I even wrote to a few of them to ask if
they ever mangaged to get it working but they gave up. I think I'm
going to as well.

&gt; It Would help if you stated which version of kernel you are running as
&gt; there is additional support for UDP Masquerading in the later versions.  I
&gt; have not tried such programs but I have noticed that 2.0.30 has better
&gt; support than the 2.0.27  (RedHat 4.2 V 4.1) and believe that The Kernel
&gt; with RedHat 5 supports it even better.
