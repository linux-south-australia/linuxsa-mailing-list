Dear User Group Leader,

Attached is the list of upcoming USENIX Conferences/Symposia, several of
which are now accepting submissions:

Highly informal yet refereed and of the highest technical quality, USENIX
conferences and workshops offer refereed papers featuring
previously-unpublished technical information, tutorials, and a great
opportunity for the exchange of ideas. Our tutorial program is well known
for delivering top quality intensive instruction in new and essential
technologies--technologies, which are often presented by the people who led
in their development.  USENIX is the Advanced Computing Systems
Association, a nonprofit membership society, now almost 25 years old.

I believe members of your user group will be interested in these events. I
hope you will help us by distributing this announcement to your members by
any appropriate means.

Especially feel free to link the USENIX Association web page
<A HREF="http://www.usenix.org">http://www.usenix.org</A>

Thank you for your help,
Cynthia Deno
