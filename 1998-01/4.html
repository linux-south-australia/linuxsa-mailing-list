&gt; I spent the best part of New Year's day trying to install RH4.0 onto a 
&gt; demothballed 386. I had problems trying to get Linux to recognise the 
&gt; cdrom at boot time (I tried a few cdrom units, from the latest to 
&gt; the old 2X without success), so I'm left with an NFS install from a 
&gt; working Linux machine.
&gt; I read the NFS howto and did everything (how to set up an NFS  
&gt; server)according to the howto.
&gt; I then booted the boot disk on the 386, chose NFS install, (the network 
&gt; card was detected allright), entered the network info until I got to the 
&gt; dialogue box which asked for the NFS server name and the directory on 
&gt; which the RH cd was mounted. After entering the required info and 
&gt; pressing enter, I got the following dialogue boxes:
[snip]
&gt; and on the blue background, I got the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 	rpc.mount : RPC : Timed out

It sounds like your networking is not working (if the networking was
working then I would have thought that you should have at least seen
"Connection refused" or "Permission Denied").

After the networking is configured on the client, are you able to ping
it from the server?

Are there any other machines on the network that you can use to verify
the networking setup of the server?  Are you able to verify that the
hardware of the client is working using some other OS?
