Hi Nick,

you wrote:

&gt; I stuffed up, guys.
&gt; 
[snip]
&gt; 
&gt; Something went wrong... basically could no longer boot into windows, booted
&gt; from floppy, fdisk /mbr'd and sys'd the hard drive, and everything's fine.
&gt; 
&gt; But I want linux back!
&gt; 
&gt; THE QUESTION:
&gt; 
&gt;   How do I install lilo onto my primary hd partition using the CD I installed
&gt;   from?  How do I make it recognise both my partitions?

If you are using Red Hat Linux, pretend you're redoing the
installation (use the boot floppy or boot from the CD or whatever),
but type "rescue" at the very first prompt instead of just pressing
enter.  Follow the bouncing ball and you'll end up with a shell prompt
from where you can repair things.  Run a command like
"mount hda2 /mnt" to mount your Linux root filesystem so you can
browse your disk and fix your lilo config.

If you're not using Red Hat, use whatever boot floppy you have to get
a shell prompt somehow.  Run a command like
"mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt" to mount your Linux root filesystem so
you can browse your disk and fix your lilo config.

Once you have a fixed lilo config (or if the existing one is "good
enough" for the moment), run LILO to put it back in the MBR.  You'll
most likely need to run lilo with the "-r" switch (eg.
"lilo -r /mnt") so that it knows where to find the lilo.conf file etc.

Here's a sample lilo.conf file that can boot Linux from hda2 and DOS
from hda1:

boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/vmlinuz
	label=linux
	root=/dev/hda2
	read-only
other=/dev/hda1
	label=dos
	table=/dev/hda

&gt; I had it going once before, but ... things change.., you know.
&gt; 
&gt; And where can I purchase the RH5.0 package please?

The company I work for (NetCraft Australia) sells the official boxed
set (with the manual, installation support, a couple of bits of
commercial software, and the boot floppies pre-made) for $59.  We can
send it out to you by courier for about $4-5 or you can pick it up
from us (we're just up the road a bit from Flinders Uni).  We also
have the 6-CD PowerTools set for $34.  Our phone number is 8370 3650.

Regards,
