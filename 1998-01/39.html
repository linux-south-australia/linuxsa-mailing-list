&gt;I have been trying to get a network card to work, I have been tring to
get
&gt;it to work through the Plug in Module but nothing happens no amount of
&gt;messing around will get it to work.
&gt;

Type dmesg to get a list of kernel messages.

&gt;I have since found its I/O port and IRQ and have tryed entering these
&gt;details at install and it seems all very happy with that but after
install
&gt;the machine stops during the boot up process from about 5 minutes and
then
&gt;continues.

Sounds like sendmail trying to find out who it is.  If you don't need
sendmail
get rid of it, or make sure sendmail can find out who it is (someone
else might
be able to point you in the right direction - sendmail and I have not
been on
speaking terms for a while :).

&gt;After logging in Xwindows won't start properly, I get the grey
checkered
&gt;screen but it won't go any further.

That is *technically* X-Windows.

There is an errata in the RH upgrade about a .XClients file.  It doesn't
work
after an upgrade.  (Check out <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">http://www.redhat.com</A> for more details)
That got me
when I installed and maintained my user directories.

&gt;
&gt;      I have reinstalled the system and at the prompt "do you want to
&gt;install networking" I have answered no and the system instals and works
OK
&gt;including Xwindows but no network card obviously.

Check out your dns config.  If you have a dns server that is used on
dial up
and you have a network card which installs a default route the DNS
queries
that sendmail sends (which are UDP) disappear into /dev/null.

Hope this helps.

Matt
