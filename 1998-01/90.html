Howdy,

I am trying to apply the 'balsa' 1.5 patches for the above-mentioned
chip, and to be frank (which I am not, I am really Bruce, but i digress)
I am finding it a bit confusing.

So if you are the sort of person who understands this stuff, please some
advice would be welcome.

I have a cyrix PR200MX chip, driving a linux Redhat-based but upgraded
to kernel 2.0.33.

I grabbed the patch files and unpacked them into a directory to have a
look at the contents. There are several bits. There are init scripts to
be run from rc.local. I did this, and dmesg now reports the machine runs
at 119.something bogusmips (previously 149.5) there is also a couple of
kernel patches, the one that i should load according to the docs is
cyrix_patch. That makes sense. But how to apply it? Man patch says stuff
about doing patch &lt;package&gt; and it reading in the package file as a
diffs output file, and changing the target files accordingly, and the
patch file sure looks like diff output. But if I run patch cyrix_patch
as root, nothing happens. I have copied the patch file to /usr/src, and
tried running patch from there, also from other locations, all with no
patch being applied.

I think I am missing something here...

If you have successfully done what i am trying to do, please let me know
what i should be doing so i don't get so many headaches, and I start to
get some sleep soon.

BTW, if any are interested, my upgrade from 486/33 to 6x86 PR200 and
slackware 96 to RH5 went well, except i don't like the sysv init stuff
(yet?). Also some RH5 tools don't work, but i am doing the configuration
long-hand, as I would have under slackware.

Cheers all.

Bruce
