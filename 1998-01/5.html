Hello Don,

&gt; I would like some advice as to which books etc. to look at to :
&gt; a)  Learn programming with C & C++

i learnt C from the original K&R book "C programming language" i think it
was called. I can't remember what edition it was. This is from the horses
mouth (the inventors of C and co-inventors of Research Unix). I lent it to
a friend and he lost it. I think his dog ate it. K&R C (which is the
original C) is a bit different to ANSI C, but there are few differences,
but gnu C will accept either one. 

I learnt C++ from the microsoft V7 C/C++ programming manuals. One thing i
can say about microsoft, is that they wrote these manuals very well. I
found these manuals to be excellent.

&gt; b)  Learn about programming with C & C++ for Linux in particular.

Get the Linux programming guide off sunsite.unc.edu (in
/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/LPG i think?) It will run you through the system
calls.

&gt; The texts would need to include fairly complete references to all functions
&gt; and system calls
&gt;
&gt; for gcc, Linux and X.

I found xman an excellent visual tool for grouping and browsing system
calls and library routines.


See ya
