Hi,

I have been running a Pr200+ for a while now on a QDI SpeedEasy Explora
II motherboard with no problems at all ... well sort of.

I had some signal 11 faults when compiling kernels, but have solved that
problem recently. Here is the story :

My motherboard has a VX PCI chipset, which is rated at a maximum of
66Mhz.

This "66Mhz" is the bus speed, which is used with a multiplier to
provide the core CPU speed.

The PR-200+ supports either a 50Mhz bus speed, multiplied by 3, or a
75Mhz bus speed multiplied by 2, to get the core CPU speed of 150Mhz.

The nice thing about the SpeedEasy motherboard is that it is jumperless
ie, you dial the CPU speed in via the CMOS settings.

I used the Speedeasy system to specify a PR-200+. With exception to
compiling a kernel, my system would work fine.

After doing some investigation into the sig11 problem, I put it down to
a slowish 1Gb SCSI HDD via a ISA SCSI controller, and old IDE ie Mode 2
or less HDDs.

I found that if I specified a PR-166 in the CMOS, the sig11 faults would
disappear.

I stayed with this setting for a while.

Recently, I was investigating a PR-200+ MMX for some friends, and did
some more research into the core / bus speed issue.

Thru some experimentation, I found that the "speedeasy" setting was
running the bus at 75Mhz, with a multiplier of 2 to get the core CPU
speed of 150Mhz.

The CMOS can also emulate jumpers, so I set the bus speed to 50Mhz, with
a multiplier of 3. I fired up linux, an was able to compile a number of
kernels, without sig 11 faults.

Although when I boot my machine the bios message says the CPU is a
PR-166, the bogomips rating (which is  149.91) correspondes to the value
I got when I used the speedeasy Pr-200+ setting.

I tried setting the bus speed to 55Mhz with a mutiplier of 3, running
the CPU at 165Mhz or a 10% increase. This worked for a few hours, but
then I had a few weird lock ups, probably caused by heat problems.

I reverted back to 50Mhz by 3, and have had no problems since.

The moral of the story ?

You usually don't get something for nothing,
There is no such thing as a free lunch,
Don't run things over spec.

HTH,
Mark.
