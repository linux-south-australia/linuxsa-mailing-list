&gt; Hi All,
&gt;         As a newbie to Linux, (if you haven't figured that out from past
&gt; postings) I was wondering does anyone have or know where to get some sort of
&gt; list that notes what files are are used for what services.
&gt; This is one thing I am having trouble with linux being foreign to me, if I
&gt; need to change something where do I look for the files.
&gt;         In time I will learn, it would be nice to drop a cdrom into the OL
&gt; brain and down load the info, be great wouldn't it!

Well surprisingly rpm (or dpkg) or whatever packaging program you use
tell you a lot about what is needed to get a program going.  If you 
use Red Hat you can find out a lot about a program by doing the following.

Say for example you are wondering what sendmail is... 

To find out what package it is from

	&gt; rpm -qf /usr/lib/sendmail
	sendmail-8.8.7-12

To find out what is in the package

	&gt; rpm -ql sendmail
	/etc/aliases
	/etc/aliases.db
	/etc/mail
	/etc/mail/deny
	...

To find out related packages

	&gt; rpm -qa | grep sendmail
	sendmail-doc-8.8.4-3
	sendmail-8.8.7-12
	sendmail-cf-8.8.4-3

Also have a look around /etc.  And don't forget man and man -k.
Do a man man if you don't understand what man -k is.

These are very hands on ways of learning, but it how I learnt most
of what I know.

There are also Linux courses that crop up from time to time on the 
Internet.

Otherwise get a few books, I don't have any so I can't recommend any.
What sort of level do you want to go in at? Dummy level or reference 
level.

Have fun, and hope the group really helps you.

Matt
