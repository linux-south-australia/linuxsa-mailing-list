Guys,
        Thanks for all of the advise, I am getting somewhere with this,
regarding the Laptop install, I am using Coaxial cable, the cabling,
connectors and terminators are OK as it all works fine with windows.
(I did have a problem when I first bought the network cards and cables, one
of the terminators was open cct, that clangs things up beautifully)
I actually have three system on it now one machine my biggest and best has
now been made Windows only but the other one and the laptop are dual boot
Windows/Linux machines. (LAN, Lounge Area Network, literally)
        
        Getting back to the slow boot up I have done the same install on
both of my desktop machines and had exactly the same bootup problems, these
machines have different m'boards, processors, network cards etc therefore my
way of thinking especially after the note from Brandon Johnson, my problem
is configuring the network and DNS properly, this is very understandable
since I know naf all about it.

        Could I impose one some on to give a bit of a "Dummy's Guide" to
setting these up.
I really don't know the basic concept of what the various numbers should be
or why. The note from Don Collins has started to address that one. Thanks
heaps for that piece of gold, I am looking at that now.

Cheers 
        Paul
