I have been trying to get a network card to work, I have been tring to get
it to work through the Plug in Module but nothing happens no amount of
messing around will get it to work.

I have since found its I/O port and IRQ and have tryed entering these
details at install and it seems all very happy with that but after install
the machine stops during the boot up process from about 5 minutes and then
continues.
After logging in Xwindows won't start properly, I get the grey checkered
screen but it won't go any further.

        I have reinstalled the system and at the prompt "do you want to
install networking" I have answered no and the system instals and works OK
including Xwindows but no network card obviously.

        Can anyone offer a sugestion or two

Thanks In Advance
                Paul
