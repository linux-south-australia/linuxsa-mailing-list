I have been trying to install to my laptop for some time now but I have not
been able to get the install of a CDROM over a network because I have not
been able to get the network to work in Linux.
        Upon having a look around the RedHat Web Site I read a little
articule on doing a HDD install.
        I have the front half of the laptop's HDD partioned for dos and a
standard Win95 install, I copied about 220Mb of files from the Linux CDROM
to a directory called RedHat via Win95 Networking and proceeded with a hard
disk install from there.
        

And, well ... blow me down that was rather painless, installed very smoothly
indeed.
        I have a PCMCIA Network card which all seems to have been set up OK
but I still can't get anything to happen with it, I thing it is how I have
configured the protocols for it (or lack of configuration).
        The network card in my desktop has proven to be more difficult I
don't think that the actual card is working at all let alone getting TCP/IP
set up properly.

        How can I test to see if a network card is working or not, what do I
need to do to make sure I have set it up properly in the first instance?
        Is PING the way to test this, when PING comes back with 100% packet
loss and the indicator lights on the network adaptor don't even blink what next?

Thanks in Advance
                Paul
