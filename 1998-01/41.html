Some more info on that failed install,
The CDROM is connected to one of the IDE lines I am not sure which, I know
it is not connected to the Sound card.
        What I mean by bombing out , at the point where 
"In second stage install" comes up, I am trying to remember now, it was like
a normal shutdown proceedure, I remember Something like 
"Kill signals are being sent"
the last message was
"It is now safe to restart your computer"
At which point we could reboot to windows.

        Now that you mention it, it does seem like the CDROM was not
recognised properly, I remember hearing the CDROM drive spin up then the
system shut down.
I will investigate this more when I visit this friend again.

Thanks
        Paul
