Just to add my 2c worth.  K&R did make an ANSI version also, it is used
(now) as the Unix textbook in the Uni. of South Aust. and should be
available through UniBooks etc.

I used Peter Norton's C++ book to learn C++.  It may be what you are
looking for but I would consider it pretty basic.  Good to start with
but I would expect more from a reference.

Hope this helps?

&gt; Hello Don,

&gt; &gt; I would like some advice as to which books etc. to look at to :
&gt; &gt; a)  Learn programming with C & C++
&gt; 
&gt; i learnt C from the original K&R book "C programming language" i think
&gt; it
&gt; was called. I can't remember what edition it was. This is from the
&gt; horses
&gt; mouth (the inventors of C and co-inventors of Research Unix). I lent
&gt; it to
&gt; a friend and he lost it. I think his dog ate it. K&R C (which is the
&gt; original C) is a bit different to ANSI C, but there are few
&gt; differences,
&gt; but gnu C will accept either one. 
&gt; 
&gt; I learnt C++ from the microsoft V7 C/C++ programming manuals. One
&gt; thing i
&gt; can say about microsoft, is that they wrote these manuals very well. I
&gt; found these manuals to be excellent.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; b)  Learn about programming with C & C++ for Linux in particular.
&gt; 
&gt; Get the Linux programming guide off sunsite.unc.edu (in
&gt; /pub/Linux/docs/LDP/LPG i think?) It will run you through the system
&gt; calls.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The texts would need to include fairly complete references to all
&gt; functions
&gt; &gt; and system calls
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; for gcc, Linux and X.
&gt; 
&gt; I found xman an excellent visual tool for grouping and browsing system
&gt; calls and library routines.
&gt;
