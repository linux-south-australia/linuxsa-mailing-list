&gt; 
&gt; Since migrating my mail/news reading to my Linux setup I've noticed that
&gt; my POP mail retrieval is a significantly slower process than it was under
&gt; Win95.
&gt; 
&gt; Tonight I setup an email client on my masqued Winbox and without removing
&gt; mail from the server, polled my ISP for mail. The retrieval of 61 emails
&gt; was very fast (didn't time it).
&gt; 
&gt; I then retrieved the same email (this time removing it from the server) on
&gt; my Linux machine using fetchmail. There was a marked difference in the
&gt; time it took.  I couldn't blame it all on the "remove from server" action
&gt; so I can only assume that some sort of verification is being done by
&gt; fetchmail or sendmail.

I would concur with the comment about time, but I think it has good reason.

I wouldn't say that it was doing verification but just doing a two
stage process for each message.

It must download, and then deliver locally using sendmail (which then
in turn uses another program).  But I think the real bottle neck is
the double handling done to ensure that all retreived mail get's delivered.
I beleive that it downloads 1 message, delivers, and then downloads 1 
message....

If you want to check this have a look at the code.  I am sure you could
put a fork and then an exec sendmail on fetchmail to achieve
high download rates.  (Can't say much about the load of 20-30 sendmails
all running at the same time).

If you want to see POP transfers go fast, try pine or something that only
*downloads* the mail.  

Hope that give some insight, of course I could be wrong, but it makes sense to
me.

Matt
