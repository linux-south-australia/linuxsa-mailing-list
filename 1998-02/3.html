This is a small list i compiled from a big list posted on usenet a few
years ago. I thought i had accidently deleted this list until just then. I
one day hope to acquire them all. People sometimes come on here and ask
for text references, so here are mine (probably a little bit aged?):

             " This book is the "other" book about Unix ... a study in

*********** This book is excellent for learning the history of Unix, and
*********** how all the different unix flavours came about, their differences
*********** and similarities etc.  If you are skint, then i could perhaps
