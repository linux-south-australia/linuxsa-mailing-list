&gt; &gt; I have an account at microtronics.com.au which works fine under win95.
&gt; &gt; Under linux tho' I can connect, but ping to 203.30.55.1 reports 100%
&gt; &gt; packet loss.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Here's *some* info - if you need/want more, e-mail me directly.

&gt; Hi Staf,
&gt; 
&gt; I think your problem is that you are trying to connect to a BSD box.
a-ha! I assume this problem is specific to ppp then.

&gt; 
&gt; This was discussed on the LinuxSA list back in November/December last
&gt; year.  Steven Ellison wrote:

are there archives of this list anywhere?

&gt; Since then has anyone else been successful in solving this problem
&gt; without changing to slip?
&gt; 
&gt; A message I quoted back then from Mark Newton said that the problem
&gt; was with Predictor-1 compression.  Staf, you might like to try using
&gt; the "-pred1comp" option to pppd, which tells it to not accept
&gt; Predictor-1 compression (if you do try this, make sure to let us know
&gt; what happened).

yep, no change after adding it to /etc/ppp.options_out:
(ppp-on = pppd `cat /etc/ppp.options_out` ...)

one point:
When i first got this ISP, ppp worked wonderfully. Some time later they
'upgraded' their server and I haven't been able to connect since.
'upgrading' apparently means 'new ram, faster processor, and pap
authentication', so maybe pap had something to do with it.

Anyway, the point is that the problem appears to be with BSD not linux.
(just wish i could convince the sysadmins at microtronics that!)

Staf
