&gt; To be fair, Linux rather does that, too.  I agree that it's bootstrap
&gt; loader is more sophisticated than DOS's, but that doesn't change the
&gt; underlying assumption that both DOS and Linux (LILO) believe they "own"
&gt; the boot record.
&gt;
&gt; If I'm not mistaken DOS's boot loader assumes that the first block of
&gt; the partition contains the next stage loader; and LILO can be installed
&gt; in the partition, rather in MBR.  So there is an argument that LILO
&gt; should be installed in the partition, not the MBR, in order to fit in
&gt; with the "standard".

Again we agree on some aspects. 

I think that most Linux distributions 'acknowledge' that they do not own
the boot sector and offer you multiple ways of booting.  The kernel itself
doesn't really care how it starts up, just as long as the system can start
loading it.

Windows 95 (and DOS) assume that there is no other operating system and
consequently will just overwrite any boot sector.  I haven't played with
NT enough to make firm assertations on how it operates.

Hence I don't think it is a matter of which OS thinks it 'owns' the 
MBR but more of who will work with what ever is already there. 

I guess that if there was a standard operating system boot procedure (say
a consistent signature in the boot signature) the PC manufacturers could
then present a boot list for the user to select.  That would probably
be the best (and most compatible) way of resolving who owns the 
boot sector.

We can always dream... 

Cheers,

Matt
