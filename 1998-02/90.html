Just a minor thing, and now that I have made a presentation about it I don't
have an excuse to ignore it, in Geoffreys examples, the subnet should be
10.&lt;0.1&gt;.0 not 10.&lt;0.0&gt;.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

Remember that a subnet value of all binary zeros is classed as "this"
subnetwork, not a valid subnet. Remember 2^8 = 256 - 2 = 254, where subnet 0 and
subnet 255 are the invalid subnets (the minus 2 part).

Technically, you are able to use subnet 0, as long as all the routers in
the internetwork understand subnet zero. I like to think of it as a pocket knife
subnet, the one you pull out when you have used up all your other subnets, and
desperately need one more.

The problem is that you have to check that all devices doing any sort of
routing will support subnet zero, which could take some time, particularly if
you have a large number of routers, running different versions of the routing
software.

BTW, the exam will be at the end of the next meeting. Pass mark is 80%, and you
will be expected to be able to subnet on a partial octet boundary. The exam
will last 1 hour.

HTH,
Mark.

&gt;&gt; As I wasn't fortunate enough to be involved with the group when the above
&gt;&gt; topic was covered at a meeting last year, I wonder if anyone could tell me
&gt;&gt; if there are any notes available from it. Notably this entry in the list of
&gt;&gt; past meetings on the LinuxSA web page does not have a link. Alternatively,
&gt;&gt; perhaps someone knows offhand of a suitable other source of information?
&gt;&gt; Preferably concise and straightforward information, that is! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, that would be my fault (no notes).  The basic steps to get IP
&gt; Masquerading running are:
&gt; 
&gt; Build your LAN (loungeroom area network) as described by Mark (web
&gt; notes coming Real Soon Now) and get it working.  For this example,
&gt; I'll use these IP addresses and parameters:
&gt; 
&gt; 10.0.0.1 - IP Masq server with the modem & internet connection
&gt; 10.0.0.2 - client number 1
&gt; 10.0.0.3 - client number 2
&gt; (etc)
&gt; 255.255.255.0 - netmask for your network
&gt; 10.0.0.0 - network address
&gt; 10.0.0.255 - broadcast address
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure you can do things like "telnet 10.0.0.1" from the other
&gt; machines on the network.
&gt; 
&gt; Get PPP dialup working on your IP Masq server.  You should be able to
&gt; do things like "ftp ftp.redhat.com" from this box.
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure IP Masq support is compiled into your server's kernel (if
&gt; you have Red Hat 5.0, skip this step; it's already there).
&gt; 
&gt; Type:
&gt;   ipfwadm -F -p deny
&gt;   ipfwadm -F -a m -S 10.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
&gt; 
&gt; Set the "default gateway" on the clients to 10.0.0.1 (like Mark
&gt; mentioned, the server's default gateway is managed by PPP).
&gt; 
&gt; Don't forget to set the nameserver IP address correctly on all
&gt; machines.
&gt; 
&gt; That should be it.
&gt; 
&gt; The main reference that I know of for IP masquerading is the
&gt; IP-Masquerade mini-HOWTO.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thanks to Mark Smith for his good coverage of networking and TCP/IP at the
&gt;&gt; last meeting. But you forgot to tell us, will it be in the end of term
&gt;&gt; exam? :)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thankyou also to NetCraft Australia for the Red Hat mouse mat. It is being
&gt;&gt; put to good use at my place of employment where it is attracting the
&gt;&gt; attention of all who pass by.
&gt; 
&gt; It's good to hear that it is being used well :).
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; (And, yes, they're too stingy to even provide
&gt;&gt; me with a mouse mat! Last week my mouse's left button stopped working - so
&gt;&gt; they swapped it with the unused (by me) middle mouse button! Still, that's
&gt;&gt; probably the sort of resourcefulness that a die-hard Linux afficionado
&gt;&gt; would appreciate! :) And I deny completely that the failure of the mouse
&gt;&gt; button was in any way directly related to any after-hours Quake playing! By
&gt;&gt; the way, is there a Linux port of Quake yet?
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK, there has been a Linux port of Quake for a while now.  No idea
&gt; where to get it from though, sorry.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Well, time to blow the dust off the old boot disk and let you all get back
&gt;&gt; to some serious Linuxing.
&gt; 
&gt; I will!
