&gt; Hi Don,
&gt; 
&gt; you wrote:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks Geoffrey.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I ended up using the second option with some difficulty.  I had removed
&gt; &gt; sendmail.init because it hangs at invocation.
&gt; &gt; I ended up changing 'daemon sendmail -bd -q1h' in the start section to
&gt; &gt; 'sendmail -bd -5m &'.  It seems to work but I still don't understand
why
&gt; &gt; the other didn't, I need the '&' or it still just sits there doing
whatever
&gt; &gt; forever.  The 'daemon' specification would appear to be unnecesary coz
the
&gt; &gt; '-bd' tells it to run daemonised anyway.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm... that's not really a good idea.  The sendmail init hangs
&gt; because it is trying to lookup your hostname.  What does running
&gt; 'hostname' say?  What is the contents of /etc/hosts?
&gt;
hostname returns 'jetydo', which is the name I've given the machine.

First two lines of  /etc/hosts is as follows:

	127.0.0.1	localhost
	10.0.0.1		jetydo

 /etc/HOSTNAME just contains 'jetydo'

&gt; It's better to fix the problem rather than the symptom (by adding the
&gt; '&' you just are ignoring that it is hanging for a few minutes).  The
&gt; 'daemon' bit is a function defined in /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions that
&gt; first checks to see whether the daemon is already running before
&gt; starting it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Another anomoly is that if mail is to be sent to me on the local
network it
&gt; &gt; also appears to get redirected to my ISP account.
&gt; 
&gt; Is that new since doing the genericstable thing?
Yes.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What does the 'makemap hash /etc/genericstable &lt; /etc/genericstable'
do? 
&gt; 
&gt; It creates the /etc/genericstable.db file which sendmail looks up
&gt; (sendmail doesn't read the /etc/genericstable file).
OK.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It didn't appear to change anything.
&gt; &gt; Also, if I sometimes log in as someone else  eg. root or Dad, would I
&gt; &gt; change the genericstable to have 'don, Dad, root    donco...',
&gt; &gt; or does each account have to be specifically entered?
&gt; 
&gt; You need to do it like this:
&gt; don	doncol@...
&gt; dad	doncol@...
&gt; 
That's what I did for safety sake.


&gt; (you should leave root alone, and unless that was a typo, you
&gt; shouldn't have usernames with uppercase characters in them)
It wasn't a typo..just a preference.  Why not uppercase?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; BTW&gt;  Where did you get your info?
&gt; 
&gt; It's documented in the O'Reilly sendmail book and in
&gt; /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/README.
thanx.  I only knew of docs being in /usr/doc/...

 regards...Don
