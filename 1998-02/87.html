As I wasn't fortunate enough to be involved with the group when the above
topic was covered at a meeting last year, I wonder if anyone could tell me
if there are any notes available from it. Notably this entry in the list of
past meetings on the LinuxSA web page does not have a link. Alternatively,
perhaps someone knows offhand of a suitable other source of information?
Preferably concise and straightforward information, that is! :)

Thanks to Mark Smith for his good coverage of networking and TCP/IP at the
last meeting. But you forgot to tell us, will it be in the end of term
exam? :)

Thankyou also to NetCraft Australia for the Red Hat mouse mat. It is being
put to good use at my place of employment where it is attracting the
attention of all who pass by. (And, yes, they're too stingy to even provide
me with a mouse mat! Last week my mouse's left button stopped working - so
they swapped it with the unused (by me) middle mouse button! Still, that's
probably the sort of resourcefulness that a die-hard Linux afficionado
would appreciate! :) And I deny completely that the failure of the mouse
button was in any way directly related to any after-hours Quake playing! By
the way, is there a Linux port of Quake yet?

Well, time to blow the dust off the old boot disk and let you all get back
to some serious Linuxing.

Regards,

Wayne
