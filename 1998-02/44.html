&gt;Dear Matthew,
&gt;
&gt;The question to the LinuxSA user group was very much along the lines of
&gt;"what are the options to chmod".  It was asked by someone who evidently
&gt;is an experienced Linux user, and who admitted that the question was
&gt;sent for the express purpose of convincing some customer's to buy Linux.
&gt;
&gt;I'm very surprised to see that you support people's use of the Linux
&gt;mailing list as a replacement for the manual.  There is no question that
&gt;this mailing list serves a useful and friendly source of information
&gt;to experienced people and newbies alike, and I by no means attempt to
&gt;discourage people from asking questions, no matter what the level of that
&gt;question, so long as the question was not asked in a spirit of laziness.
&gt;However to demonstrate to a potential customer that they do not need to
&gt;buy books, nor do they need to use the man command; to demonstrate that
&gt;the Linux mailing list will cheerfully email back an extract of the manual
&gt;page (you can even ask for the specific page you are interested in);
&gt;I'm afraid that I just cannot countenance this.  It's wrong.  It's lazy.
&gt;It's selfish.  Had the question been asked by a complete novice, and had
&gt;it been something like, "how do I stop someone from reading my file," this
&gt;would have been different.  But it was not.  It was asked by an expert,
&gt;and it was, "what are the options to chmod", and it was asked in order to
&gt;encourage someone to buy Linux, and with the tacit implication that they,
&gt;too, could--and should--ask similar questions under similar circumstances.
&gt;
&gt;I have seen very little of this sort of unreasonable question on this
&gt;list, which is a marked contrast to other lists.  I would hate to see
&gt;people use this list in place of manuals and books.  I very much believe
&gt;that the more we encourage new users to misuse the list so, the more
&gt;they will do so.
&gt;
&gt;I realise that I am alone in my concern, there certainly have been
&gt;enough opinions expressed suggesting that the question was perfectly
&gt;reasonable in all respects.  Naturally I must now consider my position
&gt;as a subscriber to this list.  I don't want to suggest that anyone would
&gt;notice or care about my absence here, and in fact I don't want to stop
&gt;subscribing for exactly the reason that this list has shown itself to
&gt;be friendly, helpful and sensibly used.  However when one is part of
&gt;a community--which is what the subscribers of this list do form--one
&gt;must accept that one is judged by the mores of that society.  I do not
&gt;wish to be part of a society that routinely asks for manual pages to be
&gt;emailed to them.
&gt;
&gt;I think would be a pity if I unsubscribed because, putting aside any
&gt;sense of false modesty, I am extremely knowledgeable about Unix, and I
&gt;do like to help, and in fact have quietly helped many people before and
&gt;will continue to do so.  It would be a sad loss to this list to lose
&gt;people like me.
&gt;
&gt;Actually I am truly disappointed to see that everybody else disagrees
&gt;with me.
&gt;
&gt;I think this should be my last public word on the matter.
&gt;
&gt;David
