As one of the people who responded to the question with an answer I feel
that I should contribute my reasons for posting a comprehensive answer.

To the question "What are the options to chmod" I would have answered 
"man chmod".
As this is covered by the man pages, info pages, and every introductory
piece of documentation I've seen.

However the question asked was,
"I understand the symbolic options to chmod, but what do the numerical
options mean?"

This question is understandably more complex, and one that I have fielded
from some experienced users on occasion (as they had only ever used
symbolic options).

However I cannot condone flaming a newbie for being lazy.  At least not
until it has been explained to them, politely, that they are expected to
try and find the answer themselves first.  I found the language in the
replay that went to the list to be offensive, and rude.  It is not the
sort of image that I want to be associated with as a part of the linux
community.

If people are using the list before they try the man pages, tell them the
man page they should be looking at.  Maybe even suggest that they should
try documentation before resorting to mailing lists.  However please be
civil, and lets err on the side of tolerance.
