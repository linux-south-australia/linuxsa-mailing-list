Dear Matthew,

The question to the LinuxSA user group was very much along the lines of
"what are the options to chmod".  It was asked by someone who evidently
is an experienced Linux user, and who admitted that the question was
sent for the express purpose of convincing some customer's to buy Linux.

I'm very surprised to see that you support people's use of the Linux
mailing list as a replacement for the manual.  There is no question that
this mailing list serves a useful and friendly source of information
to experienced people and newbies alike, and I by no means attempt to
discourage people from asking questions, no matter what the level of that
question, so long as the question was not asked in a spirit of laziness.
However to demonstrate to a potential customer that they do not need to
buy books, nor do they need to use the man command; to demonstrate that
the Linux mailing list will cheerfully email back an extract of the manual
page (you can even ask for the specific page you are interested in);
I'm afraid that I just cannot countenance this.  It's wrong.  It's lazy.
It's selfish.  Had the question been asked by a complete novice, and had
it been something like, "how do I stop someone from reading my file," this
would have been different.  But it was not.  It was asked by an expert,
and it was, "what are the options to chmod", and it was asked in order to
encourage someone to buy Linux, and with the tacit implication that they,
too, could--and should--ask similar questions under similar circumstances.

I have seen very little of this sort of unreasonable question on this
list, which is a marked contrast to other lists.  I would hate to see
people use this list in place of manuals and books.  I very much believe
that the more we encourage new users to misuse the list so, the more
they will do so.

I realise that I am alone in my concern, there certainly have been
enough opinions expressed suggesting that the question was perfectly
reasonable in all respects.  Naturally I must now consider my position
as a subscriber to this list.  I don't want to suggest that anyone would
notice or care about my absence here, and in fact I don't want to stop
subscribing for exactly the reason that this list has shown itself to
be friendly, helpful and sensibly used.  However when one is part of
a community--which is what the subscribers of this list do form--one
must accept that one is judged by the mores of that society.  I do not
wish to be part of a society that routinely asks for manual pages to be
emailed to them.

I think would be a pity if I unsubscribed because, putting aside any
sense of false modesty, I am extremely knowledgeable about Unix, and I
do like to help, and in fact have quietly helped many people before and
will continue to do so.  It would be a sad loss to this list to lose
people like me.

Actually I am truly disappointed to see that everybody else disagrees
with me.

I think this should be my last public word on the matter.

David
