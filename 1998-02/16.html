&gt; &gt; Tell me, everyone... are the various "runlevels" in linux simply designed
&gt; &gt; for convenience, or are they specifically set up for definite purposes?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; ie can you set up the system so that runlevel, say, 3, runs certain
&gt; &gt; drivers for max compatibility, and runlevel, say... 4, that runs only a
&gt; &gt; bare minimum of drivers?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is that what they're for?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is this a question I should already know the answer to and I shouldn't go
&gt; &gt; _near_ a linux box ever again?

Ok these are good questions.

The problem seems to be an mis-understanding about linux and devices in
general.  The simple answers:

Are runlevels set up for definate purposes?  Some yes, some no.

Can you set up runlevels to load specific drivers?  Yes.

Is that what they're for? No.

Should I already know all the answers?  Of course!  Didn't you solve the
					middle-east crisis before breakfast!?

What is a runlevel?  Well I've already answered this question on this list, 
	so I'll just point you to it.

Now to deal with devices:

Under DOS device drivers are kept in a link-list style structure that is 
assembled as each driver is loaded.  As a result attempting to unload a 
device driver under DOS normally corrupts the chain, and crashes the system.  
Not surprisingly this product of brain-dead design isn't used in linux.  
Under linux devices are either compiled into the kernel, or loaded dynamically 
as modules.  These modules can be loaeded and unloaded at will (although there 
are some dependencies between them, ie. vfat requires fat to be loaded first).  
In fact if you use kerneld you can have the modules automatically loaded when 
needed, and unloaded again when they aren't being used.  So you don't even 
have to change runlevel to load anew set of drivers.

I suggest you read the man pages for
	modprobe, insmod, rmmod, lsmod, depmod.
I also suggest you read the Modules HOWTO.
