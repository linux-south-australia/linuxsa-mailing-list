People, as the person who started LinuxSA and being one of the main organisers I feel
that I should make a few comments.

After being away from mail for the last couple of days and downloading a couple of
hundred messages earlier today I saw a mini-flamewar about questions on various parts
of Linux.

Take this as the founder's strategic vision of sorts.

When I started LinuxSA I had a couple of goals in mind.

	o LinuxSA was intended to be a Linux support group.  In no way did
		I want LinuxSA to deteriorate into a group of people who
		play around and hack at the kernel.  In a lot of ways I feel
		that LinuxSA has acheived that.

		Although I have may have delusions of granduer (sp?) I feel that
		LinuxSA is one of the few LUG mailing lists that has a relatively
		small amount of either waffle or off-topic talk.  Most of the 
		questions that people ask are either responded to promptly or
		people will direct the asker to appropriate references.

		The fact that Trevor was using LinuxSA as an indication about the
		level of support that Linux *really* has is testament to this.

	o LinuxSA was intended to be for all people at all experience levels.

		Depending on one's age I am sure most people remember making
		some pretty stupid assumptions as they started playing with
		computers.  I would be ashamed to say some of the things I
		struggled with when I was first starting out.

		Linux/Unix has a very steep learning curve, but I am sure
		most people who use Linux would agree that it is well worth it.
		
		As a side effect of this there are people who are at the bottom
		of the incline and some who are in the middle and some who are
		almost to the top.  It is just par for the course.

		Some people are eager to get things going straight away (a la
		QuickStart people) I am one of them.  But I also remember the
		difficulty that I had coming to grips with some of the more
		esoteric aspects of Unix.  I am by no means a guru, or even an
		expert, and I too occasionally ask questions.

		Probably the most difficult part of Unix is understanding where
		the resources and references are.  Most Unix references are just
		that, references.  They are intended to be used to confirm/deny
		in most cases what a user has assumed.  I feel that it is more
		important to help people where possible, and point them in the
		right direction for not only the answer, but also where to learn 
		more.

		Sometimes experience clouds what is sometime less than obvious.
		Leave your field of experience and you would be suprised how
		difficult it is to get just a base level of knowledge.

		I hope that LinuxSA will allow anyone, of any level to 
		be able to find answers in an appropriate fashion.  If some
		people find that they get frustrated by 'newbies' asking
		questions which appear to be blatantly obvious then I personally
		ask them to let those who don't get frustrated answer those 
		questions.  It could be worse, having flamewars and off topic 
		chit-chat on a regular basis.

	o LinuxSA was intended to be maintain a high level of professionalism.

		LinuxSA has been operating for about 24 months now (actually I
		held the first meeting probably 30 months ago but I don't think
		that 4 people count as a meeting :).  In that time I can't
		think of any *real* flamewars or even many occasions of off-topic
		threads.  To that regard I think LinuxSA has remained focused
		and has a very high usefulness.

		I am subscribed to most other Australian LUG's mailing lists, 
		and have seen major flamewars and just general chit-chat in
		very high levels elsewhere.  I am sure that some other members
		would probably agree, (I know who you are).  

		I feel that LinuxSA has alienated very few people and hopefully
		has helped more than enough people to make up for the 
		possible millions of packets that it has sent over the Internet.

		I applaud and sincerely thank every person on this mailing list
		for making LinuxSA what it is.  The fact that Trevor used the
		mailing list to convince a company to set up three Linux sites
		due to the real support that Linux has in Adelaide stands as
		testimony to this.  To even drive the point home Trever did
		not even have to send a 'on your best behaviour' email to
		effectively 'Package' LinuxSA, we did it on ourselves.

This has got a bit long so I will cut it short here, but LinuxSA is headed 
in the direction that I had intended, and it has taken every member to get
us where we are.  

I could go on more, but enough bandwidth wasted, ask me next Tuesday if
you want me to go on, but be prepared to listen :)

Thank you all for getting LinuxSA to where it is.  I feel it is a useful
entity in the Linux Community in South Australia, and I hope we can all 
get LinuxSA even further.

Have a good weekend, and see some of you next Tuesday (the 17th of Feb).
