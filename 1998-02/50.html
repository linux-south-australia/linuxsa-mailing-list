&gt; Hello
&gt; Installed Redhat 5.0 Saturday. I can't seem to compile my C programs. They
&gt; used to end up as a.out which I would rename, but now they don't. Any
&gt; ideas?

Can you supply by what you mean the C programs won't compile?

Is it they won't compile with error, or just won't even start?

&gt; Also, how do I setup my modem for e-mail? All the info I have only rambles
&gt; on about network cards.

Check out the following man pages, 

	pppd, netcfg, fetchmail, sendmail, procmail.

There are a few HOWTOs covering mail.  Checkout the 

	PPP-HOWTO (in /usr/doc/HOWTO, read with zless)
	Mail-Queue mini howto (in /usr/doc/HOWTO/mini/)

The way I have it set up is,

	Incoming mail is downloaded using fetchmail and sorted via
	procmail.  I download my mail after I use ppp to connect through
	the RH utility 'netcfg'.

	Outgoing mail can be written any time and queued locally
	through sendmail (I use elm for writing mail).  When I connect
	the mail will eventually be uploaded to my mail relay 
	or can be expedited by issuing a '/usr/lib/sendmail -q'.

	I have set up sendmail to have a smart host (using DS) and
	masquerade as my ISP's domain (using DM).  Both these entries
	can be found in /etc/sendmail.cf.

You can also use a complete package such as Netscape Communicator
to send and receive mail (a 10 MB footprint for a mail agent is too 
much for me :).

Cheers,

Matt
