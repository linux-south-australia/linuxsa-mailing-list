  DN&gt; To help you with any next question, the way to find the command
  DN&gt; relevant to some topic is to use the "-k" option to man.  For
  DN&gt; example, to find the command relevant to mounting a disk you
  DN&gt; could say, "man -k mount".

IMHO, if you're really a unix rookie, then I think "man -k" leaves a
lot to be desired.  However there are two tools that give much better
results when searching for unix help; TkMan and Glimpse.

Glimpse is a fast search tool.  One runs glimpseindex on some
directories (in this case your "man" directories), and it prepares
some database files at the top of each "man" tree.  These database
files are then used for subsequent searches.  Glimpse supports regular
expression searches and near-matches, etc, and is faster than your
garden variety "grep".

TkMan is a Tk-based man-reader; much better than xman or any other
variants that I've come across.  (From memory, I think TkMan won some
"Tcl" awards for being a good piece of work).  TkMan interfaces to
"man -k" or "glimpse", so where you're searching for some help, it can
search all man files for a word, phase or regex.  Man pages in TkMan
contain "hypertext" links to quickly go to the next cross reference,
and many other features that I don't have time to mention.

The biggest strength of TkMan is its ability to find some information
when you're not sure which man page it is in.  It's usefulness tapers
off for unix "pro"s.

Tk, Tcl, TkMan, and Glimpse packages are readily available through
your normal Debian, RedHat or other channels.

Of course, these are just my opinions, for what they're worth...
