&gt; Isn't there the runlevel editor under X which basically changed
&gt; /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/ to do this stuff?
&gt; Just fire it up, select what you want to run in that runlevel and let it
&gt; go?

My opinion of the /etc/rc.d/rc5.d directory is to start and stop services.
Services are autonomous processes which provide some sort of functionality,
the provision of X is more of a continual login process and hence is similar
to the provision of virtual consoles.  

Services are started and then stick around in the background.  login processes
should allow you to log in, when the process dies it should restart again.  
Similar to how login works from a getty.

Hence likewise the proper place IMHO is in the /etc/inittab file, in my case
replacing the /usr/X11/bin/xdm (under RH5) with /usr/X11R6/bin/X -indirect ...

This does work, and when you exit the login it respawns the X server, presenting
the CDE login screen from a Solaris box.  As an added bonus we can connect
to the local machine by hitting &lt;ALT-F[123456]&gt;.

Anyone else care to suggest other ways.  

All though I did not mean to dampen the rc5.d point, I have definite reasons
(albiet stubborness and sticking to the spirit reasons) for not wanting to do
it that way.  Another way that I tried was putting it at the end of the
rc.local file.  As a consequence the system never finished parsing the 
/etc/rc.d files, started X, and would only complete when X finished for the
first time.

Cheers.
