I thought I would endorse Matthew's statements by contributing this - 

When ever you are dealing with a newbie, be sympathetic. There was a day when
you didn't know to press the &lt;Enter&gt; key at the end of a command, and somebody
probably helped you out. Now you can repay the debt.

&gt; People, as the person who started LinuxSA and being one of the main
&gt; organisers I feel
&gt; that I should make a few comments.
&gt; 
&gt; After being away from mail for the last couple of days and downloading a
&gt; couple of
&gt; hundred messages earlier today I saw a mini-flamewar about questions on
&gt; various parts
&gt; of Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Take this as the founder's strategic vision of sorts.
&gt; 
&gt; When I started LinuxSA I had a couple of goals in mind.
&gt; 
&gt;       o LinuxSA was intended to be a Linux support group.  In no way did
&gt;               I want LinuxSA to deteriorate into a group of people who
&gt;               play around and hack at the kernel.  In a lot of ways I feel
&gt;               that LinuxSA has acheived that.
&gt; 
&gt;               Although I have may have delusions of granduer (sp?) I feel that
&gt;               LinuxSA is one of the few LUG mailing lists that has a
relatively
&gt;               small amount of either waffle or off-topic talk.  Most of the 
&gt;               questions that people ask are either responded to promptly or
&gt;               people will direct the asker to appropriate references.
&gt; 
&gt;               The fact that Trevor was using LinuxSA as an indication about
the
&gt;               level of support that Linux *really* has is testament to this.
&gt; 
&gt;       o LinuxSA was intended to be for all people at all experience levels.
&gt; 
&gt;               Depending on one's age I am sure most people remember making
&gt;               some pretty stupid assumptions as they started playing with
&gt;               computers.  I would be ashamed to say some of the things I
&gt;               struggled with when I was first starting out.
&gt; 
&gt;               Linux/Unix has a very steep learning curve, but I am sure
&gt;               most people who use Linux would agree that it is well worth it.
&gt;               
&gt;               As a side effect of this there are people who are at the bottom
&gt;               of the incline and some who are in the middle and some who are
&gt;               almost to the top.  It is just par for the course.
&gt; 
&gt;               Some people are eager to get things going straight away (a la
&gt;               QuickStart people) I am one of them.  But I also remember the
&gt;               difficulty that I had coming to grips with some of the more
&gt;               esoteric aspects of Unix.  I am by no means a guru, or even an
&gt;               expert, and I too occasionally ask questions.
&gt; 
&gt;               Probably the most difficult part of Unix is understanding where
&gt;               the resources and references are.  Most Unix references are just
&gt;               that, references.  They are intended to be used to confirm/deny
&gt;               in most cases what a user has assumed.  I feel that it is more
&gt;               important to help people where possible, and point them in the
&gt;               right direction for not only the answer, but also where to
learn 
&gt;               more.
&gt; 
&gt;               Sometimes experience clouds what is sometime less than obvious.
&gt;               Leave your field of experience and you would be suprised how
&gt;               difficult it is to get just a base level of knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt;               I hope that LinuxSA will allow anyone, of any level to 
&gt;               be able to find answers in an appropriate fashion.  If some
&gt;               people find that they get frustrated by 'newbies' asking
&gt;               questions which appear to be blatantly obvious then I personally
&gt;               ask them to let those who don't get frustrated answer those 
&gt;               questions.  It could be worse, having flamewars and off topic 
&gt;               chit-chat on a regular basis.
&gt; 
&gt;       o LinuxSA was intended to be maintain a high level of professionalism.
&gt; 
&gt;               LinuxSA has been operating for about 24 months now (actually I
&gt;               held the first meeting probably 30 months ago but I don't think
&gt;               that 4 people count as a meeting :).  In that time I can't
&gt;               think of any *real* flamewars or even many occasions of
off-topic
&gt;               threads.  To that regard I think LinuxSA has remained focused
&gt;               and has a very high usefulness.
&gt; 
&gt;               I am subscribed to most other Australian LUG's mailing lists, 
&gt;               and have seen major flamewars and just general chit-chat in
&gt;               very high levels elsewhere.  I am sure that some other members
&gt;               would probably agree, (I know who you are).  
&gt; 
&gt;               I feel that LinuxSA has alienated very few people and hopefully
&gt;               has helped more than enough people to make up for the 
&gt;               possible millions of packets that it has sent over the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;               I applaud and sincerely thank every person on this mailing list
&gt;               for making LinuxSA what it is.  The fact that Trevor used the
&gt;               mailing list to convince a company to set up three Linux sites
&gt;               due to the real support that Linux has in Adelaide stands as
&gt;               testimony to this.  To even drive the point home Trever did
&gt;               not even have to send a 'on your best behaviour' email to
&gt;               effectively 'Package' LinuxSA, we did it on ourselves.
&gt; 
&gt; This has got a bit long so I will cut it short here, but LinuxSA is headed 
&gt; in the direction that I had intended, and it has taken every member to get
&gt; us where we are.  
&gt; 
&gt; I could go on more, but enough bandwidth wasted, ask me next Tuesday if
&gt; you want me to go on, but be prepared to listen :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you all for getting LinuxSA to where it is.  I feel it is a useful
&gt; entity in the Linux Community in South Australia, and I hope we can all 
&gt; get LinuxSA even further.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a good weekend, and see some of you next Tuesday (the 17th of Feb).
