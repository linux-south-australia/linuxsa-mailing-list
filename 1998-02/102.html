&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone seems to be on the ball here, so here's a hard one:
&gt; 
&gt; I have an account at microtronics.com.au which works fine under win95.
&gt; Under linux tho' I can connect, but ping to 203.30.55.1 reports 100%
&gt; packet loss.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's *some* info - if you need/want more, e-mail me directly.

Hi Staf,

I think your problem is that you are trying to connect to a BSD box.

This was discussed on the LinuxSA list back in November/December last
year.  Steven Ellison wrote:

&gt; I find this difficult to believe as both systems have been around for a
&gt; long time!  I know that APANA in South Australia are using FreeBSD as a
&gt; terminal server for several people using Linux as well as a lot of other
&gt; OS's.

And Tony Galliford replied:

&gt; Well, having had exactly the same problem myself (linux box into
&gt; pasa.apana.org.au), I find it quite easy to believe.  It might work
&gt; with some particular configurations or config file tweaking or
&gt; something, but I ended up solving the PPP problem by changing to
&gt; SLIP.

Since then has anyone else been successful in solving this problem
without changing to slip?

A message I quoted back then from Mark Newton said that the problem
was with Predictor-1 compression.  Staf, you might like to try using
the "-pred1comp" option to pppd, which tells it to not accept
Predictor-1 compression (if you do try this, make sure to let us know
what happened).

Regards,
