Someone said... "what sort of questions are appropriate, and what sort are 
simply rude"

I've had at least 8 years dealing with "newbies" in an another area (not 
Linux related), and whilst I have sometimes (often?) thought that some 
questions directed to me could have been solved by a bit of effort on their 
part; one basic principle I have always tried to apply is that the only 
"stupid" question is the unasked one.

Sure it takes a bit of time to answer these questions, but by helping them 
directly _and_ showing them how to find it in the future is far better than 
talking about "lazy", "rude" etc.

Remember, we aren't all born with 100% knowledge about a subject, we learn 
by the generosity of others (when we ask the "lazy", "rude" etc questions).

Obtw, I noticed that more people helped than carped - perhaps that is a 
object lesson in itself :-)
