Trevor Van Der Linden &lt;<A HREF="mailto:trevor@bold.net.au">trevor@bold.net.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt; I am the one who asked the question in the first place.  A newbie, not 
&gt; exactly. I was, at the time demonstrating the usefulness of the mailing 
&gt; list with Linux to one of Adelaide's Corporate clients

I already said that it was a mistake that my message to Trevor was also
sent to the list.  I normally am very careful about that and I certainly
didn't mean to publicly accuse anyone of being a newbie.

However I must express my fear; that my interpretation of what was said
(above) is, "Look at the mailing list, you can use it instead of reading
a manual."  Yes there are a lot of people here who are more than happy
to answer questions like, "what are the arguments to chmod?"  However
answering such a question is misguided at best because there is no
excuse for its being asked in the first place.  Giving an answer only
encourages more question like that.  Is there anyone here who honestly
thinks that question was reasonable?

Please don't misunderstand me, I'm not flaming anyone, nor am I having
a dig at Trevor.  It's a failing of large mailing lists: that people
start to use them instead of using books and online manuals.  Without
intending that it should be such, I think we are now having a discussion
concerning what sort of questions are appropriate, and what sort are
simply rude.
