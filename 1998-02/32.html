<p align="center"><strong>TIME SOFT FILES ALLEGATION SUIT AGAINST WORLDS LARGEST SOFTWARE
MANUFACTURER</strong></p>

<p>February 11 - 1998</p>

<p>TimeSoft corporation opened a bitter blood battle dispute with Microsoft Legal execs
Monday morning, citing that Microsoft Corporation (<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A>)
was guilty of holding a direct monopoly on desktop time-keeping software by including the
windows system clock in the taskbar tray of the Windows 95* and Windows NT* operating
systems. TimeSoft Corporation CEO Gyle Keddes had this to say: &quot;This directly affects
the sales of our flagship product 'TimeSoft - Clock' it is a very valuable piece of
software, aimed at providing all windows users with the ability to see what time it is.
When Microsoft monopolized the market for time-keeping software, they directly slashed our
sales with an inferior product -this is why we are filing against them today&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Keddes also noted that his legal action will also be aimed at Microsoft soon to be
released Windows 98* and Windows NT* 5 operating systems. Mr. Keddes also mentioned that
his corporate R&amp;D department are analyzing the Microsoft programming code for it's
popular operating systems, as a test to see if Microsoft in fact is not only monopolizing
the industry with it's system clock, but also utilizing TimeSoft code in it's application.
When asked about this, Mr. Keddes replied: &quot;From our preliminary research, we think
that is a good bet that there system clock application is also just a remake of our clock
application, it appears similar in all respects and operates almost exactly the same,
keeping time on a 60 second per minute, 60 minute per hour basis.&quot;</p>

<p>Microsoft legal professionals claimed that the system clock is an integral part of it's
Windows* operating system, and it cannot be removed. Microsoft stated that end users not
wishing to use it's version of time keeping software, may purchase a crippled version of
the Microsoft Windows* 3.1 operating system, with the control panel 'date and time' icon
disabled.</p>
