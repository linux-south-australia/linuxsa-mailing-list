&gt; The first and most painful problem is that Windows 95 (or any DOS based
&gt; operating system for that matter) can only boot off the first partition on
&gt; the first hard-drive.  I couldn't find any way around this, and don't
&gt; believe there is any way.  So you'll have to move your Linux disk to another
&gt; position, put the new Windows disk in as the primary, and install LILO on
&gt; the MBR of the first hard drive.

I think you will find that it is the 'ACTIVE' partition that is where
the DOS must be resident.  Your basic MBR code just looks in the partition
for the active one, and loads the boot sector from that partition and
then boots the code.

It is a pity though that most DOSes think they own the disk and write
their own boot record, typically obliterating lilo.  Another option
to the rescue floppy solution is a kernel on a disk, I think 'make zdisk'
gives you it.  That way the system will boot from the floppy and 
automatically mount your root partition from the hard drive.  It makes
life a lot easier than having to play with rescue disks that are more
intended for easing to life a corrupted system.

Cheers,

Matt
