Hi Wayne,

you wrote:

&gt; As I wasn't fortunate enough to be involved with the group when the above
&gt; topic was covered at a meeting last year, I wonder if anyone could tell me
&gt; if there are any notes available from it. Notably this entry in the list of
&gt; past meetings on the LinuxSA web page does not have a link. Alternatively,
&gt; perhaps someone knows offhand of a suitable other source of information?
&gt; Preferably concise and straightforward information, that is! :)

Hmmm, that would be my fault (no notes).  The basic steps to get IP
Masquerading running are:

Build your LAN (loungeroom area network) as described by Mark (web
notes coming Real Soon Now) and get it working.  For this example,
I'll use these IP addresses and parameters:

10.0.0.1 - IP Masq server with the modem & internet connection
10.0.0.2 - client number 1
10.0.0.3 - client number 2
(etc)
255.255.255.0 - netmask for your network
10.0.0.0 - network address
10.0.0.255 - broadcast address

Make sure you can do things like "telnet 10.0.0.1" from the other
machines on the network.

Get PPP dialup working on your IP Masq server.  You should be able to
do things like "ftp ftp.redhat.com" from this box.

Make sure IP Masq support is compiled into your server's kernel (if
you have Red Hat 5.0, skip this step; it's already there).

Type:
  ipfwadm -F -p deny
  ipfwadm -F -a m -S 10.0.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0

Set the "default gateway" on the clients to 10.0.0.1 (like Mark
mentioned, the server's default gateway is managed by PPP).

Don't forget to set the nameserver IP address correctly on all
machines.

That should be it.

The main reference that I know of for IP masquerading is the
IP-Masquerade mini-HOWTO.

&gt; Thanks to Mark Smith for his good coverage of networking and TCP/IP at the
&gt; last meeting. But you forgot to tell us, will it be in the end of term
&gt; exam? :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou also to NetCraft Australia for the Red Hat mouse mat. It is being
&gt; put to good use at my place of employment where it is attracting the
&gt; attention of all who pass by.

It's good to hear that it is being used well :).

&gt; (And, yes, they're too stingy to even provide
&gt; me with a mouse mat! Last week my mouse's left button stopped working - so
&gt; they swapped it with the unused (by me) middle mouse button! Still, that's
&gt; probably the sort of resourcefulness that a die-hard Linux afficionado
&gt; would appreciate! :) And I deny completely that the failure of the mouse
&gt; button was in any way directly related to any after-hours Quake playing! By
&gt; the way, is there a Linux port of Quake yet?

AFAIK, there has been a Linux port of Quake for a while now.  No idea
where to get it from though, sorry.

&gt; Well, time to blow the dust off the old boot disk and let you all get back
&gt; to some serious Linuxing.

I will!

Regards,
