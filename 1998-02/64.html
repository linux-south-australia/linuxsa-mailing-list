Hi.

&gt;However I cannot condone flaming a newbie for being lazy.  At least not
&gt;until it has been explained to them, politely, that they are expected to
&gt;try and find the answer themselves first.  I found the language in the
&gt;replay that went to the list to be offensive, and rude.  It is not the
&gt;sort of image that I want to be associated with as a part of the linux
&gt;community.

Sounds like the Linux spirit of community I've experienced and 
appreciate. The system was created by co-operation, we get the results of 
that co-operation virtually free. I'm no expert, but I help others where 
I can, and enjoy similar exchanges from others more experienced than I. 
Some of those man pages are pretty obtuse to a newbie, by the way, and 
sending them there isn't always the best solution. chmod numerical 
options is a good example where the man page is not brilliant:

&gt;A  numeric  mode  is  from one to four octal digits (0-7),
&gt;derived by adding up the bits with values  4,  2,  and  1.
&gt;Any  omitted  digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The
&gt;first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set  group  ID
&gt;(2)  and save text image (1) attributes.  The second digit
&gt;selects permissions for the user who owns the  <A HREF="file:">file:</A>  read
&gt;(4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permis-
&gt;sions for other users in the file's group, with  the  same
&gt;values;  and  the fourth for other users not in the file's
&gt;group, with the same values.

All of which may be true, but this is no user-friendly text! I've never 
found a clear description of these modes that I can follow and use to 
construct a particular chmod numerical mode command, and so don't use the 
numerical options very much, and don't really understand the mechanics of 
the makeup of the number when I do. Now if someone pointed me to a text 
that enabled me to understand, there would be one more Linux user able to 
help those who don't understand in the future, and probably a few lurkers 
who won't have to ask the question.

My 2 cents,

Michael
