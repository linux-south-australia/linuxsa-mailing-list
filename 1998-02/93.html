Although I am still getting a handle on the differences between the various
versions of libc etc. I'll have a go at solving your problem.

You have looked in all the right places to determine that whether the shared
library exists - you are well on the way.

I think your problem is that you are using libc v4 (which contains all the basic
C library functions (such as printf etc). I think that libX11.so.6 is expecting
at least libc v5 (I am running libc v5.4.38 - althought there is a slightly
newer version out). Another problem may be that I think libc v4 was an "a.out"
format library, rather than an "elf" format library. This could also be causing
your problem.

You can use the "file" command to determine whether your file is an elf or an
aout. eg. "file libc.so.4.7.2" gives

 libc.so.4.7.2: Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (QMAGIC), stripped

on my box, indicating an "aout" whereas "file libc.so.5.4.38" gives

libc.so.5.4.38: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 386, version 1, not stripped

indicating an elf format library.

BTW : Don't think about running "strip" against libc, I have done this in
search of disk space, and have then had to spend the next hour re-installing
libc on a non-bootable Linux system (via rescue floppies).

if you are running a complete "aout" system (try something like "file
/bin/cp"), it is best to move to an elf system, as this is the preferred format
for Linux executables, and the newer versions of the kernel are only designed
to compile as an elf. See the ELF-HOWTO for instructions. An easier method of
upgrading (if ELF-HOWTO seems to hard) is to completely upgrade your box via a
new distributions eg. Red Hat 5.

Alternatively, you may just need to install Libc 5. It is best to also install
all the new version of the linker, GCC etc. See the GCC subdirectory under
/pub/Linux at sunsite for all the new versions of these things. Make sure that
you read and follow the release notes exactly, particularly the order in which
to upgrade these components. If you are too casual about this upgrade, you may
end up with a dead linux box, as Libc is used by all (I'm pretty sure, I
haven't checked all 4000 binaries on my system :-) programs using shared
libraries.

BTW, it is possible to have both libc v4 and libc v5 existing on the same box,
and is necessary if you still want to run old "aout" binaries.

BTW2, there is a new libc comming, v6, which is currently "sort of" in beta
test, ie. it is not quite a production level version, but is being used in
distributions like Red Hat 5.

HTH,
Mark.
