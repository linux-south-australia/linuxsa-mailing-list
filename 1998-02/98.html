&gt; Just a minor thing, and now that I have made a presentation about it I don't
&gt; have an excuse to ignore it, in Geoffreys examples, the subnet should be
&gt; 10.&lt;0.1&gt;.0 not 10.&lt;0.0&gt;.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

I'm glad you brought this up :).

&gt; Remember that a subnet value of all binary zeros is classed as "this"
&gt; subnetwork, not a valid subnet. Remember 2^8 = 256 - 2 = 254, where subnet 0 and
&gt; subnet 255 are the invalid subnets (the minus 2 part).

This has not been true since CIDR (Classless Inter Domain Routing)
came in and the traditional uses of classes (ie. Class A, Class B,
Class C) went out.

&gt; Technically, you are able to use subnet 0, as long as all the routers in
&gt; the internetwork understand subnet zero. I like to think of it as a pocket knife
&gt; subnet, the one you pull out when you have used up all your other subnets, and
&gt; desperately need one more.

Using all definable subnets (that is, using subnet 0 and subnet -1)
has been the current standards-based practice for almost three years
now.

RFC 1878 (December 1995) says "Many vendors only support subnetting
based upon this [excluding all-zeros and all-ones subnets] premise.
This practice is obsolete!  Modern software will be able to utilize
all definable networks."  Note that "modern" in 1995 is old now :).

Also, RFC 1812 (June 1995) says "Previous versions of this document
also noted that subnet numbers must be neither 0 nor -1, and must be
at least two bits in length.  In a CIDR world, the subnet number is
clearly an extension of the network prefix and cannot be interpreted
without the remainder of the prefix.  This restriction of subnet
numbers is therefore meaningless in view of CIDR and may be safely
ignored."

&gt; The problem is that you have to check that all devices doing any sort of
&gt; routing will support subnet zero, which could take some time, particularly if
&gt; you have a large number of routers, running different versions of the routing
&gt; software.

Hmmm, I say that if you have routers that do not comply with the
Internet Standards from mid-1995 then the routers probably have other
problems besides not being able to use subnet 0 & -1, and they should
be upgraded anyway.

&gt; BTW, the exam will be at the end of the next meeting. Pass mark is 80%, and you
&gt; will be expected to be able to subnet on a partial octet boundary. The exam
&gt; will last 1 hour.

Sounds like fun :).

(psst, if you need help subnetting on partial octet boundaries and
want a cheat sheet then see RFC 1878: "Variable Length Subnet Table
For IPv4")
