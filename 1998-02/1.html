Hi Don,

you wrote:

&gt; Thanks Geoffrey.
&gt; 
&gt; I ended up using the second option with some difficulty.  I had removed
&gt; sendmail.init because it hangs at invocation.
&gt; I ended up changing 'daemon sendmail -bd -q1h' in the start section to
&gt; 'sendmail -bd -5m &'.  It seems to work but I still don't understand why
&gt; the other didn't, I need the '&' or it still just sits there doing whatever
&gt; forever.  The 'daemon' specification would appear to be unnecesary coz the
&gt; '-bd' tells it to run daemonised anyway.

Hmmm... that's not really a good idea.  The sendmail init hangs
because it is trying to lookup your hostname.  What does running
'hostname' say?  What is the contents of /etc/hosts?

It's better to fix the problem rather than the symptom (by adding the
'&' you just are ignoring that it is hanging for a few minutes).  The
'daemon' bit is a function defined in /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions that
first checks to see whether the daemon is already running before
starting it.

&gt; Another anomoly is that if mail is to be sent to me on the local network it
&gt; also appears to get redirected to my ISP account.

Is that new since doing the genericstable thing?

&gt; What does the 'makemap hash /etc/genericstable &lt; /etc/genericstable' do? 

It creates the /etc/genericstable.db file which sendmail looks up
(sendmail doesn't read the /etc/genericstable file).

&gt; It didn't appear to change anything.
&gt; Also, if I sometimes log in as someone else  eg. root or Dad, would I
&gt; change the genericstable to have 'don, Dad, root    donco...',
&gt; or does each account have to be specifically entered?

You need to do it like this:
don	doncol@...
dad	doncol@...

(you should leave root alone, and unless that was a typo, you
shouldn't have usernames with uppercase characters in them)

&gt; BTW&gt;  Where did you get your info?

It's documented in the O'Reilly sendmail book and in
/usr/lib/sendmail-cf/README.
