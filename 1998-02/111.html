&gt; &gt; Hi Staf,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think your problem is that you are trying to connect to a BSD box.
&gt; a-ha! I assume this problem is specific to ppp then.

Yes.  From what I'm told, SLIP works fine.

&gt; &gt; This was discussed on the LinuxSA list back in November/December last
&gt; &gt; year.  Steven Ellison wrote:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; are there archives of this list anywhere?

Yes, on my harddisk :).  One day they'll appear on the website; in the
meantime I won't get annoyed with anyone who repeats questions that
they should have checked for first in the archives :).

&gt; &gt; A message I quoted back then from Mark Newton said that the problem
&gt; &gt; was with Predictor-1 compression.  Staf, you might like to try using
&gt; &gt; the "-pred1comp" option to pppd, which tells it to not accept
&gt; &gt; Predictor-1 compression (if you do try this, make sure to let us know
&gt; &gt; what happened).
&gt; 
&gt; yep, no change after adding it to /etc/ppp.options_out:
&gt; (ppp-on = pppd `cat /etc/ppp.options_out` ...)

Do you have debugging turned on?  Does it show the compression being
rejected?

&gt; one point:
&gt; When i first got this ISP, ppp worked wonderfully. Some time later they
&gt; 'upgraded' their server and I haven't been able to connect since.
&gt; 'upgrading' apparently means 'new ram, faster processor, and pap
&gt; authentication', so maybe pap had something to do with it.

I don't think it has anything to do with PAP, but I could be wrong.

&gt; Anyway, the point is that the problem appears to be with BSD not linux.
&gt; (just wish i could convince the sysadmins at microtronics that!)

Well, you could go to a Linux-friendly ISP (I seem to remember SE Net
and Lynx Internet Connections were recently mentioned on this list as
good ones) and tell Microtronics why you're leaving.

Regards,
