Hi all,

HELP  :-{
Does anyone out there have or know of a sensible solution for
measuring the bandwidth used by dialin PPP clients.

I have searched the earth for a copy of "nacctd", which
is supposed to be one of the original b/w daemons. No success there.

I have checked out the IPacct 0.7b release, BUT
(aside from my paranoia towards patching kernels instead of compiling)
by it's own admission, it is not capable of accurately measuring
PPP users because it uses UID perms instead of IP addrs to
decify WHO requests the packet. (ie: pppd is sometimes run by root)

I thought I had found the holy grail when I came accross
"Clobberd-3.2", spent all day installing it, only to
go to the author's home page (in search of the FAQ or something)
and find out that he is scapping that release due to
its inpractical implementation.
(It uses pseudo-shells in place of "bash" or "ppp", which can
make for some interesting re-writes to your /etc/passwd design)

I have de-evolved back to Clobberd-2.8 and although the
implementation is a little simpler (but just as arkward),
this release DOESN'T measure bandwidth.

So I'm searching again, now.

Has anyone else had to go through this recently?

Thanks,
-Daniel
