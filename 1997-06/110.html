Dear colleagues,

I must say that I really enjoyed the meeting last night.
( So much to learn.. )

I always have a few "computerish" projects on the go at any one time.
( My main interest in LINUX, up until now.. , has been as a 
  programming environment. )

One of the other projects that I have on the go is to develop a point 
of sale type system for a small shop. You know.. one machine in the 
shop with a bar-code reader and a cash drawer. This will communicate 
via a small network with a server in the back room which holds all 
the data &c.. for a relational database ( RDBMS.. ).. Reports are run 
at regular intervals to keep track of the inventory and the accounts.

I had previously thought that I would be forced to go down a
Windows/DOS development path because of the difficulty of obtaining
suitable database products, equivalent to  Microsoft's Access or
Borland's Paradox. I am informed that there *are* good databases
available for LINUX.

Under LINUX .. I would imagine that the systems would combine the 
following elements :

Operating System : LINUX  ( what else... )

Networking : Ethernet & TCP/IP, & PPP for remote access??

GUI : X Windows & MOTIF

Database : Empress?? or Ingres??.. ( Has anyone heard of "Solid"?)


Do any of the subscribers to LINUX-SA have experience in this area. 
Could they tell me what products they used.. and how well they 
worked?


Yours sincerely

Andrew Allison
