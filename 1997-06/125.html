the advice is that it is a good idea.  there was no mention of any legal
mess arising out of this.  incorporating makes for a single legal entity,
the unincorporated alternative is to do everything in the name of the
members.  all of them !!  imagine bank accounts etc. crazy, although there
is a way of doing it unincorporated, using trusts and things, but why
bother.  incorporate was the word.  i guess you understand the idea of
"seperate legal entity"  that "linuxSA inc" can own things itself, and
these things are bought/sold as per the vote of the members - at the agm
the members elect their representatives in these areas.

we need a constitution, that members are agreeing to upon joining.  it
should outline office bearers duties, to which they are also bound.  i was
told where to get a sample from.  i'm also having the forms sent to me,
should be here monday.

i am happy to be treasurer, if you want, i am *not* a good acocuntant, and
i'm sure there would be someone with some accounting experiance, in the
group.  perhaps we could offer them free membership, as there is a small
amount of tax stuff etc.to do, similar to running a business, although of
course there is much less of a volume of transactions to keep track of.
