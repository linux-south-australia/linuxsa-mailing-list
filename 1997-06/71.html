| It seems that most of the group are Red Hat gurus,
 | maybe for good reason. Are there any like me who
| are running a Slackware install?

i was running slackware, but in the interests of expediancy installed red
hat the last meeting.  i beleive the two distributions use different file
systems - in unix there are two ways of organising files, and these two
packages are an example of each of them :)

of course one of the 'gurus' will post the facts, but this is the general
idea.

i find all the /etc/bin /usr/blah all rather baffling at the moment,
although it is becoming clearer, i did not want to have it explained it to
me at meetings, and then have to go home and work out the 'other' way it's
done, for myself ! :)  now i know someone is going to reply and tell me
it's easy to rearrange them, but you know how it is when you're learning.

the five or six cd set of red hat + powertools is available from g.bennett
for less than thirty dollars (plus my cut for the plug, heheh).  when i
consider that membership to the adelaide pc ug cost me $30 and all i got
was a couple of floppies with pkzip on them (sheesh:), it was not a
painful
expense!~:)

just my thoughts on the it.  one other thing, red hat looks stacks better
than slackware did anyway :)  this could be because it's a newer version
though!
