&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've got a linux pc that is functioning as a gateway to the
&gt; internet.
&gt; Several other pcs are connected to the gateway by ethernet. Some of
&gt; those
&gt; pcs run windows and for them I have tcp/ip for windows.
&gt; However, I want to connect to the ethernet network through dos, in
&gt; which
&gt; case I won't need a hard drive. In other words I'll be able to boot
&gt; from a
&gt; floppy, then connect to the network.
&gt; I've searched the net for tcp/ip for dos, but haven't found anything
&gt;
&gt; suitable.
&gt; Has anyone had similar intentions and be willing to enlighten/share
&gt; ?

Unfortunately  AFAIK  MS has no TCP kernel for DOS.  There are other
DOS based TCP kernels/libraries (Sunsoft PC-NFS, WU-TCP, PCFTP, etc)
which you can use.  You might, however have a problem with finding one
that
sits happily on one disk.

Another option might be to boot machines with DOS and a TCP kernel from
the network (ie with BootPROMs).  But that is a new thread altogether.
