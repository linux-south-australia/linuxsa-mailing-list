&gt; well, it's a great offer.  perhaps this is the time to grap $x from
&gt; everyone and dish out membership cards to borrow shared magazines, books
&gt; and software?
&gt; if we all pitched (say) thirty in now, we could order some of that great
&gt; software and books as well?  not to mention those free cd offers
&gt; available.

yep - agreed - maybe offer a discount to people if they can help by
providing some magazines/books/etc :)

&gt; (i thought i'd rather put in more now for a few things to have the chance
&gt; to borrow, rather than putting in two bucks, so we can have a magazine a
&gt; month between the fourty of us! heheh)
&gt; 
&gt; i'd suggest this needs two people to volunteer as treasurer and
librarian,

I'll do the latter of the 2 :)

&gt; and that we make it a yearly membership fee and that all financial
members
&gt; have the change to borrow anything bought from common funds, for a month
&gt; between meetings, on a fifo basis (librarian might keep a list of "who's
&gt; next" on popular items).  membership cards will be the library cards, and
&gt; should be shown before borrowing.  no contribute, no borrow.

totally agreed - also I think the librarian should be responsible for
keeping a list of all books/mags/etc and if they are popular the next date
they are available for loan.

&gt; i don't put myself up for either of these positions - i'll design the
&gt; cards:), and i don't care either way.  well, what do y'all think about
&gt; those ideas then?  matt, geoffrey, other interested, active members? :)
&gt; 
&gt; all those in favour say 'aye' all those against 'nay' 

or should that be "eye" and "nose" heheheh

sorry - very sad joke that

seeya
