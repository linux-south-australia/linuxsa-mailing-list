&gt; Does anyone care to make any recommendations about the 
&gt; 
&gt; StarOffice 3.1   or the Apllixware pacakges (I think its called
&gt; Applixware) ?

Okay, I'll bite :).

Here's a quote from someone about Applixware:

Subject: You Guys Are AWESOME!

I have wanted to write this note for some time. Today was the day of my
emancipation from Windows. I no longer need to ask to use one of my
colleagues computers at work if I need to write a letter or use a
spread sheet. 

I received my copy of Applixware in the mail today!!! Now my LINUX system
is complete. My system is the envy of the office. I have a machine that
doesn't crash that can do anything. I can use a commercial quality word
processor, and spread sheet, I serve web pages, I run our departmental
database..... I have finally been liberated from the clutches of the that
other companies products!!!

My heart felt thanks to all who have worked on Linux and have given me
back my computer. And a special thanks to the Red Hat developers for
making it all more accessable. In short you guys are awesome!

Many, many thanks,

Mark Menard

The above was written when Applixware 4.2 was the current version;
4.3 is even better :).

Personally, I think Applixware is great.  I'm not a heavy user of
office-type software, but it works well for when I need it.  The
spreadsheet is pretty good too.  What else is there to say?  It works
fine, and it runs under Linux!

Just recently, I had to print out ~200 reports.  Before printing, I
needed to add an identifier to the title, based on the filename.  To
complicate things, the files used the IBM-PC graphics character set.
Perl + Applixware made it _really_ easy to get all this done (much
MUCH easier than doing it under DOS/Windows).

The Perl script went through each of the files and added the header,
as well as making sure that none of the reports were missing or
misnamed.

I then installed the "MS Linedraw" truetype font into Applixware, and
recorded a macro to put a document into the MS Linedraw font and print
it.  A short shell script to combine a bundle of reports into one text
file later, and the printer was hard at work.

My example doesn't really say much about Applixware's power, but its
support for truetype fonts meant that I could do all the work I needed
to using only Linux.

&gt; StarOffice is available for ftp but its a big beastie.

I hear that it's slow too.  There is a StarOffice mini-HOWTO at
<A HREF="http://www.jnpcs.com/mkb/linux/StarOffice.txt">http://www.jnpcs.com/mkb/linux/StarOffice.txt</A> -- the author writes
that the dynamically linked version of StarOffice takes about a minute
to load on his Pentium 100 with 48MB RAM.  My Pentium 66 with 40MB RAM
loads Applixware in &lt;20 seconds.

&gt; John - [ who is wondering why he decides now is the time to blow the
&gt; dust of his linux CD and install it again when he has two exams next
&gt; week.]

Hehe, I've done things like that :).
