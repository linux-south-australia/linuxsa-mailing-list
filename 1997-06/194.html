&gt; As an aside to this, it is sometimes necessary to recompile a kernel
&gt; to give particular functionality to Linux.

True, but since Red Hat 4.0, recompiling the kernel is something that
most people don't need to do, since nearly all of the drivers are
there as pre-compiled modules.

&gt; I, and I'm sure many
&gt; others, have never compiled a kernel due to the worry of trashing
&gt; the system.  Charles' experience showed this as he now has a kernel
&gt; that has problems.

He has?

&gt; The general information available is a little
&gt; too presumptive about the users ability, and I would like to see a
&gt; LSADP ;-) on changing and recompiling a kernel under RH4.x that
&gt; starts from scratch.   How about it?  Is anyone else like me, or am
&gt; I the black sheep of this list?

Have you read the section "Building a Custom Kernel" in the Red Hat
User's Guide, and the Kernel-HOWTO?  If these two documents don't
explain everything that you need, I can show you how to build a
kernel, then you can tell me what wasn't explained in those documents.
I'd be happy to write an LSADP HOWTO but the documentation to do it is
already there, and I don't know what is missing from it.

Who would like a Linux-Kernel-Recompiling talk at the next LinuxSA
meeting?
