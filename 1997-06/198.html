&gt; &gt; You are expected to send me comments on whether it helps/doesn't help
&gt; &gt; you! :)
&gt; Yes this was very concise. I got my cd to function with the addition 
&gt; of this line in /etc/fstab
&gt; /dev/scd0  /mnt/cdrom  iso9660  default ro 0 2
&gt; this worked well until my first attempt at recompiling my kernal to 
&gt; support sound. Now the cd won't open and is continually busy. Any 
&gt; attempt to mount it is rejected with 
&gt; umount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb, or too 
&gt; many file systems

Ummm... a few things don't quite add up here:
- You have /dev/scd0 (the first SCSI CDROM drive) in your /etc/fstab,
  but the above message refers to /dev/hdb (an IDE disk or CDROM).
- The error message allegedly comes from umount, which is the
  unmounting utility, not the mounting utility.
- "default" is not a valid option in /etc/fstab.  "defaults" is, but I
  recommend in the removeable-media tip to use "noauto,user,exec".

&gt; whoops
&gt; The upside of this though is that recompiling had seemed such a 
&gt; daunting experience that I put it off for as long as possible. Now I 
&gt; see the ease of it I feel much more confident moving around in there.
&gt; Any ideas as to how to stop the ever spinning cd.

Does any of the above help?

&gt; Redhat 4.1
&gt; kernal v2.0.27
&gt; in the sound section I have Sound blaster support and 
&gt; /dev/dsp and /dev/audio support checked.
&gt; In the Floppy, IDE, and other block devices section I have 
&gt; Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tapesupport
&gt; Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support
&gt; checked.

That sounds right.  Does the kernel detect the drive when booting?
