Hi there Linux people..

A group of Linux users here in Sydney have banded together and provide
support for the Sydney office of Community Aid Abroad
(<A HREF="http://www.caa.org.au">http://www.caa.org.au</A>). A linux machine runs a variety of services for a
bunch for PCs running Windoze for Workgroups that staff and volunteers use
for their daily tasks. 

I provide most day to day support by email, remote access and occasional
visits, and every now and then we volunteers get together for a Yum Cha
followed by install fest - upgrade OS, tweak Web server, set up new
service etc, and the boring stuff as well, try to keep the Windoze
machines working.

For many years now CAA has had its data processing unit in Adelaide, but
they are moving to Melbourne leaving a smaller regional office without any
IT resources. A proposal has been raised to leave behind a Windoze NT
server to provide the file/print sharing and email services that the IT
people with the Suns have provided until now.

I'd like to know whether there are volunteers down there who'd like to
band together to provide the sort of support team for Linux that we have
up here. Some experienced people who can be on call for emergencies - on a
paid basis if need be - would be useful as well.

Regards
