Michael had a good idea (TM) and wrote:
&gt; well, it's a great offer.  perhaps this is the time to grap $x from
&gt; everyone and dish out membership cards to borrow shared magazines, books
&gt; and software?
&gt; if we all pitched (say) thirty in now, we could order some of that great
&gt; software and books as well?  not to mention those free cd offers
&gt; available.

&gt; (i thought i'd rather put in more now for a few things to have the chance
&gt; to borrow, rather than putting in two bucks, so we can have a magazine a
&gt; month between the fourty of us! heheh)

personally I was thinking more along the lines of the 2 bux each model...


&gt; i'd suggest this needs two people to volunteer as treasurer and librarian,
&gt; and that we make it a yearly membership fee and that all financial members
&gt; have the change to borrow anything bought from common funds, for a month
&gt; between meetings, on a fifo basis (librarian might keep a list of "who's
&gt; next" on popular items).  membership cards will be the library cards, and
&gt; should be shown before borrowing.  no contribute, no borrow.

&gt; i don't put myself up for either of these positions - i'll design the
&gt; cards:), and i don't care either way.  well, what do y'all think about
&gt; those ideas then?  matt, geoffrey, other interested, active members? :)

&gt; all those in favour say 'aye' all those against 'nay' 

does a whoa count as a nay? if you arent volunteering to organise things,
lets first get someone (sucker) to say they will do that before we go off
on membership card/group library/$30 fee tangents. Having been roped
into doing this sort of thing before, I can state categorically that hell
will freeze over before I do it again!!!

&gt; Michael Lindner

FWIW I nominate Michael Linder as inaugural Secretary/Treasurer/Librarian
to set this body up. Me, I'll be the one who helps with the artwork for
the cards/stationery/etc and generally has a good time being creative.
