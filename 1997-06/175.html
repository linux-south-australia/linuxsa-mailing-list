&gt; I really would like to get some information on this.  Does anyone know
&gt; anylaywer type people I could have a chat to?
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing that I want to maintain is the free aspect of LinuxSA, no
&gt; yearly
&gt; membership fees, no entry costs, ....   When incorporated it is very
&gt; easy to
&gt; make excuses for tax... (ahem....  ooops!!!) user charges to increase.


basically i see it as possible to have a free group... but as with
linux... if you pay you get extra bits and pieces... eg ability to borrow
books for nothing... and a news letter..... etc etc... unlike other groups
we shouldn't charge a door fee or put a limit on the number of meetings u
can attend before having to pay.......

i feel this would be fair and would be similar to the way linux works....
