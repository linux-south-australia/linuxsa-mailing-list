&gt; &gt; If someone has Slackware could they print out the permissions
&gt; &gt; of /usr/sbin/pppd (or wherever it is).  I have a gut feeling that
&gt; &gt; it is setuid root.  This should allow users to run it, BUT it does
&gt; &gt; bring another setuid program into existance :).
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; -rws--x--x   1 root     bin         70060 Aug 18  1996
&gt; /usr/sbin/pppd-2.2
&gt;
Just as I thought.  If you leave pppd as setuid root (does every one
knowwhat setuid root means?  I can explain).  Then a normal user can
start
pppd up, and pppd will become root when it needs to create the ppp0
interface.  If you look at the Red Hat installation I'd bet even money
that
it is not setuid root.

&gt; One way to do this would be to root configure diald for demmand
&gt; dialling
&gt; regardless of the user.

Not always what you want.  Sometimes I want to run netscape locally,
withouthaving access to the net.  Of course netscape goes and queries
the nameserver
if I make a mistake, which means that a packet is itching to go out.
Although I
could leave the modem turned off, it could get expensive if I forget.

What's that noise.... D'OH (proper spelling :) I left the modem on....
Or even worse
if someone has an internal modem, you can't turn it off..  *CHINK* there
goes
another 25 cents :(

&gt; &gt; It makes sense not allowing users to add a network interface
&gt; &gt; though doesn't it, or is it just that I am paraniod :).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; BTW has anyone read the documentation with pppd?  I might
&gt;
&gt; What is the latest version of pppd ?
&gt; Has 2.3 been released yet ? I heard of some minor test releases but
&gt; this
&gt; was some time ago.
&gt;
I have no idea.
