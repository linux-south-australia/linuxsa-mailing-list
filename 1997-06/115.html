             GLUE---Groups of Linux Users Everywhere

Linux Journal, a publication of SSC, has a special offer for Linux User 
Groups. By purchasing a special GLUE User Group Membership groups receive 
a one year subscription to the magazine, but also get a bonus--tools to help 
form, maintain, and grow their own User Group, and an annual User Group 
discount on certain publications. 

Your group can purchase an annual GLUE membership---a Linux User Group 
subscription for the cost of a Linux Journal subscription + $10 USD. 

Your User group will get:

* One subscription to Linux Journal sent to the recipient designated by
  the User Group.

* A 10% discount on publications published by SSC (including additional
  Linux Journal subscriptions) for all user group members.

* A 10% discount on Linux distributions that SSC resells through our catalog. 
  (Not including non-distribution products such as Office Suites).

* Other vendors may also extend a discount or offer specials to GLUE members.
  Currently Enhanced Software offers new GLUE groups a free single user not-
  for-resale sample of BRU 2000, and a 10% discount on purchases, and Caldera
  offers a OpenLinux-lite CD-ROM to newly registered groups. The BRU 2000 and
  COL-lite are shipped from SSC with the rest of your GLUE member materials.

* A Linux User Group List web pointer to your URL with information about your 
  Linux User Group, and contact information. 

* A startup web page you can use or point to. Sample web pages include 
  "What is Linux?", "Where to Meet", "Establishing a Linux User Group" 
  and more.- See <A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/glue/.">http://www.ssc.com/glue/.</A>

* A service on the GLUE web site for finding other Linux enthusiasts in 
  your area.

* 20 free Linux bumper stickers.

* Sample Linux Journal magazines (20) for your next User Group meeting.

* Your group can buy LUG/nut CD's. LUG/nuts are CD's only available
  to Linux User Groups and include a distribution of Linux, for $6.00 USD 
  per package, (5 package minimum per order). The Debian distribution will 
  be featured on the upcoming LUG/nut CD. 

* We are willing to run a list server for your group if you don't have one.
