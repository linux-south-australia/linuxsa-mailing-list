Dear colleagues,

I admit that I do occasionally play games... but my main interest in 
LINUX is as a programming environment..

I use awk or gawk to perform my pre-processing of data. ( I am 
advised that perl is better.. )

I write programs in ANSI C using the GNU-EMACS editor.

I compile them using gcc.

I am currently investigating some of the other programming tools such 
as :  lint, rcs, make, debug and profile.. There are quite a lot of 
programming tools available in UNIX....

My specific area of interest is scientific computation. 

I am currently teasing away at a little bit of work by Mandelbrot,
on random variables with Levy stable distributions.. I analyse some
data from the "real world" and spend some of my time trying to
simulate the results.. using artificially generated pseudo random
numbers.. I spend the rest of my time thinking about the results and
getting rather confused..

I am also interested in anything to do with Electrical and Electronic 
Engineering... like SPICE .. since that is my livelihood. ( I am 
informed that Octave is good... )

Of course, for my own work, I only need a *little* bit of help from 
others... like how do I install make &c.. but I am curious to know 
whether any of the other people in linuxsa are interested in 
programming.

What languages do they write in?
What tools do they use?
What do their programs do?
( when they work.. that is... )
What *works* for them?     :-)
What does *not* ?      :-(

I realise that programming languages and editors are ultimately a 
matter of religion and that I am possibly stirring up some "holy 
wars" here..  but I *AM* curious to know what people get up to in the 
privacy of their own computers.

Regards

A^2
