&gt; I am wholeheartedly in favor of some more formal structure. Linuxsa
&gt; exists
&gt; due to the motivation and enthusiasm of Matthew and Geoffrey; should
&gt; they
&gt; find other things they would rather do the user's group would
&gt; disintegrate. A committee of some sort would tend to spread the load
&gt; and
&gt; make it less a case of us watching them and more a communal effort.

People can help now.  Although there is no *formal* structure there is a
structurenonetheless.   If people want to do a talk then they can, (they
are encouraged to :).

If someone sees something that might be useful on the web page, send a
copy to
the organisers mail address.  There are lots of ways to help, you just
need to look
and put your hand up.  (Stepping forward is also useful, means things
get done :).

I have spoken to Geoffrey and we are both of the opininion that for the
moment
the organisational load is fine for us.  One person no, two yes.  One
problem
incorporation creates is a lot of extra baggage, secretary, minutes,
elections, formal
account keeping, consitution, etc.......

&gt; Further, if the group is going to trade, incorporation would seem to
&gt; be
&gt; a necessary protection in the event of some unforseen problem.

I really would like to get some information on this.  Does anyone know
anylaywer type people I could have a chat to?

Another thing that I want to maintain is the free aspect of LinuxSA, no
yearly
membership fees, no entry costs, ....   When incorporated it is very
easy to
make excuses for tax... (ahem....  ooops!!!) user charges to increase.

For now, geoffrey and I feel that a slower approach to incorporation is
probably best.

Cheers.

Matt
