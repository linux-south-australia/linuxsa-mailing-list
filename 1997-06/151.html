maybe we could (as a group) create a list of hardware that is GOOD on Linux
Systems.......  this list could be given to all members and faxed to
hardware dealers.  Perhaps if we create some "LinuxSA Approved" stickers to
go on any machines meeting these requirements.  Also - if we are going to
make the group a free standing money taking group why not some of the
people who have a bit of spare time why don't we create a "Linux Box" sales
department :)  I will be happy to do "Linux Box" sales through the front of
shop and will negotiate this with the people we will have selling computers
there..... I could foresee most sales being done over the internet etc
etc... if people are interested maybe we could create some working groups
next meeting....these would be appropriate working groups (I think n e way)

1.	get the group incorporated or whatever is needed
2.	library working group - setting it up - and running it
3.	sales area - to help fund the club.

I would be happy to volunteer for the 2nd and 3rd group.....

in relation to sales and stuff I would think maybe we could get some of the
things through the retailers in the group and split the profits a bit.

well thats my thorts 

till I next feel like ranting and raving have fun and don't die wondering.

if you want to ignore this go for it... it's just late nite thorts :)
