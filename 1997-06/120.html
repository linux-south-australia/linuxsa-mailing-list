well, it's a great offer.  perhaps this is the time to grap $x from
everyone and dish out membership cards to borrow shared magazines, books
and software?
if we all pitched (say) thirty in now, we could order some of that great
software and books as well?  not to mention those free cd offers
available.

(i thought i'd rather put in more now for a few things to have the chance
to borrow, rather than putting in two bucks, so we can have a magazine a
month between the fourty of us! heheh)

i'd suggest this needs two people to volunteer as treasurer and librarian,
and that we make it a yearly membership fee and that all financial members
have the change to borrow anything bought from common funds, for a month
between meetings, on a fifo basis (librarian might keep a list of "who's
next" on popular items).  membership cards will be the library cards, and
should be shown before borrowing.  no contribute, no borrow.

i don't put myself up for either of these positions - i'll design the
cards:), and i don't care either way.  well, what do y'all think about
those ideas then?  matt, geoffrey, other interested, active members? :)

all those in favour say 'aye' all those against 'nay'
