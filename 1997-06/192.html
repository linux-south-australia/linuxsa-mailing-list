&gt; You are expected to send me comments on whether it helps/doesn't help
&gt; you! :)
Yes this was very concise. I got my cd to function with the addition 
of this line in /etc/fstab
/dev/scd0  /mnt/cdrom  iso9660  default ro 0 2
this worked well until my first attempt at recompiling my kernal to 
support sound. Now the cd won't open and is continually busy. Any 
attempt to mount it is rejected with 
umount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdb, or too 
many file systems
whoops
The upside of this though is that recompiling had seemed such a 
daunting experience that I put it off for as long as possible. Now I 
see the ease of it I feel much more confident moving around in there.
Any ideas as to how to stop the ever spinning cd.
Redhat 4.1
kernal v2.0.27
in the sound section I have Sound blaster support and 
/dev/dsp and /dev/audio support checked.
In the Floppy, IDE, and other block devices section I have 
Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tapesupport
Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support
checked.

Kind regards
Kevin
