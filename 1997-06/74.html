System Failure led Big Pond to dry up

David Crowe

A technical failure at Telstra's Big Pond Internet operation has left
up to 90,000 subscribers without some [sic] electronic mail services,
in the largest Internet breakdown of its type in Australia.

Telstra yesterday said its mail server failed last weekend and was
being replaced as Big Pond struggled to cope with a doubling of
subscriber numbers in the past seven months.

Telstra staff yesterday laid the blame for the fault on Microsoft's
Windows NT operating system, the foundation of the e-mail servers that
support the network.

"The number of users has nothing to do with it -- it's an inherent
problem in the operating system," a Telstra employee said.

Telstra yesterday confirmed that some messages that were lost on the
weekend may not be recovered.

...

The manager of Telstra's Internet services, Mr John Rolland, said
yesterday that the system was probably operating properly at the
moment, although he could not guarantee that messages would reach
their destinations.

...

"The problem is actually located in the operating system," [Ms Myrna
Van Pelt, Manager of Public Relations at Telstra Multimedia] said.
