&gt; I've got a linux pc that is functioning as a gateway to the internet.
&gt; Several other pcs are connected to the gateway by ethernet. Some of those
&gt; pcs run windows and for them I have tcp/ip for windows. 
&gt; However, I want to connect to the ethernet network through dos, in which
&gt; case I won't need a hard drive. In other words I'll be able to boot from a
&gt; floppy, then connect to the network.
&gt; I've searched the net for tcp/ip for dos, but haven't found anything
&gt; suitable. 

Depending on what you want to do with the dos computer the crywr (sp?)
packet drivers and ncsa telnet may fit your needs. You can probably find
them both in a SimTel archive.
The ncsa package contains a few clients (ftp,telnet,ping,nslookup). If you
copy the relevent packet driver to a boot disk along with a trimmed down
version of ncsa it should all fit.

Have a read of ncsa* under /usr/src/linux/Documentation. You may need to
hunt down a specific version of ncsa so it works well with Linux.

Regards,
Mark
