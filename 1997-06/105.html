Hi all.

I recently had to reinstall XFree86 (version 3.3), but when I
rebooted, X11 didn't fire up.  /var/adm/xdm-errors told me that X11
was complaining about the lack of /dev/tty0 (I had tty1 .. tty9, but
no tty0).  Since I've installed an out-of-the-box system, the lack of
this device comes as a bit of a surprise, and I was wondering if
anyone else had come across this, and what the solution was?

(I did `ln -s /dev/tty1 tty0' to get me going again, but I guess there
is probably a better way?)

FWIW, I'm using debian linux 1.3 (kernel 2.0.30).

&lt;Blatant Debian Advocacy begins&gt; 

In case anyone is interested (I've been reading a lot of Red Hat stuff
lately, but not much Debian, so I present this to balance the
equation...), I'm not a unix guru and have big sysadmin trainer wheels
on, but I've managed to install Debian by FTP, get a couple upgrades,
recompile the kernel, (add PnP support for an AWE32, etc), get PPP,
smail, LILO (+win95) going, and basically get a very solid system
going (which is faster and has more bells and whistles than my Sun at
work) with very little pain (OK, perhaps quite a few late nights!).
Full credit to the linux (and Debian) teams who have put together a
really good package!
