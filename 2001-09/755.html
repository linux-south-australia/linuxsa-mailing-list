&gt;Given the disaster caused by the recent Nimda worm/virus and 
&gt;other worms and virii, you might find them less one-eyed.
&gt;
&gt;It would be useful to find a value for the cost to us (givernment) in 
&gt;cleaning up after each of these attacks.
&gt;
&gt;Statements about the above should appear in such a letter.

It would be a very interesting exercise indeed.  We only have a small 
network here (70-80 PCs), with about 10 remote sites with about 12 PCs
in each on average.  Our network here was down for a day & a half last 
week while we cleaned up the workstations.  Five days later and we still
don't have internet access, email was down for about 2 days.

I was actually 400km offsite when it all went pear-shaped, and if it wasn't
for a Linux RAS box it would have been a lot worse, I was able to at least
get a couple cleanup scripts running on the Samba box to get rid of the eml
& nws files (all 40,000 of them, free disk space went from 4.5gb to 1.5gb in
a couple hours!)
