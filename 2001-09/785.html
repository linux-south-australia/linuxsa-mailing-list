At the risk of 'being commercial' I thought I would let people know 
about supplier recommendations.

I asked:
&gt; I am in the market for an 80mm CPU fan converter and fan, and a
&gt; 10/100 NIC, plus maybe 256M PC133 RAM.  Where could I go to obtain all
&gt; these things in the one place?

Replies were:

Your friendly computer person is what you need. As a registered 
business (Manning Computer Services) we get stuff at wholesale.

I am not sure about fans, but "Computers Reborn" (568-570 North East Rd.
Holden Hill) sells 10/100 nics for $10. For ram, it is just a matter of 
looking around as most shops sells 256M pc133 ram ~$60.

I have a friend who does this sort of stuff, but doesn't actually have a
shop as such. He will give you good prices on all of the stuff you have
mentioned. If you like, you can contact him (Adrian Beacham) on
0412842624.

You might like to try Ultrago. I have used them a bit, fairly good 
value and the thing I like is he delivers to your door (and he is good 
with warrantee).

Advanced Microsystems Research (AMR) has good quality stuff, most in 
stock and provides good service :-)
www.admicro.com.au

Try Adrenalin on Hindley street, I know they keep ram, network cards and
a fair range of fans and coolers in stock, normally.
I am sure there are many others too, but these are ones I have been to a
few times and seen their on shelf stock.

-----------------
I can vouch for AMR - bought my new mobo and case from them on the 
basis of service and advice received.
