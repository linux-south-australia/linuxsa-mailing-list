&gt; Hi, I'm looking for a way in the near future to add a disclaimer to all my
&gt; companies emails... What application package under linux do I need to look
&gt; at inorder to set something like this up? I'm currently running RH7.1 with
&gt; sendmail. I have been reading on sendmail FAQ but there isn't any
&gt; information on how to go about doing this. Perhaps I need to look at mailing
&gt; list software to accomplish this.

The very best way is to add it to everone's .signature
file.

This is for three reasons:

 1) Altering an e-mail in-flight breaks any cryptographic
    signatures such as S/MIME.  Altering all outgoing
    mail effectively prevents your users from sending
    encrypted mail.

 2) Disclaimers are not always appropiate.

 3) Not only people use e-mail.

I'd strongly suggest that you allow your users to send
encrypted mail.  You'll find it very useful for meeting
the upcoming privacy requirements.

As an example of (2) we still receive tender responses where the
sender disclaims them as being official correspondence of the
organisation.  We legally have to discard those.

You can certainly add text to the bottom of an e-mail
using sendmail.  See the content management API called
libmilter.

You also might find that your e-mail virus scanning software
can do the job.  For example, the VirusWall from Trend
Micro will add a "scanned OK" message if you want, and
this can be altered to a corporate disclaimer.

You won't find much help for adding disclaimers, as most
technical people see the breakage of signatures as
presenting more risk to the corporation than adding
a disclaimer ameliorates risk.  If your legal people are
advising you to add disclaimers then you should ensure
that they are aware of the disclaimer/signature trade off
so that they can correctly weigh the legal risks.

Regards,
Glen
