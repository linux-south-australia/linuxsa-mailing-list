&gt;Actually Simon, as far as Telstra is concerned I cannot get DSL and 
&gt;I only live 5.2k west of the CBD  the exhange DOES have DSL but they 
&gt;will not tell me why I cannot have it. ( I have spent the best part 
&gt;of 4 hours in 2 days on the phone trying to get an answer, and if I 
&gt;have to give my phone number out just one more time so they can tell 
&gt;me the "web-page indicates I cannot get it" I'll scream ;-)

If you placed an order with us we could find out the real rejection 
reason for you but it's not really going to help a lot if the answer 
is still 'no', is it...

&gt;I've written them in clear terms requesting a written reply, so we 
&gt;wait and see.
&gt;
&gt;PS no cable or DSL and so close to the city, something is not right...

Is this Adelaide you're referring to (there are more people outside 
of SA on this list than I'd previously expected).

&gt;To summarise
&gt;I live well within 3.5k of the exchange
&gt;The exchange is enabled
&gt;No one will tell me why

Most likely a pairgain situation, or the cable path to the exchange 
is not as direct as you might wish (and hence is &gt; 3.5k even though 
the radial distance might seem within the right realm).

&gt;And I guess from that no other dsl provider can offer it then?

There are alternatives to DSL. If you can see the roof of Santos 
House from your own roof, we can provide a wireless link instead. But 
it depends on whether you want to pay what works out to be a bit more 
than DSL, for an outcome a tad faster than DSL. Your call.

&gt;PPS Two way satelite will be on offer October but I have no idea 
&gt;about ping times etc etc... any one know more about it?
&gt;

Well I can tell you that our radio systems are faster than ADSL in 
terms of ping time (for rather silly reasons related mostly to how 
Telstra force ADSL wholesale data paths to work today)

Sat ping times are likely to be quite uninspiring. If you really want 
low ping times (games, one presumes), I'd suggest ISDN DoV if you 
can't get ADSL. Most good ISP's support DoV ISDN connections.
