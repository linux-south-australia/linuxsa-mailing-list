&gt;(except the bit about $42 a month, thats for two 64k lines).

You cannot buy one line. You can only buy two at a time, even if you 
don't want the second one.

So that's $42 per month, minimum spend, before call costs. So I was 
being accurate - if you want a 64k link, your minimum port rental 
cost is $42. Plus call costs. Plus ISP costs. Plus downloads (all of 
which are included in the SDSL offering).

&gt;But thats not what the release said. The relaease said:
&gt;
&gt;"times faster than ISDN) in both directions at the same time - at less
&gt;than the cost of a Telstra 64K ISDN line!"
&gt;
&gt;It didnt mention data,  it didnt mention calls costs, it didnt sepcify
&gt;what sort of isdn service.

It also didn't mention the current phase of the moon, mate. I had 
(incorrectly) assumed that it'd be obvious that I was comparing it 
with a 64k permanent link. I accept that it wasn't specific.

&gt;In addition it mentioned the cost of a 64k(not 128k) idsn line.
&gt;
&gt;So the ORHH example is really less $24 than what you say.

No, it isn't. See above.

&gt;No denyng your service is still cheaper overall and delivers far more, but
&gt;still, that is not what the release said.

I agree that what I said could be argued to be a bit ambiguous. What 
it comes down to is that everyone in a free country is able to make 
their own cost evaluation and judge for themselves.

Perhaps I should have compared the cost of 512K using ADSL to the 
cost of 512K using ISDN, where the comparison is dramatically in 
favour of ADSL economics. But in realistic terms, our customers are 
comparing ADSL to the costs of an existing or potential ISDN 64K link 
and coming to the obvious conclusion.

Lets drop this one at this point. Further nit-picking isn't all that 
exciting, is it.
