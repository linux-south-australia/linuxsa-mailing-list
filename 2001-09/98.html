Glen,

I did the RPM verify thing, and it appears that no critical files (that I
can see) are missing. The output of "rpm --verify -all" is here:
<A HREF="http://www.kingcc.com.au/rpmvry.txt">http://www.kingcc.com.au/rpmvry.txt</A>  could it be a hardware thing, ie. a
network card, it seems to only happen when a large stream of data has to be
sent OUT from the server. ie. if I use single line commands that get single
line answers in ssh, then I am fine, however for example if I do a 'ls' of a
large directory, it will stall after like the first 1 page, almost like a
send buffer or something like that is corrupt somewhere.
This machine is connected via a ethernet cable (100Mbps) to another linux
box which is the firewall and has the modem connected to it, then a 56k
modem connection to Telstra Bigpond Direct. I have not had any problems like
this up until the power failure the other night. Between then and now I have
not made any config changes on the machine either.
Here is an example of what happens when I try to get my mail and it times
out and stalls.
Netstat:
tcp        0  20582 jessie.kingcc.com.:pop3 ppp573.adelaide.on:1592 LAST_ACK

notice how there is still data in the send queue


Thanks for your help,

Kind Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; If not then there are RPM options to check the database against

&gt;
&gt; And how do I go about checking the RPM DB

The RPM manual page explains the "verify" option well enough.
Try something like
 rpm --verify -all
You'll need to use your judgement about some of the files
listed, especially if they are configuration files.  It's
probably best to restore any listed configuration files
from a recent backup tape.

&gt;... also /dev/hda8 is the /var directory, and that was the only
&gt; one that seemed affected, or that e2fsck picked up anyway

I'd humbly suggest that the RPM verify option will work
against the RPM DB from a CD if the one on disk is
found to be corrupt.  You could try and get a list of
packages from the RPM database on disk
  rpm --query --all
and then check
