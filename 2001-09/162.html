&gt; &gt; * He was connected to Telstra cable through his cable box BUT he was
&gt; &gt; installing Windows 2000 Server on the machine. The drive he was
&gt; &gt; installing on was completely blank. It had just been low-level
&gt; &gt; formatted via SCSI card. This happened at 3:30 AM GMT on Monday 3
&gt; &gt; September.
&gt; &gt; * He was NOT logged onto the cable service.
&gt;
&gt; However, unless the cable modem was off, there is indeed a live
&gt; connection there I believe.

This is correct.

&gt; Interesting... Either the Telstra cable offering doesn't actually *need*
&gt; you to login, or there's a way to force the cable modem to issue a dhcp
&gt; address anyway...

When the cable modem is connected to the cable network and the computer,
the machine issues a DHCP request and is assigned a valid IP.  The catch
is that you may not send packets out of the system until you have logged
on using their software.  So even if it is not logged in, the machine will
recieve packets via the cable, like a Code Red attack.

As its just a network interface, running it on UNIX is easy, all you do is
run dhclient (FreeBSD) or pump (Linux) on the NIC its plugged into and
then get a program called 'bplogin' to authenticate against Big Pond.
The program isn't supported by Telstra but was written by a former Big
Pond employee.
