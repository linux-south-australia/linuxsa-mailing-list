Hmm. I can't say i've ever tried to load their webpage.
But that aside, I've usually had decent service from leader. They're not
always the cheapest, but they usually seem to have what you want in stock,
and they carry a large range of stuff. Returns haven't been a problem
either.

Electronic communication definately isn't their strong point though - some
emails with them have ended up almost comical.
So yeah, give the phone a whirl.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think that this is the place to be complaining about Leader's
&gt; &gt; &gt; apparent lack of response. That's something you should take up with
&gt; &gt; &gt; them.  Ring them, or pop into their store. It's not that hard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't think I'll bother thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Then don't bother us, me or whoever.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I only mentioned it here cos I found it somewhat odd that they
&gt; &gt; appear to support linuxsa every so often (which is usually a sign
&gt; &gt; of a good company - supporting that type of thing) yet my
&gt; &gt; experiences of them (although brief) are not good at all.
&gt;
&gt; Yet, you're not willing to spend $0.20 and a few minutes of their your
&gt; time to find out whether or not they are actually worth talking
&gt; too. Strange, that.
