Hi.

I went through this saga a while ago. It's the second time RedHat has done
it, and it annoys the hell out of me. It's no good having rpm if it's
creator is going to break it without a clear method of upgrading an older
system. 

Anyway, if I remember correctly, I went to rpm.org and got hold of the
3.0.6 packages, you are correct when you say that the 3.0.5 packages are
missing from RH's 6.2 up2date packages. Why do they do that? It's like
they intentionally break the older release by not keeping the archive
current!

popt-1.5.1-6x.i386.rpm
rpm-3.0.6-6x.i386.rpm
rpm-build-3.0.6-6x.i386.rpm
rpm-devel-3.0.6-6x.i386.rpm

You do have to install them in one long rpm -Uvh command or they die with
locking dependencies. If you can't find them, I still have the originals
here, it's a couple of megs all up.

The system I was upgrading was RH6.1

&gt; Ahhhh, rpm-4....
&gt; 
&gt; Well, if you have db3-? installed, popt? installed and db3-util (I think),
&gt; you should be fine - to get around the dependencies, you need to rpm -Uvh
&gt; [all 3 of them at once].
&gt; 
&gt; I've had to do this for a few systems that are waiting for RH 7.2 and it
&gt; works fine.  However, I may have missed a package so YMMV...
&gt; 
&gt; I would have thought that you would have received some dependency messages
&gt; whilst trying to install this?

&gt; &gt; This began as a simple job to install an updated RPM on a RedHat 6.2
&gt; &gt; box. That was six hours ago, and it's still not installed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The RPM has been built using rpm version 4.something; and refuses to
&gt; &gt; install with 6.2's supplied rpm 3.0.4. There is a widely available rpm
&gt; &gt; 4.0 for RH 6.2, but it won't install with rpm 3.0.4 either! It wants
&gt; &gt; files from the original rpm 4.0, among other things, producing a
&gt; &gt; Catch-22... :(
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; RedHat did have rpm 3.0.5 - which allowed the rpm 4 update to happen -
&gt; &gt; on their FTP site; but I can't find it there or on any of the usual
&gt; &gt; mirrors now.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone still got a copy? Or a simple way to install the latest rpm
&gt; &gt; 4.whatever on RH6.2 - without getting entangled in a web of file
&gt; &gt; dependencies?
&gt; &gt;
