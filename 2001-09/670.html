Interesting Richard, very interesting indeed.
Looks like we will not have connection to the Net till next week.
We need to upgrade ALL workstation with service patch 2 for IE and fix 
up any servers etc etc

Today it appears the Parliament servers were hit again and went down 
(insert any caption you like here)
Needless to say no access has been a horrendous nightmare for us as we 
do on-line training and our students do CISCO on line in the USofA and 
that's not to mention the web-sites identified for study guides etc etc 
etc...
I can't say too much of the internals discussions bet let us say that 
there has been some "robust" conversations!
As for the EDS contract I believe there is 3yrs approx. left and an 
option for more of their high quality service in the future...
It is with joy in heart that look forward to the next few years under 
the benevolent rule.

&gt;&gt;No one seems to have mention it so I will.
&gt;&gt;Most of the Government Network has been unplugged from the Net since
&gt;&gt;Tuesday. (rumor has it they literally pulled the cable from the firewall
&gt;&gt;in blind panic)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;indeed they have... they also pulled individual agencies' plugs away
&gt;from statenet... it's sensible, but caused by overuse and
&gt;under-maintenance of MS products.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hospitals Education and other dept's are also down.
&gt;&gt;The network was trashed, including exchange servers by NIMBDA
&gt;&gt;EDS does not allow *BSD or Linux on their networks becuase they are not
&gt;&gt;safe!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;well, we have a number of Linux boxes running at DEH -- EDS will allow
&gt;them, but don't seem interested in touching them (which is a plus for
&gt;us -- it means we can run Linux boxes without EDS' interference...)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;This appears to be well hushed and should be made public, after all we,
&gt;&gt;the taxpayers,  pay EDS substantial amount money to look after our
&gt;&gt;infrastructure.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The EDS contract is a monumentally stupid one, and will remain in
&gt;force for some time -- it will, no doubt, be re-signed, if only to
&gt;ensure that the signees don't look stupid by changing it too much...
&gt;the dangers of outsourcing to one organisation are similar to the
&gt;dangers of standardising on one organisation's products...
