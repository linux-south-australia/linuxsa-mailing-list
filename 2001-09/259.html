&gt; The really bad thing about that is that the extensive RedHat menu
&gt; which contains "Internet &gt; RH PPP dialer" and the "Dialup Configuration
&gt; Tool" is also part of the KDE menu, so I have no X tool with which to
&gt; connect to the Internet if I am logged in as root :-(
&gt; 
&gt; A small point, but it might be important, is that none of the RedHat
&gt; games work - the console messages show "/bin/sh command not found"
&gt; in every case (WHY is it looking in /bin/sh ???  or is that just the
&gt; last of the places it looked?)
&gt; 
&gt; Could these troubles be connected with the fact that I installed the
&gt; Ximian upgrade as superuser, rather than as root?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your help
&gt; 


Brian, I had exactly the same problems on my system after installing (as
root)
a retail copy of Ximian I won at the installfest. Ximian screwed my
menus and 
other parts of the system around so much that I just decided to re-ghost
rather
than trying to change it all back. I was very disappointed to see that
all
my KDE menus in Ximian had disappeared and vice versa.

Does anyone know why this happens? I am sure that this cannot be caused
be any sort
of incompatibility issue, or is it?

I thought that deliberately restrictive software antics were confined to
the 
"other" platform.

I have since vowed never to use Ximian again.
