I can't seem to mount a floppy on the FreeBSD computer so I am unable to get 
a full copy of the dmesg.boot to post.

The full line of when the card is probed during the search for PNP devices is:

CSN 1 Vendor ID: EDI0119 [0x19018914] Serial 0x9d7a85b4 Comp ID:@@@0000 
[0x00000]

And the output during the ISA probe is:

ie0: unknown board _id : f000
ie0 not found at 0x300



As for the floppy issue...

After using the command 			fdformat /dev/fd0
and answering y when asked if I want to format it as a 1440K floppy
I see a whole lot of format/verify steps and then it completes.

I then immediately try to mount it using	mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
and I get an error message saying it has an incorrect superblock structure.

Is the floppy screwed or am I missing something?

Cheers,
Shane.

&gt;
&gt; Can you send the output of 'dmesg'?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Most web paes I have read on similar problems, usually with other devices
&gt; &gt; such as modems, suggest putting values into file and recompiling kernels
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt;
&gt; The GENERIC kernel usually covers a fair bit, but you may need to
&gt; recompile. To do that, I'd recommend you update your sources. The
&gt; easiest way to do that would be to install FreeBSD-4.4
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I performed a bare minimum installation on an old 486sx with the
&gt; &gt; intention of using it as a small (test) SMTP/POP server, or at the very
&gt; &gt; least a SAMBA server, and so I did not install anything that would be
&gt; &gt; required if this was to be done.  Installing this stuff is a difficult
&gt; &gt; proposition as well since there is no means if connecting a CDROM to the
&gt; &gt; machine.
&gt;
&gt; How did you install the software in the first place if there is no means
&gt; of connecting a CD-ROM?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to go about manually
&gt; &gt; configuring FreeBSD 3.4 (I know it's not the latest) to utilise the
&gt; &gt; network card?
&gt;
&gt; Does the board have a PCI slot? A $20 RealTek may be acceptable.
&gt;
&gt; Even without a PCI slot, I'm sure digging up an n-hand 3Com ISA card
&gt; wouldn't be too hard.
