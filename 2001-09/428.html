&gt; &gt; heh -- ok, I'll try that next time... this time, I managed to get it all
&gt; &gt; right by re-installing about ten times... the fdisk is the most stupid
&gt; &gt; fdisk in the world, and by default creates overlapping partitions (by 1
&gt; &gt; cylinder...)... I just created a partition that had plenty of margin on
&gt; &gt; each side, and all worked ok...
&gt; 
&gt; hey?  you're not referring to slice 2 - the overlap are you?
&gt; if you mean multiple fdisk partitions on the one disk, rather
&gt; than multiple solaris slices, then I've no experience, i've
&gt; always only done the whole disk as solaris.

nah -- there's two levels of partitioning as far as I can see --
you create a Solaris partition, and then within that, you do the
normal solaris slicing...  however, the fdisk program starts the
solaris partition (which is a primary partition) on the same cylinder
as the windows partition ends... (duh!)

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; interesting... we have used Xi before, but would rather keep away from
&gt; &gt; it... I'm still bitter about the infernal stupidity of Solaris, especially
&gt; &gt; the installer, especially on x86 and especially on laptops... Surely
&gt; &gt; someone can make a SPARC laptop (perhaps a crusoe-based one... maybe a
&gt; &gt; microcode change to a crusoe vaio... :)
&gt; 
&gt; a sparc laptop would be very nice!!
&gt; 
&gt; I've never installed solaris on a laptop but have on plenty of
&gt; sparc and "normal" x86 stuff.  The installer has always worked
&gt; fine for me (mind you I do it the "old way" - not the new web
&gt; start way, and I've never setup xwindows on anything other than
&gt; sparc machines).  And as for "infernal stupidity of Solaris" - I 
&gt; hate to say it, but solaris makes more sense to me than linux.
&gt; I suspect it's one of those how used to it you are things, and
&gt; solaris isn't, and has never pretended to be, an OS for the
&gt; non-familiar (I was going to say "newbie" there but it makes it
&gt; sound a bit derogatory!).
&gt; 

yeah, I think it's actually stupid in this case ... if a partitioning
program can't do simple things like let me create a partition that
uses the rest of the disk, without overlapping, then it's a crap
partitioning program... if the installer runs the partitioning
program, and you create a partition that, for all intents and
purposes, is correct (starts the cylinder after the last partition,
ends with the last cylinder), and then the install program prints an
error message, and immediately restarts the partitioning program,
which covers over the error message, then there is no word for that
apart from stupid (actually, there are a surprising number of words
for that, but they are all synonymous with stupid)...

And yeah, I think that most of this trouble comes from running Solaris
x86 on laptops that are unsupported, but that's not going to stop me
complaining :)

&gt; And re where to go for solaris help, don't forget sunsolve,
&gt; (<A HREF="http://sunsolve.sun.com">http://sunsolve.sun.com</A>) you can even get a login free
&gt; (which gives you more access).
&gt; 
&gt; and while I'm mentioning web sites: 
&gt; www.sunfreeware.com
&gt; www.sunhelp.org
&gt; www.sunshack.org
&gt; www.sunrk.com.au
&gt; www.stokely.com (general sysadmin and sun stuff)

Thanks :)
