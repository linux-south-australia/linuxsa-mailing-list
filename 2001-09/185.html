Hi.

And the lesson is: Don't connect a box to the network until you have
finished installation/configuration.

I've seen internet users hitting an anon FTP server within about a minute
of setting it up.

As for not installing IIS, be careful - he may have been installing
something that _requires_ IIS, and therefore did. Sounds like he has left
the dark side now anyway, but if he repeated the exact same install
(without the cable connection), it would be interesting to see if IIs was
in there anyway...

&gt; My friend has just had his system Code Red'd and it is causing great

&gt; This one is very different to the normal email borne attack. There 
&gt; wasn't a logged in connection to the Internet. There wasn't any email 
&gt; to run. There wasn't any operator error to run any program.
&gt; 
&gt; * He was connected to Telstra cable through his cable box BUT he was 
&gt; installing Windows 2000 Server on the machine. The drive he was 
&gt; installing on was completely blank. It had just been low-level 
&gt; formatted via SCSI card. This happened at 3:30 AM GMT on Monday 3 
&gt; September. 
&gt; * He was NOT logged onto the cable service. 
&gt; * He had especially selected IIS to NOT be installed.
&gt; * Left machine running to complete installations and only had the Admin 
&gt; password entered.
&gt; * Came back to machine several hours later and noticed that cable modem 
&gt; was going mental.
&gt; * Tried logging into his 2000 Server but was refused 3 times, "Machine 
&gt; in use by other user. Only Administrator and user have access (VPN)"
&gt; * Turned machine off. Then on. Logged in straight away. 
&gt; * Loaded up their proprietary login software. Could not log into ISP. 
&gt; Contacted ISP who suggested it may a virus problem but they insisted 
&gt; that he must have been running other software, could not have come 
&gt; through them. 
&gt; * After installing NAV 2001 he did a Live Update. Then he restarted his 
&gt; machine and did a scan which detected Trojan Virtual Root = Code Red II.
&gt; 
&gt; So far it has caused over 1.5 G of outgoing traffic through his cable 
&gt; account but no emails were installed so it has not gone to any of his 
&gt; contacts AFAIK. It has caused failures in mother boards and hard drives 
&gt; and he is now trying hard to recover urgently needed software without 
&gt; passing on the trojan. 
&gt; 
&gt; He will be low-level formatting all drives then installing Linux and 
&gt; swears to never again use MS products unless required for his work with 
&gt; clients. 
&gt; 
&gt; If we can be hit by these mongrels during an install of MS Software 
&gt; what hope do we have that we will be safe from any kind of viral attack.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and I can verify that all the above events happened in the sequence 
&gt; as described.
