&gt; 
&gt; You cannot buy one line. You can only buy two at a time, even if you 
&gt; don't want the second one.
&gt; 
&gt; So that's $42 per month, minimum spend, before call costs. So I was 
&gt; being accurate - if you want a 64k link, your minimum port rental 
&gt; cost is $42. Plus call costs. Plus ISP costs. Plus downloads (all of 
&gt; which are included in the SDSL offering).

But you can use the second one for soemthing eelse, eg liek a phone.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;But thats not what the release said. The relaease said:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"times faster than ISDN) in both directions at the same time - at less
&gt; &gt;than the cost of a Telstra 64K ISDN line!"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It didnt mention data,  it didnt mention calls costs, it didnt sepcify
&gt; &gt;what sort of isdn service.
&gt; 
&gt; It also didn't mention the current phase of the moon, mate. I had 
&gt; (incorrectly) assumed that it'd be obvious that I was comparing it 
&gt; with a 64k permanent link. I accept that it wasn't specific.

You didnt talk abotu a lot of things.
You did talk about the cost of your product vs the cost of anotehr
product, which you fairly narrowly defined, or at least descrivbed in a
way which coudl be interpreted in  a fairly narorow way if you only used
the words you supplied.

&gt; &gt;In addition it mentioned the cost of a 64k(not 128k) idsn line.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;So the ORHH example is really less $24 than what you say.
&gt; 
&gt; No, it isn't. See above.

Well yes it is.
It a matter of if you want absolute cost or practical cost.

The cost of a 64k link is 0.5 the cost of a 128 klink.

You cant buy them separately thats true.

I would go so far as to say what you have said is practically correct and
what I have siad is techinically correct.

We dont have to agree though.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;No denyng your service is still cheaper overall and delivers far more, but
&gt; &gt;still, that is not what the release said.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree that what I said could be argued to be a bit ambiguous. What 
&gt; it comes down to is that everyone in a free country is able to make 
&gt; their own cost evaluation and judge for themselves.

Thats true, but I also think they shoudl make it on accurate
unambiguous info.

If you dont do that you becaome like your competitors, who you
legitimmatley in may cases "cane".


&gt; Perhaps I should have compared the cost of 512K using ADSL to the 
&gt; cost of 512K using ISDN, where the comparison is dramatically in 
&gt; favour of ADSL economics. But in realistic terms, our customers are 
&gt; comparing ADSL to the costs of an existing or potential ISDN 64K link 
&gt; and coming to the obvious conclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; Lets drop this one at this point. Further nit-picking isn't all that 
&gt; exciting, is it.

No its not all that exciting.

I just really  object to ambiguous statements like that.
And will always call them if I see them.
