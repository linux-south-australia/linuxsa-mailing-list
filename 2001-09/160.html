This is true.

&gt; What about Frontpage Express or the Web Publishing Wizard?

There's been quite a few incidents of people who have installed
2000, selected IIS not to be installed but had it installed
anyway.  I _think_ it may have been a dependency issue (i.e. some
other product depended on it), but the installer doesn't show you
that sort of information (it would detract from the user's
experience, doncha know), and it was on NT, so I lost interest
pretty quickly.

&gt; But really, the golden rule when building any box is to make sure it's
&gt; not physically connected to the internet until you've got it installed
&gt; and secured (if at all possible).

Ain't that the truth (waves in Hindmarsh's direction).
