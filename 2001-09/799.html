<H1>Linux demo to SA Government Dept</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
On Wednesday (3 Oct) in the afternoon I will be making a presentation 
to a dozen or more administration-level people in DHS (Dept Human 
Services). They have made a committment to release 6,000 older 
computers out to the community and schools.

My demo will be to show them Linux (RH 7.1) and Star Office 5.2 running 
on one of their computers.

They are reported to be very interested in providing an alternative to 
the community in the face of the licensing nightmare that comes by 
following the MS path as well as the prediliction for MS products to be 
hit by viral attacks.

I think you can see the potential boost to alternative OS's and 
StarOffice if they are able to release 6,000 Linux boxes out into the 
community each year. This underlies the importance of making a 
successful demonstration.

If there is an experienced Linux person, who can also present to that 
level of audience, I would be glad to have their help in the 
presentation. 

If there is a Linux guru in the northern area who would not mind taking 
a look at the demo box over the next few days just to confirm that all 
the bits are in the right place and it works as it should I would be 
very grateful.

Email me off list or call 0402 282 067.

Cheers, Ian Loxton
