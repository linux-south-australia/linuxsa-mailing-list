Hmmm...

&gt; LMAO

This means "Laughing My Arse Off". It generally marks a sense of humour
or that the person writing it is having a bit of fun.

&gt; &gt;           Wow.  Someone has already thought of every
&gt; &gt;           possible question and
&gt; &gt;           written a HOWTO on the subject haven't they? =)

That is called context. If one forgets the subject, I have provided the
context.

NOTE: Look up context at <A HREF="http://www.dictionary.com/">http://www.dictionary.com/</A> or Oxford Dictionary
or the Macquarie dictionary.

&gt; That's right. The only question that remains unanswered is the:

What is right? Let's look at the context:

&gt; &gt;           Wow.  Someone has already thought of every
&gt; &gt;           possible question and
&gt; &gt;           written a HOWTO on the subject haven't they? =

That seems a reasonable statement to me.

However, I have not read a manual which has this purpose yet:

&gt; "How to Make Them Read the F*!@##$G Manuals or Howtos and Other
&gt; Documentation Before Asking Dumbass Questions (R)"

So what I was actually saying was:

"There are HOWTO's on everything but noone's written one about how to
help people read them or find them so that they don't make fools of
themselves accidentally".

Knowing the antics of this list, someone is likely to be highly offended
by that last statement for some obscure reason and a flame war will
erupt on a subject not at all to do with fonts or HOWTOs...

*sheesh*
