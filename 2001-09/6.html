Hi All,
    This is a true story that might help.

    Once upon a time, there was a customer who brought his
machine back to the workshop for a noisy fan to be replaced.
The Technician on duty tested the machine on the bench, and
found nothing wrong with the fan and explained this to the
customer. The customer insisted that the fan was too noisy
and wanted it replaced. The Customer, being right in all
circumstances, had it explained to them that a fan was a
fan, and they were all like that, but he insisted that his
friend had a "quiet fan he bought from some place else" and
he wanted one. The customer was then asked if he could find
out where his friend got this "quiet fan" from, then the
company was willing to purchase and install the fan for the
customer at the appropriate service charge rate. The
customer agreed to this and left his machine at the workshop
while he went home and called his friend. A short time later
the customer phoned back with the details. The Workshop then
arranged for one of these "quiet fans" to be purchased, and
installed it, and called back the customer, who agreed that
the "Repair" was satisfactory, and collected his machine and
paid the rather expensive Workshop fees. A few days later,
the customer was back, complaining that we had "ripped him
off" and that we hadn't got one of these "quiet fans" for
him at all, and threatened legal action and other such
nastiness. The Customer was then shown the invoice from the
company who he himself recommended that sold the workshop
the fans, and agreed that we hadn't "ripped him off"and that
obviously we hadn't installed it right, or it was a
different one. He then insisted we get a replacement, and he
would pay for the repair work. Again, the workshop purchased
a "different quiet fan" from the company and installed it in
the customers machine and the customer collected and paid
for the machine, and was satisfied with the result of the
repair and took it home. Again a few days later, the
customer brought his machine back complaining of a "noisy
fan" and insisted we fix it, so finally the Tech staff, who
were getting inwardly quite pissed off with this idiot
customer (sorry, I forgot - the Customer is ALWAYS right),
fixed it. One of the technicians had four 5c rubber grommets
in their toolkit and fitted them between the case and the
fan on the customer's computer. The end result - a quiet
breeze out the back of the computer. The other results - the
customer ended paying over $250 for 2 fans and numerous
hours of workshop time to install a "quiet fan" into his
computer. He also "didn't want" the 2 spare fans he had paid
for that were taken out of his machine and agreed to give
them to the workshop. We never heard from the customer again
until 3 years later when he bought a new machine from the
company and insisted that we fit another "quiet fan" prior
to delivery. The workshop then installed another 20c worth
of rubber grommets, charged the customer $65 for an hours
work, shook their heads in disbelief that anyone was so
stupid (twice!) and went to the pub early that day for some
liquid stress relief. I still have one of the  fans in my
toolkit.

    Just an aside, Amstrad Computers, about 15-20 years ago
had a fanless case that was engineered specifically NOT to
have a fan and NOT overheat. The idea failed miserably and
it was taken off the market after only a few months because
people were worried because they "couldn't hear the fan". I
should think that these days CPUs run so hot that it would
be very difficult to manufacture such an animal as a
convection cooled case like Amstrad did all those years ago,
but this discussion came up a year or too ago as I remember
on this list, and maybe there is something in the archives.
Anyhow, hope this helps a little.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Quiet PCs...


&gt; Hi all...
&gt;
&gt; This has come up before, but I'm wondering if anything new
has come to
&gt; light...
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know of any PCs around that are particularly
quiet... I
&gt; want a reliable, quiet Linux Server, and performance won't
really be
&gt; an issue, it just needs to be cheap and quiet (and
reliable, but that
&gt; goes without saying, right? :) Of course, it all needs to
be linux
&gt; compatible as well..
&gt;
&gt; Alternatively, if noone really knows of anyone providing
such a
&gt; device, would there be a great deal of interest in one if
I could find
&gt; appropriate components and build a few at a reasonable
price?
