&gt;     Just an aside, Amstrad Computers, about 15-20 years ago
&gt; had a fanless case that was engineered specifically NOT to
&gt; have a fan and NOT overheat. The idea failed miserably and
&gt; it was taken off the market after only a few months because
&gt; people were worried because they "couldn't hear the fan". I
&gt; should think that these days CPUs run so hot that it would
&gt; be very difficult to manufacture such an animal as a
&gt; convection cooled case like Amstrad did all those years ago,
&gt; but this discussion came up a year or too ago as I remember
&gt; on this list, and maybe there is something in the archives.
&gt; Anyhow, hope this helps a little.

That would be the amstrad xt types I imagine. I had one of these laying 
around, and actually the remains are laying outside in a junk pile right now. 
The 'trick' with the amstrad was to have no power supply in the case at all. 
They were only an 8086 or whatever, so no CPU fan, and the rest of the power 
supply was contained in the monitor - with no fan. This system worked fine... 
It had a special connector tween the monitor and box - and obviously they had 
to be used together... The mono monitors were okay, but the colour ones used 
a tv tube and left something to be desired. They also used aa batteries for 
the clock which was a different idea... They were not a really great machine 
and had limitted upgrade options and not a great screen and a plastic case 
and various other faults. I think I paid $25 for the one I had. 

Indeed I also had a dick smith xt that had no fan as I remember. It was 
pretty quiet until I put the 20meg HD in, then it made a little noise... 
However the 87 watt power supply died in that box and I replaced it with a 
standard 150 watt unit - which didn't fit in the case but sat outside nearby 
:-)
