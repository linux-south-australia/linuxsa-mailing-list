&gt; Hi all, i was just wondering if there is any documentation on how to
&gt; administor a network. I'm talking things like. what mount points may be best
&gt; on a server, what type of permissions should be set on various areas, what
&gt; kind of admin users should be setup.

As usual, it depends what you want to acheive...

A place where I work has /usr/local/ mounted centrally, with different
actual mounts depending on the OS and version (Linux, Solaris, etc).
We also mount a few other dirs, /home/$username, /project and so on.
The home dirs are pretty obvious. The other ones are mainly data for
projects and so on.

Permissions -- well, we use groups and users and set permissions
appropriately... :)

Users: the sysadmins have the normail "mortal" user accounts, just
like everyone else, using the same naming convention as everyone else,
and then we have our sys acounts, which have sudo access to root, and
a few other special permissions. These are named differently (eg
sysrar -- "sys" then initials). There are a number of other accounts
around the place -- each project has a &lt;proj&gt;cm user, for the
configuration manager, and a &lt;proj&gt;rel user, for doing project
releases... etc... I''m not saying this system is ideal (far from it),
but it's the way we work, mainly due to history... 

One other thing that we do is separate the UIDs a little -- sys users
are UID 200-300ish, normal users, 1000-1999, ftp users, 2000-2999,
etc... We also try to keep uids synchronised between our NIS
environment and our various non-NIS environments...

HTH -- it's not gospel, but it's a few ideas...
