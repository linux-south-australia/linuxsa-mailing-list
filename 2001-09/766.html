&gt;* Star Office 5.2 did not display it correctly and also 
&gt;crashed. So much
&gt;for keeping up with the Word format. I originally thought Star 
&gt;Office 5.2
&gt;did a reasonably good job as far as the Word format is 
&gt;concerend. On the
&gt;other hand, Word might have crashed as well.

Welcome to Word 2000, compatible with previous versions of Word
and not with anything else.
I also get a wholesale pricelist which is produced in Excel 2000,
it ONLY opens in Excel 2000 and gives "out of memory" errors in
Excel 97, and refuses to open in Staroffice properly.
They also do their pricelist in pdf, no prizes for guessing which
one i use.


&gt;* It outlines that a bad choice was used without question when 
&gt;users use
&gt;what they are given without thought, even if just the 
&gt;bandwidth issues are
&gt;questioned. Even HTML would have been better. I pray that DSL was not a
&gt;recipient.

I prefer RTF for documents if I use Word.  At least I don't have to 
install Office on NT servers to read documents, Wordpad understands
RTF but not DOC, unless its Word 6.
