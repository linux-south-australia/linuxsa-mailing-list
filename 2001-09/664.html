&gt; Most of the Government Network has been unplugged from the Net since
&gt; Tuesday. (rumor has it they literally pulled the cable from the firewall
&gt; in blind panic)

indeed they have... they also pulled individual agencies' plugs away
from statenet... it's sensible, but caused by overuse and
under-maintenance of MS products.

&gt; Hospitals Education and other dept's are also down.
&gt; The network was trashed, including exchange servers by NIMBDA
&gt; EDS does not allow *BSD or Linux on their networks becuase they are not
&gt; safe!!!

well, we have a number of Linux boxes running at DEH -- EDS will allow
them, but don't seem interested in touching them (which is a plus for
us -- it means we can run Linux boxes without EDS' interference...)

&gt; 
&gt; This appears to be well hushed and should be made public, after all we,
&gt; the taxpayers,  pay EDS substantial amount money to look after our
&gt; infrastructure.

The EDS contract is a monumentally stupid one, and will remain in
force for some time -- it will, no doubt, be re-signed, if only to
ensure that the signees don't look stupid by changing it too much...
the dangers of outsourcing to one organisation are similar to the
dangers of standardising on one organisation's products...
