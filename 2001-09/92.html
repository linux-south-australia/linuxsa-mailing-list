&gt; It looks like you've lost a few blocks out of some essential
&gt; files.  If you run tripwire you are laughing.

I aint laughing

&gt; If not then there are RPM options to check the database against
&gt; the files on disk.  You'll need to check the /usr/local files
&gt; by hand -- it's probably quicker to rebuild these.

And how do I go about checking the RPM DB, also /dev/hda8 is the /var
directory, and that was the only one that seemed affected, or that e2fsck
picked up anyway

&gt; You might consider a UPS.  These have a link to a serial
&gt; port on your computer and thus you can close the machines
&gt; down gracefully upon a power failure.

Yes well, if I had it my way there would have been an UPS on the machine,
but someone else decided that it was not warranted, I warned them, they
didn't care, now they have to pay the price, now I have to try and fix a
half stuffed server from remote. And to make my life even more difficult ssh
seems to be doing the same thing.

Regards,

Michael
