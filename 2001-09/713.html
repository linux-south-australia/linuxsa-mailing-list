&gt; &gt; &gt; Eg. how will you stop someone telnet'ing out to port 25 at
&gt; &gt; &gt; largepuddle.com and doing the smtp stuff manually?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Quite simply -- you deny access to the outside world on port 25. Better
&gt; &gt; yet, deny it completely and use proxies (and allow access to individual
&gt; &gt; machines manually).
&gt; 
&gt; Or transparently proxy it, just like web traffic. That way no-one needs
&gt; to change their settings, and spam sending applications or unauthorized
&gt; mail servers are subject to a central point of control.

well how about telnet/ssh'ing to a shell account at an ISP and sending
mail or using a port other than 25, or using web mail etc?
(depending what exactly you're trying to prevent by restricting
email destinations)

My point was that it's no good setting up your MTA to restrict
addresses it can send to and then feeling all satisfied that that's
taken care of.

Maybe it's good enough in this situation, if as the guy who originally
asked (sorry was it Peter?) says the people in question have just 
mastered using a mouse.  I was attempting to point out that there's
more than one way to skin a cat.
