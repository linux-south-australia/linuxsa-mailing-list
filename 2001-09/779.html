&gt;However, I don't hate Micro$oft products.  They annoy the hell 
&gt;out of me a
&gt;lot of the time, but that doesn't mean that a correctly configured
&gt;server/workstation is a complete waste of time.

I wouldn't say I hate MS products either.  But over the time that I've
been using Linux in our environment, it has become increasingly clear 
that in a lot of scenarios, MS software (server-based) just doesn't 
have what it takes to match Linux.  And that doesn't include cost as 
a factor.  As soon as you bring cost into the equation the difference 
is obvious.


&gt;My biggest complaint with Micro$oft is actually the Office 
&gt;Suite with the
&gt;proprietary formats.  I see greater benefit in going along 
&gt;this track too
&gt;with the government rather than making any sort of religious battle.
&gt;Religion will often get in the way of sensible discussion.  
&gt;However, even
&gt;in religion there are reasons for it being a "religion".  They don't
&gt;necessarily apply these days, but they do exist.

Thats one of my pet hates too.  We pay an inordinate amount for the
"privilege" of having Office on our machines.  I'd question the logic
when probably 1 person out of 100 goes even close to using SOME of the
advanced features, and probably 80/100 of our users don't use anything
other than Word and Outlook.
Then you have the proprietary formats................sigh!

(says he who is using Outlook for his email........ ;o)
