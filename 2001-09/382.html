&gt; I have also been very curious as to the '+'s and '-'s of FreeBSD and how it
&gt; compares to Linux and Solaris. Any care to respond?

I think it depends on the application the machine will be used for and the
knowledge of the user.  I use FreeBSD on everything so maybe im the wrong
person to ask but I have tryed most distrib's of Linux, all versions of
FreeBSD since 2 and Solaris 2.7/7/8.

My opinion is that Linux is more suited to the end user environment,
everything runs in an X window and you are bombarded with more apps on a
default install than you can poke a stick at, for me, thats bad.

Solaris is nice, im quite fond of the CDE environment, but you need a road
map to get yourself around its array of tools and the funny places it puts
things, you get use to it after a while (we use it here).

FreeBSD however I think has overcome all of that.  My major gripe with
Linux was the binaries and files it chucked in weird locations and
installing stuff in /etc.  Removing a program was a nightmare due to this
random placing of stuff.  I have to congratulate the creator of the ports
tree, and most FreeBSD users will agree, its the best thing since sliced
bread.  Everything has a rightful place, uninstalling is easy and usabilty
is a treat.

Performance wise, I think FreeBSD is better.  We had a file server which
had data corrupted when the battery on the UPS went flat whilst a power
outage a numbedr of times.  The filesystem on *BSD survives such
occurences and has been running solid since the start of the year, my
baby (sanctuary) is home to 2000+ students with no complaints.

Just my $0.02 :)
