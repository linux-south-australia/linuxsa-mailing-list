&gt; Hi!

howdy...

&gt; 
&gt; This being such a knowledgable group I thought maybe someone might be
&gt; able to give me some idea of why things are suddenly not working for me.
&gt; I have been using telnet to connect to a machine in the US for quite
&gt; some time and it has been working even since the disaster.  This week
&gt; though I simply cannot get past the "Connected to X.  Escape character
&gt; is '^]'" bit!  It just sits there until timed out.  I did connect once
&gt; today but then soon into things it started to lag a lot... in fact it
&gt; disconnected. :-(
&gt; This hints it is something other than the other end being the problem.

it's possible that the other end is just insanely busy -- have you
tried (when you were able to connect) doing a `top` or a (from memory)
`ps -e -o pcpu,args | sort -n` to see if there is masses of cpu usage?
Perhaps try `time ls` and `time echo hello` to see if it actually
takes a long time to process or if it's in the network...

However, I think it's more likely to be a network thing... When did it
stop working? Tuesday perhaps? Familiar with NIMDA? It's a virus that
has a DDoS side-effect. Use traceroute (or mtr) and see if the links
are congested...
