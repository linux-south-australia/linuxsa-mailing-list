Hi,

A while ago when I was messing around with some hardware projects with 
PIC micros and what not, I would really have loved having a logic 
analyser and an oscilloscope.

Then I came across BitScope (www.bitscope.com). Lo and behold, it was an 
Australian-designed product with an open hardware design, was quite 
low-cost, had an analog bandwidth of 300MHz, used a moderately fast A-D 
converter (40MS/s), could potentially handle signals up to 100MHz with 
sub-sampling, and could capture 8 digital signals at 50MS/s. To top it 
off, it connected to a computer via a serial port, and was supported 
with Windows and UNIX programs (xoscope, for example, 
xoscope.sourceforge.net).

Just reading the technical material on their site was enough to make me 
drool, but discussions with them have revealed that they are working on 
Kylix_OE interfacing tools for Linux, are looking at Ethernet 
interfaces, and faster A-D converters (10-bit 80MS/s or 105MS/s etc).

What a wonderful concept. I thought you all would like to know!
