&gt;     I heard an unconfirmed rumour that the next Major
&gt; release of Star Office (ver6.0) would actually be much more
&gt; machine friendly and run in a slightly different format. The
&gt; major change I heard was that instead of loading up the
&gt; whole thing as it does now, taking up heaps of memory etc,
&gt; it will load each part as a module and only use the
&gt; resources as required. I guess that this would mean that if
&gt; you run just the text processor, then it just uses that many
&gt; resources, but if you run each separate bit of it, it would
&gt; run much the same as it does now. I will be awaiting with
&gt; interest for more details.

I think that was probably the first thing that the OpenOffice people did
when they got their hands on the code.

AFAIK, StarOffice suffered a two main problems in it's 5.x incarnations.
Firstly, it's statically linked. According to the person that I spoke to
at Sun, this basically equates to more memory usage. 

Also, it doesn't share memory. So, if you open up 20 instances of
StarOffice, it loads all the libraries 20 times. That kinda sucks, you
know :-)

Secondly, the SSDI (Super-Single Document Interface) that StarDivision
(the original authors of StarOffice) chose required a heap of resources
too.

The performance of 5.2 on my laptop is somewhat dispicable. I'd have to
say that it runs quite nicely on the SunBlade 100[1] that I've got at
the moment.

The people that I've spoken to at Sun (especially the sales people :-)
assure me that the next release will be fully "modulized" and will enjoy
massive improvements in the memory usage area.

[1] OK, so the SunBlade's got 512MB RAM and a 500MHz UltraSPARC
processor... So what? :-) I've seen it run *really* fast, but that was
on a Sun E250 with more RAM than you can poke a stick at. Multiple
UltraSPARC processors too :-)
