However, I don't hate Micro$oft products.  They annoy the hell out of me a
lot of the time, but that doesn't mean that a correctly configured
server/workstation is a complete waste of time.

My biggest complaint with Micro$oft is actually the Office Suite with the
proprietary formats.  I see greater benefit in going along this track too
with the government rather than making any sort of religious battle.
Religion will often get in the way of sensible discussion.  However, even
in religion there are reasons for it being a "religion".  They don't
necessarily apply these days, but they do exist.

Look, I don't care if I have to pay for good software.  I respect that the
intelligent people that write good software deserve an income too.  What I
really care about is the standards.

I want to be able to read a word document, but I don't want to have to use
a specific product to read it.  I want to be able to view a web page
without having a specific product and I want to be able to set-up a
network with shared resources and have it not matter what OS the user is
using.

Of course, this is a Utopia.  I believe that this is where we should be
headed.  Fortunately for us, Linux often follows standards so that we can
share our documents (whatever they may be) to anyone.

The open-letter to the NZ govt addresses some of these issues.  And again,
I repeat that I don't mind paying for good software that performs as I
would expect based on the good documentation available.

&gt; Personally I'd like to start a similar process with the SA govt.
&gt; How far one would get I'm not sure, the unfortunate part is that
&gt; the people making the decisions in govt. are extremely one-eyed &
&gt; close-minded to anything other than MS.  The people who make the
&gt; decisions are also people who have no idea what life is like at
&gt; "ground level" so to speak.
&gt;
&gt; I'm kinda hoping that some of the virus problems we're having in
&gt; the govt. network will open a few eyeballs that MS isn't all its
&gt; cracked up to be.  (And boy is it cracking up lately...........!)
