&gt; (way before my time, but wasn't the industry already there before??? :o)
&gt; Certainly the Housing Trust have thin clients (or NCs, as the buzzword is)
&gt; pretty much across the board) 
&gt; Unfortunately theyre all running Windows off Citrix Metaframe, but certainly
&gt; I agree in moving back to a thin client architecture.  The only downside is 
&gt; that outside of the metro area, WAN infrastructure is woefully inadequate to
&gt; support it.

Given the status of Linux on the Sega Dreamcast, if it was still being
produced and included the ethernet adapter, it would make a fantastic thin
client. Hmm, maybe not, if the display is only 640x480. But that would be
perfect for a small information system for looking up results and
mainframe access.
