&gt; &gt;I think that we will have to expend some effort to get them to 
&gt; &gt;change course ...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not necessarily advocating a total change away from MS in 
&gt; government.  Yes I'd like to see it happen, but it is so well
&gt; entrenched that a total change is counter-productive, at least
&gt; in the short term.  I'd like to see at the very least that OSS
&gt; is given an equal footing and isn't on the list of "software thou
&gt; shalt not use", because once IT people start using it in their 
&gt; environments the benefits will start to show up.
&gt; 
&gt; Not all IT people in government are up to speed with Linux anyway,
&gt; and it would take more than a few successful instances of it to 
&gt; convince them.  Certainly we've convinced a number of people just
&gt; through our simple uses of it in the server environment.  We've 
&gt; got a Samba PDC at almost all of our sites at present, the only 
&gt; reason we keep one NT machine on the network is because of a Progress
&gt; database app.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Agreed. I think there is no excuse for not using linux/FreeBSD on the
backend. Samba can replace most of the point and click filesharing
capability that the end users are used to. There are enough point and
click/hope-for-the-best gui admin tools around these days, to shield M$
centric IT staff from the supposed difficulty of a text config file.
Although for the more adventurous will see that by going direct to the
config file it is often easier to see the big picture with finer grained
control. And all at the right price. However, I think that linux on the
desktop has a little way to go. Star Office is great, I use it with
success 90% of the time. But it would be that 10% where someone gets a
word document where the author has spend more time on presentation than on
the content, and Star Office screws the formatting completely, that the
helpdesk calls would become a nightmare. Most people can get around Office
ok (or at least they like to think so ;-), but there would certainly be an
ugly transition period from a training point of view.
