 &gt; Kudos to Intel for their clock throttling capability. However, If one reads
 &gt; the fine print, "AMD did not bless the Thunderbird core with ANY thermal
 &gt; protection whatsoever. If the heat sink should come off, the owner is facing
 &gt; a significant financial loss.", one understands that the writer of the
 &gt; article is obviously talking about the possible loss of data and not the
 &gt; hardware that got cooked

That's not correct.  The article clearly illustrates the risk of destruction
of the motherboard, and the risk of the motherboard actually catching fire.

We're talking about temperatures in excess of 300 degrees here!

 &gt; being that AMD is so much less expensive  @$170(US)
 &gt; than Intel @$550(US). I'd like to know the MTBF of  "socket A notches" never
 &gt; having seen one fail, personally. And who, other than Tom's,
 &gt; removes/replaces heat sinks on a running system?  8 ) Really!

It isn't just an issue of the fan/heatsink falling off;  A fan failure 
will lead to a similar (although less spectacular) result.

Additionally, the article also points out the issue of people who buy
shrink-wrapped PC systems where the fans/heatsinks are dislodged at
the time of delivery, either because of rough handling during transport
or because they weren't properly attached in the first place.  Having 
taken deliver of systems in that state at work in the past, I can definitely
attest to the veracity of those claims.

 &gt;  Having both Intel and AMD systems,  I enjoy the performance of the AMD
 &gt; enough to recommend touching it with a barge pole. In fact, a twig. Do know
 &gt; the idiosyncrasies of both platforms before your purchase and its targeted
 &gt; use.

&lt;shrug&gt;  AMD might be faster than Intel for equivalent money;  Indeed, 
for the number of dollars I spend on an Intel CPU, I'm sure I could find
an AMD based system which would set fire to my server room *much* quicker!
