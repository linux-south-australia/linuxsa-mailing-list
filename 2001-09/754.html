I agree.

&gt; (of course I am talking server OS here, not desktop, tho I believe Linux is 
&gt; getting extremely close to the point of offering itself as an option on the 
&gt; corporate desktop with no reduced functionality to the average user)

There are also many instances where a thin client (linux or not) or even
something like a WYSE terminal are suitable for the purpose of an
information terminal. I have seen instances where a 'fat' Windows PC is
used with Terminal Emulation software as the alternative.

Some kind of small and quiet box with a browser (Mozilla) and perhaps a
terminal or X server would be more than suitable for some areas.

One of the real barriers (perhaps just an attitude issue) that impacts on
the Linux desktop taking hold is the Word and Excel document formats.
