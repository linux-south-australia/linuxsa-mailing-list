AFS is a file sharing system kinda like NFS (but really more like Coda
and Intermezzo). It was developed by a university and IBM got hold of it
somehow. Now IBM has released the source code for all the
clients/servers/etc which makes this very interesting. It support the
normal features such as disconnection mode, caching reads, on mount
point (all the same as Coda). It also suppose to have stable WinNT and
Win98 clients and be used in lots of places. The source has been ported
to Linux by IBM/Others .

&gt; Hi Tim,
&gt; 
&gt; I went on an AFS scholarship to South America in '89, but that was
&gt; before Linux.
&gt; I had a great time, but I dont think it has anything to do with the AFS
&gt; you are talking about :o)
&gt; 
&gt; What is AFS ? Any idea what it stands for ? Would you mind informing the
&gt; ignorant people like myself :o)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Ben.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone had an experiences with AFS and Linux (Or just AFS
&gt; &gt; experience)? AFS looks very interesting and i have been reading up the
&gt; &gt; documentation. It seems similar to Coda and Intermezzo..
