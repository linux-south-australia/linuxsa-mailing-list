&gt; This isn't unfair, it's Richard's code after all.

&gt; Releasing code under the GPL is essentially gifting
&gt; it to the world.  For some applications it can be hard
&gt; to make a living that way.

You can release code you own under multiple licenses, including the
GPL. If someone wishes to do commercial things with it, they can pay you
to release it under a specific "whatever purpose you want" license.

The only trick is to make sure that any contributions to the GPL version
assign copyright to you, the original owner.

Look at reiserfs (www.namesys.com) as one of many examples, and probably
the best-explained. <A HREF="http://www.namesys.com/legalese.html">http://www.namesys.com/legalese.html</A> starts off:

 By contributing your code to this CVS repository, or by attaching the
 Legal Agreement language to an email to <A HREF="mailto:reiser@idiom.com">reiser@idiom.com</A> containing your
 code, you are engaging in a legal agreement regarding the use of that
 code. We need this. So that we can afford paid staff, we license our file
 system to persons who have lawyers and we grant licenses that are not
 solely GPL licenses. (This is where the larger part of our money comes
 from, taxing money from those who can't convince their investors they
 should share their code with us. It literally makes the lawyers ask "And
 people pay you money for this?")
