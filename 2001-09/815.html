[General stuff about what MS can do with their sw deleted]


&gt; However, no matter what, the thing I would do most of all is branding. MS have an
&gt; unbeleivably strong brand name, and I would do all I could to protect that. It's one thing
&gt; that people in all areas will buy based on (consumers, SMEs, Big Business etc), and it's
&gt; (IMHO) one of the rare things in IT that has a sustainable value. Everything else can be
&gt; changed by a movement in technology, or a bigger fish buying your market or whatever.
&gt; Strong Branding is almost unassailable, _and_ it wins court cases. This is not just the
&gt; Microsoft name, but each product name, and any visible point of difference -- they have to
&gt; make it (c), and convince the market that it means "quality" or "cool" or "innovative" or
&gt; whatever.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think that branding is not important for commercial success, take a look at real
&gt; commodities -- things like milk, sugar, flour, petrol, even PCs... The success of Farmers'
&gt; Union, CSR, &lt;a flour brand&gt;, BP, Dell and so on, are all built on Brands and pretty much
&gt; nothing else. Yeah, quality comes into it, but it's only worth getting a reputation for
&gt; quality if you have a brand to attach that reputation to...
