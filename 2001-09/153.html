My friend has just had his system Code Red'd and it is causing great 
grief to him. I think you may be interested in the means of attack. 
This one is very different to the normal email borne attack. There 
wasn't a logged in connection to the Internet. There wasn't any email 
to run. There wasn't any operator error to run any program.

* He was connected to Telstra cable through his cable box BUT he was 
installing Windows 2000 Server on the machine. The drive he was 
installing on was completely blank. It had just been low-level 
formatted via SCSI card. This happened at 3:30 AM GMT on Monday 3 
September. 
* He was NOT logged onto the cable service. 
* He had especially selected IIS to NOT be installed.
* Left machine running to complete installations and only had the Admin 
password entered.
* Came back to machine several hours later and noticed that cable modem 
was going mental.
* Tried logging into his 2000 Server but was refused 3 times, "Machine 
in use by other user. Only Administrator and user have access (VPN)"
* Turned machine off. Then on. Logged in straight away. 
* Loaded up their proprietary login software. Could not log into ISP. 
Contacted ISP who suggested it may a virus problem but they insisted 
that he must have been running other software, could not have come 
through them. 
* After installing NAV 2001 he did a Live Update. Then he restarted his 
machine and did a scan which detected Trojan Virtual Root = Code Red II.

So far it has caused over 1.5 G of outgoing traffic through his cable 
account but no emails were installed so it has not gone to any of his 
contacts AFAIK. It has caused failures in mother boards and hard drives 
and he is now trying hard to recover urgently needed software without 
passing on the trojan. 

He will be low-level formatting all drives then installing Linux and 
swears to never again use MS products unless required for his work with 
clients. 

If we can be hit by these mongrels during an install of MS Software 
what hope do we have that we will be safe from any kind of viral attack.

Oh, and I can verify that all the above events happened in the sequence 
as described.

 Ian
