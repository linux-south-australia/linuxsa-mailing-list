 &gt; I know about the ide-cf adapters that you can get, and I know that 
 &gt; Linux will see it as an IDE device - but can Linux read the storage 
 &gt; format that digital cameras use?? Can't find any info in the 
 &gt; archives regarding this, and google hasn't been a lot of help to 
 &gt; date, so I'm interested in any *firsthand* experiences that LinuxSA 
 &gt; folks might have had doing this. Has anyone tried the Sandisk USB
 &gt; card readers under Linux? Their web page says that they're supported,
 &gt; but I don't know anyone who's tried one...

The "storage format" is invariably a DOS filesystem full of JPEG files.
So if you can read the physical media you should have no problems
retrieving the images.

For what it's worth, I use a Sandisk USB CF reader to get images from
my Kodak DC215 camera under FreeBSD;  Works fine.  There are a handful
of protocols over the USB bus which almost all of the CF readers adhere
to (SCSI, IDE, UFI tunnelled over CBI, CBI/CCC and BBB), so you don't
need a specially-tuned driver for each USB reader device;  a generic 
driver is usually fine.

One notable exception to that is the early models of the Sandisk readers,
which used a proprietry protocol licensed from a company which has 
since gone out of business (so there'll probably never be any programmers
documentation to describe the protocol, so the device will probably
never work with any of the free OS's).  Mine's a Sandisk ImageMate II,
the old ImageMate I's won't actually work.
