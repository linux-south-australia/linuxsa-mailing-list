As an I.T. networking student i have experienced many of the pitfalls and 
problems associated with M$, it's operating and IIS which has more holes than 
sieve. I have only recently begun using Linux and i think that it is a far 
greater system than windows. I only hope that the government and EDS look 
further into the benefits of using it. A letter similar to the one being sent 
to the NZ government, while not guaranteed to work, could provoke someone to 
llok into using Linux on governemnt systems and i would happily co-sign a 
letter when it is produced
