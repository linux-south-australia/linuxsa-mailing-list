Hi Bradley,

Thanks for your help the other night. No matter what we tried we could 
not get the 6.2 CDs to install. Some files missing somewhere on both 
John's copy and our copy.

So I tried Manduck 8.0 because I thought it would have everything that 
was needed. It worked except the video card [Cirrus Logic GD 5446] cant 
get addressed properly and even though I have tried to do some insmod 
with the recommended additions I still have a crappy screen. Black 
spaces all over the place, and that is at 640 and 8 bits &lt;sigh&gt;

Tonight I have tried 8.1 (beta) Mandrake and it is still giving me the 
same grief with the video. That will be coming off very shortly.

I know that RH 7.1 has troubles with the same card as it is on the 
other machines that DHS have donated to our Project so have not 
bothered going down that path again. Maybe I might have to.

I am at a loss how to get the video working. I have been to the 
Mandrake site and other sites looking for info on the damn card. All I 
got were the two files to be insmodded. I have read the man for insmod, 
worked out how to install the files. They didn't work properly &lt;sigh&gt;

Help from anybody is desperately sought.

Ian

&gt; Hi Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering if everything is going OK with your build. Did 
&gt; those CD's
&gt; work OK?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Brad.
