I took Andrew's advice and upgraded to 7.1, and made some steps forward, but
still the same problem.

Once nice thing was that scanpci actually says it found an "S3 SavagePro
Km133", which is the proper spec for the card. On 6.2 it only found a
generic S3. So we are getting closer!

It turns out that the card was being detected by X all along - it find an S3
generic with 64k video ram or something pathetic...the problem is,
therefore, that I can't convince it to start with a proper screen
resolution. XF86Setup (which doesn't come on 7.1...grr) could start it up in
320x204, but when I use a config file made by Xconfigurator, X doesn't find
any valid modes at all.

So is my problem with the mode timings? Should I try to build some modelines
by hand (which I don't mind, if I am told how), or is it better to try and
get X to detect my card properly and automatically pick the right ones?

Cheers,

Tyson Lloyd Thwaites

&gt; &gt; It uses the VIA
&gt; &gt; KL133 chipset, and has integrated SavagePro vga. I am using
&gt; RH6.2. (I tried
&gt; &gt; RH7.1, but had no more luck, and I don't like it :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ah, but RH7.1 comes with XFree86 4.0.3, which is much nicer than the
&gt; 3.3.6 version that comes with RH6.2! :-) I'd strongly recommend the
&gt; upgrade to the newer version of XFree86, if you can cope with
&gt; RH7.1 Once
&gt; you start getting over the little differences from 6.2, it starts to
&gt; feel like home again :-) (But hey, stick with 6.2 if you're
&gt; happy with
&gt; it [clap your hands?])
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; A Linux X server (SVGA) actually comes on the CD (nice
&gt; surprise!), but it
&gt; &gt; seems to make no difference. Xconfigurator fails to detect
&gt; the card, but I
&gt; &gt; tell it to use to use the SVGA server, with 16Mb, etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Note that <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/current/Status28.html">http://www.xfree86.org/current/Status28.html</A>#28 lists the
&gt; current S3 chipsets that are supported, and the SavagePro isn't
&gt; specifically listed, but at a guess, in XFree86 3.3.6 you'd
&gt; want to try
&gt; the s3_savage driver (not really sure, never used one of those cards
&gt; before). Set that in the Device section of your XF86Config
&gt; file, and see
&gt; how it goes. I also generally find leaving the driver to
&gt; decide how much
&gt; RAM is on the video card works better.
&gt;
&gt; However, that said, if it's still not finding the video card, you can
&gt; try setting the BusID in the Device section to tell X where the card
&gt; "is". For example, when I do 'scanpci' I get the following (snipped):
&gt;
&gt; pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x08 function 0x0000: vendor 0x121a device 0x0005
&gt;   3Dfx Interactive Voodoo3
&gt;
&gt; pci bus 0x1 cardnum 0x00 function 0x0000: vendor 0x10de device 0x0028
&gt;   NVidia Riva TNT2
&gt;
&gt; As a result, I have the following in XF86Config:
&gt;
&gt; Section "Device"
&gt;      Identifier  "TNT2"
&gt;      Driver      "nv"
&gt;      BusID       "PCI:1:0:0"
&gt; EndSection
&gt;
&gt; Section "Device"
&gt;      Identifier  "Voodoo3"
&gt;      Driver      "tdfx"
&gt;      BusID       "PCI:0:8:0"
&gt; EndSection
&gt;
&gt; That way, X finds that Voodoo3 card when it normally only
&gt; finds my TNT2
&gt; card. YMMV.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I would love to get this working. I would be happy to just
&gt; use the virge,
&gt; &gt; though X is a *tiny bit 'fuzzy' (or is that just X?).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I've had a similar problem with two different video cards in the past
&gt; that were "fuzzy," and the way that I solved the problem was
&gt; to remove
&gt; all the ModeLine settings from the Monitor section(s) of your
&gt; XF86Config
&gt; file, and let X sort it all out by probing the video card (Make sure
&gt; your monitor H & V rate settings are right, of course!). I've
&gt; also found
&gt; that having the DPMS turned on (if your card/monitor support it) also
&gt; helps. Add the line
&gt;
&gt;    Options "dpms"
&gt;
&gt; to your Monitor section. Beats me why that should make a
&gt; difference, but
&gt; it did. *shrug*
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Any experience or advice would be *greatly appreciated!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well, there's my experiences. Hope it's of use :-)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
