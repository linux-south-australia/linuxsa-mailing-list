&gt;&gt; Sure, but I don't understand why this is an improvement over how
&gt;&gt; apt-get works since the Packages file also contains md5sums for the

&gt;&gt; worry about having build dependencies installed)?
&gt;
&gt; I suppose the packages file is re-downloaded every time... so
&gt; there's only one place you need to crack... (correct?)

No.  You only download once.

There are a number of issues here, but basically the tarballs get
downloaded from the main distribution site, and the MD5 checksums get
downloaded from the FreeBSD repository.  To break something, you have
to access both places.

&gt; Also, are you saying that ports doesn't do dependencies?

I don't think he is.  If he is, he's wrong.

As Chris knows, I find apt-get unnecessarily fiddly.  I'm sure that it
does a good job, but it's too fine-grained for my liking.  It also
shows you all the dependencies and potential conflicts, and expects
you to do something about it.  The Ports Collection (called Packages
Collection in NetBSD) does it all for you.  There also seem to be far
fewer conflicts in FreeBSD, which makes the job easier.

Anyway, I've had quite a few replies, so I'll plan to do this some
time.  Due to my schedule, it may not be on the normal meeting date,
but I'll try to do it soon.
