If you have a firewire setup, then dvgrab and associated utils work
brilliantly!

In the past i tried using streamer (might have been part of xawtv, i
think?), but the performance was generally pretty average. I don't know if
the BT848 cards have ever offered that good capture performance thou - i
think they were designed to do video overlay, and the capturing was more of
a hack or secondary feature, rather than the main focus.

With firewire and dvgrab you get 720x480 video at 25fps and a very high
bitrate, without any problems.. with bt848 and streamer i could never manage
full framerate at any except tiny res, and 352x288 (hi) res was unuseably
slow. This was on older hardware though, so discount my advice as neccessary
;)

firewire isn't lossy, whereas bt848 capture and playback is. But firewire
VCRs and camcorders cost more than standard ones.

&gt; I'm having trouble finding a decent Linux app that will let me record
&gt; video from my BT848 TV card. I have some home video that I would like
&gt; to turn into either an AVI or MPG video so that I can email it to my
&gt; relatives.
&gt;
&gt; I've tried bcast, vcr, and xawtv, but they don't work too well. Any
&gt; recommendations from anyone on what works well under Linux? I'd like
&gt; to record sound as well if possible. I'm using a Mandrake 8 system
&gt; if that helps.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
