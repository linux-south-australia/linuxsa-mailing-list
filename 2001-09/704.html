&gt; You took my advice? Now you're in trouble :-)
"I was afraid you'd say that..." Empire Strikes Back

&gt; Hmmmm. I have had a thought - this is an on-mother board video card,
&gt; right? Do you have to allocate the RAM for the video in the BIOS? ie.
&gt; The video card uses RAM borrowed from your "system" RAM.
That's correct. It currently has 16Mb allocated.

&gt; If that's the
&gt; case, you may well end up having to tell X how much RAM you
&gt; have, rather
&gt; than trying to let it find out for itself. Dunno, never set up on
&gt; on-board video card for X before.....
For some reason, I opted for integrated in the belief that it would be
'easier'...don't know WHAT I was thinking!! :~

&gt; That's my preference.
Mine also: I'll do anything to beat this. I have another card I could use,
but I want to use my nice new board and pretend I didn't buy one that won't
work!

&gt; Have you tried the BusID option? I'd
&gt; try that with
&gt; telling the Device section how much RAM is allocated to the video....
Yes, I did (but it wouldn't work until I upgraded to 7.1.) I think I did try
specifying ram in Xconfigurator, but it didn't believe me and wouldn't run
the server. From now on I will edit by hand! Damn gui junk...:)

At least X can find the card, but as you say, the next step is to force it
to believe certain things about the card, ie BusID, Ram, etc. Will
XF86Config options override detected parameters? I suppose they would.

I get the feeling that I'm only a step away, but I'm just not doing
everything right. Maybe I will have a go tonight (it's at home) and then
will post the config file and server output if that is necessary.

Thanks for yer 'elp,

TLT
