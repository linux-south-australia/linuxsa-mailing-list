Some time ago I had a problem with Mandrake 7.0 and later 8.0 not being able 
to configure a Diamond Stealth card. This happened several times right at the 
end of an install. I was forced to locate and install some files in /etc/X11  
and do some hacking on the XF86Config file. You take a punt in doing this as 
you may stuff up a monitor. My hack worked ok and continues to do its job. 
Using a working XF86Config file may be a good place to start.  
or
Can you get another inexpensive card to get your PC at least operational ?

&gt; Hi Bradley,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your help the other night. No matter what we tried we could
&gt; not get the 6.2 CDs to install. Some files missing somewhere on both
&gt; John's copy and our copy.
&gt;
&gt; So I tried Manduck 8.0 because I thought it would have everything that
&gt; was needed. It worked except the video card [Cirrus Logic GD 5446] cant
&gt; get addressed properly and even though I have tried to do some insmod
&gt; with the recommended additions I still have a crappy screen. Black
&gt; spaces all over the place, and that is at 640 and 8 bits &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Tonight I have tried 8.1 (beta) Mandrake and it is still giving me the
&gt; same grief with the video. That will be coming off very shortly.
&gt;
&gt; I know that RH 7.1 has troubles with the same card as it is on the
&gt; other machines that DHS have donated to our Project so have not
&gt; bothered going down that path again. Maybe I might have to.
&gt;
&gt; I am at a loss how to get the video working. I have been to the
&gt; Mandrake site and other sites looking for info on the damn card. All I
&gt; got were the two files to be insmodded. I have read the man for insmod,
&gt; worked out how to install the files. They didn't work properly &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Help from anybody is desperately sought.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi Ian,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if everything is going OK with your build. Did
&gt; &gt; those CD's
&gt; &gt; work OK?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Brad.
