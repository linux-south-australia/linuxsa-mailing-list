&gt; My thoughts include using LDAP.  I know it works for *nix clients and mac
&gt; clients and even Win98 clients

Whilst it's possible to get an LDAP client or server for each of those
clients, they don't necessarily support the handing over of all
security to an LDAP server. They also use different encryption algorithms
for storing passwords.

Welcome to incompatible^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hheterogeneous networking.

&gt; - it's just this blasted Win2k stuff that
&gt; doesn't seem to work the way it's meant to *sigh*.

:-)

&gt; The servers can't even
&gt; use alias names in clusters and had to replace the file sharing part of
&gt; our Win2K network with a samba server *sigh*.

Is that a bad thing? Microsoft themselves admit that it's best to run one
service per server, to avoid stability problems. It may not be a bad thing
to let your Win2K boxen do the Windows specific stuff and let your unix
box do the rest.

One thing I forgot to mention in my previous e-mail:

 If you are planning on using Samba as a PDC for Win2K clients, it is best
to use Samba 2.2.1a (or soon-to-be, Samba 2.2.2). Win2K SP2 added a nice
little "feature" that caused a large compatibility problem (ie, it stopped
working completely). These late versions of Samba overcame this.

thx,
Matt
