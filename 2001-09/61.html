Hi all,

A couple of days ago we had a power failure in Whyalla for about an hour and
a half, I run 5 webservers in Whyalla, now most of them are fine, except 1.
This one machine on bootup had problems with the filesystem on /dev/hda8 and
threw me back to a #bash prompt and told me to run that e2fsck thing. so I
did, and it came up with a whole heap of inodes and stuff that were missing
or corrupt or something, I proceeded to delete them, and e2fsck went on its
merry way.... I rebooted the system and everything apparently came up fine,
however I am having 1 problem now. Whenever I check my email, and outlook
express says that it is receiving message X of Y sometimes, only sometimes,
it will just sit there and do nothing, and not download the messages. If I
do a netstat on the linux box it appears that the connection is still
established and takes a long time to time out. This also happens when I ssh
into the box, sometimes my SSH session will just 'freeze', all I can do is
initiate another SSH session. Does anyone have any idea what this is or how
I can fix it?? everything else on this box seems to be working fine.

Regards,

Michael
