I won't be at the meeting, however I was wondering if anyone has used Coda
in a serious environment yet..
I considered it some time ago, but CMU's webpage was a bit disconcerting.
It sounded like it was still rather developmental, unstable and so on..
For something that's been in development for 14 years, this was a bit of a
worry!

The question is, has anyone around here actually setup a moderately loaded
fileserver with quite a few simultaneous clients, and used the system for a
decent period?

How did it go?

Thanks,

Toby

&gt; since 1987 by the systems group of M. Satyanarayanan. in the SCS
&gt; department...." [CMU = Carnegie Mellon University, USA].
