The following was posted recently to the Arachne (graphical
browser/emailer for DOS) mailing list, to demonstrate that an
ostensible Windows-only modem can be used in other OSs. This example
may only be a fluke, but it raises some interesting possibilities...

See <A HREF="http://arachne.cz">http://arachne.cz</A> for more details on Arachne itself.

&gt; This message is sent to you from my Toshiba Satellite Pro
&gt; 400CDT 75 Mhz Pentium Laptop over an internet connection
&gt; established by a Nokia cell phone model 7160.  I'm running
&gt; Arachne version 1.70, rev. 3 in native DOS mode.

[Discussion of Arachne dialup configuration omitted. Basically he used
the same settings as his external modem... 38400,8,N,1. It would seem 
this Toshiba's IR port operates as a generic "COM1" unless
reprogrammed by software?]

&gt; The owner's manual for my cell phone makes no mention of the
&gt; fact that it is perfectly compatible with DOS.  It explains in
&gt; great detail how to connect under Windows 95, 98, Windows 2000
&gt; Professional and NT 4.0 Workstation.  It says you have to install
&gt; special Nokia drivers.
&gt;
&gt; It works just wonderfully well under DOS, and without even
&gt; requiring the installation of any drivers.  I wonder why the
&gt; owners' manual fails to make any mention of such an outstanding
&gt; connectivity feature.
&gt;
&gt; Any manufacturer producing any ultra modern peripheral that
&gt; maintains backwards compatibility ought to brag about such a
&gt; wonderful feature.

And perhaps, to also brag that it isn't really a Winmodem either?

I don't have an IR-capable mobile phone (or computer) to follow up on
this discovery. Obvious lines of investigation include tests with
other mobile phone models (and laptop models) to see if they work with
Linux. Maybe Nokia have anticipated a market containing lots of
non-Windows customers??



cheers,
Fraser Farrell
