&gt; (not my opinion, but one which I get from most joe average users)

I do agree with this statement to a certain extent.
Most non-technical (and even some technical) users see their computer as 
simply a tool for getting their job done. They don't want a religious  
discussion as to why they should use free software, even if it is technically 
better. They would rather not change unless it makes their job easier.

The decision makers choose Microsoft products because it's a no-brainer (to 
them at least). There used to be the saying "Nobody ever got fired for buying 
IBM", well now it's Microsoft. Microsoft has invested heavily in marketing 
it's "brand" to the decision makers to the point that it's hard for them to 
see the alternatives. It's even harder for them to see free software as an 
alternative.

Despite this, Linux is growing in popularity, and some of the big companies 
are seriously investing in it. I've noticed that Microsoft has gone from 
dismissing Linux out of hand to the point now where it has marketing material 
aimed squarely at Linux. They now regard Linux as a competitor, but I think 
they're not quite there yet *grin*  

I try to keep my peers and managers up to date with Linux-related topics, and 
I try not to attack Microsoft in the process, since some people get defensive 
if I do (its so hard though, especially with debacles like NIMDA, etc)

Regards,
Rob.
