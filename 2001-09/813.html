&gt; Now I can't blame Microsoft for protecting their arse and their employees
&gt; continued employment. Perhaps this issue has been discussed before, but what
&gt; would you do in their circumstance? Keep protecting your assets through FUD,
&gt; or admit that really producing and selling software especially general OS,
&gt; office suites, web browsers, and other commodity-level software are almost
&gt; financially worthless when faced with a competing force of GPL hackers?

I would try to move very rapidly to a subscription-based model of selling these general
commodity software products, and turn them into a service. I'd scale back on investment in
their development somewhat (they are pretty much fully-developed anyway) and ficus on
high-end, high margin software. Places where you can really get a technical advantage on
the opposition if you try...

However, no matter what, the thing I would do most of all is branding. MS have an
unbeleivably strong brand name, and I would do all I could to protect that. It's one thing
that people in all areas will buy based on (consumers, SMEs, Big Business etc), and it's
(IMHO) one of the rare things in IT that has a sustainable value. Everything else can be
changed by a movement in technology, or a bigger fish buying your market or whatever.
Strong Branding is almost unassailable, _and_ it wins court cases. This is not just the
Microsoft name, but each product name, and any visible point of difference -- they have to
make it (c), and convince the market that it means "quality" or "cool" or "innovative" or
whatever.

If you think that branding is not important for commercial success, take a look at real
commodities -- things like milk, sugar, flour, petrol, even PCs... The success of Farmers'
Union, CSR, &lt;a flour brand&gt;, BP, Dell and so on, are all built on Brands and pretty much
nothing else. Yeah, quality comes into it, but it's only worth getting a reputation for
quality if you have a brand to attach that reputation to...

Hmm... OT :)
