Check out gPhoto's website, they'll have lists of cameras they support.

There's also another program that worked will all the cameras that used a
particular O/S.. *mental blank* But lots of cameras used it, so it was good.
Look on freshmeat or google or something.. easy to find the info about
support.

Then, just take those lists into somewhere lame but with a big selection,
and see whats available. Work out which one you prefer, then ring around
smaller, cheaper, places and find a good price.

For 640x480 only cameras, expect to pay sub $250. They suck, no one wants
them. Try to get at least 1024x768 (0.75 MP), although personally i'd try
and double that, and get a 1.5 MP camera.

Also, keep an eye on the lens quality and JPEG routine they use..
For instance, some of the older Minolta cameras had really bad barrel
distortion from the lens.
On the other hand, old Kodak's had rather broken JPEG routines.

check out some camera sites for reviews. dpreview.com comes to mind, if it
still exists that is.

If you get "normal" battery cameras, they can go thru batteries at an insane
rate. As an example - my old digital camera used 4 rechargeable AA batteries
at a time, and would go flat in a matter minutes of continous screen-on.
By comparison, my sony digital camcorder, which has a bigger screen, and
turns a video tape (which presumably uses more power than accessing a flash
memory card), can last for literally hours on a single battery charge. (it
is lithium, whereas the aa batteries were Nickel-metal-hydride)

&gt; Any recommendations for a digital camera that:
&gt;
&gt;  - works with Linux,
&gt;
&gt;  - is available in Adelaide (or Australia at least),
&gt;
&gt;  - doesn't cost more than my car,
&gt;
&gt;  - doesn't have any proprietary gotchas such as unique memory
&gt; packs or weird batteries.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I may be reading the wrong webpages for these cameras, but none of
&gt; them mention Linux. Something that can do 10-15 shots at 640x480 64k
&gt; colours would be adequate.
&gt;
&gt;
