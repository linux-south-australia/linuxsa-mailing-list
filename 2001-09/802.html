&gt;device          ie0     at isa? port 0x300 irq 10 iomem 0xd0000

&gt;The current kernel lists the ie0 driver as above.  It may be that 
&gt;the card is either not in PnP mode or your machines does not 
&gt;support/like it in PnP mode.  If you can run a DOS based config 
&gt;program on the card, try and change it to IRQ 10, IO 0x300.

There are jumpers on the card to set it to specific settings or to 
leave it as PNP.  I have tried those settings you have listed above 
to no avail.

A suggestion was made yesterday to check that there was no ROM 
shadowing hapening which might be blocking the card.  There is some 
shadowing to do with the video (that won't let me disable it) and 
that is all.  I guess it is just a hardware compatability problem.
I think I might install Win95 on the machine and check if I can get 
the card working under that, and if successful, retry the FreeBSD 
install.

Another alternative is if anyone has a suitable card that they know 
works under FreeBSD (ie. have installed it and configured it 
themselves previously) that they also would consider selling...let me 
know.

&gt;Shouldn't it be /dev/fd0c when mounting it?

Why is that?

Cheers,
Shane.

PS.  Thanks to all those who have replied.  If nothing else is 
achieved, I am learning.



Cheers,
Shane.
