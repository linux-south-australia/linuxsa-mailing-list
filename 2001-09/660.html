We have a corporate disclaimer but we set it up individually on each users
email client ( MS Outlook / Outlook Express )as well as there name and phone
number. It can be time consuming though and not foolproof.

As to point 1) We currently use MIMEDefang for quarantining all incoming and
outgoing emails for various attachments which are then stripped out (
currently strips out all .exe, .dll, .shs, .mpg, .avi, .wav , .lnk etc
etc ). Whilst this does limit the amount of crap the people send to our
employees and certainly limits the work that our Antivirus programs have to
do, I can see there being a potential problem if we start encrypting.

Before I get flamed I know that the ripping apart / stripping of emails is
not considered etiquette, but It has saved us from lots of potential viral
attacks in the last few years

&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm looking for a way in the near future to add a
&gt; disclaimer to all my
&gt; &gt; companies emails... What application package under linux do

&gt; The very best way is to add it to everone's .signature
&gt; file.
&gt;
&gt; This is for three reasons:
&gt;
&gt;  1) Altering an e-mail in-flight breaks any cryptographic
&gt;     signatures such as S/MIME.  Altering all outgoing
&gt;     mail effectively prevents your users from sending
&gt;     encrypted mail.
&gt;
&gt;  2) Disclaimers are not always appropiate.
&gt;
&gt;  3) Not only people use e-mail.
&gt;
&gt; I'd strongly suggest that you allow your users to send
&gt; encrypted mail.  You'll find it very useful for meeting
&gt; the upcoming privacy requirements.
&gt;
&gt; As an example of (2) we still receive tender responses where the
&gt; sender disclaims them as being official correspondence of the
&gt; organisation.  We legally have to discard those.
&gt;
&gt; You can certainly add text to the bottom of an e-mail
&gt; using sendmail.  See the content management API called
&gt; libmilter.
&gt;
&gt; You also might find that your e-mail virus scanning software
&gt; can do the job.  For example, the VirusWall from Trend
&gt; Micro will add a "scanned OK" message if you want, and
&gt; this can be altered to a corporate disclaimer.
&gt;
&gt; You won't find much help for adding disclaimers, as most
&gt; technical people see the breakage of signatures as
&gt; presenting more risk to the corporation than adding
&gt; a disclaimer ameliorates risk.  If your legal people are
&gt; advising you to add disclaimers then you should ensure
&gt; that they are aware of the disclaimer/signature trade off
&gt; so that they can correctly weigh the legal risks.
&gt;
