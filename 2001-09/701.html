You took my advice? Now you're in trouble :-)


&gt; It turns out that the card was being detected by X all along - it find an S3
&gt; generic with 64k video ram or something pathetic...the problem is,
&gt; therefore, that I can't convince it to start with a proper screen
&gt; resolution.


Hmmmm. I have had a thought - this is an on-mother board video card, 
right? Do you have to allocate the RAM for the video in the BIOS? ie. 
The video card uses RAM borrowed from your "system" RAM. If that's the 
case, you may well end up having to tell X how much RAM you have, rather 
than trying to let it find out for itself. Dunno, never set up on 
on-board video card for X before.....

&gt; or is it better to try and
&gt; get X to detect my card properly and automatically pick the right ones?


That's my preference. Have you tried the BusID option? I'd try that with 
telling the Device section how much RAM is allocated to the video....

Cheers,
