I am totally familiar with these too. That was my point about 4 commands:
ie:  groupadd + useradd [big parameter list] + chfn + passwd

I fully accept the points about it's confusing name, but can't say that I got
confused too often myself. My trick for remembering it was that the manual
commands had "add" at the end of their name and the shell script started
with "add". Flimsy, I admit, but it worked for me. ;-)

What really confused me was when they put a binary there, also called 
"adduser",
which was actually just like useradd. When I wrote my own script it had to be
named "addnewuser". I don't use it very often, but when I do I appreciate 
not having
to cut+paste the username half a dozen times.

Anyway, it's nothing more than pet-peeve of mine really. I'm actually glad 
that no-one
is flaming me for my feelings against linuxconf ;-)

Cheers,
-Daniel
