&gt; Err, we have, but has the rest of the MS Office world.
&gt; Nothing exists outside of MS Office surely??? ;o)

&gt; People don't like moving outside the world theyre in, thats called

I have just received a 2.7MB (MB)MS Word document attachment from IBM for
a single page invitation to a seminar. I mention this for several reasons:

* I am most likely on an IBM contact list because of my queries regarding
IBM and linux. Being a Linux user I might not have access to Word or a
Word reader.

* Star Office 5.2 did not display it correctly and also crashed. So much
for keeping up with the Word format. I originally thought Star Office 5.2
did a reasonably good job as far as the Word format is concerend. On the
other hand, Word might have crashed as well.

* It outlines that a bad choice was used without question when users use
what they are given without thought, even if just the bandwidth issues are
questioned. Even HTML would have been better. I pray that DSL was not a
recipient.
