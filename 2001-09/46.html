Hi Ian,

Sorry I did not get back to you earlier. I don't really get to use my email
on Sunday.

Anyhow, just as a tip, get SAMBA working on the box. This would be good so
you can demonstrate that they could use the Linux box in the Windoze
network. They probably have a NT Domain. Samba can work beautifully on an NT
domain, I use it at home. Make sure that you have both the server and client
working so that the people can map to the workstation and map from the
workstation. 

As with the GHOST image, let me know what happens. Unless the boxes are all
the same I am wondering if you are going to have a problem. Never tried it.

Another thing is maybe stop a few useless services. Might make the box run a
little faster.

Good Luck,
Brad.

Hi Bradley,

We finally got RH 7.1 to install and my son was able to change the card 
details so that a correct driver was loaded. It is now running a 
crystal clear 1024 screen where before we could not even get a blotchy 
640 to work.

Now I have to load up StarOffice then see what parts I can shave off 
the install and do a recompile or perhaps just Ghost it so that I can 
build an image for later use. That is our ultimate goal, to come up 
with a working model that we can use for our other machines, and that 
DHS can use for theirs.

Any suggestions welcome.

Cheers, Ian
