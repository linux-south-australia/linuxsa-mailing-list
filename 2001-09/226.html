Hi Andy,

this is a case where you really want to start using iptables.

ipchains was good for some of what it did, but unfortunately things like
masquerading didn't fit terribly well into the scheme of things, and port
forwarding with ipchains was just a total kludge!

It is possible to do port forwarding with ipchains, but there are various
catches and oddities about it.

Doing the same with iptables is much simpler and makes more sense. In fact,
the whole system makes more sense once you know it.

You will need to be using a 2.4.x kernel to use iptables though.. If you're
running an old linux distribution then there are quite a few things to
upgrade before you can install it.

If you decide to go with iptables, and get stuck, email me and i'll post
some examples. However, I suspect you'll be able to figure it out yourself,
since the man page is pretty clear.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I've got a computer with a real static IP address, which hosts a few
&gt; services, including a HTTP server. I have another computer in a private
&gt; network connected to the computer with the real IP address and I'd like it
&gt; to be a second HTTP server.
&gt;
&gt; I've been searching google for things like "ipchains port forward" and
&gt; "ipchains redirect" (without the quotes), but all I've found is how to
&gt; redirect to the same computer but a different port. Is there a way to
&gt; redirect to a different port on a different computer or at least just a
&gt; different computer?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy
