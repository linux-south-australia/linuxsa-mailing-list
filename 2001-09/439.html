Mick!

&gt; 1)
&gt; In Redhat 6.0, is there any way I can validate people username's and
&gt; passwords? Like a NT Domain Logon? My Client Machines are all Win 98 SE

Might I say that this wording is particularly awful. I think you are
really saying:

"I have a RedHat 6.0 machine that I want to act as a server. It is a
file server and possibly a print server as well. How can I share my
files and printers to my RedHat 6.0 machine?"

That answer to that question is:

1) use Samba
2) read the Samba documentation

I'm not certain about NT Domain Logons - someone else will have to
comment on them - however you can selectively allow certain users or
groups of users access to different directories with a Linux box running
Samba.

(in the documentation, look up things like "authentication" and
"security")

If I've misinterpreted your question you'll need to restate it more
clearly ;-P

&gt; 2) When someone logs onto my server using their username and password, can
&gt; the server map certain network drives for specific users?

&gt; Mick Logs On , I get All Privilages

Privileges. I continuously bugger its spelling up especially when trying
to "flush privileges" on MySQL databases :-(

&gt; Sid Logs On, Has Home Dir Privilages
&gt; and so on

The server is able to. In the documentation look for "netlogon" or
"netlogon scripts". Essentially, a netlogon script is a batch file that
is run under command.com or cmd.exe where you can put things like:

net use h: \\linux\someshare

And so forth.

Using Samba macros and such you can have different ones for different
users. At one of my work places I've created a dynamic netlogon script
that builds an appropriate one for various different types of users
based on group membership.
