&gt; This one is very different to the normal email borne attack. 

Wait right there. Code Red is NOT an email borne virus/worm, it's a web
based worm.

&gt; * He was connected to Telstra cable through his cable box BUT he was 
&gt; installing Windows 2000 Server on the machine. The drive he was 
&gt; installing on was completely blank. It had just been low-level 
&gt; formatted via SCSI card. This happened at 3:30 AM GMT on Monday 3 
&gt; September. 
&gt; * He was NOT logged onto the cable service. 

However, unless the cable modem was off, there is indeed a live
connection there I believe.

&gt; * He had especially selected IIS to NOT be installed.

What about Frontpage Express or the Web Publishing Wizard?

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; * After installing NAV 2001 he did a Live Update. Then he restarted
&gt; his 
&gt; machine and did a scan which detected Trojan Virtual Root = Code Red
&gt; II.

Interesting... Either the Telstra cable offering doesn't actually *need*
you to login, or there's a way to force the cable modem to issue a dhcp
address anyway...
 
&lt;snip&gt;

But really, the golden rule when building any box is to make sure it's
not physically connected to the internet until you've got it installed
and secured (if at all possible).
