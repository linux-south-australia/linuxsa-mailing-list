&gt;However, I don't hate Micro$oft products.  They annoy the hell out of me a
&gt;lot of the time, but that doesn't mean that a correctly configured
&gt;server/workstation is a complete waste of time.

I quite agree (well, the workstation part anyway).  ;-)
In fact, as much of a "give me shell over GUI" kinda guy I am, I sit
here at my Win98 PC quite happily working away. I have a dual-boot for
anything Linux specific I need to do (mostly just testing) but would have 
to admit
that it spends &gt; 95% of the time in windoze mode. The install is quite 
stable, as
I am rather picky about what software I load onto it, and I use Netscape/Eudora
instead of the dodgey M$ web/mail programs. I find this is the most efficient
workstation/PC setup for me.

On the hand, I have always avoided using M$ operating systems for servers 
(with the
obvious exception of internal LAN servers with Exchange......but I don't do 
that sort
of work very often). 99% of the servers I build or work on are Unix (mostly 
Linux)
because they are for internet services. Whenever I have been forced to support
an M$ internet server, it has been the biggest pain in the arse.

For me it is very simple, I use the most appropriate OS for the job:
Workstation             --&gt;     Windows
Internet Server         --&gt;     Linux
LAN Server              --&gt;     Either (more specific to the scenario)

The one thing about M$ that has always incensed me was their insistance that
they must be dominant in _every_ field of computer use (at the obvious 
detriment
to their product quality). They had no interest in the internet at first, 
and I think that
they should have kept it that way when it comes to server OSs.

Consider all the time and effort that goes into making substandard 
solutions such as IIS
and other Win2K internet services. If just half that time/effort/money went 
into actually fixing
all the bugs in their desktop OSs, they would have a killer product (and 
I'd be quite happy for
them too). But nooooo... they have to do _everything_ even if that means 
doing it all in a
very average way. &lt;/rant&gt;

I'm not stupid, I realise that the reason they don't is because they don't 
need to. They already
have the majority of the world inertly addicted to their desktop system, 
and bugs are the reason
you can sell the next version (because other than fixing bugs, it only adds 
a few more toys and
messes with the asthetics a bit......along with a whole new range of bugs ;-).
&lt;marxist hippy mode&gt; Aren't they obscenely wealthy enough already??? 
&lt;/marxist hippy mode&gt;

The whole thing bums me out when I think too much about it. I think I'll go 
back to laughing
at all the pointless NIMDA attempts on my Apache servers.  :-)

Cheers,
-Daniel
