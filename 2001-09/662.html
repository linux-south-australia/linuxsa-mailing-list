One of our managers had got information from some legal wankers that we
should put our disclaimer at the top of emails BEFORE the body, so that it
would be read.

I had to laugh as well as fight hard to prevent such idiotic concepts from
being forced upon us.

&gt;
&gt; If your management insists on doing such a silly thing, (presumably
&gt; from the same school of thought as 'we have to run Microsoft software
&gt; because it must be safer to be with the lemmings than to go against
&gt; the flow'), at least make sure the disclaimer is funny.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;    Simon.
