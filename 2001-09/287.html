what do you mean "works with linux"?
I've got an Agfa somethingorother, does 1152x968 (the one that's
one better than 1024x768?), it cost $330 from Hardly Normal
(in Sydney not here) and I got $30 back from Agfa (a cashback deal).  

It's got 1Mb internal memory and a USB connector.
But I don't use either, instead I got a 40Mb flash card and
pcmcia adaptor.  The flash card holds 232 images at the max
resolution and I take it out the camera and stick it into
the pcmcia converter and into my laptop to get the images
(it appears as a standard IDE disk with the vfat filesystem).

A CD of all M$ software came with the camera - I tried it once 
under win98 on the laptop and it hung the machine, never used it since.

Toby's right about batteries, this takes 2 AA's and chews through
them like there's no tomorrow (the camera has no screen too BTW,
so that probably improves battery life but is a bit of bummer but at 
the price not surprising - I bought it probably a year ago now).
I get probably about 30 pics (not using the flash) from new alkaline 
batteries (not rechargables).  And maybe 5-10 with flash.

Dave.
