&gt; There are a number of issues here, but basically the tarballs get
&gt; downloaded from the main distribution site, and the MD5 checksums get
&gt; downloaded from the FreeBSD repository.  To break something, you have
&gt; to access both places.

Ah, I see - so its a bit more secure. I get my updated packages files
direct from debian.org, and the actual packages from various mirrors.
So if a mirror got cracked I'd be ok, but if debian.org got broken
into, it would eventually propogate around.

&gt; As Chris knows, I find apt-get unnecessarily fiddly.  I'm sure that it
&gt; does a good job, but it's too fine-grained for my liking.  It also
&gt; shows you all the dependencies and potential conflicts, and expects
&gt; you to do something about it.  

dselect will do something similar for you but it hasn't got the most
intuitive of interfaces.

&gt; Anyway, I've had quite a few replies, so I'll plan to do this some
&gt; time.  Due to my schedule, it may not be on the normal meeting date,
&gt; but I'll try to do it soon.

Actually i'd be interested in finding out more about the package
format which is used (I don't know anything about it). A few people
have mentioned to me that its a better than rpm and that the LSB group
should be looking at it.
