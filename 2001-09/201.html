<H1>SuSE 7.2 LILO Problem</H1>

Hi All,
    I am evaluating SuSE 7.2 Pro for a possible install into
a Federal Government Department. The Problem I have is more
annoying than anything else, since everything is running
great, and the people I have to convince are bending over
backwards to convince Upper Management to say yes. It goes
like this.

    I did have SuSE 7.1 Pro an a Laptop that dual booted
Win98 SE, and Linux. After the install, I set LILO up in the
usual way, and set Win98 to default boot. I wrote the file
with a /sbin/lilo command and all was fine. I decided that I
would try a SuSE 7.2 boot from scratch and set the Laptop up
in the same way, but here is where I run into the problem.
7.2 has installed a slightly different boot sequence. It
loads up a pretty graphical version of something apparently
called gfxboot which is a menu of options, ie Linux, SuSE,
windows and memtest, and which is apparently a GUI front end
to LILO. When I do the normal changes to /etc/linux.conf to
get windoze to load first and write it to the MBR, it
appears to do this, but when I actually boot, it remains as
it was before. I have RTFM and no luck, it suggests doing
exactly what I usually do and have done. I have checked the
SuSE support base and no luck, it describes a problem that
is similar, but for the PPC version of 7.1. I have searched
the docs that come with 7.2 Pro and this is where they
mention gfxboot, but the only reference I can find about it
is a README file that tells me how to edit a config file,
but not what it is called, or where it is. I have also
searched the paper docs

    This is, as I said, more annoying than a real problem.
All I want to do is get the Laptop to default boot into
windoze like I have set up 2-3 hundred machines before. Any
help would be much appreciated.
    Cheers!
        Andrew
