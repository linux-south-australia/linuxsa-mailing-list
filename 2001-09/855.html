Dear 

Michael "Lyppard",
John Davey,
Brian Marr and
Dave Carr,

thank you for your prompt reply on my question concerning
printing with a netgear printserver. I was kinda busy in 
the last time. Thats why it took so long to answer.

Ok, working on the problem I thought how about trying the
lpr system at the very beginning, ie. print to a printer
at the parallel port. With "echo" and "cat" no problem.
But using "lpr" I always received a message saying "Your
printer job xyz was not printed because it was not linked
to the original file"! - Trying to install the printserver
box I received the same message, but I thought it had some-
thing to do with the box. Receiving this message just by
printing to the parallel port made me think of the fact
that there must be something realy wrong on my machine.

For gods sake I have another machine in my network so this
time I tried the installation on this one - and it worked,
just by configuring the apsfilter for a remote printer. The 
result is still not very good since I use an HP4000T and I
am not sure what print driver to use. But anyway it works
at least somehow: The netgear PS105 can be used under linux!

But now where is the problem? My idea is that I made the
problem myself. Some month ago I bought the linux hackers guide.
In it is a recommandation to put the directories in different
partions for security reasons. On the machine that worked with
the printserver I made the partions while installing linux,
whereas on the machine the printer does not work I copied the
different directories, e.g. var, usr, ..., after partioning, ie.
I first installed linux in on or two partions, made more
partions and then copied the directories in these new partions.
Everything seemed to work good but now I assume that this could
be the reason for the printer failure and the message: Your printer
job xyz was not printed because ...

Anyway, now I am thinking about whether to make complete new installations
(I have some more computers in my net) or to look for the linking problem, 
which might be the quicker way to solve the problem: But I have no idea
where to look.

Do you have any suggestions? I would appreciate your answers very much.
Thank you in advance.

Cheers,

Michael

HP seems to like linux. No wonder! Have you ever used this "gpr"-thing?
