Hi Daryl,

I expect that we will need to do somethng like that if we are to be 
able to reproduce what we have built onto other machines. I would very 
much appreciate a look at your notes because the ones I have read, 
while long and detailed, have still left me in the dark &lt;sigh&gt;

Another option might be to build up an image that we can load onto a 
mchine and running it, install a full system that is a clone of what we 
have, subject of course to slightly different hardware. Is Ghost a 
possibility for this? I have Norton Ghost 6.

Cheers,   Ian

&gt; The RedHat kickstart process is fairly good for this sort of stuff
&gt; (especially RPMs), if somewhat poorly documented (the 7.x series
&gt; more so).  Last time I went through the exercise my notes didn't
&gt; go to anywhere near the detail that they should have (ie, I went
&gt; back over them and I didn't have a clue as to what I wrote), but
&gt; I hope to do a better job next time when I have more time up my
&gt; sleeve.  You'd be welcome to these notes.
