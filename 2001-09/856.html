Firstly, let me congratulate and thank all the organisers for the 'linux
installfest' last month. I am pleased to tell you that I now have linux
running and 90% of what I wanted to achieve running.

Now for the 10% !!!

I have an iMac which I would like to connect to the linux box. Even if I
could do this in a rudimentary way so that I could get files up and down
this would be helpful, as the old 'sneaker net' has it's limitations. My
plan is this: to get the linux box to serve ftp, and just use my ftp client
on the Mac (Fetch) to ship stuff back and forth. I would then, (buoyed
along by my success) get telnet to work, then (for didactic purposes!!) a
Web server (both ways, of course) then I might just us well play with
AppleTalk...

however -
It don't work!

I have my iMac connected via an ethernet cross over cable, and I can ping
the iMac. I believe I have set up ftp right. (bear with me, I am new to
networking!) I have installed wu-ftpd and xinetd. xinetd is running (as
reported by ps -A) and ftp is enabled and in the xinetd.conf file. I can
connect to the ftp server successfully local on the linux box (via ftp)
however I get a 'connection refused' message when I try on the iMac from
Fetch. Looking in /var/log/messages tells me that the server never even
starts - it's as if whatever tells xinetd that there is some activity on
the ftp port is not working. I've checked /etc/services, and that seems to
be in order with ftp-data listed against port 20 and ftp on port 21.

Any hints?

regards
