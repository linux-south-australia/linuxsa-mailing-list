&gt;Be careful not to stomp on the toes of those areas of 
&gt;Government which are
&gt;starting to use Linux/xBSD.

Thats a given :o)  We ourselves are using Linux all over the place, but
not necessarily with the blessing of the powers that be.  The only thing
our users notice is that their fileservers go down a whole lot less than
they used to.........

&gt;You might like to consider some of the other driving forces behind what
&gt;Government departments use for their OS. For example, the companies who
&gt;have Government IT work outsoured to them, their policies and other
&gt;factors.

Again, that goes without saying.  I have nothing against the organisations
who are profiting because of the work they get from government outsourcing,
however I do have a lot against the government policymakers who do not
accept
opensource OSes as "mandated" software for these IT companies to use.  That
is where the problem lies IMHO.  

While I can see their point of view that they want a standard operating 
environment across government, this should not come at the expense of 
millions of taxpayer dollars when they could have an SOE which would 
do at least the same if not better job than what they have now.

(of course I am talking server OS here, not desktop, tho I believe Linux is 
getting extremely close to the point of offering itself as an option on the 
corporate desktop with no reduced functionality to the average user)
