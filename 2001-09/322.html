The Telstra Competition Notice re: ADSL is the product of a lot of 
intensive effort by a minority of ISP's and carriers to give the ACCC 
enough evidence with which to raise this notice and force positive 
change to happen (I'm optimistic of that positive change happening 
quite fast). Its always easy to find loud noises, harder to find 
people determined to actually do something about fixing it and 
prepared to spend the time and take the risks to do so.

Telstra's rural ADSL coverage is in fact becoming quite widespread in 
(at least relatively large) rural centers as well as in capital 
cities. The positive (hoped-for) consequences of the competition 
notice are likely to include a rise in the number of ADSL providers 
at the retail level in all ADSL coverage areas once Telstra is forced 
to provide truly viable wholesale entry points.

Today, due to the unviable economics imposed by Telstra at the 
wholesale level, competition at the retail level outside of capital 
cities in the ADSL regime is economic madness (and as a result it's 
quite absent from the scene). I hope this is about to change.

While lots of people have been moving hot air around, a small 
minority have been doing a lot of hard work to actually make things 
better for everyone in the country in this respect. I am now starting 
to believe that it might just start to succeed relatively soon.

The changes we will hopefully see will not only be in terms of an 
increase in retail competition in ADSL services, but also in the 
emergence of genuinely new service variations as a result of the 
second half of the competition notice (which is intended to force 
Telstra to improve the quality of technical interaction with their 
ADSL network, not just the price of same).

It is -so- easy to be sad about the lack of alternatives. Its harder 
to actually do something about fixing it. Some of us have been, and I 
just wanted to say that here.

I feel better now :)

&gt;Nothing new here (or simply a variation of an old theme).
&gt;
&gt;Sadly, I feel that in many cases there is no practical or affordable
&gt;alternative to using Telstra's services (such as ADSL or GSM mobile) in
&gt;rural Australia.
