&gt; Kudos to Intel for their clock throttling capability. However, If one reads

&gt; article is obviously talking about the possible loss of data and not the
&gt; hardware that got cooked being that AMD is so much less expensive  @$170(US)
&gt; than Intel @$550(US). I'd like to know the MTBF of  "socket A notches" never
&gt; having seen one fail, personally. And who, other than Tom's,
&gt; removes/replaces heat sinks on a running system?  8 ) Really!

No one does.

And no one gets cable into their fan by accident either or forgets to
reconenect their fan  by acident or any of that stuff.

Afer all we live in an ideal world where unexpected thigns dont go wrong.
Right?

&gt;  Having both Intel and AMD systems,  I enjoy the performance of the AMD
&gt; enough to recommend touching it with a barge pole. In fact, a twig. Do know
&gt; the idiosyncrasies of both platforms before your purchase and its targeted
&gt; use.

I now feel vindicated in buying my expensive old slow but well engineered
intel CPUs 9 months ago when everyone was going for the latest(read most
immature) technologies.

Intel has simply had more CPUs in the field longer and presumbly
reveceived more feedback and is aiming presuambly at a merkt where
robustness is preferred over performance.
