&gt; It uses the VIA

&gt; RH7.1, but had no more luck, and I don't like it :)


Ah, but RH7.1 comes with XFree86 4.0.3, which is much nicer than the 
3.3.6 version that comes with RH6.2! :-) I'd strongly recommend the 
upgrade to the newer version of XFree86, if you can cope with RH7.1 Once 
you start getting over the little differences from 6.2, it starts to 
feel like home again :-) (But hey, stick with 6.2 if you're happy with 
it [clap your hands?])


&gt; A Linux X server (SVGA) actually comes on the CD (nice surprise!), but it
&gt; seems to make no difference. Xconfigurator fails to detect the card, but I
&gt; tell it to use to use the SVGA server, with 16Mb, etc etc.


Note that <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/current/Status28.html">http://www.xfree86.org/current/Status28.html</A>#28 lists the 
current S3 chipsets that are supported, and the SavagePro isn't 
specifically listed, but at a guess, in XFree86 3.3.6 you'd want to try 
the s3_savage driver (not really sure, never used one of those cards 
before). Set that in the Device section of your XF86Config file, and see 
how it goes. I also generally find leaving the driver to decide how much 
RAM is on the video card works better.

However, that said, if it's still not finding the video card, you can 
try setting the BusID in the Device section to tell X where the card 
"is". For example, when I do 'scanpci' I get the following (snipped):

pci bus 0x0 cardnum 0x08 function 0x0000: vendor 0x121a device 0x0005
  3Dfx Interactive Voodoo3

pci bus 0x1 cardnum 0x00 function 0x0000: vendor 0x10de device 0x0028
  NVidia Riva TNT2

As a result, I have the following in XF86Config:

Section "Device"
     Identifier  "TNT2"
     Driver      "nv"
     BusID       "PCI:1:0:0"
EndSection

Section "Device"
     Identifier  "Voodoo3"
     Driver      "tdfx"
     BusID       "PCI:0:8:0"
EndSection

That way, X finds that Voodoo3 card when it normally only finds my TNT2 
card. YMMV.

&gt; I would love to get this working. I would be happy to just use the virge,
&gt; though X is a *tiny bit 'fuzzy' (or is that just X?).


I've had a similar problem with two different video cards in the past 
that were "fuzzy," and the way that I solved the problem was to remove 
all the ModeLine settings from the Monitor section(s) of your XF86Config 
file, and let X sort it all out by probing the video card (Make sure 
your monitor H & V rate settings are right, of course!). I've also found 
that having the DPMS turned on (if your card/monitor support it) also 
helps. Add the line

   Options "dpms"

to your Monitor section. Beats me why that should make a difference, but 
it did. *shrug*

&gt; Any experience or advice would be *greatly appreciated!


Well, there's my experiences. Hope it's of use :-)

Cheers,
