roger &lt;<A HREF="mailto:roger@mambo.net">roger@mambo.net</A>&gt; mouthed off:

&gt; No one seems to have mention it so I will.
&gt; Most of the Government Network has been unplugged from the Net since
&gt; Tuesday. (rumor has it they literally pulled the cable from the
&gt; firewall in blind panic)

And your solution would have been to leave the internet connection up
and contribute to the global spread of the worm eh? One of the first
rules of managing a network breach is containment.

&gt; Hospitals Education and other dept's are also down.
&gt; The network was trashed, including exchange servers by NIMBDA
&gt; EDS does not allow *BSD or Linux on their networks becuase they are
&gt; not safe!!!

Nothing stopping you from running Solaris servers.
 
&gt; This appears to be well hushed and should be made public, after all
&gt; we,
&gt; the taxpayers,  pay EDS substantial amount money to look after our
&gt; infrastructure.

SOME of the infrastructure.

And maybe if State Govt. institutions PATCHED THEIR SERVERS they
wouldn't have had the trouble they did. Or possibly, heaven forbid,
didn't run MS based products.

There are many, many servers in State Govt that are NOT managed by EDS.
And there's nothing stopping Linux or *BSD servers from being used on
agency networks.

It should also be noted that the infection originated in a State Govt.
agency.

Getting your facts straight before mouthing off is always a good idea.
