&gt;I think that we will have to expend some effort to get them to 
&gt;change course ...

I'm not necessarily advocating a total change away from MS in 
government.  Yes I'd like to see it happen, but it is so well
entrenched that a total change is counter-productive, at least
in the short term.  I'd like to see at the very least that OSS
is given an equal footing and isn't on the list of "software thou
shalt not use", because once IT people start using it in their 
environments the benefits will start to show up.

Not all IT people in government are up to speed with Linux anyway,
and it would take more than a few successful instances of it to 
convince them.  Certainly we've convinced a number of people just
through our simple uses of it in the server environment.  We've 
got a Samba PDC at almost all of our sites at present, the only 
reason we keep one NT machine on the network is because of a Progress
database app.
