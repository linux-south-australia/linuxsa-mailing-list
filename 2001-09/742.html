I still don't see what is wrong with just using "chkconfig squid on"  ??

I know for a fact that the "chkconfig --add squid" step is already done
by the RPM install of squid, so there isn't even that concern.

&gt;If you install the linuxconf package off the RH7.1 CD you can then find a

I hate to say it, but I'm real glad that they finally stopped forcing 
linuxconf onto
default installs. Controlling services startup/shutdown/etc and the 
functionality
of 'userconf' were the only _safe_ things you could do with it anyway (IMOHO).

On the flipside, it is very very sloppy with it's syntax when it starts 
trying to
configure various daemons. I have seen it put no less than 30 identical
"ServerAdmin" entries in httpd.conf (and No, they weren't for vitual hosts ;-)
and wipe entire DNS zone files just because they weren't written by linuxconf!
In effect, it has no capacity for examining the existing state of 
daemon/service
configurations (instead it stores it's own idea of their contents) and thus 
makes
it impossible to manage ANYTHING manually. If you ever want to use linuxconf
for these jobs, then you must always use linuxconf. If you manually config 
Named,
Apache, Sendmail or many others, and then go to config them in linuxconf, 
it will
wipe all your changes in a heartbeat.

I have a friend whose RH box (was 6.2, now 7.1) runs a web/mail server off 
modem
link to BPD (at home) for his small hosting co. needs. At least 6 times 
last year (when he
still had linuxconf) I had to setup most of his system again from scratch 
(and backup)
because he had somehow fragged things using linuxconf (GUI version). I 
always asked
him why he had done so, when he knew by now that linuxconf did this sort of 
thing.
He would always tell me that after trying to understand the config files 
for about half
a day, he got frustrated and just went to linuxconf because he knew that it 
could do
it for him. He had books and I told him where the How-to's were, but having 
that blasted
program there always became too much temptation. &lt;/rant&gt;

If newbie operators/admins are going to be spoonfed by a do-it-all system 
management
program, it might as well be Webmin or something else that pays closer 
attention to
the ACTUAL state of config, and not one that arogantly assumes that it 
already knows.
Anyway, I personally, will not miss linuxconf.

However, I sorely miss having the "adduser" shell-script that used to be a 
standard
feature on 2.0.x Linuxes. This probably went the way of the Dodo due to 
userconf ;-)
Now you write your own or else it is four commands just for one job :-(

Anyway,
just my 2c worth

Cheers,
-Daniel

PS: Brad, no offence intended. I realise that linuxconf was really helpful 
for some things,
I just think that there are now safer programs to use (and hence the 
non-default thing).
