&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I wasn't at the installfest because I didn't know about it, sorry.

Hi Zane...

&gt; I've got Red Hat 7.0 from a magazine or something, and I'm trying to
&gt; install it as a dual-boot with Win98. Part of the reason for this is that I
&gt; don't know if I can get the modem to work under Linux. I've been using

WinModem -- probably not... I would think that if you spent some time on
google.com and/or gateway.com, you could find the chip it uses, and whether
it is supported... PCCard (PCMCIA) Modem/Net cards aren't that expensive
nowadays anyway, so that may be your best option...


&gt; System Commander 2k to resize my partitions, but it's corrupted all my data
&gt; and I am ready to use lilo.

Not quite sure what you mean here -- lilo doesn't do partitioning, fdisk
does... If your data is corrupted, and you have given up on getting it
back, I suggest fdisking away (or disk druidding or whatever). I may have
misunderstood what you said then though...

&gt; 
&gt; But first I need someone to help me with the install. I have a Gateway Solo
&gt; 2150 laptop, with a decent amount of RAM and disk (i can't remember, I
&gt; should be ashamed.) It has a Creative SB PCI64V - EV1938 sound card and
&gt; Actiontec V.90 Internal Mini-PCI, as well as a Toshiba DVD-ROM drive.

Ah, there's your modem chip -- is it on the RH HCL? Any documentation for
it visible with google? your DVD probably won't work as a DVD player... at
least not without some serious messing about...

&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me if it's worth trying Linux, or if it's going to be too
&gt; hard to install my (seemingly) WinModem? After I update RH, which is in
&gt; itself a challenge, can I download drivers for the modem and card?

Well, I would suggest it would be worth it, I think it's likely you can get
it going somehow -- you may need to try an external normal modem... Also,
bear in mind that installing Linux (or any OS) can get you in trouble, and
you may not be able to boot your normal OS without messing about with lilo,
which can be daunting for the new user... So make sure you have alternative
access to the internet while you do it -- that way, you can utilise
resourcs like google and linuxsa without the use of a functional laptop...
in the worst case, make a windows boot floppy so you can get back to your
windows partition even if your MBR is rooted...

but yeah, once you are redhatted, you should still be able to get drivers
-- you may need to use windows or even floppynet to transfer the driver...
