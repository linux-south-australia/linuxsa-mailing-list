&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of any support resources for Solaris x86 on Laptops
&gt; &gt; in Adelaide? I've looked on various websites, but they rarely have the
&gt; &gt; solutions to the problems that I encounter, and for some reason, I
&gt; &gt; seem to encounter all of the problems (eg X not workable, net cards
&gt; &gt; not working, installer running insanely slowly, allocating 4G to a
&gt; &gt; solaris partition only to have the installer tell me it's not enough,
&gt; &gt; despite the fact that it plainly is enough.. rebooting requiring cold
&gt; &gt; power-off, DHCP servers self-configuring their arcane config files,
&gt; &gt; and then having syntax errors etc etc etc)...
&gt; 
&gt; If you're installing Solaris 8 for x86, throw the first CD away (the
&gt; install CD) and boot off the *second* CD (Mine's labelled "... Software
&gt; 1"). The installer is just like the Solaris 7 one. This will allow you to
&gt; create the partitions you like (I've done so one a 2GB disk) and allow you
&gt; to select other packages like PCMCIA support, which only seems to install
&gt; itself when you don't want it.

heh -- ok, I'll try that next time... this time, I managed to get it all
right by re-installing about ten times... the fdisk is the most stupid
fdisk in the world, and by default creates overlapping partitions (by 1
cylinder...)... I just created a partition that had plenty of margin on
each side, and all worked ok...

I still don't really understand what I ahve done to make the networking
work, but it works now... 

&gt; 
&gt; As for the X thing. It might be possible to compile an XFree86 Server to
&gt; run on the Solaris machine and have it XDCMP to localhost. Probably not
&gt; ideal, but it will save you having to buy a commercial X Server. If you
&gt; don't mind a commercial one, there are a number of well known companies
&gt; that advertise in most unixy magazines (in fact, one of them actually
&gt; advertises Solaris drivers). Can't remember the names, though.

interesting... we have used Xi before, but would rather keep away from
it... I'm still bitter about the infernal stupidity of Solaris, especially
the installer, especially on x86 and especially on laptops... Surely
someone can make a SPARC laptop (perhaps a crusoe-based one... maybe a
microcode change to a crusoe vaio... :)



&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So... is there any Adelaide-based Solaris x86 (particularly laptop)
&gt; &gt; support around? I'd be happy to pay someone who can actually _solve_
&gt; &gt; the problems I've been having, as long as a solution is found... :)
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure if you'd find something like that, but good luck anyway. :-)
&gt; 

thanks a heap for your help... as it turns out, I fixed it, but I'm sure
your advice will come in handy next time :)
