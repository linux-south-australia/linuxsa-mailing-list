&gt;&gt; As Chris knows, I find apt-get unnecessarily fiddly.  I'm sure that it
&gt;&gt; does a good job, but it's too fine-grained for my liking.  It also
&gt;&gt; shows you all the dependencies and potential conflicts, and expects
&gt;&gt; you to do something about it.
&gt;
&gt; dselect will do something similar for you but it hasn't got the most
&gt; intuitive of interfaces.

To put it mildly.  I've used^H^H^H^Htried to use dselect as well.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, I've had quite a few replies, so I'll plan to do this some
&gt;&gt; time.  Due to my schedule, it may not be on the normal meeting date,
&gt;&gt; but I'll try to do it soon.
&gt;
&gt; Actually i'd be interested in finding out more about the package
&gt; format which is used (I don't know anything about it). A few people
&gt; have mentioned to me that its a better than rpm and that the LSB group
&gt; should be looking at it.

Hmm.  It's basically tar :-) There are additional files which describe
dependencies and where to put the stuff (the pathnames are all
relative) and such.  I'll see if I can find some docco for you.  My
feeling is that the package format is suboptimal, but the user
interface is simple enough to be easy to use.
