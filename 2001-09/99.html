Oh yes... what are a few orders of magnitude between friends ;)
Actually, I just heard back form Toshiba (via a very friendly local
contractor)  and the vertical scan rate was given as 60-70-80 Hz and the
horizontal as 48.5-60-68.8 kHz with a resolution of 1024x768 (non
interlaced).  No qualifying info was given...
Does this mean that the 60Hz goes with the 48.5kHz?  I won't have a chance
to try it for a while so if anyone could explain the relationship of the
frequencies to me I would be grateful.

Thanks everyone for all the replies so far!

Cheers 
Pete

	Actually the Vertical is 60Hz, the Horizonal will be in KHz. the
horizontal is
	fairly lenient on you.

	&gt; Hi Folks,
	&gt;
	&gt; I am very new at this Linux stuff and so to get me started I went
along to
	&gt; the recent instsallfest to get help with installing RH7.1 on my
laptop.
	&gt; Unfortunatly, after *much* help (thanks guys)... it did not work
because
	&gt; Xfree86 did not recognise my vid card.  The fix was to download
X4.1.0 which
	&gt; did.  I did this and after much mucking around due to some corrupt
tarballs
	&gt; on the mirror site I was using... I finally got it to work -
sortof :(
	&gt; Now X windows recognises my vid card but I cannot get the settings
right for
	&gt; the LCD screen. I dual boot with NT and it tells me that the
horizontal
	&gt; shoulf be 60Hz @ 1024x768 but no mention of the veritcal rate.  My
toshy
	&gt; manual gives me *heaps* of rate combinations for the card but none
for the
	&gt; screen.  I can get it to work with an external CRT but get very
wierd
	&gt; results on my LCD after trying every combination of 60Hz and the
standard
	&gt; settings given by Xfree86.  Has anyone else sucessully got Xfree86
to work
	&gt; with a toshiba laptop?
	&gt;
	&gt; Sorry this is a bit wordy... I just thought I should spell out
what I had
	&gt; done before in case it is relevant.
	&gt; TIA
	&gt; Cheers
	&gt;
	&gt; Pete
