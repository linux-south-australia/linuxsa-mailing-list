&gt; Personally I'd like to start a similar process with the SA govt.
&gt; How far one would get I'm not sure, the unfortunate part is that
&gt; the people making the decisions in govt. are extremely one-eyed & 
&gt; close-minded to anything other than MS.  The people who make the 
&gt; decisions are also people who have no idea what life is like at 
&gt; "ground level" so to speak.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm kinda hoping that some of the virus problems we're having in
&gt; the govt. network will open a few eyeballs that MS isn't all its
&gt; cracked up to be.  (And boy is it cracking up lately...........!)


I think that we will have to expend some effort to get them to change course ...


However, an argument from biology seems highly appropriate here.


We are all becoming more aware of the need for biodiversity. 

Any organism that experiences a genetic bottleneck, like say the cheetah, 

is in for a tough time. As their genetic diversity goes down, the ability 

of virii and bacteria to bypass their immune systems and finally 
exterminate them.


Clearly, Microsoft has a dangerously high percentage of the computer 
industry, and diversity is good for a number of reasons.
