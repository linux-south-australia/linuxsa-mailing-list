&gt;&gt; Kudos to Intel for their clock throttling capability. However, If one reads
&gt;&gt; the fine print, "AMD did not bless the Thunderbird core with ANY thermal
&gt;&gt; protection whatsoever. If the heat sink should come off, the owner is facing
&gt;&gt; a significant financial loss.", one understands that the writer of the
&gt;&gt; article is obviously talking about the possible loss of data and not the
&gt;&gt; hardware that got cooked
&gt;
&gt; That's not correct.  The article clearly illustrates the risk of
&gt; destruction of the motherboard, and the risk of the motherboard
&gt; actually catching fire.

Power supplies can do this, too.  So can monitors.

&gt;&gt; being that AMD is so much less expensive  @$170(US)
&gt;&gt; than Intel @$550(US). I'd like to know the MTBF of  "socket A notches" never
&gt;&gt; having seen one fail, personally. And who, other than Tom's,
&gt;&gt; removes/replaces heat sinks on a running system?  8 ) Really!
&gt;
&gt; It isn't just an issue of the fan/heatsink falling off;  A fan failure
&gt; will lead to a similar (although less spectacular) result.

OK, I haven't read the entire article, but what about ACPI?  It's
supposed to monitor the processor temperature and turn off at a
specific temperature.  I've just installed a Duron motherboard, and I
set the temperature to 60° in recollection of overheating problems
years ago.  I wonder why I don't find any mention of this feature in
the article.

&gt;&gt;  Having both Intel and AMD systems,  I enjoy the performance of the AMD
&gt;&gt; enough to recommend touching it with a barge pole. In fact, a twig. Do know
&gt;&gt; the idiosyncrasies of both platforms before your purchase and its targeted
&gt;&gt; use.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;  AMD might be faster than Intel for equivalent money;  Indeed,
&gt; for the number of dollars I spend on an Intel CPU, I'm sure I could find
&gt; an AMD based system which would set fire to my server room *much* quicker!

I am currently running four AMD processors.  In a couple of weeks,
when the VIA 266A chipset becomes available, I'll buy another one.  If
it catches fire, I'll report.
