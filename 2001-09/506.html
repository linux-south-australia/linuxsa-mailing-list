&gt; &gt; I am just wondering if anyone knows of  any software that

&gt; I believe LDAP has been used to do this.  Unfortunately, I don't have 
&gt; any details, and I suspect it's a non-trivial task, but there's bound

Natively, neither Windows nor Unix can authenticate using a compatible
authentication mechanism. So, you need to install something on one that's
compatible with the other.

NIS GINA allows you to make NT authenticate against a NIS domain. It
requires that you set up NIS on a unix server. Apparently
NISGINA works. FYI, GINA on NT is the functional equivalent of PAM.

LDAP is not an authentication system, but a way of accessing data (which
can be authentication info, such as usernames and passwords). As far as I
know, the closet you'll get to having a Windows box authenticate of the
LDAP directory content is through the use of Active Directory on Win2K and
the like. If you *really* want to read about the problems involved here, I
recommend you search the <A HREF="mailto:samba-technical@samba.org">samba-technical@samba.org</A> and <A HREF="mailto:pamldap@padl.com">pamldap@padl.com</A>
mailing lists and see what Luke Howard has to say on the matter. He also
wrote a paper on the topic.

pam_smbpass. You can use Samba to authenticate Windows clients against a
database on a unix box. If that's your only unix box, and it supports PAM,
you can use pam_smbpass (available from samba.org) to authenticate against
that unix boxes smbpasswd file. If you have multiple unix machines, you
can use ssh and rsync to copy that smbpasswd file to *all* of your unix
boxen.

winbindd. This will one day be the best solution. It's apparently able to
compile, but I haven't heard of anyone using it in production. It's part
of Samba and allows unix clients (that support PAM) to act as though they
were NT clients and authenticate against a Primary Domain Controller
(which can be another Samba box or a Windows NT/2K server). I'm unsure
whether winbindd will make it into Samba 2.2.2, which is due out in a
matter of days/weeks. For more info on this, check out the
<A HREF="mailto:samba-technical@samba.org">samba-technical@samba.org</A> mailing list archive.

There may be more alternatives, but I can't think of them right now.

Hope it helps,
Matt
