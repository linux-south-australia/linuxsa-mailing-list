Ahhhh, rpm-4....

Well, if you have db3-? installed, popt? installed and db3-util (I think),
you should be fine - to get around the dependencies, you need to rpm -Uvh
[all 3 of them at once].

I've had to do this for a few systems that are waiting for RH 7.2 and it
works fine.  However, I may have missed a package so YMMV...

I would have thought that you would have received some dependency messages
whilst trying to install this?

&gt; This began as a simple job to install an updated RPM on a RedHat 6.2
&gt; box. That was six hours ago, and it's still not installed.
&gt;
&gt; The RPM has been built using rpm version 4.something; and refuses to
&gt; install with 6.2's supplied rpm 3.0.4. There is a widely available rpm
&gt; 4.0 for RH 6.2, but it won't install with rpm 3.0.4 either! It wants
&gt; files from the original rpm 4.0, among other things, producing a
&gt; Catch-22... :(
&gt;
&gt; RedHat did have rpm 3.0.5 - which allowed the rpm 4 update to happen -
&gt; on their FTP site; but I can't find it there or on any of the usual
&gt; mirrors now.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone still got a copy? Or a simple way to install the latest rpm
&gt; 4.whatever on RH6.2 - without getting entangled in a web of file
&gt; dependencies?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; TIA,
