Hi Brian,

We gave up on Mandrake and loaded up RH 7.1 with succcess. Seems it has 
a better driver or coding or whatever for this card, Cirrus Logic GD-
5446. My son did some fiddling during install and lo it worked. He cant 
remember exactly what he did but we are now getting a crystal clear 
screen running at 1024. Before with Mandrake 8 and 8.1 we could not 
even get a VGA signal up at 640 and 256 colours. 

Sorry I cant help any more on what the change was but RH 7.1 is doing a 
great job at the moment.

My next trick will be to get StarOffice in there plus a few other 
applications and games to provide a range of tools for demonstration. 
We also need to get a few handy icons running so as to come close to 
what an average Windows user might expect. When planning on switching 
people over to a new system you must always go from the known to the 
unkown so a familar desktop look will ease the user into the Linux 
environment. Later they can modify the environment to suit themsleves.

My eventual goal is for this to be a test bed system that we can cut 
down to fit into a 1.2 G drive for our other systems. As we get closer 
to that goal I will need to work out how to get an image made or 
perhaps a kickstart file so that we can reproduce what we have built 
onto other systems. 

I appreciate your help and the many others who have offered advice and 
help through this list and also through the Linux Forum on CompuServe. 

Cheers, Ian

&gt; 
&gt; Some time ago I had a problem with Mandrake 7.0 and later 8.0 not 
&gt; being able 
&gt; to configure a Diamond Stealth card. This happened several times 
&gt; right at the 
&gt; end of an install. I was forced to locate and install some files 
&gt; in /etc/X11  
&gt; and do some hacking on the XF86Config file. You take a punt in 
&gt; doing this as 
&gt; you may stuff up a monitor. My hack worked ok and continues to do 
&gt; its job. 
&gt; Using a working XF86Config file may be a good place to start.  
&gt; or
&gt; Can you get another inexpensive card to get your PC at least 
&gt; operational ?&gt;
