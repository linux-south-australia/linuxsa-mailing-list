&gt; What problems did you have with OpenBSD?

I didn't have any real "problems" with OpenBSD. I could get along quite
nicely with it. The gripes that I did have with it are mainly to do with
the installer (I believe the FreeBSD installer pisses all over its
OpenBSD counterpart) and the management.

While the software comming from the doors of OpenBSD is great, I found
that the project itself lacked the direction of FreeBSD and NetBSD. 

I mean, the thing that really sets OpenBSD apart from other alternatives
is its so-called "proactive security". Apart from that, OpenBSD doesn't
really have much that FreeBSD or NetBSD has (that I've been able to
notice).

I got really enthusiastic about OpenBSD for a while there. Got myself
2.8 CDs, tried out 2.9 (FTP install) and did my best to wade through the
massive amount of ambient crud on their mailing lists.

In the end, I decided that:

  o ) FreeBSD does a damn good job at security. OpenBSD is not immune to
      security problems by any stretch of the imagination (for example,
      I'm told that OpenBSD suffered from the same telnetd overflow
      problem that FreeBSD had, just "forgot" to tell everyone about it
      or something.

  o ) If I really need to run a BSD-based OS on a machine with a wierd
      processor, I'm covered by NetBSD.

  o ) The project management (or lack thereof) at OpenBSD really annoyed
      me. There didn't seem to be any real direction. It was all about
      security. That's fine -- security is a good thing, but security
      seemed about "it". The IPF fiasco (without starting another
      debate) really sent me "over the edge". I didn't like the way Theo
      handled it, so I chose to use an OS made by people that, IMHO, did
      a better job of it.

  o ) FreeBSD sounds better than "OpenBSD" :-)

There's nothing wrong with OpenBSD, "it just sucks".
