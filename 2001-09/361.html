&gt; Does anyone know of any support resources for Solaris x86 on Laptops
&gt; in Adelaide? I've looked on various websites, but they rarely have the
&gt; solutions to the problems that I encounter, and for some reason, I
&gt; seem to encounter all of the problems (eg X not workable, net cards
&gt; not working, installer running insanely slowly, allocating 4G to a
&gt; solaris partition only to have the installer tell me it's not enough,
&gt; despite the fact that it plainly is enough.. rebooting requiring cold
&gt; power-off, DHCP servers self-configuring their arcane config files,
&gt; and then having syntax errors etc etc etc)...

If you're installing Solaris 8 for x86, throw the first CD away (the
install CD) and boot off the *second* CD (Mine's labelled "... Software
1"). The installer is just like the Solaris 7 one. This will allow you to
create the partitions you like (I've done so one a 2GB disk) and allow you
to select other packages like PCMCIA support, which only seems to install
itself when you don't want it.

As for the X thing. It might be possible to compile an XFree86 Server to
run on the Solaris machine and have it XDCMP to localhost. Probably not
ideal, but it will save you having to buy a commercial X Server. If you
don't mind a commercial one, there are a number of well known companies
that advertise in most unixy magazines (in fact, one of them actually
advertises Solaris drivers). Can't remember the names, though.

&gt; So... is there any Adelaide-based Solaris x86 (particularly laptop)
&gt; support around? I'd be happy to pay someone who can actually _solve_
&gt; the problems I've been having, as long as a solution is found... :)

Not sure if you'd find something like that, but good luck anyway. :-)

thx,
Matt
