&gt; Anyhow, just as a tip, get SAMBA working on the box. This would be good so
&gt; you can demonstrate that they could use the Linux box in the Windoze
&gt; network. They probably have a NT Domain. Samba can work beautifully on an NT
&gt; domain, I use it at home. Make sure that you have both the server and client
&gt; working so that the people can map to the workstation and map from the
&gt; workstation.

The client is called "smbfs".  It works well and
you don't need the Samba daemons running to use it.
 
&gt; As with the GHOST image, let me know what happens. Unless the boxes are all
&gt; the same I am wondering if you are going to have a problem. Never tried it.

Ghost works fine.  Try not to ship with embedded IP addresses
or PPP phone numbers.  You may need to set up a DHCP server
on another machine so that it ships with no preinstalled IP
address.

&gt; Another thing is maybe stop a few useless services. Might make
&gt; the box run a little faster.

There are remarkably few "useless" services.  The default
system daemons have a resident set size of 2MB, so they
are barely worth optimising.  Although utilities like
"sendmail" look useless, you'll find a lot of basic
stuff will break without it.

My machine has:

   APPLICATION        SIZE (MB)   RSS (MB)
   StarOffice           40         35
   Communicator         25          4
   X + xfs              25         18   (remember to deduct the size of the video card memory
                                         from the sizes top reports)
   GNOME Desktop        17          7
   System daemons        5          2
                     -----      -----
                       112         66

which overstates things slightly (size 6MB, rss 1MB) as my
xfs has 5000 or so fonts.

So worthwhile optimisations are looking for a word
processor that doesn't use the Wind/U windows emulator,
shipping with just a few fonts (say the default plus
the free Windows fonts), looking at removing backing
store from X,  looking at the applets started
by KDE or GNOME, and removing any automatically-
started applications (like the help text reader).
