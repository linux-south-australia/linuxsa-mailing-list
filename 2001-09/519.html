I am using NIS on linux with the UNIX services on
Windows 2000.  This works pretty well once you get it
setup.  When a person changes their password on NT (we
are running a domain) it automatically changes it in
the NIS database.  The other site that I am consulting
for I have Solaris 8 running NIS+ and Unix services
running on NT4.0  This also works well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Currently trying to do exactly that!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; My thoughts include using LDAP.  I know it works
&gt; for *nix clients and mac
&gt; &gt; &gt; clients and even Win98 clients
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Whilst it's possible to get an LDAP client or
&gt; server for each of those
&gt; &gt; clients, they don't necessarily support the
&gt; handing over of all
&gt; &gt; security to an LDAP server. They also use
&gt; different encryption algorithms
&gt; &gt; for storing passwords.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Understand that bit - my main emphasis is on
&gt; entering the password once
&gt; and it filters through the network in whatever
&gt; format the various
&gt; architectures require...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Welcome to
&gt; incompatible^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hheterogeneous
&gt; networking.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; hehe - currently, when new users come to enter their
&gt; passwords for the
&gt; first time, they enter it into the NIS and then,
&gt; with VNC, into the NT PDC
&gt; and then, they even get to provide another password
&gt; for Netscape
&gt; Calendar... it's stupid!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; - it's just this blasted Win2k stuff that
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't seem to work the way it's meant to
&gt; *sigh*.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The servers can't even
&gt; &gt; &gt; use alias names in clusters and had to replace
&gt; the file sharing part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; our Win2K network with a samba server *sigh*.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is that a bad thing? Microsoft themselves admit
&gt; that it's best to run one
&gt; &gt; service per server, to avoid stability problems.
&gt; It may not be a bad thing
&gt; &gt; to let your Win2K boxen do the Windows specific
&gt; stuff and let your unix
&gt; &gt; box do the rest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Ummmmmm, well, I want to have a name for the machine
&gt; that is unique for
&gt; asset tracking and I want a functional name so that
&gt; people can always find
&gt; the resource.  I understand that downtime in a Win2K
&gt; environment is
&gt; obbligatory, but that, again, is stupid.  I do it at
&gt; home with my Linux
&gt; machines and we do it at work with Solaris machines
&gt; and some of the NT
&gt; machines and it should just work...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One thing I forgot to mention in my previous
&gt; e-mail:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  If you are planning on using Samba as a PDC for
&gt; Win2K clients, it is best
&gt; &gt; to use Samba 2.2.1a (or soon-to-be, Samba 2.2.2).
&gt; Win2K SP2 added a nice
&gt; &gt; little "feature" that caused a large compatibility
&gt; problem (ie, it stopped
&gt; &gt; working completely). These late versions of Samba
&gt; overcame this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; *grrrrrrr* - They won't let me ban windoze at
&gt; work... yet... the windoze
&gt; guys are starting to get on the campaign trail as
&gt; well though :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; thx,
&gt; &gt; Matt
