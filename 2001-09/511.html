&gt; &gt; Currently trying to do exactly that!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My thoughts include using LDAP.  I know it works for *nix clients and mac
&gt; &gt; clients and even Win98 clients
&gt;
&gt; Whilst it's possible to get an LDAP client or server for each of those
&gt; clients, they don't necessarily support the handing over of all
&gt; security to an LDAP server. They also use different encryption algorithms
&gt; for storing passwords.
&gt;
Understand that bit - my main emphasis is on entering the password once
and it filters through the network in whatever format the various
architectures require...

&gt; Welcome to incompatible^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hheterogeneous networking.
&gt;
hehe - currently, when new users come to enter their passwords for the
first time, they enter it into the NIS and then, with VNC, into the NT PDC
and then, they even get to provide another password for Netscape
Calendar... it's stupid!

&gt; &gt; - it's just this blasted Win2k stuff that
&gt; &gt; doesn't seem to work the way it's meant to *sigh*.
&gt;
&gt; :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The servers can't even
&gt; &gt; use alias names in clusters and had to replace the file sharing part of
&gt; &gt; our Win2K network with a samba server *sigh*.
&gt;
&gt; Is that a bad thing? Microsoft themselves admit that it's best to run one
&gt; service per server, to avoid stability problems. It may not be a bad thing
&gt; to let your Win2K boxen do the Windows specific stuff and let your unix
&gt; box do the rest.
&gt;
Ummmmmm, well, I want to have a name for the machine that is unique for
asset tracking and I want a functional name so that people can always find
the resource.  I understand that downtime in a Win2K environment is
obbligatory, but that, again, is stupid.  I do it at home with my Linux
machines and we do it at work with Solaris machines and some of the NT
machines and it should just work...

&gt; One thing I forgot to mention in my previous e-mail:
&gt;
&gt;  If you are planning on using Samba as a PDC for Win2K clients, it is best
&gt; to use Samba 2.2.1a (or soon-to-be, Samba 2.2.2). Win2K SP2 added a nice
&gt; little "feature" that caused a large compatibility problem (ie, it stopped
&gt; working completely). These late versions of Samba overcame this.
&gt;
*grrrrrrr* - They won't let me ban windoze at work... yet... the windoze
guys are starting to get on the campaign trail as well though :-)

&gt; thx,
&gt; Matt
