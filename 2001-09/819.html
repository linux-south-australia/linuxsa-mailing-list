Not so sure, there was a large range of people present, some of whom were
Linux experts.

&gt; how do you think your presentation was received?

I'm not the one to ask. There did seem to be good interest, but I have
never been to an ACS meeting before. One highly-skilled Adelaide developer
walked out, leaving me a voicemail that "he couldn't stand it any more",
maybe that tells you something :-)

I did a circuit beforehand asking people why they had come. The mix was
about evenly split between very technical people (many with some free
software exposure) and not-so-technical people (many with no exposure to
free software.) 50 copies of a paper-friendly version of "What are Linux
and BSD" from <A HREF="http://shearer.org">http://shearer.org</A> vanished.

I hope people found it useful.
