lucky you
 
&gt; &gt; no it was serious.  I emailed them about a month ago asking a
&gt; &gt; simple question (as a prospective customer) and have never
&gt; &gt; got a reply.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that this is the place to be complaining about Leader's
&gt; apparent lack of response. That's something you should take up with
&gt; them.  Ring them, or pop into their store. It's not that hard.

I don't think I'll bother thanks.
I only mentioned it here cos I found it somewhat odd that they
appear to support linuxsa every so often (which is usually a sign
of a good company - supporting that type of thing) yet my
experiences of them (although brief) are not good at all.

Dave.
