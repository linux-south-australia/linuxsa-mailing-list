&gt;There are also many instances where a thin client (linux or 
&gt;not) or even
&gt;something like a WYSE terminal are suitable for the purpose of an
&gt;information terminal. I have seen instances where a 'fat' Windows PC is
&gt;used with Terminal Emulation software as the alternative.

Mwhahahaaa.......sorry :o)
Our primary database system runs off a Unix (Sco) box in Adelaide. 
Strangely enough we have LOTS of fat Windows clients running Anzio32 
for terminal access, WYSE60 emulation to be precise...................

&gt;Some kind of small and quiet box with a browser (Mozilla) and perhaps a
&gt;terminal or X server would be more than suitable for some areas.

There is a push in some government departments toward thin clients again.
(way before my time, but wasn't the industry already there before??? :o)
Certainly the Housing Trust have thin clients (or NCs, as the buzzword is)
pretty much across the board) 
Unfortunately theyre all running Windows off Citrix Metaframe, but certainly
I agree in moving back to a thin client architecture.  The only downside is 
that outside of the metro area, WAN infrastructure is woefully inadequate to
support it.

&gt;One of the real barriers (perhaps just an attitude issue) that 
&gt;impacts on
&gt;the Linux desktop taking hold is the Word and Excel document formats.

100% correct.  Which is why we have defaulted all our new W2K machines to 
RTF format in Word.  So far only one person has complained, and we've 
managed to convince them that to talk with the rest of the world RTF is a 
much better format, and besides, we're not going to change ;o)
User perception is a terrible thing, but its the brick wall that OSS is up
against unfortunately.
