Hi.

I have a similar story with an Olympus Camedia C1400L (sold as D600
overseas, go figure) It has a 1.4 megapixel ccd, which was groundbreaking
at the time, but commonplace now. Cost a couple of grand.

I managed to get transfer via the serial port, but the files are a bit
big, and I am a bit impatient, so I bought a pcmcia adapter and a pcmcia
drive for my desktop linux box. A bit of a fiddle and I had an automatic
script that copied files off the pcmcia card and put them on a web page.

The pcmcia adapter also works out of the box on a mac or win2k laptop,
cannot comment about other os's. Low end mac laptops no longer have
pcmcia, but you can get a flash/smartmedia to usb adapter that also works
well for them, don't know if linux works with the usb adapter though.

With the image sizes increasing as they are, I'd be looking (as you are)
for a direct connection between camera and linux. I think the only way for
this to happen is via usb or firewire, but you will probably have a bit of
a task to get things working. The pcmcia route is one that works.

The pcmcia drive I bought came from Microgram computers. They advertise in
most Aussie PC mags. 

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; Any recommendations for a digital camera that:
&gt; &gt;  - works with Linux,
&gt; &gt;  - is available in Adelaide (or Australia at least),
&gt; &gt;  - doesn't cost more than my car,
&gt; &gt;  - doesn't have any proprietary gotchas such as unique memory
&gt; &gt; packs or weird batteries.
&gt; 
&gt; what do you mean "works with linux"?
&gt; I've got an Agfa somethingorother, does 1152x968 (the one that's
&gt; one better than 1024x768?), it cost $330 from Hardly Normal
&gt; (in Sydney not here) and I got $30 back from Agfa (a cashback deal).  
&gt; 
&gt; It's got 1Mb internal memory and a USB connector.
&gt; But I don't use either, instead I got a 40Mb flash card and
&gt; pcmcia adaptor.  The flash card holds 232 images at the max
&gt; resolution and I take it out the camera and stick it into
&gt; the pcmcia converter and into my laptop to get the images
&gt; (it appears as a standard IDE disk with the vfat filesystem).
&gt; 
&gt; A CD of all M$ software came with the camera - I tried it once 
&gt; under win98 on the laptop and it hung the machine, never used it since.
&gt; 
&gt; Toby's right about batteries, this takes 2 AA's and chews through
&gt; them like there's no tomorrow (the camera has no screen too BTW,
&gt; so that probably improves battery life but is a bit of bummer but at 
&gt; the price not surprising - I bought it probably a year ago now).
&gt; I get probably about 30 pics (not using the flash) from new alkaline 
&gt; batteries (not rechargables).  And maybe 5-10 with flash.
&gt; 
&gt; Dave.
