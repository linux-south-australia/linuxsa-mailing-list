&gt; &gt;What I find rather interesting is an article in the latest Linux Journal
&gt; &gt;(Sept 2001) titled, "Password's Progress", which suggests that "A
&gt; &gt;56-character password can be cracked on an average machine using the 2.2
&gt; &gt;Linux kernel within 20 seconds".  And that's using MD5 passwords.

[snip]

&gt; OK, four questions,
&gt; 
&gt; 1: What is their idea of an "average" machine?
&gt; 
&gt; 2: Does this "average" machine reside in Area 51
&gt; 
&gt; 2: Was the 56 character password on line number 40 in a dictionary file they
&gt; were using?
&gt; 
&gt; 3: Are you sure they didn't mean a 5.6 character password?

The answer to the first 2 is "I don't know".  The answer to the second question 
2 :-) is that they didn't say whether the attack was brute force or dictionary 
based, although they did suggest it was against an MD5 hash, so my guess is 
brute force.  And lastly, it was 56, not 5.6 as they mention it twice in the 
article.

/me thinks the editors didn't proof-read before publishing.  MD5 isn't 
unbreakable, but it's almost so.

Shar and Enjoy!
