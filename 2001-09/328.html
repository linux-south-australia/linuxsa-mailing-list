indeed, and I'd like to thank you for your efforts in that direction.

About 4 weeks ago, after years of moaning on mailing lists and to 
friends, I finally sat down and wrote a letter to the ACCC.  It 
was triggered by telstra's announcement of yet more price increases 
on standard PSTN lines but it digressed and was "wide ranging" (as 
Sir Humphrey Appleby would say).  

Funny thing was, about 3 days after I received a reply thanking me 
but basically saying that they are satisfied telstra is meeting their
legal obligations, they announced they would not allow the prices rises.
Not that I think it was due to my letter, but it took me less than 
half an hour to write it, and if no one tells them any different they 
will only have telstra telling them that it's fair and no one minds.

Dave.
