OK, I've got this computer that works, and is kinda cool, but I
don't have a use for it.

Specs:
SGI Indy
IRIX 6.5 (with what I suspect is the standard SGI software, no garantees - 
but has lotsa gnu stuff there)
MIPS R4400SC 100MHz CPU, with 1MB L2 cache (I think) and the
biggest heatsink you ever did see.
64Mb RAM
1 x 4gig SCSI HDD
1 x 0.5gig SCSI HDD
10BaseT and AUI Ethernet + SPARE ETHERNET CARD (firewall anyone???)
17" Monitor (Sony Trinitron Tube)
      note that this has a non-standard connector, so you can't just plug it 
into your PC)
IndyCam (works fine. Manual focus, no zoom. )

Some sort of Graphics capability, but I can't really tell what
the card itself is.

ISDN
External SCSI
Internal sound, with in/out/etc
PS/2 Mouse and PS/2 Keyboard
Basically every I/O thing that was around at the time
No floppy, no CDROM
It's a funky SGI speckled greeny-blue colour, and the peripherals
are speckled grey, but the keyboard is beige for some reason.
Original Box for case, no box for monitor.
No guarantees that anything I said here is correct or working 100%
-- I've had it running, mucked about with it for a few hours, and
haven't noticed any problems... kinda cool,
and I'm sure someone will have an interesting use for it (I
imagine it would be faster under Linux, but I could be wrong).

<A HREF="http://www.exquip.com/silicongraphics/indy.shtml">http://www.exquip.com/silicongraphics/indy.shtml</A> seems to say a
bit about general Indy stuff.

I'm told you can run Linux on it if you mess about a little, but
I haven't tried it.

Make a bid (offlist) :)

Cheers,

Jonathan
