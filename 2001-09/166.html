Just a comment on some aspects..

1.
  1.5 Gb of outbound traffic over the course of a few hours??
  I remember seeing an analysis of CR and CR2, and it should not generate
  that much traffic during the target acquisition stage.

2.
  It destroyed his motherboard and harddrives??
  I *really* doubt this. CR[12] is a software worm; it cannot physically
  damage your HARDware.

3.
  "he didn't have email installed, so it didn't spread to any of his
   contacts."
  It isn't an email-based worm! Email has nothing to do with it. If this
  guy had a local network of other PCs, he should obviously be scanning them
  too.. (if running IIS)


Notes.
  I have seen posts on Bugtraq relating to Windoze installing IIS even when
  it was turned off.. Its considered a prerequisite for other services, so
  if any of them are turned on, IIS gets installed anyway, and turned on.
  Pretty silly if you ask me, but thats MS for ya.

  Congrats on your friend swapping to Linux.. I hope it goes well for him.
  Note, however, that Linux isn't magically secure.. In the past Linux has
  had its share of remote root exploits too. Mind you, its a ****load better
  than Microsoft's history ;)
  Still, I would advise your friend to read up on some security HOWTOs,
  and to get familiar with a good iptables setup.

  If he really does need MS stuff, the trick is to put it behind the Linux
  or {Open|Free}BSD firewall, and make sure you only let things in and out
  that you want.

&gt; My friend has just had his system Code Red'd and it is causing great

&gt; This one is very different to the normal email borne attack. There
&gt; wasn't a logged in connection to the Internet. There wasn't any email
&gt; to run. There wasn't any operator error to run any program.
&gt;
&gt; * He was connected to Telstra cable through his cable box BUT he was
&gt; installing Windows 2000 Server on the machine. The drive he was
&gt; installing on was completely blank. It had just been low-level
&gt; formatted via SCSI card. This happened at 3:30 AM GMT on Monday 3
&gt; September.
&gt; * He was NOT logged onto the cable service.
&gt; * He had especially selected IIS to NOT be installed.
&gt; * Left machine running to complete installations and only had the Admin
&gt; password entered.
&gt; * Came back to machine several hours later and noticed that cable modem
&gt; was going mental.
&gt; * Tried logging into his 2000 Server but was refused 3 times, "Machine
&gt; in use by other user. Only Administrator and user have access (VPN)"
&gt; * Turned machine off. Then on. Logged in straight away.
&gt; * Loaded up their proprietary login software. Could not log into ISP.
&gt; Contacted ISP who suggested it may a virus problem but they insisted
&gt; that he must have been running other software, could not have come
&gt; through them.
&gt; * After installing NAV 2001 he did a Live Update. Then he restarted his
&gt; machine and did a scan which detected Trojan Virtual Root = Code Red II.
&gt;
&gt; So far it has caused over 1.5 G of outgoing traffic through his cable
&gt; account but no emails were installed so it has not gone to any of his
&gt; contacts AFAIK. It has caused failures in mother boards and hard drives
&gt; and he is now trying hard to recover urgently needed software without
&gt; passing on the trojan.
&gt;
&gt; He will be low-level formatting all drives then installing Linux and
&gt; swears to never again use MS products unless required for his work with
&gt; clients.
&gt;
&gt; If we can be hit by these mongrels during an install of MS Software
&gt; what hope do we have that we will be safe from any kind of viral attack.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, and I can verify that all the above events happened in the sequence
&gt; as described.
