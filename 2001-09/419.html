&gt; &gt; If you're installing Solaris 8 for x86, throw the first CD away (the

yep!

&gt; &gt;  This will allow you to
&gt; &gt; create the partitions you like (I've done so one a 2GB disk) and allow you
&gt; &gt; to select other packages like PCMCIA support, which only seems to install
&gt; &gt; itself when you don't want it.
&gt; 
&gt; heh -- ok, I'll try that next time... this time, I managed to get it all
&gt; right by re-installing about ten times... the fdisk is the most stupid
&gt; fdisk in the world, and by default creates overlapping partitions (by 1
&gt; cylinder...)... I just created a partition that had plenty of margin on
&gt; each side, and all worked ok...

hey?  you're not referring to slice 2 - the overlap are you?
if you mean multiple fdisk partitions on the one disk, rather
than multiple solaris slices, then I've no experience, i've
always only done the whole disk as solaris.
 
&gt; interesting... we have used Xi before, but would rather keep away from
&gt; it... I'm still bitter about the infernal stupidity of Solaris, especially
&gt; the installer, especially on x86 and especially on laptops... Surely
&gt; someone can make a SPARC laptop (perhaps a crusoe-based one... maybe a
&gt; microcode change to a crusoe vaio... :)

a sparc laptop would be very nice!!

I've never installed solaris on a laptop but have on plenty of
sparc and "normal" x86 stuff.  The installer has always worked
fine for me (mind you I do it the "old way" - not the new web
start way, and I've never setup xwindows on anything other than
sparc machines).  And as for "infernal stupidity of Solaris" - I 
hate to say it, but solaris makes more sense to me than linux.
I suspect it's one of those how used to it you are things, and
solaris isn't, and has never pretended to be, an OS for the
non-familiar (I was going to say "newbie" there but it makes it
sound a bit derogatory!).

And re where to go for solaris help, don't forget sunsolve,
(<A HREF="http://sunsolve.sun.com">http://sunsolve.sun.com</A>) you can even get a login free
(which gives you more access).

and while I'm mentioning web sites: 
www.sunfreeware.com
www.sunhelp.org
www.sunshack.org
www.sunrk.com.au
www.stokely.com (general sysadmin and sun stuff)
