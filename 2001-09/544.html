&gt; &gt; Can I plug my digital video camera into the firewire card in the computer,
&gt; &gt; download the video off the DV tape, edit it, and save the results out to
&gt; &gt; an MPEG encoder?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can do this under Linux.
&gt;
&gt; I'm interested to know what "editing" software you use. The only decent
&gt; stuff that I've used is Premier (to an extent) and Final Cut Pro, both
&gt; on Mac.

Broadcast, MainActor, Kino

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I can't do this under Windoze 98lite.
&gt;
&gt; There's a "lite" version of Windows 98? There's a machine here that's
&gt; used for video editing that runs Windows 98.

See www.98lite.net I think for more information. I refuse to use a stock
standard "98bloat" ever again.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't know if i can do this under FreeBSD.
&gt; &gt; I don't know if i can do this under OpenBSD.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From searching through <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">http://www.freebsd.org/</A> (Hint, Hint), I wasn't
&gt; able to find much.

That main catch is the requirement for large files (a LOT bigger than 2/4
Gb), high speed diskaccess, and digital-video-over-firewire support.

Its the latter that wasn't available on freebsd last time i checked -- but
that was quite a while ago. Windows support is also pretty bad.. I couldn't
get it to work at all. A friend managed to get it to work on a later version
of windows, but couldn't get it to download more than a few minutes at a
time before crashing windows.
Linux worked fine first try. What more can i say? ;)

&gt;
&gt; That said, I've always taken my video editing to machines that do that
&gt; well, for example, the iMac.
&gt;
&gt; They do it a lot better than a PC, if you ask me. iMovie, while in many
&gt; respects is quite primitive, is satisfactory for most things.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure about OpenBSD -- I gave up on it (seemingly) a long time a
&gt; go.

That's OK, its mission is totally different anyway. its aiming to be a
secure minimalist server o/s, not a comprehensive video editting and
rendering farm platform.
