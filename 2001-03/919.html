&gt;What is it with you and the whole 'ISP owner' camp?

We're passionate about what we do, because we try, really really 
hard, to do it well.

&gt;
&gt;Are you afraid of something?  Hiding something?  Why
&gt;are you attacking us and forgetting that we have
&gt;listened to you and changed our position?

No, No, and we're not attacking you, we're defending against your 
continual allegations of 'conspiracy theory'

&gt;Most people are going through Telstra anyhow.  I have
&gt;spoken to many people who use Telstra and they have
&gt;not had any troubles when the devil posesses them and
&gt;they go on a leaching rampage for a night.

Oh, now we're on the 'Telstra are a shining light' argument.

Can't win against that one. Bugger, lets all close our businesses and 
lay down in front of Telstra.

Sorry, I hadn't realised I wasn't worthy of being ignored just 
because I care more about you than Telstra does - I hadn't realised 
that what I needed to do was care -less-, and charge like a wounded 
bull, and make more profits than any other company (in any sector) in 
the history of this country.

Darn, I hadn't realised that everything I'd say would be so pointless. Shit.

&gt;If this is the level of fear and hostility that I would
&gt;recieve from a local ISP when I ask questions or make
&gt;suggestions - why should I support a local ISP?

Because we care, and Telstra does not.

If you like dealing with a less responsive organisation, who charges 
more, has no capability to listen to your needs or engage you in a 
conversation about them, who never innovates and in fact always 
releases new offerings two years behind the rest of the market, sure, 
go with Telstra.

Have a nice life. I'm sorry, but I plan to keep innovating. So shoot me.

&gt;
&gt;I would have thought - unless there is some sort of
&gt;status quo that you need to protect - that you would
&gt;have supported us if we came up with ideas that can
&gt;lower costs for ISPs and we were trying to help you as
&gt;well as ourselves.

But that idea doesn't lower costs for ISP's, Ian, it *raises them*. 
That is what you seem to be missing.

ISP's already run caches. Today they use them to lower the average 
cost per MB for all customers, which is a simple, relatively fair, 
and relatively equitable mechanism which leads to few, if any, 
arguments.

What you are proposing is complex, hard to bill, hard to prove to a 
customer in terms of billing correctness, and has zero, nada, zip, 
effect on the total costs for the ISP, other than to raise them due 
to the added complexity of the technical systems that the ISP would 
need to invent in order to satisfy your suggestion.

Please, be clear that the suggestion you've made is a reasonable one, 
entirely reasonable, at face value. But if you think it through, and 
ask the advice of experts, the outcome is that the notion doesn't 
actually help in the long term, and has a total cost of 
implementation that would materially _raise_ the average customer 
bill, not lower it.

Or to put it in terms you might relate to, given your comments above 
- Telstra don't do it, so we shouldn't, right? After all, they're the 
people that nobody has any troubles with, right?

[BTW, if you believe that, you're not reading the papers or talking 
to people who actually rely on Telstra for mission critical needs]
