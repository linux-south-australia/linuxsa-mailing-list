Stephen,

&gt; Telstra won't support Linux and use the Alcatel (or close) modem.  Has
&gt; anyone actually managed to get one of these beasts to work in Linux?
&gt; How did you do it, did you have DSL installed on the M$ 
&gt; machine and then
&gt; (after they left) remove it and put it in the Linux box?

Basically YES on both counts. The installer (Skilled Communications
in my case) has a requirement to test and make sure that the link
was up and working correctly and giving you the right throughput.

So for me it was as easy as letting him set up the link on my M$ box
and then just moving it across to my Linux machine.

As far as installation goes it was VERY easy. I run RH 7.0. I
installed a second Ethernet card and plugged the Ethernet lead
into the card. Configured the card to come up at boot. Installed
the pppoe.rpm package that comes with RH7 and changed the necessary
information in the pppoe.conf file and away it went.

I then went on to getting a basic firewall which I HIGHLY recommend.
A reasonably complete and easy to configure script can be found here
<A HREF="http://jsmoriss.mvlan.net/linux/rcf.html">http://jsmoriss.mvlan.net/linux/rcf.html</A>

Telstra's attitude towards Linux in my experience has been
"We don't support it. But if you use it on our ADSL service don't call
us when it breaks"
The installed said to me during the install "What you do with it once
I have left is up to you"

&gt; Real live accounts of skullduggery and subterfuge welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; The paranoid may post anonymously :-).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Steve

Cheers

Matt...
