<H1>Fwd: [SAIA-C] Update re SA Net censorship Bill</H1>

[This message is a standard one sent to a number of people and
organisations who've been in contact with me/EFA re this Bill. It's also
been sent to public lists (that afaik you're not on) so feel free to
distribute further as appropriate if you wish.]

The SA Net censorship Bill was not debated by the SA Legislative Council in
the week ending Friday 16 March. The LC's next sittings commence Tues 27
March.

Hence, if you have not already done so, it is not too late to express your
views to politicians. Contact details for key politicians and links to
electorate representatives' details are available at:

The SA Attorney-General's office issued a Q&A document on 14 March to
people who wrote to the A-G expressing their concerns about the Bill. EFA
has written to the A-G regarding a number of statements made in the Q&A. A
copy of our letter faxed today is available at:
<A HREF="http://www.efa.org.au/Publish/saag010319.html">http://www.efa.org.au/Publish/saag010319.html</A>

Among other things, we note:

- The statement in the document that online publishers "can have the
proposed material classified before making it available online" is wrong
according to advice provided to EFA by representatives of both the OFLC and
the ABA on 16 March 2001. 

- Of the four films referred to in the document as examples of adult themed
material that can be accommodated at MA or lower, two of the films were
classified R by the national Classification Board and only became MA after
costly appeal to the Review Board. Further, 60% of a panel of Adelaide
residents, who classified one of the films when participating in OFLC
research, gave the film a lower classification (MA) than did the
Classification Board (R). These South Australians would have committed an
offence under the proposed SA legislation if they had made the material
available online based on their assessment of the classification.  

- The reason that the provision for a "defendant to sign a form agreeing
that the material is X or is RC", does not apply to material alleged to be
R is evidently because drafters of the proposed legislation consider it is
not "fairly clear" what type of material would be classified R according to
the Second Reading Speech. 

- Since what would be classified R is not "fairly clear", defendants will
have no choice but to pay a classification fee if material is determined by
the OFLC to be R. However, the Commonwealth has not prescribed fees for
classification of Internet according to the Commonwealth Classification
(Publications, Films and Computer Games) Regulations. To charge a defendant
the current minimum fee of $770 for a 'film' of 15 minutes running time
would be unfair since a web page of text does not have a "running time" and
the fee for an entire printed magazine is $130. Prior to the SA Bill coming
into effect, classification fees for Internet content should be determined.
- Although the document states that "As long as [R material] is protected
by an approved system, there is no offence", the SA Bill clearly states
that it is an offence whether or not the material is protected by an
approved restricted access system. Furthermore, the Bill reverses the onus
of proof, requiring online publishers to prove that access was subject to a
restricted access system, rather than requiring the prosecution to prove it
was not.  

- The view expressed in the document that "there should be no restriction
of educational, scientific or professional discussion" indicates a
misunderstanding of existing classification laws and the reason that
Internet content that consists of text is being classified as a 'film'.
Furthermore, the OFLC classifies educational articles in magazines
unsuitable for children, for example, an article on cosmetic surgery in
January 2001.  

- The document states: "The best indication [that the legislation will not
have a 'chilling effect'] is the fact that the existing laws in WA,
Victoria and the NT do not seem to have had any effect of this kind."

Freedom of expression is chilled when people do not say what they would
otherwise say because of fear of prosecution. It is not possible to know
how many people in the above jurisdictions have been silenced by the
introduction of criminal penalties applicable to speech. 

The effect of existing laws in other jurisdictions is not a good indication
of the potential effect of the proposed SA laws. Firstly, police in other
jurisdictions may be more inclined to devote their time and resources to
investigation, tracking down and prosecution of perpetrators of serious
crimes that unquestionably harm members of the community such as child
abuse, murder, rape, theft and so on. Evidently however police in South
Australia have time and consider it a priority to spend time seeking out
unnamed publications in bookshops and appealing classifications of the
national Classification Board. Secondly, other jurisdictions have not made
it a criminal offence to make available to adults information unsuitable
for minors. South Australia will be the first.
