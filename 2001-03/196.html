We have installed Mandrake 7.2 in Adelaide TAFE classrooms because of the ReiserFS
system.  The institute *powers down* the classes at 10pm regardless, poof, crash and
bang there is always a blue screen win 2000 puter somewhere, just different one each
morning  ;-)  The MD linux has been working fine each morning :-) So they have been
crashed out each day now for about 5 weeks with no probs.

BTW ReiserFS does not support quota settings last I looked, but it sure does rock in
my books.  Suse has it too as an option, Redhat does not.

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; Disclaimer: I'm no expert, others here are, and I think you've been told
&gt; before, but anyway:
&gt;
&gt; 1. I would have thought that your firewall was not your server. If you
&gt; have 5 computers there, one should be the firewall, and do virtually
&gt; nuffin else. There are many ways to achieve this, and filesystem damage
&gt; should not be a big risk - you could use one of the router distro's and
&gt; boot it from a floppy. Run no fans or HD's on the box (or monitor) and it
&gt; would run for hours on a small ups.
&gt;
&gt; 2. Keep all the logfiles on your server, using remote syslog to get them
&gt; there from all the 'at risk from etsa' boxen, and the firewall.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Put a larger ups on the server (or 2) - some of the ups can be extended
&gt; with bigger batteries - you could extend the life to a couple of hours
&gt; without a huge amount of trouble.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Go ahead, reiser the whole lot if you are game.
&gt;
&gt; This way, you should lower the risk to your data from security breaches
&gt; and power glitches. The remote syslog will tell you exactly what was
&gt; happening when the power went out because your server will still be up.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "Tony Gunthorp at VA Linux showed me something very impressive: he killed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the power on his Linux laptop (without doing a clean shutdown - blasphemy!)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and when rebooting the filesystem rebuilt itself within seconds with zero
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; errors. The reboot skipped right past fsck.ext2,"
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Has anyone on the list tried this? (the URL above has lots of tips and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caveats, but is about 12 months old, so no doubt things have moved along a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. It works very well. I haven't tried it on a 2.4 kernel, but 2.2
&gt; &gt; &gt; works very well (our mail servers, file servers and soon our proxy
&gt; &gt; &gt; server all enjoy reiserfs partitions).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Great. I had been thinking that thie reiserfs was too experimental to
&gt; &gt; use for all partitions.
&gt; &gt; Is it available in SuSE installation scripts as an option alongside
&gt; &gt; ext2fs? If so, it seems like ext2fs will eventually be replaced by reiserfs,
&gt; &gt; unless there's something lacking in reiserfs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So my plan now is to get a UPS, get an old Pentium, install a brand new OS
&gt; &gt; (with 2.4.0 kernel), set up all the firewall/server stuff.
&gt; &gt; And then I have two lines of defence: the UPS _and_ the file system.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But then what do I do with the other 5 computers?
&gt; &gt; I guess they're less at risk because they don't continuously generate
&gt; &gt; log files.
&gt; &gt; It seems to be only the files which are currently open for writing
&gt; &gt; which are candidates for very nasty destruction when the power goes off.
&gt; &gt; And a firewall/server (mine at least) has dozens of such log files.
&gt; &gt; So probably I'll be fairly safe if I just defend the
&gt; &gt; gateway=firewall+server computer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, now it's time to go out and get a UPS.
&gt; &gt; Jaycar don't have them anymore in Adealide, by the way....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
