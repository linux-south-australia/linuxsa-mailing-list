This is where I can relate this flame war to Linux - this is something we should ALL care about and few of us seem to be paying serious attention to this.  Why are public institutions investing so much money in to propriatry infrastructure when there are cheaper and more reliable alernatives such as Linux - is it a cost or marketing issue?

For example - if I want to convince a business that an x-server server based desktop solution is the way to go to avoid upgrading obsolete desktop hardware - what is the correct approach - is this technically and financially feasible?

What advantage is their to having the applications on one mega server and using existing desktop machines running the x server only (ie - as thin clients).

I know the Polish parliament are doing this - but if someone can give me their honest opinion and play the devils advocate I would appreciate it.

However, the first obvious question is 'is it MS compatible?' and 'what end user training is required'?

One thing is that if security and reliability are ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL then is this solution preferable to Windows 2000?
