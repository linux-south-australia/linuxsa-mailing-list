&gt; because they are not as common or easy to deal with as line wrapping. Line
&gt; wrapping is prety trivial.

Well, yes, you'd think so.  But Brian wrote:

You'd expect to quote it like this:

&gt; Is this the list silly season?  Why not ... "Surely mail readers should be able
&gt; to cope with HTML"  "Surely mail readers should be able to cope with Cyrillic
&gt; script"  "Surely mail readers should be able to cope with  anything my mail
&gt; reader can cope with"  etc ... etc ..

Now admittedly, this makes the first line 81 characters long, probably
too much.  So you might consider reformatting the paragraph to shorten
the resultant lines:

&gt; Is this the list silly season?  Why not ... "Surely mail readers
&gt; should be able to cope with HTML" "Surely mail readers should be
&gt; able to cope with Cyrillic script" "Surely mail readers should be
&gt; able to cope with anything my mail reader can cope with" etc ... etc
&gt; ..

In fact, what your MUA (X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook IMO, Build
9.0.2416 (9.0.2910.0)) does is:

&gt; Is this the list silly season?  Why not ... "Surely mail readers
&gt; should be able
&gt; to cope with HTML"  "Surely mail readers should be able to cope
&gt; with Cyrillic
&gt; script"  "Surely mail readers should be able to cope with
&gt; anything my mail
&gt; reader can cope with"  etc ... etc ..

I don't think anybody can consider this correct.

&gt; HTML is not.

I hate HTML for general purpose mail, but there are times when it can
be useful.  The big issue I have with it is that it's difficult to
create a dialogue of the nature of this message, where we have clearly
identified messages from three different people.  I fear we're going
to have to learn to use it, though.

&gt; Cyrillic is but is not common.

That's a geographical issue.  A related one is that if you receive a
message in Cyrillic and are able to display it correctly, you will
probably still have problems understanding it.

&gt;&gt; Why you have suggested that this rule should not apply to e-mail
&gt;&gt; is beyond me.
&gt;&gt; Double standards, perhaps?

Ah, dammit...

&gt;&gt; Why you have suggested that this rule should not apply to e-mail is
&gt;&gt; beyond me.  Double standards, perhaps?
&gt;
&gt; maybe. I don't know.
&gt;
&gt; But anyway -- maybe I should have reworded my original as "surely there
&gt; aren't any mail readers out there that can't deal with wrapping their own
&gt; text." Are there?

You appear to be using one.

&gt; what mail reader do you use?

Why ask?  It tells you in the headers:

  X-Mailer: KMail [version 1.0.29]

&gt; Also, is there an appropriate time to change the standard format for
&gt; email?  Given that it seems that there is an increasing tide of mail
&gt; clients that do not conform to this standard, it seems to be to be a
&gt; wise time to expand this stnadard (is it actually a standard, or
&gt; just a defacto standard?) to include what they produce. I personally
&gt; wouldn't use a client that doesn't read HTML simply because I
&gt; receive too much HTML mail from people. Ditto with
&gt; line-wrapping. Yes, receiving these emails still irritates me a
&gt; little, but I deal with it. It's like the reason I tend to use
&gt; recent versions of IE or Netscape over older versions or lynx --
&gt; more sites are written to work in them... It's about defacto
&gt; standards... I do object somewhat to getting .doc format mail, but
&gt; again, I have to deal with it becuase I receive it all the time.

Obviously there's going to be a time when mail formats change.  I'm
not opposed to change, as long as the new formats are usable.  But
everything I've seen from Microsoft appears to be broken, and your own
messages are an excellent example.
