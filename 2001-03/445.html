 &gt; &gt; The only difference between a 64k VOICE call carrying G.711 encoded

 &gt; 
 &gt; Does this mean that Telstra doesn't care?
 
Pretty much, yes.  DoV is a way for Telstra to avoid looking totally 
stupid in a marketplace in which they'll charge $90 per month for 
1.5 Mbps via ADSL, or $300 per month for 64kbps via ISDN.

 &gt; Does telstra care about this? I mean it would seem that they would not
 &gt; be capitalising on the marcket, and maybe even see it as loosing money.
 
There's a big difference between "losing money" and "not gaining as
much money".  Even at DoV prices, Telstra will still be making a
healthy profit on ISDN.

For what it's worth, the infrastructure they need to provide to
support a 64k ISDN circuit is less than what they need to provide to
support a POTS voice line -- So why is ISDN more expensive?

Whenever you make a voice phone call, that call is carried on 64kbps
of reserved bandwidth through Telstra's core -- Just like an ISDN call.
It might help to put things in perspective if you think of your voice
phone line as an ISDN line with an A-to-D convertor on it, because that's
pretty close to the only difference between POTS and ISDN.

 &gt; About packet loss:
 &gt; from South America, the routing is incredible:

You're surprised? :-)

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
