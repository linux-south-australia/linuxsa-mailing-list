&gt; Jake!
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So windows ships with no source and linux stuff does. Big 
&gt; &gt; deal. Alot of people dont look into the source when they compile
&gt; &gt; it, Jeremy didn't and he fork-bombed his machine.
&gt; 
&gt; He had access to the source. If he'd done some research, he could
&gt; have predicted what would have happened. That's something you
&gt; (mostly) can never do in Windows...that Jeremy was, as an
&gt; individual or class of individuals, a "silly widdle boi" is
&gt; beside the point...

You're one of those stereotyping people, aren't you.  We don't take
kindly to your type around here.
