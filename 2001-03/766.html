Jeremy, can you be a little bit more explicit?  What does it do?

What it *should* do, on a correct system configured with no per-user
process limit, is use up all available process slots, thus no new process
can be created.  Most system processes need to create new processes to
do useful work, and they won't be able to.  Cron jobs wont get run.
Mail wont get received or sent.  Getty *will* be able to exec login,
which will be able to exec your shell, but the processes that you try
to run in /etc/profile won't execute.  When a shell exits init won't be
able to fork a new process.

This program should also keep the kernel busy, since each created process
is a tight loop invoking a system call that will mostly fail.  The system
will have a few tens of "real" processes competing with hundreds of these
forking processes, and thus the forking processes will swamp the system,
starving it of available CPU time.

Keypresses should get echoed to the screen, but note that the system
may be so CPU starved that the echo takes a long time to appear.

In short, a correctly working unix system, configured with no per-user
process and CPU time limits will appear to stop.  This is not a bug;
it's an intentional feature.

Is that what happens?  Does the system panic or does it "lock up"?
