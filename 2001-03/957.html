&gt; Yes what does it say? That if you pay $110 per annum to join auug you
&gt; better already know what the hell you are talkng about if you post,and if
&gt; you dont you bettter be ready to be heckled?

You know better than to encourage such ideas.  I am not AUUG.  I am not
even typical of AUUG's management.  What I say, unless I say it using
one of my AUUG identities, is personal opinion.

To try to attach *my* ideas on to a third party is vile and petty
politicking.


&gt; Does it say that a free or compatritvely low cost organisation such as
&gt; linuxsa can do just as well as auug with a lot more understanding

My post was as a linuxsa member, to the linuxsa list.  Aside from the
overt message that the original idea was crap, which it was, my message
could carry the covert idea that if you post crap to the list you'll
get called up on it.

Please observe that what I said has been indepepdantly verified.
This debate surely isn't about the veracity of what I said.  So who
amongst us thinks we shouldn't call crap crap?  How many times must we
suffer the same crap before we start calling it crap?  I reckon some of
us will say "me, and forever."  I reckon some will also say otherwise.


&gt; That sort of behaviour only reinforces a (not necesarily well founded) 
&gt; perception I think some linuxsa members have that auug is a bit elitiest
&gt; and not necesarily interested in beginner or trival problems.

I'm an Australian before an AUUG member.  Reductio absurdum: "That sort
of behaviour only reinforces a perception that Australian's are a bit
elitiest [sic]"
