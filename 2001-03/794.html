Being the self declared out and proud bandwidth consuming unsreasonably demanding leacher that I am - I would not have a problem with this.  I would never have a problem paying access fees to a cache or news server, etc, that is managed well.

Unless these copyright laws come in to place and then we are back to square one.  I will resist the temptation to start another flame war (over copyright)- so relax there people!

But seriously - this is what I mean.  Why am I being derided and flamed and all sorts of things when I only expect value for money?  I could not give a damn how it is achieved - cached or not - it makes no difference to me and other leachers.  The real enemy are those that are trying to pass through copright protection laws that prevent caching while we are busy flaming each other.  How can this be called 'rational', 'realistic' or a 'justified business model'?  If these laws go through, Internode as well us leachers are screwed.  Are leachers the enemy?
