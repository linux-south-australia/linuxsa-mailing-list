Might I point out that I sent the quoted message (the parts with two
greater than signs) to Wayne without copying them to the list.

&gt; So. The general idea of Michael letting other users know about what "w1" can
&gt; possibly do for them was thoughful

Well, actually, let me give all users advice. To determine what your
modem understands and is capable of, take the following steps:

1) Consult its manual
 - if you've lost the paper one, or it isn't specific enough, then try
looking it up via the manufacturer's web-site or use a search engine

2) Read it

3) Use minicom (man minicom)
 - test commands you are interested in

&gt; list are glad he posted it. So are you saying, that before anyone posts a
&gt; message or idea to this list they must be 100%  correct, or they will be
&gt; spoken upon like dirt. ?, so much for new users trying to help out other new
&gt; users.

I said that David Newall was correct. I don't want to sound
argumentative, but do I need to belabour that point?

&gt; I sure David N has been helpful. From one Unix Expert to another which is
&gt; rather sweet, but what about from one expert to a newbie who nows nothing.

I'd hardly call the originator of this post a "newbie". He seems to have
managed to set up a reasonable system and know how to work with it.

&gt; Hey, at least Microsoft Support treat a user kindly, even though their
&gt; support has a lot to desire.

If you pay me $100 or more per hour to listen to "newbie" questions - or
for that matter check "newbie" advice for correctness - then I assure
you I'll be very nice to you. Polite even. If you ask me an unresearched
"newbie" question, or it appears you haven't tried looking up your
HOWTO's, man pages or posted it to me in HTML then I might not be quite
so disposed to answer the question.

Mostly, though, you'll find within my replies an answer.

&gt; not to beat around the bush. But there is absolutley no reason for any kind
&gt; of conviction.

Oh? I suggest you look up conviction in the dictionary, and restate that
sentence once the meaning is clear. I don't apologise and won't
apologise for believing in what I say.

&gt; Just because one user, who has a small amount of knowledge
&gt; tries to help and offer suggestions to another, gives no justification for
&gt; "experts" to accuse a helper of being a bloody idiot if they are not 100%
&gt; correct.

Out of context that one is particularly difficult to take apart. Within
context, in my opinion, the original poster could probably have been
more helpful...

&gt; &gt; Oh, did I mention that I put together the documentation for the
&gt; &gt; InstallFest last year and I'm involved in the organisation of the
&gt; &gt; InstallFest this year?
&gt; 
&gt; You don't need to, I saw you name on the web page. by the way,
&gt; what was the documentation ?

It was handed out at the front desk. It's probably lurking on LinuxSA's
servers somewhere still.

&gt; By superior I mean that you feel that the average linux user or newbie, are
&gt; sensless in the way that we try and help other to-be linux users, and that
&gt; we should be 100% correct before offering to help a struggling user.

Putting that back into context, I'm not sure whether Michael intended to
help a single, particular struggling user. Nor was he a struggling user
- he was the person offering help. And he wasn't quite correct. That's
life. I tender that if one says something on LinuxSA and is not 100%
correct then you'll know about it. Sometimes you'll know about it in
uncertain terms.

Each mailing list has its own flavour; it's best to lurk and listen to
see what it's like.

Might I remind you that I've been the subject of many flames because
what I've said has either not been 100 (or more) per cent correct, or
I've been misunderstood?

&gt; feel superior because you think you have the knowledge to be correct every
&gt; time you aid some one with their problem. If you where broad minded you
&gt; would not make people feel the way you do with your replies.

When I help someone with a problem, I try to give them an understanding
of what they've done wrong and the concepts behind it. I'm not what one
might call a "benevolent teacher" and you might not like what I say. If
I think what you (not you personally, someone in general) have done is
stupid, then I'll say so. But I rarely leave that without explanation.

&gt; I was never after any points in the first place, I just don't see the
&gt; benefit of raming it down someone's throat if they are not 100% correct.

Let's try not correct at all.

&gt; You said "what they beleive in", so you really believe that giving someone a
&gt; hard time, (when all they are trying to do is let others know what they
&gt; otherwise wouldn't, about a small mistake or mis-wording), is going to
&gt; benefit us all.

You accused one of us of not encouraging or helping Linux users. You
might note that I've not even commented at all on the tone that the
other David wrote the original message that sparked this, let us say,
discussion. I believe, or "beleive" as you have put it (1) that
misleading statements are, well, misleading statements. Incidentally,
the sky is blue too (2).

&gt; Maybe when someone is wrong, users correcting them can be a little more
&gt; suttle about it and not so accusing!

Maybe so.

(1) It's a joke :-P

(2) What more can I say? Perhaps we shouldn't correct a misleading or
incorrect statement. That might be someone else's opinion, but it's not
mine.
