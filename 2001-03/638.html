&gt; She is clearly quite proud of their network although she emphasized that owing
&gt; to an emphasis on quality rather than quantity (they use Cisco and not those 
&gt; infuriating NT setups at Primus, Telstra, etc) some people may be be put off 
&gt; by their prices.

Sales people like to brag, it's there job. I'm not sure that their
network is that spiffy. We're a client of Connect.com with a 10Mbit
link. The service and support that we've received from Connect has been
truely deplorable. They've done some really stupid things to our link.
Personally, I'm not that thrilled with them. They also seem to be
constantly having problems with their proxy servers in Melbourne and
Sydney, and their routers (maybe only the one that we're connected to)
seem to doing funny things.

&gt; She quoted me $89 for a 256Mbit connection (64Mbit upstream) plus around $200
&gt; installation which does not sound that expensive to me considering they use
&gt; Cisco from top to bottom.

256Mbit? I'll have 10 at that price. I assume you meant Kbit? Are they
using that Cisco 800 series [1] router at the client end? When I last
rang Cisco, they were having trouble getting it certified by whoever
Austel are now.

&gt; They are focussing on business clients although they are happy to take on 
&gt; residential clients if ADSL is available in that persons area.

That has always been their strategy, I believe. One look at their dialup
rates and you'll see why. Connect are better than your average bear,
when it comes to ISPs, but they're not the bees Knees. (Although their
sales team will, of course, try to tell you otherwise).

&gt; ADSL will not be available until the end of next month (April) but I suspect 
&gt; that this will be worth waiting for.  She gave me the impression that they take
&gt; their network maintanence quite seriously and hence their focus on commercial
&gt; customers.

Connect were meant to be releasing ADSL early February. In fairness,
Telstra have been giving other ISPs a hard time.

Make sure you checkout your options before commiting to one ISP. I'm not
saying to stay away from Connect, because they do seem to have a decent
reputation, and the service (when it works) is reasonable.

FYI, I believe that Connect is now owned by NZ Telecom. They bought
AAPT, and I think that they swollowed Connnect directly, rather than
through AAPT. Result now is (from my information) that Connect.com is a
subsidery of NZ Telecom.
