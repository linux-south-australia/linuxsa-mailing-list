&gt; Yes, I am aware that ISP's pay for bandwidth, as far as i've learnt, on
&gt; average 8cents per mb, or on high usage, often unlimited.

Most ISP's are using unlimited pipes right now, you can call up UUNET
and they'll happily sell you a 1 Meg pipe for $14000/month (I think the
pricing might even be a bit better now). This will allow just 20 modem
users to download flat out simultaneously. 20 x $21.95 = $439 .. how do
you think they're doing it?

&gt; To begin with, at home, I use an Ihug Ultra Satellite package, paying
&gt; approximately $60 per month. I am allowed to connect for 300 hours per
&gt; month, unlimited downloads. This satellite operates with 33k uplink analogue
&gt; modem uplink, and a 400k sat inbound. This does have the trouble of a little
&gt; bit of latency, but other than that, it's great. I run it on my linux box,
&gt; masquerade it over my network at home and I can get download speeds of near
&gt; 90kilo BYTES per second, of course using a simultaneous downloading utlity
&gt; such as download accellerator. I have been on average downloading up to 20
&gt; gig per month ... no problems ... in which way am I deluding myself my
&gt; wishing to pay more than this for essentially a similar deal, only a little
&gt; faster ?

According to IHUG, there is now a 2 Gig Cap on this service.. hardly
unlimited. There's also several complaints to the ACCC about them since
they're not honouring the original "Unlimited downloads" contract many
people signed up for, yet forcing them to pay out the full duration for
a service they don't want. Also, a "little but of latency" is probably
going to be 400-500ms, at least 4x what a modem connection can get let
alone a digital service. They also have to pay for Satellite time to
deliver this to you, and it's nowhere near $60/400Kbits.
 
&gt; Since ISP's do pay for bandwidth, many ISP owners feel the best way to run
&gt; their business is to pass that cost onto the customer, rather than factor
&gt; the cost into the product, and aim for higher volume for offering customers
&gt; a better offer ... this can often show in many small isp's, many of which
&gt; who have existed longer than most in business, but never really grown much
&gt; larger ....

Honest businesses pass the cost onto the customer. Otherwise there are
either hidden costs, or some customers are paying more than they have
to. Clearly it doesn't bother you that other customers are paying for
your 20Gb of downloads per month by not downloading the same amount
themselves.
 
&gt; I am also aware that there aren't many, if not any, local ISP's who offer
&gt; unlimited bandwidth for similar deals as the "big" companies such as $24.95
&gt; per month unlimited etc. I in all ways will recommend to friends / clients
&gt; etc to use the services of Local ISP's to help keep business in SA, and to
&gt; assist the preventions of monopolies in the big companies. However, when it
&gt; comes to myself, I KNOW BETTER. I have done research, it is possible for me

So you advise others to keep business in SA, while doing the opposite
yourself?

&gt; to obtain unlimited bandwidth from big ISP's for my use. Primus offer
&gt; 1.5MBPS ADSL $120 per month or so unlimited bandwidth for residential use
&gt; ... I think I would be deluding myself for saying sorry, no, I'd rather
&gt; purchase ISDN from another provider, re-badged as "DSL" and pay shit loads
&gt; for bandwidth ????

What do you mean by shitloads? Most people we sell lots of bandwidth to
find it very reasonably priced. Even 19c to transmit 1 Megabyte, enough
to zip up the bible onto, from one side of the earth to the other,
strikes me as a pretty good deal when you're not comparing it to ISP
charges. You youngsters have it too easy :)
 
&gt; I know John, you have a certain obligation to your employer to push "pay for
&gt; bandwidth", but really it is this thinking which is holding back Internet in
&gt; this country (... don't you even use the Ihug dish yourself ??). With some

We stopped using IHUG. Not cost effective when you need to buy real
bandwidth instead of 'borrowed' bandwidth. They also do their
wholesaling in US dollars which isn't very attractive right now. If it
was cost-effective to sell unlimited download accounts to customers
without lying about it or degrading the service, we'd do it tomorrow
(ok, the next working day).

I don't know anyone locally who is holding back the industry with this
thinking, and I certainly don't have any obligation to anyone other than
myself to push a certain model. On the contrary, companies losing money
hand-over-fist and offering crappy service by promoting unlimited
downloads are damaging the reputation of the industry.

&gt; intelligent restructuring, I'm sure that even the smaller local ISP's who
&gt; use peering networks, caches, and have multi-hommed links to the net, would
&gt; be able to push for volume sales and offer unlimited bandwidth to their
&gt; clients, without significant loss to the ISP owner.

It's simply dishonest to sell a service that you know you can't deliver.
Unlimited downloads at full speed is such a service when it's priced at
less than it really costs. It only works when a large majority of
customers choose not to download all the time so that people like
yourself can.
 
&gt; I have checked out www.southerncrosscables.com looking for figures and I
&gt; cannot see anything showing such prices as you have quoted in your email ?

They don't put the prices on their web site. Ask them to send you a PDF
or printed brochure.
 
&gt; In no way I do not mean any offense my this email, nor do I wish to detract
&gt; from your business, only I do not appreciate being insulted on a public
&gt; mailing list.

It wasn't directed at you specifically, sorry about not making that
clearer. I just don't like the "we deserve unlimited downloads" crowd
and those who take advantage of customers by pretending to supply it.
