Actually I've decided to expand on my comments re how this list operates.

I personally know three people who after learning more about Linux, made some
requests for help.  (last year) and were told RTFM.  Some of us recall that SAGA
with lots of I have RTFM'd before I asked for help.

So what David if it has been said before, are we going to tell new linux people,
"this has all been said before", how on earth will *they know*  My response to
David was one of *tone the rhetoric down, as it does nothing for new people  his
reply could well have made the same point without the attitude. I believe that
this mailing list has reached a stage where we have enough people that sometimes
we have heard it all before.  This does not and should not then mean we get short
with people.

At some time in the future we should set some guidelines for mailing and
responding to this list. Frankly some people do themselves a disservice in the
way they respond to posts or suggestions.

I reckon its time for LinuxSA to recognise that it has grown to a size now that
it should develop some policies and guidlines for users and it's future?

&gt; &gt; David's diplomacy is quite unique here
&gt;
&gt; No. It's not unique. I'm just as diplomatic, and just as truthful.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; maybe that's why AUUG has went from
&gt; &gt; strength to strength with such encouragement for people to post here.
&gt;
&gt; One of the arguments for not incorporating LinuxSA is people wouldn't
&gt; pay to be a member. What does this say about LinuxSA? People pay $110
&gt; per year to be a member of AUUG...s
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Your response to Michael's post was bullshit, and your a Council Member for
&gt; &gt; AUUG!!!  Sheesh
&gt;
&gt; It was true. Look up the archives of this list and Mr Newall and others
&gt; have all said what he said before. Besides, you only need to take a
&gt; representative sample of modems to prove it to yourself. Incidentally, I
&gt; believe David is a committee member of AUUG; I assume that is what you
&gt; meant.
&gt;
&gt; In that case, this last sentence has at least one truth in it. And it is
&gt; not the ordinate clause. It is the sub-ordinate clause.
