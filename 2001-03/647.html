&gt; On a slightly different topic;
&gt; It is cost effective for all ISPs to offer only a pay per megabyte
&gt; account?

yes, if you are only targetting the type of user who desires this type of
account...

&gt; This would stop income based on those who pay by the hour and chat by the
&gt; hour using a lot of time but little bandwidth. Do those people offset the
&gt; cost of the download leaches? Would the pay per MB effectively cover
&gt; investment in equipment in the long term as well as support costs? Or
&gt; would an effective model be cost per MB plus an extra cent per MB?
&gt;
&gt; Are there any usage patterns of users that can give a view into the
&gt; average usage of bandwidth for all users?

Thing is, different users want different types of service. An ISP wants to
make profit out of all of them. Basically, no business _ever_ wants a
customer who loses them money. Sure, they may accept some in order to get
the profitable customers, but when they can, they will do something about
them. Reducing total bandwidth available acheives the goal of getting rid of
the bandwidth leaches while not upsetting the lurkers too much. etc...

It's all about business decisions. You decide who you are targetting, how
you are going to make money from them, and how to keep the profitable
customers and either turn the unprofitable ones into profitable ones, or get
rid of them. Generally, it's profitable to offer a few different plans to
target more of the market, and try to match the needs of users with the plan
that will suit them best while making enough money for you to continue
business.
