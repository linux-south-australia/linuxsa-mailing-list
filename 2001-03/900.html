 &gt; There is a 250 Mb download limit. 
 &gt; Again the user may also continue to use the service
 &gt; beyond the 250 Mb download limit at no additional cost, however their
 &gt; access will be restricted to local services - which include web access
 &gt; through our proxy server, email, news, SE Net & OzBytes resources.

Sigh.

Jason, that isn't "Free Traffic From The Cache".  That's an account
where they cut you off from the outside world via an ACL or other Radius
magic when you hit a 250 Mbyte limit.

Before that 250 Mbyte limit, of course, you're paying full tote odds on
your access -- no free cache traffic at all!

 &gt; For those who want no time limits to their usage on the 'net. You can use
 &gt; as much time as you like subject to a 4 hour busy killer.
 &gt; You may be disconnected after 4 hours if the lines here are busy
 &gt; (which is pretty rare!). This plan gives you a massive 1500Mb
 &gt; (1.5 Gigabytes!) download per month, and excludes all
 &gt; downloads from the Chariot News, Games and Mail Servers.

Uh, sorry?  You were going to tell me about free *cache* bytes here, 
weren't you?  I'm not reading anything about a cache here, I'm reading
things about news, games and mail.  So they're using Netflow.  Great,
but not what you claimed was available and practical.

 &gt; Then try this:
 &gt; www.chariot.net.au/members/localcheck.htm
 &gt; Enter an address you think will be on saix but not hosted at chariot, eg
 &gt; senet.com.au or internode.com.au. THen try somethign that you reckon
 &gt; might be non local, eg www.microsoft.com.au.
 &gt; Now the free local is not explicitly stated on the product page, but I am
 &gt; 99% sure that it is the policy.

That's interesting.  Especially since it thinks "proxy.chariot.net.au"
is a local site, which by your logic would mean that all web surfing
via their proxy, no matter the destination, would be free.  And you're
welcome to check that out by paying their $53 per month for a "classic"
account if you want to doubt me.

It may also help to provide an example from a company which has actually
made a profit, otherwise it's a bit hard to back up an assertion that
what you're talking about is clever or viable.

 &gt; The local sites check up page I feel supports this to some extent.
 &gt; I am happy to stand corrected, if someone has better info.
 &gt; Now these two I now about off the top of my head.
 
Interesting definition of "knowledge" -- In one case you've missed the 
point completely and given me an example which doesn't include free
cache traffic at all, and in another case you've missed the point again
by giving me an example which doesn't exist (unless you really are going
to show me an example where cache bytes are free -- you haven't done that
yet, and you may recall that that was the original challenge, after you
claimed that it was a common practice).

 &gt; There maybe others.

It should be pretty simple for you to try again, then.

 &gt; But it doesnt really matter, now you can say I keep hearing about it and
 &gt; know about two examples, though I would like to have known about three.

When you find me two examples I'll think about it.  Until then we won't
even need to go that far.

 &gt; I think it is enough evidence to suggest that this type of traffic
 &gt; differentiation is not just outrageous local urban internet myth.

Ok, Jason -- Free free.   Please, go ahead and use ISPs which offer
that, behave like a member of "the market" and vote with your feet.

As someone else said last week, if what you wanted was (a) financially
viable, and (b) popular, someone, somewhere would be doing it, and you
would be able to give your business to them.  The Internet Industry is
*extremely* competitive, and if there's a way for one a company to gain a
leg-up over one of their competitors you can bet your arse they'll do it.
The fact that you have to come in here and complain about how you can't
get what you want, instead of being able to go out and get it, is a strong
suggestion that what you want is impractical to the point of infeasibility.
