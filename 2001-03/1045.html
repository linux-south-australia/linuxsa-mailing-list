Fraser,

Thank you very much for taking the time to provide a very thorough reply.

While I was aware of much of what you say, I am almost certain that there
are people on the list who are not, and who have learned a number of new
things as a result.

The pointer to the HDD capacity limitations paper is, in particular, most
useful.

&gt;&gt;I have a machine that I just put back in use, 
&gt;&gt;an AMD K6-2/400 with an Award BIOS from 1998.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It could not probe the 16GB IDE disk I put in it, 
&gt;&gt;but was fine with an 8.4GB drive.
&gt;
&gt;Richard,
&gt;
&gt;I ran into a similar problem after installing a 2.1GB 
&gt;HDD in my 10-year old laptop. And just to complicate things,
&gt;I needed to be able to run Linux or DOS or Windows as needed.
&gt;
&gt;The laptop BIOS needed Toshiba's version of Disk Manager to
&gt;see the whole HDD, but Disk Manager & LILO don't get along. 
&gt;Here's how I got around it:
&gt;
&gt; - Installed the Disk Manager.
&gt;
&gt; - Installed DOS/Windows but didn't use the entire HDD capacity
&gt;for this partition.
&gt;
&gt; - Installed Linux in the remaining HDD space; and before quitting 
&gt;Linux, copied the kernel image (vmlinuz) to a DOS floppy.
&gt;
&gt; - In DOS, created a C:\LINUX directory; copied the kernel image to it,
&gt;and copied LOADLIN.EXE (from a Linux CD) into the same directory.
&gt;
&gt; - To use Linux, I boot to a DOS prompt and then run LOADLIN 
&gt;with the appropriate switches for my setup.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Chances are your HDD manufacturer has Disk Manager or equivalent 
&gt;available
&gt;from their website. If you're not planning to dual-boot, you might try 
&gt;using a 5MB DOS partition (to hold LOADLIN etc) and use the other 
&gt;15.995GB 
&gt;for Linux.
&gt;
&gt;Speaking of partitions, many Linuxes required the partition holding /root 
&gt;to 
&gt;reside entirely within the first 1024 cylinders. I think the recent 
&gt;Linuxes 
&gt;have overcome this limitation, but it might require BIOS support too?
&gt;
&gt;The K6-2 should work fine. My K6-2 550 is detected as a "586" by RedHat 
&gt;6.1. 
&gt;I have found, however, that some "686"-specific stuff refused to run. So 
&gt;if I'm grabbing binary RPMs I just go for the 386 versions.
&gt;
&gt;BTW there's a good introduction to HDD capacity limitations for 
&gt;various OSs on Maxtor's website:

&gt;
&gt;They even mention Linux :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;cheers,
&gt;Fraser Farrell
