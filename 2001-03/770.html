&gt; &gt; So what, in all walks of life we have abuse, it's part of natures
&gt; &gt; plan to make people different. I have spoken to lots of people
&gt; &gt; involved with ISP's and  sure some of them have abusers, the
&gt; &gt; MAJORITY of people do not.

What I find so ironic about this statement is that you claim to have
"spoken to lots of people involved with ISP's", whereas Mark actually
IS someone "involved with ISP's".

It reminds me of a great Blackadder quote, and forgive me if I don't
get this verbatim...

    "So what you're saying percy, is that something you have never
    seen, is as green as, something else you've never seen."

&gt; Here you go, Stephen: Make your very next utterance on this subject
&gt; be a costed business model, and use actual costs for links, not some
&gt; figure that you pluck out of the air because it suits you.  Only
&gt; when you have done that will you be qualified to pontificate.  Until
&gt; then you're just blowing hot air.

Hear hear! This is a business plan I am really looking forward to. Be
sure to forward it to all the other people on this list who work for
an ISP, or who are involved in the ISP industry, as we may be about to
see the turning point in the ISP industry in Australia.

I can't believe we've all be wasting the last 6 or so years. *tsch*

Cheers

Alex!
