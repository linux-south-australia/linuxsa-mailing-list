Same problem here.

I purchased a Sola 325 SOLELY because they promised time and time again that they support Linux / Unix.  What a load of crap.  The cable did not work and they advised me to pull out the plug and play pin as "oh yeah - we have had some trouble with that".  I would not have minded had they included information with the UPS or told me first - it is their responsibility - not mine - to ensure that people are aware of this.

I have also inquired about using the advanced features of the UPS - mains line information and battery time, UPS state, etc, being read by Linux - they never got back to me.

Why are Linux users regarded as second class citizens?

On a side note - I work for a large multinational corporation (EDS).  I asked around and it turns out that EDS will not use Sola owing to software issues - they much prefer APC owing to better Unix support.

&gt;&gt; I'd have to agree with Mike.
&gt;&gt; I tried to get a Sola working on a Samba server but
&gt;&gt; couldn't get it to communicate through the onboard
&gt;&gt; serial ports.
&gt;&gt; It appears that there are some anomalies with the cable that
&gt;&gt; Sola use with their UPSes.
&gt;&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Same kind of problems here.
&gt;Had a client with a compaq box running RH6.2 & Samba-TNG
&gt;We put the Sola UPS in and our Boss said to their Boss "check this out"
&gt;killed the mains power,
&gt;down went the server = egg on face.
&gt;
&gt;Call to Sola, "oh that box needs a slightly different power supply you want
&gt;the UPS model xyz, didn't we tell you, he he."
&gt;
&gt;Ok put in new model, pull the plug on the main power (no client around this
&gt;time) ok the system works, bring back the mains power and the modem on the
&gt;other comm port is open and wont dial out. ARRRGGGHHHHH!!
&gt;Sola still has an open problem on this issue and hasn't got back to us.
&gt;
&gt;But your comments about the serial ports and the cable sheds some light!
