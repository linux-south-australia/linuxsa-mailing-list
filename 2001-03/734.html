I withdraw my remarks about creating a flamewar to find out who are the
members of the list. This ADSL, or should I say these ADSL discussions,
appear to display the following qualities:

1) List Topic

It's off topic. This discussion is clearly and obviously off topic. You
are all discussing the benefits of ADSL and nothing _at all_ about
linux. Nothing. Zilch. Zero. I don't have a problem with this at all;
the list, which hasn't spoken about this matter, will silence you when
it has had enough.

2) Sensibility

There appears to be (approximately) two to three camps in this debate:

* The "Ian McLeod Camp"
 - wants ADSL for free

Think this is unfair? I don't apologise but that is, essentially, what
that camp is saying no matter how much they bleat they are not.

* The "Internode Camp"
 - justifying why ADSL costs as much as it does

Providing valid arguments from a strong position, the "Internode Camp"
is doing a good job of justifying costs, not blaming Telstra openly and
appears to be winning the _logical_ argument with the "Ian McCleod Camp"

* The "(Un)amused Observers"
 - watching, bemused and wondering why "<A HREF="mailto:adsl@linuxsa.org.au">adsl@linuxsa.org.au</A>" doesn't
exist

Depending on which observer you talk to, the observer may be amused by
this discussion or not amused.

3) Arguments Tendered

Both sides are making valid points. No side has merged the valid points
into a coherent whole. Rather, we seem to have piqued the "Internode
Camp" into speaking in veiled sarcasm, whilst the "Ian McCleod Camp" are
bleating "blame someone else, we want free ADSL" until the lambs go
silent.

Notably, as I have already pointed out, logic escapes this particular
thread.

4) Vitriol

It's not as vitriolic as it could be. The vitriol is being poured from
the "Internode Camp" - the "Ian McLeod Camp" is, in _my_ opinion, simply
innocent and I treat its noises and apparent vitriol as one treats
children screaming "I want a lolly" in the supermarket.


I formally conclude, therefore, that this is a flame war. It's off
topic. It's vitriolic - don't bull s*t me, it is - and neither side is
going to budge from their positions. Furthermore, both sides are
essentially correct depending on what assumptions, presumptions and
suppositions you decide to take.

Let the lambs go silent.

DSL

(1)

Which side am I on? Whilst the "Ian McLeod Camp" is showing tenacity
beyond measure - something that I respect and admire - the "Internode
Camp" is winning the logical debate. Perhaps I am an UNamused
observer...but I do find this thread amusing.

(2)

Why all the CC's? Because you can't say "no"...
