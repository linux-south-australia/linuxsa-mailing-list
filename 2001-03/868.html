&gt;&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I got to wondering if LWN was actually making enough money from its
&gt;&gt; advertising to support the wonderful stuff they do. As a result of this, I
&gt;&gt; thought about some other funding models they could use.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;Gurgle!&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Richard, you're actively advertising a company & it products on the list. I
&gt;was under the (possibly false) impression that that considered bad form.

Allan, what sort of drugs are on?

I was providing information to people about sources of Linux information. I
have had at least two people say that they were unaware of LWN.

Secondly, in my view, LWN does not have a product in the generally accepted
sense of things.  For example, recently, I posted an advertisement about
the Samba courses I offer.  That was actively advertising a company and its
products. LWN, on the other hand, offers a currently free service.

&gt;This is the second time you've done this, first it was "/." (though to a
&gt;lesser extent), now this mob. 

Hmmm, I don't recall it. I might have send a reference to an article on the
site ...

&gt;                               Where does it end?

It probably doesn't.  I think that the products and services of Linux
companies are relevant to this list. I am sure that people would want to
hear about products like DB2 and Oracle that run on Linux, as well as
StarOffice, Win4Lin, VMware, and a whole host of other products, plus
information about training, and tutorials etc.

&gt;Until you sent that piece of spam (ridiculous word for junkmail) I'd never
&gt;heard of them, now I'll be even less inclined to visit their site if I see
&gt;it in a web search.

Well, then, I have obviously achieved my purpose of informing more people
of the existance of this valuable info source, but I cannot do anything
about a narrow minded attitude that chooses not to visit a site because of
annoyance at the source of the information.

&gt;I see myself with three options here:-
&gt;
&gt;1. Filter the thread.
&gt;2. Filter mail from you.
&gt;3. Unsubscribe from the list.

Feel free to killfile me if you like ... your choice ...

&gt;For the moment I'm going with option 1.

So, you are prepared to criticize but do not want to see any criticism of
your point of view :-)

&gt;Allan
