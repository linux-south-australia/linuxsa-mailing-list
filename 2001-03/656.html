&gt; I'm looking at buying a digital camera and the Canon IXUS looks pretty
&gt; cool (its sooo small).

Sure is. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a better zoom,
but that's the price you pay for a very small and sexy camera. I'd also
buy a second battery when you get it too - if you're planning on a whole 
day in the sun with the IXUS, you'll need that extra power. Of course,
if you're doing that, you'll also want a bigger CF card than the 8Mb one
that it comes with (esp. when you're taking pictures at 1600x1200 all
day long). I've got 96Mb, and it's a pretty nice size.

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with downloading photos from
&gt; it under Linux. GPhoto website doesn't seem to list it, unless the IXUS
&gt; has a alpha-numeric model number that I can't find..

I have to confess that I transfer the pictures off under W2K, but that's
because the IXUS doesn't actually have a comms. port built in [1] - you
need a CF card reader, and so I use Windows 'cause my HP Jornada has a
CF reader built in....

But I guess if you can get a CF reader to work under Linux, you should
be fine!


[1] Okay, it seems to have a port that you can plug in a cable that
goes to an RCA jack to plug into your VCR, but I haven't actually
tried doing that yet. It's probably not much use on your PC anyway :-)
