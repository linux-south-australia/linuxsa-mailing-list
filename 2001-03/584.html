&gt; So what, in all walks of life we have abuse, it's part of natures plan

&gt; So what you are proposing is that because a few abuse X we all should
&gt; pay the same price (and not just financially).  You really want to read
&gt; carefully what you are implying.

Yes, Stephen: Because some people will abuse the system everybody gets
restricted to an abuse-less contract.  What do you expect?  Do you think
an ISP is going to write a supply contract that says unlimited except
for people who would abuse the system?  Do you care to draw up such a
contract?


&gt; Give me a break, want to know what I think Mark, I think you are speaking
&gt; the employer speak, you have not the faintest clue about, or interest in,
&gt; real issues and are simply justifying a business point (model) and using
&gt; a weak argument to boot.

Here's what I think: I think I've seen Mark explain -- and quite kindly,
too -- why unlimited accounts are difficult for an ISP.  I think he's
drawn on history of the big-guys' unlimited accounts, and specifically
that they quickly became limited.  I think he's predicted, and with a
believable argument, that an ISP offering a really unlimited is either
going to go out of business, or else is offering a loss-leader to gain
market share, which is not a sustainable business model.  What else do
I think: I think I've seen you ignore what he's said, and bluster that
some ISPs do it so any that doesn't do it is unthinking.  You certainly
haven't shown any of clue or interest in the real issues, which is
ironic since you just accused Mark, who has shown great understanding
of same, of exactly that.

Here you go, Stephen: Make your very next utterance on this subject be
a costed business model, and use actual costs for links, not some figure
that you pluck out of the air because it suits you.  Only when you have
done that will you be qualified to pontificate.  Until then you're just
blowing hot air.
