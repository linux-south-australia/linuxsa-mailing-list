&gt; While John Howard would prefer that we not raise the R word, it seems
&gt; pretty clear that the world is headed for a recession.

mmm... unfortunately...

&gt; It would be interesting to speculate whether or not this will be
&gt; good, bad,
&gt; or indifferent (or even ugly) for Linux.

Well, there's a few issues here:


* Development

I think that Linux development, presently funded directly and indirectly by
corporates, will slow somewhat. Companies (like RedHat and IBM) directly
funding development will reduce their investment, and developers who develop
in their own time outside of their normal work (indirectly funded by their
employers) will find life in general a little harder, and may not be able to
devote the same amount of time to development.

Of course, this will affect some developments more than others. I'd suggest
that things that have a real business benefit (Journalling File Systems,
Apache, etc) will be supported more readily than those of questionable
business benefit (ICQ clones, MP3 decoders, etc). I'd also expect that there
will become less diversity in developments. Developers will cluster around
the more successful, important-to-business products, leaving nice-but-niche
developments for more prosperous days.


* Business take-up

Business take-up will be more cautious than ever. Businesses will be more
interested, but more cautious -- they will need to see _real_ financial
benefits in taking up Linux before they do so. Free beer won't cut it --
this is all about TCO. It will be about reducing the effort to maintain, and
keep a very predictable level of effort and cost (that's a shocking
sentence... exercise for the reader: rewrite that sentence sensibly).


* User take-up

Users will take it up more and less. More because it's free, and end-users
are more sensitive to price than businesses. Less because users are
interested in whatever businesses are interested in and if business gets
less interested in Linux, then so will a certain type of user (the type who
is learning Linux primarily for potential employment options)


* Hype levels

I think almost all but the least clueful media outlets have been through the
cycle of hype Linux up, followed by tear it down. Media will still look at
Linux as if it were (or could be) a silver bullet, but for the most part,
they will begin to take a more balanced perspective on things. I'd expect
lots of articles like "Can Linux really save your business monkey?" and
"RedHat and Microsoft -- who will survive?"... In general, software and
internet hype will subside (is subsiding?), and life will be a lot more
about business needs and so on... I'd also expect a lot more interest in the
relative merits of BSD as against Linux. BSD, of course, comes without the
history of hype, but with many of the same advantages, and given the
negative hype against Linux, BSD may benefit :)


* Linux Companies

There will be a whole raft of new business models, all trying various
combinations of techniques to make money out of Linux. I'd expect to see
more differentiation, with more services designed to keep people paying
money regularly, rather than one-off product selling and portal-style
websites living off advertising "revenue". I'd also expect investors to be
really harsh on companies who still aren't turning a profit (eg Redhat still
making a loss...), particularly if they have been around for a while...
(just looking up stock prices atm, check 1 year trends for RHAT, CORL, LNUX,
SUNW, MSFT, CSCO, IBM... IBM is the only one holding up... quite amazing,
really) ... still, I think there will be a lot more buyouts and mergers and
bankruptcies yet. These coming few years will really be the testing ground
for not only Linux, but the Internet as a business medium. Anything that
comes through unscathed by the time things look up will be considered models
from how to make money from open source and/or the internet. It will be
interesting to see if the brands that have been built up are really worth
anything...


I think I've crapped on adequately, and will stop now.
