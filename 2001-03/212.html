E-MAIL SHARING BANNED BY LAW IN AUSTRALIA
Forwarding e-mail to friends, family or colleagues without permission
from 
the sender is now illegal in Australia, thanks to a new law that took 
effect yesterday. Penalties for violation could be as much as five
years' 
jail time or fines of AU$60,000 (US$31,400). The motivation behind the
law 
is copyright protection for the sender of the original e-mail. But in 
addition to material that already has copyright protection, such as 
excerpts from books or song lyrics, the new measure also affects
personal 
messages. "It's quite possible that the forwarding of an e-mail could be
a 
technical infringement of copyright," says a legal advisor for
Australia's 
attorney general. "E-mailing something is a 'communication' under the 
Digital Agenda Act and so is putting something up on a Web site." This
new 
interpretation means a simple e-mail about office gossip or holiday
plans 
also carries personal copyright protection. It is estimated that 5
million 
or more e-mail messages are forwarded around Australia every day. (The 
Sunday Telegraph 4 Mar 2001)
