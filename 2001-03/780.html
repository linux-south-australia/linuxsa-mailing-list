This article makes me suspect that maybe, just maybe,
dual-booting linux + windXYZ would become a thing of the past.

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/17783.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/17783.html</A>

I quote:

----------------------------------------------------
The utility companies are going to get it again when Windows
XP ships - not that they've any right to be surprised. Microsoft
has made some small revisions to NTFS with WinXP, resulting
in the likes of Partition Magic bouncing straight off WinXP
installations, splattering error messages around the place. 

This probably goes for any other utility that manipulates
partitions and/or wants to twiddle around with Master Boot
Records, and it surely won't come as a surprise to the vendors,
as they regularly get whacked by Microsoft file system upgrades.
Still, it's a bummer for Partition Magic, which only started
running native on Win2k relatively recently, and WinXP is in
essence a rev of Win2k. 
----------------------------------------------------

They go on to list things like RealPlayer that won't work any more.

It's the bit about the MBR that worries me.
It just might be that the new WindXP could somehow reject
LILO MBRs or something.
And maybe linux won't be able to read/write the new file system.

Could this be a way to stop people dual-booting?
Does anyone have any facts on this?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
