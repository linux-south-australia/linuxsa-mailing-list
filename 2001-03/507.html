Yes, I am aware that ISP's pay for bandwidth, as far as i've learnt, on
average 8cents per mb, or on high usage, often unlimited.

To begin with, at home, I use an Ihug Ultra Satellite package, paying
approximately $60 per month. I am allowed to connect for 300 hours per
month, unlimited downloads. This satellite operates with 33k uplink analogue
modem uplink, and a 400k sat inbound. This does have the trouble of a little
bit of latency, but other than that, it's great. I run it on my linux box,
masquerade it over my network at home and I can get download speeds of near
90kilo BYTES per second, of course using a simultaneous downloading utlity
such as download accellerator. I have been on average downloading up to 20
gig per month ... no problems ... in which way am I deluding myself my
wishing to pay more than this for essentially a similar deal, only a little
faster ?

Since ISP's do pay for bandwidth, many ISP owners feel the best way to run
their business is to pass that cost onto the customer, rather than factor
the cost into the product, and aim for higher volume for offering customers
a better offer ... this can often show in many small isp's, many of which
who have existed longer than most in business, but never really grown much
larger ....

I am also aware that there aren't many, if not any, local ISP's who offer
unlimited bandwidth for similar deals as the "big" companies such as $24.95
per month unlimited etc. I in all ways will recommend to friends / clients
etc to use the services of Local ISP's to help keep business in SA, and to
assist the preventions of monopolies in the big companies. However, when it
comes to myself, I KNOW BETTER. I have done research, it is possible for me
to obtain unlimited bandwidth from big ISP's for my use. Primus offer
1.5MBPS ADSL $120 per month or so unlimited bandwidth for residential use
... I think I would be deluding myself for saying sorry, no, I'd rather
purchase ISDN from another provider, re-badged as "DSL" and pay shit loads
for bandwidth ????

I know John, you have a certain obligation to your employer to push "pay for
bandwidth", but really it is this thinking which is holding back Internet in
this country (... don't you even use the Ihug dish yourself ??). With some
intelligent restructuring, I'm sure that even the smaller local ISP's who
use peering networks, caches, and have multi-hommed links to the net, would
be able to push for volume sales and offer unlimited bandwidth to their
clients, without significant loss to the ISP owner.

I have checked out www.southerncrosscables.com looking for figures and I
cannot see anything showing such prices as you have quoted in your email ?

In no way I do not mean any offense my this email, nor do I wish to detract
from your business, only I do not appreciate being insulted on a public
mailing list.

&gt; As far as I can find, iPrimus are the only people to offer unlimited data

Again; Good, Fast, Cheap, pick any two.

For all of the people out their deluding themselves that the world owes
them unlimited bandwidth for the cost of pocket change, do the sums..

Most ISP's are now bringing in data indirectly via Southern Cross (SX),
right?
Southern Cross doesn't do discounts (besides volume), not even for those
who invested in it, so Optus and UUNET are getting access to it as the
same price as everyone else can.

Now, to buy 2Mb of unlimited-usage bandwidth on SX is around $15000 per
month, on a long contract (5-15 years), and doesn't include any Internet
connectivity, just a connection between Sydney and California. Maybe you
can get a better deal by using some dodgy back-passage cable instead and
piggy-backing on China's bandwidth. Stretch it, cache it, massage it,
peer it and water it down as much as you can, and it still doesn't come
anywhere near the $50 per month most end-users would like to pay for it.

Sure, it's human nature to want a deal that's too good to be true. For
those after such a deal, have a think about the above before wondering
out-loud on a mailing list full of people who should know better.
