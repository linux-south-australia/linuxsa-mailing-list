&gt; The utility companies are going to get it again when Windows

&gt; installations, splattering error messages around the place.

Small revisions to NTFS. They did exactly the same thing with Windows
2000, and that still dual boots fine. I can't say much about Partition
Magic, as I haven't used a version for quite some time.

&gt; This probably goes for any other utility that manipulates
&gt; partitions and/or wants to twiddle around with Master Boot
&gt; Records, and it surely won't come as a surprise to the vendors,
&gt; as they regularly get whacked by Microsoft file system upgrades.
&gt; Still, it's a bummer for Partition Magic, which only started
&gt; running native on Win2k relatively recently, and WinXP is in
&gt; essence a rev of Win2k.
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure how the MBR has anything to do with file system changes.
They may be talking about the problem with changing the partition size
in the partition table. This is guaranteed to screw up an NTFS
partition, unless you rebuild all of the file system structures and move
the file data to within the new size. You would most likely get an
INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE blue screen on boot. This would only remain the
case until a) someone worked out what the changes were and told the
world about it, b) some company pays microsoft heaps of money to be able
to find out how the new modifications to NTFS work or c) someone waits
for a little while and gleans as much information as they can from
resources such as MSDN.

I very much doubt that this would affect people's ability to run Windows
XP and other systems. It won't matter to me anyway, as I won't be using
XP. :-).
