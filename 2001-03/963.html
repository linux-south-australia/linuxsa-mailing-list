&gt; So. The general idea of Michael letting other users know about what "w1" can
&gt; possibly do for them was thoughful, and I like a lot of other members on the
&gt; list are glad he posted it.

But that's not what he said, is it?  He said that w1 *will* work for
you, too.  That was what I criticised, and I believe I did so clearly and
succinctly.  Perhaps you were so incensed by my categorising it as crap
that you didn't bother to read the next sentence that explained *why*?
As they say, "you can lead a Norse to water but you can't make him
sink." -- Rocky, from Rocky & Bullwinkle show.


&gt; Hey, at least Microsoft Support treat a user kindly, even though their
&gt; support has a lot to desire.

Hey, they charge money; I do this as a free community service.  If you
pay me $50 per incident I'll be sweet, too.  (And I'll also give the
bare minimum of information, thus chaining you to my expensive advice
for life.)


&gt; Just because one user, who has a small amount of knowledge tries to help and
&gt; offer suggestions to another, gives no justification for "experts" to accuse
&gt; a helper of being a bloody idiot if they are not 100% correct.

Did I do that?  I don't think so.  I said, "crap!" which clearly referred
to the suggestion about w1; and equally clearly did not refer to the
person who made the suggestion.


&gt; I was never after any points in the first place, I just don't see the
&gt; benefit of raming it down someone's throat if they are not 100% correct. The
&gt; majority of silent users appreciate the many small helpful comments a lot
&gt; more than the bagging comments made by the odd member.

How many of these silent users appreciate being misdirected?



&gt; Maybe when someone is wrong, users correcting them can be a little more
&gt; suttle about it and not so accusing!

I have just one more thing to say to you: There's a Bee in subtle.
