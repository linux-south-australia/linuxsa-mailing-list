&gt; &gt; Give me a break, want to know what I think Mark, I think you are
&gt; &gt; speaking the
&gt; &gt; employer speak, you have not the faintest clue about, or interest
&gt; &gt; in, real issues
&gt; &gt; and are simply justifying a business point (model) and using a
&gt; &gt; weak argument to
&gt; &gt; boot.
&gt;
&gt; Very odd, Stephen... Very odd indeed.
&gt;
&gt; May I suggest that we lay this to rest now? I think that we all know that
&gt; there are some ISPs out there who offer unlimited bandwidth deals, and
&gt; people who want them can use them. I think we also know that there are some
&gt; ISPs out there that don't offer these deals, and if that is how they choose
&gt; to do their business, then let them be. How a particular ISP decides to do
&gt; business is their own business, and if they want to risk making a loss on
&gt; some accounts for the purpose of gaining marketshare, or gaining accounts
&gt; where they don't make a loss, then good on them. If their gamble doesn't pay
&gt; off, then either they fold, or they find ways to make those accounts more
&gt; profitable. There are no two ways around this -- as has been said
&gt; previously, Fast, Good, Cheap... pick any two. This goes for both customers
&gt; and providers -- providers choose what compromise they provide, gambling
&gt; that there will be enough customers to take them up, and customers choose a
&gt; provider that matches their needs.
&gt;
&gt; One thing that it would be good for us all to remember here is that there is
&gt; no point at all in running a loss-making business, and the corollory of
&gt; that: there's no such thing as a free lunch. Likewise, by the way, there's
&gt; little point in working for a loss-making company, or even in doing business
&gt; with one, especially if you require ongoing service and support. If the
&gt; company is losing money, then at some stage, it will run out and cease to
&gt; employ or provice service, and will cease to fulfill your needs as an
&gt; employee or customer. Of course, in some situations, it doesn't matter so
&gt; much if a business you are a customer of goes out of business -- for eg, if
&gt; Shell started an all-you-can-eat petrol system, I'd use it if it saved me
&gt; money, regardless of whether it caused the bankruptcy of Shell, because
&gt; changing to Mobil or BP for filling up my car is trivial. However, if I were
&gt; a major transport company, it may matter to me quite a lot, as I would have
&gt; developed a business arrangement with Shell, due to the fact that I buy so
&gt; much fuel, and if they were to fold, I would have to invest a lot of time
&gt; and money in renegotiating with Mobil or BP... It's the same with data.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, I think some people are still missing the point about things
&gt; costing more here than in the USA. As Mr Hackett said, it's largely due to
&gt; geography. It's one of the costs of living in Australia, and it's
&gt; unavoidable. Of course, the history of Telstra in Australia makes this
&gt; situation somewhat worse, but fixing that won't solve everything.
&gt;
&gt; all MHO.
