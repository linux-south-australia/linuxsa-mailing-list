David,

One last comment,

Whilst I assume that you prefer to mix with people who have the same level
of knowledge on unix/linux as yourself. I personally try to help people who
are just starting out, the newbies. Contrary to your beliefs most first
timers welcome any sort of help to any degree, whether is perfectly
explained or extremely rough. I suppose a good many users that you respond
to are using Linux in a business manner and reply on 100 % accuracy within
your replies, I can understand that as I have been in that situation myself.
Learning linux is not as simple one two three, like you know it takes time.
So reading a manual for this and another manual for that, is not always
possible due to the time restrictions that we often have. So general
suggestions from users with more knowledge is usually appreciated by all
newbies, and yes even if it is not always accurate, it at least gives an
impression of what is possible, and the direction to take to acheive it.

Remember David N, you where a newbie once too.


Wayne
