Might I also point out that, before everyone is so quick to criticize and
cry foul that the reason for this may be a defficiency in browser technology
for use in a commercial environment?

Now, I am not sure as to how much client-dependant technology these
government sites use, but being relatively well versed in W3C technologies
and having used them a lot when developing for both netscape and MSIE, I can
say one thing with conviction: Netscape is the poorest browser available for
supporting .  Im not trying to start a browser war here, and I can present
the facts to demonstrate that Netscape 1) blows for any serious development
and 2) is holding Internet technologies back by people using it.

Now, if by 'Netscape' you meant Mozilla, the case is different.  Mozilla is
a good effort to implement W3C technologies.  However, delivery time is
always 'too little too late' when it comes to the general availability of
W3C technologies. If history serves as any guide, a technology makes its
initial appearance in IE and 6-8 months down the track, it makes a
half-baked appearance in Mozilla.

For me, it has gotten to the point where I will code for MSIE (using a unix
server environment ironically) and not bother about any other browsers
because 1) netscape blows and 2) Mozilla will catch up (and does),
eventually.

Now, having said all that, why the government may need to be continually
using the latest of browser technology and therefore validating my argument
is beyond me ;)

I also has a friend in the government, who has posted this reply to this
issue:

"As for the thread about government sites.. thats just funny.. really you
should get them to check out the ministers site, and try looking at it
with flash 5 and cookies turned of(sic).

If they really do want their point across then they should vent their
feelings at:

Armitage actually reads that stuff."

&gt; Mark!
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; this thread could be forwarded to their web-master, perhaps this
would
&gt; &gt;  &gt; get his/her ass into gear :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hardly likely.  Government web sites usually have web-committees which
&gt; &gt; can't do anything without a properly audited and approved change
request,
&gt; &gt; rather than an individual webmaster.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but the committee won't know that not everyone uses IE if we don't
&gt; say anything either...there is a saying "The journey of 1000 miles
&gt; begins with just 1 step..."
