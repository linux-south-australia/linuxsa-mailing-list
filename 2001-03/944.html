&gt; &gt;However the real point I was trying to make was there are reasons why what
&gt; &gt;is unsustainable for a regional isp might not be unsustaninable for a
&gt; &gt;larger one.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's right - economies of scale do apply here, but they aren't 
&gt; really the factor thats at issue in the threads to date.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Ie I was trying to asnwer the specicif question that was asked of "how can
&gt; &gt;these non traffic limited accounts" be ecnonomically sustainable when
&gt; &gt;copanies must pay on a traffic counted way?
&gt; 
&gt; They are not unlimited traffic. The traffic is always limited by 
&gt; -something-. Limited by AUP (see above), or by speed of the pipe, or 

&gt; maximum session time, or any one of a number of other things.

Of course the traffic is limited by the pipe size, the available incoming
bandwidth of your upstream provider, and their upsteram provider, if any
etc etc.

Even internode users are limited in some regards, right? ;-)

I should have been more specific and said "accounts that are
not explicitly traffic limited by the account plan" or similar, I belive I
have in other posts.

&gt; 
&gt; Truly unlimited would let me plug a 100 megabit tail in to such a 
&gt; provider and pull traffic at 100 megabits per second, 24x7. The fact 
&gt; that this is obviously not what anyone means is proof that all of 
&gt; this discussion is using variable definitions of 'limited' - and its 
&gt; the variability of various people's personal definitions that is 
&gt; causing the conversation to go around in circles.
&gt; 

Which is of course avaialbe, you just have ot be willign to pay.

Just as retail consumers have to be willing to pay if they want a truly
unlimited account.

&gt; &gt;My answer is not all companies do have to pay that way.
&gt; &gt;Some fwerw get their traffic for virtully nothing( ogf course tehy apy
&gt; &gt;carrigage costs, but everyone does - the thign is saller palyers pay
&gt; &gt;carriage and data costs. Teh significance I think is that fcarriage is a
&gt; &gt;fixed knwo quantiy easily didved between a given user population wwheras
&gt; &gt;until recently traffic in this country was not, though I beleive it can be
&gt; &gt;now).
&gt; 
&gt; What happened to your keyboard, Jason? Did someone swap several 
&gt; letters over or something? try reading the above again :)

Actually it is fatigue.

&gt; 
&gt; As I said in great detail in another post, fixed cost for a finite 
&gt; bandwidth is directly equatable to cents per MB. They're one and the 
&gt; same thing.

Hmm, I am not sure I agree with you.
I certainly agree that you have described what is almost certainly the
most common method for asseing the cost, value and utility of a fixed cost
pipe.

You chose one particular way of assesing the  the cost of the fixed pipe,
but I think there are other ways of assesing it - i e other way s of
lookign at the "problem".
Eg in terms of how many simulatenous users it can support at a given
average bandwidth per users, from which you can extrapolate the number
of total users you can support, and how much revenue you can expect to
generate from that population.

A different way of interpreting the same figures.

 &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Then of course the obvious queitonis then why fdo they constantly go out
&gt; &gt;of business, get bought out or report loss? Or why are there not any of
&gt; &gt;these accounts?
&gt; 
&gt; Because the industry, like all industries, has its share of idiots 
&gt; (and non-idiots who try hard but don't understand the true economics 
&gt; of the situation, and are sucked into copying the next door 
&gt; neighbours' account on the basis that 'he must be making money!')
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;My beleif is that although larger companies may
&gt; &gt;have achieved a postion where they can
&gt; &gt;offer those services, they dont always do it efficiently.
&gt; &gt;Example large ISP contracts out their web site to portal company. Result
&gt; &gt;if optus has
&gt; &gt;an outage (eg mail servere fails - and they do ahve these outages) they
&gt; &gt;cant ust put a message on their web site. They need at least 24 hours to
&gt; &gt;get portal company to change their site content. Which of course leads to
&gt; &gt;tech suport having vast lines of users all wanting to know why mail doesnt
&gt; &gt;work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;They dont change their phone message to tell the user of the problem
&gt; &gt;either(why I am not sure). Result a user sits on hold for 45 minutes to be
&gt; &gt;told teh problem is not theirs its the ISPs.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, and you've neatly encapsulated the argument in favour of 
&gt; supporting your friendly local ISP - thanks for that :)
&gt; 

I do.

Which is why I believe that though difficult small and medium isps,
can survive and can even still eb started, with sufficent clue and
capital.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; what is 'unlimited' in those accounts what is 'limited'? Otherwise
&gt; &gt;  &gt; you're comparing eggs to albatrosses and the whole thing is pointless
&gt; &gt;  &gt; (which it probably is anyway...)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I dont recall making comments about unlimited acounts, weitehr exisitng
&gt; &gt;or beign economically.
&gt; 
&gt; But you're talking above about non-limited download quotas. 
&gt; 'non-limited' means 'unlimited', doesn't it?

Yes but unlimited download does not mean an unlimited account.
You can limit on time eg the old $1 per hour account.
You can limit bandwith, eg you have an unlimited download quota but you a
only suck at 1k per sec max ie your quota is not limited but your
ability to suck is.


&gt; &gt;I believe my assertaion was more along the lines of charging by other
&gt; &gt;crtieria tnan per magebyte is possible and could be done at a profit using
&gt; &gt;fixed price badnwidth billed p[ipes instead of per meg pipes -
&gt; &gt;probably not as big a profit as chargingg per meg though, but I did nto
&gt; &gt;say it woudl be as profitable, I just said I thought it was possible.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, and as I've said already, fixed $ for a fixed pipe size is 
&gt; directly equatable to $ per MB, just insert your average utilisation. 
&gt; For a domestic customer, in general, whose utilisation won' t be high 
&gt; on a 24x7 basis, the utilisation becomes very low.

We choose to use different formula.
Your is probably more profitbale.
I am still reaosnably confident that mine is viable.

&gt; However, in this situation, another factor kicks in - which is that 
&gt; every port at the ISP's side costs them money on a 
&gt; fixed-cost-per-line basis (and even the line rentals are more 
&gt; expensive than residential lines - Telstra reward high line count 
&gt; businesses by charging MORE, not LESS, per line - go figure).
 
&gt; So as people stay on for huge hour counts with very little downloaded 
&gt; volume, the dominant cost then tends towards the $26 or so per month 
&gt; in line rental fees and the roughly same again in costs of buying, 
&gt; maintaining, upgrading and running access server equipment. So if you 
&gt; stay on a line 24 hours a day, even downloading nothing, you've cost 
&gt; your ISP about $52 already in that month.

This is why I said unlimted traffic quota, not unlimited account.

&gt; TANSTAAFL

??? Not familiar with the acronym.
 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hmm, that old chestnut.. ;-)
&gt; &gt;The "ineveitable industry shake" out which has been threatening the
&gt; &gt;industry for at least 5 years now (ie over half of the life time of the
&gt; &gt;industry).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;In fact based on some figrues peopel ahve thrown around the lit I came up
&gt; &gt;with a business plan... want to invest? ;-))
&gt; 
&gt; Why? I'm already successfully in the industry. Go ahead, enter the 

If you are interested in why, we should talk off list.
I'll assume however it is a rehetorical question, so wont hold my breath
waiting. :-)

&gt; market, Jason. If you mean it, mate.  Don't blame me if you fail, 
&gt; however.

I dont have the means to enter the industry, if I obtain the means I will.
If I did and I failed I would only have myself to blame.

&gt; &gt;It surely woud be harder now, but I still think it would be possible.
&gt; &gt;Especially with semi - creative products, marketing/loyalty schemes, and
&gt; &gt;the ever difficult to get, good service.
&gt; 
&gt; Only with a huge amount of capital and a correspondingly huge level of risk.


&gt; &gt;Admitedly I havent personally ever had an Internode account, but I have
&gt; &gt;had accounts with at least 3 major(national) and 3 regional as well as a
&gt; &gt;couple of local ISPs(and worked in  a few local ISPs too), and have not
&gt; &gt;yet found one that does all things as well as I would like.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you said you hadn't tried one of ours... :)

Because they dont have the right price range for me- at least not as far
as I can get from your phone answerers or web site.

But then again I have not checked recently. I have been very happy with
my current local ISP.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;And
&gt; &gt;in all cases the problems to which I am  referring have been related to
&gt; &gt;service in the non strictly techinical sense(ie not bandwidth pronblems,
&gt; &gt;or constant busy signal, or dropouts - though I have epxerinecd those, but
&gt; &gt;that was fair given the account style). The problem has always been
&gt; &gt;treatment of users, staff cluelessness about their products unshceduled
&gt; &gt;outages that could have been scheduled,poor billing, etc etc.
&gt; &gt;In other words all things that could have been fixed with interested
&gt; &gt;managemnt and forthought, for growth which was obviouly not planned for
&gt; &gt;when the enterprise started.
&gt; 
&gt; Yep. You've neatly encapsulated what separates Internode from many 
&gt; other ISP's. Thanks again for putting it so well :)
&gt; 
&gt; We try very, very hard indeed in exactly the areas you say that you want.

So if internode can be succesuful and survive, so can another player with
the same attention to users?

Jason
