&gt; access will be restricted to local

&gt; I reckon this is reasonable evidence that some ISPs offer this traffic
&gt; diferrenciation.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is enough evidence to suggest that this type of traffic
&gt; differentiation is not just outrageous local urban internet myth.

The Senet offering is 'not really' differentiated traffic. If you
download 249Mb of traffic from the proxy in a month, you've still paid
the full price for the bandwidth. It's more like cutting off the account
when it hits the limit, and then making it partially useful for the
remainder of the month by throwing a few low-cost bones to the customer
who downloaded too much. It also doesn't seem to allow SAIX traffic
(since FTP from Senet to a SAIX ISP fails when the quota is reached).

I think iinet in Perth first offered this style of account. 

If Telstra could make wholesale ADSL pricing reasonable, and tails into
their exchange even more reasonable, we'll see more of this kind of
thing on broadband services which will be a great thing for everyone
except the leeches.

Like Simon said, if anyone can come up with an easily implemented and
cost-effective differentiated traffic accounting system that scales to
hundreds of simultaneous users without affecting the performance of the
service, I'd like to hear about it.
