David,

&gt;I remember someone having DNS trouble themselves, and they only had a
&gt;small system.
It wasn't DNS troubles, rather it was that I had no idea about DNS and 
wanted to set up a primary NS.
&gt;I remember that they needed someone else's help - and that
&gt;someone else is still willing to help by the way - to get it down pat.

Thankyou, it is pretty 'down pat' now, I have kinda learned how to config 
bind and zone files. They are kinda easy now that I have got used to the way 
the config files work. Hey I am even setting up some servers for some 
friends and also for some businesses!!!! not bad considering I only started 
using Linux about a month before the installfest. And I owe a lot of that 
learning to people like you on this list that blatantly assist new people, 
despite their somewhat cumbersome and repetitive questions sometimes :-) 
(me!!)

&gt;Given that someone (i.e. YOU Michael) asked for and received help on a
&gt;worldwide minor DNS problem, I'm sure you'd understand that if you were
&gt;to maintain a network as large as Telstra's that you might get things
&gt;back to front every now and then.

I understand this, but then again, Telstra has been slipping consistently 
over the past few months/years/whatever, and with the billions of dollars of 
profit that they are making they should be able to put a bit of money into 
QoS for existing customers.

&gt;So I suggest you don't start pointing fingers at Telstra because they
&gt;get a MINOR point wrong...and that if you think you should point fingers
&gt;at Telstra that the TIO is the person to talk to. Not us.

I am not pointing fingers, I just though it was humerous so I though I would 
share a bit of humor with this list!!! but if you don't like humor then 
well, I dunno ;-D

&gt;Domine O venite O sacramentum eo deo
&gt;Domine O venite O sacramentum eo deo
&gt;Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum.
&gt;Sacramentum eo deo

What does this mean anyway!!!!




Regards,

Michael
