Because we have competition laws in this country which ensure that
a monopoly provider can't use its market dominance to wipe its 
competitors off the map.

The only reason Telstra would be in a financial position to offer a 
$100 per month "unlimited" account would be because they're in a 
monopoly position - And that monopoly hasn't been given to them 
due to the possibility that they're better than everyone else, it's
been given to them by a historical accident, by virtue of the fact that
they were the Government monopoly telephone provider and they still 
own 100% of the country's local loops and almost all of the rest of
its telecommunications infrastructure.

What you're proposing is to remove the antitrust shackles from them.
If they were allowed to offer a $100 per month unlimited-everything
account, every single ISP in Australia except Telstra would go bankrupt
overnight.  There's simply no way to compete with that, the entire
industry would be decimated, and there'd be no hope whatsoever for
anything resembling telecommunications competition to *ever* exist in
this country.

If you think that's an acceptable outcome, then I'm glad you're in a 
minority.  It'd mean you're willing to trade short-term benefits for
long-term destruction, and that's not really a sane and rational view
I'm capable of supporting.
