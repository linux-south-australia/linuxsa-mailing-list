David,

I should clarify my position.  I understand that there are economic requirements - I just fail to see why people should just sit down and accept things the way they are.  Sure people around the world are worse off than we are - however - we did not get to where we are by never changing anything.

What about caching?  Some ISPs offer unlimited download from their cache or newsgroup.  I would have absolutely no problem keeping many downloads to a cache if this was not taken off my cap.  At the moment with my present ISP - newsgroups and cache is still considered a download.

Perhaps an ISP could work on requests - if many people have indicated an interest in a particular ISO for Linux - then they could cache it.  An intelligent cache would notice 10 people downloading from one site and then cache it and then redirect requests to the cache instead.  I have always seen a major burden on the Internet as being people downloading the one item over and over again.  I would be the first person to support such a move as it would mean that yes - I can leach (from the internal network) and it would be a hell of a lot faster.

What about (correct me if I am mistaken) IPv6 or mbone?  I recall reading an article in the Australian about multicasting audio and video streams down the net.  I could not care if I had to wait 10 minutes or half an hour or whatever for the next multicast to start.  It strikes me as incredibly inefficient that we will have a server sending out audio streams to thousands and computers simultaneously - often passing identical data streams through one ISPs network.

This seems to be a terrible burden on the Internet and ISPs.  I have always wondered why something has not been done about it.

If an ISP could offer cache services which are covered by the standard membership fee and say 500mb - 1gb of 'free range' or 'non-cached' access per month.  Clearly - if a good caching system was put in - less bandwidth would be consumed and a higher cap could be provided as a result and leachers (like myself) would think twice about downloading non-cache material when it may very well be available for free from the cache.

I understand that for smaller ISPs this could be difficult - so perhaps they would need to group together and pool their caches.

Customer is happy - can leach (and and at a faster rate as news servers, caches, etc are local) and the ISP is happier (much more efficient use of bandwidth).

Please correct me on the technical details as I will confess I know very little of what is requried.

I hope this is a little more constructive.

&gt;Okay, but don't whinge.  If you really believe something can be done
&gt;about it then tell us what that something is.  You can't blame Telstra
