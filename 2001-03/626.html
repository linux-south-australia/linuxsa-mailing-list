I'd beg to differ slightly, from personal experience.
Admittedly I'm a tech & use Linux all the time, so I'd say that 
I find Linux easy to install (personally i use Mandrake for 
workstation tasks, and have very few complaints for 'ease of use')

Recently I've had a bit to do with a uni student who 
bought a new PC, preinstalled with Windows of course,
This is a guy who has been using dos & windows 3.1 up til about 
6 months ago.
He needs to ftp assignments back & forth, he's doing programming, 
but is not a gui desktop literate sort of user if you know what 
I mean.

He got hold of the APC pocketbook, installed Mandrake, and has been 
using it (mdk) ever since.  (The reason I got involved was because a Windows
user came along & tried to "fix" his PC and in the process killed off
the MBR & corrupted his FAT32 partition.......!!!)

The main thing he liked about Mandrake was it was EASY to install, he
liked the 1/2 hour install as opposed to 3 reboots & 1 1/2 hours for 
Windows 98, he liked the fact that all the applications he needed were
already there editors, ftp progs etc, ie: didnt have to install ANYTHING
after installing the OS, he liked the fact that connecting to the net
was so EASY........remember this guy is relatively new to both Windows 9x &
Linux...
The only thing he was disappointed about was that he couldnt find 
any way of installing his scanner, so he's still using Windows for that.

As a footnote, I certainly believe that Linux could be made easier from 
the average user's point of view.  Its mainly for the user coming straight
from the Windoze 9x environment (which let's face it, is 99% of users)
who expect everything to be there & working & easy to install, even if 
it does crash every 5 minutes.  The biggest plus is that Linux as a whole
is improving at a far greater rate than Windows, so if a part of it is not
user-friendly today, more than likely it will be tomorrow :-)

I think one of the main problems avg users have with Linux is the filesystem
structure, the lack of a "A:, C:, D:, dump all programs in Program Files"
kind of thing.
Device locations are another caveat for the average user.  
It all comes down to what people are used to I guess, and avg users
generally dont 
want to learn something new if it means change, even if it is better.

Subject: Anyone konw of project for making Linux easier to install


Before you reply I am not interested in the usual and "under cooked"
responses of GNOME and KDE or use Mandrake etc etc etc.

I just keep reading articles in magazines regarding how hard linux is to
install ( not that I agree with that, so I might add for the average user
). I was wondering whether anyone out there has heard of a project that
aims for easy of installation for the Desktop User?. Is this something that
the Linux Standard Base (LSB) project is tackling?

GNOME and KDE are making Linux more usable GUI's for the AU (average user)
but not easier to install.

Any thoughts?
