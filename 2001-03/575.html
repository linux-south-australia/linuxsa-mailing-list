We took on a client with a aging Micro$oft based peer-to-peer LAN with about
15 Windows 9x & 2k workstations all sharing stuff off each other and of the
so called Windows NT (worksation) server.

The system was badly in need of an upgrade and we gave them a Linux server
option or a NT server option, surprise they went for the Linux option.

We told the customer to support the Win 2k worksations we would have to put
in some very new cutting edge software (Samba-TNG) and that we had tested in
our own office and we used it everyday and all seemed to run ok. This was
part of our proposal and they agreed.

Ok ever had one of those sites where EVERYTHING goes wrong about 3-6 months
after the initial install AAARRGGGHHH!!!!

After quite a number of other things (i.e not Samba-TNG) related to
service-level-agreements etc. had hit the fan they got another firm in to
audit the system.

Next they are on the phone to us, and having not much else to bitch about
(we had done a good job) they started in on:

"...our audit shows that Samba-TNG is an ALPHA piece of software, how could
you dare run that on our mission critical production site it's not even
BETA! ... rant, rave, rant etc etc."

Anyways that was the background, here's the question for the folks on the
list who are out there selling and installing Linux solutions.

How much do you tell your clients?
Lots of stuff in Linux is on the "bleeding edge" and in a state of flux.
There is stuff I wouldn't put on a clients site in a screaming fit, but
other things must be installed and I not sure how much of say a Linux 6.2
basic server install is classed as "stable"?

Regards,

Patrick Browne
