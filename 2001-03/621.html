&gt;Before you reply I am not interested in the usual and "under cooked"
&gt;responses of GNOME and KDE or use Mandrake etc etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;I just keep reading articles in magazines regarding how hard linux is to
&gt;install ( not that I agree with that, so I might add for the average user
&gt;). I was wondering whether anyone out there has heard of a project that
&gt;aims for easy of installation for the Desktop User?. Is this something that
&gt;the Linux Standard Base (LSB) project is tackling?

Making software easier to install (and run!) for users is one of the
major goals of the LSB. However, it currently doesn't attempt to cover
everything - eg whilst the basic X libraries are included in the
specification, gnome and kde are not.

Personally I think that the both gnome and kde are probably moving too
fast at the moment to make it worthwhile tieing down in a
specification.

With many of the core libraries (eg libc etc), package format, unix
commands and directory/file hierarchy covered things should get much
easier once the specification is released and the distros/ISVs start
following it.

If you want to know more about the LSB I suggest you have a look at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org.">http://www.linuxbase.org.</A> A beta release of the specification is due
to be released in a couple of weeks time and the more people looking
through it and giving constructive feedback the better and more useful
it will turn out.

Chris.
