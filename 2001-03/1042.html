&gt;I have a machine that I just put back in use, 
&gt;an AMD K6-2/400 with an Award BIOS from 1998.
&gt;
&gt;It could not probe the 16GB IDE disk I put in it, 
&gt;but was fine with an 8.4GB drive.

Richard,

I ran into a similar problem after installing a 2.1GB 
HDD in my 10-year old laptop. And just to complicate things,
I needed to be able to run Linux or DOS or Windows as needed.

The laptop BIOS needed Toshiba's version of Disk Manager to
see the whole HDD, but Disk Manager & LILO don't get along. 
Here's how I got around it:

 - Installed the Disk Manager.

 - Installed DOS/Windows but didn't use the entire HDD capacity
for this partition.

 - Installed Linux in the remaining HDD space; and before quitting 
Linux, copied the kernel image (vmlinuz) to a DOS floppy.

 - In DOS, created a C:\LINUX directory; copied the kernel image to it,
and copied LOADLIN.EXE (from a Linux CD) into the same directory.

 - To use Linux, I boot to a DOS prompt and then run LOADLIN 
with the appropriate switches for my setup.


Chances are your HDD manufacturer has Disk Manager or equivalent 
available
from their website. If you're not planning to dual-boot, you might try 
using a 5MB DOS partition (to hold LOADLIN etc) and use the other 
15.995GB 
for Linux.

Speaking of partitions, many Linuxes required the partition holding /root 
to 
reside entirely within the first 1024 cylinders. I think the recent 
Linuxes 
have overcome this limitation, but it might require BIOS support too?

The K6-2 should work fine. My K6-2 550 is detected as a "586" by RedHat 
6.1. 
I have found, however, that some "686"-specific stuff refused to run. So 
if I'm grabbing binary RPMs I just go for the 386 versions.

BTW there's a good introduction to HDD capacity limitations for 
various OSs on Maxtor's website:

They even mention Linux :)


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
