&gt; So if a client wants e-mail/calendering with all the bells & whistles it's

&gt; either a M$ Exchange or Novell Groupwise solution?

Check out Teamware Office.
Runs on NT or Linux, obviously the preferred platform
would be Linux ;-)

<A HREF="http://office.teamware.com">http://office.teamware.com</A>

While it may not be as enterprise-ready (ie: scalable to 
10,000s of users) as say.............Groupwise, Openmail,
Notes, or &lt;choke&gt; Exchange, its very suited to small-medium
sized installations.
To make a (very) long story short, we were looking for a 
groupware solution last year to substitute for our infamous
gov. email access (Exchange server farm) which from Port 
Lincoln is woefully inadequate.
The solution also needed to replace our increasingly unreliable
calendaring system running on MS Schedule version 1.0.

We looked at Openmail (v6) & were very impressed because it
slotted in with our existing Outlook clients, however for 
our relatively small user base it was too expensive to justify.
So we tried Teamware, and at US$1000 per 100 users, its not exactly
breaking the bank in comparison to Exchange/Openmail, tho if the 
dollar keeps sinking it might!
For various reasons we have been unable to get our mail system off
the ground as yet (dont ask! the reason is usually sticky & sometimes
red......),
but it functions extremely well for calendaring, it also has the 
other stuff such as forums, library, organisation directory ie: the usual 
groupware features, most of which we havent used to their full capacity yet.
The only disadvantage to Teamware (or advantage depending on how 
you look at it) is that if we kept Outlook as the client it would
only be as a POP3 or IMAP client, as the calendar sharing doesnt
work thru Outlook.
Teamware has its own client software, Windows-based, and also a very
nice web client, which is almost but not quite as good as the 
standalone client.
Also, if you compare it to Openmail, its a piece of cake to install
& configure on Linux :-)
