&gt; My god.  What an open-minded and accepting group of people we are.

Perhaps you should visit the archives and check out what went on.  As I 
mentioned there has been only one "eviction", so yes, I do think we're pretty 
laid back, open minded and accepting.
 
&gt; Are we suggesting *censorship* now?

Not at all.  Like Richard's previous post mentioned, the list contains people 
with a wide range of interests and beliefs, and perhaps the only thing common 
is Linux and open source, and as long as posts are somewhere near topic people 
are very accepting and tolerant.

But being a member of the list has it's rights and responsibilities, and if the 
majority of the list doesn't like what's being posted and the person has been 
told that and they don't stop, I think the list should have the right to 
remove the posting priveledges of that person.

Is that censorship?  In one sense maybe.  But in another it's not IMHO.  I 
respect the right of people to have opinions different to me, but I'm not happy 
for all of them to scream them at the top of their lungs in my lounge room.  
The list is a bit like that.  It's a community, and consequently the community 
more or less has the right to agree what goes on inside that community.  There 
are plenty of other forums available for people to express opinions on topics 
that aren't linux or open source related.

I'll shutup now before I'm told to :-)
