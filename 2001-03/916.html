Ian,

I think what you fail to see is that there is more to this whole issue
than meets the eye. Accept that the people that you are talking to are
extremely cabable and knowlegable in this department. Don't go getting
snaky with these people because they're shooting down your argument.
They're in the business. They know first hand the ups and downs of the
business.

&gt; What is it with you and the whole 'ISP owner' camp?
&gt; 
&gt; Do I need to spell it out? I am no longer talking about
&gt; 'unlimited accounts' and I have already told you that I
&gt; am quite happy to pay once for caching so that others to use what I have already downloaded.  I made some
&gt; incorrect assumptions and I have corrected them.
&gt; Please advise me directly if you require me to remind
&gt; you once per day.
&gt; 
&gt; Why are you people so passionate about shooting this
&gt; argument down that I have to re-state what I have
&gt; already said 3 or 4 times before you listen?
&gt; 
&gt; Are you afraid of something?  Hiding something?  Why
&gt; are you attacking us and forgetting that we have
&gt; listened to you and changed our position?
&gt; 
&gt; Most people are going through Telstra anyhow.  I have
&gt; spoken to many people who use Telstra and they have
&gt; not had any troubles when the devil posesses them and
&gt; they go on a leaching rampage for a night.
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the level of fear and hostility that I would
&gt; recieve from a local ISP when I ask questions or make
&gt; suggestions - why should I support a local ISP?
&gt; 
&gt; I would have thought - unless there is some sort of
&gt; status quo that you need to protect - that you would
&gt; have supported us if we came up with ideas that can
&gt; lower costs for ISPs and we were trying to help you as
&gt; well as ourselves.
