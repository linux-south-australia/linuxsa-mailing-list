Corey!

&gt; People are hesitant to purchase this since they feel $79 is a lot to pay
&gt; for a (6 user?) pdf when 'that information is available on the web'.

How much is your time worth? Let me have a guess...$30 US an hour. If
you can't find the information you need in approximately 2.75 hours then
$79 is worth it. It's as simple as that.

&gt; Since I am having a hard time convincing them that its worth the $79 to
&gt; have all the information in one spot.  Mentioning that you can't put a
&gt; price on security just got me odd looks...

If they think that $79 presumably US dollars is too much to pay for
security then personally I'd give up in despair. Just how much is their
data and systems worth? Why do people consider fires and physical theft
"real" and pay huge insurance premiums against them, not to mention
special insulation, smoke alarms, security systems but then turn around
and leave their data insecure because "it costs too much"?

That is total CRAP. Utter and pure CRAP.

Let me hazard a guess. You're running a University. What could I do to a
University if I broke into its security systems:

1) Impersonate Your Staff

I could have your Professor of Theology predict that the world will end
because Nostradamus says so. And he'd look like a total dolt.

2) Steal Your Research

And get the credit, maybe even major contracts out of it.

3) Plain Blow Up Your Computers

By fdformatt'ing the drives, overdriving monitors

And I could do all types of things to attract a police forces attention,
such as host child pornography and so forth. I could distribute a
Napster system without your knowledge; but whether that would stand up
when the University got sued is a different question. ESPECIALLY if the
University took no obvious steps to ensure the staff taking care of its
security were able to do so.

Another tack you may want to take is to convince your friendly librarian
to buy a security book for your University's library. And being a staff
member, I presume you'd be able to borrow it. If you can't - and if
they're wobbling about paying $79 for a security book I wouldn't be
surprised - get a student to borrow it on your behalf.

Security is priceless.

Send the accountants to <A HREF="http://www.auscert.org/">http://www.auscert.org/</A> and get them to put a
cost on the information.

Or better still, go piss off a security list which will have the almost
certain effect of having one or more people attempt to crack your
system. When they do - and they will - they'll probably blow your system
up and you can have what I term a "Jewish Stock Take". At that stage -
stick your tongue out at the accountants.

I can't stand economic rationalists.

Tell them to stop paying insurance too. That's way more than $79...
