Hi Ian,
I run a SOHO. I have on OS/2 box running PPPoE & NAT & a LAN,
(Loungeroom Area Network).
My housemate, Jud is a Film-Maker/Director, so he is pulling previews &
all sorts of large files.
My usage last month was 3GB!
Seriously, with the amount of time I spent fiddling around with iPrimus,
one has to question its impact on my time devoted to work:- income
generating activities.
It seems OK, today, but next week who knows.

ADSL is still "bleeding edge" in Australia, its not just the technology,
but the corporate & social impact of this technology.
The ISPs aren't quite sure where it fits in & at what cost level.
Support people are far & few between.
The network guys are still learning how to make it work.

I've probably reached the stage were I know the problems with their
service & also the limitations of my equipment.

The PPPoE client on my dedicated gateway seems to stay connected for a
week-or-so, usually reconnects if the link is terminated & occasionally
dies completely & nothing but a reboot will fix it. This is known & the
fix is known, I don't have to waste anytime doing problem determination
anymore.

It is also known iPrimus have packet problems & a quick work-around is
to use the Telstra proxy:
sydney.cache.telstra.net:3128

It is also known iPrimus DNS have hiccups, I can fallback to Telstra
DNSes if I have to.

The QoS of iPrimus sucks, both technically & administratively.

To this end, I *also* have an internal v90 modem in my gateway & can
fall-back to another ISP:- dialix.com.

I think iPrimus are at a tolerable cost/performance point, but put your
business hat on & make sure you have a fallback option.

&gt; Are you using iPrimus ADSL at home?  How are you finding the service now?
&gt; 
&gt; Their pricing is by far the best although their quality of service (customer and network) is crap.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been using iPrimus dialup for over a year and a half and can only use Mozilla as any other mail program stalls the connection and I have to disconnect and then re-connect again.
&gt; 
&gt; I am very VERY wary of signing up for any 12 month contract (where I am obliged to pay out the rest in event of crap service and their ADSL contact (Michael) ran off when I started asking questions.
&gt; 
&gt; That is a VERY dodgy company although their prices are excellent.
