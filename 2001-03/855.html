Hi Folks,

I got to wondering if LWN was actually making enough money from its
advertising to support the wonderful stuff they do. As a result of this, I
thought about some other funding models they could use.

I think that LWN is such a valuable resource to me, and this can often only
be determined after reading it for a while. 

If LWN said to me that they can no longer afford to offer the service
unless I part with some money each year, then I think the service is so
useful, that I would be prepared to pay something like USD20-40 a year for
that service.

It might perhaps be for an advanced service where the LWN info is sent to
me as a mail message every week, or something like that.

So, while I know absolutely nothing about what is going on at LWN, if you
agree that their service is useful to you, I would ask that you reply and
tell me whether or not you agree here.


Regards
