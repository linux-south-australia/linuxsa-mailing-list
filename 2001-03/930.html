There are a number of roumours around about Intel's being more reliable with
Linux than Intel. I have found this to be a little far fetched. All the new
kernels have to option to complie specific for amd cpus. I have run many
amd's both with win and linunx, and in both windoze and linux the AMD's are
far more reliable, they are much faster, and their cheaper. Unless you have
specific application for an integrated all-in-one video/sound etc there is
absolutely no reason why to choose celeron/piii over amd. The original
irongate chipset was a bit troublesome, and the kta133 ide performance
didn't quite compare to intel 82815 chipset, but with the kta-2 this was
resolved, and now with the new kta-3 133 chipset boards, they now have 4
dimm sockets.
In summary i would ALWAYS choose AMD over intel. There is very little price
difference in motherboards too now, and any difference far outways the price
difference between the cpus !

Subject: AMD vs Intel


Hi
i'm looking at building myself a new computer. I have $1000 to spend and i
can easily get everything i need within this price.

I am looking at the AMD CPU's and i was just wondering ( with all the news
about amd beating intel etc) are the AMD chips as reliable as the intel
ones??

Do they feature about the same speed as that of an intel? greater or less?


Thanx in Advance,
Adam W.
