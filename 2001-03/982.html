&gt; This is not a piece of computer code we are writing here, we deal with real
&gt; people with different fears, aspirations, strengths and weaknesses.  If you
&gt; fail to see how your post was bullshit, even though lots of people agreed with
&gt; my observation, then you have been in front of a computer way too long.

Obviously you are confused between "lots" and "a few."

I take exception when you say that what I posted was bullshit.  If you
claimed that it was a harsh way of putting the truth I would not argue.
But you say what I said was bullshit.  Bullshit, like crap, implies
an inaccuracy.  This is the second time you have made this (libelous)
claim.  I asked you before what was inaccurate and you did not reply.
Are you knowingly and willfully accusing me of inaccuracy when you know
what I said to be correct?


&gt; If you [are] incapable of providing help [...] in a manner suitable for
&gt; humans don't reply, we will figure out the answer without you

I provide help in a manner emminently suitable for humans.  How ridiculous
to imply otherwise.  As to figuring out the answer without me: That's
equally ridiculous, because it's self-evident; even though the point in
question is a recurring mistake...  But Stephen, if you don't want to
hear my pearls of wisdom, don't let me stand between you and the door.
(Please close it quietly behind you.)
