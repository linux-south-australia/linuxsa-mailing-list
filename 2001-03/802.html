&gt; This is where I can relate this flame war to Linux - this is something we
&gt; should ALL care about and few of us seem to be paying serious attention
&gt; to this.

Um, no thanks.  LinuxSA is a hobbyist group, pretty much following
in the tradition of PC User Groups and, prior to them, the ham
radio clubs.

PCUGs have never lobbied for Compaq, nor have ham radio clubs
lobbied for SA-FM.

I agree that there needs to be a lobbying organisation for
free software in Australia.  But really, AUUG is the obvious
home for that organisation.

Once in a while I get enthused and do some lobbying.  But I don't
like it and are nowhere as near as effective as the people whom I
see paid to lobby (usually, unfortunately, for the Other Side).

&gt; Why are public institutions investing so much money in to propriatry
&gt; infrastructure when there are cheaper and more reliable alernatives
&gt; such as Linux - is it a cost or marketing issue?

Both.  Linux isn't necessarily cheaper as the sticker price
of software rarely reflects its total cost of ownership.  The
TCO of an operating system is very dependant upon the applications
and ease of maintenance of the operating system.  For example,
apt-get and RPM probably do more to reduce the ownership cost
of Linux than anything to do with the kernel or libraries.

Linux's maintenance features are better than Windows, but are
worse than those of NetWare.  For example, consider a network
of 3000 machines and add a new user.

Your claim towards greater reliability is also suspect: the
world's most reliable operating system is IBM's propietary
MVS/ESA.  And, personally, at this stage of the development
of Linux I hope that MVS/ESA is what is looking after my
bank account.

I would hope that the government acts pragmatically
and selects the best operating system/application
combination for each tasks, with an eye to TCO and
a broader IT strategy.  Linux has a role in that,
but it's progress should really be because of its
suitability to task rather than by edict.

If you want to see what happens when IT is decided by
edict, look at the federal government's IT outsourcing.
We don't what Linux to be the cause of that degree of
disruption and inefficiency.

What I *would* like the government to do more is to pass
sane legislation that doesn't discriminate against
Linux.  And that's not what is happening at the moment.

The lack of an effective Canberra-based lobbying body
is leaving the Microsoft-funded BSAA with an open
playing field.  You can see one result of this in the
very odd Senate report into software piracy.

It's really up to the Linux vendors (and I include
IBM and Compaq in those) to come to the party and
fund a real lobbyist.  Ironically, IBM already pays
someone in Canberra to lobby for IBM's interests;
that person obviously hasn't been reading IBM's
Linux script.

&gt; What advantage is their to having the applications on
&gt; one mega server and using existing desktop machines
&gt; running the x server only (ie - as thin clients).

X is a poor thin client technology.  But Linux offers
a huge range of more appropiate choices, with Java
and RPC springing to mind.

&gt; One thing is that if security and reliability are
&gt; ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL then is this solution preferable
&gt; to Windows 2000?

Huh?

Windows 2000 and Linux are rather similar operating systems.
Mega-kernel, C libraries, memory management, filesystem
orientation, etc.

Again the difference is in TCO.  And the killer in big
installations for Win2000 is that the department's IT
section, no matter how motivated, cannot fix a Win2000
showstopper bug.

The other major difference is in the applications.
Linux applications tend to be Internet-savvy.  They
don't trust other computers.  They don't execute code
sent to them.

The real reliability and security issues are with the
Win2000 applications.  Being written in the Microsoft
monoculture they simply aren't resilient enough for
sustained deployment in a hostile environment.

One side-effect of this is that Windows systems
need firewalling from the Internet, a significant
cost.  Especially in Canberra where the Icon
network allows gigabit ethernet connectivity
between the government departments.  It also
leads to "crunchy outside, soft inside" networks
where a single penetration leaves open the
entire network.
