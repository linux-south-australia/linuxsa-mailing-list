David,

I've been looking at UPSs and thinking about it for a long time.
(Since 1985 actually.)
Can you (or anyone else) recommend one or more brands in terms
of their usefulness for linux?

The few I've seen in the stores until now have looked rather
clumsy, and I had no idea how I would make them work with linux.

I've followed various discussions in linuSA about UPSs over the 
years. But I don't remember any specific recommendations of 
a good, cheap UPS for home use for, say, two PCs.

SuSE now has a list of about 90 supported USP types and 20 unsupported.
But I often find that in Adelaide, the brands are not on
the European/US brand lists.

On the SuSE UPS support list, they mention that the Meta ECO 750 has
kernel support! But none of the other 90 UPS types have this.

Hmmm. A bit looking around reveals "man powerd", which describes
a nifty utility to get the OS down to single-user in the event of
a pwoer failure.
And the famous Alessandro Rubini seems to be the main author of it.

There's even a UPS-HOWTO! With 3696 lines!!

Okay.
Now all I need is a store where I can browse and buy.
I tried one store a while back and found some obscure
Australian-manufactured brand that is not in any listing
anywhere that I've seen.

--------------------------------------------------
Question:
Can anyone recommend a store or stores in Adelaide
for the purposes of linux UPS browsing?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I wonder if the new ETSA owner has shares in a UPS company?!
I wonder too if the members of a certain political party
might have such shares - but I have no info on this.
Only suspicions on a "who benefits" basis.
