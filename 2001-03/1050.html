I certainly will keep you posted.  By in-house - are
you suggesting that out-sourcing may not be the best
solution?

I will declare a conflict of interest in that I work
for a large out sourcing company - although I did seek
employment here initially as I believe out-sourcing
is a very good concept IF managed well and for the 
right reasons.  The idea is not to privatise and sell
of public assets - the idea is to generate economies
of scale - purchasing power - centralisation and a more
efficient use of resources.  Now - I am willing to
stand corrected on this - I will confess that I am not
an expert in the field - but I do believe out-sourcing
has a future.

However - I whole-heartedly agree with your objective
approach to *nix.  While I am frustrated with the 
closed door attitude of many from the MS family - I
am frustrated by the eagerness of SOME *nix users to 
gloat about victories but not put in the hard effort
to make it happen more.  Too many times I have
mentioned the 'L' word (linux) to support people or 
managers and their eyes have rolled before I say 
anything at all.  I think many IT managers are and
other managers are frustrated with the passion of 
Linux people which can be mis-interpreted as
stubborness.

All the passion in the world won't stand up against
thorough documentation on why MS is better.

I am still yet to check out the Linux advocacy sites -
I am sure that much of this is already taking place.

This is just my 2.2 cents worth (inc GST).
