Oh man, so many statements, so many simple questions with complex answers.

The short summary (you're welcome to stop here):

&gt;I should clarify my position.  I understand that there are economic 
&gt;requirements - I just fail to see why people should just sit down 
&gt;and accept things the way they are.  Sure people around the world 
&gt;are worse off than we are - however - we did not get to where we are 
&gt;by never changing anything.
&gt;
&gt;What about caching?  Some ISPs offer unlimited download from their 
&gt;cache or newsgroup.  I would have absolutely no problem keeping many 
&gt;downloads to a cache if this was not taken off my cap.  At the 
&gt;moment with my present ISP - newsgroups and cache is still 
&gt;considered a download.

You're ignoring/underestimating several issues here, including;

- separating local vs non local traffic on your bill is a complex and 
difficult task. And even if an ISP gets it right, you'll probably 
dispute it. How do you decide whether to believe your ISP? How does 
your ISP fund the very considerable expense of the systems and staff 
time needed to develop and test a differentiated charging system for 
dialup customers, for one single outcome - charging the customer less 
per month.

It's cheaper (for everyone) to just charge the customer less per 
month and be done with it - and if you aren't living under a rock, 
you'll notice practically all ISP's getting progressively cheaper 
over time, sometimes dramatically so. This is a more cost effective 
way to handle the situation for all concerned - let the marketplace 
be a marketplace - and avoid disputes about whether that last 
megabyte came from a local or a remote source.

- the average sale price of a megabyte of traffic already includes 
discounts related to the savings from running a cache. So the logical 
foil to paying less for 'local' traffic is paying more for non-local 
traffic. Is that ok with you (I'm sure it isn't, but then again 
nothing seems to be ok other than charging nothing for everything - 
which is fine, you should sign up with Global Freeway. Oops, they 
just went under. Golly, I wonder why that is? Don't you?)

The simplest, most equitable, mechanism is to just count total bytes, 
and be reasonable about the average charge per byte.

Caches, and local peering, and other creative approaches to sourcing 
traffic are all ways than ISP's work to keep themselves financially 
viable and to keep being able to adjust pricing downward over time.

&gt;Perhaps an ISP could work on requests - if many people have 
&gt;indicated an interest in a particular ISO for Linux - then they 
&gt;could cache it.  An intelligent cache would notice 10 people 
&gt;downloading from one site and then cache it and then redirect 
&gt;requests to the cache instead.  I have always seen a major burden on 
&gt;the Internet as being people downloading the one item over and over 
&gt;again.  I would be the first person to support such a move as it 
&gt;would mean that yes - I can leach (from the internal network) and it 
&gt;would be a hell of a lot faster.

The factors I noted above tend to get in the way somewhat.

Caches do provide the sort of effect you're suggesting, all by 
themselves. Other approaches, such as Akamai servers 
(<A HREF="http://www.akamai.com">http://www.akamai.com</A>) also help an ISP provide a higher formance, 
more cost effective outcome. But in all cases, remember than the 
discounts achieved by an ISP via these mechanisms are generally 
*already factored into their pricing*.

Caches have another huge positive effect, which is to speed up 
download rates for popular content. This is the other wide of the win 
for the ISP (in traffic saving) is a win for their customers (in 
improved download performance, especially visible on broadband pipes 
but also visible to some extent on dialup).

&gt;
&gt;What about (correct me if I am mistaken) IPv6 or mbone?  I recall 
&gt;reading an article in the Australian about multicasting audio and 
&gt;video streams down the net.  I could not care if I had to wait 10 
&gt;minutes or half an hour or whatever for the next multicast to start. 
&gt;It strikes me as incredibly inefficient that we will have a server 
&gt;sending out audio streams to thousands and computers simultaneously 
&gt;- often passing identical data streams through one ISPs network.
&gt;
&gt;This seems to be a terrible burden on the Internet and ISPs.  I have 
&gt;always wondered why something has not been done about it.

Because you're not appreciating the huge, huge financial burden on an 
ISP in taking on the mbone multicast feed. The thing is on 24x7. It's 
just like tv in the sense you're implying above - so if your ISP is 
taking on a (conservatively) 6 megabit+ per second continuous data 
stream, 24x7, costing them (conservatively) about $250,000 per month 
in download/pipe fees, on the off chance that you *might feel like* 
watching one of those streams every now and then - explain to us how 
this is going to make your ISP able to offer you a more affordable 
internet experience?

Lets say we had 10,000 customers, that means in turning on the feed, 
I'm taking on an extra $25 per month, per customer, in costs, just on 
that off chance that you want to watch the shuttle launch this week.

Sure, that dog will hunt (not).

Instead, you can cost me money on an 'on demand' basis, and yes, this 
leads to some 'waste' of bandwidth but guess what - against that 
multi-megabit per second firehose, it's actually cheaper for me, and 
better for you ( you get it on demand, not 10 minutes later).

Also, I guarantee that for every one person who, like you, would wait 
10 minutes, there are 100 people who will change ISP's to one that 
lets them have their gratification *right now* instead.

&gt;If an ISP could offer cache services which are covered by the 
&gt;standard membership fee and say 500mb - 1gb of 'free range' or 
&gt;'non-cached' access per month.  Clearly - if a good caching system 
&gt;was put in - less bandwidth would be consumed and a higher cap could 
&gt;be provided as a result and leachers (like myself) would think twice 
&gt;about downloading non-cache material when it may very well be 
&gt;available for free from the cache.

See the original points I made above - differentiating traffic is 
hard to do for dialup customers. And how do I prove to you that my 
differentiation is right? How do you decide to believe me?

And all of this instead of just charging the equitable average cost 
per MB that we already do? Where's the win, exactly, in that?

There is only one simple, non-argumentitive way to do that, which 
involves having you log in via a different indial number when you 
want to access purely local sources, and charge a lower amount (not 
zero, because the costs are not zero!) for access to those local 
sources, and block all the non-local ones.

How long are you going to tolerate web pages that only half load up 
(because that was the half that was cached)? How long are you going 
to tolerate the local call fee and dialup time each time you switch 
over and back?

If there's a cleaner, *feasible* approach to this, I'm all ears. 
There are technically complex manners we can employ using 
technologies such as Cisco's netflow, all of which cost serious money 
to implement and all of which requires you to trust that I got it 
right. It'd be cheaper for me to do what I already do, and just pass 
on the saving in terms of average cost per MB being lower than it 
otherwise would be (can you see a pattern forming here?)

&gt;I understand that for smaller ISPs this could be difficult - so 
&gt;perhaps they would need to group together and pool their caches.

It doesn't work very well - this is based on experience, not guessing 
- and it doesn't help them differentiate the traffic on your bill 
either

&gt;
&gt;Customer is happy - can leach (and and at a faster rate as news 
&gt;servers, caches, etc are local) and the ISP is happier (much more 
&gt;efficient use of bandwidth).
&gt;
&gt;Please correct me on the technical details as I will confess I know 
&gt;very little of what is requried.

The technical details are exactly where the 'devil' is.

Wishing for things to be better doesn't fix anything.

Also, in all of this, there is a huge failure to recall where we've 
all come from. A few years back a decent internet account cost 
$50-$90 per month for the equivalent of what today's 'unlimited' 
(not) accounts provide, now they're around $25 per month.

Two years ago the cheapest 2mb/s link around was $15,000-$30,000 per 
year ($1250-$2500 per month) across town (depending on distance), 
pipe-only, plus download fees. Today ADSL is around $130 per month 
for 1.5 mb/s peak transfer rates, including typically at least 500 
mb/s per month.

Good grief! If an order of magnitude drop in pricing in two years 
isn't enough to demonstrate that things are in fact getting better, 
and getting better fast, you're sitting in a different tree to the 
rest of us.

There is no conspiracy. There is only reality. Enjoy these huge (and 
continuing) improvements in price/performance, which will continue to 
occur (though they'll slow down a bit with the current state of the 
exchange rate - as a huge percentage of total Internet costs in 
Australia are related to International data transfer costs, which are 
priced, ultimately, in US dollars)
