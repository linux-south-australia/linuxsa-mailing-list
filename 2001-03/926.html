&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So if a client wants e-mail/calendering with all the bells & whistles it's
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; either a M$ Exchange or Novell Groupwise solution?
&gt; 
&gt; Check out Teamware Office.
&gt; Runs on NT or Linux, obviously the preferred platform
&gt; would be Linux ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://office.teamware.com">http://office.teamware.com</A>
&gt; 
&gt; While it may not be as enterprise-ready (ie: scalable to 
&gt; 10,000s of users) as say.............Groupwise, Openmail,
&gt; Notes, or &lt;choke&gt; Exchange, its very suited to small-medium
&gt; sized installations.
&gt; To make a (very) long story short, we were looking for a 
&gt; groupware solution last year to substitute for our infamous
&gt; gov. email access (Exchange server farm) which from Port 
&gt; Lincoln is woefully inadequate.
&gt; The solution also needed to replace our increasingly unreliable
&gt; calendaring system running on MS Schedule version 1.0.
&gt; 
&gt; We looked at Openmail (v6) & were very impressed because it
&gt; slotted in with our existing Outlook clients, however for 
&gt; our relatively small user base it was too expensive to justify.
&gt; So we tried Teamware, and at US$1000 per 100 users, its not exactly
&gt; breaking the bank in comparison to Exchange/Openmail, tho if the 
&gt; dollar keeps sinking it might!
&gt; For various reasons we have been unable to get our mail system off
&gt; the ground as yet (dont ask! the reason is usually sticky & sometimes
&gt; red......),
&gt; but it functions extremely well for calendaring, it also has the 
&gt; other stuff such as forums, library, organisation directory ie: the usual 
&gt; groupware features, most of which we havent used to their full capacity yet.
&gt; The only disadvantage to Teamware (or advantage depending on how 
&gt; you look at it) is that if we kept Outlook as the client it would
&gt; only be as a POP3 or IMAP client, as the calendar sharing doesnt
&gt; work thru Outlook.
&gt; Teamware has its own client software, Windows-based, and also a very
&gt; nice web client, which is almost but not quite as good as the 
&gt; standalone client.
&gt; Also, if you compare it to Openmail, its a piece of cake to install
&gt; & configure on Linux :-)
