David,

Look - don't get me wrong.  I have seen your set up and I am not in any way criticising ISPs which I view as victims - not perpetrators.  If I offended you - I apologise without reserve.  I did state - perhaps with not enough emphasis - that it is not smaller ISPs or even larger ones I am upset with - it is the backbone maintainer/s.  It is not Connect's fault they have to charge this.  Whose fault is it?  I think we all know.

It is the government and the backbone providers I am disappointed with.

With record profits and ADSL coming out in the early 1990s - Telstra decided to pump up its share price rather than invest in infrastructure and now they are only just starting to take their copper network seriously.

The government - for economic mis-management.  Our dollar is so pathetically low - that I am amazed any ISP can afford the equipment to set up at all!!

Our dollar is low because we are a third world commodity based economy with first world living styles. No one can tell me that the government never saw this coming - never considered a cut in R&D concessions a mistake - never considered wheat and other farming subsidies over communications infrastructure a mistake.  They were winning the vote and to hell with the country.

Our businesses and consumers pay ridiculous prices for hardware and software that never even works properly (Unix variants excepted of course).

Yeah I know that it as not as bad as it seems - I should be more optimistic - I should be more sympathetic and I am willing to stand corrected on everything that I am mistaken about.

But I am very disappointed that - for whatever reason - Australia is being ripped off - and it never had to be this way.

We have subsidies for an industry that is a hundred years old - why not subsidies or even tax concessions for a totally new industry - ISPs?

Perhaps we need a National Techonology Foundation to lobby against the National Farmers Federation for subsidies and tax concessions?

No one can tell me that we should just sit back and accept what is being thrown to us.  There must be something that can be done.

&gt;&gt; I have just had it with the whole home retail Internet industry in

&gt;
&gt;Why?  The charges for ASDL seem very reasonable to me, particularly
&gt;if they include 1GB per month.  You should do what I have done: Cost
&gt;a wholesale link and work out what retail rates should be.
&gt;
&gt;Let me put some actual figures to the discussion, because I think a
&gt;heck of a lot of people don't know how much it costs to run an ISP.
&gt;Pardon me for giving costs for 56k modems, but I have no idea of the
&gt;costs to provision ADSL.  I think the exercise is still useful, even if
&gt;it's slightly off topic.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   COSTS FOR 150 V.90 PORTS
&gt;
&gt;   INSTALLATION COST
&gt;   2Mbps link               $9,000
&gt;   Router                    4,000
&gt;   5 x OnRamp 30            15,000
&gt;   Modem server - 150 ports 45,000
&gt;                           -------
&gt;                           $73,000
&gt;
&gt;   Amortised installation cost, over 36 months
&gt;   per port per month:         $14
&gt;                           -------
&gt;
&gt;   RUNNING COST
&gt;   2Mbps link               $1,000
&gt;   OnRamp                    3,750
&gt;   Wages                     8,000
&gt;   Rent (pro-rated)            500
&gt;   Electricity, Insurance      100
&gt;                           -------
&gt;                           $13,350
&gt;
&gt;   Running cost per port per
&gt;   month:                      $89
&gt;                           -------
&gt;
&gt;   Total cost per port per
&gt;   month:                     $103
&gt;                           -------
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;Wholesale data cost per megabyte varies, but 12c is close to the mark.
&gt;With port costs around $100 per month, including zero bytes of pre-paid
&gt;data, how many megabytes of data do you expect per month for $25?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is not a FINITE resource - it is a resource that is only limited
&gt;&gt; by bandwidth and infrastructure costs.  And at the moment - bandwidth
&gt;&gt; and infrastructure costs are too high to justify ADSL at home.
&gt;
&gt;See this is where you are right: ADSL is an infinite resource, which is
&gt;why it's called "always on," and why you don't get charged on a time basis.
&gt;On the other hand, ADSL contains and generates zero content.  The content
&gt;comes via fibre, satellite or copper links, and costs truckloads of money
&gt;for sensible bandwidth.  That's what you are really being charged for; the
&gt;ADSL itself seems to me to be more-or-less free.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Get real
&gt;
&gt;Splendid advice.
