Hi All -- long unauthoritative rant ahead.

I think that a lot of people here don't "get" businesses. Businesses are not
there to provide services, or products, they are there to make profit for
their owners. There may be side goals of doing "things" well, or employing X
South Australians, but I'd be surprised to find a business that puts these
kinds of goals above making a profit (often, these other goals are part of
the way in which a company wants to make a profit -- eg, we will make profit
by employing talented people and giving them the best work environemnt etc).

Profit comes in two forms -- long term and short term (maybe medium term as
well... medium-long anyone? ). A business may decide to forgo short term
profit for long term profit, if they can afford to do that, and if they are
confident that they will come out better in the long run (consistent short
term profit becomes long term profit, of course).

Each business is run in the way that its owners decide to run it. The
business exists in a certain environment, and the owners and managers decide
how best to make profit in that environment. Different businesses have
subtley different environments (competing businesses are part of any
business' environment), and the people in charge choose different routes to
making money.

As consumers, we want a certain product or service, and we are willing to
pay up to a certain price for this. We have all sorts of other requirements
as well, and we just evaluate the offerings, and if one fulfills our needs
at our pricepoint, we make a purchase. If it doesn't, we can't do business.
We could tell business owners what we want, and if they all say that they
can't provide it (or don't want to), then tough bikkies. Unless there is a
profitable market in it, there is no point in a business selling to you.

This is how a Free Market Economy is supposed to work, and it works quite
well (unless you are a consumer wanting something no business sees a profit
in, but IMHO, that means it IS working well :)... Where it breaks down is in
monopolies. I think there are three main monopolies (or duopolies in cases,
or even panopolies?) in the Internet Industry in Australia -- the last mile
(copper to your door), the national backbone (peering cartel), and the USA.

To tackle the USA, all we can really do is give them an economic incentive
to consider us peers, and split the costs of international links. I don't
think this will happen. We don't register on their radar, and we don't
produce a lot of data that the US wants. Maybe we should have a linuxsa
USAweb site, and seduce the USA web traffic market... or maybe not...

To tackle the national backbone, we already have a quadopoly (the peering
cartel), so it's better than it could be... I think, again, this is really
up to individual ISPs to provide incentive for the cartel to peer with them.
They need to become content providers, and big ones. Maybe there's another
way, but I don't see it.

The last mile... sigh... braindead privatisation. Really, the last mile is a
huge asset that should not have been let into the hands of a public
corporation. It should have remained owned by the people. I read an idea way
back where it was suggested that the government sell the last mile to
homeowners. I think it was about $1000 that was mentioned, and if each home
bought their connection for this price (spread over a few years), then the
government gets the money (I think that raised around $5bn or so, but I
can't recall), and the residents retain ownership of their copper. There was
a more complete explanation in the paper (Tuesday's Australian a few years
back), including how to deal with the exchanges and so on, and it was quite
good IMHO. However, even if that wouldn't work, the present setup is a
disaster. Dammit, they're my copper wires, and I want to plug them into my
choice of local provider's exchange equipment. That would provide true
competition... sigh... Anyway, so the only way to provide competition is to
get the Government to admit that the Telstra selloff was broken and do
something to fix the situation and introduce competition (fat chance), or to
introduce competition in some other way. Think VoIP, think wireless, think
cable TV/internet, think ADSL with VoIP and just ignoring the POTS part of
the connection... I'm sure that Agile has some sort of plans regarding
this...

Anyway, as you can see, the way to improve things is (fair) competition. If
anyone thinks that they have an idea on how to improve someone's business,
then sure, tell them, and let them make the call -- it's their business, not
yours. If you still think it's a good idea, then go do it. Write a business
plan, do some market research, go to a bank, etc. If it's good, you make
money... if not, you go the way of Global Freeway and World-Link. Remember
that many customers care if you are going to be in business in five years
time (many don't, but they are the less loyal ones anyway), so you not only
have to cinvince yourself and your bank that your idea will be profitable,
but your market as well (whilst convincing them that you aren't ripping them
off -- harder than it sounds). If you don't want to do that, then I guess
there's no reason why anyone else should bet their business on your idea.

&lt;/OT RANT&gt;

PS What governments promise (and understand) and what the reality is are two
separate things. Alchin (or whoever) may have thought or promised (also two
differnt things) that ADSL was going to be a panacea for ISPs, and suddenly,
we would all have near-free high bandwidth connections in our homes that we
can watch movies on, but that was never going to be the reality. Being
sucked in by such hyperbole is unfortunate, but demonstrates why
understanding how businesses work is important in so many avenues of life.

PPS The fact that businesses are there to make a profit from their assets
explains completely why MS and Telstra behave in a way that pisses us off.
With the monopoly that they have, they aim to make money. Making money from
a monopoly is easy, although it's dancing with lawyers... However, both MS
and Telstra would be somewhat remiss and stupid if they didn't take
advantage of their monopolies to some degree -- it's really up to the rest
of us (other businesses and individuals) to break that monopoly by offering
some competition. There's still the issue of ensuring it's fair competition,
which is where the ACCC, DoJ etc step in... It's extremely complex though,
no matter if you are the monopoly, the ACCC/DoJ, a "competing" business, or
a consumer.

PPPS on that note, I will attempt to stay out of these debates on this list
in the future.
