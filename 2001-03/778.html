&gt; i am not claiming a bug

Really?  I could have sworn I saw multiple emails from you using words
such as "bug" and "panic".  Pardon me for construing that as a claim of
a bug.

&gt; perhaps you should refrain from judging people on the list

Now in *my* case I was very careful NOT to call you a naive newbie.
Re-read what I said and weep.


&gt; it seems that the 2.4 kernel doesn't handle an 'out of memory' situation
&gt; correctly or very well as with 2.4.2 the kernel outputs an error
&gt; "_alloc_page: 1-order allocation failed" repeatedly and then kills other
&gt; active processes such as xfs and bash with "Out of Memory: Killed process
&gt; ###" for example.

Well the repeated message could be in response to the repeated requests
for memory.  What do you expect it do?  And note, too, that I have
not claimed there is no bug.  I have merely come up with guesses as to
what is going on, and explanations why you would expect that result.
There may indeed be a bug, but simply complaining about a lack of memory
when you deliberately starve the system is not a bug; and repeating that
complaint when you repeat the demand for more memory is also not a bug.

Do try what I suggested: Rewrite the program so that it stops demanding
memory when the system refuses an allocation.  In fact a better version
than the one I suggested before is:

  main() { while (fork() == 0); while (1) wait(0); }

I predict that the system will print the "bug message" [sic] once;
and then once again each time cron runs; and one more time each time
you try to telnet into the box; but not hundreds of times a second.
If you're thoughtful you'll even be able to regain control of the system
without a reboot.  (Hint: echo /proc/*)
