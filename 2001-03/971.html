<H1>Facts (Summary :) (WAS: HOORAY - Connection Speed in PPPD )</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Facts:
     -Michael Kratz was just sharing his experience which others on the
this appreciated.

     -No one likes to be told they are crap or what they have said is crap
when it was their intention to be helpful.

     -David Newall wanted to point out that original email would not be the
case for all modems. ( something for you to learn David on presenting
facts?)

     -Stephen Donaldson believes is fostering (not hindering) an atmosphere
of cooperation and support. ( correct me if I am wrong Stephen and so do a
lot of others on this list )

     -Jason Tan pointed that truth was presented, but the format was
unwanted. ( bit like HTML right Davids :)

     -People should try to RTFM before posting. ( This generally makes for
better questions IMHO anyway)

     -List members don't like facts slammed down their throats in a
condescending manner. (Does anyone?)

     -michael points out that flame bait should not be taken too seriously
( ie. don't let it bother you)

     -misinformation is different to relating someone's experience. (
Michael Kratz didn't try to deliberately mislead anyone. )

Now that most of the facts are layed out. Maybe we can all LEARN from this
and MOVE ON?

Whats next ? oh... oh yeah back to work. :)
