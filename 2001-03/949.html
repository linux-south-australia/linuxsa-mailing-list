Time works strangely on the Internet.  If you say something and later
change your message, some people will see the obsolete message and
respond to it, and others will see the updated idea and disregard your
old story.  This effect can last for weeks, depending on how often people
read their email, whether they get messages one at a time or by digest,
and other factors.  Shrug off the hostile replies to your old ideas.

More than that, if you do chaqnge what you are saying you need to make
it clear what your new position is.  You should say something like,

  "Okay, I accept that no ISP in Australia is in a position to offer
unlimited downloads.  Perhaps they could offer free access to their Web
cache instead."

This would help ensure that everybody else knows what is in your mind.
Your ideas will also gain a warmer reception if you include some sort
of costing model.  You don't need to make it exact, but at least show
that you are in the ball park of reality.  Something like:

 "ISPs could afford to offer free access to their Web cache.  The
equipment decreases overall cost to an ISP since it permits them to
reserve commonly accessed content for close to zero additional transit
cost, and for that same content it improves subscriber performance making
subscribers happier with their choice of ISP."

Of course, when you put an idea as I did above it becomes clear that
giving away free access to the web cache increases costs to the ISP
because they need to purchase expensive equipment for which they gain no
direct revenue.  The ISP's position becomes: Pay a lot of money for a web
cache; gain some intangible satisfaction from subscribers for a small
cost per hit.  Perhaps that gain in satisfaction is worth the expense;
perhaps not.

Note that a cache hit does normally require some data transit; namely
a query to confirm that the cached data is still current.  Cache access
is not free to the ISP (neither in capital nor recurrent costs.)

You must also understand that ISPs are bombarded every day with demands
from the public for more resources for less money.  It's quite clear that
another such idea has to get through a lot of accumulated resistance.
(Put it this way: I need somebody to run my help desk.  How about you
give me unlimited amounts of your time for $24.95 per day? *grin*)
