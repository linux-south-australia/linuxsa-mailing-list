Ian!

&gt; This is where I can relate this flame war to Linux - this is something we should ALL care about and few of us seem to be paying serious attention to this.  Why are public institutions investing so much money in to propriatry infrastructure when there are cheaper and more reliable alernatives such as Linux - is it a cost or marketing issue?

The ADSL debate is quite interesting despite what I say. However, it
doesn't relate technically to Linux. There are a lot of people who are
members of this list and simply don't want to be involved in lobbying
the Government for change, changing the way public institutions think
and the like. The issue, for this list, is not at all about cost or
marketing.

In my opinion, you're not talking to a lobby group.

&gt; For example - if I want to convince a business that an x-server server based desktop solution is the way to go to avoid upgrading obsolete desktop hardware - what is the correct approach - is this technically and financially feasible?

Have you checked out the Linux Advocacy Project? I haven't, but I think
it still has a link from <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/">http://www.linux.org/</A>

&gt; However, the first obvious question is 'is it MS compatible?' and 'what end user training is required'?

So, to twist the question in the subject around, why waste one's time or
money [trying to get a group of people who don't want to become a lobby
group to become a lobby group]? There are two general methods to
becoming an effective lobby group - either you stay non-formal but get
very active with a significant amount of community/other support.
Witness the "I'm with Ivy" saga last year (they had the support of
Channel 7 who eventually admitted Ivy had nothing to do with it in
writing). Or alternatively, your group formalises (incorporates, becomes
a company whose goal is to lobby perhaps) which doesn't require quite
the same amount of public support.

The discussion here is interesting and I can say without giving too much
information away, that it's unlikely the discussion will be silenced by
those who are able to silence the debate.

Nonetheless, it does seem that all sides have valid points and valid
thoughts on the process.
