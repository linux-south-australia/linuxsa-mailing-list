&gt;Hmph[1]. Except for the latency if you want to get anywhere else in
&gt;the world, but I guess ISP's can't be blamed for the speed of light :-)

They have the same problem if they want to get anywhere else in the world
too ;)
Hopefully quantum-entanglement theory will one day eliminate noticeable
latency on International connections, not to mention the costs of laying
fibre :)

&gt;Seriously though, where does the $/Mb get introduced into the equation
&gt;- is it because of Telstra and what they charge ISPs? In the US it
&gt;seems fairly standard (unless you go completely overboard) to be
&gt;charged by the size of the pipe you have, not how much you suck down.

Because it costs so much to get enough data to fill a pipe of any size
continuously, it's impractical to sell such a product unless someone really
does have enough money to pay for it. $/mb is one way of selling a service
that lets you get the full speed out of the pipe you do have without having
to pay to keep it full all the time when you don't need it.

Another way is to use something like 95th percentile charging, which I
havn't seen implemented in Australia yet. This is where the ISP monitors
your download speeds over the entire billing period, then takes the top 5%
of sample speeds and ignores them. Whichever download speed is the highest
after that is the bandwidth you pay for. This means that you can have a
1.5Mb link, use it for email most of the time, pay for a 16kbits/s pipe, and
not get penalised or charged extra for the one time you download a 600mb
.iso at 180KBytes/s.

Of course, this still requires some restraint to be cost effective (although
there are some download managers that now allow you to specify a download
speed?), which makes it more difficult to market. It also means that the ISP
needs to charge a higher rate for the 16kbits/s which will have net-addicts
everywhere screaming "ripoff". Not to mention that a lot of customers would
find it difficult to understand.
