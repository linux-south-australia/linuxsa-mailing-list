&gt; I've been looking at UPSs and thinking about it for a long time.
&gt; (Since 1985 actually.)
&gt; Can you (or anyone else) recommend one or more brands in terms
&gt; of their usefulness for linux?

I believe that Sola makes UPSs that have little automatic shutdown
daemons when the UPS drops bellow `x' power remaining. Have a look at
their website (<A HREF="http://www.solaaust.com.au">http://www.solaaust.com.au</A>). They make a cool
powerboard/UPS thing that sits on the wall (or something). I'm not sure
if its got an RS-232 connection on it.

I had a little Sola UPS (it kept 4 servers going for 16 minutes, one
time) with the cable and it seemed to work quite well. The software did
the Unattended shutdown thing.

 
&gt; The few I've seen in the stores until now have looked rather
&gt; clumsy, and I had no idea how I would make them work with linux.

Not many computer stores seem to stock them. I think that half the
people in computer shops probably wouldn't know what one was :-) I think
the best way to go is do your own research about quality, linux support
etc. Then go and find prices. I think you'll struggle to walk into a
shop and find one on the shelf.

&gt; I've followed various discussions in linuSA about UPSs over the 
&gt; years. But I don't remember any specific recommendations of 
&gt; a good, cheap UPS for home use for, say, two PCs.
&gt; 
&gt; SuSE now has a list of about 90 supported USP types and 20 unsupported.
&gt; But I often find that in Adelaide, the brands are not on
&gt; the European/US brand lists.

Note that while SuSE may support one out of the box, it may be that the
UPS company has got their own program that does the Unattended shutdown
bit. Have a look on the manufacturer's website before you rule on Linux
Supported or not.

 
&gt; On the SuSE UPS support list, they mention that the Meta ECO 750 has
&gt; kernel support! But none of the other 90 UPS types have this.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm. A bit looking around reveals "man powerd", which describes
&gt; a nifty utility to get the OS down to single-user in the event of
&gt; a pwoer failure.

Why not just shut it down completely? I'd prefer my PC to be off in the
event of a power failure over single user mode. Unless you have reason
to have it in single user mode (over completely shutdown)

&gt; There's even a UPS-HOWTO! With 3696 lines!!

Wheeee!


Kind Regards,
