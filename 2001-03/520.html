&gt; &gt; Yes, I am aware that ISP's pay for bandwidth, as far as i've learnt, on
&gt; &gt; average 8cents per mb, or on high usage, often unlimited.
&gt; 
&gt; Most ISP's are using unlimited pipes right now, you can call up UUNET
&gt; and they'll happily sell you a 1 Meg pipe for $14000/month (I think the
&gt; pricing might even be a bit better now). This will allow just 20 modem
&gt; users to download flat out simultaneously. 20 x $21.95 = $439 .. how do
&gt; you think they're doing it?
&gt; 

Maybe they oversubscribe a bit? 
Like 20 modems but 200 users.
Still doesnt add up, but I think your exampel was flawed.

And then maybe they make assumption that a dialled up user wont be sucking
down flat chat,  was a resonablele pre napster assumption and is
still reaosnable now, except maybe the percentage of peopel not sucking
flat chat has dropped.

Still there are some people at any given time not sucking, maybe they are
reading data they have already sucked, eg the mail or web page they have
downloaded.

I suspect the more users you have the higher the percentage of idle users
at any given point in time.
And the cheaper your rate will be.

Still might not add up, but you can oversimplify too far, and I think you
have.
