&gt; &gt; Also, the only extra quality in APC units is in the quality of their
&gt; &gt; marketing. Their really good UPS's are apparently made by another
&gt; &gt; company and rebadged for the US market anyway.

&gt; hmm - I used to work for APC and is the first time that I ever heard this.
&gt; APC do have specialised divisions for home/office/large commercial and have
&gt; acquired some smaller manufacturers during their time but they do not
&gt; "rebadge" other products to my knowledge.

I was told (admittedly by one of their competitors) that the symetra UPS
was sourced from a european company. This was the lowest-spec UPS that
APC had that had a double-conversion feature. The pricing on this model
was seriously out of the ballpark when compared to other UPS's for this,
although its other features put it in a different class altogether.
