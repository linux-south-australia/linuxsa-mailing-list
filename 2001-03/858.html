G'day Richard,

Do you realise in your message you never once typed "Linux Weekly News", so the
only hope some folks had of figuring out what you meant was by noting you'd
sent a carbon copy to lwn.net and visiting their website?

Now that I've visited there, I've bookmarked it and will probably find it quite
useful.  I really only wanted to point out that using acronyms can sometimes
lead to confusion and lack of response (people won't reply if they don't know
what you're on about).  :-)

Cheers,
Gaelyne

&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I got to wondering if LWN was actually making enough money from its
&gt; advertising to support the wonderful stuff they do. As a result of this, I
&gt; thought about some other funding models they could use.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that LWN is such a valuable resource to me, and this can often only
&gt; be determined after reading it for a while.

&gt; So, while I know absolutely nothing about what is going on at LWN, if you
&gt; agree that their service is useful to you, I would ask that you reply and
&gt; tell me whether or not you agree here.
