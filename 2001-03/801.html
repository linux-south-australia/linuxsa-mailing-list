&gt; It's the bit about the MBR that worries me.

Agreed.  At worst this would force people to buy VMWare
and fake an MBR on the virtual disk just to run Windows.

So a person wanting to dip their toe into Linux would
be facing higher costs.

&gt; It just might be that the new WindXP could somehow reject
&gt; LILO MBRs or something.

On the plus side, this is unlikely because the "suspend
to disk" function of a lot of laptops requires odd
partitioning.

It would also annoy the military big-time, as all the
disk crytpo utilities write their own MBR (and panic
if the MBR has been "modified without authorisation").

&gt; And maybe linux won't be able to read/write the new file system.

Almost certainly true, because Linux can't write NTFS
filesystems now.  [1]

&gt; Does anyone have any facts on this?

No facts.

Glen

[1] Well, it can sort of write them.  The writes stuff the
    NTFS filesystem and a special utility is needed to
    recover the filesystem before Windows can use it.
    Could be why it's still marked "experimental" in
    the kernel configuation utility :-)
