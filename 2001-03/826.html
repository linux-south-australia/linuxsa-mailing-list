&gt;  &gt; Try that argument with the manager of your local petrol station.
&gt;
&gt;Doesnts it depend on the unit thoigh?
&gt;
&gt;If the unit is per meg, then per meg is approrite to abse your ISP charges
&gt;on.
&gt;
&gt;But there are wholesalers who are willing to sell you on bandwidth
&gt;basis ie the fatness of the pipe not the litres of petrol you pull
&gt;through it to use the petrol station analogy, which I suspect most
&gt;reasonable size isps buy their data on, yet they charge the users per meg.
&gt;Per meg was certainly porbably the most common unit of wholesale bandwidth
&gt;in .au a few years ago, but it appears to be changing quite a lot, and in
&gt;any case the per unit privce seems to have dropped a whole lot.

You don't seem to appreciate that rate-per-MB is *directly* 
translatable to fixed-rate-per-fixed-pipe-size. Neither is infinite, 
both are economically equivalent if you understand what's going on. 
Neither is particularly better or worse as a charging mechanism, they 
both have their good and bad points.

But fixed rate pipes don't magically make things cheaper, Jason. They 
just change the stakes you have to apply, and while you can typically 
do better overall on fixed rate pipes, that's only true if you can 
keep your average percentage utilisation high by balancing network 
demand exceptionally well to (a) avoid buying too much air and (b) 
avoid overloading the pipe and annoying your customers.

All you have to do to convert megaBITS per second to megaBYTES per 
month is pick a reasonable percentage utilisation, and do the maths, 
to see that they are in fact interchangeable.

For instance, lets imagine that a fixed price pipe at 2mb/s is 
charged out at $30,000 per month.

That 2048kilobits/sec pipe can shift a theoretical total of about 
2048 x 316 = 647168 megabytes in a month [*1]

Now, lets presume a realistic 24 hour average utilisation of that 
potential total, of 40% (which is in fact quite hard to reach unless 
you're overloading the pipe badly during the day and annoying your 
customers, but lets run with it). If you think 40% is low, remember 
this is a *24 hour* average.

That means 40% of 647168 = 258867 megabytes.

$30,000 divided by 258867 megs = about $0.115 per megabyte.

Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, it is, if you can pony up the $30k per 
month, *in advance*, on a fixed term contract, against customers who 
pay (usually) in arrears, and you can stand continuing to pay it 
during weekends, when it might be quieter, and any other time when 
your utilisation might be lower.

And if you can keep up with upgrades as needed when the pipe fills up 
too often and your customers start leaving you for higher performance 
providers.

And if you can employ staff and run a billing system and pay taxes 
and survive the other trials and tribulations of a high turnover 
business.

The only way you can treat the pipe as delivering infinite megs per 
month (which is what your message tried to imply) is if you either 
(a) don't understand that 2mb/s is greater than 1mb/s but less than 
3mb/s *or* (b) you don't mind delivering your customers horrible 
service by running the pipe wildly over-utilised, so that downloads 
might be 'unlimited' except that they're so slow that the limit is in 
fact the patience of the customer before they get annoyed enough to 
change ISP's.

&gt;Has anyone as yet mentioned settlement.
&gt;Does optus for example pay telstra 19 cents(or adjusted volume price) a
&gt;meg for every meg off the telstra network and vice versa.

Nope, the belief in the industry is that they pay each other $0.00. 
Yes, this does improve the price point for both of them. However, 
their obstinacy in refusing to peer with anyone smaller than them is 
slowly but surely having its own rewards.

&gt;I certainly dont thin telstra retails pays telstra wholesale 19 cnets for
&gt;data for the telstra netowrk.
&gt;
&gt;I suspect that national data charges for larger players are very minimal,
&gt;and this surely is a contributing factor to their appparently too good to
&gt;be true deals(form a smaller isp perspective).

No, not 'very minimal' - but obviously higher volume == lower unit 
cost in general terms. We still buy a moderate percentage of our 
traffic from Telstra (though we buy most of it from other sources 
these days), and we pay a lot less than $0.19 per MB for it. But if 
you spent amounts per month like my bill, you'd get a discount too.

&gt;
&gt;I also suspect that a company like telstra or optus probably has some
&gt;level of settlement for international traffic too.

Almost never do, actually - in this case they aren't getting any 
benefit at all, and in fact quite the opposite.

Did you read my article some days back in this list explaining the 
economics of international ISP settlement (or lack thereof)?

&gt;Once a again this is a guess, but it would seem to be logical.

Nope. International is highly inequitable, the USA doesn't pay for 
other people's international pipe costs, and there is very little 
leverage to force them to change.

&gt;At least it would from the articles that Mr Huston writes/speaks about in
&gt;various rags and books and talks.

Can you indicate a specific time when Geoff said that? I'd be 
surprised if he did.

Telstra are _trying_ to force peering internationally, but as yet 
neither they nor anyone else has succeeded in it. One small example 
of the fact that while Telstra might screw the rest of us, the rest 
of the world is still screwing _them_, in this respect at least. Not 
that it seems to be hurting their profits very much - because while 
they've got to pay for the whole international pipe, they sure get a 
good deal on it (because they own large chunks of several of them).

[*1] where did I get 316 as the number to multiply kilobits per 
second by to get theoretical 100% utilisation megs per month? Start 
with one kilobit per second, turn it into kiloBYTES per second, then 
into megabytes per second, then multiply seconds out into one month 
(x 60 for minutes, x60 for hours, x24 for days, x30 for a month):

i.e.   1 / 8 / 1024 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 316 (give or take a few decimals)

As another example, that means a modem achieving 40 kilobits per 
second, transferring stuff for a month solid has a theoretical 
download capability of 40 x 316 = 12,640 megabytes. Cost that at, 
say, $0.12 per MB and that's $1516 in a month.

Lets be nice and assume the 40% utilisation average again, that 
reduces the cost down to 'only' $606.72.

So that nasty bastard ISP having the gall to charge $24.50 for 
unlimited everything risks a loss of over $550 per month if his 
customers actually take him up on the 'unlimited' aspect.

I'm sure glad it's so easy to make money being an ISP - must be why 
I'm still in the business :)
