Oops, it  seems the way I structured my last message did not explain my
intent :-)  Just goes to show why body and verbal language is soooo
important.

Cough, cough, aaahhh emm,  to clarify ... so they do charge more?  I did
not know, the last I heared it was stopped, this is not nice.

Secondly Leigh, my fault, I did not mean I wanted only DSL at the expense
of the ISP's god knows we need them badly to keep the bastatrds honest.
What i meant was that Telstra was acting unfairly pricing the wholsale cost
below their retail cost.

If they had the capability in the first place to make it cheaper for us
retail, they should have been forced by the ACCC to provide a better price
for the ISP's so that they could compete.  I did not mean for one second
that I would rather have one supplier, man that's too painfull to
contemplate. I like competion, its great having choice.

It could have been better for all of us, ISP's included, but we ALL got
screwed, and ISP probably more so.

I hope this makes more sense.

&gt; &gt; Even now, the cost of DSL could be a lot cheaper, did you know that
&gt; &gt; Telsta wanted to offer DSL at lower rates to its direct users than
&gt; &gt; wholesale to downstream ISP's?
&gt;
&gt; What do you mean "wanted to" - they are.  It *is* more expensive for
&gt; a wholesale customer to buy an ADSL line than Telstra retail it for,
&gt; and they include Internet bandwidth in the retail package.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This had more to do with killing competition that justifying a cost
&gt; &gt; structure.  It took intervention by the ACCC to put a stop to it and
&gt; &gt; who loses.... we do, we did, we still are, and there is absolutely
&gt; &gt; no need for it.
&gt;
&gt; Well they didn't stop anything, Steve, they just made it look less bad.
&gt;
&gt; FWIW, if we had it your way, there'd be *NO* competition for ADSL in
&gt; this country as opposed to the struggling attempts to compete that we
&gt; have now, and without competition, Telstra have no reason to improve
&gt; their service nor charge lower rates - so they'd jack the price up
&gt; again once the competion died down.
&gt;
&gt; Why wouldn't they?
&gt;
&gt; Take off the glasses, red isn't your colour.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
