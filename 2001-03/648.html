<H1>[OT] SGI Indy for sale</H1>

<PRE>
OK, I've got this computer that works, and is kinda cool, but I don't have a
use for it.

Specs:
SGI Indy
IRIX 6.2 (with what I suspect is the standard SGI software, no garantees)
MIPS R4400SC 100MHz CPU, with 1MB L2 cache (I think) and the biggest
heatsink you ever did see.
32Mb RAM
~550Mb SCSI Hard Disk
Extra loud fan :)
Flat 17" Monitor (Sony Trinitron Tube) missing stand and bottom of case
(note that this has a non-standard connector, so you can't just plug it into
your PC, and I've tried to find adaptors, and they seem to be around $100,
with no garantee of working)
IndyCam (with frayed connector, but appears to work OK. Manual focus, no
zoom. A tad dark, and the computer can't really record at framerates over
4fps, but will display direct to screen no problems)
Some sort of Graphics capability, but I can't really tell what the card
itself is. I'm guessing it's one of the lower spec ones -- looks to me like
it could be 24 bit, but couldn't be sure.
10BaseT and AUI Ethernet
I've been told it has ISDN, but personally, I don't know what to look for :)
External SCSI
Internal sound, with in/out/etc
PS/2 Mouse and SGI PS/2 Keyboard
Basically every I/O thing that was around at the time
No floppy, no CDROM
It's a funky SGI speckled greeny-blue colour, and the peripherals are
speckled grey, but the keyboard is beige for some reason.
Original Box for case, no box for monitor.
Original Camtech Asset ID sticker :)
No garantees that anything I said here is correct or working 100% -- I've
had it running, mucked about with it for a few hours, and haven't noticed
any problems... It's kinda slow, but kinda cool, and I'm sure someone will
have an interesting use for it (I imagine it would be faster under Linux,
but I could be wrong).

<A HREF="http://www.exquip.com/silicongraphics/indy.shtml">http://www.exquip.com/silicongraphics/indy.shtml</A> seems to say a bit about
general Indy stuff.

I'm told you can run Linux on it if you mess about a little, but I haven't
tried it.

Make a bid (offlist), I'll sell it to the best bid by Friday night... If
you're going to use it for something cool, I might give you bonus points :)

I'd rather you picked it up from my place here in Blackwood, but will
deliver or meet if it's too far...
