 &gt; With record profits and ADSL coming out in the early 1990s - Telstra

Au contraire.  Telstra have *always* recognized the value of the copper
network:  As long as they refuse to let any other companies use it, they've
been able to remain a telecommunications monopoly, happy to live with a 
situation where it's simply not possible to have a telephone in Australia
without contributing to Telstra's profits.

That's why there hasn't been any ADSL, or any true local call competition,
or any true competition at all:  Telstra's competitors are forced to 
wholesale from a company that wants them out of business, and 
telecommunications users have had no choice about who is *really* providing
them with services.

That's the value of the copper network.  It's a monopoly asset, and the
only way it has been able to be used as anything other than a feed-line
for a telephone is because the ACCC has dragged Telstra kicking and 
screaming into the 19th century.

 &gt; We have subsidies for an industry that is a hundred years old - why
 &gt; not subsidies or even tax concessions for a totally new industry - ISPs?
 &gt; Perhaps we need a National Techonology Foundation to lobby against the
 &gt; National Farmers Federation for subsidies and tax concessions?

They'll say, "But of course, there is already a subsidy scheme, it's 
called Networking the Nation, and it's funded by the money we've raised
by selling Telstra."

The fact that many of the problems NtN funds solve only exist because of
the way in which they sold Telstra is a mere formality.
