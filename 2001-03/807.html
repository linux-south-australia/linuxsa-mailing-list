On the flip side, I have set up a Linux workstation for use in a commercial
office environment. I use RH7.0 with KDE2.1, and it works fine. I'd go as
far as to say the functionality is better than Windows in some areas. There
are two main drawbacks, however.

1. My workstation is in the midst of a M$ network. All M$ clients use the
Microsoft PostOffice (we don't have Exchange) for internal email. There is
no (AFAIK) Linux mail client which will allow me to access this post office.
As an aside, so far I haven't been able to get Wine to run MS-Outlook,
either, so I'm having to reboot to the Windows partition during the day to
read internal email, which kinda defeats the purpose of this discussion.

2. It is a fact of life that suppliers etc. send documents in MS-Word
format. KOffice can read these, to an extent, but cannot write them. I don't
know if StarOffice can do this. Yes, I can write pdf, RTF or any-friggin-f
documents, but if I am requested to (for example) add a section to a
client's document, I'm stuck.

For a roll-out of X desktops to non-Linux users, I guess you'd want to start
from a close MS-Windows look and feel to cut down on training costs and to
prevent scaring them. Once they become familiar with them, the power-users
will then customise at will.

Regards,

Brett Monten

&gt;&gt;Okay - so now that we have established that Unixen systems are best - more
&gt;&gt;advanced, etc, etc - what about cost and training requirements?  People
&gt;&gt;tell me that I am unrealistic - now I am being realistic - I REALLY want
&gt;&gt;to demonstrate that alternatives are feasbile and have worked (case
&gt;&gt;studies welcome).
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I for one would be interested is case studies in Adelaide (or Australia) of
&gt;SMALL business that has gone full on down the Unix/Linux road.
&gt;i.e. Linux server & workstations running "Star Office" etc.
&gt;
&gt;Or even half and half, we are still testing "HP Openmail" on our Linux 6.2
&gt;box. It's from HP, it's open source, it let our M$ Office Outlook 2000
&gt;clients to all their trippy folder, calender sharing etc. Still buggy but
&gt;beats and Exchange server any day on price :-)
