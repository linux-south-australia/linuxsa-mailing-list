John !

&gt; &gt;The Question Is:
&gt; &gt; "Is this thread on topic?"

&gt; Yes. Linux users may require more bandwidth with which to download their
&gt; operating system. Windows users generally get their OS on CD, or at least
&gt; pre-installed on the hard drive. There, now it's not-so-far offtopic :)

The true definition of Open Source. It's open but you may have to pay
for it...

&gt; dialling the next number in the yellow pages. To my knowledge, none of these
&gt; people have been linux users[2], although I suspect some of them of using
&gt; Amigas:) After receiving 20 such calls in a day, one starts to build a
&gt; negative opinion of people demanding unlimited-download accounts.

Unlimited download isn't an entirely viable business option, that much
should be a given.

&gt; Local ISP's that I've seen really do try hard to please everyone, and it is
&gt; a bit of a letdown to have potential new customers calling with outrageous
&gt; demands that can't possibly be met.

They are customers. They're buying your services. They're allowed to :-)

&gt; [1] If I have misjudged the population of the list and it's not so clear,
&gt; the evidence is that X-unlimited-ISP has gone broke, which is one way of
&gt; proving that they did not have a sustainable business model, and that no-one
&gt; in their right mind would commit commercial suicide by copying it

The truth is out their...from the X-files...

&gt; [2] See, it can still be on-topic. Almost. [3]

Your almost is a little more shaky than my almost. Almost.

&gt; [3] Actually, people requesting support for linux/bsd are a delight to deal
&gt; with, at least until they ask you to write new drivers for their unsupported
&gt; hardware:)

If they've got wads of money in their hands, why complain :-P ?
