&lt;snip mail formatting&gt;

&gt; I don't think anybody can consider this correct.

true... perhaps we need to have a completely new way of doing mail, etc...
an XML mail markup... Something that reads easily to humans...

&lt;mailquote from=<A HREF="mailto:grog@lemis.com">grog@lemis.com</A> quotelevel=3&gt;
Something Greg wrote at quotelevel 3 (whatever that might mean)
&lt;/mailquote&gt;

(note that I don't know XML at all, this is just a bastardised HTML...

Hmmm... maybe not...

&gt; &gt; HTML is not.
&gt;
&gt; I hate HTML for general purpose mail, but there are times when it can
&gt; be useful.  The big issue I have with it is that it's difficult to
&gt; create a dialogue of the nature of this message, where we have clearly
&gt; identified messages from three different people.  I fear we're going
&gt; to have to learn to use it, though.

Could we perhaps design an EMML (Electronic Mail Markup Language), as
suggested above, to facilitate this?

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; But anyway -- maybe I should have reworded my original as "surely there
&gt; &gt; aren't any mail readers out there that can't deal with wrapping
&gt; their own
&gt; &gt; text." Are there?
&gt;
&gt; You appear to be using one.

hmm... when you put it that way...

&gt; &gt; what mail reader do you use?
&gt;
&gt; Why ask?  It tells you in the headers:
&gt;
&gt;   X-Mailer: KMail [version 1.0.29]

reading the headers in Outlook is non-trivial :) (and I am lazy, and clean
forgot about the X-Mailer header)0

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Obviously there's going to be a time when mail formats change.  I'm
&gt; not opposed to change, as long as the new formats are usable.  But
&gt; everything I've seen from Microsoft appears to be broken, and your own
&gt; messages are an excellent example.

Seriously... what do people think of designing a specific markup language
for mail?
