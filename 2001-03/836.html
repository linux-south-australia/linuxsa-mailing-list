Mail.com.   As an ex-Mail.comer and trying not to downplay my ex-employee, I think your emails were once queued up in great EMC network stroage :)  As for why, there could be many factors especially after dot-com layoff storm.

Subject:  [OT] Mail.com/bigpond mail



I've been having a problem with my mail...

I use <A HREF="mailto:richardrussell@mail.com">richardrussell@mail.com</A> as my address, and it forwards to my bigpond
account, from which I download my mail. Normally, there is a delay of a few
minutes, occasionally longer. I think this is normally mail.com

Presently, it appears that my mail is being stored up at mail.com and let
out in bursts. For eg: on the Linuxsa list, I received 25 mails at
12:04-12:09am this (saturday) morning. I recieved 4 spread over the day
duriong friday (9:06am, 1:16pm, 5:25pm and 6:43pm), and 13 from 6:50-6:52am
Friday, 19 from 4:19am-4:24am Friday, and 1 at 1:46 am Friday. Prior to
that, 2 at 11pm Thursday, and 36 from 8:13pm-8:20pm Thursday, and similarly
back to about Monday. It's really annoying, as I'm sure there are messages
that aren't getting through -- I sent a number of test messages from work to
my mail.com address, and they didn't get through at all, and a number to my
bigpond.com address, and they appeared to work instantly. Note that the
timing of my mails is not caused by me dialing up... I am certain that this
is the time at which they arrived at the bigpond mail servers. (could be
international time).

Does anyone have any leads for me on what is causing this? Do I blame
Telstra or Mail.com? How do I find out who to blame... Can't wait to get
hold of that ADSL -- will run my own damned mailserver... :)
