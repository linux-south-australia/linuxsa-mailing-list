Stephen and John!

&gt; list of topics that are taboo and can only be mentioned with prior approval!  Oh
&gt; and how about this, why don't we just tell everyone "if you pondered about a
&gt; question prior to posting don't bother".

Mr Ervine can say anything unless it's in HTML. Now that I've settled
that matter...

&gt; And while I'm on it, people should expect a great deal more, with Telstra 2
&gt; billion+ in profits, and a policy to screw down line IPS's we might not get better
&gt; but we can dam well keep asking for it.

Agreed. However, we have a catch 22 situation. If Telstra looks like
it's losing profits, a conservative (Labor or Liberal) government has
the perfect excuse to sell the rest of it. If Telstra looks like it is
gaining profits, the users get less than ideal deals (1) but it stays
partially owned.

&gt; nuff said

There is never enough said.

&gt; &gt; Sure, it's human nature to want a deal that's too good to be true. For
&gt; &gt; those after such a deal, have a think about the above before wondering
&gt; &gt; out-loud on a mailing list full of people who should know better.

If this list were full of people who "should", John, know better then
you have obviously misjudged the population of people on this list (2).

DSL

(1)

I think "deal" is the wrong word. "White elephants" is probably better
albeit in the vernacular [but the saying is at least 20 years' old, so
is it really part of acceptable Queen's English...]

(2)

Mind you, I think this intriguing discussion about unlimited trafic,
ADSL and various providers with no reference at all to Linux - not even
obliquely - is amusing but slightly to very off topic. Not that I am one
to throw stones at people for being off topic...

The Question Is:
 "Is this thread on topic?"
 (maybe it would be easier to ask
 Cornelia "who is the weakest link?")
