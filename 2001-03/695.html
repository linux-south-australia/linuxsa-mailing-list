I downloaded 1.4 through Ximian, and I have to say that I'm not 100%
sure about Nautilus. It's so much slower and cumbersome than my nice
current stable version of Gnome.

I have to admit that Eazel have made it look pretty. It is a bit
remeniscent of OS X. I think Apple pull it off with a bit more class,
though.

My laptop is a PII 233, 128MB RAM. Running 1.4 Beta from Ximian, I am
constantly waiting for windows to appear, and nearly all of my RAM is
being sucked up.

I assume this is a side effect of using Mozilla for half the stuff it
does.

Personally, I think it will  be a long time before Gnome 1.4 weezles its
way onto my Desktop. It needs to be more efficient and 'trimmed down'
IMHO.

That's one thing that I've always liked about current Gnome - I can run
Gnome, Evolution, Netscape and a squillion terminals (all the important
things :-) plus all the background processes that go on without using
too much swap. The PC still remains responsive and usable, even with
everything going at once.

I'd hate to see what is a great Desktop Environment turn into a piece of
really cool looking, dare I say, `bloatware'. Not bloatware in the
Windows sense, but bloatware in the sense that they're making it too
complex and too resource hungry for my liking.

&gt; Last night Mel made mention that GNOME 1.4 would soon become available.  Well,
&gt; sooner than even he thought perhaps.  
&gt; 
&gt; GNOME 1.4 Release Candidate 1 has just been released, and if no serious bugs are
&gt; found it will become GNOME 1.4 in a short while.
&gt; 
&gt; This release includes Nautilus 1.0, the graphical shell from the guys at Eazel,
&gt; which is really cool.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to grab it early before the mirros get flattenned, or want to
&gt; contribute bug fixes, go ahead, download now, from <A HREF="http://download.gnome.org/">http://download.gnome.org/</A> in
&gt; the GNOME/stable/betas/gnome-1.4rc1/ subdirectory.
&gt; 
&gt; The other interesting thing is that Sun have contributed a test regression suite
&gt; for GNOME 1.4.  Testing is something that hackers don't typically like to do, so
&gt; Sun contributing this is a GoodThing(tm).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, off to flatten my link :-)
