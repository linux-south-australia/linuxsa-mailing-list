&gt; &gt; I think it will be a great thing!  All the hype surrounding IT will die off and people will become a little more realistic.  Costs will need to be saved and people will pay less attention to the worlds greatest marketing firm - Micro$oft - and look to cheaper more reliable alternatives such as Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; So, is it the recession that Linux has to have?

David,

I agree that a recession will help linux.
And here's some "evidence" in support:

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/8/17629.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/8/17629.html</A>

I quote:
=============================================================
Development charity ActionAid is developing plans to switch
all its desktop computers to Linux, as a way of avoiding the
viruses that continuously assault its Windows PCs. 

[....]
As well as promising 'virus free' computing, adopting the open
source operating system might also save the charity much
needed funds particularly with the increasing cost of
Microsoft's software. 
=============================================================

As MS needs to suck more and more money out of the
world's economies to feed its own exponential growth,
so as money gets short all round the world, users will
look for good value.

During the long growth phase of the late 1990s, people kept
saying that time is money - we can't waste time retraining
in a different OS to save a few dollars. But the relation
between dollars and labour changes in a recession.
Dollars become more valuable and time becomes less valuable.

And the availability of word processing software is important
to the non-nerd world:

=============================================================
Kerry Scott, IT director at Action Aid, said the effect of
viruses on the charity had pushed him to consider using Linux
far more seriously after initial reservations about the
availability of suitable applications, particularly word
processing packages.
=============================================================

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
