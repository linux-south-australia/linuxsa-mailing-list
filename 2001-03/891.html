&gt; One of the arguments for not incorporating LinuxSA is people wouldn't
&gt; pay to be a member. What does this say about LinuxSA? People pay $110
&gt; per year to be a member of AUUG...s

Yes what does it say? That if you pay $110 per annum to join auug you
better already know what the hell you are talkng about if you post,and if
you dont you bettter be ready to be heckled?

Does it say that a free or compatritvely low cost organisation such as
linuxsa can do just as well as auug with a lot more understanding and
with (generally) a lot less chance of being heckled  or belittled if you
make an error?

That sort of behaviour only reinforces a (not necesarily well founded)
