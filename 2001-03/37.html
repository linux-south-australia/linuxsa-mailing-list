&gt; 
&gt; Does this mean that you don't read the list you post
&gt; prolifically[1] to?

Daryl,

Many thanks for that. That clarifies a lot.
The date of the first e-mail in that thread is:

Thu, 18 Jan 2001 12:07:06 +1030

At 11:30 on Wed 17 Jan 2001, UTC-0800
(that's 06:00 on Thu 18 Jan 2001, UTC+1030),
my aeroplane left Los Angeles en route to Auckland.
The plane landed at 20:45 on Thu 18 Jan 2001, UTC+1300
(that's 18:15 on Thu 18 Jan 2001, UTC+1030).

So the first e-mail was sent while I was in the air.
Although I checked my e-mail from the hotel using
the laptop at about 09:00 (UTC+1030) on 19 Jan 2001,
I didn't get back onto my home computer again until
16:15 on Sat 20 Jan 2001, at which time I was very sleepy
and went to sleep an hour or so after.
The next time I got seriously onto the computer was
early Sunday 21 Jan 2001.

When I did read the e-mail, there were 187 unread e-mails
after the the first "REdhat vulnerability" item in the thread
to which you refer.
Still groggy from travel, I did not feel like reading 187
e-mails. The first e-mail I did read was that of Ryan Verner,
sent at 22:53 on Sat 20 Jan 2001.
Since I had 1649 linuxSA e-mails in my current archive folder,
I archived it at some time after 07:48 on Sun 21 Jan 2001.

The second thread "Intrusion question" did mention ramen
in lower-case in the 3rd line on Tues 6 Feb 2001 at 04:58.
For some unknown reason, I did not read that item.
Nor Nick Morrison's reply at 09:39 on that day.

---------------------------------------------
Here are some numbers:
On 17 Jan 2001, there were 72 linuxSA e-mails.
(The last one was from Daryl Tester.
Coincidentally you were telling someone that their contribution
had already been covered in the Register and possibly
Slashdot too.)

On 18 Jan 2001, there were 94 linuxSA e-mails.

I really, truly, cannot read this many linuxSA e-mails per day.
I scan the subject lines for interesting or relevant
threads about 4-5 times a day normally.
I also read the Register and Slashdot, and a couple of other things.

I would have read the Ramen-related threads if the subject lines
had been punchier or more incisive.

But yes, Daryl, I do read &gt;= once per week.
But if I get behind by a couple of days due to international
travel, the subject lines have to be really relevant
to me if I'm going to read them.
The linuxSA mailing list is more of a chat group than
a working group, and that is good. I already receive
half a dozen serious working groups, like linux-ATM,
diff-serv, the ALSA list, and so forth.
So it's good that there is a chatty group to read.
But 80 per day is more than my eyes can cope with in toto.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
