&gt; Let's say I have a customer who needs to download 180 Gbytes in a month.
&gt; I *know* that I can carry that customer's traffic with one of the
&gt; wholesale links described above and they'll be happy with it;  But there's
&gt; no room for growth there:  If they do their 180 Gbytes/month the link will
&gt; be congested to hell and back.  And what if they have a busy month and
&gt; want to do 250 Gbytes instead?

180-250 Gbytes even in hypothetic assumtions seems to be too much (except
you serve very big company). I had ISP back in Russia - there no such thing
as per megabyte cost. ISPs in Russia charge clients on channel speed.

Once happy day I decided to make experiment and connect one company with 2mb
link for US$48 per month instead of 32k for US$60. To my financial managers
it looks like I got crazy but I overruled them and started such link as
experiment. First few days I saw incredible traffic (almost up to given
bandwidth) but then activity ceased just to average of 16k. I visited the
company where we installed this link and asked them about why they ceased
their downloads and got very obvious answer: "We ran out of disk space".

So as you can see I actually sold 16k for US$48 instead of US$30 and kept
constant load of 32k link off... In the same time I had happy customers
which had good speed instead of just 3.5kb per second.

I don't know why but I saw just few persons who take informational capacity
into account. Not only capacity of HDDs and other storages but capacity of
exact person or combined capacity of persons which using internet at exact
company. I always wondering to persons who asking for unlimited traffic: do
you actually need it?! It's easy enough to calculate how much MBs /GBs you
need per month and then simply select ISP which will offer you good price on
such volume. Preferably channel to ISP must be fast enough. You will avoid
long time download waiting - it will not actually increase your downloaded
MBs.

Unlimited traffic - it's just good for advertisment because most people
associate it with their freedom to download something but actually they even
don't need it :)
