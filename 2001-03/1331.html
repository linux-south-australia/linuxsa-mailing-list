Thats where things get interesting.  I am only a undergrad here, but I
administer 6 or 7 computers.  For a miserable $10USD/hr.  But, when I
started working here a year and a half ago, I knew next to nothing about
linux/unix, but now I feel that I have gained some competency.  I take the
simple approach to security; close all the unused ports, update my
software, and lately I have been working towards only allowing encrypted
access to all of my machines.  This is a little bit harder with the SGI's
since we have budget constraints.

Thats where the University philosophy is flaky.  I am a student, so I
don't get ANY benefits, or even a decent wage (although $10 USD/hr for a
student at my university is unheard of).  I administer several
departmental servers that are responsible for streaming distance learning
classes, hosting in-development online courses, and my newest server is
now the universities largest e-commerce server, selling streams, online
courses, and conferences and their related material.

Part of the problem is the linux philosophy coming around to bite me in
the ass.  My boss is fairly fanatic about linux to the point where its
almost dangerous.  He is loathe to pay for anything related to linux,
feeling that I should be able to get it for free.  Unsurprisingly, he has
nothing to do with the system administration, and doesn't realize the time
involved.

Ahh had to vent ;)

Part of the reason I wanted to purchase the PDF from sans is that I am
constantly getting excellent information from them.
Interestingly enough, they list the 7 Top Management Errors that Lead to
Computer Security Vulnerabilities
<A HREF="http://www.sans.org/newlook/resources/errors.htm">http://www.sans.org/newlook/resources/errors.htm</A>

Number 1?

Assign untrained people to maintain security and provide neither the
training nor the time to make it possible to do the job.

On that note, I am going to go start gathering quotes on the costs (both
monetary, and on reputation) of hack attacks.

thanks for the feedback,
corey

&gt; &gt; People are hesitant to purchase this since they feel $79 is a lot to pay
&gt; &gt; for a (6 user?) pdf when 'that information is available on the web'.
&gt;
&gt; How much is your time worth? Let me have a guess...$30 US an hour. If
&gt; you can't find the information you need in approximately 2.75 hours then
&gt; $79 is worth it. It's as simple as that.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Since I am having a hard time convincing them that its worth the $79 to
&gt; &gt; have all the information in one spot.  Mentioning that you can't put a
&gt; &gt; price on security just got me odd looks...
&gt;
&gt; If they think that $79 presumably US dollars is too much to pay for
&gt; security then personally I'd give up in despair. Just how much is their
&gt; data and systems worth? Why do people consider fires and physical theft
&gt; "real" and pay huge insurance premiums against them, not to mention
&gt; special insulation, smoke alarms, security systems but then turn around
&gt; and leave their data insecure because "it costs too much"?
&gt;
&gt; That is total CRAP. Utter and pure CRAP.
&gt;
&gt; Let me hazard a guess. You're running a University. What could I do to a
&gt; University if I broke into its security systems:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Impersonate Your Staff
&gt;
&gt; I could have your Professor of Theology predict that the world will end
&gt; because Nostradamus says so. And he'd look like a total dolt.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Steal Your Research
&gt;
&gt; And get the credit, maybe even major contracts out of it.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Plain Blow Up Your Computers
&gt;
&gt; By fdformatt'ing the drives, overdriving monitors
&gt;
&gt; And I could do all types of things to attract a police forces attention,
&gt; such as host child pornography and so forth. I could distribute a
&gt; Napster system without your knowledge; but whether that would stand up
&gt; when the University got sued is a different question. ESPECIALLY if the
&gt; University took no obvious steps to ensure the staff taking care of its
&gt; security were able to do so.
&gt;
&gt; Another tack you may want to take is to convince your friendly librarian
&gt; to buy a security book for your University's library. And being a staff
&gt; member, I presume you'd be able to borrow it. If you can't - and if
&gt; they're wobbling about paying $79 for a security book I wouldn't be
&gt; surprised - get a student to borrow it on your behalf.
&gt;
&gt; Security is priceless.
&gt;
&gt; Send the accountants to <A HREF="http://www.auscert.org/">http://www.auscert.org/</A> and get them to put a
&gt; cost on the information.
&gt;
&gt; Or better still, go piss off a security list which will have the almost
&gt; certain effect of having one or more people attempt to crack your
&gt; system. When they do - and they will - they'll probably blow your system
&gt; up and you can have what I term a "Jewish Stock Take". At that stage -
&gt; stick your tongue out at the accountants.
&gt;
&gt; I can't stand economic rationalists.
&gt;
&gt; Tell them to stop paying insurance too. That's way more than $79...
