&gt; &gt; I understand this, but then again, Telstra has been slipping consistently
&gt; &gt; over the past few months/years/whatever, and with the billions of dollars of
&gt; &gt; profit that they are making they should be able to put a bit of money into
&gt; &gt; QoS for existing customers.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, yes. But their share holders don't care about Quality of Service.
&gt; They want return on shares. To provide quality of service could very
&gt; well be illegal (1).

Is this a good spot to point out that a lot of the shareholders are mom
and pop's around Australia, most who probably haven't even heard of QOS ?
This is just a sign that the business model is wrong. (IMO)

&gt; 
&gt; It is possible that proving Quality of Service (as YOU define it) may
&gt; not maximise or be beneficial to the (short term) profits of the
&gt; shareholders. Which could possibly make it illegal.

That's a pretty long bow, David. The Board charges it's Chief exec to
build a profitable business. There is an expectation of both short and
long term profits. The Execs, and even the Board risk losing their jobs if
they fail. Illegality implies a criminal act and I think failing to
maximise short term profits is not yet a crime.

Michael.
