I have an office in the back garden with room for 6 comps easy and I would be happy
to host it, heating, cooling,  e-smith server with net connection + HUB  and lots of
powerpoints :-)

Pizza shop is close by.

Let me know and we can make it happen.

&gt;
&gt; Aren't we all.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What would make me really happy would be to have 5 or
&gt; &gt; so people around at someones house (or other suitable
&gt; &gt; venue) for a config fest.
&gt;
&gt; Or around someone's office, I might just be able to talk my boss into letting us
&gt; use mine for such a noble cause.  More than enough room for 5 computers, even 10
&gt; if we push it a bit.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There are so many things that I have been meaning to
&gt; &gt; work out but I just don't have the experience or
&gt; &gt; knowledge to do this.
&gt;
&gt; I can relate to that
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Just little things such as how to have attack alerts
&gt; &gt; from portsentry emailed to root, optimise my hard
&gt; &gt; drive, set up SSH access / webmin, etc, etc, etc.
&gt;
&gt; not to mention things like tripwire, basic shell scripts for automation, how
&gt; about crontab and how the heck does that work.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And I am sure there are others on this list who have
&gt; &gt; a few things they never got around to working out
&gt; &gt; although they have been meaning to - so I suggest a
&gt; &gt; weekend meeting.  The LinuxSA meetings are great
&gt; &gt; although I think an afternoon geek-fest would be great.
&gt;
&gt; I'm interested, and I could probably find another couple of guys who are
&gt; interested enough to show up.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Any takers?
&gt;
&gt; I'm game. Anyone else?
