Which exactly supports what I was saying ie that the larger player within
this country(and almost scerttianly any other coutnry where telcos and
telco like models are in the market) have decided advatnage over smaller
players, which is possibly one reason why they can offer products with few
limits or no explicitly set limits ie products whcih smaller palyers( some
of twhich are quite big in their own region and in their own right) cant
do.

Ie one reason why it might be possible for telstra or optus or primus to
say here have an unlimited account for $100 per month, wheras senet or
internode or pinnaale may nto be in aposition to do so.

Ie the smae rules dont apply at all levels, which is why at some levels it
may be possible to do things which are impossible at other levels.

&gt; &gt;Has anyone as yet mentioned settlement.
&gt; &gt;Does optus for example pay telstra 19 cents(or adjusted volume price) a

&gt; 
&gt; Settlement/Peering of national traffic happens between the "big 4" at the
&gt; moment, Telstra, Connect.com, Optus and Ozemail (UUNET). The details of the
&gt; settlement aren't known, because when the ACCC forced peering on them, they
&gt; didn't put in a clause that would allow future peering or public knowledge
&gt; of the deals made.
&gt; 
&gt; Primus are currently trying to break into this exclusive cartel at the
&gt; moment, but aren't having much luck.  Probably because they have nothing to
&gt; contribute but besides requests as they're primarily a dialup provider. At
&gt; least local ISP's do a lot of web hosting as well. Watch out for Primus
&gt; trying to get seriously into web hosting this year so the "no homers" club
&gt; will let them (Homer) in.
&gt; 
&gt; Optus have been on a mission to collect all sources of data, either because
&gt; there's a financial benefit due to the peering arrangement, or someone in
&gt; there [1] has figured out that a network is only as valuable as the content
&gt; that is in it.
&gt; 
&gt; UUNET have offered to peer with anyone that has their own regional network
&gt; (at least 50% geographic region) and 5Mbps of traffic to share. When they
&gt; say geographic region, they mean asia-pacific, ie: you're in two countries.
&gt; See <A HREF="http://www.uu.net/peering/">http://www.uu.net/peering/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Connect.com offer free local peering with their differentiated traffic
&gt; services. ie: you don't pay for data received from anyone at the same POP.
&gt; Once upon a time they even paid ISP's for content.
&gt; 
&gt; Telstra thought they'd have a go at valuing ISP content, but somehow this
&gt; confused the minds of management, and they came back with a 'settlement
&gt; scheme' that looked suspiciously like a volume discount along with a vague
&gt; promise not to charge for backchannel traffic if you used Telstra 100% [2].
&gt; 
&gt; Paradox are present at a few peering exchanges in order to carry traffic for
&gt; their own network.
&gt; 
&gt; John Edwards
&gt; 
&gt; [1] I'm told Optus have some smart management. How else can you explain a
&gt; massive loss-making Internet service turned into a windfall overnight by
&gt; selling it to a utility?
