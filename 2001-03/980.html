Actually what argument was there?

This is not a piece of computer code we are writing here, we deal with real
people with different fears, aspirations, strengths and weaknesses.  If you
fail to see how your post was bullshit, even though lots of people agreed with
my observation, then you have been in front of a computer way too long.

David L made a statement that you had 25yrs experience in the industry, and boy
would I love to learn more from that, however, if the way you impart that
experience is to "bully" users then it's not welcome.

I don't believe there is any justification, no matter how you try to justify
it, about the way you responded to the post in question.
Common decency  is a subjective unmeasurable, but it is certainly noticeable
when there is a lack of it.
As far as I'm concerned you do LinuxSA harm with such posts and should be
stopped.

Say what you like, I have private mail from others agreeing with my stance.

If you or the other David, (or anyone else for that matter) is incapable of
providing help (no matter how experienced you are) in a manner suitable for
humans don't reply, we will figure out the answer without you, it may just take
a little longer.

&gt; Now now, you know that isn't so.  My diplomacy is quite common here.  It's
&gt; moslty in "real life" that people sugar coat what they say; in the Internet
&gt; people often call a spade a spade.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Your response to Michael's post was bullshit
&gt;
&gt; In what way?  Don't wave your hands without bringing up some fact, lest you
&gt; appear vacuous.
&gt;
&gt; I stand by everything that I say.  I'd like to refute your argument, but I
&gt; can't because you didn't make one.  I do await your specific criticism with
&gt; much anticipation; or were you just letting off steam because I called crap
&gt; crap?
