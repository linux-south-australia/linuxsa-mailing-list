&gt; Sorry to say this Richard, but I don't like the idea.  What's a specific
&gt; email markup language going to give you that HTMl doesn't?  If you want
&gt; something more than ASCII then why not HTML?

HTML is designed for the web -- it has things like tables, frames, links
etc... What I want is a really really simple language that allows you to
mark where each section of a message came from -- a language designed
specifically for quoting. The presentation of it would be up to the reader
... it would be a purely semantic language. There would be no option for
&lt;BOLD&gt; or &lt;EM&gt; or &lt;LIST&gt; or anything like that -- I suppose you could have
HTML in the quoted sections if you wanted, but "yuck". It's possible that an
adapted subset of HTML would be ok, but HTML is not what I mean.

&gt; The problem with "something more than ASCII" is that a) not all email
&gt; clients work with it (incl. legacy clients) b) bigger file downloads c)
&gt; the whole executable shambles.

a) -- yes.
b) -- not neccessarily, if I've explained my idea well enough, the file size
would be little bigger than ASCII -- it would have one extra line per quoted
section...
c) huh?

&gt; But that's just my opinion.  If you want do define something better,
&gt; then go for it.  I just don't know what sort of acceptance you'll
&gt; receive...

Hmm...

I see the problems you describe, but IMHO, email is a particular type of
data, and could really use an appropriate format. Obviously, to do this
effectively would require the backing of the IETF or something... anyway,
just looking for comments...
