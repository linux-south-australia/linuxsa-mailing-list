&gt; Nicely done some propsed mods/additions below.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Is it in HTML. Make it not so -- plain text is preferred by many.
&gt;&gt; 2. Do you have line wrap turned off -- turn it on... it irritates some
&gt;&gt; readers, and makes the web archive hard to read.

There's much more to be said about this issue.  You might like to link
to <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/email.html.">http://www.lemis.com/email.html.</A>

&gt;&gt; 3. Is it insulting, or a flame? Don't send it. This includes condescension,
&gt;&gt; harsh sarcasm, accusation of stupidity, and personal attacks. LinuxSA
&gt;&gt; doesn't need them, so please don't send them.
&gt;&gt; 4. Is the subject line relevant to the subject matter, and specific enough
&gt;&gt; to be userful? "A Question" is not useful. Nor is "No Subject" or "".
&gt;&gt; 5. Is it signal or noise? Signal is good, noise is bad. Noise doesn't add
&gt;&gt; anything to the list, and serves only to camoflage the signal. A post is
&gt;&gt; generally good if it causes (or enables) you or someone else to learn
&gt;&gt; something or fix something. Most Anti-MS jokes have been done before, and
&gt;&gt; aren't worth sending to the list, especially if that's the whole content of
&gt;&gt; your post. Be aware that some people on the list may be MS weenies...
&gt;&gt; 6. Has the subject matter been covered before? Check the archives. Will
&gt;&gt; bringing it up again really add anything other than traffic to the list?
&gt;&gt; 7. If you're responding to a flame or insult, take it with a pinch of salt,
&gt;&gt; and try to let it slide -- flaming trolls doesn't really help anyone.
&gt;
&gt; Proposed addtion
&gt;
&gt; 8. The use of profanity is frowned upon. You are smart enough to be
&gt; exploring Linux so you are probably smart enough to be able to express
&gt; yourself without hte use of profanity. Profanity adds nothing to your
&gt; communication , except the possibly of offending someone and perhaps
&gt; breaching guideline 3 above you dont want to do that do you?

Proposed addition:

9.  Is it easy to read?  Have you checked your spelling?  People find
    it very frustrating to read a message, no matter how good the
    content, if you haven't gone to the trouble to use proper
    punctuation and spelling.

&gt; Proposed modification
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. prefix the subject line wiht "[ADD]" or "[PLUG]".
&gt; s/[ADD]/[AD]/
&gt;
&gt; Proposed addtion.
&gt; [OT] Off topic - for questions that are not concerned directly with linux
&gt; or packages wdely used or distirbuted with linux, eg question about how to
&gt; install a widget in you  PC.

I am strongly opposed to this kind of abuse of the Subject: line.

I did something like this for the FreeBSD lists a while ago.  You
