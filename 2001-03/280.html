&gt; You'll get more consistently fast speeds and a reliable connection using
&gt; a modem on ISDN, but the Home Highway service seems to be limited to a
&gt; V90 connect of 49333, probably due to the cheap A/D convertor used.

Yes I've noticed that.

But it's also converted a phone line that was only
doing 19k to 25k (on a sunny day) to 128K ISDN

Just a couple of points for others.

Do not let Telstra's web page about th 4.5k limit scare you
<A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/onramp/faq.htm">http://www.telstra.com.au/onramp/faq.htm</A>
I know Telstra qualify it, by saying it can be more in country areas.
Well mine is 9.5km and it ROCKS... (The worst cable is the first 500m)
12km appears possible here.

Using my Cisco 801 it is possible to have a dedicated/permanent DOV
connection and a dedicated phone number AND and dedicated fax number.
How? Well using one channel for DOV leaves the other free to answer either
the phone
or the fax. The catch is when the phone is busy (talking) so is the fax &
visa versa but unless you have a phone grafted to your ear or receive a
continuos
steam of faxes this is not an issue.

I also have the multilink threshold set so that at 90% the second channel
dials up.
Although it may not be up to ADSL it is certianly a MAJOR improvement for us
hayseeds in the sticks.
