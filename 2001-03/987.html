Dear oh, dear.

If anyone had thought this was a trivial thread, it looks like David just took it to
new depths.
So what I said was (libelous), just between you and me David, liable has to do with
the truth or untruth of something :-)

Frankly I believe David's responses to this thread indicate his unwillingness to act
in a manner that is suitable for all levels of users on this list.  It is also my
belief that until he does so LinuxSA will not grow or nurture new users in a manner
the community of LinuxSA  users deserve.

His words speak volumes.

And thanks for all the private mail too people, I will note give up on this,
LinuxSA deserves better

Steve

PS  If posts of his type continue, I am happy to start a new LinuxSA (or other)
mailing list and a new web-site that that is more proactive in SA, I shall keep you
posted.

&gt;
&gt; Obviously you are confused between "lots" and "a few."
&gt;
&gt; I take exception when you say that what I posted was bullshit.  If you
&gt; claimed that it was a harsh way of putting the truth I would not argue.
&gt; But you say what I said was bullshit.  Bullshit, like crap, implies
&gt; an inaccuracy.  This is the second time you have made this (libelous)
&gt; claim.  I asked you before what was inaccurate and you did not reply.
&gt; Are you knowingly and willfully accusing me of inaccuracy when you know
&gt; what I said to be correct?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If you [are] incapable of providing help [...] in a manner suitable for
&gt; &gt; humans don't reply, we will figure out the answer without you
&gt;
&gt; I provide help in a manner emminently suitable for humans.  How ridiculous
&gt; to imply otherwise.  As to figuring out the answer without me: That's
&gt; equally ridiculous, because it's self-evident; even though the point in
&gt; question is a recurring mistake...  But Stephen, if you don't want to
&gt; hear my pearls of wisdom, don't let me stand between you and the door.
&gt; (Please close it quietly behind you.)
