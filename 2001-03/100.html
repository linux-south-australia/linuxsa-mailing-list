&gt; We already are.

And we already did.  Sometime last year, (shortly before Installfest?)
when there was agreement that we should investigate Incorporation, and
would incorporate if necessary to insure ourselves at the Installfest.
AUUG's generous support made incorporation of LinuxSA deferable.

&gt; I'm in favour of incorporation, but lets understand the benefits, and leave
&gt; the la-la land out of it. 

Totally agree.  La-la might evolve later if it can.

&gt; Incorporation will not permit LinuxSA to contract to rent the Convention
&gt; center for a week for $50,000, in order to hold a free event, because at
&gt; the end of the event LinuxSA will not be able to meet its debts, which the
&gt; officers should know.  If they made such a contract they would be personally
&gt; liable.  They probably would lose their houses, and they might well go to
&gt; gaol, too.

Serve 'em right!  :-)
Seriously, though the example isn't perfect (what sort of idiot would
accept such a booking from an incorporated body about which financial
information is easily established?) it does show how ordinary members
would be protected against committee misbehaviour.  LinuxSA assets
would go and the committee members houses could go, but the 'rank and
file' would incur no liability. 
As things stand, an individual could totally misrepresent LinuxSA and
our Installfest to the Convention Centre and we might all become
liable.  Evidence of our individual liability for LinusSA debts might
include discussions on this and a dedicated Installfest list.
