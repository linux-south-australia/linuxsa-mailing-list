&gt; Is this the list silly season?  Why not ... "Surely mail readers
&gt; should be able
&gt; to cope with HTML"  "Surely mail readers should be able to cope
&gt; with Cyrillic
&gt; script"  "Surely mail readers should be able to cope with
&gt; anything my mail
&gt; reader can cope with"  etc ... etc ..

because they are not as common or easy to deal with as line wrapping. Line
wrapping is prety trivial. HTML is not. Cyrillic is but is not common.

&gt; There is a current thread in which you are participating, about
&gt; the importance
&gt; of  holders or senders of information disseminating this information in a
&gt; universally  recognised and non-proprietory format.  At NO stage
&gt; has it been
&gt; suggested that the onus should be on the receiver "to cope with" whatever
&gt; format the sender presents.

Hmmm... I can't think which thread this is.

&gt; Why you have suggested that this rule should not apply to e-mail
&gt; is beyond me.
&gt; Double standards, perhaps?

maybe. I don't know.

But anyway -- maybe I should have reworded my original as "surely there
aren't any mail readers out there that can't deal with wrapping their own
text." Are there? what mail reader do you use?

Also, is there an appropriate time to change the standard format for email?
Given that it seems that there is an increasing tide of mail clients that do
not conform to this standard, it seems to be to be a wise time to expand
this stnadard (is it actually a standard, or just a defacto standard?) to
include what they produce. I personally wouldn't use a client that doesn't
read HTML simply because I receive too much HTML mail from people. Ditto
with line-wrapping. Yes, receiving these emails still irritates me a little,
but I deal with it. It's like the reason I tend to use recent versions of IE
or Netscape over older versions or lynx -- more sites are written to work in
them... It's about defacto standards... I do object somewhat to getting .doc
format mail, but again, I have to deal with it becuase I receive it all the
time.

Anyway... time for me to go...
