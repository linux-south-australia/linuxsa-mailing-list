We have a dilemma don't we Ian, listen to the people who make money from you telling you your dreaming. If you listen up you will hear the people who make money from you telling you live with it and stop complaining. If on the other hand your sick of
the telstra crap (charging etc) complain and don't stop EVER.  If we can have an impact on banks (ACCC today anyone)? We may just have a chance to have s mall impact.  Most of the ISP's have given up, but they stood to lose more because of their
relationship with telstra.  As for me, ;-)  I keep on plugging... Oh and don't let anyone fob you off with it can't be changed, the world is what we make of it, not what other people tell us we should expect.

Surely you followed the friendly flame war re meg/time providers v benefit to country, mankind and the galaxy :-)

Good grip  welcome to reality, lets fix it :-)

And before we have the local ISP boys bleat again about how its soo good for us and makes us all well behaved little childern,  I AM BLAMING TELSTRA FOR OUR PROBLEMS AND YOURS........!!!!!!

&gt; 250Mbyte limit?  Are these people SERIOUS?!
&gt;
&gt; Get stuffed!  I don't give a damn what people say about business models and so on.  There is no way I am paying for something that is fast - yes - but only clocks up 18c / 10 seconds or something when I want to listen to online radio or whatever.
&gt;
&gt; This is just complete bullshit.  No wonder Australia is such a backward country.
&gt;
&gt; Primus now has a 1000Mbyte limit.  I am so glad I did not sign up - as then they would have changed the conditions on me and I would have been stuck with a crappy contract for 12 months.
&gt;
&gt; I have just had it with the whole home retail Internet industry in Australia.
&gt;
&gt; The whole idea of having ADSL at home is to listen to radio and download films, etc.  Otherwise why should I bother upgrading from a dialup connection?
&gt;
&gt; ADSL as it just stands is just completely pointless unless you are a milionaire who can afford to clock up the equivalent of a phone call to Ghana peak time!
&gt;
&gt; It is not a FINITE resource - it is a resource that is only limited by bandwidth and infrastructure costs.  And at the moment - bandwidth and infrastructure costs are too high to justify ADSL at home.
&gt;
&gt; Get real - I guess I will stick with my trust modem until ADSL is truly obsolete and something better comes along - perhaps when I am retired and over the whole thing anyway.

&gt; &gt;I'd agree whole-heartedly with this.  It took me over one working
&gt; &gt;week to get a permanent dialup customer's DNS detail correct that
&gt; &gt;they were hosting.  They apparently only update their DNS servers
&gt; &gt;once per 24 hours, plus coupled with their inability to read email
&gt; &gt;and faxes correctly, resulted in one severely PO'd customer and an
&gt; &gt;exasperating situation only equaled by Big Pond technical support.
&gt; &gt;I've never sent a business customer their way since.
