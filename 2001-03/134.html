<H1>Caldera eDesktop2.4 Update</H1>

Hi all,

I have been searching for a distribution suitable for my Dad to use on his
work PC and laptop, and I thinkI may have found it, in Caldera OpenLinux
eDesktop 2.4 (capitalisation and all!).  However, the CD I have (from
InstallFest 2000) is rather old, and Caldera's site states that a new
updated version was released in November last year.  However, the link to
download it never eventuates in a page being displayed.  Upon searching
their ftp site, I find an iso-images directory, but the files in there
have a timestamp of March 13, which I guess is last year, so that
obviously can't be the updated version.

So, does anybody know how to obtain the updated eDesktop 2.4?  Or perhaps
someone has knowledge of an impending new release?

Also, I would like to know about Caldera's practices regarding the
updating of packages for OpenLinux - it seems they have not even their own
packages for XFree86-4.x, or even KDE-2.0.1 or 2.1 (which is strange,
considering it is such a KDE-centric distribution).  So could someone shed
some light on this matter?

Thanks for your help, and hopefully I should have a nice, current setup
sometime soon :)

Cheers,

Tim Riley
