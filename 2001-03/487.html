&gt; As far as I can find, iPrimus are the only people to offer unlimited data

Again; Good, Fast, Cheap, pick any two.

For all of the people out their deluding themselves that the world owes
them unlimited bandwidth for the cost of pocket change, do the sums..

Most ISP's are now bringing in data indirectly via Southern Cross (SX),
right?
Southern Cross doesn't do discounts (besides volume), not even for those
who invested in it, so Optus and UUNET are getting access to it as the
same price as everyone else can.

Now, to buy 2Mb of unlimited-usage bandwidth on SX is around $15000 per
month, on a long contract (5-15 years), and doesn't include any Internet
connectivity, just a connection between Sydney and California. Maybe you
can get a better deal by using some dodgy back-passage cable instead and
piggy-backing on China's bandwidth. Stretch it, cache it, massage it,
peer it and water it down as much as you can, and it still doesn't come
anywhere near the $50 per month most end-users would like to pay for it.

Sure, it's human nature to want a deal that's too good to be true. For
those after such a deal, have a think about the above before wondering
out-loud on a mailing list full of people who should know better.
