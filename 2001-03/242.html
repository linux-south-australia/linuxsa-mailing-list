Michael!

&gt; Thankyou, it is pretty 'down pat' now, I have kinda learned how to config
&gt; bind and zone files. They are kinda easy now that I have got used to the way
&gt; the config files work.

I thought you'd think that after you'd seen a few being made up. They
are like regular expressions: totally confusing to the unitiated and
blatantly obvious to those in the know :-)

&gt; Hey I am even setting up some servers for some
&gt; friends and also for some businesses!!!!

Don't undersell yourself then. If they are willing to pay a fair amount,
then don't tell them not to because they are friends. You do need to eat
remember :-P

&gt; not bad considering I only started
&gt; using Linux about a month before the installfest. And I owe a lot of that
&gt; learning to people like you on this list that blatantly assist new people,
&gt; despite their somewhat cumbersome and repetitive questions sometimes :-)

Thank you.


&gt; I understand this, but then again, Telstra has been slipping consistently
&gt; over the past few months/years/whatever, and with the billions of dollars of
&gt; profit that they are making they should be able to put a bit of money into
&gt; QoS for existing customers.

Well, yes. But their share holders don't care about Quality of Service.
They want return on shares. To provide quality of service could very
well be illegal (1).

&gt; I am not pointing fingers, I just though it was humerous so I though I would
&gt; share a bit of humor with this list!!! but if you don't like humor then
&gt; well, I dunno ;-D

I'm so tempted to say: YOU DUNNO ;-P

My main point is/was that I'm not entirely certain what Telstra's
inability to work out that Paddington is in Sydney and not in Brisbane
has to do with Linux at all. Or any recent thread...I do know the point
you are making.

It is possible that proving Quality of Service (as YOU define it) may
not maximise or be beneficial to the (short term) profits of the
shareholders. Which could possibly make it illegal.
