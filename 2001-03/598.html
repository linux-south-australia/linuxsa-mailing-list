&gt; On a slightly different topic;
&gt; It is cost effective for all ISPs to offer only a pay per megabyte
&gt; account?

At the right price, yes, although it can have problems of it's own.

&gt; This would stop income based on those who pay by the hour and chat by the
&gt; hour using a lot of time but little bandwidth. Do those people offset the
&gt; cost of the download leaches? 

This is why most per/mb accounts have a minimum monthly charge or an
additional monthly cost. You used to be able to get a Telstra account
and pay only for what you use, making it an extremely cheap way to
simply check email. They have since put a $20/month minimum to cover the
cost of equipment, but anyone who has to pay for lines (ie: ISP's that
aren't telstra) is still taking a risk with this.

There is an additional danger (oddly, one of the reasons $/mb is
unpopular in the US) that you need to provide capacity for customers
that they may not use. Also, if all of your customers want to download
lots, you might not have the capacity standing by. This is rather
important if you're using a cents per meg link as a backup system, as a
connection that's using nothing per month might not have enough capacity
planned for it to meet your normal running requirements in an emergency.
 
&gt; Are there any usage patterns of users that can give a view into the
&gt; average usage of bandwidth for all users?

On similar pricing plans, customers average out in volume and have an
overall predictable usage pattern. Once an ISP reaches a certain size,
individual peaks in usage get absorbed into this pattern and are more
easily planned for. Most usage is regulated by the TV guide. National
ISP's use this to their advantage with timezone differences and
network-tv programming :)
