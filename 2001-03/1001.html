&gt; actually the network cards are 100/10 baseT cards so to use a $55 10baseT
&gt; hub would be limiting performance wouldn't it.

I guess technically, yes. BUT, how often are you going to be transferring
100Mbps between the two computers constantly? Even playing games like Quake
III, Unreal, etc, you wouldn't. 10Mbps is overkill than enough for most
users. What speed is your Internet connection?? If its not more than 10Mbps,
then the hub isn't your bottleneck anyway. You'll find that during the
business hours, eg, you're average network throughput is going to be about
50B[ytes]ps, assuming you're using it pretty reasonably. I have 60 users on
a 1.5Mbps Internet connection and the average network utilisation is less
than 1Kbps.

&gt; to use a $55 hub I would still need 1 network card for the server and
would
&gt; therefore cost me ~$100

For 2 machines:
3 NICs @ $45 = $135
1 HUB @ $55 = $55
TOTAL =  $190
or
4 NICs @ $45 = $180

Wow, you save $10. I'm sure that will break the bank. Lets try it again, but
this time you want to add another PC to the system:

4 NICs @ $45 = $180
1 HUB @ $55 = $55
TOTAL = $235
or
6 NICs @ $45 = $270

Not just are there the setup costs to think about, what happens if your
Linux box blows a power supply? You lose your network. If you were using a
hub, then you'd just lose your Internet, the other machines would be able to
keep talking to each other.

Also to consider are the facts that by putting a machine in between the two
windows machines, you're introducing a bit of a bottleneck, as the Linux
machine needs to copy the data between its interfaces, you're going to run
out of PCI slots in your linux machine pretty quickly, most PCs only have or
4, if you have an internal modem, or ISDN card, PCI graphics card, etc,
you've got even less than that, you'll run out of IRQs pretty quickly too.

&gt; seems cheaper to me. :-)

Not to me, as someone who looks after a corporate network for a living.

PS. Yes, I run 'only' a 10Mbps network at home.
