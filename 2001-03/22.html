Another incorporated lug...

&gt; &gt; There's vigorous discussion on LinuxSA about incorporating
&gt; &gt; at the moment.
&gt; In NSW, cost is about $1,000 first year and $500pa afterwards.

The situation is quite different in Victoria (which just goes to
show how important it is to get local advice).  Here you can
become an "incorporated association" for a reasonable fee
(I think it was less than $100), there is no compulsory
public liability insurance, and the recurring annual fee is
simply $40 or so to submit the annual statement, provided your
finances involve less than $50,000pa.

LUV incorporated in 2000, and really the only reason was legal
protection for the committee members, who otherwise could have
been personally liable for LUV actions (in particular we were
concerned about the installfests).

LUV has no membership fee, and AFAIK isn't planning on introducing one. 
Official membership really only entitles you
to voting rights at the AGM (and various misc privileges
according to the constitution (actually legally called the
"memorandum of incorporation") such as calling special general
meetings and being able to be voted to committee positions).

Given that membership is free we vaguely restrict access to
our mailing lists to members -- it's very helpful to have
membership numbers to use as a bartering chip with commercial
companies -- although we're not overly strict about it.

The MAJOR headache in the incorporation process was drafting
the memorandum of incorporation, as we wanted to allow the
majority of member contact to be electronic.  This involved
a reasonable number of changes to the prototype constituion
the govt. hands out -- not a fun thing to do.

cheers,

- Mike
