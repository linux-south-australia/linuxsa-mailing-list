Hmmm...

&gt; Horray someone got the meaning of the message, besides that fact the outage
&gt; doesn't even affect me. I was just marvelling at the stupidity of some
&gt; pathetic telstra drone.....

I wouldn't worry until it was the Pentagon computer that mistook your
home for the next nuclear missile strike (1).

DL

(1)

This is a polite way of saying "who cares?"

ps.

I remember someone having DNS trouble themselves, and they only had a
small system. I remember that they needed someone else's help - and that
someone else is still willing to help by the way - to get it down pat.
Given that someone (i.e. YOU Michael) asked for and received help on a
worldwide minor DNS problem, I'm sure you'd understand that if you were
to maintain a network as large as Telstra's that you might get things
back to front every now and then.

So I suggest you don't start pointing fingers at Telstra because they
get a MINOR point wrong...and that if you think you should point fingers
at Telstra that the TIO is the person to talk to. Not us.
