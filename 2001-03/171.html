&gt; &gt;&gt; Robyn Manning and David Lloyd will volunteer to coordinate Install

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's fine I guess - but what happened to Sarah Bolderoff's offer
&gt; &gt; to organise?
&gt; 
&gt; Good question.  It's nice to see people volunteering, but we also need
&gt; to coordinate.  Sarah's offer was at least partially also an offer
&gt; from the AUUG to help coordinate the event nationwide.  Now I won't
&gt; pretend that we've been as responsive as we should have been, but I
&gt; think the way to go here is for all people involved to get together,
&gt; either virtually or physically, and plan the event.  In particular, I
&gt; hope we get better press coverage this year.

Thanks Greg & Brian, I was sort of wondering what happened to my role
as well.  I don't want to step on anyones toes, however I am keen
to make the installfest happen.  

Prior to David Lloyd's announcement, I had been corresponding with
organisers from other LUGs about the organisation of the InstallFest and
indeed the rest of the AUUG executive committee.

AUUG is in an excellent position to coordinate the installfest at a
national level.  Especially with me on the exec committee brain washing
them into thinking so *grin*.

It is in fact, the worlds worst kept secret, that AUUG is keen to back
Australian National InstallFest 2001 as the main sponsor.

&gt; Can somebody set up a mailing list for the organizers?  Sarah?

OK, if this hasn't been done already I can do it.  How about:
<A HREF="mailto:installfest-org@auug.org.au">installfest-org@auug.org.au</A>

I would also like to arrange a time for the organisers to get together and
discuss what needs to be done locally and exactly what it is (and how much
time) individuals are willing to put into the event.

Have a look at 5 points for running an installFest:

<A HREF="http://www.linux.org.au/installfest/5points/">http://www.linux.org.au/installfest/5points/</A>

This is a list Richard and I compiled after last years installFest.  It's
a good starting place for (local scale) organisation.
