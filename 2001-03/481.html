Hi...

&gt; &gt; I have a squid cache that dies regularly (almost every day).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At some stage the squid child process dies.  There are no entries in
&gt; &gt; the cache.log at this time, but the following appears in
&gt; &gt; /var/log/messages:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mar 12 20:40:40 proxy squid[676]: Squid Parent: child process 679 exited due to signal 11
&gt; &gt; Mar 12 20:40:40 proxy kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
&gt; 
&gt; Phil, sorry if I comer accross as a dope for saying this, but your email
&gt; makes me think you might not be aware that you experienced a kernel
&gt; panic. (well maybe not quite a panic, but the kernel definately spazed
&gt; all over the place).

Yes... I noticed.  ;-)  But I wasn't sure how to classify it - is it
a panic, or something that's not quite a panic?  (the kernel doesn't
halt)

Anyway, an update to the situation:
I decided to recompile squid with debugging symbols and disable
everything that would stop a core being dumped (as Glen suggested) in
the hope that I may be able to find the bug (if there is one).
Since then the machine has been up "2 days, 16:05", which is the
longest uptime for a couple of weeks now.  Anyway, I'll give it a few
more days and if it doesn't die I'll probably try recompiling without
debugging symbols to see what happens.

Phil.
