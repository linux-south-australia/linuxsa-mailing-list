But lurking won't give you a list of ALL subscribed members. Only those
that talk the most. If the "lurking" theory is going to work, you would
have to start a particularly serious flame war. Whilst I probably could
start one by myself, I'm too busy to keep one going with such length,
interest and off topicness such that everyone - including the silent
lurkers - actually say at least one thing. Mind you, if you want to send
me a cheque from a reputable financial institution - the Fourteenth Bank
of the Republic of Congo, for example, would not be valid a) becuase it
doesn't exist b) if it did, would you trust a cheque from it c) it's
probably run by the local black militia rather than the local black good
guys - note: the whites are always bad [reverse racism thingo here]).

Until such an unholy, very hot war occurs you'll only be able to have
access either to:

* one of the list gurus
 - and I assure you, I hate spam, and if you think that I can sound a
little harsh when whining about HTML e-mails from DumbBlind, those
e-mails pall into politeness if you spam me

* one of the (rare) people who have read the manual
 - but can't understand it

* one of the (more common) people who have not read the manual
 - but still ask funny (I was going to say silly, stupid and ridiculous
but that's a bit blunt) questions
