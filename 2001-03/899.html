Andrew!

&gt; The incredibly anal replies from the two David's to the original post
&gt; are precisely why I won't post to this list anymore.

Anal? I assume that you refer to the precision of both of our replies.
The other David was far more precise than me. He was correct; I simply
affirmed that he was. Given that you are accusing me of being "anal", I
suppose I'm being "anal" by pointing out to you that I was only telling
the truth.

&gt; As a newbie I have a thousand questions I would love to know the answer
&gt; to but posting questions to this list has not been a pleasant experience
&gt; in the past.

Your name doesn't appear familiar to me. You'd be aware I am one of the
main talkers on this list and I haven't even heard you ask one question.
All YOU have done is assume how I might answer your question. I've
answered a signficant amount of questions on this list, so why haven't
you asked me (or the list) any of these supposed questions?

How can I possibly tell you WHICH manual to read if I have no idea what
question you want to know?

&gt; I even thought about coming to a LinuxSA meeting but if Sad-Sacks like
&gt; this hang out there then I'll give that a miss also...

I'm sure we'd notice your absence.
