&gt; I have seen quotes down at around 8 cents per meg on small volumes, eg

With CCA, which are, BTW, probably (read: definately) more expensive
than other ISPs of similar capacity in the Adelaide area, we pay (at
most) 22.5c/MB for our data. We have a 10Mbit RF link and use between 10
and 11GB per month.

I've heard of other ISPs *buying* data at 8c/MB ex Tax, I think from
Asia Online. I'm not sure how much of this comment is true, but even if
it were, there's two things to consider.

Firstly is the volume of data that you have to buy. A lot, I'd guess.
For example, if ISP `x' buys data from said ISP at 8c/MB ex Tax,
supporting 10 `bigger' clients downloading 10GB / Month, plus another
10-15GB per month for other dialup and their own surfing (a total of
aroung 115GB), they'd have a better chance at buying data at the lower
rate. I'd say that the majority of people would not be able to afford or
justify the cost of the amounts of data that you need to buy to get that
sort of rate.

The other thing to consider is the quality of the data. How advanced is
the network? What happens when someone pulls a pair of fibre out of that
router in their main office? Does their entire network die? Do they have
enough redundancy to keep their clients afloat? How fast/capable is
their network to live with the amounts of data you (ISP `x') and their
other clients are going to be downloading?

Personally, I'm happier paying more than the cheapest guy on the block,
and getting a more reliable, surefire service that  I can depend upon.
I'm not saying that our current provider is either cheap or reliable,
but I feel happier with someone who has a more developed network than
Joe ISP, selling data for 8c/MB.

For the general home user, I don't think 8c/MB will be a reality for a
while. It'd be nice, but it comes down to the recent discussion about
people wanting something for nothing (or next to nothing). You get what
you pay for. If you pay shite all, well....
