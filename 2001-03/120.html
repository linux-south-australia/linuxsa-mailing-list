Hi Alan

I have had since the start of the summer 5 power faults all lasting more
than 3 hours.

I installed a Nikko UPS about 1 1/2 ago which after doing some searching I
found the manufacture was www.upspowercom.com.tw (which seems to be down) or
<A HREF="http://www.powercom-usa.com/">http://www.powercom-usa.com/</A> . I sent them an e-mail and they sent me a
program for linux :) which was has work flawlessly.

If some one want the SA wholesalers details, e-mail me of list.

Cheers
    Mike O'Connor

&gt; &gt; Actually, useful as the unattended shutdown is, most outages are covered
&gt; &gt; without it in my experience, which means that a relatively cheap ups
from
&gt; &gt; say Jaycar will do 80-90% of the job.
&gt;
&gt; Michael,
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for that. Luckily I happen to have a Jaycar catalogue.
&gt; They have a 800VA unit for $400 - well, in 1999 anyway.
&gt;
&gt; They claim it will keep a computer minus monitor going for 45 minutes.
&gt;
&gt; That should indeed cover most power losses.
&gt; Here's a list of the recent losses in my suburb:
&gt;
&gt; 2001-Mar-01 140 minutes.
&gt; Cause: truck hit stobie pole.
&gt;
&gt; 2001-Jan-10 Probably about 60 minutes.
&gt; It was down for 3 days because I was
&gt; overseas at the time, and I had get a
&gt; non-computing friend to run fsck
&gt; while I was on the phone for 1 hour from Europe.
&gt;
&gt; 2000-Nov-02 30 minutes.
&gt; Cause: Canadian electricity company turned off
&gt; Adelaide power to sell it at a higher price
&gt; in Victoria because of the strike there.
&gt;
&gt; 2000-Jun-10 First failure: 45 minutes. No file system damage.
&gt; Second failure: 5 seconds. FS was damaged.
&gt; System fixed 9 hours later, because I was asleep
&gt; at the time.
&gt;
&gt; 1999-12-02 First failure: 45 minutes.
&gt; Second failure: 55 minutes.
&gt; Cause: Trees hit a power line near Port Augusta and
&gt; led to wide-spread black-outs.
&gt; System fixed up 30 hours later.
&gt; I was in the Flinders Ranges at the time.
&gt;
&gt; Well, that's how good the Prospect power has been in the
&gt; last 14 months or so.
&gt; A good advertisement for business thinking of moving here!
&gt; Bring your own kero generator!!
&gt;
&gt; So it looks like from these numbers, I really need 60 hours
&gt; of backup in order to survive more than 50% of electricity
&gt; failures without dropping to single-user.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, if I can save the pain of damaged file systems,
&gt; keeping the system going would be just icing on the cake.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
