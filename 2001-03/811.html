&gt;SAIX is the South Australian Internet eXchange. It allows its members to
&gt;exchange traffic with each other at zero incremental cost. There is a
&gt;monthly membership fee and the cost of putting a big enough link to the
&gt;building. Most big local ISP's are members.

So how can someone be a evil leacher if they are
leaching from the SAIX rather than at premium rates
(ie - direct from the internet) - if caches are used
widely - why is leaching so evil?  Surely it is a
matter of developing the technology of caching.  We
will never have a free lunch - but perhaps a more
efficiently produced lunch and hence a cheaper lunch
for the consumer and better margins for the lunch
maker.

So we can't cache absolutely every little web request -
granted - what if the cache were to look out
specifically for requests larger than one megabyte (or
whatever) and mirror these.  Sure it can not work by
file name - but by site I am sure it can.

I have not heard anything about news servers.  I believe they are an excellent caching technology.
Could newservers ever be made more efficient by
allowing direct binary store rather than text encoded
binary only?  Just a thought.

I still don't understand why I should be told 'nup -
we told you - 500Mb is your limit - now don't whinge'
when the customer could be rewarded for using locally
stored content.

This is why I started a thread a while back about a
software library for LinuxSA.  I suggested this out
of concern for excess bandwidth usage as well as 
selfish motives.

Someone please tell me what is wrong with a ISP 
customer being rewarded for using locally stored
material.

&gt;
&gt;Apparently the government believes it can be done after hearing that it
&gt;couldn't be in the censorship legislation hearings (re: lists of porn
&gt;sites in proxies to disallow).
