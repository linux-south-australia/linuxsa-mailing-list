&gt;  &gt; &gt;Ie one reason why it might be possible for telstra or optus or primus to

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Do any of them actually -have- a $100 per month unlimited account?
&gt;
&gt;I dont know.
&gt;
&gt;The telstra dsl account is not truly unlimited, but it is close enough for
&gt;the avarerage users. I think it is reaonable but they dont actually say it
&gt;is unlimited.
&gt;It is not however as far as I can see, explictly traffic quota'd or time
&gt;quota'd as far as I can see.

It does have a limit, its just not stated explicitly on their web site.

The major limits are by 'acceptable use policy' - including explicit 
contractual conditions that you need to sign that you promise that 
your use of their 'unlimited' service will be by a single user, on a 
single computer, with no routers or other connection sharing devices 
involved (sorry, no linux box).

Also usage by anyone else must only be under your direct supervision.

&gt;So witin certain parameters, ie nto spaming, not running servers, the only
&gt;limits appear to be those imposed by infrastructure.

No, they are doing a claytons' attempt to make it a single user 
product. If they'd just said '3000 mb per month' it would have been 
simpler but then they couldn't have used the 'U' word.

The account is 'limited by AUP' (acceptable usage policy), a practice 
that is increasingly popular and starting to generate the (negative) 
attention of the ACCC.

&gt;
&gt;However the real point I was trying to make was there are reasons why what
&gt;is unsustainable for a regional isp might not be unsustaninable for a
&gt;larger one.

Yes, that's right - economies of scale do apply here, but they aren't 
really the factor thats at issue in the threads to date.

&gt;
&gt;Ie I was trying to asnwer the specicif question that was asked of "how can
&gt;these non traffic limited accounts" be ecnonomically sustainable when
&gt;copanies must pay on a traffic counted way?

They are not unlimited traffic. The traffic is always limited by 
-something-. Limited by AUP (see above), or by speed of the pipe, or 
maximum session time, or any one of a number of other things.

Truly unlimited would let me plug a 100 megabit tail in to such a 
provider and pull traffic at 100 megabits per second, 24x7. The fact 
that this is obviously not what anyone means is proof that all of 
this discussion is using variable definitions of 'limited' - and its 
the variability of various people's personal definitions that is 
causing the conversation to go around in circles.

&gt;My answer is not all companies do have to pay that way.
&gt;Some fwerw get their traffic for virtully nothing( ogf course tehy apy
&gt;carrigage costs, but everyone does - the thign is saller palyers pay
&gt;carriage and data costs. Teh significance I think is that fcarriage is a
&gt;fixed knwo quantiy easily didved between a given user population wwheras
&gt;until recently traffic in this country was not, though I beleive it can be
&gt;now).

What happened to your keyboard, Jason? Did someone swap several 
letters over or something? try reading the above again :)

As I said in great detail in another post, fixed cost for a finite 
bandwidth is directly equatable to cents per MB. They're one and the 
same thing.

&gt;
&gt;Then of course the obvious queitonis then why fdo they constantly go out
&gt;of business, get bought out or report loss? Or why are there not any of
&gt;these accounts?

Because the industry, like all industries, has its share of idiots 
(and non-idiots who try hard but don't understand the true economics 
of the situation, and are sucked into copying the next door 
neighbours' account on the basis that 'he must be making money!')

&gt;My beleif is that although larger companies may
&gt;have achieved a postion where they can
&gt;offer those services, they dont always do it efficiently.
&gt;Example large ISP contracts out their web site to portal company. Result
&gt;if optus has
&gt;an outage (eg mail servere fails - and they do ahve these outages) they
&gt;cant ust put a message on their web site. They need at least 24 hours to
&gt;get portal company to change their site content. Which of course leads to
&gt;tech suport having vast lines of users all wanting to know why mail doesnt
&gt;work.
&gt;
&gt;They dont change their phone message to tell the user of the problem
&gt;either(why I am not sure). Result a user sits on hold for 45 minutes to be
&gt;told teh problem is not theirs its the ISPs.

Yes, and you've neatly encapsulated the argument in favour of 
supporting your friendly local ISP - thanks for that :)


&gt;
&gt;  &gt; what is 'unlimited' in those accounts what is 'limited'? Otherwise
&gt;  &gt; you're comparing eggs to albatrosses and the whole thing is pointless
&gt;  &gt; (which it probably is anyway...)
&gt;
&gt;I dont recall making comments about unlimited acounts, weitehr exisitng
&gt;or beign economically.

But you're talking above about non-limited download quotas. 
'non-limited' means 'unlimited', doesn't it?

&gt;I believe my assertaion was more along the lines of charging by other
&gt;crtieria tnan per magebyte is possible and could be done at a profit using
&gt;fixed price badnwidth billed p[ipes instead of per meg pipes -
&gt;probably not as big a profit as chargingg per meg though, but I did nto
&gt;say it woudl be as profitable, I just said I thought it was possible.

Yes, and as I've said already, fixed $ for a fixed pipe size is 
directly equatable to $ per MB, just insert your average utilisation. 
For a domestic customer, in general, whose utilisation won' t be high 
on a 24x7 basis, the utilisation becomes very low.

However, in this situation, another factor kicks in - which is that 
every port at the ISP's side costs them money on a 
fixed-cost-per-line basis (and even the line rentals are more 
expensive than residential lines - Telstra reward high line count 
businesses by charging MORE, not LESS, per line - go figure).

So as people stay on for huge hour counts with very little downloaded 
volume, the dominant cost then tends towards the $26 or so per month 
in line rental fees and the roughly same again in costs of buying, 
maintaining, upgrading and running access server equipment. So if you 
stay on a line 24 hours a day, even downloading nothing, you've cost 
your ISP about $52 already in that month.

&gt;
&gt;Hmm, that old chestnut.. ;-)
&gt;The "ineveitable industry shake" out which has been threatening the
&gt;industry for at least 5 years now (ie over half of the life time of the
&gt;industry).
&gt;
&gt;In fact based on some figrues peopel ahve thrown around the lit I came up
&gt;with a business plan... want to invest? ;-))

Why? I'm already successfully in the industry. Go ahead, enter the 
market, Jason. If you mean it, mate.  Don't blame me if you fail, 
however.

&gt;It surely woud be harder now, but I still think it would be possible.
&gt;Especially with semi - creative products, marketing/loyalty schemes, and
&gt;the ever difficult to get, good service.

Only with a huge amount of capital and a correspondingly huge level of risk.

&gt;Admitedly I havent personally ever had an Internode account, but I have
&gt;had accounts with at least 3 major(national) and 3 regional as well as a
&gt;couple of local ISPs(and worked in  a few local ISPs too), and have not
&gt;yet found one that does all things as well as I would like.


Well, you said you hadn't tried one of ours... :)

&gt;And
&gt;in all cases the problems to which I am  referring have been related to
&gt;service in the non strictly techinical sense(ie not bandwidth pronblems,
&gt;or constant busy signal, or dropouts - though I have epxerinecd those, but
&gt;that was fair given the account style). The problem has always been
&gt;treatment of users, staff cluelessness about their products unshceduled
&gt;outages that could have been scheduled,poor billing, etc etc.
&gt;In other words all things that could have been fixed with interested
&gt;managemnt and forthought, for growth which was obviouly not planned for
&gt;when the enterprise started.

Yep. You've neatly encapsulated what separates Internode from many 
other ISP's. Thanks again for putting it so well :)

We try very, very hard indeed in exactly the areas you say that you want.

&gt;
&gt;Now a specific question about Internode products.
&gt;
&gt;Are you delivering adsl now?

Not yet, no. I'm still wrestling with issues that Telstra (those nice 
people Ian tells me are wonderful), who continue to make my life hell 
in the generation of a service outcome that I'm prepared to stand 
beside as being of the same quality level that our other products 
have. But I'm getting much closer to getting it out the door.

&gt;
&gt;Can you deliver it to Mile End(I think the West Adelaide exchange)?

I think so.  Give me a phone number and I'll check for certain so 
you'll know if you can get service when we have our service out the 
door (Real Soon Now - honest - I'm just adamant that I'm not going to 
get this out of the door until its going to definitely work properly, 
with the features our customers are insisting that it has - like the 
option for a permanent IP address, running servers, etc etc). Those 
are the barriers I'm solving right now, we can do 'dynamic' address 
accounts right now, but thats nothing special - and we are determined 
to -be- special.
