Hi,

I have just been in contact with Danielle Street from Sales for connect.com.au (a subsidiary of AAPT).  She is the first person I have ever spoken to in a large ISP that was actually able to provide some answers.

She is clearly quite proud of their network although she emphasized that owing to an emphasis on quality rather than quantity (they use Cisco and not those infuriating NT setups at Primus, Telstra, etc) some people may be be put off by their prices.

She quoted me $89 for a 256Mbit connection (64Mbit upstream) plus around $200 installation which does not sound that expensive to me considering they use Cisco from top to bottom.

They are focussing on business clients although they are happy to take on residential clients if ADSL is available in that persons area.

For further inquiries - her direct number is 02 9409 2122 or the national sales number on 1300 363 338.

ADSL will not be available until the end of next month (April) but I suspect that this will be worth waiting for.  She gave me the impression that they take their network maintanence quite seriously and hence their focus on commercial customers.

She is happy for me to post her contact details on this list and for people to contact her for quotes and other details.

Regards,

Ian McLeod
