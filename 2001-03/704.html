Australia's bandwidth and infrastructure costs aren't too different
to elsewhere in the world.  The rates AARNet pays are competitive
with those paid by other large non-US networks.

What Australia lacks is a mechanism to make the *pricing* of
major telcos bear some resemblance to their *costs* for
the average customer (ie: those lacking AARNet's size, experience
and potential revenue threat).

This explains why every "bandwidth inquiry" says we have
enough bandwidth, but it appears to be unobtainable in
practice.

As far as I can tell, ACT and then Perth will have 50Mbps
to the home in about 2 and 4 years respectively from projects
deliberately designed to break the telco duopoly.  This is
from infrastructure spending by their governments.  You've
got to ask what the plans of the SA government are.
