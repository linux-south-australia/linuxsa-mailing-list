&gt; &gt; Feel free to add to or disagree with anything here.
&gt;
&gt; This is not a technical list.  It's a party attended by people with a
&gt; common technological interest.  Your suggestion completely overlooks
&gt; that.  Most of what we do is noise, and often interesting noise at that.
&gt; Your guide leaves the impression that the list must only be used for
&gt; linux and open source related messages, and we have never behaved in
&gt; that restricted way before.  I don't think we want to start now.

yes, I agree. It's not about rules, more about getting the best from the
list...

&gt; Rules are emotive.  The more rules you have the fewer people will agree
&gt; with them.  I discourage this whole guide idea as being a waste of time

yes (re thye number of rules etc)

&gt; and effort, but in the spirit in which it was intended, I offer the
&gt; following KISS inspired refinement:

ok, I'm too verbose, yes :)

&gt;
&gt; ----------------------------------------------
&gt; Unofficial LinuxSA Etiquette Guide.
&gt;
&gt; 1. About LinuxSA and the List
&gt;
&gt; LinuxSA was started in 1996 as an informal Linux User Group aiming "To
&gt; promote and support Linux in South Australia".  The list subscribers
&gt; come from Adelaide, Rural SA, interstate and overseas, and not all speak
&gt; English as a first language.  They vary wildly in age from school-age
&gt; up to retiree, and their level of experience ranges from non-technical
&gt; newbie to linux kernel hacker.
&gt;
&gt; Despite our name, we are NOT a linux-only group.  We welcome people

not. NOT is not needed.

&gt; interested in other free or open source operating systems and related
&gt; software, including BSD and (to a lesser extent) Unix.  We form part of
&gt; an unnofficial support network, and people come to us looking for help.

... looking for help, discussion, and as community centred on everyone's
favourite Penguin.

&lt;aside -- I don't actually like the penguin. Don't tell anyone, particularly
the tux in my car&gt;

&gt; If you wish to promote free software in SA, particularly in businesses,
&gt; then helping others is the best way to go help yourself.

hmm... I don't lilke this sentence. I don't really know why. I guess I think
it's not needed.

&gt; 2. Posting
&gt;
&gt; When posting, bear in mind that the list is a public forum, with many
&gt; people who don't have much in common with yourself.  We ask that you
&gt; abide by the following guidelines:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Don't post in HTML.
&gt; 2. Wrap lines at about column 70.

1. Don't post in HTML. Plain text only please. Wrap lines at about column
70. Don't quote excessively. See <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/email.html">http://www.lemis.com/email.html</A> for a
thorough discussion.

2. Ensure that your message is legible and has a minimum of typos. If people
struggle to read your messages, they won't feel disposed to helping you.

&gt; 3. Use a descriptive subject line.

Add [OT], [AD], [PLUG] where appropriate. Change the subject line if the
subject of the message changes.

&gt; 4. Commercial postings are generally not welcome.  You may promote things
&gt;    that are relevant to our charter, but don't do it too much or often.

I have been thinking. I kinda think that they should be welcomed as long as
they are non-intrusive and clearly marked as commercial. No spam, no
repetition, etc... but IMHO, there's nothing wrong with someone offering a
Linux course, or a conference, or a new driver for their video card, or a
new video card with drivers or some other Linux-related commercial item
(Netcraft's RedHat CDs come to mind...) I'd change this to:

4. As long as you do it sparingly, you may promote commercial activities
that are relevant to our charter. Mark them clearly as commercial postings
(see 3.), and do it gently.

&gt; 5. Don't be unnecessarily rude, sarcastic or offensive.

remove "unnecessarily" -- it's unnecessary :)

&gt; 6. Don't take offense at what people say; they probably just expressed
&gt;    themself poorly, or you misunderstood what they meant.

themselves.

add: Either way, don't take it personally -- just shrug and move on.

&gt; 7. If you need technical help read the man pages, and search the web and
&gt;    archives (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html</A>)
&gt;    for answers first.

&gt; 8. If you can't work something out for yourself describe the problem
&gt;    clearly, and say what you already tried and what results that had.

... had. Be specific, include exact error messages, and the configuration of
your system. Refer to <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/questions.html">http://www.lemis.com/questions.html</A> ... or somethign
like that.


9. If you're responding to such a request, don't just say RTFM, point the
poster in the right direction. Tell them to search for the Foo HOWTO or give
a URL. Be aware that there's often more than one way to solve a problem, and
the reasons why your way is the best way may not be immediately apparent to
all readers.

&gt; 9. Enjoy our group.

10. Enjoy our group. We do.

(this way we can call it "The 10 Polite Requests"

&gt;
&gt; Basically, write in a considerate, helpful manner, and we can all
&gt; get along
&gt; fine, just fine.

cool... Simple is good. If anyone wants to distill this further, feel free.

PS we should also footnote the abbvreviations so newbies can read them...
(eg RTFM...)
