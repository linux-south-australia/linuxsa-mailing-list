Hi There,
    As I understand it, most rechargeable batteries develop
a "memory" after a while (yes even those ones that aren't
supposed to like Ni hydride). A deep cycle is basically done
by hooking the battery up to a recharging machine that is
very sensitive and it charges and discharges the battery by
reversing the voltages on the terminals so that the battery
is completely charged full and then completely discharged
fully (not just discharged to a point where the
laptop/phone/etc cannot use it any more) several times. This
machine forces the terminals to "flip over", which is
normally a very bad thing, until the battery "forgets" it's
memory.

    The upside of this is that after being deep cycled, a
battery is almost like new and it is a very cost effective
way to renew an old battery. The downside is that the deep
cycling, because it "flips" the terminals, the battery can
physically and/or chemically break down, and the battery is
destroyed. This is not so bad as it seems since the battery
is basically unusable before deep cycling anyhow in most
cases. If you want a more techo explanation, then I suggest
that you contact Pacific Dunlop and ask them, but that was
basically how they explained it to me. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; Does anyone know what a "deep cycle" is?
&gt; I just ask because I have 7 or 8 Toshiba Ni-MH batteries
&gt; and a couple of Li-ION batteries that are dead or dying.
&gt; If I could get them "deep cycled" then that would save me
&gt; a fortune.

&gt; Hi there,
&gt;     I would recommend contacting Pacific Dunlop Batteries
or
&gt; there is also a place that was on Pulteney St in Adelaide
&gt; who refurbished all kinds of batteries. These places can
do
&gt; all sorts of things to help you and they are reasonably
&gt; cheap and reliable. Pacific Dunlop used to be able to
"deep
&gt; cycle" a rechargeable battery that was dead or dying for
&gt; about $10 and resurrect it. If it didn't work, it was only
&gt; $10, if it did, it saved you about $80 for a brand new
one.
&gt;
&gt;     Both these places repack batteries and may turn 2 into
1
&gt; for you at minimal cost. Hope this helps.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Greetings,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have 2 Toshiba li-ION PA2487U battery packs
&gt; &gt; 1 with good cells in a damaged housing
&gt; &gt; 1 with bad cells in an undamaged housing
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd like to transfer the contents of one to the other.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone pulled one of these things apart?
&gt; &gt; It looks like it will come apart with a bit of care, but
&gt; I'd like to
&gt; &gt; know how, I don't want to damage it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Alternatively, does anyone have dead battery packs of
this
&gt; flavour?
&gt; &gt; Perhaps if I had a few that could be "sacrificed" I
could
&gt; then learn how
&gt; &gt; to refurbish them without destroying their housing.
&gt; &gt;
