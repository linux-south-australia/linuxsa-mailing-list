Tell, me, Jeremy:  In what way do these two alternatives differ?

 &gt; I am also aware that there aren't many, if not any, local ISP's who offer
 &gt; unlimited bandwidth for similar deals as the "big" companies such as $24.95
 &gt; per month unlimited etc.

That's because it's a loss-making proposition.  Even for the big companies.
They lose millions of dollars per month;  the only reason they keep doing
it is because they're being bankrolled by the billion-dollar multinationals
that own them, gambling on the totally unfounded suspicion that they might
one day be profitable if they achieve a high-enough market share.

That hasn't happened anywhere in the world.  Which is why there are two
types of ISPs out there: Those which charge realistic prices and deliver
exceptional quality network performance, and those who haemorrage money,
deliver crappy performance, and get bought or bankrupted within a couple
of months or years of their inception.

It doesn't make any sense.  These companies routinely run out of cash and
go bankrupt, and nobody who is in the Internet Industry is ever the least
bit surprised.

A year ago it was EISA.  Now it's Dingo Blue Internet.  In 12 months time
it'll be iPrimus.  Calling these companies "businesses" is only possible
under the loosest possible definition of the term, because they are not,
and never will be, profitable ventures.

 &gt; I in all ways will recommend to friends / clients
 &gt; etc to use the services of Local ISP's to help keep business in SA, and to
 &gt; assist the preventions of monopolies in the big companies. However, when it
 &gt; comes to myself, I KNOW BETTER. I have done research, it is possible for me
 &gt; to obtain unlimited bandwidth from big ISP's for my use.

... on a temporary basis, and only by assisting the marketplace in its
mission to gouge the profitability out of whatever provider you happen to
try to use, and only on connections where your network performance is
at the mercy of the oversubscription rates offered by your ISP.
You are the first person I've ever heard who has something positive to 
say about iHug Ultra -- Everyone else I've talked to has had crappy 
performance.  Everyone who is even loosely associated with the industry
knows that they've oversubscribed the crap out of their Satellite bandwidth.

For what it's worth, Jeremy, ISPs who are actually interested in survival
are not terribly interested in offering $29.95 per month "all-you-can-eat"
plans precisely because of people like you:  People who insist on their
right to download 20 Gbytes per month without paying for it.  Why would
any business (ISP or otherwise!) want a client base comprised almost
exclusively of people who want to use as many resources as possible
without paying any money?

 &gt; Primus offer
 &gt; 1.5MBPS ADSL $120 per month or so unlimited bandwidth for residential use

... yes, and their gateway to the Internet is so woefully congested that
the only people who want to use them are the people who aren't yet connected.
Why would you pay $120 per month for an ADSL service which gives you the
same performance as a 56k modem?  

iPrimus will not continue to offer that plan on a long-term -- it's
unsustainable, and it provides inadequate revenue for infrastructure
growth (so they've only been doing it for a few months and it's already
congested beyond usability -- where's the revenue stream to pay for the
next bandwidth upgrade?)

 &gt; ... I think I would be deluding myself for saying sorry, no, I'd rather
 &gt; purchase ISDN from another provider, re-badged as "DSL" and pay shit loads
 &gt; for bandwidth ????

That's not a delusion, Jeremy.  You really *do* need to pay shitloads
for bandwidth, because it costs shitloads in the wholesale marketplace.
It may be inconvenient, but it's a fact of life regardless.

 &gt; I know John, you have a certain obligation to your employer to push
 &gt; "pay for bandwidth", but really it is this thinking which is holding
 &gt; back Internet in this country

&lt;boggle&gt;  I'm sorry, Jeremy?  It's "held back"?  For your information,
Australia has one of the highest take-up rates in the world.  The ISPs who
are interested in continuing as viable business entities also offer some
of the highest performance connections in the world.  What possible reason
would you have for believing that ISPs are "holding back" the Internet
when it's thriving?

Oh!  Silly me!  When you say, "holding back", you mean that you're bothered
that the Internet actually costs you some money.  Sorry, I should have 
guessed...

 &gt; (... don't you even use the Ihug dish yourself ??). With some
 &gt; intelligent restructuring, I'm sure that even the smaller local ISP's who
 &gt; use peering networks, caches, and have multi-hommed links to the net, would
 &gt; be able to push for volume sales and offer unlimited bandwidth to their
 &gt; clients, without significant loss to the ISP owner.

It's obvious that you've never been even slightly involved in the Internet
Industry (except from your obvious involvement in hastening the bankruptcy
of the unviable ISPs you seem to insist on using).  

And what's this "... without significant loss..." stuff?!  A business 
isn't interested in a proposition where offering service to a customer
can be done "without significant loss," they're interested in when it 
can be done "with profit."  What planet are you living on, where you think
it should be ok for ISPs to offer you service "without significant loss",
and how many loss-making customers should an ISP reasonably expect to
tolerate?
