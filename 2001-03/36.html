Having also read your post about the incorproation issues in Vic, I can't
agree more that we need local advice.

I think your idea about getting insurance that would cover any LUG is
a brilliant one and should be pursued as far as is practicable.

As you suggest, I think long term this would very much encourage the
emergence of other LUGs and other allied groups - eg open source groups.

This may be an area where foresight in drafting the consitution, rules and
regs will be valuable.

Eg we might have a section that allows the committe to deem any other
group a "chapter" or member of of linuxsa. Obviiously we need to find out
about insurnace policies first.

I guess what I am suggesting(in a ling winded way) is taht we find out
about insurance policies that might suit our purpsoes and then draft
relvenat sections in the consitution to easily allow our insurance ot be
allpied to other suitable(whatever "suitable" is - as defined buy the
comittee presumably ) groups.

&gt; In NSW, cost is about $1,000 first year and $500pa afterwards. It costs
&gt; about $400 for incorporation, but you must have a public liability
&gt; policy, which costs about $500-$600pa. The cost of the public liability
&gt; policy is a major 
&gt; 
&gt; Incorporation means you exists as a legal enitity and this can protect
&gt; office bearers/members from being sued individually in certain events.
&gt; 
&gt; Slug finally went for incorporation as we needed it to hire community
&gt; halls/venue/etc. Very few places allow for non-incorporated groups to
&gt; use facilities.
&gt; 
&gt; Slug allows anyone to come to meetings and join the Slug List and
&gt; continues vigourous discussion otherwise. Current membership is $25pa
&gt; (chicken feed), which allows you to vote for committee and discounted
&gt; rates at Fests/other offers.
&gt; 
&gt; The cost of the public liability policy is a major imposition if you are
&gt; trying to start a LUG. Can I suggest that LinuxSA adopts an umbrella
&gt; position for all LUGS in SA and takes out a policy to cover all LUG
&gt; activities in SA. This way, you will find more LUGs springing up. There
&gt; is no way every township in SA can afford a public liability coverage.
