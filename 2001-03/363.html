&gt; Just wondering if anyone could advise me of a good linux-compatible
&gt; pcmcia modem card?

The ultimate is the 3Com 3CXFEM656C:
 - 56Kbps AT command modem+fax, RJ11 connector
 - 10/100Mbps ethernet, RJ45 connector
 - 1 slot, no dongles
 - 32bit cardbus PCMCIA

Watch the model number, as the earlier models of this
card was a WinModem.

About &lt;$500 retail.  We found it to be about $300 in
quantities &gt; 10, so I suggest that you shop about.

I'd strongly suggest that you buy a combo ethernet+modem
card, as there's a lot of upcoming competition for PC Card
slots (for example, DSPs to run voice and video encoding
are appearing on PC Cards).  Having an ethernet card also
means that you just need a cross-over cable to transfer
files between PCs -- I've found that to be more practical
when travelling than transfering files using floppy disks,
as the cable is smaller, lighter and more robust than the
floppy drive.

&gt; Also whether it would be cheaper to buy one in Australia or Europe?

Check out the web sites.  Harris Technology is pretty much
middle-of-the-road pricing for Australia.  <A HREF="http://www.ht.com.au/">http://www.ht.com.au/</A>
Pricing in the UK is said to be internationally competitive
but you've got to weigh that up against exchange rates.

If you are travelling I'd go with one of the big brand
names: some countries are still picky about what you
connect to their phone system and you might also find that
some smaller manufacturers don't appeciate the national
variations in things like number encodings for decadic
dialling.

Alternatively, Psion's "gold card" modem exists simply
because it has documented telco approvals in over 90
countries.  But it takes a slot just for the modem,
needs a dongle, and doesn't appear to be cheaply available
at retail (wholesale pricing must be good because Dell
supply it with their notebooks).
