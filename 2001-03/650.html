&gt; Subject: [OT] SGI Indy for sale
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I've got this computer that works, and is kinda cool, but I 
&gt; don't have a use for it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Specs:
&gt; SGI Indy
&gt; IRIX 6.2 (with what I suspect is the standard SGI software, no garantees)
&gt; MIPS R4400SC 100MHz CPU, with 1MB L2 cache (I think) and the 
&gt; biggest heatsink you ever did see.
&gt; 32Mb RAM
&gt; ~550Mb SCSI Hard Disk
&gt; Extra loud fan :)
&gt; Flat 17" Monitor (Sony Trinitron Tube) missing stand and bottom 
&gt; of case (note that this has a non-standard connector, so you 
&gt; can't just plug it into your PC, and I've tried to find adaptors, 
&gt; and they seem to be around $100, with no garantee of working)
&gt; IndyCam (with frayed connector, but appears to work OK. Manual 
&gt; focus, no zoom. A tad dark, and the computer can't really record 
&gt; at framerates over 4fps, but will display direct to screen no problems)
&gt; Some sort of Graphics capability, but I can't really tell what 
&gt; the card itself is. I'm guessing it's one of the lower spec ones 
&gt; -- looks to me like it could be 24 bit, but couldn't be sure.
&gt; 10BaseT and AUI Ethernet
&gt; I've been told it has ISDN, but personally, I don't know what to 
&gt; look for :)
&gt; External SCSI
&gt; Internal sound, with in/out/etc
&gt; PS/2 Mouse and SGI PS/2 Keyboard
&gt; Basically every I/O thing that was around at the time
&gt; No floppy, no CDROM
&gt; It's a funky SGI speckled greeny-blue colour, and the peripherals 
&gt; are speckled grey, but the keyboard is beige for some reason.
&gt; Original Box for case, no box for monitor.
&gt; Original Camtech Asset ID sticker :)
&gt; No garantees that anything I said here is correct or working 100% 
&gt; -- I've had it running, mucked about with it for a few hours, and 
&gt; haven't noticed any problems... It's kinda slow, but kinda cool, 
&gt; and I'm sure someone will have an interesting use for it (I 
&gt; imagine it would be faster under Linux, but I could be wrong).
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.exquip.com/silicongraphics/indy.shtml">http://www.exquip.com/silicongraphics/indy.shtml</A> seems to say a 
&gt; bit about general Indy stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm told you can run Linux on it if you mess about a little, but 
&gt; I haven't tried it.
&gt; 
&gt; Make a bid (offlist), I'll sell it to the best bid by Friday 
&gt; night... If you're going to use it for something cool, I might 
&gt; give you bonus points :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'd rather you picked it up from my place here in Blackwood, but 
&gt; will deliver or meet if it's too far...
