&gt;Well if I had a choice between low latency to sites in the US and high
&gt;to Australia, or low to Australia and high to the US I know what I'd
&gt;choose :-)

Yes, but we have a better standard of living here ;)
If you want a 1.5Mb or better unlimited ADSL link, moving to the US is
probably the cheapest way to get it right now.

&gt;&gt; does have enough money to pay for it. $/mb is one way of selling a
service
&gt;&gt; that lets you get the full speed out of the pipe you do have without
having
&gt;&gt; to pay to keep it full all the time when you don't need it.
&gt;
&gt;Though I understand this, I still wonder how the ISPs in the US manage
&gt;to not have volume charging - or are they losing money as well, or is
&gt;their cost structure different?

The cost structure has definately been different in the past, with similar
products in the US costing 1/10th of what Telstra would charge. The US has a
history of flat-rate pipes that probably comes from the first days of using
64K channels to transmit data with, and as we've seen on this list, it's
very hard to persuade people to use $/mb products once they've got a taste
for an 'unlimited' system. They also have more formal and
commercially-orientated peering points where the big guys exchange data.
Here it seems that peering is the activity of a medium-sized ISP.

Some regional areas have a very similar situation to Australia though, just
that it's localised monopolies instead of a national one. Even with all of
this disparity, prices for end users in Australia haven't been a whole lot
more than the difference in exchange rate.
