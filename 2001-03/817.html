&gt;So how can someone be a evil leacher if they are
&gt;leaching from the SAIX rather than at premium rates

Generally speaking, they're not. While SAIX and people who use it are cool,
it's lacking in the sorts of things leachers like to download. There's no
porn, no localised napster, no warez, very few sites with streaming video or
audio, and no reason for people to use VoIP over it since a local phone call
is 25c within Adelaide :)

Unless you want to suck redhat from netcraft (Camtech have sadly dropped
their SAIX link) or or ISO's from Ozbytes, it's very difficult to use a lot
of SAIX data.

&gt;(ie - direct from the internet) - if caches are used
&gt;widely - why is leaching so evil?  Surely it is a
&gt;matter of developing the technology of caching.  We

Caches are a finite resource, and the amount of load generated by peering
can be like adding another ISP or 2 worth onto an existing cache. When
you're download a web page, milliseconds add up, and a good ISP wants to
keep the wait as small as possible. Senet did some cool stuff with caching
and their CSS system to reduce the scaling problems of peering. I think that
it's goal was originally to turn SAIX into a big cache farm, but it never
worked out that way (mergers, aquisitions, political differences, the
then-new popularity of caching appliances).

&gt;So we can't cache absolutely every little web request -
&gt;granted - what if the cache were to look out
&gt;specifically for requests larger than one megabyte (or
&gt;whatever) and mirror these.  Sure it can not work by
&gt;file name - but by site I am sure it can.

Caches are finite. If you try to cache everything, you just run into
problems trying to figure out where it was cached. This is why caches are
expensive, you need a lot of ram to record the location of an object on
disk, and fast disks to seek quickly to the object to start sending data,
all while handling 100+ similar requests.

&gt;I have not heard anything about news servers.  I believe they are an
excellent caching technology.

A full newsfeed is something like 15Gb per day of new stuff, 90% of which
ISP customers will never read. It's hard enough just to delete the old stuff
and write the new stuff 24 hours a day without having to store it for any
extended length of time. SAIX already has news server sharing arrangements,
but news is not as popular as it used to be. Where I work, approximately 1
in 100 customers is interested in usenet news.

&gt;Could newservers ever be made more efficient by
&gt;allowing direct binary store rather than text encoded
&gt;binary only?  Just a thought.

Probably, there's a product developed with the CSIRO that does just that.
With it's proprietary software and thumbnail preview it represents an
excellent way to view multimedia content, although they deny that it's the
world's best porn browser. :)

&gt;I still don't understand why I should be told 'nup -
&gt;we told you - 500Mb is your limit - now don't whinge'
&gt;when the customer could be rewarded for using locally
&gt;stored content.

Like Simon said, it's difficult to cost-effectively categorise data this
way, although I believe it will become more important as a way of reducing
the costs of broadband. At the moment, none of the broadband suppliers have
any incentive to reduce prices for customers as demand is strong. Also, few
of them are interested in peering.

(Hmm.. I've just referred to tonights tea as 'cache' when it is in fact
'quiche'.. I wonder if there are any seafood restaurants that make squid
quiche..)
