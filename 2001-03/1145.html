&gt; well thanks, david, but what I asked was why isn't the "more * &gt; file" also
&gt; a "basic recipe"? Seems more basic -- almost not a recipe... but it acheives
&gt; pretty much the same thing, as far as I can see.

That's exactly what I was saying.  Using more is not a recipe, it's
a simple command.  You can't generalise it to pattern searching, or
tabulating values, or columnising; and it certainly won't do all of the
above at once.  The recipe I provided, in semantic terms, is:

  for a set of file from a specific set of files:
    perform a group of commands on each file

Whenever you need to do something to a set of files, other than a trivial
command, you will find yourself re-using that recipe.

While more appears to solve the problem, it isn't because of any promised
feature.  In fact more promises to break the file up into page sized
chunks, separating each chunk with a "more" prompt, and depending on the
value of the TERM environment variable, different control characters and
different screen sizes will be assumed.  It may well be that if you sit
at a MicroBee terminal the output will look like:

  ^Lfile1:
  blah blah
  ...
  blah blah
  ^[K4--More--^Lblah blah
   blah

Finally, when * matches only one file more doesn't output a file header.
More is not a correct solution.
