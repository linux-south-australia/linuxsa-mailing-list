Right it is my turn.

&gt; Frankly I believe David's responses to this thread indicate his unwillingness to act
&gt; in a manner that is suitable for all levels of users on this list.  It is also my
&gt; belief that until he does so LinuxSA will not grow or nurture new users in a manner
&gt; the community of LinuxSA  users deserve.

Tiddly winks and solid turds. We might dispense with a few newbies who
can't cope with seeing the truth being told. Be warned! TURN OFF THE
X-FILES!

&gt; His words speak volumes.

No. The original post was not up to standard, and so low as to allow
some to believe it is crap. I hate to point this out, but indicating
something is crap is a single fact - it doesn't speak voluemes.

&gt; And thanks for all the private mail too people, I will note give up on this,
&gt; LinuxSA deserves better

lol

So Michael has managed to create yet another flame war. He seems to be
better than me. Was that what he was trying to achieve? I think he was.
He has succeeded. But, s far as the original statement he made, it is,
will be, will continue to be wrong.

Do I make my point?

Incidentally, would SOMEONE mention the blasted Nazis? I'm getting bored
of this thread....
