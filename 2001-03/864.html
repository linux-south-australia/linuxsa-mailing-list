&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; 
&gt; I got to wondering if LWN was actually making enough money from its
&gt; advertising to support the wonderful stuff they do. As a result of this, I
&gt; thought about some other funding models they could use.

&lt;Gurgle!&gt;

Richard, you're actively advertising a company & it products on the list. I
was under the (possibly false) impression that that considered bad form.

This is the second time you've done this, first it was "/." (though to a
lesser extent), now this mob. Where does it end?

Until you sent that piece of spam (ridiculous word for junkmail) I'd never
heard of them, now I'll be even less inclined to visit their site if I see
it in a web search.

I see myself with three options here:-

1. Filter the thread.
2. Filter mail from you.
3. Unsubscribe from the list.

For the moment I'm going with option 1.

Allan
