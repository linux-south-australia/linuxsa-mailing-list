Apparently undocumented methods of revision number management
in CVS.


Just reporting back on the suggestion that several people
had that one should use CVS for keeping software
synchronised between multiple machines (even when there's
only one person writing it).....

The CVS software turns out to do most of what I wanted.
It does have a single point of failure though - the repository.
But I finally got it to work fairly efficiently, and over ssh.

The real struggle, though, comes in managing revision numbers.
I still have found no documentation of how to do this.

In the unlikely event that someone else out there:
1.	needs to know how to do this, and
2.	hasn't found out by trial and error or some other
	means (such as asking someone else),
here's an outline of how I solved the "issue".

---------------------------------------------------
A. To start work on revision 0.1.0:

Suppose you have source in ~/src/xyz.

cd ~/src/xyz
cvs import -m "blah" -d -b0.1.0 src/xyz vtag rtag
cd ..
cvs checkout -d xyz-0.1.0 -r0.1.0 src/xyz

The -r0.1.0 is essential. Otherwise it will not put the
required "tags" on files for use in future "commit" commands.
Then the next versions would be 0.2, 0.3 etc.

--------------------------------------------------
B. To create revisions 0.2.0, 0.3.0 etc.

cd ~/src
cvs checkout -d xyz-0.2.0 -r0.1 src/xyz
cd xyz-0.2.0
cvs commit -m "blah" -r0.2
cvs commit -m "blah" -r0.2.0

I.e. first you checkout revision 0.1, and then you
upgrade it to 0.2, and _then_ you create branch 0.2.0.
The only documented method for creating new branches
that I found was to use "cvs tag" and "cvs rtag",
which automatically allocate the revision numbers for
you, not necessarily anything like what you wanted.

--------------------------------------------------
C. When working on version 1.1.1 in ~/src/xyz-1.1.1,
   add new file "file1".

cd ~/src/xyz-1.1.1
cvs add -m "blah" file1
cvs commit -m "blah" -r1.1 file1
cvs commit -m "blah" -r1.1.1 file

The CVS will not let you just add file1 directly to the
branch. 

--------------------------------------------------
All of this, like all knowledge, is obvious when you know how.
But it tooke me 4 days and nights - or was it 5 - to work this
out from the man-manual, the online manual here:
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/index.html">http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/index.html</A>
and anything else I could find.
But mostly I just tried hundreds of different options and
looked at the files generated, and worked through it.

If the above know-how is not documented anywhere already,
I'll consider writing it up and putting it on my web-site.
Or contributing it to someone else's FAQ or manual?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Please don't flame me yet again for not knowing things
which are obvious.
Sometimes it is not _obvious_ that something _is_ obvious.

PPS. The CVS seems to have various purposely hidden "magic"
aspects in revision number allocation, which give special
significance to the numbers 0 and 2, and even numbers generally.
