well, you're in luck...I have just spent the past couple of days working
on getting rate limiting working on a slackware machine for a client so I
have been saturated in information on the topic. :)

It works rather well, I'm quite impressed with it considering it only took
a short while to figure out how to get things working.

It uses iproute2 which is just basically a linux version of what cisco
routers do, albeit a bit cutdown i think.

In iproute2 you'll be using a utility called tc (traffic control), it
handles all the setting up of containers and the rate limits across
individual ip's or entire subnets.

Here's a couple of links which helped me out:

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt; On our WAN, I often need to copy the odd large file between sites using
&gt; ftp or scp, but I find that my transfer is maxing out the bandwidth, such
&gt; that other users of the WAN are impacted. I know the BOFH would have a
&gt; solution to this which does not involve any impact on the file transfer,
&gt; but is there a way of slowing down the file transfer on a case-by-case
&gt; basis? (If it was middle of the night, I'd like full speed please..)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure I can do this in the cisco routers, but I'm hoping for a more
&gt; flexible solution..
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Michael
