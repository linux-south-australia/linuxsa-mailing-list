&gt; &gt; company where we installed this link and asked them about why they
ceased
&gt; &gt; their downloads and got very obvious answer: "We ran out of disk space".
&gt;
&gt;In Australia that isn't an impediment.  I've spoken to people here who use
&gt;their "Unlimited" plans to play a game between themselves:  They have races
&gt;to see who can fill up their hard disks first.

With the cost of writable CD's being under $1 if you shop around, there's
not much obstacle to burning data as fast as you download it. I knew a guy
who got Optus cable and downloaded 40GB in his first week of owning it,
determined to get every VCD he could lay his hands on for his home movie
collection. Optus may not have intended this when they offered an
"unlimited" service, but that's what he's entitled to.

When Telstra turned on "unlimited" access for cable, their international
link utilisation went from something like 30% to 99% and stayed there. They
have since had to change the way they handle this sort of account.

&gt; &gt; Unlimited traffic - it's just good for advertisment because most people
&gt; &gt; associate it with their freedom to download something but actually they
even
&gt; &gt; don't need it :)

Even people who don't set out to abuse the system will upset this line of
thinking. Video conferencing, online gaming, Internet radio stations, and
newsgroups for example can all contribute to a massive amount of data
transmitted but not stored on disk.

The days of the honour system for downloads are long gone, nowdays it's all
commercial and you can't offer a service without specifying exactly what the
customer is getting. If you offer unlimited downloads, the customer is
entitled to download an unlimited amount.
