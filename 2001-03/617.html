&gt; Is it really that much trouble to support LINUX? 

I'm truly surprised that any ISP bundles support with subscription fees.
It doesn't matter what platforms you offer support for, because the
fact is that computers are very complicated, probably infinitely so,
and I don't understand how any business can afford to say, "ask us and
we'll give you the answers."

Suppose you only support Windows, and the customer complains that
their browser keeps crashing: is that included?  Suppose the browser is
Opera: is that included?  Suppose they use Outlook express for mail,
and the modem disconnects when they poll for mail while viewing IBM's
research page if they also have Ultima Online running with an UO Assist
macroing in the background with sound turned off and a MP3 playing:
But that's not how it would be described; it would be described as
"the modem keeps disconnecting and I never have that trouble when I
connect through rebel.net."  How do you support that for "free"?  How do
you get a subscriber who doesn't that sort of support to pay for it?
It is bundled, after all.
