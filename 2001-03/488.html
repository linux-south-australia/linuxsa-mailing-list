Hi There,
    Try some of these:
        Firewall and Proxy Server HOWTO
        Security HOWTO
        Home Network Mini-HOWTO
        Configuration HOWTO

    Most of these recommend exactly what you want to do and
obviously Security is a BIG issue. The IPCHAINS HOWTO also
would come in handy, and also the Sendmail HOWTO also.

    One document I would highly recommend is Securing and
Optimising Linux, which is a free BOOK available in various
forms including PDF format from <A HREF="http://www.openna.com">http://www.openna.com</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/guides.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/guides.html</A> . The version of this
document that I have is the Redhat Edition, but it is
available for other distributions and also generically.

    Most of these documents will cross over some of the
stuff you need, but overall it is worth doing the research
(I know, I was hacked and didn't realise how open my system
really was until I read some of them and plugged the holes).

    A friend also suggested to me to get the
configure-sendmail script from Freshmeat, which makes
sendmail much easier to configure, I found it by doing a
search on Freshmeat, and it is only small. You also don't
need to run fetchmail to use it, only have it installed and
then uninstall it afterwards.

    Overall it takes about 5 mins to plug 95% of security
holes on a typical Linux system, and about 2 hours of
following these step by step HOWTOs to plug most of the
rest. I have now set up a couple of machines this way, and
learnt a great deal about security doing so.

    Further reading, try <A HREF="http://www.insecure.org">http://www.insecure.org</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.sans.org">http://www.sans.org</A> . Hope this helps (it should), and good
luck with your network.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Dual ethernet cards and Firewalling (I think)


&gt; Hello all
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering what documentation I should read to
implement the following;
&gt;
&gt; I need one server to have two ethernet cards, essentially
one as a
&gt; connection
&gt; to the outside world and one to facilitate an internal
intranet.
&gt;
&gt; What I am unsure about is how can I configure the machine
so only the server
&gt; can see out of the second ethernet card (the gateway to
the outsde world)
&gt; and so that
&gt; nothing on the outside can get in.
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be appreciated
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Harv
