&gt; Feel free to add to or disagree with anything here.

This is not a technical list.  It's a party attended by people with a
common technological interest.  Your suggestion completely overlooks
that.  Most of what we do is noise, and often interesting noise at that.
Your guide leaves the impression that the list must only be used for
linux and open source related messages, and we have never behaved in
that restricted way before.  I don't think we want to start now.

Rules are emotive.  The more rules you have the fewer people will agree
with them.  I discourage this whole guide idea as being a waste of time
and effort, but in the spirit in which it was intended, I offer the
following KISS inspired refinement:

----------------------------------------------
Unofficial LinuxSA Etiquette Guide.

1. About LinuxSA and the List

LinuxSA was started in 1996 as an informal Linux User Group aiming "To
promote and support Linux in South Australia".  The list subscribers
come from Adelaide, Rural SA, interstate and overseas, and not all speak
English as a first language.  They vary wildly in age from school-age
up to retiree, and their level of experience ranges from non-technical
newbie to linux kernel hacker.

Despite our name, we are NOT a linux-only group.  We welcome people
interested in other free or open source operating systems and related
software, including BSD and (to a lesser extent) Unix.  We form part of
an unnofficial support network, and people come to us looking for help.
If you wish to promote free software in SA, particularly in businesses,
then helping others is the best way to go help yourself.

2. Posting

When posting, bear in mind that the list is a public forum, with many
people who don't have much in common with yourself.  We ask that you
abide by the following guidelines:

1. Don't post in HTML.
2. Wrap lines at about column 70.
3. Use a descriptive subject line.
4. Commercial postings are generally not welcome.  You may promote things
   that are relevant to our charter, but don't do it too much or often.
5. Don't be unnecessarily rude, sarcastic or offensive.
6. Don't take offense at what people say; they probably just expressed
   themself poorly, or you misunderstood what they meant.
7. If you need technical help read the man pages, and search the web and
   archives (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html</A>)
   for answers first.
8. If you can't work something out for yourself describe the problem
   clearly, and say what you already tried and what results that had.
9. Enjoy our group.

Basically, write in a considerate, helpful manner, and we can all get along
fine, just fine.
