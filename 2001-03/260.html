&gt; I'm the Executive Director of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc
&gt; (EFA). I'm not sure if all of you know of EFA, so briefly, EFA is a
&gt; non-profit national organisation incorporated under South Australian
&gt; law in May 1994.  EFA is independent of government and commerce and
&gt; is funded by membership subscriptions and donations. EFA members are
&gt; users and operators of computer-based communications systems such as
&gt; the Internet, in South Australia and other States and Territories,
&gt; who are concerned with online rights.
&gt;
&gt; You are probably aware that the SA government has tabled a Bill intended,
&gt; among other things, to make it a criminal offence to make available, to
&gt; adults, information unsuitable for minors on the Internet. The Bill is
&gt; listed for debate in the SA Legislative Council sittings commencing 13
&gt; March. For more info and comprehensive analysis of the online services part
&gt; of the Bill: <A HREF="http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/sabill.html">http://www.efa.org.au/Campaigns/sabill.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; Various provisions in the Bill are inconsistent with the vision and
&gt; objectives of the SA Government's "Information Economy 2002: Delivering the
&gt; future" statement ("IE2002").
&gt;
&gt; EFA has prepared a draft open letter to the Premier (highlighting
&gt; inconsistencies with IE2002 and criminal justice issues) with a view to
&gt; issuing it as a joint open letter signed by a range of SA organisations,
&gt; businesses and reasonably prominent individuals. A copy of the draft letter
&gt; is appended.
&gt;
&gt; I had intended to ask if AUUG-SA would be willing to sign this letter.
&gt; Instead, would any of you feel able to sign it, either as Committee members
&gt; of AUUG in SA, or in any other capacity. If there's any problem with
&gt; particular wording, feel free to suggest change. If we make any changes
&gt; requested by anyone, we'd provide a revised draft to any other intending
&gt; signatories.

I personally think this is an issue which we should address.
Obviously we'll have to discuss this at the meeting next week.

&gt; We don't have a specific deadline in mind, but would hope to get it
&gt; out early next week latest, but whether we'll issue it as a joint
&gt; letter depends on whether sufficient signatories are obtained to
&gt; make it worthwhile as a joint letter.

*sigh* That was this week, I suppose.  I was in the USA then, and have
only just got round to catching up on my mail.  If your letter has
gone out, I suppose we can do our own next week.  Is there a date set
for the debate?

&gt; We'd also appreciate any suggestions of other potential signatories
&gt; in SA.

I'm copying Linuxsa, but they're not a registered body.  Presumably
individuals could sign this letter as well, couldn't they?

&gt; ======
&gt; The Hon John Olsen
&gt; Premier
&gt; Parliament House
&gt; ADELAIDE SA 5000
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Dear Premier
&gt;
&gt; Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) (Miscellaneous)
&gt; Amendment Bill 2000
&gt;
&gt; In "Information Economy 2002: Delivering the future" ("IE2002"), your
&gt; government set out a vision of South Australia as an information-enabled
&gt; society, stating that the "Information Economy is ushering in a new
&gt; approach to communication and interaction that will ultimately impact on
&gt; everyone - economically, commercially, socially and culturally. It's
&gt; dramatically changing the old, familiar order of things, but it's also
&gt; offering new opportunities to grow, to prosper, to benefit socially and
&gt; culturally, and to enjoy". (<A HREF="http://www.ie2002.sa.gov.au/plan/statement.htm">http://www.ie2002.sa.gov.au/plan/statement.htm</A>)
&gt;
&gt; Just five months later, your government tabled legislation that is
&gt; inconsistent with the primary objective of IE2002 of ensuring "that all
&gt; South Australians are encouraged and enabled to participate in the
&gt; Information Economy, locally, nationally and globally".
&gt;
&gt; The Online Services section of the Classification (Publications, Films and
&gt; Computer Games) (Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 2000 ("the Bill") makes it a
&gt; criminal offence to make information available _to adults_ online that is
&gt; legal off-line, i.e. "matter unsuitable for minors". The Bill thus mandates
&gt; that the knowledge base readily accessible to adults on South Australian
&gt; Internet sites will be restricted to information suitable for minors.
&gt; According to the OFLC guidelines this means, among other things, that
&gt; discussion of "adult themes" including "suicide, crime, corruption, marital
&gt; problems, emotional trauma, drug and alcohol dependency, death and serious
&gt; illness, racism, religious issues" will be illegal online unless expressed
&gt; in a "discreet" manner, that is, "with little or no detail and generally
&gt; brief" (see OFLC Guidelines for the MA classification, the highest rating
&gt; that would be legal online in South Australia).
&gt;
&gt; Your government rightly said in IE2002 that the Information Economy is
&gt; "dramatically changing the old, familiar order of things", yet it appears
&gt; your government's response to the challenges of a global communications
&gt; medium is to apply the old, familiar order of things - a classification and
&gt; censorship regime designed some three decades ago for an entirely different
&gt; medium, the public exhibition of movies. Not all aspects are familiar
&gt; however. Serious criminal justice issues also arise indicating intent to
&gt; treat ordinary South Australians and businesses providing information
&gt; on-line less fairly under criminal law than off-line information providers.
&gt; The Bill:
&gt;
&gt; - criminalises inability to foresee a non-unanimous decision of the
&gt; Commonwealth Classification Board
&gt; - denies Information Economy participants the right to obtain a
&gt; classification prior to providing information online, as is granted to
&gt; off-line publishers
&gt; - fails to require that information be classified before police commence
&gt; prosecution
&gt; - does not appear to require that "Internet content" be classified at all
&gt; in order to prove an allegation, unlike in the case of an allegation about
&gt; a film, publication or computer game
&gt; - subjects Information Economy participants to a maximum penalty double
&gt; that applicable to off-line publishers
&gt; - is inconsistent with Commonwealth law and more restrictive than Internet
&gt; censorship laws in Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory
&gt; (others have no Internet specific censorship laws yet)
&gt; - invites constant enquiry as to the particular State or Territory laws at
&gt; issue as the law does not specify in which jurisdiction an offence (making
&gt; available or supply) takes place, i.e. the location of: the host server;
&gt; the content provider; or the person who downloads the material, each of
&gt; which may be in different States.
&gt;
&gt; While the Bill provides that online publishers may defend themselves in a
&gt; court by proving that access was subject to a restricted access system, by
&gt; the time a case reaches court the defendant will have had his/her
&gt; reputation tarnished and will have incurred substantial legal costs.
&gt; Furthermore, restricted access systems require information providers to
&gt; collect personal information about visitors that goes far beyond proof of
&gt; age (credit card, passport or birth certificate etc.) prior to granting
&gt; access. The Bill disregards the costs of collecting such information, the
&gt; delay and inconvenience to intending visitors and provides no privacy
&gt; protection whatsoever for visitors, notwithstanding that in IE2002 your
&gt; government noted that "The emerging Information Economy calls for a
&gt; legislative and institutional environment that gives
&gt; ...consumers...confidence in the integrity and security of...personal
&gt; information". Information providers are likely to avoid the risks and costs
&gt; and publish outside South Australia, and intending visitors to any sites
&gt; that are made available in South Australia are likely to turn to overseas
&gt; sites rather than reveal personal information.
&gt;
&gt; Rather than encourage uptake of SA Connect for provision of information
&gt; online, the Bill encourages South Australians to avail themselves of free
&gt; overseas sites where they can publish equally easily with relative impunity
&gt; from criminal prosecution resulting from the unpredictable and inconsistent
&gt; decisions of the members of the Commonwealth Classification Board, Review
&gt; Board and police.
&gt;
&gt; Virtual communities in South Australia are also likely to be adversely
&gt; affected since the Bill covers content placed not only on the Web, but also
&gt; archived mailing lists and messages to newsgroups, etc. Individuals,
&gt; educational institutions, non-profit organisations, businesses, and
&gt; governments who "make available" archival facilities in their Web space for
&gt; public discussion, to which the whole world can contribute, would be liable
&gt; to criminal prosecution for "making available" material unsuitable for
&gt; minors should participants post such information. The SA Government would
&gt; risk prosecution under its own laws in relation to its Talking Point forum
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.talkingpoint.sa.gov.au/forum/Forum35/HTML/000016.html">http://www.talkingpoint.sa.gov.au/forum/Forum35/HTML/000016.html</A>) unless
&gt; public servants pre-screen messages, or monitor the forum on a minute by
&gt; minute basis deleting any material that might be deemed unsuitable for
&gt; minors.
&gt;
&gt; It is doubtful that the SA Government will be successful in "encourag[ing]
&gt; libraries, educational and cultural institutions and companies to make
&gt; information such as reference materials...widely available online" nor in
&gt; maintaining SA's "branded node in the academic world, and in the world of
&gt; the arts and ideas" when artworks, ideas and research papers published in
&gt; the online environment must be expressed in a non-detailed and brief manner
&gt; suitable for minors. Information collections from an art gallery, library
&gt; or university which would typically be considered a perfectly legal
&gt; resource off-line, if published online may well attract prosecution online
&gt; due to the application of more restrictive censorship guidelines designed
&gt; for entertainment in the form of movies.
&gt;
&gt; Your government could best demonstrate a commitment to the vision set out
&gt; in IE2002 by not only talking about 'virtual communities' but by ensuring
&gt; that South Australian individuals, institutions and businesses are able to
&gt; participate in the Information Economy without fear of prosecution under
&gt; criminal law due to inability to foresee a non-unanimous decision of the
&gt; Commonwealth Censorship Board.
&gt;
&gt; While the objective of protecting children is laudable, the proposed law
&gt; will not achieve that aim as the vast quantity of information online
&gt; globally that is unsuitable for minors is outside the reach of South
&gt; Australian law. Most of the information that would be illegal online in
&gt; South Australia is protected speech in other parts of the world. No other
&gt; Australian jurisdiction has criminalised the provision of "matter
&gt; unsuitable for minors" to adults online. No other Western democracy has
&gt; implemented laws similar to those proposed.
&gt;
&gt; As stated in IE2002 "In an increasingly borderless world, the Internet
&gt; provides the tools to interconnect people, both locally and globally,
&gt; around their common interests - be those interests economic, cultural or
&gt; social". The most effective and workable approach to any problem that may
&gt; arise from the free flow of information in a borderless world is not the
&gt; age old response of censorship, it is Information Economy literacy.
&gt;
&gt; We call on the South Australian Government to introduce as a matter of
&gt; priority the education component of IE2002 of equipping students and all
&gt; citizens "for life-long learning through effective use of information
&gt; technology and online services".
&gt;
&gt; A demonstrated commitment to equipping South Australians with information
&gt; literacy skills and to manage their own access to online information, and
&gt; that of minors in their care, will be most effective in protecting children
&gt; and assist South Australia to capture attention as envisaged "as a hot spot
&gt; within the global Information Economy - giving South Australia a new
&gt; prominence on the world map, creating a branded identity in a crowded
&gt; global village". Responding to the challenges of the Information Economy by
&gt; application of a decades old censorship regime designed for movies is
&gt; likely to lead to South Australia becoming "irrelevant and relegated to the
&gt; periphery of global activity" as a result of being seen to have a
&gt; government that does not "get the Internet".
&gt;
&gt; We urge you to discard unjust and unworkable censorship plans and ensure
&gt; that South Australia continues along the path envisioned in IE2002.
