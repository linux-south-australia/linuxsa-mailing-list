yeah - I have just about had it with Primus.  I only ever joined owing to their cheap prices.  Now that other companies are just as competitive - there is no reason to stay with them.

Their technical support is a joke and they are a bit dodgy for my liking.  The threatened to take me to court once after I emailed them several times as well as calling to advise of an address change and my bill never got to me.

Despite several reminder emails - the DSL consultant (Michael) never once returned my email regarding questions about theire 12 month contract.

It smells a bit one.hell-ish / hellstra-ish for me to be comfortable.

Has anyone used AAPT?  They will be offering ADSL soon.

&gt;Hi Mike!
&gt;We discussed your friend's link over the phone whilst I was still in
&gt;Adelaide.
&gt;
&gt;iPrimus' intranet seems fine.
&gt;If I dialup to iPrimus in Adelaide & ping my ADSL host in Sydney, it is
&gt;quite good.
&gt;But connecting from outside their intranet, e.g. from Telstra Bigpond
&gt;cable, its garbage.
&gt;
&gt;Would you agree that:
&gt;1)
&gt;20-30% packet loss is unacceptable for a broadband connection.
&gt;2)
&gt;This much packet loss is likely to cause non-cacheable web-pages to be
&gt;unreliable downloading?
&gt;Such pages would include on-line forms such as found on web-based email
&gt;accounts.
&gt;3)
&gt;It is not unreasonable to expect iPrimus to rectify this problem
&gt;considering equivalent ISPs can achieve 0% packet loss under the same
&gt;conditions?

&gt;&gt; Hi
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; A Permanent link that a friend had with iprimus was just as bad. After a few
&gt;&gt; hours of connection time I would ping his link and one out of 4 pings being
&gt;&gt; lost.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cheers
