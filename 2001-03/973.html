&gt; &gt; Yes what does it say? That if you pay $110 per annum to join auug you

&gt; 
&gt; You know better than to encourage such ideas.  I am not AUUG.  I am not
&gt; even typical of AUUG's management.  What I say, unless I say it using
&gt; one of my AUUG identities, is personal opinion.
&gt; 
&gt; To try to attach *my* ideas on to a third party is vile and petty
&gt; politicking.

Wellt eh fct of the matter is that you did runa meetign a few weeks ago to
which alllinuxsa peopel were invited to attend and yourere one of the
peopel whoi sat out the front.


So whether you olike it or not, people may associate you with their
perception of a tpyical member.



&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does it say that a free or compatritvely low cost organisation such as
&gt; &gt; linuxsa can do just as well as auug with a lot more understanding
&gt; 
&gt; My post was as a linuxsa member, to the linuxsa list.  Aside from the
&gt; overt message that the original idea was crap, which it was, my message
&gt; could carry the covert idea that if you post crap to the list you'll
&gt; get called up on it.


&gt; Please observe that what I said has been indepepdantly verified.
&gt; This debate surely isn't about the veracity of what I said.  So who
&gt; amongst us thinks we shouldn't call crap crap?  How many times must we
&gt; suffer the same crap before we start calling it crap?  I reckon some of
&gt; us will say "me, and forever."  I reckon some will also say otherwise.
&gt; 

No it is not about what you said but about how you said it.

I think we should call "crap" "faeces".

In other words we shoull try and use "nice" language  to decribe it, so
that there is no or little room for ambiguity for   inthe toem of the
delivery.

It gets the messgae across with out possibly upsetting people.

Without perhaps intimidating peopel or making them feel uncomforatable.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; That sort of behaviour only reinforces a (not necesarily well founded) 
&gt; &gt; perception I think some linuxsa members have that auug is a bit elitiest
&gt; &gt; and not necesarily interested in beginner or trival problems.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm an Australian before an AUUG member.  Reductio absurdum: "That sort
&gt; of behaviour only reinforces a perception that Australian's are a bit
&gt; elitiest [sic]"
&gt;

But you arent an austaralian parlimentaria, you arent the prime minister
and you arent trying on this list/to this audience to attract new
australians.

I think you are tryign to attract new auug members.
