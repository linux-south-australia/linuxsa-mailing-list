I will push hard for a library.  It just strikes me as a terrible waste of money and paper to purchase books that are obsolete quickly and that I may read a few times and then not use again and not part with because of the money I have spent.

It just seems to be a more effective use of funds to pool our resources for such things.  I think it is important.  How many of us have texts lying around doing nothing?  Would we not prefer to have them put to use?  And of course if we want to lobby for Linux to be taken up by disadvantaged / low income groups and non-profit organisations - then we will have more success if we can avail documentation to these people.

I don't see Microsoft availing software and texts to people unless it will grant them some political or economic advantage.

Jason - that is a great idea to write the software.  A web based inventory and loaning system would be essential.

Forget the Internet - many people prefer books for obvious reasons and there is always the copyright issue.  I would never condone breaking copyright if the restrictions are reasonable.

&gt;&gt; It's all a bit 1990's, isn't it? :-)  I can't quite understand the point
&gt;&gt; of lugging a library around from meeting to meeting when we're all connected
&gt;&gt; to the Internet.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Presumably becasue:
&gt;a) electronic versionoff books arent as common as we'd like(there does
&gt;seem to be a good umber of OReilly's titels in electronic formts)
&gt;b) publshing the text of books in an electronic form may well have soe
&gt;copyrright "issues"
&gt;
&gt;Of course the library need not be lugged, it could remain in one place and
&gt;the booking and returns could be arranged electronitcally.
&gt;
&gt;It is possibel tht under this scenario the whole library may not beed to
&gt;be lugged just those titles going in and out - iwth poular titles this
&gt;owudl probably mean just taking them from one person and hadnign tehm to
&gt;the next at the meeting.
&gt;
&gt;It is also possible that the library not be conducted at the meeting.
&gt;Eg a sutiable locaton perhaps a business with an interest in the
&gt;organistion host the library. Loans and returns coudl then occur during
&gt;nomal business hours at a set location - look Ma no lugging!!
&gt;
&gt;Once again reservation etc coudl ahppen electronicallyviw the we and the
&gt;books woudl meerely need to be checked in and out when physically
&gt;returned/borrowed.
&gt;
&gt;I would be happy to write the software for this if we ever do
&gt;do this and an appropriate system does not already exist, however it might
&gt;not happen tomorrow, my spare time is not as copiuous as I'd like.

&gt;no "lug" puns intended
