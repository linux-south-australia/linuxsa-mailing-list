&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone see much of a demand for this type of presentation?  I am judging from the broad cross section of the community represented last year that some people would be interested in hearing about and discussing these points.

I think it wouyld be a good presentation to make, because it seems to me
one of the first thing the great unwashed crowds want ot know is "how can
all this good stuff be free - the ms equivilant cots me thousands?".

I also as I did last year think ti would be a good thign to have a
"business stream" of presentations at the 'fest or as a separate event to
provide info on businesses about linux and its potential in enterprises.

Perhaps some of the local companies that make money from open
source might like to consider this.

Obviously suuch an event/stream would need to be publicised in different
forums and perhaps mor emethodically.

I dont have the time to organise such a thing and am petrified of
public speaking, but I think it would be valauble for those companies in
particular and for linux generally.
