&gt; Australia's bandwidth and infrastructure costs aren't too different

non-US is actually a pretty critical point. I think that people's
expectations have been set by what those in the US can do.  Want a
good fast cheap link? Move to the US - however you will be paying
_heap_ more in house/appartment rent :-)

&gt; As far as I can tell, ACT and then Perth will have 50Mbps
&gt; to the home in about 2 and 4 years respectively from projects
&gt; deliberately designed to break the telco duopoly.  

Will breaking the duopoly really decrease the prices significantly?
From what I've seen of TransACT's prices they're not that different
from say Telstra's ADSL (for the same amount of bandwidth into the
home). Traffic is free on the internal network (which will be great if
there is enough content on it) but you still have to pay to get to the
'outside' world at about the same rates.
