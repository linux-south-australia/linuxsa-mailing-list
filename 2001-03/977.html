&gt; &gt; Wellt eh fct of the matter is that you did runa meetign a few weeks ago to

&gt; It's a complicated world, Jason.  Sometimes people have many hats to wear.
&gt; I try to make it clear which hat I'm wearing by assigning different email
&gt; addresses to different hats.

One of the simple things is that people tend to respond well when treated
with a modicum of repect and will contribute more if they dont thihk tehy
will be heckled or belittled for makeing an error. 

Organisations are judged by their members behaviour. You dont have ot like
it, but you should and presuambly do undertand that.
This is one of the not so simple parts of our world.

The more prominent that member the more people will judge the organisation
by that member.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So whether you olike it or not, people may associate you with their
&gt; &gt; perception of a tpyical member.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think you suffer this confusion, and I can't see any useful purpose
&gt; being served by you spreading it even further.
&gt; 

I am not spreading anything except my opinion.

I did comment on how I thought that such behaviour might contribute to
peoples (__not necesarily well founded__)perceptions.

However I will say it again. 
I see no useful purpose in saying someone's answer is "crap".
I dont see the use in _that_ at all.

I think there are nicer ways to convey error without belittling people or 
calling their effort "crap". 

I think that the tone you chose while probably not calculated to do so,
will have the effect of discouraging people from trying to help, and
might discourage others from asking for help.

And as I've said I think it may reinforce some perception that people have
about other organisations you belong to.
