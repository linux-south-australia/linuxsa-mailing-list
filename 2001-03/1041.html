rms and I had some fun with this last Friday.  What we came up with
was (<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/~grog/foot-in-mouth.html">http://www.lemis.com/~grog/foot-in-mouth.html</A>):

Tux, Beastie killed in England; GNU still at large

Tux the Linux Penguin and Beastie the BSD Demon have been killed as
part of the effort to prevent the spread of Foot-in-Mouth disease
across England. Authorities are now seeking GNU, the gnu which is
Tux's usual companion.

Tux, Beastie and GNU were on a walking tour of the English countryside
yesterday when the farm they were passing through was quarantined upon
finding Foot-in-Mouth present in several of the pigs. The English
Minister of Agriculture ordered all animals on the farm destroyed and
burned.

Tux and Beastie were briefly quarantined with the pigs and other
animals on the farm. Reports say that they both protested against
being treated like animals. Agriculture Agents were quick to point out
that Tux was a penguin and thus an animal. He was shot soon thereafter
and tossed onto the pyre.

Beastie presented a better case, "I am not an animal, I am a demon,"
he claimed. "I wear shoes, unlike the penguin and most other animals."
He was shot for being an affront to the Church of England and tossed
onto the pyre. Beastie, being from the lower planes of Hell, did not
burn, and Agriculture Agents had to enlist the help of the Church to
dispose of the body with holy water.

GNU escaped by running faster than the authorities' machines could
follow, and is still free.

"The penguin burned up like a match...", stated Bill Wooden, a local
farm hand, "...especially after we covered him with petrol, but the
demon fizzled the entire evening. I am glad they called in the
Church. The way his body twitched in the fire was creeping me out."

Farmer Bob Haywood, owner of the farm where the events took place, was
greatly upset at the slaughter of his herd of pigs. He also, stated,
"What's Linux? Where did the penguin come from?" David Bryne, English
Sub-Minister of Agriculture for the region, stated: "If Penguins and
Demons are spreading this horrible disease, then they will be dealt
with as necessary!"

Word has spread of underground groups in England and through out the
world of people who are said to worship the Penguin or the Demon. Most
of them are unaware of the GNU. These groups are socialist in nature,
with a "Gift-Culture", and with the connotation "User Groups", police
suspect they may be violent drug addicts. English police are searching
out the groups to see if they are purposely spreading Foot-in-Mouth in
a drug induced outburst against society.

    posted at segfault.org. This version hacked by Richard Stallman
    and Greg Lehey.
