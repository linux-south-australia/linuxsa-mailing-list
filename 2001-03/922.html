Don't worry, all of the people you're speaking to here are unlikely to
answer the phone in ISP sales or tech support :)
 
&gt; I would have thought - unless there is some sort of
&gt; status quo that you need to protect - that you would
&gt; have supported us if we came up with ideas that can
&gt; lower costs for ISPs and we were trying to help you as
&gt; well as ourselves.

Unfortunately for you, most of these ideas came up and were explored or
shot down 4-5 YEARS AGO. There are thousands of people in the industry
trying to figure out how to get a competitive advantage out of shifting
bytes in a certain way, and there aren't many ways you can make a byte
different or cheaper. The odds are stacked against you if you think you
can figure out a better way.

Every now and then, someone does come up with a better way, there are
even people in mathematics departments at universities who work out
these sorts of plans. Unfortunately, they tend to be difficult to
understand or lack appeal for end users, so they're not marketable and
hence give no competitive advantage.
