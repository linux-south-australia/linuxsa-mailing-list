 &gt; So what's the problem with ADSL being differentiated like this?  Why
 &gt; am I evil if I want unlimited downloads if I am willing to be reasonable
 &gt; about it?  Ie - happy to download from a cache with is probably faster
 &gt; anyhow. 

So who gets to pay to get the data into the cache in the first place?
The first person who downloads it?  What if that person is you?  Because
if you have to pay for it, we'll hardly be able to describe your account
as "unlimited", will we?  So what you're proposing is that someone else
should pay for everything you download, as long as you restrict your 
downloads to a cache.

So, should that person (who isn't you) feel a bit upset about having to
pay *more* to subsidize your subsequent "leeching"?  I know that if I was
using an ISP who had that policy, I'd either change ISPs or jump onto  
the same "unlimited" account as you, so that I wouldn't have to pay for
other peoples' Internet activity.

So, when  *everyone* remaining at that ISP has decided that they'd like to
be on the type of account which gave them unlimited downloads and no
obligation to pay for populating data in the cache, who'll pay for it then?

You seem to think that cache savings aren't already factored into your
ISP bills.  Think again.

You, Jason Tan, and all sorts of other people seem to think that caches
are some kind of magic bullet which provide ISPs with a free lunch which
they aren't sharing with their customers.  Think again.

There is nothing magically cheap about caches (or that other bugbear,
the "price-per-megabit" non volume-charged net link).  Everything that
an ISP receives, whether it goes into the cache, or comes over a 
fixed-price-per-month link, can be reduced to a price per megabyte. 
The *only* effects a cache has are to (a) reduce the effective average
cost per megabyte, and (b) increase perceived speed for cached objects.
So why shouldn't the ISP pass that price-per-megabyte on to the customers
that have downloaded the traffic, rather than (as you seem to be suggesting)
spreading it over the customers who *haven't* downloaded the traffic so
that you can get a free ride?

Or, to put it another way, why are you insisting that other people 
subsidize your net links by paying more for what they download than you
do?
