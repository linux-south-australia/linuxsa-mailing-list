Hi Folks,

Sorry for the repost, but Gaelyne rightly pointed out that I did not say
what LWN was.

I got to wondering if Linux Weekly News (www.lwn.net) was actually making
enough money from its advertising to support the wonderful stuff they do.
As a result of this, I thought about some other funding models they could use.

I find that LWN is such a valuable resource, but this can often only be
determined after reading it for a while. They have been around since 1998,
and I have used them since at least 1999.  I usually access them on
Thursday, which is when the weekly edition comes out. There is also a daily
edition.

If LWN said to me that they can no longer afford to offer the service
unless I part with some money each year, then I think the service is so
useful, that I would be prepared to pay something like USD20-40 a year for
that service.

It might perhaps be for an advanced service where the LWN info is sent to
me as a mail message every week, or something like that.

So, while I know absolutely nothing about what is going on at LWN, if you
agree that their service is useful to you, I would ask that you reply and
tell me whether or not you agree here.


Regards
