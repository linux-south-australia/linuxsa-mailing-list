Hi All,

just wanted to add my 5c worth. I know most of these issues have been
tossed around over the list - unfortunately I've been away for the last
couple of weeks, and haven't had good access to email! I thought you 
might be interested in the views of somebody who has gone through this
whole "yes/no incorporation?" dilemma.

A few years ago I was part of the OS/2 Users Group. We (I was one
of the people who helped instigate this) became an incorporated body.
We did this for a couple of reasonuts. One of the primary motivations
was
to allow us to have more credibility as a User Group with businesses.
The OS/2 User Group appeared as a group of people. OS/2 User Group
Incorporated projected an organised body other institutions could deal
with (read that as sue if you like :-0).

If memory serves me correctly, we also did it for other legal reasons
such as being able to have insurance. Our place of meeting did not 
provide any form of public liability for the club's purposes for 
instance. 

I'd have to look at my papers when I return home, but I do think that 
the officers of the board did have some due liability. 

Incorporation required us to write a constitution which had to be 
provided to all members to read (those that joined). Writing this and
then getting the club to agree took a while ..... let me tell you!
We did have a membership fee to help cover costs. We kept
records, bank account and had formal minutes/meetings. Our constitution
listed members, roles and responsibilities etc. We also had to have
3 signatures to allow us to withdraw money etc. 

&gt;From a legal perspective, I think we wrote in our constitution that
members were not allowed to provide advice to non members about OS/2
behalf of the club (ie, any advice they provided was their own
liability).

There was a lot of work involved in some aspects!

We initially started as a special interest group of the SA PC Users 
Group, but later became incorporated for financial resaons.

Let me say, the club will change if you do incorporate. Better or 
worse? That depends on your perspective. I think it worked well for us.
But our club was only approximately 30 strong. The Linux community is
stronger! Seems like some interesting times ahead.....

Hope this makes some sense!

&gt; We should incorporate well before Installfest, have some transparent, clear
&gt; and active leadership, and continue on our merry way.
&gt; 
&gt; Comments? (particularly from those on the "organisers" list -- who is on
&gt; there now?)...

&gt; 
&gt; PS: Personally, I think that Geoffery and co have done (and are doing) a
&gt; great job, but I think it's time this group became an independant entity, so
&gt; that certain things (mailing lists, InstallFests, lobbying) can happen more
&gt; efficiently.
