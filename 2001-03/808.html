&gt; Tell me about it!  I will still do my best to promote change - I will not
give up on believing that change is possible.

I'll second that.
From where I sit (in a gov. dept. that is almost entirely MS-based apart 
from some Solaris boxen running large data systems), its not going to happen
overnight, and change must happen at the POLICY-MAKING level.
The majority of gov. decision-makers in IT, as you would no doubt know
already, have
NO IDEA, they just do what the policy says, and the ppl who write the policy
also
have NO IDEA, they just do what Microsoft says.  Its us poor sods at the
bottom of the food chain who have some idea but can't (officially) change
anything because policy says we can't.*

*refer to "What came first?  The Chicken or the Egg"..............!!

Footnote:
A lot of techs who I know in govt. depts. recognize the value of non-MS
solutions, but there aren't many who: 
a) are willing to try the alternatives to MS because of the mountains of red
tape holding them back, ie: the too hard basket
b) want to change, even if its a better solution, 
c) know any better, they're the typical MCSE-clone & know nothing but
Microsoft

Having said that, I know of one instance where FreeBSD is used to provide 
WAN connectivity to a large number of sites, 
Personally I run 4 Linux boxen that provide, among other things, file +
print, groupware apps, 
web services, RAS services (unofficially of course ;-)
(The above cases are functioning in government networks)


&gt;Am I in the wrong discussion group for this?  Are LinuxSA'ers interested in
Linux advocacy or is there a more appropriate &gt;forum for this?

Change has to start somewhere, why not here & every other mailing list on
the planet! ;-)

PS: the above views are my own and not those of my employers, more's the
pity!
