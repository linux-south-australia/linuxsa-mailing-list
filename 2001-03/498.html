Sure I understand this argument and I have no problems with its validity, what
I do have problems with, however, is that the TOTAL charges throughout the
industry are way to high.  There is absolutely no need for charges of this
magnetite period.

I am not and have not been complaining how costs are recovered and how profits
are made (on the current model).  My gripe is that greed is the driving force
for our main carriers, nothing more and nothing less.  This has a major impact
on the country, its economic well being, its ability to drive new ventures,
explore new business models and conduct business in a framework that is
competitive compared to overseas rivals.

Even now, the cost of DSL could be a lot cheaper, did you know that Telsta
wanted to offer DSL at lower rates to its direct users than wholesale to
downstream ISP's?  This had more to do with killing competition that
justifying a cost structure.  It took intervention by the ACCC to put a stop
to it and who loses.... we do, we did, we still are, and there is absolutely
no need for it.

And if this is not enough, Telstra even went as far as trying to enforce
downstream ISP's to pay for fibre for high speed connections (BIG $$$) when
they were using copper to provide 2meg speed.

To summarize, yes based on current math we have no option but to pay the
ferry-man our copper coin otherwise we don't cross to E-Valhalla.  Does it
have to be this way, no,  should we demand more because of the overall
benefits to business, community and Australian well being?

yes yes and yes.

&gt; You can get unlimited traffic from anyone.  Maybe it'll be as much as you
&gt; can download through an oversubscribed pipe, but hey, if they let you keep
&gt; sucking as long as you want does it really matter if you've only drunk a
&gt; few hundred kb by the end of the day?  Oh, it does?  Okay, try this: Find
&gt; out how much it costs to put in a fat international link.  Work out how
&gt; many subscribers you can afford to let at it before it, too, is oversub-
&gt; scribed, and then divide your cost by your subscriber base.  The number
&gt; you come up with will be orders of magnitude bigger than any $25 per month
&gt; plan that you've ever seen.  I happen to think Big Pond Direct's $990 per
&gt; month for a 64K pipe is a good deal (some ISP's think that's far too
&gt; cheap) and as I'm sure you we're all willing to pay a fair cost can we
&gt; stop the bleating and go sign up now?  If one wants unlimited downloads
&gt; one only has to pay one's way.  Easy as that.
