&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A lot of the BIOS manufacturers don't actually distribute the BIOS
&gt;&gt; updates from their site. They generally have a message saying "Go to the
&gt;&gt; motherboard manufacturer's website and download it there". If it's not a
&gt;&gt; reputable (recognised brand) they often don't have websites which makes
&gt;&gt; downloading BIOS updates a tad hard.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if I would trust something that wipes the BIOS from my
&gt;motherboard and then writes a new one, what happens if you have a power cut
&gt;half way through?? The board is a throwaway... You would want to make sure
&gt;you use a UPS!

While it might be dangerous, I have located the site. It is a TekRam board,
and there is a new BIOS that is two years older than the original ...

So, I might give it a try soon.

Biggest problem I had updating firmware was with an Alpha machine. It was a
DEC 3000/500. Damn thing had firmware on the system and IO board, and I was
silly enough to upgrade them separately. Got distracted after doing the
system board, and power cycled the machine. It would not boot after that.

Had to send it back to Sydney to have both sets of firmware updated to the
same rev :-(
