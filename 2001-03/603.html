Hi...

&gt; Is it really that much trouble to support LINUX? 

[dons fireproof suit]

Yes.  It's a bit harder to support linux (and Macs, even) than the
Windows family.  Why?  Linux doesn't have a standard way of
configuring PPP.

Think about it:
You're sitting in a tech support centre, and you get a call from some
guy who's running some obscure, out of date Linux distribution and
can't get it to connect to your service.  The customer can't quite
articulate the problem that they're having, and the distribution that
this guy's running doesn't have anything in any of the standard
places.  Your job is to talk him through getting this thing working.
And when you tell him "you've got to be kidding...  get a newer distro"
he says "but your company claims that you support Linux, and this is
Linux."

I'm sure that many of the people on this list could configure PPP on
just about any Linux distribution in existance if they're sitting in
front of the machine, but when you're trying to tell a customer who
doesn't know how to use a text editor how to configure their system,
it's pretty tough.

And I'm sure that the people who would be able to configure these
systems will want a lot more than most tech support centres are
willing to pay.

But with all that said, I would like to see a little more Linux
support out there.  Maybe ISPs could support specific distros or
something.

Phil.
