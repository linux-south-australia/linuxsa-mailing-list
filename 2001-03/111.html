If you are looking for a linux friendly UPS I would suggest the APC range of
products. The APC products are a known brand with great reliability and they
offer linux software to perform an unattended shutdown and monitoring.

Try the APC site at <A HREF="http://www.apcc.com">http://www.apcc.com</A> follow the links to the Australian
region and find your local stockists.

Regards

Robert

&gt; Hi Alan,
&gt;
&gt; try checking the online catalog from adelong computers.
&gt;
&gt; they had become linux friendly a while back and might be of some help to
&gt; you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've been looking at UPSs and thinking about it for a long time.
&gt; &gt;&gt; (Since 1985 actually.)
&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you (or anyone else) recommend one or more brands in terms
&gt; &gt;&gt; of their usefulness for linux?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe that Sola makes UPSs that have little automatic shutdown
&gt; &gt; daemons when the UPS drops bellow `x' power remaining. Have a look at
&gt; &gt; their website (<A HREF="http://www.solaaust.com.au">http://www.solaaust.com.au</A>). They make a cool
&gt; &gt; powerboard/UPS thing that sits on the wall (or something). I'm not sure
&gt; &gt; if its got an RS-232 connection on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had a little Sola UPS (it kept 4 servers going for 16 minutes, one
&gt; &gt; time) with the cable and it seemed to work quite well. The software did
&gt; &gt; the Unattended shutdown thing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The few I've seen in the stores until now have looked rather
&gt; &gt;&gt; clumsy, and I had no idea how I would make them work with linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not many computer stores seem to stock them. I think that half the
&gt; &gt; people in computer shops probably wouldn't know what one was :-) I think
&gt; &gt; the best way to go is do your own research about quality, linux support
&gt; &gt; etc. Then go and find prices. I think you'll struggle to walk into a
&gt; &gt; shop and find one on the shelf.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I've followed various discussions in linuSA about UPSs over the
&gt; &gt;&gt; years. But I don't remember any specific recommendations of
&gt; &gt;&gt; a good, cheap UPS for home use for, say, two PCs.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; SuSE now has a list of about 90 supported USP types and 20 unsupported.
&gt; &gt;&gt; But I often find that in Adelaide, the brands are not on
&gt; &gt;&gt; the European/US brand lists.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Note that while SuSE may support one out of the box, it may be that the
&gt; &gt; UPS company has got their own program that does the Unattended shutdown
&gt; &gt; bit. Have a look on the manufacturer's website before you rule on Linux
&gt; &gt; Supported or not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; On the SuSE UPS support list, they mention that the Meta ECO 750 has
&gt; &gt;&gt; kernel support! But none of the other 90 UPS types have this.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hmmm. A bit looking around reveals "man powerd", which describes
&gt; &gt;&gt; a nifty utility to get the OS down to single-user in the event of
&gt; &gt;&gt; a pwoer failure.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why not just shut it down completely? I'd prefer my PC to be off in the
&gt; &gt; event of a power failure over single user mode. Unless you have reason
&gt; &gt; to have it in single user mode (over completely shutdown)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; There's even a UPS-HOWTO! With 3696 lines!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Wheeee!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Kind Regards,
