&gt; But here is some of their splerb.....

this caused much chuckling... "splerb"... love it :)

also, in another email:
&gt; Or even half and half, we are still testing "HP Openmail" on our
&gt; Linux 6.2
&gt; box. It's from HP, it's open source, it let our M$ Office Outlook 2000

Open Source? OpenMail is open source? I didn't think it was...
<A HREF="http://www.openmail.com/cyc/om/00/showfile.cgi?100-0999">http://www.openmail.com/cyc/om/00/showfile.cgi?100-0999</A> indicates it
isn't... AFAIK, it's neither free beer nor free speech. Also, I read
recently that OpenMail was being discontinued... the link above says that
the SCO and NT versions have been discontinued... hmmm

in fact, check <A HREF="http://www.openmail.com/cyc/om/00/showfile.cgi?100-1625">http://www.openmail.com/cyc/om/00/showfile.cgi?100-1625</A> ("Why
has HP made the decision not to enhance OpenMail any further?") and
<A HREF="http://www.openmail.com/cyc/om/00/100-1624.pdf">http://www.openmail.com/cyc/om/00/100-1624.pdf</A> ...

and re the linux version, in the "Why has HP made the decision not to
enhance OpenMail any further?" link above:

----
What is happening to the free evaluation version of Linux?
The evaluation version was created to generate awareness for OpenMail, and
to encourage use of the product on the Linux platform.  Because we are not
promoting OpenMail to new customers, the evaluation version will be removed
from the OpenMail web site on 31st October 2001. The evaluation version
issued from March 2001 will be restricted to 50 users for testing as normal,
but will expire on March 31st 2006. The evaluation version of OpenMail is
intended to will allow customers to try out OpenMail - in a test
environment - prior to purchasing subscription and moving to OpenMail 7.0.

definitely not free or open. Mail though :)
