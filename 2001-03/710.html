&gt; I have just had it with the whole home retail Internet industry in
&gt; Australia.

Why?  The charges for ASDL seem very reasonable to me, particularly
if they include 1GB per month.  You should do what I have done: Cost
a wholesale link and work out what retail rates should be.

Let me put some actual figures to the discussion, because I think a
heck of a lot of people don't know how much it costs to run an ISP.
Pardon me for giving costs for 56k modems, but I have no idea of the
costs to provision ADSL.  I think the exercise is still useful, even if
it's slightly off topic.


   COSTS FOR 150 V.90 PORTS

   INSTALLATION COST
   2Mbps link               $9,000
   Router                    4,000
   5 x OnRamp 30            15,000
   Modem server - 150 ports 45,000
                           -------
                           $73,000

   Amortised installation cost, over 36 months
   per port per month:         $14
                           -------

   RUNNING COST
   2Mbps link               $1,000
   OnRamp                    3,750
   Wages                     8,000
   Rent (pro-rated)            500
   Electricity, Insurance      100
                           -------
                           $13,350

   Running cost per port per
   month:                      $89
                           -------

   Total cost per port per
   month:                     $103
                           -------
  

Wholesale data cost per megabyte varies, but 12c is close to the mark.
With port costs around $100 per month, including zero bytes of pre-paid
data, how many megabytes of data do you expect per month for $25?


&gt; It is not a FINITE resource - it is a resource that is only limited
&gt; by bandwidth and infrastructure costs.  And at the moment - bandwidth
&gt; and infrastructure costs are too high to justify ADSL at home.

See this is where you are right: ADSL is an infinite resource, which is
why it's called "always on," and why you don't get charged on a time basis.
On the other hand, ADSL contains and generates zero content.  The content
comes via fibre, satellite or copper links, and costs truckloads of money
for sensible bandwidth.  That's what you are really being charged for; the
ADSL itself seems to me to be more-or-less free.


&gt; Get real

Splendid advice.
