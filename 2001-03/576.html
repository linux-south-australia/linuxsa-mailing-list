&gt;We took on a client with a aging Micro$oft based peer-to-peer LAN with about
&gt;15 Windows 9x & 2k workstations all sharing stuff off each other and of the
&gt;so called Windows NT (worksation) server.
&gt;
&gt;The system was badly in need of an upgrade and we gave them a Linux server
&gt;option or a NT server option, surprise they went for the Linux option.
&gt;
&gt;We told the customer to support the Win 2k worksations we would have to put
&gt;in some very new cutting edge software (Samba-TNG) and that we had tested in
&gt;our own office and we used it everyday and all seemed to run ok. This was
&gt;part of our proposal and they agreed.
&gt;
&gt;Ok ever had one of those sites where EVERYTHING goes wrong about 3-6 months
&gt;after the initial install AAARRGGGHHH!!!!

What sort of problems?

&gt;After quite a number of other things (i.e not Samba-TNG) related to
&gt;service-level-agreements etc. had hit the fan they got another firm in to
&gt;audit the system.
&gt;
&gt;Next they are on the phone to us, and having not much else to bitch about
&gt;(we had done a good job) they started in on:
&gt;
&gt;"...our audit shows that Samba-TNG is an ALPHA piece of software, how could
&gt;you dare run that on our mission critical production site it's not even
&gt;BETA! ... rant, rave, rant etc etc."

Well, the best solution at the moment is Samba 2.2.0alpha 2 (which should
ship soon), which is also Alpha software ...

&gt;Anyways that was the background, here's the question for the folks on the
&gt;list who are out there selling and installing Linux solutions.
&gt;
&gt;How much do you tell your clients?
&gt;Lots of stuff in Linux is on the "bleeding edge" and in a state of flux.
&gt;There is stuff I wouldn't put on a clients site in a screaming fit, but
&gt;other things must be installed and I not sure how much of say a Linux 6.2
&gt;basic server install is classed as "stable"?

RedHat 6.2 is reasonably stable. I would stay away from RH 7.0 and wait for
7.1 which is pretty close, I understand.

I would be careful about Samba TNG or Samba 2.2.0 either in a production
setup, but would be prepared to use Samba 2.2.0 in some circumstances ...

It all sounds like relationship management issues to me ... and does the
'audit' firm also install systems and networks? That is, are they really
independent, or are they perhaps after business?

&gt;Regards,
&gt;
