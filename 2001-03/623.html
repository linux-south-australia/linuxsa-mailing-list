Hi...

&gt; I'm truly surprised that any ISP bundles support with subscription fees.
&gt; It doesn't matter what platforms you offer support for, because the
&gt; fact is that computers are very complicated, probably infinitely so,
&gt; and I don't understand how any business can afford to say, "ask us and
&gt; we'll give you the answers."

I have often wondered this myself.  I don't have a complete answer,
but here's some partial reasoning as to how I think it works:

[... description of tricky problem snipped ...]

It is pretty standard to receive some level of support with a product
or service.  Certainly there needs to be somewhere that the customer
can call when they can't connect to their ISP, if only so that they
can say "I can't connect.  Are your servers broken?" and the ISP can
say "No.  Your machine is broken."

But fortunately, most user problems are simple things like they're
entering "Joe Bloggs" for their user name, they haven't paid their
bill, or Telstra's providing some line noise for them at no extra
charge.  And the *vast* majority of users run Windows 95 or 98, (ME is
increasing now).  So once the user's called up complaining that they
can't connect, you might as well try to fix their problem because
there's a 95% chance that it's simple, and they'll be happy if you fix
their problem for them.

Of course the last bit would have to be market share.  If two ISPs
were equally priced, but one offered support, which one would you go
to (assuming you were Joe Average)?  And then, once you've signed up a
user, you may find that you don't make a lot of money out of them if
they can't connect.  ;-)

So, those are my thoughts based on some experience in ISP tech
support.  I don't claim that they are a perfect answer to your
question, but I offer them anyway.

Phil.
