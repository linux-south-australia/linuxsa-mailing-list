As I understood it (and I could well be wrong here) if you want to get
outside of that network you need to also sign up with an ISP connected
to TransACT and that the combined price would be over the $100/month
mark (plus bandwidth charges of course).

Video on demand will be nice, but I haven't seen the pricing on this
yet (eg will it be more than a video rental). It will also be
interesting to see how they handle the problem of 'video napster'
since it will be a high speed network with no bandwidth charging.

&gt; As for services, the AARNet mirror will appear on-net for
&gt; TransACT users and I know they've been talking with other
&gt; large content providers as well.

Thats good to hear. If there is a full Debian mirror internally I'll
be a happy little vegemite.

&gt; As TransACT rolls out you'll see off-net prices fall as
&gt; TransACT will be able to afford its own off-shore bandwidth
&gt; and its sheer size will force free peering with the likes

Thanks for the explanation.

Chris.
