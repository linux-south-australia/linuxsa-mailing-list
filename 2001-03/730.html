You are on a different planet to reality.

If your reality was available **someone would be doing it**

You go ahead and blame Telstra. The rest of us will get on with doing 
the very best that we can in the real world.

&gt;We have a dilemma don't we Ian, listen to the people who make money

&gt;the people who make money from you telling you live with it and stop 
&gt;complaining. If on the other hand your sick of
&gt;the telstra crap (charging etc) complain and don't stop EVER.  If we 
&gt;can have an impact on banks (ACCC today anyone)? We may just have a 
&gt;chance to have s mall impact.  Most of the ISP's have given up, but 
&gt;they stood to lose more because of their
&gt;relationship with telstra.  As for me, ;-)  I keep on plugging... Oh 
&gt;and don't let anyone fob you off with it can't be changed, the world 
&gt;is what we make of it, not what other people tell us we should 
&gt;expect.
&gt;
&gt;Surely you followed the friendly flame war re meg/time providers v 
&gt;benefit to country, mankind and the galaxy :-)
&gt;
&gt;Good grip  welcome to reality, lets fix it :-)
&gt;
&gt;And before we have the local ISP boys bleat again about how its soo 
&gt;good for us and makes us all well behaved little childern,  I AM 
&gt;BLAMING TELSTRA FOR OUR PROBLEMS AND YOURS........!!!!!!

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; 250Mbyte limit?  Are these people SERIOUS?!
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Get stuffed!  I don't give a damn what people say about business 
&gt;models and so on.  There is no way I am paying for something that is 
&gt;fast - yes - but only clocks up 18c / 10 seconds or something when I 
&gt;want to listen to online radio or whatever.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; This is just complete bullshit.  No wonder Australia is such a 
&gt;backward country.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Primus now has a 1000Mbyte limit.  I am so glad I did not sign up 
&gt;- as then they would have changed the conditions on me and I would 
&gt;have been stuck with a crappy contract for 12 months.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I have just had it with the whole home retail Internet industry 
&gt;in Australia.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; The whole idea of having ADSL at home is to listen to radio and 
&gt;download films, etc.  Otherwise why should I bother upgrading from a 
&gt;dialup connection?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; ADSL as it just stands is just completely pointless unless you 
&gt;are a milionaire who can afford to clock up the equivalent of a 
&gt;phone call to Ghana peak time!
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; It is not a FINITE resource - it is a resource that is only 
&gt;limited by bandwidth and infrastructure costs.  And at the moment - 
&gt;bandwidth and infrastructure costs are too high to justify ADSL at 
&gt;home.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Get real - I guess I will stick with my trust modem until ADSL is 
&gt;truly obsolete and something better comes along - perhaps when I am 
&gt;retired and over the whole thing anyway.

&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt;I'd agree whole-heartedly with this.  It took me over one working
&gt;  &gt; &gt;week to get a permanent dialup customer's DNS detail correct that
&gt;  &gt; &gt;they were hosting.  They apparently only update their DNS servers
&gt;  &gt; &gt;once per 24 hours, plus coupled with their inability to read email
&gt;  &gt; &gt;and faxes correctly, resulted in one severely PO'd customer and an
&gt;  &gt; &gt;exasperating situation only equaled by Big Pond technical support.
&gt;  &gt; &gt;I've never sent a business customer their way since.
