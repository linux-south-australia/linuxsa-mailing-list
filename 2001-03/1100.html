Richard,

&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; Hi -- I whipped this up as a proposal that I think we should
&gt; adopt (although
&gt; I don't know how an amorphous blob of people goes about adopting anything,
&gt; but anyway). It's all IMHO, but I'd quite like it to be LinuxSA's HO. It
&gt; still needs work, and I'd suggest that it should be turned into a FAQ,
&gt; really... Whatever -- if I get something started, maybe someone else will
&gt; volunteer to take it over and do it properly when they're not
&gt; tired and etc
&gt; like I am now.
&lt;SNIP&gt;

Hear hear, well done indeed!!!

&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; When posting, bear in mind that the list is a public forum, with many
people
&gt; who don't have much in common with yourself. To help facilitate effective
&gt; communication (ooh, now I feel like a PHB), LinuxSA has in place a very
&gt; sophisticated moderation system. It's called the LinuxSA Voluntary
&gt; Self-Moderation System (or LSAVSMS for short). It works like this: Before
&gt; posting something, re-read it and moderate as follows:
&lt;SNIP&gt;

&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; Feel free to add to or disagree with anything here.
&lt;SNIP&gt;

Can we decide how we would ban, delete, unsubscribe, nuke etc. repeat
blatant violators of the "LSAVSMS" ????

i.e. Three strikes/warnings and your out? Or are you just turfed by popular
vote? Should we vote/appoint/beg/ask someone of good/bad standing on the
list to be the Moderator and set-up a benevolent dictatorship????

Patrick Browne
