Michael,

Thanks for that. Luckily I happen to have a Jaycar catalogue.
They have a 800VA unit for $400 - well, in 1999 anyway.

They claim it will keep a computer minus monitor going for 45 minutes.

That should indeed cover most power losses.
Here's a list of the recent losses in my suburb:

2001-Mar-01	140 minutes.
		Cause: truck hit stobie pole.

2001-Jan-10	Probably about 60 minutes.
		It was down for 3 days because I was
		overseas at the time, and I had get a
		non-computing friend to run fsck
		while I was on the phone for 1 hour from Europe.

2000-Nov-02	30 minutes. 
		Cause: Canadian electricity company turned off
		Adelaide power to sell it at a higher price
		in Victoria because of the strike there.

2000-Jun-10	First failure: 45 minutes. No file system damage.
		Second failure: 5 seconds. FS was damaged.
		System fixed 9 hours later, because I was asleep
		at the time.

1999-12-02	First failure: 45 minutes.
		Second failure: 55 minutes.
		Cause: Trees hit a power line near Port Augusta and
		led to wide-spread black-outs.
		System fixed up 30 hours later.
		I was in the Flinders Ranges at the time.

Well, that's how good the Prospect power has been in the
last 14 months or so.
A good advertisement for business thinking of moving here!
Bring your own kero generator!!

So it looks like from these numbers, I really need 60 hours
of backup in order to survive more than 50% of electricity
failures without dropping to single-user.

On the other hand, if I can save the pain of damaged file systems,
keeping the system going would be just icing on the cake.
		
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
