&gt; Are you running an Domain Controller anywhere (Windows 2000, Windows

Yes in fact we are running a Domain Controller (NT Server 4.0) in
another workgroup on the same subnet.

Some users have accounts on this NT box but most don't (and
don't get mappings to it).  The problem seems to effect both people
that do and don't have accounts on the NT Domain Controller.

&gt; The smb.conf file says not to make modifications by hand. Have you
&gt; ever had any problems doing this?

That notice is due to the e-smith software.  The smb.conf file is
actually generated by e-smith (see www.e-smith.org) from template
files.

&gt; &gt; Note that the netlogon is generated by a script. This is just one
&gt; &gt; example.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a reason for this? What happens if you change the login
&gt; script for the problem user (I'm assuming it's only happening to one
&gt; user) to be a static one?

The reason being that some users need mappings to certain areas
and others need mappings to other areas - the generated login
script makes this happen.

We can't really change one user's login script to a static one
without changing the rest of them.

It's happening to a number of users (about 12 that we've noticed)
but seems to come and go.

&gt; &gt; Yup, tried that. Sooner or later the extra drive will reappear. It's
&gt; &gt; not clear what's triggering it.
&gt;
&gt; Does it suddenly reappear whilst you are logged in or at login?

The drives don't appear as a result of the login.  Immediately after
logging in none of the rogue drive mappings are present.

&gt; How regularly does it happen after you disconnect each drive?

This appears to be different for each user.  One I've noticed has had
all the drives (E-Z) mapping in a period of about an hour.  Others
(myself included) have mapping appear on very occasionally.

&gt; You mentioned you were running SP6 on NT4. Have you tried the final
&gt; patch for NT (SP6A)? Apparently, SP6 has some problems. Perhaps this
&gt; would help.

That's a good idea, will try and let then let you know.

&gt; &gt; We're based in Melbourne, Fitzroy to be specific (not exactly
&gt; &gt; Southern Australia i realize).
&gt;
&gt; Yeah, It'd probably take a while to drive there after work tonight.
&gt; :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the quick reponse,
&gt;
&gt; No problems
&gt;
&gt; Matt

Cheers,
Daniel van Raay
