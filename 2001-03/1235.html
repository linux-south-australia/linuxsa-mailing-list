Aren't we all.

&gt; What would make me really happy would be to have 5 or
&gt; so people around at someones house (or other suitable
&gt; venue) for a config fest.

Or around someone's office, I might just be able to talk my boss into letting us
use mine for such a noble cause.  More than enough room for 5 computers, even 10
if we push it a bit.

&gt; There are so many things that I have been meaning to
&gt; work out but I just don't have the experience or
&gt; knowledge to do this.

I can relate to that

&gt; Just little things such as how to have attack alerts
&gt; from portsentry emailed to root, optimise my hard
&gt; drive, set up SSH access / webmin, etc, etc, etc.

not to mention things like tripwire, basic shell scripts for automation, how
about crontab and how the heck does that work.

&gt; And I am sure there are others on this list who have
&gt; a few things they never got around to working out
&gt; although they have been meaning to - so I suggest a
&gt; weekend meeting.  The LinuxSA meetings are great
&gt; although I think an afternoon geek-fest would be great.

I'm interested, and I could probably find another couple of guys who are
interested enough to show up.

&gt; Any takers?

I'm game. Anyone else?

Tim
