Hello all

Well instead of asking another silly question as per my usual, I would like
to air a gripe.

Last night I dialled up SENET (my local ISP) for some help in setting up my
computer's
modem with Red Hat LINUX (is it just me or does Red Hat 7.0 not include the
HOWTO's,
although I installed everything the HOWTOS were missing!!!).

I thought that since LINUX is responsible for their all of their server
needs that it would
be at least supported as a client O/S. 

Although polite, the tech support agent at the other end of the line
informed me that
LINUX was a teach yourself O/S and that I should consult the web (a little
difficult to do
when your modem doesn't work!!). 

I have since printed out the HOWTO and got the modem working (luckily my
work computer
has internet access ;) ). It was not that difficult. Certainly not beyond
the capabilities of 
a tech support officer. 

Is it really that much trouble to support LINUX?
