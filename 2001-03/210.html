I have 8, or rather my fathers company has 8 which I have been responsible 
for purchasing...  we have had no problems with them at all, we have several 
305's which have been on non stop for about 2 years and we have not had a 
single problem with them they have done their intended job fine. I don't 
have any problem with them, in addition my cousin owns a computer business 
and he refuses to sell APC ups now because in the past customers have had a 
lot of trouble with them (I don't know the specifics, this is just what he 
has said).

I don't know, maybe you got a few lemons!!
or maybe I got a few rare ones, but I didn't get all of mine at the same 
time.

MHO anyway... people are entitled to different opinions.

Regards,

Michael


&gt;I would say that SOLA has been the most unreliable UPS brand I have ever
&gt;seen.
&gt;
&gt;The company I work for bought 5 as backup power for server PC which
&gt;controlled a machine, every one of them has need to warranty work.
