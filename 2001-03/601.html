Harvey!

&gt; Although polite, the tech support agent at the other end of the line
&gt; informed me that LINUX was a teach yourself O/S and that I should 
&gt; consult the web (a little difficult to do when your modem doesn't 
&gt; work!!).

That's true. Nonetheless if you have a full version of RedHat 7.0 the
HOWTO's are on the disk.

&gt; has internet access ;) ). It was not that difficult. Certainly not beyond
&gt; the capabilities of
&gt; a tech support officer.

What time of day did you call? When I first started to use the Internet
I was also just learning Linux. I found their support excellent,
although I needed to be patched through to one of their technical
people. It's true their first-line support wasn't able to help me too
much but the support is there.

&gt; Is it really that much trouble to support LINUX?

Yes. The real question here, though, is it a profitable business
decision to support Linux.

The Question Is:
 "Can AUUG augment LinuxSA?"
 (maybe it would be easier to ask
 Cornelia "who is the weakest link?")
