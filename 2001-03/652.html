 &gt; SGI Indy
 &gt; IRIX 6.2 (with what I suspect is the standard SGI software, no garantees)
 &gt; MIPS R4400SC 100MHz CPU, with 1MB L2 cache (I think) and the biggest
 &gt; heatsink you ever did see.

R10000 heatsink is much bigger :-)

 &gt; 32Mb RAM

Heh.  Hope it isn't running anything better than IRIX 5.3.  More recent
OS's really want more than that (indeed, 5.3 really wants more than that
too, but it'll cope with 32 Mbytes).

 &gt; ~550Mb SCSI Hard Disk

Ah.  That seals it:  It *isn't* running anything better than IRIX 5.3 :-)

 &gt; Extra loud fan :)
 &gt; Flat 17" Monitor (Sony Trinitron Tube) missing stand and bottom of case
 &gt; (note that this has a non-standard connector, so you can't just plug it into
 &gt; your PC, and I've tried to find adaptors, and they seem to be around $100,
 &gt; with no garantee of working)

It's a perfectly standard 13W3 connector.  Works fine on Sun, DEC, HP and
other workstations, sync rates notwithstanding (you may need to tweak an
internal pot to get the monitor to work with non-SGI equipment).

 &gt; Some sort of Graphics capability, but I can't really tell what the card
 &gt; itself is. I'm guessing it's one of the lower spec ones -- looks to me like
 &gt; it could be 24 bit, but couldn't be sure.

Type "/usr/gfx/gfxinfo" to find out.  hinv might also be useful.

 &gt; I've been told it has ISDN, but personally, I don't know what to look for :)

A connector on the back panel with a telephone symbol above it (RJ-45 
socket).

 &gt; It's a funky SGI speckled greeny-blue colour, and the peripherals are
 &gt; speckled grey, but the keyboard is beige for some reason.

Sounds like the keyboard is a refugee from an IRIS or a Challenge.  They
were beige;  the "real" Indy keyboards were speckled-grey.

 &gt; Original Box for case, no box for monitor.
 &gt; Original Camtech Asset ID sticker :)

Ok, I've probably pulled it apart and put it back together again at least
50 times.

 &gt; No garantees that anything I said here is correct or working 100% -- I've
 &gt; had it running, mucked about with it for a few hours, and haven't noticed
 &gt; any problems... It's kinda slow, but kinda cool, and I'm sure someone will
 &gt; have an interesting use for it (I imagine it would be faster under Linux,
 &gt; but I could be wrong).

For what it's worth, you can run Linux on it.  <A HREF="http://www.linux.sgi.com">http://www.linux.sgi.com</A> has
the lowdown.  They've ported XFree86 to it, by the way, so it's a reasonably
capable X-based workstation under IRIX or Linux.
