&gt; Subject: ADSL (residential) - why waste one's time or money?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I received their terms and conditions document today.
&gt;
&gt; 250Mbyte limit?  Are these people SERIOUS?!
&gt;
&gt; Get stuffed!  I don't give a damn what people say about business
&gt; models and so on.  There is no way I am paying for something that
&gt; is fast - yes - but only clocks up 18c / 10 seconds or something
&gt; when I want to listen to online radio or whatever.
&gt;
&gt; This is just complete bullshit.  No wonder Australia is such a
&gt; backward country.
&gt;
&gt; Primus now has a 1000Mbyte limit.  I am so glad I did not sign up
&gt; - as then they would have changed the conditions on me and I
&gt; would have been stuck with a crappy contract for 12 months.
&gt;
&gt; I have just had it with the whole home retail Internet industry
&gt; in Australia.
&gt;
&gt; The whole idea of having ADSL at home is to listen to radio and
&gt; download films, etc.  Otherwise why should I bother upgrading
&gt; from a dialup connection?
&gt;
&gt; ADSL as it just stands is just completely pointless unless you
&gt; are a milionaire who can afford to clock up the equivalent of a
&gt; phone call to Ghana peak time!
&gt;
&gt; It is not a FINITE resource - it is a resource that is only
&gt; limited by bandwidth and infrastructure costs.  And at the moment
&gt; - bandwidth and infrastructure costs are too high to justify ADSL at home.
&gt;
&gt; Get real - I guess I will stick with my trust modem until ADSL is
&gt; truly obsolete and something better comes along - perhaps when I
&gt; am retired and over the whole thing anyway.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'd agree whole-heartedly with this.  It took me over one working
&gt; &gt;week to get a permanent dialup customer's DNS detail correct that
&gt; &gt;they were hosting.  They apparently only update their DNS servers
&gt; &gt;once per 24 hours, plus coupled with their inability to read email
&gt; &gt;and faxes correctly, resulted in one severely PO'd customer and an
&gt; &gt;exasperating situation only equaled by Big Pond technical support.
&gt; &gt;I've never sent a business customer their way since.
