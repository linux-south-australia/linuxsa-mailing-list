&gt; do the separate network segments need to be different subnets (ie
&gt; 192.168.1.x and 192.168.0.x) or can they be the same.

Generally, yes. There are a few occasions when two (or more) interfaces can
share IP addresses. One such occasion is a ppp dial-in server. The local IP
can be the same IP as the ethernet interface. In the case of network cards
however, they do need to be on different subnets.

One thing I don't think anyone has picked up on yet, which I am assuming
your problem is, is that the two Windows machines cannot 'see' each other in
Network Neighbourhood?? If it is, then you need to do a couple of things to
get it to work.

First, is put each ethernet card onto a different subnet. If you are using
private address space (which you seem to be), just make the first adaptor
192.168.1.1 and the second adaptor 192.168.2.1. You also need to edit the
samba configuration to turn on the WINS server. I'll leave it up to the
reader to read the samba documentation to work that one out (hint: 'man
smb'). Restart samba so it starts the WINS component of the nmdb.

Once you have done that you need to set the Window's machines up correctly.
Go into the network settings on the first, and make it 192.168.1.2 and make
the gateway, WINS server and DNS server 192.168.1.1 (I am assuming that the
linux machine is also doing DNS!). On the second machine make the IP address
192.168.2.2, and make the gateway, WINS server and DNS server 192.168.2.1.

Reboot both the Windows machines and give them up to 15 minutes to
synchronise browse lists and you should be able to share network drives,
etc, between the two Windows machines.

PS. It would probably be much easier to just buy a $55 5 port 10baseT hub :)

Two $45 network cards &gt; One $55 hub! Doesn't seem that cheaper to me! It
actually sounds like its more expensive!
