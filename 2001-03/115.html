*sigh* Why do these things always have to happen when I'm at the other
end of the world?

I'm copying the AUUG executive committee on this blanket reply to up
to 11 messages (I may remove some that I am currently planning to
reply to).  This is the first that the other 6 members of the
committee know about the issue, so this message is obviously my own
opinion, not AUUG policy.

Before I go into specifics, my general take on this is: we already
have too many UNIX-related associations and societies.  There are a
number of reasons to keep down the number:

1.  It's a lot of work running an association.   AUUG has about 600
    members and a nine-head executive committee.  We meet every 3
    months and regularly have to beat our collective chests for not
    having done the work we had promised to do.

2.  It costs more money than you think running an association.  AUUGs
    budget is measured in six-figure terms, and managing it has, in
    the past, proven to be a particular problem.  Except for very
    small (&lt; 20) associations, I suspect that the per capita
    expenditure may be higher for small associations.  That's one of
    the reasons why we're trying to get more members.

3.  There are only so many people who are interested in membership of
    this kind of association, and even now we're seeing that people
    are making choices.  In SA we have LinuxSA (very active) and
    SAGE-AU-SA (spelling?) and AUUG, both trying to regain a foothold.
    We (AUUG) could, of course, just say "OK, the place is
    overpopulated already", and give up, but there are some things
    that we do that LinuxSA doesn't, and I'm still not convinced (see
    1 and 2 above) that they will do effectively, for example opposing
    the latest brain-dead legislation proposals.

    (The reason I'm not convinced is because of the work involved, and
    the difficulty of getting people to listen to you).

4.  An association's influence is strongly dependent on its size.  Two
    groups of 1000 members each have much less clout than one group
    with 2000 members.  The current discussion has centred around
    "big" AUUG and "little" LinuxSA, but at the last AUUG exec meeting
    we realised that we are too small to make much effect by
    ourselves, and we have decided to join the IT council of SA to
    make our opinions more public.  LinuxSA could join as well, but
    then our combined voices within the IT council would be weaker.

I feel that AUUG in its current form has outlived its usefulness.  We
still have people on the committee who would prefer to do things the
way our grandfathers did, who don't like doing business by Email, who
prefer to use Microsoft to UNIX.  For some time we've been wondering
how to catch up with the Real World, and one of the things we've been
talking about is a closer cooperation with the various Linux and BSD
user groups.  I think it would be interesting to explore the
possibility of an amalgamation of AUUG and the Linux groups.

I can appreciate that this doesn't sound nearly as sexy as
incorporating LinuxSA, but consider the points I mentioned about.
Apart from this, people have raised a number of good reasons why
LinuxSA and AUUG should exist side by side.  I'll look at them below.

&gt; of open vs closed mailing lists?  What benefits do members get?  ie why should I
&gt; pay $$$ when I can come to meetings, participate on the mailing list etc without
&gt; joining?  Do we _really_ want to go down this path?

Unless LinuxSA starts to actively compete with us, AUUG won't see it
as a competitor.

&gt;&gt; We should incorporate well before Installfest, have some transparent, clear
&gt;&gt; and active leadership, and continue on our merry way.
&gt;
&gt; Do we _need_ such formalisation (besides insurance) to hold an installfest?  I
&gt; don't think so.  Afterall Richard, you did a _great_ job last year!

Remember that the Installfest is a nationwide thing, and AUUG is
committed to helping it happen.  I don't think that LinuxSA needs
incorporation just for that reason.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But... :-) we need to realise that incorporation means covering our backsides
&gt;&gt; with insurance.  This will mean we need $$$.  This means we need to have the
&gt;&gt; concept of membership and membership fees.
&gt;
&gt; This isn't such a terrible thing.  Other lugs do it :)  If we can get
&gt; enough sponsors, then we can make membership free.
&gt;
&gt; IIRC, there was talk in the past about AUUG helping LinuxSA become an
&gt; incorporated body.  I am not sure where the rest of the AUUG executive
&gt; committee members stand on this issue, is it worth pursing this matter and
&gt; finding out what is involved?  What are peoples thoughts on this matter?

It's definitely worth pursuing.  We really need to get our act
together.

&gt; If LinuxSA becomes an incorporated body, then we can seek
&gt; sponsorship from local companies to cover costs (even membership -
&gt; which I think should be free).  Companies and or organisations who
&gt; are currently proving services to LinuxSA for free, may prefer the
&gt; recognition that they get as an "Official" sponsor.

That's definitely true, but it would be even better if they could get
nationwide recognition.  And AUUG is also looking for local
sponsorship.  Again the dilution effect becomes apparent.

&gt;&gt; AUUG can contribute much to us, and it tries to regularly.  The thing
&gt;&gt; is that we can contribute to AUUG, too.  AUUG needs local enthusiasm and
&gt;&gt; local members.  It needs members who will organise local meetings.  It
&gt;&gt; needs a Geoffrey or a Matthew (splitter! ;-) ).  Why are so few of us
&gt;&gt; members of AUUG?  Why don't we consider become affiliated with AUUG?
&gt;

&gt; Hmm... I am not a member of AUUG because I can't spread myself
&gt; thinly enough to get involved in another *nix users group.

Exactly the point I'm trying to make.

&gt; AUUG doesn't really offer me anything I want.

This is one of the problems we're trying to address.  Let's discuss
what you (and the others) want.

&gt; I don't have time to contribute to it.

You don't have time to contribute to more than one group.

&gt; Basically, IMHO, LinuxSA has the critical mass, and AUUG doesn't.

Within SA.

&gt; Also, I think that while we are LinuxSA, and we do focus on Linux,
&gt; in reality, we are more like the FreeSoftwareSA or OpenSourceSA, as
&gt; most of our discussion is on GPL'd software rather than on Linux
&gt; itself. I guess we're also interested in unices in general as
&gt; well. I don't see anything extra that AUUG offers.

The more global perspective, and the fact that we are already
incorporated.

&gt; Hmmm.... I do see things like the symposia and conferences etc, but
&gt; then, I think we (and Linux-Aus) do just as much -- CALU,
&gt; Linux.conf.au, InstallFest, etc... Really, there's nothing that _I_
&gt; see right now that AUUG does that LinuxSA and Linux-Aus don't or
&gt; couldn't do.

As long as we look at this from an "us and them" perspective, that's
correct.  And agreed, linux.conf.au was really good.  But there's a
limit to what a group in a single state can do, and I think we've
probably reached it.

&gt; As has been mentioned in the past, maybe we should think of becoming
&gt; the SA branch of AUUG... IMHO, this option offers us too little, and
&gt; really doesn't represent what we are about.

The challenge is to change this.

&gt; I don't know what AUUG are mainly focussed on, and maybe it is
&gt; primarily Linux and open source stuff, but I guess I see it as
&gt; something that is commercial-focussed...

No, that's definitely not the case.

&gt; many people on this list would cite their primary reason for using
&gt; Linux to be a philosophical, RMS like one, primarily about freedom,
&gt; and hence, Solaris etc don't cut the mustard...

I wonder how many people see it this way.  I'd guess that a lot of
people in LinuxSA use Solaris and that many of them even like it.  But
in any group you're going to find that the association's goals don't
exactly match your own.  And I can't recall much activity in AUUG
about commercial UNIX lately.

&gt; Hmmm... Personally, I'm still for incorporating separately, and
&gt; allowing us to retain our own focus. Presently,
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/linuxsa/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/linuxsa/</A> says our "guiding principle" is
&gt; "To promote and support Linux in South Australia". I suggest
&gt; incorporating and changing that to "To promote and support Free and
&gt; Open Source Software in South Australia". It seems to be closer to
&gt; what we are about (inclusive of Samba, Apache, GNOME, FreeBSD,
&gt; etc)...

Note that that probably wasn't the case 5 years ago.  Times change,
and so do the focus.

&gt; As a comparison, <A HREF="http://www,auug.org.au/info/">http://www,auug.org.au/info/</A> says that AUUG's
&gt; constitutional aim is "To promote knowledge and understanding of
&gt; Open Systems including but not restricted to the UNIX system,
&gt; networking, graphics, user interfaces and programming and
&gt; development environments, and related standards." ... I don't think
&gt; that that is quite us. (IMHO)

I'm not sure it's quite AUUG, either, but apart from the wording I
don't see that it's so different from LinuxSA's goals.  I'd guess that
this was written several years ago, and that if we were to write it
again nowadays, we would come up with something closer to what you
wrote in the paragraph above.

&gt;
&gt; As far as I can see the major impediment is membership fees.  To be
&gt; an ordinary member of AUUG costs $110 per year, which you more than
&gt; save if you go to the annual conference, but which is $110 per year
&gt; more than it currently costs to be a member of LinuxSA.

Note, however, that an incorporated LinuxSA would have to charge
membership fees.  I know some people think we could get by without,
but I'll lay any odds that if LinuxSA incorporates and stays alive for
three years, that it will have membership fees.

&gt; AUUG decided to create a new class of membership for affiliated
&gt; groups such as ours, so that the members of that affiliated group
&gt; could obtain most of the benefits of AUUG membership without having
&gt; to pay individual fees.  There are no further details yet, but I can
&gt; assure you that LinuxSA was specifically mentioned in the
&gt; discussions leading to that decision.

Here's an opportunity to beat chests.  I think David and I both had
the job of looking at this, and somehow it slipped between the
cracks.  There are two points to make here:

1.  We need to catch up with this as soon as possible.  I'd be very
    interested in constructive suggestions.  One possibility would be
    to lower individual membership fees and increase corporate fees,
    though I don't know what the rest of the Exec will have to say
    about that.  I'd be very open to discussion or suggestions.

2.  The fact that we haven't pursued this is that we don't have enough
    time to do our duties properly.  Believe me, the same will happen
    to LinuxSA after incorporation.

&gt; AUUG has sponsors. And I am sure other organisaitons have sponsors.
&gt;
&gt; We could take that approach try to raise funding like that.

We're trying too :-)  It's better than a kick in the behind, but it
doesn't account for more than a fraction of the revenue we get.

&gt; Does anyone have any idea what sort of funds would be required?
&gt; Obviously some insurance of some sort seeems to be necessary. THis
&gt; woudl appear to be the greatest expense.

I don't, but our treasurer, Luigi Cantoni, might be able to give you a
broad overview of where the money comes from and where it goes.  I'm
pretty sure that our finances are public knowledge.

&gt; I would also like to volunteer to help with drafting the consitution
&gt; and other similar instruments if we do incorproate.

Don't underestimate the amount of work this is.  It should also be
ratified by the membership.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Positives
&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------
&gt;
&gt; o it enables us to make financial transactions without resorting to the
&gt; cover of a group like AUUG.

Well, yes, but is that so important?

&gt; o it enables us to get our own insurance for events we are running.

This is positive?  Insurance costs money.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Negatives
&gt;&gt;&gt; ---------
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) Change
&gt;&gt;  - people hate it and it is a change
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) Organisational Issues
&gt;&gt;  - it's a new way of running the group
&gt;&gt;  - possibly committee meetings and such

As I've said, that's a big one.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, because Incorporating is "change" and it is a rather
&gt;&gt; "ethereal" (1) concept and doesn't have any immediate effects on how the
&gt;&gt; association operates - word your constitution correctly and we won't
&gt;&gt; notice a change - on the surface it appears to have more cons than pros.
&gt;
&gt; I think AGMs are _neccessary_ for incorporated bodies...

Correct.

In fact, AUUG is very much into something that's informal, regular
meetings, highly technical, very pizza-ish.  That's what we're
planning for this week or next (Sarah?).

Historically, we used to have an SA chapter which did exactly this.
For various reasons, many of them personality related, the SA chapter
died out years ago.  We're trying to reestablish it.

&gt; Who read the article in last weeks IT section of the Australian (or
&gt; was it the week before) where Microsoft have declared Linux as a

&gt; on the threat?  Is a bunch of like minded individuals or a

&gt; this?  Public education about Linux has never been so important.

Right, that's where our membership of the IT council comes in.
