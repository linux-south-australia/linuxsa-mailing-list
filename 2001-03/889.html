&gt; &gt; David's diplomacy is quite unique here
&gt;
&gt; No. It's not unique. I'm just as diplomatic, and just as truthful.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; maybe that's why AUUG has went from
&gt; &gt; strength to strength with such encouragement for people to post here.
&gt;
&gt; One of the arguments for not incorporating LinuxSA is people wouldn't
&gt; pay to be a member. What does this say about LinuxSA? People pay $110
&gt; per year to be a member of AUUG...s
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Your response to Michael's post was bullshit, and your a Council Member for
&gt; &gt; AUUG!!!  Sheesh
&gt;
&gt; It was true. Look up the archives of this list and Mr Newall and others
&gt; have all said what he said before. Besides, you only need to take a
&gt; representative sample of modems to prove it to yourself. Incidentally, I
&gt; believe David is a committee member of AUUG; I assume that is what you
&gt; meant.
&gt;
&gt; In that case, this last sentence has at least one truth in it. And it is
&gt; not the ordinate clause. It is the sub-ordinate clause.
