&gt; 
&gt; Do any of them actually -have- a $100 per month unlimited account?

I dont know.

The telstra dsl account is not truly unlimited, but it is close enough for
the avarerage users. I think it is reaonable but they dont actually say it
is unlimited.
It is not however as far as I can see, explictly traffic quota'd or time
quota'd as far as I can see.

So witin certain parameters, ie nto spaming, not running servers, the only
limits appear to be those imposed by infrastructure.

However the real point I was trying to make was there are reasons why what
is unsustainable for a regional isp might not be unsustaninable for a
larger one.

Ie I was trying to asnwer the specicif question that was asked of "how can
these non traffic limited accounts" be ecnonomically sustainable when
copanies must pay on a traffic counted way?

My answer is not all companies do have to pay that way.
Some fwerw get their traffic for virtully nothing( ogf course tehy apy
carrigage costs, but everyone does - the thign is saller palyers pay
carriage and data costs. Teh significance I think is that fcarriage is a
fixed knwo quantiy easily didved between a given user population wwheras
until recently traffic in this country was not, though I beleive it can be
now).


Then of course the obvious queitonis then why fdo they constantly go out
of business, get bought out or report loss? Or why are there not any of
these accounts?

My beleif is that although larger companies may  
have achieved a postion where they can
offer those services, they dont always do it efficiently.
Example large ISP contracts out their web site to portal company. Result
if optus has
an outage (eg mail servere fails - and they do ahve these outages) they
cant ust put a message on their web site. They need at least 24 hours to
get portal company to change their site content. Which of course leads to
tech suport having vast lines of users all wanting to know why mail doesnt
work.

They dont change their phone message to tell the user of the problem
either(why I am not sure). Result a user sits on hold for 45 minutes to be
told teh problem is not theirs its the ISPs. 

Inotehr words the larger isps are very inefficent in other areas, which
also directly influence the customer experince/quality of service.
Now I know that smalleer isp do ahve the ability to respond much much
better to users, but that still does nto change teh fact that teh ocosts
for smaller isps are differnet to the costs for larger isps, and therefore
larger isps can if they choose, offer accoutns whihc are economicaly
unfeasable to smaller isps.

Or larger isps simply choose not to offer these accounts in favour of
greater returns on investment, evne though they coudl if they wnated.
Which is quite reasonable, but that is a choice made by the board, or
mangemnt or the shareholders, it is not necesarily (or I think likely) a
result of ecnomical unfeasablility of offering an unquota'd traffic
account.

In other words I think the reasons are not so much to do with the cost of
supplyingthe conectivty and the cost of traffic, but are related to otehr
factors.

&gt; what is 'unlimited' in those accounts what is 'limited'? Otherwise 
&gt; you're comparing eggs to albatrosses and the whole thing is pointless 
&gt; (which it probably is anyway...)

I dont recall making comments about unlimited acounts, weitehr exisitng
or beign economically.
I believe my assertaion was more along the lines of charging by other
crtieria tnan per magebyte is possible and could be done at a profit using
fixed price badnwidth billed p[ipes instead of per meg pipes -
probably not as big a profit as chargingg per meg though, but I did nto
say it woudl be as profitable, I just said I thought it was possible. 

&gt; 
&gt; i.e. put up (with explicit terms and conditions for each account) - 
&gt; please - I'm bloody curious.

Not part of my assertion.

But I would suggest that if such a product were to be offered it woudl
likely have a time based limit, ie the old kick/fair share dameon, which I
think is consistnet with my asetaion taht non traffic based billing is
possible in a profitable manner.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Ie the smae rules dont apply at all levels, which is why at some levels it
&gt; &gt;may be possible to do things which are impossible at other levels.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's quite true as a general statement, and it's one of the 
&gt; challenges for any new entrant these days - to get large enough to 
&gt; hit realistic economies of scale.
&gt; 
&gt; We happen to have pretty much got there, but that's out of having 
&gt; been in the industry very early indeed, so we've got a lot of total 
&gt; data volume flowing at this point. This is not a good time to enter 
&gt; the ISP market.

Hmm, that old chestnut.. ;-) 
The "ineveitable industry shake" out which has been threatening the
industry for at least 5 years now (ie over half of the life time of the
industry).

In fact based on some figrues peopel ahve thrown around the lit I came up
with a business plan... want to invest? ;-))

It surely woud be harder now, but I still think it would be possible.
Especially with semi - creative products, marketing/loyalty schemes, and
the ever difficult to get, good service.

Admitedly I havent personally ever had an Internode account, but I have
had accounts with at least 3 major(national) and 3 regional as well as a
couple of local ISPs(and worked in  a few local ISPs too), and have not
yet found one that does all things as well as I would like. And
in all cases the problems to which I am  referring have been related to
service in the non strictly techinical sense(ie not bandwidth pronblems,
or constant busy signal, or dropouts - though I have epxerinecd those, but
that was fair given the account style). The problem has always been
treatment of users, staff cluelessness about their products unshceduled
outages that could have been scheduled,poor billing, etc etc. 
In other words all things that could have been fixed with interested
managemnt and forthought, for growth which was obviouly not planned for
when the enterprise started.

Now a specific question about Internode products.

Are you delivering adsl now?

Can you deliver it to Mile End(I think the West Adelaide exchange)?
