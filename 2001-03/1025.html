&gt; &gt; I could actually install Linux on the 15GB drive, it is just that the

&gt; Isn't that something to do with not having lilo installed after cylinder
&gt; 1024? I would have thought that as long as the BIOS could see the boot
&gt; sector, it should be fine.

Richard knows enough about computers to realise when the BIOS isn't
detecting the hard drive. He even says so in the sentence immediately above
yours.

&gt; Maybe, if that doesn't work, you could install /boot + boot record on to
&gt; either another partition (at the start of the disk) or put a small
&gt; (100MB) hard drive in to hold the /boot partition and boot off of that.

This would probably be the quickest and simplest answer. Wouldn't even need
to be 100Mb, and old 20Mb one (IF you can find a reliable one!) would
suffice.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen this? Does anyone know of any BIOS updates for Award
that
&gt; &gt; take it over the 8.4GB limit?
&gt;
&gt; A lot of the BIOS manufacturers don't actually distribute the BIOS
&gt; updates from their site. They generally have a message saying "Go to the
&gt; motherboard manufacturer's website and download it there". If it's not a
&gt; reputable (recognised brand) they often don't have websites which makes
&gt; downloading BIOS updates a tad hard.

I don't know if I would trust something that wipes the BIOS from my
motherboard and then writes a new one, what happens if you have a power cut
half way through?? The board is a throwaway... You would want to make sure
you use a UPS!
