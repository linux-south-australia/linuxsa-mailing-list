&gt; Hi Folks, another newbie question, this time to do with setting up Apache,
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you will be able to help re installing problem with Apache.  
&gt; I've now come to reasonable grips with MySql and now need to install Apache.
&gt; Followed basic installation instructions and everything looks OK.

I take it Apache was installed from RPM?

&gt; I'm running mdk7.2 and installed latest version apache_1.3.19.
&gt; When I go to start Apache, I get a syntax error, from hpptd.conf.  I think
&gt; it
&gt; has to do with ServerAdmin and ServerName strings in hpptd.conf.  Trouble is
&gt; I have trouble trying to figure out what parameters I should be giving it. 

vi /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
(in command mode) :19 (takes you to line 19)

&gt; When this is run $./bin/apachectl start
&gt; Syntax error line 19 of /usr/local/apach_1.3.19/conf/httpd.conf
&gt; ie I think line 19 is at or around the ServerAdmin string.

Have you ran `apachectl configtest`

&gt; These are currently:
&gt; ServerAdmin <A HREF="mailto:stan@localhost.localdomain">stan@localhost.localdomain</A>
&gt; ServerName localhost

MIne is like this:

ServerAdmin <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>

Which would make yours valid.

I don't actually have the ServerName directive set, it's commented out.

&gt; (I tried a couple of variations as root ie <A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> and even set
&gt; ServerName 127.0.0.1)

Try commenting it out (put # at the start of the line with the
ServerName directive on it)

&gt; I figure something is wrong here, but I'm still get confused with DNS stuff.

Is this a standalone box, or is it part of a network?

&gt; Any help or ideas, greatly appreciated.  I've still the got the trauma of
&gt; getting PHP to work and then building my database.

It gets easier every time you do it :-) Make sure with PHP that you read
the INSTALL file thoroughly, it makes it a lot easier. Seeing as Apache
is already installed, you'd probably want to install it using
`--with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs' which compiles apache as a
module, rather than into the core. It is marginally slower than having
it hard-compiled into Apache, but I daresay it won't make too much
difference.
