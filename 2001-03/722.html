Longish note about things going wrong with config files.
-------------------------------------------------------


I thought I'd just share with you my experiences with
rc.config files and SuSE 7.1.

I always knew that the /etc/rc.config file in SuSE could
be a single point of disaster. But now I've
experienced it myself directly.
Here's my sorry saga.

-	First I got a second-hand computer to configure
	up as a firewall/server, with Cyrix as CPU.
	That was a disaster.
-	So I exchanged that for AMD K6-2/500 on a 
	Biostar board. I should have expected trouble
	from a board with that sort of name.
-	As opposed to the old Cyrix board, the new
	Biostar AT board had a PS-2 interface which was
	incompatible with the case.
	It would have been necessary to drill through
	two panels of metal to get the mouse cable
	through to the on-board PS-2 socket.
-	So.... I got a little external PS-2 socket
	thingy to slot in for the mouse, and connected it
	up to the little 5-pin thingy on the board.
-	Problem: when I tried to get this going with
	YaST, it didn't show up. Everything was connected
	right. But nothing worked.
-	Then the bad move:
	I tried to configure as a Logitech PS-2 mouse with
	z-coordinate sliders (which that mouse did have),
	and both the mouse _and_ keyboard froze.
	So I couldn't do anything except re-boot the thing.
	(Ctrl-Alt-Fn did nothing.)

-	After doing this for a while, and relying on the 
	magical ReiserFS file system to recover each time
	I rebooted the machine, it finally trashed my
	/etc/rc.config file which YaST was editing at the
	time.
-	Result: the PC with trashed /etc/rc.config file
	(including blocks of binary and missing some blocks)
	was quite useless. 

-	As it turned out, the back file rc.config.old was
	trashed equally badly. 
	But.... there was another file /etc/rc.config.old.o
	which very mysteriously had a date 3 days old but
	had the most recent changes in it!!!
-	So I worked from that and got it going.
	No problem - just lost yet another 3 hours of my life!

Now the moral of this story for me is that just as in the case of
the dreaded very-evil Wind95 Registry, so too the config files
of both RH and SuSE seem to be points of great vulnerability.

This must be a common occurrence:
-	User modifies config file
-	User gets locked out
-	User re-boots without sync
-	Machine re-boots with crummy config file.

Therefore....  Backup that bit config file.
Yes, I know that this is obvious.
But unlike backing up 70 GB of hard drives, it's not that hard to do.
Maybe linux OSs should have cron jobs that make maintain backups
of the last few weeks of config files in case they get lost.

I just wanted to get that off my chest...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Has anyone else got one of these crummy Biostar mainboards?
The model is M5VNB and it uses an AT power supply.
Is this board known to be okay?
Or should I dump it before I get too attached to it?

Despite the almost certainly correct statements from knoledgeable
people like Mark Newton to the effect that the ATX power supply does
not preclude the PC coming on when mains power is applied, not a single
PC seller in Adelaide has been able to provide me with a board
which does with with the ATX power supply.
