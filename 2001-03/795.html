&gt; I should clarify my position.  I understand that there are economic requirements - I just fail to see why people should just sit down and accept things the way they are.  Sure people around the world are worse off than we are - however - we did not get to where we are by never changing anything.

The best way you can change things is to use a local ISP, preferably one
connected to SAIX. If enough people demand this of their ISP, the big
national ISP's will be forced to peer and access will be faster and
cheaper for everyone. By going for a cheap unlimited account now you are
selling out the future.


&gt; What about caching?  Some ISPs offer unlimited download from their cache or newsgroup.  I would have absolutely no problem keeping many downloads to a cache if this was not taken off my cap.  At the moment with my present ISP - newsgroups and cache is still considered a download.

Caching is not just used to make bandwidth cheaper, it's also used to
give the user a better internet experience by speeding up frequently
accessed sites. A good quality cache will also verify that an object is
"current" possibly by checking a last-modified server header on the
remote web server. This isn't free, and returning a cached object isn't
always the best course of action either.

Caches themselves cost a lot of money. A caching applicance like a
Cacheflow or Cisco Cache Engine with a specification of interest to
ISP's starts at around $50,000. Even a squid cache with enough grunt to
keep 100 customers happy will cost over $5000 plus valuable setup,
testing and tuning time. Why would an ISP spend this money on the
hardware to give away the services it provides?


&gt; Perhaps an ISP could work on requests - if many people have indicated an interest in a particular ISO for Linux - then they could cache it.  An intelligent cache would notice 10 people downloading from one site and then cache it and then redirect requests to the cache instead.  I have always seen a major burden on the Internet as being people downloading the one item over and over again.  

Due to the proliferation of mirrors and fan sites, a big download will
often have many different locations to download from. Unfortunately,
it's not easy for a cache to work out that users are downloading the
same file when they each use different URLs. If you try and cache based
on filename, what happens when someone downloads "setup.exe"? If you try
and cache based on specific names, what happens when a new version comes
out? What happens to the performance of a cache that has to sift through
a list of 100 - 10000 popular filenames with EVERY URL request?


&gt; What about (correct me if I am mistaken) IPv6 or mbone?  I recall reading an article in the Australian about multicasting audio and video streams down the net.  I could not care if I had to wait 10 minutes or half an hour or whatever for the next multicast to start.  It strikes me as incredibly inefficient that we will have a server sending out audio streams to thousands and computers simultaneously - often passing identical data streams through one ISPs network.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems to be a terrible burden on the Internet and ISPs.  I have always wondered why something has not been done about it.

This is to do with the companies making the streaming-media software,
ie: realplayer and microsoft. They want to keep their protocols a
secret, and as a result caching/multicasting proxies havn't been
developed. I think that Akamai supports some sort of streaming. It's
also possible to cache some realplayer objects when they're not streamed
from a realserver. I havn't seen anyone yet rallying ISP's together to
support multicasting, so maybe you could get a job at a media company to
do so :)

Also Ian, please switch to a mail client that wraps the text on the
outgoing message, it's difficult to read and doesn't quote very well on
reply.
