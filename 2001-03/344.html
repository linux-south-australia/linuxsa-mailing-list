Absolutely right Mark,

I've had 6 weeks of incompetence, patiently waiting for Orange phone
company to solve a defect with my phone.
One email to the TIO, brought a phone call from an Orange Customer
Relations Executive the next day.
My phone still doesn't work properly,but I'm working with Orange to get
the problem resolved & I've got a big stick, behind me called the TIO.

Its called escalating the problem in IBM management speak.
Other people call it lobbying, you need to know how to make people
squirm, this requires some skill.

Look at Jeffrey Bennett & his Win95 licence that was bundled with his
Toshiba.

I'm patiently preparing a case against iPrimus.
Once I've got all my facts I'll be emailing customer support, (I'd tried
to call today but was unable to, since their system was congested, just
to informally find out what is going on).

I really just want a reliable ADSL service, without any hassles.

A business's worst nightmare is the disgruntled customer who *doesn't*
go away...

&gt; 
&gt; Have you contacted iPrimus first, and received some kind of answer,
&gt; explanation or rebate from them?  The TIO is supposed to be an office
&gt; of *last* resort.
