&gt;training requirements, compatibility with M$, etc.

We are running the old version 6 on a six month demo licence.
But now version 7 is out I really hope it fixes some of the big bugs, like the seriously ugly from: address.

&gt;Maintanence requirements?

Version 6 has been a breeze, but then I have root access to the Linux box and we have less than 10 users.

Regards,

Patrick Browne
