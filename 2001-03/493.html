&gt;The Question Is:
&gt; "Is this thread on topic?"

Yes. Linux users may require more bandwidth with which to download their
operating system. Windows users generally get their OS on CD, or at least
pre-installed on the hard drive. There, now it's not-so-far offtopic :)

Most people with a few years in the ISP business will have seen the scenario
where X-unlimited-ISP goes broke, and the hundreds of customers descend on
all other local ISP's demanding the same service. The clear and painful
evidence[1] that the business model is flawed is lost on these people. They
just ring up, ask for a service with unlimited downloads, and tell the ISP
what a ripoff they must be for not offering it before hanging up and
dialling the next number in the yellow pages. To my knowledge, none of these
people have been linux users[2], although I suspect some of them of using
Amigas :) After receiving 20 such calls in a day, one starts to build a
negative opinion of people demanding unlimited-download accounts.

Local ISP's that I've seen really do try hard to please everyone, and it is
a bit of a letdown to have potential new customers calling with outrageous
demands that can't possibly be met.

[1] If I have misjudged the population of the list and it's not so clear,
the evidence is that X-unlimited-ISP has gone broke, which is one way of
proving that they did not have a sustainable business model, and that no-one
in their right mind would commit commercial suicide by copying it

[2] See, it can still be on-topic. Almost. [3]

[3] Actually, people requesting support for linux/bsd are a delight to deal
with, at least until they ask you to write new drivers for their unsupported
hardware :)
