&gt; As has been mentioned in the past, maybe we should think of becoming
&gt; the SA branch of AUUG...

As far as I can see the major impediment is membership fees.  To be an
ordinary member of AUUG costs $110 per year, which you more than save if
you go to the annual conference, but which is $110 per year more than
it currently costs to be a member of LinuxSA.  AUUG decided to create
a new class of membership for affiliated groups such as ours, so that
the members of that affiliated group could obtain most of the benefits
of AUUG membership without having to pay individual fees.  There are no
further details yet, but I can assure you that LinuxSA was specifically
mentioned in the discussions leading to that decision.


&gt; IMHO, this option offers us too little, and really doesn't represent
&gt; what we are about. I don't know what AUUG are mainly focussed on, and
&gt; maybe it is primarily Linux and open source stuff, but I guess I see
&gt; it as something that is commercial-focussed...

AUUG is focussed on technology, not on commerce.  AUUG conferences are
technologically focussed.  I doubt you'd ever get anybody presenting a
paper titled, "I made a squillion bucks from Unix and you can too."
Being also interested in commercial operating systems in no way makes
AUUG commerically focussed.

&gt; AUUG's constitutional aim is "To promote knowledge and understanding
&gt; of Open Systems including but not restricted to the UNIX system,
&gt; networking, graphics, user interfaces and programming and development
&gt; environments, and related standards." ... I don't think that that is
&gt; quite us. (IMHO)

That sounds exactly like us to me.
