Are you running an Domain Controller anywhere (Windows 2000, Windows NT
or Samba?)?

The smb.conf file says not to make modifications by hand. Have you ever
had any problems doing this?

&gt; Note that the netlogon is generated by a script. This is just one example.

Is there a reason for this? What happens if you change the login script
for the problem user (I'm assuming it's only happening to one user) to
be a static one?

&gt; Yup, tried that. Sooner or later the extra drive will reappear. It's not
&gt; clear what's triggering it.

Does it suddenly reappear whilst you are logged in or at login?
How regularly does it happen after you disconnect each drive?
You mentioned you were running SP6 on NT4. Have you tried the final
patch for NT (SP6A)? Apparently, SP6 has some problems. Perhaps this
would help.

&gt; We're based in Melbourne, Fitzroy to be specific (not exactly Southern
&gt; Australia i realize).

Yeah, It'd probably take a while to drive there after work tonight. :-)

&gt; Thanks for the quick reponse,

No problems

Matt
