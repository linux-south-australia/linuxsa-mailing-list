I can see your point about AUUG - but myself as a non-technical person using Linux mostly for political and personal reasons have little more than a passing interest in Unix - I will never likely have a &lt;insert name of kick butt workstation / mainframe here&gt; at home to play with.  AUUG is not relevant to myself and many others in my position.

To us - Linux is freedom - it has little to do with Unix (for us).

The important point is that while yes, Linux is is in the Unix family (and thank the Lord for that - I owe my reliable system to this fact!) - for non techical Linux users this is not so relevant.

Linux is being marketed as a viable desktop and server system - not SCO Unix, FreeBSD, etc (as excellent as these systems may be technically - Linux is the one that is out there).  And considering the intense interest in Linux - LinuxSA should respond to this by presenting a incorporated organisation to the media, other organisations, companies, etc.  In short - Linux needs a public face in South Australia - IMHO

&gt;&gt; &gt; IIRC, there was talk in the past about AUUG helping LinuxSA become an
&gt;&gt; &gt; incorporated body.  I am not sure where the rest of the AUUG executive
&gt;&gt; &gt; committee members stand on this issue, is it worth pursing this matter and
&gt;&gt; &gt; finding out what is involved?  What are peoples thoughts on this matter?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; IMHO, I think ongoing relationship with AUUG would be good. I personally
&gt;&gt; don't see why we shouldn't be separate, and I feel like I'd prefer that, but
&gt;&gt; maybe it shuold be persued a little... hmm
&gt;
&gt;I think people thought that I thought that AUUG would be a competitor - I was
&gt;(rather badly) trying to suggest that LinuxSA need not become AUUG through
&gt;incorporation (not that there's anything wrong with AUUG), but rather the two
&gt;organisations should be complimentary.
&gt;
&gt;I see AUUG as something that's more appropriate for lobbying, for conferences,
&gt;and the like, while LinuxSA as something that's informal, regular meetings,
&gt;highly technical, very pizza-ish.  Both are useful, both are great, both have
&gt;their place.
&gt;
&gt;Just MHO,
