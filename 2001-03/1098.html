&gt; Hi -- I whipped this up as a proposal that I think we should adopt (although
&gt; I don't know how an amorphous blob of people goes about adopting anything,
&gt; but anyway). It's all IMHO, but I'd quite like it to be LinuxSA's HO. It
&gt; still needs work, and I'd suggest that it should be turned into a FAQ,
&gt; really... Whatever -- if I get something started, maybe someone else will
&gt; volunteer to take it over and do it properly when they're not tired and etc
&gt; like I am now.
&gt; 
&gt; Feel free to add to or disagree with anything here.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------
&gt; Unofficial LinuxSA Etiquette Guide.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. About LinuxSA and the List
&gt; 
&gt; LinuxSA was started in 1996 as an informal Linux User Group aiming "To
&gt; promote and support Linux in South Australia". Presently, the mailing list
&gt; has around 400 subscribers, including people from Adelaide, Rural SA,
&gt; interstate and overseas. These people vary wildly in their ages (from high
&gt; school and possibly younger up to retirees), level of experience (guru
&gt; hacker types down to "what's a Linux?" newbies), gender, race, sexuality,
&gt; vocation, socio-economic grouping, level of English literacy, intelligence,
&gt; and so on. The only thing that all subscribers can be assumed to have in
&gt; common is an interest in Linux (and/or *BSD and other Free and Open Source
&gt; Software). However, even this interest varies -- some see Linux as a
&gt; religion, some see it as the enemy, some see it as a sideline, some as a
&gt; hobby, and some just as a means to an end. Whatever the case, this list
&gt; forms part of the unnoficial support network for Linux in SA. People come
&gt; here looking for help, and if you want to promote Linux in SA, particularly
&gt; in Businesses, then helping them is the best way to go about it.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Posting
&gt; 
&gt; When posting, bear in mind that the list is a public forum, with many people
&gt; who don't have much in common with yourself. To help facilitate effective
&gt; communication (ooh, now I feel like a PHB), LinuxSA has in place a very
&gt; sophisticated moderation system. It's called the LinuxSA Voluntary
&gt; Self-Moderation System (or LSAVSMS for short). It works like this: Before
&gt; posting something, re-read it and moderate as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; Generally:
&gt; 1. Is it in HTML. Make it not so -- plain text is preferred by many.
&gt; 2. Do you have line wrap turned off -- turn it on... it irritates some
&gt; readers, and makes the web archive hard to read.
&gt; 3. Is it insulting, or a flame? Don't send it. This includes condescension,
&gt; harsh sarcasm, accusation of stupidity, and personal attacks. LinuxSA
&gt; doesn't need them, so please don't send them.
&gt; 4. Is the subject line relevant to the subject matter, and specific enough
&gt; to be userful? "A Question" is not useful. Nor is "No Subject" or "".
&gt; 5. Is it signal or noise? Signal is good, noise is bad. Noise doesn't add
&gt; anything to the list, and serves only to camoflage the signal. A post is
&gt; generally good if it causes (or enables) you or someone else to learn
&gt; something or fix something. Most Anti-MS jokes have been done before, and
&gt; aren't worth sending to the list, especially if that's the whole content of
&gt; your post. Be aware that some people on the list may be MS weenies...
&gt; 6. Has the subject matter been covered before? Check the archives. Will
&gt; bringing it up again really add anything other than traffic to the list?
&gt; 7. If you're responding to a flame or insult, take it with a pinch of salt,
&gt; and try to let it slide -- flaming trolls doesn't really help anyone.
&gt; 
&gt; If your post is a techical question:
&gt; 1. Have you RTFM? If not, then either go do so, or say you haven't, and why
&gt; not -- maybe you don't know where to look, or you've been looking and still
&gt; don't get it -- that's fine, say so.
&gt; 2. Have you specified the question clearly? "How do I get GNOME to work?" is
&gt; not a good question. Include whatever is relevant -- Hardware specs (CPU,
&gt; RAM)Distribution, revision, kernel, any customisations, versions of the
&gt; software you are using, what shell you are running it under, what the error
&gt; or problem is, and what you have tried. If there are a few obvious solutions
&gt; that you have tried, mention them. It makes you look like less of a newbie,
&gt; and prevents people from telling you what you already know.
&gt; 3. If you are a newbie to the subject matter of your email, feel free to
&gt; state so. It helps people tailor their response to you.
&gt; 
&gt; If your post is a response to a technical question:
&gt; 1. If it's not polite, it's not useful. Insulting someone because they asked
&gt; (or answered) a question is not conducive to helping them learn.
&gt; 2. If you have a reference (URL or whatever), mention it. Other people can
&gt; then go check it and often will learn more that way.
&gt; 3. If your response is basically RTFM, at least point the person in the
&gt; direction of TFM. A URL to TFM or something to search for "Check the 'HOW-TO
&gt; frobnicate' document" is helpful, "RTFM" is not. If someone is new, they may
&gt; not be aware of HOW-TOs or man pages or RFCs or whatever. Just be aware of
&gt; this when responding.
&gt; 4. Generally, whatever solution you have is not neccessarily the only or the
&gt; best way to do it. As the Perl guys say, TMTOWTDI. No matter how good or
&gt; experienced you are, there's always someone who can think of a different way
&gt; that in some cases may be better. So put on the humble hat.
&gt; 
&gt; If your post is a plug or advertisement:
&gt; 1. prefix the subject line wiht "[ADD]" or "[PLUG]".
&gt; 2. Go easy on the promotion -- only promote things that are relevant to
&gt; Linux users, and don't do it too much, or people get irritable.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, write in a considerate, helpful manner, and we can all get along
&gt; fine, just fine.
