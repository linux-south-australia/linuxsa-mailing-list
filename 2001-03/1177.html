&gt; Actually Simon, I could live with this without qualm because
&gt; contrary to popular
&gt; belief  :-) most people I know don't D/L a great deal. I would

Many people do though. Many people also think 1.5g/month is a great deal to
be downloading.

&gt; really like DSL
&gt; to be the same, ie 1.5meg/month  for a fixed fee, then I could plan around

I assume you mean gig/month...

&gt; that.  It's the 300meg and knowing you'd blow it out of the water
&gt; in a month and
&gt; then its a lottery time for the next bill.

<A HREF="http://www.bigpond.com/broadband/adsl/pricing.asp">http://www.bigpond.com/broadband/adsl/pricing.asp</A>

As an eg, suppose you are otherwise happy with Telstra's BlastOff DSL
service...

you could simply budget on paying:

$89.50/month for 250Mb, plus 1250*$0.189 ($236.25) for the rest...

So that's $325.75/month for your 1.5G. I'm sure telstra won't mind if you
give them that amount and use less...

&gt; Can you put together a package with a reasonable amount of D/L?

I'm sure that (once Internode's ADSL pricing becomes settled and public) you
could do it as above yourself...

based on <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2001-01/922.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2001-01/922.html</A> ,

the above would cost you: $249 (for an average cost of 16.6c/meg). Again,
I'm sure Internode wouldn't mind if you give them that amount and use
less...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; Given the recent thread on 'unlimited' everything, see below.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;    When you connect to the internet with dingo blue, you get totally
&gt; &gt; &gt;    unlimited access for a flat rate.
&gt; &gt; &gt;    That means unlimited time, unlimited downloads, up to 5 email
&gt; &gt; &gt;    addresses and 5MB of personal web space.

The point Simon was making by forwarding this mail is simply that
"unlimited" accounts either aren't, or they are not profitable, so they will
become limited in some way. This has happened, as follows below...

&gt; &gt; &gt;and only a few lines down, on the very same page...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;    IMPORTANT
&gt; &gt; &gt;    From April 1, the dingo blue Internet Service will be subject to a
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Reasonable Use Policy limiting users to no more than 400 hours of
&gt; &gt; &gt;    dial-up access per month and restricting downloads to a
&gt; maximum of 1.5
&gt; &gt; &gt;    Gb of data per month.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;    In addition, dingo blue will impose the following
&gt; conditions to ensure
&gt; &gt; &gt;    the availability of the dial-up network for all users:
&gt; &gt; &gt;      * 60 minute idle disconnect (effective April 15, 2001)
&gt; &gt; &gt;      * 12 hour hard session limit (effective July 15, 2001)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Unlimited time and downloads? Umm...

ie -- the "unlimited" account is now not unlimited. It may be a different
deal to other accounts, and _less_ limited than them, and it may be better
value for some people, but it's not "unlimited".

Maybe ISPs should copy phone companies, and try plans with a certain monthly
fee with a certain no of meg included, with a sliding scale of cost per
extra meg... eg $10/month plan with 10meg download, and $1/meg after
that.... $40/month plan with 100meg d/l and 25c/meg after that... Could be
too complex... The other thing that I like about my new Optus plan is the
rollover feature. It would be great to have that with an ISP...
