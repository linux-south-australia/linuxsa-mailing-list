just going off topic once more, iPrimus have just re-structured their
pricing plan, so that they no longer offer unlimited data ADSL. their
pricing is I think now more horrific than Telstra's !

Subject: Re: more ADSL ISP queries.


&gt;I know this kind of thing has been done to death recently, but ... this is
a
&gt;question of fact, so shouldn't cause any flame wars :)
&gt;
&gt;I note that ISPs are generally charging more for the faster connections --
&gt;eg 512K vs 1500K -- but you get the same MB cap, and I assume everything
&gt;else is the same... Is there a cost difference in providing these? Is it in
&gt;the modem, the equipment at the exchange, or the link from the exchange to
&gt;support the potential extra bandwidth? Personally, I'd love to have
1.5Mbps,
&gt;and particuarly the higher uplink speeds, but wouldn't use many more MB in
&gt;total if I were to have it... Where is the cost here? Or is it mainly
&gt;marketing (which IMHO, is fine, if a little irritating to people like me :)

Yes, the 1.5 Mb/s option costs more at a wholesale level, as well as
at a retail level, from Telstra, to provide, relative to the 256kb/s
speed.

They charge more because - well - because they can. I tried reasoning
with their wholesale reps about this issue, given that the hardware
concerned is identical and it's just a software setting, and I have
to pay them separately (and hugely) for the data pipe into their ADSL
'network', which funds any higher demands on their infrastructure
anyway.

Guess how far I got.
