&gt;its not going to happen
&gt;overnight, and change must happen at the POLICY-MAKING level.
&gt;The majority of gov. decision-makers in IT, as you would no doubt know
&gt;already, have
&gt;NO IDEA, they just do what the policy says, and the ppl who write the policy
&gt;also
&gt;have NO IDEA, they just do what Microsoft says.  Its us poor sods at the
&gt;bottom of the food chain who have some idea but can't (officially) change
&gt;anything because policy says we can't.*

Well - here is one person - even if I am at the bottom
of the corporate food chain in my organisation - one
that handles the outsourcing contracts for the
government - will not put this is in the too hard
basket.

Sorry to say LinuxSA'ers - I am a little disappointed
by the reluctance of people to stand up and be counted.
Call it whinging if you will - I call it making a 
stand for what I believe in - and I believe in the 
open source community and what it stands for - not just
its technical expertise.

So lets get our heads together and make headway.  I
hope you people realise that we if just sit around
sending non offensive 'IMHOs' to each other - we will
fade away to an interesting footnote in the history
of the IT / computer world.

&gt;A lot of techs who I know in govt. depts. recognize the value of non-MS
&gt;solutions, but there aren't many who: 
&gt;a) are willing to try the alternatives to MS because of the mountains of red
&gt;tape holding them back, ie: the too hard basket

Which is what I find myself dealing with now - here in
LinuxSA and at work every day.  I am not technically
minded - I am no genius - but I can see the futility
of putting open source in to the 'too hard basket'.

&gt;b) want to change, even if its a better solution,

See point A
 
&gt;c) know any better, they're the typical MCSE-clone & know nothing but
&gt;Microsoft

With these people - I do my best to be diplomatic.
I have found that many in fact listen to me when I
politely explain a few facts they did not know.  But
like any cult member - you don't want to threaten
their belief system too much - people tend to get
quit aggressive if you do that!

&gt;Having said that, I know of one instance where FreeBSD is used to provide 
&gt;WAN connectivity to a large number of sites, 
&gt;Personally I run 4 Linux boxen that provide, among other things, file +
&gt;print, groupware apps, 
&gt;web services, RAS services (unofficially of course ;-)
&gt;(The above cases are functioning in government networks)

Now you're talking my language.  Lets have a case
analysis as a new thread on this discussion group.

We need:  Costs, user response, training and management
acceptance - and then and only then technical
credentials (lets get the marketing bit down pat first)

&gt;Change has to start somewhere, why not here & every other mailing list on
&gt;the planet! ;-)

I am frustrated (I will not spit the dummy and run away
though) with flames and derision.  I have pointed out
time and time again that I am not a technical person
and I will never pretend to be.  I just believe in
freedom and choice and natural evolution (survival of
the fittest computer systems)

&gt;PS: the above views are my own and not those of my employers, more's the
&gt;pity!

No - what is a pity is that we are not trying harder
to put together a case analysis and a marketing plan.
That the Linux community will happily gloat over
victories (this and that case study on Slashdot) but
will not seriously consider the hard slog of marketing
Linux (or any open OS for that matter).

It is a pity when people put things in the 'too hard'
basket.  This a practice which needs to stop.
