Steve,

You can get unlimited traffic from anyone.  Maybe it'll be as much as you
can download through an oversubscribed pipe, but hey, if they let you keep
sucking as long as you want does it really matter if you've only drunk a
few hundred kb by the end of the day?  Oh, it does?  Okay, try this: Find
out how much it costs to put in a fat international link.  Work out how
many subscribers you can afford to let at it before it, too, is oversub-
scribed, and then divide your cost by your subscriber base.  The number
you come up with will be orders of magnitude bigger than any $25 per month
plan that you've ever seen.  I happen to think Big Pond Direct's $990 per
month for a 64K pipe is a good deal (some ISP's think that's far too
cheap) and as I'm sure you we're all willing to pay a fair cost can we
stop the bleating and go sign up now?  If one wants unlimited downloads
one only has to pay one's way.  Easy as that.

David
