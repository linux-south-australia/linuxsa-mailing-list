Stephen!

&gt; David's diplomacy is quite unique here

No. It's not unique. I'm just as diplomatic, and just as truthful.

&gt; maybe that's why AUUG has went from
&gt; strength to strength with such encouragement for people to post here.

One of the arguments for not incorporating LinuxSA is people wouldn't
pay to be a member. What does this say about LinuxSA? People pay $110
per year to be a member of AUUG...s

&gt; Your response to Michael's post was bullshit, and your a Council Member for
&gt; AUUG!!!  Sheesh

It was true. Look up the archives of this list and Mr Newall and others
have all said what he said before. Besides, you only need to take a
representative sample of modems to prove it to yourself. Incidentally, I
believe David is a committee member of AUUG; I assume that is what you
meant.

In that case, this last sentence has at least one truth in it. And it is
not the ordinate clause. It is the sub-ordinate clause.
