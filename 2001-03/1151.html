&gt; This is not a technical list.  It's a party attended by people with a

&gt; that.  Most of what we do is noise, and often interesting noise at that.
&gt; Your guide leaves the impression that the list must only be used for
&gt; linux and open source related messages, and we have never behaved in
&gt; that restricted way before.  I don't think we want to start now.


David,

Agreed.
There are a zillion technical lists out there.
Most people on this list would also be on half a dozen or more
lists for their specialist interests.
The LinuxSA list is a generalist list, suitable for newcomers
and experts alike.
Around about 1-2 years ago, though, it changed from a formal sort
of list to a chat list.

Since we all presumably have procmail to whip the linuxSA
mails into a separate folder, and we all have mail readers
to enable us to scan the posters/subjects of all mails,
it's unnecessary to get authoritarian and right-wingish
with the threads that go on too long.
Just skip them!
Even back in 1985, I remember that the Usenet news group
reading software "rn" (by Larry Wall) already had facilities
to "kill thread" - i.e. to not even display a thread that
someone did not like.
I don't even bother with this.
I just skim over the subject names.
When a thread goes feral, I skip over it all, unless
I same the name of a poster who has historically a good record
for writing poignant posts.

As Mao said, 
"Let a thousand flowers bloom, let a thousand schools contend."

There are some people on this list who can not resist passing jusdgement
on threads, individual e-mails or even individual posters.
It isn't necessary to make such judgements.
The utterances of those posters gets low priority for my reading.
(They know who they are, I'm sure.)
Now a set of formalised etiquette rules comes up from time to time
in every mailing list.
People who write these things seem to think that there is a single
set of universal values which we can all subscribe to.
Cultural and value system relativism is part of reality, like
dirt, death and germs. 
There's no cure for it.
Tolerance is good. Authoritarianism is bad.
And this is universally true.
But should we tolerate authoritarianism?

I think that if one does not like a club, there are plenty more
clubs on the Internet.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. One of the things I learned at Uni was that you learn more than
50% from other students and University life, not just the courses.
Similarly, you sometimes learn more from the "noise" on mailing
lists than from the "topically correct" posts.

PPS. Obviously most of these comments are not directed to
you personally, David.
