&gt; So THIS is a BIG sin, but THIS is a little sin ... ??

that was my point.

&gt; &gt; Hmmm... I can't think which thread this is.
&gt;
&gt; Lack of knowledge is excusable.  Deliberate obtuseness isn't.

I don't get that.

&gt; &gt; But anyway -- maybe I should have reworded my original as "surely there
&gt; &gt; aren't any mail readers out there that can't deal with wrapping
&gt; their own
&gt; &gt; text." Are there? what mail reader do you use?
&gt;
&gt; No you should have not have intruded in the first place without the
&gt; knowledge to back your comments.  I am also NOT going to enter into a
&gt; silly "my reader is better than your reader" conversation.

ok

&gt; PLEASE take a single line of (say) Ian's message and place it in
&gt; various editors which might be available to you and see how they handle
&gt; that paragraph-line.  Then ask yourself WHY they don't all handle that
&gt; paragraph-line the same way.

ok

&gt; You are clearly unaware that there are good reasons why mail readers
&gt; should NOT wrap incoming mail.  It isn't just the creation of an ugly
&gt; mess when your reader wraps a message that is already wrapped.

or the just as common problem of mail client programs wrapping it uglyly on
sending...

&gt; Try handling 100 lines x 10 columns of technical results with a reader
&gt; that wraps automatically.

true. I have had this problem before, which is why I would choose for the
wrap to be decided by the receiver rather than the sender.

&gt; I believe that there is an argument that readers should wrap incoming
&gt; mail automatically, but so far as I can see it only has merit in the
&gt; receipt of M$Word-type paragraphs, which you shouldn't be getting from
&gt; a mailing list anyway.

fair enough.

&gt; &gt; I do object somewhat to getting .doc
&gt; &gt; format mail, but again, I have to deal with it becuase I
&gt; receive it all the
&gt; &gt; time.
&gt;
&gt; OK, then you will choose a reader that copes with this, and accept any
&gt; limitations that might result.  That's fine.   Note however, that your
&gt; reader will cope with messages I can read easily, but the obverse is
&gt; not true.

yes.

well, that was productive.
