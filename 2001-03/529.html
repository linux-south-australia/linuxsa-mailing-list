&gt;Though I understand this, I still wonder how the ISPs in the US manage

Their cost structure is different. Very different.

Consider these differences:

- cross-country bandwidth an order of magnitude cheaper than 
Australia (because, mainly, they have a population an order of 
magnitude larger, justifying not a few, but -many-, national, 
competitive, fibre networks - and every few hundred miles, there's a 
large city, and every several hundred there is a city larger than 
Melbourne). Cost models for laying fibre that are marginal here are 
no-brainers there. The marginal cost of long haul bandwidth in the 
USA is getting laughably low. Domestic haulage is a dominant cost in 
Australia and a trivial one in the USA.

- The US is where the Internet started. By historical side effect 
which (posturing by the Australian Federal Government a year ago not 
withstanding) isn't changing any time soon, this results in the 
following situation:

	- any country wanting to plug into the Internet has to pay 
for 100% of the costs of getting to the USA. That's 100% of the cost 
of the undersea fibre or satellite channels between their country and 
the USA.

	Hence every other country in the world is paying their own 
way to reach the USA, and with rare exceptions, the USA gets a free 
ride on all of those gigabits per second in the other direction.


The financial impacts of this are massive. In the voice phone call 
regime, carriers implement a concept called a 'half circuit' where 
they pay 'sort of' half each for the transit between countries. But 
that system never got extended to Internet links (or data haulage in 
general) - and attempts to do so hit the brick wall of 'well, we 
don't care, if you want to play, pay to come to us, you don't -have- 
to talk to the Internet, do you?'.

The 'half circuit' system is also starting to show signs of breaking 
down, for reasons beyond the scope of this message.

- there is a working peering structure in the USA. If you're large, 
or even medium sized, you can expect to get a lot of your traffic by 
peering (netural cost or cost-difference based exchange of traffic 
with your neighbours in-city,in-state and in-country).

The ACCC in this country tried to force Telstra to stop maintaining a 
commercial situation 100% stacked against any such peering in this 
country. It half succeeded, and now there is an unofficial cartel of 
four major national backbones in Australia, which peer with each 
other on a zero cost basis, but all steadfastly refuse to let anyone 
else into the club.

Unfortunately the ACCC felt that this was a sufficient correction to 
the original anti-competitive situation (having issued the first 
'competition notice' in history to force Telstra to blink). They did 
half the job here, and the other half looks as far away as ever right 
now.

- while in-state peering has succeeded in some states (notably 
including South Australia), national peering, through multiple 
attempts, has failed to work so far, due to the consequences of my 
very first point above (intra-state data charges being too high), the 
effectice of which are so severe that it's now far more expensive to 
move Internet data from Sydney to Adelaide than it is from San 
Francisco to Sydney.

- Australian customers ask their ISP's to match *US* pricing numbers 
for 'net access, i.e. if they see a US ISP offering $19.95 all you 
can eat, they want the same thing here. But that's $19.95 US, and 
they want to pay $19.95 Australian. Taken a look at the exchange rate 
lately? !!! That's the equivalent of selling that US customer the 
same thing for US$9.95!

i.e. the nett effect is that on average, IMHO, an Australian ISP is 
providing a service about twice as cost effectively to their 
customers as their US counterpart - and is correspondingly LESS 
profitable and less able to expand than their US breathren.

What's happening is the effect others have already noted, where one 
or a few ISP's (sometimes major ones) set a price point based on US 
expectations, get swamped with customers, ride along for a while, 
telling themselves that the losses they're making will be fixed with 
higher volumes of sales (!) and fall over - leaving only the 
unrealistic customer expectations to swamp the next-most-mad ISP.

I'm in the USA right now on a research trip, and conversations with 
some national service providers here indicates that the price 
routinely offered to an ISP's customers (NOT the US wholesale rate, 
the 'retail' one) is of the order of half the best possible, high 
volume, high spend, high commitment rate that it is possible to pay 
for upstream supply in Australia today, as a consequence of all of 
the above.

The best price one can pay on a wholesale rate in the USA per megabit 
per second is so low as to make me want to weep.

In the words of David Bowie, "THIS IS NOT AMERICA".

'you've got it easy' - think for a moment about those in third world 
countries where the effective cost per MB is in the dollars per MB 
range because their economic situation is, in turn, an order of 
magnitude worse than the Australian one, and two orders worse than 
the USA. And ISP's in those countries _still_ have their customers 
wanting twenty bucks all-you-can-eat - I'm sure of that :)

Cheers,
Simon
