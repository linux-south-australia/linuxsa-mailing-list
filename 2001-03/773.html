&gt; Spoken like a naive newbie.  Not that I'm accusing you of being either
&gt; naive or a newbie, it's just that the way you claim a bug having given
&gt; no relevant details leaves that impression.
&gt;

hmm...thanks david for that positive reply :)
i am not claiming a bug, i am passing on information which
i thought some people on the list would find interesting.

perhaps you should refrain from judging people on the list
and keep personal opinions to yourself. i am not claiming to be an
expert, nor an advanced user of linux (im neither) even though i have been  
using linux for a few years now. (it would be nice :) )

it disappoints me to see messages like these on lists, why create an
environment where a user (eg advanced or [newbie]) is looked down upon
over umm lets see an "impression" which is supported by one email?
i'm sorry that i did not include more details regarding the bug so i will
do so now...

it seems that the 2.4 kernel doesn't handle an 'out of memory' situation
correctly or very well as with 2.4.2 the kernel outputs an error
"_alloc_page: 1-order allocation failed" repeatedly and then kills other
active processes such as xfs and bash with "Out of Memory: Killed process
###" for example.

I was told of this problem by a friend who is a kernel developer, but
to further inform those who replied to my earlier messages: kernel
developers have acknowledged the problem - however they are expecting      
admins to make use of the process limiting configurations as john edwards
was describing earlier.

everything would seem ok, but! it would be interesting to see what would
happen if somebody connected say 10,000 times to fingerd (the same problem
would most likely occur as fingerd forks as far as i am aware?)

the following url contains a more detailed explanation:

i hope this email helped to clarify things..

cheers
