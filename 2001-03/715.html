Yeah - but most of it - IMHO - is complete rubbish.  I have been without a television - I sold it for a good meal at a cafe - for perhaps 6 months now.

And GOD the peace is bliss!

I am not interested in Pay TV, DVD, etc - I have had more than my fill of corporatised and Americanised brain washing. My partner wants to listen to Czech radio and watch Czech television - she wants to talk to people and her family in her native language in her native country and not pay exhorbitant phone rates for this.  We were really hoping ADSL would offer this.

I want to listen to other radio stations from around the world and listen to LOCAL music from around the world and not be afforded a generous download 'cap'.

It is about CHOICE.

And I am just so pissed off that after years of promising by Senator Alston and his mob that we will have it one day - that we were insulted with these prices after a 7 year wait or whatever it was (no offence to re-seller ISPs - it is the backbone provider/s I am pissed off with).

Not to mention that even India and many countries that we used to laugh at are now laughing at us for our backwardness.

I met a Rwandan (from Central Africa) that was AMAZED how backward we are - and this is not just compared to just European and North American countries.

Australia - my friends - is not going anywhere fast - and this does not help.

It is no co-incidence that India is churning out programmers by the thousands - while we still think wheat and wool and steel are the path to propserity.

And this bullshit is supposed to get us marching forth in to the future.

Get real.

&gt;I thought the whole idea was to receive DATA. There are plenty of cheaper
&gt;ways already devised to listen to radio or watch films, curiously known as
&gt;Radios, TV's and Cinemas. In fact, if you walk down to the video shop, you
&gt;can download a whopping 5 Gigs [1] of entertainment content to your house
&gt;for as little as $3 (as long as you upload it again the next day) :)
