&gt; &gt; This is not a technical list.  It's a party attended by people with a
&gt; &gt; common technological interest.  Your suggestion completely overlooks
&gt; &gt; that.  Most of what we do is noise, and often interesting noise at that.
&gt; &gt; Your guide leaves the impression that the list must only be used for
&gt; &gt; linux and open source related messages, and we have never behaved in
&gt; &gt; that restricted way before.  I don't think we want to start now.

I recognise this, but it was 2am when I stopped typing. I agree with you
entirely. The guide is completely incomplete. Or something like that.

&gt; Now a set of formalised etiquette rules comes up from time to time
&gt; in every mailing list.
&gt; People who write these things seem to think that there is a single
&gt; set of universal values which we can all subscribe to.

I don't think that. I don't think that what I wrote is particularly
restrictive or anything... it's more a HOWTO use LinuxSA to your best
advantage.

&gt; Cultural and value system relativism is part of reality, like
&gt; dirt, death and germs.
&gt; There's no cure for it.
&gt; Tolerance is good. Authoritarianism is bad.
&gt; And this is universally true.

Yes.

&gt; But should we tolerate authoritarianism?
&gt;
&gt; I think that if one does not like a club, there are plenty more
&gt; clubs on the Internet.

Well, that goes for authoritarian ones as well... if you personally don't
tolerate the authoritarianism that you find somewhere, you go somewhere
else... Not that that applies at all here. I'm just pointing it out :)
