&gt;&gt;Crap.  We've already discussed this on the list.  Adding "w1" to your
&gt;&gt;init string is how it's done *for your modem* but not for every modem.
&gt; 
&gt; Well I didn't know that... and I remember asking this question on this list 
&gt; a while back and not getting an answer, so I thought well I would post the 
&gt; answer...

Of course you didn't realise that.  You wouldn't have said it had you
known it was wrong.  I know that that you were trying to post useful
information.  I was not being sarcastic when I said that I was delighted
that you had found the answer to your problem.  You researched the
answer to your problem and came up with a solution, which is wonderful.
I wish everybody would try to emulate that.

I'm surprised that it never occurred to you to read your modem manual,
and if you had done so you would have gleaned the answer a long time ago.
I can imagine that you might have no idea of how your modem and computer
communicate, other than in general terms like "serial" and "bits".  If you
read your manual you will learn about AT commands, and carrier-loss times,
and all sorts of other useful information.  Why wouldn't you read every
manual as a matter of course?  At least skim through it so you have some
feeling for what it is that is being described.

I get so frustrated when people say, "I didn't read the manual; how could
I have known?" or "I haven't got time to read every manual," or worst of
all, "Why should I read the manual when I can get the answer to a simple
question by asking the list."  Not that I'm accusing you of any of these,
far less that terribly selfish last attitude.  I have seen all of these
miserable excuses offered before.  The message I am trying to convey,
and I do realise I'm fighting a losing battle, but it seems to me to be
a noble one, is that reading the manual is not optional.  You MUST do it.



&gt; I was not trying to delude others, I was merely offering this information 
&gt; because someone else might have the same problem and they might want to try 
&gt; this.

Nobody said you were trying to delude others, just as Pauline Hanson
didn't try to give the impression that Australia is a country run by
racists.  It's tragic that, with the best of intentions, results can go
awfully wrong.  This is why I highlighted your error.  I regret saying
"Crap," because that was an antagonistic way of putting it.  On the other
hand, please understand I was referring to your advice, or rather the
claim of it's general applicability.  My comment was explicitly limited
to your advice, and in no way intended to reflect on you personally.


&gt; I would be curious to see how many peoples NORMAL run of the mill, CURRENT 
&gt; off the shelf modems would work the same as mine using the w1 command.

I don't know what you imagine a "NORMAL" modem is, but I fancy you think
it's one that has the same command set as your own.  Put in those terms,
does it strike you to be an overly rose-coloured view of the world?
What about "CURRENT"?  Do you mean newer than six months old?  When does
it become "not-current?"  How about four years?  The Australian Taxation
Office lets you write a computer off in under three years; so surely
four years is in no way current?  How many people, do you suppose, run
Linux on a computer older than that?  Are we intending to disenfranchise
people with older equipment?  I hope not.

&gt; I do not wish to turn this into a slinging match, as has already been done 
&gt; by a couple of others replying to this topic, I merely wanted to defend my 
&gt; view point. :)

Nobody did; it just happened.  But you should explain rather than defend
your view point: What you said was incorrect and does not warrant defense.
You intended good but got it wrong.  No crime in that.  Just say, "thank
you for correcting me," and move on.
