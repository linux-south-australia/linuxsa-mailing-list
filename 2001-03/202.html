Hi,
I'm lucky enough, (maybe), to have an iPrimus ADSL connection at my
abode in Sydney.
I've just got back from Adelaide, & I'm starting to look at some
performance issues with it.
I've noticed most Australian sites, when pinged, give 10-30% packet
loss.

I get the same sort of results using a P133 96MB box running OS/2 as a
Celeron 433 64MB running W2k, &lt;grin&gt;.
Because of this, I'm inclined to suspect some infrastructure
mis-configuration.

Note the dialup tests aren't much better for iPrimus, but Dialix are
perfect.

Whilst the test was done at a peak time, similar results are obtained at
other times, like 4:00, 6:00, 10:00.

I'm looking to lodge a complaint with iPrimus over this one, ADSL is
supposed to be a premium service, but with this sort of packet loss, it
definitely isn't.

I'd like to make make sure I'm informed about the implications about
this much packet loss, before I go in guns blazing.

I know definitely that a lot of web-based email sites like
<A HREF="http://www.runbox.com">http://www.runbox.com</A> don't work with this much packet loss.

Would people like to comment on this amount of packet loss?
