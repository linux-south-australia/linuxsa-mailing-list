&gt;I note that ISPs are generally charging more for the faster connections --
&gt;eg 512K vs 1500K -- but you get the same MB cap, and I assume everything
&gt;else is the same... Is there a cost difference in providing these? Is it in
&gt;the modem, the equipment at the exchange, or the link from the exchange to
&gt;support the potential extra bandwidth? Personally, I'd love to have
1.5Mbps,
&gt;and particuarly the higher uplink speeds, but wouldn't use many more MB in
&gt;total if I were to have it... Where is the cost here? Or is it mainly
&gt;marketing (which IMHO, is fine, if a little irritating to people like me :)

Interestingly enough, Telstra's own ADSL spec calls for modems capable of
6Mb/s, which includes the Alcatel units they're handing out now. This
probably has something to do with the interactive-tv stuff that they've been
planning since 1990.

Faster speeds can also create a premium product, so the marketers have
something to do, and the business has some chance of making a profit before
the market crumbles into $19.95/month mode.

Getting back to the unlimited arguement, if an ISP is charging for usage
instead of the pipe, it's in their interest to have the fastest pipe to the
customer that is possible. This is not only so they can sell more usage, but
it also means that the ISP won't have to pay for data that is never
delivered to the customer if their link is flooded for some reason. In an
experiment years ago with one ISP, they tried locking the serial ports on
their 28K modems down to 19.2K in an effort to stretch a 128K link a bit
further, and found that they actually used MORE data because of all of the
retransmited data that never made it to customers.

Obviously there is also a quality-of-service issue with the bandwidth
supplied to the exchange and the ISP's own network, but you get what you pay
for. Like I said earlier today, if you only ever download a few megs a day,
it's going to be difficult for the ISP to plan capacity for the time you
want to download a couple of gigs.

Another factor is that Telstra requires ATM or Frame tails to their exchange
so expensive that it's not cost-effective to use an ADSL link for dedicated
bandwidth - it's a similar price to buy the same tail direct to your
business with a better reliability.

RequestDSL were planning to arrive in Adelaide next month. In Victoria
they've presented at a peering exchange, which makes tail costs a minor
issue for most ISP's. Let's hope they do the same here.
