Greetings,

I would like some suggestions and feedback on what people would like
to see in a community Linux course.

Endeavour college (Mawson Lakes) is running computing courses in the
evenings, starting in term 2. (I'll have to go and look the start date up :-)
Currently these are for Microsoft Applications, running on their PC's.

I have spoken to the organiser of these, and there is the possibility
of running a Linux or 'Linux' application course.

The other courses are in the order of $60 for 8 hours.
(1 night a week over 4 weeks)

The options are: 

1. Configfest [ May be the most helpful for Linux Community ] 
   - Bring your machine along and let us help you get the most out of it.

2. Starting with Linux
   - Use Sarah B's installing Linux mini-howto to install and configure linux.
 
3. Using Applications under Linux [ Very Basic ]
   - Netscape
   - Star Office

People would have to bring in their own machines, and this would be
reflected in a reduced cost of the course.  This may fit in nicely, if
the same night is used for another computer class.  (There are other
rooms available.)

What would be really neat though would be to have a bootable CD, which
could setup the machines as 'diskless' clients from a server.  The we
could superimpose a linux network over their windows boxes.
  
I'm resonable confident that this could be done.  Has anyone tried this?
