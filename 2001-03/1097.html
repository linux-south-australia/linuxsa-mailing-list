Hi -- I whipped this up as a proposal that I think we should adopt (although
I don't know how an amorphous blob of people goes about adopting anything,
but anyway). It's all IMHO, but I'd quite like it to be LinuxSA's HO. It
still needs work, and I'd suggest that it should be turned into a FAQ,
really... Whatever -- if I get something started, maybe someone else will
volunteer to take it over and do it properly when they're not tired and etc
like I am now.

Feel free to add to or disagree with anything here.


----------------------------------------------
Unofficial LinuxSA Etiquette Guide.

1. About LinuxSA and the List

LinuxSA was started in 1996 as an informal Linux User Group aiming "To
promote and support Linux in South Australia". Presently, the mailing list
has around 400 subscribers, including people from Adelaide, Rural SA,
interstate and overseas. These people vary wildly in their ages (from high
school and possibly younger up to retirees), level of experience (guru
hacker types down to "what's a Linux?" newbies), gender, race, sexuality,
vocation, socio-economic grouping, level of English literacy, intelligence,
and so on. The only thing that all subscribers can be assumed to have in
common is an interest in Linux (and/or *BSD and other Free and Open Source
Software). However, even this interest varies -- some see Linux as a
religion, some see it as the enemy, some see it as a sideline, some as a
hobby, and some just as a means to an end. Whatever the case, this list
forms part of the unnoficial support network for Linux in SA. People come
here looking for help, and if you want to promote Linux in SA, particularly
in Businesses, then helping them is the best way to go about it.

2. Posting

When posting, bear in mind that the list is a public forum, with many people
who don't have much in common with yourself. To help facilitate effective
communication (ooh, now I feel like a PHB), LinuxSA has in place a very
sophisticated moderation system. It's called the LinuxSA Voluntary
Self-Moderation System (or LSAVSMS for short). It works like this: Before
posting something, re-read it and moderate as follows:

Generally:
1. Is it in HTML. Make it not so -- plain text is preferred by many.
2. Do you have line wrap turned off -- turn it on... it irritates some
readers, and makes the web archive hard to read.
3. Is it insulting, or a flame? Don't send it. This includes condescension,
harsh sarcasm, accusation of stupidity, and personal attacks. LinuxSA
doesn't need them, so please don't send them.
4. Is the subject line relevant to the subject matter, and specific enough
to be userful? "A Question" is not useful. Nor is "No Subject" or "".
5. Is it signal or noise? Signal is good, noise is bad. Noise doesn't add
anything to the list, and serves only to camoflage the signal. A post is
generally good if it causes (or enables) you or someone else to learn
something or fix something. Most Anti-MS jokes have been done before, and
aren't worth sending to the list, especially if that's the whole content of
your post. Be aware that some people on the list may be MS weenies...
6. Has the subject matter been covered before? Check the archives. Will
bringing it up again really add anything other than traffic to the list?
7. If you're responding to a flame or insult, take it with a pinch of salt,
and try to let it slide -- flaming trolls doesn't really help anyone.

If your post is a techical question:
1. Have you RTFM? If not, then either go do so, or say you haven't, and why
not -- maybe you don't know where to look, or you've been looking and still
don't get it -- that's fine, say so.
2. Have you specified the question clearly? "How do I get GNOME to work?" is
not a good question. Include whatever is relevant -- Hardware specs (CPU,
RAM)Distribution, revision, kernel, any customisations, versions of the
software you are using, what shell you are running it under, what the error
or problem is, and what you have tried. If there are a few obvious solutions
that you have tried, mention them. It makes you look like less of a newbie,
and prevents people from telling you what you already know.
3. If you are a newbie to the subject matter of your email, feel free to
state so. It helps people tailor their response to you.

If your post is a response to a technical question:
1. If it's not polite, it's not useful. Insulting someone because they asked
(or answered) a question is not conducive to helping them learn.
2. If you have a reference (URL or whatever), mention it. Other people can
then go check it and often will learn more that way.
3. If your response is basically RTFM, at least point the person in the
direction of TFM. A URL to TFM or something to search for "Check the 'HOW-TO
frobnicate' document" is helpful, "RTFM" is not. If someone is new, they may
not be aware of HOW-TOs or man pages or RFCs or whatever. Just be aware of
this when responding.
4. Generally, whatever solution you have is not neccessarily the only or the
best way to do it. As the Perl guys say, TMTOWTDI. No matter how good or
experienced you are, there's always someone who can think of a different way
that in some cases may be better. So put on the humble hat.

If your post is a plug or advertisement:
1. prefix the subject line wiht "[ADD]" or "[PLUG]".
2. Go easy on the promotion -- only promote things that are relevant to
Linux users, and don't do it too much, or people get irritable.


Basically, write in a considerate, helpful manner, and we can all get along
fine, just fine.
