&gt; &gt; "Tony Gunthorp at VA Linux showed me something very impressive: he killed
&gt; &gt; the power on his Linux laptop (without doing a clean shutdown - blasphemy!)
&gt; &gt; and when rebooting the filesystem rebuilt itself within seconds with zero
&gt; &gt; errors. The reboot skipped right past fsck.ext2,"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Has anyone on the list tried this? (the URL above has lots of tips and
&gt; &gt; caveats, but is about 12 months old, so no doubt things have moved along a
&gt; &gt; bit)
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. It works very well. I haven't tried it on a 2.4 kernel, but 2.2
&gt; works very well (our mail servers, file servers and soon our proxy
&gt; server all enjoy reiserfs partitions). 

Great. I had been thinking that thie reiserfs was too experimental to
use for all partitions. 
Is it available in SuSE installation scripts as an option alongside
ext2fs? If so, it seems like ext2fs will eventually be replaced by reiserfs,
unless there's something lacking in reiserfs.

So my plan now is to get a UPS, get an old Pentium, install a brand new OS
(with 2.4.0 kernel), set up all the firewall/server stuff. 
And then I have two lines of defence: the UPS _and_ the file system.

But then what do I do with the other 5 computers?
I guess they're less at risk because they don't continuously generate
log files. 
It seems to be only the files which are currently open for writing
which are candidates for very nasty destruction when the power goes off.
And a firewall/server (mine at least) has dozens of such log files.
So probably I'll be fairly safe if I just defend the 
gateway=firewall+server computer.

Anyway, now it's time to go out and get a UPS.
Jaycar don't have them anymore in Adealide, by the way....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
