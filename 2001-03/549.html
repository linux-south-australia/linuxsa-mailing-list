Robert,

Someone told me off-list that maybe some sort of Pentium bug-fix
would have been in the installation software, and that this might
be incompatible with the Cyrix.
Probably this would depend on exactly how SuSE built their
installation kernel.

I'm so tired of spending 1-2 weeks on things that should
take 1-2 minutes that I've just returned the Cyrix board
(for a miserable $50 refund) and bought an AMD K6-2/500
CPU + board instead.
The new CPU+mainboard works perfectly.
Not a single problem.
And even on an el cheapo monitor where I'm running
640x480 8-bit pixels, the desktops (a dozen of them)
look rather good.

Just about everything to do with computers has a knack of
working 99%, and I spend 99% of my time fixing that last 1%.

Anyway, I won't be buying any more Cyrix CPUs.
I didn't even realise I was buying this one. I certainly did
not _want_ a Cyrix. So now I've paid $100 or so to learn that
they are indeed dodgy chips - for SuSE 7.1 linux anyway.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
