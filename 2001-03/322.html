Some thoughts on USP choice of brand....
-------------------------------------

Yep. The time is nigh.
I've got to decide on a UPS brand.
And from the numerous helpful hints provided by
people on this list, and info from phone calls round town
to distributors, wholesalers and resellers, and even more info
from web-sites overseas and linux UPS software authors,
I am now in a position to say that I don't know which brand to buy.


Here's an inadequate summary of what I've found, from the point of
view of someone who wants to do it all in linux (as an exercise in
neo-crypto-minimalism, the hair shirt and all that), has a
server/firewall [1] and a bevy of workstations, wants to watch
the pennies, wants open source software, wants the flexibility to
make detailed decisions of which machines to shut down on the
basis of how much power is left etc. etc. etc.

SOLA [== Best Power]:
+	They have provided their interface spec to developers,
	in particular to Russell Kroll et alia for creating
	linux software (NUT [2]).
+	Lower price than APC, I've heard.
	About 30% cheaper for roughly equivalent units.
+	Made in Australia, and lots of other people use it.
-	Gives a medium amount of info on the UPS status,
	compared to some other brands.
-	Some people say that there are reliability problems
	or cable confusion problems.

APC:
+	Sophisticated control/status interface.
+	Good linux software is available (NUT).
+	Very widely used world-wide.
+	Has quite good reputation for reliability.
+	Has lots of options for extra batteries, e.g. to 42 hours.
-	Keeps the interface spec to itself, but some people
	have reverse engineered the interface to produce good
	linux software for it.

Nikko [== Powercom]:
+	Good software (?), but not open source.
+	Sounds like good value for money.
-	The wholesaler doesn't seem to be able to answer
	questions on this - sent me to reseller, who sent me
	back to the wholesaler.
-	No support by NUT software.


============================================================
So now it looks like SOLA and APC are in the lead, and the APC is
looking slightly better, on the basis that it have a richer interface
and better control options. But it costs 30% more.
(E.g. $1100 for the APC 1000VA unit I want as opposed to $800 for
the roughly equivalent SOLA unit.)

Can anyone tell me if I'm going astray here?
Is there anything additional I should know?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

[1] Please don't waste time telling me that servers and firewalls
must be on separate machines. As Larry Wall said, ``There's more than
one way to do it.'' And I'm doing it the other way....

[2] NUT is at:
<A HREF="http://www.exploits.org/nut/">http://www.exploits.org/nut/</A>

PS. When I phoned Dick SMith's, they told me for about 5-10 minutes
about the Magellan brand, but they guy couldn't find the VA rating.
It emerged later that these were _GPS_ units.
