&gt;Crap.  We've already discussed this on the list.  Adding "w1" to your
&gt;init string is how it's done *for your modem* but not for every modem.

Well I didn't know that... and I remember asking this question on this list 
a while back and not getting an answer, so I thought well I would post the 
answer...

&gt;I'm delighted that you have spent ten minutes or read your modem manual
&gt;and discovered how to make it report the connect speed,

I did not read my modem manual, I actually found a referenece to some other 
person on a web page using PPPD and wanting the same as I did.

&gt;but please do
&gt;not delude others into believing it works for all modems.  It doesn't
&gt;and you do a disservice by implying otherwise.

I was not trying to delude others, I was merely offering this information 
because someone else might have the same problem and they might want to try 
this.

I would be curious to see how many peoples NORMAL run of the mill, CURRENT 
off the shelf modems would work the same as mine using the w1 command.

I do not wish to turn this into a slinging match, as has already been done 
by a couple of others replying to this topic, I merely wanted to defend my 
view point. :)

Regards,

Michael
