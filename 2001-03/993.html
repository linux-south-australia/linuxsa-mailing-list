&gt; &gt; Frankly I believe David's responses to this thread indicate his unwillingness to act
&gt; &gt; in a manner that is suitable for all levels of users on this list.  It is also my
&gt; &gt; belief that until he does so LinuxSA will not grow or nurture new users in a manner
&gt; &gt; the community of LinuxSA  users deserve.
&gt;
&gt; Tiddly winks and solid turds. We might dispense with a few newbies who
&gt; can't cope with seeing the truth being told. Be warned! TURN OFF THE
&gt; X-FILES!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; His words speak volumes.
&gt;
&gt; No. The original post was not up to standard, and so low as to allow
&gt; some to believe it is crap. I hate to point this out, but indicating
&gt; something is crap is a single fact - it doesn't speak voluemes.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And thanks for all the private mail too people, I will note give up on this,
&gt; &gt; LinuxSA deserves better
&gt;
&gt; lol
&gt;
&gt; So Michael has managed to create yet another flame war. He seems to be
&gt; better than me. Was that what he was trying to achieve? I think he was.
&gt; He has succeeded. But, s far as the original statement he made, it is,
&gt; will be, will continue to be wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Do I make my point?
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, would SOMEONE mention the blasted Nazis? I'm getting bored
&gt; of this thread....

&gt;  To glance behind
&gt;  The Phantom of the Opera is there...
&gt;  Inside your mind!
