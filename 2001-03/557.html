&gt;  &gt; Once happy day I decided to make experiment and connect one company with 2mb
&gt;  &gt; link for US$48 per month instead of 32k for US$60. To my financial managers
&gt;  &gt; it looks like I got crazy but I overruled them and started such link as
&gt;  &gt; experiment. First few days I saw incredible traffic (almost up to given
&gt;  &gt; bandwidth) but then activity ceased just to average of 16k. I visited the
&gt;  &gt; company where we installed this link and asked them about why they ceased
&gt;  &gt; their downloads and got very obvious answer: "We ran out of disk space".
&gt;

So what, in all walks of life we have abuse, it's part of natures plan  to make
people different. I have spoken to lots of people involved with ISP's and  sure
some of them have abusers, the MAJORITY of people do not.  So what you are
proposing is that because a few abuse X we all should pay the same price (and not
just financially).  You really want to read carefully what you are implying.

Governments, Military and Fundamentalists of all parts of the world have used the
very same argument.  e.g. because of  this minority doing and abusing "X" we have
decided that you are all the same and  "X" will no longer be available.
Shit why don't we remove the right to vote and free speech, because some people
abuse it by complaining about it, and some don't use it, and others use it to
lambast 'free-speech' bla bla bla and so on.

&gt;
&gt; In Australia that isn't an impediment.  I've spoken to people here who use
&gt; their "Unlimited" plans to play a game between themselves:  They have races
&gt; to see who can fill up their hard disks first.
&gt;
&gt; Once it's full they delete it and start again.  "Best of three?"

&gt;
&gt; There's no disincentive for them doing something that stupid, because
&gt; the traffic isn't actually costing them anything.  Meanwhile their ISP
&gt; is paying for each megabyte they download (either directly through a
&gt; volume-charged wholesale link, or indirectly through a dollars-per-megabit
&gt; link).
&gt;

Disincentive, yeah right, so you are happy with a world of  "disincentives"   you
sound more like a scientoloigist than a rational thinking human being.
"disincentives"- ba humbug...

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Unlimited traffic - it's just good for advertisment because most people
&gt;  &gt; associate it with their freedom to download something but actually they even
&gt;  &gt; don't need it :)
&gt;
&gt; It also removes any sense of responsibility whatsoever.  Despite the
&gt; impressions of people on "unlimited" plans, bandwidth isn't an unlimited
&gt; commodity.  Wastefulness is expensive.
&gt;

Give me a break, want to know what I think Mark, I think you are speaking the
employer speak, you have not the faintest clue about, or interest in, real issues
and are simply justifying a business point (model) and using a weak argument to
boot.

Last and not least, do YOU have a dingoblue account and how many 'enlightened'
'megabit-conscious-bandwidth-saving' work colleagues of yours have one too?

And if you do,weeeeeellllllll,  maybe its because you are more responsible than us,
and therefore deserve it, and once we reach enlightenment and the fifth level of
Karma we will be worthy..

bah...
