Hello David,

&gt; But that's not what he said, is it?  He said that w1 *will* work for
&gt; you, too.  That was what I criticised, and I believe I did so clearly and

Senario;
So I am a linux newbie, I see Michael's advice and put the w1 in my modem's
init string, and when I try it, it either works or it doesn't.
If it doesn't do you think I am going to jump up and down, and accuse
Michael of mis-leading me, burn him at the stake, maybe I should sue him,
phewk.  - I'll remove the w1 and get on with my life.
Alternatively, if the w1 works, I will be happily suprised, probably send
Michael an e-mail saying thanks for his suggestion, unlike others who
wouldn't share their findings.

Hey Michael, you where right, the w1 did work for me too, and probably many
users others too.

Wayne




&gt;
&gt; &gt; Just because one user, who has a small amount of knowledge tries to help
and
&gt; &gt; offer suggestions to another, gives no justification for "experts" to
accuse
&gt; &gt; a helper of being a bloody idiot if they are not 100% correct.
&gt;
&gt; Did I do that?  I don't think so.  I said, "crap!" which clearly referred
&gt; to the suggestion about w1; and equally clearly did not refer to the
&gt; person who made the suggestion.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I was never after any points in the first place, I just don't see the
&gt; &gt; benefit of raming it down someone's throat if they are not 100% correct.
The
&gt; &gt; majority of silent users appreciate the many small helpful comments a
lot
&gt; &gt; more than the bagging comments made by the odd member.
&gt;
&gt; How many of these silent users appreciate being misdirected?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe when someone is wrong, users correcting them can be a little more
&gt; &gt; suttle about it and not so accusing!
&gt;
&gt; I have just one more thing to say to you: There's a Bee in subtle.
