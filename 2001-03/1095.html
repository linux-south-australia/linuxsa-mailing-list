&gt; &gt;&gt; It's a basic recipe that you'll find use for over and over again.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I may be missing something obvious here, but what exactly is
&gt; the advantage
&gt; &gt; of the script-on-one-line approach?
&gt;
&gt; At fear of repeating myself, it's a basic recipe that you'll find
&gt; use for over
&gt; and over again.  (It also doesn't use a paginator as a heading

well thanks, david, but what I asked was why isn't the "more * &gt; file" also
a "basic recipe"? Seems more basic -- almost not a recipe... but it acheives
pretty much the same thing, as far as I can see.

&gt; generator, which
&gt; seems more elegant to me.)

ok, so what you're saying is that there is no practical difference apart
from the fact that you prefer to roll your own headings rather than have
"more" generate them for you?

I could imagine that there could be differences in the way `cat` and `more`
deal with special characters, like say ^M and ^H, but I don't know this...
Also, perhaps it's got more to do with more being interactive, and trying to
paginate when it's going into a file. But if it acheives the same, and is
more obvious, less prone to error, and has no disadvantages (apart from
elegance, which I do value when it's practical), then I don't see the
difference...
