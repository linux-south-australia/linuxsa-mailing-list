 &gt; Seriously though, where does the $/Mb get introduced into the equation

Ok, a history lesson.

In the beginning there was AARNet, owned by the universities.  Charge
was kinda-sorta by pipe size, but the pipes were small by today's 
standards and upgrading the network was an expensive proposition.  
There was much discussion about how to deal with this;  Volume charging
was one alternative.

After much debate, volume charging was actually implemented.  Then,
shortly afterwards, AARNet sold their network operation to Telstra,
who named it "Big Pond Direct" and ran it as a commercial entity.  The
wholesale rate for megabytes was 19c, pay as you go.

Telstra was the only game in town for quite a while.  connect.com.au 
also had a trans-pacific link, and they volume-charged too.  It made
sense, really:  In a duopoly, to compete with your opposition, the most
profitable course of action is to deliver a price point which is
ever-so-slightly below theirs, without cutting off all your options
by going as low as you can go from day one.  So connect.com.au charged
18c/Mbyte for international traffic and about 14c/Mbyte (from memory)
for domestic traffic, ostensibly on the expectation that Telstra would
lower their wholesale price in response to the competition.

That response never came.  It didn't matter in the end, because 
connect.com.au couldn't make enough money out of their international
link to keep it viable, so they basically resold Telstra's megabytes.

Other operators arriving in the Australian marketplace saw the way
that business was done, and did basically what connect.com.au did
all those years ago:  Why rock the boat?  Why not just set a wholesale
price per megabyte just like everyone else?

It's only comparatively recently that fixed-price-per-unit-bandwidth
links have been available on the Australian wholesale market; But they
have an effective cost per megabyte anyway.  If you're paying, say, 
$20,000 per month for 1 megabit per second (as Dave Edwards postulated
earlier), you need to think about the number of megabytes you can
squeeze into that link -- A 1 Mbps link does a megabyte every ten
seconds at 100% utilization, so you get about 260 Gbytes per 30 days; 
In practice you will only achieve about 70% utilization, so that's
about 180 Gbytes.  $20000 for 180,000 Mbytes works out to about 11c/Mbyte,
so there's your effective cost per megabyte.

[ and if you have a quiet month over Christmas and only draw 100 Gbytes,
  the effective cost per megabyte jumps to $0.20 -- you'd be better off
  buying at retail rates from Telstra, the most expensive provider in the
  country... except you don't find out about that until after you've had
  your quiet month, when it's too late to change! ]

So why do people think fixed-price links are so much cheaper than volume
charged links?  No idea.  A link is a link is a link;  if you use it you
pay for it.  Any transit over any link can be reduced to some number of
cents per megabyte anyway, and in practice that figure isn't a whole lot
cheaper than commonly available volume-charged wholesale rates.

There is one enormous benefit that a volume-charged regime has, though,
in terms of network performance.

Let's say I have a customer who needs to download 180 Gbytes in a month.
I *know* that I can carry that customer's traffic with one of the
wholesale links described above and they'll be happy with it;  But there's
no room for growth there:  If they do their 180 Gbytes/month the link will
be congested to hell and back.  And what if they have a busy month and
want to do 250 Gbytes instead?

The advantage of a volume-charged regime is that it isn't bandwidth
dependent.  So I could go to a wholesale provider and strike up an 
11 c/Mbyte deal, then connect to that provider with a 4 Mbps link
instead of a 1 Mbps link.  The result?  I have a link which is about 20%
congested instead of 70% congested.  If my customer does 180 Gbytes in
a month it'll end up costing me the same amount that it'd have cost on
a fixed-price service.  And if they want to do 250 Gbytes, the capacity
is there to carry them.  And if they only want 100 Gbytes, I only pay
$11,000 for the month instead of $20,000.

I'm happy because I don't have to pay extra to my wholesale provider to
increase my link bandwidth to them.  My wholesale provider is happy 
because whenever I upgrade my link I'm also upgrading my capacity to
draw traffic from them at 11c/Mbyte, so they make more money.  And my
customer is happy because they get the capacity they need, with enough
headroom to do other stuff if they want it too.

In practice, links charged by bandwidth provide ISPs with an incentive
to buy the slowest (i.e., cheapest) links they can get away with, and
then congest them like buggary so they can get as many megabytes as
possible through them for monthly amount they've paid.  Links charged
by volume give ISPs an incentive to install the fastest links they can
afford, with the knowledge that they don't need to pay for the
extra perfomance unless they use it (and if they're volume-charging
their customers, they'll have sufficient revenue to pay for it when
that happens). 

So it's not beyond the realms of possibility to put a 10 or 100 Mbps link
into an upstream provider even though you only intend to pull a few
megabits per second through it;  If you ever want to draw more than
a few megabits per second, the capacity will be there to carry it;  your
customers will never, ever complain that the reason they get shitty
performance is because of *your* link to the Internet.

This all makes perfect sense.  It sucks if you expect to have an ADSL
link which costs $80 per month with no traffic limits, but it's perfect
if you want scalable, high performance infrastructure, where your ISP
isn't your bottleneck, and where congestion generally isn't a problem
anywhere on the various backbones which make up the Australian portion
of the Internet.
