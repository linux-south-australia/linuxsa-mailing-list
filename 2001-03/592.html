Listen, Stephen.  This whole conversation is based on your assertion that
bandwidth is so fundamentally cheap that offering unlimited quantities of
it for $30 per month is a rational and profitable way for a business to
behave.

You are wrong.  Totally wrong.  There is no doubt about it, no questions
asked, no room for debate or doubt, no half-measures, you're just totally,
absolutely, 100% wrong.  Please take a few minutes to come to terms with it.
Thank you.

Now, given that you're so absolutely wrong, and given that it *isn't* 
profitable to give unlimited quantities of ANYTHING, much less bandwidth,
for $30 per month, can you please explain what you think the problem is
with business models which (a) charge for quantities of resources which
are actually consumed, and/or (b) business models which provide the customer
with a disincentive for consuming unlimited amounts of a resource?

 &gt; &gt; It also removes any sense of responsibility whatsoever.  Despite the
 &gt; &gt; impressions of people on "unlimited" plans, bandwidth isn't an unlimited
 &gt; &gt; commodity.  Wastefulness is expensive.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Give me a break, want to know what I think Mark, I think you are
 &gt; speaking the employer speak, you have not the faintest clue about, or
 &gt; interest in, real issues and are simply justifying a business point
 &gt; (model) and using a weak argument to boot.

Ok, Stephen - Start an ISP.  Give out $30 per month unlimited accounts.
Do everything you can to preserve network quality;  I fully expect that
if you're right you'll be able to run an ISP which gives no busy signals
and has excellent performance for $30 per month, totally unlimited.

Have you stopped to think about how stupid that sounds?  What on earth
do you think is so different about bandwidth?  Why do you claim that it's
the only commodity available in the world which can be obtained in unlimited
quantities for free?

Bah!

 &gt; Last and not least, do YOU have a dingoblue account

traceroute is your friend.  Why don't you work it out.
