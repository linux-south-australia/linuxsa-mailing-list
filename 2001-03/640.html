After reading my last post, I guess I was frustrated and it showed in the wording
of the mail. If you go through my mail on this topic you will see I have never
challenged the business model, I have challenged the cost of internet access.
The real cost as charged to us ISP's by Telstra.  NOT  ONCE  have I asserted that
costs are cheap, what I have asserted is that is does not have to cost this
amount. Look through my previous mail, somewhere in the debate you and David
Newall made assumptions I was challenging the actual costs and that I'm afraid
was not the case.

So I'll finish on this note.

My apologies if my last mail seemed a little to harsh it was meant as a rebuttal
to your comments that time/cost charges were an appropriate mechanism to use,
when my belief is that we are being basically screwed by Telstra and Internet
charges are way to high to benefit anyone, ISP individual or country.

And as for Dingoblue accounts... :-)

End of this topic

Best wishes

Steve

&gt;  &gt; Disincentive, yeah right, so you are happy with a world of
&gt;  &gt; "disincentives" you sound more like a scientoloigist than a rational
&gt;  &gt; thinking human being. "disincentives"- ba humbug...
&gt;
&gt; &lt;boggle&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Listen, Stephen.  This whole conversation is based on your assertion that
&gt; bandwidth is so fundamentally cheap that offering unlimited quantities of
&gt; it for $30 per month is a rational and profitable way for a business to
&gt; behave.
&gt;
&gt; You are wrong.  Totally wrong.  There is no doubt about it, no questions
&gt; asked, no room for debate or doubt, no half-measures, you're just totally,
&gt; absolutely, 100% wrong.  Please take a few minutes to come to terms with it.
&gt; Thank you.
&gt;
&gt; Now, given that you're so absolutely wrong, and given that it *isn't*
&gt; profitable to give unlimited quantities of ANYTHING, much less bandwidth,
&gt; for $30 per month, can you please explain what you think the problem is
&gt; with business models which (a) charge for quantities of resources which
&gt; are actually consumed, and/or (b) business models which provide the customer
&gt; with a disincentive for consuming unlimited amounts of a resource?
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; It also removes any sense of responsibility whatsoever.  Despite the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; impressions of people on "unlimited" plans, bandwidth isn't an unlimited
&gt;  &gt; &gt; commodity.  Wastefulness is expensive.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Give me a break, want to know what I think Mark, I think you are
&gt;  &gt; speaking the employer speak, you have not the faintest clue about, or
&gt;  &gt; interest in, real issues and are simply justifying a business point
&gt;  &gt; (model) and using a weak argument to boot.
&gt;
&gt; Ok, Stephen - Start an ISP.  Give out $30 per month unlimited accounts.
&gt; Do everything you can to preserve network quality;  I fully expect that
&gt; if you're right you'll be able to run an ISP which gives no busy signals
&gt; and has excellent performance for $30 per month, totally unlimited.
&gt;
&gt; Have you stopped to think about how stupid that sounds?  What on earth
&gt; do you think is so different about bandwidth?  Why do you claim that it's
&gt; the only commodity available in the world which can be obtained in unlimited
&gt; quantities for free?
&gt;
&gt; Bah!
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Last and not least, do YOU have a dingoblue account
&gt;
&gt; traceroute is your friend.  Why don't you work it out.
&gt;
