hmmm, thats very interesting Allan

I've always consider the following daily/weekly readings "essential" for 
anyone into Linux.

slashdot.org (daily), linuxtoday.com (daily) and lwn.net (weekly)
opps, sorry I just added another one ;-)

They have been around for a long time and proved to be excellent source of 
information. It is a very popular channel for open source developers to 
communicate with the public.

I am curious, if you don't read the above and you didn't like Richard 
posting link to these sites.... where and how do you keep up-to-date to 
whats out there in the Linux world ? If you have other "non-advertisery" 
linux resources, you might want to consider sharing them with this group for 
the benefit of the community.

&gt;&lt;Gurgle!&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Richard, you're actively advertising a company & it products on the list. I
&gt;was under the (possibly false) impression that that considered bad form.
&gt;
&gt;This is the second time you've done this, first it was "/." (though to a
&gt;lesser extent), now this mob. Where does it end?
&gt;
&gt;Until you sent that piece of spam (ridiculous word for junkmail) I'd never
&gt;heard of them, now I'll be even less inclined to visit their site if I see
&gt;it in a web search.
&gt;
&gt;I see myself with three options here:-
&gt;
&gt;1. Filter the thread.
&gt;2. Filter mail from you.
&gt;3. Unsubscribe from the list.
&gt;
&gt;For the moment I'm going with option 1.
&gt;
&gt;Allan
