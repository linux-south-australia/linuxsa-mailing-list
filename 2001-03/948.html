&gt;Of course the traffic is limited by the pipe size, the available incoming
&gt;bandwidth of your upstream provider, and their upsteram provider, if any
&gt;etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;Even internode users are limited in some regards, right? ;-)

Not -technically- limited right now - the limitations are based more 
on what people want to spend.

Our upstream pipes are actually ten times larger than the total draw 
of our customer base put together.

This is a deliberate strategy to avoid bottlenecks internal to our 
network as far as possible.

This is one of the upsides of charging equitably by the megabyte 
instead of constraining performance down to meet a price point.

&gt;
&gt;You chose one particular way of assesing the  the cost of the fixed pipe,
&gt;but I think there are other ways of assesing it - i e other way s of
&gt;lookign at the "problem".
&gt;Eg in terms of how many simulatenous users it can support at a given
&gt;average bandwidth per users, from which you can extrapolate the number
&gt;of total users you can support, and how much revenue you can expect to
&gt;generate from that population.

Yep, this is another, completely valid approach - seeing how many 
elephants you can stuff into a single drinking straw.

We just don't choose to work this way - such an ISP is limiting cost 
by limiting achievable performance. This is a completely valid way to 
live, it just isn't how we run our place. It generates accounts that 
might be called 'unlimited' but which are limited because in peak 
times your link runs like a slug.

We don't have that 'feature', is all. There is nothing illegal, 
immoral or fattening about running an ISP that way as long as you 
don't concurrently claim to be 'fast'.

&gt;A different way of interpreting the same figures.

No, a different way to impose a limit to make the numbers work. 
Either charge for unconstrained downloads on an equitable basis, or 
constrain peak download speed and control costs that way. Either is 
valid, but produces different customer outcomes - one could be called 
'fast' and the other could be called 'cheap', for instance. Just be 
clear which one you're getting :)

&gt;
&gt;Yes but unlimited download does not mean an unlimited account.
&gt;You can limit on time eg the old $1 per hour account.

Sure, no problem We have a $1 (plus GST) per hour account today. Yes, 
you can download all you want on that one, absolutely unlimited, 
providing you pay $1.10 (inc) per hour when you're doing it.

But most people on this list wouldn't have called that 'unlimited' 
because the implication from 'unlimited' is 'no limits'. That's why 
this whole use of the "U" word is horrible (even though I can see 
that we'll have to start marketing products with the "U" word in 
their titles at some point, but making it very clear what is 
'unlimited' and what is limited, in the use of same - because it 
seems to be the way of the world.

&gt;You can limit bandwith, eg you have an unlimited download quota but you a
&gt;only suck at 1k per sec max ie your quota is not limited but your
&gt;ability to suck is.
&gt;

Correct - as long as your customers know you're rate constraining 
them in order to control your own costs, that's perfectly fine.

&gt;We choose to use different formula.
&gt;Your is probably more profitbale.
&gt;I am still reaosnably confident that mine is viable.

Yes, with reduced per-customer performance. So it's a matter of 
choice. We're both right.

&gt;  &gt; TANSTAAFL
&gt;
&gt;??? Not familiar with the acronym.

There Aint No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. There's a certain science 
fiction author who you must've have come across :)

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Well, you said you hadn't tried one of ours... :)
&gt;
&gt;Because they dont have the right price range for me- at least not as far
&gt;as I can get from your phone answerers or web site.

Yep. Well, we have that hourly unlimited one - why not try one of 
those ($11 per month for the first 10 hours, then $1.10 per hour 
thereafter... you're the one that brought that example up :) )

We're also working on an 'unlimited hours' account, but with the 
drivers you've seen me show to wanting to be truthful in advertising, 
its taking some effort to make sure that none of our customers are 
mislead about the limits that exist to make the 'unlimited hours' 
part possible. $24.50 per month inc GST is the intended price point.

&gt;But then again I have not checked recently. I have been very happy with
&gt;my current local ISP.

Good!

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; We try very, very hard indeed in exactly the areas you say that you want.
&gt;
&gt;So if internode can be succesuful and survive, so can another player with
&gt;the same attention to users?
&gt;

Yes definitely. But to survive in the long term you also need to do 
something more than just dialup access to the Internet. That's a 
piece of the landscape, not the whole picture, these days.
