Hi.

Hmm. Yes, well this is a valid point. Personally, the David types don't
worry me anymore. You have to accept that they (probably) know more about
unix than most people on the list will ever know. They are also unwilling
to spill it onto the list without regard. That's their perogative I guess.
It's a bit like talking english to a frenchman - you know he speaks
english, but he aint gunna capitulate unless you try a bit of french..

The worry is that they may be burning a few linux newbies with their
at time obtuse and unhelpful replies. There is also a willingness to
'bait' flames, which I think is regarded as 'sport'

Maybe we should distribute a procmail recipe to newbies that filters these
guys? Tell them to run it until they have detached the trainer wheels and
are ready for some abuse.

&lt;grin&gt;

PS: w(x) has worked for every modem (mostly Rockwell chipsets) that I have
ever been inclined to try it on, and that's a few. I'm sure there are
modems that it doesn't work on though.

PPS: David is correct in that it would be a good idea to search the
archives for a resolution to your problem before posting to the list.
That's a standard netiquette, but he didn't really say it that way...

&gt; The type of elitist bull crap that goes on needs to be weeded out lest we
&gt; become another AUUG with few member's feeling smug about how much we know
&gt; about linux, and no one to share it with.
&gt; 
&gt; New Linux people are not only LinuxSA's life blood, they are the future
&gt; promoters of Linux (in all walks of life)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your post now, and welcome to LinuxSA - the vast majority of whom
&gt; are great people.
&gt; 
&gt; Please don't stop posting just becuse we have a few less than diplomatic
&gt; users.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes
&gt;

&gt; &gt; The incredibly anal replies from the two David's to the original post
&gt; &gt; are precisely why I won't post to this list anymore.
&gt; &gt; As a newbie I have a thousand questions I would love to know the answer
&gt; &gt; to but posting questions to this list has not been a pleasant experience
&gt; &gt; in the past.
&gt; &gt; I even thought about coming to a LinuxSA meeting but if Sad-Sacks like
&gt; &gt; this hang out there then I'll give that a miss also...
&gt; &gt;
