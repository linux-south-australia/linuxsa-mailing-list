&gt;Has anyone as yet mentioned settlement.
&gt;Does optus for example pay telstra 19 cents(or adjusted volume price) a
&gt;meg for every meg off the telstra network and vice versa.

Settlement/Peering of national traffic happens between the "big 4" at the
moment, Telstra, Connect.com, Optus and Ozemail (UUNET). The details of the
settlement aren't known, because when the ACCC forced peering on them, they
didn't put in a clause that would allow future peering or public knowledge
of the deals made.

Primus are currently trying to break into this exclusive cartel at the
moment, but aren't having much luck.  Probably because they have nothing to
contribute but besides requests as they're primarily a dialup provider. At
least local ISP's do a lot of web hosting as well. Watch out for Primus
trying to get seriously into web hosting this year so the "no homers" club
will let them (Homer) in.

Optus have been on a mission to collect all sources of data, either because
there's a financial benefit due to the peering arrangement, or someone in
there [1] has figured out that a network is only as valuable as the content
that is in it.

UUNET have offered to peer with anyone that has their own regional network
(at least 50% geographic region) and 5Mbps of traffic to share. When they
say geographic region, they mean asia-pacific, ie: you're in two countries.
See <A HREF="http://www.uu.net/peering/">http://www.uu.net/peering/</A>

Connect.com offer free local peering with their differentiated traffic
services. ie: you don't pay for data received from anyone at the same POP.
Once upon a time they even paid ISP's for content.

Telstra thought they'd have a go at valuing ISP content, but somehow this
confused the minds of management, and they came back with a 'settlement
scheme' that looked suspiciously like a volume discount along with a vague
promise not to charge for backchannel traffic if you used Telstra 100% [2].

Paradox are present at a few peering exchanges in order to carry traffic for
their own network.

[1] I'm told Optus have some smart management. How else can you explain a
massive loss-making Internet service turned into a windfall overnight by
selling it to a utility?
