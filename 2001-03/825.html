&gt; Please explain how any organisation can sell you an 'unlimited'

&gt; should?
&gt; 
&gt; Try that argument with the manager of your local petrol station.

Doesnts it depend on the unit thoigh?

If the unit is per meg, then per meg is approrite to abse your ISP charges
on.

But there are wholesalers who are willing to sell you on bandwidth
basis ie the fatness of the pipe not the litres of petrol you pull
through it to use the petrol station analogy, which I suspect most
reasonable size isps buy their data on, yet they charge the users per meg.
Per meg was certainly porbably the most common unit of wholesale bandwidth
in .au a few years ago, but it appears to be changing quite a lot, and in
any case the per unit privce seems to have dropped a whole lot.

Also why bitch about what leeches do to ISP profits?
That presuambly is also priced into current costs structures.

Has anyone as yet mentioned settlement.
Does optus for example pay telstra 19 cents(or adjusted volume price) a
meg for every meg off the telstra network and vice versa.

I dont know but I woudl imagine they woudl have some sort of settlemnt.

I certainly dont thin telstra retails pays telstra wholesale 19 cnets for
data for the telstra netowrk.

I suspect that national data charges for larger players are very minimal,
and this surely is a contributing factor to their appparently too good to
be true deals(form a smaller isp perspective).

They also basically as I understand it dont pay for traffic for their
client ISP, if they do pay they pay bugger all, and in some cases they
charge(backchannel). They also charge for traffic origitnating from their
netwokrs as if it had originated outside of their network.

Yet another advantage over the regional/small isp.

Eg if a telstra client hits a web site hosted at arcomnet, arcomnet
doenst get 19 cents from telstra, they get say 2 cents, or maybe they get
charged for it, depending on how much they have downloaded lately and
their plan.
Yet they get chaged the full 19 cnets if one of their clients hits
atelstra hosted site, even if the data doenst actually trnist telstras
network, they still get charged transit rates.

I also suspect that a company like telstra or optus probably has some
level of settlement for international traffic too. 

Once a again this is a guess, but it would seem to be logical.
At least it would from the articles that Mr Huston writes/speaks about in
various rags and books and talks.

So what might be completely unsustainable for a little or regional isp
may be barely any cost to the national isp or international carrier, that
presuambly already has good relationships for voice traffic with otehr
international and national carriers.

So what might be unsustainable for Internode, Senet or Rebel, may not
actually be nearly so outrageously impossible  for telstra or optus and
the other big guys.
