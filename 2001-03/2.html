&gt; AUUG can contribute much to us, and it tries to regularly.  The thing
&gt; is that we can contribute to AUUG, too.  AUUG needs local enthusiasm and
&gt; local members.  It needs members who will organise local meetings.  It
&gt; needs a Geoffrey or a Matthew (splitter! ;-) ).  Why are so few of us
&gt; members of AUUG?  Why don't we consider become affiliated with AUUG?

Hmm... I am not a member of AUUG because I can't spread myself thinly enough
to get involved in another *nix users group. AUUG doesn't really offer me
anything I want. I don't have time to contribute to it. Basically, IMHO,
LinuxSA has the critical mass, and AUUG doesn't. Also, I think that while we
are LinuxSA, and we do focus on Linux, in reality, we are more like the
FreeSoftwareSA or OpenSourceSA, as most of our discussion is on GPL'd
software rather than on Linux itself. I guess we're also interested in
unices in general as well. I don't see anything extra that AUUG offers.

Hmmm.... I do see things like the symposia and conferences etc, but then, I
think we (and Linux-Aus) do just as much -- CALU, Linux.conf.au,
InstallFest, etc... Really, there's nothing that _I_ see right now that AUUG
does that LinuxSA and Linux-Aus don't or couldn't do.

As has been mentioned in the past, maybe we should think of becoming the SA
branch of AUUG... IMHO, this option offers us too little, and really doesn't
represent what we are about. I don't know what AUUG are mainly focussed on,
and maybe it is primarily Linux and open source stuff, but I guess I see it
as something that is commercial-focussed... many people on this list would
cite their primary reason for using Linux to be a philosophical, RMS like
one, primarily about freedom, and hence, Solaris etc don't cut the
mustard...

Hmmm... Personally, I'm still for incorporating separately, and allowing us
to retain our own focus. Presently, <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/linuxsa/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/linuxsa/</A> says
our "guiding principle" is "To promote and support Linux in South
Australia". I suggest incorporating and changing that to "To promote and
support Free and Open Source Software in South Australia". It seems to be
closer to what we are about (inclusive of Samba, Apache, GNOME, FreeBSD,
etc)...

As a comparison, <A HREF="http://www,auug.org.au/info/">http://www,auug.org.au/info/</A> says that AUUG's
constitutional aim is "To promote knowledge and understanding of Open
Systems including but not restricted to the UNIX system, networking,
graphics, user interfaces and programming and development environments, and
related standards." ... I don't think that that is quite us. (IMHO)

Anyway, "hmmm."
