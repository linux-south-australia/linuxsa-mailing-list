&gt; AFAIK there has been only one forceable removal from LinuxSA (that being
&gt; 'Chucky').  As long as people aren't continual and habitual
&gt; abusers of "The
&gt; Rules" then I suggest we let things go.  Afterall, we do want to
&gt; welcome as
&gt; many as we can to the freedom on Linux and open source.  The list owners
&gt; (<A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A>) already rule in a benevolent
&gt; dictatorship anyways,
&gt; and quite benevolently too, which is a good thing.

I guess what my point is, is that something should be added to Richard's
post to say that if your "a very naughty boy/girl" then the above benevolent
list owners will turf you. This being at their own descression etc.

Regards,

Patrick Browne
