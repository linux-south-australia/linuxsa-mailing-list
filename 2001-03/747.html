Looks a bit on the weird side of ordinary!

You may want to post your smb.conf & netlogon.bat.

Run the following at a console prompt on the 
server:  "testparm &gt;smbconf.txt" (no quotes obviously)
you'll need to hit enter after executing the command as 
testparm waits for this if you run it normally.
(also you may want to edit the file before posting to remove
any site-specific details if necessary)

E-smith is a little peculiar in setting up smb.conf in that 
it uses templates for everything, i had a few hassles with it
because i was used to hacking up the smb.conf file on its own,
in E-smith that can break things

Regards

Subject: Q:Samba Drive mappings



Hello,

This is Adam Thomas from Community Aid Abroad. We've just completed a
major migration of our network from Novell Netware to Linux and Samba.
We're all quite happy about this but we have run into some problems with
Samba. One of our volunteers suggested we post to this list as he thought
some of the subscribers had some samba expertise.

The problem: When a user logs in several drives are mapped to various
shares on the Linux box (E-smith 4.01 distribution which is based on
RedHat 6.1).  Everything seems fine on login, but within a few minutes of
logging in, windows explorer shows that all drives (E: through Z:) have
been mapped. The original login mappings are maintained the others are
mapped to one of the original mappings.  There's a screen shot of this
behavior at

<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/athomas24/drivebug.jpg">http://www.geocities.com/athomas24/drivebug.jpg</A>

Our client are Windows NT 4.0 SP6 boxen. Samba version is 2.0.7. I would
be happy to provide our smb.conf and netlogon.bat if that will help.

We would appreciate any suggestions you could provide.

cheers,
-Adam Thomas
