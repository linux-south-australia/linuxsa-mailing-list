&gt; 
&gt; because they are not as common or easy to deal with as line wrapping. Line
&gt; wrapping is prety trivial. HTML is not. Cyrillic is but is not common.

So THIS is a BIG sin, but THIS is a little sin ... ??
 
&gt; Hmmm... I can't think which thread this is.

Lack of knowledge is excusable.  Deliberate obtuseness isn't.

&gt; But anyway -- maybe I should have reworded my original as "surely there
&gt; aren't any mail readers out there that can't deal with wrapping their own
&gt; text." Are there? what mail reader do you use?

No you should have not have intruded in the first place without the
knowledge to back your comments.  I am also NOT going to enter into a
silly "my reader is better than your reader" conversation.

PLEASE take a single line of (say) Ian's message and place it in
various editors which might be available to you and see how they handle
that paragraph-line.  Then ask yourself WHY they don't all handle that
paragraph-line the same way. 

You are clearly unaware that there are good reasons why mail readers
should NOT wrap incoming mail.  It isn't just the creation of an ugly
mess when your reader wraps a message that is already wrapped.  
Try handling 100 lines x 10 columns of technical results with a reader
that wraps automatically.

I believe that there is an argument that readers should wrap incoming
mail automatically, but so far as I can see it only has merit in the
receipt of M$Word-type paragraphs, which you shouldn't be getting from
a mailing list anyway.

&gt; I do object somewhat to getting .doc
&gt; format mail, but again, I have to deal with it becuase I receive it all the
&gt; time.

OK, then you will choose a reader that copes with this, and accept any
limitations that might result.  That's fine.   Note however, that your
reader will cope with messages I can read easily, but the obverse is
not true.
