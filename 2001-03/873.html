Hi,

I though I would provide a run-down on LinuxWorld Singapore to give people
some idea of what happened there as well as provide other interesting
pieces of information.

LinuxWorld Singapore was organized jointly by IDG Asia and the Linux User's
Group (Singapore).  It was a good example of what can be achieved by a LUG
and a commercial organization.  It had a broad adenda, with its main focus
on providing information to current and prospective users of Linux. It was
more of a business conference than a hacker's conference, although there
were a number of hackers and other Linux notables in presence.

The conference was attended by people like Liz Coolbaugh of Linux Weekly
News, and Richard Stallman put in an appearance. Hackers in attendance
included Greg Lehey, Matthias Kranz, Don Becker, Stas Bekman, Greg Hostler,
Andrey Savochkin, Paul Sheer, Billy T Lee and Richard Sharpe.

The first day was taken up with a series of half-day tutorials and one
full-day  tutorial. The second and third day consisted of talks and keynote
speeches delivered by both local and international visitors. Saturday was
to consist of an exhibition for the general public.

This year, attendance was down on last year, with the talks, tutorials and
exhibition being held in the same cluster of presentation rooms.  However,
there was plenty of equipment on display. 

There is a lot of interest in Singapore and Asia in general in Linux and in
contributing to Open Source projects, but people seem to find it difficult
to start making a contribution.

Notable aspects of the conference for me, apart from meeting people like
RMS, Don Becker and Liz Coolbaugh for the first time, included:

- Meeting my first 19 year old CTO

- Meeting a 16.5 YO who had a very strong knowledge of Linux and TCP/IP

- Meeting a couple of people from the Indonesian Linux User's Group who
showed me the very professional looking Linux Magazine that they have put
together. I wish I could find it again.

There also seems to be a number of international companies with R&D offices
in Singapore where Linux seems to be in strong use. One example is
Ericsson, who are doing lots of work with Linux in Singapore.
