&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You can nail up a 128k ISDN Data over Voice call for a flat rate
&gt; &gt; $0.18 (plus GST) per channel, and LEAVE IT UP just like a permanent
&gt; &gt; modem link, and it will cost you as much as an analog voice modem
&gt; &gt; call would!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Does telstra care about this? I mean it would seem that they would not
&gt; be capitalising on the marcket, and maybe even see it as loosing money.
&gt; 

There is another way to look at this.

Telstra does not have much boradband in places like adelaide.
The broadband they do have, dsl seems to be fairly problem ridden.

This gives peopel a way of gettign if not boradband, at least low
lantency, low loss (relatively) services. It means they can make some
people happy without DSL, or cable, right now.

They also get some revenue or at east eh smae revenue as they woudl get if
peopel just used a phone.

It also means whatever infrastructure telstra has in place for
isdn(assumgn some of it is unique or only failry useful for isdn) will
get used a bit, whereas if every oen had dsl, or in the case of
homes/businesses not interested in data, justa normal phone line or maybe
two, then the isdn infrastucture wouldnt be used as much.

Any way these are just some speculative possiblities.

Telstra may of course object heavily on other grounds or grounds only
telstra understands.

I guess I cna see hwo it hurts telstra if people use DOV, and it may in
smome way help them, at least in the short/medium term where they seem to
be having problems with other "competing" services such as DSL.
