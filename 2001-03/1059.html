&gt; I certainly will keep you posted.  By in-house - are
&gt; you suggesting that out-sourcing may not be the best
&gt; solution?

Depends on the organisation.  Its always case by case.
Most of my experience has been in govt. organisations in 
both the education & health sectors.
I certainly agree that in the larger corporate/govt. 
environments, outsourcing does have a lot of merit.
By in-house development I was referring more to the 
smaller applications of which  we have so many in the health sector.
Certainly outsourcing is the better way to go, IF as you 
said it is done properly.  The only problems I have with
it is that people in the government who signed off on all
the outsourcing contracts really had little idea of the 
implications.  Its that ignorance factor again.
(of course, 20/20 hindsight is always handy too ;-)
 

&gt; However - I whole-heartedly agree with your objective
&gt; approach to *nix.  While I am frustrated with the 
&gt; closed door attitude of many from the MS family - I
&gt; am frustrated by the eagerness of SOME *nix users to 
&gt; gloat about victories but not put in the hard effort
&gt; to make it happen more.  Too many times I have
&gt; mentioned the 'L' word (linux) to support people or 
&gt; managers and their eyes have rolled before I say 
&gt; anything at all.  I think many IT managers are and
&gt; other managers are frustrated with the passion of 
&gt; Linux people which can be mis-interpreted as
&gt; stubborness.

Agreed.
I think there's a little too much of the "Linux will
take over the world" attitude.  I'm the first one to 
put up my hand & say Linux is great, why not use it, 
but for the average sysadmin (generalisation!) out there, 
what they have in place, while it may not be up to the 
standards we have with *nix, it generally works ok (with 
the odd reboot here & there)  Generally you have to wait till
they need something that requires an upgrade in their 
software (ie: big bucks) & jump in then with the advantages
of open source and *nix.
One of the biggest issues in most people's minds is why
should they change/upgrade just for the sake of it.  They do it
all the time with Windows & are sick of it.  They see the 
change idea as just another opportunity for the IT boffins
to stuff up their systems & land a whole lot more new stuff
on top of them which they have to re-learn all over again.
We're about to go to W2K / Office 2K on all our desktops, 
the W2K change is good in my opinion because its a heck of
a lot more stable than Win95, but the Office 2K is totally 
unnecessary & a colossal waste of money for what you get.
I for one would love to roll out StarOffice thru a dozen sites
as a project for 12 months, still using W2K as the OS.
Apart from a few basic training issues, I would guarantee that
the beancounters would sit up & take notice of the cost savings!

Just putting a 20% up your 2.2c Ian :-)


&gt; All the passion in the world won't stand up against
&gt; thorough documentation** on why MS is better.

Very true.
**change to 'propaganda' ;-)
