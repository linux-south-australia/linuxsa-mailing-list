&gt;  &gt; That's a pretty long bow, David. The Board charges it's Chief exec to
&gt;  &gt; build a profitable business. There is an expectation of both short and
&gt;  &gt; long term profits. The Execs, and even the Board risk losing their jobs if
&gt;  &gt; they fail. Illegality implies a criminal act and I think failing to
&gt;  &gt; maximise short term profits is not yet a crime.
&gt; 
&gt; It is if you're a director of a publically listed company.  You have a 
&gt; legally-enforcable duty to your shareholders to maximize profits.

Really? OK. Does it say the duty should apply to short or long term
profits? What measure is used?

Does this stuff hit the courts? It must be a gravy train for the legal
eagles if it does...

Michael
&gt; 
&gt; And that, my friends, is why privatizing Telstra is bad.  While it isn't
&gt; a publically listed company, it can have obligations like "Building  a
&gt; modern telecommunications infrastructure nationwide for the benefit of
&gt; all Australians," and, "Providing telecommunications services to support
&gt; rural communities," and other community-service orientated and nation-
&gt; building roles.
&gt; 
&gt; Once they're a publically listed company, though, their first obligation
&gt; is, "Maximize profits."  Anything less than that is a crime, punishable
&gt; with real jail time in a real jail.  Their community service functions
&gt; can still happen, but only if they're profitable (i.e., only if Telstra
&gt; charges more for them than their cost of provision).
&gt; 
&gt; The result:  Telstra profits go up, unprofitable services (e.g.,
&gt; maintenance, almost everything they do in rural areas, fault repair)
&gt; are cut back to the bone.
&gt; 
&gt; So - When Ziggy talks about the inherent conflicts involved in running
&gt; a business which is 50% Government owned, that's what he means:  He has
&gt; a Government giving him shit about cutbacks in country areas, and he
&gt; has shareholders absolutely insisting that he implement cutbacks to 
&gt; maximize profits.  Ziggy thinks the perfect solution to that is to
&gt; sell the rest of Telstra to the shareholders, at which point he'll be 
&gt; able to start ignoring the pesky Government and its continual whinging
&gt; about annoying community service obligations.
