&gt;  &gt; What about caching?  Some ISPs offer unlimited download from their
&gt;  &gt; cache or newsgroup. 
&gt; 
&gt; Name three.  I hear lots of people saying this, but I'm yet to see
&gt; any ISPs for which this is actually true.  
&gt; 
&gt; 

How bout two?

There is a 250 Mb download limit. 
                    Again the user may also continue to use the service
beyond the 250
                    Mb download limit at no additional cost, however their
access will be restricted to local
                    services - which include web access through our proxy
server, email, news, SE Net &
                    OzBytes resources.

For those who want no time limits to their usage on the 'net. You can use
as much time as
                              you like subject to a 4 hour busy killer.
You may be disconnected after 4 hours if the lines
                              here are busy (which is pretty rare!). This
plan gives you a massive 1500Mb (1.5 Gigabytes!)
                              download per month, and excludes all
downloads from the Chariot News, Games and Mail
                              Servers.
Then try this:
www.chariot.net.au/members/localcheck.htm

Enter an address you think will be on saix but not hosted at chariot, eg
senet.com.au or internode.com.au. THen try somethign that you reckon
might be non local, eg www.microsoft.com.au.

Now the free local is not explicitly stated on the product page, but I am
99% sure that it is the policy. The local sites check up page I feel
supports this to some extent.
I am happy to stand corrected, if someone has better info.

Now these two I now about off the top of my head.

There maybe others.

But it doesnt really matter, now you can say I keep hearing about it and
know about two examples, though I would like to have known about three.

I reckon this is reasonable evidence that some ISPs offer this traffic
diferrenciation.

I think it is enough evidence to suggest that this type of traffic
differentiation is not just outrageous local urban internet myth.
