Then my statement isn't flame worthy, as you have pointed out yourself that
"the original irongate chipset was a bit troublesome" !

... all video cards should work with a board that isn't troublesome right ??

Jeremy et al:

&gt; absolutely no reason why to choose celeron/piii over amd. The original
&gt; irongate chipset was a bit troublesome, and the kta133 ide performance
&gt; didn't quite compare to intel 82815 chipset, but with the kta-2 this was
&gt; resolved, and now with the new kta-3 133 chipset boards, they now have 4
&gt; dimm sockets.

LOL

A bit troublesome? I'd flame you to death for that statement but you're
a nice boi so I'll be nice too:-P

I own an Athlon 650 with an original irongate chipset (on an MSI 6167
board). The irongate has never caused my Linux to fall over and I do
weird things like rebuild kernels with optimisation levels of 3 or
more...however Windows 95, 98 and my Riva TNT2 Ultra all had, well,
issues with the motherboard.

It can be a little tricky to get Windows 98 onto my system but once you
get used to the right sequence that's fine. Specifically, during
installation it is possible to lose contact with the 2nd IDE channel
which will stuff you in Windows if you have your CD's on that channel.

There are other oddities during installation, however, once you get it
installed Windows 98/95 appear to be no less unstable than they normally
are (1).

The Riva TNT2 Ultra speaks very well with XFree86 3.3.6 and 4.0.1...
