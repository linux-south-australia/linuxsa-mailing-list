 &gt; Once happy day I decided to make experiment and connect one company with 2mb
 &gt; link for US$48 per month instead of 32k for US$60. To my financial managers
 &gt; it looks like I got crazy but I overruled them and started such link as
 &gt; experiment. First few days I saw incredible traffic (almost up to given
 &gt; bandwidth) but then activity ceased just to average of 16k. I visited the
 &gt; company where we installed this link and asked them about why they ceased
 &gt; their downloads and got very obvious answer: "We ran out of disk space".
 
In Australia that isn't an impediment.  I've spoken to people here who use
their "Unlimited" plans to play a game between themselves:  They have races
to see who can fill up their hard disks first.

Once it's full they delete it and start again.  "Best of three?"

There's no disincentive for them doing something that stupid, because 
the traffic isn't actually costing them anything.  Meanwhile their ISP
is paying for each megabyte they download (either directly through a 
volume-charged wholesale link, or indirectly through a dollars-per-megabit
link).

 &gt; Unlimited traffic - it's just good for advertisment because most people
 &gt; associate it with their freedom to download something but actually they even
 &gt; don't need it :)

It also removes any sense of responsibility whatsoever.  Despite the
impressions of people on "unlimited" plans, bandwidth isn't an unlimited
commodity.  Wastefulness is expensive.
