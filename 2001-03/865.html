I rarely find myself having something to say :) and really enjoy reading the
exchanges on this list.

However, I must say (or is that scream) to 'Allan', "Get a grip man !!!!!!".
And Allan you will probably be doing yourself a great disservice if you
don't visit the LWN site.  It is a great weekly, and daily, comprehensive
summary of things going on in the Linux world.

Regards,

Richard

&gt; &gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I got to wondering if LWN was actually making enough money from its
&gt; &gt; advertising to support the wonderful stuff they do. As a result of this,
I
&gt; &gt; thought about some other funding models they could use.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;Gurgle!&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Richard, you're actively advertising a company & it products on the list.
I
&gt; was under the (possibly false) impression that that considered bad form.
&gt;
&gt; This is the second time you've done this, first it was "/." (though to a
&gt; lesser extent), now this mob. Where does it end?
&gt;
&gt; Until you sent that piece of spam (ridiculous word for junkmail) I'd never
&gt; heard of them, now I'll be even less inclined to visit their site if I see
&gt; it in a web search.
&gt;
&gt; I see myself with three options here:-
&gt;
&gt; 1. Filter the thread.
&gt; 2. Filter mail from you.
&gt; 3. Unsubscribe from the list.
&gt;
&gt; For the moment I'm going with option 1.
