&gt; &gt; well thanks, david, but what I asked was why isn't the "more *
&gt; &gt; file" also
&gt; &gt; a "basic recipe"? Seems more basic -- almost not a recipe...
&gt; but it acheives
&gt; &gt; pretty much the same thing, as far as I can see.
&gt;
&gt; That's exactly what I was saying.  Using more is not a recipe, it's
&gt; a simple command.  You can't generalise it to pattern searching, or
&gt; tabulating values, or columnising; and it certainly won't do all of the
&gt; above at once.  The recipe I provided, in semantic terms, is:
&gt;
&gt;   for a set of file from a specific set of files:
&gt;     perform a group of commands on each file
&gt;
&gt; Whenever you need to do something to a set of files, other than a trivial
&gt; command, you will find yourself re-using that recipe.

OK, so you recipe is more elegant and more flexible, but so far, it's no
better than the simple more solution.

&gt;
&gt; While more appears to solve the problem, it isn't because of any promised
&gt; feature.  In fact more promises to break the file up into page sized
&gt; chunks, separating each chunk with a "more" prompt, and depending on the
&gt; value of the TERM environment variable, different control characters and
&gt; different screen sizes will be assumed.  It may well be that if you sit
&gt; at a MicroBee terminal the output will look like:
&gt;
&gt;   ^Lfile1:
&gt;   blah blah
&gt;   ...
&gt;   blah blah
&gt;   ^[K4--More--^Lblah blah
&gt;    blah

This is a serious problem, and what I was alluding to when I said:

---
I could imagine that there could be differences in the way `cat` and `more`
deal with special characters, like say ^M and ^H, but I don't know this...
Also, perhaps it's got more to do with more being interactive, and trying to
paginate when it's going into a file. But if it acheives the same, and is
more obvious, less prone to error, and has no disadvantages (apart from
elegance, which I do value when it's practical), then I don't see the
difference...
---

&gt; Finally, when * matches only one file more doesn't output a file header.
&gt; More is not a correct solution.

And yes, this is also a problem.

I agree and now understand why the recipe is better...

Thanks :)
