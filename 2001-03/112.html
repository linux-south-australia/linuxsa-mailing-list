Sola and APC both work with Linux. I just put 2200VA APC Smart UPS unit on a
Web server and powercute works just the same as it does on a WinNT box and
is very easy to get going.

&gt; &gt; Of  course,  as  they  say,  Prevention  is better than a cure. Buy an
&gt; &gt; inexpensive  UPS! There are very few computers on the planet that will
&gt; &gt; take  the  continued abuse that Etsa Utilities provides us with, UPS's
&gt; &gt; are  relatively  cheap  now,  (esp  when  you  consider  the  cost  of
&gt; &gt; replacement hardware on a regular basis).
&gt;
&gt; David,
&gt;
&gt; I've been looking at UPSs and thinking about it for a long time.
&gt; (Since 1985 actually.)
&gt; Can you (or anyone else) recommend one or more brands in terms
&gt; of their usefulness for linux?
&gt;
&gt; The few I've seen in the stores until now have looked rather
&gt; clumsy, and I had no idea how I would make them work with linux.
&gt;
&gt; I've followed various discussions in linuSA about UPSs over the
&gt; years. But I don't remember any specific recommendations of
&gt; a good, cheap UPS for home use for, say, two PCs.
&gt;
&gt; SuSE now has a list of about 90 supported USP types and 20 unsupported.
&gt; But I often find that in Adelaide, the brands are not on
&gt; the European/US brand lists.
&gt;
&gt; On the SuSE UPS support list, they mention that the Meta ECO 750 has
&gt; kernel support! But none of the other 90 UPS types have this.
&gt;
&gt; Hmmm. A bit looking around reveals "man powerd", which describes
&gt; a nifty utility to get the OS down to single-user in the event of
&gt; a pwoer failure.
&gt; And the famous Alessandro Rubini seems to be the main author of it.
&gt;
&gt; There's even a UPS-HOWTO! With 3696 lines!!
&gt;
&gt; Okay.
&gt; Now all I need is a store where I can browse and buy.
&gt; I tried one store a while back and found some obscure
&gt; Australian-manufactured brand that is not in any listing
&gt; anywhere that I've seen.
&gt;
&gt; --------------------------------------------------
&gt; Question:
&gt; Can anyone recommend a store or stores in Adelaide
&gt; for the purposes of linux UPS browsing?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt; PS. I wonder if the new ETSA owner has shares in a UPS company?!
&gt; I wonder too if the members of a certain political party
&gt; might have such shares - but I have no info on this.
&gt; Only suspicions on a "who benefits" basis.
