Wayne,

&gt; All I can suggest to one particular user in general is, if you are
&gt; not on the list to help and encourage others, GET OFF.

It takes no great leap of intelligence to guess that you are referring
to me.  Tell me: Is it helpful to give wrong or misleading advice?  Is
it helpful to point out when wrong or misleading advise has been given?
I think the answers are no and yes.  Do you object to my use of the
word, "crap"?  It certainly made the W1 answer memorable, didn't it?
I think we all now have the message that W1 works on *some* modems but
not on others; and that the correct answer (as I have said so many times
before, including in this forum) is best found in your modem manual.
These are the three things that I originally said, and I said nothing
else.

Hey wayne, don't bother reading the manual.  If you want to get rid of
a file called -? you can do it, as root, using "rm -fr /".  I found that
answer on a web page somewhere.  I hope this helps you, and other people
*who don't know better.*

David, who cannot understand why people defend crap and attack fact.
