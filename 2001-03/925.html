&gt; Hmmm...
&gt;
&gt; That would have to be one of us. Firstly, David Newall has been working
&gt; the the Unix world for more than 25 years and he knows exactly what he
&gt; is talking about. The point of the matter is that each modem may have
&gt; exactly the same command set as another modem, but this does not hold
&gt; for all modems. Hence, David Newall was correct.

So. The general idea of Michael letting other users know about what "w1" can
possibly do for them was thoughful, and I like a lot of other members on the
list are glad he posted it. So are you saying, that before anyone posts a
message or idea to this list they must be 100%  correct, or they will be
spoken upon like dirt. ?, so much for new users trying to help out other new
users.

&gt; If you were to lookup davidn at the mailing list archives, you'd
&gt; probably find that he has been and continues to be quite helpful on the
&gt; mailing list. Furthermore, his company sponsored the last InstallFest
&gt; through organisational support, financial backing and more primarily
&gt; because he is involved in LinuxSA.

I sure David N has been helpful. From one Unix Expert to another which is
rather sweet, but what about from one expert to a newbie who nows nothing. I
don't use this list very often, but I remember last year when a newbie had
just subscribed to the list and posted his first message. A couple of you
bagged him and made unapproprite remarks to his cries for help.

Hey, at least Microsoft Support treat a user kindly, even though their
support has a lot to desire.

&gt;
&gt; There are some people who find the way David speaks quite difficult to
&gt; handle. He speaks with strength, conviction and he doesn't beat around
&gt; the bush. It doesn't bother me, but that may be because I speak in the
&gt; same manner. Personally, people have a nasty tendency to look at how
&gt; someone writes as opposed to what someone writes. That's human nature;
&gt; that's unfortunate.

Yes, I can agree that that sometimes it is best to speak with strength and
not to beat around the bush. But there is absolutley no reason for any kind
of conviction. Just because one user, who has a small amount of knowledge
tries to help and offer suggestions to another, gives no justification for
"experts" to accuse a helper of being a bloody idiot if they are not 100%
correct. In life generally, it's the tone of voice which is heard first and
the message second, the same goes with e-mail.

&gt; As for myself, I've been hacking computers since I was about 6 and a 1/2
&gt; years old. I taught myself BASIC when I was 7, Pascal when I was 8, C
&gt; when I was 9, C++ at 11, LISP, PROLOG and recently PERL. I've used Linux
&gt; for about 3 years now and I earn my living as a system administrator and
&gt; professional documentation writer. In addition, I recently presented a
&gt; "Basic Linux Course" at the Mitchell Park Community Centre along with
&gt; Robyn Manning. Furthermore, I'm one of the lists most prolific writers
&gt; and I've helped a significant amount of people - including Michael Kratz
&gt; who came to my house and I gave him enough pointers on his problem such
&gt; that he's now able to help others in similar situations as he was then.

I last time I saw you, and yes you should remember me, you had not had a job
for so long ........
with all of that experience you should never be out of work, but lets not go
into that.

&gt; Oh, did I mention that I put together the documentation for the
&gt; InstallFest last year and I'm involved in the organisation of the
&gt; InstallFest this year?

You don't need to, I saw you name on the web page. by the way,
what was the documentation ?

&gt; You can, of course, imply that one or both of us are "small minded
&gt; twits". That is your prerogative and far be it from me to disagree with
&gt; you. You might also imply that we "feel" superior to the rest of the
&gt; users in the group. Unfortunately, superior is a subjective term and I'm
&gt; not sure what criteria you're using to define it.

By superior I mean that you feel that the average linux user or newbie, are
sensless in the way that we try and help other to-be linux users, and that
we should be 100% correct before offering to help a struggling user. You
feel superior because you think you have the knowledge to be correct every
time you aid some one with their problem. If you where broad minded you
would not make people feel the way you do with your replies.

&gt; I can't remember seeing your name appear on the list so I presume that
&gt; you normally "lurk" rather than post.

Nah, I have another life away from computers, I also got sick of the
hostility from the same few users about a year ago. Ultimately, I
unsubscribed. They I subscribed again, only to find that it's till goin on.


&gt; That's fine. That's wonderful. If you don't normally talk on the list,
&gt; that's your choice. I would suggest, though, that suddenly appearing and
&gt; accusing two of the most prolific writers on the list of being "small
&gt; minded twits who feel they are superior to everyone else", and implying
&gt; they're not here to encourage or help people use Linux may not win you
&gt; any brownie points.

I was never after any points in the first place, I just don't see the
benefit of raming it down someone's throat if they are not 100% correct. The
majority of silent users appreciate the many small helpful comments a lot
more than the bagging comments made by the odd member.

&gt;
&gt; In other words, before you make such wild accusations about people and
&gt; what they believe in, it might be best to have some evidence to back it
&gt; up. What's happened here is that David Newall pointed out that a) what
&gt; the original poster posted was wrong (and it is) and b) that it's been
&gt; discussed before. That's all and it's that simple.

You said "what they beleive in", so you really believe that giving someone a
hard time, (when all they are trying to do is let others know what they
otherwise wouldn't, about a small mistake or mis-wording), is going to
benefit us all.

Maybe when someone is wrong, users correcting them can be a little more
suttle about it and not so accusing!
