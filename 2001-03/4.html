&gt; &gt; Positives
&gt; &gt; ---------
&gt;
&gt; 1) LinuxSA becomes a legal person
&gt;  - able to take membership as a group of certain organisations that do
&gt; not recognise unincorporated associations
&gt;  - removes liability of members should a cause be found to sue

o it enables us to make financial transactions without resorting to the
cover of a group like AUUG.
o it enables us to get our own insurance for events we are running.
o it enables us to have an entity to say and do things under, rather than
just being a loosely associated group of people. We will be "LinuxSA Inc"
rather than "a bunch of like-minded individuals who call themselves
LinuxSA".
o it (may) enable companies to claim their contributions to LinuxSA against
tax(?)

&gt; 2) LinuxSA could become more `durable'
&gt;  - currently 1-2 organisers (with one in Melbourne if I remember
&gt; correctly)
&gt;  - answers the "what if the staff at Netcraft takes a bus to Sydney and
&gt; has a crash" question

o it enables us to actually have a budget for things like InstallFest,
rather than relying on individuals to take the risk (last year it was
effectively me who would have been liable for damages, and David Newall who
footed the bill for a few (not insignificant) things...)
o it enables us to decide somewhat formally in what direction we as a group
want to head -- and indeed, if we want to head anywhere at all...

&gt; &gt; Negatives
&gt; &gt; ---------
&gt;
&gt; 1) Change
&gt;  - people hate it and it is a change
&gt;
&gt; 2) Organisational Issues
&gt;  - it's a new way of running the group
&gt;  - possibly committee meetings and such
&gt;
&gt; If I could paraphrase Glen Turner though, if you write your constitution
&gt; properly you won't need to have excessive amounts of formality or
&gt; excessive committee meetings.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Funding
&gt;  - it costed $108 last year to Incorporate
&gt;  - changes to constitution incur a fee
&gt;  - unless LinuxSA is either a for-profit organisation or raises funds in
&gt; excess of a certain amount (in legal terms this translates as "becomes a
&gt; prescribed body under the Associations Incorporations Act 1993 as
&gt; amended), financial issues are moot provided the books are kept in a
&gt; reasonable state of affairs
&gt;
&gt; 4) Membership
&gt;  - it's hard to determine who is a member now
there is no membership now. There's nothing to belong to. There's
subscribers to a mailing list, and there's attendees of meetings, but these
mean nothing in reality.

&gt;  - we can't simply say "anyone is a member"
&gt;  - you do have to specify what is a member
 - we would probably have to charge a fee for members, and make some sort of
official record of membership and have AGMs.

&gt;
&gt; In a worst case scenario, this amounts to "who is the committee
&gt; accountable to"...however it's more "who gets the discounts that LinuxSA
&gt; may have negotiated" or "how does AUUG recognise LinuxSA members and
&gt; therefore charge a special conference registration fee".

and who can vote for committee(s) etc.

&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, because Incorporating is "change" and it is a rather
&gt; "ethereal" (1) concept and doesn't have any immediate effects on how the
&gt; association operates - word your constitution correctly and we won't
&gt; notice a change - on the surface it appears to have more cons than pros.

I think AGMs are _neccessary_ for incorporated bodies...

&gt; However, having an "official" Linux Users Group in Adelaide that works
&gt; hand-in-hand with the broader based Unix Users Group (AUUG) would, in my
&gt; opinion, serve to strengthen Unix and Open Source in South Australia.
&gt; Furthermore, incorporating removes a good number of legal issues and
&gt; absolves us from a number of "odd" things.

yes :)

PS are there any real _objectors_ to the concept? Can we say "yeah, we're
mostly interested, let's discuss how"?
