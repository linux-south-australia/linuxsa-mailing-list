Nicely done some propsed mods/additions below.


&gt; 1. Is it in HTML. Make it not so -- plain text is preferred by many.
&gt; 2. Do you have line wrap turned off -- turn it on... it irritates some
&gt; readers, and makes the web archive hard to read.
&gt; 3. Is it insulting, or a flame? Don't send it. This includes condescension,
&gt; harsh sarcasm, accusation of stupidity, and personal attacks. LinuxSA
&gt; doesn't need them, so please don't send them.
&gt; 4. Is the subject line relevant to the subject matter, and specific enough
&gt; to be userful? "A Question" is not useful. Nor is "No Subject" or "".
&gt; 5. Is it signal or noise? Signal is good, noise is bad. Noise doesn't add
&gt; anything to the list, and serves only to camoflage the signal. A post is
&gt; generally good if it causes (or enables) you or someone else to learn
&gt; something or fix something. Most Anti-MS jokes have been done before, and
&gt; aren't worth sending to the list, especially if that's the whole content of
&gt; your post. Be aware that some people on the list may be MS weenies...
&gt; 6. Has the subject matter been covered before? Check the archives. Will
&gt; bringing it up again really add anything other than traffic to the list?
&gt; 7. If you're responding to a flame or insult, take it with a pinch of salt,
&gt; and try to let it slide -- flaming trolls doesn't really help anyone.

Proposed addtion

8. The use of profanity is frowned upon. You are smart enough to be
exploring Linux so you are probably smart enough to be able to express
yourself without hte use of profanity. Profanity adds nothing to your
communication , except the possibly of offending someone and perhaps
breaching guideline 3 above you dont want to do that do you?

Proposed modification 

&gt; 1. prefix the subject line wiht "[ADD]" or "[PLUG]".
s/[ADD]/[AD]/

Proposed addtion.
[OT] Off topic - for questions that are not concerned directly with linux
or packages wdely used or distirbuted with linux, eg question about how to
install a widget in you  PC.
