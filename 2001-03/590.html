&gt; We took on a client with a aging Micro$oft based peer-to-peer LAN with about
&gt; 15 Windows 9x & 2k workstations all sharing stuff off each other and of the
&gt; so called Windows NT (worksation) server.
&gt; 
&gt; The system was badly in need of an upgrade and we gave them a Linux server
&gt; option or a NT server option, surprise they went for the Linux option.
&gt; 
&gt; We told the customer to support the Win 2k worksations we would have to put
&gt; in some very new cutting edge software (Samba-TNG) and that we had tested in
&gt; our own office and we used it everyday and all seemed to run ok. This was
&gt; part of our proposal and they agreed.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok ever had one of those sites where EVERYTHING goes wrong about 3-6 months
&gt; after the initial install AAARRGGGHHH!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; After quite a number of other things (i.e not Samba-TNG) related to
&gt; service-level-agreements etc. had hit the fan they got another firm in to
&gt; audit the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Next they are on the phone to us, and having not much else to bitch about
&gt; (we had done a good job) they started in on:
&gt; 
&gt; "...our audit shows that Samba-TNG is an ALPHA piece of software, how could
&gt; you dare run that on our mission critical production site it's not even
&gt; BETA! ... rant, rave, rant etc etc."
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways that was the background, here's the question for the folks on the
&gt; list who are out there selling and installing Linux solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; How much do you tell your clients?
&gt; Lots of stuff in Linux is on the "bleeding edge" and in a state of flux.
&gt; There is stuff I wouldn't put on a clients site in a screaming fit, but
&gt; other things must be installed and I not sure how much of say a Linux 6.2
&gt; basic server install is classed as "stable"?

It depends on your definition of stable. Are you still running a Samba
TNG PDC on a Linux box? Have you had any problems with it? I think that
whilst things are labelled as "alpha" or "beta", they are just not
*confirmed* as being stable.

I'm not sure how stable the TNG team see their software, but I know of a
number of large organisations who are using it. Having said that, we had
to cancel our migration from an NT PDC to a TNG PDC at quite short
notice, due to some fairly major bugs in a certain feature.

If worst comes to worst, Samba 2.2.0 should be released Real Soon Now
and that will support Win2K domain logons, as well as a fair bit more of
the RPC stuff used by NT and to a much lesser extent 9x.

Hope it helps,
Matt
