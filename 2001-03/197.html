Journalling filesystems usually perform ok, provided you have "enough"
RAM for caching.

"Enough" is usually considerably larger than it would be if you weren't
using a journalling filesystem.

The reason for this has to do with the way the filesystem writes data.
Writes tend to be contiguous and sequential (and nice and quick), because
they largely involve appending to a linear log.  Reads, on the other
hand, need to cope with the idea that the order of the log is essentially
random, rather and optimized for time in the way that "traditional"
filesystems are.

A diagram will help here.  If two processes are writing to file A and
file B at exactly the same time, with 64k writes, the log might end up
looking like this:

- - - ------------------------------------------------------------ - - - -
           |  64k | 64k  | 64k  | 64k  | 64k  | 64k  | 64k  |    
           |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |    
           |   A  |  B   |  A   |  B   |  A   |  B   |  A   |    
- - - ------------------------------------------------------------ - - - -

the disk head would have been able to write this log without needing
to seek;  it would have been nice and quick.

A process attempting to read either of those files, however, would need
to deal with the fact that blocks from files A and B would be spread out
all over the log.  The issue is "worse" if the files aren't actually 
being written to at the same time, e.g., if file A receives 200 kbytes of
data, then file B receives 800 Mbytes, then file A receives another 6 Mbytes,
the two chunks of file A could be spread out over a very large area of
the disk, and lots of head seeking could be needed to read it.

Journalling filesystems deal with this in a variety of ways.  For example,
during writing, physical writes might be delayed until there is a large
enough chunk of a file waiting for output (a couple of Mbytes, for example).
This means you need more cache memory to hold unwritten data to get good
performance out of the filesystem (because if you run out of RAM it'll
free some by flushing disk data whether it's "ready" or not).  And during
reading the filesystem will "read-ahead" in the background while your
process is digesting the first few blocks of data that has been delivered
to it -- this needs more RAM too, because the OS could conceivably read
many times more data from the disk than the process actually wants to
access, and that'd be data which would never have been cached if you weren't
using a journalling filesystem with an aggressive read-ahead policy.

If you have enough RAM, the performance of a journalling FS can be higher
than with a non-journalling filesystem.  I've personally seen an SGI 
Origin 2000 system with a multi-terabyte filesystem doing disk I/O in
the gigabyte-per-second range with XFS on XLV logical volumes -- But the
system had several dozen gigabytes of memory available to cache filesystem 
buffers :-)
