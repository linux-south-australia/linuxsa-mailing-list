If the technicalities can be resolved I would like to come down and help
assemble some hardware. I just need a date, time and place.

&gt; from what I grok from this discussion, and talking it over with shaun, cbsa is on a puter freeze - no more until we clarify our legal position! as much as I love
&gt; doing what we do, i won't risk being legally liable for anything, thats a bit much:)
&gt; 
&gt; look peeps, time to start actually joining in. we have discussed meeting a number of times, and i have suggested irc if people have probs with irl 9and being
&gt; busy, most of us would).
&gt; 
&gt; lets do this, we have much to discuss. if you dont make the meeting, and dont send your input in advance, you will be stuck with everyone else's
&gt; decisions...and thats just teh way it has to be.
&gt; 
&gt; lets actually get active, please. the few of us who have been actively building and distributing are worn out, and need fresh energy and ideas and input. we
&gt; have been so busy with systems, and now need help with teh infrastructure, as systems has taken up all our resources (time/energy) to date!
&gt; 
&gt; c'mon guys, you all joined because you are interested in helping people out. lets put some of that wish into infrastructure building, and making cbsa a part of cb
&gt; aus, and make it a viable, trhiving group. the only limit wwe have is how much we all choose to put in!!
&gt; 
&gt; so, meeting - one night this week, asap preferably. monday is out. weekend to be considered, as some people work nights.
&gt; 
&gt; romana, in cheerleader mode (as in 'go team' - and think how ridiculous i look as a pregnant cheerleader - so give me a break, huh?;) )

&gt; &gt;Hi all,
&gt; &gt;I hopped onto irc tonight and asked nevyn (vice president of
&gt; &gt;Computerbank Vic) some questions. Hopefully the answers may help with
&gt; &gt;any questions you have. Please have a look and let me know your
&gt; &gt;thoughts. Without feedback, I can only act for you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;thanks
&gt; &gt;Shaun
