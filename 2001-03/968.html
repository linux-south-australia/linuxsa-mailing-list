David!

&gt; You may also have said to read your modem manual, but I said it first
&gt; (albeit by implication.)

No, I said read your modem manual. You did NOT say read it. The whole
point of implying something is that you don't state it openly, therefore
you did NOT say read your modem manual. I did.

&gt; I didn't say to read the list archives, but you
&gt; did (also by implication.)

Actually, I did say it. Explicitly...

&gt; Both of us agree that the original posting
&gt; was crap, although only I had the courage of my convictions to use that
&gt; exact phrase.  ;-)

I agree that it was incorrect and misleading. A posting that is
incorrect and misleading from someone who should know better could be
defined as "crap" if you use the term metaphorically. Are you sure that
you didn't mean that the message was a piece of turd? In which case, I
would have to disagree with you; I couldn't possibly explain how you'd
come to that conclusion...

DSL

ps.

Would someone start mentioning Nazis:

1) on this thread
2) on any ADSL thread not directly or even indirectly related to
problems with Linux - the Operating System
3) on any other flame war

??

It's common knowledge that once someone mentions Nazis the flamewar is
over. As obtuse as I can be, and as laterally as I can think, I can't
quite work out how to mention Nazis, especially for the 2nd point. Nazis
have as much to do with Linux as they do with ADSL.

Damn - I think I've done it myself :-P
