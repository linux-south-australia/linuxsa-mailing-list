Paul,

This sounds like an excellent idea.  I have been meaning to speak to
someone at Endeavour college about running "Generation Linux", which I
will be running again this year for National Science Week. Just an idea
anyway.

&gt; Greetings,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like some suggestions and feedback on what people would like
&gt; to see in a community Linux course.
&gt; 
&gt; Endeavour college (Mawson Lakes) is running computing courses in the
&gt; evenings, starting in term 2. (I'll have to go and look the start date up :-)
&gt; Currently these are for Microsoft Applications, running on their PC's.
&gt; 
&gt; I have spoken to the organiser of these, and there is the possibility
&gt; of running a Linux or 'Linux' application course.
&gt; 
&gt; The other courses are in the order of $60 for 8 hours.
&gt; (1 night a week over 4 weeks)
&gt; 
&gt; The options are: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Configfest [ May be the most helpful for Linux Community ] 
&gt;    - Bring your machine along and let us help you get the most out of it.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Starting with Linux
&gt;    - Use Sarah B's installing Linux mini-howto to install and configure linux.
&gt;  
&gt; 3. Using Applications under Linux [ Very Basic ]
&gt;    - Netscape
&gt;    - Star Office
&gt; 
&gt; People would have to bring in their own machines, and this would be
&gt; reflected in a reduced cost of the course.  This may fit in nicely, if
&gt; the same night is used for another computer class.  (There are other
&gt; rooms available.)
&gt;
