&gt; Give me a break, want to know what I think Mark, I think you are
&gt; speaking the
&gt; employer speak, you have not the faintest clue about, or interest
&gt; in, real issues
&gt; and are simply justifying a business point (model) and using a
&gt; weak argument to
&gt; boot.

Very odd, Stephen... Very odd indeed.

May I suggest that we lay this to rest now? I think that we all know that
there are some ISPs out there who offer unlimited bandwidth deals, and
people who want them can use them. I think we also know that there are some
ISPs out there that don't offer these deals, and if that is how they choose
to do their business, then let them be. How a particular ISP decides to do
business is their own business, and if they want to risk making a loss on
some accounts for the purpose of gaining marketshare, or gaining accounts
where they don't make a loss, then good on them. If their gamble doesn't pay
off, then either they fold, or they find ways to make those accounts more
profitable. There are no two ways around this -- as has been said
previously, Fast, Good, Cheap... pick any two. This goes for both customers
and providers -- providers choose what compromise they provide, gambling
that there will be enough customers to take them up, and customers choose a
provider that matches their needs.

One thing that it would be good for us all to remember here is that there is
no point at all in running a loss-making business, and the corollory of
that: there's no such thing as a free lunch. Likewise, by the way, there's
little point in working for a loss-making company, or even in doing business
with one, especially if you require ongoing service and support. If the
company is losing money, then at some stage, it will run out and cease to
employ or provice service, and will cease to fulfill your needs as an
employee or customer. Of course, in some situations, it doesn't matter so
much if a business you are a customer of goes out of business -- for eg, if
Shell started an all-you-can-eat petrol system, I'd use it if it saved me
money, regardless of whether it caused the bankruptcy of Shell, because
changing to Mobil or BP for filling up my car is trivial. However, if I were
a major transport company, it may matter to me quite a lot, as I would have
developed a business arrangement with Shell, due to the fact that I buy so
much fuel, and if they were to fold, I would have to invest a lot of time
and money in renegotiating with Mobil or BP... It's the same with data.

Finally, I think some people are still missing the point about things
costing more here than in the USA. As Mr Hackett said, it's largely due to
geography. It's one of the costs of living in Australia, and it's
unavoidable. Of course, the history of Telstra in Australia makes this
situation somewhat worse, but fixing that won't solve everything.

all MHO.
