&gt; It doesn't matter what platforms you offer support for, because the
&gt; fact is that computers are very complicated, probably infinitely so,
&gt; and I don't understand how any business can afford to say, "ask us and
&gt; we'll give you the answers."
&gt; 
&gt; Suppose you only support Windows, and the customer complains that
&gt; their browser keeps crashing: is that included?  Suppose the browser is
&gt; Opera: is that included?  Suppose they use Outlook express for mail,
&gt; and the modem disconnects when they poll for mail while viewing IBM's
&gt; research page if they also have Ultima Online running with an UO Assist
&gt; macroing in the background with sound turned off and a MP3 playing:
&gt; But that's not how it would be described; it would be described as
&gt; "the modem keeps disconnecting and I never have that trouble when I
&gt; connect through rebel.net."  How do you support that for "free"?  How do
&gt; you get a subscriber who doesn't that sort of support to pay for it?
&gt; It is bundled, after all.

The middle letter of the acronym ISP stands for Service.
This si a lrge part of what ISPs (as opposed to IAP internet access
providers) do.

They provide service.

What they often do to reduce the complexity of issues such as above is
define exactly what sort of support they provide.

Eg we support Internet explorer 3-5, Outlook Express 3-5, Nescape 4-4.7
and Eudora.

We support Win 95/98, Mac OS system 8.5+.

That makes it somehwat easier by reducing the scope for problems they
have to support.

Sometimes they limit the amount of support they provide, to a certain
number of minutes per user per period.

Most support problems that are user related occur during inital
install/configuration, so to help reduce that they supply software to
configure the user system(or supported user systems) to reduce the
problems associated with the intial install configuration.

Many also charge joining fees, part of which presumably factors in the
cost of supporting the user through that inital set up/configuration.

Hardware and application problems are often referred to toethe supplier
or the publisher.

Once set up the majoprity of users dont require much support.

It is not at all surprising that ISP provide this service, after all they
are service providers.

It is economically viable with a reasonable scale, and it is very much
required if you want to attract average normal peopel as users.

The only tricky part ifs finding people with the patiencte of saints and
the tact of... a very tactfull person, to tell users that we cnat help you
with yuour prointer, you need to see the shop you bought it from.
