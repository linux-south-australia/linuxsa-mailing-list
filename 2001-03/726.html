 &gt; What is the point of ADSL if we only use up the same quota as we had

Ian:  How do you think it'd be economically possible to do anything
else?  Your bytes are using the same channels to get to you;  the only
differences between dialup and ADSL are the line card your local loop
is plugged in to at the exchange, the modem you're using at your
end, and the fact that ADSL requires a $100,000 DSLAM in your exchange
area and a Frame Relay service into Telstra's ADSL core.

The retail cost of ADSL is comparable to the retail cost of high-end
dialup plans.  Yet you're using resources which cost 2 or 3 times more
than what it costs for a provider to provision dialup resources.  So
why on earth do you think you should get larger numbers of (expensive)
megabytes thrown in for free?

If your imagination can't come up with a reason why a 24-hour-per-day
broadband connection would be useful, perhaps you're not ready for ADSL.
When you have a couple of megabits per second to play with, though,
it really changes the way you use the Internet.  It becomes just another
utility, like telephone, power and gas -- it's always there, it's 
always useful, you use it in ways you'd never use a dialup link.  Your
email is always there, a web browser always brings up URLs in seconds
without needing to wait for modems to train-up.  "You know you're a
geek when you get up at 3 in the morning to go to the toilet, and on
your way back to bed you stop and check your email."

See a URL on TV that looks interesting?  Check it out during the ad, 
with no call charges, no dialup delays, and enough speed to give you
time to check it out before the ad finishes.  Want to look up a friend's
phone number?  www.whitepages.com.au is *always* there;  I haven't taken
the shrink-wrap off a phone book for 2 years now.  Want to download software?
It takes a minute instead of fifteen minutes.  And Napster is just totally
different when you can be running ten transfers at 20 Kbytes/second each.
Do you have a social group of friends you want to keep in touch with?
Set up majordomo and run a mailing list for them; you can do it because
you're permanently connected.

I've had a broadband Internet link for over a year now, and I can attest
to the way it changes things.  I use about 300 Mbytes/month.  Yes, I could
have a dialup link and use the same amount of data (indeed, I used to
have a permanent dialup, and I did use the same amount of data on it).
But the difference the speed makes isn't just confined to the ability
to leech warez at a megabit per second.

 &gt; I don't understand.  I am not that impatient to view Slashdot every
 &gt; morning.
 &gt; Take air travel for Austrlian businesses for example - it is a huge
 &gt; expense - that and international phone calls.
 &gt; This was meant to cut those costs through video-conferencing etc -
 &gt; not add another cost.

No, that is manifestly false.  Video conferencing has never been a
touted application of ADSL, and I don't know where you got the idea
that it was.

Always keep in mind that Telstra has an immensely profitable "wideband"
division providing services to businesses.  In their eyes, the fact that
ADSL can be used to put megabits per second into business premises is
an unhappy incedental outcome they'd prefer that people didn't notice. 
They've positioned ADSL as a residential service.

You're now talking about a business application.  If you're a business,
the wholesaler would like you to rush out and buy a $4000 per month
Megalink and pay $19.8c/Mbyte to Big Pond, then do all the videoconferencing
you want.  Or, even better, you can pay a simply inconceivable amount of
money per month for a dedicated non-Internet videoconferencing link
between two cities;  your Telstra sales rep would send you flowers if
you bought one of those.

ADSL gives these people the screaming heebie-jeebies.  They have no idea
how to deal with it, in technological terms or in marketting terms.
