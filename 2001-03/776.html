&gt; Ian, Stephen and anybody else who believes unlimited data is possible:
&gt; explain how ISPs can offer that?  Wanting it so doesn't make it so.  Give
&gt; us the financial model.  (I did, and it doesn't support your position.)
&gt; 

A per bandwidth pipe(as opposed to a per meg) divided by the number of
users + the cost of the port per user.

Per bandwidth pipes _are_ avaiable.

It may be an expensive account, to lower the cost you can make some use of
network traffics burstiness(ie it is not likely that all users dialed in
at a given instant wilbe using all of their bandwidth) and overseubscrube
the pipe with more ports than a 1 to 1 mapping.

Eg if you have a 1 meg link and your users access via a 100kmachanism, you
dont have 10 simlultaneous users, you have say 13.
(nice factors of 10 used for convenience).

Ideally if you can get a good mix of business and home users, so you uage
is evenaly spread througout the day ( this seems to be difficult to achive
in most cases - probalby esier when big than small).

Eg 256k of upstream bandwidth $2850 - 3 month old pricing from a national
bandwidth provider, I beleive wholly owned by a international carrier.
I reckon you can get about 20 simulatneous users(12800 bits per sec per
user - rememebr network bursty on average) on this, so say we can support
about 200 users at 10:1 user:modem.
From what I have seen, for every few hundred users, you get 10 or 15 that
really suck the traffic, but this was pre napster days. Still not all
users are napster users, or linux iso collectors. 

A lot of people seems happy to read email, chat on irc and surf the web,
with an occasional explicit file download.

$130 per month per modem, so $2600 for ports - based on David's assesment.
$2600 ports
$2850 bandwidth
$1000 per month carriage from nap to office based on David's assesment- 
you can possibly do it cheaper at least you canpossibly do it cheaper
right now.
$6450 total

$40(ex gst) per user per month? Seems reasonable from a user perspective(
I personally pay $53 per month with a 1.5gig cap with free local Saix
traffic for a 56k connection with a 4 hour minimum session time but other
wise unlimited hours and think this is reasonable - and they are still in
business after at least 5 years and still growing, and reporting a
profit).

$8000 income, actual costs of network infastructure and traffic $6450.
This of course does not include 
Gross surplus about $1550 monthly.

This does not include the cost of border or core routers, software
upgrades, servers for Radius, web hosting, mail, logging, DNS and a
thousand other things.
Also does not include wages.
Also it does not include stuff like perring, caching, makeing and effort
to get the user to use local content where possible(think ozbytes and
senet), agkami(??).
But let's peretend they(ie the potential cost savers) make no difference.

It does not mean the users will have gallons of bandwidth gauranteed or
never have a busy signal - they probably will have  busy singal and the
download speeds willikely drop at times to less thatn their current
connection can practiacally handle(lets not even bother with
raely if ever seen theoretical capability). But it does mean that
while they are online they can suck as much as the network can supply
them.
Ie it is not fast and good, it is cheap(ish) and good.
It seems highly unlikely you will get a service that is fast, cheap and
good. I rekcon in the current climate you can have any two.
This scenario is for those that want cheap and good at least a resonable
copromise between the two.

But they were not required criteria a sustainable model for unlimited user
data was the model.

I think using this model you could run a reasonable performance operation
for reasonable price with data unlimited by constraints directly imposed
by the account structure/product.

However this is a very small scale operation. Greater scale I think
will lead to greater efficiencies, and more reuse of exisitng
infastructur(eg your 2  radius servers per pop can prvbably handle 
10,000 users as well as 200 users), if you have chosen your infastructure
carefully to start wit and planned for growth.

I think if you scale it up say 100 or 200 times(still only a medium  ISP
by aussie standards, and probably small compared to other "western"/first
(ish) world nations) you could make a profit over a period of time.

You do of course need the intial investment and understand that you might
not make your money back in the first 3 years(although with reasoanble
growth this may be possible).
