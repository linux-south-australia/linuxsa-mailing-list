Hi.

Disclaimer: I'm no expert, others here are, and I think you've been told
before, but anyway:

1. I would have thought that your firewall was not your server. If you
have 5 computers there, one should be the firewall, and do virtually
nuffin else. There are many ways to achieve this, and filesystem damage
should not be a big risk - you could use one of the router distro's and
boot it from a floppy. Run no fans or HD's on the box (or monitor) and it
would run for hours on a small ups.

2. Keep all the logfiles on your server, using remote syslog to get them
there from all the 'at risk from etsa' boxen, and the firewall.

3. Put a larger ups on the server (or 2) - some of the ups can be extended
with bigger batteries - you could extend the life to a couple of hours
without a huge amount of trouble.

4. Go ahead, reiser the whole lot if you are game.

This way, you should lower the risk to your data from security breaches
and power glitches. The remote syslog will tell you exactly what was
happening when the power went out because your server will still be up.

&gt; &gt; &gt; "Tony Gunthorp at VA Linux showed me something very impressive: he killed
&gt; &gt; &gt; the power on his Linux laptop (without doing a clean shutdown - blasphemy!)
&gt; &gt; &gt; and when rebooting the filesystem rebuilt itself within seconds with zero
&gt; &gt; &gt; errors. The reboot skipped right past fsck.ext2,"
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Has anyone on the list tried this? (the URL above has lots of tips and
&gt; &gt; &gt; caveats, but is about 12 months old, so no doubt things have moved along a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes. It works very well. I haven't tried it on a 2.4 kernel, but 2.2
&gt; &gt; works very well (our mail servers, file servers and soon our proxy
&gt; &gt; server all enjoy reiserfs partitions). 
&gt; 
&gt; Great. I had been thinking that thie reiserfs was too experimental to
&gt; use for all partitions. 
&gt; Is it available in SuSE installation scripts as an option alongside
&gt; ext2fs? If so, it seems like ext2fs will eventually be replaced by reiserfs,
&gt; unless there's something lacking in reiserfs.
&gt; 
&gt; So my plan now is to get a UPS, get an old Pentium, install a brand new OS
&gt; (with 2.4.0 kernel), set up all the firewall/server stuff. 
&gt; And then I have two lines of defence: the UPS _and_ the file system.
&gt; 
&gt; But then what do I do with the other 5 computers?
&gt; I guess they're less at risk because they don't continuously generate
&gt; log files. 
&gt; It seems to be only the files which are currently open for writing
&gt; which are candidates for very nasty destruction when the power goes off.
&gt; And a firewall/server (mine at least) has dozens of such log files.
&gt; So probably I'll be fairly safe if I just defend the 
&gt; gateway=firewall+server computer.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, now it's time to go out and get a UPS.
&gt; Jaycar don't have them anymore in Adealide, by the way....
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
