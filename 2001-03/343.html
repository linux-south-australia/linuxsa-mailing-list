Hi,
I bought a SOLA 520 Rackmount for a client to run on OS/2.

I have a few issues with them, but they are cheap, work & are made in
Australia.

The problem of support is exactly that, a problem. They *do* have some
good people in Head Office, (David Mayson), who was kind enough to fax
the complete cable/protocol specs.
It is a management policy of not supporting their products.

I found a company, (Tripplite), that had written a generic,
client/server UPS monitoring program, that had the ability to create
custom scripts for *any* UPS providing you had the protocol specs.

I think manufacturers need to be a little more flexible, a cheap way to
get support for a product is to offer the product to private developers
for a reduced rate.

"Hey, we can't afford to pay an engineer to develop software for
platform X, but if you want to do it we could:
Offer a loan unit for development.
Offer the unit at a reduced rate."

I think a lot of people would flock to buy hardware with this sort of
incentive.
Obviously there is legal intellectual property issues but the above has
happened.

An avid OS/2 fan who worked as an engineer for a TV card manufacturer
sucessfully negotiated with Management to write OS/2 drivers for the
company's card. The Boss essentially said, "Well if it doesn't cost us
anything, I suppose its not a bad idea".

So, if the below document interests people please email me off list &
I'll arrange to send you a copy.
Perhaps also write a letter to David Mayson's Boss, Peter, thanking
David for this information.
Make it clear that handing out technical specs *is* good for business.

&gt; The UPS itself (325) seems fine - I am very pleased with that.
&gt; 
&gt; I am just a little disappointed that after being informed by sales people and Sola themselves that Linux / Unix support is available - I still had to figure out most things myself and they still can not tell me how to utilise the advanced features.
