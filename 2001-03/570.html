&gt;Abuse of "Unlimited" Internet plans would be one reason I would support pay
&gt;for bandwidth. In my own situation, I have an Unlimited plan, and I
download
&gt;a lot of data, but, I am always conscience of where I'm downloading from.

That's most of the problem, with an unlimited product in a free market (free
as in choice), you shouldn't have to be concious of what you're doing unless
it affects you or the local laws (or maybe a contract that affects you
enforced by local laws).

&gt;Most of my Data would come through peering networks, or local servers ...
&gt;this is why I don't like having to pay for my bandwidth, as I know in 90%
of
&gt;situations my data isn't actually costing my ISP(s) next to nothing. It
&gt;would be nice to see some ISP's offering unlimited downloads for cached /
&gt;local / peering network data ...

This would be great and would probably cost less for many people than an
unlimited account while giving them better value. The main problem is that
measuring this usage is difficult to do in scale. Currently access servers
spit out a single Acct-Output-Octets (if you're using radius) that measures
the total amount of data sent through the dialup port to the customer. To
charge for traffic based on it's source means doing per-customer IP
accounting at all gateways to the network, or using something like netramet
or netflow in the path to the customer. These add problems of scale (how do
you do simultaneous accounting for hundreds of customers from a number of
sources without missing a packet) and reliability, since you generally have
to force traffic through a single system in addition to the existing points
of failure. There are also ways of cheating systems setup like this, and
innacuracies that can come from asynchronous routing.

Additional problems come from other confusing data collection points like
ISP cache and mail servers. You're fetching different data from a single
group of IP's, so differentiated charging becomes an application-level
activity. Don't forget that there's a cost for running the cache too, so
even cached data isn't free. It's even more confusing at the mail server
where you might pickup the same message more than once, or delete a message
from the server unread .. who pays for what where?

For thousands of customers, the above represents something of a challenge to
put together, and would be even more of a challenge to implement at a &lt;$30
price point. It would probably cost a similar amount to do this sort of
charging for a $30 dialup account or a $20000/month ethernet connection.
