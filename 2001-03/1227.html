Ian!

&gt; I have searched the Linuxsa archives and found the
&gt; following (my apologies to the authors Benjamin and
&gt; Toby for violating SA legislation by not seeking prior
&gt; approval befor quoting - I hope this is okay)

It probably isn't. Let's sue your ass off :-P

&gt; I will be following these instructions at home -
&gt; although I worry about corruption.  Does anyone have
&gt; any pointers before I go ahead?  Any warnings or
&gt; experiences to share?

When using hdparm read the man page. Very carefully. And more than once.
I buggered up my system totally and it was just before one of my backup
cycles and I lost about 900MB of downloads. It doesn't sound much, but I
have a "cheap", "reliable" ISP so downloading them again (and
rebuilding) was not at all fun.

&gt; &gt; run "hdparm /dev/hda"
&gt; &gt; and see what it says.
&gt; &gt; You may then want to try increasing the speed with the following
&gt; &gt; commands
&gt; &gt; hdparm -a16 /dev/hda &lt;-- read ahead
&gt; &gt; hdparm -m16 /dev/hda &lt;-- multiread sectors
&gt; &gt; hdparm -c3 /dev/hda &lt;--32 bit w/sync transfers

If I recall correctly, there are some things that are guaranteed to
speed your system up and other things which may or may not depending on
what you do the most. For example, setting UDMA on inevitably speeds
disk access up whilst setting multiread on my Western Digital Drive
doesn't make a difference and it can have a detrimental affect on my
system. Reason is mentioned in the man page.

Whatever you do, don't do it on a mission critical system. Don't do it
without backups unless you're willing to lose ALL of your data. And if
you do crash, and need our help, get yourself a copy of Tom's Bootdisk
or some other rescue disk because you're gonna have to get into your
system somehow.
