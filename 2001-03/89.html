Interesting article at The Register based on IDC counts
of shipments of operating systems for 2000

  <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/17273.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/17273.html</A>

The Reg cuts the market into desktop and server.

Desktop:
  Microsoft family: 92% (up 3% from 1999)
  Linux distributions: 2% (up)
  Mac and others: down

The figures understate desktop Linux as there was not
a full year of sales where manufacturers had Linux
preinstalled on their PCs.  But even double gives
Microsoft a comfortable dominance.

Server:
  Windows family: 41%
  Linux distributions: 27%
  Other Unix: 14% (from 17% in 1999)
  Netware: 17% (from 19% in 1999)

But the article suggests that the more interesting ways of writing
the server figures are:

  Windows family: 41%
  Unix family: 41%
  Netware: 17%

A "Unix family" classification assumes that a lot of the reason
for the fall in commercial Unix is that people are substituting
Linux.

The marketing people may prefer the ranking of server OS shipments:
  1. Linux
  2. Windows 2000
  3. Windows NT
but this is unfair to Win2k, which didn't have a full year of sales.

And there's a huge caveat about Linux, not noted in the
article: the figures are for *shipments* not *installations*.
A Linux vendor can ship one CD which is then used to install
Linux on all the enterprise's Linux computers.

Similarly, no company collects the download statistics for
the various Linux CD images held on the AARNet mirror.
So Australia's main source of the Linux operating system
CDs isn't counted in the official "shipment" figures.
I imagine that this is also the same for similar sites
overseas.

I'd suggest that this undercounting comforably makes the
"unix family" the largest operating system technology
installed in 2000.

I suddenly understand why Microsoft is worried.

Finally, you shouldn't confuse "shipments" with "installed
base".  For example, the installed base includes a lot
of Win95 machines, an operating system with zero shipments
in 2000.
