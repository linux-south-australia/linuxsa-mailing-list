What is it with you and the whole 'ISP owner' camp?

Do I need to spell it out? I am no longer talking about
'unlimited accounts' and I have already told you that I
am quite happy to pay once for caching so that others to use what I have already downloaded.  I made some
incorrect assumptions and I have corrected them.
Please advise me directly if you require me to remind
you once per day.

Why are you people so passionate about shooting this
argument down that I have to re-state what I have
already said 3 or 4 times before you listen?

Are you afraid of something?  Hiding something?  Why
are you attacking us and forgetting that we have
listened to you and changed our position?

Most people are going through Telstra anyhow.  I have
spoken to many people who use Telstra and they have
not had any troubles when the devil posesses them and
they go on a leaching rampage for a night.

If this is the level of fear and hostility that I would
recieve from a local ISP when I ask questions or make
suggestions - why should I support a local ISP?

I would have thought - unless there is some sort of
status quo that you need to protect - that you would
have supported us if we came up with ideas that can
lower costs for ISPs and we were trying to help you as
well as ourselves.
