&gt; If anyone had thought this was a trivial thread, it looks like David just took it to
&gt; new depths.
&gt; So what I said was (libelous), just between you and me David, liable has to do with
&gt; the truth or untruth of something :-)
&gt;
&gt; Frankly I believe David's responses to this thread indicate his unwillingness to act
&gt; in a manner that is suitable for all levels of users on this list.  It is also my
&gt; belief that until he does so LinuxSA will not grow or nurture new users in a manner
&gt; the community of LinuxSA  users deserve.
&gt;
&gt; His words speak volumes.
&gt;
&gt; And thanks for all the private mail too people, I will note give up on this,
&gt; LinuxSA deserves better
&gt;
&gt; Steve
&gt;
&gt; PS  If posts of his type continue, I am happy to start a new LinuxSA (or other)
&gt; mailing list and a new web-site that that is more proactive in SA, I shall keep you
&gt; posted.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not a piece of computer code we are writing here, we deal with real
&gt; &gt; &gt; people with different fears, aspirations, strengths and weaknesses.  If you
&gt; &gt; &gt; fail to see how your post was bullshit, even though lots of people agreed with
&gt; &gt; &gt; my observation, then you have been in front of a computer way too long.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Obviously you are confused between "lots" and "a few."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I take exception when you say that what I posted was bullshit.  If you
&gt; &gt; claimed that it was a harsh way of putting the truth I would not argue.
&gt; &gt; But you say what I said was bullshit.  Bullshit, like crap, implies
&gt; &gt; an inaccuracy.  This is the second time you have made this (libelous)
&gt; &gt; claim.  I asked you before what was inaccurate and you did not reply.
&gt; &gt; Are you knowingly and willfully accusing me of inaccuracy when you know
&gt; &gt; what I said to be correct?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you [are] incapable of providing help [...] in a manner suitable for
&gt; &gt; &gt; humans don't reply, we will figure out the answer without you
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I provide help in a manner emminently suitable for humans.  How ridiculous
&gt; &gt; to imply otherwise.  As to figuring out the answer without me: That's
&gt; &gt; equally ridiculous, because it's self-evident; even though the point in
&gt; &gt; question is a recurring mistake...  But Stephen, if you don't want to
&gt; &gt; hear my pearls of wisdom, don't let me stand between you and the door.
&gt; &gt; (Please close it quietly behind you.)
