&gt; &gt; You seem to have missed the point, which was not one company writing a
&gt; &gt; similar product to another's, rather it was that Stallman incites people
&gt; &gt; to steal intellectual property.
&gt; 
&gt; No, you seem to be have an odd notion of "theft", if nothing else. 
&gt; Stallman isn't saying that people need to write free replacements which 
&gt; work via the exactly same process, nor is he encouraging people to 
&gt; illegally copy source code or algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; He *is* saying people should write free replacements for non-free 
&gt; software, replacements which perform the same tasks as the non-free 
&gt; counterpart. Compare Adobe's Photoshop to the GIMP. They do the same 
&gt; thing, but via a completely different process, and absolutely no IP has 
&gt; been infringed. This is what Stallman is talking about.

Could come close to copyright infringement though. A lot of free
software comes close here -- this is the major bugbear that many
companies have with free software. They spend $$$ researching User
Interfaces, and other easily-copied things (like which tools are useful
in Photoshop), and then GPL programs just copy them. Even worse, they
imitate the very names of the programs, to capitalise (at least, from
the capitalists' point of view) on the marketing put into the closed
software.

GIMP looking and acting like photoshop is no different to if Corel DRAW
looked and acted like photoshop -- it would come under attention for
copyright infringement. Of course, if it was called "PictureShop" or
"Fotoshop" or something, it would be under even more pressure. Isn't
this where KWord got into trouble? Certainly, the tradition of clever
names for free software could land them in trouble simply for copyright
infringement.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Stallman would have that Sharpe could charge *just one* client for the
&gt;  &gt; work, after which he would give it freely away.
&gt; 
&gt; No. Stallman would prefer that Sharpe lincense the source code under 
&gt; what he considers to be a free (as in "libre") license, such as the GPL. 
&gt; The GPL places no requirements on how someone distributes (read: 
&gt; "sells") the program, neither does RMS.

Surely you've missed David's point here? You've merely presented the
more extreme view, which backs up what he's saying. Can you imagine
trying to recoup $20 Million or so in development costs for a program
that has a small market? Don't think "GIMP" here, think Vertical
Integration -- Like Oil Rig Control Software (ORCS) or something. GIMP
is not a valid comparison in this case, as there are millions of people
willing to pay $20 to get a convenient CD. Sure, something like ORCS
would have a market of maybe a hundred companies, with a few thousand
rigs maximum. GPLing your ORCS is not going to let you recoup the
Millions you invested in it in the first place.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Stallman would have it that we, the programming community,
&gt; &gt; would have a duty to write an open source replacement for Sharpe's team's
&gt; &gt; hard-won algorithms.
&gt; 
&gt; Where is the problem with that? If someone writes some software that 
&gt; does the exact same thing, but in an entirely different manner, then 
&gt; what's the problem? Again, think Photoshop vs. the GIMP here.

There's still the innovation in actually coming up with the concept of
"Photoshop", the UI, the Market itself, and all of that. Many would
claim that this is the true innovation -- all the rest is merely
software engineering.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; For those amongst us who are hung up on property,
&gt; &gt; but unable to see the intellectual part (he he), that is the sort of
&gt; &gt; theft that I despise.
&gt; 
&gt; Could I suggest you're so hung up on the property, that you're unable to 
&gt; see the intellectual part?

Personally, I'm just well hung.

ahem!

I'm not sure I follow the point of either of those sentences :)

&gt; &gt; No, Richard, not to *allow* progress, but to *encourage* it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But now they are *impeding* progress.

This is definitely true.

Patents and Copyright etc were created to encourage (foster, promote,
etc) progress, and they are now often impeding progress.
