I think Ive got this sussed. There doesnt seem to be any info on the net
stating this though, and as this list is archived on the web, and
thus cached in google, I thought i'd post the answer here.

Problem: you need to set a non-standard baud rate (in this case 5720).

from generic_serial.c (kernel serial driver):
--------------------------------------------------------
        else if ((port-&gt;flags & ASYNC_SPD_MASK) == ASYNC_SPD_CUST)
            baudrate = (port-&gt;baud_base / port-&gt;custom_divisor);
    }

    /* I recommend using THIS instead of the mess in termios (and
       duplicating the above code). Next we should create a clean
       interface towards this variable. If your card supports arbitrary
       baud rates, (e.g. CD1400 or 16550 based cards) then everything
       will be very easy..... */
    port-&gt;baud = baudrate;
--------------------------------------------------------

So, what they are saying is that your normal 16550 uart can just take a
speed setting of what ever speed you tell it, yet the kernel API sucks
and doesnt allow you to just set one.

However, the driver just does a divion of baud_base/custom_divisor. So,
if you were to set baud_base=5720 and divisor=1, then you have kludged
the API to get your speed to the baudrate variable in the kernal!

Disclaimer: I havnt tryed this yet :)

&gt; I'm trying to develp a smartcard program for linux. The cavet is that my
&gt; smartcard device uses a 3.58mhz crystal, where as the smartcard expects
&gt; a 6mhz clock. This means that the cards sense of time is somewhat
&gt; skewed, and its idea of 9600,8,E,2 is really 5720,8,E,2. I have programs
&gt; that work under windows fine (and even wine under linux), they just call
&gt; a serial set speed type function with "5720" and bingo, its set. Under
&gt; linux however, it seems a little trickyer...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any idea how to do this in C, or if not, with serserial?
&gt; (since I have its source). As far as I can tell, I need to set spd_cust
&gt; divisor 20, as 115200/20=~5720. The code in set serial doesnt seem to
&gt; support a divisor with decimals, as to get a real 5720 would require a
&gt; divisor of 20.13986013986014.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, it seems relevant to baud_base, which seems to be 115200 although
&gt; it depends on the crystal speed on the serial card. I dont know how to
&gt; verify this, as I suspect this might be whats wrong. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any experience with these kinds of serial operation, or
&gt; can give me some pointer to docs with relevant levels of info? (the
&gt; serial programming howto is a joke if you dont want a normal 8,N,1
&gt; setting).
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
