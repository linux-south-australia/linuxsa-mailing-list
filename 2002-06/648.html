All,

Could I also ask what "TechnoCash" is.  I've seen it listed on the
everythinglinux.com.au site but it's details display in flashplayer and my
employer doesn't like flashplayer or ActiveX, etc., due to the possibilities
of embedded viruses.

Regards,
Dez

Subject: Online payments advice [Scanned For Viruses]

Using Linux of course, so as not to be off-topic :-) In fact I think this
is a general topic of interest to computerheads because we're always
buying and selling bits and pieces.

I'm selling some (Linux-related, &lt;whew&gt;) gear online, and though I've
always resisted it in the past some people really want to pay me
personally by credit card. I've never used Paypal, but I notice that
besides a substantial delay in retrieving funds there seem to be a lot of
people on the net claiming that Paypal have ripped them off to the tune of
many thousands or that their funds were held for many months.

So I went looking for alternatives. The most relevant Australian one I
found has a very humourous front page
(<A HREF="http://www.standardtransactions.com.au">http://www.standardtransactions.com.au</A> ) so I quickly skipped that one,
and I arrived at Billpoint (ebay's own, but capped at AUD1000 maximum
transaction for ordinary accounts, which is too low) and Yahoo Paydirect
(<A HREF="http://paydirect.yahoo.com">http://paydirect.yahoo.com</A>) which seems a bit light on details about
fees. There's a promising-sounding one run by a real bank (Citibank in the
US) instead of these dotcom pretend-to-be-banks, but unfortunately its
site <A HREF="http://www.c2it.com">http://www.c2it.com</A> is down. So far the best I can come up with is to
take the credit card details to someone who already has a merchant
agreement with a bank (eg a shopkeeper) and ask them to put it through for
a small fee (if that's not proscribed by their contract with the bank.)

Can anyone point me to a better service than those listed above?

Thanks,
