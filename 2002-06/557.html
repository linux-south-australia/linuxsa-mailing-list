Almost.

You really should bring the live linux box down to single user to do
this, or at least make sure that there is nothing that is writing to
the disk at the time...

Also, tar works by getting data and inodes, then re-creating them on
the target filesystem. You will have to create the filesystem(s) on
the new machine prior to untarring. Also note that tar only gets
files, not boot blocks etc, so you'll have to boot from something and
then re-run lilo.

dd or dump may make things easier for you -- I think dump still
requires you to create partitions and re-run lilo, but dd will do
everything exactly the same -- but make sure you have a big enough
drive (and remember that your partitioning will be _exactly_ the same
as on the old drive...

Whatever you do, make sure you make the backup on a system with
nothing writing to the drive, and that you test it before relying on
it.

&gt; 
&gt; I could use ghost, but i was wondering if it's possible using tar or
&gt; something so as to not down the server everytime to disupt users for an hour
&gt; at a time while i ghost off.  the 'servers' are actual a router or two, dial
&gt; up servers etc with heaps of disc space on the drive so there's room to tar.
&gt; 

if you have two drives in them, you can mirror the drives using
software RAID 1, and then, after much messing about and so on, you can
actually have it so that you can remove one drive, put it in another
machine, and run it as a single drive machine (well, running a
degraded RAID 1 mirror), or rebuild a RAID from it.


&gt; I made a directory called /t and from inside the directory did a:
&gt; tar czfv all.tgz /* --exclude /t
&gt; 
&gt; this seems to work nicely.  but, to get this restored, do i plug in the
&gt; Redhat CD and make the partition using fdisk or something and then tar from
&gt; a CD image or something.  I might add that this drive only has the root
&gt; partition on the drive to keep things simple.  i know that if the drive
&gt; fills it will crash, but the drive is pretty big and i keep an eye on it to
&gt; make sure it won't happen (not to mention having gigabytes of free space to
&gt; play with).

yeah, boot from something, use fdisk, then mkfs, then tar, then lilo,
then test, then fix whatever didn't work, rinse and repeat. ;)

&gt; 
&gt; any ideas people?
&gt; thanks

&gt; 
&gt; I tried Norton Ghost about this time last year and had some problems
&gt; with Linux disk copying.
&gt; From memory, my problem was that whilst the partition data was copied
&gt; ok, the boot sectors for ext2 partitions weren't. (I confirmed this at
&gt; the time by viewing the actual bytes stored on each disk).
&gt; 
&gt; I ended up using the dd command exactly as you suggest and that worked
&gt; infallibly, many times over.

&gt; &gt; Try dd.  The basic command would be something like this

&gt; &gt; Be careful, though :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Alternativaly, hard disk duplication is made very easy with products like
&gt; &gt; Norton Ghost.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It understands FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ext2, etc and can duplicate partitions
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; resize automatically.  The latest version can also transfer images or
&gt; &gt; duplicate hard drives over LPT, USB (require host-to-host cable) or TCP/IP
&gt; &gt; (requires NDIS or packet driver) and supports some CD-Burners.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is run by booting from floppy (PC or MSDOS).  It has a nice GUI but
&gt; also
&gt; &gt; a very powerful command line interface.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; I want to make a copy of a Hard Drive. What products can I
&gt; &gt;  &gt; use to do this?
