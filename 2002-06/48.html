Hi all,

I just got home and noticed something odd.

My X login had logged out "automatically" for me while I was out.  I
know for a fact that I was logged in when I left, as I never log out
anymore.  The screen saver was running and the screen switched off.

Before anyone asks, the cat was out (I let her in when i came home) and
there was no way anybody was in the house (unless they broke in just to
log me out).

The really interesting part is that the XDM login screen had a small
logo-type image at the top left corner of the screen.  It looked like an
image of two people, but I couldn't make it out because it was pretty
grainy and the colours were all messed up.  The image was in a nice 3D
frame and all - looked like it had been put there deliberately.

I switched to a console screen quickly to have a look at the logs, and
they show the logout happening about 2 minutes before I got home (can
see where the open terminal session was closed).  When I came back to
the X screen the little image was gone.

I wasn't connected to the net at the time, so I don't know what
happened.  The uptime is still sitting at something like 9 days so it
wasn't a power failure, or any sort of reboot.

For the record, I'm running Suse 7.3 with the NVidia drivers patch
installed.  Not a lot has changed from the base install.

Does Suse or X or KDE enforce some kind of auto-logout after a fixed
period of no activity?  I haven't seen anything like this, even though
I've left the machine logged in overnight a lot and it's been OK.

Has anyone seen anything like this before?  It's got me a little spooked
because I wouldn't normally expect something like this to happen under
Linux.

Cheers,
Adam
