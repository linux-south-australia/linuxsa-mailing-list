&gt; Nah, Im in hills area, and I need a masthead amp. The signal strength is

&gt; amp). It amps up the signal, and filters the non-tv frequenceys, and the
&gt; picture improves to somewhere between good and passable. It does also
&gt; amp any interfearance unfortunatly, but theres nothing you can do about
&gt; that - at least the signal gets back up to the usable range. Now when

&gt; abc, sbs, and 7 digitally from sat (mmm.. now they look perfect, and I
&gt; get them 30 mins ahead of time, if I miss something and want to take

Hmm, but that would imply that your television/vcr/linux-tv-card doesn't use
any filtering itself. Surely thats not the case?

I thought the snow you get was genuine noise on the same frequencies as the
tv channels are upon, and thats why i didn't think amplification was a
useful tool unless your signal loss/interference occured inbetween the
antenna and your receivers.

But i haven't got any real experience in this area so i could be totally
wrong. I'm interested to know the logic behind the wrongness though.
