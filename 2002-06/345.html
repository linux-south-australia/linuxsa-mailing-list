&gt; Ok I will rephrase it
&gt; My friend is fortunate enough to have 2 connections 1 he pays for BPA and
&gt; one he is given netspace.
&gt; he wants to direct all traffic from the lan directed to any of the BPA
&gt; servers via the BPA link
&gt; and the remainder via the netspace link.
&gt; 
&gt; He wants to funnel all (free) BPA traffic which could be to multiple IP
&gt; addresses to the BPA link as it's faster. But doesn't want to go out of
&gt; pocket for excess usage.
&gt; 
&gt; BPA is on ETH0
&gt; Netpace on eth1
&gt; lan on eth2
&gt; 
&gt; 10.x.x.x                              /--------&gt; BPA
&gt; [lan ]--------[Linux router natted ?]/
&gt;                                      \
&gt;                                       \--------&gt; netspace
&gt; 
&gt; I read up on route but I admit I didnt understand it too well.
&gt; He asked me I said it was possible but I am not sure how (conceptually I
&gt; understand I think) but practically I dont.

'route' only tells the traffic where to go, it doesn't tell it how to
come back.

You probably need to read up on iptables etc to make sure that a routing
decision is made BEFORE NAT takes place, and there is a seperate NAT
rule for each outbound interface, then you'll probably be ok.

Definately keep a close eye on the data usage once you think you have it
working :)
