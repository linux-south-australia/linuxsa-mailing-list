Daniel,

I have and I am still trying to find out how to fix it.

We keep getting "420 &lt;mailservername&gt; busy" and "551 This is not a relay
host - mail must be to or from host domain" with "550
<A HREF="mailto:username@mailservername...">username@mailservername...</A> User unknown" messages between our Linux/Unix
servers and the Windows 2000 servers.
