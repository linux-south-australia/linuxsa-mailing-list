Indeed, there isn't.

I've developed a Net Café management system in perl/php you throw on top of
apache; theres ipchains, iptables, ipf, and ipfw modules for it.  (In other
words, it should run on most versions of Linux and BSD).

I'm at a café in sydney at the moment actually currently working on it.
There's two modes - per machine ip accounting, which is basically "click"
machine on, routing enabled, and usage is times, "click" machine off, and
amount is calculated.  The other mode links with samba, and cards for logons
can be randomly generated via a separate interface; users then logon to the
NT/2K/XP workstations, and there's a local client which times usage which is
capable of logoff's.  It does plenty more too, but I wont go into details.

Still a lot of bugs; working these out as we speak.

Not sure whether I'm going to sourceforge this or not yet;  the way I'm
considering on going is to have a "Lite" and a "Pro" version, the pro you
pay for, the Lite released under a BSD-type license.

Email me back if you're interested.

&gt; Good day all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am opening an food joint / schnapps bar / internet cafe just of Rundle St
&gt; and am having problems with internet OS software in that I can't afford it.
&gt; I do want to run Linux and not just because it is free, although that is
&gt; obviously part of it. The problem I am having is tracking down some Linux
&gt; internet cafe management software; has there never been a net cafe run on
&gt; Linux, I think there should be.
&gt; 
&gt; Any info on this would be greatly apreciated and there is crepes and
&gt; schnapps in it foe anyone you can.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, hoping to hear from y'all soon, Adam.
