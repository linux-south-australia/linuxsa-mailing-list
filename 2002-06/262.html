Now while I don't like "that sort of thing" (Office Suites) the real
news is probably the  organised approach to a new distribution
specifically for NZ Schools.

&lt;quote NZ Herald&gt;
Society spokesman Peter Harrison said these areas would also be targeted
when the Microsoft deal came up for renegotiation.

He said there was a large range of free alternatives to what Microsoft
had provided and a special distribution of the Linux operating system
would be developed for New Zealand schools with all the software they
needed on a single installation. "There will be plenty of time to move
all New Zealand schools to open source technologies during the current
agreement period.

"This will mean the money that would have been spent on closed source
products will be able to be directed to providing educational resources
specifically customised for New Zealand, and developed by New
Zealanders, thus keeping the money in New Zealand and benefiting the
economy," said Harrison. &lt;/quote&gt;

Perhaps critical mass is approaching. (and IBM amd SUN were right !)
