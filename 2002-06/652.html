&gt; this is pretty good if it is just within australia...

I just put my Proxima projector up for sale on ebay and my first two
enquiries were from overseas.

&gt; quick, easy.. secure.. (but they have to have internet banking to make
&gt; it as easy as CC payments.. )

That's the problem. 

Incidentally, with the boot on the other foot I've had some difficulty
making private purchases in Europe from largely non-technical people who
are advertising their goods online. Most (about 60%) Europeans don't use
credit cards (they will use debit cards) which while it has probably had
all the good social effects claimed it doesn't match the Australian
financial system too well. There's a number of banks that will allow me to
do giro, mandat and virement transactions and I'm trying to choose one
now.
