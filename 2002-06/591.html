&gt; I am getting frustrated....

Computers are like that -- Linux or not... It's why I have a long term
goal of leaving the industry and becoming an asparagus farmer.

&gt; In the past few months I have worked very hard to make Linux on the 
&gt; desktop a reality for my company.

out of interest, how big is your company? How many desktops? One of my
clients use Linux for 15 of their 20-odd desktops, and they are not
highly computer literate -- they are not even in the computer
industry. Works OK mostly, but really does require some setting up to
make it workable for them.

&gt; I will usually think of something really neat that we ought to want to 
&gt; do and work very hard to figure out how the thing works. [God forbid if 

"ought to want to do"... hmm... IMHO, any changes that are made need
to have good business reasons for them. In most cases, this means one
of two things: They will save the business money, or they will make
the business money. If it fits into neither category, then it's
probably not worth doing. Of course, many things are long term, and
the benefits are not immediately obvious, but still, in nearly every
case, it has to be one or the other (or both). Not saying that you're
not doing that -- you may well be -- but even for yourself, the
benefits have to be greater than the cost, or the frustrations really
will get to you...

&gt; I didn't have the wonderful help from helpful people like yourselves. 
&gt; :-) ] In a nutshell, I have found the Linux experience to be a whole lot 
&gt; of work, a whole lot of learning followed by disappointment that what I 
&gt; wanted to do does not work, followed by some type of overall sucess 
&gt; blemished by the struggle to get there.

Yep.

When I work with Windows, which I do when I am doing desktoppy type
things, I know the set of things that I need to do (email, word
processing, web browsing, occasional sshing, and printing), and I know
that I can do all of those things with minimal excess effort. When I'm
doing those things, I don't want to be thinking about the OS, I just
want to do those things.

When I work with Linux (or Solaris, or FreeBSD), which I do when I am
doing almost anything else, particularly server and networking type
things, I know that I can do almost anything, but I will generally
have to think about it. That is OK, because the things that I need to
do (security, file serving, email servers, print servers, web servers,
VPNs, etc etc) all require thought, and so my time is not
unproductive. I know that were I to do it on Windows, I would be
incapable of doing some of these things, and would be restricted from
making the deicisions that I need to make (just point and click, and
away it goes -- don't worry, it's secure by itself), whereas on Linux,
I know that I am the one making the decisions.

Also, I'm a sysadmin -- which means that this kind of thing is my
vocation, and I don't mind doing it. If it doesn't appeal, don't do
it. :) It's really really hard to balance two vocations -- try to be
one thing, and be the best you can at that, rather than trying to do
two things badly... What I'm saying is that it's the struggle that
makes sysadmins valuable -- if it were easy, we'd be well-paid
monkeys, but we're not...

&gt; When I first started I knew nothing of Samba and didn't have an extra 
&gt; server lying around to experiment with... So I felt that it was 
&gt; essential for us to access clinet data stored on our Netware 4.11 
&gt; server.  I already had Red Hat but my knowledge was limited - so I was 
&gt; at first very happy to see that Red Hat 7 claimed to be IPX compatable.

yep... :)

&gt; After I installed the thing I looked for a GUI login for Netware - a 
&gt; netware client. None anywhere - that took a few hours...

I've never used Netware, so I don't know quite what would be needed
here, but I suspect that any network management type thing (user
authentication, etc) is complex no matter what the technology.
Certainly, there's more to it than being able to talk IPX... :)

&gt; I search the Internet for guidance for a few hours....finally something 
&gt; about having to recompile my kernel, a bunch of writing in the how to 
&gt; that made absolutely no sense to me...another 8 hours down the drain. 
&gt; However, I go to bed happy because I found Caldera's web site...which 
&gt; had a Netware Client for Linux how to page.  Surely that feature must be 
&gt; included in Caldera Open Linux I reasoned.  So I bought the thing on 
&gt; line and waited anxiously for a week for it to arrive.

Mmm... I think Netware is not as popular as it used to be, so support
is harder to come by...

&gt; When I got it, big disappointment, it did not have a Netware Client in 
&gt; it.  I called up Caldera and Red Hat for help.  Caldera's line sent me 
&gt; directly to a local computer shop. The person that answered the phone 
&gt; barely spoke English and said "Netwooo? Client...what is that?" I called 
&gt; Red Hat and asked for help and the guy started talking about his client 
&gt; portfolio. I reached another department at Caldera and they said "well, 
&gt; you could pay us $3,000 for a year of support..." At this point I 
&gt; thought, "what a bunch of bozo's!
&gt; ...Microsoft is cheaper!" Obviously we weren't going to pay $3,000 for 
&gt; something we had already.

... but you didn't have it, did you? Nothing's free. Even Linux --
some time and/or expertise is needed, and that's not free.

&gt; 
&gt; Caldera sent me the NKFS package, I had to complain to get it sent to me 
&gt; as I could not find it.  They said just compile this into your kernel. 
&gt; To say the least I hadn't a clue.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't give up and searched the Internet again - I came across some 
&gt; posts from Linuxsa asking about the netware client for Linux but no 
&gt; answers. BTW - that's how I found you all - :-)  .  This time I found a 
&gt; post at the novellfans board from Victor Baldassi giving me an essential 
&gt; piece of the puzzle for getting a Novell 4.11 client for Linux. I found 
&gt; some more posts and put it together and the 
&gt; HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLUUUUUUUAAAAAA! 
&gt;  It worked.....(That's a Back to the Future it Worked)

hmm. well done :) We've all had frustrating situations like that --
sometimes it's things we thought were possible, then find out they
aren't, then invent or discover a workaround, and sometimes it's
things that we aren't even sure are possible, but need to make them
work anyway...

&gt; 
&gt; So at this point I felt morally obligated to post my findings in the 
&gt; clearest most complete way I could.  I posted one message here and one 
&gt; at computing.net to answer the unanswered questions that I had seen.
&gt; 
&gt; Here it is:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/8273.html">http://computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/8273.html</A>

Nice... I assume thats' not your real password :)

&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; But I have now found that if more than say 5 - 10 computers log into the 
&gt; netware server through Linux, everybody gets kicked off.  The netware 
&gt; server monitor has a rip router message. I know nothing of rip routers, 
&gt; and have no way of figuring out how or why this takes place. I can't 
&gt; read a packet sniffer.

RIP is routing information protocol, at least in TCP/IP land... I'm
not sure if it has a different meaning in IPX... &lt;looks it up&gt; ...
yep, RIP is routing information protocol in IPX as well, but it's a
different RIP than the TCP/IP RIP ... you may want to talk to a novell
person about this ...

&gt; 
&gt; I finally got bold enough to compile a kernel and its no biggie. 
&gt; However, when I tried to load the NKFS module I got s message that was 
&gt; somewhat like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Per Linus Torvalds...change your module...So I still haven't got that 
&gt; module compiled into my kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!

yep :) welcome to the world of the sysadmin ...

If you paste the actual message, the kernel version, and what patch or
module you added, and relevant config settings, someone here may be
able to help you.... however, if this is all to do with the RIP
problem above, I'd be inclined to find a Novell CNE to help you with
it first -- you may be barking up the wrong tree.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And such has been my experience with Linux so far.  

All good things come with pain. :)

If you really want to be a sysadmin (and it can be fun, and very
rewarding, both personally and financially), keep at it. Don't be
afraid to really learn -- find out what IPX really means as compared
with TCP/IP, find out how Netware authenticates, how it shares data
etc... It will make solving problems like this so much easier :)
