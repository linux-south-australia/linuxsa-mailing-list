There is no such thing, really, of a "simple" iptables script. I think
the steps you need to take are:

1) Gain general knowledge of security from a wholistic point of view
2) Understand the OSI reference model
3) Understand TCP/IP and the differences between it and the OSI
reference model
4) Understand how various services work (what ports and so forth)
5) Understand iptables itself
 - including chains
 - filters
 - tables
6) Understand packet filtering concepts

That sounds difficult, but if you do the more theoretical learning, i.e.
(1), (2) and (3) then the more practical parts (4), (5) and (6) will
start to make more sense.

Also, what seems to be complex isn't necessarily complex; take the
"complex firewall", determine its top level structures then examine each
structure by itself. Then try to understand the whole. The iptables
tutorial, for example, basically has the following structure (from
memory)

INCOMING

- if it's spoofed dump it
- if it's tcp then send it to tcp_incoming
- if it's udp then send it to udp_incoming
- if it's icmp only allow traceroute and ping


OUTGOING

- allow anything that purports to come from our own servers

There's a LOT more code than just the above, but you don't need to
understand all of it at once. You just need to be able to identify how
the small piece of information you're trying to understand fits into the
bigger picture.
