&gt; hmm... Perl's an interesting one... Is it really innovative (I'm not a
&gt; Perl hacker)? From what I hear, it's pretty different, really...

&gt; I suppose it's like a significantly better awk+sed+shell, really, with a
&gt; few added features that are new... (correct?)

I was guessing that the attitude that Larry developed around bringing 
these together would be a part of the innovation or new insight (well, 
not that new). In comparison, K&R talk about the amount of thought that 
went into command line pipes.
A lot of Larry's speaches, philosophies and ideas are built around this 
thought process. I like his approach from a linguistics background. This 
is partly because this is the same background that I come from, and also 
because it ties in with the 'Communications' part of 'IT'.

Does one's spare time at work count as unfunded? I would say that it is 
still ultimately being payed for.

Dale.
