&gt; Stallman is passionate about his views, highly political and he's not
&gt; frightened to express his views in novel, shocking ways. Such people
&gt; always attract detractors, it's just a way that the cookie crumbles if I
&gt; may use that old cliche. Furthermore, people have a tendency to focus on
&gt; the method of the content delivery rather than the actual content...
&gt;
&gt; Remember, Stallman has a lot of intellectual property out there and a
&gt; lot of ideas. People don't like tall poppies and they do cut them down
&gt; when they can.

oh, tis an australian tradition to gently mock heroes. i think of it as that, 
rather than anything else:)

i think the guy is amazing, with astounding courage of conviction - and for 
that alone, his name should be more widely known.
no matter whether you agree or disagree with him, i dont think anyone could 
debate his passion and commitment to free software for everyone - a noble 
endeavour. his methods can be questionable, and his stances a bit abrasive, 
but oh well, perfection in heroes is a ridiculous concept.

i'd rather a thousand passionate abrasive rms's than one heartless cold 
dispassionate conservative.

and he likes folk dancing, a little known but cute fact:)
