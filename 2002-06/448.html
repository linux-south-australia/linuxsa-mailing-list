Hi list members.
I've got a bit of a problem with using apt-get from behind a 
firewall.
I work for bridgestone in SA, unfortunately it's virtually a pure 
M$ shop, except for a couple of us the the CAD office who need to 
use HP-UX and debian/Alpha.
When we ask for any sort of support for these systems our MIS 
dept just puts their fingers in their ears and make LA-LA-LA-LA 
noises. So it's up to us to fix any problems.
MIS recently (last night) changed our proxy server from WINNT4 to 
WIN2K. Up until this point we've had no problem.
I'd read through the apt docs and found out about nominating a 
proxy server and got it working, I was quite chuffed with this as 
I have no real technical training in administration, thankfully 
I've been running Linux at home for a few years.
Here's a copy of my /etc/apt/apt.conf file, names have been 
changed to protect the guilty


// Pre-configure all packages before they are installed.
// (Automatically added by debconf.)
DPkg::Pre-Install-Pkgs {"/usr/sbin/dpkg-preconfigure --apt";};
Acquire {
   http {
     proxy "<A HREF="http://USERNAME:<A HREF="mailto:PASSWD@corputil02">PASSWD@corputil02</A>/">http://USERNAME:<A HREF="mailto:PASSWD@corputil02">PASSWD@corputil02</A>/</A>";
     };
};

This was working nicely for us up until last night.
When I rang our MS flunkies at MIS I was told that we now had to 
pass username and domain name information to the proxy sever as 
well as password.
The combinations I've tried just don't work.
<A HREF="http://USERNAME.domain:PASSWD">http://USERNAME.domain:PASSWD</A>@corputil02/
<A HREF="http://">http://</A>'USERNAME.domain':<A HREF="mailto:PASSWD@corputil02">PASSWD@corputil02</A>/
<A HREF="http://">http://</A>'<A HREF="mailto:USERNAME@domain">USERNAME@domain</A>':<A HREF="mailto:PASSWD@corputil02">PASSWD@corputil02</A>/
<A HREF="http://">http://</A>'USERNAME/domain':<A HREF="mailto:PASSWD@corputil02">PASSWD@corputil02</A>/

MIS in their wisdom by changing this have also destroyed all my 
hard work in putting Mozilla onto HP-UX as even though I nominate 
the correct proxies in preferences I can't get it to connect or 
even ask me for a password, grrr.

Can someone please give me a few pointers as I can get stuff all 
help from MIS and I wont be able to get them to change anything 
without excellent justification as they both make and work to 
'corporate standards' and we're just a fly in the ointment.
