Although I can't guarantee the same, I have had very good sucess 
recovering lost data with BeOS 5 Professional. BeOS can mount and read 
FAT and EXT2 partitions and has an excellent boot loader.

&gt;Hello all,
&gt;
&gt;I have a problem with a hard drive and would welcome suggestions on
&gt;effective ways of navigating it.
&gt;
&gt;Boot Drive (hosts windows and lilo): WD 800 Meg
&gt;Problem Drive (hosts Mandrake linux): IBM Deskstar 30GB
&gt;
&gt;Some background.  Having found that my system froze (Mandrake 8.2), I
&gt;rebooted only to find that I could no longer access my linux system.  So I
&gt;took out my Mandrake (8.2) disks and commenced a reinstall.  No problem in
&gt;getting to the "Format Partitions" window (designating /, /bu, /home
&gt;partitions) however after hitting "Done" on that window, and then confirming
&gt;my wish to format only the / partition, the drive just began cycling.
&gt;
&gt;The pattern of the cycle, which repeats 10 times, is: "ch", "ch", "ch", "ch"
&gt;then a pause.  
&gt;
&gt;After the 10th cycle series, I get an error message: "An error occurred
&gt;fsck failed with exit code 4 or signal 0".
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone confirm whether the above message and symptoms indicate the drive
&gt;is stuffed  and whether it's likely to be repairable ?
&gt;
&gt;I believe this does not look good for the IBM.  But the drive doesn't seem
&gt;to be completely stuffed because if I boot into windows from LILO on the
&gt;other drive, I can see and access data from the windows partitions on my
&gt;apparantly-stuffed IBM drive.  Of course I can't see or access my linux
&gt;data; linux partitions appear collectively only as "D".
&gt;
&gt;How to get my data off ?  I was thinking that perhaps I could purchase
&gt;another harddrive, make that new drive the master  and the existing
&gt;"stuffed" IBM drive the slave, install linux on the master and then take off
&gt;the data from the IBM.  The hope of this approach would be that the existing
&gt;linux partitions on the IBM drive will become visible from another linux
&gt;system, in the same way as the windows partitions were visible from a
&gt;windows partition. 
&gt;
&gt;So my question is: Can anyone confirm whether this approach will infact make
&gt;my existing linux partitions visible and accessible so I can save the data ?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Andrew Lord
