Hi Darryl,

 &gt; Directory structure is going to look something like this:

 &gt; OrginisationRoot

 &gt;  |-Division1
 &gt;  |  |
 &gt;  |  |-Site1
 &gt;  |  | |-person
 &gt;  |  | |-Person

I know it wasn't what you were asking about, but I'd suggest something
here - organizing your directory by type rather than location. If you
are going to have people moving about between sites and even divisions,
even if it doesn't happen too often, a location-based structure will
cause you pain. The current line of thinking is to do something like:

o=Foo
   |
   |- ou=People
   |   |
   |   |- uid=dross
   |   |- uid=mjg
   |   :
   |
   - ou=Sites
   |   |
   |   |- cn=Site1
   |   |- cn=Site2
   |   :
   |
   - ou=Divisions
   |   |
   |   |- cn=Div1
   |   |- cn=Div2
   :   :
   .

The site and division objects would be containers such as
OrganisationRole or similar. This allows you to move people around with
much more ease, and also allows greater flexability, eg: adding people
to multiple sites or divisions. It is always easier working with LDAP if
you can assume a DN is immutable.

Anyway, to answer your question...

 &gt;
 &gt; I guess the simple question for all the above is, can an LDAP entry
 &gt; inherit the attributes from it's parent???
 &gt;

IIRC the LDAP databases I've worked with (OpenLDAP 1, 2 and the old
Netscape Directory server) don't support attribute inheritance. In any
case, because the inheritance chain would not be related in any way to
the type of the objects involved, such inheritance could make certain
objects appear invalid, eg: an "o" attribute appearing on a
"posixAccount" object, and so on, and so IMHO this would be a bad thing
to implement on the LDAP server itself.

Of course, this means the client would need to implement the inheritance
model, which is a reasonable expectation. Unfortunately it also means
you'll be out of luck with most existing, popular clients (Messenger,
Outlook, etc), and you'll need to duplicate the data on every single
object. With the structure I described above, you'd have to do that
anyway, so I think it's a bit of a moot point.

HTH,
/mike
