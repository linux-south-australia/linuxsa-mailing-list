Hi all,

I've been setting up a wireless network over the last few days, using
pcmcia-&gt;pci bridge cards and orinoco wireless cards.

This is just an email to tell you about a couple of problems I hit, and
solved. I thought I'd pass the info along to save you the hassles I had.

Note that my laptop, which already had everything setup magically by
Mandrake, worked fine -- i plugged in the wireless card and it went BEEP
and started going ok ;)

The stuff below is from my attempts to get everything working with my
custom kernel, bridges, etc....



Firstly, I found a problem where i kept getting errors in my syslog like
"NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth2 timed out... resetting card" whenever I tried to do
anything with the wireless card.

The solution to this was to add a line to my /etc/modules.conf like:

options i82365 irq_mode=0

This tells the module for the pcmcia bridge that it can only have access
to the PCI irqs in my machine, and not the ISA ones. This fixed the
problem.



The other problem I had was that iwconfig, iwspy, and so on, all claimed i
had no wireless extensions available for my wireless device. (eth2).

This was because my kernel did not have "wireless radio network support"
enabled. I went back in and turned it on, rebuilt the kernel, rebooted,
and everything was fine.

I had this disabled in the kernel because I thought it should be -- since
I was using the external pcmcia-cs setup which included the wireless
devices.



This is the long step by step version of what I did:

Get kernel source, set it up so pcmcia is disabled, no pcmcia drivers are
built, etc. However you do need to check the box for wireless radio
networking support -- just don't tick the boxes to build drivers for
individual cards. (THat'll be done by pcmcia-cs)

(At this point you may want to copy the latest version of wireless.h from
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/ into /usr/include/linux.)

After getting that kernel up n running, come back and download build and
extract pcmcia-cs - i used version 3.1.34. (with the orinoco airsnort
patch)
I used the default options, and it all built and installed fine.

Download, build, and install the wireless-tools package.


edit /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts and configure it the way you'd like.. (eg.
default channel, speed, options and so on)


Now, run /etc/init.d/pcmcia start and it hopefully that goes well.
(i had to comment out the pre-install pcmcia_core CARDMGR_OPTS=-f...etc
line in /etc/modules.conf before that worked though, but i think thats
because my machine is a bit wierd)


Now insert the wireless card into the socket. Wait a second, then type
dmesg

This should give you some debugging info about the card and bridge and so
on.. basically it should all look positive. If not, time to start
debugging.


Now try pinging an address on the wireless subnet.. if it comes back fine,
you can stop reading now.

If not, type dmesg, and look for those netdev watchdog timeouts.. If you
are getting them, go back and add the irq_mode=0 to the modules.conf, then
run '/etc/init.d/pcmcia stop' and then run it again with 'start'.


Anyway, hope all this helps,

Toby

PS. And don't forget your firewalls :)
eg:
iptables -N WIRELESS
#insert rules here

iptables -I INPUT 3 -i $WIRELESSIF -j WIRELESS
