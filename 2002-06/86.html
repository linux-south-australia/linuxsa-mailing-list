Hmm.

If I plug a TV in, I get better reception than the TV card. Maybe mine is
marginal in the receiver area. I've heard that Channel 2 is always best,
and it certainly is pretty clear, but the others suffer from varying
degrees of light snow and vertical bars of distortion, (starts up card),
yes, interestingly there are 4 lines in the same spot on Channels 
7,9,10,28 The lines look like stitch lines as if the picture was stitched
together. Not too bad in a small widow, but a bit of a mess full screen.

Care to make a diagnosis? I could send in a screenshot...

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;I thought the snow you get was genuine noise on the same frequencies as
&gt; the
&gt; &gt;tv channels are upon, and thats why i didn't think amplification was a
&gt; &gt;useful tool unless your signal loss/interference occured inbetween the
&gt; &gt;antenna and your receivers.
&gt; 
&gt; In a nutshell it depends on the signal to noise ratio at the receive site
&gt; and the specs of the tv receiver.   If the signal to noise ratio of the
&gt; originating signal is greater than the threshold of the receiver then a
&gt; mast head amp will make a marginal picture better.    Inadequate signal to
&gt; noise means a masthead amplifier will make the noise and signal stronger,
&gt; which just wastes valuable time and money.   Generally all of the tv-tuner
&gt; cards that I have seen/designed (past life) use Philips FM1216 tuners and
&gt; these are *very* good receivers and much better than your average TV/VCR of
&gt; yesteryear.
&gt; 
&gt; Another common problem with a vast majority of mast head amps is there is
&gt; generally not enough isolation between the input and output, hence they
&gt; make great oscillators with little provication.   If your masthead amp
&gt; takes off (starts oscillating) you start transmitting interference to all
&gt; of your neighbours which is NOT great either.   This is often misdiagnosed
&gt; by inexperienced tv antenna "experts" who then flease money for services
&gt; not rendered.  But that was in another life and I am glad I dont work in
&gt; that industry any more.
