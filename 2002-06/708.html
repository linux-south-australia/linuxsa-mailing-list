&gt;&gt;Ours run pretty warm, but I'd be pretty uncomfortable with a drive that
&gt;&gt;was almost too hot to touch. Can you increase the airflow around the
&gt;&gt;drives easily?

&gt;Drives are wide apart (2 to 3 bays) with nice airflow, but the full server
&gt;case only has the power supply fan to push air through.

I have a fair few servers in similar situations, and I have cooked 10krpm
drives due to lack of airflow.  I fully agree that drives can and do operate
fine at high temperatues, but there are limits.  My advice is to look at
putting some fans in front of your drives (JayCar have some really good ones
which are doing the trick for me.  I tried some fancy "scsi drive bays with
fans and digital read outs for temperature etc", but they were totally
non-effective.  The JayCar ones actually offered good airflow.).

As to drive brands, I had two Fujitsu's die in a very well ventilated server
two weeks ago.  I've also had similar failure with Seagates.  So far my best
success rate has been with IBM.  I've heard/read though that IBM has sold
off their HDD business to Quantum.  I've also heard Fujitsu is getting out
of the HDD market.  Who knows :)

Whist on the subject, does anyone have opinions on RAID 5?  I've had three
servers now where RAID 5 hasn't helped because two drives have died at the
same time (or more precisely, a second drive dies before I can get a
replacement for the first).  Could it be that drives in an array tend to
come from the same "batch", and if you're unlucky enough to get a bad batch
there's every likelyhood that more than one will fail?
