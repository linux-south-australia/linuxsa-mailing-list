Subject: Re: Fsck failed with exit code 4 or signal 0

&gt; 
&gt; Although I can't guarantee the same, I have had very good sucess
&gt; recovering lost data with BeOS 5 Professional. BeOS can mount and read
&gt; FAT and EXT2 partitions and has an excellent boot loader.
&gt; 

Hello James,

Thanks for the suggestion.  Given the behaviour of the drive though, I do
have doubts as to whether it'll load.  But given the success you have had
using it for data recovery, sounds to be worthwhile giving it a try, even if
it does mean getting another drive to load it onto.

Cheers, 

Andrew

&gt;&gt; Hello all,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have a problem with a hard drive and would welcome suggestions on
&gt;&gt; effective ways of navigating it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Boot Drive (hosts windows and lilo): WD 800 Meg
&gt;&gt; Problem Drive (hosts Mandrake linux): IBM Deskstar 30GB
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Some background.  Having found that my system froze (Mandrake 8.2), I
&gt;&gt; rebooted only to find that I could no longer access my linux system.  So I
&gt;&gt; took out my Mandrake (8.2) disks and commenced a reinstall.  No problem in
&gt;&gt; getting to the "Format Partitions" window (designating /, /bu, /home
&gt;&gt; partitions) however after hitting "Done" on that window, and then confirming
&gt;&gt; my wish to format only the / partition, the drive just began cycling.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The pattern of the cycle, which repeats 10 times, is: "ch", "ch", "ch", "ch"
&gt;&gt; then a pause.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; After the 10th cycle series, I get an error message: "An error occurred
&gt;&gt; fsck failed with exit code 4 or signal 0".
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Can anyone confirm whether the above message and symptoms indicate the drive
&gt;&gt; is stuffed  and whether it's likely to be repairable ?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I believe this does not look good for the IBM.  But the drive doesn't seem
&gt;&gt; to be completely stuffed because if I boot into windows from LILO on the
&gt;&gt; other drive, I can see and access data from the windows partitions on my
&gt;&gt; apparantly-stuffed IBM drive.  Of course I can't see or access my linux
&gt;&gt; data; linux partitions appear collectively only as "D".
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; How to get my data off ?  I was thinking that perhaps I could purchase
&gt;&gt; another harddrive, make that new drive the master  and the existing
&gt;&gt; "stuffed" IBM drive the slave, install linux on the master and then take off
&gt;&gt; the data from the IBM.  The hope of this approach would be that the existing
&gt;&gt; linux partitions on the IBM drive will become visible from another linux
&gt;&gt; system, in the same way as the windows partitions were visible from a
&gt;&gt; windows partition.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; So my question is: Can anyone confirm whether this approach will infact make
&gt;&gt; my existing linux partitions visible and accessible so I can save the data ?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cheers,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Andrew Lord
