&gt; Compaq is good?

Sometimes. It really depends.

&gt; I am writing this on my Dell laptop while waiting for the bus - Linux
&gt; runs like a dream.  Please do not mention Compaq again - I have heard
&gt; horrible stories about Linux and Compaq - and IBM seems to have lost the
&gt; plot in the consumer laptop market (they just put out hyped up cut down
&gt; laptops for a hyped up price)

It doesn't sound like you're really qualified to ask that I "...not
mention Compaq again..." -- you're basing your opinion on heresay.

I've worked with *lots* of laptops including Compaq, and I'd grant you
that:

* They're expensive to repair.

* Compaq's turn-around times for parts are shocking.

However,

* They're built like brick shithouses (less so when compared to IBM,
  but still good).

* They generally use good quality components.

* Geeze, they just work

They're not quite perfect (by a long way), but they're certainly
better than you give them credit for.

&gt; I believe the laptop is a good idea - solar panels or 12V Gel packs
&gt; would do the trick - at least this laptop can be rigged up to external
&gt; power easily while others can't.

It seems to defeat the purpose of having a laptop to me. 

&gt; But if you do want a decent laptop - go Dell - it worked for me!

I'd never really recommend one, but there you go :-)
