Hi all,

I have been under the impression that it is impossible to do IPSec or
PPTP through a NAT gateway... However
<A HREF="http://www.impsec.org/linux/masquerade/ip_masq_vpn.html">http://www.impsec.org/linux/masquerade/ip_masq_vpn.html</A> seems to
indicate that one can masquerade both of them, with a few caveats.

However, this document only applies to the 2.0 and 2.2 series kernels.
Also, it appears to require patching the firewall itself (though I
haven't read it thoroughly)...

Does anyone know how I can do what I want... That is:

  My LAN 
192.168.1.0/24
    |
    |
192.168.1.1 (internal interface)
My Linux 2.4
 Gateway (does SNAT)
 a.b.c.d (external real interface)
    |
    |
 Internet-------\
                |
             e.f.g.h (external real interface)
        Some Clients' unknown
        Gateway (does SNAT)
           192.168.2.1 (internal interface)
                |
                |
         192.168.2.0/24
          Clients' LAN
         with my laptop

What I want to be able to do is communicate from within the client LAN
to my gateway as if I were on my LAN. It needs to be encrypted all the
way, and I can't really do much to the Clients' gateway (which could
be Linux, Cisco or Windows or anything). I wouldn't really need to be
on my own 192.168.1.0 range -- it would be ok to be on some other
range, so there were no conflicts with the client LAN. All I want to
do is ensure that I can do things like interact with my IMAP and SMTP
mail servers without opening up an external port.

Any ideas? Could I perhaps set up an unencrypted IP over IP tunnel
through, and then run IPSec over that? That way, the IPSec packets
would appear to be unnaffected by the SNATting.
