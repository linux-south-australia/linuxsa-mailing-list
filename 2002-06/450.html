Thanks very much for that John, I just rang up our MIS dept and 
using the excellent bits of info you gave me I was able to reach 
a compromise solution where the guys in the CAD office are in a 
separate authentication group and use 'basic' authentication and 
not NTLM.
Without that inside info I'd never have know enough to be able to 
'persuade' them into changing their setup.
Thanks John and LinuxSA.


Cheers,
David Creed

&gt;&gt;Can someone please give me a few pointers as I can get stuff all
&gt;&gt;help from MIS and I wont be able to get them to change anything
&gt;&gt;without excellent justification as they both make and work to
&gt;&gt;'corporate standards' and we're just a fly in the ointment.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It sounds like they may have opted for NTLM authentication on the MS
&gt; proxy.
&gt; 
&gt; If so, you'll need to find something to create this information (I've
&gt; seen some interesting hacks for cache systems that involve running a
&gt; daemon on a windows box just to generate the auth credentials for a unix
&gt; system) or get the MIS guys to turn on 'basic' authentication.
&gt; 
&gt; If you're really lucky, the samba guys may have worked out a way around
&gt; this.
