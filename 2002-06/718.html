&gt;Whist on the subject, does anyone have opinions on RAID 5?  I've had three
&gt;servers now where RAID 5 hasn't helped because two drives have died at the
&gt;same time (or more precisely, a second drive dies before I can get a
&gt;replacement for the first).  Could it be that drives in an array tend to
&gt;come from the same "batch", and if you're unlucky enough to get a bad
batch
&gt;there's every likelyhood that more than one will fail?

Grab yourself a controller which supports "spare" or redundant disks.  I
have a Accusys SCSI RAID controller which uses 5 drives for RAID5, 3 main +
2 spare.  As soon as one disk fails a spare is used to rebuild the array
immediately, independant of OS operation.  Have had significant problems in
the past with faulty 10k SCSI drives, mainly with poor airflow in the case,
sound familiar ?

Interestingly enough Accusys have released a IDE RAID controller, supports
16 IDE drives and uses U160 (twin) SCSI interface to the PC.  Has an Intel
i960 PowerPC in controller with 512Mb of RAM onboard, fits into 5 1/4" bay
only requires a power connector (floppy size). Very schmick unit, easy to
set up and absolutely OS independant (the OS cannot see the disks only the
array presented as a single HDD on the SCSI).   They are not cheap though.
Have rolled out one unit with 16x120Gb WD1200-JB drives, utilised as 4x4
Raid5 (3 main + 1 spare time 4) so it has just a tad under 1Tb of storage
(960Gb).   Was a challange to build.   Was very cost effective when
compared to SCSI solutions.  Only time will tell the reliability.   Had to
buy a very big LTO drive for this baby, full backups are a nightmare !

My 2c worth on RAID5.
