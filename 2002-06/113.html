&gt;By this, I specifically don't mean feats of software engineering -- gcc,
&gt;Linux, etc, are not really "innovations" per se, but merely
&gt;implementations of fairly well-understood concepts, algorithms and
&gt;functionality. Good implementations, perhaps better than others, and
&gt;perhaps more complete and standards-compliant, but still just
&gt;implementations.

Name some innovations by commercial sources that aren't based on
well-understood concepts, algorithms and functionality. One could say that
the GUI was a logical progression of Graphical displays, and that the mouse
(arguably what makes a GUI useful) was developed more than 10 years
previous.

btw, your filters didn't give a time limit, nor did they actually specify
feats of software engineering. One could claim just about anything built
before 1790 when the USPTO opened. :)

For innovative open-source-style projects, how about;

fidonet
tux/khttpd kernel module web server
reiserfs
qmail - innovative when you look at what else was available at the time
round-robin patch for bind

It's out there, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find more like the above ..
but it's the type of innovation we take for granted because no-one funded a
marketing campaign to tell us it was innovative :)
