have a look at www.tradesecure.com.au. not sure if it suits your needs but 
worth a look.

&gt; Using Linux of course, so as not to be off-topic :-) In fact I think this

&gt;
&gt; I'm selling some (Linux-related, &lt;whew&gt;) gear online, and though I've
&gt; always resisted it in the past some people really want to pay me
&gt; personally by credit card. I've never used Paypal, but I notice that
&gt; besides a substantial delay in retrieving funds there seem to be a lot of
&gt; people on the net claiming that Paypal have ripped them off to the tune of
&gt; many thousands or that their funds were held for many months.
&gt;
&gt; So I went looking for alternatives. The most relevant Australian one I
&gt; found has a very humourous front page
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.standardtransactions.com.au">http://www.standardtransactions.com.au</A> ) so I quickly skipped that one,
&gt; and I arrived at Billpoint (ebay's own, but capped at AUD1000 maximum
&gt; transaction for ordinary accounts, which is too low) and Yahoo Paydirect
&gt; (<A HREF="http://paydirect.yahoo.com">http://paydirect.yahoo.com</A>) which seems a bit light on details about
&gt; fees. There's a promising-sounding one run by a real bank (Citibank in the
&gt; US) instead of these dotcom pretend-to-be-banks, but unfortunately its
&gt; site <A HREF="http://www.c2it.com">http://www.c2it.com</A> is down. So far the best I can come up with is to
&gt; take the credit card details to someone who already has a merchant
&gt; agreement with a bank (eg a shopkeeper) and ask them to put it through for
&gt; a small fee (if that's not proscribed by their contract with the bank.)
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone point me to a better service than those listed above?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
