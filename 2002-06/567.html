This is true, although talking with lecturers this year indicates they 
are thinking about making students use cvs for practial work, so if 
there is any hint of cheating, they can check your cvs for how your 
assignment progressed.

Ok, so you can still a) Pay someone else to do it all for you, over 
time, or b) Get an assigment and copy it over time.

If you manage a) you're either going to get caught out in the end, or be 
able to buy your way though life anyway, so what does it matter? :-)

If you cheat with b) you still might be learning something anyway, 
because you have to code it by hand, so it's not so bad. :-)

But yeah, there is that problem.



&gt; I've been to coding exams before, and they're not pretty.

Uuugh. I shudder with fear over a coding exam. It's like thinking about 
hardware failures. :-)

&gt; So given that most subjects have a practical and theory aspect
&gt; it seems best to do the practical by assignments and the theory
&gt; by some other means.

*nod* Yeah, I agree, exams have their place - I just wish they weren't 
worth 70-85%. I have spent a lot more time this semester writing some 
good programs based on the theory than I have memorising the theory.

Maybe that just says I don't know how to work the Uni system? :-)



&gt; And I've sat tripos exams too (you, a chair, a panel of professors
&gt; all aiming to make you look a fool).  You don't want to demonstrate
&gt; your theory knowledge that way.

*nod* Yes, it's like sitting for a job interview. Uuugh. :-)



&gt; Capping the possible grade based on both the exam and assignment
&gt; results seems fair.

*nod* I think it's a good idea!



&gt; My perfect subject would fail people that failed the exam.  With
&gt; a friendly tripos allowed for poeple that failed the exam due to
&gt; nerves to give them a chance (you can usualy pick these people
&gt; when marking the exam paper).

*nod* I agree. Interestingly, CS at Adelaide has gone the other way this 
year - you can now only get an "academic" supplementary if you *need* 
the subject to pass your degree. Thus, no academic supps. for first 
sememster subjects - you can always pick up another one next 
sememster... :-(




&gt; I'd also have coding assignments, say 5, all due last day of term.

5 seems like a good number. Compiler Construction had 5 - Scanner, 
Parser, Semantic Analysis, Code Generation and Final Product. It seemed 
like a good amount of work. Most other subjects had only 2.

Don't know about due last day of term - I think due dates spread out 
help, as it encourages you to work as you go. Knowledge Representation 
had 11 or 12 assignments - one due every week. They were mostly small, 
so all you had to do was keep up and you were fine. I like that approach.



&gt; I'd allow people to chose not to submit one of the five.
&gt; Thus people can have one assignment where they "just don't get it"
&gt; and stuff it up completely

A great idea, although I'd still make them hand all assignments in - 
just allow for an assignment that's not a "pass." I'd still want to see 
students *try*.



&gt; (like me, who wrote managed to write
&gt; a perfectly good compiler that output very nice code, but in doing
&gt; so turned the compiler into a table-driven three-code compiler rather
&gt; than the requested recursive descent compiler and blew 50% of the
&gt; marks on offer).

Yeah, that's wrong. I know my compiler doesn't work entirely the way we 
did it in lectures - it tends to use the ID Table for more stuff rather 
than messing about with the AST - but the lecturers have been cool about 
it - as far as I know! I guess I'll find out when the marks come out. 
:-) They have certainly seemed to be happy to allow variations when 
questioned about it...


&gt; And a reading list, material in the list covered in the exam.

Normally this can come from reading past exams though. :-)


Cheers,
