&gt; &gt; I think it is positive news, what are your thoughts?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; It is a good thing if you like paying per-seat licensing for Linux. It 
&gt; is a bad thing if you don't like someone else charging and keeping 
&gt; licensing fees for something that you wrote and released for free.

AFAIK, it's only Caldera who plans on per-seat licensing -- each
member decides on their own sales and licensing model... And I have
been lead to believe that they (or at least, SuSE) plan on releasing a
developers' version for free, which may not have the UnitedLinux
branding, but will be otherwise identical.

Of course, the source will always be available free from each vendor
-- it's only the binaries with branding that they will charge for...

&gt; I doubt it will amount to much, if only because of the licensing model 
&gt; and because of which most others in the Linux community (commercial or 
&gt; not) will ignore it. It's not like they are doing anything new, needed, 
&gt; or good.

Not technically, no... but it could be an astute marketing move, and
who said standardisation and compatibility weren't needed or good
anyway? :)

&gt; Would you want to pay $xx per copy of Linux you installed?

No. I would like to get paid $xxx per copy of Linux I install. ;)

If I were in the target market for UL, I may well want to pay $xx per
copy, depending on what I got for that. Things I might want may
include compatibility, stability (in the business sense, rather than
the OS sense), and a brand name...

Of course, if I were me, which I am, I would rather have Debian.
