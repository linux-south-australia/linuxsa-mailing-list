Hi everyone, 

I'm trying to do a redelogation for an sa.edu.au domain. No one I know knows anything about how to do an sa.edu.au properly. Every lead I have looked at the person either has left the job or has retired. 

I have looked on the site 
www.tafe.sa.edu.au/webinfo/soe_web/dns-request.html
and was told that you could redelogate sa.edu.au domains from here but I submitted a request a week ago and have had no response of any kind. It also looks like the page is more used for registering currently vacent domain names. I rang the phone numbers on the web site but the person listed no longer works there and no one knows anything about it.

I know that this does not have much (if anything) to do with Linux except for the fact that I am doing the work for it on a Linux box, but I am getting fairly desperate for leads as to where to go with it. So if it is not too big an ask could someone please point me to some answers?

If anyone replies to this I would be extremely appreciative of their help.

Thankyou,
Nathan Millhouse.
