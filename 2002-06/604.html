Ahh, I see Caldera want to hurry their demise.. ;) It will be 
interesting to see what the other UL members do.

&gt; Not technically, no... but it could be an astute marketing move, and
&gt; who said standardisation and compatibility weren't needed or good
&gt; anyway? :)

I guess I can't see what else they are going to add, standardisation- 
and compatibility-wise, that hasn't been done before. It's "initatives" 
like that that brings truth to the truism: "the good thing about 
standards is that there's so many of them."

&gt; 
&gt; No. I would like to get paid $xxx per copy of Linux I install. ;)
&gt; 

Ditto. ^_^

&gt; If I were in the target market for UL, I may well want to pay $xx per
&gt; copy, depending on what I got for that. Things I might want may
&gt; include compatibility, stability (in the business sense, rather than
&gt; the OS sense), and a brand name...

To be honest, the only thing I can see UL adding is the brand name and 
(in the case of Caldera anyway) assurance for PHB's that they have 
someone to sue if something goes wrong. I assume you'll still have to 
pay extra for any useful support, and the GPL ensures that any 
compatibility and stability improvements that go into existing software 
will be released upstream anyway. Perhaps they'll add some proprietry 
stuff, but that will be avoided by free software advocates - who happen 
to be the majority of the Linux "market" - and which will doubtfully be 
important and/or different enough to capture anyone else's attention.

&gt; Of course, if I were me, which I am, I would rather have Debian.
&gt; 

Ditto again, but the real question is, why the hell are you up at this 
time of the night doing documentation? 8)
