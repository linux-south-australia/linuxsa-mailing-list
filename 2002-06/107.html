Hi all,

I've asked this previously, but while we're on the topic, I thought I'd
ask it again...

What are some examples of true innovation that have occurred in a
copyright-free and patent-free non-public environment, and how were they
funded?

By this, I specifically don't mean feats of software engineering -- gcc,
Linux, etc, are not really "innovations" per se, but merely
implementations of fairly well-understood concepts, algorithms and
functionality. Good implementations, perhaps better than others, and
perhaps more complete and standards-compliant, but still just
implementations.

Also, this doesn't include publicly funded projects, like the
development of TCP/IP -- this was artificially made viable by the US
Government of the day, and certainly does not provide a viable business
model if you're not a government.

What I am specifically looking for is *new* things that came about
within the Open Source world. Ideally, a whole new product class, never
seen before (eg, the GUI, developed at Xerox PARC). Ideally, this
product would have been the direct cause of a net (financial) benefit to
its creator(s) (eg not the GUI, profitably marketed by Apple and MS) --
something that represents good return on the investment.

Unfortunately, I can't really think of anything that remains after
applying all my filters. I would like to have a few things left here --
it would be great to have an eg that allows one to say "Free Software
can produce innovation as much as closed software can, just look at
&lt;blah&gt;". Alternatively, perhaps it is the case that no innovation
actually does occur apart from within Government and legal monopoly
organisations ... but that's harder to demonstrate.
