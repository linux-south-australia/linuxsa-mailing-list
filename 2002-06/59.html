There is no meaningful difference.  It is called competition.

&gt; While inventors or producers of copyrightable material should have some
&gt; rights with respect to the products of their intellect, it should be
&gt; remembered that we as consumers have rights as well.

Ethically I am not so sure about this.  In our commercial money-oriented 
society, it seems necessary.  However, the open source and free software 
movements show that the necessary "rights" even in the current climate can be 
minimal.

&gt; Furthermore, patents, copyright, trademark, etc, were all created to allow
&gt; progress. If they no longer serve their purpose, and there is very clear
&gt; evidence that large established companies use their patent portfolios to
&gt; stiffle competition, which prevents innovation, then perhaps it is time to
&gt; rethink the whole area.

That is the "cruncher".  Copyright was there to encourage inventors.  It 
meant that a predatory entrepreneur could not steal an idea from beneath the 
nose of the inventor and make money at the inventor's expence (cf DOS 1.0).

Copyright is now being used to crush competition and blackmail citizens and 
small companies (eg the copyright on text messages).  Obviously, the original 
purpose has been subverted and must be reinstated.
