We've had good success with running chkrootkit on machines that our IDS
has identified as compromised but we need some demo to convince the
machine's owner.

If you are going to verify the RPMs you'll need to boot from CD first (as 
often the bootloader or kernel isn't quite what you'd expect).  The CD 
will also have the complete RPM database for the distribution -- that's 
the database you want to verify against, not the one on disk.

Tripwire or Veracity are a good idea, but can't catch rootkits that are
not files.  Because of this you might want to "dd" your disk's boot block
into a file before running the programs (you can usually set them to look
at the contents rather than the last modified date of this file).  Some
root kits change the boot block and run from the free space in your
filesystem to avoid Tripwire.

Snort is the current favoured IDS.  The practicality of this depends on
the size of your site and the style of your connection to the Internet.
You may need to reorganise your Internet link so that Snort can see the
data flow past.
