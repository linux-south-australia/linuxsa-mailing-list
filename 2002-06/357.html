&gt; Sounds too complex (or were you being synical?) 

glen has assumed you want to multihome. he has described a setup which you
would use if you were planning on having redundancy for the internet links
to servers utilising a single subnet.


&gt; Was I asking the wrong question?

your question was a little confusing to start with, but i think what you
meant was this...

use BPA only for access to "free" Telstra servers (ie. wireplay)
use Netspace ADSL for anything else

the first, and simplest suggestion was the best. find out the IPs of the
servers he will be accessing that should go out the BPA connection and route
them out that interface (remembering to NAT them with that interfaces IP)
and then default route out the netspace interface (again remembering to NAT
with that interfaces IP).

you won't find any HOW-TO on this setup, as it isn't very common...
