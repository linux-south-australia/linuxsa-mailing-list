Microsoft Corporation in any way.

IMPORTANT:

THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN LINDOWS.COM, INC. ("LINDOWS") AND 
EITHER (1) A FAMILY END-USER ("FAMILY") -- AN INDIVIDUAL END-USER 
AGREEING TO A FAMILY EDITION LICENSE FOR PERSONAL USE AND USE BY MEMBERS 
OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL'S HOUSEHOLD OR (2) A BUSINESS END-USER ("BUSINESS") 
AGREEING TO A BUSINESS EDITION LICENSE FOR AN AGREED UPON NUMBER OF 
SEATS OR NUMBER OF SIMULTANEOUS USERS, BUT NOT BOTH. THE FAMILY OR THE 
BUSINESS ("YOU" OR "YOUR"), AS APPROPRIATE, AGREES TO CAREFULLY READ 
THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT (THIS "AGREEMENT") BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING THE 
LindowsOS SOFTWARE PRODUCT (INCLUDING ALL ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTATION, 
ENHANCEMENTS, UPGRADES AND EXTENSIONS THERETO "LindowsOS"). INSTALLING 
OR OTHERWISE USING THIS PRODUCT INDICATES YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT YOU 
HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY AND COMPLY WITH ITS 
TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PROMPTLY RETURN LindowsOS 
(WITHOUT INSTALLING IT) TO PLACE OF PURCHASE AND ANY MONEY YOU HAVE PAID 
FOR LindowsOS WILL BE RETURNED.

SELECTING THE "I ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT" OPTION FURTHER CONFIRMS YOUR 
ACCEPTANCE OF ALL TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

1. LICENSE.

1.1 License.

a. Family License: If You are a Family or Individual, You agree to the 
following terms of this Section 1.1.a: LindowsOS is a modular operating 
system made up of individual software components (each individual 
software component and all accompanying documentation, enhancements, 
upgrades and extensions thereto are referred to herein as "Software 
Program(s)") that were created either by Lindows or various individuals 
and entities ("Third Parties"). Subject to the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement, Lindows grants You a non-exclusive license to use the 
object code form of LindowsOS for Your personal use in accordance with 
the accompanying documentation. You may download and use LindowsOS on 
multiple computers owned, leased or rented by You; provided, however, 
You and members of Your Household (a "Household" consists of those 
individuals that currently reside with You) are the only individuals 
with the right to use Your licensed copy(ies) of LindowsOS. For example, 
if You have a desktop computer at home and a laptop computer which You 
travel with, You may download a copy of LindowsOS on both machines for 
the personal use of members of Your Household and You. You agree that 
You are responsible for the members of Your Household's compliance with 
the terms of this Agreement as though they were You and had agreed to 
all terms and conditions herein. Except as otherwise expressly set forth 
herein, You may not (and shall not allow any member of Your Household or 
any other Third Party to) (i) decompile, disassemble or otherwise 
reverse engineer LindowsOS; (ii) remove any product identification or 
other notices; (iii) copy LindowsOS (other than for back-up purposes, 
for Your personal use on Your multiple machines as set forth in this 
Section 1.1.a, or for archival purposes); (iv) provide, lease, lend, use 
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use or allow 
others to use LindowsOS to or for the benefit of Third Parties, or (v) 
modify LindowsOS or incorporate LindowsOS into or with other software.

b. Business License: If You are a Business, You agree to the following 
terms of this Section 1.1.b: LindowsOS is a modular operating system 
made up of individual software components (each individual software 
component and all accompanying documentation, enhancements, upgrades and 
extensions thereto are referred to herein as "Software Program(s)") that 
were created either by Lindows or various individuals and entities 
("Third Parties"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, Lindows grants You a non-exclusive license for Your 
authorized users to use the object code form of LindowsOS for Your 
internal business purposes on Business owned, rented or leased computers 
in accordance with the accompanying documentation for: (1) solely up to 
the number of Simultaneous Users purchased by You as set forth at 
www.lindows.com/businesslicense &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lindows.com/businesslicense&gt">http://www.lindows.com/businesslicense&gt</A>; 
, regardless of the number of Business owned, rented or leased computers 
that You download LindowsOS on or (2) solely up to the number of Seats 
purchased by You as set forth at www.lindows.com/businesslicense 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.lindows.com/businesslicense&gt">http://www.lindows.com/businesslicense&gt</A>; . "Simultaneous Users" refers 
to authorized users that may use LindowsOS at the same time. A "Seat" is 
a single computer processing unit or "CPU" (including computers with 
redundant processing systems), whether LindowsOS is installed directly 
on that CPU or is served from a centralized server. Except as otherwise 
expressly set forth herein, You and Your authorized users may not (and 
shall not allow any Third Party or any of Your authorized users to) (i) 
decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer LindowsOS; (ii) 
remove any product identification or other notices; (iii) copy LindowsOS 
(other than for back-up purposes, for use on multiple Seats as set forth 
in this Section 1.1.b, or for archival purposes); (iv) provide, lease, 
lend, use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use or 
allow others to use LindowsOS to or for the benefit of Third Parties, or 
(v) modify LindowsOS or incorporate LindowsOS into or with other 
software. You shall keep a current record of the location of each copy 
of LindowsOS You make.

1.2 Third Party Agreements. Many of the Software Programs included in 
LindowsOS are distributed under the terms of agreements with Third 
Parties ("Third Party Agreements") which may expand or limit Your rights 
to use certain Software Programs as set forth in Section 1.1. Certain 
Software Programs may be licensed (or sublicensed) to You under the GNU 
General Public License and other similar open source license agreements 
("OSLAs") which, among other rights, permit You to copy, modify and 
redistribute certain Software Programs, or portions thereof, and have 
access to the source code of certain Software Programs, or portions 
thereof. In addition, certain Software Programs, or portions thereof, 
may be licensed (or sublicensed) to You under terms stricter than those 
set forth in Section 1.1. Please review visit www.lindows.com/licensing 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.lindows.com/licensing&gt">http://www.lindows.com/licensing&gt</A>; for the on-line documentation that 
accompanies certain Software Programs, or portions thereof, for the 
applicable Third Party Agreements. To the extent any Third Party 
Agreements require that Lindows provide rights to use, copy or modify a 
Software Program that are broader than the rights granted in Section 
1.1, then such rights shall take precedence over the rights and 
restrictions granted in this Agreement solely for such Software Programs.

1.3 Violation of Licensing Terms. Any violation by You of the applicable 
license terms set forth in Section 1.1 or Section 1.2, as appropriate, 
shall immediately terminate Your license to use LindowsOS. If You do not 
agree to comply with and be bound by the terms of the applicable license 
agreement(s), do not install, distribute or otherwise use LindowsOS.

2. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

All right, title and interest in LindowsOS, including source code, 
documentation, appearance, structure and organization, are held by 
Lindows and/or its licensors and are protected by copyright and other 
laws. You may not copy or otherwise use LindowsOS, in whole or in part, 
except as expressly permitted in this Agreement. Title to LindowsOS, or 
to any copy, modification or merged portion of any of the Software 
Programs, shall at all times remain with Lindows and/or its licensors, 
subject to the terms of the applicable Third Party Agreement(s) to the 
Software Programs under consideration.

3. TRADEMARKS

"Lindows.com" and "LindowsOS" are registered trademarks of Lindows.com, 
Inc., All Rights Reserved. "Linux" is a registered trademark of Linus 
Torvalds. All other trademarks are the property of their respective 
owners. While certain Third Party Agreements described in Section 1.2 
may allow You to copy, modify and distribute certain Software Programs, 
they do not permit You to distribute the Software Programs utilizing 
Lindows.com's trademarks.

4. LIMITED WARRANTY.

IF LindowsOS WAS DISTRIBUTED TO YOU BY LINDOWS OR A LINDOWS AUTHORIZED 
DISTRIBUTOR ON CD-ROM OR OTHER TANGIBLE STORAGE MEDIA, LINDOWS WARRANTS 
THAT THE STORAGE MEDIA IN THIS PRODUCT WILL BE FREE FROM DEFECT IN 
MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP UNDER NORMAL USE FOR A PERIOD OF THIRTY (30) 
DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU ACQUIRE IT. IF SUCH A DEFECT OCCURS, RETURN 
THE MEDIA TO LINDOWS AT, LINDOWS.COM, INC., 9333 GENESEE AVE., SAN 
DIEGO, CA 92121, AND LINDOWS WILL REPLACE IT FREE OF CHARGE. THIS REMEDY 
IS YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR BREACH OF THIS WARRANTY.

EXCEPT WHERE SPECIFICALLY STATED OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT, LindowsOS, 
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION EACH SOFTWARE PROGRAM, IS PROVIDED TO YOU 
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS AND 
LINDOWS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THOSE ARISING BY 
LAW, STATUTE, USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING OR OTHERWISE. ANY 
WARRANTY OR REMEDY PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXTENDS ONLY TO THE 
PARTY WHO PURCHASES A LICENSE TO LindowsOS FROM LINDOWS OR A LINDOWS 
AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so 
the above exclusion may not apply to You. You may have other rights 
which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF LindowsOS IS 
ASSUMED BY YOU. NEITHER LINDOWS NOR ITS APPOINTED DEALERS, SUPPLIERS OR 
LICENSEES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY 
FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF REVENUE OR PROFIT, 
LOST OR DAMAGED DATA OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS, EVEN IF 
LINDOWS OR SUCH DEALER, SUPPLIER OR LICENSEE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR THEY ARE FORESEEABLE. OUR MAXIMUM 
AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU AND THAT OF OUR DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS FOR 
DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR LindowsOS. 
THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT THE ALLEGED 
BREACH OR DEFAULT IS A BREACH OF A FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION OR TERM OR A 
FUNDAMENTAL BREACH.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability 
for incidental or consequential damage, so the above limitation may not 
apply to You.

6. DISTRIBUTION.

If You are permitted to redistribute any Software Programs under an 
appropriate OSLA, it is Your responsibility to comply with all export 
laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions where the Software 
Programs are exported from, exported to, or re-exported from time to time.

7. TERM.

This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate this 
license at any time by destroying all copies of LindowsOS. The Agreement 
will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any term or 
condition of the Agreement. The provisions of Sections 1.2 (regarding 
OSLAs that remain in force) and 2 - 8, shall survive termination.

8. GENERAL.

This Agreement, together with the Third Party Agreements, is the entire 
agreement regarding Your use of LindowsOS, superseding any other 
agreement or discussions, oral or written, and may not be changed except 
by a signed agreement. Except as set forth in the appropriate OSLA, You 
may not assign Your rights or obligations under this Agreement without 
the prior consent of Lindows. This Agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, 
excluding that body of law applicable to choice of law and excluding the 
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods and any legislation implementing such Convention, if otherwise 
applicable. The sole jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the 
subject matter hereof shall be the state and federal courts located in 
San Diego County. In any action to enforce this Agreement, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees. If any 
provision of this Agreement is declared by a Court of competent 
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such a provision 
shall be severed from the Agreement and the other provisions shall 
remain in full force and effect. At no time shall a failure or delay in 
enforcing any provisions, exercising any option or requiring 
performance, be construed to be a waiver.
