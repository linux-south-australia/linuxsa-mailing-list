&gt; Have a look at 2.2.4 or the soon to be released 2.2.5. I have not yet
&gt; looked at XP and the issues around XP, but they are probably surmountable
&gt; with a little bit of coding. It might also be possible to set a registry
&gt; entry in XP to stop it doing what it is doing.

2.2.4 wouldn¹t run as a PDC with XP machines.  I grabbed a 2.2.5 prerelease
from CVS, and it didn't help.

The registry key(s) made -tng work, but not normal samba.
 
&gt; Send mail on <A HREF="mailto:samba-technical@samba.org.">samba-technical@samba.org.</A> You are more likely to get answers
&gt; there.

I believe I did - I sent multiple mails to the samba mailing list, but
weirdly enough nobody seemed to have any experience on why it wasn't working
on my setup.  Some said it worked, some said it didn't.

TNG would be fine if I knew why it was dying :(

&gt;&gt; Normal Samba would not work with XP.  I tried it from ports, I tried it from
&gt;&gt; a source tar.gz on the samba site, and the 2_2 from CVS (3_0 would core dump
&gt;&gt; on me when I tried to use it, and I've heard Very Bad Things about its
&gt;&gt; stability, so I'd prefer to stick with 2.X).  I also tried downgrading to
&gt;&gt; 2.0.X, but XP still wouldn't authenticate properly.  (2K/NT/98 boxes would
&gt;&gt; run fine).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Samba-tng actually worked... Until now, anyway. :(
