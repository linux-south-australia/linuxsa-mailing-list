&gt; Hi Rhett,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I've managed to get my Telstra NT1 Plus II talking to Linux over USB, by
&gt; compiling USB Modem (CDC ACM) Support.  Manages to talk to the NT1 with
&gt; /dev/usb/acm/0
&gt; 
&gt; Did the NT1+ II still have a serial port on it? If so, have you tried it?

No.  Because it seems to be working fine over USB.

&gt; Also, the NT1+ may be negotiating multilink by default which could make
&gt; performance different to an ordinary connection. There might be an option to
&gt; turn that off.

In the chatscript, I've got:

#tell NT1 to only use 64kbps for now
""	AT!T0=65

This should limit the NT1 to 64kbps, according to the manual available on www.open.co.nz.



&gt; &gt;Everything appears to be fine...  I've managed to get it dialing up by
&gt; using pppd and chat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;However, everything seems to be quite slow.  Latency is roughly 120ms to
&gt; what appears to be the box I'm dialling into.  Downloads seem to max at
&gt; 4k/sec, when I'm apparently connected at 64kbps.  I've listed the main
&gt; config files below.
&gt; 
&gt; How does this compare with using a modem on the same service?

The modem outdoes the ISDN atm, but I think ISDN just beats it in terms of latency...  (only just!).

&gt; Due to the current popularity of DSL, the 2nd hand market is littered with
&gt; ISDN routers for $100-$200 if you're happy to buy one that doesn't do DoV.

Yeah, but there's nothing wrong with the NT1 Plus II, and it's worth a try getting it going in Linux =)

I have a feeling I shouldn't be using pppd tho, because it may be assuming the connection is asynchronous?
