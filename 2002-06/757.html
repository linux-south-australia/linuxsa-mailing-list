Sorry to just jump in on this, ( i have not followed the thread)  but just to say.

Seagate are aware on a software raid problem with their 60g IDE drives, seems 
perfomance takes a big hit when raided up.  This is from the latest Atomic mag.

No other info, but more details could be found from seagate I'm sure.

&gt;&gt;I have a fair few servers in similar situations, and I have 
&gt;&gt;cooked 10krpm
&gt;&gt;drives due to lack of airflow.  I fully agree that drives can 
&gt;&gt;and do operate
&gt;&gt;fine at high temperatues, but there are limits.  
&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Whist on the subject, does anyone have opinions on RAID 5?  
&gt;&gt;I've had three
&gt;&gt;servers now where RAID 5 hasn't helped because two drives have 
&gt;&gt;died at the
&gt;&gt;same time (or more precisely, a second drive dies before I can get a
&gt;&gt;replacement for the first).  
&gt;
&gt;On the first bit, we have also cooked a couple 10k SCSI drives due
&gt;to lack of ventilation.  We had 4 of them setup in RAID 5 and 1 died,
&gt;strangely enough before we could get a replacement a second one went
&gt;AWOL as well............must be something in the air........caused all
&gt;sorts of hassles because at the time it was our main file storage box
&gt;and quite a number of users lost data from anything they had open at the
&gt;time.  We ended up replacing it with a single IDE drive as a "temporary"
&gt;measure, temporary being a little over 12 months and counting :), I'm 
&gt;about to replace it with a software RAID setup using IDE drives rather
&gt;than SCSI.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;success rate has been with IBM.  I've heard/read though that 
&gt;&gt;IBM has sold
&gt;&gt;off their HDD business to Quantum.  I've also heard Fujitsu is 
&gt;&gt;getting out of the HDD market.  Who knows :)
&gt;
&gt;If Quantum are going to manufacture IBM's drives or rebadge them etc, then
&gt;I wouldn't touch them as far as I could throw them.  Our main supplier used
&gt;to use Quantum drives in their workstations, I'd estimate in the last 3
&gt;years
&gt;that we've returned 20% of those drives under warranty.  They now use
&gt;Seagate,
&gt;with which (touch wood) we have had no problems so far.
&gt;
&gt;(on the bright side the number of failures in our workstation drives has
&gt;proven
&gt;to be very effective education for users about storing their data on the
&gt;server ;)
