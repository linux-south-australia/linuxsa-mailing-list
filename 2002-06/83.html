Hello,

After reading the entire saga of patent vs copyright vs hacking vs stealing
vs parallel development, this seems to be a discussion of free trade and
computer ethics.

I agree with some of it and disagree with other parts, I think this is just
a philosophical argument along the lines of:

If I write a program, and let a company use it for free, is it mine or the
company's?

If I take an open source program, modify it into a program for my company to
use, is it the company's or the open source community's?

If I take an open source program, modify it into a program I like, make an
executable but don't release the source, and then sell it for a nice profit,
who does it belong to?

If I make a copy of the software CD I bought, in case it gets damaged or
fails to work, is this reasonable?

If I make a software package which is similar to Microsoft Office products,
and even appears to look similar, and it can even read and modify Microsoft
Office documents, and called it MyOffice, then give it away, is this wrong?

If I write a Unix operating system to run on a PC, using Kernighan and
Ritchie's "C" programming language, but I use the same commands and the same
feel that you would find on a Copyrighted Unix system, and then let anyone
have a copy of my version of Unix, calling it "Linux", is this breaking
copyright or stealing Research material from two Scientists????

If wishes were horses and beggars could ride .....

	&gt; On the contrary, that was exactly what he said.
	&gt; 

	[shrug] I've never head of him saying that. Got a refernce?

	&gt; 
	&gt; Frequently (and becoming more so) the only way to achieve that is
by
	&gt; violating patent rights.  C.f. GIF.
	&gt; 

	Were that true, it would be indicative of a broken patent system,
not 
	Stallman having broken ideology. If the patent system prevents 
	implementing an application or library with similar functionality,
then 
	it *is* fundamentally broken.

	You said previously (in 
	
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:Pine.LNX.4.21.0206031312070.26645-100000@huachuca.tellurian.com.au">Pine.LNX.4.21.0206031312070.26645-100000@huachuca.tellurian.com.au</A>&gt;) 
	that patents are designed to encourage progress, but here you're
saying 
	they hinder progress? Which one is it?

	&gt; Apart from the fact that Sharpe would likely then go broke
(remember
	&gt; the $20 million he had to pay up front), and in the process,
become a
	&gt; poster-child for people looking for a reason *not* to invest in
research?
	&gt; None at all.

	I'd tend to agree with Toby Corkindale's response 
	&lt;<A HREF="mailto:Pine.LNX.4.33.0206031427150.8594-100000@localhost.localdomain">Pine.LNX.4.33.0206031427150.8594-100000@localhost.localdomain</A>&gt;. If
the 
	technology is that groundbreaking, it could take years for an
OSS/Free 
	project to implement similar functionality.
