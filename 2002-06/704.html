&gt;Buy new HDs for the OS, install on those.  
&gt;HD's cheap and it gives you an instant backout proceedure.

That's kinda what's got me to going to 7.3, I'm putting in 3 new
60gb IDE drives for data storage (software RAID) in place of the 
current single 30gb drive.  The OS is installed on an older 2gb
SCSI drive which I will keep as is.  Basically I will have an easy
'out' if it all goes wrong, been caught once like that, never again :)


&gt;I like to reinstall if I can as it means I know where it's 
&gt;upto, also it 
&gt;allows you to ensure YOU know how your machine is actually 
&gt;configured and what makes it tick.  

Know what you mean, though I do know what makes this one tick as I
was the one who set it up originally :)


&gt;Optional: Document what you did so that the next guy 
&gt;can fix it.

Optional??  Hmmm, dunno if I'd class documentation as optional.....

In a previous life when I support primarily NT boxen I didn't 
document a whole lot, only the important stuff, because you refresh
your memory by fixing things regularly.

Now that I've been using Linux for a while I've gotten in to the
habit of documenting pretty much everything, because the damn thing
hardly ever fails so when I go to fix it I wouldn't remember how if it 
wasn't documented, probably the only "downside" to using Linux, it
doesn't fail often enough for you to keep your skills up ;) &lt;tongueincheek&gt;
