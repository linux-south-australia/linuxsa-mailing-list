&lt;snipped a lot&gt;

If Sharpe employed 20 highly capable programmers, fulltime, for 5 years,
then I very much doubt that a couple of hundred programmers, varying in
skill from brilliant to average, working on it a little in their spare time
and spending half their time flaming people for using HTML email, could
actually come up with a superior replacement in a hurry.

Sharpe still has plenty of time to recoup his investment, and by the time
the free software was released, he'd have a dominant market share,
presumably a happy client base, and enough time to work on new features and
improvements. I'd say it would be inevitable that a "Free" version would be
released eventually, but its certainly not the overnight photocopy operation
you seem to be indicating.

How long did it take for OpenOffice to come out and present something thats
only just approaching the same level of stability, speed, features, and
reliability of MS Office '97 SR2?

Remember that Stallman is not advocating piracy. Creating something that
"works alike" but was developed independantly is totally different, and also
requires a lot more work.

Eg:
GIMP is a great contender for graphical editing. I won't use anything else.
However Photoshop and its cheaper clone, Paintshop pro, are both still
selling very well. The competition is probably healthier for the consumers
too in the end, since the commercial software has to show it has better
quality, support, and features.

For instance, Microsoft's products only started improving once they got
scared of Linux and alternatives encroaching on their market share.
