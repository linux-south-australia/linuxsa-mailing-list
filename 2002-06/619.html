Hello...

Just thought I'd answer some questions.

&gt;out of interest, how big is your company? How many desktops? One of my
&gt;clients use Linux for 15 of their 20-odd desktops, and they are not
&gt;highly computer literate -- they are not even in the computer
&gt;industry. Works OK mostly, but really does require some setting up to
&gt;make it workable for them.
&gt;

My company has 10 employees and the same number of desktops.

To satisfy your curiosity further:

We have a netgear firewall, 1 netware 4.11 server (PII), 2 samba servers 
(PIII-850X2 40-GIG and Pentium Pro x 2  512 MBram 18 GIG - [cost 300 to 
buy]), 1 WindowsNT 3.5 server on an old compaq proliant (486- 8GIG [cost 
$75 to buy]), 3 hubs and 1 dsl router, 2 HP printers, 1 small netgear 
print server, 3 laptops, and two additional part time desks. We also 
have some older workstations being used for spare parts or as an 
archieve. Most of the desktops in circulation are pentium 3's but we 
have a few pentium 2's in circulation, with a few 486's in storage. At 
most only 2 workstations have identical hardware.

Sounds like just the candy shop any good "Stallman style" hacker would 
have an appetite for...  :-)

&gt;
&gt;&gt;I will usually think of something really neat that we ought to want to 
&gt;&gt;do and work very hard to figure out how the thing works. [God forbid if 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;"ought to want to do"... hmm... IMHO, any changes that are made need
&gt;to have good business reasons for them. In most cases, this means one
&gt;of two things: They will save the business money, or they will make
&gt;the business money. If it fits into neither category, then it's
&gt;probably not worth doing. Of course, many things are long term, and
&gt;the benefits are not immediately obvious, but still, in nearly every
&gt;case, it has to be one or the other (or both). Not saying that you're
&gt;not doing that -- you may well be -- but even for yourself, the
&gt;benefits have to be greater than the cost, or the frustrations really
&gt;will get to you...
&gt;
What I really meant was this:  we need to get rid of spam, its costing 
us $,, Linux has spamassassin... next thought.... Wow I get to learn 
that...how neat!! :-)  

 I only perform Linux R&D after work hours - but I will usually deploy 
the feature or program  during work hours.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I didn't have the wonderful help from helpful people like yourselves. 
&gt;&gt;:-) ] In a nutshell, I have found the Linux experience to be a whole lot 
&gt;&gt;of work, a whole lot of learning followed by disappointment that what I 
&gt;&gt;wanted to do does not work, followed by some type of overall sucess 
&gt;&gt;blemished by the struggle to get there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yep.
&gt;
&gt;When I work with Windows, which I do when I am doing desktoppy type
&gt;things, I know the set of things that I need to do (email, word
&gt;processing, web browsing, occasional sshing, and printing), and I know
&gt;that I can do all of those things with minimal excess effort. When I'm
&gt;doing those things, I don't want to be thinking about the OS, I just
&gt;want to do those things.
&gt;
&gt;When I work with Linux (or Solaris, or FreeBSD), which I do when I am
&gt;doing almost anything else, particularly server and networking type
&gt;things, I know that I can do almost anything, but I will generally
&gt;have to think about it. That is OK, because the things that I need to
&gt;do (security, file serving, email servers, print servers, web servers,
&gt;VPNs, etc etc) all require thought, and so my time is not
&gt;unproductive. I know that were I to do it on Windows, I would be
&gt;incapable of doing some of these things, and would be restricted from
&gt;making the deicisions that I need to make (just point and click, and
&gt;away it goes -- don't worry, it's secure by itself), whereas on Linux,
&gt;I know that I am the one making the decisions.
&gt;
&gt;Also, I'm a sysadmin -- which means that this kind of thing is my
&gt;vocation, and I don't mind doing it. If it doesn't appeal, don't do
&gt;it. :) It's really really hard to balance two vocations -- try to be
&gt;one thing, and be the best you can at that, rather than trying to do
&gt;two things badly... What I'm saying is that it's the struggle that
&gt;makes sysadmins valuable -- if it were easy, we'd be well-paid
&gt;monkeys, but we're not...
&gt;

To answer this, I had to do some more thinking. Oddly enough, the 
frutration will become extreme satisfaction when I succeed.


&gt;
&gt;&gt;When I first started I knew nothing of Samba and didn't have an extra 
&gt;&gt;server lying around to experiment with... So I felt that it was 
&gt;&gt;essential for us to access clinet data stored on our Netware 4.11 
&gt;&gt;server.  I already had Red Hat but my knowledge was limited - so I was 
&gt;&gt;at first very happy to see that Red Hat 7 claimed to be IPX compatable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;yep... :)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;After I installed the thing I looked for a GUI login for Netware - a 
&gt;&gt;netware client. None anywhere - that took a few hours...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I've never used Netware, so I don't know quite what would be needed
&gt;here, but I suspect that any network management type thing (user
&gt;authentication, etc) is complex no matter what the technology.
&gt;Certainly, there's more to it than being able to talk IPX... :)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I search the Internet for guidance for a few hours....finally something 
&gt;&gt;about having to recompile my kernel, a bunch of writing in the how to 
&gt;&gt;that made absolutely no sense to me...another 8 hours down the drain. 
&gt;&gt;However, I go to bed happy because I found Caldera's web site...which 
&gt;&gt;had a Netware Client for Linux how to page.  Surely that feature must be 
&gt;&gt;included in Caldera Open Linux I reasoned.  So I bought the thing on 
&gt;&gt;line and waited anxiously for a week for it to arrive.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Mmm... I think Netware is not as popular as it used to be, so support
&gt;is harder to come by...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;When I got it, big disappointment, it did not have a Netware Client in 
&gt;&gt;it.  I called up Caldera and Red Hat for help.  Caldera's line sent me 
&gt;&gt;directly to a local computer shop. The person that answered the phone 
&gt;&gt;barely spoke English and said "Netwooo? Client...what is that?" I called 
&gt;&gt;Red Hat and asked for help and the guy started talking about his client 
&gt;&gt;portfolio. I reached another department at Caldera and they said "well, 
&gt;&gt;you could pay us $3,000 for a year of support..." At this point I 
&gt;&gt;thought, "what a bunch of bozo's!
&gt;&gt;...Microsoft is cheaper!" Obviously we weren't going to pay $3,000 for 
&gt;&gt;something we had already.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;... but you didn't have it, did you? Nothing's free. Even Linux --
&gt;some time and/or expertise is needed, and that's not free.
&gt;
There is  a Windows netware client that can be downloaded for free.   I 
guess we paid for it already when we set up the server. We didn't want 
to pay $3,000 to enable Linux to log us into the nerware server, but not 
have our tax or financial statement software available for use.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Caldera sent me the NKFS package, I had to complain to get it sent to me 
&gt;&gt;as I could not find it.  They said just compile this into your kernel. 
&gt;&gt;To say the least I hadn't a clue.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I didn't give up and searched the Internet again - I came across some 
&gt;&gt;posts from Linuxsa asking about the netware client for Linux but no 
&gt;&gt;answers. BTW - that's how I found you all - :-)  .  This time I found a 
&gt;&gt;post at the novellfans board from Victor Baldassi giving me an essential 
&gt;&gt;piece of the puzzle for getting a Novell 4.11 client for Linux. I found 
&gt;&gt;some more posts and put it together and the 
&gt;&gt;HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLUUUUUUUAAAAAA! 
&gt;&gt; It worked.....(That's a Back to the Future it Worked)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;hmm. well done :) We've all had frustrating situations like that --
&gt;sometimes it's things we thought were possible, then find out they
&gt;aren't, then invent or discover a workaround, and sometimes it's
&gt;things that we aren't even sure are possible, but need to make them
&gt;work anyway...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So at this point I felt morally obligated to post my findings in the 
&gt;&gt;clearest most complete way I could.  I posted one message here and one 
&gt;&gt;at computing.net to answer the unanswered questions that I had seen.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Here it is:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/8273.html">http://computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/8273.html</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Nice... I assume thats' not your real password :)
&gt;
Answer 1: I didn't say sesame did I? oopsie!   ;-)  
Answer 2: Nope, but thanks for asking! ;-)

&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;But I have now found that if more than say 5 - 10 computers log into the 
&gt;&gt;netware server through Linux, everybody gets kicked off.  The netware 
&gt;&gt;server monitor has a rip router message. I know nothing of rip routers, 
&gt;&gt;and have no way of figuring out how or why this takes place. I can't 
&gt;&gt;read a packet sniffer.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;RIP is routing information protocol, at least in TCP/IP land... I'm
&gt;not sure if it has a different meaning in IPX... &lt;looks it up&gt; ...
&gt;yep, RIP is routing information protocol in IPX as well, but it's a
&gt;different RIP than the TCP/IP RIP ... you may want to talk to a novell
&gt;person about this ...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I finally got bold enough to compile a kernel and its no biggie. 
&gt;&gt;However, when I tried to load the NKFS module I got s message that was 
&gt;&gt;somewhat like this:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Per Linus Torvalds...change your module...So I still haven't got that 
&gt;&gt;module compiled into my kernel.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;yep :) welcome to the world of the sysadmin ...
&gt;
&gt;If you paste the actual message, the kernel version, and what patch or
&gt;module you added, and relevant config settings, someone here may be
&gt;able to help you.... however, if this is all to do with the RIP
&gt;problem above, I'd be inclined to find a Novell CNE to help you with
&gt;it first -- you may be barking up the wrong tree.
&gt;

I keep saying this...its a great group. :-)




&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;And such has been my experience with Linux so far.  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;All good things come with pain. :)
&gt;

I agree absolutely  - now that my temper tantrum is over...





&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If you really want to be a sysadmin (and it can be fun, and very
&gt;rewarding, both personally and financially), keep at it. Don't be
&gt;afraid to really learn -- find out what IPX really means as compared
&gt;with TCP/IP, find out how Netware authenticates, how it shares data
&gt;etc... It will make solving problems like this so much easier :)
&gt;
&gt;rr
&gt;
Thanks for taking the time Rich! :-)
