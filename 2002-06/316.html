Hi Peter,

Last month two people seemed to have the same symptoms. Their emails are 
probably archived on the linuxsa web site.   

 From what I remember - there are three approaches to solving the 
problem.  If none of these work, maybe one of the  "big boys" could help 
you out. I am enthusiastic, but I am not the "Shaq of Samba" either - I 
am more like a "Samba Marine" ;-)  - so I am not qualified to say which 
of these will work best.  If none of these work, perhaps one of the 'big 
boys' can.


Anyway -

1. One very helpful workaround was posted by Dez on June 24 -

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;As for the Windows 2000 problem, I found out that from at least 
&gt;2.2.1a onwards, if you are not using windbind, you should set "nt acl
&gt;support" to "no" and this should fix the problem.  We have tried this and so
&gt;far so good....

&gt;	Addendum to the Windows 2000 fix:  You cannot use the cacls command
&gt;from the dos prompt on the workstation to alter the permissions on the
&gt;unix/linux files and you can no longer see the permissions tab when looking
&gt;at the file via the Windows Properties screen.

&lt;snip&gt;

2. Another helpful alternative approach was posted by Ryan on June 3

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Success!

&gt;Someone told me about a different version of samba, TNG
&gt;(<A HREF="http://www.samba-tng.org/">http://www.samba-tng.org/</A>) which worked beautifully.   It has some extra
&gt;cool things in it too which I can use for this particular application I'm
&gt;developing.

&gt;Lets just hope a new hotfix from M$ doesn't break things completely.. It
&gt;wouldn't surprise me.

&gt;Cheers all who helped, greatly appreciated
&gt;- Ryan

&lt;snip&gt;

 
3. The third alternative is to make Windows behave. (I tell 'Bill' to 
'go sit in the corner' by editing the Windows 2000 registry and 
automating the mapping of network drives.)

Take a look at 9 & 10.

 

Hope I was of some help,


James Leone

&gt;Hi
&gt;Im Bit of a new person to linux but am picking up fast. Ive love all of it
&gt;so far and have started to set it up a as NT domain server and Web server
&gt;The NT domain part work rather easy to set up but i have encouted a few
&gt;problems I had set it all up and the windows 2000 professional computers
&gt;that are connected to the Linux server. They will register it in network
&gt;neighbourhood and when I went in to control panel to add the 2000 nt
&gt;computers into the domain. I  supplied my username and password and that
&gt;would work fine and then I went to connect to the domain Windows said that
&gt;the credentials don't match so I rebooted both computers and now the windows
&gt;box wont even register the Linux. I have tried  a Ping and its all on the
&gt;net what seems to Be the problem?
&gt;Thanks In Advance
