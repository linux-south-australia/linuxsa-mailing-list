&gt;&gt;I'm looking for a source of antenna that Galaxy Pay TV used to use.
&gt;&gt;Anyone know where I can get a couple of these babies?
&gt;&gt;Want to set up a wireless link between buildings.

&gt;Hills Industries supplied all of the Galaxy antenna's.   When Galaxy went
&gt;bust they redesigned the feed antenna and now sell them over the counter in
&gt;Edwardstown for WLAN work.

&gt;You will be lucky to find the aluminium grid packs that Galaxy originally
&gt;rolled out, there are not that many around.  The powder coated grid packs
&gt;have an integrated LNA/Downconverter up front which makes them difficult to
&gt;modify.  So unless you are a 2.4Ghz antenna guru you are better off paying
&gt;the $$$ and buying one new from Hills.

The old Conifer's are by far the best I've seen (a well mod'd one performs
as good if not better than a commercial offering such as PacSat's).  The new
Hill's 'purpose built' ones are next-to-useless.  They offer a "25dB" gain
which performs worse than a mod'd Conifer 18dB and weighs 5 times as much.
(These results are 'real world' over a 22km link - I got rid of the Hills as
quick as I could.)

-Michael.

PS  I purchased three pallet loads of 18dB Conifer ex Galaxy dishes and have
been selling them off over the last year or so (my way of getting a few
dishes effectively for free).  One may therefore assume that my opinion is
biased.  My experience started with a 24dB Conifer mounted at one end, and
an 18dB Conifer at the other.  Sadly the signal strength wasn't quite what I
needed so I looked for another 24dB Conifer.  Along the way I 'found' the
Hills 25dB dishes, and got all excited, but found it performed worse.  I
then purchased a brand new 24dB PacSat which basically performed the same as
the Conifer (and cost me about 10 times as much).
