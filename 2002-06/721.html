&gt; 
&gt; Has Telstra finally caught up with DoV users?
&gt; Posted by Dan Warne   Wednesday at 10:28 pm
&gt; Telstra appears to have clamped down on a billing loophole in 
&gt; its ISDN system that users have been exploiting for some time.

DOV looks like it will live to see another day. Below is clarification
on the problem by Guy Ellis from Traverse.

Joseph

Hiya,

I just thought I'd summarise last nights events. As it turns out Paul
Day 
had his Linux system misconfigured and it was actually placing DATA
calls. 
To make matters worse the ISP also had the Access Server misconfigured
and 
it was accepting DATA calls on the advertised DOV number. Boy talk about

bad luck.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my post last night, it seems that 
no-one else has had a problem with either Mark I and Mark II NT1s.

SOME IMPORTANT TIPS ON DOV (updated 27-06-02)...

(i) Don't forget to prepend the dialled number with a 'V' (upper or
lower 
case).

(ii) If you are a Windows user, in your Dialup Networking icon make sure

you DO NOT have the box ticked for "Use area code and Dialing
Properties" 
as this will insert an area code in front of the "V" and your call will
not 
be a DOV call !

(iii) If you are using Linux , check the kernel log file
/var/log/messages 
: the CALL TYPE (the Bearer Capability i.e. Data or Voice) for all
outgoing 
calls is logged in this file each time the system makes a call. MAKE
SURE 
IT IS VOICE. If the DOV patch has not been installed or applied
correctly, 
the CALL TYPE message will not appear at all. A correct DOV patch
install 
will generate one of the following messages:
"Call type is DOV (Data over Voice)"
or
"Call type is DATA"

(iv) Standard Linux kernels DO NOT INCLUDE DOV support and MUST BE
PATCHED. 
I have submitted patch for DOV and it should be included in 2.4.20 - 
meanwhile PATCH YOUR KERNEL!

(v) Always check the CALL TYPE after installing new drivers or any
patches 
- this applies to all operating systems! If using Windows a good way to
do 
this is to call a Telstra number (eg. your home phone number or mobile 
number) and make sure that it rings. Try again without the V - if it
DOES 
NOT ring then this will confirm you are using a timed data call and you
can 
put the V back with confidence. Note that Optus numbers will always ring

for both DOV and ISDN data calls, so the test is not reliable in this
case, 
nor is it reliable from Linux : use one of the other methods above.

(vi) We recommend that you use an ISP that has a DOV ONLY access number.

That way if you are misconfigured for Data calls, you can't connect to
your 
ISP.
Also check that your ISP has his Access Server configured correctly -
place 
a Data call to the DOV number and make sure it is rejected.

(vii) Subscribe to online billing from Telstra - it's free and you can 
check yesterday's phone bill. Try <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/billing/">http://www.telstra.com.au/billing/</A>

Cheers,

  - Guy.
