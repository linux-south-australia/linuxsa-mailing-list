&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; After reading the entire saga of patent vs copyright vs hacking vs stealing
&gt; vs parallel development, this seems to be a discussion of free trade and
&gt; computer ethics.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with some of it and disagree with other parts, I think this is just
&gt; a philosophical argument along the lines of:
&gt; 
&gt; If I write a program, and let a company use it for free, is it mine or the
&gt; company's?

Yours, unless you assign copyright to the company. Letting the company
use it for free is merely licensing.

&gt; 
&gt; If I take an open source program, modify it into a program for my company to
&gt; use, is it the company's or the open source community's?

The original copyright still applies to old code, and whatever copyright
you claim on your code also applies to that code. The program as a whole
is under joint ownership.

However, if you are using other people's code (code that someone else
holds copyright on) under the terms of the GPL, you have to release your
code under the GPL as well. If it's covered by the BSD licence, you can
do what you want with it, as long as you display the BSD licence's
copyright notice. If it's under another licence (eg a commercial one), I
don't know.

&gt; 
&gt; If I take an open source program, modify it into a program I like, make an
&gt; executable but don't release the source, and then sell it for a nice profit,
&gt; who does it belong to?


As above, both in regards to copyright and in regards to licensing. Of
course, if you are using code released to you under the GPL, then what
you are trying to do is illegal, and hence you belong to satan and will
be mailbombed and vilified by Open Sourcerers everywhere, and maybe face
lawsuit, which you may or may not win, depending on how well-written the
GPL really is.

On the other hand, if it's released to you under a BSD style licence,
you're quite welcome as long as you leave the copyright notice in place.

&gt; 
&gt; If I make a copy of the software CD I bought, in case it gets damaged or
&gt; fails to work, is this reasonable?

It may well be reasonable, but whether it's legal or not depends on the
terms under which you bought (or more likely, licenced) the software,
and how those terms are interpreted by whichever legal system covers it.

&gt; 
&gt; If I make a software package which is similar to Microsoft Office products,
&gt; and even appears to look similar, and it can even read and modify Microsoft
&gt; Office documents, and called it MyOffice, then give it away, is this wrong?

Now we're into ethics, and I don't think it's wrong. I don't really
think many people would think it's wrong, though some may (particularly
those on the MS payroll -- which may or may not include the judge(s)
presiding over a hypothetical court case).

However, if it looks similar enough to be encroaching on copyright (and
how that is interpreted, I don't know), then it may not be legal...
Also, if it uses algorithms that are patented, and you have not been 
licenced to use those algorithms, then that may not be legal either. Of
course, whether it's right or wrong to patent algorithms is another
issue altogether...

&gt; 
&gt; If I write a Unix operating system to run on a PC, using Kernighan and
&gt; Ritchie's "C" programming language, but I use the same commands and the same
&gt; feel that you would find on a Copyrighted Unix system, and then let anyone
&gt; have a copy of my version of Unix, calling it "Linux", is this breaking
&gt; copyright or stealing Research material from two Scientists????

Well, it's my understanding that the (R) in UNIX(R) doesn't have
anything to do with the commands and "feel", but only with the name
"UNIX". I could be wrong though. Of course, there are many other things
that may be copyrighted or patented, and you may or may not have
permission to use these...

For eg, you probably couldn't do a pixel-for-pixel imitation of (say)
CDE, even if you called it "Committee Designed Environment" instead.
That would be as much a copyright violation as selling RC Cola in
imitation Coke cans.

Likewise, you couldn't code a program based on a patented algorithm (say
GIF), and sell it, even if you called it "GNG" (GNG's Not GIF) instead
(or if you called it GIF). That would be as much a patent violation as
selling Coke made to the real Coke recipe in your own cans (assuming the
Coke recipe is actually patented).

Of course, if you sold your own Coke (using the real recipe) in
imitation Coke cans, you would be violating both Copyright and
Patents... Unless, like CCA, you are licenced to do so by the original
Copyright and Patent holder(s).

I just thought I'd get all that in before Mark Newton did ;)
