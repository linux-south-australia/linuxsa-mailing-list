Did you try disabling DFS?  Map the drives with a VBS script? I just 
want to know if this helps solve the problem with XP.

&gt;&gt;Have a look at 2.2.4 or the soon to be released 2.2.5. I have not yet
&gt;&gt;looked at XP and the issues around XP, but they are probably surmountable
&gt;&gt;with a little bit of coding. It might also be possible to set a registry
&gt;&gt;entry in XP to stop it doing what it is doing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;2.2.4 wouldn¹t run as a PDC with XP machines.  I grabbed a 2.2.5 prerelease
&gt;from CVS, and it didn't help.
&gt;
&gt;The registry key(s) made -tng work, but not normal samba.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Send mail on <A HREF="mailto:samba-technical@samba.org.">samba-technical@samba.org.</A> You are more likely to get answers
&gt;&gt;there.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I believe I did - I sent multiple mails to the samba mailing list, but
&gt;weirdly enough nobody seemed to have any experience on why it wasn't working
&gt;on my setup.  Some said it worked, some said it didn't.
&gt;
&gt;TNG would be fine if I knew why it was dying :(

&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Normal Samba would not work with XP.  I tried it from ports, I tried it from
&gt;&gt;&gt;a source tar.gz on the samba site, and the 2_2 from CVS (3_0 would core dump
&gt;&gt;&gt;on me when I tried to use it, and I've heard Very Bad Things about its
&gt;&gt;&gt;stability, so I'd prefer to stick with 2.X).  I also tried downgrading to
&gt;&gt;&gt;2.0.X, but XP still wouldn't authenticate properly.  (2K/NT/98 boxes would
&gt;&gt;&gt;run fine).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Samba-tng actually worked... Until now, anyway. :(
