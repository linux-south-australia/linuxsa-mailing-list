Sorry DSL, not sure that I follow this...

Hard task... but deciding what you are saying "Yes, but..." to is
equally hard...

&gt; 
&gt; Let's just say I decide to write "DSL - Fantastic Unbelievable Colourful
&gt; Kaleidoscope Of Fantastic Feeling". Kaleidoscopes do the following task:
&gt; 
&gt; * draw lots of dots in multi-colours in an arbitrary specified
&gt; rectangular area
&gt; 
&gt; ...and that's IT.
&gt; 
&gt; There aren't too many ways to do either...so once someone has written a
&gt; Really Good [tm] kaleidoscope is everyone breaking copyright or patent
&gt; or some other ridiculous piece of law when they write a kaleidoscope?

Well, certainly they are not breaking patents if you didn't patent it.
If you did patent it, then they may be able to defeat your patent in
court if it's frivoulous (assuming the lawyers understand this concept),
or if there is evidence of prior art.

As for copyright, I'm not really sure, but what you have described above
is uncopyrightable (although the actual text you used may be
copyrightable). You would have to have an actual implementation to
copyright, as I understand it. If my implementation imitated yours too
closely, I may be violating your copyright. Likewise, if the name of my
implementation was too close to yours ("RAR - Fantastic Unbelievable
Colourful Kaleidoscope Of Fantastic Feeling"), then I may be violating
your copyright on the name (but not neccessarily on the Kaleidoscope
itself). Of course, if I tried to sell mine as an acronym rather than a
full name, I may get in trouble with the censors, but that's a different
kettle of kipper.
