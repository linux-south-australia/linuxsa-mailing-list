&gt;I thought the snow you get was genuine noise on the same frequencies as
the
&gt;tv channels are upon, and thats why i didn't think amplification was a
&gt;useful tool unless your signal loss/interference occured inbetween the
&gt;antenna and your receivers.

In a nutshell it depends on the signal to noise ratio at the receive site
and the specs of the tv receiver.   If the signal to noise ratio of the
originating signal is greater than the threshold of the receiver then a
mast head amp will make a marginal picture better.    Inadequate signal to
noise means a masthead amplifier will make the noise and signal stronger,
which just wastes valuable time and money.   Generally all of the tv-tuner
cards that I have seen/designed (past life) use Philips FM1216 tuners and
these are *very* good receivers and much better than your average TV/VCR of
yesteryear.

Another common problem with a vast majority of mast head amps is there is
generally not enough isolation between the input and output, hence they
make great oscillators with little provication.   If your masthead amp
takes off (starts oscillating) you start transmitting interference to all
of your neighbours which is NOT great either.   This is often misdiagnosed
by inexperienced tv antenna "experts" who then flease money for services
not rendered.  But that was in another life and I am glad I dont work in
that industry any more.
