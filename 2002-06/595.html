&gt; I know many people who willlike this sort of thing.
&gt; 	They don't care about Microsoft and they don't understand Linux 
&gt; (UNIX)etc. They just want heir computer to be some some sort of 
&gt; combination of a television, typewriter and canvas. 


Walmart in the USA have just announced a range of computers (sans 
monitor) with Lindows installed starting at US$299 and aiming at just 
the market you have described. For some it will be their first computer 
and they will be starting with something based on linux. I think that 
is good news. 

Maybe one day we can have even better news when people will be able 
tohandle Linux straight out of the box. We are not there yet but it 
really is not that far away, and Lindows is just one step along the 
path.

I am even thinking that it might be one way to release/recycle 
computers into the public, if it looks and smells like windows then you 
have overcome much of the public dislike of anything new and non-
conforming. 

I am not saying I am convinced it is the right way. Define right &lt;G&gt;

Cheers, Ian
