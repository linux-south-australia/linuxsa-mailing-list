Ah, indeed, our work is never over :-)

&gt; - if you don't know the theory exists then you won't know to look it up.
&gt; - if you don't know the theory then your code will be much more ordinary.

Oh, I couldn't agree with you more! The theory is *vital*. I just don't 
think that testing a CS student on how much theory s/he can memorize and 
regurgitate in 2 hours is a good indicator of how well s/he understands 
and is able to apply that theory. I'd much rather do a *heap* more 
code-based assignments as part of the assesment than do exams.

Of course, that costs money to mark - and heck, there aren't even any 
tutorials at 3rd year CS at Adelaide Uni because they can't afford it. 
There's one exam that I'm going into "blind" next week - no tutorials 
and 4 practicals, none of which have been marked yet. I could have 
completely misunderstood everything, and there's no feedback for me to 
realise this!

(Okay, I confess, you'd have to work hard to not realise if you've 
misunderstood, because the subject in question is Compiler Construction, 
and it's hard to write a compiler and *not* do some testing, and if 
you've done some testing, you'll soon figure out if the compiler works 
or not - hence, if you know what you're doing or not. But you get my 
point, I hope. :-)



(As an asside, I'm pleased that Adelaide Uni seems to have introduced a 
new rule for CS students in the last few years. Not only are the 
practical assignments compulsory [don't do them, get an IF] [which has 
been around as long as I've been there] but now if you don't achieve a 
certain mark in the assignments, your final grade is capped, regardless 
of what you get in the exam. Prevents people handing in "minimum effort 
solutions" at the last minute to avoid an IF, and then just proving they 
can regurgitate theory to get 85% from just their exam marks.... A Good 
Thing(TM), me thinks...)



(Yes, this is all just a way to not start doing practice exams for 
tomorrow. :-)



&gt; Cutting code is the computer science equivalent of manufacture.

I seem to recall a fortune quote something along the lines of "Computer 
Science is to Science as plumbing is to hydrology." :-) Apologies to 
whomever said it, esp. if I have it wrong. :-)

Cheers,
