Perth, Western Australia (June 19, 2002) - The Linux.conf.au 2003 organisers

* About Linux
-------------

Linux is a core part of a modern multi-user computer operating system
developed by a world-wide network of enthusiasts and professionals, and is
available for free under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
This license is special in that it specifically permits the end user access
to the underlying source code that creates the Linux kernel, and permits them
rights to modify it and redistribute it. The GPL is available from the Free
Software Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org">http://www.fsf.org</A>). It is this model of license that
leads to a "peer review" model of software development, since no part of the
program remains undisclosed to any interested party.

Many organisations including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell Computer are
adopting Linux kernel based operating systems for a variety of tasks, from
network servers to personal desktop machines and palm-sized devices.

The Linux kernel, in combination with a large selection of "user space" tools
and utility programs are combined to create a complete computer operating
systems, for example, Debian, Red Hat, SuSE, and MandrakeSoft.

As well as operating on commodity Intel based personal computers, Linux also
runs on a number of other types of computers, such as large mainframes and
commercial network servers, down to pocket organisers and wrist watches.
