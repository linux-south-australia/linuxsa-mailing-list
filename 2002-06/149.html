&gt; &gt; I don't think that unmotivated innovation is part of human 
&gt; &gt; nature. We're driven by needs, and in our society things like 
&gt; &gt; time and money are on top of the wishlist. When that's 
&gt; &gt; considered, there's no surprise that business or funding is 
&gt; &gt; somewhere behind most innovations.
&gt; 
&gt; That's actually the very question I am interested in finding the answer
&gt; to -- can an Open Source (patent-free, copyright-free) environment still
&gt; provide innovation? 

Well much open source code is definitely not copyright-free. Licenses
like the GPL rely on the enforcement of copyright. If you dig hard
enough I think you'll find that some projects are even covered by
patents whose owner has allowed them to be used with the Open Source
programs.

&gt; I haven't seen much of it, to be honest. Reiser sounds pretty
&gt; innovative, but I think it's publicly funded, which means it's less
&gt; a product of Open Source per se, more a product of DARPA...

Well I don't think you'll ever see a project sponsored by "Open
Source" :-) I also see from the web page that they are also sponsored
by SuSE - does that make it also a product of SuSE? What about open
source projects supported (often in terms of programming resources) by
large companies like HP or IBM? Do you think that programs like PHP or
Apache contain innovative ideas?

Is there a requirement for an idea to be innovative that someone has
made a lot of money out of selling it? :-)
