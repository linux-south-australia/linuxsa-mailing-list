&gt; &gt; That's actually the very question I am interested in finding the 
&gt; &gt; answer to -- can an Open Source (patent-free, copyright-free) 
&gt; &gt; environment still provide innovation?
&gt; 
&gt; Well much open source code is definitely not copyright-free. 

Sorry -- slip of the keyboard.

&gt; Licenses like the GPL rely on the enforcement of copyright. 
&gt; If you dig hard enough I think you'll find that some projects 
&gt; are even covered by patents whose owner has allowed them to 
&gt; be used with the Open Source programs.

indeed. I suppose I mean just Open Source, as in without income
generated by licencing of product, patents, or copyrighted material.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I haven't seen much of it, to be honest. Reiser sounds pretty 
&gt; &gt; innovative, but I think it's publicly funded, which means 
&gt; it's less a 
&gt; &gt; product of Open Source per se, more a product of DARPA...
&gt; 
&gt; Well I don't think you'll ever see a project sponsored by 
&gt; "Open Source" :-) I also see from the web page that they are 

Heh -- doesn't the FSF sponsor some projects?

&gt; also sponsored by SuSE - does that make it also a product of 
&gt; SuSE? What about open source projects supported (often in 
&gt; terms of programming resources) by large companies like HP or 

True... 

&gt; IBM? Do you think that programs like PHP or Apache contain 
&gt; innovative ideas?

Probably, but I don't know that they are really innovations in
themselves -- at least, not innovations on a grand scale. Apache is just
a very good web server, and PHP a very good scripting language. AFAIK,
neither was first, neither really created a market, and neither is
fundamentally innovative.

&gt; 
&gt; Is there a requirement for an idea to be innovative that 
&gt; someone has made a lot of money out of selling it? :-)

Nah...

I suppose I'm really looking for innovations that really changed things
somehow. Ideally, innovations that the closed source software world has
then imitated, similar to the way the open source world imitates closed
source's innovations. .. .. Definitions are getting awfully confused
here, but hey -- it makes sense in my head.
