&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I want to configure our mail server to use spam assassin. It's
&gt; currently using sendmail and mailertables to forward incoming mail to
&gt; an internal Exchange server.
&gt; 
&gt; Reading the spamassassin documentation, I seem to have 2 options,
&gt; using procmail or the spamass milter. Currently, in my mailertable, I
&gt; have something like this to do the relaying:
&gt; 
&gt; mydomain.com relay:[10.0.0.1]
&gt; 
&gt; I can set up a procmail entry in mailertables to run the mail through
&gt; spamassassin first, eg:
&gt; 
&gt; :0fw
&gt; | spamc
&gt; 
&gt; But can I then relay the filtered mail to the Exchange server? If so,
&gt; how?  Or is there a better way?

As other have written, the "milter" method is probably the best and most 
transparent. If you are currently using sendmail as a relay between the 
outside world and Exchange, then you can just add SpamAssassin (SA) as a 
milter and basically keep the config the same. It will still act as a relay, 
but will filter all incoming (and outgoing) mail though SA.

There are tools out there that just let you add just SA as a milter to 
sendmail, but the most widely used configuration seems to be to use it in 
conjunction with MIMEDefang.

What does not seem to have been mentioned is that you need a pretty much 
up-to the minute version of Sendmail, and it needs to be configured to enable 
milters.

I just recently implemented this on a RH 7.3 system, and was a good boy and 
built sendmail 8.12.4 as an RPM with milters etc enabled, so if you are 
running Redhat and want a copy just let me know (probably only any good 
if you are using RH 7.3 though).

SA as a milter is a bit fiddly to setup, but once going it is virtually 
maintenance free and very effective. MIMEDefang is good for getting rid of 
"web bugs", javascript etc from mail message, but it can be customised to 
allow it though from a "white list" of hosts if you have partners that insist 
on sending such stuff. 

I could be wrong, but I think that you can only get the *embedded* SA score 
"reports" (show why a message was flagged as spam) by using it in conjunction 
with MIMEDefang. By embedded I mean that the report is appended to the bottom 
of the suspect mail message.

MIMEDefang is very versatile, and not limited to just filtering SPAM. More 
info is available from:
