Do not allow this to cause you to stress. This is the normal state of
affairs.

I submitted a request a week ago and have had no response of any kind.
It also looks like the page is more used for registering currently
vacent domain names. I rang the phone numbers on the web site but the
person listed no longer works there and no one knows anything about it.

This is also normal. Remain calm :-)

You mentioned that you have called the number on the web site. You mean
Brian Howse? Indeed, he has left. However, last time I did the whole
re-delegation round for this domain, Adrian Brown, who looks after[1]
the Catholic Schools was able to put me in contact with someone in
Adelaide *not* at TAFE that has the authority and access to make the
changes.

Sorry I can't remember who it is, but just persevere with phoning
people. You'll get a response eventually. PITA if you needed it
yesterday, but, of course, your customer didn't leave it to the last
minute, because they know how to plan, right? :-)


Cheers,

[1] "Looks after" meaning used to do it, doesn't any more, doesn't like
it when you call him, if you can catch him, but what else can you do?
No-one has updated the web site.
