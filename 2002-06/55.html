&gt; &gt;I'm 90% sure that you *don't* need to (I'd have thought that if it was

&gt; 
&gt; I think you give MS too much credit here. Their products have a history of
&gt; accepting very broken versions of common 'standards', which leads to
&gt; correctly complying products reporting errors. Thanks to the massive
&gt; installed base of windows users, we end up with the typical head-in-the-sand
&gt; response "Well it works on windows, so it must be your crappy software,
&gt; windows IS the standard".

Perhaps. I'll see how I go, but I'd have thought that something *this
critical* to XML wouldn't be ommitted. However, I'll be less than
surprised if my investigations reveal that IE6 does indeed fail to
comply to the XML standard.

&gt; Although Netscape 4 may not have been that company's best work at the time,
&gt; you can bet that it's demise was mostly due to the "but it works in IE"
&gt; crowd.

Definitely. Perhaps it also had something to do with the fact that it
was a buggy, slow horrid piece of software generally, too?
