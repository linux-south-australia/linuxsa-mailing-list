<H1>Interesting DNS "trick"</H1>

Whilst researching split zones (or views) in bind 9, I came across an 
interesting "trick" (as in: any command with paramaters sufficiently advanced 
is indinguishable from magic) in this command:

nslookup -q=txt -class=CHAOS version.bind. 0.0.0.0 &lt;-- or any name server 
IP/name here

Which will show the version of bind running on a name server, even remote 
ones. Also of interest is the "hostname.bind" record, which will show (by 
default) the "real" hostname of the machine. The hostname part does not seem 
to work on bind v9, but does seem to work on 8.2.x versions of bind.

May be a minor security hole (only because people may query your bind 
version, then perhaps run an exploit if it is a certain version - but if you 
are running an old version of bind with exploits available you are probably 
root'd already) but it is easy to block requests for this record, then log 
attempted access to a file.

I am now logging attempted access to the version record, so it will be 
interesting to see if anyone ever does try and fetch it, as (aside from 
curiosity) I can't think why anyone would look  -unless they wanted to check 
for any exploitable version of bind. Oh, or unless they found this trick and 
were trying it out (that will be my defense ..)

Anyway, just something for the list ...

Andrew
