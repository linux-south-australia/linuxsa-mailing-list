Hey James,

Fetchmail does not 'take over' the role of sendmail on your system. What
it does is collect the mail from your ISP mailbox and then hand it over to
sendmail to handle it locally. It is then up to sendmail to call procmail
to do any fancy delivery things that you want.

In your situation, you probably won't need a .forward file to call
procmail (as sendmail uses procmail to do it's delivery stuff anyway), and
you can probably streamline your .procmailrc file to make it easier to
read and also to make it a bit faster to process at the same time. I was
running  the following for quite a while whilst I was testing
spamassassin, before making it run system wide:

# -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
# .procmailrc file

# Set up some environment variables
PATH=$HOME/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log
VERBOSE=on

# Run SpamAssassin
:0
|/usr/bin/spamassassin -P -c /usr/share/spamassassin

# Filter out spam
:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
$HOME/mail/CaughtSpam

# -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Note that you don't need to specify delivery for the 'default' mail, ie,
mail that doesn't match the filter spam rule, it will be delivered to your
system default mailbox, which is exactly where most programs on your
system will be expecting new mail to be. Don't change it unless you know
what you're doing, as it's going to break things (as you've noticed).

&gt; When I check with neyscape it says "no new messages"

Netscape is checking for new mail in /var/spool/mail/james, but you've
changed that, hence why it can't find any new messages. Try the above
(once you are sure you understand what is going on, don't just try it
because I said so!).

&gt; &gt;&gt;Justin, that was a fantastic presentation. I printed the whole thing
&gt; &gt;&gt;out. You were a very big help too.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;So, you definitely do not recommend redirecting email to a folder
&gt; &gt;&gt;besides /var/spool/mail on a stand alone workstation?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;My real problem is that I have our workers in the office using
&gt; &gt;&gt;nutscrape 6.  I was going to set up a script embedded in a desktop
&gt; &gt;&gt;icon  to enable them to check their mail, and land it in folder that
&gt; &gt;&gt;nutscrape
&gt; 6 would read automaticly after it was opened.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Most of our accounting applications only run in windblows.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm not sure I understand correctly - where is the mail currently
&gt; &gt;stored and accessed from? Is it somehow read from /var/spool/mail from
&gt; &gt;netscape on windows? Or is IMAP or POP or something similar in use?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Let me know what you currently have, and what you are trying to
&gt; &gt;achieve, and we'll go from there.
