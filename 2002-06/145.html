Personally, I like Toshibas -- well built, they use the nipple rather
than the pad (I like nipples), and they are generally well-supported.
However, the keyboard repeat problem sucks. I still get occasional
repeated letter pairs. Also, no matter what laptop you get, be very
careful to check all the model numbers of every major component (eg
graphics, network, etc), and make sure it's suppported under the version
of the OS you want to use. Mine has a Trident CyberBladeXP ALi, which
isn't supported under X, whereas CyberBladeXPm (for eg) is,
apparently...

&gt; Sometimes. It really depends.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am writing this on my Dell laptop while waiting for the 
&gt; bus - Linux 
&gt; &gt; runs like a dream.  Please do not mention Compaq again - I 
&gt; have heard 
&gt; &gt; horrible stories about Linux and Compaq - and IBM seems to 
&gt; have lost 
&gt; &gt; the plot in the consumer laptop market (they just put out 
&gt; hyped up cut 
&gt; &gt; down laptops for a hyped up price)
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't sound like you're really qualified to ask that I 
&gt; "...not mention Compaq again..." -- you're basing your 
&gt; opinion on heresay.
&gt; 
&gt; I've worked with *lots* of laptops including Compaq, and I'd grant you
&gt; that:
&gt; 
&gt; * They're expensive to repair.
&gt; 
&gt; * Compaq's turn-around times for parts are shocking.
&gt; 
&gt; However,
&gt; 
&gt; * They're built like brick shithouses (less so when compared to IBM,
&gt;   but still good).
&gt; 
&gt; * They generally use good quality components.
&gt; 
&gt; * Geeze, they just work
&gt; 
&gt; They're not quite perfect (by a long way), but they're 
&gt; certainly better than you give them credit for.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe the laptop is a good idea - solar panels or 12V Gel packs 
&gt; &gt; would do the trick - at least this laptop can be rigged up 
&gt; to external 
&gt; &gt; power easily while others can't.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to defeat the purpose of having a laptop to me. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; But if you do want a decent laptop - go Dell - it worked for me!
&gt; 
&gt; I'd never really recommend one, but there you go :-)
