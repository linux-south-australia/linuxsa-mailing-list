&gt; Oh, I couldn't agree with you more! The theory is *vital*. I just don't 
&gt; think that testing a CS student on how much theory s/he can memorize and 
&gt; regurgitate in 2 hours is a good indicator of how well s/he understands 
&gt; and is able to apply that theory. I'd much rather do a *heap* more 
&gt; code-based assignments as part of the assesment than do exams.

The problem here is that there's no guaruntee that the person
earning the degree did the assignments.

I've been to coding exams before, and they're not pretty.  If
you get tense before a standard exam, these will make you rigid
with fear.  One poor person was sick over their keyboard about
thirty seconds before the start.  I got my code running about
three minutes before the end and then almost didn't make it
when I accidently used a C comment rather than a LISP comment
when prettying the code.  One of my friends had a one line
'obvious' mistake he spotted a second after opening his listing
in the bar.  He lost about 30% of his term mark as the program
didn't run.

So given that most subjects have a practical and theory aspect
it seems best to do the practical by assignments and the theory
by some other means.

And I've sat tripos exams too (you, a chair, a panel of professors
all aiming to make you look a fool).  You don't want to demonstrate
your theory knowledge that way.

Capping the possible grade based on both the exam and assignment
results seems fair.

My perfect subject would fail people that failed the exam.  With
a friendly tripos allowed for poeple that failed the exam due to
nerves to give them a chance (you can usualy pick these people
when marking the exam paper).

I'd also have coding assignments, say 5, all due last day of term.
If you submit them earlier, you them them marked and returned within
a week.  I'd allow people to chose not to submit one of the five.
Thus people can have one assignment where they "just don't get it"
and stuff it up completely (like me, who wrote managed to write
a perfectly good compiler that output very nice code, but in doing
so turned the compiler into a table-driven three-code compiler rather
than the requested recursive descent compiler and blew 50% of the
marks on offer).

And a reading list, material in the list covered in the exam.

Beware if I ever move from research to academia and teach Networking 101
&lt;sound of manical laugh&gt;

Best wishes to all of you cramming for exams and rushing assignments,
Glen
