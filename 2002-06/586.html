Hi.

Something I have never found the answer for:

If I dd a 5 gig drive onto a 20 gig drive, the 20 gig will 'lose' the
extra space, right? Is there any way of recovering it?

&gt; 
&gt; Almost.
&gt; 
&gt; You really should bring the live linux box down to single user to do
&gt; this, or at least make sure that there is nothing that is writing to
&gt; the disk at the time...
&gt; 
&gt; Also, tar works by getting data and inodes, then re-creating them on
&gt; the target filesystem. You will have to create the filesystem(s) on
&gt; the new machine prior to untarring. Also note that tar only gets
&gt; files, not boot blocks etc, so you'll have to boot from something and
&gt; then re-run lilo.
&gt; 
&gt; dd or dump may make things easier for you -- I think dump still
&gt; requires you to create partitions and re-run lilo, but dd will do
&gt; everything exactly the same -- but make sure you have a big enough
&gt; drive (and remember that your partitioning will be _exactly_ the same
&gt; as on the old drive...
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever you do, make sure you make the backup on a system with
&gt; nothing writing to the drive, and that you test it before relying on
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I could use ghost, but i was wondering if it's possible using tar or
&gt; &gt; something so as to not down the server everytime to disupt users for an hour
&gt; &gt; at a time while i ghost off.  the 'servers' are actual a router or two, dial
&gt; &gt; up servers etc with heaps of disc space on the drive so there's room to tar.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; if you have two drives in them, you can mirror the drives using
&gt; software RAID 1, and then, after much messing about and so on, you can
&gt; actually have it so that you can remove one drive, put it in another
&gt; machine, and run it as a single drive machine (well, running a
&gt; degraded RAID 1 mirror), or rebuild a RAID from it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I made a directory called /t and from inside the directory did a:
&gt; &gt; tar czfv all.tgz /* --exclude /t
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; this seems to work nicely.  but, to get this restored, do i plug in the
&gt; &gt; Redhat CD and make the partition using fdisk or something and then tar from
&gt; &gt; a CD image or something.  I might add that this drive only has the root
&gt; &gt; partition on the drive to keep things simple.  i know that if the drive
&gt; &gt; fills it will crash, but the drive is pretty big and i keep an eye on it to
&gt; &gt; make sure it won't happen (not to mention having gigabytes of free space to
&gt; &gt; play with).
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, boot from something, use fdisk, then mkfs, then tar, then lilo,
&gt; then test, then fix whatever didn't work, rinse and repeat. ;)
&gt; 
&gt; rr
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; any ideas people?
&gt; &gt; thanks

&gt; &gt; I tried Norton Ghost about this time last year and had some problems
&gt; &gt; with Linux disk copying.
&gt; &gt; From memory, my problem was that whilst the partition data was copied
&gt; &gt; ok, the boot sectors for ext2 partitions weren't. (I confirmed this at
&gt; &gt; the time by viewing the actual bytes stored on each disk).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I ended up using the dd command exactly as you suggest and that worked
&gt; &gt; infallibly, many times over.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Try dd.  The basic command would be something like this

&gt; &gt; &gt; dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc

&gt; &gt; &gt; Be careful, though :-)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Alternativaly, hard disk duplication is made very easy with products like
&gt; &gt; &gt; Norton Ghost.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It understands FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ext2, etc and can duplicate partitions
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; resize automatically.  The latest version can also transfer images or
&gt; &gt; &gt; duplicate hard drives over LPT, USB (require host-to-host cable) or TCP/IP
&gt; &gt; &gt; (requires NDIS or packet driver) and supports some CD-Burners.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is run by booting from floppy (PC or MSDOS).  It has a nice GUI but
&gt; &gt; also
&gt; &gt; &gt; a very powerful command line interface.
