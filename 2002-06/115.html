&gt; &gt;By this, I specifically don't mean feats of software engineering -- 
&gt; &gt;gcc, Linux, etc, are not really "innovations" per se, but merely 
&gt; &gt;implementations of fairly well-understood concepts, algorithms and 
&gt; &gt;functionality. Good implementations, perhaps better than others, and 
&gt; &gt;perhaps more complete and standards-compliant, but still just 
&gt; &gt;implementations.
&gt; 
&gt; Name some innovations by commercial sources that aren't based 
&gt; on well-understood concepts, algorithms and functionality. 
&gt; One could say that the GUI was a logical progression of 
&gt; Graphical displays, and that the mouse (arguably what makes a 
&gt; GUI useful) was developed more than 10 years previous.

Logical progression /= implementation

=&gt; GUI is an innovation
=&gt; Mac GUI is not

&gt; 
&gt; btw, your filters didn't give a time limit, nor did they 
&gt; actually specify feats of software engineering. One could 
&gt; claim just about anything built before 1790 when the USPTO opened. :)

Heh, true ... I guess I'm thinking specifically in terms of computing
hardware and software, which really limits it to the last 50 years or
so...

&gt; 
&gt; For innovative open-source-style projects, how about;
&gt; 
&gt; fidonet

Not real familiar with that personally -- but on a cursory examination
it looks quite cool. Was it really new at the time, or was there
equivalent functionality available commercially?

&gt; tux/khttpd kernel module web server

In-kernel HTTP server... doesn't strike me as particularly exciting, but
I suppose it is... Though really, HTTP servers are the innovation
here...

&gt; reiserfs

True, though it appears to be DARPA funded, and presently, AFAIK, it's
just another Journalling File System... :)

&gt; qmail - innovative when you look at what else was available 
&gt; at the time 

Still, isn't it just a well-engineered mail server? I've never used
qmail, so don't know what is special about it...

&gt; round-robin patch for bind

Wouldn't this have appeared in the RFC first?

&gt; 
&gt; It's out there, I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find more 
&gt; like the above .. but it's the type of innovation we take for 
&gt; granted because no-one funded a marketing campaign to tell us 
&gt; it was innovative :)

Yeah -- I suppose I'm particularly interested in ferretting out stuff
that is actually innovative, so we can use it to tell other people it's
innovative... 

Cheers
