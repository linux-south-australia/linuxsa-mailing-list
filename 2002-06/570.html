*We* all know, the internet is a hostile place, but perhaps countless
other Australians don't understand that.  Call them naive; call them
innocent; either way, the Government seems to be trying to help.
If *my* father were about to send his credit card details over the web
I'd certainly be pleased if someone trustworthy and knowledgeable was
there to look over his shoulder and warn him before he dealt with shonks.

The plan may be flawed -- they called it ping, after all -- and the
Government is all-too-often untrustworthy, let alone lacking in knowledge,
but it does sound like a good idea in principle.  I'd say it's a geniuine
attempt at pro bono publico.

Mind you, there is something I recall about the road to hell...
