&gt; &gt; no matter whether you agree or disagree with him, i dont think anyone could

&gt; &gt; but oh well, perfection in heroes is a ridiculous concept.
&gt; 
&gt; It's not his passion that I would debate, but his integrity.  The man
&gt; openly called for people to steal intellectual property ("It's our duty
&gt; to create open source replacements for proprietary software.")  He cares
&gt; not what it cost the inventor to create that intellectual property in
&gt; the first place.  How hard it is to think a truly unique idea; how easy
&gt; to copy it.  Take away the financial reward and more often than not you
&gt; also take away the incentive to research.

DavidN seems to take a consistently one-eyed view on these matters.

How does open source programmers creating an open source replacement for 
Excel or Word differ differ, with respect to Davids complaint, in any 
meaningful way from Microsoft creating a proprietary replacement for 123 
or for Wordperfect?

While inventors or producers of copyrightable material should have some 
rights with respect to the products of their intellect, it should be 
remembered that we as consumers have rights as well.

Furthermore, patents, copyright, trademark, etc, were all created to allow 
progress. If they no longer serve their purpose, and there is very clear 
evidence that large established companies use their patent portfolios to 
stiffle competition, which prevents innovation, then perhaps it is time to 
rethink the whole area.
