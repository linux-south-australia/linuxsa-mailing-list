A little more info is at <A HREF="http://www.minfsr.treasury.gov.au/content/speeches/2001/003.asp">http://www.minfsr.treasury.gov.au/content/speeches/2001/003.asp</A> 

It seems to be something to do with consumer protection - letting you know when you go to a dodgy site, or notifying you of product recalls.

The speech was made in April last year, and boasts it will be available "later this year". Hmm, seemed to have slipped a bit.

-----

"...It is called Ping and I believe it is the next evolutionary step in providing information to consumers. 

Later this year, consumers will be able to freely download a copy of this software to install on their computer. Once installed, the software will work to detect when a consumer may encounter certain risky situations while browsing the Internet. 

It will be able to detect these situations and deliver relevant information to them on their desktop while they browse. 

Firstly, Ping will sit as an icon at the bottom of the screen. As soon as a consumer starts using the Internet, Ping starts monitoring their browsing to detect whether they may be accessing Web pages where Ping can offer useful advice. 

If it finds information, it flashes to let the consumer know that it has something related to what they are looking at. The consumer can choose to ignore the flash and continue browsing - Ping doesn't interrupt or slow down a consumer's browsing - but if they decide to click, a customisable window pops up like so. 

Within the top Ping window, the consumer can read a number of tips related to the type of purchase they are making, while the bottom Ping window displays topical information that will be provided from consumer regulators, the ACCC and ASIC. 

For instance, this may include information about a current recall or a prevalent scam. 

The information contained in the two Ping windows will also contain links to relevant Web sites where consumers can research more about the chosen topic. 

Consumers can also ask Ping for certain advice at any time. A click of the top icon reveals a list of category headings that can be tapped by the consumer. 

What Ping will be - is a world first. 

..."


Yeah right - vapour ware is not a world first.
