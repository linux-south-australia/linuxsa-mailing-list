&gt; I don't think that unmotivated innovation is part of human nature. We're
&gt; driven by needs, and in our society things like time and money are on
&gt; top of the wishlist. When that's considered, there's no surprise that
&gt; business or funding is somewhere behind most innovations.

Perl and rsync seem be two innocations to come to mind. Although they 
were both funded one way or the other.

Perl's innovation could be seen more as a manifestation of the attitude 
surrounding it and the way other tools and concepts were brought 
together. Or it could be seen as a hack that turned out to be useful and 
just grew.
