Hello all,

I have a problem with a hard drive and would welcome suggestions on
effective ways of navigating it.

Boot Drive (hosts windows and lilo): WD 800 Meg
Problem Drive (hosts Mandrake linux): IBM Deskstar 30GB

Some background.  Having found that my system froze (Mandrake 8.2), I
rebooted only to find that I could no longer access my linux system.  So I
took out my Mandrake (8.2) disks and commenced a reinstall.  No problem in
getting to the "Format Partitions" window (designating /, /bu, /home
partitions) however after hitting "Done" on that window, and then confirming
my wish to format only the / partition, the drive just began cycling.

The pattern of the cycle, which repeats 10 times, is: "ch", "ch", "ch", "ch"
then a pause.  

After the 10th cycle series, I get an error message: "An error occurred
fsck failed with exit code 4 or signal 0".

Can anyone confirm whether the above message and symptoms indicate the drive
is stuffed  and whether it's likely to be repairable ?

I believe this does not look good for the IBM.  But the drive doesn't seem
to be completely stuffed because if I boot into windows from LILO on the
other drive, I can see and access data from the windows partitions on my
apparantly-stuffed IBM drive.  Of course I can't see or access my linux
data; linux partitions appear collectively only as "D".

How to get my data off ?  I was thinking that perhaps I could purchase
another harddrive, make that new drive the master  and the existing
"stuffed" IBM drive the slave, install linux on the master and then take off
the data from the IBM.  The hope of this approach would be that the existing
linux partitions on the IBM drive will become visible from another linux
system, in the same way as the windows partitions were visible from a
windows partition. 

So my question is: Can anyone confirm whether this approach will infact make
my existing linux partitions visible and accessible so I can save the data ?

Cheers,

Andrew Lord
