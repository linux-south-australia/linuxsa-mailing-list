Hello,

Sorry I dont have any questions, I had to answer them all to get this far ;)

But anyway, just a test message from my nice new Compaq Presario 700. In my 
opinion, compaq have done pretty well. The presario looks very sexy and 
nearly everything works fine[1]. 

For those interested...
OS: Mandrake 8.2 Kernel 2.4.18-6mdk. Onboard modem is a Conexant, which 
worked fine after downloading a driver (from <A HREF="http://www.mbsi.ca/cnxtlindrv/">http://www.mbsi.ca/cnxtlindrv/</A> - 
source and rpms for RedHat,Mandrake,SuSE) so cheers Compaq for using 
linmodems! Onboard LAN Card works fine, but I expected that from Realtek. Oh 
yeah, my CF Card works fine too (turns out to be a PQI Flash Disk) mandrake 
suggested ext3 as a file system, no problems so far. Still looking into 
getting the s-video output to work, but hey this monitor is bigger than my 
desktop computer so I'm happy enough! If anyone wants more info about this 
model I may be able to help. I plan to try FreeBSD on it when I feel a little 
braver.

I didn't see anything in the EULA for XP in regards to getting a refund for 
the software I deleted. Can anyone show me otherwise? (please)

Not that it matters, it's rented for now anyway. 
Weird that, unemployed people are rejected from AGC, AVCO, GE whatever, but 
RadioRentals are cool to let me go home with $3000 worth of computer. It cost 
me more and I don't own it, but what do I care, aftert all it's their own tax 
money paying for it. 

anyway, see ya.

[1] irda doesn't work, but i don't have any irda devices, so I lose no sleep.

jay
