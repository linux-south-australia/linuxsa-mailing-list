&gt; You seem to have missed the point, which was not one company writing a
&gt; similar product to another's, rather it was that Stallman incites people
&gt; to steal intellectual property.

No, you seem to be have an odd notion of "theft", if nothing else. 
Stallman isn't saying that people need to write free replacements which 
work via the exactly same process, nor is he encouraging people to 
illegally copy source code or algorithms.

He *is* saying people should write free replacements for non-free 
software, replacements which perform the same tasks as the non-free 
counterpart. Compare Adobe's Photoshop to the GIMP. They do the same 
thing, but via a completely different process, and absolutely no IP has 
been infringed. This is what Stallman is talking about.

&gt; Stallman would have that Sharpe could charge *just one* client for the
 &gt; work, after which he would give it freely away.

No. Stallman would prefer that Sharpe lincense the source code under 
what he considers to be a free (as in "libre") license, such as the GPL. 
The GPL places no requirements on how someone distributes (read: 
"sells") the program, neither does RMS.

&gt; Stallman would have it that we, the programming community,
&gt; would have a duty to write an open source replacement for Sharpe's team's
&gt; hard-won algorithms.

Where is the problem with that? If someone writes some software that 
does the exact same thing, but in an entirely different manner, then 
what's the problem? Again, think Photoshop vs. the GIMP here.

&gt; For those amongst us who are hung up on property,
&gt; but unable to see the intellectual part (he he), that is the sort of
&gt; theft that I despise.

Could I suggest you're so hung up on the property, that you're unable to 
see the intellectual part?

&gt; No, Richard, not to *allow* progress, but to *encourage* it.
&gt; 

But now they are *impeding* progress.
