Hi David,

I'm afraid that the issue is deeper than that.  JWZ and RMS have a mutual
dislike due to the their radically differing personal styles and the
tension that developed between FSF and Lucid over the development of a
graphical Emacs and the flakiness of GCC.  RMS is by no means blameless in
that affair.

Probably the best reference to the whole debacle is Richard Gabriel's book
"Patterns of Software".

&gt; Furthermore, people have a tendency to focus on the method of the
&gt; content delivery rather than the actual content... People don't like
&gt; tall poppies and they do cut them down when they can.

Oh please.  Stallman visited Adelaide Uni to promote the FSF and GNU
system.  He smelt.  He fondled his genitals during his presentation.  His
answers to questions were curt to the point of being rude.  His attitude
was one of 'genius excuses all', even in the presence of people of greater
genius and greater efforts for the general good than his.

People must have been regarding the content rather than the presentation,
otherwise he would have found himself before a magistrate (masturbation in
a public place is a crime) or at the very least booed by the more feminist
staff as he left the lecture.

Regards,
Glen
