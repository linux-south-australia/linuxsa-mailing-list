The South Australian chapter of the Australian Unix User Group (AUUG)
formally invites you to attend thier monthly meeting. Details are as
follows:

DATE  : 12th June 2002
TIME  : 7pm Onwards
VENUE : IBM Corporate Division Boardroom
        180 Greenhill Road
        PARKSIDE
AGENDA:

* 1. SA Chapter Commitee Elections Nominations

Its now been over a year since the SA-AUUG chapter has been 
re-established, hence its time for the yearly commitee elections. Please 
feel free to nominate any AUUG member whether a full or student member. 
The election procedure will take place at the July meeting so you've 
only got a limited time to nominate. Nominations can be done at the 
meeting or via an email to the returning officer. A description of the 
various positions can be found at: 
<A HREF="http://www.sa.auug.org.au/election/positions.html">http://www.sa.auug.org.au/election/positions.html</A> 
and Greg Lehey has accepted the position of returning officer.

As with any election, in order for a nomination to be successful there 
must also be a seconder. So if you want to nominate someone for a 
position but can't find a seconder, send an email to 
and another auug member might just second your nomination. 
     
* 2. Wayne Piekarski will be talking about:
     Tinmith: An Outdoor Augmented Reality Visualisation Sytem

Wayne Piekarski, joint creator of the ARQuake game, will be talking about
his unix based Augmented reality visualisation system. The Tinmith 
system is designed to support research into outdoor augmented reality. 
Wayne will discuss the newly developed, easy to use, user interface 
techniques in 3D environments; where keyboards and mice cannot be used. 
Tinmith is a complex application allowing users to interact with the real
world from within the virtual world generated by a computer.
More details can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.tinmith.net">http://www.tinmith.net</A>

* 3. Questions Session

Got an unanswered computing question? Then ask it in the auug-sa 
questions session. Anything from unix to windows, programming to 
hardware. With the expertise of many computer enthusiests, your sure to 
get it answered.


* At the conclusion of the meeting many members of the group continue to 
talk as they wine and dine at one of the fine local restaurant 
establishments to which all are invited.
