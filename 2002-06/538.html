&gt;It would be interesting to have documentation on how much time 
&gt;and effort organizations spend on getting MS products to work properly. 

ROFL, from supporting (primarily) M$ shops for the last 5 years or 
so I can say that I don't normally have --time-- to document how 
much time we spend getting it to work properly because we spend too
much --time-- getting it to work properly.  (almost a circular reference
there ;)

Having said that I agree totally, but 9 times out of 10 there's only 
anecdotal or intangible evidence to prove it.  Most ppl who support MS
would agree that they spend too much time fixing things instead of using 
their time to improve their systems/processes etc.

Also I would have to admit that moving from Win9x to Win2000 as our SOE
has proven to be worth most of the grief it caused at the time, while it
still has its faults and annoyance theyre nowhere near the extent of Win9x.
Combine that with Samba on most of our PDCs and we now have more time to
spend improving things, and at least Linux gives us the chance to do that
at no more than the cost of some time and little bit of effort........
