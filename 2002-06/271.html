An oldie but a goodie...

An unemployed man goes to Microsoft to apply for a job as a cleaner. 
The manager there arranges for an aptitude test (Section: Floors, sweeping).

After the test, the manager says: "You will be appointed at $30 a day.
Please let me have your e-mail address so that I can send you a form to
complete and advise you where to report for work on your first day". Taken
aback, the unemployed man protests that he is neither in possession of a
computer nor an e-mail address. To this the Microsoft manager replies: 
"Well, then, that really means you virtually don't exist and can therefore
hardly expect to be employed".

Stunned the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having only about $10
to his name, he buys a 10kg box of tomatoes. Within less than 2 hours, he
sells the tomatoes and makes 100% profit. Repeating the process several
times that day, he ends up with almost $100 for the day. And thus it dawns
on the man that he can make a living selling tomatoes.

Getting up earlier and earlier every day and going to bed later and 
later, he quickly multiplies his profits. Not too long thereafter, he
acquires a cart to transport several dozen boxes of tomatoes, only to have
to trade it in shortly afterwards for a pickup truck. By the end of the
first year, he is the owner of fleet of pickup trucks and manages a staff of
several hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes.

Considering the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some life
assurance. Calling an insurance advisor, he picks an insurance plan to fit
his new circumstances. At the end of the telephone conversation, the advisor
asks him for his e-mail address so he can forward the documentation. When
the man replies that he has no e-mail, the advisor is stunned: "What, you
don't  even have e-mail? How on earth have you managed to amass such wealth
without the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce. Just imagine where you would
have been by now if you had been connected from the start!"

After a moment's silence, the tomato millionaire replies: "Sure, I 
would have been a cleaner at Microsoft."

MORAL OF THE STORY:
If you received this by e-mail, you are probably closer to becoming a
cleaner at Microsoft than you are to becoming a millionaire! OR
If you do have a computer and e-mail, you're already being taken to the
cleaners by Microsoft
