&gt;Thanks for your advice, but unfortunately it didn't make my 
&gt;situation any
&gt;better.  The XP patch you spoke about below I had already 
&gt;applied (see my
&gt;earlier email).

I set up an XP Pro workstation last week, the first one I've had to deal
with
on a Samba PDC.  The Samba box is running RH7.3 with Samba 2.2.4.  It was
running Samba 2.2.1a and has mostly Win98 workstations at present.

I ran into exactly the same problem as you, and found that the registry
patch
included with Samba source didn't help a whole lot.  The reason behind this
is that
it only looks at the LOCAL_MACHINE key and not the other keys. Search for
"RequireSignOrSeal"
and set the value for all of them  (i found 2 or 3 different ones if I
remember rightly).

Worked fine after this.  I still have an issue with enumerating Domain Users
for local
machine security (this used to work with v2.2.1a) ie: putting Domain Users
in the Power
Users group to give users extra rights to files/devices etc.

I've since rolled back several upgraded PDCs to 2.2.1a until I find a fix
for this, its
one of those annoying issues that keeps breaking in the Samba source....

(I don't have access to the PDC at the moment so I can't send you my
smb.conf, pretty similar
to yours, if you've had other versions of Windows logging into it then don't
change it, as 
the problem lies with XP)
