Buy new HDs for the OS, install on those.  
HD's cheap and it gives you an instant backout proceedure.
I like to reinstall if I can as it means I know where it's upto, also it 
allows you to ensure YOU know how your machine is actually configured and 
what makes it tick.  Optional: Document what you did so that the next guy 
can fix it.

&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; Just wondering if anyone has attempted an upgrade from Redhat 6.2
&gt; all the way to 7.3.  I'm toying around with the idea, but am loathe
&gt; to try it as its a production box and I'd rather do a fresh install
&gt; and leave the data partitions as is to avoid the hassle if there is
&gt; any.  However if any of you have successfully upgraded as opposed to
&gt; reinstalling, I'd like to know.
&gt; 
&gt; The only major changes I've made to the box from the original install (as
&gt; far as "original" rpms are concerned) have been to the kernel (now 2.4.18,
&gt; installed 
&gt; from source, not rpm), samba (2.2.5, also from source), and also 
&gt; installation of the extended attributes & acl packages.
&gt; 
&gt; The box also has Arcserve installed, I'm not overly concerned if this
&gt; breaks as its a simple process to reinstall if necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, hit me with any potential hassles and help me decide whether to
&gt; just kill it & do a fresh install of 7.3 or leave it as is, or upgrade
&gt; it, I've almost convinced myself that a fresh install is the way to go....
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt;
