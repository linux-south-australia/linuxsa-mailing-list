Using Linux of course, so as not to be off-topic :-) In fact I think this
is a general topic of interest to computerheads because we're always
buying and selling bits and pieces.

I'm selling some (Linux-related, &lt;whew&gt;) gear online, and though I've
always resisted it in the past some people really want to pay me
personally by credit card. I've never used Paypal, but I notice that
besides a substantial delay in retrieving funds there seem to be a lot of
people on the net claiming that Paypal have ripped them off to the tune of
many thousands or that their funds were held for many months.

So I went looking for alternatives. The most relevant Australian one I
found has a very humourous front page
(<A HREF="http://www.standardtransactions.com.au">http://www.standardtransactions.com.au</A> ) so I quickly skipped that one,
and I arrived at Billpoint (ebay's own, but capped at AUD1000 maximum
transaction for ordinary accounts, which is too low) and Yahoo Paydirect
(<A HREF="http://paydirect.yahoo.com">http://paydirect.yahoo.com</A>) which seems a bit light on details about
fees. There's a promising-sounding one run by a real bank (Citibank in the
US) instead of these dotcom pretend-to-be-banks, but unfortunately its
site <A HREF="http://www.c2it.com">http://www.c2it.com</A> is down. So far the best I can come up with is to
take the credit card details to someone who already has a merchant
agreement with a bank (eg a shopkeeper) and ask them to put it through for
a small fee (if that's not proscribed by their contract with the bank.)

Can anyone point me to a better service than those listed above?

Thanks,
