I was just saying what the signal amp does, the useful bit is just the
amp getting the signal back in the normal range. It gets too weak for
the receive curcits in things, and thus out of tollerance.

&gt; &gt; Nah, Im in hills area, and I need a masthead amp. The signal strength is
&gt; &gt; so bad I get about 95% snow, with a stuffed b&w picture trying to get

&gt; &gt; amp). It amps up the signal, and filters the non-tv frequenceys, and the
&gt; &gt; picture improves to somewhere between good and passable. It does also
&gt; &gt; amp any interfearance unfortunatly, but theres nothing you can do about
&gt; &gt; that - at least the signal gets back up to the usable range. Now when
&gt; &gt; will the satellite providers put 9 & 10 on a digital sat link? I get
&gt; &gt; abc, sbs, and 7 digitally from sat (mmm.. now they look perfect, and I
&gt; &gt; get them 30 mins ahead of time, if I miss something and want to take
&gt; &gt; another look ;)

&gt; Hmm, but that would imply that your television/vcr/linux-tv-card doesn't use
&gt; any filtering itself. Surely thats not the case?
&gt; 
&gt; I thought the snow you get was genuine noise on the same frequencies as the
&gt; tv channels are upon, and thats why i didn't think amplification was a
&gt; useful tool unless your signal loss/interference occured inbetween the
&gt; antenna and your receivers.
&gt; 
&gt; But i haven't got any real experience in this area so i could be totally
&gt; wrong. I'm interested to know the logic behind the wrongness though.
