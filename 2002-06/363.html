&gt; Hi folks,

Hi

&gt; 
&gt; I've got a problem with a machine I was trying to setup Samba 
&gt; on. It's using RH7.1 and I'm trying to configure samba but 
&gt; the inetd.conf file is missing. I've used older versons of RH 
&gt; before so I'm assuming that this file has been either renamed 
&gt; or is obsolete. As I understand it, inetd is needed for 
&gt; Internet access but the machine already is a proxy server and 
&gt; accesses the net fine. Any thoughts?

Inetd is the mother of most daemons. XInetd is the newer replacement
that many distros (including RedHat 7.x, I think) use now. It does the
same thing, but is (apparrently) "new and improved".

By "mother of most daemons", I mean that in many cases, inetd (or
xinetd) is the daemon that runs, binds to a specific port (eg 80), and
listens for requests, and the spawns the relevant daemon (eg httpd) to
handle that request as needed. The other option is to have the daemon
running all the time and bind to the port itself. This is called
"standalone". Your proxy server is probably standalone (if it's not, it
would be awfully slow), so has nothing to do with inetd. Usually, people
run Samba standalone also -- though not always. (the choice depends on
usage -- would you rather the overhead of having the relevant daemon
running all the time and have faster response to requests, or have the
delay of starting the daemon for each request, but not have it running
all the time?)

To see a clearer picture of what I mean here, run "netstat -ap
--inet|grep LISTEN|less" as root (of course, check the man page of
netstat first to understand what you are doing, and to make sure that I
am not evil and am trying to fry your system). This will tell you which
ports (tcp & udp) and IP addresses are being listened to on your system,
and what program (and the PID of that program) is doing the listening...

educational :)
