Hello all,

I'd be most grateful for some help on the following problem.

Just wondering if somebody can advise me about how to mount the partitions
of a slave drive on my operational linux system.  ie what specific changes,
need to be made to which particular files (MTAB & FSTAB are shown below)?

&lt;BACKGROUND&gt;

Drive A (Master) 0.8 GB has LILO boot-loader and WindoZe.
Drive B (Slave in a Master-slave pairing), 30 GB hosts linux Mandrake 8.2.
Drive B has both Linux-Native and FAT32 partitions.

Problem:

I can now no longer boot into Linux (on Drive B) nor re-install Linux on
drive B (drive just cycles at either attempt).  However, I can boot into
WinDoze on Drive A, and still see the FAT 32 partitions on drive B.  Linux
partitions are invisible under Windoze but I need to rescue my linux data
from the linux partitions (/, /home, /backup).  So I thought that if I could
somehow boot into linux on another drive and mount the linux partitions on
the Drive B from Drive A, then I'd be able to transfer my linux data to the
good drive.  


Attempt:

I have now purchased another hard drive and have installed this in place of
Drive A (Master-only with slave disconnected and jumper-pins repositioned).

Install of Mandrake on Drive A  went according to expectations.  Disk
partitioning is 
/
swap
/home
/backup
/Fat32 partition
/BeOS partition

Drive B partitioning is

ext2
linux-swap
ext2
ext2
ext2
FAT32
FAT32
FAT32
FAT32
FAT32

Ithen reconnected Drive B (and adjusted jumper-pins) to make it slave and
Drive A'd jumper pins to make it Master-with-slave) and booted up.

&lt;/BACKGROUND&gt;

Because Drive B has been connected after the installation of Linux on Drive
A as a Master-only setup, none of the partitions present on drive B have
been mounted.  

So which files need to be changed and what are the specific changes that
need to be made ?

I am guessing that two files which require changes are "mtab" and "ftab"
(are there more ?).  Then content of mine is:

/etc/mtab

/dev/hda1 / ext2 rw 0 0
none /proc proc rw 0 0
none /dev devfs rw 0 0
/dev/hda7 /backup ext2 rw 0 0
none /dev/pts devpts rw,mode=0620 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
/dev/hda6 /home ext2 rw 0 0
/mnt/cdrom /mnt/cdrom supermount
ro,dev=/dev/hdc,fs=iso9660,--,iocharset=iso8859-1 0 0
/mnt/cdrom2 /mnt/cdrom2 supermount
ro,dev=/dev/scd0,fs=iso9660,--,iocharset=iso8859-1 0 0
/mnt/floppy /mnt/floppy supermount
rw,sync,dev=/dev/fd0,fs=vfat,--,iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
/dev/hda8 /mnt/windows vfat rw,iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs rw,devmode=0664,devgid=43 0 0

/etc/fstab

/dev/hda1 / ext2 defaults 1 1
/dev/hda7 /backup ext2 defaults 1 2
none /dev/pts devpts mode=0620 0 0
none /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0
/dev/hda6 /home ext2 defaults 1 2
/mnt/cdrom /mnt/cdrom supermount
dev=/dev/hdc,fs=iso9660,ro,--,iocharset=iso8859-1 0 0
/mnt/cdrom2 /mnt/cdrom2 supermount
dev=/dev/scd0,fs=iso9660,ro,--,iocharset=iso8859-1 0 0
/mnt/floppy /mnt/floppy supermount
dev=/dev/fd0,fs=vfat,--,iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,sync,codepage=850 0 0
/dev/hda8 /mnt/windows vfat iocharset=iso8859-1,umask=0,codepage=850 0 0
none /proc proc defaults 0 0
/dev/hda5 swap swap defaults 0 0


TIA

PS.  I have also attempted to install Linux on Drive A, with Drive B in
place (ie Master-slave configuration).  As usual I got to the partitioning
stage of Mandrake 8.2 install, and was able to designate and name all
partitions on both drive A & drive B.  Then after partitioning, drive B did
its usual cycling thing [(ch ch, ch, ch ...pause.....) x 10] even though I
designated the 'offending' partition as "empty". The install then crashed
out as it has done previously.
