Hi all,

What is people's opinion on good, commonly available VGA cards
appropriate for use in servers -- machines where X might get used a
little bit, but pretty rarely, and hence, video performance is simply
not an issue. 3D is obviously useless, as is large amounts of RAM. What
is important is compatibility -- I want it to be supported on anything,
whether it's the latest installer CD, a five year old distro, last years
LinuxCare BBC, Solaris x86, a BSD, or whatever. It also wants to be
cheap, not create much heat (or noise, not that that often matters), and
provide a decent, sharp 1024x768x8bit image on any monitor capable of
that.

Somehow, I always seem to end up with budget nVidia models, like the
TNT2 M64, or something like that, and, while they do work, they often
require messing about with X configs somewhat, when you really can't be
bothered. Even then, you're always left wondering if you should be using
the nv drivers or something. It's just more thinking than you need when
you're setting up a server (who wants to think about X when you're doing
server setup -- there's enough other things to be thinking about). I
recall a while back, before the 3d proliferation, that the safe choice
was something like a Tseng labs, or one of the early Diamond or S3
cards... 

Nowadays, I look at what's available, and nothing seems like a sensible
"default". Maybe it's just that I haven't really been following video
cards much since before 3D (I lost interest not long after 3D started),
but I'd really like to be able to buy something like a Tseng ET6000 for
$20 new to put in servers :) ... of course, they aren't supported by XP
these days, so who would sell them? :P
