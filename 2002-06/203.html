&gt;&gt; But that's not what you're getting.  Looking at what arrived here:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; X-Spam-Status: No, hits=-98.0 required=5.0 tests=NO_REAL_NAME,MAILTO_LINK,A_FROM_IN_AUTO_WLIST version=2.01
&gt;
&gt; What's this X-Spam-Status header?

It comes from spamassassin.  I'm not quite sure how it calculates, but
by default you need at least 5.0 hits to be classified as spam.  You
apparently start with -100, which makes no sense to me, but it's
pretty easy to get down to 0.  Here's a better example (real spam):
