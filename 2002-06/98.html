Something like Redhat/Mandrake is great for getting into Linux if you want
to learn it;  once you're comfortable with your box, then Debian or
Slackware are great distro's to really get your hands dirty, and they give
you far more control over everything that¹s on your box.  Each distro
appeals to one person more then another, so its more of a case of
try-and-learn, really.

If you just want a linux gateway up and going, checkout a web based linux
distro such as smoothwall.  It'll be very easy to setup, but it won't teach
you much about linux.

I've always found the best way for novices to learn Linux is to have a guru
friend install a distro for them, that¹s reasonably easy to use, and start
teaching them bit by bit until they're confident enough to go prawling
around their system by theirself.

On 3/6/02 10:35 PM, "Phil Tann" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:primal@adam.com.au">primal@adam.com.au</A>&gt; spoke these words:

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; Are there any other Linux mailing lists around that I can subscribe to?  Just
&gt; from reading the MANY emails bouncing back and forth between all of you I have
&gt; learnt a lot, but now I have a little more time on my hands I'm looking at
&gt; actually getting my butt into gear and getting my gateway going.  So any other
&gt; lists people are aware of I'd probably have a look at those too.
&gt; 
&gt; Any input is welcome as far as the gateway goes!
&gt; 
&gt; ie.
&gt; which version of Linux to run,
&gt; considering the machine is a Pentium 120 with a whole 16 meg of ram and a 4
&gt; gig hdd.
&gt; 
&gt; recommendations as to settings etc.
&gt; I freely admit I am a complete novice as far as Linux goes, so please explain
&gt; things in words of 1 sylable! :)
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks all
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; Phil Tann
