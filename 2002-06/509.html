what I meant was what you are saying that when something is GPLed then
it stops someone taking the work of others and modifying it without
contributing back to the people who did the real work (ie Apple and the
darwin kernel for Mac OSX) yes I agree that GPL is not Public domain but
in a sense the software that is developed under it is public software
(the original writer can at anytime change the licensing agreement ie
Tux Racer) but there may be other people involved which could complicate
this.

&gt; [snip]
&gt; &gt; benefits of open source software over Software Piracy
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; there is a guilt free and in expensive alternative to Pirating software
&gt; &gt; that is both mature and stable, there is now an open source alternative
&gt; &gt; to any situation that exists. the GPL puts software in to the public
&gt; &gt; domain and seeing that you are part of the public it is in your domain
&gt; &gt; and you are entitled to do any thing you want with it, you have good
&gt; &gt; access to the software titles (only an email away to th local LUG).  
&gt; 
&gt; GPL'd software is not in the public domain.  You cannot do with it what you 
&gt; want.  It is copyrighted software which you are freely allowed to use, modify 
&gt; and redistribute as long as you make the source available.
&gt; 
&gt; With a public domain piece of software you can put your own name on it, make 
&gt; changes, close off the source and sell it as proprietry.  The GPL is intended 
&gt; to stop this sort of anti-sharing.
