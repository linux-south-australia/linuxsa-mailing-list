I just discovered a rude trick that windows XP can play when you install
it. Its no secret that windows is particulary intollerant to almost any
partitioning other than "windows gets primary partition #1, and thats
about it".

I had my disk partitioned like so:

Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 2491 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1       261   2096451    6  FAT16
/dev/hda2          1437      2491   8474287+   f  Win95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/hda3           262      1409   9221310   83  Linux
/dev/hda4          1410      1436    216877+  82  Linux swap
/dev/hda5          1437      2491   8474256    b  Win95 FAT32

Partition table entries are not in disk order

Ok, so they arn't in disk order, but who cares, whats the problem with
that? I wanted windows on hda1 (well, not so much wanted as needed). I
saved this list of my partitions, just incase. I tryed to install 95, 98
and NT, and they all complained about needing an MSDOS parition to
install, or gave error codes in HEX. I figured they were all being
intollerant to my partitioning. So, I tryed XP since its newer and
generally seems better written. Obviously they have implimented a kludge
to get around out of order disk partitions - and what is it? Just shift
them around until they are in disk order without telling you! yes! how
rude is that!!

After XP:

Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 2491 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1       261   2096112    6  FAT16
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(260, 243, 47) should be (260, 254, 63)
/dev/hda2           262      1409   9221310   83  Linux
/dev/hda3          1410      1436    216877+  82  Linux swap
/dev/hda4          1437      2491   8474287+   f  Win95 Ext'd (LBA)
/dev/hda5          1437      2491   8474256    b  Win95 FAT32

It took me a minute to work out what had happened, and I had to patch my
grub config, and fstab to get everything running OK again. Swapping your
partitions around is just plain evil!

Severaly pissed off at xp,
Ant
