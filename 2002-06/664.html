/.'s interview of Ransom Love
&lt;<A HREF="http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid">http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid</A>=02/06/24/1556244&mode=nested&tid=163&gt;
is interesting, have a read if you're inclined.

Ahh, okay. Businesses *will* care about that, yes. If the Oracles of the
world can certify their software against RedHat and UL, and as a result
have it run on a number of different distros, then that will be a good
thing for the distros, the ISV, and the corporate end user using RH or
UL. It could potentially be a bad thing for other users of other Linux
distros, but these people already have a hard time for exactly the same
reason.

I guess its looking like UL is a win for businesses which use or develop
for Linux, but is more or less a moot point for others involved with Linux.

 &gt; Ah, but the market they are going after is _not_ free software
 &gt; advocates, it's corporates.

I wonder how much of an influence the free software advocates have on 
the corporate market, however. I can't see the majority of corporates 
just springing for a Linux solution without some sort of grass-roots 
movement already present within the organisation, and I suspect that the 
people who care about Linux enough to evangelise are already going to be 
quite familar with it. They will more likely than not reccommend their 
distro of choice. Given that UL isn't offering any freely downloadble 
binaries, I doubt UL will be the distro of choice for many, and hence 
another distro will be able to get a foot in the door.

 &gt; UnitedLinux's challenge is to capture the corporate market for the
 &gt; money, and keep the free software types on-side (presumably by giving
 &gt; them an un-branded equivalent) for the development effort.

Hmm, given that there's no free binaries, and Caldera's (undeserved?) 
poor repuation, that could be a hard sell.
