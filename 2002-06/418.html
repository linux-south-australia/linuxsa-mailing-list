In the immortal words of <A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A> (Richard Russell)...
&gt; I have a problem with user accounting for a Squid proxy that I've
&gt; inherited. It presently authenticates against a Radiator (as in the
&gt; RADIUS server, not an electric heater) using proxy_auth.  I can't
&gt; figure out how to do user accounting for it. I have been lead to
&gt; believe that RADIUS can do accounting, but, while I have
&gt; AccLogFileName set, and Trace set to 5, nothing appears in the log
&gt; file -- in fact, fuser tells me that the file isn't even opened... 

Richard,

To the best of my knowledge, RADIUS can't do accounting for Squid, only
authentication.  The kind of accounting you need, you can only get from
the squid logs themselves.

&gt; So, I'm guessing I need to do accounting by using the Squid log. Would
&gt; this be correct? Has anyone managed to get RADIUS to do their
&gt; accounting in a similar situation? What tools do people use to do
&gt; accounting with squid?

This depends on how current you want your information.  I'm in the
middle of developing a similar system, but I'm dumping the logs into a
database and calculating usage on a per user basis.  There is also a
browser based control panel that I'm working on, to manage the whole
system.  

Unfortunately the system I'm working on is very much Alpha quality so it
may not be much use to you.


Cheers

Tim
