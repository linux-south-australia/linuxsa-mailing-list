&gt; I think it is positive news, what are your thoughts?

IMHO, it's a good thing.

Of all IT people, us non-MS types recognise that choice is very
important. However, to have meaningful choice, there needs to be some
sort of equality, and preferably compatibility between the choices.
Certainly, this move will equalise the playing field so (at least in
the US and Australia) RedHat isn't so dominant. This will work to
improve the breed. Hopefully, it won't mean that great distros like
Debian get left behind.

Personally, what I see happenning is the development of three main
strains of Linux (strains, breeds, flavours) -- RedHat/Mandrake, UL
(non-RedHat Commercial), and Debian (and other non-commercial). I'd
really like to see some sort of compatibility between these three
types, though I'd like to see them maintain their diversity.

Certainly, UL should make ISVs who make Linux versions of their
software realise that there's more than just RedHat out there, and the
choices of which other distros to support should become clearer (I
suspect the discussion presently goes something like this:

"We obviously have to support RedHat, but what about the others?"

   "Well, there's Mandrake, SuSE, Debian, Caldera, TurboLinux and
   Slackware, along with a raft of smaller players"

"So which is the most popular?"

   "er..."

"Can't we just make a sort of try-your-luck version for other
distros?"

   "I guess so."
