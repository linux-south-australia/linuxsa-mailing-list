&gt; To be honest, the only thing I can see UL adding is the brand name and 
&gt; (in the case of Caldera anyway) assurance for PHB's that they have 
&gt; someone to sue if something goes wrong. I assume you'll still have to 
&gt; pay extra for any useful support, and the GPL ensures that any 

butofcourse.

&gt; compatibility and stability improvements that go into existing software 
&gt; will be released upstream anyway. Perhaps they'll add some proprietry 

Well, I meant compatibility between the distros, and specifically, the
certification of that compatibility -- they want to assure ISVs will
only have to certify that their software against "UnitedLinux", and it
will be certified as compatible with any of the members... Presently,
ISVs would have to certify (or test or whatever) against each distro
separately.

And I meant stability in terms of business, not software. ISVs and
potential customers will (assumedly) see "UnitedLinux" as a stronger
and more reliable brand than any one of the members... It gives them
confidence that it's a strong distro, and they will not be left in the
lurch by a company going under. It's all marketing, but it's important
to PHBs.

&gt; stuff, but that will be avoided by free software advocates - who happen 
&gt; to be the majority of the Linux "market" - and which will doubtfully be 
&gt; important and/or different enough to capture anyone else's attention.

Ah, but the market they are going after is _not_ free software
advocates, it's corporates. Free software advocates aren't a very
profitable market. Corporates are. UnitedLinux's challenge (like
RedHat's) is to capture the corporate market for the money, and keep
the free software types on-side (presumably by giving them an
un-branded equivalent) for the development effort.

&gt; &gt; Of course, if I were me, which I am, I would rather have Debian.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ditto again, but the real question is, why the hell are you up at this 
&gt; time of the night doing documentation? 8)

Well, Jack Handley says it best:

As the light changed from red to green to yellow and back to red
again, I sat there thinking about life. Was it nothing more than a
bunch of honking and yelling? Sometimes it seemed that way.
