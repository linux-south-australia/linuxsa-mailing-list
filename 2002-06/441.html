FYI:

This is quite old now, but some time ago there was a query relating to 
notification mechanisms available for software RAID on a Linux system.

This software (mdadm):

<A HREF="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/RPM/">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/RPM/</A> (RPM versions)

has a "monitor mode" whereby it will poll the RAID status at an (user 
defined, default 60 sec) interval, and email someone if that status has 
changed since the last poll (which presumably would cover a failure).

It also allows a user-defined program to run at that time also, which could 
do any number of things, including sending an SNMP trap, or SMS'ing an 
administrator.

A disk in my RAID 1 array recently failed, and I had occassion to replace it 
(replaced both drives with bigger, faster ones), and in doing so I came 
across the "mdadm" software (which is actually a command line RAID management 
tool, not just a monitoring agent), and though it might interest some.

At around $150 nowdays for 40GB drive, I think software RAID is cheap 
insurance against the pain of disk failure, even on home machines. 

Also installed SPAMAssassin and MIMEdefang, but that is another story (short: 
installed as sendmail milter, checks all incoming mail, works like a charm. I 
know others here use it, but though I would add my 2c)
