&gt; DavidN seems to take a consistently one-eyed view on these matters.

Consistent, yes; but balanced.

&gt; How does open source programmers creating an open source replacement for 
&gt; Excel or Word differ differ, with respect to Davids complaint, in any 
&gt; meaningful way from Microsoft creating a proprietary replacement for 123 
&gt; or for Wordperfect?

You seem to have missed the point, which was not one company writing a
similar product to another's, rather it was that Stallman incites people
to steal intellectual property.  Suppose Sharpe were to employ a team
of twenty leading scientists who, after five, long years researching
artificial sentience, eventually came up with an algorithm for a truly
thinking computer.  Sharpe would presumably want to recover his costs --
something in the order of $20 million.  Stallman would have that Sharpe
could charge *just one* client for the work, after which he would give
it freely away.  Sharpe might prefer to licence it on a per-seat basis
at $1,000 per year (which would be a bargain for the users.)  In such
a situation, Stallman would have it that we, the programming community,
would have a duty to write an open source replacement for Sharpe's team's
hard-won algorithms.  For those amongst us who are hung up on property,
but unable to see the intellectual part (he he), that is the sort of
theft that I despise.

&gt; Furthermore, patents, copyright, trademark, etc, were all created to allow 
&gt; progress.

No, Richard, not to *allow* progress, but to *encourage* it.
