Hi all

Just wondering if anyone has attempted an upgrade from Redhat 6.2
all the way to 7.3.  I'm toying around with the idea, but am loathe
to try it as its a production box and I'd rather do a fresh install
and leave the data partitions as is to avoid the hassle if there is
any.  However if any of you have successfully upgraded as opposed to
reinstalling, I'd like to know.

The only major changes I've made to the box from the original install (as
far as "original" rpms are concerned) have been to the kernel (now 2.4.18,
installed 
from source, not rpm), samba (2.2.5, also from source), and also 
installation of the extended attributes & acl packages.

The box also has Arcserve installed, I'm not overly concerned if this
breaks as its a simple process to reinstall if necessary.

Anyway, hit me with any potential hassles and help me decide whether to
just kill it & do a fresh install of 7.3 or leave it as is, or upgrade
it, I've almost convinced myself that a fresh install is the way to go....
:)

TIA
