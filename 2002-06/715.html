&gt;I have a fair few servers in similar situations, and I have 
&gt;cooked 10krpm
&gt;drives due to lack of airflow.  I fully agree that drives can 
&gt;and do operate
&gt;fine at high temperatues, but there are limits.  

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Whist on the subject, does anyone have opinions on RAID 5?  
&gt;I've had three
&gt;servers now where RAID 5 hasn't helped because two drives have 
&gt;died at the
&gt;same time (or more precisely, a second drive dies before I can get a
&gt;replacement for the first).  

On the first bit, we have also cooked a couple 10k SCSI drives due
to lack of ventilation.  We had 4 of them setup in RAID 5 and 1 died,
strangely enough before we could get a replacement a second one went
AWOL as well............must be something in the air........caused all
sorts of hassles because at the time it was our main file storage box
and quite a number of users lost data from anything they had open at the
time.  We ended up replacing it with a single IDE drive as a "temporary"
measure, temporary being a little over 12 months and counting :), I'm 
about to replace it with a software RAID setup using IDE drives rather
than SCSI.


&gt;success rate has been with IBM.  I've heard/read though that 
&gt;IBM has sold
&gt;off their HDD business to Quantum.  I've also heard Fujitsu is 
&gt;getting out of the HDD market.  Who knows :)

If Quantum are going to manufacture IBM's drives or rebadge them etc, then
I wouldn't touch them as far as I could throw them.  Our main supplier used
to use Quantum drives in their workstations, I'd estimate in the last 3
years
that we've returned 20% of those drives under warranty.  They now use
Seagate,
with which (touch wood) we have had no problems so far.

(on the bright side the number of failures in our workstation drives has
proven
to be very effective education for users about storing their data on the
server ;)
