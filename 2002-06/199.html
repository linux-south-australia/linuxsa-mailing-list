Good old Tseng Labs ET4000 and ET6000 cards -- I've still got one in my main
Linux server, and i don't intend to change if i can help it.

If I was buying a new card I reckon Matrox make quite consistant quality
cards? I can't say the same for the ultra-budget nVidia-based cards.
A non-budget nVidia could be nice, but perhaps a bit pricey for your needs.
They do provide quite decent picture quality in my opinion -- much better
than the cheapo S3 and SiS cards. Driver support is much better for nVidia
and Matrox cards. Some S3 and SiS cards don't even seem to have any drivers
at all, I swear! (From my attempts to use them in certain linux boxes)

If you're spending a couple of grand on a server, its probably just better
to pay the extra $40 to $70 to get a "Decent" card, which has known working
drivers, and just run with it. By the way, X does support nVidia out of the
stock distro, just in 2D only. For a server thats probably the way to go?

Anyway seeya

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; What is people's opinion on good, commonly available VGA cards
&gt; appropriate for use in servers -- machines where X might get used a
&gt; little bit, but pretty rarely, and hence, video performance is simply
&gt; not an issue. 3D is obviously useless, as is large amounts of RAM. What
&gt; is important is compatibility -- I want it to be supported on anything,
&gt; whether it's the latest installer CD, a five year old distro, last years
&gt; LinuxCare BBC, Solaris x86, a BSD, or whatever. It also wants to be
&gt; cheap, not create much heat (or noise, not that that often matters), and
&gt; provide a decent, sharp 1024x768x8bit image on any monitor capable of
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt; Somehow, I always seem to end up with budget nVidia models, like the
&gt; TNT2 M64, or something like that, and, while they do work, they often
&gt; require messing about with X configs somewhat, when you really can't be
&gt; bothered. Even then, you're always left wondering if you should be using
&gt; the nv drivers or something. It's just more thinking than you need when
&gt; you're setting up a server (who wants to think about X when you're doing
&gt; server setup -- there's enough other things to be thinking about). I
&gt; recall a while back, before the 3d proliferation, that the safe choice
&gt; was something like a Tseng labs, or one of the early Diamond or S3
&gt; cards...
&gt;
&gt; Nowadays, I look at what's available, and nothing seems like a sensible
&gt; "default". Maybe it's just that I haven't really been following video
&gt; cards much since before 3D (I lost interest not long after 3D started),
&gt; but I'd really like to be able to buy something like a Tseng ET6000 for
&gt; $20 new to put in servers :) ... of course, they aren't supported by XP
&gt; these days, so who would sell them? :P
