Guys and Gals,
I am seeking an explanation as to the meanings of nmap's fingerprinting
results.  For those who know what i am talking about....
I specifically want to know what Tseq test info is all about.  I know
this is in relation to the TCP sequence number.  My query is this : in
reference to the examples below
TSeq(Class=RI%gcd=&lt;5%SI=&gt;BBB&&lt;FFFF%IPID=I%TS=0)
TSeq(Class=C)
TSeq(Class=RI%gcd=&lt;6%SI=&lt;2AEC8D6&&gt;2FF0F%IPID=Z%TS=U)
TSeq(Class=C|TD%gcd=3D090%SI=0)
TSeq(Class=TD%gcd=&lt;186A4%SI=&lt;14
TSeq(Class=C%Val=0))
TSeq(Class=TR)
and any other combination really.
Can anyone explain what all this means, i know Class=C, means that each
initial sequence number is constant, and that Class=TR means that each
initial sequence number is totally random.  However, I am not sure about
the other possibilities and combinations and how they each reflect the
other.
I have read the nmap-fingerprinting-article.txt and this doesn't really
explain the Tseq test sufficiently as its example is pretty simple,
which i udnerstood.  The web (to my searching) hasn't been really
helpful either.
For example what does IPID=I mean? i am guessing it has something to do
with the IP identification.  What does TS=U mean? etc etc.
So can anyone help????.

Cheers,
Adrian
