Unfortunately, I believe it is.

<A HREF="http://www.businessknowhow.com/money/factoring.htm">http://www.businessknowhow.com/money/factoring.htm</A> says:

&gt; One of the longest held rules is that of both Visa and MasterCard to
&gt; prohibit the occurrence of "factoring." This term refers to an
&gt; approved merchant processing the (credit card) sales of a
&gt; non-approved business through their merchant services account. By
&gt; "approved" I am referring to a merchant (whose definition would
&gt; include the business type, the business in particular, and the owner
&gt; or principles themselves) that has been evaluated for risk by a
&gt; particular card acquiring (i.e. payment processing) "underwriting"
&gt; bank and approved for handling its credit card sales processing. 

I presume this applies in Australia too.
