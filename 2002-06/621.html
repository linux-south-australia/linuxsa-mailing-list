I want to apologize if I came accross as having accomplished completely 
Linux on the desktop... - I must also very humbly say that if I am ever 
able to suceed, that I am a very ordinary person 'standing on the 
shoulders of giants' (As Torvalds put it in his book "Just for Fun.")

My goal is to make Linux just as easy for the people in our office to 
use as they think Windows is. I am going to pay the price on my own time 
however, and share the benefits with as many people as possible.

I am also more of an researcher, expirimentor, documentrian and deployer 
- there are a lot of things about Linux that I actually don't know.  I 
will work very hard to find the answers however.


Here are some things that I still haven't been able to work out:


1. Adding stability to the netware client
2. Compiling a module into the kernel
3. Integrate spamassassin and amavis into Netscape 6 seemlessly - that 
is - messages will be delivered to the Netscape inbox after being 
filtered by spamassassin and amavis WITHOUT the cost of receiving 
duplicate emails or the emails not remaining marked as read.

4. Achieve complete functionality for our financial statement program 
running in Linux under Wine. Our first choice program is much like Linux 
- very powerful very configurable but not intuitive  and time consuming 
to set up the inner workings of it. It does a lot of math for us (so we 
loose the 10 key) and it produces financial statements without the 
traditional use of the word processor / spreadsheet to accomplish.

5. Achieve complete functionality for our tax preparation program 
running in Linux under Wine. (The program we use does not install at all 
under Wine. The second choice loads and reads clients on the network. 
However, it doesn't print even with the Wine postscript driver that 
works for other programs - and menu problems)

6. Run a calander program that can be hotsynched to a handspring visor 
and be accesable to all 10 desks.

7. Run a program that calculates equipment depreciation in Linux (minor)

 I can't think of any more off of the top of my head now.

But anyway that's where I am at...

&gt;You have done well ! It sounds like you have accomplished something in a few 
&gt;months that has taken many of us years to do. I am not sure you can jump from 
&gt;on OS to another, and take on where you left off. Linux lifts you -up takes 
&gt;you down -and turns you around. It will continue to make a big impression on 
&gt;the Desktop - I am sure all of this (hard earned) experience will become 
&gt;invaluable.
