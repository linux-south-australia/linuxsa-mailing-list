Sorry if this is thread hijackin but:
If i have running linux machines i don't want to take down at all.  I want
to tar off the whole hard drive and be able to just chuck the tar back on
another hard drive should the original fail.  Can i do this without having
to reload linux etc etc which is too slow, i just want to chuck it back on
another drive without any hassles.

I could use ghost, but i was wondering if it's possible using tar or
something so as to not down the server everytime to disupt users for an hour
at a time while i ghost off.  the 'servers' are actual a router or two, dial
up servers etc with heaps of disc space on the drive so there's room to tar.

I made a directory called /t and from inside the directory did a:
tar czfv all.tgz /* --exclude /t

this seems to work nicely.  but, to get this restored, do i plug in the
Redhat CD and make the partition using fdisk or something and then tar from
a CD image or something.  I might add that this drive only has the root
partition on the drive to keep things simple.  i know that if the drive
fills it will crash, but the drive is pretty big and i keep an eye on it to
make sure it won't happen (not to mention having gigabytes of free space to
play with).

any ideas people?
thanks
M

I tried Norton Ghost about this time last year and had some problems
with Linux disk copying.
From memory, my problem was that whilst the partition data was copied
ok, the boot sectors for ext2 partitions weren't. (I confirmed this at
the time by viewing the actual bytes stored on each disk).

I ended up using the dd command exactly as you suggest and that worked
infallibly, many times over.

&gt; Be careful, though :-)
&gt;
&gt; Alternativaly, hard disk duplication is made very easy with products like
&gt; Norton Ghost.
&gt;
&gt; It understands FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ext2, etc and can duplicate partitions
and
&gt; resize automatically.  The latest version can also transfer images or
&gt; duplicate hard drives over LPT, USB (require host-to-host cable) or TCP/IP
&gt; (requires NDIS or packet driver) and supports some CD-Burners.
&gt;
&gt; It is run by booting from floppy (PC or MSDOS).  It has a nice GUI but
also
&gt; a very powerful command line interface.

&gt;  &gt; I want to make a copy of a Hard Drive. What products can I
&gt;  &gt; use to do this?
