Thanks for the emails, but, no go.   Still doesn't want to logon... I've
tried changing the name of the domain and making all the workstations join
the new domain (which works fine, wierdly enough) but on reboot, I can't
logon with any user.

Eek.

I just found out all these XP workstations had all hotfixes+windows updates
applied to them a few days ago, maybe this has broken authentication?  In
any case, I need a way around it...

&gt; xfesty,
&gt; 
&gt; Also have you tried:
&gt; 
&gt; login path = 
&gt; login home =
&gt; 
&gt; Note:  This is so it doesn't try to authenticate to the wrong device and yes
&gt; it does not have anything after the equal sign.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Ben and James;
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your advice, but unfortunately it didn't make my
&gt; situation any
&gt; better.  The XP patch you spoke about below I had already applied
&gt; (see my
&gt; earlier email).
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried several different smb.conf's, and even though I can join
&gt; a
&gt; domain, when I reboot and try to login, I can't.  I even got the
&gt; latest
&gt; samba from CVS last night, compiled it with syslogd support, but I
&gt; see
&gt; absolutely nothing when I try to login.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem isn't mapping drives - its just the user authentication.
&gt; I'm not
&gt; wishing to acutally use samba to share stuff, its just for the
&gt; workstation
&gt; logons at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody help?  This is driving me nuts... Even if someone with a
&gt; working
&gt; PDC for XP workstations can send me their smb.conf, and tell me the
&gt; samba
&gt; version they are using, it would be great.
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan
&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't quite solve this... so I'm still stuck :(
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I added machine accounts, and used smbpasswd to set passwords for
&gt; all XP
&gt;&gt;&gt; workstations on the network.  I can now go to each machine, get
&gt; them to join
&gt;&gt;&gt; the domain, but on reboot, they refuse to login.  Using either
&gt; the root
&gt;&gt;&gt; account, or a normal user.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I get this error message: "Windows cannot connect to the domain,
&gt; either
&gt;&gt;&gt; because the domain controller is down or otherwise unavailable,
&gt; or because
&gt;&gt;&gt; your computer account was not found.  Please try again later.  If
&gt; this
&gt;&gt;&gt; message continues to appear, contact your system administrator
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; assistance."
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; I see nothing in the log files when I try to logon, and there are
&gt; no errors
&gt;&gt;&gt; at startup.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any ideas?  I'm sure this is XP related (switching OS isn't
&gt; really an
&gt;&gt;&gt; option).
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'd say your right!
&gt;&gt; XP currently needs a registry hack in order to be able to be able
&gt; to
&gt;&gt; join a domain...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ;
&gt;&gt; ; This registry key (gathered from the Samba-tng lists) is needed
&gt;&gt; ; for a Windows XP client to join and logon to a Samba domain
&gt;&gt; ;

&gt;&gt; Cheers,
