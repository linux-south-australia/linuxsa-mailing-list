&gt; I'm trying to develp a smartcard program for linux. The cavet is that my
&gt; smartcard device uses a 3.58mhz crystal, where as the smartcard expects
&gt; a 6mhz clock. This means that the cards sense of time is somewhat
&gt; skewed, and its idea of 9600,8,E,2 is really 5720,8,E,2. I have programs
&gt; that work under windows fine (and even wine under linux), they just call
&gt; a serial set speed type function with "5720" and bingo, its set. Under
&gt; linux however, it seems a little trickyer...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone have any idea how to do this in C, or if not, with serserial?
&gt; (since I have its source). As far as I can tell, I need to set spd_cust
&gt; divisor 20, as 115200/20=~5720. The code in set serial doesnt seem to
&gt; support a divisor with decimals, as to get a real 5720 would require a
&gt; divisor of 20.13986013986014.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, it seems relevant to baud_base, which seems to be 115200 although
&gt; it depends on the crystal speed on the serial card. I dont know how to
&gt; verify this, as I suspect this might be whats wrong. 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any experience with these kinds of serial operation, or
&gt; can give me some pointer to docs with relevant levels of info? (the
&gt; serial programming howto is a joke if you dont want a normal 8,N,1
&gt; setting).

Using setserial
  - Set the option "spd_cust".
  - Set the clock divisor.  This follows the formula
      divisor = clock_rate / (bps * 16)
    the clock_rate of an IBM PC/AT is 1843200.

setserial /dev/ttyS0 spd_cust divisor 20

In the application set the baud rate to the magic value of 38400.

Don't change baud_base unless you've changed the crystal on the
motherboard -- baud_base is the UART's clock / 16.  If the
UART has a 2* or 4* second divisor then the serial driver will
automatically activate this if it is needed.  To see how this
works, have a look at change_speed() in

  /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/serial.c

which says

	if (info-&gt;state-&gt;type == PORT_16C950) {
		if (baud &lt;= baud_base)
			serial_icr_write(info, UART_TCR, 0);
		else if (baud &lt;= 2*baud_base) {
			serial_icr_write(info, UART_TCR, 0x8);
			baud_base = baud_base * 2;
		} else if (baud &lt;= 4*baud_base) {
			serial_icr_write(info, UART_TCR, 0x4);
			baud_base = baud_base * 4;
		} else
			serial_icr_write(info, UART_TCR, 0);
	}

Note that you won't get better accuracy with the 2* or 4* TCR clock,
so the best you can do is

   bps = 1843200 / (20 * 16)
       = 5760

Even if you write your own device driver you can't do better than
this, as the divisor register on the UART accepts an integer, not
a floating point number.  Other operating systems probably quitely
round off the input value of 5720 to 5760.  This is only a 0.7% error.
The error shouldn't matter for an asychronous link, as the clock is
reset at the rising edge of each character's start bit.

Glen
