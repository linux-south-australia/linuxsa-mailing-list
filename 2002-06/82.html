&gt; 
&gt; You seem to have missed the point, which was not one company writing a
&gt; similar product to another's, rather it was that Stallman incites people
&gt; to steal intellectual property.  Suppose Sharpe were to employ a team
&gt; of twenty leading scientists who, after five, long years researching
&gt; artificial sentience, eventually came up with an algorithm for a truly
&gt; thinking computer.  Sharpe would presumably want to recover his costs --
&gt; something in the order of $20 million.  Stallman would have that Sharpe
&gt; could charge *just one* client for the work, after which he would give
&gt; it freely away.  Sharpe might prefer to licence it on a per-seat basis
&gt; at $1,000 per year (which would be a bargain for the users.)  In such
&gt; a situation, Stallman would have it that we, the programming community,
&gt; would have a duty to write an open source replacement for Sharpe's team's
&gt; hard-won algorithms.  For those amongst us who are hung up on property,
&gt; but unable to see the intellectual part (he he), that is the sort of
&gt; theft that I despise.

This is laudable, but the world is a lot more complex that that.

Firstly, individuals, and even companies, rarely do that sort of 
ground-breaking research. It is mostly done in public institutions (like 
universities), although some of it is done in private universities like 
Stanford and also in public companies that have legal monopolies (like 
Bell Labs, and so on).

If the work is done in the first of these organizations, then there are 
very real issues to work through, and current approaches by conservative 
governments that insist that the results of such research be exclusively 
licenced to for-profit companies are questionable.

Secondly, there are often competing organizations working on the same 
types of product/research, and they often poach staff from each other. 
While such staff are usually bound by non-disclosure agreements, there is 
often a great deal they can contribute without revealing exactly what 
their former employer was doing.

And finally, events like Microsoft being fined in French courts for Piracy 
suggest that such organizations are far from being knights in shining 
armor. Draw your own conclusions.
 
&gt; &gt; Furthermore, patents, copyright, trademark, etc, were all created to allow 
&gt; &gt; progress.
&gt; 
&gt; No, Richard, not to *allow* progress, but to *encourage* it.

Indeed. That was poor phrasing on my part, as I intended to say what you 
have stated more correctly.

However, it is clear that the patent system is no longer working to the 
good of all and that it needs fine-tuning. Perhaps even a whole new system 
needs to be created.
