Ah, I stand corrected then about the B-trees n stuff.

Reiser also talks at length about how he's trying to bring back the
filesystem as the preferred method of storage for everything. Bypassing the
need for database systems sitting on top of the fs like we have now, for
instance. At least i think he said that, but its been a while since i read
it.

I'm not sure if this is like Plan9, or nothing like it, since I haven't
used plan9 or its file systems. I gather it represents just about everything
as a file though, but it was more about resource abstraction, rather than
the super-relational-filesystem that reiser seems to be after.

Not sure if i'm wandering down a dangerous path of speculation here, and I
haven't had any coffee yet this morning.

&gt; &gt; In the case of reiserfs3 (the

&gt; As used in OS/2's HPFS, and possibly BeFS (memory's a little flaky
&gt; on that last one).  I don't think it was new even in OS/2's time.
&gt; (In fact, HPFS looks suspiciously like NTFS).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; and small files don't have seperate metadata inodes.
&gt;
&gt; As used in OS/9 68K V2.x file system (circa late 80's).  NTFS does
&gt; something similar to this - for small amounts of data, the data is
&gt; kept with the inode equivalent.  When Microsoft introduced file
&gt; system quotas (how innovative!), it didn't take this data into
&gt; account, which apparently led to a DoS condition by creating a
&gt; large number of small files that never impacted on your quota.
&gt;
&gt; Everything new is old again - or something like that.
