&gt; Firstly, individuals, and even companies, rarely do that sort of 
&gt; ground-breaking research. It is mostly done in public institutions (like 
&gt; universities), although some of it is done in private universities like 
&gt; Stanford and also in public companies that have legal monopolies (like 
&gt; Bell Labs, and so on).

Could that be because it's so hard to stop intellectual property theft,
so only those organisations that don't care about profit can afford to
do the research?


&gt; And finally, events like Microsoft being fined in French courts for Piracy 
&gt; suggest that such organizations are far from being knights in shining 
&gt; armor. Draw your own conclusions.

I read up on that.  They bought a company that was already in dispute with
the plaintif.  I know it's fun to throw mud at Microsoft, but in this case
it's not warranted.

 
&gt; However, it is clear that the patent system is no longer working to the 
&gt; good of all and that it needs fine-tuning. Perhaps even a whole new system 
&gt; needs to be created.

I do agree that the patent system is failing.  I think that's because
patents are being awarded for trivial "discoveries."  But I'm not sure
that fine-tuning is the answer; I think the direction that the system
is now going is the result of fairly recent "tinkering", for example
the awarding of software patents.
