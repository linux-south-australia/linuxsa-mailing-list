I am getting frustrated....


In the past few months I have worked very hard to make Linux on the 
desktop a reality for my company.

I will usually think of something really neat that we ought to want to 
do and work very hard to figure out how the thing works. [God forbid if 
I didn't have the wonderful help from helpful people like yourselves. 
:-) ] In a nutshell, I have found the Linux experience to be a whole lot 
of work, a whole lot of learning followed by disappointment that what I 
wanted to do does not work, followed by some type of overall sucess 
blemished by the struggle to get there.

When I first started I knew nothing of Samba and didn't have an extra 
server lying around to experiment with... So I felt that it was 
essential for us to access clinet data stored on our Netware 4.11 
server.  I already had Red Hat but my knowledge was limited - so I was 
at first very happy to see that Red Hat 7 claimed to be IPX compatable.

After I installed the thing I looked for a GUI login for Netware - a 
netware client. None anywhere - that took a few hours...

I search the Internet for guidance for a few hours....finally something 
about having to recompile my kernel, a bunch of writing in the how to 
that made absolutely no sense to me...another 8 hours down the drain. 
However, I go to bed happy because I found Caldera's web site...which 
had a Netware Client for Linux how to page.  Surely that feature must be 
included in Caldera Open Linux I reasoned.  So I bought the thing on 
line and waited anxiously for a week for it to arrive.

When I got it, big disappointment, it did not have a Netware Client in 
it.  I called up Caldera and Red Hat for help.  Caldera's line sent me 
directly to a local computer shop. The person that answered the phone 
barely spoke English and said "Netwooo? Client...what is that?" I called 
Red Hat and asked for help and the guy started talking about his client 
portfolio. I reached another department at Caldera and they said "well, 
you could pay us $3,000 for a year of support..." At this point I 
thought, "what a bunch of bozo's!
...Microsoft is cheaper!" Obviously we weren't going to pay $3,000 for 
something we had already.

Caldera sent me the NKFS package, I had to complain to get it sent to me 
as I could not find it.  They said just compile this into your kernel. 
To say the least I hadn't a clue.

I didn't give up and searched the Internet again - I came across some 
posts from Linuxsa asking about the netware client for Linux but no 
answers. BTW - that's how I found you all - :-)  .  This time I found a 
post at the novellfans board from Victor Baldassi giving me an essential 
piece of the puzzle for getting a Novell 4.11 client for Linux. I found 
some more posts and put it together and the 
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLUUUUUUUAAAAAA! 
 It worked.....(That's a Back to the Future it Worked)

So at this point I felt morally obligated to post my findings in the 
clearest most complete way I could.  I posted one message here and one 
at computing.net to answer the unanswered questions that I had seen.

Here it is:

<A HREF="http://computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/8273.html">http://computing.net/linux/wwwboard/forum/8273.html</A>

 
But I have now found that if more than say 5 - 10 computers log into the 
netware server through Linux, everybody gets kicked off.  The netware 
server monitor has a rip router message. I know nothing of rip routers, 
and have no way of figuring out how or why this takes place. I can't 
read a packet sniffer.

I finally got bold enough to compile a kernel and its no biggie. 
However, when I tried to load the NKFS module I got s message that was 
somewhat like this:


Per Linus Torvalds...change your module...So I still haven't got that 
module compiled into my kernel.


ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!


And such has been my experience with Linux so far.
