<H1>piracy vs open-source</H1>

<PRE>
just recently I read an article on how piracy is hurting Open Source
software and the I realized that if we had any competition then it was
this and not M$ or other proprietary software

its one of my desires to see Linux wide spread on the desktop and
promoting it is the purpose of this forum so I thought I would try to
open up discussion on this list, the following remarks are a few of my
thoughts along the line of Piracy vs Open Source and I invite any
sensible comments on how we can promote Linux on the desktop.

cheers Darrin




thoughts on Open Source vs Software Piracy

benefits of software piracy

1  access to the latest available software

2  no need to pay for the use

3  ability to keep up with the standards

4  no need to worry about changing file formats

Drawbacks of Software Piracy

1  guilt

2  need to continually look for cracks and passwords as well as 
   ways to circumvent copy protection

3  access to latest software may be inhibited by better copy protection

4  denying the developer of income from his/her intellectual property 
   (be it morally right or wrong for them to do this i is their choice)

5  no access to software support

6  the software is usually proprietary and thus doesn't enable you to
modify it for your own needs

7  viral infections in the available programs

8  possible prosecution

9  the sowing and reaping principal (in this case if you steal from
others then expect others to steal form you)

Drawbacks of Open Source

1  not all file formats supported (ie .mov not supported natively but
quicktime works well under codeweavers wine preveiw 6)

2  sometimes there is still a geeky image to GNU/Linux

3  still some software products not available for Linux natively (ie
photoshop)

4  a slight to mild learning curve required for learning a new system of
doing things

5  in some cases there is a need to dual boot to maintain access to
required software titles(although wine is very mature and there are
other products like win4lin and VMware)

benefits of open source software

1  The GPL put Software into public ownership and the developers have
agreed to do this willingly therefore you as part of the public own it

2  the software is freely distributable and therefore loadable on as
many computers as you wish (a copy of the latest distribution is only an
email to the local LUG (Linux user group) away)

3  no guilt is involved in using open source software as you already own
it

4  the developers pride themselves in their work (and aren't on a tight
development schedule)and therefore you find that the products are often
more stable and equally feature rich

5  thousands of programs are above the 1.0 level of development and
therefore satisfy the the developers in both stability and features

6  you can modify the program for your own needs or hire some one who
can

7  the development model lends itself to dealing with viral infections
as a bug and therefore treats them as something that needs to be
modified in the software

8  access to help from: the developer directly, local Linux user groups,
and the neighbor hood geek


9  most open source software is now at a mature level and is usually
cloned from other software, so therefore there is very familiar to users
on other platforms
10  you are not tied down to proprietary file formats


benefits of open source software over Software Piracy

there is a guilt free and in expensive alternative to Pirating software
that is both mature and stable, there is now an open source alternative
to any situation that exists. the GPL puts software in to the public
domain and seeing that you are part of the public it is in your domain
and you are entitled to do any thing you want with it, you have good
access to the software titles (only an email away to th local LUG).
