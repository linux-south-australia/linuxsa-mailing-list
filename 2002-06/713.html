I've done exactly this before, but I just used ssh, ppp, iptables and
route.

You need a recent version of ppp that can deal with using a child program
to transmit/receive the ppp stream. (Any recent distro should do)

Use ssh as that child to make the connection over where the encrypted link
goes. If neccessary you may need to do some port-forwarding with inverse
masquerading at one end to get into the clients network, but thats not
hard with iptables. (But its a FPITA to do with ipfwadm/ipchains)


Now setup the routing and firewall rules as appropriate for this tunnelled
ppp0 interface..

And presto! you can do stuff like

[192.168.1.99]$ telnet 192.168.2.66

with no worries.



I've tried using PPTP and GRE and IPsec and so on, but they always caused
me grief. The tried-and-true ssh/ppp tunnel requires just one port open on
your firewall, and works thru all types of NAT and port forwarding.
(Or other tunnels for that matter)


Some people have said it's inelegant -- but so far no one else has shown
me another way to do it that works as well in those circumstances.

I'm genuinely interested to hear if you manage to work this out using
"industry standard" (ie. cisco compatible)  methods with ipsec or such.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; I have been under the impression that it is impossible to do IPSec or
&gt; PPTP through a NAT gateway... However
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.impsec.org/linux/masquerade/ip_masq_vpn.html">http://www.impsec.org/linux/masquerade/ip_masq_vpn.html</A> seems to
&gt; indicate that one can masquerade both of them, with a few caveats.
&gt;
&gt; However, this document only applies to the 2.0 and 2.2 series kernels.
&gt; Also, it appears to require patching the firewall itself (though I
&gt; haven't read it thoroughly)...
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know how I can do what I want... That is:
&gt;
&gt;   My LAN
&gt; 192.168.1.0/24
&gt;     |
&gt;     |
&gt; 192.168.1.1 (internal interface)
&gt; My Linux 2.4
&gt;  Gateway (does SNAT)
&gt;  a.b.c.d (external real interface)
&gt;     |
&gt;     |
&gt;  Internet-------\
&gt;                 |
&gt;              e.f.g.h (external real interface)
&gt;         Some Clients' unknown
&gt;         Gateway (does SNAT)
&gt;            192.168.2.1 (internal interface)
&gt;                 |
&gt;                 |
&gt;          192.168.2.0/24
&gt;           Clients' LAN
&gt;          with my laptop
&gt;
&gt; What I want to be able to do is communicate from within the client LAN
&gt; to my gateway as if I were on my LAN. It needs to be encrypted all the
&gt; way, and I can't really do much to the Clients' gateway (which could
&gt; be Linux, Cisco or Windows or anything). I wouldn't really need to be
&gt; on my own 192.168.1.0 range -- it would be ok to be on some other
&gt; range, so there were no conflicts with the client LAN. All I want to
&gt; do is ensure that I can do things like interact with my IMAP and SMTP
&gt; mail servers without opening up an external port.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas? Could I perhaps set up an unencrypted IP over IP tunnel
&gt; through, and then run IPSec over that? That way, the IPSec packets
&gt; would appear to be unnaffected by the SNATting.
