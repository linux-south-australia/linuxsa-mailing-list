&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi if i have Debian (potatoe) installed  will i be able to upgrade
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Woody when its released by using apt-get?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes and it's allready released.
&gt; 
&gt; er... no it's not... not according to www.debian.org, anyway...

&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK, it's available, but not released -- it's still in testing, and
&gt; hasn't made it to frozen yet, let alone stable. When will it get
&gt; there? ... when it's ready :)
&gt; 
OOPS sorry. Yes that's correct it not OFFICIALLY released but it is
available as testing.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You should read the manual for apt.
&gt; &gt; but it can be as somple as apt-get upgrade dist (or similar)
&gt; 
&gt; apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
Apologies for the half answer. 
&gt; 
&gt; sometimes you need to do this more than onces.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You may need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed, if you are presently running potato, you'll need to change all
&gt; instances of "potato" (or "stable") to "woody" (or "testing"). It's
&gt; a good idea (IMHO) to use the real name of the distro (potato, woody,
&gt; sid, etc) rather than the state of it (stable, frozen, testing,
&gt; unstable), so that you don't inadvertently get upgraded without
&gt; knowing... also note that the sources are not neccessarily the same -
&gt; there are no security sources for woody yet...
&gt; 
Hmm. I never use the real names . That way I can mix and match.
Richard is right though. If your after a particular realease and want
the stability that brings then use the "names".  (you will also avoid a
whole heap of side issues-- locales. fontsets etc)

I'm currently using "testing" and have never (after the first build)
upgraded my distribution, just edited /etc/apt/sources.list to show the
packages I'm after. (there are also some gnu packages I have in there as
well. )

If your after the more bleeding edge use "unstable" which works fine for
most people.(I moved away as I was upgrading stuff I didn't want to or
need to --I was doing some development work on CronosII and it was
becoming a library nightmare ith Gnome Gnome2 scrollkeeper etc.)
Generally though "The Big Step" is your Xserver moving from 3.X to 4.X
(I had a few problems, now all as very fine).

Happy to explain all this in proper English if you need .....
