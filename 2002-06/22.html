&gt; Stallman is passionate about his views, highly political and he's not

I wasn't trying to detract from anything RMS has done, *except* sing
that song.  Which I think most people would agree is *not* going to
shoot up to #1 on *any* chart without the word "chainsaw" in it.  It's
nothing more than that.

[...]

&gt; Remember, Stallman has a lot of intellectual property out there and a
&gt; lot of ideas. People don't like tall poppies and they do cut them down
&gt; when they can.

Oh, please.  This was a relatively gentle jab at one individual artifact
that is, quite frankly, a bit of an eyebrow raiser.

&gt; /me has been born into a rather sad race of beings

This is probably true, but not, I think, because of a couple of peoples
opinions about the way a particular song has been sung.
