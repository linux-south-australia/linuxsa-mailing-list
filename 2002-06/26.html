&gt; no matter whether you agree or disagree with him, i dont think anyone could 
&gt; debate his passion and commitment to free software for everyone - a noble 
&gt; endeavour. his methods can be questionable, and his stances a bit abrasive, 
&gt; but oh well, perfection in heroes is a ridiculous concept.

It's not his passion that I would debate, but his integrity.  The man
openly called for people to steal intellectual property ("It's our duty
to create open source replacements for proprietary software.")  He cares
not what it cost the inventor to create that intellectual property in
the first place.  How hard it is to think a truly unique idea; how easy
to copy it.  Take away the financial reward and more often than not you
also take away the incentive to research.

I applaud the genuine gifts he gave the world, but despise his call
to theft.

Could it be that Stallman is the reason why so many now strive for
software patents instead of copyright?  Could there be a crueler legacy
for future generations?

If Stallman is the question, patents may be the only answer.
