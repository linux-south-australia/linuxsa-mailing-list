&gt; * why hasn't someone with a lot of money (not necessarily brains)
&gt; actually challenged the GPL in court?

The answer in Australia is the "Trumpet Software v OzEmail" decision. In
this case OzEmail distrubuted a copy of Trumpet WinSock on the cover of
Australian Personal Computer magazine -- this copy was modified, a breach
of the Trumpet WinSock shareware licence.  The licence was written in a
file included in the WinSock .ZIP file, as is done with the GPL "COPYING"
file.

The court held for Trumpet.

This decision, plus the "Computermate" decision, is seen as making the GPL
(or any other on-disk licence) a valid copyright licence.  So any argument
about the GPL has to be involve its terms.  As the terms of the GPL are
somewhat less onerous than the terms of the Trumpet licence and much less
onerous then the terms of many 'propietary' software licences you would
think a adverse decision would be unlikely.

Furthermore, an adverse decision would also render many 'propietary'
licenses unenforceable.  When this has happened in the past the government
has been quick to amend the Copyright Act (eg: when the "Apple" decision
found that object code had no literary merit, and thus was not protected
under the Copyright Act of the day).
