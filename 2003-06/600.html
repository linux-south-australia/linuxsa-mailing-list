 &gt; &gt; Not sure if this has been reported here yet, but...
 &gt; &gt; It appears the bill raised by Ian Gilfillian regarding giving
 &gt; &gt; preference to OpenSource/FreeSoftware in SA governmental software
 &gt; &gt; aquistion is being opposed by proprierty software companies under
 &gt; &gt; the banner of the (misnamed) Initiative for Software Choice (ISC). 
 &gt; &gt; They've lobbied Mike Rann.  It's now time for YOU to lobby Mr Rann
 &gt; &gt; and your own member of parliament if you care about such things.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Ok. What's Mike Rann's email address?

No, that's not how it works.  You actually need to invest some effort.

Politicians are simple folk;  They see feedback from the votors on a 
bit of a sliding scale, where the following are all equivalent to 
each other:

   10,000 email messages
   1000 phone calls
   10 faxes
   1 letter

Don't send email;  It won't even get read.  It'll be picked up by an
advisor who will just put a tally-mark in a box marked "pro-OSS", and
unless the number of tally-marks is large enough to overrun the page
nobody will give a damn.

Phone calls are better, but only if they're sustained.  A one-day
spike of phone calls sparked by an obvious publicity campaign will
be forgotten in a week after the campaign is over.

Faxes are better:  They might actually get read by the politician.
More likely that they'll go to the same advisor who reads the email,
though.

A written, personally-signed, individually-worded letter is the best.
Form letters aren't good (because once the reader has seen a couple 
of them all the rest will be ignored).

Summary:  Invest some effort in the process of drafting a letter, 
printing it, signing it, stuffing it in an envelope, sticking a stamp
on it and putting it in a post box (sorry to detail all the steps;
Perhaps people have forgotten how this stuff works in these days of
email :-)
