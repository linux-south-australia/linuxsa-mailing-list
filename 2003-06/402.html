&gt; Hi David,

&gt; Strange that it worked once before & not now after upgrading.
&gt; Are you using the same XF86Config you used in MDK9 ?

Should be, but possibly got screwed up during the upgrade. Guess who forgot to 
backup :(

&gt;
&gt; First noticeable error in your XF86Config is that your ServerLayout
&gt; Screen's don't match the Screen Identifier names.
&gt;
&gt; Line:		Screen "screen1" Rightof "Screen0"
&gt; Should read:	Screen "screen1" Rightof "screen0"
&gt;
&gt; Spot the difference :)

That took about a minutes worth of staring to see :) Unfortunately, not the 
solution.

&gt;
&gt; Do both cards work ok by themselves ?

Yup.

I took your XF86Config file and turned it into my XF86Config-4 file. I changed 
the monitor details, and the details for the PCI card. After a little more 
figiting, I managed to get it sorted. For some reason, things still go AWOL 
if I try to make it use the PCI card as device 0, but using AGP instead 
suffices :)

I'm still not entirely sure where the actual problem was - normally I'd be 
inclined to work that out before being happy with a solution, but I'm too 
tired to play with it anymore. Either way, it now works, and I'm happy.

Thanks for your help Rick, most appreciated.

Cheers,
David
