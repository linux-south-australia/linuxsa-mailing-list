Thanks for your comments. I have skimmed through the most recent LSB 
specification (I don't have download access so I can't do any research atm), 
and it doesn't seem to specify all that much, perhaps I should look at it 
again. If they are indeed packaging software for an LSB reference 
implementation, then this is basically *exactly* what I want. I would love if 
you could go to the website of a project and download "app-3.2-lsb.i586.rpm" 
and have it *just work* without farting around with compatibility problems.

The problem with rpm is that dependency issues can be a nightmare (especialy 
for the newbie). Even with urpmi on Mandrake I still have problems from 
braindead packages. For example, I installed juk from Textstar's repository, 
however it wanted to download like 130MB of packages. He had made this 
package depend on *his* KDE packages, even though I had KDE 3.1 installed and 
met the requirements of the program. I installed with rpm --nodeps, and it 
worked fine.

If there was an LSB package of juk, I wouldn't want it to depend on LSB's 
version of KDE, I would want it to depend on the version of KDE that I have 
installed, be it installed from a Mandrake package or from some other source. 
The root of the problem here is that rpm depends on *packages* rather than 
files. The dependency resolution should see that I have /usr/lib/libqt-3.1.0 
and say "well that's what I want", and install without complaining.

But what to do if libqt-3.1.0 is missing? It's a 2MB library, do we want the 
package manager to want to download a 50MB KDE RPM in order to install it? 
There needs to be more fine-grained dependency resolution. Maybe instead of 
depending on "kdecore-3.1.2-mdk.i586.rpm", it depends on "kdecore &gt;= 3.1" and 
whatever package provides that gets installed.

All of these issues and more are goals of the "autopackage" project, 
www.autopackage.org, and so I am hopeful that the future of installing 
GNU/Linux software will be much brighter.

Anyway, as for my first idea (new etc layout/config stuff), this is the most 
important IMO. You bring up some good points about the implementation 
problems of such a standard, and indeed I was thinking of these problems last 
night.

I think it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible to implement a 
configuration file syntax that meets my stated goals below (i.e. human 
readable *and* able to define a GUI). I didn't want to have xml configuration 
files, because I believe they are very difficult to read. For example:

What is easier to read, this:

      &lt;defaults&gt;
        &lt;DefaultMenuLanguage&gt;en&lt;/DefaultMenuLanguage&gt;
        &lt;DefaultAudioLanguage&gt;en&lt;/DefaultAudioLanguage&gt;
        &lt;DefaultSubtitleLanguage&gt;en&lt;/DefaultSubtitleLanguage&gt;
        &lt;ParentalCountry&gt;US&lt;/ParentalCountry&gt;
        &lt;ParentalLevel&gt;15&lt;/ParentalLevel&gt;
        &lt;PlayerRegion&gt;1&lt;/PlayerRegion&gt;
      &lt;/defaults&gt;

or this?

[Defaults]
DefaultMenuLanguage=en
DefaultAudioLangauge=en
DefaultSubtitleLanguage=en
ParentalCountry=US
ParentalLevel=15
PlayerRegion=1


I think the only solution would be to, as you suggested, have a GUI 
description file, and have a tool that generates the config file from that. 
But what's the problem with this? Changes to the config file are lost and one 
of my design goals are violated (allowing the user to modify the config file 
without the GUI app treading all over it) - similar to the Linuxconf tool you 
mentioned.

I was originally thinking that the config file syntax would allow for a lot of 
interpretation by the GUI program, but I could imagine some rather horrible 
looking GUI's coming from that. I also wanted the various configuration 
variables to have types so that the GUI could complain if the user tried to 
set a variable to an erroneous value (e.g an Integer type being set to a 
string).

In order to meet design goal of allowing a user to edit the configuration file 
by hand, prehaps we should borrow some ideas from C++ and OO programming.

What if the layout file describes only the layout and the modifyable variables 
(i.e. the header file, or class description), and the configuration file 
contains the values for those variables (the "implementation"). The 
configuration file should have a syntax such that it can be parsed by a 
program and modified variables can be updated easily.

The layout file could also borrow some other OO terms, such as "public" and 
"private" variables, i.e. ones that are for the programs internal use, and 
others that are meant to be modifyable by the user. Only public variables 
would be displayed by the GUI.

All possible configuration variables accepted by the program should be 
described in the layout file. A whole class of variables should be able to be 
made "private" so that the GUI doesn't display them, but are available to the 
advanced user should he/she want them. This allows the graphical user 
interface to be simple and readable without being overloaded with options. It 
also allows the configuration file to contain data useful for the program 
internally, but not the user.

Anyway, this will need to be thought of in much more detail...

Another key feature is the fact that the config files can be parsed by a 
library, and so that is less effort for app developers. Not only do I want 
the library to parse files, but I want it to take care of opening them. That 
way, say "samba" doesn't care where the config file is, it asks the library 
to find and open it - hence the /etc directory can be organised anyway the 
distributor sees fit, it wont break applications (and wont require 1000 
symlinks everywhere). I imagine config file lookup would be similar to how 
libraries are looked up by the linker (i.e. probably maintain a cache, and 
have a search-path setup. The app using the library could also give libetc 
hints, such as saying that it is a "service", and so libetc searches the 
"service" directory first).

*phew*, okay I'm going to go think about what this syntax should look like, 
starting with the XML produced by QTDesigner. Thanks for the feedback!

Cheers,

Damien

P.S.: The /dev/pts/gui thing is meant for desktop/home user systems, stop 
thinking like a sysadmin! :) At home, users are their own admins and need 
hand holding occasionally (and typing "tail -100 /var/log/messages | less" is 
too much for them).

APPENDIX: 

As for your comment saying that people would say the current system isn't that 
complex, I'm going by what my /etc directory looks like. Here I see that 
postfix has it's own directory, but proftpd doesnt, samba has it's own 
directory, but tmdns doesnt, etc... In the /etc root directory we see config 
files for things from printers to timezone to mail to boot configuration. 
None of this directory has any sort of organisation except for the rc.d 
init.d stuff...

I believe it is broken.

&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've been thinking about the various deficiencies in most GNU/Linux
&gt; &gt; distributions and I would like to detail some of my ideas for
&gt; &gt; improvement
&gt; &gt; here for feedback. These are just notes and are by no means
&gt; &gt; comprehensive, I
&gt; &gt; plan on writing more detailed papers on some possible
&gt; &gt; designs/code etc..
&gt;
&gt; Interesting ideas...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway here they are:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1) Standardised /etc filesystem
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; - sane filetree:
&gt;
&gt; If your main goal with this point is to make finding files easier, you
&gt; could do that yourself quite easily, whilst still maintaining compatibility
&gt; with present Unices -- simply make your tree a set of symlinks to the right
&gt; files...
&gt;
&gt; eg:
&gt;
&gt; /etc/system/services/samba/smb.conf -&gt; /etc/samba/smb.conf
&gt;
&gt; and so on...
&gt;
&gt; However, there will always be some that defy categorisation ... should
&gt; XDMCP go under services or x11? both? Also, many would claim that the
&gt; present system isn't particularly complex, and your idea would be adding
&gt; unneccessary layers of indirection, making it less convenient...
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; -Standardised configuration file syntax with the following
&gt; &gt; design goals:
&gt;
&gt; I see only one way that this is possible, and that is to design your new
&gt; config files with some sort of program that generates the old format from
&gt; them. ie your XML sendmail config file gets parsed, and a normal
&gt; sendmail.cf gets generated (perhaps via a sendmail.mc). You (or anyone)
&gt; will never manage to change the formats that each program uses. It's too
&gt; complex, there are too many political issues, and not enough advantage.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - Easily human readable and modifyable (so people can edit
&gt; &gt; with vi if need be)
&gt; &gt; - Syntax doubles as simple GUI layout guide
&gt; &gt;     - entire /etc directory tree should be parseable by a GUI program
&gt; &gt;       so that *all* configuration options for the *entire system* can
&gt; &gt;       be modified/viewed via a GUI
&gt;
&gt; Danger! if people edit with a text editor, then this GUI layout may end up
&gt; getting awfully botched.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;     - A GUI program need not know about say "sendmail"
&gt; &gt; specifically in  order
&gt; &gt; to provide a GUI to the user.
&gt;
&gt; I see where you're going with this, but what about when there is a feature
&gt; that exists, but isn't mentioned in the config file? How do you turn it on
&gt; in the GUI?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - A library (libetc) provided that can parse the /etc
&gt; &gt; directory tree and the
&gt; &gt; files within it. This library should be cross platform (e.g. so BSD
&gt; &gt;   can adopt if it wishes - this includes the structure of the
&gt; &gt; /etc tree)
&gt;
&gt; BSD (or at least FreeBSD) is quite different -- it has /etc and
&gt; /usr/local/etc for different types of program (base OS stuff and ports) ...
&gt; It also has a completely different init script system... I doubt making it
&gt; cross platform will be easy (and I doubt the BSD folk would be interested
&gt; -- they tend to err on conservatism)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ** See Appendix for a glimpse at the various mish-mash of
&gt; &gt; configuration styles
&gt; &gt; and  file locations currently found under /etc
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2) Unified reference distribution that augments the LSB.
&gt;
&gt; This may not be in the best commercial interests of companies like RedHat,
&gt; where differentiation is essential... However, that said, I don't really
&gt; see where this usefully differs from the goals of the LSB: "The goal of the
&gt; LSB is to develop and promote a set of standards that will increase
&gt; compatability among Linux distributions and enable software applications to
&gt; run on any compliant system..."
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - Not a distribution in the common sense, but a specification for a
&gt; &gt; distribution.
&gt;
&gt; I thought this was basically what the LSB is intended to be...
&gt;
&gt; Also, check out <A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/impl/">http://www.linuxbase.org/impl/</A> -- it's the "reference
&gt; implementation", containing everything that is minimal for a LSB-compliant
&gt; Linux...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - The specification complies with the LSB, but fills in the blanks.
&gt; &gt;      - This may include: library versions, compiler version,
&gt; &gt; compile flags
&gt; &gt;        used, etc
&gt;
&gt; Why? Shouldn't this be something for distributors to differentiate their
&gt; distributions with?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - A repository of packages packaged in a distribution
&gt; &gt; independent format (e.g.
&gt; &gt; something  like "autopackage"). These packages should be able
&gt; &gt; to be installed
&gt; &gt; painlessly on  "Official Reference Distribution" compliant system.
&gt;
&gt; I'm pretty sure LSB is aiming at something like this sort of
&gt; compatibiltiy...
&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm: <A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/packaging/lcd/faq/index.html">http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/packaging/lcd/faq/index.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; Seems they've decided on a version of RPM, but intend to make it
&gt; distro-independant...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - "Official Reference Distribution" compliance tested with
&gt; &gt; software. Software
&gt; &gt; for this testing  is free and licensed under the GNU GPL.
&gt;
&gt; See the reference implementation above...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - Distribution companies can display a logo saying they are
&gt; &gt; compatibile with
&gt; &gt; the reference distro  simply by passing the software tests.
&gt; &gt; No fees are
&gt; &gt; charged (it is community supported after all).
&gt;
&gt; I think LSB intends to do this...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - Documentation repository.
&gt; &gt;   - This includes:
&gt; &gt;       - HOWTO's for best programming practices for developing
&gt; &gt; and deploying
&gt; &gt;         software on a GNU/Linux system  (e.g. where to store data,
&gt; &gt;         configuration data, command line options syntax, user
&gt; &gt; interface guide,
&gt; &gt;         when to use libraries, packaging, binary
&gt; &gt; compatibility issues, etc).
&gt; &gt;       - any other relevant documentation.
&gt;
&gt; I thought we had that, in a somewhat less formal form -- www.tldp.org
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The goal of this is to provide a consistent and unified
&gt; &gt; standard for deploying
&gt; &gt; software on GNU/Linux system without worrying about binary
&gt; &gt; incompatibility
&gt; &gt; issues and/or inconsistencies in the filesystem layout. It
&gt;
&gt; OK, that is covered by the LSB, I'm quite confident.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; also provides
&gt; &gt; guides to programmers so that hopefully all programs on a
&gt; &gt; GNU/Linux system
&gt; &gt; behave in a predictable and consistent manner. Programmers
&gt; &gt; who's programs
&gt; &gt; pass the various guideline tests can display an icon on the
&gt; &gt; webpage for their
&gt;
&gt; This is a little different, and I'd be confident that it is pretty much
&gt; impossible to do. I assume you're talking about something like Apple's
&gt; Human Interface Guidelines
&gt; (<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AquaHIG">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AquaHIG</A>
&gt;u idelines/index.html)? Religious issues will stop this from ever occurring.
&gt; Open Source type people appreciate choice, and will dislike having the
&gt; choices made for them. This isn't to say it wouldn't be a good idea, just
&gt; that it's impossible :)
&gt;
&gt; It's also difficult (and therefore expensive) to test for this kind of
&gt; thing...
&gt;
&gt; That said, I'm pretty sure both KDE and GNOME have their own guidelines...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; project. All applications packaged for the "Official
&gt; &gt; Reference Distribution"
&gt; &gt; comply with all defined standards.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3) Protocol for the underlying system to communicate with the GUI
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure I understand this. Isn't this what X is supposed to be? Hmm...
&gt; Ah, it seems you're looking for a way to send messages to the user, as
&gt; opposed to programatically communicating with the GUI... right?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - A device in the /dev filesystem should be available to
&gt; &gt; facilitate such
&gt; &gt; communication. I nominate "/dev/pts/gui".
&gt; &gt; - A process can gain exclusive read access to this file. Text
&gt; &gt; piped into this
&gt; &gt; file is of a certain syntax so that it can be parsed and the desktop
&gt; &gt; environment can provide the user with a suitable notice (such
&gt; &gt; as a flashing
&gt; &gt; icon in the system tray, or messagebox).
&gt;
&gt; What if there's more than one GUI? Consider boxes that have Xterminals
&gt; running off them...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - /dev/pts/gui should be owned by the controlling process
&gt; &gt; (have same uid/gid
&gt; &gt; as the controlling process). If controlling process lacks sufficient
&gt; &gt; permissions to be notified of a message, the write to
&gt; &gt; /dev/pts/gui is denied.
&gt;
&gt; The "controlling process" is the GUI itself (or some program within it),
&gt; right? So if I log in to GNOME, I'd expect there would be some applet that
&gt; would be reading from this device...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; - If there is no controlling process to /dev/pts/gui, the
&gt; &gt; kernel buffers
&gt; &gt; messages until there is a controlling process  and then
&gt; &gt; passes the messages
&gt; &gt; to it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The purpose of this is to provide the user with notification
&gt; &gt; of certain things
&gt; &gt; the underlying system is doing that they may need to know about. Such
&gt; &gt; notifications include hardware detection changes at bootup,
&gt; &gt; hotplug changes,
&gt; &gt; system shutdown, etc...
&gt;
&gt; I would consider that half the time, users shouldn't want to know -- only
&gt; the sysadmin wants to know. Email is a good form of communicating this...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; APPENDIX:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The following are small snippets from various configuration
&gt; &gt; files in my /etc
&gt; &gt; directory (it details the various syntaxes currently in use):
&gt;
&gt; It certainly would appear that all these files could be sensibly expressed
&gt; in a common format (say XML), and converted to the present formats by some
&gt; process (say a make command -- but then, shouldn't Makefiles also be in
&gt; XML... perhaps ant would be better)...
&gt;
&gt; However, you would lose quite a lot in doing so. Things like xf86config,
&gt; apache modules that configure themselves, existing configs, SWAT, and so
&gt; on. That said, I still think there's something in this, though I don't
&gt; think it's practical...
&gt;
&gt; I would think that if you wanted to do this, you'd be best off taking a
&gt; look at FreeBSD's config system. They use /etc/rc.conf and
&gt; /etc/defaults/rc.conf for all the basic config. They are sourced by the rc
&gt; script prior to execution, and set up a whole lot of variables, controlling
&gt; whether certain daemons start, and what options to give them.
&gt;
&gt; /etc/defaults/rc.conf has all the default settings, and many comments
&gt; explaining the meaning of everything. It is not intended to be edited.
&gt;
&gt; /etc/rc.conf has all the user-controlled settings.
&gt;
&gt; Whatever tool you had would need to parse the default file, get comments
&gt; and defaults, parse the user-controlled file, get the current settings, and
&gt; write to the user-controlled file. It would then need to generate the real
&gt; config file from the defaults and user settings. This reminds me of
&gt; something else...
&gt;
&gt; Anyone remember Linuxconf? It was supposed to do this, wasn't it? The most
&gt; frustrating thing that I recall about that (apart from the bugs) was the
&gt; way it would rewrite your config files every time you booted or changed
&gt; anything. You were restricted to making only the configuration changes that
&gt; it knew how to make, and you were restricted to making them through it, and
&gt; not editing the config files you know and love. As far as I can tell, it
&gt; seems to have vanished, and I have not missed it.
&gt;
&gt; Now that I've got my mental momentum, this also makes me think of webmin
&gt; (and cobalt and Qbalt, for that matter)... I wonder how closely they
&gt; approach this ideal of having a generic tool?
&gt;
&gt; Intriguing...
