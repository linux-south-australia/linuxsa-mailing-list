Hi ,
    regarding the fps and monitor refresh , I was at the time running the system with most options set to give the highest fps just to see what I could get out of it . I could get about 200 fps in the map sections that had medium level detail dropping to about 130 fps inthe highest detail I really only tested it in this mode to see what i could achieve . In normal use I would set the quality to achieve the best quality overall without any lags / hesitation in the higher detail areas . 

Regards 

Peter Osmond

&gt; &gt;            can anybody tell me the advantages / disadvantages 
&gt; &gt; upgrading from mandrake 9.0 to 9.1 . Is it worth the change I have 
&gt; &gt; at present a system with Mandrake 9.0 that is working well I have no
&gt; &gt; issues with it to speak of .
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from the security and bugfixes? I presume you keep your system
&gt; updated pretty regularly anyway.  If you don't, you're asking for
&gt; trouble.  Upgrading from 9.0 to 9.1 won't give you too much.  I like the
&gt; fresh install of MDK9.1 on my machine, but I've never done it as an
&gt; upgrade.  BTW, there's still about 200M of updates for 9.1 to download
&gt; after it's installed.  It's been around for a while now.
&gt; 
&gt; I would just run the mandrake upgrade program and upgrade to the latest
&gt; set of packages for MDK9.0.  That is probably the easier option, and
&gt; less likely to break something that works well.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since i have installed 9.0 I have installed Xine patches , MPlayer
&gt; &gt; and ogle for playing dvds , mpeg2 etc I had a few problems initially
&gt; &gt; with Xine , ogle and Mplayer the following were my solutions for
&gt; &gt; anybody that may have the same issues as I had
&gt; 
&gt; I much prefer MPlayer over the other players.  I think it's more robust,
&gt; and when it does fail it generally gives some sort of message saying why
&gt; it failed.  Kaboodle is quite good as well if you're willing to give
&gt; that a try.  Not as pretty as mplayer, but certainly nice to plug into
&gt; KDE, and it plays almost as many file types.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; With the nvidia driver installed i can get 200 fps in Q3 it is worth
&gt; &gt; the trouble installing this driver it also gives twinview
&gt; &gt; capability. A great program for setting up nvidia driver settings
&gt; &gt; is Yanc.
&gt; 
&gt; I could never get these FPS ratings for games.  What's the refresh rate
&gt; of your monitor set to? 85Hz, 75Hz, somewhere around there?  What is the
&gt; point of being able to render more frames in a second than you can
&gt; actually display?  
&gt; 
&gt; My view is that they should focus on achieving the highest video quality
&gt; at say 85FPS.  That is a much better test, isn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; Adam
