Well, I went home yesterday and took a look at the 
MySQL manual. Its too damn big (over 1,000 pages) and 
the damn thing doesn't make sense. But that is usual 
for a manual. There is too much crap to know and 
nothing seems to fit together. Its a bunch of 
technobabble as far as I am concerned. So I will have 
to figure it out on my own like everything else. That 
works a lot better for me.

Anyway, in wasting time trying to setup permissions for 
Knoda, I decided to install phpmyadmin hoping that 
would make things reasonably doable. My eye caught 
something called phprojekt available in SuSE Linux 8.2. 
So I decided to install it because it might actually 
work after all.

And it _did_.  :-) 

Here are the installation steps I took in SuSE Linux 8.2:

1. Clicked on the Green sphere with lightening in it at 
the bottom left of the desktop

2. Scrolled up to Administration

3. Selected Yast 2 (Control Center)

4. Supplied my root password

5. Clicked on Install and Remove Software

6. Searched for phprojekt, mysql, mysqlcc, 
mysql-client, mysql-max & mysql-shared

7. Checked off the box to install

8. Clicked on the accept button

9. I was told I had a dependency and it allowed me to 
choose Apache to resolve it

10. I cheked apache off

11. Clicked on continue

12. I inserted CD # 2 when it asked me to

13. Clicked ok

14. I inserted CD # 4 when it asked me to

15. Clicked ok

16. Went into the system section of the Yast 2 control center

17. Clicked on run level editor

18. Clicked on Run Level properties

19. Clicked on the apache line

20. Checked off 3 & 5

21. Clicked on the Start/Stop/Refresh button on the 
right and selected start

22. Clicked on finish

23. Opened up the shell console by clicking on the 
small blue screen with sea shell icon on the bottom 
left of the desktop

24. Typed this in the console:

chmod 777 /srv/www/htdocs/phprojekt/config.inc.php

25. I then opened my browser and pointed it to 
<A HREF="http://localhost/phprojekt/setup.php">http://localhost/phprojekt/setup.php</A>

26. It told me welcome to the setup of PHProject!

27. For hostname, I entered localhost, as is the 
default in SuSE, username is root, password is blank 
(mysql passowrd is blank in SuSE 8.2 by default) and 
name of existing database is test, the default in SuSE 
Linux 8.2.

28. It will say Seems that You have a valid database connection!

29. Leave defaults, enter your email address, and then 
click on go.

30. At the top of the next page, enter in a new root 
password to replace root. 

31. After configuring the last settings, it will tell 
you that a number of items were created and that 
LOGIN:root/root - test/test Finished!

32. It will ask you to Login by opening a browser and 
going to this address: 
<A HREF="http://localhost/phprojekt/index.php.">http://localhost/phprojekt/index.php.</A> If you accepted 
the defaults, the user name is root and the password is root.

That's where I am at....but in the sort time I was in the application, it looks promising
