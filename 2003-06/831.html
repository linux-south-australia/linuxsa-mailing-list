&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;

wheeze.

&gt; I hate to pour cold water over everyone, however you're not 
&gt; doing the recruiters a favour. They're doing you a favour. 
&gt; It's as simple as that!

I hate to dust everyone with flour after you've poured cold water on them,
but ... no-one's doing anyone any favours -- everyone's in it for personal
(or corporate) gain. The potential employee is merely the product that is
being sold to the potential employer. They package you up, brand you, and
present you in bite-sized chunks to potential employers. Realistically, they
are nothing but a barrier (put there in part by potential employers) that
comes between you and the potential employer. The fact that they not only
demand you have the appropriate skills for the job (which is sensible, and
some may say worthwhile), but they also demand that you express these skills
in their chosen format is a completely unneccessary barrier -- and one put
there simply through circumstance, not through their evil plans or anything.

Interestingly, I had an experience with a recruiter just today, whereby they
asked me for my PDF in .doc format, and I let out an involuntary sigh. They
then said I could send it unformatted, even plain text, and they would
format it like my PDF ("same fonts and all"), and send it back to me for
approval. This makes sense to me -- it's their barrier, the packaging into
.doc format is how they want to sell me, so they can jump their own hurdles.


She explained to me that she needs to edit it to remove contact details, and
she needs it in .doc format to enter it into the database (no doubt designed
by someone who couldn't forsee that some people don't use .doc...) ... She
seemed quite familar with people not having a .doc format resume, as I
suspect any recruiter involved in Unix recruiting should be (I would have
little respect for a recruiter if that concept was entirely new to them --
it would be evidence that they aren't familiar with the industry in which I
work....)

&gt; If you're NOT willing to submit the very first thing a 
&gt; recruiter wants in a format they are willing to understand 
&gt; then what does that say about you as a potential candidate?

likewise, if they aren't willing to work with me a little in getting me
through these artificial hurdles, what does that say about the likelyhood of
them understanding my employment needs? It works both ways...

&gt; And I'd DARE anyone to tell a recruiter that they're too lazy 
&gt; to cut and paste from word and that they're technically 
&gt; incomptent nincompoops...I wonder whether you'd get a job.

Why would anyone want to say that to them? For a start, it should be
patently obvious to them that they are technically incompetant (in fact, I
don't think I've ever met a recruiter who wouldn't make this claim about
themselves), but that this is entirely irrelevant to anything. It would be
tantamount to them saying to me that I don't know the first thing about the
recruitment industry...
