&gt;&gt;I installed FreeBSD 5, and...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;...I made it into KDE! :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I know, sounds pathetic.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But its pretty exciting for me, its my first day!
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And tomorrow you can install mutt!
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Looks pretty good, very logical installer.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Heh.  We've been talking about that for years.
&gt;
 
Its pretty close to perfect IMHO.  The only thing I would do is let the user choose all packages while in the screen to pick apps. But its probably there I just missed it.


&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Whoever offered me the advice to assume that the X configuration
&gt;&gt;worked although it said failed, that was the key for me.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hmm.  I didn't know about that.  Which version did you install?
&gt;  
&gt;
I bought the January 2003 CD set of four from Walnut Creek. The version 
said 5.0-RELEASE...I think. I will check again.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now I took the most conservative setting for X and I just want to
&gt;&gt;copy the Xf86config file I saved on a floppy to wherever it goes. I
&gt;&gt;think I will guess that /etc/fstab uses /dev/fd0...
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Depends on the release.  I think 4.8 still uses /dev/fd0c.
&gt;

Got that.

&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Ok, now I am going to log out and go in as root and edit fstab with
&gt;&gt;emacs. I have to add my floppy so I can copy over the xf86config
&gt;&gt;file from linux.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I tried to use su, but it says "sorry"
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You can log in directly as root without being in /etc/group
&gt;(obviously).
&gt;
Yeah I did that and its not such a big deal to do that vs sudo.

&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I also never realized that you have to start X before running
&gt;&gt;startkde.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You should have a .xinitrc file in your home directory.  The last line
&gt;should be 'startkde'.  For example, this is what I have in my .xinitrc
&gt;for KDE:
&gt;
&gt;   kbdcontrol &lt;/dev/ttyv0 -r fast		Set keyboard rate
&gt;   xset m 6 2					Set mouse rate
&gt;   xrdb -load .Xdefaults			Load defaults (if you have them)
&gt;   xmodmap .xremap				Map ctrl and alt keys as God intended
&gt;   startkde					Start KDE
&gt;
&gt;.xremap looks like this:
&gt;
&gt;   keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Meta_L
&gt;   remove Lock = Caps_Lock
&gt;   remove Control = Control_L
&gt;   remove Mod1 = Meta_L
&gt;   keysym Control_L = Meta_L
&gt;   keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
&gt;   add Mod1 = Meta_L
&gt;   add Control = Control_L
&gt;
&gt;It puts Ctrl next to A, Alt in the bottom left corner, and CapsLock to
&gt;the left of the space bar.  I believe there are more modern ways to do
&gt;this nowadays, but this has worked for me for 10 years, so I'm not
&gt;fixing it.
&gt;
Thanks a _billion_ I would never be able to figure that out in a million 
years.

Thank you, thank  you, thank you!
