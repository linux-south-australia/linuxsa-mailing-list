Hi David,

Strange that it worked once before & not now after upgrading.
Are you using the same XF86Config you used in MDK9 ?

First noticeable error in your XF86Config is that your ServerLayout
Screen's don't match the Screen Identifier names.

Line:		Screen "screen1" Rightof "Screen0"
Should read:	Screen "screen1" Rightof "screen0"

Spot the difference :)

Do both cards work ok by themselves ?

Apart from the typos in the ServerLayout section, everything looks ok in
your XF86Config, but I'd start experimenting with different 'server
layouts' at the end of the file.

Adding different layouts in there is a quick way to diagnose problems
via process of elimination.
eg. I have 4 server layouts in my XF86Config - 1 layout for each
individual card (2 in total), 1 for both cards with seperate desktops &
1 for xinerama.

Invoke with 'startx -- -layout &lt;insert_layout_identifier_here&gt;'

You mentioned that when things did almost work that they were showing up
on the wrong monitor.

Does changing your XF86Config like so get the desired effect ?

Instead of:
Section "ServerLayout"
     Identifier "layout1"
     InputDevice "Keyboard1" "CoreKeyboard"
     InputDevice "Mouse1" "CorePointer"
     Screen "screen0"
     Screen "screen1" Rightof "Screen0"
#    Option "Xinerama"
EndSection

Change to:
Section "ServerLayout"
     Identifier "layout1"
     InputDevice "Keyboard1" "CoreKeyboard"
     InputDevice "Mouse1" "CorePointer"
     Screen "screen1"
     Screen "screen0" Rightof "screen1"
#    Option "Xinerama"
EndSection

You could also try nvidia's official drivers from www.nvidia.com. Once
installed, the driver name should be changed from "nv" to "nvidia" (in
case you didn't already know) :)

I've attached a copy of my XF86Config for reference should you need one.

Kind regards,
Rick

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm having some issues with running multiple monitors on my machine. When I 
&gt; had Mandrake 9.0, using KDE 3.0 (can't recall exactly which version of 
&gt; XFree86 ... 4.something), it worked fine.
&gt; I've since upgraded to Mandrake 9.1 - from images taken from the 'Node mirror 
&gt; a couple of days ago.
&gt; Now I have KDE 3.1 and XFree86 4.3.0.. and a no longer working multiple 
&gt; monitor desktop.
&gt; 
&gt; What I have is:
&gt; 1x  Cirrus Logic 5446 generic PCI 1Mb card running at 640x480 as my primary 
&gt; display (for reasons related to Windoze which i dual boot once every blue 
&gt; moon), connected to a Samsung SyncMaster 500s. Bus ID is PCI:0:5:0. This 
&gt; screen only really handles email, and checking a couple of website designs at 
&gt; this resolution.
&gt; 
&gt; 1x nVidia GF4 MMX440SE AGP - 64Mb DDR running as a secondary at 1280x1024 as 
&gt; my secondary. This is connected to an LG Studioworks 700s.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem: I've had various problems depending on what I do to the 
&gt; XF86Config-4 file. At the moment the problem is that with both cards 
&gt; physically in the machine, KDE starts to load, but I get nothing but blank 
&gt; blue backgrounds on both screens, and nothing else happens.
&gt; If I take out the PCI card, KDE loads fine on my GF4, at the required 
&gt; resolution. Put the PCI card back, and the same problem occurs. 
&gt; I've spent some time playing around with this - and almost had it working - 
&gt; the displays were back the front (ie - the desktop for the primary monitor 
&gt; was showing on the secondary and vice versa, and the mouse pointer was stuck 
&gt; within the boundries of the secondary's screen). I went to change things 
&gt; around and then I get back to my hanging with two blue screens.
&gt; 
&gt; I've pasted a copy of XF86Config-4 below, so if anyone could point out exactly 
&gt; which bits I've got wrong, and tell me what they should be, it would be most 
&gt; appreciated. I've found a few other annoyances since the upgrade, but this 
&gt; one is a real pain. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; David
