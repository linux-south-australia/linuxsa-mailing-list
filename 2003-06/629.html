&gt;BUT...
&gt;
&gt;We shouldn't look this gift horse in the mouth because we 
&gt;think it could be proposed slightly differently.

I wasn't inferring that we shouldn't support the bill, just that
it's purpose seems a little misdirected.


&gt;I agree Open Standards(tm) are more important for this bill, 
&gt;yet M$ will argue that their XML file format is an open standard.  

Their XML file format which is yet to be supported by their own
Office suite, and then only in the Professional or above versions.
Joe Average will still be using .MSXML format with their copy of
Word at home so if his workplace has Office Pro he still doesn't
make full use of the "open" standard...sigh...here's hoping industry
sees through M$'s marketing hype...


&gt;IIRC, M$ got up at the NOIE OSS conference and said with a 
&gt;straight face that they were embracing open source.

Usual story, playing the game with a straight face and a crooked bat...


&gt;I urge you to support the bill, and anything like it.

Seconded...anyone for a motion acceptance?
