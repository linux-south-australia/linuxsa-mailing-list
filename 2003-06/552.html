Hi guys, here is the outline for the WFTD scheme finally documented for all to 
see. A web based version will be up today - url will be sent out.
Any volunteer eligible for WFTD, or anyone who knows someone who is, and who 
may be interested in joining our scheme, can contact me or David Lloyd 
(<A HREF="mailto:lloy007@adam.com.au">lloy007@adam.com.au</A>) to discuss further, and to be referred to the CWC 
(Community Work Coordinator).

Thanks, r:)

The purpose behind modularised implementation of the WFTD skill sets 
development provided by CAISA to WFTD participants is to :
1) allow for the staggered arrival of participants over the full period of the 
scheme.
2) to allow for differing exisiing experience and ability levels among 
participants  
The Advanced Modules are only to be completed upon satisfactory completion of 
all previous modules. However, at the discretion of the Supervisor, module 9 
(Actual Recipient Training) may NOT be deemed suitable, (as determined by 
performance in Communication Skills and Practice Recipient Training modules), 
and Advanced Modules may then be commenced.

Unless noted otherwise, the timeframe for each module is deemed to be as per 
participant abilities, and supervisor judgement of participant application 
and performance. The WFTD participant attends CAISA two days a week for 30 
weeks, the first week however is spent with the CWC on induction. SPecialised 
CAISA induction is the second week.

All participants will get a Certificate of Completion, listing the modules 
they have completed. 

COURSE OUTLINE:

Core Modules 

* Induction - (one day) discussing role of CAISA, outlining course and 
modules, and expectations of participants.
* Basic Computing Skills - (one day) an assessment of basic skillsets, 
including basic data entry, word processing, keyboard and mouse skills etc.
* Basic Linux - (mornings) basic Linux and Unix commands and concepts, 
including GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) & CLI (Command Line Interface) 
skills.
* Hardware - (afternoons) basic familiarity with hardware components of PCs, 
including peripherals, cards (video, network, sound, modem, SCSI), slots 
(ISA, PCI, AGP), ports (Comm, Parallel, Serial, SCSI), HDDs, Ram (EDO, Fast 
page, 32 Pin, 72 Pin, SDRAM), CDROMs etc. Stripping and rebuilding existing 
box. Building a box from scratch. (This box to become the Recipient Box they 
continue other modules with).
* Installs - Red Hat, Mandrake, and other GUI based installs. Debian and 
FreeBSD limited GUI/CLI based installs. Computerbank SA specialised install 
(to be completed on Recipient Box).
* Configuration  -  Computerbank based install for recipient requirements (to 
be completed on Recipient Box).
* Communication Skills - Basic communication skills, dealing with practice 
recipients, practice interviews and technical support situations.
* Practice Recipient Training - Using CAISA volunteers, training and setup of 
recipient boxes in various recipient requirements and roles (to be completed 
on Recipient Box).
* Administration Skills - Stocktake, paperwork, budgeting, scheduling, phone 
answering (dependent upon performance in Communication Skills), fund raising 
discussions.
* Actual Recipient Training - Dealing with actual recipients (starting with 
completed Recipient Box). Ongoing reinforcement of previous modules, for a 
number of recipients, from building, install, configuration, training, and 
ongoing support.

Advanced Modules

* Networking - Server setup, thin client situations, security (firewalls), web 
hosting, database serving, caching (SQUID), DHCP, DNS (BIND)
* Web Design - ongoing configuration, development and redevelopment of CAISA 
site, including content, imaging, scripting and interactivity skills
* Database Design - development and configuration of required & existing CAISA
