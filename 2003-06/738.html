&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I wish to have a public dummy spit. Grant me the pleasure of doing so on
&gt;this list.
&gt;
One can argue that requiring prospective employees to submit their 
resume's in troff format will weed out the less desireables.

&gt;
&gt;I have gone to considerable lengths to make my resume completely portable.
&gt;It's in PDF format, which, as I understand, is readable pretty much
&gt;anywhere, with either Free or free software. There is no cost, and very
&gt;little inconvenience, to anyone.
&gt;
&gt;Now it seems that half the recruitment agencies around the place seem to
&gt;want MS Word resumes. One, TMP/Hudson, even rejects online job applications
&gt;if your resume doesn't have a .doc (or .txt) extension. Yes, they have
&gt;indeed given me the option of .txt, but that would entail me reformatting it
&gt;extensively, and hence, losing much clarity. Another emailed me back, asking
&gt;for a copy in Word format so they could enter it into their database. As DSL
&gt;would say, "Confound!" ...
&gt;
&gt;What is to be done about this? I, for one, am irritated. I would like to do
&gt;something, but don't quite know what. I don't think there is a whole lot
&gt;that can be done, really. It's one of those situations where you either use
&gt;the .doc format, or you go with plain text (and even that gets rejected by
&gt;some), which is wholly unnacceptable. Perhaps HTML would be ok, but again, I
&gt;don't want to have to fuss about making it look right in HTML on multiple
&gt;browsers and in print, when PDF is perfect for that.
&gt;
&gt;Here endeth the spit. Management thanks you for your patience. Your resume
&gt;is important to us. Etc.
&gt;
