&gt; You have to know that he is no computer wizard and is not 
&gt; eager to spend too much time on it

This could be an issue. If he doesn't want to spend the time on it, I would
strongly suggest he doesn't try to do a half-arsed job himself, but employs
someone[1] to set it up right to begin with, and preferably, to maintain it
on an ongoing basis. This should not be too difficult for someone
experienced, and should not cost the earth, either. However, it will cost
something.

A few notes on what someone should do when setting up a new (new certainly
makes things easier) small-corporate network:

1) Make each PC as similar hardware-wise as possible, and implement a plan
to upgrade them regularly.
2) Try to set up a KickStart or similar (Debian has FAI --
<A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/</A> -- which I have heard is good) so
you can set up new PCs (replacement or additional, or re-blatting an old
one) trivially.
3) Make sure that no user data is stored on any PC (should be easy with NFS
-- also means you can have the smallest HDD available on the PCs)
4) DHCP as much as you can.
5) give each machine a nullclient sendmail (or whatever MTA) config, so all
mail, root or not, goes to the real server.
6) When building the server, give them enough disk space so you can have
online backups of old data -- there's a script floating around that will do
a cp -a followed by an rsync, which will quite efficiently create and
maintain a directory structure for the last few weeks' worth of user files.
Put these backups on a separate filesystem to /home, which depending on your
setup, wouldn't need to be redundant...
7) consult with users to make sure that the things that they need to do,
they can do. Then make the decisions for them. Do not, under any
circumstance, give them options of which desktop to use, which mail client,
or which office suite. Give them one way to do it.
8) document the setup for users -- remember that even the simple things are
new...
9) train the users -- this is how you use openoffice/koffice/abiword to do
write a letter. take questions, and anything you can't answer, build a
second training course for them so you can answer these questions (how do I
mailmerge, etc)...
10) don't oversell. It's not going to be a cure-all, it's not going to save
them millions of dollars, their computers will still crash and break down,
they still have to maintain them, they will still get hit by DoS attacks,
spam and virus emails, though they won't suffer as much as others, and most
importantly, nothing is simple just because the trainer or documenter says
"simply run ps -elf, select the correct PID, and kill -KILL that process",
or something similar (I once read a training manual where almost everything
was "simple"... It's a hobby horse of mine now.
