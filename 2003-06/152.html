SCO to Novell: See you in court

 SCO Group executives said Friday that the company's
 copyright dispute with Novell doesn't affect its legal
 campaign against Linux, but the issue may result in a
 lawsuit, anyway. 

 Darl McBride, chief executive of SCO, said the Linux dispute
 is based on contracts that IBM and numerous other companies
 signed with SCO in order to license the Unix operating
 system. Copyright issues raised by Novell, from which SCO
 bought the rights to Unix, are irrelevant, McBride said
 during a conference call with media and analysts. 

 "The copyright issues are not important to our current
 enforcement actions and anything happening in the
 marketplace," he said.

 But copyrights may figure in with subsequent enforcement
 actions, he said, so SCO is preparing to take Novell to
 court to settle those issues.

 "To the extent we want to deal with copyright issues down
 the road, we have our attorneys working on that," McBride
 said. "As far as claims Novell is making...we'll be settling
 those in court."

 &lt;snip&gt;

 Novell entered the fray this week, claiming that SCO's case
 is invalid, because Novell still holds key Unix copyrights
 and patents. "To Novell's knowledge, the 1995 agreement
 governing SCO's purchase of Unix from Novell does not convey
 to SCO the associated copyrights," Novell Chief Executive
 Jack Messman said in a letter to SCO.

 McBride characterized Novell's move as "a desperate measure
 to curry favor with the Linux community." He also questioned
 the timing of Novell's announcement, which was made the same
 day that SCO announced quarterly earnings.

 "Novell timed their announcement to coincide with our
 earnings release...to try and screw that up," McBride said.
