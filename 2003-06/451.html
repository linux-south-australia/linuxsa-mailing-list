&gt; &gt; I don't know if it has been tested since, however as I recall about
&gt; &gt; 2-3 (maybe longer) years ago when this came out, I contacted the
&gt; &gt; Trade Practices Commission (or whatever they call themselves now)
&gt; &gt; and asked if this was legal. According to them - it isn't,
&gt;
&gt; I doubt that.  Toshiba don't offer to sell, a computer; they offer a
&gt; computer with Windows.  You might just as well complain that Kellogs
&gt; won't sell Coco Pops without the cocoa.

For once I think you have it wrong.  :-)
Maybe the example was poorly chosen?   Point is that cocoa is an 
integral part of Coco Pops.  No cocoa, no Coco Pops.
The same cannot be said of Toshiba laptops.  The computer would still be 
a computer with or without an OS.

I think it was Dan Shearer who mentioned a while back that what Toshiba 
is doing is "third line forcing", ie you have agreed to purchase one 
product but are forced to purchase another product you might not want 
at the same time.  Third line forcing is an offence.

How much energy the ACCC would put into stopping this practice of 
Toshiba's, bearing in mind the minority effect, is the issue.
