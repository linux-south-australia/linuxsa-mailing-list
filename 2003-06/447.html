&gt; &gt; I don't know if it has been tested since, however as I recall about
&gt; &gt; 2-3 (maybe longer) years ago when this came out, I contacted the Trade
&gt; &gt; Practices Commission (or whatever they call themselves now) and asked
&gt; &gt; if this was legal. According to them - it isn't,
&gt;
&gt; I doubt that.  Toshiba don't offer to sell, a computer; they offer a
&gt; computer with Windows.  You might just as well complain that Kellogs
&gt; won't sell Coco Pops without the cocoa.

They are called Rice Bubbles ;-)

Anyway, a computer isn't terribly useful without an OS.  I can see
Microsoft's point of view by wanting to bundle an OS with the computer.  The
vast majority of buyers still want Windows with their computer, and not
providing any OS is an open invitation to piracy.  If you dispute this then
you haven't bought a 'white box' computer in the 90s, where it was very
common for the salesperson to ask "you have Windows at home, right?  *wink*"
to which the customer replied "why yes, *nudge* *nudge*".  $200 off the
price of a new PC.

The Linux community is going about this the wrong way.  We shouldn't be
fighting to unbundle Windows from the laptop, we should be suggesting they
bundle Linux with it instead.  The tightening of the EULAs has made the
first case very difficult to achieve.  What is Microsoft going to do?  Force
laptop makers to modify their EULAs stating that it's only legal to install
Windows on the machine?

Whether there is enough customer support for Linux/whatever else to be
installed instead of Windows is a different case altogether.

See ya
