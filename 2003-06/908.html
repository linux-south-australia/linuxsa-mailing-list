Hi all,

Anyone here used Coda or AFS in a production environment on Linux or
FreeBSD? Any experiences to share? Specifically, anyone got any experiences
with either filesystem and SaMBa (ie sharing a coda-mounted volume with
samba), Amanda (ie backing up a coda server with Amanda), network booting
(ie can I netboot with either fs? That would be more than handy), and RAID
(software or hardware)...

I've been reading the Coda doco, but I get the feeling that it's out of date
(dates in the late 90s are often mentioned). It also claims coda isn't yet
ready for large-scale deployment... It also seems to say that you can't
share a coda volume with samba, but I can't quite understand why (and I
can't find where I read that...) -- I can understand why you couldn't share
the underlying data, but what about sharing a coda-mounted volume -- even if
it's mounted on the same server? ie use samba to share /coda/home or
something...

I was also thinking that Coda could be a sensible option instead of RAID --
if you could use Coda to maintain multiple separate servers, with the same
data replicated on each, perhaps the individual servers wouldn't need to be
reliable? eg: just have three machines, each with a couple of striped 200Gb
drives, running coda, and coda clients accessing this group of servers could
handle a server dying -- could also help with load balancing, unless coda
sends all requests to a default server...

Hmm... the possibilities are endless...
