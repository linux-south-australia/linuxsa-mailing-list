Hey,

Just thought I'd share my experience with getting ipcop (www.ipcop.org) to 
work. Ipcop is a firewall distribution and basically makes an old computer 
into a "firewall appliance". It is based on smoothwall 0.9.9, but it is very 
up to date (kernel 2.4.20).

Once I had fixed some hardware problems with the computer I was using (Free 
pentium 200MMX! :) - However, primary IDE and Secondary Serial Port don't 
work), installing ipcop was dead simple.

I did an ftp installation (you need 2 floppies for this), write the two images 
in the images/ directory of the ipcop ISO to 2 floppies (one is boot, one is 
drivers). You can use dd to do this.

Install an ftp server. I installed proftpd in Mandrake 9.1 (just search for 
protfpd in the package manager and choose proftpd and proftpd-anonymous). 
Copy the ipcop.tgz file from the ipcop ISO to /var/ftp (or /var/ftp/pub). 

Follow the instructions in the ipcop manual for an ftp installation, it 
downloads the ipcop.tgz file and installs ipcop. Configuring a dial up 
account is done once ipcop is installed and up and running (done through the 
web interface).

I can't believe how dead simple it was to do all this stuff. Anyway, I highly 
recommend ipcop to anyone who wants a firewall distribution (only a 22MB 
download). I would suggest installing it on a Pentium class machine with at 
least 32MB of RAM. Smoothwall is probably lighter on resources, and of course 
freesco can run on a lowly 8MB 486 (and comes on 1 floppy!).

Cheers,

Damien
