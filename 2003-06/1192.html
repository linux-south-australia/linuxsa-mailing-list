 Ok, granted this is off-topic but with the very recent news
 of Romana greeting the early arrival of young Chris I thought
 it might be of interest.

 I say good on her, that shows real guts. Seriously, that
 wasn't a poor attempt at punning. Too many mothers are
 'taught' by peer pressure to shut themselves away when
 pregnant. To wear anonymous clothing such as shifts and
 caftans so they can in some way not invite the anger of the
 populace by being obviously pregnant and out in public.
 Being pregnant in public is somehow seen as selfish and
 indulgent.

 To do this while also competing in a run - taking part in a
 normal real life experience - that take great dedication to
 her sport as well as a thick skin to protect her from the
 barbs thrown by an intolerant few.

 The exercise would be great for mum and kid and so long as
 she took care and safe as long as she didn't over exert
 herself. I think she deserves a medal even if she didn't win
 the race.

 I think *most* mother's deserve a medal for all they go through
 to bring new life into this world. 

 &lt;Rant&gt;
 I don't include some of the baby machines that I know of who are
 only doing it for the money and freedom from being forced to
 look for work. 
 &lt;/Rant&gt;

 Cheers,  Ian
