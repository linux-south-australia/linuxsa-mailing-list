<H1>Geek Boot camp</H1>

I have decided to wake up this mailing list with a suggestion for a"Geek
Boot Camp". 

Basically, It would be an intensive weekend to allow people to learn
about PHP, Apache, kernel compiles (regardless of OS), BSD, Linux etc.

It probably should be residential so if you are wanting to continue into
the evening... or morning.. (say waiting for a compile to finish or
just not wanting to give up on something) you may. The group would need
to be kept small say 20-30 people. It get a lot harder with a larger
group as far as power and security goes.

I was thinking of a Long weekend. Organisers arrive Friday Evening and
start setting up, Everyone else start to arrive arrive Sat morning or
later. Option to stay over night. Depart Monday Lunch to allow plenty
of time to pack and tidy up. 

Infrastructure: The Attendees would be responsible for bringing their
own machines. The only thing that will be provided will be the
networking (I have access to a 24 port 10/100 Switch. Might be able to
bring a wireless access point.)

Location: I'm thinking it should be in the Adelaide Hills to give
attendees a weekend away from the City. But close enough for them to be
in town in 30 minutes.

Anyway it is only an idea at this stage. It got a tentative thumbs up
from the few people that I spoke to over the last few days.

[Side thought: Hmmm..... Could subsequent camps be called "Geek Re-Boot
Camp". Otherwise you come up with a better term for it.]

Regards

George Patterson
