&gt; | Hello
&gt; |
&gt; | I have just downloaded Cygwin linux and do not know enough about linux
&gt; | to commence using it.
&gt; |
&gt; | I am a pensioner and at present use a pentium 2 compatible and because
&gt; | of the imminent cessation of support for windows 98 se I cannot
&gt; | contemplate purchasing another windows os
&gt; | I seek help to enable me to understand cygwin linux whichI chose 
&gt; to look | at because I could download this onto my windows desktop 
&gt; to evaluate | Linux for my future use. | | regards | Alf Tabor

I'll suggest this person is incredibly confused.

Cygwin isn't Linux.  It's made by Redhat AFAIK (or at least, the company
Redhat bought out), but that doesn't mean much (Caldera don't just do Linux,
for example).

Cygwin provides an POSIX compatiblity layer under Windows to essentially give
you a whole suite (bash, gcc, etc) that lets you compile many unix/linux
applications natively, often needing a bit of hacking to get things to work
(although many popular GPL applications already have cygwin support, so
they'll compile straight out the box).  It's damn handy, because it allows
many programs previously not available on Windows to be ported over very
painlessly.  Ethereal, for example, is compiled on Windows using cygwin, along
with winpcap(?), and the gtk+ toolset.

You need to know what you're doing to make cygwin of any use, so I'm guessing
this person is right down the wrong path.  If they insist on trialling Linux
without modifying their Windows install, give them a knoppix CD, or if they
haven't got enough ram, there's things like DragonLinux/WinLinux out there
that run from a Windows partition.  Note, I believe both are horribly out of
date, and pretty farkin horrible, so it's not really a good look at Linux.
