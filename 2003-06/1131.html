&gt; Thanks for your comments. I have skimmed through the most recent LSB
&gt; specification (I don't have download access so I can't do any
&gt; research atm), and it doesn't seem to specify all that much, perhaps
&gt; I should look at it again. If they are indeed packaging software for
&gt; an LSB reference implementation, then this is basically *exactly*
&gt; what I want. I would love if you could go to the website of a
&gt; project and download "app-3.2-lsb.i586.rpm" and have it *just work*
&gt; without farting around with compatibility problems.

Have a look around on the LSB website for the "Application battery".
Its a set of applications which are used to test the LSB compliance of
distributions. They also serve as an example of how to build LSB
compliant applications. Its not intended to be a repository of LSB
compliant software, though we are trying to encourage projects to
release LSB compliant versions of their software.

&gt; If there was an LSB package of juk, I wouldn't want it to depend on
&gt; LSB's version of KDE, I would want it to depend on the version of
&gt; KDE that I have installed, be it installed from a Mandrake package
&gt; or from some other source.

With a couple of exceptions, the only dependency an LSB compliant
application should have is on "lsb" (most likely a specific version of
the LSB) which is provided by the distribution.

Note that things like KDE aren't yet standardised in the LSB. They're
probably not stable enough yet - standardisation requires that
developers be willing to commit to keeping *binary* compatability
between releases which is not easy to do. It will get there
eventually, and the desktop and futures group are looking at support
libraries like gtk and qt, but there is a lot of work to do - eg a
specification and test suites must written for all of the ABIs.
