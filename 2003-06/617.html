&gt;A good approach could be to talk about jobs in the IT sector 
&gt;-- the Open Source option will create jobs here supporting it, rather than 
&gt;giving money to investors and employees of MS overseas...

Sorry, had to ROFL at this one, strangely enough, economic development
was the reason why the SA government signed a 7 year contract with
a certain international IT company....where has that left us? :)

Seriously though, I think this type of approach is sound, particularly
in the current climate of contract review (above contract finishes next
year).  The decision makers are more likely to listen to that type of
approach given the disastrous nature of their past choices.

Also, as you pointed out, an "Open Source option" should be the way it
is implemented, it shouldn't be mandated as first choice just for the
sake of it being open source.  Standards, standards, standards, then 
make sure whatever platform you choose complies with them, thus ensuring
that the platform choice you make today doesn't preclude you from 
changing that platform tomorrow if business needs require you to do so.
