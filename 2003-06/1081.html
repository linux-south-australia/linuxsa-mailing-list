<H1>Webmin updates & shell based SuSE update/UUCP to deploy RPM's</H1>

Well today I set up an internet that has links to all of the web based 
administrative stuff in the office.  I also included a webmin link for 
each desk. (Yes I have Linux on the desktop in a dual boot situation, 
and I want to respond to that email, but the weekend is best for 
that....) Anyway, Webmin allows you to execute shell comands,  so I 
tested it out by running "antivir --update" for each desk, from my desk 
using Webmin. It worked nicely....so I thought to myself, wouldn't it be 
nice to have a shell based version of SuSE's online update...

Well, here it is: :-)    <A HREF="http://fou4s.gaugusch.at/">http://fou4s.gaugusch.at/</A>

I tested it and it seemed to work fine. I want to update all of my desks 
that way. Now that I can do this, I am getting spoiled and lazy.  :-)  I 
want to know if I can deliver RPM's for installation via script 
remotely. I know about apt for rpm, but sometimes the RPM's just don't 
install right due to number versioning conflicts.  Plus I don't think 
that fou4s is in apt.

I was thinking UUCP would be a good way to deploy the RPM's and then use 
Webmin's shell script to administrate things from here.  I also could 
set up VNC, but I don't want to start feeling instrusive.
Anyway, I have only read a little about it in a very good, book that I 
have. I have no practical experience with its use.  Grog's book might 
have something in there, it seems to have a lot of bank for the buck as 
well as some concepts that I am ready to learn.

And I'm spent.

James Leone
