All the systems that we use at university request your username and 
password, then click "ok" in order to access any sites that are outside the 
"unisa.edu.au" domain. When you close the last browser, it ends your session 
of browsing. If you open ie again after that, you will need to log on again. 

Is it really that hard to click an ok button? It's not as if they are going 
to get rsi or anything from 1 extra mouse-click every now and again. 

Maybe you should focus on more important things, and tell your rather picky 
users to just live with it. As I said, it is only one button!

&gt;&gt;I've got a squid box that is doing auth against a Winnt server 
&gt;&gt;which works
&gt;&gt;fine as we are on DHCP. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But, several users are complaining (as they do) that it's too 
&gt;&gt;hard to hit an
&gt;&gt;OK box before surfing out.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh dear how sad.  Our users got the hang of it after a while, also
&gt; authenticating off an NT box. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;My question is has anyone sucessfully got some kind of user 
&gt;&gt;accounting on squid without having to actually log in every time. or at 
&gt;&gt;least having IE completely cache the password so you don't need to press
&gt; the 
&gt;&gt;old OK button every time you open your browser. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;for example i *think* (from memory, don't shoot me down in 
&gt;&gt;flames) that if a M$not web proxy is setup for auth it goes though without
&gt; any 
&gt;&gt;troubles and i don't think it even asks for the uname/pword. like i said
&gt; *think*. :) 
&gt; 
&gt; You could set it up as a transparent proxy, although it would need some
&gt; rules added to your firewall/router to redirect all web traffic through
&gt; your proxy.  The disadvantage to doing it this way is that your accounting
&gt; will only show IP addresses not usernames, so it's a little difficult to
&gt; pin net abuse on an individual as they can just say that Fred Bloggs was
&gt; using their PC then.  You'll have the same issue if you do it by machine
&gt; name.   
&gt; 
&gt; I guess it comes back to why you are using a proxy in the first place,
&gt; if its purely as a caching/traffic saving feature, then why bother with
&gt; user authentication at all.  If it's for logging/reports for management
&gt; then you need user authentication and poor old userland will just have
&gt; to be content with clicking an OK button when they surf the web.
