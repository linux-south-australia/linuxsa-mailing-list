&gt;&gt; Hi Richard (replying to my own post :)
&gt;
&gt; Me again,
&gt;
&gt; Further to the comparison, there are a few other major differences
&gt; that I didn't mention -- focussing on "Linux" vs "FreeBSD" rather
&gt; than "gentoo" vs "FreeBSD".
&gt;
&gt; Both appear to have a stateful firewall, though I am not familiar
&gt; enough with freebsd's ipf and ipfw to be sure quite how to use them,
&gt; or what the difference between them actually is. Certainly, on
&gt; initial inspection, they appear equivalent to iptables in
&gt; functionality. If anyone has found a decent comparison, I'd be keen
&gt; to see it.

I run both ipfw and iptables on my network.  ipfw is on the PPP
gateway (echunga), and iptables is on the satellite receiver box
(sat-gw).  The satellite card has only a Linux driver (in binary
form), so I can't run FreeBSD on it.  echunga runs 4.7-STABLE, and
sat-gw runs Red Hat 7.0 (I think) with a 2.4.16 kernel.

I don't know what the problem is--could be the driver--but sat-gw
hangs itself up every month or so.  I've asked Rusty if there's
any known problem of that nature with iptables, and he says that he
doesn't know of any.

Comparing the syntax, I think that ipfw is simpler.  The rule sets on
each system are similar.  Here are some of the ipfw rules on echunga:

	# This stuff really belongs in rc.config
	net=192.109.197.0/24
	ppplink=139.130.136.138
	mask=255.255.255.0
	ip=192.197.109.137
	oif=ppp0

	# Stop RFC1918 nets on the outside interface
	${fwcmd} add deny all from any to 10.0.0.0/8 via ${oif}
	${fwcmd} add deny all from any to 172.16.0.0/12 via ${oif}
	${fwcmd} add deny all from any to 192.168.0.0/16 via ${oif}

	# Allow TCP through if setup succeeded
	${fwcmd} add allow tcp from any to any established

	# Allow outbound UDP
	${fwcmd} add allow udp from ${net} to any
	${fwcmd} add allow udp from ${ppplink} to any

	# Allow ICMP in and out
	${fwcmd} add allow icmp from any to any

Here are the corresponding iptables rules:

# This stuff really belongs in rc.config
net=192.109.197.0/24
ppplink=139.130.136.138
mask=255.255.255.0
ip=192.197.109.137
oif=sm200d
fwcmd=iptables

# flush current rules

${fwcmd} -F INPUT
${fwcmd} -F FORWARD

# Stop RFC1918 nets on the outside interface

${fwcmd} -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK ACK
${fwcmd} -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST
${fwcmd} -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST

# Allow outbound UDP
${fwcmd} -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p udp -s ${net}
${fwcmd} -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p udp -s ${net}
${fwcmd} -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p udp -s ${ppplink}
${fwcmd} -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p udp -s ${ppplink}

# Allow ICMP in and out
${fwcmd} -A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p icmp
${fwcmd} -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p icmp

The most obvious difference is that you have two separate chains in
iptables.  This isn't necessarily a bad idea, but it makes the file
twice as long.  In addition, the TCP rules for iptables are much more
difficult to specify and require an understanding of the protocol.
I'm not even sure if I have it right!

&gt; Linux has better FS support -- or rather, more options.

Yes, more options :-)

&gt; It has a journalling filesystem (or three -- ext3, reiserfs, XFS,
&gt; with JFS to come, as I understand). FreeBSD has ufs with Soft
&gt; Updates, which, as far as I can tell, appears to provide pretty much
&gt; the same sort of bonuses anyway.

It's also renowned for its stability.  This is probably one of the
reasons why nobody had written anything else for BSD.

&gt; SMP is rumoured to be more mature and faster under Linux, though
&gt; this doesn't matter much to me anyway. I understand that FreeBSD 5.0
&gt; brings major improvements, though I don't know if that means it's
&gt; equal to Linux.

My guess (as one of the authors of the new FreeBSD SMP code) is that
Linux is still ahead in this area.  But I don't think it's very far
ahead, and we're relatively happy with the FreeBSD code now.

&gt; Software-wise, there is little to choose between them. They both
&gt; have vast amounts of software, most of which will compile natively
&gt; under either. FreeBSD also has a Linux emulation layer, which
&gt; enables it to run Linux binaries if need be -- and I understand it
&gt; does this with no performance penalty.

Correct.  Some people claim--without substantiation--that FreeBSD can
sometimes run Linux binaries faster than on a Linux box.  That's at
least theoretically possible.

&gt; Commercial software probably enjoys more support under Linux, but I
&gt; doubt that gentoo would be considered supported by most vendors.

Again, most of it runs on FreeBSD.

&gt; FreeBSD's console doesn't have the ability to scroll, at least, it's
&gt; not set up to do so by default.

Yes, it does, and it's set up by default.  For reasons lost in the
mists of antiquity, you need to press the ScrollLock key to enable it.

&gt; The FreeBSD MBR is particularly simple, and I haven't yet found any
&gt; place to configure it.

/boot/loader.conf.

&gt; Both have a devfs system.

With very different semantics.

&gt; FreeBSD names devices after their drivers -- eg fxp0 is the first Intel
&gt; EtherExpress Pro 10/100 device, whereas rl0 is the first Realtek
&gt; 8129/8139 device. 

In fact, so does Linux, but Linux then maps the devices to specific
names, and that's what you normally see.

&gt; I'll have more to say about my FreeBSD experiences as I familiarise
&gt; myself with it further. For now, I have come accross an odd situation
&gt; where some of my installed ports appear to be more recent than those in
&gt; the ports collection.
&gt;
&gt; Some of my unanswered questions (about both gentoo and FreeBSD, but
&gt; focussing on FreeBSD at present) are:
&gt;
&gt; * Practically speaking, how well does the FreeBSD cvsup and ports system
&gt; work?

cvsup: very well.  Ports Collection: OK.

&gt; How much attention does it need to keep up to date?

cvsup: I have a daily cron job which updates my repository and one of
the source trees.  Ports Collection: use portupgrade, which
occasionally causes some surprises.  If I can believe the Debian
people I know, Debian does it better.  My own experiences with Debian
have been pretty harrowing, though.

&gt; * Is there a way to make a canonical list of ports to have
&gt; installed, and uninstall anything that isn't on that list or a
&gt; dependency of something.  Something like Debian's debfoster.

There's nothing standard, but it should be trivial to implement.
Basically you just need a Makefile with something like:

  PORTS = editors/emacs mail/mutt shells/bash2 mail/postfix

  all:
	for i in ${PORTS}; do \
		(cd /usr/ports/$$i; make install); \
	done

&gt; * Assuming I had a machine to test the process on first, how easy would it
&gt; be to automate the process of updating everything on a number of machines
&gt; at once (perhaps using my own repository mirror, so as to maintain a
&gt; consistent state to update to).

Depends on what you mean by "everything".  I have my source trees on
one machine (echunga) and they're NFS mounted on the others.  If
you're keeping them in sync, you just need to build and install on
one, then install on the others.

&gt; * Can I create a package that consists of little more than config files
&gt; and dependencies (whether as normal dependencies, or a canonical list as
&gt; described above), and install that on a machine, and have the automated
&gt; update process respect that?

That's a little vague to give an unqualified "yes" answer to.  The
question should be more like: "I have this little list.  How do I get
it to run an automated update".  The answer would depend on the
contents of the list, of course.

&gt; If it sounds like I have some more specific goals in mind, that's
&gt; because I have... :)

Might I remind you that most of the people who can answer these
questions are on BUGA?  See
