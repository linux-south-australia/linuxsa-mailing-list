You have exams soon as well? Good luck with them, I have my CIT and Java 
exams in about three weeks as well... Sometimes you have to hate computers! 
Thankyou for your fine analysis of the situation. It was a bit hard on him, 
but he came through it alright, and still teaches swimming. After thinking 
about it, he has decided that he would happily do it again. 

Cya later...

&gt; IANAL - but i am a law student - and we are studying this type of thing atm - 
&gt; so hopefully i have some idea! - and yeah, i know its kinda strange, a geek 
&gt; doing law, but hey, there needs to be more guys like us in the profession!!! 
&gt; 
&gt; In your case, the insurance of your friends swimming centre covered the bill, 
&gt; so it would have to have been decided that your friend was acting as an 
&gt; employee of the swimming centre when he saved that guy.  
&gt; 
&gt; Along this line, he was hence being paid to save that guy by the swimming 
&gt; centre (as he was acting under employment), and hence he wasn't a good 
&gt; samaritan and hence he couldnt rely on the defence of being a good samaritan. 
&gt; 
&gt; This seems a little weird, as he wasnt acting under any instructions from the 
&gt; swimming centre to save the guy or anyone else for that matter, but from what 
&gt; i've been learning, this doesnt have to be the case. He was employed as a 
&gt; life saver, hence it would be reasonable to say that any act of 
&gt; 'life-saving', whether at the swimming centre or not, was an act done under 
&gt; employment. 
&gt; 
&gt; This would explain why the good samaritan act didnt apply. About whether your 
&gt; friend should have been liable (through the swimming centre) is a totally 
&gt; different matter - and clearly the court decided (whether correctly or not) 
&gt; that this was the case. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is interesting to think that if at the time your friend wasnt employed by 
&gt; the swimming centre, then there might well have been no liability at all as 
&gt; the good samaritan act would have applied. 
&gt; 
&gt; n e way - thanks for making me think about this, i got an exam on all this 
&gt; stuff in 2 weeks, so i gota start learning it!!!

&gt;&gt; I was under the impression that "Good Samaritan" laws covered this
&gt;&gt; loophole. Because we all remember the issue of a doctor making the choice
&gt;&gt; to save or not save a person hit by a car.. if they are left to die then
&gt;&gt; they can be sued (be relatives i guess), if the are "mostly" saved (like
&gt;&gt; this swimming person you told about), they may also be able to sue... 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What is one to do...? 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; AG. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; I know the trends in this day and age, but I really hate,
&gt;&gt; &gt; detest and loathe
&gt;&gt; &gt; how people, out of the goodness of their hearts can go to the
&gt;&gt; &gt; trouble to
&gt;&gt; &gt; organise a cool event (as cool as this as going to be!) only
&gt;&gt; &gt; to have it
&gt;&gt; &gt; devastated by someone who would sue! sue! sue! It really is
&gt;&gt; &gt; amazing how many
&gt;&gt; &gt; people would do this to the closest of friends. You see it on
&gt;&gt; &gt; TV all the
&gt;&gt; &gt; time.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; A friend of mine and I have always been interested and involved in
&gt;&gt; &gt; lifesaving. We have the relevant awards, qualifications, etc.
&gt;&gt; &gt; He lives over
&gt;&gt; &gt; in Queensland now. One time, he was at the beach, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; attempted a rescue on
&gt;&gt; &gt; a man who had got into trouble after jumping off a jetty. If
&gt;&gt; &gt; he hadn't
&gt;&gt; &gt; rescued him, the man would have died. However, the man had
&gt;&gt; &gt; sustained spinal
&gt;&gt; &gt; injuries from his jump, and these were aggravated by my
&gt;&gt; &gt; friend's rescue, and
&gt;&gt; &gt; the man lost his ability to walk. It was later proved that
&gt;&gt; &gt; had the man been
&gt;&gt; &gt; left, he would have drowned, but also would have retained his
&gt;&gt; &gt; ability to
&gt;&gt; &gt; walk. The original spinal injury was his fault, for jumping
&gt;&gt; &gt; into shallow
&gt;&gt; &gt; water from a jetty. With this behind him, he successfully
&gt;&gt; &gt; sued my friend for
&gt;&gt; &gt; some exorbetent amount. Fortunately, at the time, we were
&gt;&gt; &gt; both teaching at
&gt;&gt; &gt; swimming centres, and the insurance was still active. But
&gt;&gt; &gt; which would you
&gt;&gt; &gt; prefer? Dying and being able to walk or living and being
&gt;&gt; &gt; unable to walk?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; It often puts alot of people off even considering organising
&gt;&gt; &gt; something. Why
&gt;&gt; &gt; can't people just appreciate what they get given?!? At least
&gt;&gt; &gt; the licences on
&gt;&gt; &gt; relevant software provide a little bit of a safe-haven for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the programmers
&gt;&gt; &gt; using them with their programs in the areas of warranty, etc.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; If people do things that are their own fault, like jump off
&gt;&gt; &gt; jetties into
&gt;&gt; &gt; water shallower than their own height or stick their fingers in power
&gt;&gt; &gt; outlets and get electrocuted, why should the person who comes
&gt;&gt; &gt; to their aid,
&gt;&gt; &gt; or the owner of the power outlet be penalised for someone
&gt;&gt; &gt; else's stupid
&gt;&gt; &gt; action?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry about all this, people. I just feel particularly
&gt;&gt; &gt; strongly about this,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and combining that with just waking up, I really needed to
&gt;&gt; &gt; air my opinion on
&gt;&gt; &gt; the matter. I hope it is relevant to some of you.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Speak to you all soon, and as always, I love listening to the
&gt;&gt; &gt; interesting
&gt;&gt; &gt; conversation that passes back and foward through this mailing list.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Especially in the early hours of the morning... Should this
&gt;&gt; &gt; boot camp go
&gt;&gt; &gt; ahead, I will be there as quickly as I can pedal my bike! I
&gt;&gt; &gt; would greatly
&gt;&gt; &gt; enjoy such an event.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; David,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Is this a sleep over? Will dormitories/other sleeping
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; arrangements be
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; required? Food? Drinks? Will you allow alcohol (it sounds
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; like a good
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Alcohol, a few beers by the barby/laptop would be the go i'd say.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; idea until someone drops a jug of beer on George's new
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; laptop? Do you
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Get insurance - its worth it - believe me :)
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; need money sponsors? What happens if I get electrocuted at
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; the party?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
