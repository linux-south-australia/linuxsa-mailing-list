&gt; that the problem with limited uptime reporting periods related to 
&gt; "jiffies" (whatever they are) and also to the fact that
&gt;   2^32 / (100*60*60*24) = 497.1026962962
&gt; 
&gt; My dumb question is, "is this a product of using a 32 bit operating 
&gt; system, and will this uptime reporting limit change if I'm using a 64 
&gt; bit operating system, specifically linux on Alpha ?"


David,

In the 2.4.20 kernel file kernel/timer.c, there's this:

unsigned long volatile jiffies;

So it's architecture-dependent.
("jiffies" is, of course, the count of system timer interrupts since boot time.
So the max uptime is 2^N/(HZ*60*60*24) days, where N is sizeof(unsigned long)*8
and HZ is the number of system interrupts per second.)

If you do this:

    egrep "long.* u64" include/*/types.h 

in the top kernel directory, you get lines such as this:

include/asm-alpha/types.h:typedef unsigned long u64;
include/asm-arm/types.h:typedef unsigned long long u64;
include/asm-i386/types.h:typedef unsigned long long u64;
include/asm-m68k/types.h:typedef unsigned long long u64;
include/asm-ppc/types.h:typedef unsigned long long u64;
include/asm-ppc64/types.h:typedef unsigned long u64;
include/asm-sparc/types.h:typedef unsigned long long u64;
include/asm-sparc64/types.h:typedef unsigned long u64;

So it looks like the alpha, ppc64 and sparc64 use 64-bit jiffies,
whereas the others in the above list have 32-bit jiffies.

Using "jiffies" for uptime calculations is obviously wrong, and really shows
a lack of faith in the ability of linux to stay up for 500 days.
On the other hand, 32-bit time has to become extinct between now and 2038
so as to avoid the Y2k38 bug. So we just have to put up with this jiffies
constraint until our current PCs go down to the museum.

Actually, on that subject, I've been thinking about pyramids lately, and
the fact that archaeologists of the future will be looking around for evidence
of civilisation in the 20th/21st centuries. So maybe we should lobby the
state govt to build a huge pyramid out at Monarto and fill it completely
with old computer gear inside. This would be something to put us on the
map like the Sydney Opera House, and would be gratefully received by
archaeologists of the future. Too bad that all the data will be gone!

Anyway, in principle the 64-bit architectures should give correct uptime
reports if the "uptime" program is written properly.
Maybe someone with a 64-bit linux machine could tell you...

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
