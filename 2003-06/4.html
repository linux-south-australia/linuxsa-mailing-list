&gt; Hi all,

Hi Richard (replying to my own post :)

&gt; Anyone consider themselves a regular user of both FreeBSD and 
&gt; gentoo? Care to compare? (I've become disillusioned with 
&gt; debian for the last time, and will move away from it if I can 
&gt; find the right OS to move to)

OK, after all the chatter about everything but gentoo and freebsd, I've
had a very short introduction to gentoo from a listmember, and have
installed FreeBSD 5.0 on my laptop to play with. I've also browsed
online stuff, including this
(<A HREF="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/4/202113/7370">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/4/202113/7370</A>) kuro5hin story on
gentoo. 

Here's something of a superficial comparison, focussing on *my* needs
and desires (which means that any conclusions I draw don't neccessarily
apply to anyone else):

Gentoo is (obviously) Linux, whereas FreeBSD is not, which means obvious
(though not neccessarily significant) differences in hardware support
and familiarity (I'm more fluent in Linux than BSD), as well as the
marketing edge that "Linux" has with clients. However, hardware support
is slightly less of an issue for me than for some, because server-type
hardware is usually well-supported under both -- also, Linux tends to
have a very large selection of supported hardware, but is somewhat
inconsistent on how well they are supported, whereas FreeBSD is
narrower, but perhaps more consistent.

Gentoo's portage and FreeBSD's ports are pretty similar. They both let
you do one simple command to download, compile and install software and
dependencies. It would appear that portage is a little better than ports
at doing upgrades -- ports has portupgrade, which does the job, but some
wouldn't trust it. Portage appears to be designed from the ground up to
incorporate that functionality into the "emerge" system.

Also, gentoo puts EVERYTHING in portage, whereas FreeBSD has the base
system (the "FreeBSD" part) separate to the ports. The gentoo way means
that you get more choices, whereas the FreeBSD way means more stability
(IMHO). It seems that FreeBSD includes things like sendmail in the base
system, which is something that irritated me with Debian (though Debian
installs exim by default). I want to choose my own MTA. Likewise with
things like bind... (why IS that -- it seems somewhat arbitrary that
these things should be included in FreeBSD's or Debian's base
repository?)... Also, portage is based on python, whereas ports is based
on make, sh and friends. Personally, I don't know python, and have no
desire to familiarise myself with it. Ports has a longer history, which
gives it perhaps more stability, and more ports, whereas portage is
newer, which gives it perhaps a more flexible, powerful architecture, at
the cost of being less proven.

Gentoo results in a much simpler system than most Linux distros. The
only "stuff" there is what you've installed. FreeBSD is similar, but
includes more in the base. In both cases, you aren't likely to end up
with a bloated OS. Also, given the from-source nature of both systems,
both are fast, as they are compiled for the right cpu, with
optimisations as selected.

Both have a simpler init system than most Linuxes. Gentoo's is based on
python (which is a negative as far as I am concerned), and is pretty
much designed from scratch. FreeBSD's is more conventional, but still
has dependencies and is quite simple (though there are a few different
places to look, rather than the single /etc/init.d I am used to).

Overall, Gentoo appears almost to be the FreeBSD you would design if you
were starting from scratch, basing it on Linux, and aiming for
flexibility over stability and consistency (not that you ignore those
two, but priorities are different). FreeBSD has the benefit of being
tried and proven over a long period of time, and being focussed on being
stable and consistent.

Personally, now that I have FreeBSD installed on my laptop, I'm going to
play with it for a while longer, and if it suits me enough, then I will
go with it (the reputation for stability means a lot), if not, I'll
cautiously try gentoo.

Cheers
