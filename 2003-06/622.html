Quoting "Freeman, Peter (ERHS)" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Freeman.Peter@saugov.sa.gov.au">Freeman.Peter@saugov.sa.gov.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; Also, as you pointed out, an "Open Source option" should be the way it
&gt; is implemented, it shouldn't be mandated as first choice just for the
&gt; sake of it being open source.  Standards, standards, standards, then 
&gt; make sure whatever platform you choose complies with them, thus ensuring
&gt; that the platform choice you make today doesn't preclude you from 
&gt; changing that platform tomorrow if business needs require you to do so.

BUT...

We shouldn't look this gift horse in the mouth because we think it could be 
proposed slightly differently.

I agree Open Standards(tm) are more important for this bill, yet M$ will argue 
that their XML file format is an open standard.  They will argue that CIFS is 
an open standard since Linux, BSD and Windows can all talk on the wire via 
Samba.  They will argue that .NET is an open standard even though only a 
incomplete and unusable subset is ISO published and patent free.

IIRC, M$ got up at the NOIE OSS conference and said with a straight face that 
they were embracing open source.

You and I know what we mean by Open Standards.  Some big proprietry software 
companies don't want that, they want to "embace and extend" and still have 
vendor lock-in.  So by us saying Open Source, we actually mean Open Source 
Software, or Free Software, which by definition supports Open Standards 
Software - if something isn't standard compliant, with the source available, at 
least it can be fixed.

I urge you to support the bill, and anything like it.

Michael...
