Greetings,
I'll prefix this by saying my experience of ISDN is under windows not linux, 
but this question did not specify this, and as you'll see below I can make 
it relevant. Second I'm currently in the Uk, so the Telco situation is a 
little different here, but in my experience not much. 


I have taken my computer from a Dialup to ISDN for work and 512K ADSL for 
Internet access. We use Citrix at work, so in theory the performance could 
be likened to an X based application once it has been run (and in-fact I 
have run some X based applications over 33.6 modem stream, and found it 
"acceptable" 

Under 56K the Internet access was slow, and the Citrix performance was 
"Acceptable". On taking my Internet access to ADSL the performance increase 
was marked and I've not looked back. 

On taking my work connection to Dual 64K ISDN the Citrix performance has 
increased dramatically to very workable, with the exception of display of 
graphics files. Whenever I do a significant data transfer (either browse the 
web via work or transfer files) the speed is still painfully slow with the 
comparison of broadband (however better than ordinary dial-up). 

ISDN is also very much more expensive than its alternatives, but some times 
is the only alternative to plain dialup. I don't notice this cost as Work 
pays for the ISDN, and I have flat rate ADSL per month. 

Some notes: 

56K dialup is a theoretical download maximum and is affected by a-lot of 
things, and usually less than 56K. Upload is always 33.6 

64K ISDN channel is ALWAYS 64K in both directions. 

ADSL can be synchronous or Asynchronous in upload and download speeds, so 
some consideration as to use is necessary. Most people want to download data 
to their computer, but not always. 

I realise I've answered more than your question, but I hope it is useful. 

cya

&gt; I'd like to know if anyone on the list has an ISDN dial-up connection, who 
&gt; you are with and do you think its worth it over 56k dial-up?
