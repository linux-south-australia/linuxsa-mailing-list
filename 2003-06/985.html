&gt; Alex,
&gt;
&gt; All this discussion about the "slow rollout" just makes me want to 
&gt; puke or laugh - can't decide which.
&gt;
&gt; Australia has been and always will be in the slow lane in relation to 
&gt; the super-highway and the rollout being too slow isn't really the 
&gt; issue and never will be.  The issue really should be that in many 
&gt; areas there is no rollout happening at all for Broadband or ADSL and 
&gt; there never will be.
&gt;
&gt; Broadband and ADSL slow rollouts are the least of the average person's 
&gt; concern (and probably that of many other persons who run small 
&gt; businesses, or who are in the North of Adelaide).  The entire argument 
&gt; is what I call a "firfy", or a redirection/slight-of-hand exercise - 
&gt; it is not the relevant argument at all.
&gt;
&gt; I live in a fairly new housing development in the North of Adelaide.  
&gt; I had a strict budget, a need for a one level house (for family 
&gt; medical reasons) and had my house built - they are still building the 
&gt; last few houses in the development and still have a few empty lots.  
&gt; The land prices are ***reasonably*** (eg not $150K+ but between $50K 
&gt; and $100K - but started out at between $20K and $70K) priced for 
&gt; people on the one income or low income.  Each time I asked Telstra 
&gt; when my exchange would be ASDL enabled (easier for work access and 
&gt; homework access) they couldn't give me a definite answer - even their 
&gt; handy website checker said ASDL isn't enabled in your area yet, please 
&gt; check back later - I wasn't planning on broadband for various reasons.
&gt;
&gt; I eventually discovered, a few years after I moved in, and after many 
&gt; calls to Telstra, and deciding to change my expectations, to my shock, 
&gt; that I cannot get cable (they wont lay it in my area and have no 
&gt; intention of doing so at any time in the future), nor can I get ADSL 
&gt; (they didn't lay the correct type of phone lines for that - they say 
&gt; the original owners of the property development didn't specify it 
&gt; being needed (so they picked the cheapest phone cable around - 
&gt; regardless of the fact that the housing development is situated right 
&gt; near a main arterial road with 20 minute access to the cbd and has 
&gt; quite a few small and large businesses in and around it)).
&gt;
&gt; My only option is to go satellite and pay big bickies for the install 
&gt; and then more big bickies on monthly satellite access with any ISP 
&gt; (Telstra were very helpful with lots of other options - No, I don't 
&gt; want to go ISDN - why bother - the cost isn't worth it and they 
&gt; couldn't ensure it would work properly on the cheap phone lines or 
&gt; give me more than 66K - not the 128K they advertise - and, No, I don't 
&gt; want Foxtel - they only do satellite link - they can't/don't/wont do 
&gt; cable in my area - who has time to watch lots of TV - to get it is a 
&gt; further waste of money on re-run crap - No, I don't want BigPond 
&gt; Satellite access, I already have an ISP I am happy with, also the cost 
&gt; involved in putting in the satellite comes in yet again).
&gt;
&gt; So I have to put up with my somewhere between 21K and 33K modem link 
&gt; (the phone line wont handle anything higher than that even if I could 
&gt; tweak the settings of my 56K modem - another reason to forget ISDN) 
&gt; until something else comes along or I move or (I doubt it would happen 
&gt; in a brand new housing development) they upgrade the phone lines.
&gt;
&gt; This leads me to the conclusion that what I would like to see is 
&gt; Telstra and the Parliament, tarred and feathered, drawn and quartered, 
&gt; and then hung up for the vultures - or a royal commission with teeth 
&gt; (is that an oxy-moron) into their supplying reasonable services to 
&gt; ***all*** Australians (the government thinks if you can get 14K or 
&gt; above, this is ***reasonable*** - try it sometime - you might last 5 
&gt; minutes).
&gt;
&gt; Come to think of it, taking those persons in Telstra and the 
&gt; Government who use the super-highway as a major part of their daily 
&gt; work and personal lives and making them live and work on a - so called 
&gt; - average income in a "non-rollout" area with a ***reasonable*** 14K 
&gt; modem connection would probably be more satisfying to me.  But I think 
&gt; I would still like the see the Tarring and Feathering first.

&gt; THE MEDIA REPORT with Mick O'Regan
&gt; The Slow Lane on the Superhighway
&gt; Thursday, 26 June, 8.30am, repeat 8pm
&gt; As Parliament wrestles with new media ownership rules, critics
&gt; suggest our communications infrastructure is inadequate. Is
&gt; the roll out of 'broadband' too slow, leaving Australia stuck
&gt; in the slow lane on the communications superhighway?

The area your describing sounds like Mozzie Lakes   lol. J/K. I agree 
with what your saying.I live north of Adelaide in a rural area and my 
little country exchange will certainly not be on top of the list to get 
fast internet. Although i'm lucky because my dial-uip always connects 
between 45333Kb/sec --46666Kb/sec.  Some of your issues should be aired 
especially with the apparent further sell off of Telstra.
