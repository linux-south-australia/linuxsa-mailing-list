George,

With the help of another Linux guru here at work, we found the XDMCP was
enabled, (the first linux helper I got is also swamped in work so I can't
use them), I have got, what can only be called, the two for one method of
Xterm access.

The only video cards we had on hand are either compatible but wont fit the
PCI slot or are semi compatible and will fit the PCI slot.

We picked one.

Then we found we can get the GUI up on the console on the PCI video card but
if I want to go to the command line on the console, I have to swap the
monitor cable over to the onboard video card.

At least with this configuration we were able to fool the system into
letting external Xterm access, at least I keep telling myself that.

We also got rid of the stupid firewall software which was causing me
authorization problems with other stuff.  We already have a really nice
friendly linux firewall between us and no-mans land, so it was a nice but
not necessary and I can live without it.

Next, I plan on getting a couple of AGP i740 video cards, which apparently
tend to like anything and are compatible with Redhat Linux 7.3 and see if I
can get rid of my two for one method.

I love Linux, I love Linux, I love Linux, Ooooohhhhh, I love Linux, ....

(At least I have Administration access to do my work, don't even start me on
the Bile Gate Servers we have here!!!!)

George,

I need to put the server in the computer room and be able to access it via
an Xterm (Kea! X) application from my PC for monitoring and administration
purposes (or from a laptop from home).

I also need to have applications developers access the GUI via an Xterm
application on their PCs to do applications development work.

So far we have got to the point where we could get root account up on the
Xterm application on my PC but no other user will work without Xterm
application.

And the hunt goes on...
