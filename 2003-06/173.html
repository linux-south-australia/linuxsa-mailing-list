No the biggest problem is the vast plethora of choice that linux gives
you instead of locking you into the M$ mindset of shelling out more &
more money for any "extras" you may think you need.

Perhaps Spyro may like to try a simplified firewall generator like
quicktables available from <A HREF="http://qtables.radom.org/">http://qtables.radom.org/</A> which will ask all
kinds of questions about the ports he wants opened and what modules to
load like ip_conntrack_irc.

OR The script I use is MonMotha's available from
<A HREF="http://monmotha.mplug.org">http://monmotha.mplug.org</A> All you do for MonMotha is edit the script to
add your local network and what ports you want open etc....

Whichever script you choose on a redhat system is unimportant, you can
even use the lame redhat tool called lokkit.

To use a script on a redhat system is easy. Just do the following as
root....

chkconfig ipchains off # To make sure ipchains isn't started at boot

service ipchains stop  # To stop any ipchains processes

rmmod ipchains         # To unload any ipchains kernel modules

chkconfig iptables on  # To ensure iptables is run at boot

chmod +x rc.firewall   # To make the script executable

./rc.firewall          # To actually run the script and put the firewall
into place

service iptables save  # To save the firewall rulesets for future
reboots

insmod ip_conntrack_irc # If the script doesn't automatically load this
module

You may need to load other modules too depending on your needs. Also it
may be necessary to open ports for icq and msn etc.... Google should
help you to find out the port numbers as the file /etc/services usually
only lists common unix port numbers.

There are even gui's for generating firewalls available from freshmeat
and other places. I have a firewall script generation page I grabbed
from freshmeat on my web server at <A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/fwgen/">http://awol.no-ip.org/fwgen/</A>

I don't think the problem is with linux per se, but with the
overwhelming number of choices linux presents, and the many conflicting
points of view and advice a new user generally recieves.

Remember, open source means open choice!
