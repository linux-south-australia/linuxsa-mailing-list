&gt; You can actually get portupgrade to play nice?  I've been a 
&gt; longtime user of ports, subscribed to many security type 
&gt; lists and upgrading ports on servers manually when there's a 
&gt; security issue, but Debian seems to have made me rather lazy.

Well, I've only been using it regularly for about a month. I had this hassle
just now, and I don't know whether it's me or it that is at fault.

&gt; Every time I've used portupgrade, it needs its hand held for 
&gt; 50 thousand packages, there's "conflicting" ports, 
&gt; portupgrade seems to choke on some ports then complains about 
&gt; a dependency not being there, all sorts.  I usually find it 
&gt; easier just to do it manually.

Yes, well, I simply refuse to do it manually :) I am accustomed to OSes
knowing more about themselves and how to upgrade themselves than I do, so I
expect them to do just that. One of the main thing I want from an OS is
self-maintenance, at least when it comes to simple things like updating
software and security fixes. I want to only worry about config changes,
selecting software, and resource management, really (and I'd like it if it
did that for me too!) ...

I have been running portupgrade -arR once per week or so, and have found it
to be okay, bar for this problem, and the irritation of it requiring my
intervention whenever it comiles php4... Oh, and it's damned slow -- I
invariably have to leave it overnight. Might be better if I didn't have both
kde and gnome -- but my planned usage is not really for the desktop anyway.

&gt; Is it just me?

Do you do a portsdb -Uu after every ports tree cvsup? Do you run pkgdb -F
regularly?
