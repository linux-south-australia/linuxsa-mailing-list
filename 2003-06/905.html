&gt; I personally think AMD has a real winner with the opteron. You can get
&gt; access to 64 bit address space without dropping all your current software
&gt; (i.e. going to PPC64 or SPARC).

Well, that's also the case with 64-bit PPC and Sparc platforms; they 
both run existing 32 bit applications fine. It's only Intel's 64-bit 
platform that sucks when running 32-bit apps.

&gt; I reckon Sun's days are numbered. You can now get much cheaper and much more 
&gt; powerful 64 bit Opteron servers (per CPU anyway) running Linux instead of 
&gt; expensive and slow SPARC boxes. 

Sparc boxes are slow when compared to similarly priced x86 hardware but 
you are talking about extremely low end hardware. For anything more, Sun 
has little competition. There is no x86 equivalent to the Sun Fire 
midframes and the high-end 10k/12k/15k machines, for example.

&gt; The only reason to have a Sun server would be for stuff &gt; 8 CPU's or so I 
&gt; imagine, where Sun scales well. I imagine that's a small market though.

Yep. Sun is taking a beating in the low-end market, as the x86 boxes 
they are now shipping bear witness, but the mid- and high-end market is 
anything but small. It may appear small because of the "small" number of 
units shipped and the small about of marketing and press noise that it 
generates, but the market is huge in terms of dollars (and profit, I 
assume).

&gt; And sure, if IBM can make the PPC970's economical enough, they'll do well
&gt; on the server side too.. (is the G5 = PPC970? Or is it a different chip?
&gt; The PPC970 looks _sweet_).

AFAIK they are the same. They *are* sweet chips. It will be interesting 
to see how IBM's PPC970-based mid- and high-end offerings compare to 
Sun's in the near future. However, I hear Sun has put a lot more effort 
into Sparc R&D over the last few years and the next generation of Sparc 
processors will likewise be kick-arse.

Interesting times.

Mike.
