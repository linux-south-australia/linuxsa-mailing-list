&gt;&gt; Your question was a stretch.

Yeah, you're right. I just thought I'd ask, for you guys appear to know
something about everything to do with computers. I thought some of the ISP
employees in the forum might know some glaring info.

&gt;&gt; Surely the obvious thing to do is to raise a Cisco TAC case
&gt;&gt; and ask Cisco themselves?

Yes, that's cool. Thanks for that. I'll follow it up.

Thanks for your reply

Cheers,

Darren

&gt; Come on, guys. Hasn't anyone got anything interesting to say about the

&gt; Please? Anyone?

Your question was a stretch.  You are asking about Cisco
propietary software running on Windows in a Linux user group
list.  Even Windows users would be unlikely to know much
about the Cisco VPN software, considering most Windows users
would choose the VPN client that comes with the operating
system.

Surely the obvious thing to do is to raise a Cisco TAC case
and ask Cisco themselves?

Glen
