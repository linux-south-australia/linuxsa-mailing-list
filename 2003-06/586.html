<H1>Decent Hardware AP's for outdoor use?</H1>

Hiya,

I've always been against hardware AP's due to the massive issues (stability
especially, ack) they seem to have, but I guess they're the only real option now.

I'm needing to deploy some major ourdoor links that *absolutely* need to be
stable at *all* times.  I'm curious to hear of other people's recommendations;
I know most AP's are great for indoor use, but pretty much all I've tried seem
to choke and die randomly with outdoor connections, especially under high
network load; perhaps due to interference (note though, prism cards on these
same connections with hostap under linux didn't exhibit this behaviour - I've
done a whole bunch of outdoor installs with DWL-520 cards that are stable as
hell, but it seems I can't get prism cards at a decent price anymore.).

Anybody know of any such units?  I know the high end (Enterasys, Cisco) AP's
are extremely solid, but I'm wondering if there's anything more affordable -
they seem to have absolutely exhorbant price tags.

Features on the AP's don't bother me - I don't care about 802.11X, radius
authentication, or 128-bit WEP, because I tend to deploy security on gateways
behind hardware AP's - just as long as they can be configured to be rock
stable, and can do mac filtering, I'm happy.

Cheers,

R
