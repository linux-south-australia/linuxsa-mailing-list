&gt; Since the original query was from a self-confessed linux newbie and
&gt; redhat 7.x shipped with both ipchains AND iptables I merely provided as
&gt; complete instructions as I could to ensure that he could ensure that no
&gt; previously defined firewall possibly using ipchains was running. You
&gt; need to make sure ipchains modules are not running before you unload
&gt; them. I also gave complete instructions on how to do so and then run an
&gt; iptables firewall instead. For the few minutes (or seconds) it would
&gt; take to do this I believe your perception of an unprotected system is
&gt; unimportant.

Indeed, your instructions were correct and helpful. However, it's always 
worth pointing out when instructions could *conceivably* lead to a lack of 
protection. Sure, it's unlikely that it would get hacked during those 
minutes (as a newbie, it's likely to take more than a few minutes). However, 
I have heard of machines that have been hacked within minutes of being 
connected to the internet, so anything's possible. Hence my warning -- don't 
take it personally :) 

&gt; 
&gt; Yes, redhat has tools for starting/stopping and getting the status of
&gt; every service on the system via the command line. The service command is
&gt; such a tool. Every distro has it's own quirks and variations but redhat
&gt; appears to have gone down this path towards user friendliness. Actually
&gt; the service command is rather intended to be used by the redhat gui's
&gt; rather than by command line junkies, but it is useful for newbies
&gt; getting to know CLI and is quite safe. Much safer than trying to call
&gt; the /etc/init.d/ scripts directly or worse, starting the daemons
&gt; manually without the aid of scripts at all.

Yeah, I know why they do it, but it irks me. Partially because I 
occasionally teach at TAFE, and the students are rumoured to have been 
taught Linux, but have actually been taught RedHat, so when I say anything 
like "the init.d scripts" they have no idea what I'm talking about. It's a 
hobbyhorse of mine. 

&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. I still don't understand why people insist on CC'ing me when I'm
&gt; obviously subscribed to the list. I thought linux users were meant to be
&gt; logical thinkers?

Because messages from the list are set to automatically reply to the sender, 
not the list, so hitting reply-all is easier. Sure, I could edit it each 
time, but I don't. I might try to do so more often though.
