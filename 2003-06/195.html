&gt; I'm not a RedHat user or fan, but I am pretty sure that this command
&gt; will actually leave your system completely unprotected by packet
&gt; filtering. Of course, RedHat does tend to use these irritating things
&gt; like "service blah stop" and so on, which serves to confuse everything,
&gt; make you not know quite what it is you are doing, and make people who
&gt; know how to use RedHat incapable of sitting at any other *nix box and
&gt; know how to stop or start a service... sigh.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, a pedantic, and probably unimportant technicality -- ipchains and
&gt; iptables don't actually run as processes, per se. They are kernel
&gt; modules. When I first started out trying to do firewalls, I was looking
&gt; for a process called "ipchains" or something similar, and was very
&gt; frustrated by the fact that I couldn't find it to kill it.
&gt; 

Since the original query was from a self-confessed linux newbie and
redhat 7.x shipped with both ipchains AND iptables I merely provided as
complete instructions as I could to ensure that he could ensure that no
previously defined firewall possibly using ipchains was running. You
need to make sure ipchains modules are not running before you unload
them. I also gave complete instructions on how to do so and then run an
iptables firewall instead. For the few minutes (or seconds) it would
take to do this I believe your perception of an unprotected system is
unimportant.

Yes, redhat has tools for starting/stopping and getting the status of
every service on the system via the command line. The service command is
such a tool. Every distro has it's own quirks and variations but redhat
appears to have gone down this path towards user friendliness. Actually
the service command is rather intended to be used by the redhat gui's
rather than by command line junkies, but it is useful for newbies
getting to know CLI and is quite safe. Much safer than trying to call
the /etc/init.d/ scripts directly or worse, starting the daemons
manually without the aid of scripts at all.

P.S. I still don't understand why people insist on CC'ing me when I'm
obviously subscribed to the list. I thought linux users were meant to be
logical thinkers?
