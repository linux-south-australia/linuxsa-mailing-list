&gt; Matthew,
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Can you give some examples? I'd genuinely like to hear what in
&gt; &gt; particular you (or anyone else) find illogical.
&gt; 
&gt; Whilst I understand why there is:
&gt; 
&gt;  /etc
&gt;  /usr/local/etc/
&gt; 
&gt; (i.e. differences between the locals and the not locals) I find it painful.
&gt; Trying to shift between a Linux system to a FreeBSD system can be painful
&gt; because some of your configuration which lives in /etc/ ends up in
&gt; /usr/local/etc/ and for no apparently logical reason.
&gt; 
&gt; *I* find that annoying.

So you're frustrated at people packaging applications differently on
different unix (or unix-like) operating systems? There's documentation
around that explains the logic behind this, but that doesn't force
application vendors or software packagers to conform to it. It's also a
little harder with Linux given that there is no base user-land part of
the operating system as there is with FreeBSD et al.

Does that make Unix illogical?

In the Hands-On Unix course I instruct, people often complain that vi
isn't logical, whereas most people on this list (even those who despise
vi) can probably see the logic behind most of the editor's features.
It's just not all that intuitive for the uninitiated.

Matt
