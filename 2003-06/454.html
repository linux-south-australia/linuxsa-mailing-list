<PRE>
Third line forcing is a specific form of exclusive dealing
and is a per se breach of the Act -- i.e. it is prohibited no
matter what its effect on competition. It involves suppliers:

 * supplying goods or services, or supplying at a particular
   price or subject to a discount or rebate, on condition
   that the purchaser acquire other goods or services from
   another person (s. 47(6)); or

 * refusing to supply goods or services, or refusing to
   supply at a particular price or subject to a discount or
   rebate, if the purchaser has not acquired, or not agreed
   to acquire, other goods or services from another person
   (s. 47(7)); or

 * granting or renewing a lease on condition that another
   party to the lease acquire goods or services from
   another person (s. 47(8)(c)); or

 * refusing to grant or renew a lease for the reason that
   another party to the lease has not acquired, or not
   agreed to acquire, goods or services from another
   person (s. 47(9)(d)).

Although third line forcing is prohibited, suppliers engaging
in it may seek immunity from court action under the Act's
notification and authorisation processes, which are
administered by the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission.

I don't believe Toshiba, by bundling Microsoft Windows with their
equipment, have engaged in Third Line forcing.  As I understand it,
Toshiba don't require you to purchase or lease anything from Microsoft.
Toshiba supply Windows to you under an agreement between them and
Microsoft.  Without the requirement that you deal with Microsoft, there
is no third party.
