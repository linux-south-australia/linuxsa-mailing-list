Hi all,

One of my clients has taken a shining to Cobalt, mainly for the managability
functionality -- he'd like to be able to administer ftp, dns, mail, cgi etc
for multiple clients from a web interface, and even delegate some of this
management to individual clients of his. I don't really go on Cobalt myself,
for a few reasons:

* They are overpriced
* They are to be discontinued soon (or so rumour has it -- though they will
retain support for 5 years...)
* They are not as flexible as I would like

I'd much rather get a 1RU machine from a local supplier, configure it
myself, install a web-based interface similar to Cobalt, and suffer from
none of the above problems. Does anyone know of software that can do this?
My requirements are ass follows:

* Looks nice and professional
* Reliable
* Secure
* Can delegate account administration on a per-account basis
* Easy for non-technical users to use (ie not "type your Zone file here:",
but "Enter your mail server, or leave blank for default")
* Can manage:
	* Account creation
	* FTP access
	* DNS details (mainly MX and www.)
	* Apache setup (htdocs folders, cgi-bin)
	* Mail account (for default MX -- virtual users or multiple pop
accounts, etc)
	* Some sort of FormMail-like forms-based email cgi

Obviously, all but account creation would have to be grouped together by
account, not by service...

Anyone seen anything that can do this? I've looked at Webmin, and note that
it appears to allow you to restrict access for individual users to
individual virtual hosts, among other things. I shall look into this, but am
wondering if there is much else around...

Cheers

rr
