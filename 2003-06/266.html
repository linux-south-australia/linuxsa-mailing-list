&gt; &gt; Were you _really_ doing nothing?
&gt; 
&gt; Sitting in an IRC channel doing nothing is termed 'lurking' or 'idling'
&gt; - - some people are crazy and ban/kick you simply because you're /not/
&gt; doing anything.
&gt; 
&gt; Happens a lot in help channels, where powerhungry operators think
&gt; you're not being any use, so what's the point of being in there?

Having been an irc junkie for nearly 8 years and an op in several linux
help channels for the past few years I feel somewhat qualified to
comment on this. Calling an irc channel operator power hungry is just
asking for a response!

There are many irc networks, and many many linux/bsd help channels. Not
all are the same. Some are obviously "nicer" than others just as some
people are "nicer". On EFNET where I normally hang out, the #linux
channel is known for it's rude ops and heavy handed approach. I was even
banned from there for just saying "Hello". But it's their channel to do
with as they wish.

I'm an op in #linuxhelp and #redhat where we try to be more tolerant and
friendly to everyone, but you WILL get chastised and perhaps even
rudeness if you haven't even attempted to rtfm first before asking silly
questions. Similarly trolls are treated with disdain. I drafted some
simple guidelines for #linuxhelp and placed them on my web server at
<A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/howto-gethelp.html">http://awol.no-ip.org/howto-gethelp.html</A> to give people an idea of what
is and what is not generally acceptable in the channel. Of course the
final decision depends on the ops who happen to be monitoring the
channel at the time.

Ops are human beings though, and as such have their good and bad days. I
myself have been put into really bad moods by constant harrassment by
lamers and troublemakers from time to time and have probably treated
others unfairly as a consequence. C'est la vie! But it's only irc, and
not the end of the world.

Having said that, irc can also be an invaluable resource for instant
information on your linux problems where the man pages and documentation
haven't helped you to resolve your problems. There are usually many
people online ready, able and willing to help no matter what the issue,
and often have experienced the very problem that perplexes you. Much
like this mailing list.

However, unlike this mailing list, irc channels can sometimes get
over-populated. This can cause problems for the channel if there is a
limit set, or if people constantly join to ask about other operating
systems. There is a reason why the channel is called #LINUXhelp! There
are other channels called #freebsdhelp or similar for problems with that
OS. The mere fact that no one is answering in #freebsdhelp is not an
excuse or a license to invade a linux channel. The OS's may have
similarities but they also have big differences too. It can be really
annoying after spending quite a lot of your valuable time trying to help
someone with their linux problem you discover the person you've been
helping has been using freebsd all along.

In #linuxhelp an idle kick was recently introduced as having 200 idlers
or lurkers in the channel is simply a waste of space and can create
excess spam when network splits occur. So if you idle in there for 12hrs
or more you will get a 60 second ban (to stop auto-joins) before you can
rejoin. Don't take it personally, it's merely a mechanism to keep the
channel healthy and allow room for people who really need a quick answer
to gain entrance to the channel.

There are many pages online about these issues that describe irc
ettiquette, so I would suggest google will no doubt assist in
enlighteneing those who seek such guidance.

&lt;/rant&gt;
