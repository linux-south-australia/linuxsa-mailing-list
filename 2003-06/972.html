OK, I got it working again. For some reason the package manager installed a 
foriegn language as my localization for Open Office and the application 
didn't like this very much. I only found out after running the setup script, 
so cheers for that. 

Oh, and yeah, I did mean to sign my email message and not just attached a 
key!!!! Sorry, just getting KMail configured, just changed from Mozilla due 
to Openpgp compatability. 

Cheers
Reece

&gt; You may like to backup your OpenOffice directory first.

&gt; &gt; Guys
&gt; &gt; Yesterday when I decided to update my budget (yes, thats right, the good
&gt; &gt; ole home budget) which is in Open Office Calc format, I noticed a bit of
&gt; &gt; a problem. When I attempted to load the document, the splash screen came
&gt; &gt; up, then the application just hung (I am using KDE 3.1 with Mandrake
&gt; &gt; Linux 9.1, the Open Office tab on the panel has the normal hour glass)
&gt; &gt; before,  after approximately 10 seconds, when the application just
&gt; &gt; vanished!!!! Now, thinking something simple had happened, I tried
&gt; &gt; unistalling the rpm's, thinking it might fix the problem. But, to my
&gt; &gt; dismay, this did not fiz the problem. So, in an attempt to fix the
&gt; &gt; problem, I decided to launch the application from the shell using the
&gt; &gt; command oocalc. Now, Open Office did appear to load, however shortly
&gt; &gt; afterwards the application dissapeared once more leaving me with the most
&gt; &gt; cryptic message in the shell of Application ErrorAborted (Note that the
&gt; &gt; message is written as it appears, there was no space between the word
&gt; &gt; error and Aborted).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, has anyone got any ideas!!!!!!!!! Oh, and Open Office really have to
&gt; &gt; think of some better application error messages, I mean come on!!!!! The
&gt; &gt; message that the shell has given is completely useless.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers and thanks in advance
&gt; &gt; Reece
