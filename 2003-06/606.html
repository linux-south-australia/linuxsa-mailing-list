&gt; 
&gt; Politicians are simple folk;  They see feedback from the votors on a 
&gt; bit of a sliding scale, where the following are all equivalent to 
&gt; each other:
&gt; 
&gt;    10,000 email messages
&gt;    1000 phone calls
&gt;    10 faxes
&gt;    1 letter
&gt; 
&gt; Don't send email;  It won't even get read.  It'll be picked up by an
&gt; advisor who will just put a tally-mark in a box marked "pro-OSS", and
&gt; unless the number of tally-marks is large enough to overrun the page
&gt; nobody will give a damn.

Wierd. I treat bits of paper on my desk as candidates for the bin. I _keep_ and
_read_ emails. Are all pollies this far out of date?

&gt; 
&gt; Phone calls are better, but only if they're sustained.  A one-day
&gt; spike of phone calls sparked by an obvious publicity campaign will
&gt; be forgotten in a week after the campaign is over.
&gt; 
&gt; Faxes are better:  They might actually get read by the politician.
&gt; More likely that they'll go to the same advisor who reads the email,
&gt; though.
&gt; 
&gt; A written, personally-signed, individually-worded letter is the best.
&gt; Form letters aren't good (because once the reader has seen a couple 
&gt; of them all the rest will be ignored).

Ok. I'll do that. Mike Rann, Parliament House, North terrace should do it. 
&gt; 
&gt; Summary:  Invest some effort in the process of drafting a letter, 
&gt; printing it, signing it, stuffing it in an envelope, sticking a stamp
&gt; on it and putting it in a post box (sorry to detail all the steps;
&gt; Perhaps people have forgotten how this stuff works in these days of
&gt; email :-)

Thanks. Whats a 'stamp', how do I get hold of some ? Will my boot do?

Michael :)
