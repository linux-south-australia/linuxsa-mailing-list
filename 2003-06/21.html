Ahh yes! i can see where that is coming from, and yes, thats a distinct
possibility, if SCO have a smidgen of evidence.

&gt; &gt; Actually he does not think SCO will win the case, or thats my

&gt; &gt; He seems to think it will be too hard and there will be nojudgment for

&gt; 
&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; I think he was saying that SCO would sort of win a "settlement" rather
&gt; than an actual court case.
&gt; But here's another interesting write-up:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81695,00.html">http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81695,00.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Quotations:
&gt; 
&gt; ============================================================================
&gt; Analysts are balking at The SCO Group Inc.'s offer to view its proof 
&gt; that there is illegal Unix code in Linux, with one calling the move a 
&gt; publicity stunt. Meanwhile, Linux creator Linus Torvalds today said 
&gt; that he has no plans to look at the code and that the battle between SCO, 
&gt; IBM and Novell Inc. is on par with a rancorous episode of the Jerry 
&gt; Springer Show.
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt;  One person who won't sign a nondisclosure agreement is Torvalds, who 
&gt; created Linux in 1991. Torvalds, in an e-mail response, said there's 
&gt; "no way" he can sign a nondisclosure agreement with SCO to review the code. 
&gt; "Others have asked and haven't gotten anything, so I don't see much point. 
&gt; They don't want to tell; they want to sue. I'm told that it will come out in 
&gt; discovery during the actual suit at some point."
&gt; 
&gt; As for what he thinks of SCO's actions, Torvalds in an e-mail interview 
&gt; compared the fight between SCO, IBM and Novell Inc. to bad TV. "Quite frankly, 
&gt; I found it mostly interesting in a Jerry Springer kind of way. White trash 
&gt; battling it out in public, throwing chairs at each other. SCO crying about 
&gt; IBM's other women. ... Fairly entertaining," said Torvalds.
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt;  Even if there is similar code, that doesn't mean there is infringement, 
&gt; especially under copyright law "fair use" provisions, said Overly. "If I take 
&gt; a piece of code that someone has written, take it verbatim but expand on it 
&gt; and use it for a completely different work, that may or not be copyright 
&gt; infringement," he said. 
&gt; ===========================================================================
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not too sure about this Overly person's understanding of copyright though.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, there's a sale of some neat Roland and Boss gear on at a certain
&gt; music store in the city today. That's more interesting than watching
&gt; SCO play "I've got a secret". 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
