 Software doesn't just appear on the shelves by magic. That
 program shrink-wrapped inside the box along with the
 indecipherable manual and 12-paragraph  disclaimer notice
 actually came to you by way of an elaborate path, through
 the  most rigid quality control on the planet.

 Here, shared for the first time with the general public, are
 the inside details of the program development cycle.

 1. Programmer produces code he believes is bug-free.

 2. Product is tested. 20 bugs are found.

 3. Programmer fixes 10 of the bugs and explains to the
 testing department that  the other 10 aren't really bugs.

 4. Testing department finds that five of the fixes didn't
 work and discovers 15  new bugs.

 5. See 3.

 6. See 4.

 7. See 5.

 8. See 6.

 9. See 7.

 10. See 8.

 11. Due to marketing pressure and an extremely premature
 product announcement based on an overly optimistic
 programming schedule, the product is released.

 12. Users find 137 new bugs.

 13. Original programmer, having cashed his royalty check, is
 nowhere to be found.

 14. Newly-assembled programming team fixes almost all of the
 137 bugs, but  introduce 456 new ones.

 15. Original programmer sends underpaid testing department a
 postcard from Fiji.  Entire testing department quits.

 16. Company is bought in a hostile takeover by competitor
 using profits from their  latest release, which had 783
 bugs.

 17. New CEO is brought in by board of directors. He hires
 programmer to redo  program from scratch.

 18. Programmer produces code he believes is bug-free.
