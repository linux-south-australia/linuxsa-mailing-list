&gt; &gt; I'm not sure what the relevance of DHCP is to this?
&gt; 
&gt; because the site has just changed to DHCP (yes i know living 
&gt; in the dark ages, if only you knew) and obviously with static 
&gt; addressing it's possible to look at the number in the log and 
&gt; look up who's using it.

You can actually make DHCP five out static addresses, assigned by MAC
address, or even make it give out persistent addresses (usually, this is how
it works anyway)... so the addresses are highly unlikely to change (or even
so you can be confident that there is a one-to-one MAC-IP mapping...

&gt; My wondering was was it possible to somehow do a name lookup 
&gt; of the machine (which i'm sure would slow it down a ludacrous 
&gt; amount) and log the name of the machine.

Hmmm... probably... :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; to auth or not to auth.
&gt; 
&gt; Richard russel makes a very good point. yes they do 

Russell. Don't worry, everyone seems to drop the second 'l' -- or perhaps
they drop the first 'l', and move the second one closer to the 'e'...

&gt; understand about DHCP and management auditing yadad. but i've 
&gt; not included the protection of themselves against someone 
&gt; using their PC to surf to unnessesary sites. good call. we 
&gt; don't have that problem thankfully. R&D people. :)

So the reason is "so that management can check up on what you are browsing"
? Not that this is a bad reason, per se, but it's undoubtably an unpopular
one... Personally, my approach to things like this is to say that overall
usage will be monitored, and if too many innappropriate sites are visited,
we'll start to track them down. When innappropriate sites are found in the
logs, you email out a list of the last month's innapprpriate sites,
reminding people that these are innappropriate, and if their use doesn't
cease, management will be wanting you to (re)implement the password system
so that the individuals can be found. Doing this once a year tends to reduce
innappropriate browsing to a minimum...
