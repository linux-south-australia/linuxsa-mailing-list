&gt; What I would like, is a PDF printer driver for Windows, so people can simply
&gt; print whatever they are printing to PDF.

The problem with that, though, is it's usually the wrong point to convert a
document (it's been a long time since I've mucked with the printing subsystem
under Windows, so I can't remember what the GDI passes around).  Postscript
drivers use to quite often go "it's too hard, I'll spit out the document as
a bitmap", so you wound up with Postscript files that were much larger than
the original document [1].

A couple of tools that I want to investigate are PDFlib (www.pdflib.com) and
ReportLab's pdf library (www.reportlab.com), which comes in an Open Source
flavour (typically used for its Python interface).  I've seen tools that are
HTML-to-PDF convertors built on the latter library.

&gt; Either that, or some sort of "Save
&gt; as..." extension in Word so people can actually send documents to each other
&gt; in a useful format, rather than .doc ... I think this would help people move
&gt; away from the MS Word lock-in...

And Microsoft would want that, would they?


[1]  I recently asked for a quote via email, and received an 6.5 meg BMP
     attachment, which blew out to 8+ meg after ASCII encoding.  A joy to
     receive over dialup, especially as it was only a single page quote.
