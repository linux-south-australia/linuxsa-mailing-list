&gt; I have a 286 box, which is kinda cool because it is one of those really
&gt; tiny boxes and would be easy to hide in the corner of my desk, rather than
&gt; hide it behind my door, but only if it was doing something useful.

Funny that, I have a 286 as well - with a 10M hard disk in it.  It took a 
crane to move the damn thing - it's really heavy.

&gt; Do any of you know of a way to convert it into a gateway machine, to act as
&gt; a firewall, and to share my dial-up internet account across the network?

Not using "standard" linux you can't.  I believe there was a Linux port for 
286 machines that didn't have virtual memory support in it.  I suggest that a 
286 would be too slow to handle the high speed of today's modems/network 
cards/operating systems all at once.

I was using mine as a dumb terminal for my 486 a while ago (RS232).  You can 
compile in "Support console on serial port" into the kernel and pass it as a 
kernel option (read the docs).  The 286 was running Telix and did just grand.  
You could dump all your system logs to it if it has a hard disk... at least 
crackers couldn't erase them when they break in to your gateway.

&gt; Both useful advice and any sarcastic remarks about my ownership of such an
&gt; old computer are appreciated!

Seriously though - there are tonnes of apps.  If they can be controlled by a 
serial or parallel port.  A house controller springs to mind - lights, fans, 
garden watering etc.  You'd have to build up the right interfacing circuitry 
though.

Turn it (and its screen) into a glorified clock/calendar?  Of course you'd 
have to run some sort of DOS on it, and code your application yourself.

Personally i'd just keep it by the bed and use it for bludgeoning intruders to 
death in the middle of the night.
