&gt; What I would like, is a PDF printer driver for Windows, so 

The closest thing to this that I have found so far is "pdf995"
(<A HREF="http://www.pdf995.com">http://www.pdf995.com</A>), which is a nagware PDF printer driver. It appears
to work, is simple (click "print..." in any program, select the PDF995
"printer", type in a filename, and save it. The only problem (and it's a
biggie), is that it automatically opens a browser window with a sponsor
message... it's completely rude -- popup ads when you print (or save, or
PDF-ize, or whatever the appropriate verb is). You can pay $US9.95 for these
to go away, but that's not free, let alone Free.

However, I note, at the bottom of the FAQ (<A HREF="http://www.pdf995.com/faq.html">http://www.pdf995.com/faq.html</A>),
it mentions that it uses GNU Ghostscript -- or at least, it "refers" to
it... I wonder quite what that means, and if it's entirely legal... hmmm...


Ooo ooo!

I think I found something else here...


Ghostscript will run on Windows, and has another product called RedMon
(which gives you a redirected printer port, which can redirect printer
output to a program rather than a file or a port). Anyway, this page here
---&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/en/redmon.htm">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/redmon/en/redmon.htm</A>#469 ... tells you
how to set up a PDF Writer in Windows... It looks like a complete PITA, and
very error-prone. I suppose it can't be that hard to set up, but it's
certainly not something Joe Average is going to use. I wonder if it's
possible to bundle this up simply as something Joe Average can use without
thinking? I'm not a Windows guru, so I don't know.

Hmm...

Cheers

PS Yeah, it's not really Linux, per se, but it's all about helping break the
MS Word (and friends) monopoly, so I think it's on-topic enough ... at a
stretch... :)
