That set up sounds so sweet, I am dyin to see what the new opteron's are like. 
There is a really good article about them in Linux Format for June 2003 and I 
agree with you in saying that AMD have a real winner here, I am just waiting 
till they become cheap enough for a desktop version!!! Their real advantage 
of course is the ability to leverage current software (32bit), thus enabling 
an easy upgrade to the 64 bit world. The technical achivement of what they 
have done is really very impressive and I for one take my hat of to them. It 
is so good to see Intel behind the ball on this one, certainly aids the Linux 
+ 64 bit combination. 

Cheers

&gt; &gt; We just got an opteron server, boy is it a sweet box:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dual opteron support (1 1.4GHz opteron installed)
&gt; &gt; 6 dimm slots (1GB RAM installed)
&gt; &gt; PCI-X (or whatever that new fast PCI standard is)
&gt; &gt; on board scsi
&gt; &gt; serial-ata
&gt; &gt; 2 raid controllers (4 120GB Maxtors installed)
&gt; &gt; 2 network cards
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's got an insane number of fans inside the box, that thing is NOT
&gt; &gt; overheating :) (it's as noisy as hell!)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I personally think AMD has a real winner with the opteron. You can get
&gt; &gt; access to 64 bit address space without dropping all your current software
&gt; &gt; (i.e. going to PPC64 or SPARC). The chip also has an onboard memory
&gt; &gt; controller, and can do some special SMP stuff up to 8 CPU's (can't
&gt; &gt; remember what, but it sounded cool).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We're currently running red hat 7.3 on it, but will probably get a 64bit
&gt; &gt; linux distro when synopsys supports one (probably a new version of red
&gt; &gt; hat advanced server or something, dunno).
&gt;
&gt; --edit
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I reckon Sun's days are numbered. You can now get much cheaper and much
&gt; &gt; more
&gt;
&gt; powerful 64 bit Opteron servers (per CPU anyway) running Linux instead of
&gt; expensive and slow SPARC boxes.
&gt; The only reason to have a Sun server would be for stuff &gt; 8 CPU's or so I
&gt; imagine, where Sun scales well. I imagine that's a small market though.
&gt; --/edit
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And sure, if IBM can make the PPC970's economical enough, they'll do well
&gt; &gt; on the server side too.. (is the G5 = PPC970? Or is it a different chip?
&gt; &gt; The PPC970 looks _sweet_).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is what I was thinking, but lately I've been wondering how long
&gt; &gt; &gt; AMD will last against Intel and other established vendors like Sun in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the high-end workstation market. It seems like they are betting the lot
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the success of x86-64, which I think is a big gamble. They don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be doing as well in the 32-bit market any more either.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think Apple is a lot more viable in the long term, so the G5 platform
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be the way forard for me.
