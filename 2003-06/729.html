&gt; PDF seems the *perfect* format to use for Resume's, even not 

Problem is (as DSL said) that there's no convenient tool to do this under
Windows without paying through the olfactory for it. At least, no commonly
available and used one... Perhaps someone could enlighten me?

I also strongly suspect that one of the motivations for them asking for it
in Word format is so that they can then edit it, specifically to remove your
contact details. I know for certain that one agency does this (the specific
agency will remain nameless, not because I don't want to name them, but
because I can't remember the name of said agency). Why do they do this?
Well, as I recall, it was to stop potential employers using recruiters as a
convenient resume-collecting tool, and then simply going direct to the
potential employee, hence avoiding paying the recruiter for their "effort"
... (yes, I know they do do *something*, but I'm not incredibly impressed
with them -- I've been put forward for a number of completely innappropriate
positions over the years)...

rr

&gt; taking the whole portability issue into account.  It's 
&gt; designed for documents just like this - you're looking at a 
&gt; proper finalised view of the document, exactly how the author 
&gt; intended it to look.  Word documents seem pointless - it's 
&gt; not meant to be editable, and word shows widgets around 
&gt; things (i.e. textboxes, borders,
&gt; etc) - which isn't a finalised format ready for viewing.  
&gt; Also often the user's particular word configuration can 
&gt; change the way the document looks on their screen.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree completely with your spit; the request seems totally 
&gt; stupid.  Doesn't surprise me, though.
