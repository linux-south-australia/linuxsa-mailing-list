Steve,

I think he was saying that SCO would sort of win a "settlement" rather
than an actual court case.
But here's another interesting write-up:
<A HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81695,00.html">http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,81695,00.html</A>

Quotations:

============================================================================
Analysts are balking at The SCO Group Inc.'s offer to view its proof 
that there is illegal Unix code in Linux, with one calling the move a 
publicity stunt. Meanwhile, Linux creator Linus Torvalds today said 
that he has no plans to look at the code and that the battle between SCO, 
IBM and Novell Inc. is on par with a rancorous episode of the Jerry 
Springer Show.
[...]

 One person who won't sign a nondisclosure agreement is Torvalds, who 
created Linux in 1991. Torvalds, in an e-mail response, said there's 
"no way" he can sign a nondisclosure agreement with SCO to review the code. 
"Others have asked and haven't gotten anything, so I don't see much point. 
They don't want to tell; they want to sue. I'm told that it will come out in 
discovery during the actual suit at some point."

As for what he thinks of SCO's actions, Torvalds in an e-mail interview 
compared the fight between SCO, IBM and Novell Inc. to bad TV. "Quite frankly, 
I found it mostly interesting in a Jerry Springer kind of way. White trash 
battling it out in public, throwing chairs at each other. SCO crying about 
IBM's other women. ... Fairly entertaining," said Torvalds.
[...]

 Even if there is similar code, that doesn't mean there is infringement, 
especially under copyright law "fair use" provisions, said Overly. "If I take 
a piece of code that someone has written, take it verbatim but expand on it 
and use it for a completely different work, that may or not be copyright 
infringement," he said. 
===========================================================================

I'm not too sure about this Overly person's understanding of copyright though.

Anyway, there's a sale of some neat Roland and Boss gear on at a certain
music store in the city today. That's more interesting than watching
SCO play "I've got a secret". 

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
