I have had a <A HREF="http://www.traverse.com.au/">http://www.traverse.com.au/</A> Netjet ISDN card in a linux box
for 3+ years, and have used it successfully for DoV for a large portion
of that time.

Patching the kernel used to be a pain. But last time I did it was with 
2.4.20, and from memory, its all built in now.

The speed is definitely better than 56k modem, especially the latency if
you are ssh'ing to other sites to do remote admin, and when you use
multilink you can get _almost_ double the throughput.

You can get 56k DoV connections to Ascend/PM3 gear, and 64k DoV
connections to Cisco gear. Lately a few ISP's have come out offering it
on Comindico as well - see <A HREF="http://www.whirlpool.net.au/">http://www.whirlpool.net.au/</A>

To summarise. I wouldn't get ISDN for standard ISDN Dial up unless you
are a very light 'net user. If you are a flat rate/unlimited guy, you
will need DoV, which in my experience has been about the same monthly
price to run as a 56k modem.

However, check www.whirlpool.net.au's headline today for the some info
which may change it all!
