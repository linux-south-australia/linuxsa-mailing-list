&gt; I think this is because the password files have gone corrupt, ive got alot
&gt; of important info I need, off it, how can I get that info back, even if I
&gt; have to scrub the drive again?

If your password file is corrupted for no apparant reason, I'd suggest that 
you may have been cracked.  This is a problem for 2 reasons.

1.  A lot of crackers put keyloggers/packet sniffers on your machine and have 
them automatically send out their logs to somewhere.  Effectively they're 
harvesting passwords for services that don't get encrypted (POP3, IMAP, HTTP, 
FTP, telnet, etc).

2.  They install rootkits on your machine so they can get back in easier next 
time.  The rootkit generally broadcasts its IP to the cracker so they can 
find you again.  Your machine may be used as a "proxy" for cracking other 
machines.

I'd suggest changing your passwords on all of the accounts you can remember 
using lately, checking your logs thoroughly and have a search for a rootkit.  
You may not have been cracked, but you're better to be safe than sorry.

You be able to boot the machine into single user mode.   The kernel option 
"single" will do that.  That boots up into a root shell and doesn't attempt 
to start any services.  I think most distros now ask for the root password 
before starting the single user shell though.

Failing that, you might need a bootdisk to extract the data.

Hope this helps some.

Adam
