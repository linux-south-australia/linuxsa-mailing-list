Thanks for that.

&gt; The insight you need is that IPP printing protocol used by CUPs
&gt; works using URLs, there are differing URLs for printing and admin,
&gt; and CUPS' access controls effect access to URLs.
&gt; 
&gt; So you can have differing policies for ipp:/printers/...
&gt; URLs and a ipp:/admin/... URLs, using pretty much the same
&gt; syntax in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf as in Apache.

Yep. I had a play yesterday afternoon and it appears as though you *can*
set CUPS to authenticate before allowing access to a particular machine
and that it works when printing from the command line on either Linux or
Apple OS/X, but when you try using a graphical application (such as
Evolution or Mozilla), which typically use lpr to print, lpr and the
application hang (presumably waiting for a user password). The Apple
applications seem to just fail and retry at a frequency that causes
CUPSd to assume a DoS attack and turn itself off.

&gt; Access control is described in the manual.

The manual describes how to set it up, I needed to know whether it would
do what I wanted.

&gt; &gt;   - Is it the case that the page count per job is calculated based on
&gt; &gt; part of the postscript that is the print job and that a different
&gt; &gt; something-&gt;postscript filter (say, printing from a Windows box) might
&gt; &gt; make it hard/impossible for CUPS to tally the number of pages printed?
&gt; 
&gt; CUPS has a good modular design, so you can check this easily
&gt; if you have some PostScript you want to test (in test.ps):

I've spent a little bit of time looking at the backend protocol modules
for CUPS. I guess the filter stuff is next on the list.

Thanks for your help.

thx,
Matt
