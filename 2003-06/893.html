&gt;&gt; Do any of you know of a way to convert it into a gateway machine, to
&gt;&gt; act as a firewall, and to share my dial-up internet account across the
&gt;&gt; network?

There aren't too many operating systems that will run on a '286 and
are currently supported.  Coherent 3.x ran really well on a 286, but
didn't have networking support (well, IP anyway.  It had UUCP).  By
the time MWC had released Coherent for the 386, BSD and Linux had
pretty much killed their market share.

If you want to *play*, then there is Minix, and possibly Xinu (although
I haven't looked at either in probably 10 years), and there used to be
a few DOS based networking packages that were an "all in one" type
router, but sourcing drivers for those would really be a pain.  Again,
I'd be thinking of 10 years worth of IP development and exploits that
wouldn't be running on those packages (e.g. Ping o' Death).

&gt; Linux won't work on an i286. I think this is primarily because of its
&gt; virtual memory support (or lack thereof) but that's only running off the
&gt; top of my own, rather bad memory.

The 286 had memory protection, but it only ran to 64K segment sizes.  It
was like Unix running on a PDP11.
