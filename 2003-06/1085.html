Hiya,

&gt; * They are overpriced
&gt; * They are to be discontinued soon (or so rumour has it -- though 
&gt; they will retain support for 5 years...) * They are not as flexible 
&gt; as I would like

They were EOL'ed a few months ago.
 
&gt; Anyone seen anything that can do this? I've looked at Webmin, and 
&gt; note that it appears to allow you to restrict access for individual 
&gt; users to individual virtual hosts, among other things. I shall look 
&gt; into this, but am wondering if there is much else around...

I'm the lead developer of a project called Qbalt
(<A HREF="http://www.sf.net/projects/qbalt">http://www.sf.net/projects/qbalt</A>) - it's been quite heavily backed by many
Cobalt users / ex-developers, and I'm hoping a release will be *very* soon; a
huge amount of work has been done on the project, but I'm not releasing it
until its reasonably bug-free.

The aim of the project is to duplicate the 'appliance', but based on Debian;
its design results in a much more modular design, and its installable on both
current Cobalt hardware, and white boxes.  The interface is php based, but the
actual sysadmin/interface stuff is generated through completely customisable
XML; to cut a long story short, it essentially lets you both easily (like,
almost jokingly easy) write interface modules for any debian package you want
(and intergrating this nicely with the interface), and let you choose which
daemons you use - for example, you can have a choice of MTA, but the front
interface / what the user/administrator sees is exactly the same (perhaps with
more options if the XML definition file has it).

The problem with projects like webmin is that they aren't designed as a
complete solution; they're designed to make particular administration tasks
easier.  They also make a complete mess of configuration files, and if you
make any changes yourself manually, they create an even bigger mess.

I don't know of anything out there that's free - there's Plesk, Ensim, and a
whole bunch of others, but they're commercial, and as far as I know, they
pretty much tie you in with the daemons/interface they give you, and you're
pretty much forced to use the interface.

Wait a month or two; Qbalt should be in full swing by then and quite a viable
option...
