&gt; I have just been doing a spate of upgrading and was wondering just how
&gt; up-to-date Linux distros were getting.
&gt;
&gt; My son has a new system running an AMD Athlon XP 3000 on a new MSI K7N2
&gt; Delta board with 1 G DDR. He is also running the new MSI GeForce FX
&gt; 5600 video card.
&gt;
&gt; My system is a more sedate AMD Athlon XP 2600 running on an MSI K7N2G-L
&gt; board with 512 M DDR.
&gt;
&gt; Both system boards are running with the nVidea chipsets. Both of us are
&gt; running CD-burners and DVD players.
&gt;
&gt; Are these systems too fresh to be successfully running Linux?
&gt;
&gt; What kind of problems could we expect if we did try to put a distro on
&gt; them?

Hi Ian,

I recently purchased an Asus A7V8X motherboard with an AMD 2700+ CPU, 512Mb 
PC2700 RAM, Nvidia GEForce 4 Ti4200, Pioneer DVD, Lite-on CD-RW drive, WD 120Gb 
hard drive.  It has Broadcom Gigabyte ethernet, RAID, firewire and USB 2.0 on 
the motherboard.

I recently installed Red Hat 9 on this box.  Surprisingly everything, including 
ethernet, graphics card, firewire, usb 2.0 all were autorecognised and 
configured.  My legacy serial 56k rockwell chipset modem was autodetected and 
configured.  Also my PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge card and Orinoco WLAN card were 
autodetected and configured.  In essence, everything worked out of the box with 
no fiddling at all[1][2].

So yes, Linux can handle pretty much bleeding edge stuff, but YMMV depending 
upon which specific hardware you have[3].

[1] Ok, so I don't have Nvidia's binary drivers installed yet.  So no DRI.  But 
it's fast already.  I'll get to that soon. :-)
[2] One thing didn't work, and that was the RAID controller :-(  Maybe time to 
start playing with that in my copious spare time. lol.
[3] When I bought all this stuff, I checked google and there were plenty of 
stuff that said a lot of things wouldn't work.  Amazingly, a lot of stuff _did_ 
work, telling me that support for new kit moves quickly.
