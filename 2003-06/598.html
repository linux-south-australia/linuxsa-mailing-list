Steve,

M.Net corporation has been working on a semi-commercial, semi-community
WLAN for some time now, and is in the process of deploying this network
throughout the Adelaide CBD (and possibly further).  This is a pretty
major project involving the use of council infrastructure (traffic light
poles to mount WLAN aerials, etc) and possibly including organisations
such as universities and other commercial organisations. 

If this is something that interests you (or anyone else for that matter)
or you see some potential involvement for you (we would be interested in
knowing more about what Adelaide TAFE is planning to do), contact me
directly and I can put you in touch with the team who are working on the
WLAN project.

Cheers,

Brad Wilson - Wireless Applications Manager, Gallery 4 
m.Net Corporation , tel: +61 8 8210 2029, mob: 0418 848 275

Subject: this might be of interest


When I go to work tomorrow I will begin planning a community based
wireless 
network based in and part of Adelaide TAFE.
This may take some time and have some hurdles to cross, however, it may
be 
possible.
As someone who has been preoccupied with many other issues, I have
failed 
to keep up with community wireless issues in this State.
If anyone feels like sending me details of anything to do with wireless
in 
SA I would be happy read it and plan accordingly.
I would like success stories, failures, equipment locations etc.  If I
get 
enough interest I will start a group to take it further. We HAVE the 
bandwidth (as DSL) kindly reminded me, maybe we can use it for a
community, 
its obvious Telstra will not.
