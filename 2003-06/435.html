Hi David,
    I notice a few people suggesting various DTP software to you, but none
really seem to be addressing what you need (in my opinion anyhow). Some
people have tried to suggest the top of the range DTP, which costs lots and
is fine if you are publishing a newspaper or such like, but for what you
have described you wish to do with it, flyers and a newsletter or such like,
Overkill to the max and a steep learning curve in how to use it, and
probably needs a Graphic Design qualification to actually use. It seems that
the OSS products are not quite there yet either.

    I have been doing much the same as you have suggested, newsletters and
flyers etc, for a number of years, and I use Adobe Pagemaker for all my
work. I started using Publisher and Word - thinking that the Wizards were a
quick easy way to knock something up - and they were - sort of, but the
documents they produced were huge, eg 12 page newsletter with embedded
graphics and tables - Publisher - 6Mb, Word 5Mb, compared to Publisher
1.2Mb, PDF 800k. There was also the font problems that turned me away from
M$ - Adobe uses True Type Fonts (they invented them) and Postscript Fonts. I
have designed many things using Pagemaker including business cards and
brochures and all of these things I can usually take straight to the
printers on a disk and get what I want. I have tried to do this with Word
and Publisher and always ended up doing it again in Pagemaker.

    The advantages I see are these for you with Pagemaker.

&gt; I would like a Microsoft Publisher Replacement (to do brochures and
&gt; flyers) that:
&gt;
&gt;  a) is NOT as buggy or featureless as Scribus

It isn't buggy, has been around for years and before Quark Express and
Scibus etc was the Industry Standard. It has been surpassed, but is still
supported and produces excellent quality documents with few problems.

&gt;  b) is ready to use now

    Go buy it - Cost about $600. Install it - 30 mins from box opening
(tops). Use it - sure a bit of a learning curve, but worth the time and
effort. Also if you are familiar with Publisher then you know what you want
to do so half the battle is over as Pagemaker does all publisher does except
the Wizards.

&gt;  c) I don't really care if it's closed source, open source or not free
&gt;     as in beer
&gt;
    Closed Source, but I have never said I wouldn't pay for software if it
did what I wanted to do.

    Other advantages of Pagemaker - much better WYSIWYG than Publisher,
Documents can be saved as Postscript Documents or PDF in a few mouse clicks.
Finished projects can be taken straight to the Printers on a disk and
printed.

    Disadvantages - a bit of a learning curve, but play with a pet project
over a couple of days to get the hang of it and you should be fine. There
are many books available to help you here also. Not cheap, but not that
expensive either - Academic price is pretty good. There are some minor font
problems, but only if you use some of the strange obscure fonts, and then
simply take a copy of the font file with you to the printers.

&gt; Anyone know of such a thing?

    Well that pretty much does it, so I hope this helps. As I said before,
now that I use it, for my needs at least, I wouldn't go back to Publisher or
Word for that kind of thing. As it turns out I still use Word and Excel to
produce tables etc, but I then cut and paste them into the Publisher
documents I create and they work fine. I hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
