All excellent thoughts.

&gt; I'm not sure what the relevance of DHCP is to this?

because the site has just changed to DHCP (yes i know living in the dark
ages, if only you knew) and obviously with static addressing it's possible
to look at the number in the log and look up who's using it.

My wondering was was it possible to somehow do a name lookup of the machine
(which i'm sure would slow it down a ludacrous amount) and log the name of
the machine.

&gt; authentication.

We have squid on linux auth with NTLM against an winnt schmerver which works
perfectly but as we have just turned it on there was a few ruffled feathers,
not the least of which the 'IT Manager' &lt;very deep sigh&gt; thought it wasn't a
good idea. the politics side is sorted tho, the joy of going over the IT
managers head. :)

and everyone's right, it's just one extra little box and it caches the
entire browsing session as well. I used it for three months before without
any problems.

&gt; to auth or not to auth.

Richard russel makes a very good point. yes they do understand about DHCP
and management auditing yadad. but i've not included the protection of
themselves against someone using their PC to surf to unnessesary sites. good
call. we don't have that problem thankfully. R&D people. :)

thanks for the feedback people.

Regards

Matthew
