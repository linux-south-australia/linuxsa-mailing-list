Hi all,

I've put some further thought into that idea I had the other day (the
one about the business networking event), and I have some more ideas
that may or may not interest people. If it does indeed interest people,
then I'd love to hear comments, on or off list, or ways of making it
work, or whatever. If it doesn't interest you at all, then that doesn't
matter, because you're not the target audience :) ... The target
audience would be people in business using Open Source software, either
those selling products and services largely dependent on open source
software, or those who are interested in buying such products and
services for their business. Possibly also those who just use it within
their business in a significant way. I'd suggest the target audience
wouldn't be individuals wanting to spruik their resume or debate the
merits of emacs and vi (not that these aren't valid activities, but they
would detract from the value of an event like this).

In a more concrete sense, I have a few ideas on what such an event would
entail. An evening might go something like this: People arrive at (say)
5:30, collect pre-printed nametags (from the RSVP list) with their
names, job title, and business name on. There's 15 or 30 minutes of
chat, with drinks and nibbles provided. Host takes the microphone,
welcomes everyone, explains what the event is about, and what's going to
happen, then introduces the featured company... Spokesperson from
featured company gets up and talks for 10-15 mins on their business, how
it uses open source, or what products and services it is able to offer,
and where the future plans are headed -- sort of an Open Source focussed
advertising speil, aimed at slightly technically oriented business
people rather than techos. Host then says a few words, and there's
another hour or so of unstructured networking. People with more things
to talk about could then continue on over dinner elsewhere, or get a
beer perhaps. I also think it would be ideal to try to arrange some sort
of website advertising businesses involved.

The purpose of such an event would be to try to grow business in this
city, using Open Source as the linking point. People could meet other
like-minded people, and increase their ability to provide solutions
through working together. Perhaps some informal or even formal
partnerships could grow from this, and larger contracts could be chased.
Businesses interested in what Open Source can do for them can come and
talk to people capable of providing those solutions.

The practicalities of such an event could be interesting. I did a little
research, and found the Lion Hotel website
(<A HREF="http://www.thelionhotel.com/Lion">http://www.thelionhotel.com/Lion</A>%20files/Lion_functions.htm). This
would have to be at the top end of the market, but it gives some
indication of prices -- suppose we were to get 20-40 people along, a
room would be about $100-$150, drinks about $18 for two hours per
person, food about $10 for snack-type food. Looking at that, it seems
rather expensive (surely there's places that would do it much cheaper?).
20 people would cost $700ish, and 40 about $1300. I suspect that's more
than a sponsor would be prepared to pay, and I can't imagine charging
people to come (perhaps $10 would be ok... perhaps not?).

If anyone has any interest in this type of event, let me know --
particularly if you might be interested in sponsoring it, in exchange
for a few minutes of talk time, some banners, or whatever. Perhaps it
would be best if rather than having a 10 minute advertising speil, there
was a 10-15 minute presentation on some aspect of Open Source in
business, and then a few minutes from the sponsor(s)... Any comments?
