Hi,

Despite the problems I've been having with Gentoo, I quite like it and would
like to use it as my linux distro, but I can't get nVidia's video drivers
working with it.

Firstly, it may be related, but with gentoo when in the console, I get an
occasional character glitch. The background for that one character will be a
different color to everything else (and to what it should be). Or maybe a
character will not appear (be a space instead) and sometimes a space will be
something else. Does anyone else have these types of problems?

I think I even noticed it happening when the kernel was detecting hardwaer,
or whatever it's doing before it says "switching to run level whatever". It
was supposed to say "cache" but said " ache" instead (the h even had a green
background, the others had black backgrounds). I checked dmesg, and it did
have "cache", so it's just the display stuffing around. It can happen any
time though. While portage is compiling it's most obious with the different
colour backgrounds, since so much text is scrolling, it happens more often.
It happens sometimes when I ls, or anything else. It doesn't happen really,
really often, but it's not uncommon either. No other linux distro I've tried
does this.

My computer's a Athlon-XP 2400+, 1G RAM, Asus A7N8X Deluxe (nForce2),
GeForce 2 Ultra. The good news is the latest linux nforce driver has a sound
driver that uses the spdif output :) Now all I need to do is find something
that outputs 5.1 channel sound to see if it works. Does Xine or Mplayer
output 5.1 sound when playing DVDs?

Anyway, X seems to be set up fine, and when I use the vesa driver, I get a
working desktop. When I try the nv driver, my monitor loses the signal from
teh video card and ctrl-alt-F1 doesn't bring it back, but pressing
ctrl-alt-del will at least reboot the computer. This happens with Mandrake
9.1 too, so I'm not too concerned about it. In Mandrake the nvidia driver
works perfectly, but when I try it in Gentooer, I get horrible ASCII
garbage, ctrl-alt-F1 doesn't do anything, but ctrl-alt-del still reboots,
luckily. I can't really describe what ASCII garbage looks like, so if you're
interested here's a photo: <A HREF="http://webone.com.au/~zivkan/cap.jpg">http://webone.com.au/~zivkan/cap.jpg</A>

Since it works in Mandrake, I'm fairly confident it's not a hardware
problem, but the concole text corruption is a little worrying. I'm fairly
confident that I compiled agpgart as a module, so I tried setting the nvagp
option in XF86Config to try using it, and I tried again telling it to use
nvidia's agp driver, but both ways I still get the same garbage.

Sorry if something I wrote sounds a little uncertain. It's been a week since
I was actually playing around with it trying to gt it to work. I was too
lazy/busy to get the picture off the digital camera and write this email. It
was too annoying having to reboot after each attempt, so I decided to go on
memory, rather than try again. Does anyone have any suggestions what to try?

thanks,
Andy
