&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The true vast waste of time and resources is upgrading simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because you can.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, it would be a total abrogation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; responsibilities to ignore critical security updates just because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they came out in the same week, and because I thought it would be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; waste of time to protect my network more often than once a week.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not on the other hand: It would be a total abrogation of
&gt;&gt;&gt; reposnsibilities, full-stop.  If there are security issues you have
&gt;&gt;&gt; to address them.  No question about that.  The question is, do you
&gt;&gt;&gt; trust a distribution to keep track of all the security issues for
&gt;&gt;&gt; you?  I don't.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Selective quoting. You missed the point, and removed the vital part:
&gt;
&gt; I don't think so.  I agreed with you.  You must keep up to date with
&gt; current vulnerabilities.  I added to what you said, by asking if you
&gt; trust a distribution to keep track of those issues for you.


Oh. Ok. Sorry, I read the 'Not on the other hand' differently. Fair enuff
then.

Sometimes it is possible to close the hole without upgrading by adjusting
the configuration. I just take each threat on it's merits and decide what
to do when I understand the implications for my systems. A lot of holes
are closed very quickly by the distributions, so sometimes it is as easy
as updating.

You're right about the implications of a patch vs update approach. If you
patch, you quickly get to the point of making update irrelevant for many
important packages, and probably broken bacause you can't use update to
fix packages that are not 'distribution-native' packages (unless someone
is hiding the secret somewhere), so you land up having 2 processes to run:
patch the source based stuff and update the distro based stuff. That could
get painful after a year or so...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The beauty of the Gentoo and Debian approach is that it is very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; easy, therefore I can and I will keep them up to date with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; minimum effort.(Capability).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; They make it easy to stay up to date if you don't want to have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; know the details.  I *do* want to know the details.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I _think_ that is what I was saying.
&gt;
&gt; If what you think you were saying is that you don't want to rely on a
&gt; distribution to keep track of security issues, then we are in
&gt; agreement.


Sort-of. I want to rely on the distro, but I need to be aware and act
accordingly when something important comes along. I have to accept that
sometimes I may have to abandon the distro packages for some fixes.

&gt;
&gt; If you do want to the distributor keep track of security issues then I
&gt; ask if you can trust them.  Almost all of the mainstream UNIX
&gt; distributors have shown a previous lack of trustworthiness.  (e.g. c.f.
&gt; Morris R, The Internet Worm.)
&gt;
&gt; I trust CERT, I trust what I read on package sites when I go there
&gt; after an advisory.  Distributors might also have security upgrades
&gt; available for me, but I'm not convinced it's easier to look their than
&gt; at the package developers.  Sometimes you have to get your upgrade from
&gt; the package developer because you need a really new feature.  I think
&gt; I'm ahead by largely ignoring distributions.
