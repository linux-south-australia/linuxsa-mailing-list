We currently support 40 or so users running on a Linux system (Linux server
with X-terminals).

I've found the best window manager to use is "Window Maker", mainly because
it is light weight and highly configurable. As for applications we run
Evolution, SquirrelMail, Mozilla, Acrobat Reader, Xscreensaver and
OpenOffice. We don't provide people with access to a file management tool
(because they have no need for one), instead they have a defined folder
structure where they store there files accordingly. This works very well,
however like any company with 40 windows/linux machines they do require a
few hours of support a week.

I do know of a few other companys running on a stripped down gnome2 desktop
very successfully (Linux Server and X-terminals). However I haven't looked
into this, so can't really comment.

Regards Dale Butterworth

Subject: Re: linux on a corporate desktop


Assuming somebody else sets it up for him, the only problem I can forsee is 
the lack of a decent Accounting package for Linux.

As for office Openoffice.org is getting pretty decent, but it's still a slow

bloated pig and I await the day when something like Abiword can compete for 
features (Gnumeric is already superior to openoffice calc). If he has a lot 
of documents/spreadsheets in MS Office format, he should realise that they 
may not be entirely useable in Openoffice.

You may have luck running Quickbooks (or whatever it's called) under
Crossover 
office (or wine if you want to play with it a bit until it works). SuSE
Linux 
corporate desktop (or whatever buzzword SuSE is using for it) bundles 
crossover with it, is intended for a corporate environment and is supported 
for 5 years (though you must pay for support). I have no experience with
SuSE 
so I don't know how good it is. I am presuming that will be the version the 
Munich government uses when it does it's conversion (14,000 desktops).

As far as I know from reading various reports on the web, Linux is being
used 
successfully in these environments (other people please add more):

-LTSP setups for schools/education facilties
-Research Computers in Universities
-Clusters for Super computing
-Web/File/Print/Database serving
-Professional 3D Animation and rendering (Pixar,ILM, Dreamworks, Disney,
etc)
-Point of Sale terminals
-Software/Hardware development workstations (e.g. Intel use Red Hat Advanced

server/workstation + Synopsys, according to what I was told today by a 
Synopsys representative). However they did say that 60-70% of their
customers 
still use Solaris (quoted stability reasons - Sun hardware is very
reliable).

Based on this it seems to me that Linux works best when it is used in:
a) Strictly controlled, single purpose environment
b) Environment where professional Sysadmins are available to look after the 
boxes
c) Environments where the user is technically skilled

However, I'd love to hear if anybody has got it working successfully in a 
corporate environment.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; Hi all
&gt;
&gt; I just recieved an email from a friend who is at least considering using
&gt; linux on desktops etc. Basically i'm scoping around for ideas on what to
&gt; suggest, as personally i'm a little indecided about the abilities of linux
&gt; on the desktop. I use it, and am very happy with it, but for someone
&gt; without much computer experience, how good would it be?
&gt;
&gt; I'm mainly interested in experiences/opinions of people on this list who
&gt; have managed to get your average computer user to use linux in a
corportate
&gt; setting successefully for the uses mentioned below.
&gt;
&gt; This is a copy (albeit a modified one for purposes of anonimity) of the
&gt; email i recieved.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "We are thinking of using Linux for the new company that Fred is
&gt; creating
&gt;
&gt; For the moment he uses outlook express, excel, word and acrobat reader
&gt;
&gt; He will need to be able to receive/send mails, make spreadsheets, write
&gt; letters/faxes and also keep the accounting (a full one : so invoicing,
&gt; balance sheets, planning, stock ,.)
&gt;
&gt; You have to know that he is no computer wizard and is not eager to spend
&gt; too much time on it
&gt;
&gt; We got conflicting info regarding Linux
&gt;
&gt; Some people say that the system is only usable for server applications and
&gt; that you can not run a professional business just with Linux"
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; any comments?
