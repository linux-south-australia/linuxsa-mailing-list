Hi.

* Richard Russell &lt;<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>&gt; [2003-06-27 13:27]:
&gt; &gt; 4. The personal touch: If you have an OzEmail, Business Pack, 
&gt; &gt; Family Pack, WOW, Access1, Camtech, SE Net, Harvey Norman, 
&gt; &gt; Packard Bell, PowerUp, Voyager, Gateway or winNET account, 
&gt; &gt; you can use MyMail to access your existing email service. 
&gt; &gt; Simply enter your full email address and password and click 
&gt; &gt; the login button.
&gt; 
&gt; I understand your other objections, but not this one... Are you saying this
&gt; is the only way to access your email, or that it's a painful webmail system,
&gt; or that the username is too long, or just that webmail exists?

I think you are seeing a loyal user wailing over the prostitution of a very good
SA ISP into a seething mish-mash of competing cultures run by a bunch of goons
from a failed communications company that does't give a stuff.

The latest 'upgrade' (unannounced, and inadequately tested if at all), is a
marvelous email server upgrade from good old reliable sendmail to some POS called
'InterMail'

Actually, I take that back. InterMail is most likely a very good thing. It's
problem is more to do with the lack of care in implementing it at Ozemail/MCI.
(It's the system that the whole of MCI uses, so SeNet users had to get it - I just
wish they had warned us so we could jump ship before they ruined our lives)

Note that none of this critisism is intended towards the poor people who work for
Ozemail tech support. They are overworked to hell trying to patch together the
pieces after management has decreed impractical changes and timeframes. I feel for
you people, I respectfully suggest you get your job applications in somewhere else
as a matter of urgency.

If this diatribe is a bit emotional, I apologise. I have spent nearly 10 hours
(most of it on hold) over the last 3 days trying to get our email sorted out. I
have not spoken to a human in under 26 minutes after initiating the call during
this time.

MCI Sucks. Stay away from it.

Michael
