&gt; &gt; The number one reason for simplifying the /etc tree and the 
&gt; &gt; format of config 
&gt; &gt; files is to ease the burden on
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; a) System Administrators, especially those new to Unix
&gt; 
&gt; Thing is, this is one of the issues that I have with RedHat. People can
&gt; learn how to administer a RedHat box (even using the RH tools), but will get
&gt; entirely lost on any other Linux or Unix system, because they've never seen
&gt; /etc/init.d, don't know anything about /etc/rd?.d, can't configure samba
&gt; without SWAT, and so on. I guess that's perfectly OK for a home user, or
&gt; someone who doesn't plan on being employed as a Unix person, and in some
&gt; ways, I'm sure the RedHat way is superior... however, it produces inferior
&gt; sysadmins.
&gt; 
I may have argued this point before, but I still believe that this is
not the case.  My philosophy is that people learn by success, which
necessarily means doing things the easy way to start with.  This doesn't
mean that they're inferior, just not as experienced.  Any decent
SysAdmin will eventually need to do things beyond the GUI Tool and
they'll do it because most things they have done in the past they have
suceeded in so the next step of getting hands dirty using vi and/or
emacs will be far easier than if that is where they start.


&gt; Someone who learnt the Uern system would not know how to administer Unix...
&gt; (which may or may not be ok...)
&gt; 
I still don't believe this...

&gt; &gt; b) Automated GUI Tool makers, to allow a single purpose tool 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Noble, but neccessarily involves dumbing down the configuration, IMHO. :)

Nope, making it more accessible.

IMHO, this whole attitude reeks of elitism and is a major problem with a
lot of Unix SysAdmins and perhaps the problem that anyone will encounter
when trying to propose "Linux of The Future".  Thing is, this is not an
attitude that I would give you based on your postings so I desperately
don't want you to take it to heart.  On the other hand, I've noticed
this with myself when comparing Linux SysAdmins and Windows SysAdmins. 
Another time for that whole argument though....
