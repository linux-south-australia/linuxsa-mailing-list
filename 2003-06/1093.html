&gt; &gt; They were EOL'ed a few months ago.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess that explains why they are hard to find on the Sun website 
&gt; (hard, not impossible)... 

Yeah, they're still selling them, and supporting them until 2007 (afaik).
 
&gt; Nice. Top class idea. I would be interested in taking a look at it,
&gt;  if possible, and perhaps doing some testing and de-bugging... 

I would have had a Alpha release out for other developers this/next week if it
wasn't for my development box hard drive dying, and losing ~1 month's work
(re: my post about ext2 partition recovery).  Sigh, backups really *are*
important...
  
&gt; Sounds good. Does it have (or have plans for) the ability to 
&gt; delegate things like virtual domains, and email and dns records for 
&gt; individual accounts? 

Sure does, was one of the original design goals - there's things that Cobalt
doesn't give to a siteadmin that it should.
 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The problem with projects like webmin is that they aren't designed as a
&gt; &gt; complete solution; they're designed to make particular administration tasks
&gt; &gt; easier.  They also make a complete mess of configuration files, and if you
&gt; &gt; make any changes yourself manually, they create an even bigger mess.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's one of my objections... 

I originally started developing something like Qbalt ~3 years ago solely due
to this - never completed it though, but it ended up morphing into a
commercial project which was kinda successful, long story.  It's why I loathe
Apple XServe's - same problem.  Making sure it *can* understand configuration
files and not make a mess of custom changes is one of the most important
things frontends should do IMHO, seems really odd to me that hardly any even
try to do it (apart from the fact its a bitch to code, nevertheless possible).

&gt; &gt; Wait a month or two; Qbalt should be in full swing by then and quite a viable
&gt; &gt; option...
&gt; 
&gt; I think I have a week to get a solution proposal in... 

Go with Plesk/Ensim then, its your best option given the timeframe.  Even
though Qbalt will be usable in ~2 months, I definitely will be advising people
against using it in a production enviroment until the code stablises.
