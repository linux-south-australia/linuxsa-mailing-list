Quoting "De Fluiter, Desiree" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dmdeflui@subcorp.com.au">dmdeflui@subcorp.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; According to Telstra, the highest speed I, and anyone, in my area can get on
&gt; our phone lines is actually 33K but more usually I get somewhere between 21K
&gt; and 31K.  Basically, my standard 56K modem is much more than I really can
&gt; use at home on my phone line because my phone line can't go above 33K.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, even with the two phone lines the best I could hope for is 66K
&gt; with ISDN.

ISDN only uses a single copper pair (phone line) to run a digital service, 
usually replacing an existing phone line. On this digital service you get 2 
usable channels, which can be used with the NT1+ that comes as part of the ISDN 
home product. Because it is a digital service, you're guaranteed 64K per 
channel. Due to analogue-digital conversion issues, a 56K V90 modem on each 
channel will get a 49333 connection nearly every time like having the exchange 
in your house.

You can use a real ISDN device to use the full 64K of each channel, bonding 
them together to get 128K. If you don't like the price Telstra charge for that, 
you can use DoV, and get the 64K at the same price as a voice call if your ISP 
permits it.

&gt; I know that the underground cabling housing has empty spare piping for
&gt; extras later on - I saw them making the streets.  They only made a couple of
&gt; streets, then sold them, then made another set of streets and so on.  So why
&gt; they can't do broadband is way beyond me.

Who owns these ducts? The council, the developer, or Telstra? If you find 
enough neighbours who also want broadband, it might be worth someone's while to 
set it up.
