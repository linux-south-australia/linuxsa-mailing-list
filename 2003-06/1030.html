Broadband inquiry killed:
JUNE 24, 2003  
 
 IN a surprising political move, an attempt by Labor and the
 Democrats to set up an inquiry into broadband competition
 has been defeated by the government and four independent
 Senators.

 Labor and the Australian Democrats had called on the Senate
 to set up an inquiry into broadband competition. They were
 supported by the federal Greens senators. But the four
 independents - Senators Meg Lees, Shayne Murphy, Brian
 Harradine and Len Harris - joined the government in voting
 down the call. 

 Labor said it called for the inquiry because the roll-out of
 broadband was crucial to Australia's social and economic
 development. 

 ...

 "Whether it's pair gains, limitations to the ADSL service,
 or the sheer expense involved in satellite - many many
 Australians are just not physically able to hook up to a
 broadband service," Senator Lundy said. 

 Download limits were also on the list of proposed terms of
 reference. Senator Lundy said these limits prevented
 Australians from getting the true value from their broadband
 connections. 

 Democrats Senator John Cherry, who had also called for the
 inquiry, said its defeat raised concerns about how the
 Senate could properly oversight Telstra. 

 "It certainly raises concerns as to how the Senate can
 properly oversight Telstra and its pricing when the
 independents are in negotiation with Senator Alston," he
 said.
