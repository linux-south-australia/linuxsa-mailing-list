Please forgive me if this has been said already but fairly recently
(within the last 2 months) Telstra have changed their policy regarding
folk on RIMs vs. ADSL.  When they receive an order for ADSL, they will
now automatically check to see if there are any spare copper pairs
running between the exchange and the RIM.

If there is, they will change your line over to the copper (thus
bypassing the RIM) and perform a line loss test, which, if passes will
result in the ADSL service being provisioned on your line.

My advice to anybody that has previously been rejected for being on a
RIM prior to around April/May, reapply as you may now be successful.  

Cheers,
Graham

&gt; 
&gt; I'm in a similar predicament, my phone line and all phone lines in the
&gt; street are on a sub-exchange which I think is like saying a RIMM. There
&gt; is no cable in my street and no time frame for either changing. I may
&gt; wait for untimed ISDN or there's supposed to be some upgrades coming in
&gt; September but Telstra aren't saying where.
