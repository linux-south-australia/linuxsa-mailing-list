<H1>Squid Auth. question</H1>

Hi All,
I've got a squid box that is doing auth against a Winnt server which works
fine as we are on DHCP.

But, several users are complaining (as they do) that it's too hard to hit an
OK box before surfing out.

My question is has anyone sucessfully got some kind of user accounting on
squid without having to actually log in every time. or at least having IE
completely cache the password so you don't need to press the old OK button
every time you open your browser.

for example i *think* (from memory, don't shoot me down in flames) that if a
M$not web proxy is setup for auth it goes though without any troubles and i
don't think it even asks for the uname/pword. like i said *think*. :)

I tried to get either dynamic WINS lookup of the machine name which would
suffice but that didn't seem to be supported. perhaps dynamic DNS lookup
may also be an option?
Regards
Matthew
