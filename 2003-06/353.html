I've already browsed through the archives and found various discussions on
OpenLDAP which seem to indicate that it is a bit unwieldy in it's current
form. Given that subscribers to LinuxSA are a bit more open minded than some
other forums I was hoping to get some more feedback on implementation and
management of Directory services.

My exposure to AD or any form of LDAP is non-existant, so I would be
starting with a fresh slate. Existing Network is NT4 based servers spread
nationally. The NT authentication is currently used for File permissions on
NTFS volumes and Internet Access through Squid. Some of the smaller
temporary offices do not currently have their own BDCs which can cause
issues with password changes etc. I am hoping to set up Linux boxes as local
file servers which Rysnc to a central location for file backup and was
looking for a solution that can be easily rolled out to all site offices and
synchronised.

Client machines are all Win based ( 95/98/NTWS/2K ). Client email is
predominantly Outlook 98/2000. There are currently no Global address books
and users either add a new staff member manually or use the intranet where
everyones email is listed. Total numbers of users is about 200-230.

I am fortunate in being able to implement open source solutions if they are
better and more flexable than commercial products which a lot of products
are ( Squid / Apache etc ). I've had suggestions from Linux advocates that
implementation of SAMBA/ OpenLDAP / RADIUS will enable us to remove all
traces of Windows as an Server environment but others have warned that it
might not be as easy as it sounds.

I really really REALLY don't want to go down the Microsoft Active Directory
path unless that is the " best option" --no flames...and would appreciate
comments from users who may have had to setup/administer both ?

It appears that LDAP ( in some form ) is becoming an essential tool for
managing users and resources and as such I really want to make sure the
solution that is implemented is the right one.
