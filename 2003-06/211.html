&gt; Yep, thanks for that.  I know about IP address range issues, stangely I
&gt; have that sorted out (through SMTP headed elsewhere as I have previously
&gt; mentioned):-)
&gt;
&gt; The error I thought was related to the email address, not the IP address
&gt; of the domain.   There are other errors returned by SpamAssassin related
&gt; to IP address ranges, hence why I thought this one was related to actual
&gt; domain or email address.
&gt;
&gt; Am I wrong?  Are there any SpamAssassin gurus out there?

SpamAssassin doesn't have much to do with it.  You can modify your own
SpamAssassin to ignore osirusoft, but that won't help get your main
delivered.  The only thing you can do there is to change the IP from
which you send mail, which probably involves changing your ISP.  In
view of the other problems you're having with this one, that might be
a good idea anyway.

I wonder how long it's going to be before people start suing osirusoft
in a big way..  In many cases, they're making false claims (samba.org
got hit recently), and they're definitely causing damage.
