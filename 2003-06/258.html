&gt;FreeBSD still has to be configured, unlike most linuxes which sorta fly

Well, I guess it would be nice if all my devices were autodetected, so 
yeah, I guess.  But in a certain way, it is just logical. I can't put my 
finger on it.

&gt;But FreeBSD has ports. Ports. Ports. Ports. Ports. Ports. Ports. :)
&gt;
I gather that the ports system eliminates the headache of dependencies 
and such.  That really makes a lot of sense. They really should do that 
with RPM's and make super RPM's in Linux.

 From what I have seen,  I am really wondering why Red Hat hasn't made a 
set of CD's with FreeBSD on it. Seems like if Debian can be used to make 
distributions such as Lindows or whatever, that FreeBSD would be just as 
easy, if not easier to use. I can imagine if SuSE made a boxed set, it 
would be really nice.

Nothing to do with SCO, but more to do with what I am imagining. My 
guess is that FreeBSD is not going through the tremendous development 
that Linux is. Some of the changes break things temporarily, or disable 
apps that worked before.

I also think that I am _just_ ready for FreeBSD, and FreeBSD will 
probably teach me a lot.  I think its going to be fun.

Now on available specialty applications, and random people that made 
drivers, I don't think I will find as many sources, but maybe I am wrong.

Ok, I had better go.
