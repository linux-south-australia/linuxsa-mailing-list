Hi All,

I'm having some issues with running multiple monitors on my machine. When I 
had Mandrake 9.0, using KDE 3.0 (can't recall exactly which version of 
XFree86 ... 4.something), it worked fine.
I've since upgraded to Mandrake 9.1 - from images taken from the 'Node mirror 
a couple of days ago.
Now I have KDE 3.1 and XFree86 4.3.0.. and a no longer working multiple 
monitor desktop.

What I have is:
1x  Cirrus Logic 5446 generic PCI 1Mb card running at 640x480 as my primary 
display (for reasons related to Windoze which i dual boot once every blue 
moon), connected to a Samsung SyncMaster 500s. Bus ID is PCI:0:5:0. This 
screen only really handles email, and checking a couple of website designs at 
this resolution.

1x nVidia GF4 MMX440SE AGP - 64Mb DDR running as a secondary at 1280x1024 as 
my secondary. This is connected to an LG Studioworks 700s.

The problem: I've had various problems depending on what I do to the 
XF86Config-4 file. At the moment the problem is that with both cards 
physically in the machine, KDE starts to load, but I get nothing but blank 
blue backgrounds on both screens, and nothing else happens.
If I take out the PCI card, KDE loads fine on my GF4, at the required 
resolution. Put the PCI card back, and the same problem occurs. 
I've spent some time playing around with this - and almost had it working - 
the displays were back the front (ie - the desktop for the primary monitor 
was showing on the secondary and vice versa, and the mouse pointer was stuck 
within the boundries of the secondary's screen). I went to change things 
around and then I get back to my hanging with two blue screens.

I've pasted a copy of XF86Config-4 below, so if anyone could point out exactly 
which bits I've got wrong, and tell me what they should be, it would be most 
appreciated. I've found a few other annoyances since the upgrade, but this 
one is a real pain. 

Cheers,
David
