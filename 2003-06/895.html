We just got an opteron server, boy is it a sweet box:

Dual opteron support (1 1.4GHz opteron installed)
6 dimm slots (1GB RAM installed)
PCI-X (or whatever that new fast PCI standard is)
on board scsi
serial-ata
2 raid controllers (4 120GB Maxtors installed)
2 network cards

It's got an insane number of fans inside the box, that thing is NOT 
overheating :) (it's as noisy as hell!)

I personally think AMD has a real winner with the opteron. You can get access 
to 64 bit address space without dropping all your current software (i.e. 
going to PPC64 or SPARC). The chip also has an onboard memory controller, and 
can do some special SMP stuff up to 8 CPU's (can't remember what, but it 
sounded cool).

We're currently running red hat 7.3 on it, but will probably get a 64bit linux 
distro when synopsys supports one (probably a new version of red hat advanced 
server or something, dunno).

I reckon Sun's days are numbered. Much cheaper and much more powerful 64 bit 
servers (per CPU anyway) running Linux. The only reason to have a Sun server 
would be for stuff &gt; 8 CPU's or so I imagine, where Sun scales well. I 
imagine that's a small market though.

And sure, if IBM can make the PPC970's economical enough, they'll do well on 
the server side too.. (is the G5 = PPC970? Or is it a different chip? The 
PPC970 looks _sweet_).

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; That is what I was thinking, but lately I've been wondering how long AMD
&gt; will last against Intel and other established vendors like Sun in the
&gt; high-end workstation market. It seems like they are betting the lot on
&gt; the success of x86-64, which I think is a big gamble. They don't seem to
&gt; be doing as well in the 32-bit market any more either.
&gt;
&gt; I think Apple is a lot more viable in the long term, so the G5 platform
&gt; seems to be the way forard for me.
