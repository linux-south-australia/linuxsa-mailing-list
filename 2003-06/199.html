    Hello ,
           can anybody tell me the advantages / disadvantages upgrading from mandrake 9.0 to 9.1 . Is it worth the change I have at present a system with Mandrake 9.0 that is working well I have no issues with it to speak of . 

Also out of interest what does "noarch" mean ?

Since i have installed 9.0 I have installed Xine patches , MPlayer and ogle for playing dvds , mpeg2 etc I had a few problems initially with Xine , ogle and Mplayer the following were my solutions for anybody that may have the same issues as I had

Xine would not play I only had a Blue screen instead of video display ogle had the same problem . To solve this I installed the Nvidia drivers and set up as per the docs I now have full twinview setup and this also fixed my overlay problem in both Xine and ogle . I have a asus gf4mx 440 vid card . 

The solution with MPlayer was there was a file missing from the rpms that I downloaded from the mplayer rpm site this I had to install the older mandrake 8.0 mplayer-common rpm save the font file that was missing uninstall the older rpm then install the updated rpms for mplayer and install the missing font file . There is a mplayer font rpm that is installed but this does not include the missing font.

With the nvidia driver installed i can get 200 fps in Q3 it is worth the trouble installing this driver it also gives twinview capability. A great program for setting up nvidia driver settings is Yanc 

Cheers

Peter Osmond
