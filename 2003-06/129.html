At the time, my friend was probably being the "selfless hero" and trying to 
help with little knowledge of what was to come, or what could possibly come. 

Now that I have Senior First Aid, there is some question of duty of care. I 
am a little unclear of who I have to help, and who I can leave alone, but I 
know that the moment I even stop to check on someone, I am obliged to help 
them to the furthest extent that I can, covered by my training and own 
physical abilities. 

I am sorry to say that it is probably easier to just not pay attention and 
keep walking past. I could never do this, regardless of the consequences, I 
would have to stop and help.

&gt; I was under the impression that "Good Samaritan" laws covered this loophole. Because we all remember the issue of a doctor making the choice to save or not save a person hit by a car.. if they are left to die then they can be sued (be relatives i guess), if the are "mostly" saved (like this swimming person you told about), they may also be able to sue... 
&gt; 
&gt; What is one to do...? 
&gt; 
&gt; AG. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I know the trends in this day and age, but I really hate, 
&gt;&gt; detest and loathe 
&gt;&gt; how people, out of the goodness of their hearts can go to the 
&gt;&gt; trouble to 
&gt;&gt; organise a cool event (as cool as this as going to be!) only 
&gt;&gt; to have it 
&gt;&gt; devastated by someone who would sue! sue! sue! It really is 
&gt;&gt; amazing how many 
&gt;&gt; people would do this to the closest of friends. You see it on 
&gt;&gt; TV all the 
&gt;&gt; time.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; A friend of mine and I have always been interested and involved in 
&gt;&gt; lifesaving. We have the relevant awards, qualifications, etc. 
&gt;&gt; He lives over 
&gt;&gt; in Queensland now. One time, he was at the beach, and 
&gt;&gt; attempted a rescue on 
&gt;&gt; a man who had got into trouble after jumping off a jetty. If 
&gt;&gt; he hadn't 
&gt;&gt; rescued him, the man would have died. However, the man had 
&gt;&gt; sustained spinal 
&gt;&gt; injuries from his jump, and these were aggravated by my 
&gt;&gt; friend's rescue, and 
&gt;&gt; the man lost his ability to walk. It was later proved that 
&gt;&gt; had the man been 
&gt;&gt; left, he would have drowned, but also would have retained his 
&gt;&gt; ability to 
&gt;&gt; walk. The original spinal injury was his fault, for jumping 
&gt;&gt; into shallow 
&gt;&gt; water from a jetty. With this behind him, he successfully 
&gt;&gt; sued my friend for 
&gt;&gt; some exorbetent amount. Fortunately, at the time, we were 
&gt;&gt; both teaching at 
&gt;&gt; swimming centres, and the insurance was still active. But 
&gt;&gt; which would you 
&gt;&gt; prefer? Dying and being able to walk or living and being 
&gt;&gt; unable to walk?  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It often puts alot of people off even considering organising 
&gt;&gt; something. Why 
&gt;&gt; can't people just appreciate what they get given?!? At least 
&gt;&gt; the licences on 
&gt;&gt; relevant software provide a little bit of a safe-haven for 
&gt;&gt; the programmers 
&gt;&gt; using them with their programs in the areas of warranty, etc.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If people do things that are their own fault, like jump off 
&gt;&gt; jetties into 
&gt;&gt; water shallower than their own height or stick their fingers in power 
&gt;&gt; outlets and get electrocuted, why should the person who comes 
&gt;&gt; to their aid, 
&gt;&gt; or the owner of the power outlet be penalised for someone 
&gt;&gt; else's stupid 
&gt;&gt; action?  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Sorry about all this, people. I just feel particularly 
&gt;&gt; strongly about this, 
&gt;&gt; and combining that with just waking up, I really needed to 
&gt;&gt; air my opinion on 
&gt;&gt; the matter. I hope it is relevant to some of you.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Speak to you all soon, and as always, I love listening to the 
&gt;&gt; interesting 
&gt;&gt; conversation that passes back and foward through this mailing list. 
&gt;&gt; Especially in the early hours of the morning... Should this 
&gt;&gt; boot camp go 
&gt;&gt; ahead, I will be there as quickly as I can pedal my bike! I 
&gt;&gt; would greatly 
&gt;&gt; enjoy such an event.

&gt;&gt; &gt; David, 
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is this a sleep over? Will dormitories/other sleeping 
&gt;&gt; arrangements be
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; required? Food? Drinks? Will you allow alcohol (it sounds 
&gt;&gt; like a good
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Alcohol, a few beers by the barby/laptop would be the go i'd say. 
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; idea until someone drops a jug of beer on George's new 
&gt;&gt; laptop? Do you
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; Get insurance - its worth it - believe me :) 
&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; need money sponsors? What happens if I get electrocuted at 
&gt;&gt; the party?
