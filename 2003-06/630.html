&gt; Their XML file format which is yet to be supported by their own
&gt; Office suite, and then only in the Professional or above versions.
&gt; Joe Average will still be using .MSXML format with their copy of
&gt; Word at home so if his workplace has Office Pro he still doesn't
&gt; make full use of the "open" standard...sigh...here's hoping industry
&gt; sees through M$'s marketing hype...

&lt;rant&gt;
When does the industry ever see through M$'s marketing hype?  If they
could see through it, there wouldn't be such a widespread abundance of
M$ crappy products everywhere.  The industry generally naive.  There may
be a select few of us who choose not to be ignorant of the real facts,
but the rest of the world doesn't share our view.  They just want
something that looks pretty, has gazillions of features (that they'll
never use anyway) and costs a lot (didn't you know $$$ == quality). M$
exploits that fact fully for its own profit.
