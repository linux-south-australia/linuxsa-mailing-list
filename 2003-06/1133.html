I don't think we really want a Unified Linux Distribution, we just want all 
Linux distributions to be able to work together and for all software to 
install and operate correctly on any of these distributions that conform to 
standards.

The whole reason I started thinking about this was because of the number of 
distributions based on Debian that can easily install software from Debian's 
apt-get repositories. Being based on a stable base allows this sort of thing 
to happen. I started thinking,  if Debian was the "official" linux that 
everybody based distributions on, then everybody could install software 
designed for it.

I think that "best practices" and standards are needed to ensure 
interopability and less headaches when working with various GNU/Linux 
systems. (And also to stop software from being developed for "Red Hat Version 
Y.X", and instead for "LSB compatible distribution version 1.3 or higher").

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; &gt; No I don't want to move user configs out of $HOME because it makes
&gt; &gt; administration harder. Often the /home partition is NFS mounted (or
&gt; &gt; at my Uni, /home/$USER is automounted via NFS on the file server
&gt;
&gt; This brilliantly demonstrates why one "perfect" unified Linux distro is a
&gt; pipe dream, IMHO.  The freedom of systems such as Linux won't ever allow
&gt; one single accepted way of doing things; everybody has their own concepts
&gt; of 'the right way', and you'll never, ever convince some people.
&gt;
&gt; That said, there are problems with the 5 billion distrib's out there all
&gt; doing things their own way; it's fortunate in some ways most flavours have
&gt; been based off some of the more mainstream ones (Redhat/Debian).  It's good
&gt; there are moves to unify things to some point, but some concepts seem way
&gt; too optimistic.
