&gt; I'd like to know if anyone on the list has an ISDN dial-up connection,

I replied from a different mail account before, and it got bounced by the 
list.  I'll take this opportunity to expand a bit.

I am one of the few (many) users that can't get ADSL at my place.  Funny that, 
because all I wanted was 128k, and they wouldn't even give me that, but I 
have 2x64k ISDN channels on the same cable... go figure.

I had 56k dialup for a long time.  Being some distance from the exchange, the 
line quality was average. My average 56k connection speed was 48k, and some 
times I got up to 50k.  I found I was experiencing a lot of dropouts and 
slowing down of the connection.  When I found out that I couldn't get ADSL, 
and that Tel$tra was offering a $99 connection to ISDN home I jumped on it.  
You end up with 2 digital phone lines into your premesis.  The installer 
wires the first back into the original analog wiring of your house, and 
installs a socket for the second, so your original house wiring continues to 
work as it always did.

I used my analog modem with that arrangement for a few months until I finally 
jumped ship and got a NetJet-S modem.  The 56k modem averaged 51.2k 
connections, and about 4 - 4.5k/sec download speeds.  I put in the NetJet 
modem, and it was recognised by the kernel (anything greater than 2.4.20 has 
the drivers as part of the kernel source.  Most distros have them available 
as modules). 

I put on the Traverse "dialisdn" script and configured it for my location by 
setting my local MSN and the dialup number (V8218...). "/etc/ppp/dialisdn 
start" brought up the connection first try.  There were a few issues with DNS 
not being assigned in the default script, but I soon jumped on them and now 
it works like a dream.

I use one channel (64k), and average around 8k/sec for downloads.  I don't 
have the dropout problem that I had with my analog modem, and I have two high 
quality digital phone lines to use.  I have some features that you usually 
pay extra for - caller ID being the one that springs to mind.  It actually 
works out the same price as having two phone lines installed anyway, but the 
installation price is significantly higher now.

I'd recommend ISDN if you're a high use net surfer.  If all you want to do is 
check mail and read /. then don't bother. Many ISPs that support dialup will 
support single channel DOV ISDN on exactly the same plan and pricing 
structure, so it doesn't work out any more expensive. I've found my total 
calls to Esc.Net has more than halved, because I don't get dropouts or failed 
dialout attempts anymore.

Hope this helps out.
Adam
