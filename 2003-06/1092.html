&gt; They were EOL'ed a few months ago.

I guess that explains why they are hard to find on the Sun website (hard, 
not impossible)... 

&gt;  
&gt;&gt; Anyone seen anything that can do this? I've looked at Webmin, and 
&gt;&gt; note that it appears to allow you to restrict access for individual 
&gt;&gt; users to individual virtual hosts, among other things. I shall look 
&gt;&gt; into this, but am wondering if there is much else around...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm the lead developer of a project called Qbalt
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.sf.net/projects/qbalt">http://www.sf.net/projects/qbalt</A>) - it's been quite heavily backed by many
&gt; Cobalt users / ex-developers, and I'm hoping a release will be *very* soon; a
&gt; huge amount of work has been done on the project, but I'm not releasing it
&gt; until its reasonably bug-free.

Nice. Top class idea. I would be interested in taking a look at it, if 
possible, and perhaps doing some testing and de-bugging... 

&gt; 
&gt; The aim of the project is to duplicate the 'appliance', but based on Debian;
&gt; its design results in a much more modular design, and its installable on both
&gt; current Cobalt hardware, and white boxes.  The interface is php based, but the
&gt; actual sysadmin/interface stuff is generated through completely customisable
&gt; XML; to cut a long story short, it essentially lets you both easily (like,
&gt; almost jokingly easy) write interface modules for any debian package you want
&gt; (and intergrating this nicely with the interface), and let you choose which
&gt; daemons you use - for example, you can have a choice of MTA, but the front
&gt; interface / what the user/administrator sees is exactly the same (perhaps with
&gt; more options if the XML definition file has it).

Sounds good. Does it have (or have plans for) the ability to delegate things 
like virtual domains, and email and dns records for individual accounts? 

&gt; 
&gt; The problem with projects like webmin is that they aren't designed as a
&gt; complete solution; they're designed to make particular administration tasks
&gt; easier.  They also make a complete mess of configuration files, and if you
&gt; make any changes yourself manually, they create an even bigger mess.

Yes, that's one of my objections... 

&gt; 
&gt; I don't know of anything out there that's free - there's Plesk, Ensim, and a
&gt; whole bunch of others, but they're commercial, and as far as I know, they
&gt; pretty much tie you in with the daemons/interface they give you, and you're
&gt; pretty much forced to use the interface.

Hmm... 

&gt; 
&gt; Wait a month or two; Qbalt should be in full swing by then and quite a viable
&gt; option...

I think I have a week to get a solution proposal in...
