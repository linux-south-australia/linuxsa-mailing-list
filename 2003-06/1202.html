Hello,

Okay I 've read a lot of discussion about this and now it's time to clear the 
air as to what my original proposal was (as it was in my head).

The most important objective is a structured and logical /etc directory with a 
single unified configuration file format. I have decided that being able to 
display said configuration files in a GUI is secondary and in fact I want to 
have a separate "layout" file so as to offer the GUI more flexibility and 
power without destroying the readability of the config file format. I think 
having a unified config file format and logical directory structure greatly 
simplifies writing a GUI program for configuring the system anyway, so we get 
that added benefit for free.

Simple configuration files and scripts need not be altered in this new system, 
e.g. "hosts, hosts.allow, etc" should be able to keep their current format 
because it is so simple (and maybe we should leave "termcap" the hell alone 
:). A program parsing the /etc tree will ignore such special files (and any 
other files that don't appear to be of the correct format).

I don't believe having a consistent and easy to understand configuration 
layout is "training wheels" or going to create "inferior" System 
Administrators. I think what it could do is make an unecessarily complex and 
illogical system easier to learn and remember. It's about making a system 
more accessible, not "dumbing it down" or making it any less powerful.

The separation of Administrator-modified configuration files and the default 
files installed by the system makes sense to me. But having it in two totally 
different locations doesn't, e.g. "/etc and /usr/local/etc". Forgetting about 
Unix history for a moment and stepping outside of the box, if you were to 
design the filestructure from scratch, where would you place these two 
directories?

I'll put my 2 cents in:

/system/conf - contains all configuration data (could call it config I guess)
/system/defaults/conf - contains default settings 

But anyway, I didn't want to redesign the whole Unix filesystem (other people 
are trying to do that). I just want some structure to the /etc tree to make 
configuration easier :)

So here are my revised goals:

1. Design a logical directory structure within the /etc directory.
   - it must be fairly simple for somebody to look through that directory to 
find something without resorting to "locate" or "find".
2. Design a unified configuration file format.
  - This format must be simple enough to be easily understood by somebody 
without them having to refer to a manual (by referring to a manual, I mean a 
manual describing the syntax, not the configuration options presented 
within).
  - All configuration files will have a common extension so they can easily be 
seen as such (e.g: .conf).
3. Design a simple (probably xml-based) layout file that allows an application 
to display (graphically) the configuration options for a program.
  - The file format should be fairly easy to understand, but referring to a 
manual in order to write one will be necessary (and possibly to read one and 
understand it fully).
  - It should allow some interpretation by the GUI program so that all 
configuration dialogs look consistent. The layout file shouldn't specify 
things like "rectangle,200,200", but should just group configuration 
variables and specify the type of value they take (like in a programming 
language), amongst other things (such as a "display name", visibility, etc 
etc). 
    - The reason for these layout files is so that packages can describe 
enough about their configuration options to allow it to be displayed 
graphically without the graphical application having to specifically know 
about said software package.


I believe something like this could be done if it is managed in stages:

1) Discourage hard-coding paths to configuration files so that configuration 
files can be placed wherever the user pleases. Application accesses these 
files through a library "say libetc, or libconfig".
  - Devise a fast-lookup method for finding the configuration files fast by 
using a cache and/or a pre-defined filepath and/or some other means (similar 
to how the linker looks up library files).
  - At this stage applications can keep their own configuration file formats 
and must parse the file themselves. However, the naming of these files and 
their location can now be controlled without breaking the application.

2) Devise configuration file format and create a parser and API for this 
format for applications to use. This functionality becomes part of the 
existing library as created in step 1.
 - Encourage people to use the library if they can and to file feature 
requests if they cant.

3) Create layout file format and sample application that can parse the etc 
tree and provide a GUI for config files that have an accompanying layout 
file.
- Enourage people to package layout files as part of their software 
distribution so as to ease administration.

4) ???

5) Profit!! :)

Somewhere in those stages the layout of the /etc directory and the format of 
the configuration/layout files should be attempted to be made a standard 
(LSB) so as to encourage people to follow it.

For all those that say "the current system is fine once you know it", I say 
how does that make the current system the best possible? How can we make 
progress if we stay stationary? (and if you say "if it aint broke don't fix 
it", I'm going to scream :) It *IS* broke :)

Cheers,

Damien
