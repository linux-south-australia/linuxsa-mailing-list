&gt; Technology: Microsoft Leader Tells Workers of I.B.M.-Linux Threat
&gt; NYT
&gt; By STEVE LOHR
&gt; In a long e-mail message to Microsoft employees,
&gt;  Steven A. Ballmer singled out International Business 
&gt; Machines as the company's chief corporate rival.

Ian,

They're saying on ABC NewsRadio that the "rivals of Microsoft"
have had sudden increases in share price, including VA software
and Redhat, I believe. I didn't quite get all the company names.
A BBC world service item said that other companies in the US
are now trying to get mentioned as a danger to Microsoft too,
to help their share prices. (The BBC tries to spice up their
otherwise stodgy reporting with a few minor sillinesses.)
I can't find any trace of this share price rise story on the net.
The BBC world service woman used the pronunciation line-ucks. Grrr...

Anyway, time for breakfast.
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. By the way, a close friend of mine who normally has no desire to
leave MS has told me that their household is converting their
two PCs from MS to linux - because they're tired of getting hacked
by worms and viruses. The last one was the last straw apparently.
It's interesting to see the revolution happening in microcosm.

PPS. I changed my on-linuxSA e-mail address slightly because I received
a spam to my linuxSA-only e-mail address - indicating that it arose
from a spambot reading linuxSA archives. The spam was an invitation to
a sex party in Sydney. Now if it had been in Adelaide....
