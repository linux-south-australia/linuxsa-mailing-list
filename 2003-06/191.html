&gt; Yep, thanks for that.  I know about IP address range issues, stangely I
&gt; have that sorted out (through SMTP headed elsewhere as I have
&gt; previously mentioned):-)
&gt;
&gt; The error I thought was related to the email address, not the IP
&gt; address of the domain.   There are other errors returned by
&gt; SpamAssassin related to IP address ranges, hence why I thought this one
&gt; was related to actual domain or email address.
&gt;
&gt; Am I wrong?  Are there any SpamAssassin gurus out there?


I had to deal with a customer that was being bounced today. They are in
Malaysia, and their ISP is a know spam source according to SPEWS.

The SMTP report they get back shows a recipient address failure first,
followed by a somewhat similar message to the one you have:

Email sent from my new email address, <A HREF="mailto:michael@msdavies.net">michael@msdavies.net</A> is being
reported by SpamAssassin as "SPAM: X_OSIRU_SPAM_SRC   (3.0 points)  RBL:
DNSBL: sender is Confirmed Spam Source".


I think you will find that the IP address you have is in the spam range
identified in SPEWS, and probably other RBL lists. Spamassasin cannot help
you here, unless you want to manually go to everyone who is using the RBL
features and whitelist your domain on their machines...

Of course, you are only picking up 3.0 points for that, you should be able
to control your message content to keep it under 5.0 and thereby avoid
incorrect spam detection in most cases. Can you get hold of the full
SpamAssasin report?

Regards,


Michael
