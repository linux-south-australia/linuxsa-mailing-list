&gt; &gt;2) Unified reference distribution that augments the LSB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;- Not a distribution in the common sense, but a specification for a 
&gt; &gt;distribution.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; YES!!
&gt; 
&gt; There should be a coalition of major players in the free software 
&gt; community that form a standards board. In accounting we have the 
&gt; "Financial Accounting Standards Board"; my enginering friend tells me 
&gt; that he has something similar.

As Richard pointed out the LSB Sample Implementation does what I think
Damien is asking for. Its built from source using Linux From Scratch's
ALFS software so you can see the various patches and compile flags
used. Note that its a "sample implementation" not a "reference
implementation" - where the sample implementation contradicts the
specification, the specification is the authorative source.

As for a standards body, there is the "Free Standards Group"
(<A HREF="http://www.freestandards.org">http://www.freestandards.org</A>), which has a number of workgroups -
eg. the LSB, internationalization, LANANA. The FSG is a community
driven, non profit organisation.

A lot of what has been discussed is covered by the File Hierarchy
Standard (included by the LSB), which is currently undergoing review
for a v2.3 release.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; There needs to be a group that is accepted by the comunity at large to 
&gt; set these standards.
&gt; 
&gt; And the standard MUST NOT be Linux specific.

Contrary to its name, the LSB is not intended to be exclusively Linux
specific. The intent is to allow other operating systems to be capable
of being LSB compliant. We've had input from other operating system
developers into the LSB specification.

&gt; Now, how do we get a respected and recognized body in place?

Its already there :-)
