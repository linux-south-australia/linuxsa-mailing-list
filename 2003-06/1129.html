&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt; &gt;Why would you want private variables in a config file in the first place?
&gt; &gt; I can't think of any instance where a current config file has real
&gt; &gt;non-user-modifiable information...
&gt;
&gt; Then I would have...
&gt;
&gt;                          /config/user/joe
&gt;                          /config/user/jack
&gt;                         /config/user/name-of-user
&gt;                          /config/admiin
&gt;
&gt; instead of...
&gt;
&gt;                          /config

No I don't want to move user configs out of $HOME because it makes 
administration harder. Often the /home partition is NFS mounted (or at my 
Uni, /home/$USER is automounted via NFS on the file server whenever you 
login). Having user configs on the local machine smells like how Windows2k 
does it ("Documents and Settings/$USER"), which I don't like at all.

The reason I was talking about private variables is to ease the clutter of the 
GUI (by not having too many options displayed by default), and also to allow 
the application to store information about itself that is not really meant to 
be modified by a user (e.g. paths shouldn't need to be changed). e.g. look at 
xcdroast.conf:

#
# X-CD-Roast V0.98alpha10 Configuration-File
#
# Automatically created by the X-CD-Roast-Setup
# Don't edit! (Unless you REALLY know what you are doing)
#
...

This warning was my reason for wanting private areas, perhaps other programs 
are similar?

I like your idea about keeping the boot scripts in /boot... but I think we 
should keep /etc as radical changes will never be accepted by anybody :) 
(though my suggestion is a pretty radical change, perhaps keeping /etc will 
make people still feel at home). That's why you see people trying to redesign 
the Linux filesystem layout and not getting a whole lot of support. People 
seem to want difficult to type names with capitals and spaces in them, which 
is no good for doing things via the command line, who wants to type

$ cd Documents\ and\ Settings/

Making sure to get the capital letters correct, etc..

I don't think typing

$ cd /etc/system/services/samba
$ vi smb.conf

is too much. However tools could be created to ease this. I said in an earlier 
email that libetc would be capable of searching the /etc tree for config 
files (either via cache, or search-path just like the linker does when 
linking to libraries). Tools could be created that use libetc to make finding 
configuration files easier, e.g.:

$ cfgedit smb.conf

here cfgedit parses the /etc tree and finds smb.conf, then it opens it up in 
the configured default editor (vi probably, but anything else could be set, 
pico even).

But because the system is now "smart" and managed by software, you could use 
aliases so you could simply type:

$ cfgedit samba

This is more oriented to what you really want to do, and that is edit the 
configuration for the samba service. This is even easier than the current 
system where you would type:

$ vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

That requires knowledge of where samba is and what it calls it's configuration 
file. Relying on this is no good because everything is stored hap-hazardly 
throughout the /etc directory. If you wanted to edit proftpd, you would type:

$ vi /etc/proftpd.conf

So why doesn't proftpd have it's own directory?

What if you want to edit xdm?

$ vi /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config

The naming convention for the file isn't even consistent!

Maybe you could have other tools for managing the configuration files, e.g:

$ cfgfind samba

returns the path to the samba config file

$ cfgbackup

backs up the current configuration state of the system, perhaps in /etc/backup

$ cfgrestore

restores the last backed up configuration

$ cfgdeploy [config] &lt;HOST&gt;

synchronises the configuration of this server with HOST, over ssh (where the 
optional option "config" is the name of a configuration, e.g. "cfgdeploy 
samba 192.168.0.3" will synchronise the configuration of samba with host 
192.168.0.3 - it may even have an option to restart/start/stop the service on 
that host in the one command).

etc etc

Cheers,

Damien

&gt;
&gt; With /config/user/username being writeable by $username
&gt;
&gt; You want this because you want users and administrators to know that
&gt; configuration files are ALWAYS in the same place.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Have you seen debconf?
&gt;
&gt; I want uniformity....
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Whatever format you want to use (I'll choose XML here),
&gt;
&gt; My uneducated comment is this: when I think of XML I think of Open
&gt; Office, and when I think of Open Office, I think slow...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;the idea would be
&gt; &gt;that the config files would override the defaults. IE if you copied the
&gt; &gt;default file verbatim, you would get a perfectly valid config file, with
&gt; &gt;default settings. Likewise, if you removed the config file entirely, or
&gt; &gt; had an empty one, the system would just use the defaults.
&gt;
&gt; Two comments:
&gt;
&gt; The first is...if its "Unix" I would think the program should not
&gt; function without a configuration file, because the program should lack
&gt; configuration information alltogether.
&gt;
&gt; But I like the idea.
&gt;
&gt; What annoys me about all of the security crap going around is that it
&gt; renders the default setups unusable. Like that cups web browser thing.
&gt; Making the user log in as root wasn't good enough, they had to make the
&gt; web browser only accessible by the local user - which makes their work
&gt; rather pointless - most distributions supply a print set up wizzard, so
&gt; the only use for the cups web page is to use it remotely.
&gt;
&gt; And that being so fundamental, the instructions for correcting the
&gt; problem should be clear and easy to find and in BOLD TYPE.
