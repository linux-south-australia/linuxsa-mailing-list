&gt;   - RedHat's CUPS RPMs appear to ship with support for PAM
&gt; authentication. Is this a RedHat-added-some-patches thing, or is it
&gt; possible to have CUPS use PAM for all of it's authentication?

See the original source at

&lt;<A HREF="http://cvs.easysw.com/cvsweb.cgi/cups/scheduler/auth.c?rev">http://cvs.easysw.com/cvsweb.cgi/cups/scheduler/auth.c?rev</A>=1.70&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&logsort=cvs&gt;

which shows that PAM is in the mainline code (with support for Linux, Sun and
HPUX).

&gt;   - the lpadmin utility allows you to grant / deny access to certain
&gt; printers by certain users. Does this access control only apply to the
&gt; administration of that printer, or is it possible to have users
&gt; authenticated when printing through a printer

The insight you need is that IPP printing protocol used by CUPs
works using URLs, there are differing URLs for printing and admin,
and CUPS' access controls effect access to URLs.

So you can have differing policies for ipp:/printers/...
URLs and a ipp:/admin/... URLs, using pretty much the same
syntax in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf as in Apache.

Access control is described in the manual.

&gt;   - Is it the case that the page count per job is calculated based on
&gt; part of the postscript that is the print job and that a different
&gt; something-&gt;postscript filter (say, printing from a Windows box) might
&gt; make it hard/impossible for CUPS to tally the number of pages printed?

CUPS has a good modular design, so you can check this easily
if you have some PostScript you want to test (in test.ps):

   /usr/lib/cups/filters/pstops "1" "root" "Test" "1" "" &lt; test.ps

and look for the last "PAGE:" written to stderr.

The filter protocol used by CUPS is in the documentation,
including the accounting protocol (the PAGE messages
to stderr).

CUPS isn't as good as LPD-NG.  It sends a job to get
the  NVRAM page count (PostScript printers can send
text back to the computer), sends the user's print job,
and sends a job to get the page count again.
This has the advantage of always working, no matter how
tricky the PostScript or even if the user has pressed
the Job Cancel button on the printer itself.
