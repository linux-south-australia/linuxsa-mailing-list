 &gt; Confused?  How can any logic be stated for not having cross platform

We're not talking about cross-platform compatibility;  We're talking
about the ability to upgrade a UNIX Operating System installation 
without accidentally overwriting/deleting all your painstakingly
hand-customized configuration files and applications.  The OS knows
it's not supposed to go near /usr/local, the sysadmins know they 
shouldn't go near /usr, everything is simple and clear-cut.  So an
OS upgrade becomes a 20 minute exercise which can be safely carried
out with all the heavily modified parts of the system unmounted,
switched off, or otherwise inaccessible.

Linux destroyed that concept, of course.  Upgrading is a nightmare.
Who -hasn't- had all the virtual severs set up in their Apache config
blown away during a Linux upgrade because the distribution thought 
it "owned" httpd.conf...?

The other thing you get from using /usr/local for optional add-ons
is the ability to mount /usr read-only (with /usr/local coming from
a different filesystem mounted separately).  This is an obvious 
big win for security-sensitive applications (where your read-only
/usr contains the OS, which becomes immutable), and for diskless 
workstations (where a single /usr can be shared among dozens of clients
secure in the knowledge that none of them will attempt to modify it).
Applications get installed in a per-client /opt or /usr/local, and
everything on the rest of the system except /tmp, /home and /etc is
read-only.
