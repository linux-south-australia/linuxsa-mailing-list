Hi All,
    I don't know if it has been tested since, however as I recall about 2-3
(maybe longer) years ago when this came out, I contacted the Trade Practices
Commission (or whatever they call themselves now) and asked if this was
legal. According to them - it isn't, but they have not so far taken any
action. The reason that they had not taken any action was (in the words of
the person I spoke to - unofficially and off the record and not legally
binding in court), that apparently these sorts of things were not pursued
unless there was a groundswell of claims or that there was a blatant
flaunting of the Law that had some significant potential of blowing out or
it affected a significant proportion of the population. In his off the
record opinion, of the 5% of the population who use Linux (or any other OS
OS) and of the (maybe) 10% of those who use Toshiba Laptops, only a very
small proportion of those were interested in pursuing the matter. His advice
was basically either get a whole bunch of people making noise about it to
them AND Toshiba or try a small claim for breach of contract or whatever the
appropriate point of Law was (I forget as it was a while ago). If you tried
a small claim, Toshiba could not bring any Lawyers into it at all, just you
and a company Rep, and you could sue them for the sum involved (OEM License
is about $150) plus any costs incurred up to $1000 total claim. Basically
Toshiba were/are hiding behind peoples laziness of pursuing the matter and
trying to frighten them off and not pay if they threatened any other type of
legal action. I am not sure if it was you or someone else, but someone who
has talked about this in the last few days said they were a lawyer and would
be willing to test it so why not start a class action and pursue it, it
could be worthwhile. At least check up on the current state of the Law and
see if it is viable.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: [OT] Toshiba and bundled software


&gt; I know Geoffrey and possibly others have managed to obtain a refund from
&gt; Toshiba/Microsoft for their bundled copy of Windows by not accepting the
&gt; Windows license agreement and returning the software as suggested in the
&gt; EULA.
&gt;
&gt; I just unboxed a brand new Toshiba notebook and found a big yellow
&gt; sticker reading:
&gt;
&gt; "IMPORTANT NOTICE
&gt;
&gt; The software products pre-installed on or bundled with your computer are
&gt; copyrighted works.  Before opening this package, please read the license
&gt; agreement furnished with the computer.  By opening this package and
&gt; turning on the computer, you indicated that you have read and accepted
&gt; these software license terms.  In order to maintain the highest quality
&gt; standards under the Toshiba brand name, TOSHIBA committed to delivering
&gt; computing solutions to the customer as a total PC system.
&gt; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the documentation
&gt; accompanying your computer, TOSHIBA does not accept the return of
&gt; components parts, or bundled software, which have been removed from the
&gt; PC system.  Pro-rata refunds on individual PC components or bundled
&gt; software, including the operating system, will not be granted.  If you
&gt; wish to return a complete PC system, contact the TOSHIBA dealer where
&gt; you purchased the product, and comply with the dealer's standard return
&gt; policies and procedures."
&gt;
&gt; Looks like you'll be stuck with your Windows license next time (assuming
&gt; you still want to buy a Toshiba, that is.)
&gt;
