&gt; 1) Can I do a similar thing with GRUB?

Yes.

   $ grub

   grub&gt; md5crypt
   Password: ********
   $1$U$JK7xFegdxWH6VuppCUSIb.
   grub&gt; quit

Now put that string your /boot/grub/menu.lst file,
before the first "title" line.

   password --md5 $1$U$JK7xFegdxWH6VuppCUSIb.

Now people will need to provide a password before they
can alter the boot seqeuence in a "title" clause.

If you have a "title" clause which boots into single
user mode then you should have a line which says "lock"
immediately after "title".

&gt; 2) If I followed these steps would it really make the system secure 
&gt; against local hacking?

There's actually a long list of things you need to do to
make the console secure:

  - Change the BIOS boot order to boot from hard disk
    first.

  - Add a BIOS configuration change password (and
    make sure it works, some motherboards need a
    jumper change).

  - Add a boot loader password.

  - Make the boot loader prompt for a password on
    booting to single user mode.

  - Disable the "Magic SysRq key".  Add
       kernel.sysrq = 0
    to /etc/sysctl.conf

  - Disable any "interactive startup" options.  On
    RHL alter /etc/sysconfig/init to
       PROMPT=no

  - Think about appropiate behaviour for Ctrl-Alt-Del
    and alter /etc/inittab if needed.  Useful choices
    are to do nothing, reboot or shut down.

  - Think about disabling the Ctrl-Alt-Backspace XWindows
    restart key (see /etc/X11/XFree86Config).  If you
    have a locked screen this allows someone to get
    back to a username/password login prompt.  That
    might be desired, or might be deeply undesirable.

  - Think about virtual consoles.  You might not want
    to have these on computer lab machines (it's far
    too easy to forget to log out of a virtual console
    session after logging out from another virtual
    console).  See /etc/inittab.

And of course the BIOS, boot loader and Linux passwords
all had better be good.

You can probably defeat these measures by opening the
box.  Fortunately, this is hardest on laptops, which are
the systems which need the most protection from nasty
people at the console.

Box openers could simply remove an IDE cables, so that
the box boots from the next device in the boot order
list.  Or they could move the "BIOS password enabled"
jumper. Basically, if people can open the box the game
is over.

I'm slack, so I normally just put a big mother of a
cable tie thorugh the loops intended for a padlock
(you'll find that most "corporate" style machines
have some way to stop the lid from being opened).
There are obviously better ways, ranging from
padlocks to safes, depending on your environment.
