&gt; I know, sounds pathetic.
&gt;
&gt; But its pretty exciting for me, its my first day!

And tomorrow you can install mutt!

&gt; Looks pretty good, very logical installer.

Heh.  We've been talking about that for years.

&gt; Whoever offered me the advice to assume that the X configuration
&gt; worked although it said failed, that was the key for me.

Hmm.  I didn't know about that.  Which version did you install?

&gt; Now I took the most conservative setting for X and I just want to
&gt; copy the Xf86config file I saved on a floppy to wherever it goes. I
&gt; think I will guess that /etc/fstab uses /dev/fd0...

Depends on the release.  I think 4.8 still uses /dev/fd0c.

&gt; Ok, now I am going to log out and go in as root and edit fstab with
&gt; emacs. I have to add my floppy so I can copy over the xf86config
&gt; file from linux.
&gt;
&gt; I tried to use su, but it says "sorry"

You can log in directly as root without being in /etc/group
(obviously).

&gt; I also never realized that you have to start X before running
&gt; startkde.

You should have a .xinitrc file in your home directory.  The last line
should be 'startkde'.  For example, this is what I have in my .xinitrc
for KDE:

   kbdcontrol &lt;/dev/ttyv0 -r fast		Set keyboard rate
   xset m 6 2					Set mouse rate
   xrdb -load .Xdefaults			Load defaults (if you have them)
   xmodmap .xremap				Map ctrl and alt keys as God intended
   startkde					Start KDE

.xremap looks like this:

   keysym Alt_L = Meta_L Meta_L
   remove Lock = Caps_Lock
   remove Control = Control_L
   remove Mod1 = Meta_L
   keysym Control_L = Meta_L
   keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
   add Mod1 = Meta_L
   add Control = Control_L

It puts Ctrl next to A, Alt in the bottom left corner, and CapsLock to
the left of the space bar.  I believe there are more modern ways to do
this nowadays, but this has worked for me for 10 years, so I'm not
fixing it.
