Hey,

I installed FreeBSD 5.0 a few months ago, just to play with another Unix-like 
system. After stuffing for ages to get my Diamond Touch keyboard to work 
(needed to set a flag in the bootloader for the installer, and also 
permanently once installed), it was actually pretty easy to install. I 
completely failed at trying to set Debian up, but FreeBSD 5 was a breeze 
(come one FreeBSD guys! How are you supposed to be 1337 if it's not even hard 
to install FreeBSD :^). 

Some of the things I like about FreeBSD:

- Fast boot and fast shutdown. It takes about 5 seconds to shutdown the 
machine from a running KDE. Boot time on my box is about 23 seconds to get to 
login, then another 12 seconds to load KDE (35 seconds total boot time to 
useable system). Mandrake is 65 seconds (loads a lot more services though, 
e.g. Samba)!!

- The ports collection! I installed opera web browser for FreeBSD from the 
ports collection, and my jaw almost hit the ground when it automagically 
installed FreeBSD 4.x backwards compatibility libraries. I didn't even have 
to think about binary compatibility (if I hadn't have read the messages I 
would never have noticed). I didn't like how it used fetch instead of wget 
though, wget is superior IMO.

- The FreeBSD handbook. NEVER have I seen more up to date and thorough 
documentation for anything in my life. I had ZERO problems setting up 
everything to work really well (ttf fonts, wheelmouse, whatever). Very very 
cool.

- The people on #freebsd are nicer than on #linux (i've been banned from 
#linux channels so many times it's not funny, and for doing _nothing_).

That said, I've hardly booted it since I got it working. I'm quite content on 
Mandrake Linux 9.1 (which has more up to date software, I'm not about to 
download and compile everything through ports on a 56k modem connection). 
Also Linux has better sound drivers, doesn't make xmms stutter whilst doing 
things like compiling, etc... and well, all the software that runs on top of 
FreeBSD is the same as on Linux, so once FreeBSD is running, it is no 
different (in fact you could easily forget you were even using FreeBSD).

So whilst it's a very good system and has a lot going for it, I can't see any 
reason for me to switch to it from Linux. I'd probably consider it for a 
server though.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; I know, sounds pathetic.
&gt;
&gt; But its pretty exciting for me, its my first day!
&gt;
&gt; Looks pretty good, very logical installer.
&gt;
&gt; Whoever offered me the advice to assume that the X configuration worked
&gt; although it said failed, that was the key for me.
&gt;
&gt; Now I took the most conservative setting for X and I just want to copy the
&gt; Xf86config file I saved on a floppy to wherever it goes. I think I will
&gt; guess that /etc/fstab uses /dev/fd0...
&gt;
&gt; Ok, now I am going to log out and go in as root and edit fstab with emacs.
&gt; I have to add my floppy so I can copy over the xf86config file from linux.
&gt;
&gt; I tried to use su, but it says "sorry"
&gt;
&gt; Is uh...FreeBSD LSB compliant?
&gt;
&gt; :D Hey, I am just kidding. I am just joking because I am happy to be using
&gt;
&gt; this.
&gt;
&gt; I also never realized that you have to start X before running startkde.
&gt;
&gt; Happy to be in FreeBSD!
