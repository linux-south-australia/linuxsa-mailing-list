&gt;&gt; Not everybody uses NFS... ;-)
&gt;
&gt; NFS environments are the ones that stand to benefit the most from 
&gt; standardisation, giving choice back to the users of the network rather 
&gt; than forcing a standard OS on everyone. 

I take your word about NFS, but I think there would me multiple 
interested parties in the discussion.  The way I see it, is that end 
users are, for lack of a better word, forced to use the configuration 
file supplied by an application, and that file usually goes in /etc. 
 Changing /ect to /config doesn't strike me as being forced any more 
than /etc is already.

&gt; Google tells me that it was Henry Spencer who said:
&gt; "Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly".

I hate to say this, but some parts of Unix really aren't very logical at 
all.  Ergo, I don't know what there is to misunderstand; but I know what 
can be mis-memorized.  :-P  :-D

&gt; I think that if you compare the longevity of the present unix way of 
&gt; doing things with the number of times MS have changed the GUI 

The file structure is most important to me. I am not advocating a Unix 
registry or even a GUI really.[1]

I could be wrong, but I was under the impression that Microsoft's 
configuration philosophy is that of a registry. Unix' philosophy is that 
of using configuration files most commonly stored in /etc.  All I want 
to do is change a name, but not the fundamental philosophy of Unix's 
configuration structure.

&gt; and configuration methods in a third of the time (and possibly the 
&gt; number of times Redhat configuration GUI's have changed in a third of 
&gt; that time..), you might get some value out of Henry's statement :)


[1] GUI  (n) Frosting made up of whipped training wheel grease and food 
coloring, smeared on a cake. :-D
