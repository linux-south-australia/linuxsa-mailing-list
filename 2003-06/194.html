&gt; &gt; this is the problem with linux - the average user shouldn't have to

Au contraire!

One *could* argue that a user *should* need to know about these before
trying to configure a firewall (ie average users shouldn't be fooled
into thinking they know what they are doing when configuring a
firewall). Of course, as others have said, there are options that allow
people to acheive some sort of firewall without any knowledge on linux
too... Of course, I do not intend to argue that, but one *could*, if one
wanted to.

I'm not a RedHat user or fan, but I am pretty sure that this command
will actually leave your system completely unprotected by packet
filtering. Of course, RedHat does tend to use these irritating things
like "service blah stop" and so on, which serves to confuse everything,
make you not know quite what it is you are doing, and make people who
know how to use RedHat incapable of sitting at any other *nix box and
know how to stop or start a service... sigh.

Also, a pedantic, and probably unimportant technicality -- ipchains and
iptables don't actually run as processes, per se. They are kernel
modules. When I first started out trying to do firewalls, I was looking
for a process called "ipchains" or something similar, and was very
frustrated by the fact that I couldn't find it to kill it.
