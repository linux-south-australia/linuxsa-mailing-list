I know the trends in this day and age, but I really hate, detest and loathe 
how people, out of the goodness of their hearts can go to the trouble to 
organise a cool event (as cool as this as going to be!) only to have it 
devastated by someone who would sue! sue! sue! It really is amazing how many 
people would do this to the closest of friends. You see it on TV all the 
time. 

A friend of mine and I have always been interested and involved in 
lifesaving. We have the relevant awards, qualifications, etc. He lives over 
in Queensland now. One time, he was at the beach, and attempted a rescue on 
a man who had got into trouble after jumping off a jetty. If he hadn't 
rescued him, the man would have died. However, the man had sustained spinal 
injuries from his jump, and these were aggravated by my friend's rescue, and 
the man lost his ability to walk. It was later proved that had the man been 
left, he would have drowned, but also would have retained his ability to 
walk. The original spinal injury was his fault, for jumping into shallow 
water from a jetty. With this behind him, he successfully sued my friend for 
some exorbetent amount. Fortunately, at the time, we were both teaching at 
swimming centres, and the insurance was still active. But which would you 
prefer? Dying and being able to walk or living and being unable to walk? 

It often puts alot of people off even considering organising something. Why 
can't people just appreciate what they get given?!? At least the licences on 
relevant software provide a little bit of a safe-haven for the programmers 
using them with their programs in the areas of warranty, etc. 

If people do things that are their own fault, like jump off jetties into 
water shallower than their own height or stick their fingers in power 
outlets and get electrocuted, why should the person who comes to their aid, 
or the owner of the power outlet be penalised for someone else's stupid 
action? 

Sorry about all this, people. I just feel particularly strongly about this, 
and combining that with just waking up, I really needed to air my opinion on 
the matter. I hope it is relevant to some of you. 

Speak to you all soon, and as always, I love listening to the interesting 
conversation that passes back and foward through this mailing list. 
Especially in the early hours of the morning... Should this boot camp go 
ahead, I will be there as quickly as I can pedal my bike! I would greatly 
enjoy such an event.

&gt;&gt; Is this a sleep over? Will dormitories/other sleeping arrangements be
&gt;&gt; required? Food? Drinks? Will you allow alcohol (it sounds like a good

&gt; Alcohol, a few beers by the barby/laptop would be the go i'd say. 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; idea until someone drops a jug of beer on George's new laptop? Do you
