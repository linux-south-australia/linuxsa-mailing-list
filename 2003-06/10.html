&gt; &gt; Hi all,

&gt; Hi Richard (replying to my own post :)

Me again,

Further to the comparison, there are a few other major differences
that I didn't mention -- focussing on "Linux" vs "FreeBSD" rather
than "gentoo" vs "FreeBSD".

Both appear to have a stateful firewall, though I am not familiar
enough with freebsd's ipf and ipfw to be sure quite how to use them, 
or what the difference between them actually is. Certainly, on
initial inspection, they appear equivalent to iptables in
functionality. If anyone has found a decent comparison, I'd be keen
to see it.

Linux has better FS support -- or rather, more options. It has a
journalling filesystem (or three -- ext3, reiserfs, XFS, with JFS to
come, as I understand). FreeBSD has ufs with Soft Updates, which, as
far as I can tell, appears to provide pretty much the same sort of
bonuses anyway.

FreeBSD has two levels of partitioning -- the DOS Primary partitions,
which FreeBSD calls slices, and the FreeBSD partitions, within those
slices (sort of like DOS Extended, but not readable by much else). So
an IDE disk might be /dev/ad0, and the DOS partitions (FreeBSD slices)
might be ad0s1, ad0s2, ad0s3 and ad0s4, and the FreeBSD partitions
(located in ad0s2, say), might be ad0s2a, ad0s2d, ad0s2e and ad0s2f.
Disks are numbered, slices are numbered, and partitions are lettered.

SMP is rumoured to be more mature and faster under Linux, though
this doesn't matter much to me anyway. I understand that FreeBSD
5.0 brings major improvements, though I don't know if that means
it's equal to Linux.

Software-wise, there is little to choose between them. They both have
vast amounts of software, most of which will compile natively under
either. FreeBSD also has a Linux emulation layer, which enables it
to run Linux binaries if need be -- and I understand it does this
with no performance penalty. Commercial software probably enjoys more
support under Linux, but I doubt that gentoo would be considered
supported by most vendors.

FreeBSD's console doesn't have the ability to scroll, at least, it's
not set up to do so by default.

The FreeBSD MBR is particularly simple, and I haven't yet found any
place to configure it. The bootloader itself seems similar to an
OpenPROM, in that it gives you an OK prompt, and allows you to do basic
things like boot -v and so on.

Both have a devfs system.

FreeBSD names devices after their drivers -- eg fxp0 is the first Intel
EtherExpress Pro 10/100 device, whereas rl0 is the first Realtek 
8129/8139 device. This has advantages and disadvantages.

I'll have more to say about my FreeBSD experiences as I familiarise
myself with it further. For now, I have come accross an odd situation
where some of my installed ports appear to be more recent than those in
the ports collection.

Some of my unanswered questions (about both gentoo and FreeBSD, but
focussing on FreeBSD at present) are:

* Practically speaking, how well does the FreeBSD cvsup and ports system
work? How much attention does it need to keep up to date?

* Is there a way to make a canonical list of ports to have installed, and
uninstall anything that isn't on that list or a dependency of something.
Something like Debian's debfoster.

* Assuming I had a machine to test the process on first, how easy would it
be to automate the process of updating everything on a number of machines
at once (perhaps using my own repository mirror, so as to maintain a
consistent state to update to).

* Can I create a package that consists of little more than config files 
and dependencies (whether as normal dependencies, or a canonical list as
described above), and install that on a machine, and have the automated
update process respect that?

If it sounds like I have some more specific goals in mind, that's because
I have... :)
