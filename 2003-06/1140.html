&gt;&gt; I'm sure the RedHat way is superior... however, it produces inferior
&gt;&gt; sysadmins. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; I may have argued this point before, but I still believe that this is
&gt; not the case.  My philosophy is that people learn by success, which
&gt; necessarily means doing things the easy way to start with.  This doesn't
&gt; mean that they're inferior, just not as experienced.  Any decent

I would claim that someone who is less experienced is almost by definition 
inferior. This is not an elitism thing, and it is not something that is 
irreversable. It's just life. When you first start to ride a bike, you are 
inferior to me, because I have more experience. However, because I am 
monumentally unfit, many people will find that within a few months or years 
of first learning, they are superior to me. 

I guess following that analogy, GUIs for sysadmins are like trainer wheels, 
and I guess they have their uses. Still, like I wouldn't say a kid can 
actually ride a bike until they can do it without training wheels, I 
wouldn't say someone can administer Unix until they can do it without a GUI. 

&gt; SysAdmin will eventually need to do things beyond the GUI Tool and
&gt; they'll do it because most things they have done in the past they have
&gt; suceeded in so the next step of getting hands dirty using vi and/or
&gt; emacs will be far easier than if that is where they start.

Quite likely, I suppose. 

&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Someone who learnt the Uern system would not know how to administer Unix...
&gt;&gt; (which may or may not be ok...) 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; I still don't believe this...

When I say "administer Unix", I mean being aboe to sit infront of any 
Unix-like machine, and have some reasonable chance of finding their way 
around... Personally, I commonly encounter Debian (3.0, 2.2), RedHat 
(anything from 6.0 on), FreeBSD (3.5 and 5.1), Solaris (8 & 9 on Sparc, 8 on 
x86), IRIX (6.5) and the occasional "assorted other". Someone who has only 
ever used the training wheels of RedHat GUIs (or the Uern /newetc -like 
system) would be in struggle mode when presented with any of these... Not to 
say they couldn't figure it out, or that they wouldn't be better than 
someone with no experience... It's entirely subjective (and hypothetical), 
but I would claim that if all they had seen was GUIs and a 
customised/unified /etc, they would be lost with a conventional /etc. 

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; b) Automated GUI Tool makers, to allow a single purpose tool  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Noble, but neccessarily involves dumbing down the configuration, IMHO. :)
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, making it more accessible.

I would argue that it's likely to be less accessible for some... 

Additionally, I don't think I am aware of a single config file format that 
would be simple enough to express trivial config files (eg /etc/hosts) as 
well as the most complex (eg /etc/named.conf, /etc/httpd.conf and so on) 
without either sacrificing flexibility for the complex ones, or readability 
for the simple ones, and while remaining powerful enough to be used as a GUI 
description too. If one exists, or someone can make one, I will happily 
stand corrected. 


&gt; 
&gt; IMHO, this whole attitude reeks of elitism and is a major problem with a
&gt; lot of Unix SysAdmins and perhaps the problem that anyone will encounter
&gt; when trying to propose "Linux of The Future".  Thing is, this is not an
&gt; attitude that I would give you based on your postings so I desperately
&gt; don't want you to take it to heart.  On the other hand, I've noticed
&gt; this with myself when comparing Linux SysAdmins and Windows SysAdmins. 
&gt; Another time for that whole argument though....

Yes, I see your point. I'm not intending to be elitist here. I'm throwing 
some realistic objections at an interesting and noble idea. It happens to be 
an idea that I like, but believe is destined to fail, at least, when 
attempted on the scale that Damien was talking about. Don't let that 
neccessarily put you or anyone else off -- I'm no expert, and even if an 
expert said it can't be done, doesn't mean it can't. 

*However*, the range of problems that Damien is trying to solve in one hit 
happens to be a range that I think is pretty much insoluble, even on a 
purely technical level. When you add the personalities of thousands of 
Linux, BSD, Unix, and software developers to that mix... wooo! Not to say 
*some* progress can't be made, even in that environment... 

As I understand it, here are Damien's requirements (this is just in terms of 
config systems, and I've re-organised it so I find it easy to understand all 
at once): 

Unified config system: 

1 Modes of editing/reading:
 1.1 -- hand-edit files
 1.2 -- (generic) GUI tools
 1.3 -- programmatic interface 

2 File Syntax
 2.1 -- human readable & writable
 2.2 -- machine readable & writable
 2.3 -- robust
 2.4 -- self-describing
 2.5 -- UI-defining
 2.6 -- powerful enough to express any possible config
 2.7 -- simple enough to express simple configs simply 

3 File tree
 3.1 -- intuitive
 3.2 -- structured 

4 Practial matters
 4.1 -- platform independant (or highly portable)
 4.2 -- extensible
 4.3 -- easily maintainable
 4.4 -- compatible with present /etc and programs 

Some of these aren't Damien's original goals -- I added some. I think 2.1, 
2.2 and 2.3 are pretty much the technical obstacles. Off the top of my head, 
I can't think of any syntaxes (syntaces? syntaxen?) that can be read and 
written by both machines and humans, without being severely restrictive on 
either, while retaining some robustness... 2.6 and 2.7 have a similar 
problem -- I can't think of many expressive syntaxen which are also simple. 

If technical solutions can be found for these (I don't claim they can't, 
only that I am not aware of anything suitable), then you're part way there. 
You then have 4.1 and 4.4 to deal with, which will be headache city (and are 
the reason why I think these problems are best attempted by a single 
distribution). Even then, you have politics and marketing... It's a tough, 
tough project, and it's one that, while I like the idea, I don't think it 
would be worth the effort...
