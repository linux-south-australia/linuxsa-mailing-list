Hi.

* Matthew Western &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mwestern@affairs.net.au">mwestern@affairs.net.au</A>&gt; [2003-06-16 14:04]:
&gt; I also agree.   there was a lot of noise a while ago about smoothwall going
&gt; non-GPL but there must have been enough stink to make them rethink not going
&gt; GPL.  a few people recommended to go to ipcop, but i didn't bother fixing
&gt; what wasn't broken.  :)

Actually, the problems most people had with smoothwall was not the non-GPL shift
that happened with the commercial product they released. At the time, there was a
particularly abrasive founder and lead developer who would abuse users at the drop
of a hat. Just asking a question the wrong way would get threats against your
character and removal from the users mailing list.

There was also an awful lot of noise about 'have you donated yet?' and how the
family were suffering because of the lack of donations etc. That was a bit rich,
but I would have donated if the abuse had not been present.

IpCop grew out of that abuse. Eventually, there was enough people with development
abilities to fork the smoothwall GPL code and go their own way. The project is
active, and is running on current 2.4 series kernels.

I'm sure smoothwall is an effective system. I think it may be slightly behind
IpCop for the GPL version (I haven't looked recently), but that won't be a problem
for it's intended audience. Personally, I wouldn't touch it because the wounds
have not healed over yet - I can't support something created by an abusive git,
even if he's left the project now.

&gt; i have a smoothwall on a Pentium 133 with 64Mb of ram and it has not missed
&gt; a beat.  i turned off the snort logging after a bit cos the drive filled up.
&gt; the smoothwall still worked fine but the logging just stopped.  only noticed
&gt; it when the next update came out and i had a look at the box.
&gt; 
&gt; anyway.... they both r0x

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO Smoothwall is significantly better. The updates for patches etc are
&gt; released quicker. Also Smoothwall 2.0 Beta 5 is released and about ready for
&gt; use. I have it (SM 1.0) running and with several hundred GB of data through
&gt; it over the last 2 months it hasn't faltered. Everything is as easy as pie
&gt; just like ipcop. Web interface for everything. Port forwarding, DMZ, Dialup,
&gt; Snort, Logs, ipacsum and all that jazz. Takes 20mins from installation
&gt; begins till its totally usable.
&gt; 
&gt; Free versions are avalible from www.smoothwall.org corporate versions are
&gt; avalible with support and the like @ www.smoothwall.co.uk
