&gt;     Jon Casimir: The video recorder was introduced in 1975 and in fact a
&gt;     lot of people thought it was a failure. It was only ever thought of
&gt;     as what they called a time shifter. It was going to be only used for
&gt;     people who wanted to tape a TV program and watch it later. The big
&gt;     film companies did not see it as a potential distribution mechanism
&gt;     for films. That was not the idea when video came in and in fact the
&gt;     first people to spot it was the porn industry and between 75 and
&gt;     1983 when it really sort of broke that popular barrier and became a
&gt;     mass market item 75% of the sales and rentals in America were
&gt;     pornography. The Japanese who invented the VCR were apparently
&gt;     astounded that this thing would be used in such a way but as is
&gt;     often the case in history inventions are not used for what the
&gt;     inventors suspected they would be.



Sounds like how the internet started.



&gt;
&gt;     Danni Ashe: When VCR's first started to come out you could either
&gt;     buy VHS or you could buy Beta and the people who did Beta were
&gt;     reluctant to let adult video titles be duplicated on their format
&gt;     and so they did what they could to restrict it. The people in VHS
&gt;     made no effort to restrict it. And which technology survived? The
&gt;     people who wanted to watch adult entertainment they bought a VHS
&gt;     machine because they could get more titles.
