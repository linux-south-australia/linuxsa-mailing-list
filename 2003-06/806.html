&gt;I've got a squid box that is doing auth against a Winnt server 
&gt;which works
&gt;fine as we are on DHCP.
&gt;
&gt;But, several users are complaining (as they do) that it's too 
&gt;hard to hit an
&gt;OK box before surfing out.

Oh dear how sad.  Our users got the hang of it after a while, also
authenticating off an NT box.


&gt;My question is has anyone sucessfully got some kind of user 
&gt;accounting on squid without having to actually log in every time. or at 
&gt;least having IE completely cache the password so you don't need to press
the 
&gt;old OK button every time you open your browser.
&gt;
&gt;for example i *think* (from memory, don't shoot me down in 
&gt;flames) that if a M$not web proxy is setup for auth it goes though without
any 
&gt;troubles and i don't think it even asks for the uname/pword. like i said
*think*. :)

You could set it up as a transparent proxy, although it would need some
rules added to your firewall/router to redirect all web traffic through
your proxy.  The disadvantage to doing it this way is that your accounting
will only show IP addresses not usernames, so it's a little difficult to
pin net abuse on an individual as they can just say that Fred Bloggs was
using their PC then.  You'll have the same issue if you do it by machine
name.  

I guess it comes back to why you are using a proxy in the first place,
if its purely as a caching/traffic saving feature, then why bother with
user authentication at all.  If it's for logging/reports for management
then you need user authentication and poor old userland will just have
to be content with clicking an OK button when they surf the web.
