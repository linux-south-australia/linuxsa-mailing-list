Hey,

I've been thinking about the various deficiencies in most GNU/Linux 
distributions and I would like to detail some of my ideas for improvement 
here for feedback. These are just notes and are by no means comprehensive, I 
plan on writing more detailed papers on some possible designs/code etc..

Anyway here they are:

1) Standardised /etc filesystem

- sane filetree:

- e.g. (this is by no means comprehensive, just some ideas - sorry if the 
indenting doesn't display properly):

/etc/system/services/httpd
                              /ppp
                              /samba/smb.conf
                              /sendmail/sendmail.conf
                              /...
                 /security/hosts.allow
                              /hosts.deny
                              /passwd
                              /fam/fam.conf
                              /...
                /network/hosts
                              /...
      /boot/rc.d
              /init.d
              /lilo/lilo.conf
              /grub/grub.conf
              /...
      /x11/x11.conf
            /xdm/xdm.conf
            /fonts/fonts.conf
           /...
      /...
/etc/user/skeleton/
             /applications/gnome
                               /kde
                               /ogle
                               /...
             /shells
            /...

-Standardised configuration file syntax with the following design goals:

- Easily human readable and modifyable (so people can edit with vi if need be)
- Syntax doubles as simple GUI layout guide
    - entire /etc directory tree should be parseable by a GUI program
      so that *all* configuration options for the *entire system* can
      be modified/viewed via a GUI
    - A GUI program need not know about say "sendmail" specifically in  order 
to provide a GUI to the user.
- A library (libetc) provided that can parse the /etc directory tree and the 
files within it. This library should be cross platform (e.g. so BSD
  can adopt if it wishes - this includes the structure of the /etc tree)

** See Appendix for a glimpse at the various mish-mash of configuration styles 
and  file locations currently found under /etc

2) Unified reference distribution that augments the LSB.

- Not a distribution in the common sense, but a specification for a 
distribution.
- The specification complies with the LSB, but fills in the blanks.
     - This may include: library versions, compiler version, compile flags    
       used, etc
- A repository of packages packaged in a distribution independent format (e.g. 
something  like "autopackage"). These packages should be able to be installed 
painlessly on  "Official Reference Distribution" compliant system.
- "Official Reference Distribution" compliance tested with software. Software 
for this testing  is free and licensed under the GNU GPL.
- Distribution companies can display a logo saying they are compatibile with 
the reference distro  simply by passing the software tests. No fees are 
charged (it is community supported after all).
- Documentation repository.
  - This includes:
      - HOWTO's for best programming practices for developing and deploying 
        software on a GNU/Linux system  (e.g. where to store data,
        configuration data, command line options syntax, user interface guide,
        when to use libraries, packaging, binary compatibility issues, etc).
      - any other relevant documentation.

The goal of this is to provide a consistent and unified standard for deploying 
software on GNU/Linux system without worrying about binary incompatibility 
issues and/or inconsistencies in the filesystem layout. It also provides 
guides to programmers so that hopefully all programs on a GNU/Linux system 
behave in a predictable and consistent manner. Programmers who's programs 
pass the various guideline tests can display an icon on the webpage for their 
project. All applications packaged for the "Official Reference Distribution" 
comply with all defined standards.

3) Protocol for the underlying system to communicate with the GUI

- A device in the /dev filesystem should be available to facilitate such 
communication. I nominate "/dev/pts/gui".
- A process can gain exclusive read access to this file. Text piped into this 
file is of a certain syntax so that it can be parsed and the desktop 
environment can provide the user with a suitable notice (such as a flashing   
icon in the system tray, or messagebox).
- /dev/pts/gui should be owned by the controlling process (have same uid/gid 
as the controlling process). If controlling process lacks sufficient 
permissions to be notified of a message, the write to /dev/pts/gui is denied.
- If there is no controlling process to /dev/pts/gui, the kernel buffers 
messages until there is a controlling process  and then passes the messages 
to it.

The purpose of this is to provide the user with notification of certain things 
the underlying system is doing that they may need to know about. Such 
notifications include hardware detection changes at bootup, hotplug changes, 
system shutdown, etc...


APPENDIX:

The following are small snippets from various configuration files in my /etc 
directory (it details the various syntaxes currently in use):

%/etc/samba/smb.conf

# The following two entries demonstrate how to share a directory so that two
# users can place files there that will be owned by the specific users. In 
this
# setup, the directory should be writable by both users and should have the
# sticky bit set on it to prevent abuse. Obviously this could be extended to
# as many users as required.

;   comment = Mary's and Fred's stuff
;   path = /usr/somewhere/shared
;   valid users = mary fred
;   public = no
;   writable = yes
;   printable = no
;   create mask = 0765

   public = yes
   guest ok = yes
