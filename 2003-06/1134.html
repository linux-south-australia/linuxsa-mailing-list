Damien,

&gt; The whole reason I started thinking about this was because of the 
&gt; number of distributions based on Debian that can easily install 
&gt; software from Debian's apt-get repositories. Being based on a stable 
&gt; base allows this sort of thing to happen. I started thinking,  if 
&gt; Debian was the "official" linux that everybody based distributions 
&gt; on, then everybody could install software designed for it.

I'd like to see this happen too, being a Debian fan; I know many, many people
though that completely loathe Debian, and with reasonable justification (they
disliked the packaging scheme / distro policies for some reason, I can't
recall exactly why).

LSB is a brilliant idea, and I'm all for it, but I can't see it working
completely; there's just too many disagreements with the way people think
things should happen.
 
&gt; GNU/Linux systems. (And also to stop software from being developed 
&gt; for "Red Hat Version 
&gt; Y.X", and instead for "LSB compatible distribution version 1.3 or 
&gt; higher").

Nod, but this would seem to suggest some kind of universal packaging (good
luck getting everybody to agree on one), and I can't see things like Debian
Sid being LSB compatible, being on the cutting edge and all (libraries change).

&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Damien

&gt; &gt; &gt; No I don't want to move user configs out of $HOME because it makes
&gt; &gt; &gt; administration harder. Often the /home partition is NFS mounted (or
&gt; &gt; &gt; at my Uni, /home/$USER is automounted via NFS on the file server
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This brilliantly demonstrates why one "perfect" unified Linux distro is a
&gt; &gt; pipe dream, IMHO.  The freedom of systems such as Linux won't ever allow
&gt; &gt; one single accepted way of doing things; everybody has their own concepts
&gt; &gt; of 'the right way', and you'll never, ever convince some people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That said, there are problems with the 5 billion distrib's out there all
&gt; &gt; doing things their own way; it's fortunate in some ways most flavours have
&gt; &gt; been based off some of the more mainstream ones (Redhat/Debian).  It's good
&gt; &gt; there are moves to unify things to some point, but some concepts seem way
&gt; &gt; too optimistic.
