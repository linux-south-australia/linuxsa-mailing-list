<H1>[OT] Old boxes for sale</H1>

<PRE>
A many will recall I am part of the Salisbury North Neighbourhood Network Inc ( <A HREF="http://www.airnet.com.au/~snnn">http://www.airnet.com.au/~snnn</A> ) and we are basically a community group set up to help our neighbourhood get better access and info on IT. We are working to break down the digital divide.

Over the years we have been given a number of orphan computers and now because of space and no direct need they are surplus to our requirements.

It would be great to just donate them to the Viet Vets / ex-Mil rehab centre / ComputerBank but we need to continue funding for Internet access and phone charges at our community access points.

So, anybody wanting some boxes, Compaq P100's, 486 DX's and similar, no drives, no keyboards/monitors etc, please drop me a line and I can send you a list of what is on offer. Make me a reasonable offer and it will more than likely be taken up. Oh, we have a couple of Macs in there as well. Both are working and with monitors etc.

Or, if you don't have a need for an old box at the moment and you believe that ComputerBank is a worthwhile cause, why not 'buy' a box and then donate it direct to ComputerBank?

I am not allowed to give them away at this stage but such a 'purchase' could help both of our organisations.

Cheers,  Ian
