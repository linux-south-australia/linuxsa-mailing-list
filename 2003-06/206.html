&gt; Hey! Zombies DO exist! The law says so!
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with everything you said - this suing shit makes me froth at
&gt; the mouth.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not just tell everyone that they're attending the event entirely
&gt; at their own risk, and get them to sign something to that effect?

Because It doesn't work. End of Story. Liability Release forms if
anything just enforces what avenues people do have.

You could blame the Lawyers for the ambulance chasing which got us into
this mess. You can blame the victims for stupid acts. You can blame the
judiciary for handing out compensation as though it is a bottomless pit.
But ultimately you should blame the human trait of Greed and the
attitude that people have of "I have rights... but no responsibility".
Common sense isn't anymore.. :-(

Enough Politics..
