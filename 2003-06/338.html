Hi Richard,

Sorry for top-quoting.

Well, I guess you have a couple of options:

1. Fix from source, and suffer the loss of apt-gettable upgrades (until the fix is
added into the official package).

2. Talk to the maintainer. My experience is that often the maintainer has a fixed
package available in a non-official apt repository that you can add to your
sources list.

3. Swap from Courier to something else that isn't broken in the official package.

4. Do nothing. (I'm guessing you are experiencing too much frustration to do
nothing, but I'm adding it here for completeness)

I've never used courier, so I cannot comment on it's benefits or otherwise.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I get quite a bit of mail that Courier decides has corrupted MIME
&gt; headers. Most of this mail appears to come from webmail (hotmail, in
&gt; this instance), or occasionally from Outlook (though not all versions).
&gt; It's damned annoying, because I really don't care if someone else has a
&gt; dud mail client, I just want to read my mail. I've not had this problem
&gt; with other MTAs, only Courier. The error message it gives me is as
&gt; follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;                               CORRUPTED MESSAGE
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is the Courier Mail Server 0.37 on &lt;mailserver&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I received the following message for delivery to your address.
&gt; Unfortunately, 
&gt; &gt; the sender's mail software did not properly format the following
&gt; message 
&gt; &gt; according to Internet mail formatting protocols, and I can only
&gt; deliver mail 
&gt; &gt; which has been properly formatted according to Internet standards.
&gt; Instead 
&gt; &gt; of returning the following message as undeliverable, it is saved, in
&gt; its 
&gt; &gt; original form, in the following attachment, which you can open with
&gt; any 
&gt; &gt; editor or word processor. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Please notify the original sender that their message was not properly 
&gt; &gt; formatted by their mail software.  The specific mail protocol error in
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt; original message is as follows: 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; -----
&gt; &gt; The following message contains 8-bit content, but does not have the
&gt; required 
&gt; &gt; MIME headers for 8-bit data transport. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; See &lt;URL:<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2045.txt&gt">ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2045.txt&gt</A>; for more information.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; -----
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I really really don't care whether it has 8bit content or not -- I
&gt; just want it to work. No other MTA has a problem with this. The really
&gt; annoying thing is that some people will send HTML or images to me, and I
&gt; have to manually mess about, reading raw HTML (usually MS-HTML too), and
&gt; extracting base64 encoded images, adding the right headers uudecoding
&gt; them, and so on. It's a PITA. What can I do about this, without having
&gt; to explain to every non-computer literate friend that they need to
&gt; change their mail client because my MTA can't handle broken messages?
&gt; 
&gt; I have done some research, and have found a source code patch that will
&gt; fix this: <A HREF="http://www.courier-mta.org/FAQ.html">http://www.courier-mta.org/FAQ.html</A>#esmtperr -- the "Q:
&gt; Courier delivers ESMTP mail with a strange error message:" question.
&gt; However, I'm then back in the usual debian bind of needing to recompile
&gt; a binary package, which, while I can do it, and I know how to do it, I
&gt; don't really want to if I can avoid it. Sigh. I'm pretty sure I'm going
&gt; to have to do so though, and lose the benefits of apt-get updates for
&gt; courier. :(  ... when I get the chance, I'm going to move that server to
&gt; FreeBSD, I swear :)
