Michael,

I doubt the REN's are likely to be the issue, but its worth checking the REN
rating of each device, as 1 device doesn't always equal 1 REN...  We have an
answering machine at home which is 0.4 REN, and our cordless phones are
about 0.8 REN if I remember correctly...  Telstra specify a maximum of three
REN's, but you can sometimes get away with more than that (my inlaws have
about 5 phones plugged into their line)...  

I've also encountered situations where the dial tone sounds normal until you
listen to it very closely, and you find that it warbles very slightly.  In
that instance the easiest thing to do is to set the modem to not listen for
dial tone before dialling.

I've just had ADSL connected at home on a line which has three phones, and
an answering machine with no ADSL problems (currently downloading RedHat 9
ISO's from Internode's mirror at 50+Kb/sec as we speak).  Only thing to make
sure of is that you have line filters on all of your phones, otherwise you
might hear some interference or loose ADSL line synch while using the phone.

Jim.

&gt; Hm - is it a normal ring tone, or the strange ringtones you get with
services
&gt; such as Messagebank?
&gt; 
&gt; Most modems barf if its a nonstandard ring tone.

Yeah, it's just a normal ring tone.

This is the setup:

    +----- phone
    |
----+----- answering machine ---- phone
    |
    +------ &lt;no device connected&gt;
    |
    +------ modem

so the comment about ring equivalent number may be the problem.  Looks like
at least 4 RENs to me (where 3 is what "has" to be supported).

Sigh.
