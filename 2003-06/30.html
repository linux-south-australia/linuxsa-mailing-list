<PRE>
&gt; I have decided to wake up this mailing list with a suggestion 
&gt; for a"Geek Boot Camp". 

Interesting idea... well, interesting in a geeky kind of way (ie in any
other company, I would not admit to it being interesting at all ;)

&gt; 
&gt; Basically, It would be an intensive weekend to allow people 
&gt; to learn about PHP, Apache, kernel compiles (regardless of 
&gt; OS), BSD, Linux etc.

How would people learn? Any "teachers"? Or just a big geeky
get-together?

&gt; 
&gt; It probably should be residential so if you are wanting to 
&gt; continue into the evening... or morning.. (say waiting for a 
&gt; compile to finish or just not wanting to give up on 
&gt; something) you may. The group would need to be kept small say 
&gt; 20-30 people. It get a lot harder with a larger group as far 
&gt; as power and security goes.

True... And accommodation...

&gt; 
&gt; I was thinking of a Long weekend. Organisers arrive Friday 
&gt; Evening and start setting up, Everyone else start to arrive 
&gt; arrive Sat morning or later. Option to stay over night. 
&gt; Depart Monday Lunch to allow plenty of time to pack and tidy up. 

Depends what needs to be set up, really... I would assume that it
wouldn't really need to be anything spectacular, probably less so than
InstallFest... Just tables with power outlets. 

&gt; 
&gt; Infrastructure: The Attendees would be responsible for 
&gt; bringing their own machines. The only thing that will be 
&gt; provided will be the networking (I have access to a 24 port 
&gt; 10/100 Switch. Might be able to bring a wireless access point.)

What about internet connectivity?

&gt; 
&gt; Location: I'm thinking it should be in the Adelaide Hills to 
&gt; give attendees a weekend away from the City. But close enough 
&gt; for them to be in town in 30 minutes.

I would think that for this to be really useful, we'd need internet
connectivity... which could be rather restrictive...

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway it is only an idea at this stage. It got a tentative 
&gt; thumbs up from the few people that I spoke to over the last few days.
&gt; 
&gt; [Side thought: Hmmm..... Could subsequent camps be called 
&gt; "Geek Re-Boot Camp". Otherwise you come up with a better term for it.]

Hmm :)
