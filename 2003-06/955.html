Robyn,

Telstra's ISDN method requires installing a second phone line and you can
combine that with your existing to double your access speed or use it to
make calls, etc., while on the internet.  Theory is you have access like
putting 56K modem plus 56K modem and you get 128K access speed, so they say
(but I calculate 112K - oh well...)

According to Telstra, the highest speed I, and anyone, in my area can get on
our phone lines is actually 33K but more usually I get somewhere between 21K
and 31K.  Basically, my standard 56K modem is much more than I really can
use at home on my phone line because my phone line can't go above 33K.

Therefore, even with the two phone lines the best I could hope for is 66K
with ISDN.

Which is also why I am very annoyed with Telstra, because 56K modems and
ISDN and broadband and ADSL were all out and running (ADSL in it's infancy)
when I had my house built and in fact when more than half of the housing
development was still being built (some 200 to 300 houses) back in 1997.

Even if the property developers didn't want to fork out the costs of a new
phone exchange, they could have at least offered better cabling options
(they didn't offer any options except you want 1, 2, 3, n+1 phone lines) to
locals and upgraded the exchanges at a later time.

I know that the underground cabling housing has empty spare piping for
extras later on - I saw them making the streets.  They only made a couple of
streets, then sold them, then made another set of streets and so on.  So why
they can't do broadband is way beyond me.

All in all, it sounds like a great way for Telstra to charge low income
earners for a high end internet access via satellite by restricting them to
a maximum of 33K via modem and not providing broadband and ASDL.

I am only 20 minutes out of the cbd.  I am actually honest about this,
because the main arterial road goes straight to the centre of town - I am
not zig zagging or drawing an imaginary straight line from where I live to
town.  I am not in Port Wakefield (100KM from town) or Port Augusta (approx
300KM from town) or somewhere in the Outback for goodness sake, so why
should I have to fork out for satellite access.

The entire thing boggles the mind and smacks of conspiracy to screw the
workers yet one more time out of their hard earned wages.  
Where is Mulder when you need him, I'd even settle for Mel Gibson.
