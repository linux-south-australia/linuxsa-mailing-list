In the immortal words of gwyn &lt;<A HREF="mailto:gwyn@mayhem.dezyne.net">gwyn@mayhem.dezyne.net</A>&gt;...
&gt; With the sudden death of my Vaio, I'll be looking for a new laptop
&gt; soon. I'm determined not to pay the microsoft tax this time around. It
&gt; appears that only one person has ever managed to get a refund on
&gt; bundled windows, and that was some time ago. Can anyone bring me up to
&gt; date on what's being done these days?

As far as I know, it's next to impossible to get the refund these days,
however all is not lost. I recently purchased my brand new notebook
sans-windows and saved about $115 in the process.  At least that's the
difference in price when I bought it.  Happily running FreeBSD 5.1 and
loving it.

&gt; In about two weeks I'll have a law degree and some spare time, so if
&gt; anyone's interested in having a go at this, I'm happy to be the test
&gt; case.

This might be interesting, and I'm reasonably sure that Geoffrey has an
idea of recent developments in this area.

&gt; If it's all been tried before and it absolutely, positively, can't be
&gt; done with name-brand gear, can anyone recommend a windows-free brand
&gt; with reliability, a decent warranty, and a repair shop locally? The
&gt; Vaio's taking a long road trip to Sydney, with no loan machine
&gt; offered, which is something I'm eager not to go through again.

A friend of mine got his Toshiba notebook about 12 months ago and
absolutely couldn't gt it without paying the MS tax.  Admittedly this is
a very small test sample, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same
with other name-brands.

Cheers

Tim
