&gt;
&gt;Make sure you email your letter as a Word document with lots of pretty
&gt;colours and fonts all saved into the document, and little animated
&gt;picture or several to make it "pretty".  Oh yeah, make sure to send HTML
&gt;email with a pretty animated logo or several more, a background picture
&gt;and while you're at it.. several more annoying crappy fonts in
&gt;disturbing colour schemes using Outlook! Really make that point :-p. 
&gt;And finally, don't forget to attach a copy of the I Love You virus (and
&gt;all of it's derivations) to show how secure that M$ email program is. We
&gt;wouldn't want the government using any of that insecure open source
&gt;stuff now, would we?

&gt;&gt;Maybe we should write some letters supporting Microsoft and pass them 
&gt;&gt;through this translator:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html">http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Then the Government will assume Microsoft is just for kidz.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Just a thought ... :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Joe Average will still be using .MSXML format with their copy of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;make full use of the "open" standard...sigh...here's hoping industry

&gt;&gt;&gt;When does the industry ever see through M$'s marketing hype?  If they
&gt;&gt;&gt;could see through it, there wouldn't be such a widespread abundance of
&gt;&gt;&gt;M$ crappy products everywhere.  The industry generally naive.  There may
&gt;&gt;&gt;be a select few of us who choose not to be ignorant of the real facts,
&gt;&gt;&gt;but the rest of the world doesn't share our view.  They just want
&gt;&gt;&gt;something that looks pretty, has gazillions of features (that they'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;never use anyway) and costs a lot (didn't you know $$$ == quality). M$
&gt;&gt;&gt;exploits that fact fully for its own profit.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/rant&gt;
