I'm currently in San Francisco, attending the WWDC (where the PowerMac 
G5 was released). I've been having fun playing with the demo boxes in 
the Lab.

That Haxial article is crap... the modifications to compiler options 
were made to improve the performance of the Intel, since hyperthreading 
currently slows benchmarks and single threaded code.

If you run Linux on the dual Xeons, you'll be using GCC... so the 
choice to use GCC was quite reasonable and also biased in favour of the 
Intel since there's been very little optimisation done for the G5 
architecture.

The most important demonstration was done at the Keynote (where I was 
sitting front row, middle - excellent position!), with numerous real 
applications side by side. The PowerMac G5 was over twice as fast even 
though the code on the Intels would have been compiled with the Intel 
compiler and with all the tweaks.

The question isn't whether the G5 is faster than the current generation 
x86s... what remains to be seen is whether the G5 (which is a next 
generation CPU) stacks up against the next generation Intel/AMDs. The 
main factor is not the speed of the CPU, but the speed of the system - 
the 1Ghz front side bus and the G5's ability to handle SMP are more 
important.

It has been kind of amusing seeing the squealing denials on the PC 
sites, missing the point that benchmarks ultimately don't mean shit.
