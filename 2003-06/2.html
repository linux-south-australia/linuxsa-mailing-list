DSL sayeth:

&gt; Debian is a good end-user system but I'm not convinced it's a 
&gt; good server system. Dan Shearer might have something to say 
&gt; about that because I recall, a long time ago, him saying that 
&gt; he sometimes used Debian as a server system.

I use it on a few servers, and it has been adequate, and certainly is a
long way preferable to the other OS's I have on my servers (RedHat,
Solaris, IRIX, FreeBSD 3.5 -- just too old to be any use). I don't find
it that good on the desktop, personally -- and whether it's on the
desktop or the server, I find the age of it to be a problem.

&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, I'm not sure what operating system would be a 
&gt; generically good server system. There's too many factors to 
&gt; consider including:
&gt; 
&gt;  * speed
&gt;  * stability
&gt;  * administrative skills
&gt;  * maintainability
&gt;  * how up-to-date is it
&gt;  * security

... and hardware support

Well, in every case that I have, I have the following priorities:

* hardware support (most hardware I want to use on a server is supported
by most kernels... usually)
* secure
* stable
* maintainable
* fast
* up-to-date


I don't quite know how "administrative skills" applies to the OS -- I
guess you mean how well the administrator knows the OS. I use many
different OSes, and tend to be most familiar with Debian, followed by
RedHat, other Linuxes, FreeBSD, Solaris, then IRIX. Windows might be in
there somewhere, probably after FreeBSD. However, I consider any Unix to
be somewhat familiar, and could work my way around any of them --
certainly, if I spent significant time with any of them, I'd become
equally familiar with that OS as with debian.

In terms of those priorities, Debian does very well with secure and
stable, and is pretty good with maintainable and fast. However, it fails
at up-to-date. Fails miserably. I could make it up-to-date, but at the
cost of maintainability and possibly stability. I believe that there are
other OSes that do as well or better than Debian on the top four, but
are more up-to-date. This is why I wanted to compare gentoo and
FreeBSD... which I have sort of done, though not on this list (why is it
that there was actually very little in responses that actually related
to the original question? :)
