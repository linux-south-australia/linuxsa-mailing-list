Just as a follow up, Adobe is doing a heavy campaign here in the U.S.  I 
haven't paid enough attention to the TV ads, but I think they are saying 
things like...create your own documents, etc. but that isn't really the 
solution.

&gt;I guess the problem is that for the recruiter, they still have to be able to read .doc
&gt;files, because that's what everyone sends them. It's just another chicken
&gt;and egg problem, really...
&gt;
To break the eggs and eat a chicken omelet, open source is going to have 
to come up with a even "better" tool first.  

If I were to make a better word processor, it will probably have to be 
ewwwwwey-gewwwey bloated. It would do a lot for you, including the 
typing. It would not require a keyboard. You just talk to the computer. 
 Tell the program the type of document you want, and it formats it for 
you. It fixes spelling errors for you, suggests alternate wording 
schemes, making 5 year old Johnny sound like shakespeare.

How likeley is it that Open Source will do that? I think very slim indeed.
