Agreed.


&gt;&gt; Sometimes I have to get a recent library or three,
&gt;
&gt; Why?  The port should take care of that kind of dependency.

Also agreed, and it does for some combinations of packages and platforms.

My point is: don't upgrade without a reason.  If you wait until you
have a reason, perhaps you need a new feature or you've become aware
of a security concern, the additional effort to upgrade dependancies
is usually too little to worry about.  It tends to be quickly clear
when the extra effort will be large, and then I do a new install; that
happens really infrequently.

All this worry about which distribution is easier for automatic upgrades
is rather like looking for a way to let you upgrade without having to
know the reason why.  As I said, I don't do that.  And I save time by
not worrying about distributions.  I can't see any advantage in doing
unnecessary work. ;-)




&gt;&gt; I wonder if, when SCO provide their evidence, we'll find the same
&gt;&gt; code in FreeBSD, which would indicate that it's (the code) already
&gt;&gt; unencumbered.
&gt;
&gt; No, that would indicate that (if they have any money left) they'll go
&gt; after FreeBSD too.


I'm not sure they can do that.  It would be too much like retrying the
USL vs UCB Regents and BSDI.  I just don't think they'd get away with it.
If you can point to it in Net2 BSD the courts already said it's kosher.
So it makes me wonder.



&gt;
&gt; I would *really* like to see some evidence that they have stolen code
&gt;&gt;from Linux.  That would be so funny.
