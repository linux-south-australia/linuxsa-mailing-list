&gt;Hmm... interesting...
&gt;
&gt;----
&gt;Government departments in South Australia will be required to use open
&gt;source software in preference to proprietary software if a bill proposed
&gt;by Democrat Ian Gilfillan is passed into law. 
&gt;----
&gt;
&gt;Sounds good -- Vote Democrat!
&gt;
&gt;----
&gt;Gilfillan intends to rally support for his proposal through the open
&gt;source community and plans to speak at the South Australian Linux User's
&gt;Group.
&gt;----
&gt;
&gt;Hmm... This is news to me. Did I miss something here, or is this news to
&gt;everyone? I assume the "South Australian Linux User's Group" is LinuxSA,
&gt;right?

I hope that he will look to what has happened in Oregon as a prediction 
of what could happen in SA:

I think that anything short of a bill that treats all parties fairly 
will fail, and actually damage the reputation of open source software 
further.

Mandating the use of open source software, makes it appear to the public 
that it is not strong enough to hold its own when compared to closed 
software. It also makes it appear to that a few unusual and vocal people 
are trying to force the use of what they conclude must be second rate 
software, because if it were a first choice, the law would be unnecessary.

Open formats and standards should be argued.  There is no subjectivity 
involved.  Data that is not held for the public in a closed format is a 
problem.

The arguement will not be won on cost alone.
