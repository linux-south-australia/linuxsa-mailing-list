Apologies if this comes out in HTML - I'm replying through Outlook
Web Access, which brings new meaning to "Lowest Common Denominator"

Is DHCP updating a DNS server?  If so, you could query against that
(although I'd use a dns cache to not put too much strain on the DNS
server, but there are tradeoffs against that as well).
 
&gt; We have squid on linux auth with NTLM against an winnt schmerver which works
&gt; perfectly but as we have just turned it on there was a few ruffled feathers,
&gt; not the least of which the 'IT Manager' &lt;very deep sigh&gt; thought it wasn't a
&gt; good idea. the politics side is sorted tho, the joy of going over the IT
&gt; managers head. :)

I think I may have been misunderstood.  You wanted a scheme where the
authentication was transparent, like MS Proxy.  What I was talking about
was NTLM authentication between the *Browser* (read: IE) and Squid,
which then in turn authenticates against a Domain Controller.  IE passes,
if requested, the user's stored credentials across when challanged[1], and
will only prompt the user if these details are incorrect.  I have this running
at a site with the users partitioned into groups based on username, and
it works a treat.  It even supports multiple NT domains, which this site
also has.
 
 
[1]  IE used to do this regardless of who challenged it, so it was popular
     exploit to have a web server out on the 'net snarf NTLM hashes.
