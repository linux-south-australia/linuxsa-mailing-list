Hi all,

I wish to have a public dummy spit. Grant me the pleasure of doing so on
this list.

I have gone to considerable lengths to make my resume completely portable.
It's in PDF format, which, as I understand, is readable pretty much
anywhere, with either Free or free software. There is no cost, and very
little inconvenience, to anyone.

Now it seems that half the recruitment agencies around the place seem to
want MS Word resumes. One, TMP/Hudson, even rejects online job applications
if your resume doesn't have a .doc (or .txt) extension. Yes, they have
indeed given me the option of .txt, but that would entail me reformatting it
extensively, and hence, losing much clarity. Another emailed me back, asking
for a copy in Word format so they could enter it into their database. As DSL
would say, "Confound!" ...

What is to be done about this? I, for one, am irritated. I would like to do
something, but don't quite know what. I don't think there is a whole lot
that can be done, really. It's one of those situations where you either use
the .doc format, or you go with plain text (and even that gets rejected by
some), which is wholly unnacceptable. Perhaps HTML would be ok, but again, I
don't want to have to fuss about making it look right in HTML on multiple
browsers and in print, when PDF is perfect for that.

Here endeth the spit. Management thanks you for your patience. Your resume
is important to us. Etc.

rr
