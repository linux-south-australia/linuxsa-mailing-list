&gt;&gt;&gt; On the other hand, it would be a total abrogation of responsibilities
&gt;&gt;&gt; to ignore critical security updates just because they came out in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same week, and because I thought it would be a waste of time to
&gt;&gt;&gt; protect my network more often than once a week.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not on the other hand: It would be a total abrogation of
&gt;&gt; reposnsibilities, full-stop.  If there are security issues you have to
&gt;&gt; address them.  No question about that.  The question is, do you trust a
&gt;&gt; distribution to keep track of all the security issues for you?  I
&gt;&gt; don't.
&gt;
&gt; Selective quoting. You missed the point, and removed the vital part:

I don't think so.  I agreed with you.  You must keep up to date with
current vulnerabilities.  I added to what you said, by asking if you
trust a distribution to keep track of those issues for you.


&gt;&gt;&gt; The beauty of the Gentoo and Debian approach is that it is very easy,
&gt;&gt;&gt; therefore I can and I will keep them up to date with the minimum
&gt;&gt;&gt; effort.(Capability).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; They make it easy to stay up to date if you don't want to have to know
&gt;&gt; the details.  I *do* want to know the details.
&gt;
&gt; I _think_ that is what I was saying.

If what you think you were saying is that you don't want to rely on a
distribution to keep track of security issues, then we are in agreement.

If you do want to the distributor keep track of security issues then I ask
if you can trust them.  Almost all of the mainstream UNIX distributors
have shown a previous lack of trustworthiness.  (e.g. c.f. Morris R, The
Internet Worm.)

I trust CERT, I trust what I read on package sites when I go there after
an advisory.  Distributors might also have security upgrades available
for me, but I'm not convinced it's easier to look their than at the
package developers.  Sometimes you have to get your upgrade from the
package developer because you need a really new feature.  I think I'm
ahead by largely ignoring distributions.
