Yeah, but it means _something_ :) A 1.4GHz Opteron runs rings around a 1GHz 
SPARC, I'm sure... and for a LOT less money.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; They're doing multiple cores per chip (not even SMT like p4's, but
&gt; &gt; duplicate everything). I'm sure that'll help multithreaded apps, but
&gt; &gt; as for raw power, dunno..
&gt;
&gt; But multiple cores are quite useful in the server environment which is
&gt; Sun's main market, maybe less so on the personal and corporate desktop.
&gt; I was under the impression they were doing a lot of Sparc R&D in
&gt; general, however, not just looking at parallelism. Time to consult my
&gt; sources it seems.

Oh im sure they are doing a lot of R&D on it. The multiple cores thing is only 
one thing I heard they are doing (from a Solaris sysadmin who was researching 
it at the time).

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Definitely. I'm looking forward to playing on the Opteron when it's
&gt; &gt; finally put into the machine room :)
&gt;
&gt; I could imagine. Did you say you were putting a UN*X on it? Let us know
&gt; how it goes. =)

Yeah Red Hat 7.3 is already up and booting on it, even with the proprietary 
raid controller. There are 2 raid controllers, the second one doesn't work 
yet however :/ Hopefully we'll have an opteron-compiled OS on it one day, but 
for now we need to use RH 7.3 because of some proprietary software that needs 
to run on it. I'm glad we have such a choice, go AMD! :)

&gt;
&gt; Mike.

Cheers,

Damien
