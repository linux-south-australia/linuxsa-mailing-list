Yeah I do realise that all of those cfg* commands can already be achieved in 
Linux, in fact those cfg commands would just be shell scripts that use 
existing commands to achieve their goal. The only difference being that they 
would work within the new organisational structure of the /etc tree rather 
than just letting people dump stuff wherever they want in there...

Also in regards to the config files in /etc, by "user" I mean "administrator" 
or somebody with root privaledges. And yes, hiding options from the GUI is 
pricesly my goal of having "private" variables.

The number one reason for simplifying the /etc tree and the format of config 
files is to ease the burden on

a) System Administrators, especially those new to Unix
b) Automated GUI Tool makers, to allow a single purpose tool to provide the 
user with an interface to configure the whole system, _without_ learning 100 
different config file formats/locations/peculiarities and to also account for 
future softwares that adopt the standard (i.e. no need to modify the GUI 
application).

My aim is to do this whilst keeping the command line people happy (heck, I'm 
one of them). Hence one of the main design goals was to keep the config file 
format simple enough for somebody to edit by hand and also stop the GUI 
program from overwriting settings that have been set by hand.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Why would you want private variables in a config file in the first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place? I can't think of any instance where a current config file has
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real non-user-modifiable information...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I would have...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;                          /config/user/joe
&gt; &gt; &gt;                          /config/user/jack
&gt; &gt; &gt;                         /config/user/name-of-user
&gt; &gt; &gt;                          /config/admiin
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;                          /config
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No I don't want to move user configs out of $HOME because it makes
&gt; &gt; administration harder. Often the /home partition is NFS mounted (or at my
&gt; &gt; Uni, /home/$USER is automounted via NFS on the file server whenever you
&gt; &gt; login). Having user configs on the local machine smells like how
&gt; &gt; Windows2k does it ("Documents and Settings/$USER"), which I don't like at
&gt; &gt; all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason I was talking about private variables is to ease the clutter
&gt; &gt; of the GUI (by not having too many options displayed by default), and
&gt; &gt; also to allow the application to store information about itself that is
&gt; &gt; not really meant to be modified by a user (e.g. paths shouldn't need to
&gt; &gt; be changed). e.g. look at xcdroast.conf:
&gt;
&gt; Well, you can use the file permitions to make it editable by only
&gt; whomever you want. You know where the users config files are now they
&gt; are now (home directory, prefixed with .) I think your saying that there
&gt; sould be a way to have only a part of a config file editable so users
&gt; can make changes without being able to tamper with the more advanced
&gt; functions? I see this as what the gui is for. People can make gui config
&gt; tools which list out the options for the user who is no guru and this
&gt; tool can omit any advanced options, or have a selectable advanced mode.
&gt; Then if the user knows what they are doing and need more flexability
&gt; they can edit the config file directly at their own risk (or they cant
&gt; if they dont have root access and the syadmin doesnt want them too)
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; $ cd Documents\ and\ Settings/
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Making sure to get the capital letters correct, etc..
&gt;
&gt; Well, typically all you have to do is "cd Do&lt;tab&gt;" and you should be
&gt; right. Agreed, I don't like that naming convention though, and it raises
&gt; the issue of whether to be case sensitive or not. Traditionally of
&gt; course unix is, but now we see some gui apps that are and some that
&gt; arnt. Conformity would be nice! Its a hard one though, because some of
&gt; the time case sensitivity is advantageous, and sometimes its a pain, and
&gt; means checking both options till you find what you want.
&gt;
&gt;  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; $ cfgedit smb.conf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; here cfgedit parses the /etc tree and finds smb.conf, then it opens it up
&gt; &gt; in the configured default editor (vi probably, but anything else could be
&gt; &gt; set, pico even).
&gt;
&gt; Well, you could go "locate smb.conf" unless its been moved since the
&gt; slocate database was last updated, but I doubt you'd move config files
&gt; anyway...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; $ vi /etc/proftpd.conf
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So why doesn't proftpd have it's own directory?
&gt;
&gt; True, some conformity here would be nice, but if you are typing vi
&gt; /etc/pro&lt;tab&gt; or similar you'll get either proftpd.conf or a proftpd.d/
&gt; (or similar) directory, and so it should be pretty intuitive.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What if you want to edit xdm?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $ vi /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The naming convention for the file isn't even consistent!
&gt;
&gt; True, thats an odd location by comparison, but you still have the locate
&gt; tool to tell you where the file is, and the man pages to tell you the
&gt; name of the file and related files.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe you could have other tools for managing the configuration files,
&gt; &gt; e.g:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $ cfgfind samba
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; returns the path to the samba config file
&gt;
&gt; locate smb.conf :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; $ cfgbackup
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; backs up the current configuration state of the system, perhaps in
&gt; &gt; /etc/backup
&gt;
&gt; tar -czvf "/mnt/backups/`date`.tar.gz" /etc
&gt;
&gt; True its not as simple, but thats the trade off for more power. Plus
&gt; people who already know how to do it one way, are unlikely to want to be
&gt; forced to learn another.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; $ cfgrestore
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; restores the last backed up configuration
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $ cfgdeploy [config] &lt;HOST&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; synchronises the configuration of this server with HOST, over ssh (where
&gt; &gt; the optional option "config" is the name of a configuration, e.g.
&gt; &gt; "cfgdeploy samba 192.168.0.3" will synchronise the configuration of samba
&gt; &gt; with host 192.168.0.3 - it may even have an option to restart/start/stop
&gt; &gt; the service on that host in the one command).
&gt;
&gt; rsync? nfs? diskless workstations sharing config and binarys?
&gt;
&gt; I do see your point, and realise that you are saying it should be easier
&gt; to do these things and not that it is currently impossible, but it
&gt; certainly can be worked out how to do these things with existing tools
&gt; and how-tos, which also forces you to learn more about your system and
&gt; what your doing which can only be a good thing for linux! Still, its no
&gt; clear cut issue.
