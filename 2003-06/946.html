Alex,

All this discussion about the "slow rollout" just makes me want to puke or
laugh - can't decide which.

Australia has been and always will be in the slow lane in relation to the
super-highway and the rollout being too slow isn't really the issue and
never will be.  The issue really should be that in many areas there is no
rollout happening at all for Broadband or ADSL and there never will be.

Broadband and ADSL slow rollouts are the least of the average person's
concern (and probably that of many other persons who run small businesses,
or who are in the North of Adelaide).  The entire argument is what I call a
"firfy", or a redirection/slight-of-hand exercise - it is not the relevant
argument at all.

I live in a fairly new housing development in the North of Adelaide.  I had
a strict budget, a need for a one level house (for family medical reasons)
and had my house built - they are still building the last few houses in the
development and still have a few empty lots.  The land prices are
***reasonably*** (eg not $150K+ but between $50K and $100K - but started out
at between $20K and $70K) priced for people on the one income or low income.
Each time I asked Telstra when my exchange would be ASDL enabled (easier for
work access and homework access) they couldn't give me a definite answer -
even their handy website checker said ASDL isn't enabled in your area yet,
please check back later - I wasn't planning on broadband for various
reasons.

I eventually discovered, a few years after I moved in, and after many calls
to Telstra, and deciding to change my expectations, to my shock, that I
cannot get cable (they wont lay it in my area and have no intention of doing
so at any time in the future), nor can I get ADSL (they didn't lay the
correct type of phone lines for that - they say the original owners of the
property development didn't specify it being needed (so they picked the
cheapest phone cable around - regardless of the fact that the housing
development is situated right near a main arterial road with 20 minute
access to the cbd and has quite a few small and large businesses in and
around it)).

My only option is to go satellite and pay big bickies for the install and
then more big bickies on monthly satellite access with any ISP (Telstra were
very helpful with lots of other options - No, I don't want to go ISDN - why
bother - the cost isn't worth it and they couldn't ensure it would work
properly on the cheap phone lines or give me more than 66K - not the 128K
they advertise - and, No, I don't want Foxtel - they only do satellite link
- they can't/don't/wont do cable in my area - who has time to watch lots of
TV - to get it is a further waste of money on re-run crap - No, I don't want
BigPond Satellite access, I already have an ISP I am happy with, also the
cost involved in putting in the satellite comes in yet again).

So I have to put up with my somewhere between 21K and 33K modem link (the
phone line wont handle anything higher than that even if I could tweak the
settings of my 56K modem - another reason to forget ISDN) until something
else comes along or I move or (I doubt it would happen in a brand new
housing development) they upgrade the phone lines.

This leads me to the conclusion that what I would like to see is Telstra and
the Parliament, tarred and feathered, drawn and quartered, and then hung up
for the vultures - or a royal commission with teeth (is that an oxy-moron)
into their supplying reasonable services to ***all*** Australians (the
government thinks if you can get 14K or above, this is ***reasonable*** -
try it sometime - you might last 5 minutes).

Come to think of it, taking those persons in Telstra and the Government who
use the super-highway as a major part of their daily work and personal lives
and making them live and work on a - so called - average income in a
"non-rollout" area with a ***reasonable*** 14K modem connection would
probably be more satisfying to me.  But I think I would still like the see
the Tarring and Feathering first.

THE MEDIA REPORT with Mick O'Regan
The Slow Lane on the Superhighway
Thursday, 26 June, 8.30am, repeat 8pm
As Parliament wrestles with new media ownership rules, critics
suggest our communications infrastructure is inadequate. Is
the roll out of 'broadband' too slow, leaving Australia stuck
in the slow lane on the communications superhighway?
