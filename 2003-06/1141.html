* My arguement is that its easier for a new user to understand .conf 
files, then to find or know that they exist. I think if the .conf files 
were in intuitively understandible places that can be explained by a 
simple set of logic rules, and that the .conf file was reasonably 
understandible, there would be no demand for a gui, and it would save a 
lot of development time for specialty applications that are now missing 
from Linux, instead of fixing bugs in gui's that can't completely modify 
the .conf file, and perhaps muck it up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would you want private variables in a config file in the first place?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't think of any instance where a current config file has real
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;non-user-modifiable information...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then I would have...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;                         /config/user/joe
&gt;&gt;&gt;                         /config/user/jack
&gt;&gt;&gt;                        /config/user/name-of-user
&gt;&gt;&gt;                         /config/admiin
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;instead of...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;                         /config
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;Well, you can use the file permitions to make it editable by only
&gt;whomever you want. 
&gt;
Just my opinion....I think the most important thing is to be able to 
find the files without a lot of fuss. Having a logical guideline as to 
where everything goes makes things easier to find, and does not limit 
the flexibility of the system' program functionality. I don't want to 
muck with a permission that already makes sense for a user's config.

One idea I just had includes having a /config just for root and a 
/config that will override the root setting with user's settings. Of 
course, root's  .conf file must allow for this.   :-)

I think that naming and location conventions are already not flexibile, 
so this wouldn't hamper flexibility for the user on that level. However, 
it will make it more difficult for developers and that is a minus.

&gt;You know where the users config files are now they
&gt;are now (home directory, prefixed with .) I think your saying that there
&gt;sould be a way to have only a part of a config file editable so users
&gt;can make changes without being able to tamper with the more advanced
&gt;functions? 
&gt;
I would like to see those files in a /config directory in $home, and 
here's why...

I find the home directory cluttered in a way. Now its probably just me, 
but I don't want to accidently cut and paste a conf file when I am 
moving documents around. Plus .conf files are not used that often after 
the settings are right.


&gt;I see this as what the gui is for. 
&gt;
I had my opening statement here, but moved it up to the top.
