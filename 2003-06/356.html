Michael,

To sum things up simply, I'd suggest you spend some time investigation the
LDAP option. I am familiar with at least one organisation (with multiple
sites) that has successfully deployed a replicated LDAP directory that
supports authentication to a central samba PDC, allowing various Win clients
access to network shares etc (across sites). BDC's had not yet been
implemented, awaiting the release of samba 3.0.

The beta release in the last few days of samba 3.0 includes additional ldap
functionality (according to the release notes).

One downside of such an LDAP configuration, off the top of my head, is the
lack of some kind of client so that "non-tech" user's can say, add people to
the orgnisation's global address book. (Has anyone out there seen something
like this??)

Cheers,
Damian.

(rr: You can probably more elloquently summarize what I'm talking about :)


&gt; I've already browsed through the archives and found various discussions on
&gt; OpenLDAP which seem to indicate that it is a bit unwieldy in it's current
&gt; form. Given that subscribers to LinuxSA are a bit more open minded than
some
&gt; other forums I was hoping to get some more feedback on implementation and
&gt; management of Directory services.
&gt;
&gt; My exposure to AD or any form of LDAP is non-existant, so I would be
&gt; starting with a fresh slate. Existing Network is NT4 based servers spread
&gt; nationally. The NT authentication is currently used for File permissions
on
&gt; NTFS volumes and Internet Access through Squid. Some of the smaller
&gt; temporary offices do not currently have their own BDCs which can cause
&gt; issues with password changes etc. I am hoping to set up Linux boxes as
local
&gt; file servers which Rysnc to a central location for file backup and was
&gt; looking for a solution that can be easily rolled out to all site offices
and
&gt; synchronised.
&gt;
&gt; Client machines are all Win based ( 95/98/NTWS/2K ). Client email is
&gt; predominantly Outlook 98/2000. There are currently no Global address books
&gt; and users either add a new staff member manually or use the intranet where
&gt; everyones email is listed. Total numbers of users is about 200-230.
&gt;
&gt; I am fortunate in being able to implement open source solutions if they
are
&gt; better and more flexable than commercial products which a lot of products
&gt; are ( Squid / Apache etc ). I've had suggestions from Linux advocates that
&gt; implementation of SAMBA/ OpenLDAP / RADIUS will enable us to remove all
&gt; traces of Windows as an Server environment but others have warned that it
&gt; might not be as easy as it sounds.
&gt;
&gt; I really really REALLY don't want to go down the Microsoft Active
Directory
&gt; path unless that is the " best option" --no flames...and would appreciate
&gt; comments from users who may have had to setup/administer both ?
&gt;
&gt; It appears that LDAP ( in some form ) is becoming an essential tool for
&gt; managing users and resources and as such I really want to make sure the
&gt; solution that is implemented is the right one.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the other threads back a few months ago I'd make these comments
&gt;
&gt; a) iplanet appears to now be replaced by "SUN One directory server" - The
&gt; website does mention Unixes but previous threads indicate it might not be
&gt; supported under linux anymore. www.iplanet.com redirects to SUN
&gt; b)Oracle doesnt seem to be a sensible option since we don't currently use
&gt; Oracle.
&gt; c)Active Directory - Is it possible to set up a single AD based server
which
&gt; then replicates to OpenLDAP or similar. Is the Windows front end for AD
&gt; easier to manage than some of the open source options.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any definitive comparisons ( unbiased ) between the various
&gt; directory services ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;
&gt; Michael
