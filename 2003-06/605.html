For starters, you can't really get 2M ethernet, so someone needs to do 
some throttling of some sort to bring a 10M or 100M service down to 2M, 
which may or may not make it perform more poorly than an E1 which is 
clocked at a constant speed rather than what a shaping or policing 
bucket decides is about 2M. Unless you or your provider setup outbound 
shaping on your end, you may end up sending data at 10M only to have 
some of it dropped at the far end, which may be less desirable than 
having it occur nearer to you (if you want to prioritise some kinds of 
traffic, for example). On the other hand, some places use Frame-Relay 
protocol over E1, which limits the throughput to 1984K anyway.

An E1 will provide more troubleshooting information in the event of a 
failure, and some equipment may provide inbuilt diagnostic facilities 
like loopback testing. Ethernet on the other hand will probably show as 
'up' regardless of it's actual state, and 'ping' is your main tool for 
testing. On an E1, at least you can technically see that it is 'down' 
and possibly have a router employ a backup link as a result, or be able 
to tell the carrier that you can see it down rather than play guessing 
games with Ethernet.

An E1 interface on a router or linux system will be a rare or expensive 
piece of hardware relative to Ethernet.

Finally, an E1 will nearly always be an E1 limited to 2M, whereas an 
ethernet service is (probably) a software upgrade for more speed.
