Or, for a somewhat different take..

(from <A HREF="http://www.abc.net.au/science/wings/episode5.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/science/wings/episode5.htm</A> )

    Jon Casimir: The video recorder was introduced in 1975 and in fact a
    lot of people thought it was a failure. It was only ever thought of
    as what they called a time shifter. It was going to be only used for
    people who wanted to tape a TV program and watch it later. The big
    film companies did not see it as a potential distribution mechanism
    for films. That was not the idea when video came in and in fact the
    first people to spot it was the porn industry and between 75 and
    1983 when it really sort of broke that popular barrier and became a
    mass market item 75% of the sales and rentals in America were
    pornography. The Japanese who invented the VCR were apparently
    astounded that this thing would be used in such a way but as is
    often the case in history inventions are not used for what the
    inventors suspected they would be. 

    Danni Ashe: When VCR's first started to come out you could either
    buy VHS or you could buy Beta and the people who did Beta were
    reluctant to let adult video titles be duplicated on their format
    and so they did what they could to restrict it. The people in VHS
    made no effort to restrict it. And which technology survived? The
    people who wanted to watch adult entertainment they bought a VHS
    machine because they could get more titles.
