&gt;            can anybody tell me the advantages / disadvantages 
&gt; upgrading from mandrake 9.0 to 9.1 . Is it worth the change I have 
&gt; at present a system with Mandrake 9.0 that is working well I have no
&gt; issues with it to speak of .

Apart from the security and bugfixes? I presume you keep your system
updated pretty regularly anyway.  If you don't, you're asking for
trouble.  Upgrading from 9.0 to 9.1 won't give you too much.  I like the
fresh install of MDK9.1 on my machine, but I've never done it as an
upgrade.  BTW, there's still about 200M of updates for 9.1 to download
after it's installed.  It's been around for a while now.

I would just run the mandrake upgrade program and upgrade to the latest
set of packages for MDK9.0.  That is probably the easier option, and
less likely to break something that works well.

&gt; Since i have installed 9.0 I have installed Xine patches , MPlayer
&gt; and ogle for playing dvds , mpeg2 etc I had a few problems initially
&gt; with Xine , ogle and Mplayer the following were my solutions for
&gt; anybody that may have the same issues as I had

I much prefer MPlayer over the other players.  I think it's more robust,
and when it does fail it generally gives some sort of message saying why
it failed.  Kaboodle is quite good as well if you're willing to give
that a try.  Not as pretty as mplayer, but certainly nice to plug into
KDE, and it plays almost as many file types.

&gt; With the nvidia driver installed i can get 200 fps in Q3 it is worth
&gt; the trouble installing this driver it also gives twinview
&gt; capability. A great program for setting up nvidia driver settings
&gt; is Yanc.

I could never get these FPS ratings for games.  What's the refresh rate
of your monitor set to? 85Hz, 75Hz, somewhere around there?  What is the
point of being able to render more frames in a second than you can
actually display?  

My view is that they should focus on achieving the highest video quality
at say 85FPS.  That is a much better test, isn't it?

Adam
