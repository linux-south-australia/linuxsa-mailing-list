Hi All,
    What is wrong with ethereal? Sniffing DHCP packets is easy. What do you
want to specifically know? If it isn't in the packet then one or both of the
machines is making it up as it goes along. Ethereal can filter captured
packets, so you can leave it running and toss the ones you don't want. You
can check the DHCP settings easily enough on each box, and you can calculate
what should be happening and cross check it.

    As for setting up and using ethereal, I was aware of it, but had never
actually had need to use it before I used it at Uni this semester (I was
doing Internetworking after all). It is very straight forward to use. I
installed it on my Linux box from RPMs and it worked first time. I also
downloaded and installed the WinDoze version and it works fine too. It helps
if you understand TCP/IP packet headers, but you don't have to as ethereal
decodes it all for you and it is more or less obvious what you are looking
at.

    Basically to do what you want to do, you must understand exactly what
DHCP does and how. You must also understand what a DHCP packet looks like. I
am assuming that you already know this (or can easily find out) - so using
ethereal to actually see what DHCP is doing should be straight forward. Give
it a try, it is a very powerful and useful tool - Richard Sharpe swears by
it.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; Hmmm, ethereal - there must be a more "elegant" way. Not that its so
important at this stage.
&gt;
&gt; AG.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Sure, it's called ethereal.  If it doesn't decode DHCP packets it may be
a
&gt; &gt;little bit of a brain teaser, but there's a project for you :-)
