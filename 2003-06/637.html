Would this not be a primary opportunity for those in the appropriate
positions to offer to demonstrate the existing OSS within Government and how
it is saving money.

Yes send the letter stating your concerns/approval etc. But those who are
currently in a government department can take it a step further...

&lt;start&gt;
Letter
&lt;snip&gt;
..................... &lt;/snip&gt; we currently run Linux for the following
proposes XYZ and have saved $x0,000 this year. The email you receive is
bought to you by our Linux based email server and protected by a Linux based
firewall. It is clear that OSS is of great benefit to SAUGOV as show by its
massive adoption without the need for any legal bills. ..i trust you guys
get it?...

I know that Adelaide TAFE has a comparatively large range of Linux based OSS
services. We, as could others, point out these services and the cost savings
to the government every year. 

Just a thought.. Will stop them thinking its hardly used backdoor product.

Make sure you email your letter as a Word document with lots of pretty
colours and fonts all saved into the document, and little animated picture
or several to make it "pretty".  Oh yeah, make sure to send HTML email with
a pretty animated logo or several more, a background picture and while
you're at it.. several more annoying crappy fonts in disturbing colour
schemes using Outlook! Really make that point :-p. 
And finally, don't forget to attach a copy of the I Love You virus (and all
of it's derivations) to show how secure that M$ email program is. We
wouldn't want the government using any of that insecure open source stuff
now, would we?

&gt; Maybe we should write some letters supporting Microsoft and pass them 
&gt; through this translator:
&gt;
&gt;<A HREF="http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html">http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; Then the Government will assume Microsoft is just for kidz.
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought ... :-)

&gt; &gt; When does the industry ever see through M$'s marketing hype?  If 
&gt; &gt; they could see through it, there wouldn't be such a widespread 
&gt; &gt; abundance of M$ crappy products everywhere.  The industry generally 
&gt; &gt; naive.  There may be a select few of us who choose not to be 
&gt; &gt; ignorant of the real facts, but the rest of the world doesn't share 
&gt; &gt; our view.  They just want something that looks pretty, has 
&gt; &gt; gazillions of features (that they'll never use anyway) and costs a 
&gt; &gt; lot (didn't you know $$$ == quality). M$ exploits that fact fully for
its own profit.
