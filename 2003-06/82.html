&gt;&gt; Of course this works for a single machine or maybe two. However let's
&gt;&gt; say you had 50 servers scattered around the country, it's a teensy
&gt;&gt; pain to login to each of them manually and then update each package.
&gt;
&gt; If I had fifty machines doing fifty different things then I wouldn't
&gt; have to upgrade each of them twice a week, would I?  If it was
&gt; something they all did then doing it once, on my 'development' machine,
&gt; would probably provide the upgrade package to send to each of my fifty
&gt; machines.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Let's say there are two separate updates released, one on a Monday,
&gt;&gt; you login update the packages on each machine, then another in found
&gt;&gt; Friday. You do it all again. It's a vast waste of time / resources.
&gt;
&gt; The true vast waste of time and resources is upgrading simply because
&gt; you can.

On the other hand, it would be a total abrogation of responsibilities to
ignore critical security updates just because they came out in the same
week, and because I thought it would be a waste of time to protect my
network more often than once a week.
What's missing from the picture so far is information, capability and
knowledge. The sysadmin should keep up to date with current
vulnerabilities of the software and OS being run(Information, Knowledge).
The beauty of the Gentoo and Debian approach is that it is very easy,
therefore I can and I will keep them up to date with the minimum
effort.(Capability).
I think this is a state of mind. I'm not there yet, there is a lot to do
to get up to speed with the systems I manage, but I'm slowly getting
there.
