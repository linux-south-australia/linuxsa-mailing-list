&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm sure the RedHat way is superior... however, it produces inferior
&gt; &gt;&gt; sysadmins. 
&gt; &gt;&gt;
This was the statement I was trying to counter... *shrug*

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; I may have argued this point before, but I still believe that this is
&gt; &gt; not the case.  My philosophy is that people learn by success, which
&gt; &gt; necessarily means doing things the easy way to start with.  This doesn't
&gt; &gt; mean that they're inferior, just not as experienced.  Any decent
&gt; 
&gt; I would claim that someone who is less experienced is almost by definition 
&gt; inferior. This is not an elitism thing,

I agree.  However, if we twist it just a little, we're easily talking
about access and who has it and who doesn't.  Having common standards in
the Unices is a good idea with regard to increasing access.

&lt;pleasant analogy snipped&gt;


&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Someone who learnt the Uern system would not know how to administer Unix...
&gt; &gt;&gt; (which may or may not be ok...) 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I still don't believe this...
&gt; 
&gt; When I say "administer Unix", I mean being aboe to sit infront of any 
&gt; Unix-like machine, and have some reasonable chance of finding their way 
&gt; around...

Not quite convinced still, but that's certainly okay...

&gt;  Personally, I commonly encounter Debian (3.0, 2.2), RedHat 
&gt; (anything from 6.0 on), FreeBSD (3.5 and 5.1), Solaris (8 & 9 on Sparc, 8 on 
&gt; x86), IRIX (6.5) and the occasional "assorted other". Someone who has only 
&gt; ever used the training wheels of RedHat GUIs (or the Uern /newetc -like 
&gt; system) would be in struggle mode when presented with any of these... Not to 
&gt; say they couldn't figure it out, or that they wouldn't be better than 
&gt; someone with no experience... It's entirely subjective (and hypothetical), 
&gt; but I would claim that if all they had seen was GUIs and a 
&gt; customised/unified /etc, they would be lost with a conventional /etc. 
&gt; 
Perhaps, but it could very well be that they knew what was happening
with the GUI tool and be able to find the file that was being changed
with their GUI tool and go change it manually - of course, this is
directly related to level of experience.  Without making it about me, I
found the find tool extremely useful when moving from Red Hat to Solaris
(and it's really not about me because there weren't any decent GUI tools
when I started in Linux).  Of course, when we get work experience type
characters coming through wanting to learn Linux, I'm very careful to
ensure that they know which files are being edited by their fancy GUI
tools that they're so fond of *grin*.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; b) Automated GUI Tool makers, to allow a single purpose tool  
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Noble, but neccessarily involves dumbing down the configuration, IMHO. :)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Nope, making it more accessible.
&gt; 
&gt; I would argue that it's likely to be less accessible for some... 
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, I don't think I am aware of a single config file format that 
&gt; would be simple enough to express trivial config files (eg /etc/hosts) as 
&gt; well as the most complex (eg /etc/named.conf, /etc/httpd.conf and so on) 
&gt; without either sacrificing flexibility for the complex ones, or readability 
&gt; for the simple ones, and while remaining powerful enough to be used as a GUI 
&gt; description too. If one exists, or someone can make one, I will happily 
&gt; stand corrected. 
&gt; 
Technology generally has the habit of achieving the unachievable - it
will come... perhaps not today, and maybe not even tomorrow, but it will
come.  It is the power of the *nices that makes them unique in the
computing world and I'm just not convinced that they're at the end of
their development.  Perhaps I've watched too much Star Trek, but I
honestly believe that computers will only be limited by their users'
power to think (that's not the case now).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; IMHO, this whole attitude reeks of elitism and is a major problem with a
&gt; &gt; lot of Unix SysAdmins and perhaps the problem that anyone will encounter
&gt; &gt; when trying to propose "Linux of The Future".  Thing is, this is not an
&gt; &gt; attitude that I would give you based on your postings so I desperately
&gt; &gt; don't want you to take it to heart.  On the other hand, I've noticed
&gt; &gt; this with myself when comparing Linux SysAdmins and Windows SysAdmins. 
&gt; &gt; Another time for that whole argument though....
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I see your point. I'm not intending to be elitist here. I'm throwing 
&gt; some realistic objections at an interesting and noble idea. It happens to be 
&gt; an idea that I like, but believe is destined to fail, at least, when 
&gt; attempted on the scale that Damien was talking about. Don't let that 
&gt; neccessarily put you or anyone else off -- I'm no expert, and even if an 
&gt; expert said it can't be done, doesn't mean it can't. 
&gt; 
Absolutely.  I'm not put off and I actually understand your frustrations
with the idea being a good one, but destined to fail.  I would
desperately like to be able to see everyone at work have whatever
distro/*nix they wanted to have on their desktops rather than the simple
choice of Solaris, Red Hat or FreeBSD.  All those poor Debian users just
have to put up with Red Hat because of corporate support of applications
and it's just downright rude.  In fact, the Suse and Mandrake users also
miss out - it's stupid.

But I don't want to say that it's impossible.  Am I an optimist? 
Absolutely!  I've seen some remarkable progress in the Linux and general
technology areas (I do work in R&D *grin*), but the challenges you
mention are real.  However, they are not insurmountable (nothing is).


&gt; tough project, and it's one that, while I like the idea, I don't think it 
&gt; would be worth the effort... 
&gt; 
You may be right here, but I'd like to think that you're not.  Anything
is possible and areas in which effort outways gain is part of the reason
we are where we are today (this statement is purposely vague).  Perhaps
if we increase access for the masses by adopting as much of a unified
*nix world, the effort would be worth the gain?  I'm not sure how to get
to this point, but it certainly exists.  Critical mass has wonderful
potential at getting things done.  Of course, this is all balanced
against me wanting my users to have choice and normally choice means
that there are differences... hmmmmm....
