Hey Damien
Oh well, there ya go. Sounds like I should have checked more carefully!! 
I had the download edition from a Linux Format mag out this month, which 
only includes 2 cds. So, I wasn't lucky enough to have the International 
CD 3 and hence my mandrake package manager didn't report the package. 
So, I must rephrase to post to say that the Download Edition that will 
come with most mags will not include the kppp package as it is on the 
3rd disk ;-)

I am interested to note that ya got a winmodem working without any 
hasseles tho, that is very impressive. Did you have to use/configure 
special drivers from the net, or were the packages included with Mandrake???

Cheers
Reece

&gt;Hey,
&gt;
&gt;I installed Mandrake 9.1 on a friends machine and got kppp installed and 
&gt;working with no problems (from the mandrake cd's). I even got his winmodem 
&gt;working with no dramas.
&gt;
&gt;Let's see what the mandrake package manager says about this:
&gt;
&gt;"Name: kdenetwork-kppp
&gt;Version: 3.1-31mdk
&gt;Size: 1558 KB
&gt;Source: International CD (x86) (cdrom3)
&gt;Currently installed version: (none)
&gt;
&gt;Summary: Dialer and front end for pppd"
&gt;
&gt;Well it looks included to me.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Damien

&gt;&gt;Hey everyone
&gt;&gt;Just wanted to share this with everyone who uses Mandrake Linux and who
&gt;&gt;are gunna update to 9.1. I have just upgraded my Linux box from Mandrake
&gt;&gt;9.0 to 9.1. However, still using dial-up 56k modem (god do I need
&gt;&gt;broadband), once I had installed the update, I could not find kppp to
&gt;&gt;dial-up!! Now, after some googling on the net (courtesy of my wifes
&gt;&gt;windoze partition!!), I quickly discovered that support for kppp has
&gt;&gt;since been removed from Mandrake. I am not sure about anyone else here,
&gt;&gt;but in my view gnome-ppp completely sucks and often crashes. So if
&gt;&gt;anyone is in the same boat as me, you are gunna have to download the
&gt;&gt;kppp package and manually install it. I have attached a link for all
&gt;&gt;those who might wanna use it.
