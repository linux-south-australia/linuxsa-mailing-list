&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would you want private variables in a config file in the first place?
&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't think of any instance where a current config file has real
&gt;&gt;&gt;non-user-modifiable information...
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Then I would have...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;                         /config/user/joe
&gt;&gt;                         /config/user/jack
&gt;&gt;                        /config/user/name-of-user
&gt;&gt;                         /config/admiin
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;instead of...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;                         /config
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No I don't want to move user configs out of $HOME because it makes 
&gt;administration harder. 
&gt;
See...I told ya that I didn't have as much exp... :-D

&gt;Often the /home partition is NFS mounted (or at my 
&gt;Uni, /home/$USER is automounted via NFS on the file server whenever you 
&gt;login). 
&gt;
Home seems to be a reasonable place too.

&gt;Having user configs on the local machine smells like how Windows2k 
&gt;does it ("Documents and Settings/$USER"), which I don't like at all.
&gt;  
&gt;
Not everybody uses NFS... ;-)

&gt;The reason I was talking about private variables is to ease the clutter of the 
&gt;GUI (by not having too many options displayed by default), and also to allow 
&gt;the application to store information about itself that is not really meant to 
&gt;be modified by a user (e.g. paths shouldn't need to be changed). e.g. look at 
&gt;xcdroast.conf:
&gt;
&gt;#
&gt;# X-CD-Roast V0.98alpha10 Configuration-File
&gt;#
&gt;# Automatically created by the X-CD-Roast-Setup
&gt;# Don't edit! (Unless you REALLY know what you are doing)
&gt;#
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;This warning was my reason for wanting private areas, perhaps other programs 
&gt;are similar?
&gt;
&gt;I like your idea about keeping the boot scripts in /boot... but I think we 
&gt;should keep /etc as radical changes will never be accepted by anybody :) 
&gt;(though my suggestion is a pretty radical change, 
&gt;
I had similar thoughts then I thought...if its going to be fixed, lets 
really fix it...

&gt;perhaps keeping /etc will 
&gt;make people still feel at home). 
&gt;
See this point too. :-)

&gt;That's why you see people trying to redesign 
&gt;the Linux filesystem layout and not getting a whole lot of support. 
&gt;
Doh!

&gt;People 
&gt;seem to want difficult to type names with capitals and spaces in them, which 
&gt;is no good for doing things via the command line, who wants to type
&gt;
Hopefully not me...

&gt;
&gt;$ cd Documents\ and\ Settings/
&gt;  
&gt;
Yeah, that's gotta go.

&gt;Making sure to get the capital letters correct, etc..
&gt;
&gt;I don't think typing
&gt;
&gt;$ cd /etc/system/services/samba
&gt;$ vi smb.conf
&gt;
&gt;is too much. However tools could be created to ease this. I said in an earlier 
&gt;email that libetc would be capable of searching the /etc tree for config 
&gt;files (either via cache, or search-path just like the linker does when 
&gt;linking to libraries). Tools could be created that use libetc to make finding 
&gt;configuration files easier, e.g.:
&gt;
&gt;$ cfgedit smb.conf
&gt;  
&gt;



&gt;here cfgedit parses the /etc tree and finds smb.conf, then it opens it up in 
&gt;the configured default editor (vi probably, but anything else could be set, 
&gt;pico even).
&gt;  
&gt;
I think that this idea is really cool! :-)   The next debate will be 
between the purists (those that believe a GUI and its complications add 
additional points of failure to the equation) and the pragmatists (those 
that want a familiar tool to Windows to ease the transition for new users.)

&gt;But because the system is now "smart" and managed by software, you could use 
&gt;aliases so you could simply type:
&gt;
&gt;$ cfgedit samba
&gt;
&gt;This is more oriented to what you really want to do, and that is edit the 
&gt;configuration for the samba service. This is even easier than the current 
&gt;system where you would type:
&gt;
&gt;$ vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
&gt;
&gt;That requires knowledge of where samba is and what it calls it's configuration 
&gt;file. Relying on this is no good because everything is stored hap-hazardly 
&gt;throughout the /etc directory. If you wanted to edit proftpd, you would type:
&gt;
&gt;$ vi /etc/proftpd.conf
&gt;
&gt;So why doesn't proftpd have it's own directory?
&gt;
Very strong points IMHO.

&gt;What if you want to edit xdm?
&gt;
&gt;$ vi /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config
&gt;
&gt;The naming convention for the file isn't even consistent!
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you could have other tools for managing the configuration files, e.g:
&gt;
&gt;$ cfgfind samba
&gt;
&gt;returns the path to the samba config file
&gt;
&gt;$ cfgbackup
&gt;
&gt;backs up the current configuration state of the system, perhaps in /etc/backup
&gt;
&gt;$ cfgrestore
&gt;
&gt;restores the last backed up configuration
&gt;
&gt;$ cfgdeploy [config] &lt;HOST&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
That would be very nice!

Cheers,

James Leone
