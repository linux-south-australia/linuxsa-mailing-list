Suse 8.0 box kde 3.1.2

 &gt; Mail is arriving from LinuxSA but my own mail is not getting to the
 &gt; list. There are no error messages. If this mail gets throught (Mozilla
 &gt; Mail) then mutt may not be configured properly. The mail is getting
 &gt; placed in the sent mail folder, and appears to be sent. Last night I
 &gt; sent mail to my address (sent it to myself) but alas nothing returned.

mutt sends to it's local MTA so check the logs of
whichever MTA you're running on the box.

========================================================
Checked /var/log/mail. ...so much info.....got confused.

Mozilla mail appears to work ok.

My /etc/sysconfig/sendmail enclosed.

========================================================
# have a dialup ISDN connection, you probably want to set this to
# "-bd -om" and run "sendmail -q" from your crontab.
#
SENDMAIL_ARGS="-L sendmail -Am -bd -om"

#
# with what parameters should sendmail _client_ be started?
#
SENDMAIL_CLIENT_ARGS="-L sendmail-client -Ac -q30m"

#
# sendmail will only queue email in /var/spool/mqueue and will only start
# to deliver it if "sendmail -q" is run
#
SENDMAIL_EXPENSIVE="yes"

#
# sendmail will not try to canonify hostnames in your email
# so much less DNS-queries are send
# you probably want to enable this on a SENDMAIL_EXPENSIVE system.
# Don't forget to add the local, the mail hub, smart, and mail relay host
# with their IP addresses and the corresponding Full Qualified Domain Names
# to /etc/hosts.  For most # people using dial on demand SENDMAIL_NOCANONIFY
# should work and no NODNS (see /etc/sysconfig/mail) is required.
#
SENDMAIL_NOCANONIFY="yes"

#
# This option forbids DNS-queries.  It requires a well configured
# /etc/hosts. Sendmail users should also read /etc/sysconfig/sendmail
# the description of the variable SENDMAIL_NOCANONIFY.
NODNS="no"

#
# If set to yes, mail that will be delivered via smtp will stay
# in the queue unless someone issues "sendmail -q" or equivalent.
# A correct FQHOSTNAME for the local host is required.
DIALUP="no"

#
# these domains can additional to the local domains be changed
# in /etc/mail/genericstable
#
SENDMAIL_GENERICS_DOMAIN=""

#
# this is useful if you have several domains with disjoint namespaces
# hosted on the same machine.
#
MASQUERADE_DOMAINS=""

#
# enable SMTP AUTHENTICATION to other servers if required, possible
# values are  plain, gssapi, digest-md5, and cram-md5.
# Please not that most providers only know about `plain' which means
# that the user data will not be encrypted.
# You will have to identify yourself using the information in
# /etc/mail/auth/auth-info.
#
SMTP_AUTH_MECHANISMS=""

#
# enable SMTP AUTHENTICATION as a server, for an explanation read
# /usr/share/sendmail/README, /usr/share/doc/packages/sendmail/op.txt.bz2,
# and <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/auth.html.">http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/auth.html.</A>
# Possible values are gssapi, digest-md5, and cram-md5. Note that
# `plain' should be used because data will not be encrypted and
# that more than one value separated by spaces is allowed.
#
SMTP_AUTH_SERVER=""

#
# STARTTLS certification, for an explanation read
# /usr/share/doc/packages/sendmail/op.txt.bz2 and
# <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/starttls.html">http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/starttls.html</A>
# The certification and key files are placed at
# /etc/mail/certs/ as CA.cert.pem, MYServer.cert.pem,
# MYServer.key.pem (for STARTTLS server) and
# MYClient.cert.pem, MYClient.key.pem (for STARTTLS client)
# possible values are `server', `client', or `both'.
