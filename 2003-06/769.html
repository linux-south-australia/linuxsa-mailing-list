Yeah, thats the same chipset that my modem has co-incidentally!! Those 
drivers are a god send, I wish there were more out there for others, but 
that has a lot to do with chipset makers. They are beta tho and as such 
they sometimes crash when dialing up, but there ya go!!

For those of you who haven't seen the website for the linux drivers for 
Conexant chipset based modems, it can be located here:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/">http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/</A>

The website even has a test script to see if you have a modem based on 
the Conexant style chipset and will tell you what type of modem (HSF or 
HCF) that you have.

Cheers
Reece

&gt;I was lucky that it was a Connextant chipset. I downloaded an rpm for Mandrake 
&gt;9.1 from the vendors website (well an affiliate vendor that makes the Linux 
&gt;drivers), and all I had to do was "rpm -ivh blah-blah.rpm", and the scripts 
&gt;in the rpm package set everything up and loaded the driver (including 
&gt;creating a symbolic link for /dev/modem). Couldn't have been easier.

&gt;&gt;Hey Damien
&gt;&gt;Oh well, there ya go. Sounds like I should have checked more carefully!!
&gt;&gt;I had the download edition from a Linux Format mag out this month, which
&gt;&gt;only includes 2 cds. So, I wasn't lucky enough to have the International
&gt;&gt;CD 3 and hence my mandrake package manager didn't report the package.
&gt;&gt;So, I must rephrase to post to say that the Download Edition that will
&gt;&gt;come with most mags will not include the kppp package as it is on the
&gt;&gt;3rd disk ;-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am interested to note that ya got a winmodem working without any
&gt;&gt;hasseles tho, that is very impressive. Did you have to use/configure
&gt;&gt;special drivers from the net, or were the packages included with
&gt;&gt;Mandrake???
&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I installed Mandrake 9.1 on a friends machine and got kppp installed and
&gt;&gt;&gt;working with no problems (from the mandrake cd's). I even got his winmodem
&gt;&gt;&gt;working with no dramas.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Let's see what the mandrake package manager says about this:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;"Name: kdenetwork-kppp
&gt;&gt;&gt;Version: 3.1-31mdk
&gt;&gt;&gt;Size: 1558 KB
&gt;&gt;&gt;Source: International CD (x86) (cdrom3)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently installed version: (none)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Summary: Dialer and front end for pppd"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Well it looks included to me.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Damien

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey everyone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just wanted to share this with everyone who uses Mandrake Linux and who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are gunna update to 9.1. I have just upgraded my Linux box from Mandrake
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;9.0 to 9.1. However, still using dial-up 56k modem (god do I need
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;broadband), once I had installed the update, I could not find kppp to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dial-up!! Now, after some googling on the net (courtesy of my wifes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;windoze partition!!), I quickly discovered that support for kppp has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;since been removed from Mandrake. I am not sure about anyone else here,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;but in my view gnome-ppp completely sucks and often crashes. So if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anyone is in the same boat as me, you are gunna have to download the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kppp package and manually install it. I have attached a link for all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;those who might wanna use it.
