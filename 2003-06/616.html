&gt;Wierd. I treat bits of paper on my desk as candidates for the 
&gt;bin. I _keep_ and
&gt;_read_ emails. Are all pollies this far out of date?

I hate to burst your bubble, but yes, I think you'll find many pollies
are this far out of date.  I deal with many government executive staff
at a level not too far down from the pollies and if that experience is
anything to go by then you have pollies with IT-experience/appreciation
ranging from Amish to semi-geek abilities, no disrespect to either group ;)

It's also an interesting point that the more IT savvy an executive is, the
more likely you are to gain support within the organisation for doing 
business with IT rather than having them avoid it like the plague and
treating it
like a "nice to have" gimmick rather than an essential means of running
an organisation in the 21st century.

Personally, I'd be sending letters, emails, phone calls, notes wrapped
around 
bricks and thrown through their office window...oh...err, bumper stickers, 
blimps, whatever your preference :) but....

...need I start the thread again that the bill is myopic in its focus, it 
should be looking at standards, not software.  Working in government
myself, I seriously doubt that a mandate for open source software will
1) be passed in the House, 2) be implemented easily by govt. departments, 
or 3) be practical anyway as most of our systems are proprietary and written
to
suit specific needs (note: I am not referring to the "standard" desktop OS 
and software)

Just my 4c
