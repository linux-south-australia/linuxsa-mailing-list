Patrick,

&gt; A teacher here at school asked me about the development of 
&gt; computers of the last 20-30 years or so, as they want to 
&gt; explain the exponential growth rate of computers to their students.

how old are these students?

&gt; 
&gt; They would like to make a statement like;
&gt; 
&gt; "It took us x years to develop the 1.0GHz chip and x months 
&gt; to go from 1.0GHz to 2.0GHz....."
&gt; 
&gt; I know it took years to get to 1.0GHz and almost no time to 
&gt; go to 2.0GHz but I'm after some info to fill in the blanks a 
&gt; little more accuratly.

Of course, CPU power is more than just MHz/GHz...

&gt; 
&gt; A Friday afternoon brain bender :-)

Why not mention Moore's law as the basis (the # of transistors per chip
would double every 18 months) -- this could be translated into lay
person's terms as "CPU power doubles, on average, every 18 months"...

<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/research/silicon/mooreslaw.htm">http://www.intel.com/research/silicon/mooreslaw.htm</A>

Someone with a good memory (or more time for googleing) might like to
find the speeds the processors on that graph were released at...

It could be worth (depending on the age and interest level of the
students) inventing an analogy to describe the relationship between
clock speed, # of transistors, and the resultant CPU "power". You could
say something like with a bicycle, clock speed is how fast you pedal,
having more transistors is like having more gears (which it isn't, but
it's a weak analogy I made up on the spot), and the total "power" is
like how fast you actually go...
