&gt;I don't believe Toshiba, by bundling Microsoft Windows with their
&gt;equipment, have engaged in Third Line forcing.  As I understand it,
&gt;Toshiba don't require you to purchase or lease anything from Microsoft.
&gt;Toshiba supply Windows to you under an agreement between them and
&gt;Microsoft.  Without the requirement that you deal with Microsoft, there
&gt;is no third party.
&gt;

If there is no 3rd party, then how can the Microsoft EULA possibly be 
enforcable? Where is the consideration from Microsoft to make their 
contract binding?

I would suggest that Toshiba are forcing the purchaser into a 
transaction with a 3rd party by supplying a 3rd party's shrinkwrap 
contract for the purchaser to be bound to. If they bundled in a 
Microsoft mouse with the laptop, there would be no third line forcing, 
but they're not, they're forcing you into an agreement that is not with 
them.

I don't have a copy of the Toshiba windows licencing with me, but I 
would guess that you're not allowed to sell the windows component of the 
product to someone else. I've never seen a licence that doesn't permit 
you to sell the hardware part of your laptop when you no longer need it, 
so I would seem clear that a purchaser ends up with 2 different products 
sold under 2 different terms and conditions in the one transaction, one 
of which is forced by the other.
