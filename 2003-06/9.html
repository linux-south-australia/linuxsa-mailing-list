&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems that FreeBSD includes things like sendmail in the base
&gt; &gt; system, which is something that irritated me with Debian (though Debian
&gt; &gt; installs exim by default). I want to choose my own MTA. Likewise with
&gt; &gt; things like bind... (why IS that -- it seems somewhat arbitrary that
&gt; &gt; these things should be included in FreeBSD's or Debian's base
&gt; &gt; repository?)...
&gt; 
&gt; cos you need an MTA of some sort?

Perhaps you do... still, it would be nicer to let you choose (which,
in Debian's case, should be close to trivial, and in FreeBSD's case,
not quite so easy, as the MTA's are part of a different installation
method...)

&gt; yes you get exim with debian, I prefer postfix so I do:
&gt; "apt-get install postfix" after installation to replace it.

Yes, I do similar, but it's still annoying. FreeBSD doesn't appear
to give you a simple way of uninstalling sendmail.

&gt; 
&gt; Did you only use debian woody before?  why not "testing"?
&gt; I use woody for servers, testing for desktops but in practise
&gt; testing is just as stable.

I've used woody (3.0), potato (2.2) and slink (2.1). I tried using
unstable (woody) once a few years back, and regretted it. I haven't
tried testing, and while i think it could be ok for desktops, I
wouldn't use it on servers for reasons you and others appear to agree
with. My problem here is primarily about servers, so this is not a
solution that will work for me.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the debian users on
this list for their efforts in trying to convince me that debian
does in fact suit my needs. However, while it does come closer to
doing so than RedHat and others, it does not come close enough. Sorry
if this offends anyone :)
