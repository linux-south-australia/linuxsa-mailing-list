&gt;Mark,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;What are you talking about, David?  If you installed a third party
&gt;&gt;package, it's in /usr/local/etc.  If it came from freebsd.org, it's
&gt;&gt;in /etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's pretty basic, isn't it?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
Yes, but a memorizable fact does not make it logical.

&gt;Yes, and I was saying I do actually understand it (believe it or not). It's the
&gt;reason I keep on saying it annoys me as opposed to I find it illogical.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think your confusion stems from long-term exposure to Linux
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
Confused?  How can any logic be stated for not having cross platform 
compatability?


&gt;&gt;distributions, which have done a disservice to their users by
&gt;&gt;consistently muddying the waters about the distinction between 
&gt;&gt;the base operating system and the add-on packages. 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
What is the logic to separating packages?

&gt;True.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;How many people who were introduced to UNIX via RedHat have any idea that
&gt;&gt;Gnome and X-Windows aren't part of the OS, and that there's a genuine
&gt;&gt;difference between them and, say, inetd? 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
I find it more logical if the files were all found in one directory 
called /config.  There is no logic tie between the name /etc, which means

   1. A number of unspecified persons or things.
   2. etceteras Additional odds and ends; extras.

Configuration files are important and specific.  Yes, reasons have been 
laid out for placing files in particular areas, but are they logical 
reasons?

:-)

Cheers,

James Leone
