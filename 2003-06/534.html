Hi Jason (and others),
    When I manufactured custom cables for a living (all those years ago), a
dongle was a copy protection device that usually plugged into a port. It
usually took the form of say a DB25 connector with a few soldered
connections between pins, but also could take the form of said DB25 with a
small amount of cable dangling from it with resistors or other electronic
components hanging off it. It could also have a second cable plugged into it
on occasion for any reason. However, a dongle was only the name it was
unofficially known as but became official as it became into common use - it
was less of a mouthful than "Solid State Copy Protection Device". As far as
I am aware, it sounded good and so people started using it.

    As for the cable that hangs (dangles) from a PCMCIA Card, I would
suggest that it became known as a dongle for similar reasons because some
early networking cards had a similar arrangement of a device with a bit of
cable dangling from it (this was often, but not always, simply a gender
changer of some description before the advent of modern gender changers).

    As I also recall, other words that became into specific things but had
been around for ages before they became those things through common use.
TWAIN stands for Technology Without An Interesting Name, and is/was used for
driving early scanners and is now built into WinDoze and other operating
systems. I was told that it was in common use in the 70s, but didn't become
anything until it was Trademarked in the 80s.

    Widgets also were just a generic word in common use for thingamies and
other whatsits and had been in use for at least 40 years as an Economics
term for a mythical manufactured item, before they became part of most GUI
programming Toolkits.

    So in the end, there may or may not be an answer to your argument. Mind
you - using your friends argument:

&gt; I've always been told it's a dongle, but a colleague of mine insists that
it
&gt; can't be, because dongles are usually something that you plug into a port
in
&gt; order to get a bit of software to work (obviously that's a very rough
&gt; overview).

Have you ever tried to get TCP/IP Networking (ah software) to work if you
don't plug the dongle into the Ethernet PCMCIA dongle port (well there is
the port) with a live Networking cable plugged into the other end. You can
communicate with the Networking Card, but not the Network so how does your
network client server software work?

&gt; He suggested it was a PCMCIA to Ethernet adpater, but I didn't think that
&gt; was right, because it's the Ethernet card that plugs into the PCMCIA slot,
&gt; not the... dongle.

It cannot be a PCMCIA adapter because there are no common pinouts that
directly convert across from Ethernet to PCMCIA (Cat 5 cable is 2 pairs and
a shield - PCMCIA is about 30 pins). The actual PCMCIA port is a data bus
port. The PCMCIA Ethernet card interfaces with the PCMCIA port, but actually
does the processing on board, and this then uses the dongle port to send and
receive data on the network. In this case, the dongle cable is actually an
adapter cable because there are common pinouts in the dongle port and the
Ethernet socket that directly connect and no processing is done by the
cable. Well I have no solid evidence to back this up other than almost 20
years experience, but I hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
