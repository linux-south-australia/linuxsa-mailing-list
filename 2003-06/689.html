I really apologise, but I had to take my frustration out on somebody! 

I was always taught to help people, and to see a company deliberately go out 
of their way to cause such a large amount of trouble to severely damage 
another company and as much as cripple a part of it absolutely disgusts me. 

Not only are "taking their bat and going home" and chucking a hissy-fit at 
IBM, but they are also going to be causing a great deal of people, who have 
unwittingly become involved in this stupid argument at no fault of their 
own. 

Even though SCO will no longer have IBM as competition to their proprietary 
version of UNIX, they will also have lost the respect, and most likely the 
custom of almost anybody who has read about what is going on. 

Maybe IBM should instead turn its attention to making use of some flavor of 
Linux to replace AIX. Rather than pay the licencing fees to SCO, these funds 
could be paid to whatever company they choose to obtain Linux from, which 
would greatly support current and future development of the product. 

Okay, I have had my morning bitching session, and have it out of my system. 
If anybody wishes to bitch back, please feel free!
