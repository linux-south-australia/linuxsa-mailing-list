&gt; For once I think you have it wrong.  :-)
&gt; Maybe the example was poorly chosen?   Point is that cocoa is an 
&gt; integral part of Coco Pops.  No cocoa, no Coco Pops.
&gt; The same cannot be said of Toshiba laptops.  The computer 
&gt; would still be 
&gt; a computer with or without an OS.

I reckon this would be a tough line to draw in a court. Maybe the eg
isn't great, but it's close. Perhaps it's more like trying to buy a car
without wheels and tyres... It's still a car, with or without wheels and
tyres. It's not very useeful, and 99% of people are going to want the
standard wheel/tyre combination. But some people don't. Some people want
to put impractically large wheels on, presumably so they can drive up
and down Hindley street that little bit faster.

So, if you want to get a custom wheel/tyre combination, you can't buy
one without wheels or tyres, and it wouldn't be all that surprising if
the dealer refused to take your originals as a trade-in and fit custom
ones for you (though, I suspect they would). Basically, if Holden decide
that a Commodore Executive comes with these wheels and those tyres, you
may well be stuck paying for a set you didn't want. Difference is, of
course, that you can actually sell them later, whereas the OS licence is
non-transferrable.

I think what Toshiba (and MS) are trying to do is say that a Computer
without an OS *isn't* a computer at all, and everyone wants Windows. I
wish they wouldn't do that, and I think it's short-sighted, and will
cost them in the end. However, I don't really think it's likely to be
completely illegal. If I make product X, which uses a Computer in it,
should you be able to specify or change the computer for some other
brand? Tough call.

IMHO, the only way companies will actually change is when it's
demonstrably profitable to do so, and this will come when MS ceases
doing deals that restrict their clients' business (ie we'll sell you
cheap windows if you only ever install windows...)

&gt; I think it was Dan Shearer who mentioned a while back that 
&gt; what Toshiba 
&gt; is doing is "third line forcing", ie you have agreed to purchase one 
&gt; product but are forced to purchase another product you might not want 
&gt; at the same time.  Third line forcing is an offence.

Except that you aren't, *quite*. You're buying an integrated system --
laptop and OS. It's not a bundle, per se, it's integrated.

&gt; How much energy the ACCC would put into stopping this practice of 
&gt; Toshiba's, bearing in mind the minority effect, is the issue.

None -- if anything, they could go after MS for imposing conditions like
that on Toshiba...
