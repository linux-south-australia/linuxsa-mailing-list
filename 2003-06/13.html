&gt; Me again,

Hi, me.  ("His father's name was Hymie ...")

&gt; Linux has better FS support -- or rather, more options. It has a
&gt; journalling filesystem (or three -- ext3, reiserfs, XFS, with JFS to
&gt; come, as I understand).

JFS is already here, and has been for some time.  Whether "official
distributions" include it or not is another matter.

&gt; FreeBSD has two levels of partitioning -- the DOS Primary partitions,
&gt; which FreeBSD calls slices, and the FreeBSD partitions, within those
&gt; slices (sort of like DOS Extended, but not readable by much else).

You also have logical volumes pretty much built into FreeBSD under the
guise of Vinum.  On a FreeBSD machine I typically set up a root
directory on ad0s1a, then configure the remainder of the disk(s) on
ad?s2, and vinum that (well, set up the e partition to cover all of
slice 2).  Then carve the remainder of your filesystems out of Vinum,
which gets you over the 7 partition limit and allows for future
expansion, not to mention several varieties of RAID configuration.

&gt; SMP is rumoured to be more mature and faster under Linux, though
&gt; this doesn't matter much to me anyway. I understand that FreeBSD
&gt; 5.0 brings major improvements, though I don't know if that means
&gt; it's equal to Linux.

I think kernel level threads were also an issue that 5.0 was meant
to start addressing, but I haven't delved too deeply into FreeBSD
as a development platform yet.
