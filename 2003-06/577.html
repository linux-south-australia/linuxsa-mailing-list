Hi

I'm in a similar predicament, my phone line and all phone lines in the
street are on a sub-exchange which I think is like saying a RIMM. There
is no cable in my street and no time frame for either changing. I may
wait for untimed ISDN or there's supposed to be some upgrades coming in
September but Telstra aren't saying where.

&gt; Well guys I have had it.
&gt; Internode kindly asked helstra to have the line checked with the 'old 
&gt; cable' I believe and it was rejected on poor quality.
&gt; No one seems to have wireless broadband for us unfortunates. So all I can 
&gt; say is FSCK them. I'm puting up wireless to a friends house to solve 'the 
&gt; unsolvable' and I'll keep you posted on any issues that arrise. Oh and of 
&gt; course how it all works out.
&gt; Plz don't start on the legals I have read it all, and been through the 
&gt; telcos docs (sheesh) If I get heat I'll make every part of it public.
