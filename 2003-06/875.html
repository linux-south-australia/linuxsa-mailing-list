&gt; &gt; And I'd DARE anyone to tell a recruiter that they're too lazy 
&gt; &gt; to cut and paste from word and that they're technically 
&gt; &gt; incomptent nincompoops...I wonder whether you'd get a job.
&gt; 
&gt; Why would anyone want to say that to them? For a start, it should be
&gt; patently obvious to them that they are technically incompetant (in fact, I
&gt; don't think I've ever met a recruiter who wouldn't make this claim about
&gt; themselves), but that this is entirely irrelevant to anything. It would be
&gt; tantamount to them saying to me that I don't know the first thing about the
&gt; recruitment industry...

Ah, but you do. It's a difficult obstacle in the path to a job. 
They should be easing that path, if they want you to grace their hands
with a percentage of your income ...

cheers,

Kim
