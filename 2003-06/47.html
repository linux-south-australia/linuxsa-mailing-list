&gt; &gt; I have just been doing a spate of upgrading and was wondering just how
&gt; &gt; up-to-date Linux distros were getting.

&gt; Hi Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently purchased an Asus A7V8X motherboard with an AMD 2700+ CPU, 512Mb 
&gt; PC2700 RAM, Nvidia GEForce 4 Ti4200, Pioneer DVD, Lite-on CD-RW drive, WD 120Gb 
&gt; hard drive.  It has Broadcom Gigabyte ethernet, RAID, firewire and USB 2.0 on 
&gt; the motherboard.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently installed Red Hat 9 on this box.  Surprisingly everything, including 
&gt; ethernet, graphics card, firewire, usb 2.0 all were autorecognised and 
&gt; configured.  My legacy serial 56k rockwell chipset modem was autodetected and 
&gt; configured.  Also my PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge card and Orinoco WLAN card were 
&gt; autodetected and configured.  In essence, everything worked out of the box with 
&gt; no fiddling at all[1][2].
&gt; 
&gt; So yes, Linux can handle pretty much bleeding edge stuff, but YMMV depending 
&gt; upon which specific hardware you have[3].

Yes. Especially if you load a very recent kernel on it, which is probably what
comes with RedHat 9?

I wonder how well one of the new Intel 865 chipsets runs (or are we up to 875
already?), has anyone done that yet?

&gt; 
&gt; [1] Ok, so I don't have Nvidia's binary drivers installed yet.  So no DRI.  But 
&gt; it's fast already.  I'll get to that soon. :-)
&gt; [2] One thing didn't work, and that was the RAID controller :-(  Maybe time to 
&gt; start playing with that in my copious spare time. lol.
&gt; [3] When I bought all this stuff, I checked google and there were plenty of 
&gt; stuff that said a lot of things wouldn't work.  Amazingly, a lot of stuff _did_ 
&gt; work, telling me that support for new kit moves quickly.
