Just a further update, after all email going down friday its now 10:30 
monday morning and they haven't resolved the problem. its been three 
days and they are providing a 24 hour business service and they still 
haven't fixed the problem!?!?!?!?!?!!!!

According to their tech support its only their business customers that 
are effected hows that for good management

&gt; We use senet for our work and of the last 72 hours all hell has broken 
&gt; loose. They have converted mail.senet.com.au over to a sydney server, 
&gt; all or mail aliases have disappeared, we now cannot currently recieve 
&gt; work email, basically everything has gone to the sh%$ter. And to top 
&gt; it off for some reason Mozilla can not use the sydney smtp server and 
&gt; they have no intention of fixing this.
&gt;
&gt; We'll be moving to a new provider in the next week or so

&gt;&gt; As I move from desktop/place to desktop/place I rely to a degree on 
&gt;&gt; Webmail.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Currently I have 100s of e-mails I haven't downloaded which I can't 
&gt;&gt; access.
&gt;&gt; Yes I've neglected to back them up.  Each day however, I'm told it 
&gt;&gt; will be
&gt;&gt; rectified by the end of the day.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I concur with Michael that it isn't the technical people working for 
&gt;&gt; Ozemail,
&gt;&gt; but the those less competent people at the top who are making the 
&gt;&gt; short sighted
&gt;&gt; decisions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Although I feel much happier now - as I have signed up with Internode 
&gt;&gt; :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. The personal touch: If you have an OzEmail, Business Pack, Family 
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pack, WOW, Access1, Camtech, SE Net, Harvey Norman, Packard Bell, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; PowerUp, Voyager, Gateway or winNET account, you can use MyMail to 
&gt;&gt;&gt; access your existing email service. Simply enter your full email 
&gt;&gt;&gt; address and password and click the login button.
&gt;&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I understand your other objections, but not this one... Are you 
&gt;&gt; saying this
&gt;&gt; is the only way to access your email, or that it's a painful webmail 
&gt;&gt; system,
&gt;&gt; or that the username is too long, or just that webmail exists?
