Hi All,
    I have only skimmed this thread and didn't really pick up on what
prompted this particular part of it, but I do know a little about helping
people in need and being sued for various reasons. I am not a lawyer, but
since it is an important topic, they cover it fairly extensively in some
circles like first aid courses etc. I do hold a current Senior First Aid,
and this is how I understand any good Samaritan laws work all over
Australia.

    Firstly, you cannot be sued for negligence if you assist an unconscious
person (who may be dead or dying) who later do indeed die or recover but
with some injury like paralysis provided they are better off than if you had
left them alone and you have provided assistance as you were trained to do.
If you were attempting to assist that person and you made a genuine mistake
in that assistance that may have caused some injury you cannot be sued. If
you arrive at the scene of the accident and either choose not to assist a
person or decide that you can no longer assist that person and stop and they
die or deteriorate you cannot be sued.

    Basically what you can be sued for is if they are conscious and tell you
not to do something and you do - but as soon as they fall unconscious they
can no longer either decide for themselves or change their mind so if you
assist them, even if they told you not to previously, you now cannot be
sued. If you have been trained in first aid and deliberately do something
wrong, and you know it is wrong and something happens, i.e. death etc., you
can be sued, but if you make an honest mistake, then that is o.k. you cannot
be sued. If you are a Doctor, or an emergency/rescue worker or paramedic and
you refuse to help someone and they die etc., you can be sued, but if you
are simply a first aider, then there is no legal obligation for you to
assist (morally you may feel like crap, and someone may try to sue you by
playing on the guilt you may feel, but they cannot win unless you let them -
legally they have nothing to stand on). If you have no confidence, or are
physically or mentally exhausted and stop giving assistance once you have
started, you cannot be sued.

    Basically it comes down to if you do your best, and the person is better
off than when you found them and you don't do anything deliberately wrong,
you cannot be sued. If they were unconscious - there is not necessarily any
way to tell if they had spinal injuries for instance - if they live and are
paralysed after you saved them and all you did was helped, then they are
better off. Alive is better than dead. As a first aider, you are only
trained in simple techniques of life support, you are not expected to do the
ER tricks, you are there to simply keep someone alive if you can. You have
no legal obligation to help because you are not a Professional like a Doctor
or Paramedic. The whole point of the law being written this way was to
encourage people to assist when they can with no fear of litigation. Idiots
who sue because they can or think they can  - lose, and you as a first aider
have nothing to fear.

    Duty of Care only applies in doing what you have been trained to do. If
you have been taught CPR and you do it as you have been taught - you are
fine. If you crack a patients chest with a knife and hand pump their heart
because you saw it on Chicago Hope - look forward to prison and a huge fine.
Duty of Care also does not apply if you are physically or mentally unable to
continue until help arrives and you stop. Anyhow, I hope this has helped
clarify your thoughts. If you have any doubts, give your local first aid
trainer a call and check it out with them. As long as you do your best, you
have nothing to fear.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; At the time, my friend was probably being the "selfless hero" and trying
to
&gt; help with little knowledge of what was to come, or what could possibly
come.
&gt;
&gt; Now that I have Senior First Aid, there is some question of duty of care.
I
&gt; am a little unclear of who I have to help, and who I can leave alone, but
I
&gt; know that the moment I even stop to check on someone, I am obliged to help
&gt; them to the furthest extent that I can, covered by my training and own
&gt; physical abilities.
&gt;
&gt; I am sorry to say that it is probably easier to just not pay attention and
&gt; keep walking past. I could never do this, regardless of the consequences,
I
&gt; would have to stop and help.

&gt; &gt; I was under the impression that "Good Samaritan" laws covered this
loophole. Because we all remember the issue of a doctor making the choice to
save or not save a person hit by a car.. if they are left to die then they
can be sued (be relatives i guess), if the are "mostly" saved (like this
swimming person you told about), they may also be able to sue...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is one to do...?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; AG.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I know the trends in this day and age, but I really hate,
&gt; &gt;&gt; detest and loathe
&gt; &gt;&gt; how people, out of the goodness of their hearts can go to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; trouble to
&gt; &gt;&gt; organise a cool event (as cool as this as going to be!) only
&gt; &gt;&gt; to have it
&gt; &gt;&gt; devastated by someone who would sue! sue! sue! It really is
&gt; &gt;&gt; amazing how many
&gt; &gt;&gt; people would do this to the closest of friends. You see it on
&gt; &gt;&gt; TV all the
&gt; &gt;&gt; time.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; A friend of mine and I have always been interested and involved in
&gt; &gt;&gt; lifesaving. We have the relevant awards, qualifications, etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt; He lives over
&gt; &gt;&gt; in Queensland now. One time, he was at the beach, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; attempted a rescue on
&gt; &gt;&gt; a man who had got into trouble after jumping off a jetty. If
&gt; &gt;&gt; he hadn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; rescued him, the man would have died. However, the man had
&gt; &gt;&gt; sustained spinal
&gt; &gt;&gt; injuries from his jump, and these were aggravated by my
&gt; &gt;&gt; friend's rescue, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; the man lost his ability to walk. It was later proved that
&gt; &gt;&gt; had the man been
&gt; &gt;&gt; left, he would have drowned, but also would have retained his
&gt; &gt;&gt; ability to
&gt; &gt;&gt; walk. The original spinal injury was his fault, for jumping
&gt; &gt;&gt; into shallow
&gt; &gt;&gt; water from a jetty. With this behind him, he successfully
&gt; &gt;&gt; sued my friend for
&gt; &gt;&gt; some exorbetent amount. Fortunately, at the time, we were
&gt; &gt;&gt; both teaching at
&gt; &gt;&gt; swimming centres, and the insurance was still active. But
&gt; &gt;&gt; which would you
&gt; &gt;&gt; prefer? Dying and being able to walk or living and being
&gt; &gt;&gt; unable to walk?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It often puts alot of people off even considering organising
&gt; &gt;&gt; something. Why
&gt; &gt;&gt; can't people just appreciate what they get given?!? At least
&gt; &gt;&gt; the licences on
&gt; &gt;&gt; relevant software provide a little bit of a safe-haven for
&gt; &gt;&gt; the programmers
&gt; &gt;&gt; using them with their programs in the areas of warranty, etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; If people do things that are their own fault, like jump off
&gt; &gt;&gt; jetties into
&gt; &gt;&gt; water shallower than their own height or stick their fingers in power
&gt; &gt;&gt; outlets and get electrocuted, why should the person who comes
&gt; &gt;&gt; to their aid,
&gt; &gt;&gt; or the owner of the power outlet be penalised for someone
&gt; &gt;&gt; else's stupid
&gt; &gt;&gt; action?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry about all this, people. I just feel particularly
&gt; &gt;&gt; strongly about this,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and combining that with just waking up, I really needed to
&gt; &gt;&gt; air my opinion on
&gt; &gt;&gt; the matter. I hope it is relevant to some of you.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Speak to you all soon, and as always, I love listening to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; interesting
&gt; &gt;&gt; conversation that passes back and foward through this mailing list.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Especially in the early hours of the morning... Should this
&gt; &gt;&gt; boot camp go
&gt; &gt;&gt; ahead, I will be there as quickly as I can pedal my bike! I
&gt; &gt;&gt; would greatly
&gt; &gt;&gt; enjoy such an event.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; David,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is this a sleep over? Will dormitories/other sleeping
&gt; &gt;&gt; arrangements be
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; required? Food? Drinks? Will you allow alcohol (it sounds
&gt; &gt;&gt; like a good
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Alcohol, a few beers by the barby/laptop would be the go i'd say.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; idea until someone drops a jug of beer on George's new

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Get insurance - its worth it - believe me :)
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; need money sponsors? What happens if I get electrocuted at
&gt; &gt;&gt; the party?
