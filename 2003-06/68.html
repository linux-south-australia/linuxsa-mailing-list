&gt;&gt; I disagree.  This "mix and match" mentality takes a lot of time, and I
&gt;&gt; have better things to do with my time.
&gt;
&gt; Really?  I'm truly surprised.

That I have better things to do with my time?  Believe me, it's true.

&gt; My very clear experience, garnered from decades of experience, is
&gt; that most machines, once running, are used for fairly specific
&gt; purposes and often don't need upgrading for years and years and
&gt; years.

I suppose it depends on the machine and what you're using it for.
It's true enough for things like the AUUG web server, but less so for
personal machines.  But that's a red herring: Either way, I can't see
any advantage in doing unnecessary work.

&gt; When they do need an upgrade, I can generally just get, configure
&gt; and compile the latest version of whatever package I'm upgrading,
&gt; and it's often a no-brainer.

s/often/sometimes/.  Certainly not always, in any case.

&gt; Sometimes I have to get a recent library or three,

Why?  The port should take care of that kind of dependency.

&gt;&gt; FreeBSD is almost identical?  Well, yes, there's only one
&gt;&gt; "distribution" :-)
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if, when SCO provide their evidence, we'll find the same
&gt; code in FreeBSD, which would indicate that it's (the code) already
&gt; unencumbered.

No, that would indicate that (if they have any money left) they'll go
after FreeBSD too.

I would *really* like to see some evidence that they have stolen code
from Linux.  That would be so funny.
