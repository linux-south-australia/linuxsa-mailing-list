&gt; &gt; &gt;Why would you want private variables in a config file in the first place?
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't think of any instance where a current config file has real
&gt; &gt; &gt;non-user-modifiable information...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then I would have...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;                          /config/user/joe
&gt; &gt;                          /config/user/jack
&gt; &gt;                         /config/user/name-of-user
&gt; &gt;                          /config/admiin
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; instead of...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;                          /config
&gt; 
&gt; No I don't want to move user configs out of $HOME because it makes 
&gt; administration harder. Often the /home partition is NFS mounted (or at my 
&gt; Uni, /home/$USER is automounted via NFS on the file server whenever you 
&gt; login). Having user configs on the local machine smells like how Windows2k 
&gt; does it ("Documents and Settings/$USER"), which I don't like at all.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason I was talking about private variables is to ease the clutter of the 
&gt; GUI (by not having too many options displayed by default), and also to allow 
&gt; the application to store information about itself that is not really meant to 
&gt; be modified by a user (e.g. paths shouldn't need to be changed). e.g. look at 
&gt; xcdroast.conf:

Well, you can use the file permitions to make it editable by only
whomever you want. You know where the users config files are now they
are now (home directory, prefixed with .) I think your saying that there
sould be a way to have only a part of a config file editable so users
can make changes without being able to tamper with the more advanced
functions? I see this as what the gui is for. People can make gui config
tools which list out the options for the user who is no guru and this
tool can omit any advanced options, or have a selectable advanced mode.
Then if the user knows what they are doing and need more flexability
they can edit the config file directly at their own risk (or they cant
if they dont have root access and the syadmin doesnt want them too)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; $ cd Documents\ and\ Settings/
&gt; 
&gt; Making sure to get the capital letters correct, etc..

Well, typically all you have to do is "cd Do&lt;tab&gt;" and you should be
right. Agreed, I don't like that naming convention though, and it raises
the issue of whether to be case sensitive or not. Traditionally of
course unix is, but now we see some gui apps that are and some that
arnt. Conformity would be nice! Its a hard one though, because some of
the time case sensitivity is advantageous, and sometimes its a pain, and
means checking both options till you find what you want.

 &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; $ cfgedit smb.conf
&gt; 
&gt; here cfgedit parses the /etc tree and finds smb.conf, then it opens it up in 
&gt; the configured default editor (vi probably, but anything else could be set, 
&gt; pico even).

Well, you could go "locate smb.conf" unless its been moved since the
slocate database was last updated, but I doubt you'd move config files
anyway...
 
&gt; $ vi /etc/proftpd.conf
&gt; 
&gt; So why doesn't proftpd have it's own directory?

True, some conformity here would be nice, but if you are typing vi
/etc/pro&lt;tab&gt; or similar you'll get either proftpd.conf or a proftpd.d/
(or similar) directory, and so it should be pretty intuitive.

&gt; What if you want to edit xdm?
&gt; 
&gt; $ vi /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config
&gt; 
&gt; The naming convention for the file isn't even consistent!

True, thats an odd location by comparison, but you still have the locate
tool to tell you where the file is, and the man pages to tell you the
name of the file and related files.
 
&gt; Maybe you could have other tools for managing the configuration files, e.g:
&gt; 
&gt; $ cfgfind samba
&gt; 
&gt; returns the path to the samba config file

locate smb.conf :)

&gt; $ cfgbackup
&gt; 
&gt; backs up the current configuration state of the system, perhaps in /etc/backup

tar -czvf "/mnt/backups/`date`.tar.gz" /etc

True its not as simple, but thats the trade off for more power. Plus
people who already know how to do it one way, are unlikely to want to be
forced to learn another.

&gt; $ cfgrestore
&gt; 
&gt; restores the last backed up configuration
&gt; 
&gt; $ cfgdeploy [config] &lt;HOST&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; synchronises the configuration of this server with HOST, over ssh (where the 
&gt; optional option "config" is the name of a configuration, e.g. "cfgdeploy 
&gt; samba 192.168.0.3" will synchronise the configuration of samba with host 
&gt; 192.168.0.3 - it may even have an option to restart/start/stop the service on 
&gt; that host in the one command).

rsync? nfs? diskless workstations sharing config and binarys?

I do see your point, and realise that you are saying it should be easier
to do these things and not that it is currently impossible, but it
certainly can be worked out how to do these things with existing tools
and how-tos, which also forces you to learn more about your system and
what your doing which can only be a good thing for linux! Still, its no
clear cut issue.
