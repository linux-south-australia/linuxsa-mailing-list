 &gt; I don't believe Toshiba, by bundling Microsoft Windows with their
 &gt; equipment, have engaged in Third Line forcing.  As I understand it,
 &gt; Toshiba don't require you to purchase or lease anything from Microsoft.
 &gt; Toshiba supply Windows to you under an agreement between them and
 &gt; Microsoft.  Without the requirement that you deal with Microsoft, there
 &gt; is no third party.

There is a third party.  The EULA that they force you to pay for
is between the customer and Microsoft, not the customer and Toshiba.

I say "force" advisedly:  Despite the wording of the EULA, there is
no useful mechanism by which one can obtain compensation for the
price you've paid for a license you don't want and don't agree with.
Microsoft can't coerce you into a contract you don't accept;  yet
the money you've paid in advance on the expectation that you will
accept the contract remains with Microsoft.

You have paid money to Microsoft (through their agent) on the expectation
that you'll accept a license agreement.  If you don't accept the license,
why don't you get your money back?

[ this is different from the case where you buy a car and it
  comes with a Philips stereo:  Philips haven't attempted to 
  deal direct with you;  The car manufacturer has presented
  you with a package, and you're not required to enter into any
  dealings with any third party ]

Note, however, that it may be possible to receive your Microsoft
software without any license at all.  There is a theory which
goes something like this:

If you notify the licensor that you don't accept the terms of the 
license that they have offered to you, and they let you use
the software anyway (i.e., they don't take the software back, they 
don't refund the price you've paid for it), then your use of the
software is, by definition, devoid of a license.  Normally you 
pay money for a license agreement;  But if you refuse the license
agreement then all you're left with is a box, a CD and a couple of
manuals.

Notification is important:  Send MS a letter or an email message
saying, "I do not accept the terms of your license agreement, and
I require the refund of the money I paid to you on the expectation
that I would accept those terms."  If they don't demand the return
of the software, and they don't provide you with your refund, then
you have a bona-fide license-free copy of the Microsoft software.
You haven't paid them money for an intellectual property license,
you've paid them money for a CD.

Why is this important?  Because the power that Microsoft holds over
the consumer is only granted by the license they make their customers
agree to.  In particular, restrictions on redistribution, copying, 
reverse engineering, etc only exist because of the contractual
relationship Microsoft holds with its licensees (users).  If I am 
able to possess the software without agreeing to those restrictions, 
then the restrictions obviously don't apply to me, right?

[ note, incidentally, that the EULA's requirement that MS or their
  agents refund the purchase price of the software is useless:  If
  you reject the EULA, then you implicitly reject the bit of the 
  EULA that says someone needs to give you a refund.  So the normal
  consumer protection laws control whether you get your money back
  for a product which isn't fit for purpose, etc -- Not the EULA. ]

If no license agreement exists, then the CD containing the software
is simply a physical object, rather than licensed intellectual property.
Like any physical object, you can dispose of it as you will -- You 
can assign it to someone else, you can make facsimilies, you can 
assert ownership over those facsimilies (which necessarily means that
they are capable of being sold).  If I buy a toaster there's nothing
to stop me from pulling it apart, finding how it works, using that
knowledge to make lots of other toasters, and selling them.  So why
shouldn't I be able to do the same thing to a Windows CD if I have
refused to accept a contract which says I can't do those things and
MS has let me keep it?

Click-thru licenses don't matter either:  You don't have to actually
install Windows in order to copy it, do you?  So if you haven't
accepted the shrink-wrap license, and you haven't clicked the "I 
agree" part of the click-thru license, what legal basis is there
for any license-based restrictions on use, distribution and 
duplication?  Or, to put it another way, what's the legal difference
between a piece of software authored by MS with no license,
and a piece of public domain software with no license?  Does Microsoft
get to have power and control over the software they've written regardless
of the license agreement?  If so, why do they bother with license
agreements in the first place?

Anyone brave enough to take a pile of bootleg XP CDs to the Brickworks
Market this weekend and make that argument in the inevitable test case?
