Shaun,

&gt; Their rhetoric and bullying should be reasonably easy to counter with
&gt; facts and logic.

Perhaps, but having been in a form of politics myself, it's not the
facts or logic that count. You need to take actions that won't make you
so distasteful to the masses that they vote you out of office and out of
power.

Let's face it: with no power you don't get ANYTHING done.

With our current populist politics lacking in policies and no conviction
the only way to counter this is to make the politicians believe they
will lose votes or popular favour by adjusting or defeating this (or any
other) bill.

The Rann government has taken some unpopular steps, for example with the
River Murray and water rationing, but (a) the River Murray is
demonstrably dying (b) everyone understands that (c) it's more sexy to
save the Murray than to save the Government [whom people don't like in
the first place] from being ripped off by companies such as Microsoft
[whose product, Windows, is what they think their computers are].
