Hey,

Note to self: Do research before spouting off opinions :) (well I would've but 
I'm over my download limit :( damn optus!)..

Anyway, my comments were based on personal experience. We have a $20,000 Sun 
Blade server. It is a dual Ultra Sparc III 750MHz configuration with 1.5GB 
RAM and 80GB Disk (I think). Anyway, for doing things like simulations in 
Matlab, my $2000 1.4GHz Athlon at home completed jobs in a LOT less time. The 
Sun box just doesn't seem that great for the amount of money poured into it 
(Matlab isn't my only reason for thinking this, it's just an example. The box 
is also terribly slow for other apps when under heavy I/O load. Also Solaris 
seems to bounce jobs around between CPU's rather than keeping particular jobs 
confined to one CPU (i.e a process continually switches between CPU0 and 
CPU1) - which I imagine isn't terribly good for keeping a good cache hit/miss 
ratio). 

Sure the x86 architecture is inferior, but AMD and Intel have such a large 
market share that they can ramp up the clock speed and produce good 
performing CPU's for really cheap. 

Once our Opteron box has a second CPU in it and some more RAM, I'm sure it'll 
be a very good performing and solid box, without costing the earth. 

I will investigate what Sun is offering once I have download access again.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sun are trying for more parallelism per chip, but im not sure if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they've managed to ramp up clock speed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ObMhzWarning: Clock speed isn't everything, you know? ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yeah, but it means _something_ :) A 1.4GHz Opteron runs rings
&gt; &gt; around a 1GHz
&gt; &gt; SPARC, I'm sure... and for a LOT less money.
&gt;
&gt; To quote Inigo Montoya: ... "I do not think it means what you think it
&gt; means."
&gt;
&gt; Some results taken from
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/cpu2000.html">http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/cpu2000.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; here are some details for a 1.2GHz UltraSPARC III Cu (marked Sun Blade 2000
&gt; (1.2GHz)) -- I chose the 1.2 GHz version because it appears to have
&gt; significant improvements over the 1.015 GHz version -- compared with the
&gt; AMD Opteron 144 1.8GHz (which appears to be the fastest Opteron):
&gt;
&gt;                            Sun    AMD   ratio(A/S)
&gt; Clock Speed            -- 1200   1800    1.5
&gt; Int (peak)             --  722   1100    1.52
&gt; FP  (peak)             -- 1118   1154    1.03
&gt; Int throughput (peak)  -- 8.38   12.8    1.53
&gt; FP throughput  (peak)  -- 13.0   13.4    1.03
&gt;
&gt; Integer operations appear to be related to clock speed (though I don't
&gt; think this is neccessarily the case). It is interesting, however, that
&gt; Sun's floating point operations are almost the same as AMD's, despite
&gt; having a 33% slower core. I wouldn't *quite* say that AMD runs rings around
&gt; Sun here -- particularly if you consider things that aren't reflected in
&gt; benchmarks like this, such as the 8M L2 cache on the Sun (1MB on the AMD),
&gt; and features of the associated computer hardware (like hot-swappable CPUs,
&gt; Lights Out Management, and so on)...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Pricing is hard to compare -- A Sun Blade 2000 Workstation with a 1.2GHz
&gt; USIII processor is presently $A20,500 ... This is a different class of
&gt; computer to even high-end PC's though... The cheapest server I found with
&gt; the USIII processor was $A17,000. Comparing this to AMD, the only Opteron I
&gt; could find was a dual processor Penguin Computing system, at about $US4000
&gt; with 2 Opteron 244s, but IDE drives. I'd guess you'd be looking at $8000 by
&gt; the time it came here...
&gt;
&gt; Of course, there is also the UltraSPARC IIIi, which is probably a closer
&gt; match for the Opteron. Repeating the above comparison, with the SunFire
&gt; V210, which has a single 1GHz processor and 1Mb cache:
&gt;
&gt;                            Sun    AMD   ratio(A/S)
&gt; Clock Speed            -- 1000   1800    1.80
&gt; Int (peak)             --  555   1100    1.98
&gt; FP  (peak)             --  841   1154    1.37
&gt; Int throughput (peak)  -- 11.7*  12.8    1.09
&gt; FP throughput  (peak)  -- 14.9*  13.4    0.89
&gt;
&gt; * -- for some reason, these results are only available for the 2CPU
&gt; configuration for the Sun, so you may want to divide by 2, which won't be
&gt; very accurate, but will be better than what I have there.
&gt;
&gt; A Sun Fire V210 with 1*1GHz USIIIi and SCSI (and 4 GBit Ethernet ports) is
&gt; $A6,150... I would think that that's quite price-competitive with a
&gt; similarly configured opteron server, and while you'd suffer on raw compute
&gt; power, you'd win with LOM, future scalability (I don't think anything in
&gt; the x86 world can beat Sun for that), and being on a proven 64 bit
&gt; platform.
&gt;
&gt; I'd conclude from that (which wasn't comparing what you were comparing, but
&gt; hey...) that AMD does seem to have a faster processor than Sun, particlarly
&gt; for integer operations, and it does appear to be more cost-effective, but
&gt; not enough to "run rings around" Sun. It's also interesting that Sun do
&gt; appear to be getting more cost-effective at the low end (or at least, at
&gt; their low end)...
&gt;
&gt; Out of interest, here's the relevant results for the AMD 140, which is
&gt; 1.4GHz...
&gt;
&gt;                            AMD
&gt; Clock Speed            -- 1400
&gt; Int (peak)             --  933
&gt; FP  (peak)             -- 1012
&gt; Int throughput (peak)  -- 10.8
&gt; FP throughput  (peak)  -- 11.7
&gt;
&gt; The Sun USIII in the Blade 2000 whips it in floating point...
&gt;
&gt; Hmm... interesting...
