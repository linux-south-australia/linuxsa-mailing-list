&gt; Yes.  I do have files starting with '-' under /home/andrew.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx 4 the tip.  I tried what you suggested and it worked a 
&gt; treat.  I don't 
&gt; understand why files starting with '-' would trip grep up 
&gt; though.  I'm 

It's because the - is interpreted by grep as an option, not a filename. You
had a file beginning with -d, right?

from grep(1):

       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
              If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to pro-
              cess  it.   By default, ACTION is read, which means
              that directories are read  just  as  if  they  were
              ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, directories are
              silently skipped.  If ACTION is recurse, grep reads
              all  files  under each directory, recursively; this
              is equivalent to the -r option.


Your file wasn't a valid action name, so it caused an error. I would think
it could be even more confusing if you happenned to have a file called
-dskip, or -dread, or even just -d ...

Remember that your command "grep -o -R -e 'search phrase' *" is passed to
grep with the * expanded by the shell... the grep program gets the arguments
as an array of string pointers, and processes them one by one. So if you had
the files "-dtest" and "file", grep would get the commandline just as if you
had written "grep -o -R -e 'search phrase' -dtest file" ... ie it has the
following arguments:

"-o"
"-R"
"-e"
"search phrase"
"-dtest"
"file"

It goes through them all, looking for arguments starting with '-', and
processes these as options. The remaining arguments are filenames. The "--"
option, when processed by grep tells grep that all following arguments are
not to be processed as options, but as files. It's a common option in many
programs... So, the new commandline, "grep -o -R -e 'search phrase' -- *",
gives grep the following arguments:

"-o"
"-R"
"-e"
"search phrase"
"--"
"-dtest"
"file"

Grep processes the first four as you'd expect, gets to "--", and then
interprets "-dtest" and "file" as filenames. the purpose of this is for
precisely this situation -- when you have a file that looks like an option.
Try to delete a file called "-rf" ...  :)


&gt; guessing it might be used at the start of files/directories 
&gt; in special 
&gt; circumstances ?  I'm wondering this because I've been able to 
&gt; create files & 
&gt; directories beginning with '-' via my GUI (KDE) but am unable 
&gt; to create them 
&gt; at the command line, either in the manner 'mkdir '-dirname' 
&gt; or by renaming 
&gt; existing directories in the manner 'mv dirname '-dirname'  '. 
&gt;  Either that, 
&gt; or it's a glitch in KDE (or bash) that allows (or doesn't 
&gt; allow) this ?

Again, use the "--" option, and you will be able to create them. The quotes
only change how the shell passes the argument to the program (specifically
in terms of spaces and other field separators, and variable and wildcard
expansion), not how the program interprets them. KDE probably shouldn't let
you create filenames starting with - (or $, ;, and a bunch of other problem
symbols), but I guess it doesn't actually affect KDE, only command-line
utitilies (or programs run from shell scripts).

The best thing to do is to refrain from creating files that start with - ...
