I was lucky that it was a Connextant chipset. I downloaded an rpm for Mandrake 
9.1 from the vendors website (well an affiliate vendor that makes the Linux 
drivers), and all I had to do was "rpm -ivh blah-blah.rpm", and the scripts 
in the rpm package set everything up and loaded the driver (including 
creating a symbolic link for /dev/modem). Couldn't have been easier.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; Hey Damien
&gt; Oh well, there ya go. Sounds like I should have checked more carefully!!
&gt; I had the download edition from a Linux Format mag out this month, which
&gt; only includes 2 cds. So, I wasn't lucky enough to have the International
&gt; CD 3 and hence my mandrake package manager didn't report the package.
&gt; So, I must rephrase to post to say that the Download Edition that will
&gt; come with most mags will not include the kppp package as it is on the
&gt; 3rd disk ;-)
&gt;
&gt; I am interested to note that ya got a winmodem working without any
&gt; hasseles tho, that is very impressive. Did you have to use/configure
&gt; special drivers from the net, or were the packages included with
&gt; Mandrake???

&gt; &gt;Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I installed Mandrake 9.1 on a friends machine and got kppp installed and
&gt; &gt;working with no problems (from the mandrake cd's). I even got his winmodem
&gt; &gt;working with no dramas.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Let's see what the mandrake package manager says about this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;"Name: kdenetwork-kppp
&gt; &gt;Version: 3.1-31mdk
&gt; &gt;Size: 1558 KB
&gt; &gt;Source: International CD (x86) (cdrom3)
&gt; &gt;Currently installed version: (none)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Summary: Dialer and front end for pppd"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Well it looks included to me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Cheers,
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hey everyone
&gt; &gt;&gt;Just wanted to share this with everyone who uses Mandrake Linux and who
&gt; &gt;&gt;are gunna update to 9.1. I have just upgraded my Linux box from Mandrake
&gt; &gt;&gt;9.0 to 9.1. However, still using dial-up 56k modem (god do I need
&gt; &gt;&gt;broadband), once I had installed the update, I could not find kppp to
&gt; &gt;&gt;dial-up!! Now, after some googling on the net (courtesy of my wifes
&gt; &gt;&gt;windoze partition!!), I quickly discovered that support for kppp has
&gt; &gt;&gt;since been removed from Mandrake. I am not sure about anyone else here,
&gt; &gt;&gt;but in my view gnome-ppp completely sucks and often crashes. So if
&gt; &gt;&gt;anyone is in the same boat as me, you are gunna have to download the
&gt; &gt;&gt;kppp package and manually install it. I have attached a link for all
&gt; &gt;&gt;those who might wanna use it.
