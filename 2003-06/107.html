Hi,

Very exciting news for me personally and perhaps the community as well. 
  :-)

I just got a call from the network administrator, that for now, I will 
keep anonymous. (Don't want any kind of retaliation on them)

He said that his county uses Novell servers ranging from 3x to 5x, and 
all that he needed was a way for his users to select from Multiple printers.

The entire county.

Anyway, I gabe him the line command for that:

*******************************************************************************

nprint -S server -U username -q  queuename  filename.

If my server were named BAM, and I were James and the Que was named 
hpprinter, and the file name was mozilla.ps, then the command would be:

nprint -S BAM -U james -q hpprinter mozilla.ps

*******************************************************************************

Its easy in SuSE Linux to add a novell printer, it doesn't autodetect 
Netware 4, but it works. However, the management situation calls for 
Lindows there.

So, I am going to install and play with Lindows to see if I can add 
print setup automation.  Howver, in a massive deployment, it may be 
easier for him to simply copy config files to each desk.

So far /ect/printcap, /ect/cups/printers.conf seem to be part of the 
picture. Hopefully me recent experience with the Konica print driver 
will help me figure this out.

So, after I go for a short walk outside  :-),  I am going to put my head 
down and work on some accounting today. But it is very satisfying to 
work in a humble environment of a small business and see that positive 
things can come from the little that I do.

James Leone

P.S. If someone could let me know how IPX works in FreeBSD I would like 
to know, as some people might ask.
