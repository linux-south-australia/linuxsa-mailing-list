Fate of South Australian Open Source bill likely to be known by July end 
By Sam Varghese 
June 18 2003 


The South Australian Democrat, who introduced a bill to amend state software
procurement policies, says he expects to know the fate of the bill by the
end of July this year. 

Ian Gilfillan, a member of the legislative council, said the bill had just
gone through its second reading. The procedures remaining were for it to go
through committee where it could be amended if needed and then it would be
formally submitted to parliament. After that there was a third reading, a
debate if needed and then the process of formal passage. 

The substance of the State Supply (Procurement of Software) Amendment Bill
2003 (to give it its official name) is: "A public authority must, in making
a decision about the procurement of computer software for its operations,
have regard to the principle that, wherever practicable, a public authority
should use open source software in preference to proprietary software." 

Gilfillan said he took up the issue because he did not like big corporations
creating lock-in in such a vital area. 

"I looked at the alternatives - admittedly, it took some learning on my part
- and I realised that it's not as though there's just one option," he said.
"Open source offers something which is recognised and while there may be no
big flashing ads or hype, it needs to be seriously considered." 


"Any time there is a fresh software contract entered into or an old one
renwed, we want the South Australian government to look at open source
solutions in addition to the usual proprietary ones," Gilfillan said. 

He said the opposition had expressed interest in the bill and he was
negotiating with the Shadow Minister for Innovation and Information
Technology, Martin Hamilton-Smith, for their support in passing the bill in
the Upper House. Key independents in the lower house had also expressed
interest in Open Source software, so there was a reasonable chance that it
would go forward. 

"The whole Open Source Movement sits well with Democrat principles. It is
inherently participatory, and provides for the common good, allowing each
participant to leverage from the efforts of those who have gone before,"
Gilfillan said.
