&gt; I was wondering what people do for mail     backups and failover 

You could set up a cron job that is hooked to a shell script. The shell 
script would copy the contents of /var/spool/mail into a directory that 
is uniqly date marked. How often you do this is up to you.

I didn't think of that until just now.   However, I have take an 
unsophisticated approach.  I use fetchmail on each desk , with the keep 
option.  That keeps the messages stored on the mail server. I have 
another server get the mail from the ISP's using the keep option as 
well.  I have to periodically clean house and get the messages off of 
the server once in a while, and when I do that, I either have to clean 
house from each desk. I do it in an automayted way, I take would take 
the risk that an email will not reach its recipient at their desk.

&gt; I now have about 40 mail accounts (postfix) on one of my boxes
&gt; with imap/pop access.
&gt;
&gt; I'm worried about what happens if it breaks.
&gt;
&gt; How do i recover the user accounts and currently spooled mail?
&gt;
&gt; What do people do about this? Does anyone have failover mail servers
&gt; set up? (not secondary's). ?
&gt;
&gt; (There are also web sites on the box, but these are easy to back up
&gt; and create failover for).
&gt;
&gt; just wondering
&gt;
&gt; cheers
