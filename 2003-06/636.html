Here's a very useful link:

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/31207.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/31207.html</A>

This summarises recent press clippings about adoption of open source
(especially linux) by government bodies all over Europe.
Something like that, quoted in a letter, should be convincing.
Governments, like middle management, never think about the general good
but rather about who is going to get blamed if something goes wrong.
So they need to know that there are other governments out there doing the
same as them so that if anything goes wrong, they can say: "Yes, but
we were doing the same as everybody else." Protecting their own backs
in case of failure is the prime motivating force of governments and
middle management, not the greatest good of the greatest number.
Therefore the line of argument should be: "Adopt OSS because that's what
the important and most admired government bodies are doing. Therefore
people will admire your choice as being very sensible and you will get
good press out of it."

This is true in fact. There will be good press from SA govt adoption of OSS.
Showing the politicians press clippings to indicate how much good press 
they're going to get from showing a bit of spine for a change will
have more effect than talking about jobs, which politicians know is 
pure bunkum anyway. Politicians rightly regard job creation as being
as controllable as Canute's tides.

Remember also that Labor needs to distinguish itself from the other party
in the public's eyes. Therefore changing from the old commercial software
to something new and exciting will help the voters think that there is
some difference. 

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
