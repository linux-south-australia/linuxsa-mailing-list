&gt; A teacher here at school asked me about the development of computers of
&gt; the last 20-30 years or so, as they want to explain the exponential
&gt; growth rate of computers to their students.
&gt; 
&gt; They would like to make a statement like;
&gt; 
&gt; "It took us x years to develop the 1.0GHz chip and x months to go from
&gt; 1.0GHz to 2.0GHz....."
&gt; 
&gt; I know it took years to get to 1.0GHz and almost no time to go to
&gt; 2.0GHz but I'm after some info to fill in the blanks a little more
&gt; accuratly.

Toms Hardware had an article recently with a timeline of
IA-32 (the latest of these being the Pentium M) chips.

It probably would be too hard to fill in the Intel/Zilog/NEC
chips before the the 386 (google for 4004 8008 8080 Z80
8086 V20 V30 80186 80286).

Clock rate isn't everything.  There's a good example
around now.  The 1.7GHz Pentium M has only a slightly
lower throughput than the 3GHz Pentium 4.  The lower
clock rate makes the laptop baterry last a lot longer.

There are other measures of CPU grunt, such as floating
point operations per second or million of VAX instructions
per second.  These have problems across so many generations
of chip.

The other areas where things have moved along a lot is
hard disk storage capacity and speeds (rotational RPM)
and the sheer space occupied by the computer (compare
a 4Mhz Z80 with 64KB of memory, a 5MB hard drive, twin
8in floppies and a S100 bus with a modern laptop).

One ammusement is to work out what year's supercomputer
your desktop PC is equivalent to.  See www.top500.org
for an archive of supercomputer performance data.

For example, the Cray-1 did 133 Mflops.  A 2.5GHz Pentium 4
does about 1250 Mflops, close enough to being ten Cray-1s.
Cray-1s sold for US$5m to US$8.8m in 1970 dollars.  A
Pentium 4 PC will set you back about A$2,000 in 2003 dollars.
