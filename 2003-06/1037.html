&gt; &gt; &gt; Sun are trying for more parallelism per chip, but im not sure if 
&gt; &gt; &gt; they've managed to ramp up clock speed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ObMhzWarning: Clock speed isn't everything, you know? ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, but it means _something_ :) A 1.4GHz Opteron runs rings 
&gt; around a 1GHz 
&gt; SPARC, I'm sure... and for a LOT less money.

To quote Inigo Montoya: ... "I do not think it means what you think it
means."

Some results taken from 

<A HREF="http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/cpu2000.html">http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/results/cpu2000.html</A>

here are some details for a 1.2GHz UltraSPARC III Cu (marked Sun Blade 2000
(1.2GHz)) -- I chose the 1.2 GHz version because it appears to have
significant improvements over the 1.015 GHz version -- compared with the AMD
Opteron 144 1.8GHz (which appears to be the fastest Opteron):

                           Sun    AMD   ratio(A/S)
Clock Speed            -- 1200   1800    1.5
Int (peak)             --  722   1100    1.52
FP  (peak)             -- 1118   1154    1.03
Int throughput (peak)  -- 8.38   12.8    1.53
FP throughput  (peak)  -- 13.0   13.4    1.03

Integer operations appear to be related to clock speed (though I don't think
this is neccessarily the case). It is interesting, however, that Sun's
floating point operations are almost the same as AMD's, despite having a 33%
slower core. I wouldn't *quite* say that AMD runs rings around Sun here --
particularly if you consider things that aren't reflected in benchmarks like
this, such as the 8M L2 cache on the Sun (1MB on the AMD), and features of
the associated computer hardware (like hot-swappable CPUs, Lights Out
Management, and so on)...


Pricing is hard to compare -- A Sun Blade 2000 Workstation with a 1.2GHz
USIII processor is presently $A20,500 ... This is a different class of
computer to even high-end PC's though... The cheapest server I found with
the USIII processor was $A17,000. Comparing this to AMD, the only Opteron I
could find was a dual processor Penguin Computing system, at about $US4000
with 2 Opteron 244s, but IDE drives. I'd guess you'd be looking at $8000 by
the time it came here...

Of course, there is also the UltraSPARC IIIi, which is probably a closer
match for the Opteron. Repeating the above comparison, with the SunFire
V210, which has a single 1GHz processor and 1Mb cache:

                           Sun    AMD   ratio(A/S)
Clock Speed            -- 1000   1800    1.80
Int (peak)             --  555   1100    1.98
FP  (peak)             --  841   1154    1.37
Int throughput (peak)  -- 11.7*  12.8    1.09
FP throughput  (peak)  -- 14.9*  13.4    0.89

* -- for some reason, these results are only available for the 2CPU
configuration for the Sun, so you may want to divide by 2, which won't be
very accurate, but will be better than what I have there.

A Sun Fire V210 with 1*1GHz USIIIi and SCSI (and 4 GBit Ethernet ports) is
$A6,150... I would think that that's quite price-competitive with a
similarly configured opteron server, and while you'd suffer on raw compute
power, you'd win with LOM, future scalability (I don't think anything in the
x86 world can beat Sun for that), and being on a proven 64 bit platform.

I'd conclude from that (which wasn't comparing what you were comparing, but
hey...) that AMD does seem to have a faster processor than Sun, particlarly
for integer operations, and it does appear to be more cost-effective, but
not enough to "run rings around" Sun. It's also interesting that Sun do
appear to be getting more cost-effective at the low end (or at least, at
their low end)...

Out of interest, here's the relevant results for the AMD 140, which is
1.4GHz...

                           AMD
Clock Speed            -- 1400
Int (peak)             --  933
FP  (peak)             -- 1012
Int throughput (peak)  -- 10.8
FP throughput  (peak)  -- 11.7

The Sun USIII in the Blade 2000 whips it in floating point...

Hmm... interesting...
