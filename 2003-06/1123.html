&gt;This is a major problem, yes. You could also declare the original

This has to be done.  The distributions must want to do it to comply 
with the ease of use guidelines laid out. This will result from being 
pressure from end users. The rules and the body must be beholden to end 
users. Therefore it should be a not for profit organization that is 
publicly funded.

&gt;and actually make
&gt;people use the UCF (Universal/Uern Configuration Format) file when editing
&gt;files -- if you want to change all the config file formats anyway, and
&gt;didn't want to force application writers to rewrite their applications, then
&gt;this could be a viable method...
&gt;  
&gt;
I am not a programmer, but I think there will be a lot of program 
rewrites to achive the goal.

&gt;Why would you want private variables in a config file in the first place? I
&gt;can't think of any instance where a current config file has real
&gt;non-user-modifiable information...
&gt;  
&gt;
Then I would have...

                         /config/user/joe
                         /config/user/jack
                        /config/user/name-of-user
                         /config/admiin

instead of...

                         /config

With /config/user/username being writeable by $username

You want this because you want users and administrators to know that 
configuration files are ALWAYS in the same place.

&gt;
&gt;Have you seen debconf? 
&gt;
I want uniformity....

&gt;Whatever format you want to use (I'll choose XML here), 
&gt;
My uneducated comment is this: when I think of XML I think of Open 
Office, and when I think of Open Office, I think slow...


&gt;the idea would be
&gt;that the config files would override the defaults. IE if you copied the
&gt;default file verbatim, you would get a perfectly valid config file, with
&gt;default settings. Likewise, if you removed the config file entirely, or had
&gt;an empty one, the system would just use the defaults.
&gt;
Two comments:

The first is...if its "Unix" I would think the program should not 
function without a configuration file, because the program should lack 
configuration information alltogether.

But I like the idea.

What annoys me about all of the security crap going around is that it 
renders the default setups unusable. Like that cups web browser thing. 
Making the user log in as root wasn't good enough, they had to make the 
web browser only accessible by the local user - which makes their work 
rather pointless - most distributions supply a print set up wizzard, so 
the only use for the cups web page is to use it remotely.

And that being so fundamental, the instructions for correcting the 
problem should be clear and easy to find and in BOLD TYPE.
