<PRE>
&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; I've been thinking about the various deficiencies in most GNU/Linux 
&gt; distributions and I would like to detail some of my ideas for 
&gt; improvement 
&gt; here for feedback. These are just notes and are by no means 
&gt; comprehensive, I 
&gt; plan on writing more detailed papers on some possible 
&gt; designs/code etc..

Interesting ideas...

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway here they are:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Standardised /etc filesystem
&gt; 
&gt; - sane filetree:

If your main goal with this point is to make finding files easier, you could
do that yourself quite easily, whilst still maintaining compatibility with
present Unices -- simply make your tree a set of symlinks to the right
files...

eg:

/etc/system/services/samba/smb.conf -&gt; /etc/samba/smb.conf

and so on...

However, there will always be some that defy categorisation ... should XDMCP
go under services or x11? both? Also, many would claim that the present
system isn't particularly complex, and your idea would be adding
unneccessary layers of indirection, making it less convenient...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; -Standardised configuration file syntax with the following 
&gt; design goals:

I see only one way that this is possible, and that is to design your new
config files with some sort of program that generates the old format from
them. ie your XML sendmail config file gets parsed, and a normal sendmail.cf
gets generated (perhaps via a sendmail.mc). You (or anyone) will never
manage to change the formats that each program uses. It's too complex, there
are too many political issues, and not enough advantage.

&gt; 
&gt; - Easily human readable and modifyable (so people can edit 
&gt; with vi if need be)
&gt; - Syntax doubles as simple GUI layout guide
&gt;     - entire /etc directory tree should be parseable by a GUI program
&gt;       so that *all* configuration options for the *entire system* can
&gt;       be modified/viewed via a GUI

Danger! if people edit with a text editor, then this GUI layout may end up
getting awfully botched.

&gt;     - A GUI program need not know about say "sendmail" 
&gt; specifically in  order 
&gt; to provide a GUI to the user.

I see where you're going with this, but what about when there is a feature
that exists, but isn't mentioned in the config file? How do you turn it on
in the GUI?

&gt; - A library (libetc) provided that can parse the /etc 
&gt; directory tree and the 
&gt; files within it. This library should be cross platform (e.g. so BSD
&gt;   can adopt if it wishes - this includes the structure of the 
&gt; /etc tree)

BSD (or at least FreeBSD) is quite different -- it has /etc and
/usr/local/etc for different types of program (base OS stuff and ports) ...
It also has a completely different init script system... I doubt making it
cross platform will be easy (and I doubt the BSD folk would be interested --
they tend to err on conservatism)

&gt; 
&gt; ** See Appendix for a glimpse at the various mish-mash of 
&gt; configuration styles 
&gt; and  file locations currently found under /etc
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Unified reference distribution that augments the LSB.

This may not be in the best commercial interests of companies like RedHat,
where differentiation is essential... However, that said, I don't really see
where this usefully differs from the goals of the LSB: "The goal of the LSB
is to develop and promote a set of standards that will increase
compatability among Linux distributions and enable software applications to
run on any compliant system..."

&gt; 
&gt; - Not a distribution in the common sense, but a specification for a 
&gt; distribution.

I thought this was basically what the LSB is intended to be...

Also, check out <A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/impl/">http://www.linuxbase.org/impl/</A> -- it's the "reference
implementation", containing everything that is minimal for a LSB-compliant
Linux...

&gt; - The specification complies with the LSB, but fills in the blanks.
&gt;      - This may include: library versions, compiler version, 
&gt; compile flags    
&gt;        used, etc

Why? Shouldn't this be something for distributors to differentiate their
distributions with?

&gt; - A repository of packages packaged in a distribution 
&gt; independent format (e.g. 
&gt; something  like "autopackage"). These packages should be able 
&gt; to be installed 
&gt; painlessly on  "Official Reference Distribution" compliant system.

I'm pretty sure LSB is aiming at something like this sort of
compatibiltiy...

Hmmmm: <A HREF="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/packaging/lcd/faq/index.html">http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/packaging/lcd/faq/index.html</A>

Seems they've decided on a version of RPM, but intend to make it
distro-independant...

&gt; - "Official Reference Distribution" compliance tested with 
&gt; software. Software 
&gt; for this testing  is free and licensed under the GNU GPL.

See the reference implementation above...

&gt; - Distribution companies can display a logo saying they are 
&gt; compatibile with 
&gt; the reference distro  simply by passing the software tests. 
&gt; No fees are 
&gt; charged (it is community supported after all).

I think LSB intends to do this...

&gt; - Documentation repository.
&gt;   - This includes:
&gt;       - HOWTO's for best programming practices for developing 
&gt; and deploying 
&gt;         software on a GNU/Linux system  (e.g. where to store data,
&gt;         configuration data, command line options syntax, user 
&gt; interface guide,
&gt;         when to use libraries, packaging, binary 
&gt; compatibility issues, etc).
&gt;       - any other relevant documentation.

I thought we had that, in a somewhat less formal form -- www.tldp.org

&gt; 
&gt; The goal of this is to provide a consistent and unified 
&gt; standard for deploying 
&gt; software on GNU/Linux system without worrying about binary 
&gt; incompatibility 
&gt; issues and/or inconsistencies in the filesystem layout. It 

OK, that is covered by the LSB, I'm quite confident.

&gt; also provides 
&gt; guides to programmers so that hopefully all programs on a 
&gt; GNU/Linux system 
&gt; behave in a predictable and consistent manner. Programmers 
&gt; who's programs 
&gt; pass the various guideline tests can display an icon on the 
&gt; webpage for their 

This is a little different, and I'd be confident that it is pretty much
impossible to do. I assume you're talking about something like Apple's Human
Interface Guidelines
(<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AquaHIGu">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AquaHIGu</A>
idelines/index.html)? Religious issues will stop this from ever occurring.
Open Source type people appreciate choice, and will dislike having the
choices made for them. This isn't to say it wouldn't be a good idea, just
that it's impossible :)

It's also difficult (and therefore expensive) to test for this kind of
thing...

That said, I'm pretty sure both KDE and GNOME have their own guidelines...

&gt; project. All applications packaged for the "Official 
&gt; Reference Distribution" 
&gt; comply with all defined standards.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Protocol for the underlying system to communicate with the GUI

I'm not sure I understand this. Isn't this what X is supposed to be? Hmm...
Ah, it seems you're looking for a way to send messages to the user, as
opposed to programatically communicating with the GUI... right?

&gt; 
&gt; - A device in the /dev filesystem should be available to 
&gt; facilitate such 
&gt; communication. I nominate "/dev/pts/gui".
&gt; - A process can gain exclusive read access to this file. Text 
&gt; piped into this 
&gt; file is of a certain syntax so that it can be parsed and the desktop 
&gt; environment can provide the user with a suitable notice (such 
&gt; as a flashing   
&gt; icon in the system tray, or messagebox).

What if there's more than one GUI? Consider boxes that have Xterminals
running off them...

&gt; - /dev/pts/gui should be owned by the controlling process 
&gt; (have same uid/gid 
&gt; as the controlling process). If controlling process lacks sufficient 
&gt; permissions to be notified of a message, the write to 
&gt; /dev/pts/gui is denied.

The "controlling process" is the GUI itself (or some program within it),
right? So if I log in to GNOME, I'd expect there would be some applet that
would be reading from this device...

&gt; - If there is no controlling process to /dev/pts/gui, the 
&gt; kernel buffers 
&gt; messages until there is a controlling process  and then 
&gt; passes the messages 
&gt; to it.
&gt; 
&gt; The purpose of this is to provide the user with notification 
&gt; of certain things 
&gt; the underlying system is doing that they may need to know about. Such 
&gt; notifications include hardware detection changes at bootup, 
&gt; hotplug changes, 
&gt; system shutdown, etc...
&gt; 

I would consider that half the time, users shouldn't want to know -- only
the sysadmin wants to know. Email is a good form of communicating this...

&gt; 
&gt; APPENDIX:
&gt; 
&gt; The following are small snippets from various configuration 
&gt; files in my /etc 
&gt; directory (it details the various syntaxes currently in use):

It certainly would appear that all these files could be sensibly expressed
in a common format (say XML), and converted to the present formats by some
process (say a make command -- but then, shouldn't Makefiles also be in
XML... perhaps ant would be better)...

However, you would lose quite a lot in doing so. Things like xf86config,
apache modules that configure themselves, existing configs, SWAT, and so on.
That said, I still think there's something in this, though I don't think
it's practical...

I would think that if you wanted to do this, you'd be best off taking a look
at FreeBSD's config system. They use /etc/rc.conf and /etc/defaults/rc.conf
for all the basic config. They are sourced by the rc script prior to
execution, and set up a whole lot of variables, controlling whether certain
daemons start, and what options to give them. 

/etc/defaults/rc.conf has all the default settings, and many comments
explaining the meaning of everything. It is not intended to be edited.

/etc/rc.conf has all the user-controlled settings.

Whatever tool you had would need to parse the default file, get comments and
defaults, parse the user-controlled file, get the current settings, and
write to the user-controlled file. It would then need to generate the real
config file from the defaults and user settings. This reminds me of
something else...

Anyone remember Linuxconf? It was supposed to do this, wasn't it? The most
frustrating thing that I recall about that (apart from the bugs) was the way
it would rewrite your config files every time you booted or changed
anything. You were restricted to making only the configuration changes that
it knew how to make, and you were restricted to making them through it, and
not editing the config files you know and love. As far as I can tell, it
seems to have vanished, and I have not missed it.

Now that I've got my mental momentum, this also makes me think of webmin
(and cobalt and Qbalt, for that matter)... I wonder how closely they
approach this ideal of having a generic tool?

Intriguing...
