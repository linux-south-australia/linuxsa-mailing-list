What are you talking about, David?  If you installed a third party
package, it's in /usr/local/etc.  If it came from freebsd.org, it's
in /etc.

That's pretty basic, isn't it?

I think your confusion stems from long-term exposure to Linux
distributions, which have done a disservice to their users by
consistently muddying the waters about the distinction between 
the base operating system and the add-on packages.  How many people
who were introduced to UNIX via RedHat have any idea that Gnome 
and X-Windows aren't part of the OS, and that there's a genuine
difference between them and, say, inetd? 

That problem is pretty much unique to Linux in the UNIX world.
Other OSs draw very clear distinctions between what's "operating
system" and what's "application".
