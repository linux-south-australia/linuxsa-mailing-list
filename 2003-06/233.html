I was in the exact same boat as you not long ago. My mandrake 9.0 system was 
set up beautifully, I didn't want to change a thing. However, I wanted to try 
out the new KDE 3.1 and see what it was like and also see what new features 
mandrake had included, so I decided to give it a whirl.

I chose the Upgrade option rather than a fresh install, and it was probably 
the most brain dead easy thing I've ever done. It asked if I wanted to 
upgrade or install over the top of mdk9, I said upgrade, then it just chewed 
away on installing packages for about 1 hr (had one error with timidity 
package conflict), then I rebooted... it kept my mandrake 9.0 kernel as 
default so my nvidia drivers and what not still worked fine, i booted into 
KDE, it kept my theme, my settings, all my icons, the only difference was new 
software!! yay... I then proceeded with my usual tweaks (e.g. freetype 
package from plf) and everything was sweet... I configured it so the mandrake 
9.1  kernel was default and I reinstalled the nvidia drivers (there was no 
difference, but I thought I might as well run the latest).

I have to say, I am very very happy indeed with my current system setup, I 
like the new KDE 3.1 (not much different though), it has drop menu shadows 
(looks sweet!), and fading panel applet handles.. konqueror launches a bit 
faster.. the mandrake control centre is a bit better... but other than that, 
not a lot of difference.

I am very excited about what the next Mandrake will probably look like, kernel 
2.6.x, KDE 3.2 (with proper randr support), mmmm the future is grand!

Cheers,

Damien

P.S: install kmplayer, it's a very good front end to mplayer, also install the 
win32-codecs package from plf. With kmplayer installed you can play movies 
within konqueror! (it embeds into the konqueror frame), pointless but cool :)

&gt;     Hello ,
&gt;            can anybody tell me the advantages / disadvantages upgrading
&gt; from mandrake 9.0 to 9.1 . Is it worth the change I have at present a
&gt; system with Mandrake 9.0 that is working well I have no issues with it to
&gt; speak of .
&gt;
&gt; Also out of interest what does "noarch" mean ?
&gt;
&gt; Since i have installed 9.0 I have installed Xine patches , MPlayer and ogle
&gt; for playing dvds , mpeg2 etc I had a few problems initially with Xine ,
&gt; ogle and Mplayer the following were my solutions for anybody that may have
&gt; the same issues as I had
&gt;
&gt; Xine would not play I only had a Blue screen instead of video display ogle
&gt; had the same problem . To solve this I installed the Nvidia drivers and set
&gt; up as per the docs I now have full twinview setup and this also fixed my
&gt; overlay problem in both Xine and ogle . I have a asus gf4mx 440 vid card .
&gt;
&gt; The solution with MPlayer was there was a file missing from the rpms that I
&gt; downloaded from the mplayer rpm site this I had to install the older
&gt; mandrake 8.0 mplayer-common rpm save the font file that was missing
&gt; uninstall the older rpm then install the updated rpms for mplayer and
&gt; install the missing font file . There is a mplayer font rpm that is
&gt; installed but this does not include the missing font.
&gt;
&gt; With the nvidia driver installed i can get 200 fps in Q3 it is worth the
&gt; trouble installing this driver it also gives twinview capability. A great
&gt; program for setting up nvidia driver settings is Yanc
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
