&gt; &gt; The very vast majority of unix programs have zero configuration:

&gt; &gt; in this instance we're taking about the ugly, awkward, point-n-click
type
&gt; &gt; of programs, the dvd players and so on.  These are exactly the programs
&gt; &gt; that have the poorest documentation and which are hard to use because
&gt; &gt; of that lack.

I agree with David, and for some extra different reasons.

Man is fine for commandline apps. It will suffice for some gui apps, but
sometimes, because of the nature of the process being run, and the
nature of *nix, help for the app doesn't always encompass help for the
problem at hand. It's very hard to resolve this issue. Look what MS did
with the troubleshooters - I have never had a happy ending with one of
those, but they were an attempt to cover what else might be wrong.

The problem with the 'ugly, awkward, point-n-click type of programs'
(David, are you trolling? :) is that they shouldn't be. Ultimately, if
the gui is implemented well, the need for help is reduced in the first
place because some things will be bleeding obvious, and not hidden in
some secret pane of the gui. This is a design issue that raises the
focus on the standard of the help because it is required to solve issues
that really should be written all over the face of the gui. In that
case, the help can be more focussed on the operation of the software and
troubleshooting than nitty gritty detail of the gui operation.

That said, I am under the impression that the interfaces were generally
improving, not deteriorating...
