&gt; I'm disappointed that the best that's been put forward to my "challenge"
&gt; are academic offerings dating back well into the last century.  I'm not
&gt; awfully surprised; the open source community seems to be hell-bent on
&gt; immitation, and I might say also on beating Microsoft.

Let me come back to this argument.
 
&gt; What's the point in open source if the best we can do is destroy products,
&gt; such as Photo Shop and Quicken, which are the results of large expenditure
&gt; in time and money?  Immitation is easy, but not a noble cause.

I have heard people winging that the compiler business would be a great 
business if it weren't for those bastards in the open source software 
community who make it impossible to compete.

I have also heard of a company that refers to Ethereal developers as a 
horde of mongrel programmers who can't get a real job so they develop free 
software to take away jobs from real programmers.

Both of these sentiments miss the point.

Neither the compiler companies of the '70s and '80s and into the '90s nor 
the companies that made packet sniffers and still do were delivering what 
customers really want. These companies wanted to keep charging good money 
for products that only were pretty static. In the compiler front, what 
users wanted was compilers that ran on multiple architectures and could 
compile the same source code. However, the compiler companies wanted to 
focus on one or maybe two core OSes.

Now, that is not to say the GCC is always the best choice in compilers. 
Intel does good business, I understand in offering a compiler that does 
real good optimization of Intel processors. It also does good optimization 
for AMB processors I hear as well. Some companies and projects want that, 
but not all.

Here, GCC is delivering what customers want, and, if we find a problem 
with GCC (which isn't often), if we have the talent, we can fix the 
problem. That is real value.

Similarly, with packet sniffers. The sniffer companies simply wanted/want 
to rest on their laurels and charge lots of money. Along came Ethereal. 
Many of us got involved in Ethereal not because we wanted to destroy the 
companies that make packet sniffers, but for the sheer joy of being able 
to do something interesting and being able to use the same tool on many 
different architectures (from AIX to Tru64 UNIX to FreeBSD to Linux to 
Windows, to QNX and so on). None of the commercial vendors were prepared 
to scratch that itch. Then we started adding features that none of the 
commercial vendors provided.

However, there are things that commercial packages do that Ethereal does 
not do. Some of those are special features, like handling T1/E1 or OC3 or 
whatever links, grabbing packets on sync links instead of Ethernet, or 
grabbing captures at wire speed on GigE or 10GigE (however, these devices 
tend to result in compromises where they will only capture a limited 
number of packets at wire-speed before they have to stop and dump to disk, 
while many of us are interested in being able to capture gigabytes of data 
at line speed and so on).

So, I have no sympathy for companies that do not want to satisfy what the 
market wants and then complain when they find that their market has been 
taken away by open source software competitors or by other more nimble 
commercial ventures.

Now, back to the issue of the open source community wanting to beat 
Microsoft.

I really cannot understand why David is concerned here. Microsoft has 
billions of dollars in cash and spends a lot of money of lobbying in many 
countries. Surely, MS can look after itself, and if it can't, perhaps it 
does not deserve to survive.

Lastly, I wanted to come back to innovation. This is a term that is 
bandied about a lot by the large, established player, but, it seems to me 
that the large established players are the last entities that will 
innovate.

Large, established players are too concerned with maintaining their 
position in the market place, too concerned with maintaining revenue 
streams to innovate. They want evolutionary change in their products so 
they can hold onto their customer base and prevent anyone else from 
grabbing it.

We have seen lots of this in the computing industry before. Digital 
Equipment did lots of interesting things in the late '70s and '80s but 
then they got large and moribund and wanted to keep selling the same stuff 
to their customers. Then along came Sun who had a much better story to 
sell and they were cheaper. Of course, Digital made other mistakes as 
well, and in the end they were absorbed by Compaq, who also failed to keep 
delivering what customers wanted, so they got married to HP.

Now we are seeing Sun struggle because they have forgotten how to deliver 
what their customers really want, and they might go the same way as 
Digital and DG and Tandem and Compaq and so on.

Microsoft has tried to insulate themselves from this problem by becoming a 
monopoly in a number of areas, but I suspect that they too will face 
exactly the same pressure. Only time will tell if they can manage to 
survive.
