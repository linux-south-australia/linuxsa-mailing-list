Peter,

&gt; I can download Linux drivers from linuxant.com but they cost
&gt; money. That's not such a big deal, except it seems a great pity that I
&gt; have to deal with the hassle of doing that.

They cost money? Hmmm, so they do.

&gt; Now what is going on here? Is it:
&gt; 
&gt; (a) It's impossible to get a real modem anymore, and all Linux users
&gt; download software drivers like from Linuxant;

No, that's not true.

&gt; (b) It's easy to get a real modem, I just need to shop around;

This is true. You could also attempt to get them to bring in a Lucent
chipset modem. Ever visited:

&gt; (c) I don't know what I'm talking about, there is no difference
&gt; between "hard" and "soft" modems. :-)

There is a big difference between a soft and hard modem. A soft modem makes
the CPU/operating system do a lot more work than a hard modem does.
 
&gt; If the answer is (b) I'd appreciate knowing a type of modem
&gt; (preferably internal) which is easy to get in Adelaide. The computer
&gt; shop seems cooperative and I suspect they'd get it for me if I asked.

Ask them for *anything* that is *not* a soft modem ;-) If they can't get you
one or won't, get a better supplier. It's not your job to do their job.
