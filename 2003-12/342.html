&gt;&gt;including software developers. It's worth noting that Linux creator

&gt; Opensource is generating billions of $$$ for thee economy :) I'm no
&gt; economist but that's good right?!  :)

Creating a product worth billions is not the same as generating billions.
The billions being spent on Linux solutions were previously being spent
on other platforms, so what Linux is generating is a substantially
different amount.

Also, you're mixing the presumption that innovation is good (which I
agree with), with generating money is good (which I also agree with).
The two ideas are independant.

Thinking about the first paragraph, about killing innovation:  I have
an idea for a product which I intend to develop.  It's going to cost
$250,000+ to develop, uses commodity PC hardware costing about $300
per unit to manufacture, will retail for about $500+, and I expect to
sell a million of them in the third year.  Would you be interested in
investing your money in this project?  If the device was GPLed would
you still be interested?  Do you think the GPL might worry investors?
