&gt; talking about religious topics. This isn't the first
&gt; religious topic by far to fall into this mailing list.
Ouch...  There's that word again.  RELIGION.

Gosh I hate that word, and I'll explain why: When one looks back on the last
6 thousand years of (writen) recorded hisotry, that word is about 90-odd %
responsbile for every injustice under the sun.

It is because of RELIGION that Catholics and Protestants (extremists imho)
have fought each other and died by each others hand(s) in Northern Ireland.
It is because of RELIGION that Conquistadors slaughtered 2 seperate
Civilizations in South America.  It is because of RELIGION that a band of
extremist racists called the KKK hid themselves behind sheets and started
burning crosses on negros lawns and lynching anyone who would even give
these people the time of day. It is because of RELIGION that King Henry the
VIII decided one day that divorce excluded the King and split from the
'Holy' Catholic Church, accordingly elevating the 'Monarchy' into that
position of ultimate authority - just as it is RELIGION that falsly teaches
that the 'Pope' is the physical/perpetual incarnation of Christ on earth.
(Uh Oh - I think I'm in for a HUGH after shock on THAT one)

RELIGION also bugs the living daylights out of me because it amalgamates
every so called 'faith' under the sun into the one catagory.  Accordingly,
Christianity (Which both I and The Bible define as being a doer of the words
of Christ - as oposed to a hearer only) gets put into the same catagory as
Budhism, Taoism, Confusionism, Islam - and every other 'faith' under the sun
that's existed in the last 6 thousand years or writen history.

Now...  Ignoring the debate over whether or not those 'faiths' ARE equal
(I'm using creative licence here, which I claim the right to seeing as it
was my comment about George W that started this whole thing) RELIGION is
(imho) one of the worst words known to the human language because it has
nothing to do with what both the Old *and* the New Testaments teach - which
is RELATIONSHIP...

(IMHO) RELIGION is all about extremism (as in all of the above examples -
and far more than anyone would want to read about in one sitting) whereas
RELATIONSHIP is all about what both the Old and New Testaments 'preach' -
it's the key that the extremists miss... To back that up, did you know that
Christ (while physically on this earth) absaloutly DESPISED religion?

He called the religious people of that time (the Pharisees, and Saducees -
otherwise known as the extremists of the time) "Painted sepulchures (tombs)
full of dead mens bones"  Wow!!!  Now if that aint sumarising what extremism
does to you, then I don't know what does.

And so - in summary - if we're talking about RELIGION, then man...  We might
as well change the name of this list to RELIGIONSA and start a flame
amunition dump (as well as preparing to lose 1/2 the members currently here)
because this will just continue to escalate until we end up fire bombing
each others houses...  (That's what history shows religion does) but if
we're gong to talk about RELATIONSHIP...  Well get ready to see some FREAKY
things because now we're talking about the heart of our Creator and his
ultimate desire for all of us.  If THAT'S what we're going to start talking
about I'll warn you now... Peoples lives are going to change.
