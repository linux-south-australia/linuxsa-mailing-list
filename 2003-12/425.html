<H1>Apple 15" Albook - Linux X11 Problems</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I've sent the email below to the debian PPC lists, but there may be
somebody here that knows what's going on.

Essentially, I've got one of the new 1.25ghz 15" "Albooks" (Aluminium
Powerbooks); OS X works on this fine, but I'm trying to get a Debian
install on it working fine (which was rather interesting, seeing as the
Debian CD's don't support the ATA chipset in it).  This is all working
fine, but X11 refuses to work; the ati or radeon drivers simply will not
find a card in the system, so no go.

This may not be PPC specific; as far as I know, the Apple 15"'s use an
ATI Mobility Radeon 9600 card.  I remember having strange X11 issues
with a Radeon 9600 card in a PC ages ago, and I solved it by getting a
newer card; maybe it's a framebuffer issue, maybe it's a PciID issue,
maybe the radeon or ati drivers in XFree86 need to be told wierd and
strange things.

See below :-)

I followed various instructions to get it all installed via a later
kernel/yaboot, then compiled my own kernel from rsync'ing ben's
sources.  This
all works fine.

XFree86, however, doesn't want to play.  I assume I've got a Radeon 9600
Mobility; neither the ati or radeon drivers, with or without
framebuffer, even
see the card.  I even tried upgrading to experimental's xfree86, but it
still
doesn't want to play.

I'll link to relevant outputs/config files below; no point cluttering up
people's inboxes with junk.

dmesg: <A HREF="http://computeraddictions.com.au/tmp/albook/dmesg.txt">http://computeraddictions.com.au/tmp/albook/dmesg.txt</A>
XFree86 output: <A HREF="http://computeraddictions.com.au/tmp/albook/dmesg.txt">http://computeraddictions.com.au/tmp/albook/dmesg.txt</A>
XF86Config:
<A HREF="http://computeraddictions.com.au/tmp/albook/xfree86.txt">http://computeraddictions.com.au/tmp/albook/xfree86.txt</A> (very
basic, but *should* be enough to bring up a x cursor, right?)

Apologies if this all has been covered before; I've been googling all
morning,
and haven't found anything.  Just link to the relevant thread/URL if it
has
been :-)

Any other tips, XFree86 related or not, from other Albook users would
also be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
