 Dearest John:
 I went to the door today and the postman delivered a Partridge in a
 Pear Tree. What a thoroughly delightful gift! I couldn't have been more
 surprised.
 With deepest love and devotion,
 Agnes

 Dearest John:
 Today the postman brought your very sweet gift. Just imagine - Two
 Turtle Doves! I'm just delighted at your very thoughtful gift. They are
 just adorable.
 All my love,
 Agnes

 Dearest John:
 Oh, aren't you the extravagant one! Now I really must protest. I don't
 deserve such generosity - Three French Hens! They are just delightful,
 but I must insist, you've been too kind.
 Love,
 Agnes

 Dearest John:
 Today the postman delivered Four Calling Birds. Now really, you're
 being too romantic. They are beautiful, but don't you think that enough
 is enough?
 Affectionately,
 Agnes

 Dearest John:
 What a surprise! Today the postman delivered Five Golden Rings - one
 for each finger. You're just impossible, but I love it. Frankly, all
 those birds squawking were beginning to get on my nerves.
 Love,
 Agnes

 Dear John:
 When I opened the door, there were actually Six Geese-A-Laying on my
 front steps. So you're back to the birds again, huh? Those geese are
 huge. Where will I keep them? The neighbors are complaining and I can't
 sleep through the racket. Please stop.
 Cordially,
 Agnes

 John:
 What's with you and those fucking birds? Seven Swans-A-Swimming! What
 kind of a goddamn joke is this? There's bird shit all over the house
 and they never stop with the racket. I can't sleep at night and I'm a
 nervous wreck - it's not funny. So stop with those fucking birds!
 Sincerely,
 Agnes

 OK Buster!
 I think I prefer the birds. What the hell am I going to do with 8 Maids
 a Milking? It's not enough with all these birds and maids a milking,
 but they had to bring their goddamn cows! There's shit all over the
 lawn and I can't move in my own house.
 Just lay off me, smartass!
 Agnes

 Hey Shithead:
 What are you, some kind of sadist? Now there are nine Pipers Piping!
 And Christ do they play! They haven't stopped chasing those maids since
 they got here. The cows are getting upset and they're stepping all over
 those screeching birds. What am I going to do? The neighbors have
 started a petition to evict me!
 You'll get yours!
 Agnes

 You Rotten Prick!
 Now there's Ten Ladies Dancing. I don't know why I call those sluts
 ladies. They've been balling those pipers all night long. The cows
 can't sleep and they've got diarrhea. My living room is a river of
 shit. The commissioner of buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why
 the building shouldn't be condemned.
 I'm siccing the police on you.
 One who means it!!
 Agnes

 Listen Fuckhead:
 What's with the Eleven Lords a Leaping on those Maids and Ladies? Some
 of those broads will never walk again. Those pipers ran through the
 maids and have been committing sodomy with the cows! All 23 birds are
 dead, they've been trampled to death in the orgy. I hope you're
 satisfied, you vicious, rotten swine.
 Your sworn enemy,
 Agnes

 Dear Sir:
 This is to acknowledge receipt of your latest gift of the Twelve
 Drummers Drumming, which you have seen fit to inflict upon our client,
 Miss Agnes McHolstein. The destruction, of course, was total. All
 future cor-respondence should be sent to our attention. If you should
 attempt to contact Miss McHolstein at Happy Dale Sanitarium, the
 attendants have instructions to shoot on sight! With this letter you
 will find attached a warrant for your arrest.
 Cordially,
 Badger, Bender & Cajole
