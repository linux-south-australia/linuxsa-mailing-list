Security is a state of mind. In order to feel secure, I like to do as
much as I can to minimise the risk (within reason) of an attack.

There are a few major areas that you're likely to be vulnerable:

  1. Poorly written software
  2. Poorly configured software
  3. Poorly configured users
  4. Poor physical security

The first one we typically have very little control over. With OSS
becoming more widespread, you have a little more control, but unless you
can code or pay someone to code, you haven't much hope. This is still
the area of security that the media feed off.

The second is one area that many of us on the list have a lot of control
over. By correctly configuring software, it is even possible (at times)
to make a problem with any of the other areas less a problem.

The third area of vulnerability is often ignored or forgotten about. The
article you copied was making the point that user education is a big
issue that really doesn't have enough attention payed to it. Anyone here
*not* seen a monitor somewhere with a password on a post-it note? How
many of you really make sure that there's really, really nobody looking
when you type in your password, enter your work's alarm code or even
your PIN at the ATM? Users need to pick strong passwords that they'll
remember. Many don't understand why or even what a strong password is.

Users also need to be educated about Social Engineering too. Has anyone
here tried calling a random user within an organisation (even small
ones) claiming to be from IT and asking for their password? It can be
quite educational, but check that it's not going to get you fired first
:-)

The other area of security I've listed is physical security. A set of
bolt-cutters makes for a great DoS attack. There are a number of
organisations around the place that have pretty good security
software-wise, but they leave PCs (yes, and sometimes servers) right
next to windows on the ground floor. The list is almost endless.

I hope that this helps,
Matt
