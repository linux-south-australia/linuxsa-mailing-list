&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have played around with autocad a little bit over the years and am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;looking for something without a 3 year learning curve. :-)  Basic 2D
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;drawing is about my level.  I have tended to type autolisp more than
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;use menus if possible 'cause I am weird.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;hmm:  QCAD used to be OK 
&gt;&gt;&gt;xfig is sort of quirky (old fashioned I guess)  but has it's own joys .
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;There are a lot of 2D level apps about most of them get only so far.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Others require Java (some particular version larger than hades) ..
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you find a good one let us know..
&gt;&gt;&gt;Meantime I always found qcad reasonable.. scaling aside.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Somewhat OT : the latest release of blender is simply marvellous.
&gt; Strictly 3D, but you can do reasonable 2D with it. Not 100% sure what
&gt; your application is - if you want a drafting style app where you can
&gt; manually enter dimensions, then blender can do that, but its not quite
&gt; the same.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of my customers seem to use AutoCAD mechanical desktop, with the
&gt; more sensible guys on Catia. Id love to get something running on Linux
&gt; that does that job. I have played with the idea of going in from scratch
&gt; with a C compiler (yeah OK, Im a masochist), till it occurred to me that
&gt; maybe adding on hacks to blender might do the trick.  Next year maybe ..
&gt; 
&gt; I have heard that AutoCAD will never ever ever be ported up to Unix ,
&gt; simply because 90% of it's codebase uses really dumb non-portable hacks
&gt; deep into the undocumented parts of the WindowsAPI, to a point where
&gt; even Wine has no idea what it's trying to achieve.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone managed to get AutoCAD running under a full emulator, like VMWare
&gt; or even bochs ?
&gt; 
&gt; SteveOC
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
I've had AutoCAD working with VMWare and a couple of other CAD programs 
as well, Unigraphics and SolidEdge, started to play with bochs but never 
had any luck with it.
Interestingly AutoCAD used to have a version for Unix, version 10 I 
think, according to AutoDesk there just wasn't much demand for a couple 
of hundred dollar application to run on a multi thousand dollar workstation.

cheers,
David Creed
