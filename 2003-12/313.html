I think we need to distinguisgh between business innovations and technical 
innovations :-)

The concept of WIMP was an innovation when Xerox did it, but then Apple 
implemented it and made it available to lots more more people. Microsoft 
was hardly being technically innovative when it finally got WIMP correct, 
but it has, IMO, been innovative in a business manner. Certainly, managing 
to grab and defend a monopoly in this day and age was innovative :-)
 
&gt; GPL is a new idea because Marx never wrote a single word.

I am confused by this comment. It seems to imply that the GPL is in some 
sense Marxist, but, despite RMS' leanings, I don't believe it is. It is a 
licence that is more restrictive that some other licences and less 
restrictive than others. I work for a start-up that one day hopes to be a 
public company or part of a public company. The GPL can be a very useful 
tool in today's market since it allows use to make available certain 
source code while keeping more control over it than some other licences 
do.

We need to avoid emotionally charged terms if we are to have a productive 
discussion.
