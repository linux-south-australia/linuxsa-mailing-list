Well, perhaps to make the argument a little more pertinent, lets look 
back to the original link
<A HREF="http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/catalog/hansard/2003/lc/wh031203.lc.htm">http://www.parliament.sa.gov.au/catalog/hansard/2003/lc/wh031203.lc.htm</A>
If I read it rightly, the quote we are discussing is:
"Any concerted move to open source would kill innovation, because 
revenue is essential for all serious practitioners in the economy, 
including software developers. It's worth noting that Linux creator 
Linus Torvalds created a product worth billions of dollars, yet [he] 
still has to scrabble for a job. This is not a model we want for 
Australian software."
apparently by one Tony Healy.
To my mind, this makes the more relevant subjects for discussion: 'Does 
Open Source kill innovation?' and 'Will this model do Good Things[tm] 
for Australian software?', rather than 'is Open Source innovative 
itself'.
And these are still interesting questions.

Davidn (sign your posts, man! ;)) has suggested that 
&gt; Also, the research for true innovation is usually quite time consuming, 
&gt; and if you're not being paid for it it can be hard to justify the 
&gt; expense in time.

Research being necessary for innovation?
I'm not sure that it is a requirement. Sufficient, yes, but not 
necessary.
One thing that has come out of this discussion so far is that we arent 
clear on what innovation is.
Perhaps we should just call it 'new things happening in computers' and 
abandon the debate on what has been innovative in the past.

Dale Long says
&gt; [the GPL] can be percieved 
&gt; to allow more potential for innovation due to the open way the code 
&gt; can be worked on.

I'm inclined to agree with the latter - no matter how we define 
innovation, open source products inherently let us do a Newton - "If I  
have seen further than other men, it is because I have stood upon the 
shoulders of giants."

Can anyone list places where open source developments have stifled more 
cash-hungry products?
