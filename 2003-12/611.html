Romana,

You are a legend my friend, and I LOVE your tongue in cheek wit!!!  (Humour
is a lost art in todays day and age it seems)  :-(

Let me just summarise what I understand your argument is.  If I've
understood, you seem to be suggesting there is a blatant contradiction in
the two books (Old and New Testaments) and if that's the case, let me help
you out by giving you the ULTRA condenced version of the answer.

Because the words Jesus spoke seemed to contradict the teaching of what we
now know to be the Old Testament - even the Jews of Jesus time asked him
many times if he was teaching somthing different.  ...He simply replied:
(Matthew 5: 17-18 " Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the
Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to
you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jott or one tittle will by no
means pass from the law till all is fulfilled...." and - well you can choose
to read the rest or not for yourself.

That's (as Shaun might point out) a surface answer.  I'm happy to plum the
depths of the issue if you REALLY want to know the who's what's when's and
why' - but I guess this depends on whether this is a quest for knowledge -
or just an argument to pass the time.  :-)

&gt; hoo boy, am i gonna BURN for this one;))))
&gt; still, its a hot day already;)
&gt;
&gt; On Tue, Dec 16, 2003 at 01:32:48PM +1030, David WOLVERTON imparted:
&gt; &gt; IMHO (and I believe the Bible backs it up) the Crussaders were not
&gt; &gt; fundamentalists - they were extremists. Just as the KKK, IRA, Nazi's,
Pol
&gt; &gt; Pot - and all like minded - are/were equally extremists.
&gt;
&gt; ditto muslim extremists that blow things up then?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also for the record, if ANYBODY wants to know what fundamentalist
&gt; &gt; Christianity teaches, simply read the sermon on the Mount as taught by
Jesus
&gt; &gt; Himself. (Read Matthew - otherwise refered to as the Beatitudes. Start
at
&gt; &gt; Matthew Chapeter 5 and finish reading at Matthew Chapter 8.)
&gt;
&gt; hmm i would actually take fundamentalist anythings as absolutists. ie
&gt; you are convinced the bible is 100% right. thats fundamental
&gt; christianity. so lets look, shall we. lets start with some of my dr laura
quotes.
&gt; bible quote included fr eddification:))
&gt;
&gt; "I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
&gt; clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill
&gt; him myself?"
&gt; 35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
&gt; be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth
&gt; work therein shall be put to death.
&gt;
&gt; well? who kills the neighbour?
&gt;
&gt; "I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her
&gt; period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how
&gt; do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense."
&gt; 15:19 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
&gt; blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her
&gt; shall be unclean until the even.
&gt;
&gt; go ahead - ask. do you ask every woman this? and if not, why not?
&gt;
&gt; heres some of my faves. yes, the devil can quote scripture. shakespeare
&gt; said that btw:) its rumoured he was a naughty bisexual too. what a dude!
&gt;
&gt; Leviticus 21:13   And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
&gt; i jolly hope so! widows, you are on your own!!!!
&gt;
&gt; more Leviticus wisdom:
&gt; 21:16   And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
&gt; 21:17 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
&gt; generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the
&gt; bread of his God.
&gt; 21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
&gt; approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any
&gt; thing superfluous,
&gt; 21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
&gt; 21:20 Or crookbacked, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
&gt; or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
&gt;
&gt; oo. stones broken, jolly nasty that. well, it seems supermodels only get
&gt; the bread of god. hope its fat free, you know how fussy they are...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; personally, i hope you are treating your slaves well. Exodus is full of
&gt; pithy advice:
&gt; 21:1   Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
&gt; 21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in
&gt; the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
&gt; 21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
&gt; married, then his wife shall go out with him.
&gt; 21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons
&gt; or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he
&gt; shall go out by himself.
&gt; 21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,
&gt; and my children; I will not go out free:
&gt; 21:6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
&gt; bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore
&gt; his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
&gt;
&gt; so, if your servant marries the woman you chose for him, the bible says
&gt; you keep the progeny. how simply marvellous for you! of crse, you can be
&gt; magnanimous and set him free - but if he loves his family, youy get to
&gt; brand him by piercing his ear and keep him always. does workcover know
&gt; of this?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4 very short examples include:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; M 5:7 "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."  M 5:9
&gt; &gt; "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God."
M
&gt; &gt; 5: 22-22 "You have heard it ws said to those of old 'you shall not
murder'
&gt; &gt; and whoever murders will be in dagner of the judgment. But *I* say to
you
&gt; &gt; that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in
danger of
&gt; &gt; the judgemnt"  M 5: 38-39 "You have heard that it was said 'an eye for
an
&gt; &gt; eye and a tooth for a tooth' But *I* tell you not to resist an evil
person.
&gt; &gt; But whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other to him also."
(I
&gt; &gt; could go on for MANY pages - but I'm sure we all get the point)
&gt;
&gt; oh my yes. but wherefore then the invasion of iraq? war on terrorism -
&gt; no, no! give them another cheek!
&gt;
&gt; btw, there are clubs that offer such cheek offering activities i
&gt; believe:)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ***THIS*** is fundamentalist Christianity, spoken by the very person who
the
&gt; &gt;  word defines.  And ANYTHING else is EXTREMIST.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; umm, yes. as both our examples show...fundamentalism in all its
ummm............
&gt;
&gt; but lets not, to quote philip adams, let a little thing like god come
&gt; between us:)
