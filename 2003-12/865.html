&gt; no, happy with 19" at 1280x1024 when at home, when on the move
&gt; I can accept smaller screen as the trade-off for not carrying
&gt; around too much stuff.  But what I don't know is when I get home
&gt; can I plug in external monitor, keyboard and mouse and have it
&gt; run at 1280x1024 on the external monitor?

In which case, definitely go with the 12" iBook - if you're all for not 
carrying around much, you'll probably find it perfect.  It'll 
definitely run your 19" at that higher resolution, too.  iBooks, of 
course, also take quite a beating - the plastic casing is extremely 
sturdy.

I personally find, though, that once you're used to the laptop's LCD, 
going back to a CRT, even a larger one, really hurts your eyes - 
unless, of course, you run it at a high refresh rate (&gt;80), which 
usually means the monitor can't go quite as high in resolution (and 
even then, the CRT hurts my eyes after extended periods).  You may find 
you don't use your external monitor at all.

Of course, previous laptop experience will tell your preferences on 
this.

I honestly have no idea why anybody would buy a 17" Powerbook - they're 
too damn big, apparently get damaged stupidly easily, and you need a 
bag the size of a mammoth to carry them around.

&gt; the powerbook seems like lots more money for not much more
&gt; (compared to the ibook, the powerbook compares well to well-
&gt; specced x86 laptops though but the ibook looks the bargain)

Comment in previous post was to address this comment; it certainly is a 
bargain, but there are differences that definitely justify the cost 
difference.  I'm happy as hell with mine, but that's because I really 
needed some of the extras (faster cpu, better video card, larger 
screen/resolution, more hard drive space, 4x DVD burner - I'm planning 
on a lot of mobile video work in the near future).
