&gt; I think that this is part of the power of the idea. However, an audit of

Hi Richard,

The biggest problem is building the topologies required for
testing network-oriented programs.  Linux isn't quite at
the stage where you can run a set of VMs interconnected
with an arbitrary network.  So even an "automated" set
of regression tests still requires purpose-built test
scenarios.

I'd expect that to change, as Linux's virtualisation
improves.

For some programs, like a compiler, the attached network
is irrelevant.  So you'll find programs like GCC have
good regression test packages.

For testing Samba in a distributed way you'll probably
need to wait a while longer, as the networking is the
point with Samba.

For things like ethereal, a "replay" interface in the
kernel would be invaluable.  That exercises a lot more
of the code then some sort of "test" interface API
in Ethereal.

Finally, I'm not sure if it is worthwhile distributing
regression testing.  A good regression test checks that
the thing that was corrected by the bug fix hasn't
returned.  So you'll usually find that forcing developers
to populate the regression test suite is the issue,
whereas the entire suite will run in a few hours each
evening.

Given that, I'm not sure what advantage distributed
regression testing has over distributed use and better
(ie, automated) bug reporting.

Best wishes,
Glen
