An excellent article Greg, -a good read. Easier to understand than some I
have waded through.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Whats wrong with saugov? Its a moderatley sized Exchange 5.5
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cluster running on NT 4.0, which tends to get hit with every major
&gt; &gt;&gt; virus outbreak. That's whats wrong with saugov.sa.gov.au
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What would be wrong with ...@department.sa.gov.au?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have lost count of the number of people who have said "huh?...what
&gt; &gt; a stupid email address, it repeats itself" when I've given mine out
&gt; &gt; over the phone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As for the Exchange cluster, I've also lost count of the number of
&gt; &gt; "SERVER#X is going down for reboot" messages that I've received
&gt; &gt; recently.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS They're actually in the process "upgrading" the NT4 boxes to a
&gt; &gt; much more stable mail platform...Windows 200x, now I can sleep at
&gt; &gt; nights ;P
&gt; 
&gt; I've been busy living a Real Life over the last few days, and I don't
&gt; think anybody would thank me for reviving this thread, but:
&gt; 
&gt; As most of you know, the "Linux and Open Source in Government"
&gt; conference, which we have given the less obvious name "OCGCONF" (Open
&gt; Computing in Government) will be happening next month.  We're still
&gt; looking for a second panel session.  This sounds like a good topic:
&gt; 
&gt;  - Microsoft has a proven track record of broken mail implementations.
&gt;  - Mail is important to just about everybody.
&gt;  - Open source alternatives are available, and they work well.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not going to mention the L word here, though there's no reason not
&gt; to do so on the panel: many open source implementations, such as
&gt; sendmail, run on other platforms.  That could be one point to discuss.
&gt; Another might be the unfortunate mail addresses that SA government
&gt; people have, and why they were necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; My question: can we get some interesting people together to talk on
&gt; the subject?  Some of the people on this list would be a good start,
&gt; but I don't want anybody to get into trouble.  On the other hand,
&gt; getting both them (you?) and some of the SA government policy makers
&gt; together to discuss the matter could be interesting, and it might also
&gt; have the positive outcome that the system could be greatly improved
&gt; and money saved.
