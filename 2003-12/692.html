&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Strictly Confidential  & Urgent Business Proposal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Re: Transfer Of Usd $21,500.000{Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred
&gt;
&gt; Thousand Us Dollars Only.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am a member of the Federal Government Of  Nigerian National Petroleum
&gt;
&gt; Corporation (N.N.P.C).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Petroleum
&gt;
&gt; Trust Fund (P.T.F.) BY MY COMMITTEE.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 21.5Million Dollars.
&gt;
&gt; This was done delibrately. The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee
&gt; to benefit from the project.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; We not want to transfer this money, which is in a suspense account with
&gt;
&gt; the P.T.F. into any oversea account, which we expect you to provide for us.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Share:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 60 % of the money would be for my partners and I.
&gt; &gt; 30 % of the money would be yours, for providing us with logistics, which,
&gt;
&gt; would include a safe bank account, where we shall facilitate funds transfer
&gt; into, as soon as documentations are concluded over here.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any
&gt;
&gt; expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction, (both
&gt; local and international expenses).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If interested in assisting us, please contact me via my secured email
&gt;
&gt; address, as soon as possible (<A HREF="mailto:goronyo.baba2@caramail.com">goronyo.baba2@caramail.com</A>) or my secured
&gt; satellite tel/fax number, specially procured for this project.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It may interest you to know that a similar transaction was carried out
&gt;
&gt; with one Mr. Patrice Miller, President of Crane International Trading
&gt; Corp., of 153 East 57th St., 28th floor, N.Y.10022, Telephone: 212-308-7788
&gt; and Telex: 6731689. The deal was concluded and all covering documents,
&gt; forwarded to Mr. Miller to authenticate the claims. Once the funds were
&gt; transferred, Mr. Miller presented to his bank, all the legal documents and
&gt; remitted the whole funds to another bank account, and disappeared
&gt; completely. My colleagues and I were shattered, since such opportunities
&gt; are not easy to come by.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Please, if you are interested in assisting us carry out to the fullest
&gt;
&gt; capacity, this transaction, we would require the following information from
&gt; you which would enable us make formal application to the various ministries
&gt; / parastatals, for the release and onward transfer of the money to your
&gt; account.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.Your Full Name, Company's Name, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers.
&gt; &gt; 2.Your Bank Name, Address. Telephone and Fax Number.
&gt; &gt; 3.Your Bank Account Number and Beneficiary Name - You must be the
&gt;
&gt; signatory.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Please, note that we have strong and reliable connections at the Central
&gt;
&gt; Bank Of Nigeria and other Government Parastatals, hence assistance in this
&gt; regards, would not be a problem.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; At the conclusion of this transaction, we shall use same contacts to
&gt;
&gt; withdraw all documents used in the course of this, to avoid any trace
&gt; whatsoever that may ever arise, to you or to us, now and in the nearest
&gt; possible future.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It might also interest you to know that we are mere civil servants who do
&gt;
&gt; not want to miss this opportunity, hence, we want this money transferred
&gt; out, as soon as possible, before the newly democratically elected
&gt; government ever think of making enquiries as regards the various activities
&gt; of the past military government.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Kindly contact me as soon as possible, whether or not you are interested
&gt;
&gt; in this deal, so that whereby you are not interested, it would give us more
&gt; room to scout for another partner. But if you are interested, kindly
&gt; contact me via above email, telephone or fax, so that we can swing into
&gt; action, as time is not on our part.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
&gt; &gt; Yours Faithfully,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Dr.Goronyo Baba.
