Some good thinking went into your suggestions, but I don't agree
with any of them.

I'm not entirely sure what a 'scripting language' is, but I am sure
that Python is a general computer language.  It supports a wide range
of features, but none appear innovative.  Embedable, extendable and
interesting data structures (including the dictionary type with which
PostScript programmers are already familiar), and obviously the Lispisms
(which Lisp programmers obviously know) are pre-exist Python.

&gt; Keith Packards work on X11 has been pretty innovative.

I don't know what Keith Packard has done, so I've looked him up on
the web.  He says the Render extension is the result of work to expose
the capabilities in modern graphics hardware, most notably anti-aliased
graphics and image compositing.  That's not new.  It may be new to X11,
but it's not new.
Most recently the 

&gt; Recent work on the 2.6 linux kernel has been pretty innovative. I read an 
&gt; article which benchmarked various operations for scaleability, and the Linux 
&gt; kernel was O(1) for *all* of them.

Again, this is not innovative.  Many academics, for example Wirth and
Knuth, have written about scheduling.  That Linux is only now considering
these performance issues speaks for it's history, not for it's innovation.

...

&gt; X11 itself was developed at MIT and originally had an open source 
&gt; implementation didn't it?

X11 was not innovative.  Xerox did the seminal work on windowing systems.


Let me give an example of innovation:  Microsoft Office, post '97 has a
'paper clip' which uses cognitive processing to try to understand what
you are doing.  It uses this 'understanding' to give relevant help.
Now I'm not claiming that this is Microsoft's innovation, nor that it
does a particularly good job.  I am claiming that programs which examine
what you are doing to gain an understanding of it is innovative.
