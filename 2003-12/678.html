&gt; I tend to agree on this point.
&gt; (Not because DSL is right, but, been there, seen it happen.)

I'm right with you guys on this point but......

&gt; Forums are often very disorganised and horribly complex creatures.
&gt; They are not well suited to threaded discussions and are a
&gt; moderators nightmare. Not to mention they (seem to) *encourage*
&gt; horribly formated HTML posts with flashing things =(

Complex, yes but the organisation is a function of the organisers. :-) I'm a
moderator at www.cricketweb.net and with a well-organised group of mods,
things can run smoothly (and don't you for a minute think that a cricket
forum can't get nawsty; just try watching a flame war between Indians and
Pakistanis when it comes to cricket!). It does require some time devotion on
the part of the mods for sure but with a little bit of effort, it can work
and having known mods on other forums, I really do believe this to be so.

As for the HTML stuff, most forum software allows you to turn off pretty
anything you don't like, including HTML stuff which can bugger up the
forum's look and design (I've seen THAT happen too). You can turn off image
tags to stop people from putting horribly huge images in the sigs and you
can turn off sigs too. Plus there's language filters and whatnot. Again,
pretty anything undesirable can be stopped.

Philosophically, I'm sure there are plenty of other arguments you could make
and if a forum simply isn't wanted that's fine but technically, there's
nothing stopping LinuxSA from starting a forum.
