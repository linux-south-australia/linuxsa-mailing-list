&gt; &gt; X11 itself was developed at MIT and originally had an open source
&gt; &gt; implementation didn't it?
&gt;
&gt; X11 was not innovative.  Xerox did the seminal work on windowing systems.

Network transparency was not innovative? The fact that you could be sitting 
there with 5 windows on your desktop, each from a different server, all 
running seamlessly. I don't know much about Xerox's windowing system, so it 
may have had that also, I don't know. 

Also, the fact that the protocol is extensible is what is allowing Keith 
Packard to keep X11 relevant on todays high performance machines. So some of 
his work may not be innovative in the general realm of things, but in the 
bounds of X11 where he has to work, it is. It's just like Microsoft saying 
adding long file names to FAT32 was innovative (and somehow worthy of a 
patent). Other file systems had long file names, but it was the fact that 
they tacked it on to a system that wasn't designed for it, that was claimed 
to be "innovative".

How about a _really_ old example of innovation. Emacs. I can't remember the 
exact story, but Richard Stallman hacked together some extensible editor 
based on a similar editor people were already using. In 1983 or so, he 
started work on the Emacs we know today, which was written on top of a Lisp 
virtual machine (which he also wrote AFAIK). This allows emacs to be extended 
to do practically anything using Lisp (I've sometimes played Sokoban in it :)

What about TeX? That was originally open source wasn't it? (made by David 
Knuth, IIRC). And then the LaTeX classes added on top. Then of course LyX to 
make writing LaTeX documents easier using a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You 
Mean) interface.

&gt; Let me give an example of innovation:  Microsoft Office, post '97 has a
&gt; 'paper clip' which uses cognitive processing to try to understand what
&gt; you are doing.  It uses this 'understanding' to give relevant help.
&gt; Now I'm not claiming that this is Microsoft's innovation, nor that it
&gt; does a particularly good job.  I am claiming that programs which examine
&gt; what you are doing to gain an understanding of it is innovative.

Would you class Microsoft Bob (the precursor to clippy) as innovative? I guess 
it was really, but innovation doesn't necessarily mean the resulting software 
is useful. Only a commercial company could come up with something so 
annoying.

Spamassassin examines emails and determines whether or not they're spam. 
Applied generally, that sort of rule matching based on regular expressions 
could determine that you were trying to write a letter, or a resume, or 
whatever other common tasks people do.

Hmm, imagine that:

"It looks like you're trying to write a 419 Advanced Fee Fraud Scam, would you 
like to:

- Set Caps Lock to be permanently on
- Select from a list of fraud templates
- Switch off the spelling and grammar checker
- All of the above"

:)

Cheers,

Damien
