The reason "init q" exists is clear once you make the
typo "kill -9 1".



As far as running services from /etc/inittab, you really
only want to do this for services which should need
restarting as part of their normal operation.

To take the DNS server example, why would you want
to automatically restart one that has mysteriously
died?

Firstly, the DNS protocol is designed to be robust against
server failure.  So what's the rush?  If you need to rush,
that shows a problem with your DNS architecture.

Secondly, silently restarting a service doesn't fix the
problem.  In the case of network protocols it can
actually get in the way (let's say you've got 2 good
DNS servers and one bad one.  Why do you want the bad
one running.  Most crashes are due to pointer problems,
so there's high odds that the server could give bogus
responses and stuff you totally.

And that explains the popularity of daemon monitoring
programs.  Because you want to know when the daemon
died, because that event says that manual intervention
is needed.


As for djbdns, I like the software.  But I do wish
its author could learn to get along with people.
I've worked with the BIND people on a number of
issues and I've always found them pleasant and
useful. So Mr Bernstein's antagonism towards them
seems way over the top.
