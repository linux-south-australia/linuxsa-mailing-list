I think there has to be a mix of both. I've taught guitar for years and long
books on music theory tend to bore people stupid but teaching them the
opening riff to Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' gets them excited. Sure
I could insist that to play guitar 'properly', they'd have to learn the
names every mode of a major scale, learn four-part vocal harmony and the
bazillions of rules contained therein and then understand alternate picking,
string-skipping, flat-picking, bounce-picking etc. BEFORE I teach them their
first jazz standard but geez, how tough would that be? For the first month
of guitar I learnt, all I did was right-hand technique. I didn't touch the
fretboard once in that time and I was BORED.

Similar to computers. If there's one thing that gets people more interested
in a topic it's achievement. With total theory books, that's a long time
coming. I remember being so excited the first time wrote my first shell
script, configured my first sound card using ALSA, made my first compound in
chemistry at Uni, etc. I really believe in the concept of learning theory
THROUGH stuff like specific applied examples. Just throwing a whole lot of
theory at someone may (if they stick with it) make them more knowledgable on
the topic in the end but would they use it all anyway? I'd rather see
someone learn how to flatpick through learning a familiar bluegrass song
than to hand them a book called 'Flatpicking.README'.

&gt; obselete examples in the book, find that many of them don't work, and
&gt; chalk up this whole Linux thing as something that's just too hard to
&gt; master?

Hence why I like books that teach by concept, and not by method - they
can still be very valuable after the product is obselete.  Problem is
such books tend to be a lot longer/involved, and the average person's
attitude towards this kind of thing tends to lean towards what's
easier.  Sigh :-(
