&gt; It is possible, but with all of the background noise on the Internet these days,
&gt; it's not very practical for a DSL connection. For every IP you have routed to
&gt; your connection, expect about 12k per hour of scans, pings, and worm nuisance.
&gt; Over a class C with 256 addresses, that's over 3 megabytes, every hour. 

It's not that bad - the noise floor is lower.  My experience is that as 
long as it's not during a worm outbreak that it's no more than 0.5MB/hr 
per Class C at the moment and in fact probably quite a bit lower.  It's 
been higher in the past with worms or new exploits.  [Top half of my 
Class C is unused entirely and it's receiving the equiv of 603KB/hr per 
Class C according to a 30day average based on an IPTABLEs rule dropping 
everything to it]

It maybe that I'm lucky but also:
I don't use P2P apps which tend to lead to traffic, even when you've 
turned things off [KAZAA is evil]
I drop everything I don't care about and don't respond - this also leads 
to a lot less efficent scanning.
