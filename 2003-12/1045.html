Mark,

&gt;  &gt; Angus and Robertson have a number (a significant number) of RedHat
&gt;  &gt; Unleased, an older version, for just $20. Whilst I think the version is
&gt;  &gt; 6.0 from memory beginners may still find it useful.
&gt;  
&gt; Yeah.  If those beginners want to install a distro which can be r00ted
&gt; in about ten seconds.

Nonetheless, the discussions about file systems, the theoretical discussions
about security, how Apache is setup and such don't particularly change. Nor
do the sections on the command line tools and so forth.

Still useful as a reference for some things and it's difficult to go past
$20 for computer books these days :-(

&gt; Not sure we (as a user group) ought to be encouraging that kind of 
&gt; thing.  Old distros really should be allowed to evaporate in peace.

Agreed, I hadn't intended anyone to install RedHat 6.0, but my intention
was to mean that there's still some useful information in there.

[Although I did stumble across an O'Reilly 2nd Edition Programming C# book
for $20, a markdown of some $100]

&gt;  &gt; Also, Dymocks and Angus and Robertson are both doinng 20% discount on
&gt;  &gt; computer books until 31 December. Dymocks is doing 20% off on
&gt;  &gt; *everything* until today.
&gt;  
&gt; That's much better :-)

It is :-)
