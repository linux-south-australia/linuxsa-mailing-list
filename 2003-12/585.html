&gt; &gt; beep. sorry, the point is these guys are devout christians who order
&gt; &gt; mass death. is that ok?
&gt; The point I'd like to add Rom, is that a survey of Christians would not
&gt; say these men were representative of the Christian faith.  A survery of
&gt; what they have said, done and proclaimed may back that view point up.


ok, lets say (as you ignored the points above this bit. debates out of
context are then spin doctored, but hey, i can roll with it;) ) we look
at hiv/aids.

lets look at how fundamentalists christians jumped on the blame
bandwagon. how it was 'gods punishment on the sinners'

lets look at how fundamentalists christians in the deep fried south of
the good ol us of a dealt with blacks. again, the klanners believe they
are good christians.

hmm. not so, re disagreement over these men being good christians. many
nazis felt justified in exterminating the jews. hell, that attitude
springs back to the crusades and before. theres a cheery fundamentalist
view for you.


&gt; 
&gt; But lumping Bush and Howard in with Hitler is equivalent to lumping Simon
&gt; Crean (or the new "Paul Keating" clone guy whose name escapes me) in with
&gt; Stalin - both are ridiculous comparisons.


bush and howard ordered men to kill and sent them to deaths. hitler did
same. atrocities are committed on all sides.
*shrug* 

'they started it' is a pissant little kid approach, btw. the iraq war
was convenient, but there are certainly several otehr dictatorships
young shrubby jr and his 'depooty' sherrif johhny 'can i kiss that for
you sir' howard havent gotten involved with. just the ones that suit.


&gt; Australian and American politics are very bland - neither side of power
&gt; differ in much of what they say, so comparing them with Hitler, Pol Pot,
&gt; Stalin or any other extreme leader is silly IMHO.

bland? foclmho - body bags are NEVER bland, my friend. they are
tragedies.

&gt; But it's good to see we can agree on some things at least Rom :-)


course we do!!! lots of things. 

just not this:))


r,likes a good debate and where was my damn chocolate in all this mate?
