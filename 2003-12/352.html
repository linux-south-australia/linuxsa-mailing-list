This whole argument is one big troll.

IBM shit on any over company for research dollars spent. If 
patents are a sign of innovation, IBM is miles ahead. IBM derive 
considerable income from selling services and hardware related 
to open source and selling software that runs on open source 
platforms.

This whole argument is stupid.

If people cannot see innovation in Open Source it is because Big 
Idea Innovation is rare, and a lot of the basic big ideas are 
known. Most of it got done ages ago by dead people. Name your 
top ten mathematicians or top ten physisists of all time. How 
many dead?

Clippy was not an MS innovation he is derived from MS Bob. MS 
Bob sucked and I don't think MS have been keen to innovate since 
- I can't blame them.

Anyway, I think the likes of Tim Berners-Lee working at an 
institution like CERN is more likely to come up with the next 
big thing that some shit-bored staffer working at a well known 
manufacturer of Typewriter Emulation Software.

&gt; "Any concerted move to open source would kill innovation, because 
&gt; revenue is essential for all serious practitioners in the economy, 
BIG FURPHY.

There is plenty of revenue to be had from open source software. 
I am not a fucking charity. If you want your server set up you 
can damn well pay me.

Trying to get ahead of the next bastard, I am just as likely to 
use my time and money to innovate as Microsoft.

It is not communist to innovate for fun in your spare time, it 
is called having a hobby.

&gt; including software developers. It's worth noting that Linux creator 
&gt; Linus Torvalds created a product worth billions of dollars, yet [he] 
&gt; still has to scrabble for a job. This is not a model we want for 
&gt; Australian software."

IBM contribute to Linus's OSDL pay check as do such innovative 
companies as Alcatel, Cisco, CA, Dell, Ericsson, Fujitsu, 
Hitachi, HP, Intel, NEC, Nokia, Novell, Red Hat, Sun, Toshiba, 
Unilever, and Wind River.

Linus does not sleep under a bridge. Linus drives a really nice 
new BMW.

Many thousands of people derive an income using Linuses work.
