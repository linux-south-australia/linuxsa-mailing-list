What is the more worrying - ATMs affected by worms 
or ATMs running under Windows OS?

Experts Worried After Worm Hits Windows-Based ATMs

 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Automatic teller machines at two banks
 running Microsoft's popular Windows software were infected by a
 computer virus in August, the maker of the machines said on
 Monday.
 The ATM infections, first reported by SecurityFocus.com, are
 believed to be the first of a computer virus wiggling directly
 onto cash machines.
 Computer security experts predicted more problems to come as
 Windows migrates to critical systems consumers rely on.
 An unknown number of ATMs running Windows XP Embedded were shut
 down during the spread of the so-called "Nachi" worm, said
 officials at Diebold Inc., which made the ATMs and refused to
 name the customers affected.

 &lt;snip&gt;

 "It's a harbinger of things to come," said Bruce Schneier, chief
 technical officer of network monitoring firm Counterpane Internet
 Security.
 "Specific purpose machines, like microwave ovens and until now
 ATM machines, never got viruses," said Schneier, author of
 "Beyond Fear." "Now that they are using a general purpose
 operating system, Diebold should expect a lot more of this in the
 future."

 &lt;snip&gt;

 "It's a horrendous security mistake," he said, of specific-
 purpose machines like ATMs running Windows, written for general
 purpose computers and for which Microsoft Corp. releases security
 fixes on a regular basis. "I'm a lot more worried about my money
 than I was before this."
 Diebold switched from using IBM's OS/2 on its ATMs because banks
 were requesting Windows, said Steve Grzymkowski, senior product
 marketing manager at Diebold.
