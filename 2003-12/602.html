On Tue, Dec 16, 2003 at 01:13:03PM +1030, Taylor, Corey (SAPOL) imparted:
&gt; If all fundamentalism was only about was sticking to the 10 commandments
&gt; 'religiously' (for example), well everyone's a fundamentalist.
&gt; Fundamentalism encompasses factors such as behaviour and let's face it, some
&gt; precepts that fundamentalists use are their own interpretations of their
&gt; dogma rather than being as clear-cut as the aforementioned commandments. A
&gt; lot of the time, it comes down to interpretation. Example:
&gt;  
&gt; "Remember the Sabbath Day and keep it holy."
&gt;  
&gt; Non-extremist interpretation = Go to church on Sunday and encourage others
&gt; to do so.
&gt;  
&gt; Extremist interpretation = Go to church Sunday, lambast those who don't,
&gt; lobby government to make it illegal to to avoid going to church/if in power,
&gt; make it illegal.


ok, for taking extreme interpretation to the nth degree....
this is how it ends up - enjoy!!!

Ask Dr Laura

This letter has been circulating on the net. Reportedly the author is
Kent Ashcraft.
Dear Dr. Laura,

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I
have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge
with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the
homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus
18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need
some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and
how to best follow them.

When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a
pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They
claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?

I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus
21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for
her?

I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her
period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how
do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around
us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not
Canadians. Can you clarify?

I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill
him myself?

A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an
abomination (Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.
I don't agree. Can you settle this?

Lev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a
defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my
vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you
can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal
and unchanging.
