&gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Me and a co-developer are going to CVS one of our 
&gt; &gt; projects as a couple of extra people are coming
&gt; &gt; on board.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We were going to use CVS, but, we want to see
&gt; &gt; if there is anything a bit more flexable/automatic.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We looked at Arch (ACVS). We quite like it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any personal opinions on what
&gt; &gt; they use ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks ;)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; What flexibilty requirements are you trying to achieve ?
&gt; 
&gt; Ive used CVS most of my life, and have always found that there are
&gt; enough ad-ons or other ways around a problem to be able to use CVS,
&gt; where are first glance it looks like it might not fit the job.

Ultimately, a code management system is a personal choice. However, there 
are a number of different systems out there. Many people choose to use 
CVS, however, quite a lot of companies seem to use Perforce. I know that 
we run an enormous number of branches, and we sling code around from one 
branch to another with very few ill affects.

However, I am not suggesting you use perforce or indeed anything other 
than CVS. The only reason I mention perforce is to demonstrate that there 
are other needs out there that are not handled well by CVS.

However, the cost of not using CVS for a small project is that you cannot 
leverage off of the help and experience that is out there.
