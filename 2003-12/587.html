&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Bush, Howard and Hitler are arguably a few other christian murderers
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for you to have on your side.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Shaun, with all due respect, your biases are embarrasing.

Why ?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; beep. sorry, the point is these guys are devout christians who order
&gt; &gt; mass death. is that ok?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The point I'd like to add Rom, is that a survey of Christians would not
&gt; say these men were representative of the Christian faith.  A survery of
&gt; what they have said, done and proclaimed may back that view point up.

Are you saying that they were christian fundamentalists, not just
"normal" christians ?

&gt; But lumping Bush and Howard in with Hitler is equivalent to lumping Simon
&gt; Crean (or the new "Paul Keating" clone guy whose name escapes me) in with
&gt; Stalin - both are ridiculous comparisons.

Explain how comparing hitler with bush and howard is ridiculous. I see
more in common than not.

&gt; Australian and American politics are very bland - neither side of power
&gt; differ in much of what they say, so comparing them with Hitler, Pol Pot,
&gt; Stalin or any other extreme leader is silly IMHO.

Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me that pol pot was a christian too.

You are right though, the successful political parties tend to get more
votes by persecuting other races/ religeons so they are very similar.
Border control, wars, invasions, etc all are designed to distance the
white christian voters from those coloured heathens so we can all feel
better about our superiority.

The right wing succeeds because we are raciest and too stupid to see the
world in others eyes.

&gt; But it's good to see we can agree on some things at least Rom :-)

You have many things in common, here is a tip though. If you want to win
a religeous argument against her- research well.
