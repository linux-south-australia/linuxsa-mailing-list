&gt; It is, isn't it.  As an aside, a claim is made in
&gt; <A HREF="http://samba.org/rsync/tech_report/node6.html">http://samba.org/rsync/tech_report/node6.html</A> that "The amount transferred
&gt; was also considerably less than the size of the diff file that would
&gt; have been transferred if the diff/patch method of updating a remote
&gt; file was used."  I dispute that claim.  The amount transferred is the
&gt; sum of written plus read which, for all blocksizes above 300, is close
&gt; to constant and is in the save vacinity as the 2.1MB of the diff.

Sure, though what is actually important to the reader depends a bit on
their situation - eg is there a bottleneck in downstream or upstream
bandwidth?

But anyway, if you actually have both the old and new copies of the
files (or set of files) on the same machine then you can always (I
think) theoretically do better than rsync by generating some sort of
diff.

The innovation of rsync is that you don't need to keep the old
versions around and still be able to quickly transfer (mostly) just
the differences. ie. no planning ahead required.
