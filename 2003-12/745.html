&gt;QCad 1.5 is still available and free and is quite straight forward and 
&gt;simple.  The non free version is version 2 and is a rewrite.  Quite
&gt;good although has a few bugs.  Cheap at $25 US.  I think it uses a non
&gt;free version of QT.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Anyone managed to get AutoCAD running under a full emulator, like
&gt;VMWare&gt; or even bochs ?
&gt;
&gt;It does run under VMWare, although I can't test it thoroughly cause I 
&gt;don't know Autocad too well.

Following is a collation of stuff I sent off list to Steve..

have a look at pythoncad

looks simple(interface), scriptable etc

<A HREF="http://www.pythoncad.org/">http://www.pythoncad.org/</A>

(and learning Python is "a good thing "(TM))



Found this great link:
<A HREF="http://pfrostie.freeservers.com/cad-tastrafy/">http://pfrostie.freeservers.com/cad-tastrafy/</A>

(seems to have sorted out most of the chaff)

There is also this:

<A HREF="http://www.tech-edv.co.at/lunix/CAD.html">http://www.tech-edv.co.at/lunix/CAD.html</A>


I did a little digging around:
seems older versions of QCAD are still available :
(apt-get install qcad :)
or
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/qcad/">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/qcad/</A>

If you have the QT3 developers kit you can obtain the full source of
qcad from the main site: 
<A HREF="http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad_downloads.html">http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad_downloads.html</A>

A lot of bother I expect..^^^^


It seems Varkon and Cycas are still available as well:
I remember not being too impressed with  Varkon (though that ws about 18
months ago...)

<A HREF="http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/whatis.htm">http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/whatis.htm</A>

CYCAS IS really interesting and given enough resources (more than 300
mhz 128 ram IMHO) would be worth learning... 

<A HREF="http://www.cycas.de/">http://www.cycas.de/</A>


OCTREE
uses mouse gestures .. I used this for a one off thing ...
It was little quirky to learn .. but as I remember very flexible and
quite good. (free for non commercial use)


<A HREF="http://www.octree.de/">http://www.octree.de/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.octree.de/html/frames/eng/f_octree.htm">http://www.octree.de/html/frames/eng/f_octree.htm</A>
see the tutorial


The Blender idea is worth a think about .. I have had similar thoughts
just not enough of an itch to scratch (yet)..
(and skills time etc)

I also use DIA xfig and gschematic (electronics) (AKA GEDA )and xcircuit

...

For some reason I really like xfig but could not recommend it for real
CAD use. (It's Possible though ) I once did a 200 lantern Lighting
design on Xfig ... and took that show around the country with it ...
I was silly really... and the show was too.. why ? no idea now.

There are many others .. perhaps less developed but try starting from
here:

(hope this helps)
