&gt; I see. What's wrong with installing Linux - tell your sys admins that
&gt; you'll give them a ghost image of their windows and then tell them to
&gt; basically bugger off and forget about you after that? Most sys admins,
&gt; even the M$ ones would love to have users who specifically didn't want
&gt; their help.

(not these ones!)

it's not permanently my laptop (which is another reason not
to waste much time on it).  I did mention taking an image of
the disk and splatting it back when I give back the laptop.
The reply was along the lines of "we don't recommend it" and
"you have to return it in the same state you got it".

The problem is for straight work purposes it's win2000,
which is ok(ish) and I can jump and down when things don't
work until it's fixed.  But I want it for things like the
linux conf as well which is a mix of work and personal.
Another reason for getting my own is there's only one small(er)
and light(er) laptop available and it's not available at the
time of the conf.  The other ones are bigger and heavier,
don't have wireless and have a max battery life of 2.5 hrs.

Dave.
