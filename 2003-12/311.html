&gt; I see a bunch of building blocks cobbled together in different ways 
&gt; to achieve "cooler" outcomes, but no innovation.  In fact, the only time I 
&gt; ever see innovation is when I compare different ages in time.

I think this comes from hindsight only.  Innovation is when these 
building blocks are put together in unique ways that weren't obvious 
beforehand.

Afterward it's easy to dismiss because of course now it looks obvious or 
is taken for granted.  If you take your philosphy too far then nothing 
is innovation because it all builds on previous work - oh, going to the 
moon was just an engineering exercise, wasn't innovative.

You're also making the mistake that innovation has to happen in a single 
leap, in a short space of time, by a single person, whereas alot of 
innovation does take time with many people contributing - the Internet 
is an example.  Revolutionary because how it's changing society and 
communication around the world.  But not innovative at every microstep.

We should stop wasting time on discussion on belly button gazing about 
what's "innovative" or not and focus on bringing innovation, in little 
steps to the world local to us.  Bringing innovative ideas like how open 
source affects the poor and needy by making computing available to them.
