Hi Peter

There is a command line tool

lspci

that will tell you everything that is connected to the PCI bus and it
will tell you what Linux thinks your modem is.

Or you could try

<A HREF="http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz">http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz</A>

unpack the file and run it from a terminal. The text files it creates
will tell you 

1. What your modem is
2. Hopefully where to go to get a driver
3. What the driver is called

Let us know if you need anymore help.

&gt; Hi David,

&gt; Thank you for your prompt reply...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; (b) It's easy to get a real modem, I just need to shop around;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This is true. 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, that's a relief.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;You could also attempt to get them to bring in a Lucent
&gt; &gt;chipset modem. Ever visited:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * <A HREF="http://www.linmodems.org/">http://www.linmodems.org/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Not too helpful. That tells me how to work out what sort of modem I've
&gt; got.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Ask them for *anything* that is *not* a soft modem ;-) If they can't get you
&gt; &gt;one or won't, get a better supplier. It's not your job to do their job.
&gt; 
&gt; What I'm looking for is a list (however short) of modems which really
&gt; are hardware modems, and are available in Adelaide.
&gt; Asking the computer shop for a hardware modem isn't enough: as I
&gt; indicated in my first email, I asked them to replace a soft modem
&gt; (Conexant HSF) with a hardware modem and instead all I got was another
&gt; soft modem (Conexant HCF). 
&gt; 
&gt; Or alternatively, the name(s) of an Adelaide computer supplier who
&gt; knows what a real modem is.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I could get a better supplier, but if I deal through the
&gt; original shop, hopefully they'll refund me what I paid for the soft
&gt; modem.
