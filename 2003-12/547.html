&gt; &gt; same God as other Christians. However, If I were Christian,

Yes, he is clearly wrong on a couple of counts.

When people of all religions are playing the numbers game, they are quite 
prepared to be lumped in with all the various sects that their religion 
has splintered into, but when playing the 'holier than thou' game, they 
are less so.

The other count of course goes by the name of 'My ism is better than your 
ism because your ism has killed more people than my ism.' This too is 
wrong, because isms (or Relgions) don't kill people. People do.

Let's hope that the OS wars don't get so bad that someone decides to do 
something really drastic about it.
