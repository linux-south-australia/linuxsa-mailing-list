&gt;&gt;&gt;A group of politicians have kindly agreed to appear on a panel at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;Linux and Open Source in Government conference, to be held in Adelaide
&gt;&gt;&gt;in January.  I am canvassing ideas for questions to ask them.  What
&gt;&gt;&gt;would *you* ask a politician regarding Linux and Open Source if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;had the opportunity?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;What about something like;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  - What is the SA Government doing to support local businesses that
&gt;&gt;    employ programmers/designers etc to build and support Opensource
&gt;&gt;    software that is heavily used in Australia Business and Government?
&gt; 
&gt; So open source is just another "special interest" group asking for
&gt; a handout?

Ok, maybe I'm asking the wrong questions. I feel its important to
give feelback and as you have done, discuss it.

&gt; Personally, I don't want to see any of my taxes go into "supporting"
&gt; open source.  If the concept is right then it should be able to
&gt; stand on its own two feet.

Ok, on its merrits OpenSource can stand. But as the SA Government
has no interest in anything standing on its own merrits, a little
more prodding is required...

I think you missed the sublty of that question.

A lot of small industry groups hit the Government up for all
sorts of tax breaks and grants and what not. The games industry
in Australia is doing just that.

I the OpenSourceSoftware as a software development industry,
(just like any other research and development industry)
put pressure on the Government, in the same ways with the same
means, one would expect the same outcomes. Tax breaks, grants
and what not...

The SA Government is complaining that OpenSource will *kill* inovation.
Turn it around and say to the Government,
"Hey, we are a business, we want to inovate and we see the future in 
OSS, help..."

&gt; What I do have a problem with is that a lot of my taxes are going
&gt; to supporting Microsoft.  And I'll like to know what the pollies
&gt; are going to do about that.

Yes, that would be interesting. There were a couple of folks on the
Gold Coast building plugings for Mozilla and OO, but they ran out of
cash... =( they didn't meet the criteria for they traditional business
model so didn't get the research grants that other software development
types can get =(

  It would be nice if there were some official channels that
developers could try if they had good tech that could stand on its
own two feet ...

and I'm not talking about the dodgy venture capitail crap that
killed some many good business opportunities over the last
few years.

&gt; I also see a number of government laws and practices which discriminate
&gt; against open source software.  And I'd like to know what the pollies
&gt; are going to do about that.

=)

&gt; Some specific questions:
&gt; 
&gt;  - Copyright Act
&gt; 
&gt;    Why are the reverse engineering and circumvention provisions of
&gt;    the Copyright Act so narrow that there are doubts about the ability
&gt;    of games console owners to run whatever software they wish.

hmmm ... there be dragons.
I understand where you are comming from,
the ususal answers are all to do with piracy aviodance...

I'd love to run Linux on, say a PS2, which you can if you
buy the HDD and CD set with all the tools on. But I'm told
there are other ways and means without resorting to "chipping"
them, but I have not tried any of them...

(The PS2 has some nice vetor number crunching capabilities,
  how do you think a 200MHz PS2 beats a 700MHz XBox in FPS)

I am avioding the X-Box on all accounts.
We have Black (retail), green (debug-kits), clear(dev-kits)
here at work, and I let the developers loose on them,
and but haven't touched them myself. The NDA on these is
awful really ... which is why I want nothing to do with them.

As far as I'm aware all the *nasties* are to do with the reverse
engineering angle. Sony are now prividing *some* info on the
PS2 since the PS3 is just over the horizon, so that they can
keep a loyal following. They (Sony) are facing some fairly hefty
competition from the X-Box PR/Sales camp but real sales
competition from Nintendo =)

&gt;    Do you support the imprisonment of programmers which allow
&gt;    DVDs to be played in the wrong region.  If not, do you support
&gt;    the current Copyright Act clauses which have this penalty?

As far as I was aware there was an early ruling that clarified
this issue; it couldn't be enforced until there was wide scale
deployment of DVD content made specifally for our region at resonable
cost. I don't believe that has happened yet.
The other implications were that DVD players could not be locked to
our region either.

&gt;  - Acquisition
&gt; 
&gt;    How was the ATO permitted to develop an application computing
&gt;    architecture which locked them into one supplier?

Lack of clue? I have heard about Microsoft seminars. They allegedly
involes lots of alcahol.

&gt;    The SA govt promised regulation rather than legislation to ensure
&gt;    that open source alternatives are considering during acquisition.
&gt;    This acknowledges the inability of the Internet to take CEOs to
&gt;    lunch.  What is the current state of the proposed regulations?
&gt;    Why haven't the local AUUG and Linux groups been consulted to date?

Lack of clue? They asked the wrong consultants?

&gt;  - FTA
&gt; 
&gt;    Will the US-AU FTA bring DCMA-style legislation to Australia?

=(

&gt;    Does the FTA require Australia to acknowledge software patents?
&gt;    Does it require enforcement of US software patents?

It shouldn't, we have our own (lame) patent system, lots of the US
patents are registered in the international system, which we honour
i think. have to check that one out tho...

&gt;  - Patent
&gt; 
&gt;    Australia's Innovation Patents are the worst of all worlds.  They
&gt;    cost little, are applicable to software, and cost the same to
&gt;    object to as a standard patent.  Is this going to be fixed before
&gt;    we end up with a patent system which is even less functional for
&gt;    software than that in the USA?

IIRR, there is already an Australian Software patent for toasting bread =/

is that the kind of "function-less" patent system you refer to?

&gt;    Why are patents applicable to software anyway, when the possibility
&gt;    of re-invention is so high (three people independently "invented"
&gt;    the computer within years of each other, computer science literature
&gt;    abounds with re-invention of earlier forgotten work).  Why is
&gt;    "innovation" encouraged when "consistency" is often more important
&gt;    (imagine if car manufacturers "innovated" with steering, gear
&gt;    and brake controls).

They have. But they are all still "prototypes".
Rember SAABs joystick controlled cars in the early eighties?
Owned by GM now and they won't see the light of day again =(

Obviously business lobbies government to protect their interests...
why else?

cheers,

Kim
