&gt; Price strikes me as being the core reason for an agency which is
&gt; already running a set of software to go through the disruption of
&gt; changing to another set of software.
&gt; 
&gt; From our point of view there are other reasons.  But putting myself
&gt; in the shoes of a CIO at a gov't agency, I think price is the
&gt; main driver for a change.

I hope that price isn't the only lever, but now that you mention
it, a lot of that money can then be pumped back into pay people to
maintain the computers and networks, where there appears to be a
great lack of resources at the moment.

Friends of mine that work in various Gov departments always complain
about actual techs on the ground fixing problems. They rarely see
them, only when something (hardware) has actually failed or take
away tech and return with it later.
This kind of IT support face isn't probably very good for office
culture. But now coming to think about it, Unix techs are going
to ssh in, fix it and email you later... =P they are probably more
reclusive and less likely to show a face anyway =)

cheers,
