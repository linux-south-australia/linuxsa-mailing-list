&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So we start to see the begining of what SCO are up to.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They have always been complaining about ABIs in various
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;other free or opensourec unicies...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SCO clamin that these APIs were used without their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;permisson.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;My understanding is that an ABI or API cannot have a copyright placed over 
&gt;&gt;&gt;it, but that the text that expresses these ideas can.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If these APIs, specifically in Linux were derived from published
&gt;&gt;texts, is this still valid? (I don't know which is why I'm asking)
&gt;
&gt; The APIs were described in may open sources, especially standards docs 
&gt; where the idea was that they be implemented. 

Ok.

&gt; As for the ABIs, I guess it would depend on what an individual judge 
&gt; decides, however, I believe that most of the information was made public 
&gt; by parties like Intel as, I think Linux says.

What makes an ABI? how is it really different to an API in the case of
something like;

from "include/linux/stat.h";

#include &lt;asm/stat.h&gt;

#endif

#if defined(__KERNEL__) || !defined(__GLIBC__) || (__GLIBC__ &lt; 2)

#define S_IFMT  00170000
#define S_IFSOCK 0140000
#define S_IFLNK  0120000
#define S_IFREG  0100000
#define S_IFBLK  0060000
#define S_IFDIR  0040000
#define S_IFCHR  0020000
#define S_IFIFO  0010000
#define S_ISUID  0004000
#define S_ISGID  0002000
#define S_ISVTX  0001000

...

&gt;&gt;The reason I'm asking these questions, is that I'm considering a move
&gt;&gt;to either FreeBSD or NetBSD. I'm responsible for the deployment of
&gt;&gt;the servers at my work place and need to make an informed decision.
&gt; 
&gt; While I think that FreeBSD has a lot to say for it, the question you 
&gt; probably have to ask is how much support will you find out there for 
&gt; FreeBSD as apposed to Linux.

I have quite a bit of experience with FreeBSD.
I have no problems with supporing it for my employer.
Its more an issue of hardware support =) as always...

&gt;&gt;But the way I read that article, all of the Open Source BSDs are
&gt;&gt;also vulnerable to this claim... if not, why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Because of the agreement between AT&T/USL and UCB. I don't think SCO wants 
&gt; to open that can of worms, because I think it will show that all the code 
&gt; had been disclosed to sufficient people that any trade secrets etc had 
&gt; been lost.

Would the APIs/ABIs have not been made available early enough in the
Linux kernel to predate this court case?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Are SCOs claims actually fair?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I noticed you stayed away from this one =)
&gt; 
&gt; I just didn't notice it. I agree with Mark. I think Linus' response shows 
&gt; that SCO have stepped in it again.

=)

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
