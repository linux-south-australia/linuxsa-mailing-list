&gt;&gt;Here is an idea for a very ambitious project that I think the Open Source

&gt;&gt;So, the thing that I think needs fixing in the Open Source Software
&gt;&gt;movement is testing.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;I think most of the tools are out there already - certainly, there's
&gt;more Unit testing frameworks than you can poke a stick at.  I think
&gt;a large part of the problem is getting the developers into that
&gt;particular mindset.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think it will make life much easier for those wanting to adopt Open
&gt;&gt;Source software if they can point to a [large] battery of tests that the
&gt;&gt;software has survived, and creating such a framework and battery of tests
&gt;&gt;might well be, at this stage, the biggest single contribution people can
&gt;&gt;make to Open Source software.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
IMHO, I am very glad this topic has come up. :-)

 I am just brainstorming here, I don't have the solid experience that 
most you have...but I am interested in the topic...

Is it possible to get the user base to perform and report on the tests 
somehow....? Tap into the varied user base resourse....Maybe on the 
project web site have a template where software users would have the 
option of reporting back test data to the project....?   Maybe use a 
script....or test suite?

Or would that be too slow and tedious, or unreliable....?   Anyone with 
'war stories' to share?

Just a brainstorm. :-)
