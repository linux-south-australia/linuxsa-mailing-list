&gt; &gt;&gt;That's not even slightly innovative.
&gt; &gt; The GPL is not an innovative license? I think so.
&gt; 
&gt; That's not what you said.  You said, and I'm reading from the top line of
&gt; this message, "the ability to build on existing work _is_ the innovation."
&gt; People have been doing that since they invented the wheel.  Universities
&gt; work on that principle.  Even the patent system incorporates that principle,
&gt; although when you build upon a patented work you need to pay a licence fee
&gt; set by the patent owner.  There's absolutely nothing innovative about being
&gt; able to build on existing work.

I think that we can agree that a lot of open source software is not 
innovative, since it mainly re-implements ideas that others have already 
implemented, but does so in a more open fashion and allows people to build 
on the software in an incremental fashion and to ensure that the ideas 
expressed in the software are not lost because a company goes down the 
tubes or simply decides to withdraw that software from the market.

By the same token, a lot of what propietary software organizations produce 
is also not innovative. Much of the work is preceeded by University-based 
research that the propietary orgs are simply leveraging off of.
