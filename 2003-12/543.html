&lt;quote who="SAPOL"&gt;
&gt; Bush is actually a Southern Baptist which I guess means he believes in
&gt; the same God as other Christians. However, If I were Christian, I'd be
&gt; distinctly unnerved to be identified with a group of people who are
&gt; only a few short steps away from being just as fundamental as some of
&gt; the more fundamental Muslim sects.


Can you please identify the buildings that Southern Baptists have blown
up?  Or perhaps the suicide bombings that have been performed by it's
adherents?  What about aircraft hijackings, how many of those have been
done by "fundamental" Christans?

Perhaps instead of stereotyping large groups of people you most likely
know nothing about, let us just agree that violence and violent attacks
are wrong, and that most typically people who perform them are misguided
in their belief that any deity will be pleased, or that any group whose
causes they are promoting will be any better off by their actions.

Can we resume normal programming now?
