&gt; &gt; Why don't you ask tivo? How many have they sold to date?
&gt; 
&gt; Tivo is an excellent point.  It's *not* open source.  Yes, it does use
&gt; Linux but it also uses proprietary software, without which it isn't Tivo.

Series 1 Tivos had a lot of the application implemented in tcl (which
although not open source you could read), and used open source tcl
libraries. I think the later ones moved more to C++, though probably
more for speed reasons rather than obfuscation.

Interestingly the fact that people could read the tcl source and more
easily do modifications led to quite a significant community around
Tivo and I think increased its popularity. Whether that is significant
in number of sales I don't know, but for a product which isn't sold in
Australia, nor has any commercial support there seem to be quite a few
in this country :-)
