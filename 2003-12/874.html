Hi Rick.

Just trying to do a fake windows install.

I'll try what you said but I did use the tarball which you mention and the
same problem occurred. What is causing the segmentation fault? I did mention
not being able to load some libraries (I'll post the error message when i
next get a chance - having vid card issues right now) and I think that might
be the problem right there. I have no idea why this would be happening. At
first I thought it was distro but I've swapped distros and the problem
persists!

HELP!!

Hi Corey,

Are you tying to install a fake windows registry or a real one from an
existing Windows ?

Try backing-up & deleting the ~/.wine config directory.
Download the source tarball for the latest Wine-20031212.
Compile & install via './tools/wineinstall' in the Wine dir as usual.
See if it helps.


Cheers,
Rick

&gt; Well I've been buggering around with WINE and WINEX for a while now and
I've
&gt; had some success with getting games running. Always a good thing. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, now I want to get some of my non-game stuff working and so I
&gt; downloaded the latest binary for WINE and no matter what I did, the
registry
&gt; would not install citing a 'segmentation fault' as the cause. It gives a
&gt; different line number almost every time but still, the error remains the
&gt; same. So I downloaded the build version of WINE which I THINK worked for
me
&gt; (9/11/2003) and the same problem existed.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time I was running Red Hat 9 at the time with no modifications or
&gt; upgrades or kernel recompiles done on an AMD 2200, 512Mb RAM, GeForce4 Ti
&gt; 4800 SE, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What the...? Can anyone help in any way? I'd just like to know what's
going
&gt; wrong or whether this is a 'it'll be fixed in the next version' error.
