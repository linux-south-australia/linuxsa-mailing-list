 &gt;&gt; I was wondering if it was more useful getting an older release of,
 &gt;&gt; say, slackware or debian that was happy to install on 8MB of RAM.
 &gt;
 &gt; Probably. +8Mb of RAM is a more recent luxury than Linux itself, so I 
gather that, long before I first heard of Linux, people were actually 
installing on 8Mb.
 &gt; Putting on old versions also means putting on old quirks tho', so the 
task of patching old glitches is suddenly a lot more daunting.


all too true.

hmm, i'm just installing a daul p3 machine the doesnt boot from CD,
so i dragged out the trusty boot floppy set and i found a couple
of options that may be useful;

  nolangchooser
  bootkbd=qwerty/us
  video=vga16:off

without the 'langchooser' it used 4MB less memory instead of doing
the virtual framebuffer thing. which might be a handy option on
low memory installs...

but when it comes down to it, without a CDRom a portable/laptop
really needs a network connection in order to be functional.
i remember installing all 90 floppies for slackware only a few
years ago on a machine without a CDRom or network ... not fun,
but it worked.

 &gt;&gt; There is also the LFS option, but that really requires another
 &gt;&gt; machine to build packages for you ...
 &gt;
 &gt; But with only 8Mb (or even 4) and no CD-drive you'll probably need 
this other machine anyway.
 &gt; LFS scares me. It clearly points out all the things I don't know 
first thing about....  Later, when I've cut my teeth on less hairy stuff.


by modern standards i expect LFS leaves a bit to be desired,
but back in the bad old days, we would have killed for something
that was as tidy as LFS ... you should try MCC or an early slackware
if you want a pain in the brain... we mostly rolled our own.

 &gt;&gt; What is Gentoo like in this regard?
 &gt;
 &gt; I have still to try Gentoo.... (reaches for fire retardant blanket


me too ... given an infinite amount of time in any given day..

cheers,

Kim
