Richard et al,

&gt; I think that this is part of the power of the idea. However, an audit of
&gt; the test env used will be needed. Perhaps users would be better off
&gt; doing initial testing to look for bugs with final test runs being done
&gt; by someone like OSDL with the gear. 

Agreed. Maybe the users can test the test (if this makes sense). That is
to say, the test is still conducted by Trent (the trusted authority) but a
huge community of users have:

 1) tested the test
 2) verified the test

...hopefully lending more credibility to it.

&gt; portion of the test suite. If it is accompanied by some un-modifiable 
&gt; certificate of the suite of software that had on the machine under test,

It's highly difficult to distribute an unmodifiable piece of software
under an open source license (they've GOT the code). It is true that
modifying the source code might invalidate the results but this strikes me
as a good argument that other corporations might use to do just that...
