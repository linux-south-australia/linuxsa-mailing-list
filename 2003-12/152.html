&gt; EVERYONE IS TALKING about Windows clusters, Unix clusters and Linux 
&gt; cluster. But all we are saying, is that the 20 year-old architecture of 
&gt; clustered OpenVMS can teach these whippersnappers a thing or two.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; It seems that the financial advantage of Linux might be far less than 
&gt; people imagine especially if it accrues more than the average of 9.2 
&gt; hours of downtime used in the above calculations, but that's a story for 
&gt; another day.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Depending on the cluster configuration, the financial advantage of 
&gt; running OpenVMS was between $1.7 million and $6.8 million.

With 100% uptime over 5 years. More interesting details about that
(including physically moving the premises) in the original link.
 
&gt; Your mileage may vary of course and these figures are somewhat dated, 
&gt; but they do give cause for thought -- both in relation to the clusters 
&gt; mentioned here and how Linux might stack up against them. It seems 
&gt; reasonable to suggest that if Linux clusters are used in environments 
&gt; where downtime is expensive, then it would only take about 25 hours 
&gt; downtime per year before the cost advantage of using Linux might be 
&gt; completely negated.

What is seems to me is that they dont seem to take in to account the
cost of hiring a good admin or a team of them to do it properly with
redundancy at every stage! With figures upward of 1.7 million theres no
reason why they cant pay a team of coders to bring any piece of open
source code in to line. 

&gt; As to the cluster operated by our Dutch friends, if that operated in a 
&gt; commercial environment and had no downtime in five years, then compared 
&gt; to clusters from other manufacturers with their average downtime, the 
&gt; savings could easily exceed $10 million.

This is really strong argument for corps to fund programmers and admins
to write good code and design reliable systems!
