Open Source Business Network - SA

Today, 3 December, marks a new day in the South Australian open source
landscape. After many years of talk and no action, an Open Source Business
Network - SA is being formed.

My initial objectives for the OSBN-SA are to:

 * create a strong, business focussed industry cluster to support open
   source businesses and issues in South Australia

 * promote open source as a viable primary solution to businesses and
   individuals as well as an alternative solution for those who are
   currently using a non-open source solution

These objectives, aims and the means to achieve the objectives and aims
will be set by the participants of the industry cluster. I consider the
above two aims important and I am sure businesses in SA can think of many
more aims and projects to be involved in.

Therefore I am calling for all businesses who want to participate in this
exciting new venture and group to subscribe to the Open Source Business
Network - SA's general mailing list:
