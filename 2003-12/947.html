&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;SCO clamin that these APIs were used without their

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;My understanding is that an ABI or API cannot have a copyright 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;placed over 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it, but that the text that expresses these ideas can.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;If these APIs, specifically in Linux were derived from published
&gt; &gt;&gt;texts, is this still valid? (I don't know which is why I'm asking)
&gt; &gt; The APIs were described in may open sources, especially standards docs 
&gt; &gt; where the idea was that they be implemented. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As for the ABIs, I guess it would depend on what an individual judge 
&gt; &gt; decides, however, I believe that most of the information was made public 
&gt; &gt; by parties like Intel as, I think Linux says.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm finding that a lot of the files that SCO reference do not actually
&gt; have any copyright notices on them ...

I think Linus has handled many of those cases. He created them from 
scratch, and as Mark says, ideas and methods cannot have copyright placed 
over them, only the combination of words in a document can.

Moreover, you cannot copyright a list of numbers or words, and most of the 
content of include files are just that. Lists of numbers.

However, some of the macros etc are a little more, but Linus has dealt 
with that as I say.

&gt; and other files are specifically things like this;
&gt; 
&gt; /* $Id: solerrno.h,v 1.5 1996/04/25 06:13:32 davem Exp $
&gt;   * solerrno.h: Solaris error return codes for compatibility.
&gt;   *
&gt;   * Copyright (C) 1995 David S. Miller (<A HREF="mailto:davem@caip.rutgers.edu">davem@caip.rutgers.edu</A>)
&gt;   */
&gt; 
&gt; #ifndef _SPARC_SOLERRNO_H
&gt; #define _SPARC_SOLERRNO_H
&gt; 
&gt; #define SOL_EPERM          1     /* Required superuser access perms  */
&gt; #define SOL_ENOENT         2     /* File or directory does not exist */
&gt; #define SOL_ESRCH          3     /* Process did not exist            */
&gt; #define SOL_EINTR          4     /* System call was interrupted      */
&gt; #define SOL_EIO            5     /* An i/o error occurred            */
&gt; #define SOL_ENXIO          6     /* Device or Address does not exist */
&gt; #define SOL_E2BIG          7     /* Too many arguments were given    */
&gt; #define SOL_ENOEXEC        8     /* Header of executable was munged  */
&gt; #define SOL_EBADF          9     /* Bogus file number                */
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Is this what is defined as am ABI?
&gt; I assume this is used to run Solaris binaries on Linux?

In my mind an ABI is a specification that states what system calls will be 
used, what stack layouts will be used, what values and structures etc will 
be used and their precise layout etc, just as Mark said earlier.

The spec can have a copyright placed over them, as can the files that 
implement the various specs.

However, I think Linus is on good ground when he claims that the files in 
Linux are not derived from UNIX files, which is the claim being made.

&gt; Do SCO have the "copyright" and IP licence rights to Solaris?

Solaris most likely has multiple copyright notices on it, including the 
original AT&T/USL copyrights. However, Sun paid large sums of money a long 
time ago and recently for the rights to do what they want with that code, 
I believe.
