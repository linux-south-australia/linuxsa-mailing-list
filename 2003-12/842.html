&gt; I can feel a recursive contradiction coming on. 

This is what I mean 'recursive contradiction' a tangled web. If a facist
see's life as duty and strugle, maybe a Linux advocate see's their duty
of advocacy an ongoing struggle of what they see as right.

What each of us perceives as right.

2 Jehovahs witnesses came to the door last week a lady and her daughter.
My partner let the daughter speak her piece and said after to the lady
that we have our own beliefs and the lady was satisfied. She only wanted
us to think about God and nature. There was no pushing no 'Thou must'
etc. She thanked Kath for listening and left. We talked about it after
and felt more inclined to think of them favourably because they were
respectful of us. In a troubled time we would be more likely to remember
someone who'd been respectful to us then one who'd rudely pushed their
beliefs.

An AAPT salesman came to the door and was trying peddle his wares and
Kath had to shut the door on him because he wouldn't take 'no thanks'
for an answer.
