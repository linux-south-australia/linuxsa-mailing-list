&gt;
&gt; What true innovations have come out of open source in the past five years?

I'd say Python was pretty innovative, for a scripting language. Embedable, 
extendable, interesting data structures (like the dictionary type), some 
Lisp'isms (like lambda), etc...

Keith Packards work on X11 has been pretty innovative. Most recently the 
composite manager (with the Damage and Fixes extensions), this allows lots of 
funky effects and performance increases for X11 systems.

Recent work on the 2.6 linux kernel has been pretty innovative. I read an 
article which benchmarked various operations for scaleability, and the Linux 
kernel was O(1) for *all* of them. The FreeBSD kernel (for v 5.x) was also 
O(1) for most operations. Not sure how commercial systems compare because 
they would never be so forthcoming with their performance testing.

DCOP in KDE allows applications to expose functions that can be called by 
other clients or by a command line program. That's pretty cool. For example 
you can change the wallpaper with the command

dcop kdesktop KBackgroundIface setWallpaper &lt;filename&gt; 6

Recently the "captive" (and other) projects that run WinNT drivers under Linux 
(in userland I believe). You could also extend this to WINE, which maps API 
calls from win32 applications to Linux API's. 

Going older:

VNC (I'm just starting to play with that now)

X11 itself was developed at MIT and originally had an open source 
implementation didn't it?

 There's lots of "Oh, Neat!" things that I've seen since using Open Source 
software, not sure if they were because of OSS innovations or because I was 
unfamiliar to how cool Unix is.

Lots of these things are incremental and small things, but that's what 
innovation is really. Commercial companies make small things that would only 
be on a changelog in OSS, into huge deals and make them seem like "the best 
thing since sliced bread". 

Just look at the sorts of patents being granted now. Each one of those patents 
the respective companies believe is an "innovation" and worthy of a patent. 
For example, Microsofts "User is Typing" thing for MSN. That sort of thing 
would hardly get a mention in OSS because it's just a small hack - not worthy 
of being patent protected. 

Cheers,

Damien
