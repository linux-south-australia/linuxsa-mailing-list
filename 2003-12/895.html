Steve:
&gt;The essential question.
&gt; Q: Vi or Emacs ?
&gt; Any politician who gives a blank response to this one aint getting my
&gt; vote. I dont care what their preference is - I just want to see their
&gt; reaction.  If they put together any sort of coherent answer, then it
&gt; means that they really have done their homework.

So you goto an auto mechanic and have your car serviced and he advises that
you need to get new shock absorbers (read editor).   Most people would be
hard pressed to name a brand of shock absorbers (vi or emacs) but understand
the need for one to make the car ride smoothly.   I leave that to the
expert.   As far as know no SA poli has come from the IT industry.

Does the health minister know how-to perform neurosurgery?  I hope not.

What should a poli know (ICT wise)?  Try these:
. Computers are hardware that needs an OS
. Computer with OS can run applications such as office productivity, email
and specialist apps
. There is proprietary software and open source software (maybe?)
. Computers can be connected via a network
. Via a network connection a computer can connect to the internet (most
polis would not know the web and internet are not the same)
. Know what SPAM and Viruses are
. Know that Microsoft dominate the desktop
. Maybe know what Linux is
. Be able to send an email
. Be able to search on the web

I would be happy if all polis know the above (as a starting point).   It is
up to us (the industry/experts) to educate/advise polis.

Regards, Kym Farnik
