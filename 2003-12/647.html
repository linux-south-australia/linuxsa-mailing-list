Luke,

&gt; O moderator, where art thou?

Mailing lists, to a greater extent, moderate themselves. The real
moderator of this list hasn't intervened in this list for a long time and
in my opinion this is a good thing.

Nonetheless, you've been around long enough to know that there is a
structure within the list, and I daresay you'd be able to make some very
good guesses at who are "The Royals" and who are "The Plebs" and the
various other characters.

Now, unfortunately for many, "The Royals" on LinuxSA all seem to enjoy
talking about religious topics. This isn't the first religious topic by
far to fall into this mailing list. The religious topics can fall into the
most discussed and I still remember "The Virgin Mary Debate" [which was
actually about whether the December 31, 1999 was the end of the century or
not].

I reference:

I assure you that appealing to the moderator won't help. Too many of the
usual upholders of "the right and proper" are enjoying this rather
whimsical debate about extremism vs fundamentalism (to the extent where
they're sounding both themselves) for the moderator to do much without
upsetting a significant amount of people all at once.

Oh, but I hear you say, YOU do that all the time.

I'm not the moderator; I enjoy a stint as "Rebel Leader", although
sometimes I flunk and end up being "Rebel Without a Clue" at times. Let's
face it, I'm absolutely fabulous at it ;-) The debate, I agree, is highly
off topic and possibly quite silly but I think it's just about to replace
"The Virgin Mary" debate in the annals of LinuxSA history.

This can become "Saddam's Been Caught" war.
