&gt; &gt; Thinking about the first paragraph, about killing innovation:  I have
&gt; &gt; an idea for a product which I intend to develop.  It's going to cost
&gt; &gt; $250,000+ to develop, uses commodity PC hardware costing about $300
&gt; &gt; per unit to manufacture, will retail for about $500+, and I expect to
&gt; &gt; sell a million of them in the third year.  Would you be interested in
&gt; &gt; investing your money in this project?  If the device was GPLed would
&gt; &gt; you still be interested?  Do you think the GPL might worry investors?
&gt; 
&gt; Deciding to GPL the software may open up development opportunities you
&gt; wouldn't have if you decide to take the proprietary route. For example
&gt; you could incorporate code from other GPL software, reducing both the
&gt; development time and cost.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps the money upfront required would now be low enough that you
&gt; wouldn't need to get any external investors. Sure, you would most
&gt; likely get competitors sooner, but going the proprietary route won't
&gt; stop that either - but all of the profit would be yours instead of
&gt; mostly going to the investors.

Hmmm, I have to say that there are some unrealistic ideas here. Anyone 
coming up with a product these days is probably going to need 50 employees 
at least by the time they get to market. That costs a lot of money.

Secondly, they are going to need to use open source software somewhere 
just to defray their costs, and there are a lot of good open source tools 
for doing the basic things.

Not getting external investors is, IMO, pie in the sky.
