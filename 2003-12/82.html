Just putting another side to the YIPPEEKAIYAAAY !!! I didn't expect the 
DSL inquisition ;-) Sorry for whinging though.

Yes, BADSL is extremely reliable and has a static IP and no PPPoE. It is 
a brilliant service from a great ISP. It is competitively priced and 
this customer isn't churning any time soon. Internode also have some 
great unmetered services including a Debian mirror.

But 16G is a *lot* of data. Its hard not to be greedy when it comes to 
bandwidth. And its hard not to be envious of the guy next door getting 5 
times the cap for $5 less.

&gt; Now this is quite a silly argument if you ask me. Whilst there are
&gt; technical costs involved and those technical costs do provide a base
&gt; minimum amount, this is a market based pricing structure.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't believe that Internode provide good value for money then try
&gt; Telstra or iPrimus or Adam (or someone else) and Internode might
&gt; eventually adjust its pricing structure or work out why you don't find its
&gt; offerings attractive and make a deal that you do find attractive.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, rather than advertising Internode or attempting to guess what
&gt; message Internode or any other ISP is trying to tell its customers judged
&gt; on limited information, wouldn't it be better just to say to all
&gt; prospective purchasers of"broadband" Internet:
&gt; 
&gt;  "SHOP AROUND FOR THE BEST DEAL THAT SUITS *YOUR* NEEDS"
&gt;
