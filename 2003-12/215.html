&gt;&gt;&gt;That's an interesting answer, but I don't agree.  It's something that
&gt;&gt;&gt;academia has been using for hundreds of years.

&gt;
&gt;I have to agree with davidn here.
&gt; 
&gt;However, I also have to say that some people have been pushing the concept 
&gt;of ownership of ideas (IP and certain copyrights) a little too far over on 
&gt;the side of owners of late. There has to be a balance.
&gt;  
&gt;

Would it be that the way open development and open source allows a more 
interactive and cooperative development of ideas be the main benefit? If 
there are no true innovations, but really just incremental development 
(in both open and close source), would it be true that open source 
allows for more potential for more active scope of interaction and 
incremental developments, and so this is what gives the perception that 
open source is more innovative?

I would love to add to and improve Sun PatchPro. Over a year has passed 
without any significant PatchPro development.

Dale.
