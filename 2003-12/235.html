Here are some of my thoughts on the latest Open Letter from Mc Bride:

<A HREF="http://www.sco.com/copyright/">http://www.sco.com/copyright/</A>

This is a sorry excuse of an open letter, he doesn't ask the Open Source 
community for anything. Usually Open Letters are written because they 
actually have significant merit,making open communication the proper 
strategy for resolution. The more a recipient of an Open Letter is 
pressured into conforming to the wishes of the Open Letter writer, the 
more appropriate an Open Letter is. We see no real basis for complaint 
on Mc Bride's part to apply that pressure.

On the contrary, his letter does nothing of the sort; its a seek and 
destroy ranting, a baby crying while knocking the pieces off of a 
gameboard because he's going to loose.

This letter only convinces me that he is trying to pull another stunt to 
get a rise in stock price. If he drives up the price of his stock to 
make a quick sell to some suckers that actually believe that SCO has a 
case, even though Mc Bride is certain that he does not, there are 
grounds for securities fraud charges.

His points are irrelevant to SCO's complaint of stolen property, he 
complains @ the GPL which uses copyright law to enforce the conditions 
of use for software. He praises copyright law, the means by which the 
GPL has legal teeth.

Accepting and enforcing the GPL is the price of using the software 
supplied. Even more irrelevant are his baseless accusations of the 
intent and effects of software developers that use the GPL. He also 
disregards the fact that GPL software is sold every day as well as the 
fact that not all distributions are exactly the same, ergo, even in a 
completely gratis situation, there is enough of a unique different 
between distributions that the destruction of profitability he accuses 
the GPL of, is in fact, not the reality seen in the Open Source 
marketplace.

SCO's attempts to distract are not woth the Open Source community's 
time, and are about as sirious as I would take a WWE squabble.

Bandini is the word for fertilizer.
