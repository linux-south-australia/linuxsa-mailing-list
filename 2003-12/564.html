There is one catch with this. many folks how use ssh key often have
them on laptops. unfortunately laptop are often/occasionaly/rarely[1] 
stolen ...

There also needs to be a mechanism to revoke any/all ssh key access to
any/all servers/hosts that you rely on ssh to have access with and
mothball the account(s).

Also you may want to have the same kind of infrastructure to upload
the replacement ssh public keys and create new accounts etc...

I helped write a system such as this, but it was entirely in-house.
this seems to be missing on many/all opensource distributions ATM.

This probably fits into the quest of quality assurance tools that
Richard was talking about earlier.

cheers,

[1] mine was stolen, so i'm speaking with an open raw nerve here ...
