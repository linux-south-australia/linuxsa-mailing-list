&gt; Hmm, disagree with this; there's plenty of differences.  Read 
&gt; up on the specs at Apple.

No offence, there are plenty of differences, but the memory limit is the
big one from a _practical_ standpoint. Compared to PowerBooks, the early
iBooks were horribly knobbled with slow bus, processor, disk, video,
limited ports, etc, etc. Now, they're what? half a generation behind a
PB, and that's pretty good. Remember that the first Titanium PowerBooks
were about 400mhz or so G4. Today's minimum spec iBook is a 800mhz G4.

The PB still has a faster bus and cpu, larger L2 cache, etc. These are
not as dramatic differences as they used to be. You used to have the
option of 'acceptable' performance on a PowerBook, or 'crippled' on an
iBook. These days, the iBook has 'acceptable' and the PB has 'better'
performance.

Unless you really need the 'better' performance, screen resolution, or
your apps are going to run out of memory in 640MB, the iBook is the
practical choice. The case design is more robust, it's designed to take
the bash and crash of school kids (I know, we have 2 iBooks here, in
kids hands, they're hard to break - I wouldn't buy a PB for them, too
fragile) This is a portable computer, it's going to get dropped one day,
make sure it has a good chance of surviving...

Whatever you do, extend the AppleCare support to 3 years. Parts are
expensive for any laptop, and you are probably going to need some. We
recently had a DVD drive, Battery and a few keys on the one 2.5 Y.O.
iBook replaced under AppleCare - that's something like $700 + labour if
we had to pay. The battery alone costs more than AppleCare extension on
an iBook.

Michael
