&gt; Hi all.
&gt; A quick question, A friend is going to buy an X-box to use as file 
&gt; server
&gt; and other things.
&gt; My question is what is the best versions of linux to use, and or the
&gt; easist to install.
&gt; I am not asking where to get it chipped or other stupid questions.
&gt; Also does anybody have the isos of the version(s) of linux??

After years of bashing the Xbox (a computer as a console? with a hard 
drive? whaaaat?), I actually bought one last week, and they're actually 
pretty damn cool in terms of hacking, and all the various things 
'homebrew' applications available.  Initially I just bought it as I 
knew you could easily mod them through software exploits, and run 
applications to play all sorts of media (DivX, Xvid, mp3 etc) both from 
the local DVD drive and over the network via SMB; the original concept 
was that it was only going to be a 
DVD-player-that-plays-lots-of-files-over-the-network-too.  Not only 
does it do this, but far more :-)

There's various distro's out there, but all of them I've seen are dodgy 
as hell.  I've managed to boot a few distro's on mine - none have 
displayed video properly, but apparently there's issues with the 
framebuffer driver for the v1.4+ Xbox's.  They work if you're accessing 
the machine over the network, though.

Some are modifications of already established x86 distros (Xebian (!), 
Gentoo), others are Knoppix-style and boot off the CD media.  It's 
still an area that's very much under development, so don't expect 
anything too earth shattering.

BTW, an Xbox as a file server - hmm.  I mean, it'd work, but what's 
wrong with a Real File Server(tm)?  An Xbox isn't exactly the same as a 
PC, and there are disadvantages - if he's serious about the file 
server, for example, there's no way in heck he's going to get RAID, and 
seeing as anything working on the Xbox is a hack at best, reliability 
is a huge question.  Remember, they're not designed to do this.
