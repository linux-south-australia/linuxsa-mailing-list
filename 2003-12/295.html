&gt;&gt;If the the installers allowed for configuration, them man pages would be 
&gt;&gt;as useless as they really are.  Because in my experience, man pages only 
&gt;&gt;provide a clue as to how to use the program, and that is not much of the 
&gt;&gt;battle. The big battle is learning the configurations, and there are far 
&gt;&gt;too many applications to learn configurations for.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The very vast majority of unix programs have zero configuration:
&gt;Awk, grep, ls, cat and so on.  
&gt;
These are not the only useful programs I want to use...

&gt;Normally it would be servers that need configuring, such as Postgres, Sendmail and Lpd. 
&gt;
These are useful and a PITA to learn to configure.

&gt;However I gather that in this instance we're taking about the ugly, awkward, point-n-click type
&gt;of programs, the dvd players and so on.  
&gt;
Not exactly, just Unix in general. I actually really don't have a 
problem with DVD players now, if I follow the exact set of libraries I 
listed in a post I made @ a month ago, down to the version of each 
library, binary, etc.

&gt;These are exactly the programs that have the poorest documentation and which are hard to use because
&gt;of that lack.
&gt;  
&gt;
Ok, well we differ in that I think that even the classical Unix man 
pages are not very useful.

&gt;&gt;This brings me to the FreeBSD ports.   Take DVD playing for example.  If 
&gt;&gt;the port checked if /dev/dvd existed and asked the user if he would like 
&gt;&gt;to  add that symbolic link, then it would be alot easier.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That, along with the testing that was mentioned a few days back, would 
&gt;&gt;make Unix much easier to use and very viable.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;More like Microsoft; not easier to use.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;In general, programs should not require documention on use, but instead, 
&gt;&gt;the theory behind its use.  I envision a program setup utility that is 
&gt;&gt;simple for the end user to use. It asks the user questions and the user 
&gt;&gt;answers.  Tweaking broken installations should be considered an advanced 
&gt;&gt;issue.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I could not agree with this less.  The idea that programs shouldn't
&gt;require documentation on use is so close to the idea that programs
&gt;shouldn't require documentation at all that it scares me.  The idea that
&gt;configuration should be a simple question and answer scenario is naive,
&gt;
If the installer created /etc/*.conf files, what's the beef, you can 
still edit them.
You will still have the source code to automate the installation. What's 
there to loose
but making Unix easier for the novice. I don't see a point here.

&gt;and worse, smacks of the black box mentality that makes Microsoft hard
&gt;to use.  
&gt;
I was only able to use Samba because of SWAT, I was only able to learn 
FreeBSD because it had an installer...
are these existing tools "Microsoft Black Box" as well?

&gt;Those black boxes are based on, 'let us do the hard work,
&gt;you don't need to know,' which is ultimately untrue.  And when you do
&gt;need to know you discover that the black box is really a wall which you
&gt;cannot see beyond.
&gt;  
&gt;
My guess is that the wall comes as a result of the software being closed 
source.

&gt;I've been using unix for almost twenty years, and only had trouble
&gt;knowing how to use it (by which I mean programs that run on it) in the
&gt;last few.  All of the programs that I have problems with have deficient
&gt;documentation.  One of unix's major advantages over other operating
&gt;systems was an easy to use and consistent suite of documentation.
&gt;Thanks to the open source community, that advantage has been steadily
&gt;whittled away.
&gt;
The pace of development may be a part of that, but I'll take improved 
technology over documentation,
especially if the newer technology is intuitive. If its not intuitive, 
its a PITA.
