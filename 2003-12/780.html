&gt; Yeah, just bought a LiteOn for my 82yo Grandfather for Christmas.  I'm sure
&gt; he just wants it to copy games ... :-)
&gt;
&gt; [They're under $60 now WITH software so it barely matters if they last.  My
&gt; current one is a Benq which seems perfectly okay too].

I've just got myself a Liteon combo drive - CDRW plus DVD reader.  $115 from 
a local outlet, internet prices were under AU$100 but delivery would level 
the playing field.

Obviously I'm unable to say how long it would last but here's some insight 
into my choice.

Previous CDRW was by Sony.  I thought I'd get a good brand name to avoid 
problems.  Boy was I wrong.  The Sony took about 5 seconds to wake up 
whenever a CD was put in with the consequence that the kernel would report 
I/O errors.  Add to that, it wouldn't burn CDs at its claimed speed, had to 
de-rate it by a factor of 4.  

Two days ago I decided to go for something with DVD in it.  I understood the 
value of "raw" mode read and write from reading the various FAQs so I 
conducted several google searches with keywords like DVD, writer, and raw.  A 
huge number of hits were referenced to Liteon.  Eventually I followed a link 
to a site devoted to CDs (I recall that it had "cdfreaks" as part of its 
URL).  Liteon drives were well regarded by members of a forum on this site.  
Conclusion: Liteon, made in China, poor regard for IP, make drives which do 
raw I/O, just right for copying protected game CDs, nice and cheap, big hit 
with the kiddies!  Also, Liteon provide more frequent firmware upgrades than 
the "brand" names.

The full house DVD burners are around $250 to $300, the CDRWs around 
$60-$80. I settled on the Liteon LTC48161H.  As described above, its a combo 
thing with DVD reader, 48x24x48x16.  The cdfreaks site provided a link to a
very positive technical review of it. The DVD will come in handy for the next 
Debian distro, its up to 8 CDs last time I looked.
