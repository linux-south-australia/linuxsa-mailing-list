&gt; &gt; What about TeX?

&gt; A new typesetting system but not a new idea.  Even the idea of macros

That's just so wrong.

- The math formula language is used by all word processors
  (even if the syntax differs, the sementics are the same
  as Knuth developed).

- The whole concept of parametric computer fonts.

- The 'web' concept of source code as an essay.

And TeX totally solved a multiplicity of small problems
which previous systems had glossed over -- hyphenation,
line breaks, etc.


If you want something from the past five years, then grid
computing and supercomputing clusters spring to mind.  Sure
enough the ideas were around beforehand, but no one had
actually done the work (like saying, "wouldn't a fuel cell
car be great", and actually building one that works well).

&gt;From my own experience, all the early iSCSI implementations
were open source (ie, all the 'innovative' implementations).

And how about Perl's non-greedy regular expressions.  That
was an eye popper when it first appeared, but seems so
obvious now.

And timezone handling.  Everyone uses the open source
timezone information, and almost everyone uses the
open source timezone tools.

GNU configure.  So innovative that I know of at least
two reimplementations (to avoid copyleft).


Finally, I think you're coming from the wrong direction.

Economically, it's very bad to have a commodity product
with monopoly profits.  Profit is usually the return on
risk, but with a monopoly on a commodity product there
is no risk.  So the result is a simple wealth transfer.
The term "Microsoft tax" is a good summary of economist's
views.

US economists obviously have to temper their views
with thoughts of the benefits from employment, but
outside the US these considerations don't apply
[apart from firms which make products which complement
only the monopoly product (and MS works hard at
developing these, typically small consultancy firms).]

Open source leads to the competition for the commodity
product (or as usually expressed, the "commoditisation
of software").  The economic benefits of that for Australia
are obvious and plain.

The special pleading that commoditising the commodity
software market will limit innovation is bizaare.  Even
if somehow true the position is contradictory -- the
profits from Microsoft innovation go to Redmond and worsen
our balance of payments.  Those arguing for innovation
on economic grounds should be advocating less innovation
by Microsoft, not more.  Of course, since the
profits from open source are much more widely spread,
there is no economic downside from innovation in
open source software :-)
