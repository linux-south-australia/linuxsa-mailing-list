&gt; I'm disappointed that the best that's been put forward to my "challenge"
&gt; are academic offerings dating back well into the last century.  I'm not
&gt; awfully surprised; the open source community seems to be hell-bent on
&gt; immitation, and I might say also on beating Microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the point in open source if the best we can do is destroy products,
&gt; such as Photo Shop and Quicken, which are the results of large expenditure
&gt; in time and money?  Immitation is easy, but not a noble cause.

And I'm disappointed that these threads always end up as pissing
contests where the goal of the challenger is often just to prove who's
got the biggest penis!

Perhaps you're making the mistake of equating this list with the "open
source community" (whatever that means) when in reality it's merely a
loose collection of like minded people who share a common interest. That
interest may well be working with open source software but most if not
all are simply trying to learn to use and improve their linux skills
with the software they've got. Although some few on the list are
involved with the development of various aspects of open source
software, it is most likely to improve rather than to innovate.

However to answer your "challenge" take a look at
<A HREF="http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net">http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net</A> (begun in Jan' 2000) which has a new
and IMHO innovative approach to desktop themeing. Each theme component
can be combined with any other theme's components in any combination the
user wishes. What's so innovative about this you may ask? Well each
component also can have many variations and choices within it so that
the permutations of possible combinations increase exponentially. In
this manner I was able to add over 8000 desktop colour combinations to
my desktop in a mere 10kb tarball. You would ideally have to install it
to try it out to determine if this project meets your "innovation"
criteria, but I believe it does. Your opinion however may differ
completely from mine.

Perhaps you would be better served asking these questions on some
developers mailing lists where the concepts of developing new
technologies and software is the main interest and topic of the list?

Alex

P.S. I'll apologise now for any offence I've caused to anyone as no
doubt I'll get flamed for this post and I rarely bother replying to
flames.
