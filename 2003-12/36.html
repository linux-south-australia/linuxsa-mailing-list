&gt; &gt;&gt;Here is an idea for a very ambitious project that I think the Open Source

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;So, the thing that I think needs fixing in the Open Source Software
&gt; &gt;&gt;movement is testing.
&gt; IMHO, I am very glad this topic has come up. :-)
&gt; 
&gt;  I am just brainstorming here, I don't have the solid experience that 
&gt; most you have...but I am interested in the topic...
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to get the user base to perform and report on the tests 
&gt; somehow....? Tap into the varied user base resourse....Maybe on the 
&gt; project web site have a template where software users would have the 
&gt; option of reporting back test data to the project....?   Maybe use a 
&gt; script....or test suite?

I think that this is part of the power of the idea. However, an audit of 
the test env used will be needed. Perhaps users would be better off doing 
initial testing to look for bugs with final test runs being done by 
someone like OSDL with the gear. 

However, it might be possible to do something like SETI at home, with a 
dedicated bunch or 1,000, or 10,000, or 100,000 etc people loading the 
same software and partitioning the test set and each running a small 
portion of the test suite. If it is accompanied by some un-modifiable 
certificate of the suite of software that had on the machine under test, 
this could be a powerful way of testing.
