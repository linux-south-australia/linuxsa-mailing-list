&gt; This sounds more like Mussolini
&gt; 
&gt; I quote dictionary.com :
&gt;    1. often Fascism
&gt;          1. A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls, suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.
&gt;          2. A political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government.
&gt;    2. Oppressive, dictatorial control.
&gt; 

Some other highlights from Dictionary.com:

The principles of social equality and respect for the individual within
a community.  (Dictionary.com on 'Democracy') WTF ?  How about social
equality and respect for all, provided that they support the commercial
aims of the ruling elite, and with the exception of parts of that
community which are poor, black, hispanic, mexican, haitian, or
non-christian, unless they redeeem themselves through the excessive
consumption of approved goods and services, or achieve a level of said
redemption through military service in unrelated foreign countries,
provided that they accept that the reasons for such military are fully
and properly explained by the state-owned media, and for no other
reason. Yeah, I reckon that just about covers it.

An economic system in which the means of production and distribution are
privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate to the
accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market.
(Dictionary.com on 'Capitalism') Free Market .. Yesindeed ! Sounds like
a great idea .. my conscience is telling me to write out a check for
US$699 to SCO, so that they can properly reinvest that money into
product development, otherwise, how is any software ever going to be
written ?

A system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy
and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make
progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally
shared by the people. (Dictionary.com on 'Communism')  Note the clever,
but completely uneccessary insertion of key words such as
'authoritatian' and 'claiming to make'.

The biggest supplier of operating systems and
other software for IBM PC compatibles. Software products
include MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Windows NT,
Microsoft Access, LAN Manager, MS Client, SQL Server,
Open Data Base Connectivity (ODBC), MS Mail, and SNA
Server for Windows NT. (Dictionary.com on Microsoft)

American computer software designer and business executive who cofounded
Microsoft in 1975 and as chairman built it into one of the largest
computer software manufacturers in the world. (Dictionary.com on
you-know-who)

A trademark for an open-source version of the UNIX operating system.
(Dictionary.com on Linux) - Thats right, Linux is nothing more than a
piece of legal trivia, just a trademark, nothing more to see here, move
along please.

the leading supplier of Unix System windowing software.(Dictionary.com
on SCO) .. OK, its the tail end, and a little out of context, but I just
had to add that one in.

&gt; Lets talk about vi instead.

1. V.I.Virgin Islands.
2  volume indicator
(Dictionary.com on vi)
Dictionary.com gets a whole massive write up on emacs though.

Im starting to feel pretty comfortable with Dictionary.com after that
little investigation.  If my kids ever ask me 'Daddy .. what does XXXXX
mean ?", I know that we can gather as a family around the computer, and
go to Dictionary.com to find an acceptable answer, one which will
reinforce our groupthink family values, and dispel the devils of
alternative, non-conformist thinking from our comfortable middle class
home.
