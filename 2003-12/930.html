&gt; 
&gt; No we aren't.  Or if we are, it isn't what you're getting at.
&gt; 
&gt; Hint:  SCO complained about ABIs.  Your post mentions this, then goes
&gt; off on a tangent about APIs.  ABI != API.

OK, after reviewing the letter again, I see you are right. At first I 
thought SCO had confused ABIs and APIs as well, but I see they make a 
distinction between them.

My earlier remark about APIs and ABIs then is off the mark. I guess also 
that the specification document itself can be copyrighted. However, the 
concepts inside them can't, and if the Linux community can show that the 
concepts were implemented from scratch, I believe that SCO are wrong.

&gt; APIs are the documented programming interfaces used to write applications;
&gt; The stuff that shows up in sections 2 and 3 of the manpages.
&gt; 
&gt; ABIs are different;  They're the combination of executable file formats,
&gt; system call invocation methodology, stack frame layout, VM map layout,
&gt; register conventions, manifest constant values, and other things which
&gt; enable an OS to run a binary executable.
&gt; 
&gt; The POSIX spec describes an API.  ABIs are things like COFF, IBCS2, etc.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Are SCOs claims actually fair?
&gt;  
&gt; Nope.

&gt; 
&gt; Summary:  Linus claims he personally wrote the files they're complaining
&gt; about.

I think Linus has shown that SCO are wrong again :-)

&gt;  &gt; It seems SCO is trying to kill *all* open source
&gt;  &gt; or free Unicies... =/
&gt; 
&gt; That's a bit of a stretch.  It looks to me like they're trying to raise
&gt; capital, and IBM, Linux, and fortune-1000 customers are merely classed
&gt; as collateral damage.

I agree with that ...
