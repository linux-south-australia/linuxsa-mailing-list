Okay, I misunderstood.  There doesn't seem to have been a lot of
innovation coming from the open source community.  If GPL is intended
to increase innovation it's doing a less than excellent job of it.


&gt; Flying machines copy birds and apply aerodynamics etc.

No they don't.  Flying machines have fixed wings.

&gt; Electronic mail uses a new medium to implement snail mail.

Fax implements snail mail using a new medium.  Electronic mail is a
very different idea altogether.  I'm yet to see a device act on a snail
mail letter, yet there are many devices (programs) that act on (not just
produce, but take instructions from) email.


&gt; WIMP copies the desktop. 

No it doesn't.  That's just silly.


&gt; Printed circuits are an improvement on wiring,

It's the printing which is innovative.

&gt; Quicksort is a development on stone swapping. Arabic numbers are an
&gt; expansion on fingers.

You're joking now, I'm sure of it.
