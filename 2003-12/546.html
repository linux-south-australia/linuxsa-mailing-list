&gt; Can you please identify the buildings that Southern Baptists have blown
&gt; up?  Or perhaps the suicide bombings that have been performed by it's
&gt; adherents?  What about aircraft hijackings, how many of those have been
&gt; done by "fundamental" Christans?

'Fundamentalism' is defined by philosophies, not by actions. There are
plenty of non-violent fundamentalist religious groups. That's why calling
the Taliban 'fundamentalists' doesn't accurately describe them, for example.
'Violent fundamentalists' are different to 'non-violent fundamentalists'.
And when I talk about Southern Baptists, I'm referring to their philosophies
publically expounded, not the people themselves or even the religion in
terms of the bible. I'm talking about what they've actually said. So please
don't try to turn this into a personal attack of the people or Christians in
general.

&gt; Perhaps instead of stereotyping large groups of people you most likely
&gt; know nothing about, let us just agree that violence and violent attacks
&gt; are wrong, and that most typically people who perform them are misguided
&gt; in their belief that any deity will be pleased, or that any group whose
&gt; causes they are promoting will be any better off by their actions.

No argument there.

&lt;quote who="SAPOL"&gt;
&gt; Bush is actually a Southern Baptist which I guess means he believes in
&gt; the same God as other Christians. However, If I were Christian, I'd be
&gt; distinctly unnerved to be identified with a group of people who are
&gt; only a few short steps away from being just as fundamental as some of
&gt; the more fundamental Muslim sects.

Can we resume normal programming now?
