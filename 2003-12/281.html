&gt; If the the installers allowed for configuration, them man pages would be 
&gt; as useless as they really are.  Because in my experience, man pages only 
&gt; provide a clue as to how to use the program, and that is not much of the 
&gt; battle. The big battle is learning the configurations, and there are far 
&gt; too many applications to learn configurations for.

The very vast majority of unix programs have zero configuration:
Awk, grep, ls, cat and so on.  Normally it would be servers that need
configuring, such as Postgres, Sendmail and Lpd.  However I gather that
in this instance we're taking about the ugly, awkward, point-n-click type
of programs, the dvd players and so on.  These are exactly the programs
that have the poorest documentation and which are hard to use because
of that lack.


&gt; This brings me to the FreeBSD ports.   Take DVD playing for example.  If 
&gt; the port checked if /dev/dvd existed and asked the user if he would like 
&gt; to  add that symbolic link, then it would be alot easier.
&gt;
&gt; That, along with the testing that was mentioned a few days back, would 
&gt; make Unix much easier to use and very viable.

More like Microsoft; not easier to use.


&gt; In general, programs should not require documention on use, but instead, 
&gt; the theory behind its use.  I envision a program setup utility that is 
&gt; simple for the end user to use. It asks the user questions and the user 
&gt; answers.  Tweaking broken installations should be considered an advanced 
&gt; issue.

I could not agree with this less.  The idea that programs shouldn't
require documentation on use is so close to the idea that programs
shouldn't require documentation at all that it scares me.  The idea that
configuration should be a simple question and answer scenario is naive,
and worse, smacks of the black box mentality that makes Microsoft hard
to use.  Those black boxes are based on, 'let us do the hard work,
you don't need to know,' which is ultimately untrue.  And when you do
need to know you discover that the black box is really a wall which you
cannot see beyond.

I've been using unix for almost twenty years, and only had trouble
knowing how to use it (by which I mean programs that run on it) in the
last few.  All of the programs that I have problems with have deficient
documentation.  One of unix's major advantages over other operating
systems was an easy to use and consistent suite of documentation.
Thanks to the open source community, that advantage has been steadily
whittled away.
