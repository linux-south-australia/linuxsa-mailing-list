&gt; The APIs were described in may open sources, especially standards docs 
&gt; where the idea was that they be implemented. 
&gt; 
&gt; As for the ABIs, I guess it would depend on what an individual judge 
&gt; decides, however, I believe that most of the information was made public 
&gt; by parties like Intel as, I think Linux says.

And even if it weren't remember that most copyright legislation
has "interoperation" clauses.  That is, if you need that magic
sequence of numbers to interoperate, then that magic sequence
isn't subject to copyright.  An example would be the values of
errno.h.

You'll find most of the case law about this is to do with
car parts.



BTW, I think this shows the value of good program documentation.
Imagine how much less trouble there would be is someone had
simply acknowledged the work upon which they had based their code:

   /*
    * List of error values from "MIX Application Binary Interface",
    * Knuth Corp, USA, 1961.
    */

It's also a bloody good argument for not purging old CVS info.
Something I'm deeply guilty of.
