Innovation is different things to different people.  Myself, I haven't 
seen much innovation in my lifetime if I really think about it (not just 
IT).  I see a bunch of building blocks cobbled together in different ways 
to achieve "cooler" outcomes, but no innovation.  In fact, the only time I 
ever see innovation is when I compare different ages in time.

David, you mentioned that that annoying little Clippy thing that Microsoft 
decided to inflict on their users was innovative.  What makes you think 
so?  I think you alluded to it being something that had an idea of what 
the user was doing.  I've been doing that for years and just like that 
Clippy thingy, I'm wrong sometimes (perhaps even a lot of the time just 
like that Clippy thing).  So, where's the innovation?
