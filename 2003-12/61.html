&gt; &gt; Many of these tests are automatable, and the goal would be to automate 
&gt; &gt; them all.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; However, running these kinds of tests requires several things:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 1. Hardware. Sometimes lots of hardware. Individuals might not be able
&gt; &gt;    afford the required hardware, but organizations like OSDL might.

I want to comment on what Chris has said below, but I also wanted to 
amplify on some of these points.

I envision that one of the most important results from a project like this 
is the growing test suite and the database of test results showing things 
like the tests performed on what range of versions of what collection of 
software. Organizations will be able to do significant risk management if 
they have access to such info, and they do not have it today.

In addition, the cost of hardware pales into insignificance compared to 
the cost of developing the actual test suite(s). Medium and large sized 
organizations can put together an Extreme Blackdiamond or two and a bunch 
of servers and clients in order to do their own testing, but they would 
find it very hard to justify the cost of creating the test suite(s) from 
scratch.
 
&gt; &gt; 2. Tests. In order to test, you need tests, pure and simple.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3. A testing framework that allows the tests to be run in an automated 
&gt; &gt;    fashion, and which allows logs of passed, failed, not run, etc tests
&gt; &gt;    to be kept, perhaps in a database, and that allows new tests to be
&gt; &gt;    easily developed and contributed. It should also allow large tests
&gt; &gt;    to be developed. That is, tests that require more than one client
&gt; &gt;    and perhaps even, more than one machine under test.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, the thing that I think needs fixing in the Open Source Software 
&gt; &gt; movement is testing.

I also wanted to comment on Glen's suggestion that running the tests in a 
distributed fashion is not useful, and that automated bug reporting is 
more useful:

1. I envision that in the end there will be millions of test cases for 
some of these suites, and that they will need to be run across multiple 
collections of versions of the software.

2. Automated bug reporting is not enought. The software collections that 
developers are working on are quite complex, and their interactions can be 
quite complex as well. We need conformance tests and regression tests to 
ensure that the bugs have actully been fixed.

&gt; Having spent the last few years mostly working on testing I too have
&gt; been thinking about this for a while. A lot of projects are building
&gt; their own autobuilders and regression testers and I think there is
&gt; room for a generic framework to help support this.
&gt; 
&gt; Autobuilders are important - the project I work on formally supports 6
&gt; architectures with more on the way and just getting people access to
&gt; all of the various machines can be difficult. We now do automated
&gt; nightly builds and this has been really good at picking up arch
&gt; specific problems quickly. We also have started building regression
&gt; tests in (regression tests for tests!)

They are very important, as they give you early warning of the existence 
of problems.

&gt; I also use a variant of the autobuilder to make releases packages -
&gt; manually building on lots of different machines everytime we wanted to
&gt; do a release was starting to take up a significant amount of time.
&gt; 
&gt; Automation of tests is very important. If they're not run
&gt; automatically they tend to not get run at all - eg I've had a quick
&gt; look at the state of POSIX compliance for 2.6 and its not particularly
&gt; pretty.

Indeed.

&gt; &gt; DejaGNU seems to have a good start for a testing framework. See:
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/dejagnu/dejagnu.html">http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/dejagnu/dejagnu.html</A>#SEC_Top
&gt; 
&gt; Other options are TET (used for UNIX and LSB certification testing -
&gt; <A HREF="http://tetworks.opengroup.org">http://tetworks.opengroup.org</A>) and QMTest
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest">http://www.codesourcery.com/qm/qmtest</A> which the libstdc++ people have
&gt; been looking at moving to (currently they use DejaGNU).
&gt; 
&gt; One thing that you do want out of a testing framework is for it to be
&gt; POSIX conforming (1003.3). One aspect of this is that it does more
&gt; than just return pass/fail, but has finer grained classifications such
&gt; as being unable to initiate the test, or the test failed in an
&gt; unexpected manner. 

Yes. I am annoyed at the state of our internal test framework because it 
cannot tell us that test xyz was not run because it is not implemented 
yet, and test abc was not run because it could not allocate the resources 
needed.

The first of these allows us to much better the test set production. One 
person can identify the need for a test, while someone else can then 
produce the test. In addition, many people have the desire to contribute 
and can actually contribute tests if they know what they have to produce, 
but often they don't know what is needed.

The second allows an organization to say, hmmm, we want a higher level of 
confidence, and we can see that these 10 tests that are important to us 
have not been run because of a lack of equipment, so lets assemble the 
equipment and run those tests.

&gt; Another important property is that it produces the results in machine
&gt; parseable format. This makes it *much* easier to detect regressions
&gt; and compare results between different test runs over time or different
&gt; machines.

Very true. In addition, everything should be logged in a database 
somewhere with lots of attributes about what was tested. The whole 
collection of software versions that were tested and the versions of the 
tests run.

&gt; &gt; I think it will make life much easier for those wanting to adopt Open 
&gt; &gt; Source software if they can point to a [large] battery of tests that the 
&gt; &gt; software has survived, and creating such a framework and battery of tests 
&gt; &gt; might well be, at this stage, the biggest single contribution people can 
&gt; &gt; make to Open Source software.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed. Its just a part of open source software development that is
&gt; really hard to attract people to work on.

However, if we can partition the problem and provide a good (and 
extensible framework), I think that we can get a lot done.

I think that we can get a good handle on this at LCA2004.
