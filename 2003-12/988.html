Microsoft format breakage :-)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Whats wrong with saugov? Its a moderatley sized Exchange 5.5
&gt;&gt; Cluster running on NT 4.0, which tends to get hit with every major
&gt;&gt; virus outbreak. That's whats wrong with saugov.sa.gov.au
&gt;
&gt; What would be wrong with ...@department.sa.gov.au?
&gt;
&gt; I have lost count of the number of people who have said "huh?...what
&gt; a stupid email address, it repeats itself" when I've given mine out
&gt; over the phone.
&gt;
&gt; As for the Exchange cluster, I've also lost count of the number of
&gt; "SERVER#X is going down for reboot" messages that I've received
&gt; recently.
&gt;
&gt; PS They're actually in the process "upgrading" the NT4 boxes to a
&gt; much more stable mail platform...Windows 200x, now I can sleep at
&gt; nights ;P

I've been busy living a Real Life over the last few days, and I don't
think anybody would thank me for reviving this thread, but:

As most of you know, the "Linux and Open Source in Government"
conference, which we have given the less obvious name "OCGCONF" (Open
Computing in Government) will be happening next month.  We're still
looking for a second panel session.  This sounds like a good topic:

 - Microsoft has a proven track record of broken mail implementations.
 - Mail is important to just about everybody.
 - Open source alternatives are available, and they work well.

I'm not going to mention the L word here, though there's no reason not
to do so on the panel: many open source implementations, such as
sendmail, run on other platforms.  That could be one point to discuss.
Another might be the unfortunate mail addresses that SA government
people have, and why they were necessary.

My question: can we get some interesting people together to talk on
the subject?  Some of the people on this list would be a good start,
but I don't want anybody to get into trouble.  On the other hand,
getting both them (you?) and some of the SA government policy makers
together to discuss the matter could be interesting, and it might also
have the positive outcome that the system could be greatly improved
and money saved.
