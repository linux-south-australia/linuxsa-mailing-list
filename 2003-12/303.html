&gt;&gt; Normally it would be servers that need configuring, such as Postgres,

&gt; These are useful and a PITA to learn to configure.

That's odd, because sendmail, postgres and lpd are all so well documented
that they are easy to configure.  That's assuming you read documentation,
but I suspect that when you say, "easy", you mean, "can be used without
documentation."  I've already stated my opposition to that principle.


&gt; If the installer created /etc/*.conf files, what's the beef, you can 
&gt; still edit them.
&gt; You will still have the source code to automate the installation. What's 
&gt; there to loose
&gt; but making Unix easier for the novice. I don't see a point here.

I don't object to whizzy installers, I object to sub-standard, or even
missing, documentation.  I have no objection to a programming coming
with no installer, but I do object to it coming with no documentation.


&gt;&gt; Those black boxes are based on, 'let us do the hard work,
&gt;&gt; you don't need to know,' which is ultimately untrue.  And when you do
&gt;&gt; need to know you discover that the black box is really a wall which you
&gt;&gt; cannot see beyond.
&gt; My guess is that the wall comes as a result of the software being closed 
&gt; source.

When you first, last and only view of configuration comes from a configure
program, and allowing that they generally only provide access to the
'commonly used options,' then you conclude that if you can't set it using
the wizard it can't be done.  There's a wealth of power under the hood,
but you don't get to use it if you don't lift the bonnet.
