&gt; &gt;&gt;So we start to see the begining of what SCO are up to.
&gt; &gt;&gt;They have always been complaining about ABIs in various
&gt; &gt;&gt;other free or opensourec unicies...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;SCO clamin that these APIs were used without their
&gt; &gt;&gt;permisson.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My understanding is that an ABI or API cannot have a copyright placed over 
&gt; &gt; it, but that the text that expresses these ideas can.
&gt; 
&gt; If these APIs, specifically in Linux were derived from published
&gt; texts, is this still valid? (I don't know which is why I'm asking)

The APIs were described in may open sources, especially standards docs 
where the idea was that they be implemented. 

As for the ABIs, I guess it would depend on what an individual judge 
decides, however, I believe that most of the information was made public 
by parties like Intel as, I think Linux says.
 
&gt; &gt; If you look at the Groklaw comments you will see that it seems that many 
&gt; &gt; of these fragments came over from *BSD before the agreement between 
&gt; &gt; AT&T/USL and UCB etc was signed ...

Actually, I now think these comments were on the LWN site.
 
&gt; The reason I'm asking these questions, is that I'm considering a move
&gt; to either FreeBSD or NetBSD. I'm responsible for the deployment of
&gt; the servers at my work place and need to make an informed decision.

While I think that FreeBSD has a lot to say for it, the question you 
probably have to ask is how much support will you find out there for 
FreeBSD as apposed to Linux.

&gt; But the way I read that article, all of the Open Source BSDs are
&gt; also vulnerable to this claim... if not, why not?

Because of the agreement between AT&T/USL and UCB. I don't think SCO wants 
to open that can of worms, because I think it will show that all the code 
had been disclosed to sufficient people that any trade secrets etc had 
been lost.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Are SCOs claims actually fair?
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed you stayed away from this one =)

I just didn't notice it. I agree with Mark. I think Linus' response shows 
that SCO have stepped in it again.
