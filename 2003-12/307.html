&gt;&gt;&gt;That's not even slightly innovative.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The GPL is not an innovative license? I think so.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;That's not what you said.  You said, and I'm reading from the top line of
&gt;this message, "the ability to build on existing work _is_ the innovation."
&gt;People have been doing that since they invented the wheel.  Universities
&gt;work on that principle.  Even the patent system incorporates that principle,
&gt;although when you build upon a patented work you need to pay a licence fee
&gt;set by the patent owner.  There's absolutely nothing innovative about being
&gt;able to build on existing work.
&gt;  
&gt;

Could it be that being able to build on, from and with other work more 
easily is what makes Open Source potentially (seem) more innovative, 
with a potentially larger scope of creative input? This might not always 
be the case, nor are there often the large kinds of funding that promote 
individuals to be potentially more innovative (think MS's development 
budget). The developments would more or less be incremental steps rather 
than "Eureka" style discoveries (the same as with closed source).

Innovation seems to be a perception when comparing the initial state of 
a problem, to the final state, while ignoring all the steps inbetween. 
Larry Wall's talk on Post-Modernism seems to touch on this, at least 
indirectly.

Can anyone thing of something (anything) that is dramatically innovative 
at all with regards to anything?

Dale.
