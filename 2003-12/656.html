I am trying to push this discussion to where it belongs, so this will be 
the last cross-posting to linuxsa.

&gt; &gt;Attached is the Community Testing of Linux FixIT proposal I have submitted

&gt; &gt;
&gt; This is a very important topic IMHO, so, I thought I should try to share 
&gt; what little tangent knowledge I may be able to contribute.  Its 
&gt; accounting speak,  but I think it applies.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope it doesn't come accross too abrupt or off topic. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; In a sense, there is a similarity between what I imagine Community 
&gt; testing of Linux to be and the tests I perform during an audit. In both 
&gt; situations, the goal is to test the system to see if it is working 
properly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;THE PROJECT
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This project will develop a testing framework 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The accounting industry follows a conceptual framework that
&gt; could be used as a starting point and eventually tweaked for the project.
&gt; 
&gt; For example, the FASB's "Qualitative Characteristics of accounting
&gt; Information" describes the qualities and characteristics that accounting
&gt; information should have for it to be useful. My guess is that the
&gt; project will need a guideline like that.

One of my goals is to leverage all other accumulated experience from 
whatever fields are available. To that end, I will read the PDF James 
refers to so I can glean best practices and other ideas.

I also plan to respond to the other points made.

There is, however, one thing I think we need to remember. The accounting 
industry _seems_ to be highly labor intensive, and I think we need to make 
it possible for people to run tests and submit results easily.

However, there is no doubt that developing the test suites will involve 
labor, and my hope here is that we can leverage the desire of many people 
who can code (even a little) to specify and code at least initial tests, 
and have these tests and scripts work their way up to being accepted 
through a process of review.
