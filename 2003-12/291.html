Hi all,

I have an exceptionally frustrating problem with some file locking that 
I've been banging my head against for a while and just can't quite figure 
out.

Firstly, let me explain the actual setup...

We have a big raid in our computer room used to store a number of home 
directories.  This raid is served by a Legato Automated Availability 
Manager Cluster on Solaris and the shares are served via NFS to the samba 
server (which is a Red Hat 9 install).  Then, our users access their home 
directories from (generally) Windows XP and their favourite apps).

To be completely honest, I'm not 100% certain where the locking is 
happening, but every once in a while, an Adobe product file will get 
locked and the user will need to rename the file to save it.  They can't 
delete the original file and obviously this can get really annoying for 
the poor user that has just spent half an hour working on it.  When they 
look at the properties for the file from Windows, it's "Read Only", but 
they can't change it to not being "Read Only".

Next up, I don't understand what the difference is between Adobe files and 
other types of binary files when it comes to file locking.  But, I have 
certainly narrowed it down to a problem with the Adobe file formats, .psd 
and .ai .  

If anyone has any suggestions on where to look to diagnose this problem I 
would really appreciate it.  If you need more information, I'll do my best 
to get it to you.  If you have enough information to recommend possible 
fixes, well even better.

TIA
