&gt;&gt; &gt; So we start to see the begining of what SCO are up to.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;No we aren't.  Or if we are, it isn't what you're getting at.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hint:  SCO complained about ABIs.  Your post mentions this, then goes
&gt;&gt;off on a tangent about APIs.  ABI != API.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, after reviewing the letter again, I see you are right. At first I 
&gt; thought SCO had confused ABIs and APIs as well, but I see they make a 
&gt; distinction between them.

I think they failed to use that assertion previously in the court...

&gt; My earlier remark about APIs and ABIs then is off the mark. I guess also 
&gt; that the specification document itself can be copyrighted. However, the 
&gt; concepts inside them can't, and if the Linux community can show that the 
&gt; concepts were implemented from scratch, I believe that SCO are wrong.

That was the whole point of Linux. It was the reasearch project by Linus
to do new things =) Thankfully many of those new things work well =P

&gt;&gt;APIs are the documented programming interfaces used to write applications;
&gt;&gt;The stuff that shows up in sections 2 and 3 of the manpages.

Would this have been the major source of early Linux kernel programmers
information about UNIX? Novell now claims full copyright on this =)

&gt;&gt;ABIs are different;  They're the combination of executable file formats,
&gt;&gt;system call invocation methodology, stack frame layout, VM map layout,
&gt;&gt;register conventions, manifest constant values, and other things which
&gt;&gt;enable an OS to run a binary executable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The POSIX spec describes an API.  ABIs are things like COFF, IBCS2, etc.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are SCOs claims actually fair? 
&gt;&gt;Nope. 
&gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story</A>=20031222174158852 

Well thats good news. I hope that the courts also see clearly without
the FUD fog that SCO is pumping out.

&gt;&gt;Summary:  Linus claims he personally wrote the files they're complaining
&gt;&gt;about.
&gt;
&gt; I think Linus has shown that SCO are wrong again :-)

I hope so.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It seems SCO is trying to kill *all* open source
&gt;&gt; &gt; or free Unicies... =/
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's a bit of a stretch.  It looks to me like they're trying to raise
&gt;&gt;capital, and IBM, Linux, and fortune-1000 customers are merely classed
&gt;&gt;as collateral damage.

I'm concenred that 'other' OSS Unices will be next, as people
are expect to move away from Linux in 'droves'. SCO seems to
be expecting to topple Linux before too long ... then what
will their next source of income be?

&gt; I agree with that ...

They seem to want to damage themselves more than anything.
Various posts on SCO litigation related groups report
lack of confidence in the stock market over the last couple
of weeks. I don't know how the stock market works, but by
all accounts, a lack of confidence from large investors
routing by selling volumes of shares does not sound good
to me.

hmmmm ... so much nasty stuff right before christa mas...

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
