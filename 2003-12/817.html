&gt; A group of politicians have kindly agreed to appear on a panel at the
&gt; Linux and Open Source in Government conference, to be held in Adelaide
&gt; in January.  I am canvassing ideas for questions to ask them.  What
&gt; would *you* ask a politician regarding Linux and Open Source if you
&gt; had the opportunity?

---------------
1) Requirements Specs

I think that the biggest problem with software in Govt is the
requirements specification.

Too many requirements specs are tailored towards 1 particular vendor's
locked in product 'ie - The system shall USE feature XXX of Microsoft
Exchange' .. this is not a requirement, this is an advert for a product.

The requirements specification process happens behind closed doors, and
is then submitted for psuedo-public tender to find an acceptable bid.

Commercial organisations are even worse at this, and they end up paying
through the nose as a result of their actions.

If the initial design and requirements gathering processes were open to
the development community, then it may result in smaller, more relevant
requirements specs, which incidentally allow a wider range of
competitive solutions to be tendered.  A leaner requirements spec also
results in : faster development time and lower development, testing and
integration costs, regardless of FOSS vs proprietry debates.

Q: Would you consider 'open-sourcing' the design and requirements phases
of all government IT procurement specifications prior to the publishing
of requests for Tenders ?


----------------
2) Open File Formats

Im not a great believer in affirmative action for software - legislating
compulsory use of FOSS over proprietry products just for the sake of it.

I am however a great believer in open file formats, which if specified,
would allow all manner of software, both FOSS and Proprietry, to be used
to create the best long-term solution.

I would even go so far as to say that locked-in, unreadable files
without open specifications are very damaging to the long term viability
of a system.

Q: Does the fact that there is a great deal of Govt data locked away in 
proprietry formats concern you ?  Do you loose sleep over this ?

Q: Would you consider a Bill that mandated the use of Open file formats
for the storage of all Govt generated / owned / managed data ?

Q: What priority would you place on a program to actively 'free' all
existing Govt data from locked-in file formats ?

----------------------
The essential question.

Q: Vi or Emacs ?

Any politician who gives a blank response to this one aint getting my
vote. I dont care what their preference is - I just want to see their
reaction.  If they put together any sort of coherent answer, then it
means that they really have done their homework.
