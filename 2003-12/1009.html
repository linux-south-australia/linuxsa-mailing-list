&gt;&gt;Well I would consider this to be a familiarity thing rather than a pro or
&gt;&gt;con about operational ability.  I do realize that this is a standard place
&gt;&gt;for linux (but limited to) and it's process startup scripts.  If I remember
&gt;&gt;correctly there is a FS standard out there that although I've lost the link
&gt;&gt;to it specifies that programs' init scripts should be kept in these
&gt;&gt;directories.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well, for the same reason you seem to like a non-standard dns server which
&gt;abstracts things away from you because it's "easier" (not having a go, just
&gt;pointing it out).  Look at the kind of tasks usually in inittab -&gt; they're
&gt;all fairly "quiet" and static tasks -&gt; very little change happens.
&gt;
&gt;FWIW - I've used inittab to control tasks that don't zoom off to be a daemon 
&gt;before - however, on the whole I've found it better to manage things 
&gt;separately as it seems to lead to better control and management when things 
&gt;go wrong (eg. config files are misedited).  It maybe just my experience, but 
&gt;it is a substaintial amount of experience (9+ years, a large chunk of that 
&gt;running an ISP and managing BIND on a fairly large scale!)
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I agree. inittab is useful for things like getty processess, and "system 
critical" functions, but the proper place for daemons and other 
quasi-system/user functions is in the rc scripts, where runaway 
processes and typos are likely to cause less harm.  Each variant of unix 
is slightly different but most adhere to either a Sys V or BSD rc setup, 
so shouldn't be too hard to work out.

The appropriate system runlevels are frequently documented in man pages 
(eg `man init`   in Solaris will show you what each run level is for), 
and the Sys V startup script structure is very easy to make changes to 
without editting a fairly important system file (a couple of wrong 
keypresses in vi and you'll lock yourself out of your console after 
reloading init).
