What is there to be innovative with/about?

An innovation is not easy to come up with.

Building on ideas/innovations is easier but not wrong. If we immitate
Microsoft/MacIntosh then our users have access to files from other OS's
and similar functions in programs.

&gt; &gt; Network transparency was not innovative?
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps.  Network access to computer systems was already State of the art,
&gt; as was graphic interfaces.  Network graphic access might have been new,
&gt; which means X11, the result of a consortium of business and academia
&gt; might have, been innovative in some ways.

&gt; &gt; bounds of X11 where he has to work, it is. It's just like Microsoft saying 
&gt; &gt; adding long file names to FAT32 was innovative (and somehow worthy of a

&gt; As you say, neither was innovative.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; How about a _really_ old example of innovation. Emacs.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that's a good example.  An extensible display editor was, I think,
&gt; quite a new idea.  Mind you, like X11 it dates back to the 70s (or was
&gt; it 80s.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What about TeX?
&gt; 
&gt; A new typesetting system but not a new idea.  Even the idea of macros
&gt; for TeX, e.g. LaTeX, was predated by the Unix roff systems and their
&gt; many macro libraries.

&gt; &gt; Spamassassin examines emails and determines whether or not they're spam. 
&gt; 
&gt; Automated document classification, and learned-rules, is really very,
&gt; very old.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm disappointed that the best that's been put forward to my "challenge"
&gt; are academic offerings dating back well into the last century.  I'm not
&gt; awfully surprised; the open source community seems to be hell-bent on
&gt; immitation, and I might say also on beating Microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the point in open source if the best we can do is destroy products,
&gt; such as Photo Shop and Quicken, which are the results of large expenditure
&gt; in time and money?  Immitation is easy, but not a noble cause.
