<H1>Kernel 2.6, AMD64 - long rant</H1>

Is it just me, or is anyone else picking up this vibe ? 

Kernel 2.6 is here, now. 
Athlon 64 is here, now. 

Its only just starting to sink in about how important these 2
announcements really are, when taken together. Consider this train of
thought ... 

If you remember the 'good old days of home computers', we had hardware
vendors (such as commodore, apple, atari, sinclair, etc), provide us
with radically new and different offerings every 6 months. Unconstrained
by the need to support a given software standard, they just went ahead
and stuck together whatever hardware which offered something new and
exciting. In contrast, we watch PeeCees 'improve' every year - they bump
up the CPU frequency a couple of notches, double the data rate to
certain peripherals and RAM, add more audio channels and USB ports. 
Same old thing, little bit quicker, and in different colours each year -
aren't we just a lucky bunch of consumers then ? 

Everyone knows why this is the case - Microsoft owns the operating
systems that all new machines MUST use in order sell. Microsoft sees no
real need to change anything, and Intel is more than happy to keep
making money for nothing as well. This makes all of the hardware vendors
appear incompetent, but we really know who is to blame for this malaise.

A lot of people can imagine just how advanced our hardware might be
today, if hardware vendors were completely unconstrained by software
requirements. That is pure speculation of course - fact is, we have been
stuck in a rut for at least 10 years. Thats 10 years of progress gone,
down the drain, never to be seen again. 

On the software front, Linux Kernel 2.6 offers, perhaps for the first
time, real hard-core enterprise computing features in a free operating
system. Whilst for years Linux, BSD and friends have offered a superior
system to Microsoft's offerings on the same hardware, 2,6 extends Linux
upwards towards hardware configurations that are completely out of
Microsoft's reach. In a way, Microsoft has become happily dependant upon
this lack of progress. If new radical new hardware came out tommorow, in
volume, at low prices, then Microsoft would be in serious trouble. 

Thats great, but these high-end exotic hardware platforms are only
available to taxpayer funded mega corporations, or international cocaine
dealers, right ? Maybe not .. AMD has been real daring by coming out
with Opteron/Athlon64, and putting it into the consumer price bracket.
Its still pre-Christmas, and yet you can purchase an AMD64 3000+ in Oz
for under $390 .. today. Opteron 240's are under $350 each. Its not the
same thing as a super computer, but IT IS A BREAK from the STATUS QUO -
a move in the right direction, and within financial reach of many. (If I
recall properly, Im sure that C64's / Sega SC3000 and Atari 800's
retailed for a similar $329 - $400 figure in 1984 ???) 

What is really significant about AMD64 is that AMD went ahead and did it
anyway WITHOUT WAITING FOR MICROSOFT TO CATCH UP. This really flies in
the face of conventional logic, and represents a shift in thinking from
the hardware industry. AMD have more or less stated that 'here is a
cheap 64bit chip for running 64bit Linux/Unix'. And the market is
proving them right .. without the Linux success stories, AMD64 would be
a dead duck, but its flying off the shelves. Given that Microsoft is not
helping at all, what is really going on here ? 

Linux is porting well to AMD64, and showing significant performance
gains, whilst Microsoft is lagging well behind. Win64 benchmarks show a
significant decrease in performance on the same hardware compared to
Win32.  Even if Microsoft managed a miracle, and got a stable Win64 out
by the end of 2004, imagine the mess that the retail Windows software
market is going to look like. Who is going to buy into it when only a
fraction of titles are available in Win64 ?   Windows is well and truly
stuck fast in the 386 era of computing, and there is no way forward for
them. 

Maybe, just Maybe, the success of the 'radical' AMD64 architecture will
prove to all the hardware vendors that it is safe to innovate again.
Hoping that Linux will rapidly adapt to the new hardware and provide a
market for it is NOT akin to believing in faeries.  AMD64 is only a
small experiment, but it is living proof that these notions of Microsoft
laying down the rules to the hardware guys does not hold water anymore. 

So, my Christmas wish is that ..  we will look back in 5 years time and
see Christmas 2003 - the 2.6 Kernel, and the AMD64 chip as being a
critical turning point in : 
- The way that PeeCees are designed and built. 
- The relegation of Microsoft to niche status, as a quaint old company
that provides 'easy to use' software for Intel 80386 architectures.
