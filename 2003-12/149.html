&gt; &gt; I am with you on this. Makes no sense to me either.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, since some of the people who are involved are in the high 
&gt; performance computing (HPC) world, and they want a RH-like (RPM-
&gt; based) distro to move to, it makes a lot of sense to me.

Isn't this what Fedora's aiming to do; that is, a RH-like community distro?

I personally don't see why we need /another/ distro; there's already a million
bazillion out there, and there's plenty long established with the same goals
cAos certainly seems to have in mind.  Combining efforts seems far more
sensible, IMHO.

&gt; Besides, Debian has always seemed clunky to me.

I'll refrain from commenting (lets not go there again) :-)  Debian isn't the
answer to everything, though, I do agree, and some of it's approaches are
simultaneously brilliant and flawed (but I'll stick with it).  Fedora
interests me though, especially seeing as it's apt/yum based now, and actually
seems to have stable, up to date packages.  Anybody running Fedora as a
server, and can report on stability/package broken-ness/if yum or apt break
things occasionally, etc?
