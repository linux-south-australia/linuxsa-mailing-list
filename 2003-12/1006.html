&gt; &gt; used or why this method should not be used, or maybe it is 
&gt; used alot but I
&gt; &gt; just haven't seen it that much?
&gt; 

&gt; Yeah, it's a useful thing to use but:
&gt; 
&gt; - it means you HAVE to be root to run things in /etc/inittab 
&gt; (ie. to edit 
&gt; the file, kill -1 1 to reread inittab etc

Just a note here and I do not know the difference but in the man page for
init it says that the re-read functionality is in the "q|Q" flag (init q).
This re-reads the inittab immediately.

&gt; - you have to edit a relatively critical file to change how it starts
&gt; - it's harder to integrate into a package system (eg. look 
&gt; how easy it is to 
&gt; drop in files into the rcX.d hierarchy and then remove them

Well I would consider this to be a familiarity thing rather than a pro or
con about operational ability.  I do realize that this is a standard place
for linux (but limited to) and it's process startup scripts.  If I remember
correctly there is a FS standard out there that although I've lost the link
to it specifies that programs' init scripts should be kept in these
directories.

&gt; - inittab tends to be more useful for very stable tasks which 
&gt; don't need a 
&gt; lot of "interaction" from inittab.  If something tries to 
&gt; restart too often 
&gt; etc you can lose control of the machine more easily.
&gt; - you have to be root or have root access ...
&gt; 
&gt; [I'm not quite sure why you claim bind needs multiple files changed for a
single change]

Well what I meant to say was adding (via text editor) not changing an entry
to bind requires multiple edits (unless things have changed), for PTR and
A/CNAME/MX among possibly others.
