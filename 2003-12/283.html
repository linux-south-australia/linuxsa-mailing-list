&gt; The very vast majority of unix programs have zero configuration:
&gt; Awk, grep, ls, cat and so on.  Normally it would be servers that need
&gt; configuring, such as Postgres, Sendmail and Lpd.  However I gather that
&gt; in this instance we're taking about the ugly, awkward, point-n-click type
&gt; of programs, the dvd players and so on.  These are exactly the programs
&gt; that have the poorest documentation and which are hard to use because
&gt; of that lack.

Many of those sorts of tools also have command line arguments documented
in man pages (mplayer being a reasonable example).

&gt; &gt; This brings me to the FreeBSD ports.   Take DVD playing for example.  If 
&gt; &gt; the port checked if /dev/dvd existed and asked the user if he would like 
&gt; &gt; to  add that symbolic link, then it would be alot easier.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That, along with the testing that was mentioned a few days back, would 
&gt; &gt; make Unix much easier to use and very viable.
&gt; 
&gt; More like Microsoft; not easier to use.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In general, programs should not require documention on use, but instead, 
&gt; &gt; the theory behind its use.  I envision a program setup utility that is 
&gt; &gt; simple for the end user to use. It asks the user questions and the user 
&gt; &gt; answers.  Tweaking broken installations should be considered an advanced 
&gt; &gt; issue.
&gt; 
&gt; I could not agree with this less.  The idea that programs shouldn't
&gt; require documentation on use is so close to the idea that programs
&gt; shouldn't require documentation at all that it scares me.  The idea that
&gt; configuration should be a simple question and answer scenario is naive,
&gt; and worse, smacks of the black box mentality that makes Microsoft hard
&gt; to use.  Those black boxes are based on, 'let us do the hard work,
&gt; you don't need to know,' which is ultimately untrue.  And when you do
&gt; need to know you discover that the black box is really a wall which you
&gt; cannot see beyond.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been using unix for almost twenty years, and only had trouble
&gt; knowing how to use it (by which I mean programs that run on it) in the
&gt; last few.  All of the programs that I have problems with have deficient
&gt; documentation.  One of unix's major advantages over other operating
&gt; systems was an easy to use and consistent suite of documentation.
&gt; Thanks to the open source community, that advantage has been steadily
&gt; whittled away.

When you use the Wrong Open Source Software(tm), yes.

One of the advantages (and disadvantages) of all this open source stuff
is that it seems to do a pretty good/bad job at catering for all people.
There are the people like my grandmother (who managed an install of
Mandrake 7.2, incidentally) who like the Apple/Microsoft black-box
thing. The more decisions they can have made for them, the happier they
are.

Then there are other people (myself probably included) who would rather
be able to Do Things Properly(tm). I don't use office suites, except in
the rare cases where it's quicker to use them. I prefer to use a text
editor (I use gvim a lot, myself) and the collection of tools that have
been there for me over the years.

I don't have a problem with the rest of the world using Something Else,
as long as there's a way for my stuff to work with their stuff and vice
versa. Sure, it's setting the IT world back a few decades, but it's not
for me to force my (obviously right) religious beliefs on the rest of
the world. Having said that, if I find someone struggling with a
particular tool (say, a large document and Microsoft Word), I'll gladly
offer to show them a tool that may do the job better (say, LaTeX).

My 2c.

thx,
Matt
