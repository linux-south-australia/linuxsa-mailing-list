&gt;
&gt; David,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh man...  Once and for all: Let's get something straight here:
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully not me.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There have been many instances of extremist so-called "Christians"
&gt; &gt; although I cannot imagine how anyone who has even the most foundational
&gt; &gt; understanding of Christianity can say that the Klu Klux Klan, Adolf
&gt; &gt; Hitler, Pol Pot or Nazi's can possibly be what The Bible describes as
&gt; &gt; Christian!!! (Christian btw is defined as followers of Christ - in other
&gt; &gt; words doers not just listeners.)
&gt;
&gt; YOU define Christian as "followers of Christ" - don't foist your views on
&gt; us ;-)
&gt;
&gt; &lt;big snip of quotes from The Gospel of Matthew as accepted by the Catholic
&gt; churches&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ***THIS*** is fundamentalist Christianity, spoken by the very person who
&gt; &gt; the word defines.  And ANYTHING else is EXTREMIST.
&gt;
&gt; How do you know? The "church" has held many councils, some famous and
&gt; infamous. Did they make the Nicene crede because the Gospels support it OR
&gt; did they make the Gospels support the Nicene crede? I wonder, I
&gt; wonder...and by your definition anyone who happens to believe anything in
&gt; any of the Epistles happens to be an extremist.
&gt;
&gt; (Anyone who claims that The Epistles were anything more than one fallible
&gt; human being writing to his fellow brethren is deluding themselves. I lend
&gt; no more credibility to The Epistles than I would to a letter from Pope
&gt; John Paul II to his brethren. In other words, I believe they were written
&gt; by men who believed in their heart they were `christian' [for want of a
&gt; better term] but not that they are the 'word of God' or even correct
&gt; interpretations of the 'word of God'])
