&gt; How can we make our passwords more secure ? or how do we avoid passwords
&gt; being easily cracked/sniffed ?

Unix system passwords can only be recovered using a brute force attack,
which means trying every possible password in sequence until you've
found the right one.  This is because unix doesn't store the password,
but transforms it into a code using a one way encryption.  When you use
your password, what you type is converted using the same encryption and
if the two codes match the passwords are deemed to be the same.

Traditional unix passwords use DES (Data Encryption Standard), and
limit your password to 56 bits (8 characters).  On fast hardware you
can generate all possible passwords quite quickly (a few days or less)
so it's vitally important to make sure that nobody can see the codes
without authorisation.  If somebody gets the codes they find the
passwords using a brute force attack.  The password code used to be
stored in the /etc/passwd file, which is readable by everyone with an
account on the machine.  During the 1980's, the obvious security problem
was fixed by moving the password codes to a seperate file, /etc/shadow,
which was only readable by root.

On modern unix systems, including linux, the old 56-bit DES codes were
replaced by much longer MD5 hashes.  This new way is conceptually the
same as the old way; the differences are a new formula used to make
the code, and a longer, 128-bit code.  The change to MD5 is not nearly
so important as the extra length in the code.  Each additional bit of
code doubles the time it takes to complete brute force attack: if you
can recover a password in three days using 56-bit DES then 57-bit DES
would take six days, 58-bit DES would take twelve days, and 128-bit DES
would take 14,167,099,448,608,935,641,088 days, or just under than 40
million trillion years.  A brute force attack on an MD5 hash would take
about the same time, give or take a few million trillion years.

The major password-based security threat isn't that somebody will crack
your password, it's that somebody will see or guess your password.
If someone sees you typing your password they can read it as you type.

Poor choice of password is a major threat.  If you use the name of
your favourite pet, then people who know you will have a good chance
of guessing your password.  The same applies to your middle name, your
spouse's middle name and your date of birth.

Some administrators think it's a good idea to put torturous restrictions
on passwords, such as requiring a mix of letters and numbers, and
not allowing dictionary words.  This causes people to use trivial
transformations, like using a zero instead of the letter oh, or a one
instead of the letter eye or ell.  That doesn't really help.  It means
that someone who knows that your pet is named "blinky", would also have to
try "b11nky", "b1inky" and "bl1nky".  That's not really much protection.
Even worse, if the rules are harsh enough you might not be able to
remember your own password, and so be encouraged to write it down.
Watch for the strange words written on yellow post-it notes stuck to on
computer screens; good chance they're passwords!

To be good you need to be able to remember your password, and it needs
to be something nobody else will guess.  The best mechanism I've ever
heard is to make an acronym: Think of a sentence and use the first
letter of every word.  "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse,"
becomes ahahmkfah.  You won't forget the sentence, and so you'll always
remember the password.

No matter how good your password is, it's worth nothing if people can
see it.  Remember what I said about somebody watching you type it?
What's scary is that many network applications send your password over
the network in the clear.  If you use telnet to access a remote machine
your username and password can be read by anybody who shares the same
wire between you and that machine.  The same applies to ftp and even to
many web logins.  Good rules of thumb: Don't use telnet or ftp if you
can use ssh or scp instead.  Don't use web authentication on a <A HREF="http://">http://</A>
address if you can use an https:// address instead.  If you must use
one of the "don't use" methods, then assume that somebody else already
knows the password, and make it different to your other passwords.
