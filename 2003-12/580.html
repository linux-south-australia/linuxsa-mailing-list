&gt; &gt;&gt; In my view, fundamentalism in any faith is bad
&gt; &gt; news, particularly so if you don't share their views.


Bah...  When are people going to get the difference between =
fundamentalism and extremism?

I KNOW there are better definitions than mine (so don't be upset if mine =
sn't as good as yours) but I'd just like to say that if it helps anyone =
to understand the difference, my personal illustration is that: =
Fundametalism is a person basing their lives on the foundation of =
whatever precept/belief and/or sect they follow.  (Eg: Love, Peace and =
Charity based Christianity, Budhism and Muslimism are all things that =
could be argued to be fundamentalist as these are key tenets of each =
'religion')

Whereas I define extremism as a person basing their lives on the =
distortion of the original precept/belief and/or sect that came up with =
the original belief. (Eg: Nazism, Al Quiada, The IRA, Facsim and =
hinese/Russian ommunism are all good examples of fundamentalist ideas =
that were distorted nto being extremist.)

I'm actualy enjoying my day off reading this thread - but for goodness =
sake et's not use fundamentalist when we mean extremist (or vica-versa)  =
:-)
