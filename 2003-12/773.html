Wow thanks for the links :-)
played (briefly!) with xfig, don't like it, seems to be a bit crude. 

I like cycas after a quick play, and another point in its favour is that
there is also a NT version.  I like introducing cross platform software
at work (High School).  Have got teachers to demo to students OpenOffice
and Dia so far. Surely there is more to education than M$!

Screenshots of pythoncad look good.  It will be next on my to play with
list.

Thanks again

&gt; &gt;QCad 1.5 is still available and free and is quite straight forward and 
&gt; &gt;simple.  The non free version is version 2 and is a rewrite.  Quite
&gt; &gt;good although has a few bugs.  Cheap at $25 US.  I think it uses a non
&gt; &gt;free version of QT.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Anyone managed to get AutoCAD running under a full emulator, like
&gt; &gt;VMWare&gt; or even bochs ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It does run under VMWare, although I can't test it thoroughly cause I 
&gt; &gt;don't know Autocad too well.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; Following is a collation of stuff I sent off list to Steve..
&gt; 
&gt; have a look at pythoncad
&gt; 
&gt; looks simple(interface), scriptable etc
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.pythoncad.org/">http://www.pythoncad.org/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; (and learning Python is "a good thing "(TM))
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Found this great link:
&gt; <A HREF="http://pfrostie.freeservers.com/cad-tastrafy/">http://pfrostie.freeservers.com/cad-tastrafy/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; (seems to have sorted out most of the chaff)
&gt; 
&gt; There is also this:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tech-edv.co.at/lunix/CAD.html">http://www.tech-edv.co.at/lunix/CAD.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I did a little digging around:
&gt; seems older versions of QCAD are still available :
&gt; (apt-get install qcad :)
&gt; or
&gt; <A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/qcad/">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/qcad/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; If you have the QT3 developers kit you can obtain the full source of
&gt; qcad from the main site: 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad_downloads.html">http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad_downloads.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; A lot of bother I expect..^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems Varkon and Cycas are still available as well:
&gt; I remember not being too impressed with  Varkon (though that ws about 18
&gt; months ago...)
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/whatis.htm">http://www.tech.oru.se/cad/varkon/whatis.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; CYCAS IS really interesting and given enough resources (more than 300
&gt; mhz 128 ram IMHO) would be worth learning... 
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cycas.de/">http://www.cycas.de/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OCTREE
&gt; uses mouse gestures .. I used this for a one off thing ...
&gt; It was little quirky to learn .. but as I remember very flexible and
&gt; quite good. (free for non commercial use)
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt; <A HREF="http://www.octree.de/html/frames/eng/f_octree.htm">http://www.octree.de/html/frames/eng/f_octree.htm</A>
&gt; see the tutorial
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Blender idea is worth a think about .. I have had similar thoughts
&gt; just not enough of an itch to scratch (yet)..
&gt; (and skills time etc)
&gt; 
&gt; I also use DIA xfig and gschematic (electronics) (AKA GEDA )and xcircuit
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; For some reason I really like xfig but could not recommend it for real
&gt; CAD use. (It's Possible though ) I once did a 200 lantern Lighting
&gt; design on Xfig ... and took that show around the country with it ...
&gt; I was silly really... and the show was too.. why ? no idea now.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many others .. perhaps less developed but try starting from
&gt; here:
