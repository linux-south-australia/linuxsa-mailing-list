&gt; Chris, state your claim again. We now have Shaun Branden with a "Hitler"
&gt; and David Wolverton with an instance of  "Nazism".

Oh man...  Once and for all: Let's get something straight here:

There have been many instances of extremist so-called "Christians" although
I cannot imagine how anyone who has even the most foundational understanding
of Christianity can say that the Klu Klux Klan, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot or
Nazi's can possibly be what The Bible describes as Christian!!! (Christian
btw is defined as followers of Christ - in other words doers not just
listeners.)

Guys, this is as blatantly rediculous as stating that sitting in a church
pew on a Sunday morning makes you a Christian - or like stateing that
spending the night in your car's garage makes you a car!!!

IMHO (and I believe the Bible backs it up) the Crussaders were not
fundamentalists - they were extremists. Just as the KKK, IRA, Nazi's, Pol
Pot - and all like minded - are/were equally extremists.

Also for the record, if ANYBODY wants to know what fundamentalist
Christianity teaches, simply read the sermon on the Mount as taught by Jesus
Himself. (Read Matthew - otherwise refered to as the Beatitudes. Start at
Matthew Chapeter 5 and finish reading at Matthew Chapter 8.)

4 very short examples include:

M 5:7 "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."  M 5:9
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God."  M
5: 22-22 "You have heard it ws said to those of old 'you shall not murder'
and whoever murders will be in dagner of the judgment. But *I* say to you
that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of
the judgemnt"  M 5: 38-39 "You have heard that it was said 'an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth' But *I* tell you not to resist an evil person.
But whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other to him also."  (I
could go on for MANY pages - but I'm sure we all get the point)

***THIS*** is fundamentalist Christianity, spoken by the very person who the
 word defines.  And ANYTHING else is EXTREMIST.
