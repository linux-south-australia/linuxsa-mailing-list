&gt;Microsoft format breakage :-)

Apologies...perhaps this could be part of the proposed discussions as
well...alternative mail clients tend to be friendlier to OtherMailUsersTM.


&gt;I've been busy living a Real Life over the last few days, and I don't
&gt;think anybody would thank me for reviving this thread, but:

Ditto, back at work for the day sadly...


&gt;As most of you know, the "Linux and Open Source in Government"
&gt;conference, which we have given the less obvious name "OCGCONF" (Open
&gt;Computing in Government) will be happening next month.  We're still

I did hear a rumor or two about that conference ;)


&gt;looking for a second panel session.  This sounds like a good topic:

Definitely.


&gt; - Microsoft has a proven track record of broken mail implementations.
&gt; - Mail is important to just about everybody.

...and sadly, it's not important to enough people (intra-gov) because
of the cost, which in turn defeats the purpose of SAGov email as it tends to

be used only by a select few, or in my case, I have an internal mail system
to take up some of the slack...


&gt;My question: can we get some interesting people together to talk on
&gt;the subject?  Some of the people on this list would be a good start,
&gt;but I don't want anybody to get into trouble.  On the other hand,
&gt;getting both them (you?) and some of the SA government policy makers
&gt;together to discuss the matter could be interesting, and it might also
&gt;have the positive outcome that the system could be greatly improved
&gt;and money saved.

Count me in, not too fussed about getting into trouble these days. If I
do get into trouble for using open source then the troublemaker can write
out a personal cheque for me to switch all my *nix boxes back to Windoze ;)
