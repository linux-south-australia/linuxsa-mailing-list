This might interest a few, looks like another fine use for Linux.

"A fearless mobile robot is helping scientists monitor environmental
changes in forests.

The hi-tech Tarzan of the robot world, nicknamed Treebot, is the first
of its kind to combine networked sensors, a webcam, and a wireless net
link.

It is solar-powered and moves up and down special cables to take samples
and measurements for vital analysis.

Treebot has been developed by scientists at the US Centre for Embedded
Network Sensing in California.

Pinpoint precision

Programmed with open-source computer code, Linux, the Treebot is a vital
addition to researchers' environmental monitoring kit, according to one
of the project leaders, Professor William Kaiser.

"One of our objectives is to make use of distributed sensors to acquire
information about the environment," he said.

"It is very important in the biology community to understand the
interaction between the atmosphere and the forest environment."

Understanding subtle changes in light, humidity, and carbon dioxide
levels give scientists crucial indications and predictions about
environmental change.

But 90% of all interaction between the environment and atmospheric
conditions happens high up in the forest canopy, and it is a challenge
taking detailed measurements and monitoring conditions over a period of
time.


The Treebot, which in scientific terms is a node in a Networked
Infomechanical System (Nims), helps by being stealthy enough to travel
through the forest canopy along specially-constructed cabling, night and
day.

"Using new Nims technology, provides us with a means to place
instruments anywhere, moving horizontally and vertically," said
Professor Kaiser.

"At the same time, we can monitor plants and even individual leaves over
time using spectrographic imaging."

Eighteen months in development, the main difference between Treebot and
other fixed sensors is its autonomous nature and its ability to
communicate with other devices and sensors.

It has its own server and, using its wireless net link, sends sample
information and other data back to scientists based at the University of
California (UCLA).

They, in turn, can tell it go to specific points of interest and take
samples or analyse particular areas.

The robot can also lower another sensor deep into the forest to pick up
detailed data about conditions, and it talks to other fixed sensors on
the ground around the forest.

"We need to understand carbon dioxide effects and light - to what extent
it makes its way to lower canopy," said Professor Kaiser.

Treebot can pinpoint and analyse foliage to see if carbon dioxide has
resulted from photosynthesis or from the upper atmosphere.

'Significant breakthrough'

The next stage of the project includes building a website from which
schoolchildren can access images and information from Treebot, as well
as help with experiments.

The team also hope to introduce more Treebots and portable towers so
that the entire Nims system can be moved, set up and launched at any
location. 

"We are very excited about this and feel it really is a significant
breakthrough in allowing us to have a variety of fixed and mobile
sensors, and it gives us a new understanding of our environment,"
Professor Kaiser said.

"We won't be surprised if we uncover an entirely new phenomenon with
it." 

The Treebot, part of wider research funded by the National Science
Foundation Science and Technology Center, is set to swing into three
forests by early 2004 and has already been successfully used at the Wind
River Canopy Crane Research Facility in California."
