Father Pearson,

&gt; We have had installed a linux server.

Excellent.

&gt; The original provider then refused to give us the password for the linux
&gt; programme - saying that he had already given it to us and that he did
&gt; not have a record of the password.  I disputed this to no avail.

How unprofessional :-) Had I managed to forget the password I would have
at least shown you how to reset it...

&gt; Can anyone tell me if it is possible to change the password and make it
&gt; possible for us to access the programme.  Whilst it is operating well at
&gt; the moment, we are fearful of what will happen if there is a fault.

Imderstamdab;e/

&gt; Also we are requiring some changes to email addresses on our network
&gt; which we cannot undertake without a password.
&gt; 
&gt; On top of this we are as poor as church mice!!

In the spirit of Christmas, please feel free to call me on 0402 440993 to
arrange a time for me to come down and help you with your little problem.
If you like I'll also show you where the Linux system keeps its basica
logs as well.

I only expect a cup of tea and a biscuit in return, but keep the mice away
from me ;-)
