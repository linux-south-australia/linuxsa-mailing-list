&gt; Romana,
&gt; 
&gt; You are a legend my friend, and I LOVE your tongue in cheek wit!!!  (Humour
&gt; is a lost art in todays day and age it seems)  :-(

*modest bow*
:)

&gt; 
&gt; Let me just summarise what I understand your argument is.  If I've
&gt; understood, you seem to be suggesting there is a blatant contradiction in
&gt; the two books (Old and New Testaments) and if that's the case, let me help
&gt; you out by giving you the ULTRA condenced version of the answer.

the readers digest version?:)

&gt; Because the words Jesus spoke seemed to contradict the teaching of what we
&gt; now know to be the Old Testament - even the Jews of Jesus time asked him
&gt; many times if he was teaching somthing different.  ...He simply replied:
&gt; (Matthew 5: 17-18 " Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the
&gt; Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to
&gt; you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jott or one tittle will by no
&gt; means pass from the law till all is fulfilled...." and - well you can choose
&gt; to read the rest or not for yourself.

i have. several times. also, parts of the koran, the torah, and the
writings of confucious, buddha,taoist writings, krishna, and monkey -
seriously, the orginal book is very zen:)
as opposed to zen and the art of motorocycle maintenance, which wasnt.
and carlos castenada got hohum.richard bach is pretty good.

i take knowledge and learning where i can:)

personally, spike milligan/goons, douglas adams, and monty python had a 
far better grasp on it all...;)

&gt; That's (as Shaun might point out) a surface answer.  I'm happy to plum the
&gt; depths of the issue if you REALLY want to know the who's what's when's and
&gt; why' - but I guess this depends on whether this is a quest for knowledge -
&gt; or just an argument to pass the time.  :-)

life is a quest for knowledge. your quest is done when yr life is.

alex wallis is lots of learned fun to talk to as well about this stuff:))
