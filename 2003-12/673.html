&gt;&gt;I don't mind the different emails and sometimes they are amusing
&gt;&gt;and interesting which made me think,  could it be possible to run a
&gt;&gt;forum like a lot of Distro's users do?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it would be possible.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;That way we could have different areas for newbie questions , general
&gt;&gt;questions, Linux, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; This has been discussed ad infinitum in various forms in the past. Let me
&gt; summarise:
&gt; 
&gt;  * "Admin" hasn't made any indication at all that he's willing to do this
&gt;  * "The Royals", whilst they can be a fractitious bunch of squabblers all
&gt;     generally think this is a Bad Thing [tm]
&gt; 
&gt; It's bad because splitting the list actually misses the whole point of
&gt; LinuxSA. It's a user group, not a technical forum or an always "on topic"
&gt; discussion list. In my opinion (and I've been proven right many times)
&gt; LinuxSA is a social group first and a technical group second.

Its strange that many of the LUGs mail lists that I have been on in
the past have moved in this direction.

&gt; User group mailing lists that simply keep "on topic" all the time
&gt; generally just die ;-)

I tend to agree on this point.
(Not because DSL is right, but, been there, seen it happen.)

Forums are often very disorganised and horribly complex creatures.
They are not well suited to threaded discussions and are a
moderators nightmare. Not to mention they (seem to) *encourage*
horribly formated HTML posts with flashing things =(

'nuf said.

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
