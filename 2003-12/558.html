&gt; Care to clarify such a sweeping generalisation?

No problem as you are right, it was a generalisation.

What I'm referring to are the leaders and former leaders of the recent
Southern Baptist community in the US such as Morris H Chapman, Jack Graham
and Jerry Vines. I won't influence your view by pointing you at articles *I*
think you should read. Their names alone should be enough for you to go on
in terms of internet articles, religious journals, etc. in particular,
Vines.

Just to clarify, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) haven't always been
so conservative. Neither has their been an influx of right-wing
conservatives into the group. It's only been in the 10 years or so that more
liberal elements have simply been pushed out. 

&gt; When people of all religions are playing the numbers game, they are quite 
&gt; prepared to be lumped in with all the various sects that their religion 
&gt; has splintered into, but when playing the 'holier than thou' game, they 
&gt; are less so.

Just again to clarify, I was speaking on behalf of how I'd feel, not how
others would necessarily feel. If others are quite happy to be lumped in
with all other sects vaguely connected to their religion, no problem here.
I, on the other hand, would just as I'm unhappy with being lumped in with
drinking and violence because I'm Aboriginal.

&gt; The other count of course goes by the name of 'My ism is better than your 
&gt; ism because your ism has killed more people than my ism.' This too is 
&gt; wrong, because isms (or Religions) don't kill people. People do.

Agreed there.

Yes, he is clearly wrong on a couple of counts.

When people of all religions are playing the numbers game, they are quite 
prepared to be lumped in with all the various sects that their religion 
has splintered into, but when playing the 'holier than thou' game, they 
are less so.

The other count of course goes by the name of 'My ism is better than your 
ism because your ism has killed more people than my ism.' This too is 
wrong, because isms (or Relgions) don't kill people. People do.

Let's hope that the OS wars don't get so bad that someone decides to do 
something really drastic about it.
