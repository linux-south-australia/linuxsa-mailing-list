&gt; Microsoft has tried to insulate themselves from this problem by becoming a 
&gt; monopoly in a number of areas, but I suspect that they too will face 
&gt; exactly the same pressure. Only time will tell if they can manage to 
&gt; survive.


Microsoft in its current form is interested in one thing and that is
making as much money as possible in the short and long term. If Linux is
able to generate and/or carve up enough marketshare for itself, I
wouldn't be surprised to see Microsoft write software to run on Linux in
the future. They'll do this because it'll fit in their strategic
planning.

I'm a heavy Linux user at home and my workplace is predominately Linux
workstations. What I'm realise now is that OSS software is neither
better or worse than commercial offerings, it's just different.

But what annoys me is that OSS isn't any more innovative or even
"better" for the vast majority of desktop users. I'm willing to accept
this if it makes OSS stronger and better fit for servers, embedded
devices, backend systems and so forth.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan
