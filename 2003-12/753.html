First some background:
Computerbank (soon to be IT Share) is a community group which receives
donated computers, from individuals and organisations, wipes the drives,
puts enough good components together to make a reasonable system and
then gives it to members of the community who cannot usually purchase
computers. We use opensource software on the computers and try to help
the recipients experience the online world with a modem and free
(initial) Internet access.

As a very pro opensource community group, we are always looking to get
the most functionality on the least resources for our recipients. One
problem we always have though is which distribution, what applications
and what is the minimum spec machine this will run comfortably on.

The minimum system we send out is:
Pentium 1 166 (current average is p2 233ish)
64 mb ram
2gb hard drive
15" svga monitor
sound card, cdrom
Opensource OS and applications
Training
support

We try to give:
ISP account
modem
speakers
printer

Modern installs of popular distributions are amazing and pack a huge
amount of really great software into a small space. However choosing
which OS and what applications will fit comfortably in around 1.5gb
hdd and that will run fast enough to make a usable system is tricky.

We are currently using fedora, have recently used mandrake 9.0,
mandrake 9.2 and debian sid. The distribution needs to be fairly easily
installed via (nfs, http, ftp) and cdrom by non-geek volunteers and
should be easy to use, have office tools and be secure enough to be
online.

So any thoughts on this and would it make a reasonable fixit session ?

thanks
