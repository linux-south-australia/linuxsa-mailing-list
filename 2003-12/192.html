checkout this rather insightful statement by "Tony Healy, a research software 
engineer and policy researcher within Australia-Innovate." :

"Open source software is based on software being free, which means developers 
receive no revenue. Open source advocates dispute this but the fact is that, 
once the source code is publicly available for a product, it is difficult to 
charge for software, because other people produce rival programs using that 
source code, or modify it and pretend it was their own work. In this sense, 
software is different from all other copyrighted works. . . .Any concerted 
move to open source would kill innovation, because revenue is essential for 
all serious practitioners in the economy, including software developers. It's 
worth noting that Linux creator Linus Torvalds created a product worth 
billions of dollars, yet [he] still has to scrabble for a job. This is not a 
model we want for Australian software."

What's stopping MYOB (or others) from running their proprietary software on 
Linux? Use LGPL libraries, and it's fine. Or pay for QT. I believe according 
to the bill, that if MYOB published their file formats, they could keep their 
software proprietary and that would be acceptable to the government (It's 
Open Standards we want! A level playing field!).

ahh well,

Damien
