Ok, so I am ready to start "moonbeaming" ideas and this is the closest 
comment to what I want to say....

I think Open Source Unix programs should not merely deliver binaries, 
but they should also guide the user through configuring the application 
during the install.  

* It should be a required part of the LSB, or whatever.*

If the the installers allowed for configuration, them man pages would be 
as useless as they really are.  Because in my experience, man pages only 
provide a clue as to how to use the program, and that is not much of the 
battle. The big battle is learning the configurations, and there are far 
too many applications to learn configurations for.

This brings me to the FreeBSD ports.   Take DVD playing for example.  If 
the port checked if /dev/dvd existed and asked the user if he would like 
to  add that symbolic link, then it would be alot easier.

Anyway, I would like to type...

make install clean configure

...and know that the thing is going to work.

That, along with the testing that was mentioned a few days back, would 
make Unix much easier to use and very viable.

In general, programs should not require documention on use, but instead, 
the theory behind its use.  I envision a program setup utility that is 
simple for the end user to use. It asks the user questions and the user 
answers.  Tweaking broken installations should be considered an advanced 
issue.

&gt; I've lost count of the number of times recently that I've gone to 
&gt; "man" trying to decipher the arcane options on a seldom used command 
&gt; only to find that said command either doesn't have a man page, or it's 
&gt; so poorly written that extracting any useful information from it would 
&gt; take longer than working out how to use the utility by trial and 
&gt; error. Not to mention the insistance of some developers to forsake 
&gt; "man" in favour of "info".
&gt;
&gt; Since I don't tend to hang out in the KDE/Gnome world much (I *do* so 
&gt; like the OSX interface), I have little comment on the "help" systems 
&gt; used in those desktop environments. However, on a related note, both 
&gt; environments (and maybe KDE more than Gnome) have a serious conistancy 
&gt; problem when it comes to where settings are kept. Some are set in the 
&gt; Control Panel, some in config files, some in Properties panes under 
&gt; right click menus, all very mish-mash and not easily found in a hurry.
