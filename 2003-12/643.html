*** FIXIT Prizes announced!


You could be a winner!  A FIXIT is a BoF with an outcome; an outcome
that benefits open source.  Thanks to HP, these have just become quite a
drawcard!

If there's something in open source you think could do with a bit of
fixing, it just might make an ideal FIXIT session to hold.  And with HP
iPaq's at stake, it could well be worth your while to analyse an
irritating problem in your favourite piece of software, prove
definitively that X should always be used in place of Y, brainstorm to
produce a plausible list of improvements to an important piece of
infrastracture.  If it is related to Open Source and has an outcome,
it's a contender!

They're also great fun to run :-)

The FIXIT leader wins a prize; but so do the top 4 contributing
members.  They are as follows:

1st Prizes
--
Leader: HP iPaq with WLAN card 
Top 4 contributing members: HP iPaq

2nd & 3rd Prizes
--
Leader: HP iPaq
Top 4 contributing members: WLAN card

You can also be involved with the heated discussions about each FIXIT
session on our Forum or Mailing Lists, and help indicate your
contribution to the FIXIT.  Talk about possible sessions, brainstorm how
exactly you're going to solve that problem, and after LCA's all done and
over, continue to use the community onboard to get that issue solved!
