&gt;The Microsoft line was a last minute throw-away, based on my observation
&gt;that a lot of open source immitation is aimed at them.  I'd have to say
&gt;that the open source immitation of Microsoft is quite good.  Open source
&gt;products are becoming confusing, poorly documented, bloated and buggy.
&gt;Why, every time I need to use a new KDE tool I re-discover the poor
&gt;quality of documentation.  It used to be that man was the univeral
&gt;answer; now it seems to be a mishmash of help systems, html files, info
&gt;documents and man pages, with man pages being ignored in favour of a
&gt;random preference in the others.  Is there anything wrong with man pages?
&gt;Not that I can see, unless you think that they eye-candy of the windows
&gt;world is important.  Apparently the open source immitators feel that
&gt;it is.  Unix was an elegant, robust and easy-to-use operating system
&gt;for over twenty years.  Now, even I am finding it harder to use.
&gt;

I'd have to agree.

Documentation is a mostly boring an menial task but it is something that 
*has* to be done.  I've lost count of the number of times recently that 
I've gone to "man" trying to decipher the arcane options on a seldom 
used command only to find that said command either doesn't have a man 
page, or it's so poorly written that extracting any useful information 
from it would take longer than working out how to use the utility by 
trial and error. Not to mention the insistance of some developers to 
forsake "man" in favour of "info".

Since I don't tend to hang out in the KDE/Gnome world much (I *do* so 
like the OSX interface), I have little comment on the "help" systems 
used in those desktop environments. However, on a related note, both 
environments (and maybe KDE more than Gnome) have a serious conistancy 
problem when it comes to where settings are kept. Some are set in the 
Control Panel, some in config files, some in Properties panes under 
right click menus, all very mish-mash and not easily found in a hurry.
