&gt; &gt; &gt; Thinking about the first paragraph, about killing innovation:  I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; an idea for a product which I intend to develop.  It's going to cost
&gt; &gt; &gt; $250,000+ to develop, uses commodity PC hardware costing about $300
&gt; &gt; &gt; per unit to manufacture, will retail for about $500+, and I expect to
&gt; &gt; &gt; sell a million of them in the third year.  Would you be interested in
&gt; &gt; &gt; investing your money in this project?  If the device was GPLed would
&gt; &gt; &gt; you still be interested?  Do you think the GPL might worry investors?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Deciding to GPL the software may open up development opportunities you
&gt; &gt; wouldn't have if you decide to take the proprietary route. For example
&gt; &gt; you could incorporate code from other GPL software, reducing both the
&gt; &gt; development time and cost.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps the money upfront required would now be low enough that you
&gt; &gt; wouldn't need to get any external investors. Sure, you would most
&gt; &gt; likely get competitors sooner, but going the proprietary route won't
&gt; &gt; stop that either - but all of the profit would be yours instead of
&gt; &gt; mostly going to the investors.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, I have to say that there are some unrealistic ideas here. Anyone 
&gt; coming up with a product these days is probably going to need 50 employees 
&gt; at least by the time they get to market. That costs a lot of money.

Heh, well you're not going to get 50 employees for $250,000 either!

But fundamentally I think there is a tradeoff between deciding to use
the GPL license - you potentially can incorporate a lot existing code
and get to market cheaper and faster but its going to be easier for
people to clone what you've done.

&gt; Secondly, they are going to need to use open source software somewhere 
&gt; just to defray their costs, and there are a lot of good open source tools 
&gt; for doing the basic things.

Sure, lots of proprietary software development use open source tools
now anyway. I'd even guess that most proprietary UNIX application
development use at least some open source tools.

&gt; Not getting external investors is, IMO, pie in the sky.

Not if you want to grow like a silicon valley company and make
billions in a few years :-) But the less investors you need to bring
in, the more of the pie left for you :-)

Does small business still have a chance? I really don't know.
