&gt; Well actually, the term "fundamentalist" originated as a term of honour -
&gt; one who accepted and believed the "fundamentals" of the (Christian) faith,
&gt; as documented in the bible, and didn't add extra things to suit their
&gt; opinions and lifestyles (of various extremist cults etc).  Since them the
&gt; term has come to mean something somewhat different.

And the colloquial was what I was referring to, not the origin. I thought
that was taken as a given in most conversations one has with anyone these
days! :-)

&gt; The tone of your email suggested that there was something wrong with being
&gt; a "Southern Baptist", and I was suggesting that you are lumping a lot of
&gt; people together under the one banner.  Googling for "Southern Baptist"
&gt; gave me this &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp&gt">http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp&gt</A>; which is a
&gt; pretty standard Christian statement of faith.  Whether you agree with it
&gt; or not is irrelevant to the discussion, but rather it shows that the
&gt; "Southern Baptists" are a pretty much mainline Christian group, albeit
&gt; conservative.

The SBC will protest to the hilt that they aren't that conservative but then
guys like Jerry Vines will say that Muhammed was a 'pedophile', etc. Jerry
Vines is most definately a conservative and is representative of a large
proportion of members of the SBC, even if the central tenets haven't caught
up yet.

&gt; Back to George "Double-ya".  Some quick googling also shows that there's a
&gt; lot of divided opinion on what the president of the USA believes.  Whether
&gt; he has any faith in anything or not - being president in the USA means you
&gt; are a) very busy, and b) expected to visit churches on Sundays.  So it's
&gt; all largely speculative.

Isn't the debate more about whether he actually practices rather than
believes? A lot of Christians I know are offended by what he does in calling
himself a Christian. Not like I would know, anyway - I'm not religious.

&lt;quote who="SAPOL"&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you please identify the buildings that Southern Baptists have
&gt;&gt; blown up?  Or perhaps the suicide bombings that have been performed by
&gt;&gt; it's adherents?  What about aircraft hijackings, how many of those
&gt;&gt; have been done by "fundamental" Christans?
&gt;
&gt; 'Fundamentalism' is defined by philosophies, not by actions. There are
&gt; plenty of non-violent fundamentalist religious groups. That's why
&gt; calling the Taliban 'fundamentalists' doesn't accurately describe them,
&gt; for example. 'Violent fundamentalists' are different to 'non-violent
&gt; fundamentalists'. And when I talk about Southern Baptists, I'm
&gt; referring to their philosophies publically expounded, not the people
&gt; themselves or even the religion in terms of the bible. I'm talking
&gt; about what they've actually said. So please don't try to turn this into
&gt; a personal attack of the people or Christians in general.
