hoo boy, am i gonna BURN for this one;))))
still, its a hot day already;)

On Tue, Dec 16, 2003 at 01:32:48PM +1030, David WOLVERTON imparted:
&gt; IMHO (and I believe the Bible backs it up) the Crussaders were not
&gt; fundamentalists - they were extremists. Just as the KKK, IRA, Nazi's, Pol
&gt; Pot - and all like minded - are/were equally extremists.

ditto muslim extremists that blow things up then?

&gt; Also for the record, if ANYBODY wants to know what fundamentalist
&gt; Christianity teaches, simply read the sermon on the Mount as taught by Jesus
&gt; Himself. (Read Matthew - otherwise refered to as the Beatitudes. Start at
&gt; Matthew Chapeter 5 and finish reading at Matthew Chapter 8.)

hmm i would actually take fundamentalist anythings as absolutists. ie
you are convinced the bible is 100% right. thats fundamental
christianity. so lets look, shall we. lets start with some of my dr laura quotes.
bible quote included fr eddification:))

"I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill
him myself?"
35:2	 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth
work therein shall be put to death.

well? who kills the neighbour?

"I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her
period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how
do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense."
15:19	 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her
shall be unclean until the even.

go ahead - ask. do you ask every woman this? and if not, why not?

heres some of my faves. yes, the devil can quote scripture. shakespeare
said that btw:) its rumoured he was a naughty bisexual too. what a dude!

Leviticus 21:13	  And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
i jolly hope so! widows, you are on your own!!!!

more Leviticus wisdom:
21:16	  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
21:17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the
bread of his God.
21:18	For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any
thing superfluous,
21:19	Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
21:20	Or crookbacked, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

oo. stones broken, jolly nasty that. well, it seems supermodels only get
the bread of god. hope its fat free, you know how fussy they are...


personally, i hope you are treating your slaves well. Exodus is full of
pithy advice:
21:1	  Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
21:2	If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in
the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
21:3	If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
married, then his wife shall go out with him.
21:4	If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons
or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he
shall go out by himself.
21:5	And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,
and my children; I will not go out free:
21:6	Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore
his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.

so, if your servant marries the woman you chose for him, the bible says
you keep the progeny. how simply marvellous for you! of crse, you can be
magnanimous and set him free - but if he loves his family, youy get to
brand him by piercing his ear and keep him always. does workcover know
of this?

&gt; 
&gt; 4 very short examples include:
&gt; 
&gt; M 5:7 "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."  M 5:9
&gt; "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God."  M
&gt; 5: 22-22 "You have heard it ws said to those of old 'you shall not murder'
&gt; and whoever murders will be in dagner of the judgment. But *I* say to you
&gt; that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of
&gt; the judgemnt"  M 5: 38-39 "You have heard that it was said 'an eye for an
&gt; eye and a tooth for a tooth' But *I* tell you not to resist an evil person.
&gt; But whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other to him also."  (I
&gt; could go on for MANY pages - but I'm sure we all get the point)

oh my yes. but wherefore then the invasion of iraq? war on terrorism -
no, no! give them another cheek!

btw, there are clubs that offer such cheek offering activities i
believe:)

&gt; ***THIS*** is fundamentalist Christianity, spoken by the very person who the
&gt;  word defines.  And ANYTHING else is EXTREMIST.


umm, yes. as both our examples show...fundamentalism in all its ummm............

but lets not, to quote philip adams, let a little thing like god come
between us:)
