&gt;&gt; A helluva lot more than taxpayers should be paying...other 
&gt;than that, no comment ;)
&gt;
&gt;But possibly not quite as much as we're paying for EDS to 
&gt;guarantee that the use of MS is encouraged...

That may be partly true, but not entirely, even though it may seem 
that way from the outside.

Certainly the majority of low-mid range solutions provided by EDS are
MS based, but they do quite a bit of highend Unix support as well, and
are not exactly ignorant in the area of Linux and open source , trust
me on that one (any EDS techs on the list??? ;)

The "encouragement" to use MS products is actually generated from the
government side of the fence in most cases, read: policies, policies,
policies ad infinitum...  If the government doesn't ask for open source
solutions, then why would a company supply those solutions?

This is especially true when you think that the outsourcing contracts were
written
a long time ago when open source was very much in the backroom and away from
the public agenda, unlike its current status.

Anyway, I wasn't going to comment :)
