&gt; &gt; Matt,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But does anyone really care that much ?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Not now that Iraq's oilfields have been freed from a terrible regime
&gt; &gt;&gt; and have been able to start rebuilding their country, safe from those
&gt; &gt;&gt; nasty chemical weapons...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What chemical weapons?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; :(
&gt;
&gt; The ones he used against the kurds killing thousands just after the Gulf
&gt; War finished.

Bah...  There's no disputing Sadam used inhuman weapons against his own
people, or his neigbours (Iran) although (in his 'defence') I wonder why
no-one points out that Iran also used both chemical AND bioligical weapons
against Iraq, and/or contemplates invading them for the same reasons?

But apart from that obviously LONG argument - there's also no disputing that
Mr. Bush is on a witch hunt in the middle east which is nothing more than a
knee jerk reaction to 9-11.  It's the same old story of needing a 'scape
goat' in times of extreme trouble that can be traced back to Adam and Eve.

After all (according to the Bible) when God asked Adam why he'd dissobeyed,
Adam responded, "It wasn't MY fault, it was the woman you gave me!
(Translation: It was actualy God's fault not Adam's)  Eve replied to the
same question, "It was the Serpant!" (Translation: It was the devil's fault,
not mine)  This is exactly the same thing, but a different spin...

Was Saddam ever intending on using WOMD (Weapons Of Mass Destruction) on
anything more than his local neighbours? (Iran, Kurdistan) I personally
don't think so; otherwise when he (Saddam) knew he was going down he would
have used them at least once. (Can everyone really believe they didn't have
at least one opportunity during the invasion of Iraq?)

No, as much as I agree that he should have gone - let's put this into TRUE
perspective and recognise that as bad a man as he truly might be - he is not
the incarnation of evil that the Allies are painting him up to be...  Just a
scape goat that the Allies managed to 'use' to kill three birds with one
stone on. (Scape goat, Protect oil and stabilise region, by ammasing huge
numbers of troops in region)

On a side note: Is Mr. Bush actually a Christian?  According to the frutis
of his life, I severly question this.  One thing is certain, he's being used
to set the stage for the final Armageddon as foretold in The Bible. (Read
Revelations for yourself)
