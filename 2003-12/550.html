Any reason you can't just download the packages? They are only about
200MB or so.

I've found Dropline to be very cutting-edge, unless you are running
Gentoo on the unstable it will be a bit behind dropline in updates. I
consider this a good thing, but it could get annoying to be fairly
continuously downloading updated packages.

Coupled with swaret (slackware update package), it is nearly as good as
running gnome, but without the compile times :)

&gt; I understand where you're coming from and optimising for my CPU, etc. was a

&gt; really like Slack 9.1 AND I liked Gentoo as well and it's a tough choice.
&gt; :-) I guess using Slack would make me a Linux purist and using 'Linux From
&gt; Scratch' or Gentoo would make me a Linux fundamentalist, eh? :-D

&gt; Hi Corey,

&gt; &gt; Hi guys.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I recently changed jobs and so lost my subscription to this list but I'm
&gt; &gt; back now. I also, unfortunately, lost a lot of helpful email addresses,
&gt; &gt; including the address of a lovely guy who offered to give me Dropline
&gt; GNOME
&gt; &gt; for my Slack distro. I used to work at AHA if that's any help. If you're
&gt; &gt; still out there, can I still grab that off you?
&gt; 
&gt; Download Dropline Gnome here -&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.dropline.net/gnome/download.php">http://www.dropline.net/gnome/download.php</A>
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also I recently gave Slack 9.1 a run and I think it's fabulous. I tried
&gt; &gt; Gentoo and I found that although it's outstanding, the performance
&gt; &gt; difference between Slack and Gentoo seemed negligible. Considering the
&gt; days
&gt; &gt; of configuration (emerge kde was particularly painful with emerge -p
&gt; system
&gt; &gt; right behind it) required, is there something I'm missing (other than
&gt; &gt; Portage) which would compel me to give it another go?
&gt; 
&gt; Go with whatever you feel most comfortable with.
&gt; 
&gt; I was a die-hard Slackware user until I switched to Gentoo around
&gt; Slackware 8.
&gt; 
&gt; My personal reason for the switch was that Gentoo has package management
&gt; & Slackware doesn't.
&gt; By package management, I mean be able to install/uninstall programs AND
&gt; be able to handle cross-package dependencies.
&gt; 
&gt; Gentoo does take a while to install a fully fledged desktop with all the
&gt; bells & whistles (around 3 days on an XP 1800+, 512MB RAM), as it's not
&gt; a binary based distro like Slack, Redhat, Mandrake & most others.
&gt; But once setup & running, it takes little to no effort to maintain &
&gt; upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Rick
