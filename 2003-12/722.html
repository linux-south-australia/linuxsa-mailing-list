Howdy,

A FIXIT I'd really like to see is a "Debian Release FIXIT".  Something 
that bothers me about Debian is the state of the current three 
'releases':

- stable
- testing
- unstable

Stable is indeed stable; but due to the mentality (which has 
advantages, I don't want to change this), packages are awfully out of 
date (as the release stays the same as when stable was 'frozen', and 
only bug/security fixes are backported), and if you want to do anything 
even half interesting, you're almost forced to backport.  Things can 
get ugly - you try installing a recent version of Request Tracker on 
Woody (which requires a very recent Perl, Mason, CPAN modules, and 
everything that depends on these).  Ask DSL, who's been attempting this 
for the last few days - forget it.

Unstable isn't terribly unstable; it's great on desktop systems, but 
you certainly wouldn't want to run a server you don't monitor 
continually on it - broken packages make their way in all the time, and 
sometimes its disastrous (personal experiences include a broken 
mysql/postgresql that kills all databases, broken fsck that kills 
partitions on boot, broken lilo breaks bootup, the list goes on).

Testing would be brilliant to run on a server, except it seems to be 
used (and fairly enough) more to propose the next Stable release; grab 
a seemingly stable Unstable package, and throw it up for proposed 
release.  Problem is things do often break, and unlike unstable (where 
problems get fixed within hours), things stay in broken states for 
weeks.  Ack - it's unacceptable on a production machine :-(

I'd like to see another official release which has proper policies for 
testing reasonably up to date packages; something like what Testing 
could be, but isn't.  It seems projects such as Fedora are doing this 
(stable, but up to date packages); I don't see why Debian can't.  It's 
my *only* gripe with the project.

I'm the leader of a (yet-to-be-released) project called Qbalt 
(www.qbalt.com), which is essentially a Cobalt-style GUI sitting on top 
of Debian; and I'm planning on maintaining a repository for backports 
in stable solving this problem, but maintaining this could turn into a 
complete headache unless I have support from many, many maintainers; 
there really needs to be an official release that solves this problem, 
IMHO.

I'd run the session, but I fear I won't have time, being the FIXIT 
organizer and all :-(  If this year is anything like last year, plenty 
of Debian people are coming, so it'd probably be a really cool session 
to hold.
