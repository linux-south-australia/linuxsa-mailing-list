I just want to comment on that because the way it's presented makes it seem
like an isolated argument and I feel that that is something that will be
done frequently by a significant number of people who are of the mindset to
consider making such a statement in the first place.

Why should they (pollies) care? A bunch of voters bleating about tax dollars
going to Microsoft isn't going to hold up against all the perceived benefits
(I'm sure the reasonable reader can make up their own list here - then add
to that the IBM-syndrome, too). That is, of course, until there's a risk of
the pollies becoming vote-challenged. The main point here, though, is that
this isn't a stand-alone argument that's likely to carry any weight. It
sounds like a hate-argument and in many cases that's very likely what it is.

&gt; I also see a number of government laws and practices which discriminate
&gt; against open source software.  And I'd like to know what the pollies
&gt; are going to do about that.

This is a much better argument. Pro-OSS arguments will inevitably include a
discussion regarding the potential cost and other benefits of using OSS. The
difficulty of course will ultimately lie in how those benefits are measured
and/or compared.
