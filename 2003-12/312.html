&gt; &gt; This makes  it difficult for users
&gt; &gt; on wireless cards, since they have a habit of dissappearing off the

&gt; &gt; process of smbd is sporned on the server for the user in question,
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; It does this because the client creates a new session.  The old
&gt; session remains because the TCP link hasn't timed out yet (and
&gt; under Unix takes quite a while).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; making me think that the original process somehow turns into a zombie
&gt; &gt; for some amount of time, retaining the lock on the files that were being
&gt; &gt; accessed at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; Depending on how the lock is implemented, a zombie shouldn't be
&gt; holding one (not as a kernel resource, anyway - out of process
&gt; stat is a different matter).  An active process, however, is
&gt; still able to hold locks.  I believe there are options in Samba
&gt; to overcome this, though (although it's been a while since I've
&gt; looked - I'm sure the resident Samba Gurus will jump in,
&gt; workload permitting).

Locks are first placed in Samba's locking (or brl, depending on which 
locks are the problem) and then, if posix locking is not disabled, a POSIX 
lock is also acquired in the case of BRL's.

Since the initiall session, and thus smbd, is still around, the lock has 
to be respected.

I think these sorts of questions should be posted on samba-technical so 
that the Samba team can see how much of a problem they are. 

Perhaps the original person should also log a bug at bugzilla.samba.org 
for us.
