&gt; &gt; &gt;I have played around with autocad a little bit over the years and am
&gt; &gt; &gt;looking for something without a 3 year learning curve. :-)  Basic 2D
&gt; &gt; &gt;drawing is about my level.  I have tended to type autolisp more than
&gt; &gt; &gt;use menus if possible 'cause I am weird.
&gt; &gt; hmm:  QCAD used to be OK 
&gt; &gt; xfig is sort of quirky (old fashioned I guess)  but has it's own joys .
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There are a lot of 2D level apps about most of them get only so far.
&gt; &gt; Others require Java (some particular version larger than hades) ..
&gt; &gt; If you find a good one let us know..
&gt; &gt; Meantime I always found qcad reasonable.. scaling aside.

Somewhat OT : the latest release of blender is simply marvellous.
Strictly 3D, but you can do reasonable 2D with it. Not 100% sure what
your application is - if you want a drafting style app where you can
manually enter dimensions, then blender can do that, but its not quite
the same.

Most of my customers seem to use AutoCAD mechanical desktop, with the
more sensible guys on Catia. Id love to get something running on Linux
that does that job. I have played with the idea of going in from scratch
with a C compiler (yeah OK, Im a masochist), till it occurred to me that
maybe adding on hacks to blender might do the trick.  Next year maybe ..

I have heard that AutoCAD will never ever ever be ported up to Unix ,
simply because 90% of it's codebase uses really dumb non-portable hacks
deep into the undocumented parts of the WindowsAPI, to a point where
even Wine has no idea what it's trying to achieve.

Anyone managed to get AutoCAD running under a full emulator, like VMWare
or even bochs ?
