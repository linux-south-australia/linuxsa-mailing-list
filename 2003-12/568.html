&gt; &gt; Bush is actually a Southern Baptist which I guess means he believes in
&gt; &gt; the same God as other Christians. However, If I were Christian, I'd be
&gt; &gt; distinctly unnerved to be identified with a group of people who are
&gt; &gt; only a few short steps away from being just as fundamental as some of
&gt; &gt; the more fundamental Muslim sects.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Can you please identify the buildings that Southern Baptists have blown
&gt; up?  Or perhaps the suicide bombings that have been performed by it's
&gt; adherents?  What about aircraft hijackings, how many of those have been
&gt; done by "fundamental" Christans?
&gt; 
Mc Veigh and Karesh come to mind as faithful christian fundamentalists.
You want more ?

Bush, Howard and Hitler are arguably a few other christian murderers for
you to have on your side.

Killing for votes sucks.


&gt; Perhaps instead of stereotyping large groups of people you most likely
&gt; know nothing about, let us just agree that violence and violent attacks
&gt; are wrong, and that most typically people who perform them are misguided
&gt; in their belief that any deity will be pleased, or that any group whose
&gt; causes they are promoting will be any better off by their actions.
&gt; 
&gt; Can we resume normal programming now?

Sure, but you did ask.
