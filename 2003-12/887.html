&gt; &gt; A group of politicians have kindly agreed to appear on a panel at the
&gt; &gt; Linux and Open Source in Government conference, to be held in Adelaide
&gt; &gt; in January.  I am canvassing ideas for questions to ask them.  What
&gt; &gt; would *you* ask a politician regarding Linux and Open Source if you
&gt; &gt; had the opportunity?
&gt; 
&gt; What about something like;
&gt; 
&gt;   - What is the SA Government doing to support local businesses that
&gt;     employ programmers/designers etc to build and support Opensource
&gt;     software that is heavily used in Australia Business and Government?

So open source is just another "special interest" group asking for
a handout?

Personally, I don't want to see any of my taxes go into "supporting"
open source.  If the concept is right then it should be able to
stand on its own two feet.

What I do have a problem with is that a lot of my taxes are going
to supporting Microsoft.  And I'll like to know what the pollies
are going to do about that.

I also see a number of government laws and practices which discriminate
against open source software.  And I'd like to know what the pollies
are going to do about that.

Some specific questions:

 - Copyright Act

   Why are the reverse engineering and circumvention provisions of
   the Copyright Act so narrow that there are doubts about the ability
   of games console owners to run whatever software they wish.

   Do you support the imprisonment of programmers which allow
   DVDs to be played in the wrong region.  If not, do you support
   the current Copyright Act clauses which have this penalty?

 - Acquisition

   How was the ATO permitted to develop an application computing
   architecture which locked them into one supplier?

   The SA govt promised regulation rather than legislation to ensure
   that open source alternatives are considering during acquisition.
   This acknowledges the inability of the Internet to take CEOs to
   lunch.  What is the current state of the proposed regulations?
   Why haven't the local AUUG and Linux groups been consulted to date?

 - FTA

   Will the US-AU FTA bring DCMA-style legislation to Australia?

   Does the FTA require Australia to acknowledge software patents?
   Does it require enforcement of US software patents?

 - Patent

   Australia's Innovation Patents are the worst of all worlds.  They
   cost little, are applicable to software, and cost the same to
   object to as a standard patent.  Is this going to be fixed before
   we end up with a patent system which is even less functional for
   software than that in the USA?

   Why are patents applicable to software anyway, when the possibility
   of re-invention is so high (three people independently "invented"
   the computer within years of each other, computer science literature
   abounds with re-invention of earlier forgotten work).  Why is
   "innovation" encouraged when "consistency" is often more important
   (imagine if car manufacturers "innovated" with steering, gear
   and brake controls).
