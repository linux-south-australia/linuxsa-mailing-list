&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you please identify the buildings that Southern Baptists have
&gt; &gt;&gt; blown up?  Or perhaps the suicide bombings that have been performed by
&gt; &gt;&gt; it's adherents?  What about aircraft hijackings, how many of those
&gt; &gt;&gt; have been done by "fundamental" Christans?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Mc Veigh and Karesh come to mind as faithful christian fundamentalists.
&gt; &gt; You want more ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Unbelieveable garbage.  David Karesh claimed to be god himself.  I don't
&gt; think you objectively group these dellusional types in with normal
&gt; society.

mcveigh claimed to hear what god wanted, the voice of god directly . 
the god hotline, as it were. jimmy jones, jonestown suicides.


this is no different from most saints, btw. and many inmates of asylums. 
and many evangelists.the shah of iran used to see shiite saints. 
other side of world, holy virgin type lourdes visions. conclusions?


oh, re fundy christians - the crusades, the inquisitions, the kkk, and the 
suicide squad of judea, btw;)


&gt; &gt; Bush, Howard and Hitler are arguably a few other christian murderers
&gt; &gt; for you to have on your side. 
&gt; Shaun, with all due respect, your biases are embarrasing.


beep. sorry, the point is these guys are devout christians who order mass
death. is that ok? 

&gt; &gt;&gt; Can we resume normal programming now?
&gt; &gt; Sure, but you did ask.
&gt; Please.


the trouble here is reality is subjective peeps;)))

i personally find isms dangerous. always starting as a good idea that
ends being extreme, each one convinced of its absloute rightness. give
me my wishy washy opinions for faith, anyday. noone gets hurt, noone has
to share them:))))

now, if we want a reality to return to, 
MY reality involves chocolate donations. 

NOW.
