[BJC&gt;] previously the fake "we got mentioned in parliament" line
Rubbish. Plagiarism has been occuring over the millenia. There's NOTHING
innovative about the dominant religion in Australia at all.
[BJC&gt;] Well that's a non sequitur par excellence. But Oz does not have a
dominant religion anymore (unless you're counting sport and body worship).
Besides which 
I suggest the innovation is "The ability to morph topics such as `We got
mentioned in parliament' into topics that have nothing to do with the
mention, parliament or any individual word in the topic even taken
stupidly out of context.".

[BJC&gt;] This is truly a waste of ether now. Arguing over what is innovation
is like working out whose fault the car accident was before the you just
take the injured to hospital. Get on and do it!, although a lot on this list
mostly enjoy talking about it.
But arguing over semantics of what constitutes innovation has to come to an
end eventually. So get on and innovate, (any definition is good enough for
the worker) But nonetheless, for what it is worth:
"and what has been done is what will be done, there is nothing new under the
sun" (ECC 1:9 RSV).. :-)
