Scott,

&gt; I am looking at setting up a helpdesk system in not for profit
&gt; organisation I am currently working for based on the open source Request
&gt; Tracker (RT) software located at
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/">http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/</A>

In my opinion, RT is to ticket tracking systems as The Gimp is to image
manipulation programs. There are others but all roads lead to RT.

CONS:

 1. RT's security model is configurable to collapse

 2. RT's depencies are absolutely amazing (if there were a package called
    Kitchen Sink it would most likely depend on it)

 3. RT's user interface is sort of getting better but still quite
    non-intuitive until you're used to it

PROS:

 1. All roads lead to RT

 2. If you need a request tracker that can sing like Mariah Carey, well, RT
    is your best bet

    [this is a round about way of saying that it should do everything you
     need and more]

 3. As you've identified it works by e-mail (IF you can deciper how to do
    this - you can't RTFM - it's just NOT there)

 4. You can also work RT3 via commandline, but same caveat as (3). The
    answer to RTFM in RT is often "What documentation?"

&gt; Just wondering before I start out on this journey if anyone has some
&gt; hints/tips or useful howtos ??  Anyone had any experience and can
&gt; recommend a suitable distro???

Debian Unstable will run it. DO NOT try to backport it to Debian Woody
(Stable). You'll end up backporting glibc and ALL the perl modules which
will mean you may as well run unstable *anyway*.

I think it will go onto Fedora or RedHat 9.0 or SuSE 9.2 or Mandrake
(latest) without a glitch. I've not heard of it running on a *BSD but I'm
sure that it would.

TIPS:

 * if you can get a lighter solution, you may find it less hassle

 * if you want bells, whistles and even more, then use it

 * don't expect to get it setup right the first five times; it will
   inevitably fall over

 * don't expect a nice, intuitive interface

 * don't expect there to be any *useful* documentation
