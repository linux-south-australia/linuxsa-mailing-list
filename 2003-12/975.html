&gt;&gt;&gt; So we start to see the begining of what SCO are up to.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They have always been complaining about ABIs in various
&gt;&gt;&gt; other free or opensourec unicies...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; SCO clamin that these APIs were used without their
&gt;&gt;&gt; permisson.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; My understanding is that an ABI or API cannot have a copyright placed over
&gt;&gt; it, but that the text that expresses these ideas can.
&gt;
&gt; If these APIs, specifically in Linux were derived from published
&gt; texts, is this still valid? (I don't know which is why I'm asking)
&gt;
&gt; I can't image that lots of the Linux kernel developers would have
&gt; had access to UNIX source code in early versions of Linux when
&gt; these interfaces were made...(set in stone?)

FWIW, the header files aren't considered part of the UNIX source
code.  They were distributed with the development system, and some
files were distributed with the base system.  My favourite one was
/etc/fstab, which as shipped consisted in its entirety of a copyright
notice.  Since it was there, I couldn't remove it (though I suppose I
could have renamed the file and created a new one), but it gives you
an idea how stupid some of these copyright claims are.
