&gt; I agree. I think it's important that an issue such as this isn't

&gt; &gt; Innovation is a red herring.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; F/OSS is no more about innovation than closed source 
&gt; &gt; development. Mostly it is about building workable software.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Innovation is an individual pursuit, and could happen on any 
&gt; &gt; platform and with any license.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A particular company sometimes uses the word 'innovation' where 
&gt; &gt; other people might use the word 'commercialization', 'refinement 
&gt; &gt; of an existing idea' or 'theft'.

When the dinosaurs went extinct the hithertoo uninteresting mammals were 
able to radiate out and occupy many more niches than were previously 
available, and the brought different solutions to the same problems that 
the dinosaurs were trying to solve.

OSS is a very fertile breeding ground of ideas and techniques. There are 
lots of companies out there who are building solutions around OSS, and to 
me, the truly useful thing about OSS is that we engineers who are building 
these systems get all of the source code. That includes the OS, the tool 
chain and all the utilities. If we find a problem or a non-optimal part of 
any one of them, we can fix it ourselves.

For a start-up, a problem in any of the software that we use could be a 
life-and-death matter. However, these problems are rarely of any interest 
to the large software vendors, and the time lost in explaining the problem 
to even a small vendor becomes a major nuisance, and given that the OSS 
solutions out there are usually at least adequate to the task initially, a 
commercial solution needs to have a a very big advantage.

For many start-ups, it comes down to risk management, and I feel that an 
increasingly large number of user organizations are going to start seeing 
it that way as well.
