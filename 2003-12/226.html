Perhaps.  Network access to computer systems was already State of the art,
as was graphic interfaces.  Network graphic access might have been new,
which means X11, the result of a consortium of business and academia
might have, been innovative in some ways.

As you say, neither was innovative.


&gt; How about a _really_ old example of innovation. Emacs.

Now that's a good example.  An extensible display editor was, I think,
quite a new idea.  Mind you, like X11 it dates back to the 70s (or was
it 80s.)


&gt; What about TeX?

A new typesetting system but not a new idea.  Even the idea of macros
for TeX, e.g. LaTeX, was predated by the Unix roff systems and their
many macro libraries.

Automated document classification, and learned-rules, is really very,
very old.


I'm disappointed that the best that's been put forward to my "challenge"
are academic offerings dating back well into the last century.  I'm not
awfully surprised; the open source community seems to be hell-bent on
immitation, and I might say also on beating Microsoft.

What's the point in open source if the best we can do is destroy products,
such as Photo Shop and Quicken, which are the results of large expenditure
in time and money?  Immitation is easy, but not a noble cause.
