&gt; &gt; &gt; I am with you on this. Makes no sense to me either.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, since some of the people who are involved are in the high 
&gt; &gt; performance computing (HPC) world, and they want a RH-like (RPM-
&gt; &gt; based) distro to move to, it makes a lot of sense to me.
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't this what Fedora's aiming to do; that is, a RH-like community distro?
&gt; 
&gt; I personally don't see why we need /another/ distro; there's already a million
&gt; bazillion out there, and there's plenty long established with the same goals
&gt; cAos certainly seems to have in mind.  Combining efforts seems far more
&gt; sensible, IMHO.

Isn't this like saying, why do we need another of anything?

If people handn't decided that they needed something better than valves, 
we would not have transistors and ICs etc.

If Linus hadn't decided that none of the existing choices was good enough, 
we wouldn't have Linux.

If Gerald Combs hadn't decided that he wanted something better, we 
wouldn't have Ethereal today, 

and so on.

These people have decided they can do a better job and want to give it a 
go.
