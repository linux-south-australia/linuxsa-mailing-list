&gt; Thinking about the first paragraph, about killing innovation:  I have
&gt; an idea for a product which I intend to develop.  It's going to cost
&gt; $250,000+ to develop, uses commodity PC hardware costing about $300
&gt; per unit to manufacture, will retail for about $500+, and I expect to
&gt; sell a million of them in the third year.  Would you be interested in
&gt; investing your money in this project?  If the device was GPLed would
&gt; you still be interested?  Do you think the GPL might worry investors?

Deciding to GPL the software may open up development opportunities you
wouldn't have if you decide to take the proprietary route. For example
you could incorporate code from other GPL software, reducing both the
development time and cost.

Perhaps the money upfront required would now be low enough that you
wouldn't need to get any external investors. Sure, you would most
likely get competitors sooner, but going the proprietary route won't
stop that either - but all of the profit would be yours instead of
mostly going to the investors.
