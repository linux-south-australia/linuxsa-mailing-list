&gt;&gt;Could it be that being able to build on, from and with other work more 
&gt;&gt;easily is what makes Open Source potentially (seem) more innovative, 
&gt;&gt;with a potentially larger scope of creative input?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We're going in circles.  This is the same as the second suggestion on
&gt;how GPL is innovative, and the answer then, as now, is that academia
&gt;has been doing exactly that for centuries.  For that matter, so has
&gt;industry.
&gt;  
&gt;
I didn't say the GPL is innovative, I said that it can be percieved to 
allow more potential for innovation due to the open way the code can be 
worked on.

&gt;&gt;Can anyone think of something (anything) that is dramatically innovative 
&gt;&gt;at all with regards to anything?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Flying machines.  Steam engine.  Nuclear power.  Radar.  Laser.
&gt;Silicon chip.  Printed circuits.  Arabic numbers.  The number zero.
&gt;Imaginary numbers.  Symbolic logic.  Machine-portable software.  WIMP.
&gt;Quicksort.  Alpha-beta pruning.  Electronic mail.  Shall I go on?
&gt;  
&gt;
They are all incremental. The ideas are not original in their own right.

Flying machines copy birds and apply aerodynamics etc... Electronic mail 
uses a new medium to implement snail mail. WIMP copies the desktop. 
Printed circuits are an improvement on wiring, which is an 
implementation of a channel. Quicksort is a development on stone 
swapping. Arabic numbers are an expansion on fingers.

While my examples might not be completely technically acurate, they do 
shed light on the point I am trying to make.

Or does this mean that expansion of, or a different way of doing, an 
existing idea is innovation?

Is discovery innovation? Where does discovery end and innovation begin?

Dale.
