Hi Kim,

&gt; Forums are often very disorganised and horribly complex creatures.
&gt;
Having been involved with CompuServe Forums for many years even to the 
point of managing one of them for 5 years I would say I have a fair 
idea of how a GOOD one can work. Lets face it, CompuServe invented 
Forums, heck, they even have a patent on the word Forum. 

All other Forum software is a clone trying to be as good as CompuServe. 
IMHO.

Some do it well. Many are just crappy. Some are downright awful.

What doesn't change is the workload for the Moderator / Administrator / 
Manager or whatever title they might have.
It is always considerable and for a list of this size and posting rate 
it would be some hours per night especially if there was a sudden 
posting rush like we have seen over the last few days.

My average consumption of messages while a Forum Manager was around 400 
a night. Some nights I had to wade through 600 or so messages or just 
get too far behind. Shifting messages in or out or around, seeding in 
good items, sorting out fights, answering questions - it is all work 
that somebody has to do behind the scenes. Sure I had some volunteer 
staff but I still read every message so I knew what was being said and 
who was doing all the talking.

I am a great believer in using what works and not trying to fix 
something by creating an even bigger workload for somebody else - or 
yourself.

I love working in Forums and still spend many hours on the CompuServe 
Network but I don't want to see this list become a web-based Forum - NO 
WAY!

 Cheers,
 Ian
