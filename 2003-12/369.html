&gt; &gt; By the same token, a lot of what propietary software organizations produce 
&gt; &gt; is also not innovative. Much of the work is preceeded by University-based 
&gt; &gt; research that the propietary orgs are simply leveraging off of.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with that.  It's easy to understand why open source software
&gt; tends to be an immitation of proprietary software: cheaper, more robust,
&gt; can add new features, and so on.  Also, the research for true innovation
&gt; is usually quite time consuming, and if you're not being paid for it it
&gt; can be hard to justify the expense in time.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you think that fear of open source immitating results might discourage
&gt; businesses from doing research?  Or encourage them to seek strong
&gt; intellectual property protection on what they do?

I think that very few companies will enter an area where there is an 
established open source competitor. Things are becoming commoditised.

Businesses do need to think about OSS immitations these days. Our CTOs 
attitude is that someone is going to reverse engineer your product some 
day, whether it is a competitor or the OSS community. From that 
perspective, companies should be researching ideas that are very 
innovative, establish a lead and try to stay in front. There are always 
things that companies can do that OSS can't. 

As for strong IP protection, unless you have something innovative, prior 
art will abound, so strong IP protection will not be much use. Also, I 
think that far too many companies are taking the approach of suing their 
customers (using the DMCA or any other piece of legistlation they have 
convinced the US Congress to enact) and have forgotten why they are in 
business: To serve their customers.

Glen's email of a day or so ago reminds me of a very good article about 
why the music industry is failing. They have forgotten why they can charge 
a profit. I wish I could find the article. Talks about taking the risk of 
finding music that customers want to hear. Instead, they serve up the crap 
they want to sell.
