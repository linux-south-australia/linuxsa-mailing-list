If someone _really_ wants the interface of a forum, yet people don't like the 
idea of splitting over several areas of communication, one with sufficient 
time and motivation could always come up with a forumesque interface to the 
mailing list. subscribe to the list, whatever comes in can be put into 
relevant threads (email clients can do it, so it's certainly doable), and 
anyone who wants to submit has to log in with their email address, which is 
what's used to post to the list, hence the forum email addy won't get 
blacklisted if you get a bunch of trolls using it.
I expect that html could/would be disabled for the forum as well.
Some people like forums, some like mailing lists, but just having both doesn't 
mean you have to split things up.

*waits for flames from people worried about giving a html interface to the 
list, and the forumers who think running off of a mailing list is blasphemy*
