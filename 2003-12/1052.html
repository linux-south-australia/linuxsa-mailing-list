In my experience, hard internal modems are near impossible to find anymore.
Hard externals are still everywhere and both internal and external softs are
everywhere. I myself use a hard external modem (Swansmart Turbo II) and it's
had zero trouble being picked up in every linux distro and Unix I've tried
(RH7.3, 8, 9, Mdk 9.1, Gentoo 1.4, Debian Woody, Slack 9.0, 9.1, FreeBSD
5.1, Knoppix 3.2, Vector Linux SOHO 3.2). I did have trouble in Gentoo until
I realised that I'd forgotten to emerge ppp.......... :-D

Peter,

&gt; I can download Linux drivers from linuxant.com but they cost
&gt; money. That's not such a big deal, except it seems a great pity that I
&gt; have to deal with the hassle of doing that.

They cost money? Hmmm, so they do.

&gt; Now what is going on here? Is it:
&gt; 
&gt; (a) It's impossible to get a real modem anymore, and all Linux users
&gt; download software drivers like from Linuxant;

No, that's not true.

&gt; (b) It's easy to get a real modem, I just need to shop around;

This is true. You could also attempt to get them to bring in a Lucent
chipset modem. Ever visited:

 * <A HREF="http://www.linmodems.org/">http://www.linmodems.org/</A>

&gt; (c) I don't know what I'm talking about, there is no difference
&gt; between "hard" and "soft" modems. :-)

There is a big difference between a soft and hard modem. A soft modem makes
the CPU/operating system do a lot more work than a hard modem does.
 
&gt; If the answer is (b) I'd appreciate knowing a type of modem
&gt; (preferably internal) which is easy to get in Adelaide. The computer
&gt; shop seems cooperative and I suspect they'd get it for me if I asked.

Ask them for *anything* that is *not* a soft modem ;-) If they can't get you
one or won't, get a better supplier. It's not your job to do their job.
