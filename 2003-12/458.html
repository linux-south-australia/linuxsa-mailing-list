Hi,
Even the ATO is realising Word can't be read by everyone.
A few days after I sent the reply below, I got an email accepting my 
Electronic Commerce Interface, (ECI), registration.

I'm sure ATO staff are frustrated that they can't even do their job 
properly when their clients can't read the information they send them!

Next step: Convince the ATO to produce an ECI that works on all PCs!

Dear Carmel,
Thankyou for your request for identity documents.
Unfortunately, you have included an attachment in MS Word format which 
is not designed to be cross-platform & I am unable to read it properly.

Can you please send the information as a plain text email or, if the 
document contains pictures or special formatting, Portable Document 
Format, (*.pdf).

 &gt; Dear Mr Pilkington,

 &gt;
 &gt; Please find attached a list of acceptable documents to establish this 
evidence of identity. If you wish to send photocopies rather than 
original documents (this is advisable), please have the photocopies 
certified as true and accurate copies of the original by a Justice of 
the Peace. Should you choose to send original documents, we will return 
these to you by registered mail. Any correspondence should be marked for 
my attention and faxed or posted to:

&gt;&gt;wftd - oo hasnt let me down yet, and the other end is always suprised
&gt;&gt;("what, it ISNT word???")
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; LOL.  Only yesterday I was convincing a user that PDF was more suited 
&gt; to document distribution than Word.  They couldn't quite understand that
&gt; not everyone has Word on their PC (or MAC ;)
