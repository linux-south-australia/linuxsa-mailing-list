&gt;  &gt; &gt; used alot but I just haven't seen it that much?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Yeah, it's a useful thing to use but:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; - it means you HAVE to be root to run things in /etc/inittab
&gt;  &gt; (ie. to edit
&gt;  &gt; the file, kill -1 1 to reread inittab etc
&gt; 
&gt; Just a note here and I do not know the difference but in the man page 
&gt; for init it says that the re-read functionality is in the "q|Q" flag 
&gt; (init q).  This re-reads the inittab immediately.

init q is the Linux way,
while kill -1 1 is the (Free)BSD way, IIRR.

they are equivalent for their respective platforms, IIRR

&gt;  &gt; - you have to edit a relatively critical file to change how it starts
&gt;  &gt; - it's harder to integrate into a package system (eg. look
&gt;  &gt; how easy it is to
&gt;  &gt; drop in files into the rcX.d hierarchy and then remove them
&gt; 
&gt; Well I would consider this to be a familiarity thing rather than a pro 
&gt; or con about operational ability.  I do realize that this is a standard 
&gt; place for linux (but limited to) and it's process startup scripts.  If I 
&gt; remember correctly there is a FS standard out there that although I've 
&gt; lost the link to it specifies that programs' init scripts should be kept 
&gt; in these directories.

I think is a lower level issue than that.
Yes there are a stack of standards that folks should follow about
where to start services, for a given platform.

I think the issue is that there are a few embedded developers who
moved to this 'standard' to remove all the overhead of startup
scripts in 97-98 for embedded hardware, where startup times were
critical to having a perceived 'good' blackbox product.

i remember reading a few documents at the time that refer to
'lightening quick'(TM) startup times for embedded Linux servers, etc.

however, for a general purpose server, this is probably not the
'right way' and you would be better sticking to the distributions
package management approach to runnin services.

especially if you intend on using this thing a lot, playing with
config files a lot or run lots of other services too.

&gt;  &gt; - inittab tends to be more useful for very stable tasks which
&gt;  &gt; don't need a
&gt;  &gt; lot of "interaction" from inittab.  If something tries to
&gt;  &gt; restart too often
&gt;  &gt; etc you can lose control of the machine more easily.
&gt;  &gt; - you have to be root or have root access ...
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; [I'm not quite sure why you claim bind needs multiple files 
 &gt;  &gt; changed for a single change]
&gt; 
&gt; Well what I meant to say was adding (via text editor) not changing an 
&gt; entry to bind requires multiple edits (unless things have changed), for 
&gt; PTR and A/CNAME/MX among possibly others.

yup.

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
