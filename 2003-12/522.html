Hi Corey,

&gt; Hi guys.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently changed jobs and so lost my subscription to this list but I'm
&gt; back now. I also, unfortunately, lost a lot of helpful email addresses,
&gt; including the address of a lovely guy who offered to give me Dropline GNOME
&gt; for my Slack distro. I used to work at AHA if that's any help. If you're
&gt; still out there, can I still grab that off you?

Download Dropline Gnome here -&gt;

&gt; Also I recently gave Slack 9.1 a run and I think it's fabulous. I tried
&gt; Gentoo and I found that although it's outstanding, the performance
&gt; difference between Slack and Gentoo seemed negligible. Considering the days
&gt; of configuration (emerge kde was particularly painful with emerge -p system
&gt; right behind it) required, is there something I'm missing (other than
&gt; Portage) which would compel me to give it another go?

Go with whatever you feel most comfortable with.

I was a die-hard Slackware user until I switched to Gentoo around
Slackware 8.

My personal reason for the switch was that Gentoo has package management
& Slackware doesn't.
By package management, I mean be able to install/uninstall programs AND
be able to handle cross-package dependencies.

Gentoo does take a while to install a fully fledged desktop with all the
bells & whistles (around 3 days on an XP 1800+, 512MB RAM), as it's not
a binary based distro like Slack, Redhat, Mandrake & most others.
But once setup & running, it takes little to no effort to maintain &
upgrade.

Cheers,
Rick
