<H1>Part time linux work in 2004 - any takers ?</H1>

Got some Linux support work coming up in the new year, with a mixed bag
of sites.  

On behalf of my customers, Im looking for people to put into these
places for part time work, pls drop me a line over the holidays if UR
interested, or know someone perfect for the role(s). Probably 2 days a
week 9-5, with the ability to drop in for a few more sessions as
required. 

Im not a recruiter - I just code.

I have a number of small manufacturing customers with a variety of
cultures - from harley riding steel workers through to more corporate
types, so will be needing people who are culturally flexible.

Basically, all of these customers do real-life non-computer related work
which generates an income, and we are there to manage a few simple Linux
based computer systems to make their life easier. They are all highly
intelligent and competent people, but they are not kernel hackers, so
they need a hand with the systems.  (And VB experts, or other MS-related
human tragedies can cause serious damage to a nicely running system -
hence this job ad is only posted on Linux lists).

At the heart of the systems is a single Linux machine - and an
Apache/PHP/MySQL app.  The app is young and growing - not complete, and
never will be.

Non-Puta Duties will involve :
- Mostly acting as an interface between reality and the computer system.
- Be able to understand what people are doing in real life work (be it
welding, recording music, or whatever) before trying to apply any
software to the problem. 
- Be able to take on project management responsibilities for non-puta
related work  (ie - We need to get this Widget installed at a customer
by next week, and we have run out of Thingamee-Bobs, and Fred is still
in Queensland till Jan .. whatawedo whatawedo ?)

Puta-Related Duties will involve :
- Look after Linux servers, samba, firewall, squid, security patches,
that sort of thing. You will have free reign in whatever areas where you
know your stuff.
- Be the first point of contact for day to day desktop PeeCee issues (my
printer is out of ink, my sound does not work today, etc)
- Be able to knock out the occasional spreadsheet, format a quote, put
together a presentation for a major customer, etc. 
- Watch the way others use computers, and teach them as they go.
- Consistently evangelize on the benefits of Linux and the Evils of
Microsoft. Most of the subjects have strayed on the wrong path, and you
shall act as their sheppard in nuturing and guiding them towards the
wholesome light.
- Migration of functionality from Windows to Linux. This may mean taking
existing procedures and software utilities, and designing ways to
incorporate these into the central all-knowing Apache/PHP/MySQL entity. 
- Sensible continuous re-factoring of the computer systems - making the
computer more autonomous, generating less paperwork, requiring less user
input, and more focused/relevant output.
- Documentation and development of training materials for aspects of the
system (with a view to being able to plonk the entire setup into other
companies, and help others migrate from Win-&gt;Lin as well).

The migration part is pretty interesting - at the heart of things is a
big all-encompassing Apache/PHP/MySQL application that looks after the
running of the business. This app is incomplete and under development.
The app is growing at it's own pace, and being implemented in a
non-destructive way.

So, we are not looking for someone who can sit in a corner and
feverishly code all day - these jobs are for Linux savvy people who need
a part-time break from coding, and want some real world contact, and
also to get their hands dirty with fun Windows-&gt;Linux migrations.

This job should also appeal to anyone who is stuck in a corporate
setting, where they are answerable to some Chicken-Headed management
types .. here are some sites where you can go in and build things the
right way, and be answerable (on a tech level) only to yourself.

----------------------
All actual coding of the app is not part of any job spec - it is done
off-site, during odd hours, without deadlines, and on a strictly
voluntary basis - the way that God meant it to be.
