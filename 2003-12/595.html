way.

Subject: Re: OT: not again (was RE: They got him!)


&gt; I have one book in my home that relates to anything that comes close to
&gt; religon,beliefs etc etc.
&gt; .
&gt; The book I make reference to if I have a issues with the powers that be
and
&gt; the is infact a history book written by an ancestor of the great Apache
&gt; Warrior, Geronimo.
&gt; This book was a prohibited import, but thanks to the internet, things do
not
&gt; get so "prohibited"
&gt; (smirk)
&gt;
&gt; In the book, it says;
&gt; "Apaches knew that a power spoke to those with a special purpose. This was
&gt; not regarded as a supernatural phenomenon"
&gt;
&gt; From that paragraph,I form the basis of my beliefs and humbly get on with
my
&gt; life.
&gt; The Apaches were a cool race of people, no books, just what the land and
the
&gt; seasons had to offer.
&gt; If a leaf on a tree had a certain color, it was for a reason and they knew
&gt; what the reason was. That is how so earthly these people were.
&gt; Then along came the European and changed to what it is now.
&gt; The Apaches fought bravely to defend the slaughter of their families and
the
&gt; stealing of their land where they got their feed. They could move with the
&gt; seasons, adapt and adapted well.
&gt; The name Geronimo was inherited due to a particular invasion of a US Army
&gt; fort, the catholick preist was celebrating "St Geronimo's Day", the
indians
&gt; were waiting just as it if it any other normal day, but found it amusing
&gt; when "every 7 suns, the white man did these crazy meaningless dances" (
&gt; church)
&gt; However, on that particular day, the priest came out of his church to do a
&gt; "ritual", and got shot in the heart by an arrow, hence the name "Geronimo"
&gt; It was in retaliation to the slaughter of Geronomo's first wife and
&gt; children. The men were hunting, the soldiers waited, and got to his
&gt; people,children and the elderly.
&gt;
&gt; The book opens with a paragraph from a poem, and I find it to be wisdom
&gt; forgotten to this very day:
&gt;
&gt; "Were half the power,that fills the world with terror,
&gt; Were half the wealth,bestowed on camps and courts,
&gt; Given to redeeem the human mind from error,
&gt; There were no need of arsenals or forts:
&gt;
&gt; "The Arsenal at Springield"
&gt; HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.bartleby.com/102/63.html">http://www.bartleby.com/102/63.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; PS
&gt; After reading the book several times, I can see no real reason why it was
&gt; classified a "prohibited import", other than the embarising political and
&gt; religious truths.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The book is:
&gt;
&gt; Watch for me on the mountain
&gt; Forrest Carter.
&gt;
&gt; After one has read this book, your ??? on politics,human nature and
religion
&gt; will change forever.
&gt; The Apaches did not deserve the genocide, yet Geronimo was never killled,
he
&gt; just adapted when he realized you cannot beat the "Iron Horses" ( steam
&gt; locomotives)
&gt; The movies are full of crap, one must read this book.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mc Veigh and Karesh come to mind as faithful christian

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You want more ?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Unbelieveable garbage.  David Karesh claimed to be god himself.  I
don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; think you objectively group these dellusional types in with normal
&gt; &gt; &gt; society.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; mcveigh claimed to hear what god wanted, the voice of god directly .
&gt; &gt; the god hotline, as it were. jimmy jones, jonestown suicides.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; this is no different from most saints, btw. and many inmates of asylums.
&gt; &gt; and many evangelists.the shah of iran used to see shiite saints.
&gt; &gt; other side of world, holy virgin type lourdes visions. conclusions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; oh, re fundy christians - the crusades, the inquisitions, the kkk, and
the
&gt; &gt; suicide squad of judea, btw;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bush, Howard and Hitler are arguably a few other christian murderers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for you to have on your side.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shaun, with all due respect, your biases are embarrasing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; beep. sorry, the point is these guys are devout christians who order
mass
&gt; &gt; death. is that ok?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can we resume normal programming now?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, but you did ask.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; the trouble here is reality is subjective peeps;)))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i personally find isms dangerous. always starting as a good idea that
&gt; &gt; ends being extreme, each one convinced of its absloute rightness. give
&gt; &gt; me my wishy washy opinions for faith, anyday. noone gets hurt, noone has
&gt; &gt; to share them:))))
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; now, if we want a reality to return to,
&gt; &gt; MY reality involves chocolate donations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; NOW.
