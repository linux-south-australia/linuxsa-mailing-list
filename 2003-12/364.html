&gt; 
&gt; Creating a product worth billions is not the same as generating billions.
&gt; The billions being spent on Linux solutions were previously being spent
&gt; on other platforms, so what Linux is generating is a substantially
&gt; different amount.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, you're mixing the presumption that innovation is good (which I
&gt; agree with), with generating money is good (which I also agree with).
&gt; The two ideas are independant.
&gt; 
&gt; Thinking about the first paragraph, about killing innovation:  I have
&gt; an idea for a product which I intend to develop.  It's going to cost
&gt; $250,000+ to develop, uses commodity PC hardware costing about $300
&gt; per unit to manufacture, will retail for about $500+, and I expect to
&gt; sell a million of them in the third year.  Would you be interested in
&gt; investing your money in this project?  If the device was GPLed would
&gt; you still be interested?  Do you think the GPL might worry investors?
 
This is a good question, and it has complex answers.

If your product involves commodity hardware that can be easily obtained 
and GPL'd software, I think you haven't got a chance in hell of attracting 
investors. 

If you product consists solely of GPL'd software with some fancy packaging 
(like, maybe an installer, and so), you would be laughed out of town in 
today's more realistic market, but only a few years ago you could have 
attracted financing :-(

If you have a serious product idea that actually requires some effort to 
get together and a lot of software development, some of which includes 
some GPL'd software and other OSS software, then you will attract funding.

Companies are doing that today in the Bay area.

So, the answer is, it depends. In any event, very few investors will 
invest in an idea from single person operation.
