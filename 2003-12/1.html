&gt; Want to come out of LCA making a difference to the Open Source

&gt; At other Linux-related conferences, it's common to have BoF sessions;
&gt; this time, we've decided to change things around a bit and turn them
&gt; into FIXIT's. 
&gt; 
&gt; What's a FIXIT you ask? It's basically the same as a BoF, but with an
&gt; intended outcome; that is, hands-on group sessions where you can
&gt; contribute back to open source through discussions and problem solving. 

Here is an idea for a very ambitious project that I think the Open Source 
Software movement needs to tackle ...

If I look at the difference between commercial software (at least that I 
am involved with) and Open Source Software, it is the level of testing 
that we put into our product at Panasas (www.panasas.com).

We test the software in our NAS in a number of different ways:

  - The software must build on a number of platforms and in a number
    of ways (release, debug, lint, etc) before we can push changes to
    the trunk.

  - Performance regressions must not occur whereever possible, and
    are only allowed with management approval. This means running
    SPECsfs and other tests, like IOZONE etc. 

  - Reliability tests are run. These involve long-running tests from
    multiple clients that ensure that memory leaks have not been 
    introduced and that the system does not degrade over long periods
    of time esp with multiple clients.

  - Regression tests are run. These are a growing collection of tests
    that ensure that the functionality is as we expect and that it has
    not been perturbed by recent changes. As bugs are found, we add
    to the regression tests.

Many of these tests are automatable, and the goal would be to automate 
them all.

However, running these kinds of tests requires several things:

1. Hardware. Sometimes lots of hardware. Individuals might not be able
   afford the required hardware, but organizations like OSDL might.

2. Tests. In order to test, you need tests, pure and simple.

3. A testing framework that allows the tests to be run in an automated 
   fashion, and which allows logs of passed, failed, not run, etc tests
   to be kept, perhaps in a database, and that allows new tests to be
   easily developed and contributed. It should also allow large tests
   to be developed. That is, tests that require more than one client
   and perhaps even, more than one machine under test.

So, the thing that I think needs fixing in the Open Source Software 
movement is testing.

Some group of people needs to sit down and come up with a testing 
framework and develop a project to create all the tests that are needed.

DejaGNU seems to have a good start for a testing framework. See:
<A HREF="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/dejagnu/dejagnu.html">http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/dejagnu/dejagnu.html</A>#SEC_Top

At Panasas, we have developed our own testing framework based on one used 
by TCL, and we have added the ability to automatically run tests against 
our platform from [multiple] Windows machines as well.

I think it will make life much easier for those wanting to adopt Open 
Source software if they can point to a [large] battery of tests that the 
software has survived, and creating such a framework and battery of tests 
might well be, at this stage, the biggest single contribution people can 
make to Open Source software.
