&gt; &gt;&gt;    
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;So, the thing that I think needs fixing in the Open Source Software
&gt; &gt;&gt;movement is testing.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;I think most of the tools are out there already - certainly, there's
&gt; &gt;more Unit testing frameworks than you can poke a stick at.  I think
&gt; &gt;a large part of the problem is getting the developers into that
&gt; &gt;particular mindset.

Hmmm, I didn't notice Daryl's comment before, but I want to comment on it.

What I envision/envisage is a large and growing test suite that 
encompassas more than just unit tests. It should get at things like 
multiple clients accessing one or more servers. 

However, I also envision/envisage that anyone can contribute new tests 
(which will be vetted by some core team before being added to the test 
suite) so that anyone who has encountered a problem can write or cause a 
test to be written to cover that situation.

It is the extensibility of the test suite that is important, I think.

It would also be very powerful for vendors and consultants who use open 
source to be able point the test suite and a test run and say that their 
combination of software passed 234,651 tests is the test suite, and that 
the test suite is open-source so anyone can look and see it and determine 
whether or not it is likely that their particular environment is covered.

In today's environment, customers have no idea whether or not commercial 
software vendors have tested anything remotely like their environment.
