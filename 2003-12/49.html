I thought WinFS was a metadata store with NTFS hooks, not
a stand-alone file system.  That changes the considerations
somewhat.

Linux is very focussed on the POSIX filesystem interface,
and that doesn't handle meta-data well.  There's a move
afoot to change that, but its currently happening a
filesystem a a time.

&gt; Does anyone know of OSS Longhorn interoperablility projects?

Disk-format to disk-format interoperability isn't an issue for
enterprises.  They're hardly likely to encourage dual-boot
machines (as one of the OSs is idle, thus making automated
patching a real pain).

It's really more an issue for home.  And as the owner
of a dual-boot machine, I must say the the USB key
(with its FAT filesystem and fully supported by Windows
and Linux) is a fine alternative to mounting the
other operating system's disk.

The interoperability issues that matter to enterprise
are more like "will my Longhorn hosts be able to use
a Samba file server".  The record here is good -- usually
by the time you'd want to do that the Samba Team has
the issues sussed.

Other interop issues remain the same -- floppy disks and
USB keys will be in FAT format for a while longer yet, and
the CD-ROM and DVD formats aren't specific to Windows and
are well documented.

Executive summary:
 - Unlikely that Linux will support WinFS metadata
   for a few years, but lots of non-Microsoft product
   running on Windows won't either in that time period
   so no great downer.

 - Likely that Samba Team will suss whatever MS have
   done with SMB.  In any case, DAV is slowing becoming
   an alternative, and if MS does better integration than
   the  current "web folders" DAV might provide a useful
   fallback to SMB.  Similarly, IPP provides a fallback
   to SMB printing.

 - USB keys provide a fallback for dual-boot machines
   if they are unable to mount the Longhorn NTFS.

 - pGina provides a fallback to whatever Microsoft do
   with ActiveDirectory. pGina allows direct authentication
   against an LDAP directory (which could itself be AD,
   if MS do something truly perverse [ie, require the
   AD server to be Longhorn to support Longhorn hosts,
   something they've done in the past and really sucks
   from a corporate network risk point of view]).

The important point being that there's plenty of
fallback scenarios, so there's no risk of Linux and
Longhorn islands of hosts.
