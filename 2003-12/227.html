&gt; What's the point in open source if the best we can do is destroy products,
&gt; such as Photo Shop and Quicken, which are the results of large expenditure
&gt; in time and money?  Immitation is easy, but not a noble cause.

People using Open Source operating systems need to edit images and manage 
their finances. Since Photoshop and Quicken are neither Free (Speech) or 
available for Open Source operating systems, then the F/OSS crowd need to 
create programs like this. It's not about destroy proprietary software, and 
it's not about imitation. I very much doubt photoshop was the first image 
editing software (and certainly GIMP is nothing like it), and I doubt Quicken 
was the first financial software.

F/OSS development is of the "Scratch an itch" kind, i.e software that has a 
purpose and is useful. Something like clippy doesn't fall into that category 
(i.e. useful).

Btw, I just found something currently in development that you might find 
innovative (at last). It's called dashboard:

<A HREF="http://www.nat.org/dashboard/">http://www.nat.org/dashboard/</A>

I think it uses C# hooks into other GNOME applications to find information on 
what you're currently doing. Take a look at the screenshot. I can already see 
a use for this: Friend on ICQ asks me about an assignment we're doing, so I 
want to open the document for that assignment. Instead of hunting around the 
filesystem for it, I check dashboard first to see if it's already associated 
it for me, and then boom I open it up. Plus it's likely to have any internet 
links or emails on the subject too.

Cheers,

Damien
