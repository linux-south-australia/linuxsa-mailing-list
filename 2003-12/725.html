Wonder if anyone can help here -

I have a samba server, which is set as the domain master browser or some
such thing, but there is a WinXP box on the LAN who keeps taking over as
the domain master.  Every couple of minutes, the samba box is coming
back in forcing an election, it wins the election, but then the XP box
just goes on as if it won anyway.

Dont understand.

btw - The site is remote, Im just gathering info from an ssh session. Im
not there, and I cant go look at the WinXP machine from here.

For what its worth - this is new behavior from the last 48hours, and the
offending WinXP box is also initiating lots of connections on port 445
(typical deloader worm behavior - attacking port 445). Ive just
configured the internal iptables rules to only allow 10 such connections
a minute, so the samba box is not stressing at all. The worm attacks
look like they started after lunch time today, so I think that the 445
attacks and the Domain Master election un-democratic behavior are 2
separate problems.

OK, I understand that I have to make a trip onsite tomorrow by the looks
of things to de-virus the windows machine, but what settings are there
on XP that tell it to be a master browser ?  I really know very little
about the secrets of MS networking.


PS: Had a similar issue with another machine on the same LAN. The kids
got into it, loaded a pile of stuff, and next thing you know, virus
city.  I permanently fixed the problem by turning that PC into a dual
boot machine. The user of the machine just uses Linux now for almost
everything, and there have been no complaints .. interesting. Im going
to have a crack at getting quickbooks running under wine , if that
works, then I can take the 'Boot WindowsXP' option out of grub.conf
permanently.

Cant do the same for the other machine, since they need to run Autodesk
Mechanical Desktop on that.
