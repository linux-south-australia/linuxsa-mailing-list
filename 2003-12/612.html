&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Attached is the Community Testing of Linux FixIT proposal I have submitted 
&gt;for LCA2004 for those who want to get a head start.
&gt;  
&gt;
This is a very important topic IMHO, so, I thought I should try to share 
what little
tangent knowledge I may be able to contribute.  Its accounting speak, 
but I think it
applies.

I hope it doesn't come accross too abrupt or off topic. :-)

In a sense, there is a similarity between what I imagine Community 
testing of Linux to be
and the tests I perform during an audit.  In both situations, the goal 
is to test the system
to see if it is working properly.

&gt;THE PROJECT
&gt;
&gt;This project will develop a testing framework 
&gt;

The accounting industry follows a conceptual framework that
could be used as a starting point and eventually tweaked for the project.

For example, the FASB's "Qualitative Characteristics of accounting
Information" describes the qualities and characteristics that accounting
information should have for it to be useful. My guess is that the
project will need a guideline like that.

<A HREF="http://www.fasb.org/pdf/con2.pdf">http://www.fasb.org/pdf/con2.pdf</A>

The accounting industry had created two other sets of rules additional 
to rule conformity testing procedures:

1. The framework to use when making rules. The FASB's "Qualitative
Characteristics of Accounting Information" is one of these.

2. Rules for specific situations.  (Open Souce may have separate testing 
rules
between DVD players and network shares.)

&gt;Further, the testing framework must allow for tests:
&gt;
&gt; - To be run from and against the same system
&gt;
&gt; - To be run from one system against another system
&gt;
&gt; - To be run from one system while involving muyltiple other client and 
&gt;   server systems
&gt;
&gt; - Possibly even to allow for multiple test drivers.
&gt;  
&gt;
In determining if an amount is free of material error, we test five 
assertions related to it:

1. Existence  (They say they have cash, do they?) [We verify with the 
bank that the cash is there]

Applied to Linux: What are the exact sets of binaries, libraries and 
configuration of configuration file cause the application to "work"?


2. Completeness (Is this everything?) [We ask the bank to tell us if 
they have a loan in case they didn't tell us.]

Applied to Linux: Are we missing any libraries, or  dependent applications


3. Valuation (Yen are translated into dollars)

Applied to Linux: How does it compare to other things


4. Rights and Obligations (They are the owner or debtor)

Applied to Linux: Lets call this basic functionality


5. Presentation and Disclosure (The amounts are displayed in a standard
fashion so it can be compared with the amounts shown on other companies) 
[We usually take care of this]

Applied to Linux: Does it conform to a standard such as LSB?

&gt;VISION
&gt;
&gt;The vision I have here is that at some time in the future it will be 
&gt;possible for people to interact with the growing collection of test 
&gt;definitions, tests and results to pose and answer questions like:
&gt;
&gt; - What problems exist out there that I could work on to fix?
&gt;
The accounting professsion has something called an Emerging Issues Task 
Force (EITF).
There are several committees on the EITF that studies and each one 
studies and proposes
a solution for an unsolved problem.

&gt; - What tests exist in this area so I can think about devising a
&gt;   new test and then implement it.
&gt;  
&gt;
I would suggest categorizing both the testing and configuration 
guidelines in some sort of Dewey
Decimal System type thing to categorize them.

&gt; - Why did this particular problem not get picked up by existing 
&gt;   testing and can I define a new test that is needed.
&gt;
&gt; - What tests have been defined but have not yet been implemented so
&gt;   I can find one to create.
&gt;
&gt; - What set of versions does this problem manifest itself on so I can
&gt;   pin it down more?
&gt;
&gt; - What confidence should I have that this set of software (Kernel,
&gt;   utilities and some applications) has been tested in my type of 
&gt;   environment?
&gt;
EITF's could define and maintain a list of relevant factors as they arise.

&gt;- How much more testing should we as a medium or large organization do to 
&gt;   assure ourselves that the version of Linux and these apps we want 
&gt;   to use will actually work in our environment.
&gt;
I would suggest the creation of a not for profit organization that will 
be charged
with compiling the information and informing developers, distributors 
and end
users of various problems and solutions.

&gt;THE PROBLEMS
&gt;
&gt;There are many problems with this project and one of the goals of the FixIt
&gt;would be to come up with solutions to them. Some of the problems are:
&gt;
&gt;- What testing framework to use
&gt;
&gt;- How to stop people from poisoning the database
&gt;
As auditors, we look at the motivation of the user as a starting point. 
So, if the client is more likely to overstate revenue, we won't test to see
if they purposely understated it. So maybe its a question of who tests who.

Perhaps developers can test end users,  end users can test distributions 
and distributions can test developers...

&gt;- What info do we want to collect
&gt;  
&gt;
Maybe these can be defined by various solutions task forces...

&gt;- How to get enough info into the database
&gt;
* Core question more fundamental then a task force.

&gt;- What to test? (Everything) (Kernel, APIs, X, protocol implementations, 
&gt;  applicatkions, Databases, web servers, etc, but start with the basics.)
&gt;
* May or may not be core, depends on application?

&gt;- How to structure the tests
&gt;
&gt;- How to manage the tests (including how to prevent invalid or broken
&gt;  tests from entering the system
&gt;
&gt;- The reports it should be possible to pull from the database
&gt;
&gt;- Where the database should go
&gt;
&gt;- What Applications are needed to interact with the database ... ie, 
&gt;  something that can answer what components should I upgrade to get to 
&gt;  a collection that overcomes the problem I currently have.
&gt;
&gt;- Integration with bugzilla ...
&gt;
&gt;- and so on
&gt;
&gt;WHAT WE WANT TO DO DURING THE FIXIT SESSION
&gt;
&gt;Collect ideas and work through some of the issues
&gt;
&gt;Assemble an initial team to start the technical work.
&gt;  
&gt;
I don't know if I am qualified, but I would be happy to help in any way 
I can.
