&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks everyone who offered some advice. I really knew bugger 
&gt; &gt; all about digital cameras before :) I read the review of the 
&gt; &gt; Canon A70 on dpreview, it looks like a very nice Camera, good 
&gt; &gt; battery life, and good shots. I'll keep my eye out for 
&gt; &gt; affordable Canon camera's.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm going very soon, so I'm kind of rushing this a bit I 
&gt; &gt; guess. I could always buy one over there, but I'm not sure 
&gt; &gt; it'd be any cheaper. I'd prefer to get one here so I don't 
&gt; &gt; have to deal with the manufacturer directly regarding warranty.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a hard decision. The money or the warranty. Will Canon 
&gt; honor the international warranty? Will it break?
&gt; 
&gt; Ive bought flash gear from Hugo So in Hong Kong for my Digital 
&gt; SLR
&gt; (Canon 10D), and the savings were impressive. I have a link to 
&gt; a forum post he maintains with latest prices somewhere, I'll 
&gt; post it when I find it. A friend bought a couple of digicams 
&gt; from him at nearly half price.

Here's his forum post. 

<A HREF="http://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/43780">http://www.fredmiranda.com/forum/topic/43780</A>

It mostly lists fancy lenses and stuff you'd buy if you were right into
photography. Me, I'd have one of those nice 85/1.2L lenses if I could
somehow justify it, or perhaps a 70-200IS would be pretty neat.
Unfortunately, I can't justify it, I spend too much time on the 'puter :(

Anyway, if you read the posts, you'll see that he has many satisfied
customers, and having happily dealt with him myself I don't mind passing
the link on if you're interested. Just email him with what you're
interested in and he'll quote it. My flash gear turned up in 3 days
after paypal payment, pickup was at the GPO where I had to pay 10% GST
on the transaction.

The cameras my friend bought were Canon S50's they're a neat unit too.
The one I would have is the 1Ds
(<A HREF="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_eos1ds.asp">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_eos1ds.asp</A>) but they
are a horrible price, even from Hugo...

&lt;disclaimer&gt; I have nothing to do with Hugo other than being a satisfied
customer.&lt;/disclaimer&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Canon's tend to be clearer - I guess they make a lot of lenses etc.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Here's an example of our cat taken on a Canon IXUS400 (4MP):

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Checkthe detail in the eye and the fur.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is very nice indeed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I use an Olympus thats over a year old,
&gt; &gt; &gt; its an OK digital camera with good optics,
&gt; &gt; &gt; its an SLR style body with all the SLR goodies,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but as with any camera the biggest plus to getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; good photos is holding the damn thing still!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't laugh, holding the camera still was
&gt; &gt; &gt; the simplest fix from make Ok photos to damn
&gt; &gt; &gt; good one =)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; cheers,
