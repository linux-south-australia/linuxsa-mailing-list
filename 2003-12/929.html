&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So we start to see the begining of what SCO are up to.
&gt;&gt;They have always been complaining about ABIs in various
&gt;&gt;other free or opensourec unicies...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;SCO clamin that these APIs were used without their
&gt;&gt;permisson.
&gt; 
&gt; My understanding is that an ABI or API cannot have a copyright placed over 
&gt; it, but that the text that expresses these ideas can.

If these APIs, specifically in Linux were derived from published
texts, is this still valid? (I don't know which is why I'm asking)

I can't image that lots of the Linux kernel developers would have
had access to UNIX source code in early versions of Linux when
these interfaces were made...(set in stone?)

Linus, specifically had access to texts, specifically Minix,
and the (in)famous "Design of the UNIX Operating System" book.
(I think thats the title) And a couple of the other UNIX design
books from that era...

Surely these files haven't changed *much* since the days of
0.99.xx (just pre 1.0)?

&gt; If you look at the Groklaw comments you will see that it seems that many 
&gt; of these fragments came over from *BSD before the agreement between 
&gt; AT&T/USL and UCB etc was signed ...

The reason I'm asking these questions, is that I'm considering a move
to either FreeBSD or NetBSD. I'm responsible for the deployment of
the servers at my work place and need to make an informed decision.

But the way I read that article, all of the Open Source BSDs are
also vulnerable to this claim... if not, why not?

&gt;&gt;What I'm wondering is if these APIs part of or
&gt;&gt;required under the POSIX standards?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does maintaining POSIX standard void this somehow?
&gt;&gt;They are assumably published openly?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does the act of publishing these APIs in dozens
&gt;&gt;of UNIX programming texts change anything?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Are SCOs claims actually fair?

I noticed you stayed away from this one =)

&gt;&gt;Are Free/Open/Net BSD open to the same claims?
&gt;&gt;Even tho it has a BSD copyright style notice?
&gt;&gt;If not why not? They presumably didn't get
&gt;&gt;permission from SCO either?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It seems SCO is trying to kill *all* open source
&gt;&gt;or free Unicies... =/

cheers,
