&gt; Hmm.  Don't get me wrong; all this discussion surrounding what SCO's
&gt; invoking is very interesting (and it isn't a completely negative
&gt; situation, as it will improve & harden open source), but they've only
&gt; got a loud voice because of us, the community, right?

I recon thats a fair view =)

The community has a voice because the community had input.
The community is watching its rights of 'freedom' being taken
away. Of course they are going to complain. They wouldn't be
part of this community if they didn't feel part of it or if
it wasn't important to them ...
(maybe feeling of freedom, is a better description)

&gt; I mean, perhaps half the reason they're making such a fuss is because of
&gt; our reaction to this, which in turn, leads them to do it more.  I wonder
&gt; what would happen if we completely ignored them - of course, that won't
&gt; happen :-)

Then the 'freedom' would be taken away silently without any
fight them ... and the reason folks use Linux and other OSS
is that they obviously want that kind of freedom in the
first place...

Some people don't care for the freedom that F/OSS provides,
image the reaction if more people did ... or understood what
is actually happening.

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
