I think having a LinuxSA forum would be a grand idea.

There is no need to abandon the mailing list, we could have both.
For those who say, "no never, it will die anyway", I say give it a try.
If it dies then it dies, no big deal.
But we'll never know if it will flourish if we don't give it a go.
BTW, who said that forums have to be always "on topic", that's the idea
of having threads. So different subjects can be discussed & viewed,
Linux or otherwise.
It all depends on what piques your interest as to what you decide to
click on, works exactly the same in a mailing list.

As for finding moderators to volunteer their time, "build it & they will
come."

I'd be interested in seeing what Geoff Bennett's spin is on this.

Regards,
Rick

&gt; Linux!  I  don't  mind the different emails and sometimes they are 
&gt; amusing and interesting which made me think,  could it be possible to 
&gt; run a forum like a lot of Distro's users do? That way we could have 
&gt; different areas for newbie questions , general questions, Linux, etc. I 
&gt; am the first to admit that i don't know how difficult this would be but 
&gt; it is only a suggestion and the user could view which area they wanted
