&gt; I didn't really want the whole bible. I'm a proud atheist
&gt; (I could be a buddhist but I like my worldly
&gt; possessions)
A man with a great sense of humour. (Too few and too far between imho) =
...I
love this answer!!!  (To me) it's like stating 'I could be the worlds
fastest man, if only I could reprogramme my genome over night!!!'  (Now
THERE'S a statement that could start a number of different threads)  ;-)

Look - just to set your mind at ease - I'm not Pastor/Reverend/Deacon =
(or
whatever) anybody; and there's NOT going to be any 'collection' taken up =
or
any 'sermon' preached *LOL* I was just making an off hand comment that I =
had
no idea would be taken up the way that it was.

As far as Revelations itself, once you start reading it for yourself =
you'll
understand why I offered you to E-Mail me offlist to discuss... (After =
all,
even a young 30 year old theologian could devote the rest of their life
pondering this vision of the future as foretold in this book; and =
because
this isn't a theological list - it obviously isn't the proper forum to
discuss; as I don't think anyone can directly relate it to either Linux =
or
open source.)  :-)

&gt; I just wanted to read the section that refered to
&gt; George W. bringing about the apocalypse.
IMHO: George W is simply a stage assistant assisting to move pieces on =
to
the chess board into their correct position for the 'end game' to =
commence
between The Bible's two major players... (As in those chess puzzles you =
see
in papers like the Advertiser "Solve this puzzle of check mate in 5 =
moves -
white to move first)

Once you've started reading it for yourself you'll find that Revelation =
is
not exactly the most simple of books to understand, and this is the only
reason I made the offer I did.  (Not to 'convert' you or anyone else.  =
Read
it or not, the choice EXCLUSIVLY is yours.)  :-)

...Now; let's all stand and sing hymn 139 completly off-key before the
collection plate is passed...  *LOL*  (Thus endeth the 'sermon')  :-)
