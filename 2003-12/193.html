&gt;&gt;Linux SA and the AUUG got a mention in the SA Legislative Council.

&gt;&gt;DSL even got *commended* by the opposition ;-)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;checkout this rather insightful statement by "Tony Healy, a research software 
&gt;engineer and policy researcher within Australia-Innovate." :
&gt;
&gt;"Open source software is based on software being free, which means developers 
&gt;receive no revenue. Open source advocates dispute this but the fact is that, 
&gt;once the source code is publicly available for a product, it is difficult to 
&gt;charge for software, because other people produce rival programs using that 
&gt;source code, or modify it and pretend it was their own work. In this sense, 
&gt;software is different from all other copyrighted works. . . .Any concerted 
&gt;move to open source would kill innovation, because revenue is essential for 
&gt;all serious practitioners in the economy, including software developers. It's 
&gt;worth noting that Linux creator Linus Torvalds created a product worth 
&gt;billions of dollars, yet [he] still has to scrabble for a job. This is not a 
&gt;model we want for Australian software."
&gt;
&gt;What's stopping MYOB (or others) from running their proprietary software on 
&gt;Linux? Use LGPL libraries, and it's fine. Or pay for QT. I believe according 
&gt;to the bill, that if MYOB published their file formats, they could keep their 
&gt;software proprietary and that would be acceptable to the government (It's 
&gt;Open Standards we want! A level playing field!).
&gt;
&gt;ahh well,
&gt;
&gt;Damien
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
Also the 'killing innovation' is a BS argument, as the best ideas are 
often created by people that are playing with a thought and then simply 
start coding to see if it can be done. These projects most commonly end 
up in the OSS domain, after which a big company scoops up the idea, 
expands on it (or kills it with features that are not needed, as M$'s 
usually does) and then markets it as their great innovative product.
If you're lucky, they reference you, or at least write their own code to 
built a similar thing... Some companies will just simply take that OSS 
code and adapt it for their own use and then sell it...

Also he seems to think (at least that is what I read from above article) 
that OSS is not copyrighted, or at least the copyright cannot be 
enforced. I think the OSF has been proving that assumption incorrect for 
a while now...

LOL, you'd almost think Mr. Healy is afraid for his own job...  ;-)
