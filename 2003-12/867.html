&gt; &gt; no, happy with 19" at 1280x1024 when at home, when on the move
&gt; &gt; I can accept smaller screen as the trade-off for not carrying
&gt; &gt; around too much stuff.  But what I don't know is when I get home
&gt; &gt; can I plug in external monitor, keyboard and mouse and have it
&gt; &gt; run at 1280x1024 on the external monitor?
&gt; 
&gt; In which case, definitely go with the 12" iBook - if you're 
&gt; all for not carrying around much, you'll probably find it 
&gt; perfect.  It'll definitely run your 19" at that higher 
&gt; resolution, too.  iBooks, of course, also take quite a beating 
&gt; - the plastic casing is extremely sturdy.
&gt; 
&gt; I personally find, though, that once you're used to the 
&gt; laptop's LCD, going back to a CRT, even a larger one, really 
&gt; hurts your eyes - unless, of course, you run it at a high 
&gt; refresh rate (&gt;80), which usually means the monitor can't go 
&gt; quite as high in resolution (and even then, the CRT hurts my 
&gt; eyes after extended periods).  You may find you don't use your 
&gt; external monitor at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, previous laptop experience will tell your 
&gt; preferences on this.
&gt; 
&gt; I honestly have no idea why anybody would buy a 17" Powerbook -
&gt;  they're too damn big, apparently get damaged stupidly easily, 
&gt; and you need a bag the size of a mammoth to carry them around.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the powerbook seems like lots more money for not much more
&gt; &gt; (compared to the ibook, the powerbook compares well to well-
&gt; &gt; specced x86 laptops though but the ibook looks the bargain)
&gt; 
&gt; Comment in previous post was to address this comment; it 
&gt; certainly is a bargain, but there are differences that 
&gt; definitely justify the cost difference.  I'm happy as hell 
&gt; with mine, but that's because I really needed some of the 
&gt; extras (faster cpu, better video card, larger 
&gt; screen/resolution, more hard drive space, 4x DVD burner - I'm 
&gt; planning on a lot of mobile video work in the near future).

The differences aren't really much practically - the biggest single
difference between the powerbook and iBook is in memory: the iBook is
limited to 640Mb max, the PB goes much higher.
