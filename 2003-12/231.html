That sounds like you're saying Microsoft are innovative. Try listing 
any commercial companies that are innovative, and you'll run into the 
same problem.

Computer Science hasn't changed much since the 1970's, and everything's 
been incrementatal from there on. I'd further argue that Computer 
Science itself wasn't innovative, since it was just the incremental 
improvement of automating methematics into electronic form.

I challenge you to list any innovations, anywhere in human history, 
that wasn't the result of a surprise or mistake. Then consider how 
computers lack any surprises because every aspect is tightly 
controlled. Even mistakenly.
