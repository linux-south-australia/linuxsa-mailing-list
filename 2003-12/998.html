&gt; Well I am now the proud owner of a Canon A70 Digital Camera :) It won't 
&gt; download images under Mandrake 9.2 though :( However I got it working under 
&gt; Knoppix 3.2 with kernel 2.6.0-test7 and libgphoto2 2.1.3... so I just have to 
&gt; get kernel 2.6.0 happening on Mandrake and make it my default so I can 
&gt; download images with ease.
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't got it working on win2k yet. I think it's because I plugged it in 
&gt; before installing the Canon supplied drivers. So now win2k is having a crap 
&gt; at me :/ And of course the "logs" don't help at all, they say nothing as to 
&gt; what is wrong. bah.

Try *not* installing any driver.

Most digital cameras appear as a USB storage device when plugged
into the computer.

Have a look at the logs and dmesg under Linux and see if this is
the case for your camera.

I'm not familiar with Win2K but the kids tell me that WinXP handles
USB storage devices fine, including their camera (a $200 Olympus
as they've become interested in photography and I'm told that
it's better to learn on a digital camera rather than a film
camera, something which doesn't seem right to me but which the
professionals I talked with agreed upon).

I wrote a guide on USB storage under Linux.  You might want
to dig that out of the LinuxSA archives, as I imagine that
would apply to Mandrake just fine.
