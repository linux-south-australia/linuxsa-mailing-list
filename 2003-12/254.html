&gt; Now, back to the issue of the open source community wanting to beat 
&gt; Microsoft.

My central point was on innovation, or the lack thereof.  There's been a
lot of noise about how open source is innovative and proprietary works
stifle innovation, and I wanted to 'test' that idea by seeing what
innovative open source works people could list.

The Microsoft line was a last minute throw-away, based on my observation
that a lot of open source immitation is aimed at them.  I'd have to say
that the open source immitation of Microsoft is quite good.  Open source
products are becoming confusing, poorly documented, bloated and buggy.
Why, every time I need to use a new KDE tool I re-discover the poor
quality of documentation.  It used to be that man was the univeral
answer; now it seems to be a mishmash of help systems, html files, info
documents and man pages, with man pages being ignored in favour of a
random preference in the others.  Is there anything wrong with man pages?
Not that I can see, unless you think that they eye-candy of the windows
world is important.  Apparently the open source immitators feel that
it is.  Unix was an elegant, robust and easy-to-use operating system
for over twenty years.  Now, even I am finding it harder to use.

As to Microsoft, the corporation: I'm not particularly interested in
them.
