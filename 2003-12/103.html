Sorry for my lack of detail regarding my setup.
I should have known that it makes things easier for people if they have
some decent level of detail to work from.
This is my basic setup.
Yes, I'm NAT'ing :)
ADSL (Internode) from behind a Billion modem/router
Debian (Unstable) getting it's IP via dhcp provided by the router.
I've attached log files that seem relevant
/var/log/snort/alert
/var/log/snort/portscan2.log

the alert log shows quite a bit of activity on ports above 37000

I'm not sure what else might be needed/relevant, so just give me a slap
upside the head and I'll dig up anything to help.

Cheers,
David Creed

&gt; &gt; I installed snort a couple of weeks ago and came home today to find this

&gt; &gt; I don't like the sound of port scans coming FROM my machine, have I been
&gt; &gt; "0wn3d"?
&gt; &gt; Advise and opinions gratefully accepted.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, snort doesn't appear to have given any details of what ports
&gt; were being scanned, which would be helpful in determining whether snort has
&gt; just tripped on normal outbound connections (e.g. a bunch of connections to
&gt; a variety of web pages, which may show enough of a diverse range of hosts
&gt; for snort to trigger on), or whether there was something more sinister
&gt; happening.  Do you have any more detailed log files to go by?
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing - the source IP address appears private.  Are you NAT'ing?
&gt; Could snort be picking up outbound requests from a PC on your internal
&gt; network? (I get this from my wife's XP machine all the time).
