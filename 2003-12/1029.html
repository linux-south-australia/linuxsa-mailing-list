Hi all,

This is not a job ad. I just happen to work for someone who may be wanting to
employ some people in the near future.

The work involves configuring Apache, compiling and configuring custom
Java-based software, some SSL setup, and assorted other bits and pieces - some
networking knowledge helps, as does some systems admin experience. Familiarity
with scripting, HTML and some Java would also help. It's all on high end Sparc
hardware running Solaris 8 and 9, in a Windows desktop environment. There's
also the opportunity for some overseas travel. It's relatively demanding work,
mainly because there's so much going on at once, and it's mission-critical for
the client, rather than because of difficult technical problems.

There's likely to be more than one opportunity, and it's likely that there will
be more in the coming year as well. I'm purposefully leaving the level of the
position unclear, because that really depends on the skills and experience of
the applicants.

If anyone's interested, email me off-list (I'll be immediately unsubscribing
again), and I'll put you in contact with the right people. I have no vested
interest in being an intermediary (I'm not a recruiter, or in HR, and there is
no "spotter's fee"), and I'm not acting in any official capacity by sending
this email, I'm just keen to help find the right people for this work...
