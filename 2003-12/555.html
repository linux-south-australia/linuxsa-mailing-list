&lt;quote who="SAPOL"&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you please identify the buildings that Southern Baptists have
&gt;&gt; blown up?  Or perhaps the suicide bombings that have been performed by
&gt;&gt; it's adherents?  What about aircraft hijackings, how many of those
&gt;&gt; have been done by "fundamental" Christans?
&gt;
&gt; 'Fundamentalism' is defined by philosophies, not by actions. There are
&gt; plenty of non-violent fundamentalist religious groups. That's why
&gt; calling the Taliban 'fundamentalists' doesn't accurately describe them,
&gt; for example. 'Violent fundamentalists' are different to 'non-violent
&gt; fundamentalists'. And when I talk about Southern Baptists, I'm
&gt; referring to their philosophies publically expounded, not the people
&gt; themselves or even the religion in terms of the bible. I'm talking
&gt; about what they've actually said. So please don't try to turn this into
&gt; a personal attack of the people or Christians in general.


Well actually, the term "fundametalist" originated as a term of honour -
one who accepted and believed the "fundamentals" of the (Christian) faith,
as documented in the bible, and didn't add extra things to suit their
opinions and lifestyles (cf various extremist cults etc).  Since them the
term has come to mean something somewhat different.

The tone of your email suggested that there was something wrong with being
a "Southern Baptist", and I was suggesting that you are lumping a lot of
people together under the one banner.  Googling for "Southern Baptist"
gave me this &lt;<A HREF="http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp&gt">http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp&gt</A>; which is a
pretty standard Christian statement of faith.  Whether you agree with it
or not is irrelevant to the discussion, but rather it shows that the
"Southern Baptists" are a pretty much mainline Christian group, albeit
conservative.

Back to George "Double-ya".  Some quick googling also shows that there's a
lot of divided opinion on what the president of the USA believes.  Whether
he has any faith in anything or not - being president in the USA means you
are a) very busy, and b) expected to visit churches on Sundays.  So it's
all largely speculative.
