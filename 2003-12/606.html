&gt; &gt; Chris, state your claim again. We now have Shaun Branden with a "Hitler"

&gt; 
&gt; Oh man...  Once and for all: Let's get something straight here:
&gt; 
&gt; There have been many instances of extremist so-called "Christians" although
&gt; I cannot imagine how anyone who has even the most foundational understanding
&gt; of Christianity can say that the Klu Klux Klan, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot or
&gt; Nazi's can possibly be what The Bible describes as Christian!!! (Christian
&gt; btw is defined as followers of Christ - in other words doers not just
&gt; listeners.)
&gt; 

They proclaim their christianity, pol pot was baptised, jesus died
paying for hitlers sins, so why are they not christians ?

&gt; Guys, this is as blatantly rediculous as stating that sitting in a church
&gt; pew on a Sunday morning makes you a Christian - or like stateing that
&gt; spending the night in your car's garage makes you a car!!!

you are confusing yourself.

&gt; IMHO (and I believe the Bible backs it up) the Crussaders were not
&gt; fundamentalists - they were extremists. Just as the KKK, IRA, Nazi's, Pol
&gt; Pot - and all like minded - are/were equally extremists.

"you say tomato, I say tomatoe ... "

&gt; Also for the record, if ANYBODY wants to know what fundamentalist
&gt; Christianity teaches, simply read the sermon on the Mount as taught by Jesus
&gt; Himself. (Read Matthew - otherwise refered to as the Beatitudes. Start at
&gt; Matthew Chapeter 5 and finish reading at Matthew Chapter 8.)
&gt; 
&gt; 4 very short examples include:
&gt; 
&gt; M 5:7 "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."  M 5:9
&gt; "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God."  M
&gt; 5: 22-22 "You have heard it ws said to those of old 'you shall not murder'
&gt; and whoever murders will be in dagner of the judgment. But *I* say to you
&gt; that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of
&gt; the judgemnt"  M 5: 38-39 "You have heard that it was said 'an eye for an
&gt; eye and a tooth for a tooth' But *I* tell you not to resist an evil person.
&gt; But whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other to him also."  (I
&gt; could go on for MANY pages - but I'm sure we all get the point)

&gt; ***THIS*** is fundamentalist Christianity, spoken by the very person who the
&gt;  word defines.  And ANYTHING else is EXTREMIST.
&gt; 

Give eveyone a break and take it off list, but please do try to come up
with something, you are failing to back yourself up on anything.

have fun
