Hello,

     I used to run a dns system written by Dan Bernstein called djbdns.  Now
running this dns was multitudes easier than running bind and editing a few
files for each individual change.  With Dan's approach he also put the
process that answered queries into the /etc/inittab.  Now my question is why
do people insist on using daemon monitoring programs when all you really
need to do is stick your process into init at the appropriate run levels.
Are there system impacts when this method is used?  I am not so much arguing
on Dan's behalf but there are quite a few programs out there that do this
daemon monitoring thing.  I personally have used /etc/inittab in work
environments and at home and I have never noticed (key word) anything
diffedrent about the systems.  I use it for things like my ssh daemon and my
dynamic dns update daemon.  If any of the processes in /etc/inittab die then
they get restarted by init.  I can assume that for testing purposes you
wouldn't really want to run stuff out of there but for a machine that could
potentially lose alot of money if down?  Can anyone explain or at least
point me in the right direction as where to look about why this method isn't
used or why this method should not be used, or maybe it is used alot but I
just haven't seen it that much?

Thanks,

Chris-
