&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush, Howard and Hitler are arguably a few other christian murderers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for you to have on your side.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Shaun, with all due respect, your biases are embarrasing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; beep. sorry, the point is these guys are devout christians who order
&gt;&gt; mass death. is that ok?
&gt;
&gt; The point I'd like to add Rom, is that a survey of Christians would
&gt; not say these men were representative of the Christian faith.

I think we should all be able to agree on that.

&gt; A survery of what they have said, done and proclaimed may back that
&gt; view point up.

Indeed.

Probably the point that is being made here is that the Muslims we're
talking about are also no better representatives of the Muslim faith.
The fact is that when some people are oppressed, they use their
religion to justify atrocities which the religion does not in any way
sanction.

&gt; But lumping Bush and Howard in with Hitler is equivalent to lumping
&gt; Simon Crean (or the new "Paul Keating" clone guy whose name escapes
&gt; me) in with Stalin - both are ridiculous comparisons.

Agreed.  You don't have to like Bush or Howard, but they're certainly
not in the same league.
