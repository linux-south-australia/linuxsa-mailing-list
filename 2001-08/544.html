I'm sure this topic has been debated many times before, however, I've
looking into alot of commerical programs and various distributions of
both Linux & *BSD's and I'm curious as to what people thinking about
purchasing open source software? Would you expect to pay less than a
Windows based program or the same?? 

I know that people should support the products that they use and like, I
am not arguring with that. However, one of the strongest or at least
most of published reason for switching to an open source solution is
cost of purchase (at least from a home consumers perspective). I know
there are various models around to encourage finanical support including
Suse only providing an ftp installation and no ISO images; OpenBSD
copyrighting the CD format and again not providing ISO images. I think
too many people think of open source as a "free beer" alternative, and
hey I like my free beer and use alot of it; however, I think that
corporate interest is important to open source development and for that
finanical security is essential. How can you encourage somebody to buy
something, if they are told they can have it for free?? I'm not immune
from this either, when I first release that Suse, OpenBSD where not
available for download or couldn't be copied, etc, etc it seemed to go
against my grain. I was like, "but its supposed to be free".. but then I
started to think about it, and the source is still available and that is
what is important. Companies that while are closed-source for some of
their products like theKompany and Loki that support open-source
projects I feel also need support. Do y'all agree?
