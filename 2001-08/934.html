&gt;Those things don't matter to me, but if they did, I'd
&gt;not want my stuff in someone else's facility.
&gt;
&gt;An example of this is the total fiasco of
&gt;www.theregister.co.uk in the last 2 weeks.
&gt;The collocated with a big facility in London with
&gt;all you mention plus much more.
&gt;(From memory, it was level3 or something.)
&gt;But when their system failed, it was a huge saga

theregister had more problems than just their hosting, it looked like they
had some sort of content-acceleration system in place which returns
different DNS results to different parts of the world. I suspect their ttl's
were set too high as well. ie: it's not just their hosting facility to blame
for a failure.

&gt;to get the thing going again, which was very substantially
&gt;_hindered_ by the fact that it was all in a secure facility.

It all depends on the provider of the facility. If that mattered to you, you
could get an agreement for 24x7 access to the server.

Adelaide is an ideal place to co-locate a server, because skilled labor is
cheaper and generally located within a 20 minute drive of the CBD. Try
offering better than a 1 hour response time in Sydney and see how much it
costs. Adelaide also has a large amount of bandwidth available for it's
size, yet enjoys the same prices from backbone providers as those in the
east do (but perhaps not as many to choose from).

&gt;In their own offices, there would have been no problem.
&gt;Right now, I can't get through to their site again.
&gt;If they had been using a modest machine in their own
&gt;offices (above a cafe or something), they would not
&gt;have had these very damaging outages.

If they had, chances are they would have had 20 more outages by now, just
not as severe. Catastrophic or minor, an outage still has the same effect on
an end user.

&gt;Also, 300 GBytes/month = approx 1 Mbit/sec, which is
&gt;not so difficult for an SME to afford these days.

A real megabit per second is going to cost an SME near $10,000 per month,
and they're going to need staff who can keep it running. Have you met the
nominated 'IT person' at most SME's? It's usually someone who wasn't
initially employed for that postition and is already in way over their head
without running a web server as well.

At the hosting facility they can take advantage of much more speed at much
less cost.

&gt;I still think that the ideal internet presence for
&gt;99% of businesses is a linux box and a 33k modem.

I think that this is ideal for 1% of businesses at best. For starters the
linux box will probably cost more than a year's worth of virtual hosting.
The rest of the reasons would keep the list offtopic for a month. There's
this notion common to most successful enterprises called 'core business'.
ie: Web serving is best left to Web Serving companies.
