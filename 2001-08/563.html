Hi folks,

I am running Mandrake 8 and KDE for the community group's project and 
so far all seems well. However setting up the login screen is causing 
me problems.

What I want is for the User to either be logged in automatically 
without a password or a login prompt that shows the gorup's name and 
logo. So far I have set this within the control panel and yet it does 
not seem to 'take'. I keep getting a generic login screen with only the 
hostname showing.

I have set this up from root with all looking fine as far as I can see 
yet nothing is any different.

Another problem is that I have set User as being able to shutdown. The 
config screen says that it is all set for User to shutdown. As User I 
click on an icon I have made for shutdown, nothing happens. As Root I 
click on the same icon and it shuts down. Obviously the system is not 
accepting my changes yet it says that it has made the changes.

Sorry if this appears as simple as it sounds but it has me beat.

Oh, the system is being used to demo Linux and Star Office so it has to 
be setup so anybody can walk up to the machine and start using it. It 
isn't connected to any other machine/printer/modem. It's simply a 
standalone computer.


Any help is appreciated.

Cheers,  Ian
