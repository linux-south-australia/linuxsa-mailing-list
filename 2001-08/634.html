&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any expirience with SAMBA using LDAP to authenticate Win98
&gt; boxs?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems so slow running login scripts and when multiple people access
&gt; login witht he same account, at the same time - some users time out and
&gt; have to retry.

Have you tried to compile with LDAP? If so, which version/branch?
Success, Failure?

LDAP (or indeed, most other) backends being added to Samba will be a
huge step to making Samba 2.2.x as close to an NT PDC as possible.
Things like user account expiry and workstation restrictions, just start
working. I believe that they are going to try to make it as similar as
possible to the Windows 2000 Active Directory schema, to make the next
step easier.

As far as I know, that stuff isn't working at the moment. I think that
Jerry Carter is one of the people working on it. There's been a little
more activity on samba-technical, regarding LDAP, recently and I know
that they already have their Enterprise Number as assigned by the IANA.

Having said that, Samba TNG supported LDAP quite well when I last
checked (<A HREF="http://www.samba-tng.org/">http://www.samba-tng.org/</A>). Samba TNG has other problems,
though.

If you are still interested in Samba/LDAP, please read the HOWTOs that
were written on the topic. I can't remember who it's by or where it
lives, but you can probably still find a link from
<A HREF="http://www.kneschke.de/projekte/samba_tng/faq/index.php3.">http://www.kneschke.de/projekte/samba_tng/faq/index.php3.</A> There used to
be a 'More Information' link. If it's not there, try somewhere on the
Samba TNG site (<A HREF="http://www.samba-tng.org/">http://www.samba-tng.org/</A>).

Hope it helps,
Matt
