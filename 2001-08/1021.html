&gt; OK. I've found that the remote-serial-HOWTO currently sucks.

:-) Didn't know there was one.

&gt; I'm updating it with stacks of info from an AARNet internal
&gt; procedure.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I suggest that we then add a new section summarising
&gt; our serial-install experiences?

I'll have a read of the current one and if I can gather enough literacy
skills together, I'll try to add to them. Would you like me to send them
to you (so that you can merge them with your changes)? Or would you prefer
me to send updates to the maintainer(s)?

&gt; I wonder how I can find out what the floopy kernel's config is -- as
&gt; the Red Hat standard kernel already supports serial console.

I don't think you'll need to find the exact same config. Like I said
before, I think that the initrd stuff (and perhaps loopback filesystem
support) is the only thing that the floppy relies on that most people
don't put in a kernel anyway (filesystem support, IDE and/or SCSI support,
etc).

&gt; They drop DTR which then hangs up the modem.  You actually
&gt; want this to happen, otherwise when the user logs out the
&gt; modem call isn't cleared.  The alternative leads to tricky
&gt; situations where the console is waiting for someone to log
&gt; in but the modem is still holding up an old call.  This
&gt; isn't desirable behaviour on your Command Line of Last
&gt; Resort.

I guess if you need to make a couple of phone calls, because you had to
restart, it's better than no access at all. As long as you were guaranteed
that when it restarted, you could get back in, it would be bearable for
most.

Hope it helps,
Matt
