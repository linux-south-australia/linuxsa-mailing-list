Thats just it, it isn't "just a portscan" a port scan will only last for a 
few seconds and will scan the whole net work.  Only 1 ip is getting hit.

What is strange is that the ip getting hit is that one that the private 
network gets masquraded as.  I am begining to suspect that some idiot has 
installed a trojan on his windows box and someone is trying to connect to 
that specific trojan. I might turn on logging of outgoing request from the 
private network to see what I can find.

&gt; They are fairly high port numbers, but perhaps the scanner was just looking
&gt; for some particular set of trojans he owns that use those ports or
&gt; something?
&gt;
&gt; Assuming you're secure, there isn't anything to worry about.

&gt; &gt; Well this is probably more suited to a security mailing

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Since Monday night I have been getting some strange ipchain
&gt; &gt; messages in the firewall logs. (The firewall box is a linux
&gt; &gt; server and uses ipchains)  There are a few strange things
&gt; &gt; about this; they all target the firewall box, they all are
&gt; &gt; all coming from the same source port of 41856, they all
&gt; &gt; seem to be to random unprivledged ports.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone know what it could be? Below is a
&gt; &gt; small portion of the log <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
