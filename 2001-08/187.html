Dave,

In the last 24 hours, I've probably notified about 10 sites
of the infection.
Maybe 2 or 3 have replied.
About 3 of them bounced, because it's so difficult to get
contact addresses for most addresses on the net.

It doesn't make much sense to inform sys admins in
China or Korea, since they never reply, and probably don't
understand what I write anyway.

The only sites I've been notifying are simple-looking
addresses in domains like .au and .edu, and which are not
dynamically allocated ppp or adsl addresses.
When I notified the sys admin at Purdue Uni (Indiana) about
an infected host, it turned out that it was a

they said that the recent "nerd of the North" radio item
is now available in digital form on the ABC web site....]

...it turned out that the Indiana machine was a web proxy with
three 45 Mbit/sec links to the net.
