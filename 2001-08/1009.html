&gt; Has anyone tried to upgrade from, say, Red Hat Linux 7.0

No, but I have been looking at serial-based installs of Linux and other
operating systems.

&gt; I've got a modem on the serial console.
&gt; 
&gt; I can drop Red Hat Linux 7.1 onto a HTTP server.
&gt; I know that this has to be a 'with latest patches'
&gt; 7.1 as the unpatched 7.1 doesn't support serial
&gt; console.
&gt; 
&gt; What I want to know is if I need to write
&gt; a special version of the install floppy, and
&gt; where I find documentation on doing that.

You shouldn't need to re-create the floppy from scratch, but you will need
to modify it. The kernel on the floppy is a fairly generic one, so you can
quite safely guess the config and create a working one with serial console
support. You'll obviously need support for the hardware in the machine,
networking and initrd support. RedHat systems used to come with a number
of floppies, one of which was a network install floppy - you want that
one.

You then need to add the serial console kernel options to the syslinux.cfg
file on the floppy (sorry, can't recall what they are, but I'm guessing
you already know what's necessary there).

That ought to give you enough to boot an install disk with serial console
access and you should be able to install as per usual.

I'm not sure how you'd go doing the install over a modem. Most PC BIOSs
tend to cause modems to hang up on boot and the same might occur when
the linux kernel initialises the serial ports. I haven't done much with
this.

Hope it helps,
Matt

P.S. I forgot to mention that the floppy's nothing special, just a FAT
filesystem with syslinux, the kernel and a ramdisk on it.
