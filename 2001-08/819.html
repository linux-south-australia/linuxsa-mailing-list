&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone tell me when Linux first started supporting SMP?
&gt; 
&gt; I am being told that Win2K is the first Operating System to support
&gt; SMP, to 
&gt; which I thought was crap. As far as I can remember it was supported
&gt; when 
&gt; I was first installing Mandrake 6.0, is that true?
&gt; 
&gt; I am also convinced that the "inovative" new Windows Terminal Services
&gt; in 
&gt; Win2K is a rip off of VNC, any one know any more about this?
&gt; 

Jay,

No the Terminal Server stuff in Win2k is a blatant rip of Citrix
Winframe. I believe (but don't know as fact) that part of the License
agreement Citrix took with Microsoft when they developed Winframe, meant
Microsoft got the Citrix technology. This was back in the days of WinNT
3.51, the next release of WinFrame was still using the 3.51 interface
because Microsoft brought out WinNT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, which
was basically WinFrame with the new NT 4.0 interface. Of course, I might
be completely wrong, it was some years ago...

As for SMP, unless anyone can definitevly remember, it might pay to
troll through kernel.org to find the first SMP kernel.
I do know however, that many OS's, even in the Intel sector were
supporting SMP way before Windows of any variety (Netware springs to
mind, but there were others).
