Hi guys,
ill try and be a bit more clearer in what im trying to do, 
the machine is a coctail cabinet arcade machine with the old hardware ripped 
out . im running an old pc with linux and ive installed xmame(emulator)  to run old 
arcade games on it. the olny person using it would be me so security would not 
be an issue and the only programs running would be the emulator software and 
the front end im writing - both run with svgalibs, no X . So instead of logging in 
each time the machine starts, I wondered about the possiblilty of the no root and 
no password option....
cheers,
Rob.

&gt; &gt; is it possible to set linux to log in to root without asking for
&gt; login and password
&gt; &gt; details, as im using it for an arcade machine and do not require
&gt; login.
&gt; &gt; the system is debian 2.2
&gt; 
&gt; It's more than possible to automatically log in as any user.
&gt; UNIX was origianlly deployed in telco exchanges and that
&gt; feature was essential.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't recommend that user being root, use an less powerful
&gt; user instead.  Not using root also makes development easier.
&gt; 
&gt; In text mode, you simply run the application directly from
&gt; /etc/inittab with an entry like:
&gt; 
&gt;   a1:respawn:/opt/application/bin/myapp tty1
&gt; 
&gt; A useful variant of "myapp" is "autologin" at
&gt; 
&gt;   <A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/alikins/ltsp/autologin/">http://people.redhat.com/alikins/ltsp/autologin/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; which drops the user into a shell.  You could change
&gt; /etc/passwd and /etc/shells to drop the user into your
&gt; program.
&gt; 
&gt; This also applies if your application uses svgalib.
&gt; 
&gt; In X mode, you want to bypass the XDM login but retain
&gt; the rest of XDM's functions.	XDM doesn't allow this,
&gt; but there's a patch at:
&gt; 
&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~ob6/sw/xautolog.html">http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~ob6/sw/xautolog.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; This might have been rolled into XFree4, it would
&gt; be worthwhile trying the configuration commands.
&gt; 
&gt; KDE's KDM also does autologin as does GNOME's GDM.
&gt; From memory neither allow autologin for the root
&gt; user.
&gt; 
&gt; In Red Hat Linux you can also avoid the *DMs altogether
&gt; by creating a file /etc/sysconfig/autologin.	It's
&gt; probably better to use the *DMs for a game as that
&gt; would make development easier.
&gt; 
&gt; Last but not least, you can always alter /etc/inittab
&gt; to change the program that starts X to one of your
&gt; choosing.  As this is essentially writing your own
&gt; display manager; it's probably not the best way to go.
