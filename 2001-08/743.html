&gt; A compiled perl binary is likely to be the bytecode + the interpreter,
&gt; so it will suffer from the same problem Java has - that being that you
&gt; could conceiveably decompile the bytecode back into human readable
&gt; source (as far as possible, afterall, it _IS_ perl :-)

I don't know exactly what bytecode Java (or Perl) uses, but I have gobs
of experience with similar systems, meaning high level languages which
are compiled to a machine code for a machine that has never been built,
and which is then interpreted by a machine emulator.  Wirth did this
for his Pascal for the CDC6400.  UCSD did it with their p-System.  I did
it with a language and machine of my own design.  In all of these cases
the machine language (or call it bytecode or intermediate code) is very
much in the style of the machine code of CPUs that have been built, such
as M68K or x86.  (Actually, all of those use a stack oriented machine,
not a register oriented machine, however the difference is unimportant
to the question at hand.)

I have studied actual machine sequences, and while you can write high
level equivalents, that is not the same as recovering the original
source code.  For example it's hard to tell the difference between a
forever loop, such as the C construct, "for(;;)", and a goto statement.
You have a choice of high-level equivalents:

   for (;;) {             loop:
     ...                     ...
   }                         goto loop;

Of course, this is not such a big difference, but when the compiler
optimises it gets much harder.  The lovely algorithm:

   for (distance = i = 0; i &lt; npoints; i++)
       distance += step(base + i);

is much different from:

   l0093 = f1154(109) + f1154(110) + f1154(111) + f1154(112);

The second is a perfectly reasonable translation of machine code to
high-level language.  You might actually prefer it, but it rather loses
the point of the algorithm.


&gt; The perl compiler might do some obfuscation, but the java experience
&gt; shows us that you can always get back the original source.

I'd be very interested in seeing a reference to back up this claim.
I don't think the reason it's compiled in the first place is to obfuscate
the code.  I'm pretty sure the reason is to make it run faster (than
a high-level interpretation), and once translated to a very different
language, translating it back is non-trivial.
