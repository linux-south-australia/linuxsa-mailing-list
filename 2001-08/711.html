Richard,

I can't be absolutely certain about SuSE 7.2, but I assume
it has at least what 7.1 had.
In SuSE 7.1, the installation is definitely X-based.
It guesses all the info on the graphics card and monitor,
and then proceeds to do everything in graphics.
It's actually pretty difficult to force it to go
back to text mode.

There are points at which you can force it to jump
out of YaST2 (which only seems to work in X window system)
to old YaST (which is essentailly text-screen graphics
based).

So the answer is "yes".
Not only does SuSE provide a graphics based installer
(which guesses virtualy every bit of hardware on the
whole system) - the graphics based installer is
in fact the automatic default.

Personally, I like to get out of the graphics installer
as quickly as possible, so that I can use the text-graphics
instead in old YaST. That's still graphics based, but using
the "graphics characters", as in Norton Commander in the
olden days of DOS.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
