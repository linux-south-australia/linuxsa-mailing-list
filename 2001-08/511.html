&gt; not its open source doesn't really bother me.  Can anyone recommend
&gt; something?

Jim,

In fact, finding a windows client for SSH is part and parcel of linux
life - not off-topic at all, in my humble opinion.
(It's also fair enough to ask linuxSA for their recommendations on
competing products, because you won't usually find linuxSA's
opinions/recommendations on google. Although.... in this case,
I had asked the same question as you more than 12 months ago.
So you could have waded through the entire linuxSA archive
to get some out-of-date recommendations....)

Anyway, the canonical reference on this subject is here:

<A HREF="http://www.openssh.com/windows.html">http://www.openssh.com/windows.html</A>

I've been getting users to use putty for a while,
and I am unhappy with it for two reasons:

1.	It doesn't do real public key crypto,
	as in the dual public/secret key thing.
	It only does passwords.
	And the openssh server is only capable of
	making _all_ accounts accessible by user passowrd
	or none of them - and that means that I can't just
	let particular users use passwords and the rest use
	real crypto. This also means that you have to make
	sure that aall accounts have unguessable passwords.
	(I know you have to do that anyway, but you have to
	be extra sure in this case.)

2.	It has no secure FTP protocol.
	I really only want users to be able to do the 
	scp thing, and not the user shell.
	I've seen references to "sftp" somewhere, which
	seems to not exclude SSH shell access anyway.
	<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query</A>=sftp-server&sektion=8
	That's a generic SSH weakness, in my opinion.

My kludge solution to (1) has been to have two
sshd processes - one for real ssh clients on
port 22, and the other for putty clients on a different
port - and the other port has a config file which
restricts it to only the putty users.
I also generate random passwords for the putty users
and hope that they never work out how to change
their password to something memorisable.
