&gt; It sounds like the problem is incurring in your sysadmin, not the software.
&gt; 
&gt; What is his problem with allowing non-priveledged ports (ie 1024 and up) to
&gt; pass thru the firewall?

Probably he wants to restrict traffic to just what he wants...

&gt; 
&gt; TCP uses two connections, always. One for control, one for data. Passive or
&gt; Active just determines who initiates the connection for the data.

TCP=FTP, I presume...

&gt; 
&gt; rsh and rcp are an alternative, but these are definately not all that
&gt; secure!
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an idea thou - on your linux box, where you have root access, setup
&gt; something on port 21 -- it doesn't have to be FTP, remember. Maybe sshd?
&gt; 
&gt; Compile up ssh on the solaris box and rename it to ftp.
&gt; (You may want to modify it to report as ftp as well,
&gt; but with a flag that turns it into ssh, just to be sneaky)
&gt; 
&gt; If you admin asks, tell him you modified ftp to work over a different,
&gt; static, port. Its close enough to the truth.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, use ssh, scp, sftp, or alternatively use its port-forwarding abilities
&gt; to allow whatever the hell you like! ;)

This is where packet filtering will always fail -- if you leave
one single thing open, and there is someone who has access to
both sides of hte firewall, they can tunnel any IP (or even
non-IP) traffic through that link. Basically, if you have a
dertermined person on the inside, packet filtering won't do
anything but hinder them and give you a false sense of security.
It really becomes a management problem then... Though host
security will help (but you have to be pretty thorough -- if
someone can just plug their laptop ethernet into a port, that
won't help either... even if you can stop that, a really
determined person could tunnel ssh optically, encoding bits as
colour changes on a monitor... you can never counter a
determined insider with technology alone...)
