Not that this is a linux topic or anything, but anyway....

Simon,

Those things don't matter to me, but if they did, I'd
not want my stuff in someone else's facility.

An example of this is the total fiasco of
www.theregister.co.uk in the last 2 weeks.
The collocated with a big facility in London with
all you mention plus much more.
(From memory, it was level3 or something.)
But when their system failed, it was a huge saga
to get the thing going again, which was very substantially
_hindered_ by the fact that it was all in a secure facility.
In their own offices, there would have been no problem.
Right now, I can't get through to their site again.
If they had been using a modest machine in their own
offices (above a cafe or something), they would not
have had these very damaging outages.

Also, 300 GBytes/month = approx 1 Mbit/sec, which is
not so difficult for an SME to afford these days.
I serve 35,000 visits per month with just 15% of
my 33k link. That's 1400 MBytes/month.
How many SMEs need to serve 35,000 visits a month?
Obviously a 1 Mbit/sec link would get me
1 million visits per month.

I still think that the ideal internet presence for
99% of businesses is a linux box and a 33k modem.

I really wish their site would come up so that I
can get you the link to their fiasco description.
After they posted a very long description, the
problem has persisted.
This gives some idea of their problems though:
<A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u</A>=off&mode_w=on&site=www.theregister.co.uk

But for companies with no IT staff, I guess the
hosting service is the way to go!

Just my US$0.01 worth....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
