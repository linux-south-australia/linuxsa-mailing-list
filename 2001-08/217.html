I called Dell in the US and it's more complicated than reported.

Dell USA will support Linux on all its products.  But it won't
sell some products retail, because the systems and support
pain leaves them with no profit.  Especially on desktop
systems where profit is very thin anyway.  Where demand
and profit exists (eg: servers) they are more than happy
to retail a machine with Linux.

If you order any machine in bulk (ie: are a medium/large
business, education or ordering 50+) then Dell will install
and support Linux.  For that matter if the customer covers
the copyright issues, Dell will install any binary image.

This leaves you and me in a not-too-bad position.  You can
buy a Dell PC with no OS at retail.  Because Dell do support
Linux for their bigger customers you can have some assurance
that Red Hat Linux will install from distribution CD with
little hassle.

I'm not sure what the Dell AsiaPac story is.  It's important
to note that Dell USA and Dell AsiaPac sell the same hardware
(almost, they are made in different factories) but have little
else in common.  For example, you can't pay Dell AsiaPac to
have a machine shipped from Dell USA.

If Dell AsiaPac see higher retail demand for Linux on desktop
or notebook than Dell USA then Dell AP will go their own way.
Dell is essentially a box shifter and will sell whatever
it can make a quid on, even at the price of global
inconsistencies.
