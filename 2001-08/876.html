&gt; &gt;&gt;I now find myself in the position of having to do a re-install,
&gt; &gt;&gt;because apt-get -f dist-upgrade, or apt-get upgrade, etc, after having
&gt; &gt;&gt;got over 120MB of packages from ftp.au.debian.org, always fails trying
&gt; &gt;&gt;to upgrade gnotepad+.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; With what error? What's it looking for or failing on? Are you running
&gt; &gt; unstable, testing, or stable?
&gt;
&gt; Well. I was running Potato, trying to upgrade to Woody. Its on the back
&gt; burner now :-)

burner? you have 2 CD-Rs? That's extravagant...

ahem.

&gt; &gt; I've been using debian for nearly two years, and I've generally found
&gt; &gt; that the unstable distribution goes through periods of being, well,
&gt; &gt; unstable. Fortunately, the rest of the time everything just _works_.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but it wasn't giving me good error messages etc ...

what were the not good error messages? You're not really helping yourself
here, Richard... :)

&gt; &gt;&gt;I also can't use man, and X will not start, because it can't find the
&gt; &gt;&gt;fixed font, and so on.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Interesting.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Why can't you use man?
&gt;
&gt; Well, I was in the middle of an upgrade. apt-get had got lots of things,
&gt; and was applying them, but it screwed up. Once I deleted gnotepad+,
&gt; ap-get was happy to upgrade the rest, and man started working again. Of
&gt; course, I had to fix the libdb thing.

nice error messages again :)

&gt; &gt; What xfont* packages do you have installed? I've got "xfonts-scalable",
&gt; &gt; "xfonts-base", and "xfonts-75dpi".
&gt;
&gt; This turned out to be a mixture of XFree86 3.3.6 stuff and XFree86 4.0.3
&gt; stuff ...
&gt;
&gt; How, however, X just won't display anything.  It starts, but shows me a
&gt; blank screen. However, lots of X things are running.

Richard, I'm surprised... Unless you are purposely trying to keep
information from others so you can have the pleasure of solving your
problems yourself, you're not doing that good a job of explaining what
exactly is not working, what error messages you are getting, etc etc etc...

:)
