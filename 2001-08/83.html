&gt; Code Red seems to be emitting about 100 probes per hour to

&gt; That's about 100 million probes per second being generated
&gt; by about 150,000 hosts or something (CNN's number), 
&gt; which sounds a bit high
&gt; to me in terms of probes per infected host.
&gt; I don't see how they can be emitting 650 probes per second 
&gt; each. Maybe the infected host count is higher now already.


My apologies.
That's out by a factor of 100.
That should be roughly 1 probe per hour for each IP host
address in the world, which gives only 4 billion per hour
world-wide, and that translates to 1 million per second.

And for about 100,000 Code red infected machines, that's
only 10 probes per second per infected host.
That sounds more credible.

But still, for someone routing a /16 subnet,
that would be 65,000 probes per hour going through
the link. Sounds like a lot, but probably that's an
insignificant load. 

I've seen some reports that there are now "commentators"
saying that it's about time that the "software industry"
(isn't that Microsoft?) did more to protect consumers from
viruses and worms and things.
I think the tide is turning against Microsoft's image.

Cheers again,
Alan Kennington.
