&gt; For those who are interested, it appears that this is not an asia-pacific
&gt; variant of CodeRed, but a smarter sequel that prefers to attack sites with
&gt; the same first 8 bits of address space. This may have been done to speed
&gt; propagation or to save bandwidth.

The fact that it is still global but /8 specific strongly suggests
that the motive is to make it go faster.
In fact, some people have been saying that the new version goes
faster even without taking into account the probable
optimization due to the geographical correlation due to
choosing the same /8 subnet. But I have noticed some
probes from outside 203.*.*.*. So the rule isn't absolute.

It's most likely that someone, somwhere really wants this to
be a big issue. Maybe the original author was so excited by
the first flush of "success" that they have rewritten it to
get a second "flush" out of it.

It's not clear that it's an anti-MS thing.
If it were, then surely it would put up slogans against MS.
This must be about the quickest and most public round-up of
"owned" machines ever. 
All the script kiddies will be working overtime to get in and
"own" as many of the new cracked systems as they can.

By the way, this Code Red thing is demonstrating one of the
disadvantages with IP-based hosting.
If I had used name-based virtual hosting, I'd have 20 times
less bandwidth being wasted right now on my humble 33k link.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
