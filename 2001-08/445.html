 &gt; &gt; You could just change to use an ISP that blocks the probes for you at 
 &gt; &gt; their expense, so you don't have to. What's your time worth? You 
 &gt; &gt; could change ISP's, save money as a result, and spend all of your 
 &gt; &gt; valuable time doing something valuable instead.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The problem is that there are good HTTP packets in among the
 &gt; bad HTTP packets, and I don't know which are bad until
 &gt; they've already sent their request - which does the harm already.

The ISP knows whether the packets are bad before they hit your 
(chargeable) link, and blocks them before they do damage.  And I'd
contend that there are no "good" HTTP packets which contain get
requests for /default.ida (not anymore, anyway).

 &gt; Similarly, I wouldn't expect Bigpond to be able or willing to
 &gt; put in sophisticated application-level blocking, nor would
 &gt; I expect it to work correctly if they did.

That's why Simon suggested using another ISP :-)

 &gt; &gt; You have a choice of ISP's. Why on earth keep supporting the large, 
 &gt; &gt; boring, unresponsive one that you use now?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Well, they're not at all as bad as people say.
 &gt; They are very responsive to me.

They haven't fixed CodeRed for you, have they?
