Linux still needs good administration too though.. and although it is better
and needs less maintenance when implemented well, it is harder to reach that
state. The out-of-the-box functionality and security keeps improving, and
starts getting easier to use for people brought up with Windoze.

Personally, I like to keep things where I can vi them, but for more complex
issues, GUIs are a bit nicer; as long as Linux distros continue to provide
both remote-control-by-shell and gui wrappers for the ppl who want them,
I'll be happy. All it takes is a recompile and 5 minutes of 'rm -rf'ing to
remove the bloat.. you can't say that about windows..

&gt;
&gt; Then i would not be stuck with using MS based software, as everyone would be
&gt; using linux. :)
&gt; But... when i leave school, i shall change completely to linux, as i will
&gt; have more time then.

&gt; &gt; The backdoor would allow someone to 'auto update' the worm too..
&gt; &gt; It'll be interesting to see what will come out next, piggybacking upon the
&gt; &gt; already-opened backdoor.
