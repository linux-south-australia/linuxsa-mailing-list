Hi Alan,
	I found similar problems with my installation of Mandrake, if you set up a 
network or Webserver when you run the installation. 


The solution I found , No guarantee's, was to In kppp select the following 
items/buttons   (Note this is all from KDE not the terminal)
Start kppp select setup / select the account / edit / DNS page tab
- check that "disable existing DNS servers during connection" is selected
I've found this is all that is needed in most setups.
Occasionally the following is also needed. 
from the same place as the above select the Gateway tab and check that 
"Assign default route to this gateway" is selected. 

I'm not sure why this works but perhaps one of more technically minded can 
let us both know.

Hope this helps

&gt; I'm using KPPP and have used the Howto to set it up
&gt; I'm convinced its Auhenticating as Ozemail isn't kicking
&gt; me out. I can ping the local and remote connection
&gt; IPs that KPPP reports to me when its connected. There
&gt; is no traffic over the line at all (onless I ping the remote
&gt; connection)
&gt;
&gt; What else can I do to test what the problem is?
&gt;
&gt; Help greatly appreciated.
