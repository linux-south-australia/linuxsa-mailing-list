&gt; They don't say many good things about the
&gt; approach that the charity is taking.

I'd actually have to side with Microsoft[1] here; it's their
license.  So long as a consumer has the freedom to exercise
their choice, then it isn't much of an issue to me.  It's when
things start getting forced one way or the other that it becomes
an issue (in this case, the charity apparently trying to force
goodwill out of Microsoft, whether they "deserve" it or not).

&gt; And they say that in Australia there are 3 other
&gt; such PC charities - all of which use linux instead
&gt; of the MS OS family.

It's a strange mindset, and it just seems to be a self perpetuating
loop ("you're a big, faceless corporation - please may we have more
of your products?").  As the Register says, it could so easily
backfire on them.


[1]  I'm not anti-Microsoft, I'm anti-crap.  It's not my fault that
Microsoft products comprises a large subset of that.
