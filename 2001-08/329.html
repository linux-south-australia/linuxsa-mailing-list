I disagree completely. I didn't want someone to tell me I was an idiot,
albeit in a nice tone.
Obvioulsy you don't know much about Cisco 1900. they have 24 x 10Mb and 2 x
100Mb ports. we have 6 of these and one port is used as 100 Full Duplex to a
2900 switch (24 x 100Mb, 2 x 100Mb fx for people who don't know cisco). i
have a server on a second 100Mb port.
I want to force 100Mb Full Duplex. any *helpful* comments?
thanks
Matthew

Subject: Re: Force 100 Mb with Tulip Driver

&gt; I've just found out how to force the Tulip driver to full duplex by
&gt; adding
&gt;
&gt; options tulip full_duplex=1
&gt;
&gt; which works fine.
&gt;
&gt; My questions is how do i force the network card to 100Mb.
If you are forcing the driver to full duplex, one would assume that
you are forcing the card. The comments in the driver code insinuate
that setting this option is not necessary if you have an
autonegotiating switch. If you hard set the switch you would imagine
that setting that dull_duplex option is all that is required.
&gt; We are backing up a linux box thru samba and getting heaps of errors
&gt; so I'm making both the Cisco 1900 switch and the linux box 100mb
&gt; Full Duplex.
A Cisco 1900 can't do 100Mb. It is a 10Mb switch. That could be your
problem.
&gt; We had a problem a while ago and Cisco recommends that all servers
&gt; and links to other switches be not set to negotiate.
Routers and switches, yes, but autonegotiate is fine for most servers
and workstations.
Cheers
Alex!
