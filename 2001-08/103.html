Adam,

This is a fascinating little topic, which caused me much
fuss the first time I did it.
I still don't know how to do it neatly.

Anyway, this is the set of things which I think are
required. I hope I won't miss anything.

In the relevant scope, you need to specify the Authentication
file paths. E.g.

&lt;Directory /&gt;
    AuthUserFile  /etc/httpd/passwd
    AuthGroupFile /etc/httpd/group  
    # ....
&lt;/Directory&gt; 

E.g. see 
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_auth.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_auth.html</A>#authuserfile

In such a file, you have to somehow include some passwords.
E.g.

riemann:0vz2nO4S97eyo

The only way I know of doing this is to use the passwd command to
make password appear in the /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file,
and then copy it from there to the /etc/httpd/passwd file.
There's probably some tool to do this more conveniently.

Then in your .htaccess file for the directory you want
to control access to, you put something like this:

AuthType        Basic
AuthName        xyz
AuthUserFile    passwd
AuthGroupFile   groups
&lt;Limit GET&gt;
require user    riemann
&lt;/Limit&gt; 

Apparently, this puts up a dialog box specifying a "realm"
for the password. See
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html</A>#authname

I think this AuthName thing is something like a
label for the resource you are accessing, whereas the
"user" can be any of several people who are allowed to
access that domain. The "realm" seems to have no
significance except to prompt the user in the dialog box.
The "user" must exist in the password file, such as
/etc/httpd/passwd.

It looks from the documentation as though the 
AuthName and "require" can be specified in the
httpd.conf file in a Directory context as well as in
the .htaccess file.

<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html</A>#require
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html</A>#authname

I hope I haven't missed out anything...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
