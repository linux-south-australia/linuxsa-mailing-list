&gt; &gt; &gt; That's the rub.  A well placed printf() speaks volumes about your
&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding of the program that's being debugged.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Oh come on.  A breakpoint shows exactly the same understanding
&gt; &gt; and avoids a stack of source code control issues.
&gt; 
&gt; It all depends on what kind of software you're writing.
&gt; I'd divide software into 3 categories for this purpose:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.	Realtime, such as device drivers and comms
&gt; 	protocol software.
&gt; 	Here I don't mean realtime as in fast.
&gt; 	I mean that the time at which things get executed
&gt; 	is critical to correct performance.
&gt; 	I.e. there are deadlines.
&gt; 2.	Event-driven interactive.
&gt; 3.	Batch jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; Using a debugging tool which slows down execution in
&gt; category 1 is going to alter things totally.
&gt; Generally it just isn't possible to find bugs
&gt; with a debugging tool in the case of device drivers
&gt; and user-space protocol software.

Waffle.  Sure debuggers are useless if you are intending to step through line 
by line, but if you're going to do that you might as well try typing with your 
nose.  

A few strategic breakpoints can help you debug just about anything.  Break 
around where the bug is suspected, evaluate some locals and *think* about the 
problem.  I've seen far too many attempts at debugging where print(f|k)'s have 
been added ad nauseum and the problem either goes away, or is hidden so deep in 
the pile of outputted crap.  And what really amazes me is people will keep 
going down this path for days and not start thinking about the problem.  
Sheesh.
 
&gt; In case 2, you probably can use a debugger, but sometimes
&gt; things inside GUI libraries could be altered if you
&gt; change the timing. E.g. buffer overflows might not happen
&gt; if you go step by step - or they might happen when they
&gt; wouldn't normally.

I wouldn't have thought that buffer overflows are all that common.  Most bugs 
IMHO are much simplier.  But you are right, don't use a debugger for debugging 
stack overflows or memory leaks etc.
 
&gt; Case 3 is where a debugger should always be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Since I've done a fair heap of software in category 1,
&gt; I just can't use a debugger, and I have to get in the habit
&gt; of using things like PRINTK as a #define macro for
&gt; printk which is turned on by a DEBUG macro, or else I
&gt; use the #if 1 ... #endif technique that you mentioned.

Or something like:

#ifdef DEBUG

  void _Assert(char *, unsigned);  /* Your func */

  #define ASSERT(f) \
     if (f)         \
        NULL;       \
     else           \
        _Assert(__FILE__, __LINE__)

#else

  #define ASSERT(f) NULL

#endif

which is low overhead and rather than just dumping stuff, you are asserting 
what should be the case (so it makes you think about what is [in]valid at this 
point of time)

&gt; My conclusion is that I nearly always prefer to
&gt; use the printf trace-line method of debugging.
&gt; By accumulating such trace lines over time,
&gt; it I get in trouble, I can always turn them all on
&gt; and see what's happening.

All well and good, but if the problem isn't due to thread interaction, memory 
leaks or buffer overflows, a quick session in a source-level debugger can be 
very quick in finding a problem.

&gt; I regard insertion of trace lines as being almost as 
&gt; important as checking the sanity of all function parameters
&gt; and return values.

Good habit to get into.
