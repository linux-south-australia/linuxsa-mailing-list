WebMail is generally platform-independant, as it is written in some sort
of scripting language (or anything else executable as a CGI). "... on
Debian" seems a little ambiguous.

&gt; need to be able to access POP3 and IMAP mailboxes on another (Solaris)
&gt; mail server, and ideally, would be able to use it as SMTP host as

But the mail is being accessed from the Solaris box, isn't it? Why
deliver mail to one machine (and move it to the Solaris box) when you
could just deliver it *straight* to the Solaris box?

You could achieve it a number of ways, but it seems a bit of a waste of
time. Seeing as Solaris is a UNIX, you can install any of the popular,
secure MTAs such as Postfix or Qmail.

Also, using the machine as an SMTP host isn't reliant on web mail.
That's up to some other piece of software, as I'm sure you know.

Another interpretation could be that you want the machine running
webmail to send the mail (rather than relay it to another machine).
Again, that's either going to require a MTA or a bunch of code in the
webmail application that opens TCP connection to the appropriate server
and send the message.

That's going to be unlikely, as most of the webmail applications seem to
call /usr/bin/sendmail. Postfix has a sendmail-compatible wrapper to
achieve this, as does Qmail (I think).

&gt; well... The other requirement is that it comes as a Debian .deb package
&gt; and runs on potato (as in Debian 2.2, not as in chips)...

IMP can be downloaded as a .deb package, but there's a lot of other
configuration that needs to happen to install it. I doubt that dpkg (or
whatever the the Debian packaging tool is called). IMP also requires
Horde, an SQL Database and PHPLib, all of which require a bit of
thinking to make it work.

&gt; I've been looking about, but can't really see anything that indicates
&gt; one is better than another, so I'm looking for opinions here...

We run IMP+Horde for 1100 users and it works without a hitch. Postfix is
used as the MTA.

I'd give up on installing it from a package, unless you're prepared to
write a giant script to do all the configuration work for you.

There was a thread on this a little while ago on FreeBSD-Questions. I
ended up writing something in Python that cleans out the database
(Sessions in PHPLib can get left behind and slow things down after a
while on systems with a large amount of users). <A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/">http://www.plug.cx/</A> has
it there somewhere...
