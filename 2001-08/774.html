&gt; Is there a snazzy command under Debian that provides an interface just
&gt; like the installer.

hmm...

&gt; I have tried dselect, but it does not provide an interface like the
&gt; Debian Task Installer used during installation.

you may find that console-apt is nicer than dselect, although the interface
is still odd (I don't know what it is with Debian developers and their
lobotomised interfaces -- they are both non-intuitive and unique... It seems
that every time someone designs an interface for debian (well, on dselect
and console-apt at least), they come up with a key for everything, which
happens to be different to every other program that ever existed... if only
they could decide what to use then use it... puh!)...

anyway, using console-apt, hit '/' for search, and then type 'task', and
then 'n' to go to the next item that matches (sounds like some other
programs, right, except that you can't search backwards, as far as I know...
puh!)... most of these "task-*" packages are empty packages that just
install a set of packages...


WHile we're on the subject of debian packages, is there a way to find all
packages that aren't depended on by any other package? Specifically, I'd
really like to be able to purge all unneeded packages from my system... (eg,
maybe I installed gcc once, and it installed a bunch of other packages, and
now I want to remove gcc and those packages that it depends on that aren't
depended on by any other package that I want...)

in fact, there are a number of things I'd like to be able to do that most
apt things don't seem to like doing... I'd like to be able to update to an
older version (eg I try woody, it doesn't like me, I go back to
potato...)... Or to be able to selectively update chunks from woody, like X
and the kernel (where X is Graham... sorry, bad late show reference),
without updating everything else, but still get new releases of said
packages when I apt-get update && apt-get upgrade... I also want debian to
clean my room.

Maybe I haven't looked into this enough (probably true...)
