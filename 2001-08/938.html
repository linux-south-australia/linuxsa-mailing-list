&gt; Those things don't matter to me, but if they did, I'd
&gt; not want my stuff in someone else's facility.

Alan, I'd like to introcude you to the concept of "reality". Those things cost a lot of money, not just in terms of acquiring them, but in terms of running, managing and maintaining them. If you can split those costs between many clients, like a colocation facility can, or can piggyback off someone who already has these facilities, like an ISP, then it is likely to be cheaper than you can provide yourself. There are numerous other benefits also -- if you grow too big for your office, you don't have to relovate your computer room (which is an expesive operation in itself).

If these things really matter to you, and you don't have infinite budget, then doing them in your own facility is often too expensive, and hence, you would not be able to provide the required reliability and level of service.

&gt; An example of this is the total fiasco of
&gt; www.theregister.co.uk in the last 2 weeks.

Alan, there are examples of everything everywhere. I'm certain that if I could be bothered, I could find egs of colocation facilities that work well, and in-office facilities that don't work well...

&gt; The collocated with a big facility in London with
&gt; all you mention plus much more.
&gt; (From memory, it was level3 or something.)
&gt; But when their system failed, it was a huge saga
&gt; to get the thing going again, which was very substantially
&gt; _hindered_ by the fact that it was all in a secure facility.

there's always a compromise. If they were in their own facilities, they would have discovered that something else was a critical problem.

&gt; In their own offices, there would have been no problem.

no, in their own offices, access to their facilities wouldn't have been a problem. they most certainly would have had other problems.

&gt; Right now, I can't get through to their site again.
&gt; If they had been using a modest machine in their own
&gt; offices (above a cafe or something), they would not
&gt; have had these very damaging outages.

no, but they would have had the cost of installing all their own computer room gear, maintaining it etc... (or, if they used "a modest machine", then you would _never_ be able to get to their site, as it would be unable to cope with the traffic.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, 300 GBytes/month = approx 1 Mbit/sec, which is
&gt; not so difficult for an SME to afford these days.

t's harder to afford if it needs to be reliable, and cope with the bursty nature of internet communication. Surely you don't think they are serving a constant 1 Mbit/sec? They would be more likely to fluctuate between a few K/sec and 100Mbit/sec... and that's expensive... particularly if they want to be available for those mad peaks when they get /.ed or something...

&gt; I serve 35,000 visits per month with just 15% of
&gt; my 33k link. That's 1400 MBytes/month.

15% constantly? or 100% for 15% of the time? Is your site mission critical? (I doubt it) does it matter to you that someone may get no (or slow) response becaause there are three people accessing your site simultaneously? didn't think so.

&gt; How many SMEs need to serve 35,000 visits a month?
&gt; Obviously a 1 Mbit/sec link would get me
&gt; 1 million visits per month.

Some  do way more... some want to plan for growth. Some have reasons for colocating other than bandwidth...

&gt; 
&gt; I still think that the ideal internet presence for
&gt; 99% of businesses is a linux box and a 33k modem.

that's because you assume that 99% of businesses are like yours. The ideal for 50% of businesses is no internet presence at all. Maybe another 25% could be like you... Then there are businesses who have other requirements and other budgets...

&gt; 
&gt; I really wish their site would come up so that I
&gt; can get you the link to their fiasco description.
&gt; After they posted a very long description, the
&gt; problem has persisted.
&gt; This gives some idea of their problems though:
&gt; <A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?mode_u</A>=off&mode_w=on&site=www.theregister.co.uk
&gt; 
&gt; But for companies with no IT staff, I guess the
&gt; hosting service is the way to go!

and for companies with many IT staff, with different requirements...

Seriously, Alan, just because you don't share the requirements, doesn't mean they aren't legitimate for a lot of businesses... businesses make decisions based on their own situations, budgets and requirements, and often enough, you won't have even thought of them until they tell you... :)
