Richard,

As someone else mentioned, the AAAA is not (supposedly) a genuine worm.

But anyway, we've all noticed that the black hats place very strong
store on "lifting up their name" as the PNG people [the country, not
the graphics format] would say.
On one occasion while reading through the logs an intrusion by two Italian
users, I noticed that they spent about an hour or so trying to
work out how to advertise their hack/crack to a "shouten" site.
They got the password wrong the first time etc. etc.
And while they were fumbling over this, they got firewalled out.

A well-known case is the Canadian guy who bragged in a chat group
about bringing down Yahoo. And the FBI just happened to be in the
same group!


The idea of a black hat _not_ putting some sort of identifier on
their work would be unthinkable - which differentiates them
from, say, what I'd expect a government-sponsored body to do
in time of war.
How could they brag or "shout" about their accomplishment
if it looks the same as everyone else's?

In fact, what surprises me is that they don't put some message
in the payload instead of boring X or N characters.
I imagine that the first 100 or so bytes don't make
any different to the efficacy. They went to the trouble of
incorporating the phrase "code red II" in the part of the
message that doesn't appear in the http log files after all.


In the case of white hats using AAAA, I know that some sites are
requesting HTTP logs grepped with XXXX.
If they used XXXX, then their own probes would show up in the
logs.
I sent my logs to this mob:
