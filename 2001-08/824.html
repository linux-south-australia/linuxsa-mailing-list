&gt; Can anyone tell me when Linux first started supporting SMP?

not sure, but suspect it was quite some time ago... kernel 2.1, I think... I
saw a web page mentioning SMP and 486SX's...

&gt; I am being told that Win2K is the first Operating System to
&gt; support SMP, to
&gt; which I thought was crap. As far as I can remember it was supported when
&gt; I was first installing Mandrake 6.0, is that true?

it's crap... Windows has done pretty much nothing first... I'm reasonably
sure that Win NT4 did SMP before Win2K... (by the same token, Linux has done
pretty much nothing first...)

there's always an academic OS that did everything first a few decades before
mainstream OS's, and then there's a blurry line between academic ones and
mainstream ones...

&gt; I am also convinced that the "inovative" new Windows Terminal Services in
&gt; Win2K is a rip off of VNC, any one know any more about this?

well, it's a variant on the theme of networked GUI environments...

I think X was the first in the mainstream, but there's been a rash of them
lately -- VNC, Terminal Services (which is a re-badging of Citrix), and I'm
sure there's a few others...
