Nathan,

I had similar problems getting RH6 onto a couple of my 486's from the
APC magazine Linux Pocketbook CDs. I was installing to blank hard
drives in both cases. The RH 6.2 graphical install would crash almost
immediately on the 16MB box. The 32MB box would install about a
hundred packages and then run out of memory - with a 64MB swapfile.

Installing from text mode didn't work either. Immediate kernel panic
on one and death-during-install on the other. I've had similar results
on two other installs from this 6.2 disc and I wonder if it has a
problem?

The solution which worked for both my 486's was to do a text-mode
install of RedHat -6.1-. Set it all up the way I wanted; and then
upgrade using the RPMs from the 6.2 CD. You might be able to do a
similar trick to upgrade your 5.2?

Incidentally, the 16MB 486 is now an X terminal for my kids. And the
32MB box is now an Internet server & gateway. RH 6.x is probably about
as far as I want to go on such underpowered hardware.

Although if anyone does have some 72pin SIMMs they don't want then
contact me off-list. The kids now want to run <A HREF="mailto:SETI@Home">SETI@Home</A> as well :)


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
