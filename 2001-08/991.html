Mark!

&gt; hdc: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady Seek Complete DataRequest Error }
&gt; hdc: read_intr: error 0x40 { UnrecoverableError }, LBAsect=2363618, sector=2170838
&gt; Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000034

Apparently the data the file system was serving, if any, managed to be
so garbled the kernel itself couldn't work out what was happening. This
is not a good sign.

&gt; At about the time these errors came up, my hard drive made some funny
&gt; noises (usually it is rather quiet).  It sounded sort of like:
&gt; 
&gt; sca-sca-sca-sca  short pause  sca-sca-sca-sca

I've heard that noise before. I would suggest it's probably the heads
dancing on the disks.

&gt; So, I want to know --- is this a problem with my hard drive?  Or is it
&gt; a software problem?

That is a serious problem with your hard drive.

&gt; The drive itself is only about a year old.  It is an IBM 15Gig ATA100
&gt; 7200rpm drive.  I had been lead to believe that the IBMs were very
&gt; reliable so I will be rather surprised if it is indeed a drive hardware
&gt; problem.

I recently saw a 70Gb IBM die which was about 1 or 2 months old. It was
on warranty. Apparently this was already a replacement for one which
died just before that. I thought it was software, but sure enough the
hard drive had carked it.

&gt; Any ideas about what I should do now?  I have backups of some of my
&gt; important stuff on the drive, but there is stuff on the /home partition
&gt; that I'd prefer not to lose if I can avoid it.

Get another Linux distro running on another disk and have a go at
attempting to "dd" the whole home partition off of that drive. Given the
noises I wouldn't hold too much hope but it would be worth a try. In
addition, I'd be inclined to turn that disk off for as long as possible
given the whacko noises you describe.

Also, try using reiserfsck.
