In the last couple of Days Andrew Reid & Brian Astill
pointed out that I may have managed to embarass myself
(this is what happens when you try to limit all
mailing list activity to one hour per week!):

&lt;various replies snipped for brevity&gt;

The problem being I mixed up two subjects in the one
e-mail, mainly 

(subject 1) me defending Ians's requirement that we
have compatibility and 

(subject 2) me sharing some of my experiences with
Linux to date, as an attempt to point out that there
are still problems in using the system as a Desktop,
which most of us here are capable of doing, but
expecting a new PC user to cope with some of the
challenges may be a bit much.

&gt; 
&gt; Andrew, this is plain silly.  Since when have the
&gt; low-end obsolete PCs
&gt; PCsforKids supply been fitted with USB mice?  While
&gt; we are about it, do
&gt; you expect the disadvanteged peThe problem being I

ople who are the
&gt; intended recipients of
&gt; PCsforKids to have Internet access? (If not, browser
&gt; features won't be a
&gt; problem).  How about the need for color graphics
&gt; printers, or (Heaven
&gt; save us!) FAX facilities?  To lapse into the
&gt; vernacular, "get real".


New color graphics printers can be obtained for under
$100. This means it is quite feasable that old  or
second hand printers could be obtained for nil or
fractional cost; and who's to say what kind of
equipment we get donated in the future. USB mice could
be had wholesale for under $20 last year, who knows
what donation-friendly corporates will be throwing out
next year.

Also, although specifically this topic is donated PCs
for disadvantaged people in the Salisbury area, my
points also apply in trying to convince anyone in
general they should use M$ alternatives. (Again, I'm
guilty of mixing subject I guess). 

My main point remains:

Linux on the Desktop is improving, it is at the point
where technically competent users such as ourselves
here can handle it, but not yet ready for _Novice
Computer Users_. Perhaps this should be a new thread
for discussion... (I'm probably still not properly
articulating what I really want to say :-(

What I am trying to do is think ahead and think of
issues / problems/ questions that non-Linux users will
come up with, when we are advocating to them, and try
and find responses.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hence the need to try and set up a Linux system,
&gt; which
&gt; &gt; will provide robustness and zero-licensing
&gt; problems,
&gt; &gt; that is also capable of providing an extremely
&gt; user
&gt; &gt; friendly environment for learning and actual
&gt; &gt; usefulness. 
&gt; 
&gt; Just about any late-version Linux or FreeBSD system
&gt; will do that.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; At least we can run SO on both Windows and Linux
&gt; &gt; platforms
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;  So will Abiword.
&gt; I also challenge you to find the hugely different
&gt; aspects of Gnumeric
Your probably right. I am probably biased in that for
a long time I have been a "power user" of Excel and am
used to the large variety of tasks that I have been
easily able to accomplish using this product, and I
need to put my "new user" cap on when considering
alternatives.

Andrew
