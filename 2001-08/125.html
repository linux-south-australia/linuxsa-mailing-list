Well, in my defense, I was confused by the fact that the difference in 
time that I was seeing was 15.5 hours. If it was 9.5, I think I would 
have spotted it immediately.

The problem was that Date::Manip looks in the following places to decide 
what timezone you are in:

   $Date::Manip::TZ (set with Date_Init or in Manip.pm)
   $ENV{TZ}
   the unix `date` command (if available)
   $main::TZ
   /etc/TIMEZONE
   /etc/timezone

Of course, by not having set the timezone in the Date::Manip package at 
install time, it was getting the timezone from the date program. While 
my machine is set to Adelaide, Australia, and the command:

   date +%z

gives the result "+0930" as it should, it would appear that Date::Manip 
is looking at "date +%Z" to get the timezone, which reports "CST", and 
not the "CAST" that Date::Manip recognises as the Australian version of CST.

Thus, CST is -0600 to Date::Manip, and this was giving the 15.5 hour 
difference.

Hmmmmm.
