The rate is almost certainly determined by the number of IP
addresses you have exposed to the net, not the bit-rate
of the pipe.

For Code Red the First, I estimated various rates in the range
1 to 2 probes per hour per IP address.
But the greater "efficiency" (in the sense that Pol Pot
was "efficient") of Code Red II has led to numbers like
8 to 10 probes per IP address per hour in 203.* space.
Some reports seem to indicate that some US-dominated
/8 spaces are getting higher rates than that.
That's not surprising.
I'm observing mostly Asia-located infected hosts, and
the number of Australia-located infected hosts has been reducing
to some extent over time.
(Here are my cumulative lists:
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/extra/XXXXau.txt">http://www.topology.org/extra/XXXXau.txt</A>
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/extra/XXXX.txt.">http://www.topology.org/extra/XXXX.txt.</A>)

Using these rough numbers, a scan rate of 100 per second
translates to about 360,000 per hour, which would be
expected for about 40,000 IP addresses.
That's not too far from 65,535.
Is that the IP-space-width of your pipe, Glen?

I'm talking about incoming probes here.
Maybe Mark's higher rate than 100 /second is outgoing probes?

By the way, here is my webalizer analysis of the logs for
a very unpopular web site indeed (www.alankennington.com):
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/extra/site/ak/usage_200108.html">http://www.topology.org/extra/site/ak/usage_200108.html</A>
Since there is virtually not real traffic here, this shows
clearly the effects of Code Red I and II as they stared up.


Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I wanted to start this e-mail with:
"You are on the way to destruction make your time.", which
would have been appropriate, but I didn't want tarnish my
reputation for having a serious attitude at all times.

PPS. Webalizer is one of the slowest programs I've ever used.
It makes star office look like a greyhound with rocket propulsion.
All my attempts to turn off the DNS look-up in webalizer
have failed. The facility mentioned in the manual doesn't
seem to work. Does anyone know how to force webalizer to
_not_ lookup DNS translations for addresses that are not
already resolved in its DNS cache?
