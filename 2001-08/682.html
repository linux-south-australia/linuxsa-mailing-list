<H1>Redhat 7.1 filesystem problems?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Is there any filesystem problems with RedHat 7.1, or with the kernel it
uses? I've got 2 machines running RH7.1, one is my desktop machine (and I
occasionally go into linux, but mainly use windows), and a gateway which is
always on.

A few weeks ago I rebooted the gateway box (no new kernel or anything, just
wanted to make sure that if the box lost power then came back, it'd start
all services correctly), and it went down properly, and when it was coming
back up, it said there was a file system problem, and ran fsck. I think i
installed redhat on that machine that same day, or maybe it was a few days
before, but it wasn't even a week.

Last night I used linux on my desktop machine for a short time, then
rebooted to windows, and everything was fine. About 5 minutes ago I tried
booting back to linux and it ran fsck, then the lost+found directory had a
wrong type and I had to run fsck manually. I just ran it with the -y flag (I
know this is probably a bad idea, but I don't have any valuable data on that
partition), and it went though about 4 or 5 screens full of whatever it was
fixing.

This is worrying me because the machines were properly shut down and
filesystems successfully unmounted, yet problems occur anyway. I didn't have
this problem for the short time I was running Mandrake 8.0 (although I was
using rasier (sp?) not ext2fs), or when I was running older versions of
redhat. From memory, the redhat installation doesn't give the option to use
other filesystem types than ext2fs, at least in the non-fdisk screen in text
mode.

My desktop machine's motherboard is a Asus P3VF4X (running the Via Apollo
Pro 4x chipset, i think. don't know what IDE controller) but I don't know
what the gateway machine's hardware is. Are there problems with these
chipsets?

Thanks,
Andy
