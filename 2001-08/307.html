&gt; &gt; In case 2, you probably can use a debugger, but sometimes
&gt; &gt; things inside GUI libraries could be altered if you
&gt; &gt; change the timing. E.g. buffer overflows might not happen
&gt; &gt; if you go step by step - or they might happen when they
&gt; &gt; wouldn't normally.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't have thought that buffer overflows are all that common.  Most bugs 
&gt; IMHO are much simplier.  But you are right, don't use a debugger for debugging 
&gt; stack overflows or memory leaks etc.
&gt;  


That's not what I meant by "buffer overflow".
I'm not talking about char arrays or anything that basic.
What I means is things like packet or message buffer overflows,
where a contraint is put on the number of packets etc. which
can be read into a linked list for processing.
Such high load conditions often go away if you slow down
the program in any way.

The plain old char-array overflow should be history now
if you use C++ or the n-functions such as strncpy.

Personally, I find that 99% of my bugs cause some of
my internal checking code to print out something useful,
because nearly all of my functions have entry and return
sanity checking. 
In this way, any bug is immediately located to the function
in which it occurs.

But as Mao said: 
"Let a thousand flowers bloom. Let a thousand schools contend."
(Of course, he changed his mind the following year and
rounded them all up!)

I don't think it's necessary to limit one's debugging techniques
in accordance with other people's prescriptions - unless you're
being paid to not be creative.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
