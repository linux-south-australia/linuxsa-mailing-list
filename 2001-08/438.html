&gt;Simon,

&gt;The problem is that there are good HTTP packets in among the
&gt;bad HTTP packets, and I don't know which are bad until
&gt;they've already sent their request - which does the harm already.
&gt;Similarly, I wouldn't expect Bigpond to be able or willing to
&gt;put in sophisticated application-level blocking, nor would
&gt;I expect it to work correctly if they did.

Well, we're doing exactly what you say Telstra won't do. It either 
matters to you or it doesn't, I guess.

&gt;It might not be free either.

It is from us :)

&gt;
&gt;If ADSL were more reliable, more functional (plenty of numerical
&gt;IP addresses and no conditions on me having servers etc.),
&gt;and if it had a sensible price cap, then I might spend a lot
&gt;of time converting over. Right now, 33k is realiable and cheap,
&gt;and I've addressed most of the "issues" after 2.5 years of it.
&gt;

Well, IMHO two out of three isn't bad for a start. (the first two out 
of the three above are standard on our offering).

&gt;When ADSL goes beyond the roll-out phase and enters a more stable,
&gt;mature phase, I'll look at it again.

It is. It (mostly) is (respectively).

&gt;  &gt; You have a choice of ISP's. Why on earth keep supporting the large,
&gt;&gt;  boring, unresponsive one that you use now?
&gt;
&gt;Well, they're not at all as bad as people say.
&gt;They are very responsive to me. Having problems at 3 am,
&gt;I've always been able to contact an expert who can fix things
&gt;and look at logs etc.

Personally I prefer not having to have problems happen at 3am in the 
first place. Whatever.

&gt;
&gt;But the real killer issue is cost.
&gt;There's no price cap on anyone's ADSL as far as I know.

Back to the circular argument about you wanting to pay a fixed cost 
for an unlimited resource. Yep.

&gt;That means I can run up A$1000 or much more per day.
&gt;No one likes to sign a blank cheque that can be filled in
&gt;by a script kiddie with an army of DDoS zombies.
&gt;
&gt;Install a budget shaper to my specifications - then
&gt;you'll get my business!
&gt;

Be careful what you wish for. I might just do it :)

Simon
