That's not quite correct.  Take the particular example of OpenBSD:
Should Theo go broke it's highly likely that nobody will pick up (or
perhaps be allowed to pick up) his project, and the world will then be
without a BSD that is "secure by design."  You might not consider that
to have a huge effect; others will see it differently.

Another scenario: You might decide that GermTracker is the right analysis
tool for you, but almost nobody else has heard of it, and very few other
labs use it, and you have no way of finding out where those other labs
are, anyway.  It's in your best interest to financially support the
author because that person is in the position to keep the product going,
and to fix problems, such as incorporating newly discovered gene sequences.

Although free software comes with no requirement to pay, never the less
the principle of enlightened self-interest strongly suggests that you do.
(So do buy original CDs for your favourite distribution.)
