Bear with me while i run through this:

If I had a network which we will call OSA that was filled with PC's
(win9x/NT/2K), Macs (OS 8.6-&gt;X) and unix boxen (Linux, *BSD, Solaris),
and wanted to have a completely portable way of transferring files would
the following work?:
*Files would range in size to those that would fit on a floppy disk and
above.
**Files would need to be used on machines at some point, somewhere that
is not on the same network as the say home, where I can not assume
internet connectivity.

Linux Box with NFS + AppleTalkIP + Samba connected to this network.
The linux box would need to have USB hubs connected to it, and in the
ports on the USB hubs would be the KeyRing sized flash memory devices
for storing files (8MB-&gt;1GB).

What I need to know is if this were the case would linux support the
devices? Would it be possible to mount these keyring storage devices in
such a fasion so that only the owner of said USB disk would be able to
read/write to it, and take it where ever they needed to? Numbers
involved 20-30.
