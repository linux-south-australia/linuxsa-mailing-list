Thanks every one for your help.

I did a netstat -nr and found although I had a gateway
in I had no gateway out.

I then scrapped KPPP and used the linux conf program which
showed that I had 2 temporary DNS settings assigned ( where
from I have no idea) they were completely wrong so I
removed them and started again.

Now miraculously its all working. I'm unsure what did it and
I'm rather unhappy with that. But for the moment I don't need
to know or really want to know how that all works I just need
the Linux tools.

But thanks again everyone for your help

Alan

&gt; Hi Alan,
&gt; I found similar problems with my installation of Mandrake, if you set up a
&gt; network or Webserver when you run the installation.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The solution I found , No guarantee's, was to In kppp select the following
&gt; items/buttons   (Note this is all from KDE not the terminal)
&gt; Start kppp select setup / select the account / edit / DNS page tab
&gt; - check that "disable existing DNS servers during connection" is selected
&gt; I've found this is all that is needed in most setups.
&gt; Occasionally the following is also needed.
&gt; from the same place as the above select the Gateway tab and check that
&gt; "Assign default route to this gateway" is selected.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure why this works but perhaps one of more technically minded can
&gt; let us both know.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I'm using Mandrake 8, I've finally decide to start using

&gt; &gt; I can connect and have a connection open but I can't get

&gt; &gt; WWW can't connect neither can I telnet to any of the
&gt; &gt; machine I need to connect to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm using KPPP and have used the Howto to set it up
&gt; &gt; I'm convinced its Auhenticating as Ozemail isn't kicking
&gt; &gt; me out. I can ping the local and remote connection
&gt; &gt; IPs that KPPP reports to me when its connected. There
&gt; &gt; is no traffic over the line at all (onless I ping the remote
&gt; &gt; connection)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What else can I do to test what the problem is?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Help greatly appreciated.
