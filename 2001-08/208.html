&gt; Personally, if I were buying a computer on the cheap at the moment, I'd
&gt; go:
&gt;
&gt; 17" generic monitor
&gt; Riva TNT Ultra 32mb Video Card, or less if I knew I wasn't going to be
&gt; playing Windows Games on it
&gt; Duron 700 MHZ
&gt; 256MB RAM
&gt; The Cheapest Motherboard tbat will handle the above
&gt; The Cheapest CDROM drive but at least 32x and a burner if I had the
&gt; money (i.e. I'd get a burner if I had the cash left over)
&gt; The Cheaperst keyboard
&gt; The Cheapest mouse
&gt; 20GB hd (best I could get with the money I wanted to spend)
&lt;snip&gt;

I would recommend Micron RAM.  256MB is around $30USD, I guess thats ~$60
Australian.  The biggest hardware problems I've had with computers are
poor components.  If you are making an investement, spend a little extra
so you don't have to replace it later on...

Spending a little more on your motherboard might make your life easier in
the long run too.  For a HD, I would recommend a 7200 RPM Maxtor.  I've
had extremely good luck with mine, moving ~1TB of data a month (online).
rpmfind.net also uses them w/no problems.  19" monitors are becomming
cheaper as well, get the lowest DPI as possible.  .24 is a good baseline
(but it depends on what you are doing with the computer).  If you will be
using this every day, and can afford it, LCD screens are nice, but
expensive.  Flat CRT's are very nice as well, but a little more.  I broke
down and bought a 21" Mitsubishi Diamond Plust 200 (after a fire) and
although I didn't really eat for a month, it was worth it in the long run.

I've done well with 8MB ATI video cards for many of my linux boxes, and
for my servers I usually throw a crappy 4MB in.  I just need to install my
distro, and put SSH on ;)

Another option if you already have a good keyboard, monitor and mouse is
to get a KVM switch.  For about $100 you can get a good one that will
support wheel mouses, remember *lock key settings (caps, num etc) and also
switch via keyboard (eg print screen or some other key combo).  I bought a
4 port dlink thats done well.  If you end up with 3 computers, and think
about the cost of 3 sets of $30 KB and mouse, its pretty cheap.  Of
course, if you aren't keeping your computers all in one room, this doesn't
make much sense.

i kind of ran out of steam here.
