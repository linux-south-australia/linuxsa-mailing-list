I don't mean a webmail client, I mean the php/cgi/whatever code that
runs on apache that gives you a webmail interface that you can then use
from any web browser.

&gt; &gt; need to be able to access POP3 and IMAP mailboxes on another (Solaris)
&gt; &gt; mail server, and ideally, would be able to use it as SMTP host as
&gt; 
&gt; But the mail is being accessed from the Solaris box, isn't it? Why
&gt; deliver mail to one machine (and move it to the Solaris box) when you
&gt; could just deliver it *straight* to the Solaris box?

the solaris box stores the mail, runs sendmail for SMTP, and has a POP3
and an IMAP server. The debian box is the gateway. It  runs postfix. I
want it to run a webmail service so people can  connect from outside,
thruogh it, to their internal mailboxes.

&gt; 
&gt; You could achieve it a number of ways, but it seems a bit of a waste of
&gt; time. Seeing as Solaris is a UNIX, you can install any of the popular,
&gt; secure MTAs such as Postfix or Qmail.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, using the machine as an SMTP host isn't reliant on web mail.
&gt; That's up to some other piece of software, as I'm sure you know.
&gt; 

yes.

&gt; Another interpretation could be that you want the machine running
&gt; webmail to send the mail (rather than relay it to another machine).
&gt; Again, that's either going to require a MTA or a bunch of code in the
&gt; webmail application that opens TCP connection to the appropriate server
&gt; and send the message.

I will use eitehr the postrfix on the debian server or the sendmail on
the solaris server. Haven't dexcided which yet, suppose it matters
little.

&gt; 
&gt; That's going to be unlikely, as most of the webmail applications seem to
&gt; call /usr/bin/sendmail. Postfix has a sendmail-compatible wrapper to
&gt; achieve this, as does Qmail (I think).

mmm

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; well... The other requirement is that it comes as a Debian .deb package
&gt; &gt; and runs on potato (as in Debian 2.2, not as in chips)...
&gt; 
&gt; IMP can be downloaded as a .deb package, but there's a lot of other
&gt; configuration that needs to happen to install it. I doubt that dpkg (or
&gt; whatever the the Debian packaging tool is called). IMP also requires

"I doubt that dpkg (...)." is not the most complete sentence I have seen
on this list...
 
&gt; Horde, an SQL Database and PHPLib, all of which require a bit of
&gt; thinking to make it work.

yeah, I'd rather not bother with SQL -- all I really want is a http to
imap/smtp gateway, with no local storage of mail, no local
authentication info, little local config, and easily apt-getted

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've been looking about, but can't really see anything that indicates
&gt; &gt; one is better than another, so I'm looking for opinions here...
&gt; 
&gt; We run IMP+Horde for 1100 users and it works without a hitch. Postfix is
&gt; used as the MTA.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd give up on installing it from a package, unless you're prepared to
&gt; write a giant script to do all the configuration work for you.
&gt; 
&gt; There was a thread on this a little while ago on FreeBSD-Questions. I
&gt; ended up writing something in Python that cleans out the database
&gt; (Sessions in PHPLib can get left behind and slow things down after a
&gt; while on systems with a large amount of users). <A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/">http://www.plug.cx/</A> has
&gt; it there somewhere...
&gt; 

imp uses the database to store runtime info? yuck.

cross that off my list...
