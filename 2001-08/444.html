&gt; &gt; I don't mean a webmail client, I mean the php/cgi/whatever code that
&gt; &gt; runs on apache that gives you a webmail interface that you can then use
&gt; &gt; from any web browser.
&gt;
&gt; Er, it's usually all the same. I'm yet to see a piece of webmail
&gt; software that says "Here's the underlying code. Go write some HTML for
&gt; the frontend".

I think there has been some miscommunication here.

The "webmail software" that I originally spake of is something like IMP,
Twig or SquirrelMail. It's the php/html/etc guff that uses Apache to talk
http to a browser, and imap/pop/smtp to talk to a mail server (basically,
it's the MUA). Sometimes they have some of the mail server functionality
built in. I want the php/html guff to run on Apache, which is on a debian
server.

&gt; &gt; the solaris box stores the mail, runs sendmail for SMTP, and has a POP3
&gt; &gt; and an IMAP server. The debian box is the gateway. It  runs postfix. I
&gt; &gt; want it to run a webmail service so people can  connect from outside,
&gt; &gt; thruogh it, to their internal mailboxes.
&gt;
&gt; OK. I'm a little puzzled by your choice to run Postfix on the gateway,
&gt; as it could be easily installed on Solaris. Use NAT to do the rest of
&gt; the work.

There are reasons, many of them historical. I could explain them if you
want, but I think that's a whole other pair of pants (to coin a phrase,
whose meaning I am not entirely certain of)

&gt; &gt; I will use eitehr the postrfix on the debian server or the sendmail on
&gt; &gt; the solaris server. Haven't dexcided which yet, suppose it matters
&gt; &gt; little.
&gt;
&gt; Telling it to use SMTP Server x.x.x.x will be a pain. Most mail clients
&gt; that I've looked into use /usr/bin/sendmail to, er, send the mail ;-)

some don't.

&gt; You're right, though. It matters little.

eitehr way, it should be ok.

&gt; &gt; "I doubt that dpkg (...)." is not the most complete sentence I have seen
&gt; &gt; on this list...
&gt;
&gt; Whoops! Got sidetracked when I wrote that sentence :-) I doubt that dpkg
&gt; (or whatever it is called in Debian land) would be capable of doing all
&gt; the various configuration bits to get IMP working.
&gt;
&gt; That said, dpkg may be able to call a script that does the work, but I
&gt; doubt anyone could be bothered doing any such thing.

ideally, I want one that I install, it runs a script, asks me where the
/usr/bin/sendmail or smtp server is, where the imap/pop server is, and then
goes...

&gt; &gt; yeah, I'd rather not bother with SQL -- all I really want is a http to
&gt; &gt; imap/smtp gateway, with no local storage of mail, no local
&gt; &gt; authentication info, little local config, and easily apt-getted
&gt;
&gt; IMAP/POP will handle user authentication in IMP, as it does in most web
&gt; mail clients around. SQL isn't really that bad. MySQL can be easilly
&gt; configured to take up little amounts of resources and
&gt; compiling/installing is a sinch.

it just seems pointless -- I can't see much information that really requires
persistent storage on the MUA side...

&gt; The "local config" for IMP is simply a matter of editing some basic
&gt; variables in a configuration file, then opening "setup.php3" in your
&gt; browser. This automatically generates the "defaults.php3" file from the
&gt; information you provide a nice, shiny web-based interface.

mmm... I'll look into it (though I'm still not happy with having to install
a database)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; imp uses the database to store runtime info? yuck.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; cross that off my list...
&gt;
&gt; With PHP3, there was no in-built session handling. Those who required
&gt; such a feature were forced to use bulky, unfriendly toolkits like
&gt; PHPLib, which can use a database to store session data.

mmm....... true...

&gt;
&gt; I'd not go crossing it off my list immediately, though. Have a look at
&gt; the demo site, <A HREF="http://demo.horde.org/.">http://demo.horde.org/.</A> That'll give you an idea of its
&gt; capabilities.

yep...

&gt; If you want a nice, slick, slim web-based email environment, I'd
&gt; strongly recommend you take a look at SquirrelMail. Installing is a
&gt; simple matter of un-taring and running 'configure'. 'configure' is
&gt; actually a menu-driven configuration system which lets you specify the
&gt; necessary bits and pieces. It's on SourceForge somewhere.

yes, I've heard this is good. unfortunately, it has no apt sources, which is
not prohibitive, but irritating.

&gt; One of the big advantages that SquirrelMail has over IMP is its complete
&gt; lack of bulk. IMP is designed to be a complete mail solution, with all
&gt; the bells and whistles (2.4 has some *cool* features). SquirrelMail is
&gt; also written in PHP4, which has inbuilt session handling features.
&gt;
&gt; The long and the short of it is that SquirrelMail needs only an IMAP
&gt; server and a PHP4-capable webserver. It's easy, fast and reliable.

and an MTA? or does it do its' own?

&gt; I used to use it on <A HREF="http://mail.plug.cx/,">http://mail.plug.cx/,</A> until I saw the light and used
&gt; Mutt over an SSH session when I needed my mail from afar :-)

indeed -- no good for non-techos though...
