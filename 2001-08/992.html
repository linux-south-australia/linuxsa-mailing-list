Sounds very much like hardware to me! (The kernel message and also the
sound -- seen and heard both before)

To recover what you can:
Turn the PC off, get another harddrive, and boot off it.
Mount the bad drive (say, under /mnt/broken) readonly somewhere.
Use tar to try and copy everything off of it, eg
(cd /mnt/broken;tar -clpf - .)|(cd /home/recover/;tar -xpvf -)

Now, go away for a long while it slowly, slowly, tries to recover
stuff.. Linux will retry the bad sectors a few times and then give up and
move onto the next one, and tar will pad those bad sections of files out
with zeros instead of aborting.
If the drive is damaged in bad places, then it may not mount at all - if so,
you'll need to fiddle with alternative backup superblocks, and possibly try
fscking it - note that if the drive is badly damaged, there's an even chance
it'll actually end up worse though.

Once its all done, unplug dodgy drive and return to manufacturer.

By the way, I'm surprised you're still running a 2.4.0-testX kernel -- i
think there were a heap of reiserfs bugs found since then, and reiserfs
wasn't even a default part of the kernel until 2.4.1...

&gt; Normally I keep my machine on all the time, but the last
&gt; week or so I have been turning it off at night (less noise
&gt; for when I sleep).  Yesterday morning I turned it on, waited
&gt; for it to boot as normal, except its attempt to mount local
&gt; filesystems failed in a rather scary manner.  Here are the
&gt; messages I get:
&gt;

&gt; .
&gt; /etc/init.d/rcS: line 12:   60 Segmentation fault    mount -avt nonfs,noproc,nosmbfs
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; At about the time these errors came up, my hard drive made some funny
&gt; noises (usually it is rather quiet).  It sounded sort of like:
&gt;
&gt; sca-sca-sca-sca  short pause  sca-sca-sca-sca
&gt;
&gt; and that was it.
&gt;
&gt; After this error it does continue to try and boot, but has lots of errors
&gt; along the way.  It does get there eventually, but has only the / partition
&gt; and /usr mounted.  Ie, /home, /var, /tmp and /usr/local are not mounted.
&gt;
&gt; So, I want to know --- is this a problem with my hard drive?  Or is it
&gt; a software problem?
&gt;
&gt; The drive itself is only about a year old.  It is an IBM 15Gig ATA100
&gt; 7200rpm drive.  I had been lead to believe that the IBMs were very
&gt; reliable so I will be rather surprised if it is indeed a drive hardware
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; I am runing LVM 0.8final and reiserfs under a 2.4.0-test9 kernel (I
&gt; think anyway).
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas about what I should do now?  I have backups of some of my
&gt; important stuff on the drive, but there is stuff on the /home partition
&gt; that I'd prefer not to lose if I can avoid it.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Mark.
