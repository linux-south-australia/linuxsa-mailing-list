One of the themes in "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance" is that the "professionals" are just as
capable of pulling the same sorts of stunts.  Pirsig
goes on to say that Quality resides in the individual,
not the title (at least that's what I hope he was
saying ...).

&gt; Or the people who (not like anyone here :-) like to
&gt; muck around with Windows, because it was fun, & then
&gt; have to pay me to fix it for them!

I like knowing what goes on under the hood, so that
when things break, I can fix them.  I just found
this so much harder with Windows, which seemed to
go out of its way to hide these errors from end
users (eg, when dialing into a RAS link, pppd
says (paraphrased) terminated due to carrier loss,
yet RAS's EventLog says "user requested disconnect",
when it did no such thing.  Hurumph).
