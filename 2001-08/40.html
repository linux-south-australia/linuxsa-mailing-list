.avi can contain all sorts of compression, not just WMV4 (also known as the
"DivX ;-)" codec)

Although .avi is a roughly standard format, it is just a wrapper around
frames of data to be passed to codecs.. And although some of these codecs
have been ported to opensource, many haven't.
Generally, don't use .avi, use .mpg (MPEG1, MPEG2 or MPEG4)

mpeg1 is probably preferable, since it is widely used, doesn't need
excessive power to playback, etc.
mpeg2 has a few extra features, such as variable bitrate, but it is
generally only used for high-bitrate things, such as cable tv or dvd.
mpeg3 was skipped.. it was going to be used for cable tv etc but mpeg2
turned out good enuf anyway.
mpeg4 offers better compression, variable bitrate etc., but at a cost of
significantly higher processing power requirements.

MPEGs are an open standard, so anyone can make a decoder, without fear of
being sued by microsoft. (unlike .asf - see virtualdub's website)

Microsoft used mpeg4 for the basis of their wmv4 codec for .asf, but changed
it enuf to be incompatible. It was then hacked into an .avi codec, and was
released as the "DivX ;-)" codec. microsoft seem happy to let this happen.

&gt; &gt; p.s. sorry if you can't play a '.MOV' file under linux - oops.

&gt; &gt; I'll see if I can get another format arranged. Currently I have the
&gt; &gt; choice of an even more windows specific file at twice the size that I
&gt; &gt; can't open for nuts, or a 380 megabyte source AVI file which plays
&gt; &gt; wonderfully, if you don't mind waiting for the download :)
&gt;
&gt; Compressed AVIs (plus a bit more, see <A HREF="http://www.projectmayo.com">http://www.projectmayo.com</A> for a lot
&gt; of stuff I don't understand) are called DivX. Linux players are available
&gt; at <A HREF="http://www.divx-digest.com/software/linux_divx.html.">http://www.divx-digest.com/software/linux_divx.html.</A> The DivX format
&gt; should be ideal for this. There are players for most platforms.
