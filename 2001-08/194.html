There's a new variation out there.

I'm seeing &gt; 35,000 attempted 'hits' per hour, coming from various 
compromised servers inside our customer base, trying to hit hosts on 
the Internet at large. That's symptomatic of what's happening all 
over the planet right now. That's from a relatively low number of 
compromised hosts - each one works quite hard to spread the thing.

I have a partial block in place already stopping most of these 
outbound attacks, and we'll be contacting our customers (again) 
tomorrow about this to get the compromised ones to actually care, but 
that block won't stop further 'inbound' attacks (though I hope we can 
start to do that when we commission a new bit of magic hardware next 
week). Again this is symptomatic of what ISP's will be doing across 
the world right now - trying to do what they can to inform their own 
customers to give a darn.

The new one has a minor variation on the old one's attack signature, 
but the real issue is that the underlying code does a -lot- more 
(look out for the folks at eeye.com to generate an analysis of it 
very soon).

On -this- list I'm not expecting anyone to need to patch their 
Micro$oft web servers, but if you know people who choose to run them, 
this is a great time to do them a favour and tell them that failure 
to security patch their server will almost certainly cause them major 
angst very very soon now (if not already).

Cheers,
Simon
