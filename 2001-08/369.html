 &gt; &gt; Let's propose that that IIS server gets infested by a CodeRed worm

 &gt; &gt; of the entire Internet that shares the first 16 bits of its IP address,
 &gt; &gt; which is 192.168.x.y.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Mark, are you sure about this? That makes the 192.168.x.x 'private',
 &gt; non-routable schema very broken. For instance, how would I route a packet
 &gt; on port 80 over the internet to 'your' 192.168.1.1 web server rather than
 &gt; Alan's or whoever?
 
Perhaps I wasn't clear enough.

NAT gateway.  One external IP address, 203.1.2.3.  DNS says
www.broken.com.au IN A 203.1.2.3, so anyone who tries to look
at www.broken.com.au is vectored to port 80 on that IP address.

NAT gateway has a static mapping:  203.1.2.3:80 -&gt; 192.168.1.2:80.
192.168.1.2 is an IIS server, so everyone in the world who visits
www.broken.com.au gets content served from that IIS server.

There are other IIS servers which the rest of the world can't see
at all in 192.168.0.0/16 behind the same NAT gateway.  Everyone at 
Broken Pty Ltd (broken.com.au) has an NT system on their desk, and
they're running IIS because they don't know any better.  Out of the
box configuration 'n' all that.  

So when the worm probes www.broken.com.au, which is the same as
203.1.2.3, which is the same as 192.168.1.2, the externally-visible
IIS server is compromised.  That server starts sprouting CodeRed
probes to all and sundry.

CodeRed v2 (and the v3 variant which seems to have appeared today:
look for AAAAA's in the payload instead of NNNN's or XXXXXX's) focuses
most of its efforts on the 16-bit network which hosts the compromised
IIS server, which, in this case, is 192.168.1.2.  So 80% of the probes
coming out of that IIS server are for random 192.168 addresses, i.e.,
they never get back out through the NAT gateway again, they're totally
internal to Broken Pty Ltd's network.

So, at random, the IIS servers on everyone's desktops at Broken Pty Ltd
will succomb to the worm.  They'll also spend 80% of their time scanning
192.168.0.0/16, so the problem will accellerate.  Pretty soon all of the
IIS servers at Broken Pty Ltd will be, well, broken.

So they're all spending 80% of their time on 192.168.0.0/16.  What 
are they doing for the other 20% of the time?  They're hitting on 
other random IP addresses.  So they're making TCP connections out 
everywhere.

All of these IIS servers have a default route pointing at the NAT 
gateway, and when it sees a HTTP request for, say, 24.9.8.7, it'll
create a NAT mapping for it so that the 192.168.0.0/16 machine which
is making the request can send it to the world at large.  So 
24.9.8.7 will get a probe, but its logs will show that the probe is
really coming from 203.1.2.3 (the external IP address on the NAT 
gateway).

So if Broken Pty Ltd has 100 workstations running IIS behind their
NAT-based firewall, that single externally-routable IP address will
end up creating 100 times the normal number of probes for a single
instance of CodeRed, because it'll be "hiding" 100 CodeRed instances.

We've seen a couple like this now.  Some of them burst at several
megabits for a few minutes then stop for a minute or two.  We're
surmising that the stoppages are due to the NAT gateway crashing
(because NAT gateways have an upper bound on the number of simultaneous
translations they can handle) and rebooting.  Whatever.

Does that clarify?

 &gt; Nope, I don't think so. Certainly, webservers in your own 192.168.x.x
 &gt; network are attackable by Code red on an internal or gateway webserver,
 &gt; but not to other private networks.

They are if the CodeRed worm makes it inside the NAT world, via a 
static mapping which points to an IIS server.
