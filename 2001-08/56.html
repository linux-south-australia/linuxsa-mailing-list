I use Netscape Messenger mounting its mail directory over a local, one
node only NFS/Ethernet network.

Specifics:

NFS Server
----------

650 MHZ, 292 MB Athlon running Linux 2.4.3-SGI-XFS Kernel.

Apart from the kernel and a few minor supporting features for that
kernel it's a stock standard RedHat Install.

NFS Client - Redhat
-------------------

450MHZ, 128MB AMD-K6-III with 128MB memory running Linux 2.4.3-SGI-XFS
Kernel.

NFS Client - BSD
----------------

Standard 4.3-Generic Release on the same machine as above.

I tend to get tonnes of e-mail which I fetch using fetcmail onto my main
machine and then collect using Netscape. Whilst this is horribly
inefficient (I send it via POP to the Client and store it via NFS to the
server) I've got too much invested in Netscape Messenger style mail to
make an easy move viable.

What this amounts to is that I have times of great congestion where the
"downloading messages" (from the local pop server on the server) which
gives me an opportunity to watch how fast the messages get downloaded.


The difference between RedHat and FreeBSD is quite noticeable, to being
quite annoying.

Objectively, Netscape 4.77 on Linux and Netscape 4.76 on FreeBSD seem to
download web pages just as quickly as each other. The tool used to write
messages appears to be as fast.

Nonetheless the rate that messages come from my server to the client and
back to the server again is noticeable.

I have some suppositions:

1) NFS on FreeBSD Sucks or NFS on Linux 2.4.3-XFS Sucks or BOTH

But two similar operating systems share the same quirks and therefore
have less hassle speaking to each other

2) XFS is faster than FreeBSD's UFS

And Netscape, for reasons not known (maybe to filter), stores all
messages temporarily before storing it in the netscape mail folder. This
sounds stupid to me and my client's hard drive doesn't appear to thrash
during these operations (did I mention that both OS'es are on the same
hard drive?)

3) XFree86 4.0.3/Linux render faster than FreeBSD 3.3.6

And the bottle neck is the GUI. This is a possibility but for web
browsing, using the GIMP over a remote X session neither OS seems
superior to the other. There is a difference when running a client
client on the client x server but that's another story (I think).

4) Netscape 4.77 on Linux is faster than Netscape 4.76 on FreeBSD

This is a possibility...I'm not sure.

I would tend to point my finger at either the NFS services or X....

[bugger knows what the purpose of this e-mail is. i'm thinking out
aloud]
