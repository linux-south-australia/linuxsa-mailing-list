&gt; Star Trek: LinuxSA.

But you've lost the context. Let me provide a little.

Starship LinuxSA is simply a contraption in which figures, lonely  or
otherwise, can catch up on some messages with the help of the ship's
computer. Continuing on our Star Trek theme, figures connect to the
machine using a virtual body beamed in from their own Starships.
However, the computer only acts as a resender of messages, questions and
replies (a database even), replies which it receives from the Captains
of other Star Ships willing to listen.

Let me make some remarks about these particular Star Ships and their
captains.

USS NETCRAFT
Admiral Bennett
General Garner
The Mysterious Guy Wearing the Internode/Agile T-Shirt

The USS NETCRAFT actually own and operate the Starship LinuxSA. The USS
NETCRAFT has the most impressive arsenal within the whole fleet, yet
they've only blasted on Starship out of LinuxSA in this author's time.

They are like the modern day Christian God they stand aloof and silent,
generally only interceding with information needed rather than directing
how Starship LinuxSA should be run. Interestingly, the mysterious one -
perhaps a Latter Day Saint - did intercede once and definitively stated
that an HTML message blocker would not be sent.

USS NEWALL
General Newall

The USS NEWALL is an older model, Starship which could be compared to a
Sherman tank. Underneath its logo is "RTFM" and if it were Marvin the
Robot its complaint would be "The man pages aren't what the used to
be...I am so depressed". General Newall is known for firing salvos at
people who fail to read his logo before sending a message, however
General Newall tends to be quite knowledgeable and is willing to share
that knowledge:

a) if you have RTFM'ed
b) at least tried to help yourself

Rumour has it that General Newall will sneak into Starship LinuxSA with
the intent of sending a message that will invoke a space war. Further
rumour has it that the USS LLOYD and USS NEWALL sometimes fire phony
torpedoes at each other that look real but don't really do any damage.

USS LLOYD
lloy0076

The USS LLOYD is a spritely, new Starship with automatic message
generators and many staff to create messages. The USS LLOYD is seemingly
well armed and probably obtains ammunition from a Starship as powerful
as the USS NETCRAFT. Some say that there is a contraband movement from
other galazies to supply these weapons.

Nonetheless, the USS LLOYD is quite capable of answering messages,
however if you receive an answer be ready for a few photon laser shots
at the same time. Avoid photon laser shots by not sending HTML e-mail.
Avoid photon laser shots by agreeing with what the USS LLOYD's captain
thinks.

Oh, did I mention - whatever you do, don't take this particular Starship
on in a single space war. Whilst some argue its ammunition is cheap,
unreliable and ineffective there's lots of it.

USS RUSSELL
Captain RR

Captain RR is consistently seen attempting to disarm Starships in space
wars whilst answering questions within his knowledge emanating from
Starship LinuxSA. Captain RR is the inaugrator of the "Great Ship
Refitment for Free" [i.e. Installfest] of last year. One should be aware
that, seemingly harmless as the USS RUSSELL is, it has a stock of "TWONK
MISSILES".

These missiles have only been seen publicly once on another related list
and were originally meant to be a covert means of destruction (it is
rumoured that the USS LLOYD had fired off a particularly fowl smeeling
substance at what are known as WEB MONKEYS and that the USS RUSSELL was
coming in for their rescue; needless to say the USS LLOYD survived).

USS KENNINGTON
Big Old Al

The USS KENNINGTON is under constant attack and radio scans. However,
the USS KENNINGTON's defence appears to be to talk so much that the
radio scans simply have no bandwidth to even get close to the ship. It
would appear, though, that the USS KENNINGTON is running some kind of
secret software designed to listen to and log all of these attacks and
radio scans.

However, the only way to determine that for sure is to launch a scan
one's self and we all saw what happened to the last offender...

USS REID
Captain Andrew

The USS REID tends to avoid space wars and seems to have a penchant for
"space treaties". Nonetheless, Captain Reid doesn't appeat to have
convinced USS NETCRAFT to become a member of any space treaty so things
are just where they started from.

USS MANNING
Captin Robyn (not in tight pants)

The USS MANNING should be a fast, resilient Starship and it would be if
it weren't running the latest updates of everything. Nonetheless, the
USS MANNING avoids space wars by quickly ducking around them and it is
rumoured that the USS MANNING has also taught other Starships how to use
this thing called Linux.


And finally, the creater of this thread:

USS SIERKE
Captain W.S.

An avid Star Trek fan, Captain W.S. sometimes uses sarcasm and wit to
put a Startrek edge into some things in his life. Captain W.S. believes
that all elitists should be eliminated and that the USS NEWALL's motto
"RTFM" and its corollary "HELP YOURSELF" can be taken too far.

Whilst this author has not seen any particular torpedos, phasers or
other items of weaponry, the author is yet to determine whether
"Comeuppance" is simply a message or really an insipid virus intended to
perform a DOS by wasting heaps of time.


Oh, before we finish on our Universe:

&gt; Divert hostile messages to /dev/nul.

Black holes do not exist.

DSL

[ps:

This is satire by the way...it's a caricature of how one particular
person, the author, sees the universe as it stands
