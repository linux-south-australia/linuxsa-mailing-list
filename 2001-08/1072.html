Don't forget CRAMFS (part of the Linux kernel, if you've enabled it)
and ROMFS.. There would be a few advantages for either. ROMFS uses less
kernel memory for the driver, but CRAMFS compresses more.

Then, use TMPFS instead of a ramdisk, since it only uses memory as it
requires it.. leaving the rest for your programs.

So, mount the RO flash on /, and mount tmpfs partitions on /tmp, /home,
/var...

This saves you the need to waste memory by untarring the flash into ramdisk.

&gt; &gt; However, I have to give the board back soon, and I want to continue
&gt; &gt; doing this sort of stuff, and write it up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a reseller that is selling small boards?
&gt;
&gt; I found these people today. They apparently have a place around the Unley
&gt; area:
&gt;
&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.mayerkrieg.com.au/embed_comp/default.htm">http://www.mayerkrieg.com.au/embed_comp/default.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; Not sure what their prices are like, but they sure have some funky
&gt; hardware. :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There is another interesting board out there, which is the Axis embedded
&gt; &gt; developer board: <A HREF="http://developer.axis.com/hardware/devboard/.">http://developer.axis.com/hardware/devboard/.</A> It has a
&gt; &gt; RISC processor, an ethernet port, 2MB of flash and 8MB DRAM.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The 2MB flash makes it a bit limiting, though, since you could not get
&gt; &gt; enough of a file system on it.
&gt;
&gt; I guess it would depend on what you needed and how you went about it. I
&gt; think that the RAM would be the biggest limiting factor. If you had twice
&gt; as much RAM, the hardware could be used for a great deal of things. You
&gt; could have the custom kernel and tarballs of the root file system in flash
&gt; (tar has less space overhead than most filesystems) and mount a 4MB
&gt; ramdisk as the root FS. I believe that this is how the Linux Router
&gt; project and other little-bitty floppy distributions work with 1.44, 1.6
&gt; and 1.7 MB floppy disks.
&gt;
&gt; Hope it helps,
&gt; Matt
