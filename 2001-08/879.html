&gt; &gt; I gave Debian a go and found it a frustrating experience. As far as

&gt; 
&gt; Whats problems do you run into with compiling and installing source
&gt; code locally?

Mainly my lack of patience - I was upgrading my system to be able to
compile the latest Gnome sources, so when I found out that Debian was
still back at 1.2, that was annoying.

I tried switching to Woody but that resulted in 150MB over the modem. So
I moved over to Mandrake 8.0 which is still annoying but at least has up
to date stuff. 128MB isn't enough with Gnome and KDE packages running at
the same time though. Fire up Mozilla, Nautilus and Evolution and it's
swapping already. I've tried KMail, Mozilla and Evolution as mail
clients and will be switching back to Pine. Sigh.

The difficulty (which still exists on Mandrake and any other system
which has packages) is when I want to upgrade some software that other
packages depend on. If I remove the old version, the other packages
complain. If I just install over the top, then it works but I have no
idea what subtle mismatches there are between actuality and the
database. I can set nodeps to avoid checks, but then I keep getting
warnings. I didn't try putting in a dummy package as I'd gone to
Mandrake by that stage.

The other difficulty is that some packages can be compiled with or
without support for other programs... if I then install those other
programs, the initial package doesn't make use of them until it's
recompiled anyway. A 'make world' would do a proper probe of what's on
the system and adjust itself accordingly.

In my bloated opinion, the design of packaging systems is flawed in the
first place - keeping databases of file structures creates a redundant
filesystem which then has to be maintained in parallel with the live
filesystem. It would be better to look at what's actually there and make
install/don't decisions on that basis (like "make world" would).
