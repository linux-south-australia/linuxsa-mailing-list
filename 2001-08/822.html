&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can anyone tell me when Linux first started supporting SMP?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am being told that Win2K is the first Operating System to support
&gt; &gt; SMP, to
&gt; &gt; which I thought was crap. As far as I can remember it was supported
&gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; I was first installing Mandrake 6.0, is that true?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am also convinced that the "inovative" new Windows Terminal Services
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; Win2K is a rip off of VNC, any one know any more about this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Jay,
&gt;
&gt; No the Terminal Server stuff in Win2k is a blatant rip of Citrix

This is not correct as Citrix licence the Multi user software they developed
in the NT3.51 day back to M$ which they now sell as Terminal server and
pretent it is there creation. Citrix has risen from somewhat obsure company
to a very large concern in a few short years by going along for the M$ ride.

&gt; Winframe. I believe (but don't know as fact) that part of the License
&gt; agreement Citrix took with Microsoft when they developed Winframe, meant
&gt; Microsoft got the Citrix technology. This was back in the days of WinNT
&gt; 3.51, the next release of WinFrame was still using the 3.51 interface
&gt; because Microsoft brought out WinNT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, which
&gt; was basically WinFrame with the new NT 4.0 interface. Of course, I might
&gt; be completely wrong, it was some years ago...
&gt;
&gt; As for SMP, unless anyone can definitevly remember, it might pay to
&gt; troll through kernel.org to find the first SMP kernel.
&gt; I do know however, that many OS's, even in the Intel sector were
&gt; supporting SMP way before Windows of any variety (Netware springs to
&gt; mind, but there were others).
