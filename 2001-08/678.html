As I seem to remember and by what is on my motherboard this
is being most likely identified correctly. (I think)
I have a CT or Creative Technologies 5880 onboard my motherboard
this is also known as a Sound Blaster PCI128 or in some cases a Vibra128
teh 5880 chipset was originally an Ensoniq chipset (I think) I don't know
how to fix your problems but I think its probably being identified properly
though. You may want to check the specs of the card on creatives website,
and have a look at their freesource area, I can't remember the URL, there
should be something or someone you can ask there.

Regards,

Michael

Subject: vibra128 sound/midi & manduck 8


&gt; Hi list,
&gt;
&gt; I have just installed a new creative vibra 128 sound card in my manduck
8.0
&gt; box to replace an older soundblaster card. Manduck's hardware config tool
&gt; sees this as an ensoniq 5880 card (as does rathead's sndconfig), and sound
&gt; pours forth. Midi unfortunately is less fruitful. Timidity works (of
course),
&gt; kmidi sequencer works (hmm) kmid midi player doesn't (ERROR: Couldn't open
&gt; /dev/sequencer to get some information) and progs under wine that try to
&gt; access the midi sequencer direct don't work either (unable to open midi
&gt; device)
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone got direct experience here that will help?
&gt;
&gt; Is the config tool right in setting this up as an ensoniq 5880?
&gt;
&gt; Could I expect to be able to drive midi directly through this card?
&gt;
&gt; Any clues for the clueless here????
&gt;
&gt; Ta
&gt;
&gt; Bruce
