&gt; | The Microsoft keyboards that I've used have either been oddly shaped
&gt; | and/or uncomfortable. The Microsoft logo that glares up at you is
also
&gt; | quite disconcerting.
&gt;
&gt; I have one of those wierd looking and initially uncomfortable
Microsoft Natural
&gt; Elite boards.  (The Elite keyboards are different than the standard
Pro.. mainly
&gt; in the respect of the arrow keys are _normal_ and not in a wierd
diamond-like
&gt; arrangement, which is horrible for gaming, and it has USB [which is
great for
&gt; games like quake.. seems more responsive or something.])
&gt;
&gt; At first, they're horrible.. you're swearing, yelling, wanting to
throw it at
&gt; the cat.. but after a while you swear by em :)  I've been known to
type &gt;120WPM
&gt; on these keyboards (on a good day).  My normal typing speed is around
the 70
&gt; mark.
&gt;
&gt; Cant say much for the Internet Keyboards though.. gimme a logitech
anyday :-)
&gt;
&gt; Nothing like those old IBM keyboards though.. they had this feel to
them..
&gt; bloddy great to type on.

I use Keytronic (formerly Honeywell) keyboards, since they're good
quality, and relatively inexpensive (about 50 $ for a SpaceMate model),
but if you want a _real_ keyboard (no Windows keys, no numpad), have a
look at the Happy Hacking Keyboard
<A HREF="http://www.pfuca.com/products/hhkb/hhkbindex.html.">http://www.pfuca.com/products/hhkb/hhkbindex.html.</A>  You can get one from
everythinglinux.com.au or ridge.com.au, but be warned that they're not
cheap.
