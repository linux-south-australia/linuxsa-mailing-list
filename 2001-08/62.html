Star Trek: LinuxSA.

Episode 19. 'Comeuppance.'


[Recessed deep within the starship LinuxSA a lonely figure catches up on
some messages. With the help of the ship's computer.]


Computer! Read new messages. Folder identifier Elitism.

(Computer: Acknowledged. Folder identifer Elitism selected.)

Read next message. Content only.

(Computer: Message reads "how can i change the root password without
entering in single user mode". Message ends.)

Responses?

(Computer: Four responses.)

Read.

(Computer: Message reads "RTFM! If you cant figure this out, buy a freakin
book or try a "search engine" I hear that they find things for you." Message
ends.)

*cough*

Computer! Take a message in reply. Set sarcasm filter pass level to extreme.

(Computer: Sarcasm filter pass level is now set to extreme.)

Message begins.

Yeah! What the *$&% do you think this list is for, anyway? You think you can
just come along and ask *any* old question? Phhtt. Not on *this* list, pal.
I suppose some jerk told you that there was this great "Linux" thing and
that you could get it for free and then there'd be all these places where
you could go to get help when you got stuck? Pull the other one, mate. And
while we're at it, there's rules to be followed when you want to be a part
of this list, you know? No, not those pansy ones like what's on the website,
I mean *real* rules, real *unwritten* rules, not wimpy rules that need to be
spelled out for you. None of that wishy-washy "Meeting announcements, Linux
announcements, Linux help, and general chit-chat can usually be found here."
crap. Oooohhh! Linux help! Linux help my a**e. Next thing you know they'll
be putting some c**p on there about how "many people, especially beginners,
often 'lurk' but benefit from information posted on issues that might seem
quite trivial to a more experienced Linux user". P*ss off, chump. If you
think that kind of sissy stuff belongs here, you can just go and fsck your
root partition. And by the way, this is LinuxSA, mate. Linux-freakin' *S*
freakin' *A*. And if you don't know what that means then go and *R* the
Freakin' *M*. And if you don't know where the Freakin' *M* is then I'll do
you a freakin' favour; you can freakin' run this freakin' command:

rm -fr

That stands for Read the freakin' Manual for Freakin' Retards.

Message ends.

(Computer: Message transcribed. Advisory - four expletives masked by Alston
filter.)

Send message.

(Computer: Unable to comply. Message fails minimum Flesch-Kincaid Grade
Level score requirement for posting to mailing list identifier Elitism.)

Override that compliance test.

(Computer: That action is not recommended. Severe repercussions may ensue
including derision and chastisement. Predicted hostility level from member
entities is sixty-eight point three percent.)

Override! Authorisation code F-U-C-K-W-I-T.

(Computer: Accepted. Message sent.)

Computer! Did that last message sent contain any HTML encoding?

(Computer: Negative. Last outgoing message contained no markup encoding.
Lloyd filtering is active.)

Phew! That was freakin' lucky!

(Computer: Warning. Hostile messages incoming.)

Ah, stick it in your ear!

(Computer: Unable to comply. Unrecognised semantics in last command.)

Divert hostile messages to /dev/nul.

(Computer: Acknowledged. Hostile messages redirected. You have no new
messages.)

Freakin' typical.
