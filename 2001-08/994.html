I was afraid it might be. :-( :-(

&gt; To recover what you can:
&gt; Turn the PC off, get another harddrive, and boot off it.
&gt; Mount the bad drive (say, under /mnt/broken) readonly somewhere.
&gt; Use tar to try and copy everything off of it, eg
&gt; (cd /mnt/broken;tar -clpf - .)|(cd /home/recover/;tar -xpvf -)

Sounds like a good plan, except that the death occured in the
process of trying to mount.  Reiserfs was trying to do the mounting
when it died.  I don't suppose there is some way of getting reiserfs
to do a short-cut mount or something?

&gt; By the way, I'm surprised you're still running a 2.4.0-testX kernel -- i
&gt; think there were a heap of reiserfs bugs found since then, and reiserfs
&gt; wasn't even a default part of the kernel until 2.4.1...

It wasn't a default part of the kernel, but there was a kernel patch
which worked --- and people told me it was pretty stable.

My plan was to upgrade from a test kernel once the official version
came out, except that I heard there were issues with using the newer
kernel with the reiserfs I was using, so I have put off the upgrade 
(especially as --- up till now --- everything had been working
perfectly).

Thanks,

Mark.
