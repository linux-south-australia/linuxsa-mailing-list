 &gt; In fact, thinking about this more, this seems to indicate that

The first CodeRed worm was deterministic:  It worked out its list
of IP addresses from a pseudo-random number generator, and a bug 
in the worm meant all the worms always seeded their PRG with the 
same value.

I'm very glad I don't live on a network near the start of the resulting
address range.  But that possibly explains why my home network hasn't
yet received a single probe from CodeRed v1.0.

 &gt; Bigpond is going to make a big packet out of Code Red.
 &gt; In fact, the Code Red thing should help the ISP industry
 &gt; generally.

You think so?  Consider that most of the IP addresses which CodeRed
tries will be unutilized -- For every SYN packet we send to a customer
we're probably receiving four packets which we're just dropping on 
the floor.

So yes, ISP revenues will probably increase as a result of this, but
their costs are going to skyrocket as well.  And the cost of our 
operations is going up, because of the extra effort involved in 
identifying infested customers and hand-holding them through the
recovery process.

This worm isn't going to be winning any friends from anywhere.

 &gt; And just one last point, this scenario is exactly what
 &gt; my concept of "budget shaper" is all about.
 &gt; If every subscriber had a budget shaper, it would
 &gt; automatically but back bandwidth and set off alarms when
 &gt; the bank balance is being threatened by unforeseen circumstances.
 
... thereby replacing an increase in running costs with a total 
denial of service.  Hmm. :-)  We'd see a whole generation of worms
designed purely to shut-down huge areas of the Internet by generating
floods of packets which exhibit the right kind of randomness.  
People would very soon associate budget shapers with disfunctional
Internet links, because all the people with budget shapers would be 
off the air altogether while the people without them would just have
performance issues and bigger bills.

Anyway, I can equally say that "If every subscriber had patched IIS
we wouldn't have this stupid problem in the first place."  I think 
that's a lot more likely than every subscriber buying a budget shaper,
and it still exists in the realms of vanishingly small probabilities
:-(
