John,

It might be worse than that.
After thinking a bit longer, I think that it is not possible
to reduce byte load on a link through detection of the GET command.

Here is a typical sequence:

Let C = code-red-infected host.
Let V = victim host with open port 80.

C -&gt; V	SYN
V -&gt; C	SYN/ACK
C -&gt; V	ACK
C -&gt; V	1500 bytes data	(segment 1)
V -&gt; C	ACK
C -&gt; V	1500 bytes data (segment 2)
V -&gt; C	ACK
C -&gt; V	938 bytes data (push) (segment 3)
V -&gt; C	ACK
V -&gt; C	1500 bytes data
V -&gt; C 	90 bytes (push)
V -&gt; C	FIN/ACK
C -&gt; V	ACK
C -&gt; V	RST
C -&gt; V	RST

This is from a particular packet trace.

The first packet which indicates that this is a bad host is
the 4th packet.
Suppose the host IP C is blocked after this packet.
Then you have two cases - either you block output to C also
or you don't.

If you block both directions, then C will continue to send the rest.
From past experience, it might look like this:

C -&gt; V	1500 bytes	segment 2
C -&gt; V	938 bytes	segment 3
[waiting....]
C -&gt; V	1500 bytes  	segment 1
{waiting....]
C -&gt; V	1500 bytes	segment 1

this typically goes on for a couple of minutes, with the
retransmission time doubling on each transmission.
(Linux does that anyway.)

The result is clearly that I get more bytes of packets than I would
if I hadn't blocked it.

If I don't block output packets from host V, then host V will send
ACKs for a while, and I think that C will also respond to these ACKs.
I've seen this happen many times when I've blocked bad hosts
on INPUT but not on OUTPUT.

=======================================
Conclusion:
The profit in this sort of thing only comes when the same
host C comes back.
But Code Red I never used to return.
Code Red II probes the same subnet, and even the same host,
often.
So the best strategy would be to add the host C to the list of
blocked hosts _after_ it has finished probing one host.
Then you won't get any more data bytes from it - just SYN packets.

There are other problems of collateral damage:
-	Suppose you get CR probes from host C which is
	a proxy for 1000 employees.
	Then you block all of them from your website!
-	Suppose host C gets fixed.
	Then you're still blocking that site to
	genuine access after it's fixed.

=======================================
So.... 
What exactly does the Cisco algorithm do?
I imagine it just does a simple block as above
on INPUT only, without building up a list of
bad hosts.
If so, then it is bad on the incoming link to the Cisco router,
but good on the downstream.
And it would protect IIS servers which have not been patched.

It's not clear what it does.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
