&gt; &gt; It sounds like the problem is incurring in your sysadmin, not the software.

&gt; &gt; What is his problem with allowing non-priveledged ports (ie 1024 and up) to
&gt; &gt; pass thru the firewall?
&gt;
&gt; Probably he wants to restrict traffic to just what he wants...

But blocking some but not all ports isn't going to acheive that.. As we both
know, and you mention below, once you have a single port open, you can
transfer whatever you like over it. Unless you use a stateful proxy server
of some form, you're not really solving anything.

The case where it IS valid is when you want to protect a box that you
control; ie. you know exactly what is running on that port, and you want to
allow connections to it and nothing else..

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; TCP uses two connections, always. One for control, one for data. Passive or
&gt; &gt; Active just determines who initiates the connection for the data.
&gt;
&gt; TCP=FTP, I presume...

Ah, yes.. sorry..


&gt; This is where packet filtering will always fail -- if you leave
&gt; one single thing open, and there is someone who has access to
&gt; both sides of hte firewall, they can tunnel any IP (or even
&gt; non-IP) traffic through that link. Basically, if you have a
&gt; dertermined person on the inside, packet filtering won't do
&gt; anything but hinder them and give you a false sense of security.
&gt; It really becomes a management problem then... Though host
&gt; security will help (but you have to be pretty thorough -- if
&gt; someone can just plug their laptop ethernet into a port, that
&gt; won't help either... even if you can stop that, a really
&gt; determined person could tunnel ssh optically, encoding bits as
&gt; colour changes on a monitor... you can never counter a
&gt; determined insider with technology alone...)

Information wants to be free ;)
