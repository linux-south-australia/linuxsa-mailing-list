&gt; Isn't FAT12 whats used on DOS formatted floppy disks??

FAT volumes use a cluster (of blocks) as the minimum allocation unit.
Each cluster is numbered.  FAT12 uses 12 bits for that number; FAT16
uses 16 bits; and if you haven't already worked out how many FAT32
uses then please leave the classroom.  The size of the cluster is a
space/performance tradeoff: If you have 4K clusters then those hundreds of
1 byte files are going to fill your disk much sooner than you would like.
On the other hand, if your disk is full of large MPEGs, you probably
gain some performance by reading them in 16KBytes at a time.

DOS appears to select the size of the cluster based on the number of
blocks on the device.  If the disk is smaller than 2MBytes there is
no reason reason to use anything other than FAT12.  Disks between 2M
and 32MBytes can uniquely identify each sector using FAT16, but would
require larger cluster sizes if you use FAT12.  Those who are still paying
attention will realise that the 32MByte disk needs 16KByte clusters for
a FAT12 filesystem.  Actually, I don't know how large a cluster can be.
It's entirely possible that the cluster size is expressed using 4 bits,
and if that were so then a FAT12 filesystem could never be larger than
16MBytes.  (I'm not suggesting this is the case, just explaining the
principle.)

So yes, a 1.44MB floppy disk would be formatted with FAT12.  I suspect
a 2.88MB floppy disk (has anybody ever seen one of those?) would format
with FAT16.
