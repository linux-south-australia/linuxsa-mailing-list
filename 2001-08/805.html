Hi Allan,

I think the Register is on the right track. PC's for Kids needs to 
realise that Linux is not a second-best alternative. If they take a 
look at the K-12 Linux project they can see that there is a wealth of 
stuff available and they are using it down as low as kindergarten age 
so it is not difficult to teach.

The comment on Mike's Page intrigues me. Is such a license available 
down under?
"In the United Kingdom, and possibly in other countries, computer-
recycling charities can obtain a refurbishment licence from Microsoft 
for approximately $US500 per year.

This is like a corporate or site licence, where a flat fee allows the 
licence holder to load as many copies as required. The refurbishment 
licence differs in that it only licences obsolete, unwanted, 
unobtainable, and unsupported software, and it only applies to 
computers that are given away. PCs for Kids were prepared to pay $A1000 
per year for a refurbishment licence but Microsoft refused to agree.
"

I think this is just mischeif making and muddies the waters. All the MS-
haters will jump on it and make it important.

While this comment at the bottom of the following page, 
<A HREF="http://michaelmoore.com/missions/gates2/index.html">http://michaelmoore.com/missions/gates2/index.html</A>
"Why not Linux?    Unfortunately, Linux is still very much for the 
enthusiast. These children need an OS and software with which other 
people -- parents, teachers, peers -- are familiar so they can help 
them. Kids like to belong, so it is better for them to have software 
similar to that of their peers.
"
is just simply elitist and written by somebody who has not investigated 
just how good and how useful a Linux-based solution can be.

With many of PCs for Kids computers headed to East Timor perhaps they 
can explain just how many of those Dad's and Mum's have access to a 
computer let alone an MS computer.
