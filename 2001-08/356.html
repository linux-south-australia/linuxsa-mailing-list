 &gt; &gt; We're getting a lot more than that.  Maybe you don't have as high

 &gt; 
 &gt; The rate is almost certainly determined by the number of IP
 &gt; addresses you have exposed to the net, not the bit-rate
 &gt; of the pipe.
 
Consider the case of a customer with a NAT gateway with a static mapping
on port 80 pointing to an IIS server on 192.168.x.x.

Let's propose that that IIS server gets infested by a CodeRed worm 
on the Internet, through the NAT gateway.  So it'll start merrily
spamming the crap out of the entire Internet -- Including that portion
of the entire Internet that shares the first 16 bits of its IP address,
which is 192.168.x.y.

So, very quickly, all the *other* IIS servers, which aren't publically
accessible to The Internet at large, also get infested.  

... then they start spamming the crap out of the 'net as well... through
the NAT gateway.

So the NAT gateway is now handling outbound HTTP requests originating
from more than one IIS server:  The volume of outbound probes from that
single IP address will be double the normal volume of a CodeRed system.

Or, for an internal network with N IIS servers, the NAT gateway's outbound
data flow will be N x (normal bitrate for one CodeRed server).

That's how single IP addresses can end up emitting tens of megabits per
second worth of CodeRed probes, in the realm of several thousand probes
per second.

 &gt; I'm talking about incoming probes here.
 &gt; Maybe Mark's higher rate than 100 /second is outgoing probes?
 
Yes.  I don't care too much about incoming probes (they'll all fail,
because everyone has patched IIS, right?  Arrrgh! :-)
