&gt; I now find myself in the position of having to do a re-install, because 
&gt; apt-get -f dist-upgrade, or apt-get upgrade, etc, after having got over 
&gt; 120MB of packages from ftp.au.debian.org, always fails trying to upgrade 
&gt; gnotepad+.

Probably a bad sign if you've had to pass the -f flag to dist-upgrade.
What problems were making this necessary? Last time I did a potato to
woody or sid upgrade I had to alternate a couple of times between
dist-upgrade and upgrade but it did work out eventually.

&gt; I also can't use man, and X will not start, because it can't find the 
&gt; fixed font, and so on.

Have you installed XFree86 4.x or 3.x? The XFree 4.0 upgrade has not
been that smooth for me with bits and pieces missing in the upgrade
from potato. If it helps I've got the following fonts installed.

ii  xfonts-100dpi  4.1.0-2        100 dpi fonts for X
ii  xfonts-75dpi   4.1.0-2        75 dpi fonts for X
ii  xfonts-base    4.1.0-2        standard fonts for X

&gt; It has been a frustrating experience ... :-)

It does have an annoyingly steep learning curve, but I've found the
maintenance of Debian systems is much easier than other distros.

Chris.
