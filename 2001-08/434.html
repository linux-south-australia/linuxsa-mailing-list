Er, it's usually all the same. I'm yet to see a piece of webmail
software that says "Here's the underlying code. Go write some HTML for
the frontend".

&gt; the solaris box stores the mail, runs sendmail for SMTP, and has a POP3
&gt; and an IMAP server. The debian box is the gateway. It  runs postfix. I
&gt; want it to run a webmail service so people can  connect from outside,
&gt; thruogh it, to their internal mailboxes.

OK. I'm a little puzzled by your choice to run Postfix on the gateway,
as it could be easily installed on Solaris. Use NAT to do the rest of
the work.

&gt; I will use eitehr the postrfix on the debian server or the sendmail on
&gt; the solaris server. Haven't dexcided which yet, suppose it matters
&gt; little.

Telling it to use SMTP Server x.x.x.x will be a pain. Most mail clients
that I've looked into use /usr/bin/sendmail to, er, send the mail ;-)

You're right, though. It matters little.

&gt; "I doubt that dpkg (...)." is not the most complete sentence I have seen
&gt; on this list...

Whoops! Got sidetracked when I wrote that sentence :-) I doubt that dpkg
(or whatever it is called in Debian land) would be capable of doing all
the various configuration bits to get IMP working.

That said, dpkg may be able to call a script that does the work, but I
doubt anyone could be bothered doing any such thing.

&gt; yeah, I'd rather not bother with SQL -- all I really want is a http to
&gt; imap/smtp gateway, with no local storage of mail, no local
&gt; authentication info, little local config, and easily apt-getted

IMAP/POP will handle user authentication in IMP, as it does in most web
mail clients around. SQL isn't really that bad. MySQL can be easilly
configured to take up little amounts of resources and
compiling/installing is a sinch.

The "local config" for IMP is simply a matter of editing some basic
variables in a configuration file, then opening "setup.php3" in your
browser. This automatically generates the "defaults.php3" file from the
information you provide a nice, shiny web-based interface.

&gt; imp uses the database to store runtime info? yuck.
&gt; 
&gt; cross that off my list... 

With PHP3, there was no in-built session handling. Those who required
such a feature were forced to use bulky, unfriendly toolkits like
PHPLib, which can use a database to store session data.

I'd not go crossing it off my list immediately, though. Have a look at
the demo site, <A HREF="http://demo.horde.org/.">http://demo.horde.org/.</A> That'll give you an idea of its
capabilities.

If you want a nice, slick, slim web-based email environment, I'd
strongly recommend you take a look at SquirrelMail. Installing is a
simple matter of un-taring and running 'configure'. 'configure' is
actually a menu-driven configuration system which lets you specify the
necessary bits and pieces. It's on SourceForge somewhere.

One of the big advantages that SquirrelMail has over IMP is its complete
lack of bulk. IMP is designed to be a complete mail solution, with all
the bells and whistles (2.4 has some *cool* features). SquirrelMail is
also written in PHP4, which has inbuilt session handling features.

The long and the short of it is that SquirrelMail needs only an IMAP
server and a PHP4-capable webserver. It's easy, fast and reliable.

I used to use it on <A HREF="http://mail.plug.cx/,">http://mail.plug.cx/,</A> until I saw the light and used
Mutt over an SSH session when I needed my mail from afar :-)
