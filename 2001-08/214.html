I saw something like this on my work box, during the 2.4.0-test series for a
couple of revisions.

Basically, the codec seems to be locked to 48khz. Playing 44khz stuff on it
is going to sound a bit too fast. Newer sound drivers identify this, and
everything works fine.

Try bypassing esd, just to see what happens.
Next, try forcing esd to use 48khz output.

Regardless, try upgrading your kernel and sound driver ;)

&gt; OK this is one of those weird (friday afternoon) things...
&gt; I've got xmms:
&gt; xmms-esd-1.2.5-1
&gt; xmms-1.2.5-1
&gt; installed on a RedHat 6.2 box (I upgraded the original versions
&gt; cos I had problems with xmms freezing) using the i810_audio and
&gt; ac97_codec modules and it works ... but it plays mp3s just
&gt; slightly too fast.  It's more noticeable on some songs
&gt; than others, especially ones supposed to be slow (Britney
&gt; Spears sounds like a female donald duck! I know, I know, it's
&gt; probably an improvement!) but it's definitely there.
&gt; I think the pitch is ok, just the speed.
&gt;
&gt; I wondered if it was something to do with remote mounting
&gt; via smbclient - but copying the mp3 to my local disk makes
&gt; no difference.
&gt;
&gt; I have yet to try xplaycd (etc) on a normal audio cd and
&gt; see if that's the same, but in the meantime, anyone heard
&gt; of this before??  Or got any ideas??
&gt;
&gt; Ta,
&gt; Dave.
