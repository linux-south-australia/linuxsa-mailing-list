&gt;Ummm, strncpy (et al) are no panacea. You can still make mistakes in the

&gt;unterminated if you pass a string that is exactly the length specified, 
&gt;or something like that.

It is also possible to exploit poorly written C++ code that has been compiled
with the GNU C++ compiler.  MS Visual C++ generated code doesn't suffer from the
particular problem I will describe shortly.

Consider:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

class crap
{
        private:
                char buffer[1024];
                                            
        public:
                void fill_buffer(char *string)
                {
                        strcpy(buffer, string); // Obviously bad.
                }

                virtual void output_buffer()
                {
                        printf("%s\n", buffer);
                }
};

class foo:public crap
{
        public:
                void output_buffer()
                {
                        printf("foo: ");
                        crap::output_buffer();
                }
};

class bar:public crap
{
        public:
                void output_buffer()
                {
                        printf("bar: ");
                        crap::output_buffer();
                }
};

void main()
{
        crap *object[2];

        object[0] = new foo;
        object[1] = new bar; 

        object[0]-&gt;fill_buffer("string1");
        object[1]-&gt;fill_buffer("string2");
        object[0]-&gt;output_buffer();
        object[1]-&gt;output_buffer();
}

Notice the same calling primitives to output_buffer() for two different classes.
This is the result of using virtual methods.  If the method were not declared
virtual, the compiler would do the call resolution at compile time (known as
static binding).  As the method is declared virtual, the compiler uses dynamic
binding, calculating the address for the call at runtime.

The compiler would reserve 1024 bytes for the definition of buffer.  Then it
would read the declaration of the fill_buffer() method (which is not virtual)
and directly assigns the corresponding address in the code.  At this point, the
compiler reads the declaration of the output_buffer() method (which is virtual).
Instead of doing static binding, the compiler does dynamic binding, and reserves
4 bytes in the class (which will contain a pointer).

Thus we would have a structure like:

BBBBBBBB...[1024 of these]...BBBBVVVV

B representing a byte of the buffer, and V the pointer.

This pointer is called the virtual pointer, VPTR.  This pointer points to an
entry in an array of function pointers.  These in turn point to methods,
relative to the class.  There is one VTABLE for a class, that contains pointers
to all class methods.

It all looks something like this:

object[0]: BBBBBBBB...[1024 of these]....VVVV
                                          |
+-----------------------------------------+
|
+--- VTABLE_foo: IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPP

object[1]: BBBBBBBB...[1024 of these]....WWWW
                                          |
+-----------------------------------------+
|
+--- VTABLE_bar: IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIQQQQ


B represents a byte of the buffer
V represents a byte of the VPTR to VTABLE_foo
W represents a byte of the VPTR to VTABLE_bar
I represents various information bytes
P represents a byte of the pointer to the output_buffer() method of foo
Q represents a byte of the pointer to the output_buffer() method of bar

The astute reader will not that the VPTR is located after the buffer in the
processes memory space.  Thus inadequate bounds checking will allow the VPTR to
be clobbered.

I stated that MS Visual C++ compiled code is not vulnerable to this problem. 
This is because the MS compiler puts the VPTR at the beginning of the object.

It is possible to exploit this type of problem by creating a VTABLE inside the
buffer being overflowed.  If the the VTABLE is created so that its addresses
point to the code we want to run (also located in the buffer being overflowed,
after the new VTABLE), and overwrite the VPTR so that it points to the new
VTABLE, it is possible to get arbitrary code run.

This problem has been known about for some time now.  Having said that, I don't
think I have seen a real-world example of this.

Andrew.
