Ok here goes,

The School I work for (Pedare Christian College) is on a campus that has a
1Gb fibre connection to a shared facility.
The shared facility is also linked to Golden Grove High School and Gleason
Catholic High School. All three schools share computer labs, science labs
etc. at the central shared facility. Also each school's Novell server is
connected via 1Gb fibre to the shared facilities Novell server, soon all
servers will have their NDS trees merged so students/staff can log at any
place on the wider campus.

Most of the schools run 3Com switches for their switching needs and that's
fine, but what is missing? Routing! We are killing each other with each
others broadcast traffic. 3Com Australia have quoted a core routing solution
via their hardware (1 x core router) to the tune of about $30,000 as have
Cisco.

Of course their is more detail but this should get us going.

Here is the Linux question. Can Linux boxes be used to provide 1Gb routing
in this situation?

Does anyone for a company that can provide a solution via Linux?

Regards,

Patrick Browne
ICT Network Manager
Pedare Christian College (Inc.)
