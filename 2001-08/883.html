&gt; Mainly my lack of patience - I was upgrading my system to be able to
&gt; compile the latest Gnome sources, so when I found out that Debian was
&gt; still back at 1.2, that was annoying.

indeed -- progeny may be worth a look, if slow releases are your problem... however, I found progeny to not have enough packages for my liking...

&gt; I tried switching to Woody but that resulted in 150MB over the modem. So

I'm sure you could get woody on CD from everythinglinux... cheaper than the downloads :)

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; The difficulty (which still exists on Mandrake and any other system
&gt; which has packages) is when I want to upgrade some software that other
&gt; packages depend on. If I remove the old version, the other packages
&gt; complain. If I just install over the top, then it works but I have no

debian has allowance for putting version restrictions in the dependencies -- eg: package &gt;= 3.2.11 or something, but it's still not perfect...

&gt; idea what subtle mismatches there are between actuality and the
&gt; database. I can set nodeps to avoid checks, but then I keep getting
&gt; warnings. I didn't try putting in a dummy package as I'd gone to
&gt; Mandrake by that stage.

mmm

&gt; The other difficulty is that some packages can be compiled with or
&gt; without support for other programs... if I then install those other
&gt; programs, the initial package doesn't make use of them until it's
&gt; recompiled anyway. A 'make world' would do a proper probe of what's on
&gt; the system and adjust itself accordingly.

indeed, I have this issue atm -- I installed pppd, but it's compiled without ms-chap and I need it with ms-chap so I can run pptpd (VPN) as well... I'd either like to see a pppd-mschap package that can be used to replace pppd, or a mschap package that patches pppd... or your suggestion below...

&gt; In my bloated opinion, the design of packaging systems is flawed in the
&gt; first place - keeping databases of file structures creates a redundant
&gt; filesystem which then has to be maintained in parallel with the live
&gt; filesystem. It would be better to look at what's actually there and make
&gt; install/don't decisions on that basis (like "make world" would).

I really like the make world idea there...

does anyone know if this is doable with debian source packages? I'd be happy downloading all the source, and compiling everything if it was that simple... even if I had to mess with them a litte (a little) to get compile options in...

hmm...
