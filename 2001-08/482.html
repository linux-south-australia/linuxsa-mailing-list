Hi Colin

Yes we burn the midnight oil too. Meetings are definitely not a black 
tie affair. There is usually 50+ people at meetings, we have a speaker 
each month, people can bring their computers along if they need help and 
afterwards we grace the local pizza haunt for your choice of food and 
beverage (with a lively discussion or 2).

&gt; Hi Everyone
&gt; 
&gt; Just thought I would introduce myself to the list and greet you all. My name 
&gt; is Colin and I live in Bowden/Brompton. I am hopefully going to do my best to 
&gt; participate in the linuxsa group come to meetings and so on. I will 
&gt; definitely be there at the upcoming install-fest sounds like it will be a bit 
&gt; of fun and also I will get to meet other people with possibly similar 
&gt; interests.
&gt; I come from a computing background although computer use experience has been 
&gt; negligible until recently (last few months)as I stopped working with 
&gt; computers over a decade ago and back then I was working as a programmer using 
&gt; RPL and D on a PDP-11/73 running RT-11/TSX.
&gt; Anyone know of any jobs going for experienced but out of practise PDP-11 
&gt; programmers? Hmmmm - I didn't think so!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway my question (wipes sweat from brow after writing the first draft of 
&gt; autobiography) is how many people are regular attenders of the LinuxSA group 
&gt; and are the meeting black tie affairs? (if so can someone lend me a tux)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yours
&gt;
