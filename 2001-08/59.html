&gt; &gt; Shouldn't they have said that nearly 90% of the Internet had nothing to
&gt; &gt; fear from Code Red? &lt;G&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Or should they point out that just over 50% (is this correct?) of web
&gt; servers run Apache on Linux/xBSD/Solaris etc...? With Microsoft IIS being
&gt; about 30%.
&gt;
&gt; The MS spokes people who say that Microsoft is being targeted because it
&gt; is in wide use are not acknowledging the web server usage. Which leaves
&gt; the OS OS's out of the picture. Well articulated FUD.
&lt;snip&gt;
It would seem to me that MS is being targeted not only because its being
widely used, but also because it HAS known vulnerabilities that are easily
exploitable, and IIS is frequently unpatched.

We have regular security scans of our entire campus, and when the poizon
box worm was going around, people were notified.  Our Business school
neglected to patch, and was 'hacked'.  They were hit again (3 days later)
as they were applying the patch.

Although much of the blame lies w/microsoft, I think that more of the
problem is with lax sysadmins.  The poizon box worm exploited an OLD
problem w/Sun systems, one that should've been patched a long time ago.
I am NOT trying to encourage flames here, but I would be curious to see
how harmful a similar type of worm affecting Apache would be.  Of course,
someone would probably just write a worm that went and patched the holes
;)

Here's an nice article from excite
<A HREF="http://news.excite.com/news/zd/010801/08/the-worms-dont">http://news.excite.com/news/zd/010801/08/the-worms-dont</A>
It's time for all of us to take a deep breath and chill the heck out. Code
Red, my friends, is not that big a deal. Well, at least not yet.

Let's look at the facts. Code Red invades Microsoft Internet Information
Services Web servers running on Windows NT or 2000, and then uses that
server to begin scanning for more vulnerable machines, and the cycle
continues. The first version defaces the Web site, while the two variants
floating out there do not.

And then another article about who is to blame
