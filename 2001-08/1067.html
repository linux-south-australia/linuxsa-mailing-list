&gt; Does anyone know of a reseller that is selling small boards?

I found these people today. They apparently have a place around the Unley
area:

  <A HREF="http://www.mayerkrieg.com.au/embed_comp/default.htm">http://www.mayerkrieg.com.au/embed_comp/default.htm</A>

Not sure what their prices are like, but they sure have some funky
hardware. :-)

&gt; There is another interesting board out there, which is the Axis embedded 
&gt; developer board: <A HREF="http://developer.axis.com/hardware/devboard/.">http://developer.axis.com/hardware/devboard/.</A> It has a 
&gt; RISC processor, an ethernet port, 2MB of flash and 8MB DRAM.
&gt; 
&gt; The 2MB flash makes it a bit limiting, though, since you could not get 
&gt; enough of a file system on it.

I guess it would depend on what you needed and how you went about it. I
think that the RAM would be the biggest limiting factor. If you had twice
as much RAM, the hardware could be used for a great deal of things. You
could have the custom kernel and tarballs of the root file system in flash
(tar has less space overhead than most filesystems) and mount a 4MB
ramdisk as the root FS. I believe that this is how the Linux Router
project and other little-bitty floppy distributions work with 1.44, 1.6
and 1.7 MB floppy disks.

Hope it helps,
Matt
