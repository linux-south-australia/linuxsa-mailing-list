&gt;In fact, thinking about this more, this seems to indicate that
&gt;the sequence of IP addresses probed must be deterministic.
&gt;So if you see one machine probe 10 of your addresses
&gt;in a sequence, then all other machines should probe
&gt;them in the same sequence.
&gt;That would be straightforward to test from the logs - but
&gt;I really can't be bothered.

Alan,

We were hit repeatedly here with CodeRed 1 before we patched our NT4
Boxen...  And I observed something very similar to what you're suggesting
above.  We'd always loose 3 of the 4 IIS boxes here in quick succession (all
in 203.38.230.x space), and they always seemed to go in the same order.
Then within a couple of minutes one of our clients (in 139.130.x.x space)
lost their IIS proxy.  Strangely, while machines .1 to .8 seemed to be
probed regularly, .9 never got probed by CodeRed 1.  Which may suggest that
the original Code Red's random number generator was flawed, and never
generated some IP's.  CodeRed2 generates IP's differently so .9 is probably
getting probed now anyway.

I could probably confirm this from logs, but we're patched now so it really
doesn't matter.

Jim.
