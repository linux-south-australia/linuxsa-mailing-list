 &gt; Some people might take the same attitude to computers.
 &gt; Obviously you're not one of them, but I guess that for the mass
 &gt; market, pre-installation might not be so bad.

If people take the same attitude towards computers, why would you suggest
that they might need to install their own Linux OS (akin to assembling 
their own car!) before they can use it?

I can't see how this analogy supports the idea that pre-installing 
by hardware vendors is a bad thing.

 &gt; I'd still say that if someone is getting linux for a personal
 &gt; workstation, and they're going to use that as their main
 &gt; development machine, day in, day out, then probably they would
 &gt; want to have the "installation experience" so that they
 &gt; will get a deeper understanding of what they're doing.

But surely that's like saying that anyone who is going to earn their
living by driving a taxi would probably enjoy the experience of buying
a car without an engine, and buying and installing a separate engine
before they drive the taxi?

 &gt; For all we know, Dell might have not the slightest interest
 &gt; in the linux customer. We may be mere bargaining chips to them.

Like, duh.
