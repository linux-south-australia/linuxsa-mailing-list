Glen,

It all depends on what kind of software you're writing.
I'd divide software into 3 categories for this purpose:

1.	Realtime, such as device drivers and comms
	protocol software.
	Here I don't mean realtime as in fast.
	I mean that the time at which things get executed
	is critical to correct performance.
	I.e. there are deadlines.
2.	Event-driven interactive.
3.	Batch jobs.

Using a debugging tool which slows down execution in
category 1 is going to alter things totally.
Generally it just isn't possible to find bugs
with a debugging tool in the case of device drivers
and user-space protocol software.

In case 2, you probably can use a debugger, but sometimes
things inside GUI libraries could be altered if you
change the timing. E.g. buffer overflows might not happen
if you go step by step - or they might happen when they
wouldn't normally.

Case 3 is where a debugger should always be fine.

Since I've done a fair heap of software in category 1,
I just can't use a debugger, and I have to get in the habit
of using things like PRINTK as a #define macro for
printk which is turned on by a DEBUG macro, or else I
use the #if 1 ... #endif technique that you mentioned.

By the way, I've just been reading a book about GTK+ in
French, where I came across a word heisenbogue.
It turns out that this is the same as Heisenbug,
which is new to me, but it nicely describes those nasty
memory allocation errors which occur at a random point in
a program after the error occurs, and when you add the
printf, the program crash point moves to somewhere else.
The only sensible way to deal with this is probably to
just monitor the memory stats, which I notice is provided
as a service in glib.

In the case of the Heisenbug, it may be that the
debugger method is better than trace lines.

The worst case is what I cam across last year with a
device driver which halted the system.
In that case, there was no choice but to read and
understand the entire 3000 lines of someone else's code.
Not a happy task with uncommented code!

I can't see the source code problem in the case of
a programmer working on a temporary own copy of source,
as long as they don't commit the code with the trace
lines uncommented.

My conclusion is that I nearly always prefer to
use the printf trace-line method of debugging.
By accumulating such trace lines over time,
it I get in trouble, I can always turn them all on
and see what's happening.
I regard insertion of trace lines as being almost as 
important as checking the sanity of all function parameters
and return values.

As always, I'm happy to be educated if I'm wrong!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
