&gt; To paraphrase the Linux PocketBook: "The Debian Project considers man
&gt; pages and other documentation not in the right place, or non existent as
&gt; a bug. Report these things as such". And, from this list: "Debian
&gt; Unstable [it may be the Pocketbook actually] tends to be more stable
&gt; than other [nameless] distributions".

yeah...
 
&gt; Whilst I think Debian is a good distribution and that apt-get has got
&gt; the right idea, I'd hazard a guess that apt-get is probably getting used
&gt; by the wrong people; that is to say, Debian appears to be a hacker's
&gt; Linux and apt-get is a really good way to keep up with all the hackers'
&gt; work.

not quite... it really depends how you use apt-get...

if you are sticking to stable (even when they make frozen stable), then all will be well, and you will have stable and secure stuff...

if you use apt-get with frozen, testing or unstable, you can expect things to not work all that well (such is the nature of early-release, beta or even alpha software)... as it happens, apt-get does tend to get a little confused if things don't work perfectly, which they don't in those less stable distributions... however, if someone has trouble with just stable, I'd be surprised...

&gt; Of course, RedHat and others tend to bomb their beta distributions and
&gt; this is to be expected. But generally, things like RPM still work...

dpkg most likely still works... apt-get is a high-level tool that does a *lot*. Not only does it find out what you need to upgrade, but it downloads it for you, along with all dependancies, and so on and so forth... yes, it's not perfect, and there are a number of things that I want that I don't find in apt-get, but if you stick to stable, and only do "normal" sort of things, it's pretty much faultless...

:)
