Hi Everyone

Just thought I would introduce myself to the list and greet you all. My name 
is Colin and I live in Bowden/Brompton. I am hopefully going to do my best to 
participate in the linuxsa group come to meetings and so on. I will 
definitely be there at the upcoming install-fest sounds like it will be a bit 
of fun and also I will get to meet other people with possibly similar 
interests.
I come from a computing background although computer use experience has been 
negligible until recently (last few months)as I stopped working with 
computers over a decade ago and back then I was working as a programmer using 
RPL and D on a PDP-11/73 running RT-11/TSX.
Anyone know of any jobs going for experienced but out of practise PDP-11 
programmers? Hmmmm - I didn't think so!

Anyway my question (wipes sweat from brow after writing the first draft of 
autobiography) is how many people are regular attenders of the LinuxSA group 
and are the meeting black tie affairs? (if so can someone lend me a tux)


Yours

Colin Rose
