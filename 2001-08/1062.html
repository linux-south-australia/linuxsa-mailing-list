It sounds like the problem is incurring in your sysadmin, not the software.

What is his problem with allowing non-priveledged ports (ie 1024 and up) to
pass thru the firewall?

TCP uses two connections, always. One for control, one for data. Passive or
Active just determines who initiates the connection for the data.

rsh and rcp are an alternative, but these are definately not all that
secure!

Here's an idea thou - on your linux box, where you have root access, setup
something on port 21 -- it doesn't have to be FTP, remember. Maybe sshd?

Compile up ssh on the solaris box and rename it to ftp.
(You may want to modify it to report as ftp as well,
but with a flag that turns it into ssh, just to be sneaky)

If you admin asks, tell him you modified ftp to work over a different,
static, port. Its close enough to the truth.

Now, use ssh, scp, sftp, or alternatively use its port-forwarding abilities
to allow whatever the hell you like! ;)

&gt; &gt; Must it be FTP? Could you use SCP instead? If you've got any access to
&gt; &gt; the Solaris box at all, this could be a viable alternative.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Even if you don't have root access on the Solaris box, you could
&gt; &gt; configure SSHd to bind to an unprivelidged port and get the router
&gt; &gt; administrator to change the port number.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the funny thing.  I have (user-level) shell access to the Solaris box,
&gt; but ssh is banned.  Why?  If ssh were permitted then I could setup a VPN and
&gt; stop sysadmins from (easy) snooping when they felt like it.
&gt;
&gt; So I'm left with ftp to get files there.  Of course, right now, this means high
&gt; ports remaining open which is more of a risk than ssh (or so I would have
&gt; thought).
&gt;
&gt; Oh well.  Thanks Andrew.  Any other ideas welcomed,
&gt;
&gt; Michael...
