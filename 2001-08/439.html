Let's not beat around the bush here. Internode provide CodeRed filtering
at their expense. Telstra don't. Looking at the web server logs, the
rate at which we're receiving CodeRed attempts has dropped to nearly 0
as compared to thousands.

&gt; Similarly, I wouldn't expect Bigpond to be able or willing to
&gt; put in sophisticated application-level blocking, nor would
&gt; I expect it to work correctly if they did.

Why the hell not? Their competitors are providing it.

&gt; It might not be free either.

Internode haven't charged us a cent.

&gt; I'm not at all tired of the little 33k link.
&gt; It protects me from bankruptcy. In the worst case of
&gt; the link getting filled, I still don't go broke.

We've been using broadband for several years now. It's quite
significantly larger than the 33.6Kbps that you're using. It's an 11Mbps
wireless connection. On a good day, we get a maximum of about 400Kbps
out of it. We download approximately 10GB per month and we're yet to get
into financial poo.

Internode provide CodeRed filtering, which removes the issues
surrounding the cost of CodeRed (to us, anyway).

&gt; If I get one of those modern-fangled ADSL links, I can go broke
&gt; in very few days, if I'm paying by the MByte at 20c/MByte 
&gt; or whatever. The 33k link is my "budget shaper"!!

Again, unless you're completely stupid with your link, it's pretty hard
to use lots of bandwidth. BTW, the price that Internode charge for
excess data with ADSL connections is $0.18/MB.

&gt; And ISDN would double my costs, roughly.

And, what, quadruple your performance?

&gt; If ADSL were more reliable, more functional (plenty of numerical
&gt; IP addresses and no conditions on me having servers etc.),
&gt; and if it had a sensible price cap, then I might spend a lot
&gt; of time converting over. Right now, 33k is realiable and cheap,
&gt; and I've addressed most of the "issues" after 2.5 years of it.

Huh? It seems that your focusing very much on the Telstra offering.
Internode's ADSL has been incredibly reliable from where I stand, as
well as being incredibly cheap (it's a T1 connection[1], remember).

Internode don't give a damn how many servers we put behind the link. In
fact, they encourage it. They sell NAT boxes to do the things Tesltra
expressly prohibit. IP space is easily obtained:

    * Andrew rings Internode
    * Andrew asks for /x IP range
    * Andrew hangs up and goes back to whatever he was doing

It's not really that hard.

&gt; When ADSL goes beyond the roll-out phase and enters a more stable,
&gt; mature phase, I'll look at it again.

We're using it at work for *everything*. It's mature enough for us.

If you remember a few months back, the list was full of anticipation as
to when Internode would release their ADSL offering. To summarize
Simon's reasons for the "delay": they wanted to get it right, first
time. They've done a damn good job if you ask me.

&gt; Well, they're not at all as bad as people say.

Pfft!

&gt; They are very responsive to me. Having problems at 3 am,
&gt; I've always been able to contact an expert who can fix things
&gt; and look at logs etc. 

Telstra also have people who seem to know nothing about what they're
doing. Being alerted to a dead router by one of your competitors is not
a good thing.

&gt; And as I said, they're cheap and reliable and stable.

... and don't provide the things that you seem to be worried about
(let's take CodeRed as an example).

&gt; I've heard that Telstra don't play fair with their competitors,
&gt; but from my point of view as a customer, they haven't been
&gt; at all bad.

You seem to be passing off Simon's comments as if they're somewhere near
the truth, or something. In fact, they're so anti-competitive, their
competitors have to spend lots of time getting the ACCC to tell them
off. Just think of all the wonderful possibilities if Telstra stopped
being assholes!

&gt; Having spent so much time setting up my networks (total 10 real
&gt; hosts) so that I can work overseas for up to 6 weeks and know that
&gt; I don't have to fly back to fix it all, I don't want to go 
&gt; through all the same issues with another technology.

Changing ISPs isn't really that hard. We just did it (CCA -&gt; Internode).
In real terms, it was a matter of re-numbering our network and letting
the Agile people poke and prod the antenna. Not long after that we had a
working Internode Internet link.

&gt; But the real killer issue is cost.
&gt; There's no price cap on anyone's ADSL as far as I know.

So be careful with your usage. As I said above, we've had *real*
bandwith for several years now, and have *never* ran into a situation
where we've used enough to hurt our wallets beyond repair.

&gt; That means I can run up A$1000 or much more per day.

Sure does! Use that $150/hour brain of yours to make sure it doesn't
happen.

&gt; No one likes to sign a blank cheque that can be filled in
&gt; by a script kiddie with an army of DDoS zombies.

&lt;scratches head&gt;. We've got an 11Mbps wireless link, a /26 subnet
assigned to us and the worst we've ever had is a 2GB mail-bomb. We've
not had any real DoS problems.

&gt; Install a budget shaper to my specifications - then
&gt; you'll get my business!

I suppose if your "budget shaper" is so important to you, you could
always get a dialup account with Internode and use your 33Kbps modem.
That way, you're still getting the same link, with the inbuilt "budget
shaper", but with a better ISP.

I'm still failing to see how it's all as bad as you claim it is.
