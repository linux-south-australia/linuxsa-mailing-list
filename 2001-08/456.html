<H1>everything too large in X on RedHat 7.1</H1>

A few years ago when I started using linux, RedHat 5.0 was just released.
When I ran X on my resolution of 1024x768 everything was nice and small. In
fact, I could fit an xterm and emacs session side by side with no overlap
(using each's default size).

Now using Gnome on XFree84 4.? (whatever comes with RH 7.1) I try to do the
same and over 50% of the emacs window overlaps the xterm window. My display
is still configured to run at 1024x768 and I can confirm this by going in
the monitor's menu and looking at the 'status' section. When resizing
windows, the size of the window is displayed in the centre of the screen. Am
I correct that the size should be displaying the number of pixels? When I
resize a window such that it's taking up the whole screen (including going
over that panel at the bottom of the screen) it says it's about 716x444.

This has been bothering me for a while, but I haven't had to use linux as a
workstation for some time so I put up with it. I'm going to use my box a lot
more over the next few weeks (for development), so I'd really like to make
everything smaller (I feel like I should be sitting about 2 meters back from
the monitor), but I'd prefer not to increase resolution. Does anyone have
any suggestions how I may be able to make everything smaller again, or
should I just increase the screen resolution?

thanks,
Andy
