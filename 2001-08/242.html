&gt; Thinking about the problems thatothers have gone through trying to get

&gt; Another question might be is it worth it to get a factory installed 
&gt; Linux setup or is it still better to roll your own so you know what is 
&gt; in it?

Although I've never tried to buy a preinstalled linux
system, it seems to me that you usually will want to
do a lot of configuration, re-installation etc.
during the life of any machine, and it's easier to
install and configure linux yourself than to tell
someone else what you want on it.

I think it defeats the purpose entirely of using linux
if someone else is going to install it for you.

Most of the problems reported with setting up linux
are due to either:
1.	People trying to put linux on really wierd
	hardware or trying to make linux do really
	wierd, off-beat thing, or
2.	People trying to install linux without
	the prerequisite unix background.
	
In case 2, the real problem is not with the installation.
It's with the whole linux thing in toto.
In case 1, you'd much rather know what is going onto
your machine, so that you can fix it when it goes wrong.

The skills required for installation and initial
configuration are closely related to the skills required
for ongoing maintenance. So if the user can't do one,
how can they do the other?

It's also much easier to report a problem is someone
can say: "I have hardware X, distribution Y version N,
and I did Z to this machine."
Saying "Dell installed my OS." is not likely to
be at all helpful.

To me it seems like good value if someone like Dell
can say "This hardware is known to work with RH 7.1."
or soemthing like that.
Getting mainstream vendors to get in the habit of
selling "naked PCs" is also good value.
Bundling is bad.

Just an opinion...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
