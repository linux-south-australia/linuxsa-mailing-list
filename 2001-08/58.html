&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyone else got one yet?
&gt; 
&gt; you kidding?
&gt; I got 25 (from different addresses) between 01:06:48 and 08:00:52
&gt; on the 20th July, and I don't even have a permanent connection.
&gt; None since then though.


My 22 virtual hosts scored as follows so far
(up to CST 01:23 2 Aug 2001):

July 2001:	403 hits
August 2001:	 34 hits

The speed is increasing quite rapidly.
The people who said it might not happen after all
might be wrong!

Virtually all of the July/2001 hits were 20 July/2001.
Only 3 were on 21/Jul/2001 (CST), and 1 was on
22/Jul/2001.
So far, I have 17 each on 1 and 2 Aug/2001.
It's definitely accelerating.

A strange thing is that most of the
client hosts (about 54%) have no reverse DNS.
Virtually all of the rest are from English-speaking
TLDs, reflecting the fact that the worm only attacks
IIS hosts which ahve the language set to English.
The high number of no-reverse-DNS hosts 
seems to indicate that they are just machines which
are not really performing any particular server function
on the net and are just connected because they are
being used as workstations.

I tried to run the concatenation of the 22 log files
through webalizer, but it comes out wrong because
the times are not in sequence. 
Does anyone happen to have a chronological sort program for
Apache log files?
I can't be bothered to write the program myself, since
probably someone's done it already.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
