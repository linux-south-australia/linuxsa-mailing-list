Welcome Mr Lurker :-)

Take pleasure in the excitement, you have probably one of the best small 
servers out in your hands. E-smith is simply IMO the easiest and most 
user friendly Linux disto out there, no self confessing Internet user 
should be without one.

There are good RPM's for it too from e-smith.org and a really nice one 
that adds to the browser interface to let you set specific times to 
connect and disconnet to the net, instead of the set times by default.

It has a bug in it, but I figured it out and posted the maintainer.  If 
you use it and it's not fixed, mail me and I'll get you round it.

I like playing in Linux, but its an e-smith server for me for my main 
server box.

Congrats and welcome to superb OSS software


Steve

&gt; Hi all,

&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; This is my first post to the list as I have been a lurker for quite a 
&gt; while. I have tried many flavours of Linux and as a relative newbie I 
&gt; have settled with Mandrake for the time being. I have a small home 
&gt; network with 5 computers on it and up untill now have struggled with 
&gt; Win2K Server. Today I received a copy of e-smith software from 
&gt; Everything Linux and jumped straight in and installed it on a box to 
&gt; suck the lollypop so to speak. 1 hour later with minimal reading, all 
&gt; boxes talking to each other and with email and shared internet access 
&gt; working fine.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry about the long post, I got a little excited.
&gt;
