&gt; Except he's talking about webhosting, which is usually run out
&gt; of an ISP's premises, and is unrelated to broadband.  In addition,
&gt; while you may think it is possible to bandwidth throttle that
&gt; sort of traffic to a web server, bear in mind the fact that a
&gt; lot of domains are virtually hosted these days, including this
&gt; gisol[1] one.  Simple enough to check; go to <A HREF="http://gisol.org/,">http://gisol.org/,</A>
&gt; take a note of the page.  Then do a "dig a gisol.org", and go
&gt; to the IP address of that (216.117.169.162).  Not the same page
&gt; (the reverse name lookup gives nameservices.net).  How will your
&gt; traffic shaper distinguish that sort of traffic?
&gt; 
&gt; [1]  At least, where it's currently residing.

Daryl,

You're quite right about those points.
The site with massive bandwidth was called nosepilot or something,
and it provided various entertainment graphics.
The current site of this guy is different.

I gather what happened is that he had a home site with broadband link
where he had the server.
So in that case, an IP layer bandwidth throttler/shaper would
have been just the right thing.

In the case of name-based virtual hosting, it's much better to
do the throttling at the applications level - namely with
an Apache throttler module, of which there are many.
(In fact, I wrote one such module and some site administrators
have told me that it is very useful to block crazy spiders
which download 1 GByte/hour.)

Clearly if you can't adequately classify traffic, you can't 
meter and shape it. And in the case of name-based hosting,
classification is difficult in the IP layer.

By the way, on the subject of webhosting being "usually run out
of an ISP's premises", this has always struck me as curious.
ISPs worldwide do make this sort of assumption, although there
are no totally compelling reasons to not have web sites collocated
with a business premises. I guess it's a cultural thing.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
