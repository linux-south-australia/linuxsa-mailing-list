Glen,

That's if you're just worried about security.
What I'm worried about is:

1.	The cost of all that rubbish on my link.
	If I can stop it at the first packet or two,
	then I don't get the 20 packets at 4 kBytes
	from every infected host. (Cost = $50-$100/month.)
2.	I hate seeing all that rubbish in my log files:
	tail -f /var/log/httpd/*.access.log
	My http log screen is 80-100% code red
	access at all times. Very ugly!
3.	Code red messes up the webalizer analysis.
	I'll have to filter all the log files
	to fix that.
4.	It wastes bandwidth on my little 33k link.
5.	It wastes disk space in my log files.

If it was going to stop at end of August, I woudln't
bother. But it looks like this thing will be with us
at least till Xmas.

With an all-linux network, security is not my problem.

The real problem is that I have 20 web servers - not one.
I.e. 20 IP-based web servers on one physical server.

Anyway, Simon's suggestion of snort.org looks like it will
do the trick.
Looks like more "learning curve" for me this week.
Isn't system administration a blast! (Not.)
A new big blob of software to familiarise myself with every week.
Eyes down, look in...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Just on this topic....
I've been avoiding name-based virtual hosting for a long time.
This was because:
1.	If the DNS fails for some reason, then I can still
	serve up all web servers.
2.	In the olden days, browsers couldn't cope with
	name-based servers because they didn't send the
	intended domain name as part of the HTTP request.
	I'm worried that there might be a fair proportion
	of browsers out there that might still be like that.
3.	It's easier to use telnet to port 80 to test
	an IP-based name server. You don't have to
	specify the domain name in the request.

Reason 3 is not very strong.
But is REason 2 strong?
I suspect that reason 1 is not strong, because very few
people would think of using a numerical IP address in a URL.
