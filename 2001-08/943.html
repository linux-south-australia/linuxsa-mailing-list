Hi Mick,

At 02:30  26/08/01 +0930, you wrote:
 &gt;I have previously sent a e-mail to this list about my firewall. Someone
 &gt;answered it and said that the reason I cant ftp and stuff is because the
 &gt;default input policy is DENY.

That's watering it down a bit, but yeah ;-)
I was saying that you have 2 ways of looking at any pkt filetering gateway:
a) DENY &lt;Specific list of bad things&gt; ; then ALLOW EVERYTHING
OR
b) ALLOW &lt;Specific list of necessary services&gt; ; then DENY EVERYTHING

The philosophy behind choice A is somewhat naive because it is practically
impossible to keep abreast of every possible trojan port that gets invented
or used by the script-kiddies who are sending the kind of packets that
ipchains is being used to block.

So, quite rightly, you have used choice B.
The only snag here is that you need to examine _exactly_ what network
services you are running there (never a bad thing really). Once you know
what protocols/ports you need to allow for your server (eg: apache=TCP/80,
sendmail=TCP/25, pop3=TCP/110, etc...) and make rules for them.

Outbound connection's return traffic is sweet if you have this little rule:
/sbin/ipchains -A input -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 1024:65535  !-j ACCEPT -l


 &gt; Is there anyways to change this so It will all
 &gt;work. Like Halflife, Quake Servers and stuff??

Even in the previous thread, you have not yet clarified
the details of your traffic scenario. This is why my original
posting was not a perfect recipe for you to just 'plug-in'.  ;-)

I'll assume for now we are talking about ppp clients running
these games and connecting to an internet server somewhere?

What are the specifics of these protocols?
ie: client &lt;--&gt; server == [C_PORT_NO] &lt;--&gt; [S_PORT_NO]
Are they TCP or UDP?
(No, I haven't run any of these games through ipchains before,
so I don't know their specs...just tcpdump some tests with
the "input" chains flushed).

Assuming they were 'standard' TCP, client=random_high_port to server=set_port
connections, the return traffic rule (above) and the following would work:

#Allow Outbound Game Requests
/sbin/ipchains -A input -i ppp+ -p tcp --dport S_PORT_NO -j ACCEPT -l

You basically need to find out exactly what it is you want to allow, and then
write rules for them (or at least tell us so we can suggest some for you ;-).

Cheers,
-Daniel
