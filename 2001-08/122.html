I haven't been using MS software for so long,
I don't know if I've interpreted this right.

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/20805.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/20805.html</A>

(This driver-certification thing has been in the news for
a few months - but now they've turned it on. 
And they've implemented a list of proscribed apps.)

It seems like this means that if I were to write an
application for Wind-XP, then I would need to get
some sort of crypto certificate from MS in order
for the software to run - if there is any need to
work at the device driver level.

Either way, this is the biggest "marketing coup"
I've seen for linux for a long time.
MS can no longer claim to be a true operating system.
An OS is supposed to be a functional layer below
applications upon which applications are written.
The OS is not supposed to maintain a list of which
applications are permitted - that's a violation of
the standard functional layering implicit in operating
system design over the last few decades.

I am _so_ glad I abandoned learning the win32 API when I
did, several years ago, because in retrospect, it had
no future.

I wonder if this certification thing applies to the
Cygwin GNU C/C++ compiler and environment.
Would Cygnus (or Red Hat) now have to get certification
from MS to be able to deliver their free developer's kit
to users? I guess that would depend on whether Cygwin
has any components at the device driver level, but I 
can't be sure. 

If anyone has been following this subject area for the sake of
doing dual linux and MS applications development, could
you please clarify what the situation will be for
developers using Cygwin now?
I don't see any answers on the Cygwin site:
<A HREF="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</A> or <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/.">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/.</A>

Just in the last week, I started looking at Cygwin GNU software
on a friend's wind98 machine so that I could deliver some
simulation software on MS "platforms". (It was a shock to
realise just how much garbage wind98 is - the rumours that it
is a lousy OS are greatly understated!)
Now I'm wondering if I would be wasting my time learning
how to port linux software to Cygwin.
Maybe this has no future.
And I'm not prepared to get a copy of the MS compiler.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
