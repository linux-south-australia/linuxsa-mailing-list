Hi Greg,

The company I work for offer several deals which are quite reasonable.

For $100/month you get your satellite, dialup and up to 3 email accounts
with "unlimited" downloads. This covers the installation of the satellite
and the setup of your computer (if required), all dialup charges (ie the
amount of time that you spend online) and the cost of the hardware (minus
the modem and phone line).

The bandwidth is around the 400kbps mark depending on your location and
weather conditions.

We do have other deals available for satellite but this is the best one and
I don't want to go too commercial on this list.

The only downside is that we currenlty have no Adelaide POP so you closest
dialin point would be Bordertown :-(

Anywho, I hope this gives you some idea of what is out there.

&gt; &gt;&gt; At the Installfest last Saturday I heard about one option for
&gt; &gt;&gt; satellite connectivity for surprisingly low rates (under $1000 setup,
&gt; &gt;&gt; about $50 a month "unlimited bandwidth", whatever that means).  That's
&gt; &gt;&gt; only one option, though; does anybody have an overview of the options?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; nope.  My bit I wanted to chip in was all the sat options
&gt; &gt; I've seen rely on still using a modem for the uplink - which
&gt; &gt; means you need a phone line and plan with an ISP etc for the modem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This usually bumps up the total price a fair bit and usually not a
&gt; &gt; permanent connection either (and obviously a slow uplink speed
&gt; &gt; compared to down).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But I heard rumours of some mob setting up true two-way sat
&gt; &gt; (either symetrical or asymetrical can't remember)
&gt; &gt; Anyone know who does such a thing? (and prices, how well does
&gt; &gt; it work etc)
&gt;
&gt; Hmm.  I was about to put up with a telephone uplink (and I have a
&gt; permanent connection, so that's not the issue).  But I believe that
&gt; Optus is planning some two-way satellite connections.  I wonder what
&gt; the pricing will be like.
