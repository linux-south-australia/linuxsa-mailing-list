You've stopped just short of what you want to happen to these mails you
dont have. The whole thing sounds pretty complex. How many users are
there?

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a major headache on my hands with a procmailrc setup.
&gt; For anyone who just stopped reading and is already typing "RTFM", please
&gt; feel free
&gt; to include some _useful_ FM's because I have looked but as yet cannot find
&gt; a single recipe
&gt; that is trying to do what I need ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; The Scenario:
&gt; I have a client who loves his NT mailserver (which lives on their LAN,
&gt; running off a PPP link) and
&gt; has up till now maintained all their addresses there. The system had with
&gt; his old ISP was that
&gt; they received all of his domains mail on a sigle mailbox (via an
&gt; @domain.com "virtusertable" referrence).
&gt; Once POP3ed to the NT machine, the mailserver software (FTgate I think)
&gt; would sift it based on the
&gt; "To:" addresses and shuffle it off to local Exchange mailboxes. Nice and
&gt; simple, I know ;-)
&gt; However, there are other offices for this company, and they all had to have
&gt; mailboxes with their
&gt; local ISP's so that the FTgate could bounce mail for their aliases off to
&gt; these external addresses.
&gt; This meant that all this mail (not bound for the Exchange accounts) was
&gt; transfered down their PPP
&gt; link, played with by the NT machine and then sent back out the link to
&gt; various other ISP's.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, they have come to my company requesting a Linux server (that we farm
&gt; for them) which can run
&gt; their WWW and MAIL services. The web stuff was a no-brainer, but the mail
&gt; is a messy situation.
&gt; 
&gt; The scenario I have suggested to the client was to create POP3 boxes for
&gt; all of these external offices'
&gt; staff on the Linux mailserver (which is the official MX pref for their
&gt; domain) and all other mail should go
&gt; into a single POP3 box for the FTgate to check and disect. Basic idea was
&gt; to minimise all the needless
&gt; mail traffic their dialup was suffering from.
&gt; 
&gt; The client promised me that all the external sites addresses (previously
&gt; redirected by FTgate) were
&gt; running off aliases that always had an identifying prefix. EG:
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:NSW.joe@domain.com">NSW.joe@domain.com</A>, <A HREF="mailto:NSW.mary@domain.com">NSW.mary@domain.com</A>,
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:VIC.sales@domain.com.">VIC.sales@domain.com.</A> So I did plan it assuming that there would some way
&gt; of filtering them.
&gt; 
&gt; ANYWAY, the solution I used was to setup the exact same "virtusertable"
&gt; entry they used to have
&gt; (pointing to a single mailbox, let's call it "master") and a .procmailrc
&gt; (in /home/master) that would catch
&gt; any mail with a "To:" field that started with the relevant prefixes and
&gt; re-send them locally to "<A HREF="mailto:USER@localhost">USER@localhost</A>"
&gt; (which bypassed the "virtusertable" and was picked up by the entries in
&gt; /etc/aliases for each real user).
&gt; 
&gt; The Problem:
&gt; It worked great for a while but now he is adding all kinds of addresses to
&gt; the Linux server and not all of
&gt; them have prefixes that I am filtering (so they end up on his FTgate
&gt; wondering were to go next).
&gt; Worse, not all of the existingly known "<A HREF="mailto:NSW.foo@domain.com">NSW.foo@domain.com</A>" addresses have
&gt; been re-created on
&gt; the Linux server (so they do get filtered but come up as "user unknown" and
&gt; there is an ever-growing
&gt; "dead-letter" file as a result).
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;quick thankyou to anyone still reading&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; My existing config/recipe is:
&gt; 
&gt; /etc/mail/virtusertable:
&gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; @foo.com.au        master+%1
&gt; -----------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; AND
&gt; 
&gt; /home/master/.procmailrc:
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------
&gt; DOMAIN=foo.com.au
&gt; ENV_TO=$1
&gt; 
&gt; :0f
&gt; * ENV_TO ?? .
&gt; | formail -i "X-Envelope-To: "$ENV_TO@$DOMAIN
&gt; :0fE
&gt; | formail -i "X-Envelope-To: UNKNOWN"
&gt; 
&gt; :1:
&gt; * ^To:.*VIC
&gt; ! $<A HREF="mailto:ENV_TO@localhost">ENV_TO@localhost</A>
&gt; 
&gt; :2:
&gt; * ^To:.*NSW
&gt; ! $<A HREF="mailto:ENV_TO@localhost">ENV_TO@localhost</A>
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; I realise that I obviously have a lot to learn about Procmail recipes but
&gt; the clock is ticking and
&gt; so far all I can find in the manpages/websites is vagues bits that allude
&gt; to seperate elements
&gt; of what I want to accomplish.
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried adding the following (in the hope of catching the "user
&gt; unknown" jobs)
&gt; but so far it keeps going to dead.letter:
&gt; ----------------------------------
&gt; :2E:
&gt; /var/spool/mail/master
&gt; ----------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Help.....please.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
