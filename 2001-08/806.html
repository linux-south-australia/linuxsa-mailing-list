&gt; I think the Register is on the right track. PC's for Kids needs to 
&gt; realise that Linux is not a second-best alternative. If they take a 
&gt; look at the K-12 Linux project they can see that there is a wealth of 
&gt; stuff available and they are using it down as low as kindergarten age 
&gt; so it is not difficult to teach.
&gt; 
&gt; The comment on Mike's Page intrigues me. Is such a license available 
&gt; down under?
&gt; "In the United Kingdom, and possibly in other countries, computer-
&gt; recycling charities can obtain a refurbishment licence from Microsoft 
&gt; for approximately $US500 per year.
&gt; 

On a related subject, I recently saw this item (in spanish language)
about the Simputer in India:
<A HREF="http://es.news.yahoo.com/010820/44/18q6k.html">http://es.news.yahoo.com/010820/44/18q6k.html</A>

This was mentioned in various places a few months ago.
But the recent news in this item says:
-	The Simputer will be launched in November.
-	It will sell for US$200.
-	It will use linux.
-	"Slightly larger than a Palm Pilot, it can
	be connected to the Internet and has
	easy-to-use applications, intended principally
	for the rural populations of India.
	They are hoping to sell around 100,000 units
	in the first year."

It seems like this Simputer comes in at about the
same range of cost as an Australian PC loaded up with
Windows and packaged and posted overseas.
And I imagine that the small-sized Simputer would use
less power too, which might be a good thing in a
country in which electric power is a luxury.
(Even in the capital of Vietnam a couple of years ago,
I found that the power would fail for several hours a
day. Imagine what the Vietnamese or East Timorese
outback must be like!)

Just another little comment on this subject...
In 1998, I visited Hanoi with the intention of setting up
one or more internet cafes - because I had seen none there
in 1997. Little did I know that the govt had liberalised
the internet in the meantime. When I got there, I saw
internet cafes wherever I looked. When I asked one cafe
without Internet whether they would like me to buy them
a PC to get them started as an Internet cafe (in my
200 words of vietnamese), they answered in good english
that they had heaps of money and they were thinking of
setting up internet, but they were just worried about
the police wanting a cut of the action.
Not only that, at one local internet cafe, I saw a
scanner which was better than any I have ever used,
and the operators were faster on a PC than anyone I have
ever seen.

This made me realise how difficult it is for a foreigner
to come into a poor country and do something useful.
I'm not at all certain, in fact, that it would be all
that well appreciated in East Timor to be sent a truck-full
of old PC junk with DOS and windows 3.1.
It wouldn't surprise me a bit if the locals are already
using 1 GHz computers with 20 GByte drives and
a recent version of linux already.

I'm not saying that all poor countries have deluxe computing
networks at home like us. But I think it's always good to
check out the local situation. Some "poor" countries to
our north are more technologically advanced than us!

Just some thoughts in passing....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
