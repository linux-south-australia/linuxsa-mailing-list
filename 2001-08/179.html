&gt;If anyone out there has the right worm-writing skills, they
&gt;could do the world a big favour!

Given that the current media climate for worm-authors, benevolent or not, is
a hostile one, this would probably be an unwise move.

If the notion of fixing a security hole with a security exploit gets the
better of your judgement, there's still a few hurdles to cross. Fixing the
worm not only involves applying a patch, but it also requires installing a
'current' service pack from MS. With service packs being around 70mb in
size, it's going difficult to propogate, and create bigger problems than the
original worm. It might make a nice MS-DDOS attack as a side-effect.

This can break older applications and make otherwise stable systems very
flaky if history teaches us anything. Unfortunately, we must do it Bill's
way or not at all, so fixing older systems isn't possible according to MS.

The alternative is to simply delete idq.dll, or remove the .ida mapping.
Either of these solutions could break someone's application, making them
rather upset at the fix author. It's then a lot easier to cast the blame at
the individual instead of at the monolithic company that wrote the software
in the first place.
