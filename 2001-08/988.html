Normally I keep my machine on all the time, but the last
week or so I have been turning it off at night (less noise
for when I sleep).  Yesterday morning I turned it on, waited
for it to boot as normal, except its attempt to mount local
filesystems failed in a rather scary manner.  Here are the 
messages I get:

/etc/init.d/rcS: line 12:   60 Segmentation fault    mount -avt nonfs,noproc,nosmbfs


At about the time these errors came up, my hard drive made some funny
noises (usually it is rather quiet).  It sounded sort of like:

sca-sca-sca-sca  short pause  sca-sca-sca-sca

and that was it.

After this error it does continue to try and boot, but has lots of errors
along the way.  It does get there eventually, but has only the / partition
and /usr mounted.  Ie, /home, /var, /tmp and /usr/local are not mounted.

So, I want to know --- is this a problem with my hard drive?  Or is it
a software problem?

The drive itself is only about a year old.  It is an IBM 15Gig ATA100 
7200rpm drive.  I had been lead to believe that the IBMs were very
reliable so I will be rather surprised if it is indeed a drive hardware
problem.

I am runing LVM 0.8final and reiserfs under a 2.4.0-test9 kernel (I
think anyway).

Any ideas about what I should do now?  I have backups of some of my
important stuff on the drive, but there is stuff on the /home partition
that I'd prefer not to lose if I can avoid it.

Cheers,

Mark.
