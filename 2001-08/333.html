If you're running RH7.1 it should be directly capable of mounting your 
Windows paritions and accessing the files.

As root, try executing the following:
 &gt;&gt;mount -t vfat /dev/hdaX /mnt/winme"

where X is the partition number, and /mnt/winme is an empty directory 
you've created somewhere.  That shuld mount your win partition until you 
unmount it or reboot. You might need to replace hda with hdb, hdc or 
hdd, depending on what disk you've got winme installed on. (I'd go for 
the first one so hda is prolly the right choice).

For a more permanent solution, add lines similar to the following to 
/etc/fstab

"/dev/hda5    /mnt/win/d    vfat        0 0"

(without the quotes).

That should allow you to use your Windows files under Linux, just like 
they were on a Linux paritition.  Samba is a whole other story, and you 
only need that if you're running Win4Lin, VMWare, or something 
equivalent.  VMWare used to set up its own Samba server for you when you 
installed it, but I'm not sure how Win4Lin works as I haven't used it 
(anyone know if they still do 30 day trial licenses because I'm not 
paying good $$$ if it's no good).  Samba isn't too hard to set up if you 
want to do a bodge job and aren't too worried about security.  If you're 
worried about security you have to spend a bit of time to get it right, 
but again it's not hard, just time consuming.  It comes with piles of 
Docco that you just read and follow.  The smb.conf file is pretty well 
commented and a good place to start.

As for DirectX, Wine supports a lot of DirectX calls now.  It will run a 
lot of commercial Windows games under Linux with no hassle.  Most PC 
emulators (win4lin and VMWare) can't do DirectX because DirectX is a 
layer that expects to talk directly to hardware, and this isn't really 
possible through the emulator, and then the X-server.

Hope this helps some.

Cheers,
Adam
