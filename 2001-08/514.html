Hi all,

I have a major headache on my hands with a procmailrc setup.
For anyone who just stopped reading and is already typing "RTFM", please 
feel free
to include some _useful_ FM's because I have looked but as yet cannot find 
a single recipe
that is trying to do what I need ;-)

The Scenario:
I have a client who loves his NT mailserver (which lives on their LAN, 
running off a PPP link) and
has up till now maintained all their addresses there. The system had with 
his old ISP was that
they received all of his domains mail on a sigle mailbox (via an 
@domain.com "virtusertable" referrence).
Once POP3ed to the NT machine, the mailserver software (FTgate I think) 
would sift it based on the
"To:" addresses and shuffle it off to local Exchange mailboxes. Nice and 
simple, I know ;-)
However, there are other offices for this company, and they all had to have 
mailboxes with their
local ISP's so that the FTgate could bounce mail for their aliases off to 
these external addresses.
This meant that all this mail (not bound for the Exchange accounts) was 
transfered down their PPP
link, played with by the NT machine and then sent back out the link to 
various other ISP's.

Now, they have come to my company requesting a Linux server (that we farm 
for them) which can run
their WWW and MAIL services. The web stuff was a no-brainer, but the mail 
is a messy situation.

The scenario I have suggested to the client was to create POP3 boxes for 
all of these external offices'
staff on the Linux mailserver (which is the official MX pref for their 
domain) and all other mail should go
into a single POP3 box for the FTgate to check and disect. Basic idea was 
to minimise all the needless
mail traffic their dialup was suffering from.

The client promised me that all the external sites addresses (previously 
redirected by FTgate) were
running off aliases that always had an identifying prefix. EG: 
<A HREF="mailto:NSW.joe@domain.com">NSW.joe@domain.com</A>, <A HREF="mailto:NSW.mary@domain.com">NSW.mary@domain.com</A>,
<A HREF="mailto:VIC.sales@domain.com.">VIC.sales@domain.com.</A> So I did plan it assuming that there would some way 
of filtering them.

ANYWAY, the solution I used was to setup the exact same "virtusertable" 
entry they used to have
(pointing to a single mailbox, let's call it "master") and a .procmailrc 
(in /home/master) that would catch
any mail with a "To:" field that started with the relevant prefixes and 
re-send them locally to "<A HREF="mailto:USER@localhost">USER@localhost</A>"
(which bypassed the "virtusertable" and was picked up by the entries in 
/etc/aliases for each real user).

The Problem:
It worked great for a while but now he is adding all kinds of addresses to 
the Linux server and not all of
them have prefixes that I am filtering (so they end up on his FTgate 
wondering were to go next).
Worse, not all of the existingly known "<A HREF="mailto:NSW.foo@domain.com">NSW.foo@domain.com</A>" addresses have 
been re-created on
the Linux server (so they do get filtered but come up as "user unknown" and 
there is an ever-growing
"dead-letter" file as a result).

&lt;quick thankyou to anyone still reading&gt;

My existing config/recipe is:

/etc/mail/virtusertable:
-----------------------------------------------
@foo.com.au        master+%1
-----------------------------------------------

AND

/home/master/.procmailrc:
----------------------------------------------------------
DOMAIN=foo.com.au
ENV_TO=$1

:0f
* ENV_TO ?? .
| formail -i "X-Envelope-To: "$ENV_TO@$DOMAIN
:0fE
| formail -i "X-Envelope-To: UNKNOWN"

:1:
* ^To:.*VIC
! $<A HREF="mailto:ENV_TO@localhost">ENV_TO@localhost</A>

:2:
* ^To:.*NSW
! $<A HREF="mailto:ENV_TO@localhost">ENV_TO@localhost</A>
------------------------------------------------------------


I realise that I obviously have a lot to learn about Procmail recipes but 
the clock is ticking and
so far all I can find in the manpages/websites is vagues bits that allude 
to seperate elements
of what I want to accomplish.

I have tried adding the following (in the hope of catching the "user 
unknown" jobs)
but so far it keeps going to dead.letter:
----------------------------------
:2E:
/var/spool/mail/master
----------------------------------

Help.....please.

Cheers,
-Daniel
