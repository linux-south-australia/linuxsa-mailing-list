Word of Advice: You might want to change your subject line in
your post "Linux-based replacement for Exchange" or similar, 
just "Exchange Server" seems like your asking for help on it, 
not how to replace it, of course no-one starts any flame wars
about such trivial things now do they......... ;o)

Anyway......

&gt;Anybody know if there is an exchange server replacement for 
&gt;linux?  we've
&gt;got a large number of exchange servers and we're wondering if 
&gt;there is a
&gt;linux (free of course) version that could plug in with x400 / directory
&gt;replication etc etc...

HP Openmail is pretty much a plugin replacement for Exchange,
version 7 is about according to their page

we tested it when we were looking for mail server software
last year, but the cost was the drawback for us, not quite
as expensive as Exchange, but still out of our budget range,
thats why we went for Teamware Office, mainly for the mail
& calendar features
we're using it purely for the calendar at the moment, kicks
serious butt over Outlook's one (user's opinions, not mine,
i hardly use my calendar...........)

just depends how many of the current features of Exchange 
you are using & whether all the users will string u up in 
the city centre if they can't use Outlook any more (thats
if u went for a different solution than Openmail)

Apparently Bynari's Insight Server is pretty good too &lt;goes off
to check for link........&gt; it was still in beta when we were
looking around, but apparently that supports most of Outlooks
functionality, so that could be an option for u, it can talk
to existing Exchange servers or run standalone AFAIK, havent
followed it up because we already shelled out for Teamware
