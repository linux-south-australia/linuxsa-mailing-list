&gt; Dude, I used to be a printf junkie

&gt; until I started writing image

&gt; of loops makes it quite difficult to pinpoint exactly what the problem
&gt; is with printf debugging.

I agree.  It's different horses for different courses; I like to use
printf() because it makes me think more about the problem, which some
people can do with a debugger.  Stuck inside a triple-nested loop with
a printf at the inner most wouldn't be fun, however.  Whenever I fire
up gdb, I usually have to spend more time acquainting myself with its
interface than solving the problem at hand, which is a shortcoming on
my part (or maybe not - I like to think spending less time on the
debugger is a good thing[1]).  I think this all stems from teaching
first and second year students C (a while ago), who write and debug
in a complete different fashion to me (ie, gobs of code, then long
hours randomly jumping about with the debugger).

&gt; DDD looked promising for what we wanted to do so I was looking at that.

Good for you.  I have no qualms with that, provided you don't take
my printf() away from me. :-)

&gt; I was also after other suggestions for
&gt; debuggers to use, as work is starting to make a switch to Linux for a
&gt; lot of development stations.

As a (potential) Linux success story, maybe you could post what
your work does at a later stage?

is what I used to code in several hours[2].  I'm a tad rusty (not Rusty).
