BUT ...
We are not talking on this thread about M$ compatibility in the
abstract, but in the concrete situation of PCs for Kids.

As I understand it, they are supplying obsolete low-end PCs to kids who
otherwise would have none, and need software to suit PCsforKids and the
client's limited budgets.

"If you ain't got the money or the physical resources you had better
accept a compromise."  (c) BA 2001

I think it is close to immoral to put disadvantaged people onto the
costly commercial M$ upgrade bandwagon, or INSIST on some
illusory perfectly compatible alternative when a FREE and entirely
suitable option is available.
Abiword isn't M$Word, but it is usable, getting better all the time,
and FREE.  Gnumeric is better than Excel IMHO and again is FREE.
Linux and FreeBSD are FREE.  And so on ...
Linux, FreeBSD and their apps are also FREEly upgradable, though
admittedly that does require Internet access or some kind person who
has and who will downlaod for you.

The other point is the one you made about our missionary duty.  We
should be promoting Open Source, Free Software and the philosophy that
goes with it.  PCsforKids has a golden opportunity to do this.
