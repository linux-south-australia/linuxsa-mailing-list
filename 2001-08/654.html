&gt; Funny actually, because I was just at that site last week checking out that
&gt; hidden-files thing.
&gt; It finally explains the snowballing effect that occurs on old Windoze
&gt; installations' drive usage.
&gt; That CONTENT.IE5 dir just gets bigger and bigger with time.
&gt; 
&gt; I now have a couple of extra lines in my autoexec.bat at home that nuke the
&gt; thing
&gt; every time I boot up. Just "attrib -s -h -r" the dir and deltree the
&gt; contents every bootup.
&gt; 
&gt; It makes for interesting reading the first time you go and read it  ;-)
&gt; It had every bit of browsing history since install in mine (not that it
&gt; amounted to much
&gt; since I only exer use IE to check browser-compatibility of some pages/sites
&gt; I build).
&gt; 
&gt; However, me thinks the stuff about Outlook Express was a bit paranoid (they
&gt; basically
&gt; tell you to wipe your mbx files......not much of solution really). I use
&gt; Eudora so it wasn't
&gt; a concern either way.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

Did you all know about the logs kept by Win95B and IE3?
I discovered this a few years ago when searching my system.

The logging included with IE5 is a more sophisticated 
method of content logging than the original.

Try this. 

1. Get a machine with Win95B and IE3 and browse some 
   sites.

2. Open the search window and search for *.* in the 
   windows history folder not temporary internet
  (I think, long time since I did this last :)

3. There should be 2 files with no name, icon
   or extension. You cannot double click, drag drop, etc..
   these files at all. the only way to see what
   is in them is to drop to DOS and change to the 
   \windows\history folder and type them.

   NOTE **This cannot be a windows command shell**
   
   you MUST hit F8 on bootup and select command prompt
   or shutdown windows into MS-DOS mode, else 
   windows will stop you from viewing the file
   contents 

   The file names are mm256.dat and 
   mm2048.dat. These files keep a data log of the web
   sites you have visited in the past with IE3.

**Note this information is practically useless to you all though
  cause everyone here uses linux :)
