*checks on home box*

Nope, still going strong ;) A few hundred code red packets too, according to
the logs.
Luckily no one has found a way to do transparent proxying of IRC DCC
sessions! (yet.. it could be possible with some serious packet analysis i
guess, but isn't worth the cost)

Hey, I'm thinking of posting all my logs of dropped/rejected packets to
telstra on CD, and saying "I shouldn't have to pay for this traffic".. Do
you think I've got even the proverbial snowflake's chance of getting
anywhere?
