Access has a tight integration between the Access programming
environment and the database.  In Linux those are very
distinct items.

The programming environment closest to Access is Kylix.
If you use it to develop GPL-licensed programs then it
is free (beer).

Kylix is quite new, so you are probably better asking
a Windows' Delphi user group that has tried out Kylix
as to its pros and cons.  Apparently the small differences
between Kylix and Delphi will disappear over time, allowing
application portability a tthe source code level.  Even
now apparently porting code is straight-forward.

Most programming environments in the Linux world use
the web as the user interface and languages like PHP
and Perl to provide the logic between the database and
the HTML.

This isn't as much work as it first appears, especially
with the later versions of PHP.  The usual technique
is to output fairly basic HTML and use CSS style sheets
to pretty the display.

The real advantages of Perl don't kick in until you
want to do *two* things, say put SNMP network events
into a SQL database.  Then the huge collection of
Perl modules massively reduces the amount of code
that needs to be written.

As for databases, Linux runs every SQL database, apart
from the one from Microsoft.  The free (freedom) ones
used commonly are Postgres and MySQL.  If you need
something of industrial strength then last year SAP
GPLed SAPDB; a variant of ADABAS D, a long-established
mainframe database.

You might want to look for a database with replication,
then you can have multiple computers running the
orienteering application and sync them together at
the end of the event.

Regards,
Glen
