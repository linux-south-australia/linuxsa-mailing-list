&gt;  &gt; &gt; We're getting a lot more than that.  Maybe you don't have as high 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; a density of IIS servers on your network &lt;shrug&gt;
&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The rate is almost certainly determined by the number of IP
&gt;  &gt; addresses you have exposed to the net, not the bit-rate
&gt;  &gt; of the pipe.
&gt;  
&gt; Consider the case of a customer with a NAT gateway with a static mapping
&gt; on port 80 pointing to an IIS server on 192.168.x.x.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's propose that that IIS server gets infested by a CodeRed worm 
&gt; on the Internet, through the NAT gateway.  So it'll start merrily
&gt; spamming the crap out of the entire Internet -- Including that portion
&gt; of the entire Internet that shares the first 16 bits of its IP address,
&gt; which is 192.168.x.y.
&gt; 

Mark, are you sure about this? That makes the 192.168.x.x 'private',
non-routable schema very broken. For instance, how would I route a packet
on port 80 over the internet to 'your' 192.168.1.1 web server rather than
Alan's or whoever?

Nope, I don't think so. Certainly, webservers in your own 192.168.x.x
network are attackable by Code red on an internal or gateway webserver,
but not to other private networks.

Looking at my own network, which has nat, and 2 web servers, 1 on the
gateway and one within, I see 145 code red attacks since Sunday on the
gateway and a clean zero on the internal server.

If my boxes were IIs, and attackable, I'd expect the internal server to be
infected from the gateway once it was infected.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; So, very quickly, all the *other* IIS
servers, which aren't
publically &gt; accessible to The Internet at large, also get infested.  
&gt; 
&gt; ... then they start spamming the crap out of the 'net as well... through
&gt; the NAT gateway.
&gt; 
&gt; So the NAT gateway is now handling outbound HTTP requests originating
&gt; from more than one IIS server:  The volume of outbound probes from that
&gt; single IP address will be double the normal volume of a CodeRed system.
&gt; 
&gt; Or, for an internal network with N IIS servers, the NAT gateway's outbound
&gt; data flow will be N x (normal bitrate for one CodeRed server).
&gt; 
&gt; That's how single IP addresses can end up emitting tens of megabits per
&gt; second worth of CodeRed probes, in the realm of several thousand probes
&gt; per second.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; I'm talking about incoming probes here.
&gt;  &gt; Maybe Mark's higher rate than 100 /second is outgoing probes?
&gt;  
&gt; Yes.  I don't care too much about incoming probes (they'll all fail,
&gt; because everyone has patched IIS, right?  Arrrgh! :-)
