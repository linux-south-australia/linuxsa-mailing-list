&gt; Although I've never tried to buy a preinstalled linux
&gt; system, it seems to me that you usually will want to
&gt; do a lot of configuration, re-installation etc.
&gt; during the life of any machine, and it's easier to
&gt; install and configure linux yourself than to tell
&gt; someone else what you want on it.

Having done a fair bit of installation of Linux on
the AARNet servers (two in most states, three in some),
no.

You want Linux on the machine, even if it isn't set
up exactly as you'd like.  You can configure or
reinstall from there.  And you can do that without
physical access to the machine.

If the box ships with Windows or no OS then you are
stuffed as far as remote deployment goes.  If it
has Linux you can get the colo site to configure
enough of the remote console to get it answering
the modem from single user mode.  From there you
can configure.  If you get them to leave a blank
floppy in the drive you can even remotely reinstall
or upgrade.

&gt; 1.      People trying to put linux on really wierd
&gt;         hardware or trying to make linux do really
&gt;         wierd, off-beat thing, or

If Linux comes with the box then you know the hardware
works with Linux, somehow.

&gt; In case 1, you'd much rather know what is going onto
&gt; your machine, so that you can fix it when it goes wrong.

Alternatively, you might simply want to copy the
/etc/X11/XFree86Config that the vendor supplied.
Similarly for other magic files.  No intimate
knowledge of the hardware needed, although Dell
do provide very good hardware doco.

&gt; The skills required for installation and initial
&gt; configuration are closely related to the skills required
&gt; for ongoing maintenance. So if the user can't do one,
&gt; how can they do the other?

Not at all.  You want to configure ongoing maintenance
using something like autorpm so that you touch only
one machine to maintain all of your machines.  Testing
an RPM and dropping it into the distribution directory
doesn't require a huge amount of skill.

&gt; Saying "Dell installed my OS." is not likely to
&gt; be at all helpful.

Yes it is, because you can then ask Dell tech support.
And to be fair to Dell, their installation of Red Hat
Linux 7.1 is very bog-standard.

&gt; Bundling is bad.

Red Hat Linux from Dell is a zero-price option, so you
save nothing by going for the bare PC.

Glen
