&gt;I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on Debian?
&gt;
&gt;I have been using redhat and mandrake(dual boot win95) for about a year and 
&gt;have recently picked up a copy of Debian with the 2.4.3 kernel, the release 
&gt;is 2.2r2 (potato)
&gt;
&gt;Being reasonably new to Linux any advice before I start would be much 
&gt;appreciated
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Rich 

A few days ago I cast my eyes over the offerings at a newsagent.  What
did I see? why its Tux on the cover of the latest Linux Pocketbook!
What really caught my attention was the sub-heading DEBIAN and
kernel 2.4 and KDE.  These things together caused alarm bells to ring.
The last time I visited the Debian web site, it was revealed that kernel
2.4 would not be included until the next major release: 2.3 or 3.0.
What's more, KDE was listed on the feature list but Debian has been
heavily into Gnome - at least on my current release, 2.2r0.  That would
probably be worth the $19.95, to put Gnome and KDE on my machine and
do a showdown to see which I liked best.  However, I'm not one to do
impulse purchases so I just completed a quick read of the cover and 
headed home to check a few things on the web.  The quick read revealed
that patches to some of the earlier Pocketbook distros were included.
This suggested some sort of third party repackaging.

Later that day I surfed to a couple of Ozzy Linux sites to see if I
could find more info on the distro at the Newsagent.  Instead I
discovered that Debian was at 2.2r3, still with kernel 2.2 and no
KDE on the feature list.  Looks as if the Pocketbook distro is a
third party product.  That's not to say that its a bad or a good
thing, I'm still tempted to use it to get a copy of KDE.  

An intersting consequence is that any info that Rich has been given
on this list may be inaccurate (assuming that my inference on the
origin of Rich's CD is right).  If I understand the Pocketbook concept,
its aimed at newbies and if I were making a custom Debian CD, the
installation and package manager would be the first thing I'd change.

The advice on Debian provided by the other posters is consistent with
my experience.  Debian is not as easy to install as the others but it
is more powerfull in many ways.  Read and/or print the installation
instructions and be carfull through the first steps of format / 
partition / base system / dselect.  Once apt-get can be started, it
gets easier.  

Good luck,
