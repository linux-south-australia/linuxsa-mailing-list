Glen,

I agree with all of your points.
Obviously one sock doesn't fit all.
I.e. self-installation might not be ideal for many people.

In my post, I almost mentioned that as the number of machines
goes up, the Dell pre-installation option is going to look more
and more attractive. The same goes for the value of your time:
the more valuable (and scarce) your time is, the more attractive
will be the Dell option.

In my case personally, even if linux was installed on my machines,
the first thing I would do would be to install a different OS,
build a new kernel or two, download various user-space software and
install it, etc. etc.
That's partly because I assume that Dell would provide RedHat only,
and I'm trying to do my bit to help reduce the RedHat linux monoculture
- I don't want to find that I'm held captive to the
tools of one US distribution when there are another 20-30 mainstream
linux distributions out there, not to mention the zillions of
minor distributions.

But then...  I refuse to learn the details of how my car works
or learn anything more than the minimum about how to fix it.
I know (after years of trial and error) where the water goes in and where
the oils go in. And I know now what most of the lights and buttons on
the dashboard mean. 
Some people might take the same attitude to computers.
Obviously you're not one of them, but I guess that for the mass
market, pre-installation might not be so bad.

I'd still say that if someone is getting linux for a personal
workstation, and they're going to use that as their main
development machine, day in, day out, then probably they would
want to have the "installation experience" so that they
will get a deeper understanding of what they're doing.

It's entirely possible, of course, that Dell was providing
pre-installed linux as a bargaining ploy with MS.
I know that the major PC distributors saw AMD in a similar light,
as a way to get better terms from Intel. Every time they
had discussions with AMD, Intel improved its terms.
For all we know, Dell might have not the slightest interest
in the linux customer. We may be mere bargaining chips to them.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
