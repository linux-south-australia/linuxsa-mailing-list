Hi,

I've been playing with grub recently as lilo seems to be doing something
real wierd with my ami-megaraid adaptor. That wierdness aside, this is
my prob:

sda - symbios scsi card
sdb - ami megaraid.

I want to pull the only drive off the symbios (the current boot drive)
and boot in to linux from the megaraid. Problem is, its an inbuild
symbios, and has no option to disable it. Thus, I am in the situation
where I need to install grub on to /dev/sdb in such a way that when its
rebooted and comes up as /dev/sda instead, it just deals with it and
keeps going. This should be possible as grub supposedly reads the
filesystem, and that the partitioning and files are identical on both
drives. However grub gets real confused when a scsi chain dissapears and
it appears elsewhere. I have read the how-to and looked around the web,
and I cant work out how to do this. 

Has anyone tried anything similar and worked out a way to make it work?
Grub either says "GRUB" and nothing else, or "GRUB cannot load
stage2[1]" depending on what way I install it.

Ant

[1] or equivalent, its not in front of me right now
