&gt; Using MDK 8 (or 7.2 if there is a difference for this). i can't find
&gt; the location of the script which is used for ipchains. setting the
&gt; rules.  mandrake comes with a utility for config of the firewall but
&gt; its very simple and not very customisable.

I'm not sure about mandrake, I don't use it, but I understand that it
is very similar to RedHat. Even if this doesn't help you it is worth
knowing for Redhat.

For RH versions 7.0 and below, once you have setup your ipchains the
way that you like them, you can run a programme called
'ipchains-save'. This dumps the necessary ipchains commands to stout,
that would need to be used to build your current firewall
configuration.

Using it like this... 'ipchains-save &gt; /etc/sysconfig/ipchains' will
save your current config to the correct file that
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipchains' uses on startup.

(Also note that there is a symlink in '/etc' called 'init.d' to
'/etc/rc.d/init.d', so for all those rc.d commands you can just use
'/etc/init.d/stuff'.)

...anyway.

If you wan't to restore ipchains rules manually you can use
ipchains-restore and feed it the /etc/sysconfig/ipchains file from
stdin. Alternatively '/etc/init.d/ipchains restart' will do the trick.

For redhat 7.1 you can use a utility in 'setup' called 'firewall
configuration'. This is quite neat and allows you to select from a few
default policies. It understands the idea of 'safe' and 'hostile'
interfaces and it will also take care of punching holes for name
servers using the ifup-post scripts.

This is another reason why I'm always going on about removing stuff
from rc.local. If you use the ifup and ifdown scripts for interface
management, and the '/etc/init.d scripts for firewall, daemon,
networking, etc management, you won't break stuff, other software will
work with your configurations, and you can upgrade easily.

There's heaps more about all this on redhat's web site.

Cheers

Alex!
