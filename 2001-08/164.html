Since many of you are interested in Internet security issues,
this isn't too far off-topic...


In the last hour, I've noticed the sudden appearance of a new
variant of the Code Red worm.
This one uses X instead of N:
(The binary codes are unchanged.)

203.248.237.42 - - [04/Aug/2001:22:03:38 +0930] "GET /default.ida?XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u6858%ucbd3%u7801%u9090%u9090%u8190%u00c3%u0003%u8b00%u531b%u53ff%u0078%u0000%u00=a  HTTP/1.0" 404 284 "-" 

The other difference is that the IP address are predominantly
in the set 203.x.y.z, which includes many Australian IP addresses,
but these probes are coming from Taiwan, South Korea, China etc.

The original Code Red worm was programmed to only infect
sites with the language set to to English.
It looks like this one is targetting Chinese-langauge sites maybe.
Or maybe a small language set which includes Chinese and Korean.

The original 250,000 sites or 150,000 or whatever were
constrained by their language-specificity.
But now the "susceptible" base has broadened.
This new one behaves differently too.
It sometimes makes two probes from the same web server.

The overall rate is still about 1.5 probes per IP address per hour.

I can't see any info about this on the net.
Does anyone have a good web address for getting up-to-the-minute
info on this sort of thing?
The NIPC site has nothing.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. The annoying thing about Code Red is that there is no obvious
way of preventing bandwidth wastage.
For my little site, I estimate the cost will go up by
A$15 per year if Code Red stays at the same level.
That's equal to 6 post-GST cappuccinos.
