&gt; &gt; Most linuxSA members attending meetings dress like unemployed
&gt; &gt; hobos off the street. (I'm sure there's a good reason for this.)
&gt; &gt; Some people actually wear a suit - they're the unlucky ones who
&gt; &gt; have paying jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a good paying job and I dress casual - both to LinuxSA and to
&gt; work.  Why spend money on suits when your employer doesn't care, it
&gt; doesn't affect the code I churn out, and I can spend that extra cash on
&gt; bandwidth and hardware? :-)

I'd like to add comment as well. Im probably the worst offender,
although I have only been to a couple of linux sa meets. I dress that
way because I choose to. You may have seen me in black jeans, with a
metal t-shirt on and long hair, but thats the way I like it (I dont even
get in to a lot of drinking establishments like it). By day I have a
paying linux job (this one) and pretend to be all business like :) I
just dont dress that way if I can help it because, well, I like being
true to myself.
