I have been speaking to somebody from our DHS (Dept Human Services) 
about how to put Linux and Star Office onto older machines that they 
would then give to charities etc. They were as worried as the rest of 
us about the cost and licensing problems when loading Microsoft 
products onto the donation machines. Apparently the majority of their 
Windows software is OEM.

My suggestion to match their specifications of - 
CPU:   Min 200 MMX processor
RAM:   64 Meg
Drive: 1.2 G and up

 - is for them to use Red Hat 6.2 or 7.1 and probably the KDE manager. 
I also suggested Star Office so they can retain a high degree of 
compatibility with what is available in the outside world.

Through our community computer project [SNNN] I have offered to build 
up a machine for them to demo to others in their branch. They sent a 
machine to me and I am already working on the install with RH 7.1. As I 
have to hand it back early next week your comments and suggestions 
welcomed.

Cheers, Ian.
