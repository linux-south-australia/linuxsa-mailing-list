&gt; It's not either is it?  I have a O(n^2) solution:

which is technically incorrect, if you are really looking for the _most_
equal distribution between two piles...

&gt;   - sort by file size, largest to smallest.  This is O(n*log2(n)).
&gt;
&gt;   - place files on alternating piles, unless difference between
&gt;     the size of the two piles is greater than the size of the file
&gt;     in hand.   That's n to traverse the pile, and n occassions
&gt;     of counting two piles, upper bound 2n.  Resulting in upper
&gt;     bound of n+2n^2 which is O(n^2).

I'm sure that is not the best possible fit solution... now I have to
demonstrate why...

hmmm

try with this list of files...

20
19
18
17

20 18

19 17

but this is WRONG! :)

I'm sure that you could extrapolate that to some other long weird list that
is the pathological case for this method... basically, your method garantees
that the difference between the piles will be less than half the size of the
last one... actually no... it won't even do that... consider:


20
20
15
14
10
1


gives:

20 15 10

20 14 1


which is a difference of 10!


it should be:

20 20

15 14 10 1

for a difference of 0.


I'm pretty sure this demonstrates a specific pathological case, and I
personally can see no simple algorithm for getting the perfect
distribution...

&gt; Over the long term, O(n^2) dominates other orders of magnitude.
&gt; In any case the upper bound is nowhere near NP-complete.

I reckon it is, if you desire the _best_ solution... (although, not
recalling what NP-complete means exactly, I can't garantee that... I could
say that there would be an algorithm that is O(N!), I think -- select all
combinations of N/2 of them, then (n/2)-1 of them, then (n/2)-3 etc... sort
these int &gt; totalsize/2 and &lt; totalsize/2, stop if you get = totalsize/2,
otherwise go through them all, and then pick the closest...

I'm sure there's a far more elegant way of expressing that, and I'm also
sure n! is wrong, somehow... but I'm also sure it demonstrates that this is
not an N^2 problem...
