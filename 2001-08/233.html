Patching an NT4 Box is a simple matter of installing Service Pack 6, plus a
single hotfix...  Took me two hours to download the hotfix and install on
our 5 NT4 servers here (two reboots each, so about 5-10 minutes per machine
of downtime is required).  

A rough estimate for a Linux conversion would be a day or two to install
Linux on all the machines, and a few months to rewrite all of our software
which runs on NT from scratch.

Based on the above, is it cheaper (time IS money after all) for us to change
to Linux?  I don't think so.  Would I rather run Linux?  ABSOLUTELY!  In
fact I used my Linux boxes to confirm that it was indeed Code Red that was
crashing my NT machines before I patched them.  We run 2 linux boxen in
conjunction with our 5 NT machines.  We use Linux where we can, and NT where
we can't (or don't know how).

I'm all in favour of Linux, but to suggest that conversion to Linux is
cheaper than patching NT for Code Red is absurd!  Our situation probably
isn't that much different to most people who serve up mostly dynamic
content.  If you're only ever serving up static stuff, than a switch to
Linux/Apache could be handled fairly easily.  But when you're serving
dynamic content through ASP, then you've got a lot of re-coding to do!

Jim.

PS: On our servers, the SP6 and hotfix didn't break anything, and no
problems with codered since.  YMMV.

It would probably cost less to change every MS computer over to a
linux-variant machine rather than patch all those MS machines that are going
ballistic with code red I/II packets.

Then i would not be stuck with using MS based software, as everyone would be
using linux. :)
But... when i leave school, i shall change completely to linux, as i will
have more time then.



&gt; The backdoor would allow someone to 'auto update' the worm too..
&gt; It'll be interesting to see what will come out next, piggybacking upon the
&gt; already-opened backdoor.
