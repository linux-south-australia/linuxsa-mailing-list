&gt; No, but I have been looking at serial-based installs of Linux and other

OK. I've found that the remote-serial-HOWTO currently sucks.

I'm updating it with stacks of info from an AARNet internal
procedure.

Can I suggest that we then add a new section summarising
our serial-install experiences?

&gt; You shouldn't need to re-create the floppy from scratch, but you will need
&gt; to modify it. The kernel on the floppy is a fairly generic one, so you can
&gt; quite safely guess the config and create a working one with serial console
&gt; support.

I wonder how I can find out what the floopy kernel's config is -- as
the Red Hat standard kernel already supports serial console.

Anyone know or do I need to go looking?

&gt; You then need to add the serial console kernel options to the syslinux.cfg
&gt; file on the floppy (sorry, can't recall what they are, but I'm guessing
&gt; you already know what's necessary there).

Yep, I can figure that one out.

&gt; I'm not sure how you'd go doing the install over a modem. Most PC BIOSs
&gt; tend to cause modems to hang up on boot and the same might occur when
&gt; the linux kernel initialises the serial ports. I haven't done much with
&gt; this.

They drop DTR which then hangs up the modem.  You actually
want this to happen, otherwise when the user logs out the
modem call isn't cleared.  The alternative leads to tricky
situations where the console is waiting for someone to log
in but the modem is still holding up an old call.  This
isn't desirable behaviour on your Command Line of Last
Resort.
