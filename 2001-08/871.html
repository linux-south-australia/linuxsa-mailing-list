&gt;&gt;I now find myself in the position of having to do a re-install, 
&gt;&gt;because apt-get -f dist-upgrade, or apt-get upgrade, etc, after having 
&gt;&gt;got over 120MB of packages from ftp.au.debian.org, always fails trying 
&gt;&gt;to upgrade gnotepad+.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; With what error? What's it looking for or failing on? Are you running
&gt; unstable, testing, or stable?

Well. I was running Potato, trying to upgrade to Woody. Its on the back 
burner now :-)

&gt; I've been using debian for nearly two years, and I've generally found 
&gt; that the unstable distribution goes through periods of being, well, 
&gt; unstable. Fortunately, the rest of the time everything just _works_.

Yes, but it wasn't giving me good error messages etc ...

&gt;&gt;I also can't use man, and X will not start, because it can't find the 
&gt;&gt;fixed font, and so on.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Interesting.

&gt; Why can't you use man?

Well, I was in the middle of an upgrade. apt-get had got lots of things, 
and was applying them, but it screwed up. Once I deleted gnotepad+, 
ap-get was happy to upgrade the rest, and man started working again. Of 
course, I had to fix the libdb thing.

&gt; What xfont* packages do you have installed? I've got "xfonts-scalable",
&gt; "xfonts-base", and "xfonts-75dpi".

This turned out to be a mixture of XFree86 3.3.6 stuff and XFree86 4.0.3 
stuff ...

How, however, X just won't display anything.  It starts, but shows me a 
blank screen. However, lots of X things are running.
