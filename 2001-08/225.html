Ah, interesting pseudo-code there, but definately not the real source.
I wonder who made it up? Perhaps someone looking to gain some "street cred"
by having the supposed "original source" to the worm?
Hmm.

As you would see from the disassembly analysis of the worm that I sent, the
worm will still attack people outside of their own IP range, but at a
reduced rate compared to the number inside that range.
However, the increased number of threads and increased efficiency means that
it will infect hosts faster all over.

The backdoor would allow someone to 'auto update' the worm too..
It'll be interesting to see what will come out next, piggybacking upon the
already-opened backdoor.

&gt; &gt; It should answer some of your questions.

&gt; Toby,
&gt;
&gt; An IT journalist sent me this in an e-mail:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; =======================================================
&gt; bool is_Chinese = (GetSystemDefaultLangID() matches CHINESE)
&gt;
&gt; nthreads  = is_Chinese ? 600    : 300;
&gt; sleeptime = is_Chinese ? 2 Days : 1 Day;
&gt;
&gt; while ( nthreads-- &gt; 0 )
&gt;         spawn_thread;
&gt;
&gt; Sleep(sleeptime);
&gt;
&gt; ExitWindowsEx(EXW_FORCEIFHUNG | EXW_REBOOT | EXW_FORCE, 0 );
&gt; =======================================================
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; He said it looks like someone bought the "hacked by Chinese" red herring
&gt; and "retaliated".
&gt; To get the above code, I guess someone somewhere must have
&gt; run a de-compiler over the code,
&gt; although of course, a disassembler would be more reliable in principle.
&gt;
&gt; Since we're in a Chinese part of IP space (the 203-space), I guess
&gt; we have to wait 2 days now for the thing to die down.
&gt; Anyway, we'll all be wise by Xmas.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
