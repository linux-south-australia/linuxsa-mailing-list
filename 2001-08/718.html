Alan,

&gt; Please do try it and comment back to linuxSA.
&gt; I haven't bought SuSE 7.2 yet. So I can't test it.

Checkout CFS.  It's available as a package under Debian (in non-US).
It's a user space crypto file system that works via NFS.  No kernel
patches required, just a working NFS client and server.  

Very easy to setup ("apt-get install cfs" if you've got a real
distribution :-P) and the individual users can easily setup their own
encrypted directories and mount them in clear text without root
privileges.

Basic user operations looks like:

  To create an encrypted directory:
    cmkdir $HOME/crypt
  which prompts for the pass phase for the new encrypted directory.

  To mount the new encrypted directory for clear text use:
    cattach $HOME/crypt cleartext
  which prompts for the pass-phase entered before.  The clear text 
  then provided by default in /crypt/cleartext.  You can then use this
  directory like any other (eg cp -a $HOME/secret_documents
  /crypt/cleartext/secret_documents).  Resizing happens
  automatically. 

  To unmount the clear text:
    cdetach cleartest
  or reboot.

I've never looked into the relative speed but ball park is 5 times
slower for my experience.  I use to use it to store ~300Mb of work data
onto my laptop (was a 333Mhz PII) using CFS, which I rsynced each
night.  An incremental update of about 10Mb use to take about a minute
(again ball park).

I'm also fairly ignorant of the security.  I believe it uses Triple
DES but there are of course other issues (eg. you should disable swap
when using it to make sure you don't swap the clear text out to disk,
you should make sure your box is secure when you attach the clear text
directory etc. etc.).  I'm not part of the NSA so I don't care that
much.

Also the last time I looked at the package, it was pretty old so I'm
not sure if anyone is maintaining it.  

Enjoy,
Michael
