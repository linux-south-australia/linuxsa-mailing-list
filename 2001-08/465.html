&gt; Why speculate? It's public information, read it for yourself :)

Yes I've read it.

&gt; Briefly - yes, their suggestion does indeed block the packet stream 
&gt; without resetting it as such. But the worm doesn't retarget your 
&gt; address over and over, it sprays requests to random IP's. So I doubt 
&gt; its going to threaten the capacity of your connection table (which is 
&gt; pretty big)

Not for me, but it could well be for some bigger sites that have many 
ip's on the same server.

Do not forget, part of the effiency of CodRedII is it does  most of 
its attacking in a close address space. So if you have a /25 on one
server you can bet it will get hit many times at once and also many
different worms can be attacking the same system.

Anyhow as I said it will not affect me but it is something that others
may just want to be aware of.

Also I'm starting to really wonder about how affective it really is 
(I know it will stop a successfull attack) since it only drops 1 
packet out of the entire stream.  All the rest will still get through.
How many times does CodeRedII assume the packet was lost & retry?
Generating more traffic.

All NBAR really appears successfull at is removing the attack signature
so most end points will no longer detect the attack.
