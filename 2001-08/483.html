&gt; Just thought I would introduce myself to the list and greet you
&gt; all. My name
&gt; is Colin and I live in Bowden/Brompton. I am hopefully going to

Hello Colin from Bowden/Brompton...

&gt; do my best to
&gt; participate in the linuxsa group come to meetings and so on. I will
&gt; definitely be there at the upcoming install-fest sounds like it
&gt; will be a bit
&gt; of fun and also I will get to meet other people with possibly similar
&gt; interests.
&gt; I come from a computing background although computer use
&gt; experience has been
&gt; negligible until recently (last few months)as I stopped working with
&gt; computers over a decade ago and back then I was working as a
&gt; programmer using
&gt; RPL and D on a PDP-11/73 running RT-11/TSX.
&gt; Anyone know of any jobs going for experienced but out of practise PDP-11
&gt; programmers? Hmmmm - I didn't think so!

"what's a PDP-11?" ;) ...

(kidding)...

&gt;
&gt; Anyway my question (wipes sweat from brow after writing the first
&gt; draft of
&gt; autobiography) is how many people are regular attenders of the
&gt; LinuxSA group
&gt; and are the meeting black tie affairs? (if so can someone lend me a tux)

about 50-100 people attend the meetings, but it varies... Very casual --
come in your best blue jeans and nerd tshirt (or whatever -- people just
wear whatever they were wearing previously)... Basically, just rock up... :)
