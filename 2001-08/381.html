<H1>Microsoft's Code Red II fix</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Microsoft's official fix for Code Red II infections is out:

<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/security/tools/redfix.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/security/tools/redfix.asp</A>

Although it's dated August 7 it seems to have taken a while for it
to be noticed by security news sites (even allowing for timezone diffs).
Microsoft emphasises that this tool only fixes Code Red damage. It
doesn't fix any other hacks that may have happened since infection;
and they recommend a total rebuild for any infected systems that
were/are online.

Now in a Perfect World (tm) everyone with a Win NT4/2000 box will
immediately download & apply this fix, and we can all stop amusing
ourselves with tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log...

Of course that's about as likely as me giving birth to a turnip
tomorrow; so I'm implementing a small change to my Apache which
will force people with infected computers to confront this problem.
Nothing that changes their system in any way, and only triggered
on receipt of a Code Red GET. I'll let the list know how it goes.

About 1 in 12 Code Red probes logged here today have been from
Code Red I a.k.a. "GET /default.ida?NNN...". Either some totally
clueless types who can't even set their computer clocks, or maybe
a cover for other shenanigans.

I also logged a "GET /x.ida?AAAAAAAA....AAA" earlier today. This
is the signature of Eeye's Code Red Vulnerabilty Scanner tool.
Someone Out There in 198.142.x.x is playing around!


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
