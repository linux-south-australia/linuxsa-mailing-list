Hi John,

I don't understand your perspective.  Only in the closed-source
world do we need to be concerned about the financial stability
of vendors.  In the Linux world we have many distributors selling
into a crowded market.

Some will inevitably fail.  Open source licenses prevent that
failure from having a huge effect on the business that uses the
software.  If it worries you then use a distribution like Debian,
where the currency that counts is goodwill rather than cash.

As for funding development, business need not do this.  Business
spends billions of dollars on programming, they can assign one
of those programmers to an open source project that they feel
is critical or with an bit of work could be useful for them.
The pay-off for business is that the maintenance happens for
free as other people take the work and run with it.

You'll also find that this development happens in a secondary
sense, companies that sell to business will make modifications
to make the product more attractive.

Also, at opposite extremes, are the hobbyists and the for-profit
distributors.

Programmers program.  And I know a few people that spend
their days working on COBOL and their evenings tinkering
with anything but COBOL.  They aren't going to stop doing
that if the distributor of their Linux goes under.

Some distributors also pay coders, supposedly to give them an
edge.  And this is probably true, but it's not a great
or unreproducable edge.  To date this has worked because
the people have been extraordinary.

We are also seeing the emergence of computer companies
supporting the development of Linux.  SGI seem to be doing
this to retire their own Unix operating system, and to
make their hardware attractive (people don't want to but
hardware that runs a unique OS, even if they are buying
unique hardware).

IBM are doing this as they see it as a way to Nirvana, a
single OS that runs on their incredibly diverse product
range.  This isn't just to look nice on viewgraphs.  They
don't want an IBM shop getting to the top of the AIX range
and then buying Brand H or Brand S.  Rather they can now
sell them a mainframe.

In summary, "supporting the product you use" can be done in a
huge variety of ways depending upon your time and talents.  One
of the most valuable forms of support is simply nicely answering
questions on LinuxSA and similar lists.  This has a real bottom-line
effect, as it keeps the support costs for your Linux distributor
low.
