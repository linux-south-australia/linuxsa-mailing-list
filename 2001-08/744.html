Sigh.  Into google I enter "reverse engineering java" and I follow the first 
link.  From there I see that the following Java bytecode -&gt; Java source code 
software is out there:  Decaf, GuavaD, IceBreaker, Jad, Jasmine, Jive, Mocha, 
Rose2Java, SourceAgain and WingDis.  At least some of these work very well from 
what I've seen.

I've been involved in some large java software development projects and trust 
me, it's an issue to run obfuscators over your code to make reverse engineering 
difficult.  It is possible to hide your code, but it's not easy.  Most compiled 
java bytecode is easy to get back.  It's a big research area to find new 
ways of hiding the code.

&gt; I don't think the reason it's compiled in the first place is to obfuscate
&gt; the code.  I'm pretty sure the reason is to make it run faster (than
&gt; a high-level interpretation), and once translated to a very different
&gt; language, translating it back is non-trivial

Correct.  You don't compile for obfuscation, but commercial java products 
perform another step, post compile to byte code[1], to rearrange the bytecode 
to confuse the decompilers.  Speed is one reason java is compiled, as you 
correctly point out, but most people are willing to sacrifice some speed to 
protect their IP[2].

[1] And sometimes before compile too.
[2] And I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the concept of IP.
